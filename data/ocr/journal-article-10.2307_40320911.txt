<plain_text><page sequence="1">Richard M. Gale The Metaphysics of John Dewey I. The Professed Metaphysics of John Dewey Introduction John Dewey was not the greatest philosopher of all time, only the greatest person ever to have been a philosopher. His greatness was his character, his heart; for, more than any other philosopher, Dewey cared about improving the lives of his fellow human beings, and he worked with unmatched energy and dedication throughout his long life, which spanned almost ninety-two years, in the service of this ideal.1 He can best be described as a Biblical prophet who had a Ph.D. in philosophy. He even likened himself to John the Baptist,2 which is an apt comparison since both claimed to foresee the coming of a Messiah who would enable us to make everything right with ourselves and our society. But Dewey's Messiah, unlike John's, is not going to ride into town on the back of a donkey wearing open-toed sandals, like some kind of hippie. Rather his Messiah dwells within each person, being nothing but their native intelligence, which makes it possible for them to develop into effective cooperative problem solvers, provided that they employ a generalized form of scientific method, called "inquiry". Dewey not only worked tirelessly at articulating the nature of inquiry but attempted to apply it to most of the societal ills of his day and often with considerable success. In a more enlightened society than ours, he would be among Matters best selling action figures, no doubt with a manually adjustable mustache - let it droop when he is writing in his study (the figure comes with a toy desk and a beat-up old typewriter) and point upward when engaged in a heated public debate. Dewey wrote with the apostolic fervor of someone who has seen the truth in full frontal nudity and knows how it can be used to save us. This gave his writings a very preachy quality, which would have been offensive were it not for the fact that they reeked with a sincerity the like of which has never been matched, not even by Elvis Presley. Moreover, his sermons had the ring of truth. Ever since I first read John Dewey, which was in my first class in philosophy in 1950, 1 have firmly believed that if I would place one hand on my copy of his Experience and Transactions of the Charles S. Peirce Society Fall, 2002, Vol. XXXVIII, No. 4</page><page sequence="2">478 Richard M. Gale Nature, opened or unopened, it didn't matter, and the other on where it hurt, I would be cured. Many times throughout my adult life I have been tempted to put five dollars in an envelop and send it to him so that he would pray for me, as well as all the sick and shut-ins. But what exactly was Dewey's vision of salvation like? And what is needed to achieve it? Salvation is a process of full human flourishing in which people, through their own free actions, bring about a full realization and integration of all of their best potentialities. To achieve a full integration of the self it is necessary to achieve a unification with both one's natural environment and society. Dewey appealed to the emerging social sciences in support of his view that everything that is distinctive about human beings results from their active participation within a society of fellow humans. Because of this deep involvement between persons, such that each person's self-realization depends upon that of the other persons in her society, it follows that each person can find salvation only if everyone else does. But to achieve full human flourishing, they must learn the technique of gaining control over their environment, both physical and social, so that they can effectively bring about their growth, that is, their creation of ever higher order syntheses and unifications, both within themselves and in their relations with nature and their fellow persons. What technique of problem solving will best aid such growth? Past experience teaches us that it is a general version of the method that has been so successfully employed in science, as well in our successful problem-solving activities in everyday life. Such inquiries begin with an indeterminate or problematic situation that calls for action in order to restore integration and harmony between an organism and its environment. Relevant facts of the case must be gathered so that a likely plan of action can be devised and then acted on so. If the original indeterminate situation thereby gets transformed into a determinate one, the inquiry has succeeded. If this fails to happen, a new plan of action must be devised, and so on until we succeed. This method of inquiry can be successfully employed only in a society that is democratic in the moral sense of according to everyone the freedom, both positive and negative, to realize their potentialities through joint, cooperative inquiry. To enable people to become effective joint inquirers they must be educated in a way that will develop in them the ability to inquire in a collective and cooperative manner, in which they accord to all of their fellow inquirers all the rights and privileges appertaining to respected and empowered fellow inquirers. Only when we learn how to apply the technique of scientific inquiry to our social, political, economic, and moral problems will salvation be realized. To accomplish this we must make use of our best available scientific knowledge to devise plans for large-scale social action so as to eliminate or at least ameliorate these "problems of men", to use a tide of one of Dewey's books. Dewey's panacea of salvation- through-inquiry seems eminently reasonable. However, it is easier said than done, for there are, as Dewey never tires of</page><page sequence="3">The Metaphysics of John Dewey 479 pointing out, sinister repressive forces afoot in contemporary societies that block the realization of a Deweyan moral democracy and thereby prevent the effective wide-scale use of the method of inquiry to solve the problems of men. Some of these forces, Dewey argues, undermine our negative freedom by blocking our freedom of speech and assembly. Others undermine our positive freedom to gain effective control of our lives by preventing us from being afforded the requisite social, political, economic, and educative opportunities to become effective inquirers. Deconstruction of Traditional Metaphysics Surprisingly, among the many culprits Dewey names as blocks to wide- spread effective inquiry is traditional metaphysics. But why metaphysics rather than the bike riders? It is because metaphysics has the following four undesirable consequences. Because it locates true being in some timeless supernatural realm it saps our incentive to take our workaday world seriously and fosters an undemocratic, hierarchical society in which one class exercises authority over other classes. Its theses are unverifiable and thus without cognitive meaning, and, as a result, it is completely aloof from the concerns and activities of ordinary people. Each of these charges will Jbe considered in turn. (1) Traditional metaphysics located true being in some timelessly immutable, super-sensible reality, such as Plato's forms, Aristotle's essences, the eternal one of Plotinus, Hegel's Absolute, and the God of traditional theism. This created an invidious ontological distinction between the changing workaday world in which we are up to our necks in problematic situations and a perfect reality in which is realized all of the things that we prize as ideal ends. This ontological downgrading of the world of becoming belittles its importance, and thereby saps our incentive to labor in behalf of these ends through the use of inquiry. Herein we take, not the occasional moral holiday that William James saw as the cash value of Absolute Idealism, but a permanent one. But to read back into an order of things which exists without the participation of our reflection and aim, the quality which defines the purpose of our thought and endeavor is at one and the same stroke to mythologize reality and to deprive the life of thoughtful endeavor of its ground for being. (MW3, 127) The most serious indictment to be brought against non- empirical philosophies is that they have cast a cloud over the things of ordinary experience. They have not been content to rectify things. They have discredited them at large... [They] have denied that common experience is capable of developing from within itself methods which</page><page sequence="4">480 Richard M. Gale will secure direction for itself and will create inherent standards of judgment and value. (LW1, 40-1) (2) Moreover, this invidious ontological distinction invariably has rationalized the existence of an undemocratically structured society in which some privileged class of "philosopher kings" or "priests", who supposedly possess special epistemic powers of accessing the realm of true being, exercised authoritative control over the masses. This is the biggest block of all to inquiry, especially since these privileged knowers claimed to have a special authority with respect to matters concerning values and higher spiritual realities, thus preventing social, political, economic, and moral issues from being subject to intelligent inquiry. Even the traditional Cartesian dualism between the mental and the physical had the pernicious social consequences of endorsing the authority of some privileged social class. The relation between mind and matter really is the abstract form of the problem of the relation of the so- called material, that is, industrial and economic life, to the intellectual and ideal life of a democracy, and particularly to the ethical demands of democracy for a just distribution of economic opportunity and economic reward. One might even show how the entire dualism of mind and matter haunting the footsteps of historic philosophy is, at bottom, a reflex of a separation of want, of appetite, from reason, from the ideal, which in turn was the expression of non-democratic societies in which the 'higher' and spiritual life of the few was built upon and conditioned by the 'lower' and economic life ofthemany.(MW3,76) (3) This is not the end of Dewey's beef with traditional metaphysics. Because it attempts to give us knowledge about a non-empirical reality, its claims are not empirically verifiable, and, as a result, the disputes between rival metaphysicians are intractable and futile. But the problems to which non-empirical method gives rise in philosophy are blocks to inquiry, blind alleys; they are puzzles rather than problems. (LW1, 17) The formalism and unreality of the problem [of the relation between mind and matter] remains, however, in the theories which have been offered as its "solutions"... The diversity of solutions together with the dialectical character of each doctrine which renders it impregnable</page><page sequence="5">The Metaphysics of John Dewey 48 1 to empirical attack, suggest that the trouble lies not so much in the solutions, as in the factors which determine statement of the problem. (LW1, 194) Variation [among philosophies] has extended so far that the controversial and polemic nature of philosophy and the failure of representatives of opposed doctrinal schools to reach agreement are among the great causes of the general loss of esteem that philosophy is progressively undergoing. (LW1, 332-3) If this sounds like Richard Rorty, it is no accident, since his deconstruction of philosophy uses Dewey as a springboard. (4) Because traditional metaphysics uses a non-empirical method, its claims are not only untestable but also fail to enrich our everyday experience. So far as philosophy is marked by aloofness, by irresponsibility, by pompous futility, so far philosophy cries aloud of the evils due to its departure from the common method and test. Having repudiated as a test of its truths the test of use and practice, it can hardly be surprised if it find itself in a state of "splendid isolation," where the isolation is most evident and the splendor depends upon the point of view. (MW6, 52) The Things of ordinary experience do not get enlargement and enrichment of meaning as they do when approached through the medium of scientific principles and reasonings. This lack of function reacts... back upon the philosophic subject-matter itself. Not tested by being employed to see what it leads to in ordinary experience and what new meanings it contributes, this subject-matter becomes arbitrary, aloof - what is called "abstract" when that word is used in a bad sense to designate something which exclusively occupies a realm of its own without contact with the things of ordinary experience. (LW1, 17) In mounting an all-out attack against traditional metaphysics, Dewey really is attempting to exorcise his own personal devil; for he began his professional career as an ardent Hegelian absolute idealist, and a believing and practicing Christian to boot, both of which he did not give up until after he left the University of Michigan for the University of Chicago in 1894. Dewey was well aware of this</page><page sequence="6">482 Richard M. Gale demon when he wrote the following in 1930. I imagine that my development has been controlled largely by a struggle between a native inclination toward the schematic and formally logical, and those incidents of personal experience that compelled me to take account of actual material. Probably there is in the consciously articulated ideas of every thinker an over- weighting of just those things that are contrary to his intrinsic bent, and which, therefore, he has to struggle to bring to expression... a case might be made out for the proposition that the emphasis upon the concrete, empirical, and "practical" in my later writings is partly due to considerations of this nature... It is, I suppose, becoming a commonplace that when anyone is unduly concerned with controversy, the remarks that seem to be directed against others are really concerned with a struggle that is going on inside himself. (LW5, 150-1) Dewey's impassioned deconstruction of traditional metaphysics reads like that of a reformed metaphysician who is always struggling to resist temptation. If he allows himself just one sip of metaphysics, it will set him off on a binge that will end with him brown-bagging it in some hallway spouting incoherent drivel about the Absolute, which reminds me of the time I was having a discussion with C.J. Ducasse late at night on a street corner in Greenwich Village about absolute idealism. Some derelict was standing next to us waiting for an opportunity to break in and ask us for some money so he could get some hot soup and beans in himself. When he heard Ducasse mention Hegel, he immediately asked, "Will one of you dialectical intellectuals give me a quarter?" That derelict, but for the grace of God, would have been John Dewey. There is a tension between the different ills that Dewey finds in metaphysics. On the one hand, he argues that because metaphysical claims are unverifiable they are devoid of cognitive content, but, on the other hand, argues that these claims have had the pernicious effects of sapping our incentive to lead the morally strenuous life and supporting undemocratic societies. It would seem that metaphysics cannot have these pernicious effects unless it can be an object of belief and thus not devoid of all cognitive meaning. Dewey's response would be that although traditional metaphysics is devoid of any cognitive meaning it has significance in that it expresses human ideals and aspirations. Systems of philosophy however abstract in conception and technical exposition lie, after all, much nearer the heart of social, and of national, life than superficially</page><page sequence="7">The Metaphysics of John Dewey 48 3 appears... philosophy is a language in which the deepest social problems and aspirations of a given time and a given people are expressed in intellectual and impersonal symbols. (MW3, 73) For things which are false or even meaningless if they are taken to be what they purport to be, statements about the ultimate structure of the universe and absolute truth, acquire another import when they are interpreted in the context of their bearing upon human and social predicaments and activities. (LW15, 16) James's Will-to-Believe was not concerned with scientific truth but the significance, that is, the weight, the momentousness, the raison d'etre^ of philosophical systems and principles. (LW15, IS)3 Although Dewey argued strenuously against the emotive theory of ethics of the logical positivists, he was in full agreement with their emotive theory of metaphysics, even down to the heaping of rhetorical scorn upon its other-worldly forms, as was amply seen in some of the preceding quotations. There are serious problems with Dewey's emotive theory of metaphysics, but I cannot pursue them now. Empirical Metaphysics After Dewey threw off the yoke of absolute idealism in the mid- 1890s by devising his pragmatic or instrumentalistic theory, he expressed pride in the fact that his theory required no metaphysical support. [Instrumentalism] involves the doctrine that the origin, structure, and purpose of knowing are such as to render nugatory any wholesale inquiries into the nature of Being. (MW6, 89) But the chief characteristic trait of the pragmatic notion of reality is precisely that no theory of Reality in general, uberhaupt, is possible or needed. (MW10, 39) But, as Dewey matured as a philosopher, he came to realize that metaphysics need not be pernicious, since there is a legitimate empirical way to do it, which, moreover, can make us better inquirers by showing how inquiry fits into the larger scheme of things.</page><page sequence="8">484 Richard M. Gale We may begin with experience in gross, experience in its primary and crude forms, and by means of its distinguishing features and its distinctive trends, note something of the world which generates and maintains it. (LW1, 366) This program is worked out in Dewey's classic work, Experience and Nature, whose stated aim is "to discover some of these general features of experienced things and to interpret their significance for a philosophic theory of the universe in which we live" (LW1, 14). Following Aristotle, Dewey held that "metaphysics is cognizance of the generic traits of existence" (LW1, 50).4 The outcome would be a naturalistic metaphysics that would be testable in terms of its experiential consequences, thereby satisfying his pragmatic requirement that a meaningful idea or hypothesis be empirically verifiable by future consequences. What is this empirical method for doing metaphysics? and how is a metaphysical theory to be verified? Throughout his career, even when he was an absolute idealist, Dewey was seeking to find an empirical method for doing philosophy that would set it on the path of a science in which there is a growing body of truths accepted by all competent practitioners. In 1886 he called this method the "psychological standpoint". It holds that "the nature of all objects of philosophical inquiry is to be fixed by finding out what experience says about them. And psychology is the scientific and systematic account of this experience" (EW1, 123). In 1905 the name of the method of experience was changed to "immediate empiricism", according to which "Anything, everything, in the ordinary or non-technical use of the term "thing"... are what they are experienced as. Hence, if one wishes to describe anything truly, his task is to tell what it is experienced as being" (MW3, 158). In a note that was added to this essay in 1910, Dewey unwittingly changes the postulate of immediate empiricism in a way that trivializes it, for it is now claimed that "Philosophy can pass upon its nature - as upon the nature of all of the rest of its subject-matter - only by first ascertaining what it exists or occurs a? (MW3, 166). That everything is as it exists as is an empty tautology, unlike the claim that everything is as it is experienced, which is an exciting, hotly contested thesis. In Experience and Nature the name of the method again changes, this time to the "denotative method." This is a most unfortunate name, since it suggests that in doing philosophy one just points to things that are given in experience. But if philosophers are confined to just pointing, a face-to-face dispute between philosophers would resemble the state that Aristotle claimed philosophers would be left in if they rejected the law of noncontradiction, namely they could only mutely gesture with their index finger as if they were making a point. Plato, for example, would silently point his index finger toward the heavens where his forms are housed and Aristotle would shake his head and point to empirical</page><page sequence="9">The Metaphysics of John Dewey 485 objects about him, because of his rejection of Plato's separation of the forms from the empirical particulars that instantiated them. As an autobiographical aside, I have found that I am unable to give a lecture to beginning students on the difference between Plato and Aristotle without making such ostensive gestures. Fortunately, I did more than this: I had something enlightening to say, such as "Aristotle brought Plato's forms down from heaven to earth," and that is why I somehow managed to get tenured. Ostending not only does not describe but it also is radically ambiguous with respect to its referent, a point that both Dewey and Wittgenstein stressed. To disambiguate the referent of an act of ostensión, some description must accompany the act. Dewey is well aware of this, since he requires that the empirical metaphysician - the good kind of metaphysician - describe things in terms of what they are experienced as. To experience as involves the employment of some concept or description. In fact, Dewey thought that all perceptual experience is an active perceiving as, this being the basis of his attack on the myth of the given. But if concepts must be employed by the empirical metaphysician, which concepts should they be? It would appear that the metaphysician is free to choose what they will be, which would destroy the neutrality of perspective that Dewey was after in his empirical method. Another way of making this point is that every description requires a context which will determine what are the relevant concepts to use. But what is the context in which we are to describe the generic traits of existence? Dewey seems to be impaled on the horns of a dilemma. Either the metaphysician's description of the generic traits of existence makes use of concepts or it does not. If it does, the neutrality of her perspective is undermined and thereby Dewey's empirical metaphysics does not escape the endless, intractable disputes that were the bane of traditional metaphysics. And, if it does not employ concepts, Dewey violates his own rejection of a non- conceptually given in experience. This problem will be put aside for the time being. Another problem for the denotative method of doing metaphysics is that it seems to beg the question against the metaphysician who holds there to be supersensible, transcendent realities. For such realities cannot be ostended, since only what is sensibly perceived can be pointed at. A similar sort of begging of the question occurs with William James's postulate of empiricism in his doctrine of Radical Empiricism which requires that philosophers limit themselves to what is definable in terms drawn from experience. What does Dewey discover to be the generic traits of all existents through the use of his empirical or denotative method? It is that every existent involves some mixture of the precarious and the stable, the settled and the unsettled, the determinate and the indeterminate. In addition, each of them possesses a unique qualitative individuality and is an event or processual. It is curious that the arguments that Dewey presents for these traits being generic are not based on what is phenomenologically vouchsafed by gross experience, which is what you</page><page sequence="10">486 Richard M. Gale would expect, given his adherence to the denotative method - the method of immediate experience - but instead are based on the findings of cultural anthropologists, Goldenweiser, Sumner, Tylor, Malinowski, and Boas, with respect to the discourses of different cultures. I believe that the explanation for this curiosity is that Dewey was working with two different senses of generic, namely what is common to all experienced entities and what is common to every universe of discourse. At one place, he speaks of the generic traits as "the traits and characters that are sure to turn up in every theme of discourse" (LW1, 308). He obscured the distinction between these two different senses of generic by his occasional use of "universe of experience" interchangeably with "universe of discourse" (LW12, 74). In dealing with the question of whether Dewey's alleged generic traits are in fact generic, we must divide the question between the found- in-every-experienced-existent and found-in-every-universe-of-discourse sense of "generic." Are these traits found in every experienced existent, no less every existent? Let's first consider Dewey's claim that every such existent is found to be an event or processual. Certainly, this is not something vouchsafed by gross experience, for when I perceive a chair, for example, I don't ordinarily see it as a change or as a process, as I might if the chair was made of ice cream and was rapidly melting in a hot sun. Dewey supports his event ontology by appeal to how natural science conceives of the chair, as a succession of events, but this conception is not phenomenologically-based. Furthermore, by having theoretical science determine the nature of reality, Dewey goes against his instrumentalistic account of the theoretical entities of science, which denies an objective existence to them, and instead sees them as nothing but the inferential vines that connect gross experiences. He does give an empirically-based argument for every existent being an event, but the argument contains a howler. But in truth anything which can exist at any place and at any time occurs subject to tests imposed upon it by its surroundings, which are only in part compatible and reinforcing.... The stablest thing we can speak of is not free from conditions set to it by other things. That even the solid earth mountains, the emblems of constancy, appear and disappear like the clouds is an old theme of moralists and poets.... [Therefore] every existence is an event. (LW1, 63) The argument seems to be this: 1 . Every existent changes. 2. Therefore, every existent is a change (event)</page><page sequence="11">The Metaphysics of John Dewey 487 This is like arguing that since every existent has a color, every existent is a color, which is based on failing to distinguish between the "is" of predication and the "is" of identity. What about the traits of having some mixture of the precarious and the stable. Are they traits of every experienced entity? Again, we find that our gross experience doesn't support Dewey's genericality claim. Most of the things that we perceive are not perceived as combining these traits. A chair, for example, is not perceived as being unstable or precarious unless it is missing a leg or the like. A more promising way of construing Dewey's claim that every existent is perceived as combining precarious and stable traits is that every existent is perceived as being related to a problematic situation. Since a problematic situation, which is the initial stage in an inquiry, combines these traits, this is tantamount to saying that we experience everything in terms of how it pertains to inquiry. Dewey, in fact, says this at many places. "The conjunction of problematic and determinate characters in nature renders every existence, as well as every idea and human act, an experiment in fact, even though not in design" (LW1, 63). "Awareness means attention, and attention means a crisis of some sort in an existential situation" (MW4, 72). The following explicit argument, based on the premise that every experience is inquiry-related, can be given for Dewey's claim that every existent,5 and not just every experienced existent, has inquiry-related traits. Main Argument of Experience and Nature 1 . Every existent is an experience.6 2. Every experience has the generic traits of existence. 3. The generic traits of existence are inquiry-related traits. 4. Every existent has inquiry-related traits. Obviously, premise 3 stands in need of some justification, and the following is an argument for 3 that is in the spirit of Dewey's humanistic philosophy. Subsidiary Argument for 3 5. We humans can describe existents only from a human point of view. 6. The human point of view is an inquiry-based one. 7. We humans can describe the generic traits of existence only in terms of properties that pertain to inquiry. Therefore, 3. The generic traits of existence are inquiry-related traits. This is the sort of argument that Dewey would have to come up with in</page><page sequence="12">488 Richard M. Gale order to meet the standard objection that his metaphysics is nothing but philosophical anthropology - a description of man-in-the-world but not a description of the-world-as-it-is-in-itself apart from its relation to men. Sidney Hook wrote that Dewey would have done well in my view to modify his conception of metaphysics and to avoid the imputation that it is an independent discipline that gives us knowledge of the world that we cannot reach by any other study, and that what it gives us knowledge about are generic traits that are discoverable in any subject- matter or every universe of discourse.... What he is really interested in is cataloging and analyzing those features of the world that have an important bearing on the human condition, on human hopes and possibilities, that are often taken for granted without being clearly articulated. (Introduction to LW1, xiv) And, in the same vein, Richard Rorty claimed that "It is easier to think of the book [Experience and Nature] as an explanation of why nobody needs a metaphysics rather than as itself a metaphysical system".7 But is premise 6 true? Is it true that the human point of view always is an inquiry-based one, which would entail that we are always inquiring and thus perceiving every existent as related to some on-going inquiry? That we are not always inquiring was forcefully brought home to me one Sunday morning in a bakery filled with regular customers. A portly middle-aged gentleman told the counterlady, also portly and middle-aged, that he wanted a dozen chocolate doughnuts even though they wouldn't be good for his boyish figure, to which she responded "You said it. I didn't," which occasioned gales of laughter in the bakery, as if this was an original line being heard for the first time. I am a quick study and immediately figured out that I was in the cliché bakery so that when the next gentlemen, before placing his order, told the counterlady that he was going on a cruise next week, I jumped in and said "Don't do anything I wouldn't do," which also occasioned considerable laughter, though not as much as the counterlady's remark. When the laughter subsided, the counterlady quipped, "He said it. I didn't," which really broke up the bakery. Even I could hardly keep my feet. It suddenly occurred to me that the idle banter in the bakery is the very cement that holds our society together, being an instance of the ritualistic or ceremonial use of language. The bakery example of a non-inquiry can be changed so that the counterlady was performing an inquiry; for example, she was ordered by her boss to increase sales and was experimenting with the use of humor to achieve this end. But it is no great feat to change a counter-example into a non-counter-example by changing it.</page><page sequence="13">The Metaphysics of John Dewey 489 The bakery is not an isolated counter-example. There are countless instances of uses of language that are not inquiry-related, such as when we are just hanging out, chilling, or bullshiting, provided it is to amuse rather than defraud. Many of our most important activities and experiences, such as praying, having religious experiences, and making love, are not inquiry related. When two people make love for the right reason, namely to communicate on a deep level so they can achieve a union of their spirits through a union of their flesh, they are not performing an inquiry in which they are formulating plans of action to resolve a problematic situation - I have something stiff and throbbing and wonder what I can do about it. This, unfortunately, isn't always the case. You might be a gigolo or in women's underwear, so to speak, and she is the buyer from Saks or you might be a song-plugger and she is the record librarian who programs the shows for all the disc jockeys at the station. Dewey's insistence that we are always inquiring leads to some pernicious consequences. Consider his following claims. They [pleasure and enjoyment] are something to be investigated, challenges to inquiry and judgment. The more connections and interactions we ascertain, the more we know the object in question. (LW4, 213) Reflection upon what we have liked and have enjoyed is a necessity. But it tells us nothing about the value of these things until enjoyments are themselves reflectively controlled, or, until, as they are recalled, we form the best judgment possible about what led us to like this sort of thing and what has issued from the fact that we liked it. (LW4, 217) All experienced objects have a double status. They are individualized, consummately, whether in the way of enjoyment or suffering. They are also involved in a continuity of interactions and changes, and hence are causes and potential means of later experiences. Because of this dual capacity, they become problematic. Immediately and directly they are just what they are; but as transitions to and possibilities of later experiences they are uncertain. (LW4, 188) If we take these claims seriously, it would require us to treat all of our experiences of enjoyment as occasions for an inquiry into their causes and consequences. I enjoyed the idle banter and bull-shit in the bakery but that should not require that I investigate the causes and consequences of this enjoyable experience. More</page><page sequence="14">490 Richard M. Gale seriously, think of the pernicious consequences that would result from subjecting our enjoyable sexual experiences with our beloved spouse or, if you prefer, one- night stand to such inquiry. When the townies in the bar warned the man who is about to travel up the mountain to Count Dracula's castle that there are some things that man should not know, they had it right. To investigate the causes of our enjoyable sexual experiences would drain the experiences of all their marvelous mystery. Do you really want to find out that she looks like your mother. This is not to say that there are not occasions when such experiences do become problematic and there is a need to consult therapists and sex manuals. But, fortunately, not all occasions of enjoying or valuing are of this problematic sort. Dewey's moral idiocy about intimate human relations is the price he paid for being a John the Baptist. This sort of one-idea fanaticism was not confined to his claim that we always are (or should be) inquiring. The bad man is the man who no matter how good he has been is beginning to deteriorate, to grow less good. The good man is the man who no matter how morally unworthy he has been is moving to become better. (MW12, 180-1) A consequence of this mad dog pronouncement is that if the Marquis de Sade shows moral improvement - he no longer tortures to death ten but only nine helpless victims each day and now contributes three instead of two dollars annually to his favorite charity, the Home for Wayward Girls - he is the good man! Albert Schweitzer, on the other hand, if he were to become less morally good - he does not adhere as strictly to his reverence-for-life principle as he formerly did (he swatted a mosquito last night in his tent), and he now medically administers to only ninety-nine rather than, as he formerly did, one hundred patients each day - he would qualify as the bad man. One does not know whether to say of Dewey's ethical pronouncement that it is perverse or just silly. Probably the safest thing to say is that it is perversely silly. Some of Dewey's sympathetic interpreters have attempted to find a response to the charge that not all of our activities and experiences are inquiry-related. They have used as their jumping-off point Dewey's attempt to show that, according to biology, an organism continually has to come to grips with changes in its environment, such as those that upset its homeostasis. The truth is that in every waking moment, the complete balance of the organism and its environment is constantly interfered with and as constantly restored. (MW14, 125)</page><page sequence="15">The Metaphysics of John Dewey 491 In the process of living, attainment of a period of equilibrium is at the same time the initiation of a new relation to the environment, one that brings with it potency of new adjustments to be made through struggle. (LW10, 23) On the basis of these remarks they have argued we are always inquiring. Thomas Alexander writes that All experience is problematical in some degree. By this term, Dewey was trying to refer to the tensive focus of a situation. Lying down after a heavy meal is hardly the problematic situation that the lean hunter faces trying to snare today's food. It is for convenience that we call the latter problematic and not the former, but both are modes of adjustment.8 Tom Burke, in basic agreement with Alexander, speaks of there being a "proto- inquiry" when there is such a non-cognitive tensive problematic situation.9 There are two objections to this way of saving Dewey from all the preceding counter- examples of non-inquiry-related activities and experiences. First, Dewey's generic traits of existence are supposed to be read off from what is given in gross experience, but Alexander and Burke must appeal to facts unearthed by the science of biology. Second, a "proto-inquiry" is not an inquiry since it fails to satisfy Dewey's requirement that an inquiry employ "discourse through use of symbols" in its transformation of the original indeterminate situation into a determinate one (LW12, 109). For the same reason, Alexander's "tensive situation" is not a problematic situation; for, a problematic situation initiates an inquiry, but his after dinner rediner does not inquire, given that he does not symbolically formulate any plan of action. Maybe things will go better for Dewey if we give the universe of discourse interpretation of his generic traits of existence. Dewey never defines what a "universe of discourse" is. But whether a universe of discourse be taken in an extensional or intensional sense, his generic traits fail to be common to all of them. When taken in an extensional sense, a universe of discourse would be individuated by its ontology - the individuals over which it quantifies or refers to. So understood, it is clear that Dewey's generic traits are not common to all universes of discourse: Mathematics, for example, does not quantify over or refer to problematic situations or events. When taken intensionally, a universe of discourse is individuated by the meaning of its predicative expressions. Mathematics again is a counter-example, since it does not contain any predicates that connote being a problematic situation or being processual. But maybe Dewey had something else in mind by a universe of discourse.</page><page sequence="16">492 Richard M. Gale Given that he actually went about determining the generic traits of existence by examining the descriptions that cultural anthropologists gave of the literature or discourse of different cultures, civilizations or societies - their cosmogonies, myths, proverbs, philosophies, and literature, both oral and written - it might be that a universe of discourse should be individuated by cultures, civilizations or societies. Each one has its own universe of discourse that is unique to it. So construed, the claim that the traits of being a combination of the precarious and the stable are common to every universe of discourse would mean that every culture's literature or discourse makes mention of these traits. This way of construing Dewey's generic traits of experienced individuals fits his claim in his aborted attempt in 1949 to write an introduction to a planned new edition of Experience and Nature. Were I to write... Experience and Nature today I would entitle the book Culture and Nature and the treatment of specific subject-matters would be correspondingly modified. I would abandon the term "experience" because of my growing realization that the historical obstacles which prevented understanding of my use of "experience" are, for all practical purposes, insurmountable. I would substitute the term "culture" because with its meanings as now firmly established it can fully and freely carry my philosophy of experience. ... The name "culture" in its anthropological... sense designates the vast range of things experienced in an indefinite variety of ways. (LW1, 361-2) Another reason for the cultural construal of Dewey's universe of discourse is that it helps to explain away an apparent inconsistency in his writings. In the 1925 Experience and Nature and its revised edition of 1929, the task of metaphysics is said to be that of describing the generic traits of experience or every universe of discourse. But in 1928 "The Inclusive Philosophic Category", which falls between these two editions, an apparently different task is assigned to metaphysics, that of articulating a category which "is indicative of the widest and richest range of association empirically accessible" (LW3, 46). Being at heart a good Hegelian, he finds it to be that of the social, for a society represents the actualization of all the potentialities of individuals that are lower on the scala natura. Several commentators have noted this shift in Dewey's conception of metaphysics but have made no attempt to harmonize them.10 But, since the category of the social is the same as that of the cultural, there is a concurrence between the two accounts of the task of metaphysics. That the social is not common to every existent - a star is not social - refutes the claim that the social is a generic trait of every existent, but not the claim that every culture or</page><page sequence="17">The Metaphysics of John Dewey 493 society does take note of Dewey's generic traits of existence.11 Another point of concurrence between them is that each is an anthropomorphic metaphysics that makes reality in the image of man by imputing to it those qualities that are prominent in human activities. That Dewey's generic traits are common to every known universe of discourse in the cultural sense, however, is a far less exciting claim than that they are common to every universe of discourse in its ordinary extensional or intensional sense. And the latter claim, in turn, is far less exciting than the claim that these traits are common to every experienced existent, no less every existent simpliciter. There is, however, a more exciting true claim that can be made about Dewey's generic traits, when understood in the inquiry-related rather than universe of discourse-related sense. Although they are not found in every human activity or experience, for we are not always inquiring, it still is the case that all human activities and experiences derive part of their meaning or value from the fact that they are connected up, even if indirectly, with the workaday activity of inquiry. Consider a paradigm case of a non-inquiry-related experience, a religious or mystical experience. It is the stark significant contrast that they have with our precarious life as inquirers that imports meaning and value to such experiences, making them oases at which the self enjoys some R and R amidst the travails of the workaday world. Experiences of a timeless undifFerentiated unity are especially cherished because they give one a sense of safety and peace in the midst of a challenging world. Our life as an inquirer is like a dye that spreads over all of our experiences. Our religious experiences, in turn, can serve as a dye that colors our Promethean endeavors as inquirers. The manner in which the mystical and Promethean dimensions ideally should interpentrate is beautifully captured in Dewey's obituary for G.S. Morris. He was preeminently a man in whom those internal divisions, which eat into the heart of so much of contemporary spiritual life, and which rob the intellect of its faith in truth, and the will of its belief in the value of life, had been overcome. In the philosophical and religious conviction of the unity of man's spirit with the divine he had that rest which is energy. (EW3, 9) The interpenetration of active Promethean endeavors with passive mystical experiences is Dewey's requirement in Art and Experience to have our doings and undergoings organically connected writ large. While Dewey was in China in 1921 he contrasted the activism of the West with the aesthetic passivity of the East and found the ethical ideal to be one that combined both: "A true ideal includes factors from both sides [the West and the East]" (MW13, 266).</page><page sequence="18">494 Richard M. Gale Verification It was Dewey's commitment to verificationism that served as the linchpin of his deconstruction of traditional metaphysics. Its claims are not verifiable whereas his empirical metaphysics is. But just how is a metaphysical system to be tested? And does his own metaphysical theory pass his own verificatory tests? A traditional metaphysician would not cower before Dewey's claim that the test for a philosophy is whether "it ends in conclusions which, when referred back to ordinary life-experiences and their predicaments, render them more significant, more luminous to us, and make our dealings with them more fruitful" (LW1, 18). For all metaphysicians claim that their systems make the world of our ordinary experience more luminous, more intelligible to us. But Dewey's verificatory test requires more than purely intellectual satisfaction - the aha-that-is-how-things-really-are feeling. A metaphysical system must issue in predictions that will aid us in gaining power to control the on-going course of events, such as is done by a science. If, then, the conclusion is reached that knowing is a way of employing occurrences with respect to increasing power to direct the consequences which flow from things, the application of the conclusion must be made to philosophy itself. (MW10, 37-8) Every system of philosophy presents the consequences of some... experiment. (LW1, 35) The recorded scientific result is in effect a designation of a method to be followed and a prediction of what will be found when specified observations are set on foot. That is all a philosophy can be or do. (LW1, 39) These quotations reveal the deep scientistic streak in Dewey's philosophy, requiring of every meaningful cognitive discourse that it satisfy scientific standards of verification. This is something for the traditional metaphysician to cower before, since it is obvious that traditional metaphysics does not issue in any predictions that admit of verification. What does Aristotle's hyle-morphic system predict that Plato's theory of forms, Leibniz's monadology or Whitehead's organicism does not? Furthermore, these systems do not give us the Promethean power to "direct the consequences which flow from things," which is the ultimate verificatory test for Dewey. Before raising the question of whether metaphysical systems should have to satisfy Dewey's strong verification requirement, it will be asked whether Dewey's own "empirical" metaphysics satisfies it. It was seen that Dewey describes the generic traits of existence in terms of</page><page sequence="19">The Metaphysics of John Dewey 495 what is required for us to be inquirers; for, if they were taken to be traits of all existents, numerous counter-examples arise. The metaphysics of Experience and Nature^ accordingly, can be understood as a transcendental deduction argument for what is required if it is to be possible for inquiry to take place.12 "Any theory that detects and defines these traits [the generic traits] is therefore a ground-map of the province of criticism, establishing based lines to be employed in more intricate triangulations" (LW1, 309), in which criticism, for Dewey, is an inquiry into the causes and consequences of an enjoyment or liking. The literal meaning of the base lines metaphor is not obvious and needs to be filled in. The basic idea is that by having a firm grasp of the nature of the world in which inquiry or criticism is possible, we will somehow become more informed and dedicated cooperative inquirers. The more sure one is that the world which encompasses human life is of such and such a character. . .the more one is committed to try to direct the conduct of life, that of others as well as of himself, upon the basis of the character assigned to the world. And if he finds that he cannot succeed, that the attempt lands him in confusion, inconsistency and darkness, plunging others into discord and shutting them out from participation, rudimentary precepts instruct him to surrender his assurance as a delusion; and to revise his notions of the nature till he makes them more adequate to the concrete facts in which nature is embodied. (LW1, 309) To note, register and define the constituent structure of nature is not then an affair neutral to the office of criticism. It is a preliminary outline of the field, whose chief import is to afford understanding of the necessity and nature of the office of intelligence. (LW1, 315) By "intelligence" Dewey means inquiry. That our acceptance of Dewey's inquiry- based metaphysics has the beneficial consequence of making us better inquirers, more effective in resolving the problems of men, serves to verify his metaphysics. Dewey is subjecting his metaphysics to his pragmatic test of truth - act on the idea and see if it leads to the predicated consequences. In this case, the predicate consequences are that we will become more effective inquirers. The generic insight into existence which alone can define metaphysics in any empirically intelligible sense is itself an added fact of interaction, and is therefore subject to the same requirement of intelligence as any</page><page sequence="20">496 Richard M. Gale other natural occurrence: namely, inquiry into the bearings, leadings and consequences of what it discovers. (LW1, 310) Dewey even applied the pragmatic test to pragmatism itself. And one consequence (which «of consequence) he [the pragmatist] claims the theory will produce when acted upon is the clearing away of the artificial problems that arise from isolating the notions of statement, correspondence and consistency from their only significant context - the context of use and office. (MW6,50-l) Let us grant for the sake of argument, though this is very dubious, that if Dewey's metaphysics of inquiry were to be widely accepted, it would result in our becoming more effective inquirers. This outcome counts as verificatory only if we require of a true metaphysical theory that its wide-spread acceptance lead people to become better inquirers. But why should this outcome be the measure of the truth of a metaphysical theory, for man does not live by inquiry alone? It is here that the problem that was adumbrated earlier concerning what concepts to employ in describing what is given in gross experience arises. There is a need to supply a context for such a description in which the purposes for giving this description are made manifest. Dewey's purpose is to makes us better inquirers, but obviously that is not the purpose of every metaphysical system. Some have as their purpose to help us become more spiritual beings who can enter into a communal relation with God or the deeper dimensions of reality. Others have as their purpose to give an account that gives the best integration of everything we know about the world. Dewey was aware of this diversity of contexts or purposes for a metaphysical description when he wrote: An empirical philosophy is in any case a kind of intellectual disrobing. We cannot permanently divest ourselves of the intellectual habits we take on and wear when we assimilate the culture of our own time and place. But intelligent furthering of culture demands that we take some of them off, that we inspect them critically to see what they are made of and what wearing them does to us. (LW1, 40) I have tried to help Dewey disrobe, and what we see is that his "intellectual habits" are far from being neutral but are very much a reflection of his age, which was one of unbridled Prometheanism due to the wondrous advances of science</page><page sequence="21">The Metaphysics of John Dewey 497 and the God-like technological powers it gave us. Dewey's verificationist-based deconstruction of traditional metaphysics also is an expression of his Promethean scientisitic "intellectual habits," which takes scientific method as legislative for all meaningful discourse. Dewey, and following him, Rorty, look at the history of metaphysics, with its endless intractable debates, and are horrified because there is no agreed upon decision-procedure for resolving disputes between metaphysicians, being in this respect like a game in which it is impossible to keep score and determine who wins - a crap game played with unmarked dice. I look on it as one of the great accomplishments of the human race and see their attempt to proscribe metaphysics as an act of cultural barbarism analogous to someone who burns down the Louvre because no decision-procedure can be produced to determine when a painting is a good one or even a painting at all. All attempts to articulate the rules of the metaphysical language-game fail miserably, but that is no reason not to go on playing the game. We know how to play the game even though we cannot say what are its rules. The only proper response to the challenge posed by the deconstructionists of metaphysics is to simply ignore them and just do more metaphysics: For the only justification for metaphysics is metaphysics. Fortunately, Dewey was not the cultural barbarian he appeared to be when he was officially doing metaphilosophy and issuing his scientistic-based prohibitions against continuing to do traditional metaphysics. Dewey really was very much of a traditional metaphysician, but his real metaphysics was not his professed metaphysics based on the generic traits of existence or the inclusive philosophic idea. In part II of this paper, it will be shown that, far from being the all-destroyer of past metaphysics, Dewey really was the Plotinus of Burlington, Vermont, who developed a highly mystical philosophy that had no redeeming social value, its purpose being to give one the aha-that-is-the-way-things-really- are feeling. It turns out that it was Dewey, after all, who accosted C.J. Ducasse and myself on that Greenwich Village street corner. Some evidence for this, other than that the derelict had a drooping mustache, is that when he hit us for money he asked, "Will one of you dialectical intellectuals, as such, give me a quarter, as such." II. The "Real" Metaphysics of John Dewey It was seen in part I that the purpose, and thereby ultimate test, of Dewey's professed metaphysics based on the generic-traits-of-existence was to make us into better inquirers. It accomplished this by a disguised transcendental deduction argument which demonstrated that these traits are just what is needed for inquiry to be possible. This results in a metaphysics that depicts the world as made to order for inquiry and thus a fit habitat for a Deweyan Promethean agent. Acceptance of this metaphysics of inquiry is supposed to have the beneficial consequence of making us more effective Promethean inquirers, since it enables us to avoid getting caught in the coils of traditional pseudo-problems concerning</page><page sequence="22">498 Richard M. Gale how a conscious subject can have any cognitive relation with an extramental reality and having our moral initiative sapped by a bifurcation between man and nature. In contrast, the purpose of Dewey's real but unannounced metaphysics was to enable us to achieve unity, both within ourselves, as well as with our fellow persons and nature. This requires that we overcome every "dualism," by which Dewey meant any case in which numerically distinct entities - entities that exist separately and independently of each other - stand in a nonmediated relation to each other. That this was more than just an intellectual exercise is amply attested to by Dewey's rare autobiographical remark that "the sense of divisions and separations that were, I suppose, borne in upon me as a consequence of a heritage of New England culture, divisions by way of isolation of self from the world, of soul from body, of nature from God, brought a painful oppression - or rather, they were an inward laceration" (LW5, 153).13 He was especially tormented by these dualisms as a youth, but the poetry he wrote between 1911 and 1918 gives ample evidence that his craving to overcome them persisted well into his maturity. His feelings of isolation and division went along with heightened mystical sensitivity, which again is revealed in his poetry, as well as in the underlying tenets that drove his entire philosophical enterprise. Dewey resonated to the nature mysticism of Wordsworth, Longfellow, and Emerson and even had a full- fledged monistic mystical experience in his early twenties, in Oil City of all places, that gave him a deep sense of safety and peace. But experiential mysticism was not enough to assuage Dewey's feelings of isolation and estrangement, since he was, above all, an inveterate intellectual. What he craved was a philosophy that intellectually would bear out what he deeply felt on experiential grounds.14 Hegel's thought initially satisfied this need because it "supplied a demand for unification that was doubtless an intense emotional craving, and yet was a hunger that only an intellectualized subject-matter could satisfy" (LW5, 153). Dewey claimed that the Hegelianism of his youth "left a permanent deposit in my thinking," but the question is just how big it was (LW5, 154). It will be argued that it was far greater than any of the interpreters realized, with the exception of Steven Rockefeller, that most profound of all interpreters. This will be brought out by showing how the central ideas in the young Dewey's Hegelianism found their way into his later philosophy. The key to understanding the secret mystical philosophy of John Dewey is to take to heart the plight of poor Humpty Dumpty, who, it will be recalled, couldn't be reassembled by all the king's horses and all of the king's men after he fell off the wall and was shattered into many separate, distinct pieces. Reality, for Dewey, is Humpty Dumpty writ large; for if we ever permit it to fall apart into numerically distinct individuals, not all the king's philosophers can put it back together again into relational complexes, be they causal, spatio-temporal, or of any other kind. An explicit formulation of the Humpty Dumpty Intuition, even</page><page sequence="23">The Metaphysics of John Dewey 499 containing an allusion to the poor chap, is given in the 1929, second edition version, of Experience and Nature. [Non-empirical] methods begin with results of a reflection that has already torn in two the subject-matter [organism and environment] experienced and the operations and states of experiencing. The problem is then to get together again what has been sundered - which is as if the king's men started with the fragments of the egg and tried to construct that whole egg out of them. (LW, 19) Dewey's Humpty Dumpty Intuition was shared by his fellow pragmatists, Peirce and James, as well as by their Absolute Idealist opponents, making one suspect that there was something in the air or drinking water of the second half of the 19th century that led them to have this intuition. I suspect that they were scared by the dehumanizing bifurcationist upshot of the atomistic science of that period, which reduced reality to a mere aggregate of externally related particles, thereby precluding the sort of intimacy that they wanted to have with nature, as well as their fellow persons. William James is a very good case in point. He wrote that "immediate feeling possesses a native wholeness which conceptual treatment analyzes into a many, but can't unite"1* Paradoxes of the Zenoian and Bradleyan type, James argued, arise because our conceptualizing intellect commits us to "No discrimination without separation; no separation without absolute 'independence' and thereupon the impossibility of union."16 But things which are "logically distinct nevertheless [do] diffuse... you can't pen reality in... its nature is to spread, and affect, and... this applies to relations as well as terms, so that it is impossible to call them absolutely external to each other."17 John Dewey shared this Humpty Dumpty Intuition and developed a philosophy that would assure that Humpty Dumpty would not fall off the wall. This was accomplished by the use of an innocent looking methodological postulate for which he never gave any argument. It requires that for any apparent dualism in his sense, it be shown how it arises from functional differentiations that emanate out of some background unity. Of all the commentators, James E. Tiles has come closest to articulating this guiding methodological postulate of Dewey's philosophy when he wrote that "The principle features of Dewey's outlook arise from a method of proceeding, a habit of thought, which Dewey both recommended and practiced, that of looking at a unified phenomenon, as the product of internal differentiation over time in some simpler unity."18 What follows will trace the crucial role that the Humpty Dumpty-based methodological postulate played throughout all his writings. It will be seen that when Dewey made the transition from Absolute Idealism to what he called alternatively pragmatism, instrumentalism, or experimentalism he merely poured</page><page sequence="24">500 Richard M. Gale old wine into new bottles: The terminology changed but not the underlying Humpty Dumpty Intuition that drove his whole philosophical enterprise. In his 1882 "The Pantheism of Spinoza", which was Dewey's second published article, he asks rhetorically, "If they [God, self and the world] are independent realities, how can they relate to each other?" (EW1, 9) In order to avoid the fate of Humpty Dumpty, "God becomes the Absolute, and Nature and Self are but his manifestations" (EW1, 9). Dewey's 1884 "Kant and Philosophic Method", which gives the gist of his lost doctoral dissertation, claims that Kant, in virtue of making a numerical distinction between the subject and object of experience, cannot show how it is possible for them to stand in epistemic relations to each other, such as the subject perceiving and knowing the object. The same point is made by James: "Knowledge is impossible; for knower is one concept and known is another. Discrete, separated by a chasm, they are mutually 'transcendent' things, so that how an object can ever get into a subject, or a subject ever get at an object, has become the most unanswerable of philosophic riddles."19 Dewey adds that "the relation of subject and object is not a 'transcendent' one, but an 'immanent', and is but the first form which Reason manifests that it is both synthetic and analytic; that it separates itself from itself, that it may thereby reach higher unity with itself (EW1, 41). Two years later, in "The Psychological Standpoint", Dewey holds that there is an all-enveloping background Consciousness or Reason, which is Hegel's Absolute Idea, that "differentiates itself so as to give rise to the existence within, that is for, itself of subject and object... [Thus] the relation of subject and object is one which exists within consciousness" (EW1, 131).20 The Humpty Dumpty Intuition runs throughout the 1888 book on Leibniz's New Essays Concerning the Human Understanding?1 Dewey challenges the Cartesian dualism between mind and matter: Since "the conceptions are disparate and opposed... no interaction is possible" (EW1, 286) This is followed by Dewey's variation on Bradley's vicious infinite regress argument against relations. Introducing God as a Deus ex machina who connects mind and matter, "introduced a third factor where two were already too many. What is the relation of God to Mind and to Matter? Is it simply a third somewhat, equally distinct from both, or does it contain both within itself?" (EW1, 287). Dewey raises the same objection against Locke's separation of the subject and object of experience that he leveled against Kant. Because "it is tied to the view that reality is distinct from intelligence, it is obliged to draw the conclusion that these relations are not to be found in actual existence, and hence that all knowledge. . .is unreal" (EW1, 395). This Plotinian-Hegelian idea of the many "emanating" out of the One was retained long after he gave up Absolute Idealism. In a 1915 letter to Scudder Klyce he writes that "the 'one' is always pluralizing and recovering its diversities before they escape (or become plural) and thereby keeping itself going."22 In 1929 Dewey wrote that "To non-empirical method ...object and subject, mind and matter... are separate and independent. Therefore it has upon its hands the</page><page sequence="25">The Metaphysics of John Dewey 501 problem of how it is possible to know at all; how an outer world can affect an inner mind; how the acts of mind can reach out and lay hold of objects defined in antithesis to them. Naturally it is at a loss for an answer" (LW1, 20). "We have no ready-made distinction between the individual agent and the world of experience over against him... each is built up out of a common material by contemporaneous processes" (LW1, 21). One can recognize in these later, mature comments of Dewey the same Humpty Dumpty Intuition that informs his very early views.23 There is, however, at least one important apparent difference between the pre- and post-instrumentalist account of the background unity out of which apparent dualisms emanate. Whereas for the former it is Hegel's Absolute Mind or Consciousness, for the latter it is Experience.24 Some will see this as a desirable demystifying development, a movement away from an obscure mystical notion of an Absolute Mind to something that satisfies Dewey's denotative method or postulate of immediate empiricism, for certainly experience is something that we are experientially aware of. But appearances deceive, for it will turn out that Dewey's concept of experience is of a piece with that of his apparently abandoned concept of a Hegelian Absolute. The reason why no one ever understood what Dewey meant by "experience" is not because he was a poor writer, as is commonly claimed, but rather because he was formulating a mystical doctrine. My motto, to paraphrase Clinton's campaign slogan, is "It is the philosophy, stupid!" Actually, he was a very good writer, his prose style being perfectly suited for the mystical doctrine he was formulating, but his commentators, along with John Dewey himself, were unable to believe that he meant what he actually wrote. (The most difficult thing when doing the history of philosophy is to read just what the author actually wrote.) Dewey must share the blame for his failure to communicate, because he did not realize until too late that his account of experience was highly revisionary, hardly the descriptive analysis of our common sense concept that he advertised it as being. Dewey's attempt to placate common sense resulted in his using "experience" inconsistently, which is a further source ofobfuscation. Any exposition of Dewey's analysis of experience must begin with the fact that it contains apparent inconsistencies, the chief one of which is between an account of experience as limited in scope and one which takes it to be all- inclusive. According to the limited account, "No one with an honest respect for scientific conclusions can deny that experience as an existence is something that occurs only under highly specialized conditions, such as are found in a highly organized creature which in turn requires a specialized environment" (LW1, 11- 2). In his 1949 Re-Introduction to a planned new edition of Experience and Nature^ Dewey wrote that in this book he used "experience" "to stand for every actual and every possible way in which man... has dealings with all other aspects and phases of nature... 'Experience' is a word used to designate... the complex of all which is distinctively human" (LW1, 331). Plainly, in these two quotations</page><page sequence="26">502 Richard M. Gale Dewey is using "experience" in a non-inclusive way. Dewey endorses James's claim that experience is "double-barreled", including both the how and what of experience. The what is the intentional accusative and the how the experiencing or undergoing. This how is not something mentalistic or subjective, since it is amenable to a functionalistic analysis based on an organism's behavioral dispositions within a natural and social environment. But in the 1916 Introduction to Essays in Experimental Logic Dewey asserts that "When the word 'experience' is employed in the text it means just such an immense and operative world of diverse and interacting elements," which seems to make experience ubiquitous (MW10, 323. See also 339). For any case of an interaction constitutes an experience, not just the special case of an organism interacting with its environment. There are passages in Experience and Nature that clearly make experience all-inclusive, such as "Experience" denotes the planted field, the sowed seeds, the reaped harvests, the changes of night and day, spring and autumn, wet and dry, heat and cold, that are observed, feared, longed for; it also denotes the one who plants and reaps... It is "double-barreled" in that it recognizes in its primary integrity no division between act and material, subject and object, but contains them both in an unanalyzable totality. "Thing" and "thought"... are single-barreled; they refer to products discriminated by reflection out of primary experience. (LW1, 18-9) Dewey must be overstating the case when he says that experience is an "unanalyzató? totality"; for, if it were, it would not be possible for subsequent reflection to discriminate within it between thing and thought. In the first but not second edition of Experience and Nature^ Dewey raises what could be called the "significant contrast" objection to his all-inclusive sense of experience. The objection is that experience is... made so inclusive and varied as to be useless for philosophic purposes. Experience, as we are here told to conceive it, includes everything and anything, actual or potential, that we think of and talk about... But the whole wide universe of fact and dream, of event, act, desire, fancy and meanings, valid or invalid can be set in contrast to nothing... so that experience ceases to have a meaning. (LW1, 371 )25</page><page sequence="27">The Metaphysics of John Dewey 503 Dewey's response to this objection does not challenge the principle of significant contrast - that for every meaningful term there must be a meaningful contrastive term that applies to that which the former does not apply to. Rather, it holds that "experience for philosophy is method, not distinctive subject- matter" (LW1, 371). Herein Dewey is repeating the claim in his 1907 "Pure Experience and Reality: a Disclaimer" that "the concept of experience... [is] purely empty excepting as indicating a method of procedure and recourse" (MW4, 120. See also MW3, 165.). This response won't do, since it involves a category mistake: experience, whatever else it might be, certainly is not itself a method, anymore than a method of gardening is itself a case of gardening. A better way of meeting the objection is to challenge the principle of significant contrast. The principle seems to be based on a hasty generalization from what holds for the contrastive terms that are used for constructing hierarchical genus- species and determinable-determinate dassificatory systems. But why must all meaningful terms be contrastive? Might not some terms of necessity apply to whatever there is and thus not have a meaningful contrastive term, an example of which might be the property of being self-identical.26 Dewey's all-inclusive use of "experience" is supported by two different considerations, each of which rests on a confusion. First, there is his appeal in his 1906 "Experience and Objective Idealism" to the dictionary definition of "experience": "A casual study of the dictionary will reveal that experience has always meant 'what is experienced'" (MW3, 132). To be sure, one of the entries in the dictionary under "experience" is "anything observed or lived through; as, our trip was a pleasant experience." But when it is said, for example, that Niagara Falls was some experience, it is elliptical for our experiencing of it being specially memorable. This misguided appeal to the dictionary does not occur in any of Dewey's post- 1906 writings. Dewey's other ground for making experience ubiquitous is based on its intentionality, that it contains a what, an object of experience, as well as a how, a way of experiencing. Since we experience stars and chairs, and they are parts of experiences, it follows that they qualify as experience. This is how Dewey infers that "Experience denotes whatever is experienced" (LW1, 370). There is a serious category mistake in this argument that is due to its confounding being an object of an experience with being an experience. Dewey illicitly is making the intentional accusative of an experience itself an experience, which is like making the accusative of an act of shooting, a target say, itself an act of shooting. A similar confusion infects Dewey's claim in the 1886 "The Psychological Standpoint" that since psychology studies the process through which we know what we know, it also studies the content or object known, which is the intentional accusative of these processes, and thus is able "to determine the nature of everything, subject and object, individual and universal, as it is found within conscious experience" (EW1, 142). Late in his career Dewey carne to realize that his all-inclusive concept of</page><page sequence="28">504 Richard M. Gale experience was not the ordinary one, which is preempted for the how - the process of experiencing. To repeat a quotation that was given in Part I Were I to write (or rewrite) Experience and Nature today I would entitle the book Culture and Nature and the treatment of specific subject-matters would be correspondingly modified. I would abandon the term "experience" because of my growing realization that the historical obstacles which prevented understanding of my use of "experience" are, for all practical purposes, insurmountable... I still believe that on theoretical, as distinct from historical, grounds there is much to be said in favor of using "experience" to designate the inclusive subject-matter which characteristically "modern" (post- medieval) philosophy breaks up into the dualism of subject and object. (LW1, 361-2) Is there any way in which Dewey's limited and inclusivist accounts of experience can be reconciled? One way, and probably the best way, is to take them as analyzing different concepts. The limited account is concerned with the ordinary concept of experience, in which there already is a distinction between organism and environment and thus between a how and a what of experience, the inclusivist with a metaphysical all-pervasive background unity, called "immediate" or "primary experience" by Dewey, out of which emanates in some mysterious manner the hows and whats of ordinary experience. The former is "experience" with a lower case "e" and the latter "Experience" with an upper case "E." This is similar to Thales' two types of water - ordinary water, the stuff that is pumped from wells and drunk, and metaphysical water, the underlying phusis of all changes. There is a problem with this Milesian way of construing Dewey's concept of primary or immediate Experience. It has already been seen that Dewey attempted to escape a "subject-matter" or entitative interpretation of it by committing the category mistake of making it into a method of experience, a method of determining the nature of things in terms of what they are experienced as. Further evidence of Dewey's rejection of an entitative interpretation is seen in his objection to William James's concept of Pure Experience, which is a close cousin of Dewey's Immediate Experience, which is not surprising since Dewey developed his doctrine of Immediate Experience upon the heels of James's 1904-5 essays on radical empiricism. Whereas James's text suggests an entitative reading of Pure Experience as being something like the Milesian underlying stuff of reality,27 Dewey stresses that he does "not mean by 'immediate experience' any aboriginal stuff out of which things evolved, but I use the term to indicate the necessity of employing in philosophy the direct descriptive method" (MW3,</page><page sequence="29">The Metaphysics of John Dewey 505 166). This anti-Milesian remark is repeated in his 1940 "The Vanishing Subject in the Psychology of William James." James's notion of Pure or Neutral Experience means "indifference to the distinction between subjective and objective... Unfortunately his [James's] later writings seem at times to give the impression that these entities are a kind of stuff out of which both the subjective and objective are made" (LW14, 163). And in a 1942 letter to Bentley Dewey makes the same criticism: "James himself wasn't wholly clear - at times he seems to mix his neutrals with a kind of jelly-like cosmic world-stuff of pure experience."28 That Dewey explicitly rejected an entitative interpretation of Immediate Experience is not decisive, for, in general, an author does not have a privileged authority with regard to the proper interpretation of her text. And Dewey, in particular, is not the ultimate authority on how to interpret what he writes. Throughout his career Dewey was deeply and passionately committed to empiricism; and, as seen in Part I, his scientistic deconstruction of traditional philosophy was based on it. But throughout his career he was a secret arch a priorist in his actual practice as a philosopher. Neil Coughlan correctly claimed that "the really striking thing about Dewey's early empiricism is that there was so little of it."29 A good case in point is Dewey's postulation of a universal consciousness, to which Shadworth Hodgson objected in 1886 that "it is inconsistent with the claim of standing on experience alone to speak of 'the postulate of a universal consciousness'" (EW1, xxvi), to which Dewey gave the lame debater response that it was not his intention to explore the nature of this universal consciousness (EW1, 168). The response is lame, because it is obvious that an empirical account cannot be given of the nature of universal consciousness and its relation to finite consciousness. The post-Hegelian writings of Dewey, as was seen in Part I, are rife with nonempirical claims, such as that all existents are processual and involve a mixture of the stable and the precarious, and that the organism and environment are not numerically separate individuals. His claim that every meaningful sentence must be empirically testable is another case in point. Given his track record, Dewey's account of what he is doing should not be a conversation ender. To find out whether Immediate Experience is something like Thales's Water, we must not listen to what Dewey says it is but see what he does with it, what role it plays in his philosophy. Quotations can and will be given from Dewey's text that show that Immediate Experience is something like James's Pure Experience in that both are a type of prime matter that has the potentiality to become different determinate things, such as an organism and an environment. The main reason for the entitative interpretation is that in order for apparent distinctions, such as that between organism and environment, to emerge or emanate out of some background unity, there must be some sort of stuff or "matter" from which they emerge. For there to be the possibility of the emergence of apparently distinct objects there must be some actuality in which</page><page sequence="30">506 Richard M. Gale this possibility is grounded. Dewey's claim that "the moot problem of the relation of subject and object is the problem of what consequences follow in and for primary experience from the distinction of the physical and the psychological... from each other" postulates a "primary" or pure experience, James's "neutral" stuff, that is ontologically prior to both the subject and object (LW1,2O). Dewey, no more than Plotinus or Hegel, has any explanation of why the one becomes the many, but he does have a lot to say about the nature of the distinction between subject and object, organism and environment. Dewey's account bears a superficial resemblance to James's. Both are advertised as being functionally-based, but there is an important difference between their accounts with respect to the nature of the function. For James a piece of pure experience, which in itself is neither intrinsically physical nor intrinsically mental, becomes one or the other on the basis of how it functions within a temporal series of other events. If it is included within a temporal series of events that constitutes the history of a single mind in virtue of the later members of the series being able to remember the earlier ones, it qualifies as mental; but, if it is included in a temporal series the members of which stand in nomic relations to each other, it qualifies as physical. James, in spite of denying that any piece of pure experience is mental or physical simpliciter, does recognize a dualism between mental and physical temporal series of events. James's mental series of events is his version of the psychological continuity theories of personal identity over time offered by Locke and Hume. Dewey does not accept such a mental series of events, since he rejects the idea of a private or conscious history. He claims that if James's naturalism "had been consistently developed it would have resulted in a biological behavioristic account of psychological phenomena" (LW14, 158). This would have resulted in a functionalistic basis for distinguishing between the mental and the physical based exclusively on the manner in which an organism behaves or is disposed to behave in relation to its environment. As an example, Dewey considers a piece of immediate or pure experience, a smell. From a strictly empirical point of view, the smell which knows is no more merely mental than is the rose known. We may, if we please, say that the smell when involving conscious meaning or intention is 'mental', but this term 'mental' does not denote a separate type of existence - existence as a state of consciousness. It denotes only the fact that the smell, a real and non- psychical object now exercises an intellectual function. This new property involves, as James has pointed out, an additive relation - a new property possessed by a non-mental object, when that object, occurring in a</page><page sequence="31">The Metaphysics of John Dewey 507 new context, assumes a further office and use." (MW3, 123)30 To view an event as physical is, as James held, to see it as a member in a causally connected temporal sequence of events. But, Dewey departs from James in holding that this event qualifies as mental when it functions as a predictor or anticipator of the future. "Nothing but unfamiliarity stands in the way of thinking of both mind and matter as different characters of natural events, in which matter expresses their sequential order, and mind the order of their meanings in their logical connections and dependencies" (LW1, 66). Mind is minding, being attentive to the meaning of events in the sense of predicting their future consequences and taking the requisite steps to adjust one's behavior accordingly. So far it has been argued that the Humpty Dumpty Intuition informs Dewey's philosophy throughout, the only difference between the early and mature Dewey being in the name he gave to the background unity out of which apparent dualisms emanated in some functional manner, it being called the "Absolute Mind" by the early Dewey and "Experience" by the post-Hegelian Dewey. But in telling us that individuals that stand to each other in immediate relations are not numerically distinct from each other, the Humpty Dumpty Intuition does not tell us enough about just what sort of relation they have to each other. To determine the exact nature of this relation the Humpty Dumpty Intuition must be supplemented by three other fundamental tenets in Dewey's real metaphysics with which it works hand in glove, those being organism, internal relations, and continuity. Organism. The best place to dive into this interrelated triad of concepts is at the root metaphor of organism, which is another fundamental tenet that drove Dewey's philosophy throughout. In his Hegelian phase, Dewey, inspired by his undergraduate study of T.H. Huxley's Elements of Physiology, thought of the universe as an organic whole with God being the principle of the union of the ideal and the real. No doubt, Dewey's sense of the organic unity of the world also had roots in the Romantic poets, such as Wordsworth, who envisioned the world as an organic unity that manifested the infinite life of one great Spirit, which is yet another source for Dewey's belief in a background unity out of which the many emanate. Obviously, the claim that the universe is an organism is metaphorical; for, if it weren't, there would have to be, per impossible, an environment outside of the universe that contains and supports it. The challenge to the Dewey interpreter is to figure out just what is the literal content of the metaphor. It would seem to be that the parts of the universe are analogous to the organic parts of an organism: in each case these parts cannot exist separately from the whole that includes them. Just as a hand in isolation from an organism is not a hand, a part of the universe cannot be what it is if separated from the enveloping universe. And</page><page sequence="32">508 Richard M. Gale because each part of these two wholes cannot exist without its inclusion in that whole, each part cannot exist in separation from every other part. Internal Relations. The most difficult question for the Dewey interpreter to answer is whether this existential dependency is of a causal or conceptual sort. Is it, for example, only a contingent causal truth that an organism (environment) cannot exist without an environment (organism) or a necessary conceptual one? Maybe Dewey wanted it both ways, for, as Thomas Alexander suggests, "Dewey's desire was to fuse the biological and idealist understanding of organism."31 Unfortunately, Dewey can't have it both ways, so we must look carefully at the text to see which interpretation best fits it. It will be argued that it is the conceptual interpretation, since the root metaphor of organism ultimately gets cashed in terms of the idealist doctrine of internal relations, but, as was the case with experience, there are apparent inconsistencies in the text. Let us begin with the quotations that favor the contingent connection interpretation. Dewey stresses at many places that the relata in a relation must each have properties in addition to the relational property in question, otherwise the relation would collapse into itself because of a lack of relata. "Only if elements are more than just elements in a whole, only if they have something qualitatively their own, can a relational system be prevented from complete collapse" (LW1, 75). This point applies in particular to the relation between the knower and the known. "If objects are, in relation to the one who knows them, something else and other than things in a knowledge relation, there is somewhat to define and discuss; otherwise we are raising... the quite foolish question as to what is the relation of a relation to itself (MW6, 119). In order to stand in a relation an individual must possess some immediate, irreducible qualities of its own. "In every event there is something obdurate, self-sufficient, wholly immediate, neither a relation nor an element in a relational whole, but terminal and exclusive" (LW1, 74). Dewey goes on to add that these immediate qualities are ineffable, but this is a can of worms that will have to be left unopened in this paper. So far Dewey seems to grant each individual the logical or conceptual possibility of existing separately from other individuals in virtue of imputing to each of them possession of immediate or nonrelational properties. This is consistent with Dewey's inferentialist theory of meaning. Every term (meaning) is what it is in virtue of its membership in a proposition (its relation to another term), and every proposition in turn is what it is in virtue of its membership in either the set of ordered propositions that ground inference or in the series of propositions that constitute discourse. It follows from this position that the logical content and force of terms and propositions are ultimately determined by their</page><page sequence="33">The Metaphysics of John Dewey 509 place in the set of propositions found in either inference or discourse. Order is thus the fundamental logical category with respect to determination of the meaning of terms, directly in propositions and indirectly in sets and series of propositions. (LW12, 328)32 The meaning of a term is determined by all the propositions of which it can be a constituent and their entailment relations. But among these entailments are inferential ones based on contingent causal connections. The ontological counterpart of this semantic thesis is that it is logically possible for an individual to exist in isolation from other individuals. This has a realistic upshot when applied to the specific case of the relation between an organism and the natural world in which it is situated, for it permits the latter to exist independently of the former. "There is, of course, a natural world that exists independently of the organism, but this world is environment only as it enters directly and indirectly into life-functions" (LW12, 40). It would seem from this quotation that being an environment is not an essential property of nature, since nature can exist without being an environment for an organism. This realism would go with the restricted view of experience, according to which experience, far from being all-inclusive, occurs only when there is the proper sort of interaction between an organism and its environment. But Dewey goes on to say things that seem to support a contrary view that conceptually binds together related individuals, including the organism and its environment. The early Dewey clearly was committed to this view. "Whether we consider the relations of subject and object, or the nature of categories, we find ourselves forced into the presence of the notion of organic relation. The relation between subject and object is not an external one; it is one in a higher unity which is itself constituted by this relation" (EW1, 42). Our very quest for knowledge "presupposes that there is no such thing as an isolated fact in the universe, but that all are connected with each other as members of a common whole" (EW2, 201). But this conceptual tying together of individuals survives into the post-Hegelian Dewey. The following quotation from the 1927 "Half- Hearted Naturalism" begins with a reiteration of his intrinsic quality thesis, which gives each individual an independent existence, but then goes on to support the contrary conceptual interdependence thesis. "I hold that nature has both an irreducible brute unique 'itselfness' in everything which exists and also a connection of each thing (which is what ¿Ms) with other things such that without them it 'can neither be nor be conceived?" (LW3, 80, my italics). The italicized portion of this quotation denies that possession of unique nonrelational properties bestows independent existence. In Experience and Nature there seems to be retention of the early Hegelian organism thesis, with "primary experience" standing in for the absolutistic "higher unity".</page><page sequence="34">510 Richard M. Gale Let us inquire how the matter stands when these mental and psychical objects are looked at in their connection with experience in its primary and vital modes. As has been suggested, these objects are not original, isolated and self-sufficient. They represent the discriminated analysis of the process of experiencing from subject- matter experienced. Although breathing is in fact a function that includes both air and the operations of the lungs, we may detach the latter for study, even though we cannot separate it in fact. (LW1, 21) Notice that the dependency relation between lungs and air is rendered a mutual one by Dewey's claim that "these objects are not original, isolated and self- sufficient." Thus, it is not only the lungs that require air but the air that requires lungs. We must be careful to distinguish between de dicto and de re modal propositions. The de dicto proposition that it is necessary that an environment contains an organism is true, but this de dicto proposition does not entail the de re proposition that an environment necessarily or essentially contains an organism. It is necessarily true that a cyclist is two-legged but it is not true that a cyclist is necessarily or essentially two-legged, since a cyclist could survive the loss of her legs. And, likewise, food could continue to exist even if it ceased to be food because all the eaters of food became extinct. In contrast, an organism could not go on exiting if it ceased to be an organism. The doctrine of internal relations applies not only to the relation between subject and object of experience but also to the part whole relationship and the relation between successive events in Dewey's processual ontology. To be a whole is to be complete, finished; to be of seamless quality throughout. If parts are mentioned in connection with such a whole, nothing separable and removable is denoted. The most familiar instance of such "parts" are the organic members of a living body. If they are removed, they are no longer what they were as living "parts" of the living organism, while the latter is no longer a complete whole. (LW12, 203) A part of a whole is logically dependent for its very existence upon the other parts of the whole. "Since a 'part' is logically dependent as such in its existence and its properties, it is necessitated by other parts" (LW1, 59). In Part I it was seen that Dewey took being an event or processual to be one of the generic traits of every existent. Far from being vouchsafed by immediate experience, as he claimed, it is recommended by his underlying Humpty Dumpty Intuition. Like Bergson and James, Dewey found in process a unity of successive</page><page sequence="35">The Metaphysics of John Dewey 511 parts that are not numerically distinct from each other. (One wonders how they then could be temporally successive.) "Every event as such is passing into other things, in such a way that a later occurrence is an integral part of the character or nature of present existence" (LW1, 92). It would seem that an event's temporal relations to earlier and later events are internal to it - logically necessary conditions for its very existence.33 As Raymond Boisvert insightfully pointed out, for Dewey "an event has no existence outside of or prior to its varied transactions with other events."34 Judging by Dewey's remark that "in life that is truly life, everything overlaps and merges" (LW10, 34. My italics.), one wonders whether Dewey's claim that every event merges with its predecessors and successor is not a disguised normative claim as to how things ideally should be. That successive events are not numerically distinct from each other is at the basis of Dewey's famed attack in 1896 on the reflex arc concept in psychology, which represents his first presentation of experimentalism. The reflex arc violates the Humpty Dumpty Intuition because it makes the initial sensory experience and the successive ideating and motor response into numerically distinct events. Dewey replaces this model with one that has these three events interpenetrating each other in a way that denies their numerical distinctness. The reflex arc, as commonly employed, is defective in that it assumes sensory stimulus and motor response as distinct psychical existences... it still leaves us with sensation or peripheral stimulus; idea, or central process (the equivalent of attention); and motor response, or act, as three disconnected existences, having to be somehow adjusted to each other, whether through the intervention of an extra-experimental soul, or by mechanical push and pull. (EW5, 99-100. My italics.) The unannounced slide from being distinct to being disconnected implicitly appeals to the Humpty Dumpty Intuition, which denies that numerically distinct individuals can be connected by any nonmediated relation. Dewey goes on to add that "the stimulus and response are not distinctions of existence, but ideological distinctions, that is, distinctions of function, or part played, with reference to reaching or maintaining an end" (EW5, 104). Dewey is assuming, as he did when he attempted to unearth the generic traits of existence, that man is always inquiring, always engaged in attempting to transform some indeterminate situation into a determinate one. Dewey seems to have painted himself into a corner. For, on the one hand, he denies that the relata in an immediate relation are numerically distinct from each other; but, on the other hand, he distinguishes between them, even allowing each of them to have its own unique "itselfness". William James was led to a similar position by his Humpty Dumpty Intuition in which he claimed that the</page><page sequence="36">512 Richard M. Gale relata were "identical" with each other but not in a way that satisfies transitivity, thus allowing x to be identical with ;y, and y identical with 2, but x not be identical with z. Dewey even explicitly deployed James's funny kind of nontransitive "identity" to explain how the members of a society can be unified without losing their own identity. Immediately conjoined neighbors, be it in a society or in space and time, interpenetrate and melt into each other, but without losing their own identity, as is seen by the fact that this melting is not transitive. These relations of "confluence" can unify a society, because, even if two persons are not directly connected by such a relation, they are indirectly connected by a chain of such relations (LW15, 5-6). This relation of nontransitive identity is a very difficult one. It is a close cousin of, if not identical with, the sort of identity espoused by dualistic mysticism, as contrasted with the numerical identity of monistic mysticism. James, in agreement with Bergson, thought that the only way to grasp it is by having pure nonconceptual intuition of individuals melting into each other or fusing together, as they do when they enter into causal and spatiotemporal relations with each other. Dewey eschewed such experiential mysticism in support of his Humpty Dumpty Intuition, no doubt because throughout his career he treated mystical experiences as noncognitive and therefore not being revelatory of any traits of existence (LW1, 376-7. LW4, 188. LW9, 9-11, 25-7, 35. LW15, 118, 122). Dewey asserts the Humpty Dumpty Intuition as if it were self-evident and thus not in need of support. He fails to realize that this Intuition recommends itself only to someone with a heightened mystical sensitivity and yearning, someone just like himself. Cut off from its roots in mystical experiences and intuitions, the Humpty Dumpty Intuition has nothing to recommend it over its rival Humean Intuition which holds that existents are connected together only by contingent external relations. The Principle of Continuity. Dewey's Principle of Continuity is the third member of the triumvirate of inter-connected concepts that also include organism and internal relations. It gives further evidence of the mystical basis of Dewey's Humpty Dumpty Intuition. The Principle is employed as a magical solvent that can dissolve all "dualisms", in particular those between subject and object, mind and body, fact and value, the natural and the social, as well as fine and utilitarian art. It is supposed to accomplish these wonders by showing how higher forms of existence evolve in a continuous way out of lower ones. The Principle of Continuity will be shown to be another name for the fact that every existent is processual in Dewey's Humpty Dumpty sense, the sense in which "every event as such is passing into other things, in such a way that a later occurrence is an integral part of the character or nature of present existence" (LW1,92).35 Given the centrality of the Principle of Continuity, it is surprising that Dewey says almost nothing explicitly about it, instead confining himself to giving examples of it. This is the only attempt he made to define or analyze the</page><page sequence="37">The Metaphysics of John Dewey 513 Principle. The idea of continuity is not self-explanatory. But its meaning excludes complete rupture on one side and mere repetition of identities on the other; it precludes complete breaks and gaps. The growth and development of any living organism from seed to maturity illustrates the meaning of continuity. . .What is excluded by the postulate of continuity is the appearance upon the scene of a totally new outside force as a cause of changes that occur. (LW12, 30-1) This brief passage raises some troubling questions. The first two sentences speak to the Bergson- James processual nature of change, but what comes after the "What is excluded" adds something new to this that has puzzled commentators.36 Is Dewey requiring that evolutionary development occur in a spatiotemporally continuous rather than discrete manner? Hopefully not, for this is not the sort of issue that can be decided a priori. Yet another interpretive puzzle concerns whether Dewey is requiring that all explanations, however complex their explananda might be, employ the same concepts. If so, the result is either reductive materialism or panpsychism. The former results from a bottom-up interpretation of the Principle of Continuity and the latter from a top-down one. Certainly, Dewey did not want a bottom-up interpretation. The specter of reductive materialism, in which biological, psychological and social explanations employ the same explanatory concepts as physics does, could be avoided by appeal to Dewey's "outside force" qualification in order to show that his intent was only to proscribe appeal to nonnatural or supernatural explanatory causes. But did Dewey want a top-down interpretation in which the explanatory concepts that are employed at the most complex level apply also to the less developed ones, thereby winding up in panpsychism? The following passages give some indication that he did. The roots of the top-down interpretation can be seen in Dewey's first published essay, "Metaphysical Assumptions of Materialism," in which it is claimed that unless mind is implicitly present in matter it is impossible to explain how mind could emerge from matter (EW1, 3-8). Herein Dewey is appealing to the scholastic principle that there must be as much reality in the cause as in the effect. This requires that the effect must be contained in the cause, if not actually then implicitly. This principle undergirds Dewey's view that universe is an organic whole and must be explained at every level of its development in terms of organic concepts. It was this that attracted him to Leibniz, who according to Dewey, held that The universe is an organic whole. Its activity is the</page><page sequence="38">514 Richard M. Gale manifestation of Life, - nay, it is Life. The laws of its activity reveal that continuity of development, that harmony of inter-relation, which are everywhere the marks of Life. The final and fundamental notion, therefore, by which Leibniz interprets the laws of physics and mathematics is that of Life. (EW1, 282-3) The same sort of panpsychism is found in the mature writing of Dewey. In Part I it was shown that Dewey's generic traits of all existents are inquiry-related ones. Every existent is to be understood in terms of what bearing it has on inquiry. Plants and non-human animals act as if they were concerned that their activity, their characteristic receptivity and response, should maintain itself. Even atoms and molecules show a selective bias in the indifFerencies, affinities and repulsions when exposed to other events. With respect to some things they are hungry to the point of greediness; in the presence of others they are sluggish and cold. (LW1, 162) In the 1929 The Quest of Certainty it is written that "indirectly, purpose is a legitimate and necessary idea in describing Nature itself in the large. For man is continuous with nature" (LW4, 196). And "Preferential activities characterize every individual" (LW4, 200). And in the 1940 "Time and Individuality" Dewey holds that As human individuality can be understood only in terms of time as fundamental reality, so for physical individuals time is not simply a measure of predetermined changes in mutual positions, but is something that enters into their beings... the principle of developing career applies to all things in nature, as well as to human beings. (LW14, 107-8) In part I consideration was given to the interpretations of Thomas Alexander and Tom Burke who maintained that even nonconscious individuals perform inquiries of a sort - proto-inquiries. Their interpretations depend upon a top-down use of the Principle of Continuity. The Principle of Continuity in both its top-down and bottom-up interpretations requires that every change be of a Bergson- James processual sort, and it is this requirement that is supposed to dissolve vicious dualisms. In 1888 Dewey praises Leibniz for showing that problems concerning the relation</page><page sequence="39">The Metaphysics of John Dewey 515 between subject and object, "which seem insoluble, arise when we insist upon erecting into actual separations or differences of kind what really are only stages of development or differences of degree" (EW1, 317). Both mechanistic and spiritualistic metaphysics commit the cardinal sin of creating a breach in the continuity of historic process; the gulf created has then to be bridged by an emission or transfer of force... the notion of growth makes it easy... to detect the fallacy residing in both views: namely, the breaking up of a continuity of historical change into two separate parts, together with the necessity which follows from the breaking-in-two for some device by which to bring them together again. (LW1, 209-10) The trick is to prevent Humpty Dumpty from falling by refusing to make numerical distinctions between successive phases in a process of growth or development. As was the case for Dewey's reflex circuit, successive events must be seen as merging and melting together. The Principle of Continuity, thus, turns out to be the Humpty Dumpty Intuition. Conclusion Dewey's real, as opposed to his professed, metaphysics is based on four interconnected principles - the Humpty Dumpty Intuition, organism, internal relations, and the Principle of Continuity. In spite of his deprecation of philosophical systems,37 Dewey's philosophy has a tight systematic unity. It begins with the Humpty Dumpty Intuition, which holds that apparently numerically distinct individuals emanate out of some kind of a background unity - the Absolute or Experience. Distinctions between them are functionally or organically based in a way that renders their relations to each other internal or essential to each of them. Furthermore, they are connected by a continuous process or field that renders it impossible to numerically distinguish between them. The result, as Steven Rockefeller so well put it, is that for Dewey "the individual is interconnected in an infinite number of ways with the larger whole and the whole is present in and with the individual... dynamic continuities [replace] hard and fast dualism."38 What are we to make of the dramatic clash between Dewey's real metaphysics and his scientistically-based deconstructionist metaphilosophy? Which one is the bad Dewey? Whereas Rorty runs with Dewey's deconstructionism and accordingly chides him for occasionally giving in to the temptation to do traditional metaphysics, I deplore the cultural barbarism of his deconstructionism and applaud his attempt to become the Plotinus of Burlington, Vermont.

This is a self-serving distorted account of James, since prime examples of will-to-believe cases for James were ones in which a person needed to believe some proposition so as to build up her confidence or courage. Furthermore, only something that has cognitive meaning can be an object of a wili-to-belicve option, since one cannot believe what is meaningless. 4. In his 1915 "The Subject-Matter of Metaphysical Inquiry," Dewey claimed that metaphysics seeks the "ultimate" and "irreducible" traits of existence (MW8, 4). These traits, however, must be carefully distinguished from the generic traits of existence, since a trait could be ultimate or irreducible, such as being pink, without, being generic in the sense of being common to all existents. Maybe yellow would be a generic trait if the Pink Panther were the creator of the universe. 5. R.W. Sleeper made out a very good case for the thesis that Dewey had a metaphysics of existence, not just of experience. He also saw that Dewey's generic traits of existence are derived from our concept of inquiry. "Inquiry itself... shapes our concept of 'being', and not our concept of 'being' that should be allowed to shape our theory of inquiry." The Necessity of Pragmatism (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1986), p. 61. 6. Dewey is not consistent on this issue. On the one hand he says that "No one with an honest respect for scientific conclusions can deny that experience as an existence is something that occurs only under highly specialized conditions, such as are found in a highly organized creature which in turn requires a specialized environment" (LW1, 11-2). But in apparent opposition to this view of experience as limited arc many claims that make experience ubiquitous, as is seen in the following quotations. "Experience. . .includes everything and anything, actual or potential, that we think of and talk about" (LW1, 371). "We mean then by experience something at least as wide and deep and full as all history on this earth" (LW1, 370). "'Experience' denotes the planted field, the sowed seeds, autumn, wet and dry, heat and cold, that are observed,</page><page sequence="41">The Metaphysics of John Dewey 517 feared, longed for" (LW1, 18). "Experience has its equivalents in such affairs as history, life, culture" (LW1, 42). I have some ideas how to resolve this tension in the text but cannot do so now. 7.

There are problems, however, with Dewey's claim that the social is the most inclusive category. Taken extensionally, this claim seems false, since the universe contains more individuals than does a society. Taken intensionally, it again seems false, for an analysis of the concept of a society or culture does not bring in galaxies, nor does the analysis of the concept of the universe bring in societies. That Dewey never developed his idea of the most inclusive philosophic category probably is due to his realization of these problems. 12. Thomas Alexander realized this when he wrote that "the generic traits will attempt to reveal to inquiry its contextual origin and its moral obligation... Dewey seeks here what might be called a transcendental or hermeneutic exploration of reflective experience." Op. cit., p. 91. 13. Steven C. Rockefeller, who does a far better job than any other commentator in telling the story of Dewey's quest for unity, astutely pointed out that "under the impact of Vermont culture [Dewey] experienced painful feelings of being isolated and inwardly divided and that as a result he was possessed by an intense emotional craving for unification." John Dewey: Religious Faith and Democratic Humanism (New York: Columbia University Press, 1991), p. 42. 14. Another reason that his intellectual craving for unification could not be achieved by mystical experiences is that he argued strenuously against their counting as cognitive. See especially LW1, 376-7, LW4, 188, LW9, 26, LW11, 85, LW15, 118-9 and 122. Here he is in complete agreement with Bertrand Russell who accorded mystical experiences value as emotional feelings but denied that they are evidence for the existence of any reality that transcends themselves. 15.

Rather, as these quotations show, it is the knowable subject and object of experience that arise or emanate out of single unknowable background unity. 21. EW1.

My attempt to interpret Dewey as the Plotinus of Burlington, Vermont, would be rejected by at least one very able Dewey interpreter, John Tiles. He writes that "the Plotinian temptation to assert unity as both ground and goal is not one to which Dewey succumbs. In the speech he delivered to Parisian philosophers, he asserted, characteristically, that morality cannot be reduced to any single guiding principle selected as ultimate by moral philosophers: the culmination of natural desires, the demands of duty, or the dialectic of sympathy and antipathy. There are, as Dewey put it, 'three independent factors in morals' not three competitors for the one ultimate principle". John Dewey: Rethinking Our Time, (Albany: State University of New York Press, 1988), p. 6. There are two things wrong here. First, Plotinus' monism is a metaphysical, not an ethical thesis. Second, Dewey clearly advanced growth as his summum bonum, which was defined as a self s achievement of every higher order unification. Tiles goes on to claim that Dewey, unlike Plotinus, "admits the irreducibility of pluralism and sets harmony, not unity, as the appropriate human ideal" (p. 10). This claim flies in the face of Dewey's repeated use of "unity" in presenting his metaphysical and ethical theories. Whereas both Dewey and Plotinus see the empirical many as emanating out of the One, they differ with respect to the status of the many. Dewey, unlike traditional monistic mystics, does not claim that the experiential many are illusory, but he does say that they are not numerically distinct from each other. Furthermore, the post-Hegelian Dewey does not hold that the many flow back into the primordial One. Rather, it is up to us to operate as Promethean agents upon the many so as to create unification between them, but it is a new type of unity and there is no prior assurance that we shall succeed in this endeavor, this being an expression of Dewey's meliorism. 24. I am in full agreement with John Shook's claim that the "Universal Mind was replaced in Dewey's philosophy not by nature, but by experienced nature." Dewey's Empirical Theory of Knowledge and Reality, (Nashville: Vanderbilt University Press, 2000), p. 19. Herein Shook is opposing Lewis Hahn's interpretation that has "The Universal Consciousness or Mind. . .replaced by nature." "Dewey's Philosophy and Philosophic Method" in Guide to the Works of John Dewey, Jo Ann Boydston (ed.), (Carbondale: Southern Illinois University Press, 1970), p. 26. 25. In the same vein, Sidney Hook, in his The Quest for Being and Other Studies in Naturalism and Humanism, (New York: St. Martin's Press, 1961), p. 147, argues that Being is a meaningless term, since it fails to satisfy the significant contrast principle, this being due to its contrastive term, Non-Being, being meaningless. 26. Maybe Dewey did not repeat the significant contrast objection in the Second Edition, because he came to doubt the principle. I present arguments against this principle in my "Hook's Views on Metaphysics", in Sidney Hook and the Contemporary World, Paul Kurtz (ed.), (New York: John Day Co., 1968), pp. 311-16. 27.

Dewey 's rejection of intrinsically mental events or states of consciousness is inconsistent with the 1945 article, "Are Naturalists Materialists?," which he co-authored with Ernest Nagel and Sidney Hook (LW15, 109-26). Herein an epiphenomenalist theory is espoused that accepts an ontological distinction between mental and physical events but denies the former any causal efficacy. Except for the opening paragraph, Dewey had little to do with the writing of it, Nagel being the principal author. Why did Dewey agree to attach his name to the essay? Was it that he wanted to lend support to his two leading disciples in meeting objections from a common foe, Sheldon? Or was it creeping senility that kept him from seeing the inconsistency between it and his earlier writings? 31.

Roughly: understanding a sentence means understanding a language." The Blue and Brown Books, (Oxford: Blackwell, 1960), p. 5. 33. Yet another example of Dewey's doctrine of internal relations is his account of the relation between propositions in an argument. In claiming that "a 'conclusion' is no separate and independent thing" (LW10, 45), Dewey is making the property of being a conclusion an essential property of the proposition in question. 34.

In some of its employments it concerns the impossibility of sharply separating an organism and its environment, as well as other individuals that are closely conjoined in space. There is a brilliant treatment of this in Tom Burke's important book, Dewey's New Logic, (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1994), pp. 37ff. 36. See in particular Ernest Nagel's introduction to Logic: The Theory of Inquiry (LW1, xiv). 37.
