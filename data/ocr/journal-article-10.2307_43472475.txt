<plain_text><page sequence="1">JOSHUA HARMON Live Free (Or Die Trying) I: Secession On November 17th, 2004, a letter to the editor in The Boston Globe noted that "[i]t has been 15 days since the election and still the Globe continues to print Bush-bashing letters and opinion ar- ticles. The election is over. Accept it. If you believe that President Bush is the wrong person to lead this country, that's your privilege. . . . What good can come of all the whining and threats of moving to Canada?" Another letter - accompanied by an illustration of an anthropomorphic donkey, suitcases packed, thumb raised, Canadian flag in hand - urged those " disaffected" by the recent election or "ashamed of this country" to "stay and fight." As has been well documented, the fantasy of flight took on a vast appeal in the election's immediate aftermath. The day after the elec- tion, The New York Times reported, the Citizenship and Immigra- tion Canada Web site received "115,000 hits coming from Canada's neighbor to the south" - just a slight increase over the usual "20,000 . . . daily visits . . . from the United States." A JPEG map contrasting the "United States of Canada" and "Jesusland," forward- ed around the internet, revived the spirit of Maira Kaiman and Rick Meyerowitz's 2001 New Yorker cover "New Yorkistan." This Magazine's satirical Web site "Marry an American" - noting that "lonely, afraid (did we mention really hot?) progressives will need a safe haven" - featured fake personal ads of Canadians seeking Ameri- cans. A New Mexico T-shirt company offered a "Going Canadian" package: "For $24.95 you get a complete disguise," namely a Cana- dian flag T-shirt, backpack patch, and a guidebook called "How to Speak Canadian, Eh?" And, in its "Year in Ideas" issue, The New York Times Magazine included an entry on "Neo-Secessionism": "These days, in the wake of George W. Bush's re-election, talk of secession is once again whipping through the New England states."</page><page sequence="2">504 / Southwest Review Not long after Kerry had conceded Ohio, I scrutinized the red-and- blue state maps. Though I had anticipated that New Hampshire would vote in line with the rest of New England this year, I was still sur- prised to see that, in the electoral map of New Hampshire printed in the Globe's online edition, the Granite State's northernmost county, Coos, was colored blue. Coos County, and particularly its northern- most town, Pittsburg, is a place that, for a flatlander and a Mass-hole, I know well: my grandmother was born and raised there, I spent parts of many summers there as a boy, and I've written a novel set in a barely fictional version of the town. Were New Hampshire to "flip" from red in 2000 to blue in 2004, I'd thought, the southern part of the state, to which many Massachusetts residents have emigrated, would be the reason - and yet, the southern and eastern counties of the state were colored red. Robert David Sullivan - in his Commonwealth magazine article, "Beyond Red and Blue," which posits ten affiliated voting blocs rather than the simple blue/red dichotomy - describes New Hampshire as a "libertarian stronghold" and includes it in his "Sagebrush" region; in Sullivan's view, New Hampshire is politically similar to such states as Alaska, Montana, Idaho, and Wyoming. In 1832, in what is now Pittsburg, approximately three hundred inhabitants (including fifty-nine men of voting age) did what many blue-state residents have at least jokingly considered doing since November 2, 2004: by a fifty-six to three vote, they formed their own independent nation ("The Republic of Indian Stream") and seceded from the United States. This was not a matter of Blue and Red (or of Blue and Gray), but a result of post- War of 1812 confusion over the border between the United States and Canada and competing land speculators (settlers had been granted land by rival developers over a thirty-year period, yet due to the boundary dispute had not received titles), as well as, for some residents, a chance to escape debt. The vote also reflected the proud self-sufficiency of these families, who had within a decade or two built a town, roads, bridges, a school- house, and a mill out of a remote wilderness. In his engaging history of the settlement, Indian Stream Republic, Daniel Doan notes that in the newly-created Indian Stream existed a "sharp cleavage . . . between solid citizens and those less inclined to social order because they had less at stake," though before long "support of New Hampshire or Canada became the opposite poles." This latter conflict eventually</page><page sequence="3">Harmon /505 precipitated the end of the Indian Stream Republic. Sparked by a se- ries of retaliatory cross-border arrests by Canadian and American officials determined to assert their nation's claims to the territory, a rum-drunk mob - some armed with pistols or muskets, bayonets or swords, others throwing scavenged stones - captured a Canadian magistrate. The governor of New Hampshire, fearing an international incident, sent a militia to the settlement to restore order. After a stalemate of several years, newly-appointed Secretary of State Daniel Webster and British plenipotentiary Lord Ashburton negotiated a treaty, and the town of Pittsburg, named - as is the other, better- known Pittsburgh - for eighteenth-century British statesman William Pitt the Elder, was incorporated. Another secession movement, unconnected to Bush and Kerry, is now afoot in New Hampshire. The Free State Project (fsp), founded by recent Yale Political Science ph.d. Jason Sorens, aims to entice twenty thousand libertarians and like-minded voters to move to the Granite State, which was chosen as the best option (over such states as - again - Alaska, Idaho, Montana, and Wyoming) due to, accord- ing to current fsp President Amanda Phillips (in an interview with my hometown am radio station, worc), the "high degree of personal freedom . . . evidenced by the lack of helmet laws . . . you can choose whether or not you want to wear a helmet. New Hampshire has no adult seatbelt laws." Of course, the absence of state income and sales taxes doesn't hurt, either. Sorens's original article "Announcement: The Free State Project/' published July 23, 2001, in The Libertarian Enterprise, proposed that freedom-minded people of all stripes (libertarians, anarcho-capi- talists, pacifists, even people who just call themselves liberals or conservatives . . . ) establish residence in a small state and take over the state government. . . . Once we've taken over the state government, we can slash state and local budgets, which make up a sizeable proportion of the tax and regulatory burden we face every day. Furthermore, we can eliminate substantial federal in- terference by refusing to take highway funds and the strings at- tached to them. Once we've accomplished these things, we can bargain with the national government over reducing the role of the national government in our state. We can use the threat of secession as leverage to do this.</page><page sequence="4">$o6 / Southwest Review Though Sorens has since retreated publicly from what he calls his original overemphasis on "the possibility of secession/' one of the "New Hampshire Reports" published on the fsp's Web site seems excited about such a prospect. "The importance of [New Hampshire's] coastal and international access cannot be understated. If secession were to become an issue, coastal and international borders would be critical," its author points out. And even if a literal separatism is no longer implied in the fsp literature, certainly the fsp promotes an ideological secession from the United States. I don't believe that The Indian Stream Republic served as a model for the Free State Project, though I imagine Sorens and his followers would find the historical precedent interesting. I've often wondered how this early experiment in self-government has framed the local experience. Much has been made of the growing disparity between haves and have-nots in our country, but does this disparity still "cleave" northern New Hampshire - a region about which my great uncle Merrill, a career navy man who has now retired to his home- town, remarks that "the economy is pretty depressed here,- the Ethan Allen factory in Beecher Falls and tourism are about it for jobs"? And what caused these northern voters - who are, in general, rural, not affluent (the county's median household income is $33,593, and ten per cent of the population is below the poverty line), skeptical of the environmental movement, anti-tax, as well as over ninety-eight precent white: all factors, one might assume, that would have pre- disposed them to vote for George W. Bush - to cast their support for John Kerry? Why did this famously Republican state shift its alle- giance in a year when the rest of the country - at least as the results in the so-called swing states suggest - tilted slightly to the right? I currently live in Dutchess County, New York, an easy ride into Grand Central on MetroNorth - just the sort of outrageously-taxed, café- and independent cinema-filled place one might think of as quintessential^ "blue." In the local towns are day spas, health food stores, sushi bars, expensive wine shops, and million-dollar houses with Hummers in the driveway and horse barns out back. And yet this year Dutchess County was colored red on the electoral map. If the now-infamous "moral values" listed as an option in the exit- polls have become the mythic narrative that defined the vote for many commentators, why was Dutchess red? And why, even if by a mere</page><page sequence="5">Harmon / 5 07 442 votes, or two-and-a-half percent - statistically, about double the gap between Kerry and Bush statewide - was Coos blue? II: On the Phone with the President's Cousin I begin seeking answers to such questions by Googling the Republican Committee of Coos County. The only Web site I find is registered to a Lancaster resident and Committee member named Ed Sanders, and promotes various links beyond those of the local Republican Committee (which Sanders is hosting only until they find a more permanent cyber-home). Sanders's Web site is a compre- hensive chronicle of his interests, activities, and beliefs - " Scroll down, there's a LOT here!" advises a banner at the top of the main Web page. Links include the brand of synthetic oil he sells; various pages about his Unimog (a 4x4 truck made by Mercedes from 1955- 1980) hobby,- tourism information about the "Great North Woods"; recipes for maple syrup donuts and his grandmother's coconut-filled chocolate cookies,- "phonics" books from the 1840s he's scanning; books he's selling; instructions on how to implement and use "Sanders' Filing System"; ideas about "healing yourself" using "vitamins, minerals, foods and supplements"; a photo gallery of Guam's 1976 typhoon, Pamela,- a photo essay about "pesky neigh- bors"; another photo essay about clear-cutting ("When you look close up at the results of a clear cut, it's really beautiful, isn't it?"),- and, of particular interest to me, several pages of poetry, including one of his own compositions, titled "Poetry Is Back." In this poem, Sanders celebrates cbs News Sunday Morning anchor Charles Osgood's rhymed narratives ("news that you can use"), Jesse Jackson's preach- ing, cowboy poetry, and rap as evidence that "poetry is back": "These strange bedfellows / use verse and rhyme, / to preach their politics / and enjoy a good time // They save for society / and for all time, / poems with proper meter / and rhymes that really rhyme." Then, as if observing a sonnet's volta, the poem shifts from a celebration of diversity to a critique of another sort of poet: All the while they work and write and speak,</page><page sequence="6">$o8 / Southwest Review the properly "educated" poets write poems that truly reek! Without any attention to meter or proper time, they write and recite poems that don't even rhyme. They gaze over their upraised noses to us rabble far below, writing verse that makes no sense except to their friends in the know. Many of these self appointed poets who can't even make a poem rhyme, suckle from nea grants, writing poems that only whine. I want to speak to Sanders - I feel certain that, as a Republican Committee member and as an example of the New Hampshire en- trepreneurial spirit, he'll have definite opinions about the election - but, a current nea fellow, I decide to keep my "suckling" to myself when I contact him by e-mail. The next day, we talk on the tele- phone. Sanders has been up all night at work, and, by ten-thirty on a Saturday morning, is getting ready for bed. His voice - rich, deep, with the distinctive tones and accent of northern New England; he grew up in Vermont, he tells me, but has lived in Lancaster for years - would be almost perfectly suited to reading poetry, in fact, but I don't want to talk verse. I ask if he thinks the voters up north were swayed by the idea of one candidate's "moral values." Not really. ā'' don't know that the churches did get out the vote," he says. "We have a few churches where if you don't belong to the right Baptist church you're going to hell sort of thing. But most of us on the Republican Committee aren't real religious people. There were only two religious nuts showing up at the meetings. . . . Most of us are more on the libertarian side of things. We could care less about gay rights, what two consenting adults do in their own home. If some- one wants to smoke pot, who cares? Just don't take away our guns, and let us use our 4X4's to have a good time." "Live free or die?" I suggest.</page><page sequence="7">Harmon /509 "Sure," he says. Still, he's not entirely willing to look the other way - the local Episcopal Church is a "scourge," he tells me, citing the parishioners' weekly "drum-ins" to oppose the Iraq invasion. "I'm anti-drum-in," he says. "Bunch of kooks." So why did Coos vote for Kerry, in his opinion? "Union propaganda," he claims, from the blue-collar mill towns Berlin, Gorham, and Northumberland. But Sanders seems most concerned about "immigrants" from places like "New York, New Jersey, Massachusetts." He attributes some of the Kerry vote to "recent transplants, especially around Randolph." "Why Randolph?" I ask. "I have no idea," he says. "People want a secure place to bug out to up north," he speculates. Sanders, a Vietnam-era veteran, seems shocked that anyone could even consider voting for Kerry: "Kerry should have been shot as a traitor thirty years ago for aiding and abetting the enemy. In any previous war, he would have been shot. ... In any war, there's an occasional atrocity." To change the subject, I inquire about a photo posted on his Web site that shows him shaking hands with George W. Bush; in the photo, the President has a towel slung over his shoulder and wears an inside- out T-shirt and a tired smile. The caption reads "Ed Sanders with cousin (and President) George Bush in Gorham, New Hampshire dur- ing the Primary. W. is headed off to the gym after speaking, answering questions and greeting folks." "Are you really cousins?" I want to know. "Oh, sure," Sanders says. "How far removed?" "I'm right in front of the computer," he says, and, while I wait, he types some information into his genealogy software to determine the precise relationship: "Eleventh cousin, once removed." When Sanders finds out that I can trace ancestors through both my mother's and father's families to pre-Revolutionary New England, he suggests that I too am probably related to the President. "The media calls the Kennedys American royalty," he says, "but they're just second- generation Irish carpetbaggers. The Bushes have been here since the Mayflower."</page><page sequence="8">Sio / Southwest Review III: North A week before Thanksgiving, I set off on a journey that will lead me to within spitting distance of the Canadian border, though not across it. When I tell my grandmother - the one born in Pittsburg - of my plan to ask people in Coos County about the election, she laughs long. "Well I'm not going with you/7 she says. "I'd like to walk on two legs and not have one of them broken! Anyway, you probably won't be able to print the responses because every third word will be a curse: 'I wouldn't vote for that lying son of a bastard!7" Another family member advises me to ask my great uncle Merrill: "He'll tell you: it's all the assholes moving up from Massachusetts." Ed Sanders's comments aside, I have few preconceptions about the reasons that guided northern New Hampshire voters in their deci- sions, and no interest in writing a postmortem on the election, but only an abundant curiosity about this place for which I feel a certain affinity despite the fact that I do not really understand it. In some sense I am of it, and yet my grandmother fled the north woods for Boston after graduating from Pittsburg High School, a decision she once explained to me with the line "I wasn't going to be a farmer's wife!" Merrill, her younger brother, left soon after his eighteenth birthday to enlist in the navy; only her sister remained in town, and lives there still. It is a place I have always felt outside of, despite my own conflicted wishes, even during those boyhood visits when I was captivated by the sign at the center of Pittsburg village explaining the town's history in a sentence, or the dark spruce-rimmed lakes in which the Connecticut River rises, or the wooded hills and valleys that surround them. I drive along the Spalding Turnpike and Rt. 16 north toward the mountains. The road leads through sandy-soiled pine woods along the eastern border of New Hampshire, under the shadows of the White Mountains and, eventually, through them at Pinkham Notch. The only times I've taken this road I was with or on my way to visit an ex-girlfriend who grew up in North Conway,- when she was in the car with me, she'd point out the invisible-to-me landmarks of her life, such as Twombley's drive-in restaurant (now gone), and tell me the</page><page sequence="9">Harmon /511 local legend about Mount Chocorua as we passed its sharp peak. Now, the only roadside signs I can recognize along this route are the left- over wind-bent lawn banners for Bush/Cheney or Kerry/Edwards. Sprinkled among these markers are occasional exhortations - "GO SOX" - commemorating the other contest that has gripped the re- gion in recent weeks. In Tamworth, I stop at a new roadside Dunkin7 Donuts. The gray- haired man ahead of me in line wears a denim jacket decorated with patches. The largest, spanning the center of the man's back from shoulder blade to shoulder blade, reads Freedom Isn't Free. Another bears a caricature of John Kerry in a military helmet and the legend: Stop Hanoi John 2004. The man orders a number five (bacon, egg, and cheese on a bagel, plus a coffee), then goes out to an idling black pickup truck decorated with a Bush/Cheney bumper sticker, a pow/ mia black magnetic ribbon, and a yellow magnetic ribbon. A Boston terrier peeks from the side window as he pulls out of the parking lot. Carroll County, in which Tamworth is located, voted for Bush in 2004, one of four counties in the state to do so. Because of New Hampshire voters7 reputation as contrarians, not to mention their sometime suspicion of visitors from their southern neighbor, I don't believe that Kerry's status as senator from next-door Massachusetts had much to do with the vote. The fact that Bush won in Hillsborough and Rockingham counties, those closest to Massachusetts, and from which many people commute to work in Boston or along the 1-495 and Rt. 128 beltways, suggests that a sympathy for the Bay State did not necessarily help Kerry. I park in downtown North Conway and stroll a few blocks of Main Street to find a café, where I order a grilled vegetable sandwich and a hot cider. But North Conway has always existed primarily as a resort town for tourists - ever since Harvey Dow Gibson rescued renowned ski instructor Hannes Schneider from a Nazi prison camp in 1937 and brought him to teach wealthy visitors to the Mount Washington valley - and the town's espresso bars and high-end outlet shops, many of them new since my last visit, don't surprise me: despite its nearby mountains and ledges, bears and moose, downtown North Conway mostly dolls up what the visitors have left behind and asks them to purchase it here, and I can find a three-dollar latte or handmade arti- san jewelry as easily as I could in Dutchess County. I feel eager to</page><page sequence="10">S 12 / Southwest Review depart this routine terrain for what I have always considered the "real" New Hampshire - the one north of the notches. During my childhood trips to Pittsburg, riding in the backseat of my parents' Jeep, the traversal of the mountains seemed an impor- tant stage in the journey: they were the great fence that separated my known world from the wild, strange country beyond. On those drives, we followed Interstate 93 as it wound north, up the valley of the Merrimack River, and then the shallow, rocky riverbed of the Pemigewasset. The Interstate, at that time, ended near Clark's Trad- ing Post, a venerable tourist trap distinguished by - if that's the cor- rect phrase - trained black bears that climbed the poles out front as we drove past on Rt. 3. As far as I was concerned, here was the first vivid marker of the frontier. Just beyond this, atop Mount Pemigewasset, were the granite ledges that formed the profile known as Indian Head, and then we were in Franconia Notch itself, driving past the Flume and the Basin and countless tiny cascades that poured from the woods into the Pemigewasset before we reached that river's headwaters, Profile Lake, and peered up through smudged windows at Hawthorne's Great Stone Face, still "with all its original divinity intact" - though now it is yet another vanished landmark. For me, the true north began when, on the road into Pittsburg - far past the notch, at this point, in a less grand countryside of hilltop farms and sprucewoods - we crossed the 45 th Parallel; the knowl- edge that I was now closer to the North Pole than the Equator was, for a boy who loved maps, more than symbolic. But Pittsburg was a place filled with symbols I could not understand: the dud artillery shell in my great-grandmother's upstairs hall, a souvenir her older brother brought back from World War I; the noon whistle that blared every day from the fire station in the village,- the artificial Lake Francis, a drowned valley of farmhouses, including the one in which my grandmother was born,- the "magnetic hill" just across the border in Quebec, which pulled cars backwards up its incline; the aurora borealis we sometimes watched on August nights, and the spill of stars far brighter than I had ever - have ever - seen elsewhere. Deep iń the deep woods north and east of Pittsburg village, an- other great uncle, Keith, owned a hunting cabin, or "camp," named Buckhorn - either for the brook behind it, in which we chilled our milk and beer, or the rack of antlers ("horns," in the local parlance)</page><page sequence="11">Harmon /513 affixed to its door, which bore the weathered gouges of bear claws. In those days, Buckhorn was perhaps a forty-five minute or hour long drive down washed-out and beaver dam-flooded logging roads to the village, itself a long drive from much else. (Pittsburg, at more than 280 square miles, is by area the largest town east of the Mississippl.) And even then these roads had been improved recently by the timber companies; a few years earlier, my great uncle kept a junk wwn-era truck he called "the Buckhorn stage " at a point partway to the cabin beyond which ordinary cars could not travel. Here, visitors would park, climb into the stage, and, if it would start, bounce along another few miles to the next impassable spot, where they'd hop off the stage and walk the last stretch to the cabin. In any case, the road ended twenty yards past Buckhorn, where it turned, forded Buckhorn Brook, and faded into waist-high weeds. The only other sign of humanity we could see during our days here was the fire tower atop Mount Magalloway. Buckhorn remains the only place where I have fired a gun; my fa- ther and uncles John and Steve would line up cans along a log, and we would take turns blasting them off with various .22 revolvers and pistols - including one with which Keith had allegedly killed a black bear that had broken into someone's cabin by shooting it in the head - and a .22 rifle. There was also a 12-gauge shotgun they used for blasting hand-thrown clay pigeons in the field near the cabin. One summer I collected all the spent shells, tiny gold cylinders that filled my pockets like the gold rumored to exist in nearby Indian Stream. (In fact, certain mining explorations did turn up some gold, if not enough to make an investment worthwhile.) As if we'd slipped beyond the ken of the usual rules and laws once we crossed the moun- tains, we all permitted ourselves to relax. My mother and grandmother slipped into the accent and vocabulary of my northern relations. My father and uncles let me handle firearms and sip beers (if not simul- taneously). My seventy-some year-old grandfather, a Boston boy who'd met my grandmother years ago at one of Pittsburg's hunting lodges, stood up drunkenly from the bed of a pickup truck in which perhaps a half dozen of us jolted down the logging road, and, pistol holstered at his belt, balanced his arms to "surf" while my uncles laughed and a huge bull moose, startled at our noise, bolted off through a swamp. My mother recalls the booze that flowed by midmorning - her aunts</page><page sequence="12">S 14 / Southwest Review and, later, her cousins pouring whiskey highballs after cleaning house: "At first, I thought all the drinking was just when my parents came back north/7 she says of her own childhood awareness of the north country's differences. Of course, none of this seemed extraordinary to me then, despite the obvious differences between Pittsburg and my half-urban, half- suburban life in Massachusetts - where I would never have used an outhouse or watched French-Canadian tv. Even the customs here contradicted those of home: it was important, my mother once explained, to greet or wave to everyone you passed, even if you were driving. When we visited, we never waited for an invitation, but merely went to someone's house - and were often scolded if we knocked at the door. The values here, as I understood them and understand them now, have nothing to do with the sort of morality implicit in both the 2004 exit-poll question and the media's use of the term. These morals are largely unconcerned with judging one's neighbor or comparing his or her actions to one's own beliefs, but are instead a traditional code of reticence and respect, self-reliance and honesty, hard work; they stem not from a literal interpretation of the Bible but from an understanding of its most basic, human precepts,- they are shaped in large part from the struggle to carve out a space for oneself - physically, psychically - in this beautiful and fearsome northern landscape. IV: Scenes from Berlin- "People Like Us" Driving up Rt. 16 from Gorham, half an hour north of North Conway, I first notice the stink of the mills - paper in Gorham, pulp in Berlin - gone bankrupt in 2001 and re-opened a year later under new ownership and with smaller crews. The strip malls along this winding strip above the Androscoggin feature dollar stores, a Save-A- Lot supermarket, and many signs for stores that have now shut down: florists, furniture showrooms. Cars and trucks crowd the parking lot of a large, new-looking Wal-Mart. Water treatment pools, visible through the trees, are stained a neon green only slightly muted by the thick overcast skies. "Welcome to Berlin," reads a roadside sign, "The City That Trees Built." Rt. 16 splits into two one-way streets</page><page sequence="13">Harmon /515 at the beginning of town, and in the space between them lies a small grassy park with a bandstand - the latter festooned with a banner, printed with a flag and yellow ribbons, that reads "Until They All Come Home/' Yellow ribbons loop the trunk of every crabapple tree in the park. At the vfw hall, the sign reads: BINGO EVERY SUNDAY NIGHT WIN up to $1000 DOORS OPEN AT 5:30 Beneath this, another sign promotes the Bingo game, and then de- clares: LET FREEDOM RING. When I turn off the main roads, the sidestreets quickly climb the shoulders of the hills delimiting town. Birches grow on these slopes, rather than the fir and spruce and pines I expect. On the east- ern side of the Androscoggin, tenements and triple-deckers crowd the streets near the mill's towering smokestacks - five of which, on this day, breathe bright white smoke into the steel-colored sky. In the sawdusted millyards, hundreds - thousands? - of trees, stripped of their limbs, lie in piles like a child's popsicle-stick or Lincoln Log collection. Trucks crawl through the narrow and crooked downtown streets bearing more. The mill's shadows fall over a baseball field and playground across the street from Ingy's Ice Cream, housed in a building that was once a train depot. Despite the many signs and cheerful face it shows to any passersby, I wonder who, today, might pass through Berlin - that's pronounced BURR-lin - save those who live here or in the immediate environs. In the 1920s, the mainly immigrant population of Berlin - French- Canadians, Italians, Irish, Russians, Norwegians, Yankees - numbered nearly twenty thousand; today it is half that. The motel at which I stay hosts no other guests, and seems to have had none for some time; I asked the front desk clerk if they were busy when I phoned in my reservation, thinking of hunting season, and she chuckled and said no. This is a place that, like many small industrial towns and cities in the northeast, no longer seems to have, save stubborn memory, any reason to exist. Perhaps that is why it strikes me, apart from the mills, as strangely beautiful on this overcast day, with its</page><page sequence="14">Si6 / Southwest Review rugged granite hills and ledges, its steep streets and old houses crowned with eight-foot satellite dishes. Inside the Notre Dame Arena, the senior girls hockey team skates and shoots in practice while a few kids feed quarters to old arcade games and two mothers watch from behind scuffed plexiglass. The girls on the ice wear pony- tails that stick out from beneath their helmets, but no two have the same jersey: instead, they are clothed in sweatshirts or authentic NHL garb. Oddly, no girl exhibits the Boston Bruins7 black and gold, though the logos of the Chicago Blackhawks, San Jose Sharks, and Detroit Red Wings are represented. Have these girls been to these cities which, here, feel nearly as fantastic as one of Calvino's invis- ible cities? - do they share, as Calvino has written, Kublai Khan's " melancholy and relief of knowing we shall soon give up any thought of knowing and understanding " distant lands? At the top of one hill, near the edge of town, Russian Street meets Petrograd Street and at that corner stands an Orthodox Church; atop its blue onion domes, gold crosses scratch the low clouds. I arrived here hoping to see the town before it grew dark, since darkness comes so quickly to north- ern New England in this month, but by 2:30 it already feels like twi- light. By 4:15 it is dark. Like another old mill town - Providence, Rhode Island - Berlin now has a " river fire" festival, and, in a dammed arm of the Androscoggin, just north of the mill, charred nests from the most recent burning seem to welcome the mallards skimming in to splash-land as the light leaves the sky. Trees may have built Berlin, but they didn't build Gold House Pizza, where fake wood paneling covers the walls. As I eat my black olive pizza, a steady stream of customers comes for takeout, but only one other party - two old women and an old man - sits at a table behind me. Across the room are three darkened alcove booths, and taped to each is a paper plate on which someone has written "this section closed." When the other party rises to leave, the old man reaches for the switch on the wall and momentarily cuts the lights. Flipping another switch, he illuminates the three closed booths, and points to their ceilings while the two women with him lean into these grot- toes and peer up. In a moment he approaches my table. "I didn't mean for you to eat in the dark," he says, and explains how a year earlier he repainted the walls and ceilings in the three booths. The owner has now shut them off because of the "carvings, pen marks, even gouges</page><page sequence="15">Harmon /517 from the pens the kids have made - says she's ashamed to have people sit in them. The wood's beyond repair, I told her." "It's a shame that the young people won't respect things anymore," one of the women with him adds, shaking her head. I finish my pizza and drive down the near-abandoned Main Street to the Berlin Public Library, where I am to meet Coos County Demo- cratic Chair Paul Robataille, who has served in that capacity since 1988. The mill, just across the river, looms tall into the night sky behind the library; ghostly smoke still wafts skyward, and spotlights shine on the huge concrete silos. The library, built in 1908, has amazingly preserved oak paneling, moldings, and card catalogs throughout; at either end of a long room is a large brick fireplace. "For burning the books you de-accession?" I ask one of the librarians as I wait for Paul to finish work. "No," she says, and describes an old woman who as a girl had spent afternoons reading by the fireplaces. "We got a check from her for a thousand dollars after she died." Robataille and I head across the street to the lounge at the bowling alley, where he will let me buy him only a ginger ale,- 1 sip a Budweiser. Tonight is league night: as we talk, a steady stream of men in blue "K of C" polo shirts wanders into the bar, their right wrists wrapped in velcroed supports, saying hello to Paul as they carry their beers and sodas back into the alley. He waves and nods, greeting each man by name. "What does it mean that Coos County went blue this election?" I ask him. "It gives me bragging rights!" Robataille says, flashing me a broad smile. "Anyway, Coos used to be blue," he adds, though a quick look through the records proves otherwise: Clinton carried the county in both 1992 (when Perot captured a quarter of the votes here) and 1996 (when Perot still managed fifteen percent), but otherwise Republi- can presidential candidates have won Coos in every election since 1980, often by wide margins, until this year. Robataille's voice becomes most animated when he tells me about the grassroots progress he has seen in the north country - from the new registrations of people in their forties, fifties, and sixties to the many volunteers who wanted to help in the campaigns. "People are dying to get active, dying to get things changed," he says. "I want to</page><page sequence="16">$i8 / Southwest Review get back to street-corner politicking. Democrats need to be the party of the people. " He believes that the economy and health care were "the biggest issues" in Coos this year, but that "people still feel lied to" about both the 2000 election and Iraq. Without any prompting, Robataille offers an inversion of what Ed Sanders said to me a few days earlier: "People like images and myths," he says. "Around here, they've al- ways seen Democrats as the big-city party, and Republicans as the small-town party. People up here have an idea that Democrats are going to take all their money and give it to the poor, that we're going to take all their guns away or take away their ski-doos. And there's been forty years of media reinforcement of these ideas. But hey, we're all sportsmen too." He also confirms Sanders's point about new transplants. "There's a lot of new wealth coming into the area. In Gorham, we have two acre lots going for a hundred thousand dollars!" Coming from the absurd housing market of Dutchess County, I'm not exactly sure what this figure means. "What would they have cost a few years ago?" I ask. "Nine or ten thousand," he says. Robataille recollects Terry McAuliffe's speech at the Democratic National Convention in Boston this past summer. "There he was on stage in his thousand-dollar suit, with a fifty dollar haircut. It's hard for me to identify with someone like that. But then the camera panned over the crowd, and it was people like us." This last pronoun hangs in the air, and, in this setting, I don't know whom it includes. The bartender flirts with two men seated on stools,- the Knights of Columbus wander past, their strikes and spares crashing suddenly as they push through the door from lanes to lounge,- one man gnawing a chicken wing salutes us with a glistening hand; Robataille discusses his pending college degree and his job prospects (after being laid off at the mill, he has returned to school),- 1 drink my Budweiser and nod my head. In Coos County, I am never certain if I am "us." Back at my abandoned hotel (the desk clerk peeks from her televi- sion-illuminated upstairs window when I pull into the parking lot), I watch "News Nine" on wmur from Manchester. Tonight's lead story: a woman "feels closer to her husband" stationed in Iraq "when she looks at" the magnetic ribbons she's stuck to her car. She has made a</page><page sequence="17">Harmon / 519 "flag" out of red, white, and blue plastic cups shoved through the holes in her chain-link fence to express this closeness and pride - "This is my right, my freedom," she says to the reporter - but re- ceives an anonymous letter calling this display an eyesore. The woman writes an open letter to the neighborhood on a sheet of posterboard she hangs on the fence, and elicits an immediate com- munity response - statements of support for the plastic-cup flag, offers to pay for her family's Thanksgiving meal. John McCain's visit to Manchester, to speak at the second annual Nackey S. Loeb First Amendment Award Dinner, runs as the third or fourth story of the night: "I sincerely love the spirit of this place," McCain tells his audience. "The politics are noisy, colorful, face-to-face, and fun." Before I leave Berlin the next morning, I stop in at another Dunkin' Donuts, just up the block from my hotel. Inside, a coffeeklatsch of old men in airborne ranger windbreakers, Nashville Network caps, and stars-and-stripes T-shirts tucked into their jeans discuss the fail- ing negotiations between Pedro Martinez and the Boston Red Sox - the compensation and length of contract the star pitcher is seeking. I wonder whether these retired mill workers, the unionists Sanders blamed for Coos's vote, will side with management or labor in this case. What do so many million dollars over a few years mean, in a town such as this? V: The Million- D ollar Shithouse North of Berlin, Rt. 16 follows the Androscoggin through the hamlets of Milan and Dummer to Errol. The stretch of road north of Milan is known as the "Thirteen Mile Woods," and even today, except for the asphalt, I see almost no evidence of other people along it. The road itself is like those in car commercials - curving, scenic, empty. Ice skims the edges of the Pontook Reservoir this nineteenth day of November. When I get to Pittsburg, Back Lake will be frozen entirely across. The tallest structure I note is a decaying wooden ski jump perched on a steep hill in Milan, and my cell phone quickly loses what little signal it had in Berlin. Ed Sanders warned me that, even in Lancaster - further south, and in the Connecticut valley - reception was dubious:</page><page sequence="18">520 / Southwest Review my conversations with him, conducted entirely by cell phone, were invariably punctuated with thick washes of static, electronic pings, and odd echoes. "If you want to use a cell phone in Lancaster/7 he warned me, "you either have to go up to the top of Corrigan Hill, just south of town, or drive out Rt. 2 across the river and pull over on the other side of the bridge." At Errol, I turn west on Rt. 26 toward Dixville Notch and Colebrook. Here are signs of recent change in the countryside. When I began writing my novel, I used the New Hampshire Atlas and Gazetteer as an actual geography against which to measure the part-remembered, part-imaginary, part-desired one in my mind. But my Gazetteer does not show the many side roads I begin to see, muddy and ragged at their mouths, with bright yellow hand-lettered signs announcing such names as "Rt. 26 Spur #2," "Dix Pk Rd," "Rt. 26 Spur #3," "Rice Mtn Rd." High on the hills overlooking the valley, amid new clear- ings in the timber, homes reflect the wan sun off burnished windows and shiny new roofs. Around this point, I also notice the first of many snowmobiles parked in front of trailers and houses with hand- lettered "For Sale" signs taped to their noses - and, since snowmobile season begins in only a few weeks, these offers suggest either that the owners are upgrading to a new model or, more likely, selling off one of their treasures to help pay the bills. Another Dunkin' Donuts - the last and northernmost example of this franchise's market penetration I see in my travels - and a Subway stand near the intersection of Rt. 3 and Rt. 26 in Colebrook, a small town on the Connecticut River. When McDonald's first opened a branch in Lancaster, thirty-six miles south, there was a big to-do throughout the north country, but now I half expect to find a Starbucks farther along the road. I eat lunch at Howard's, a Colebrook institu- tion (and famous as the restaurant at which Betty and Barney Hill had supper before allegedly being abducted by aliens on a September night in 1961), where the placemats feature the advertisements of local businesses. One, Capital Well, lists among its services "Well Drilling / Water Systems / Water Treatment / Hydrofracking." I puzzle over this last term a long time. Colebrook is situated at something of a crossroads, close to the Vermont and Quebec borders, and the menu here includes poutine - French fries smothered in cheese curds and gravy, a Montreal specialty - though the waitstaff has corrupted</page><page sequence="19">Harmon / 521 the Québécois pronunciation to something like "puts in." French-Canadian relations are significant to Benoit "Beno" Lamontagne, who owns Colebrook's Radio Shack. When I ask the woman at the counter if he's around, she says "Oh, he's in back, doing what he does best - visiting." Ed Sanders has recommended I meet Beno, another Coos County Republican Committee member, but when Beno hands me his card a few minutes later, it lists him as president of the Colebrook Development Corporation. When I announce the reason for my visit, Beno's other guest ducks past me with a quick sidelong look, and Lamontagne crosses his arms and looks at the carpeted floor,- as I continue stammering out my curiosity about "why Coos voted for Kerry," he takes a step away from me and leans against a low shelf on which stand new tv sets draped with tinsel garlands. Not until I mention my family roots in Pittsburg does he let his guard down, and within a few minutes he moves closer to me, acting out lines of dialogue in his stories and patting my arm to emphasize his points. Like Paul Robataille, he considers health care to be one of the most important local issues - "I can't afford to give it to my employees here," he admits. "And unemployment is in the double digits in Coos." But for him the most important issue is cross-border trade. "I'm very disappointed that President Bush hasn't gone to Canada," he tells me, and launches into several long narratives about his frustrations to promote regional trade. "First the governor of Maine met the premier of Quebec on a trade mission. Then the governor of Vermont went to Quebec." Beno says he wrote several letters to Craig Benson - the Republican governor of New Hampshire, who narrowly lost re-election in 2004 - "pleading" that he do the same, but had no success until a politically-connected friend set up a meeting between them,- Benson led a trade delegation to Montreal only in September. "Do you have many customers from southern Quebec?" I ask. "Oh, sure," Beno says. "A lot of my business is from Quebec." He then tells me about various cross-border incidents that seem to stem from the same petty level of distrust Daniel Doan describes existing in this region in the 1830s, when goods were confiscated by customs guards and tradesmen tried to smuggle them through the woods instead. "I recommended a brick oven pizza restaurant in Sherbrooke to a few friends," Beno says. "But when they got there,</page><page sequence="20">522 / Southwest Review the owner, or a bouncer or someone, pointed to their car and asked them if it belonged to them. He saw their New Hampshire plates, and asked them to leave/' Around the same time, he says, several other cars with Vermont or New Hampshire plates were vandalized at a Sherbrooke mall - "They had their windows smashed in," he says. Regarding other border crossings, Lamontagne agrees with Sanders and Robataille. "Southern New Hampshire is becoming Massachusetts north/7 he tells me. "It's a problem. I think some people [in Coos] are losing a sense of our traditions." "I was pissed," he adds, that both Coos County and New Hampshire swung to Kerry, but, because his candidate won the national contest, he seems ultimately more concerned with the governor's office. Even though incumbent Benson lost to Democrat John Lynch, Beno shrugs this off by saying "It's the man, not the party." He's been impressed by Lynch's promises to continue promoting Quebec-New Hampshire trade relations. As I step outside, he helps his employee set up a holi- day window display. Across the street, I push open the door at the white brick building housing The News and Sentinel, a "classic country weekly" "[sļerving 15,000 Nice People in three states and Canada," according to its edi- tors. A photo of W. overlooks the newsroom,- the paper's credo is "Independent but not neutral." John Harrigan, publisher emeritus, isn't in the office today, but I catch up with him on the phone a week or two later. As with Beno, his initial curt demeanor yields after I disclose my family connections to Pittsburg. "Some of those names go back to the old settlement days," he says. Like Sanders, he speaks in the accent - flinty, faintly melodic - of one who has lived in Coos County a long time. "This is my fourth decade of being a newspaper guy," he says, and then, like any good veteran journalist, launches into an insightful commentary about a wide range of local topics. "The old party lines are blurring in New Hampshire. Now it has very little to do with the party and everything to do with the candidate. The old rules don't apply." Before I can ask him about values, Harrigan has already cited the "growing gulf between asphalt America and rural America." When I ask him to define the rural values of the north country, he says, "Independence, the ability to be left alone, a minimum of govern- ment, total freedom to do what you want as long as you don't bother</page><page sequence="21">Harmon / 523 your neighbor - these values transcend party and ideology here." And, as with Sanders, Robataille, and Lamontagne, Harrigan feels these values are in some ways under siege from those he calls "refu- gees from the rat race. . . . We've been discovered before, but they've been small discoveries. Now there's a realization that this is the end of the frontier. This is the last great place for freedom and affordable land, where you can carve out your own little piece of God's coun- try." When I tell him about all the signs of new development I saw during my visit, his voice dips in register. "There's been tremendous change here. Word is, they're pouring a foundation a day in this territory. Land is being gobbled up because it's absolutely dirt cheap. There are mini-fiefdoms going into the hills - four hundred thousand dollar houses that are being used as second homes. People are des- perate for this lifestyle. And it gets easier every year to come here - heating and insulation are better, the infrastructure allows it, there are more services. People who move here now wouldn't have lasted a few years ago." I ask about the nature of the conflicts between newcomers and longtime residents. "There are a lot of bitter feelings about posted land," he says, and counts his personal hatred for the "all-night lights at houses" that have ruined the evenings for him. But the election season brought few conflicts to the letters to the editor page of The News and Sentinel . "That's the job of the dailies," Harrigan says. "They can afford to run a lot of hot air." He continues: "Politics here is like religion - people are chary about talking politics. Asking some- one up here who he'll vote for is like asking if he's got a mistress on the side, or why he's a Baptist. Our letters were local - why they voted down the new fire truck, complaining about why South Hill Road is in such rough shape, asking why kids are allowed to hang around downtown at two am." For Harrigan, the greatest transformation in Coos County - "if I had to pick the one factor" - is the "change in information." He be- lieves that the twenty-four-hour news networks have "changed the outlooks of even fourth- or fifth-generation residents." He adds, "Computer use up here is staggering," then asks if I've seen The News and Sentinel Web site. We discuss printing technologies past and present for a minute, and he tells me that he was one of the last weeklies to get rid of his offset press and move to digital production.</page><page sequence="22">524 / Southwest Review The old seventeen-ton press, he says, is now in São Paulo. "I'd go to Brazil to see it," he says, "but I'd rather just go to Canada." Just north of Colebrook on Rt. 3 is what Barney Hall called "the million dollar shithouse." Hall, a retired river-driver and logger, was one of two boarders my great-grandmother took in to help make ends meet after her husband died in the early 1960s. The shithouse in question is a rest area with indoor plumbing - "Why spend so much money on a shithouse? Wouldn't an outhouse be just fine?" Barney is remembered to have said. Others echo this concern for thrift when I arrive in Pittsburg, and such a concern is probably a necessity here. To survive in this remote region and through inhospitable seasons required the legendary ingenuity as well as thrift, and my conversa- tions suggested that an unwillingness to pay, in the form of taxes, for such "impractical" amenities still shapes the local mentality. In West Stewartstown I see the last political sign of my journey, a hand painted and unpunctuated GO KERRY GO taped to a porch, as out-of-date as the blanched jack-o'-lanterns, toothless and shriveled, still haunting front steps and fenceposts. VI: Pittsburg- The End of the Frontier I cross the Connecticut River a few moments later on what my great aunt and the other older locals still call "the steel bridge" to distinguish it from the wooden covered bridges once common here, and, as I do, enter Pittsburg. The clouds that have darkened the sky since Dixville part and - I cannot invent this sort of detail - a large bird soaring over the young Connecticut swoops into a shaft of sun- light that shines on its suddenly and inescapably bright white head and tail feathers. The bald eagle circles, flaps its wings lazily and then seems to hover as it scans the gently rock-churned river. I pull onto the roadside grass to watch, but in a moment the eagle has caught a waft of wind and vanished over a ridge. At Indian Stream, piles of sawdust and stacks of logs as well as chippers and trucks and tall machines with conveyor belts ruin the meadows I remember: in my novel, one character chooses this exact spot as a place to settle. And, returning to Pittsburg, memory is my problem. In the past ten years I have been to Pittsburg twice: once for</page><page sequence="23">Harmon /52$ my great-grandmother's funeral, and once when I was writing my novel. Otherwise, I have not been north since the mid- to late 1980s, and ever since then I have seen the old Pittsburg I remember overlaid with the new one that has evolved in my absence, and have seen the actual place overlaid with my fictional rendering of it. But no place is static, and if Pittsburg seemed to remain so for many years to my- self and others, I did not live here and track the incremental daily adjustments that engender larger change. These woods and lakes, moose and trout have always been exploited for their commercial potential; we have merely become more adept at wringing cash from them. My cabin on Back Lake is furnished with an electric heater made in Japan and a tv with a dvd/vcr combo player for which I can pay to rent movies - two dollars apiece. When I check in, I ask the woman who owns the cabins about the operation at Indian Stream. "That's Amey's log yard/' she says. "Iťs been there as long as I can remember. " "Really?" I say, beginning to doubt my memory. I would never have had this character move her house to so ugly a spot, would never have been able to consider it beautiful, had I first seen it this way. "Oh, sure," she says. She looks, I estimate, at least ten or fifteen years older than I. "I moved up here five years ago, and it was here then." Nearer the village are more of the private roads I saw west of Errol, though here each is marked by a new green road sign. My great-grand- mother lived, during my boyhood, in a house near the bottom of a road that leads further uphill, to the farm she and my great-grand- father worked for many years, after their first farm was flooded by the Murphy Dam project in 1939. This road still bears their name. From the house where my great-grandmother lived, I would look out over her sloping lawn down to Rt. 3, the fire station, the town hall, and the spruces that lined the banks of the Connecticut, which flowed just across the road, and which I could hear at night from her porch. Beyond this, a hill entirely tree-clad rose to the horizon. On cool summer mornings, tatters of river fog wreathed the hillside. It is the view I think of when I think of Pittsburg, the view I saw from my great-grandmother's porch and her living room and the bed I some- times slept in in her large upstairs hallway. Now, the trees atop the ridge have been cut and a house, clearly silhouetted against the sky, stands there.</page><page sequence="24">5 26 / Southwest Review Further on, past Lake Francis, the old Hill Road has numerous new spurs and new houses, some still shells of plywood and Typar House Wrap, in more clearings. I drive north past Big Bucks Lane, Lost Horizon Road, Nice and Easy Lane, and G P Boulevard - most incongruous of all, the idea of a "boulevard" in this town - toward Second Lake. A house-for-sale sign - "We Sell The Great North Woods!" is the agency's motto (though, in October, 2003, over 170,000 acres around the Connecticut Lakes were purchased for $42 million by The Forest Society and the Lyme Timber Company, which will use the land subject to state conservation guidelines) - points down the dirt road to where the lodge called Idlewild once stood. Today nothing of the lodge remains but a flagpole not far from a fieldstone fireplace and tall brick chimney. Just beyond these ruins is a new house, year-round by the looks of it rather than the more usual "camps," without running water or electricity, that were until re- cently the only real dwellings between the northern side of First Lake and the Canadian border. Twin tire ruts, once Idlewild's circu- lar driveway, lead to another such house. A thicket of bushes and saplings has choked the old lawn, and lattices of leafless branches obscure the views across the lake to the low mountains near the Maine border. Coming back south, at Happy Corner - a crossroads by Perry Stream - I turn up Hill Road to investigate the houses I saw from Rt. 3 as I headed north. Here is the northernmost crossing of the Connecticut, a one-lane covered wooden bridge. More private roads branch off into the woods from either side, with names like Grand View Drive and Vista Way, as if the people building homes here - "bugging out to a secure spot," as Ed Sanders would have it - want to preserve the hopefully false designations of the suburbia they've left behind. The architecture is similarly suburban: vinyl siding rather than logs, three-bay garages, walls of windows. The road continues to the Hollow Cemetery, where my great-grandmother's family oc- cupies a fenced-in plot. A massive granite headstone in the center marks the graves of her parents - Venson P. Gray and Martha Schoppe - and her sister, Leora. To one side lie my great-grandparents. I stand here as the day ends, listening to suvs and the occasional logging truck hurtling down Rt. 3, just out of sight through the trees. The tv weatherman in Berlin this morning predicted an unseasonably warm</page><page sequence="25">Harmon /527 day throughout New Hampshire, from a high near sixty degrees in Nashua to one near fifty north of the mountains, but now my coat can't keep out the cold as the wind whisks clouds across the sky. A late firefly clings to the side of my great-great-grandparents7 marker. I touch it, and it retracts its legs slowly, then re-settles them on the cold granite. The local political issue of most interest in Pittsburg, it turns out, is not Bush vs. Kerry (which Bush won easily, 369-149, with Nader receiving four votes and one ballot registering an over-vote) but whether or not the town will continue to plow residents' driveways. Pittsburg averages about two hundred inches of snow a year, so this is no minor issue: by "driveways" I mean the new private roads I observed in the day's travel, some of which probably wind through the woods a quarter mile or more before one reaches the Shangri-La at the end of Lost Horizon Road. At the regular town meeting in March, according to Merrill, forty voters defeated the measure by nine votes. But the issue would not die, and a special town meeting was held later this year, this time attended by three hundred and fifty people. The measure failed again, by nearly the same tiny mar- gin. But my great uncle claims that the newcomers have formed their own cliques, and that every time two of them get together they're plotting something. "Plotting what?" I ask. "Hard to tell," he says. "To overthrow the board of selectmen, I guess." He's joking, but the December 8, 2004, edition of The News and Sentinel reported that thirty-year selectman Bing Judd is resigning his position on the three- member board; another selectman was called to serve in Iraq last winter, and so only one full-term member currently occupies the board. "They all want the same services they had wherever they've come from, but they're not getting them," my great-uncle says, mean- ing they're not going to get them. In Pittsburg, town services have never extended much beyond the school and plowing. Merrill and his wife, Judy, another Pittsburg native, own guest cabins on two of Pittsburg's lakes as well as a campground, and have just opened a new restaurant, the Happy Corner Cafe. Despite the economic woes of the region, Judy claims a certain amount of immunity: "People always want vacations," she confesses. (She may be right: at the cabin I've rented, a guestbook includes names and experiences from the fall of 2001, and in that time not one visitor</page><page sequence="26">5 28 / Southwest Review mentions, even obliquely, a world beyond the number of moose spot- ted or the bad weather.) Many tourists now eschew the traditional summer fishing and fall hunting seasons for winter. On some winter mornings, Merrill says, "You could walk from the restaurant to the store" - Young's Store, the last retail outlet before Canada, owned for many years by Judy's parents and now by her brother,- the dis- tance measures perhaps a hundred yards - "stepping from one snow machine to the next." These snowmobiles have become, given the dearth of hunters and fishers, Pittsburg's "economic vitality," according to John Harrigan, who tells me that "thirty percent of the winter income" in the north country is snowmobile related. A local snowmobile organization, the Pittsburg Ridge Runners Snowmobile Club, boasts a membership of 4,400 people. Over a thousand miles of snowmobile trails run through Coos County and form a network with other trails in Maine, Vermont, and Quebec. Presumably the trails pose another challenge to the customs agents and border guards, who for years would literally wave us through when we headed into Quebec to test the Magnetic Hill and buy Canadian chocolate bars,- now they undergo rigorous counterterrorist training. Last winter, two Russian men used one of the snowmobile trails to cross from Canada into Pittsburg - after walking many miles through the woods, the men reached Young's Store, just south of First Lake and well north of the village. There they took off ruined shoes and pants, changed into dress loaf- ers and slacks, and asked where they might catch the bus. After a resident telephoned the customs station, a bus, driven by the ins, did indeed come for them. In the late 1980s, construction on the 1-93 extension through Franconia Notch ended; my great-uncle Keith, then in his sixties, worked on one of the road crews. Now that I - and anyone else - can blast into the north at 75 mph, reaching Pittsburg in a few hours' drive from the Mass Pike, then shoot home in time for Monday morning's class, the old logging road that led to Buckhorn is virtu- ally a graded and leveled gravel highway itself. The easy access to this rabbit-eared corner of the state has forever changed it. "A doctor paid a million dollars for an acre on First Lake," Merrill tells me, "and he's going to build a million dollar house on it." He smiles. "At one time, you could've bought all of Pittsburg for a million</page><page sequence="27">Harmon / 529 dollars/' (The News and Sentinel, in its November 17, 2004, edition, reported that "Pittsburg's net assessed value is now $224,386,689, increased from $125,492,3 5 3" since the previous revaluation.) Outside Merrill and Judy's house, in the spill of floodlight illumi- nating their gravel driveway and dispelling here the deep Pittsburg dark, I notice that on the hood of Merrill's Ford pickup truck are painted two screaming eagles trailing red, white, and blue ribbons. I sniff the crisp air for a moment, savoring the silence, then start the car and circle the lake to my cabin, where I turn on the heater and unfold this week's News and Sentinel on the kitchen table. In its pages, a column titled "From Stump to Mill" elaborates on some of my observations: It used to be more or less a part of our business to know just about who or what owned most of the larger blocks of timber- land in northern New England. There have been so many changes in those ownerships in recent years that we no longer have any idea whose raspberries we are picking as we stroll along a wood- land trail. . . . Sometimes we do get a hint as to the nature of the present ownership. The frequent number of "No Trespassing" and "Posted" signs along the roadside often means that someone from "down country" has purchased a piece of woodland and, having paid good money for those acres with their ever-increas- ing annual tax, wants the exclusive use of them for himself and his family. Often, little consideration is given to what had at- tracted him to the area in the first place: the thousands of acres of forests and the miles of streambanks. . . . I went north intending to write about voting and values, and how the regional character informed each, but found instead that, at least for me, the regional character is vanishing in Pittsburg just as it's vanishing everywhere else. Perhaps John Harrigan is right, and the incredible flow of information is partly responsible; when, back home, I discover Web cams offering me views of First Lake and Mount Magalloway, updated every five minutes on my computer screen, I can't disagree. Or perhaps the Interstate's northward progress al- lowed the inevitable sprawl to follow. But either of these hypotheses implies that Pittsburg, after a period of isolation, has recently be- come joined to larger technological networks, and I don't believe that;</page><page sequence="28">530 / Southwest Review for decades the Connecticut River served as a conduit down which an annual rush of millions of logs flowed from Coos, and I have read accounts of motor tours to the Connecticut Lakes from the 1930s. I might blame the low interest rates that have permitted many people to afford vacation homes, or millennial and geopolitical anxieties such as Y2K and 9/1 1 that have made the remote and the rural feel secure. But all of these responses are as facile as claiming that the 2004 election was a referendum on "moral values/7 Coos County is changing due to a confluence of factors I cannot understand, partly because I want to deny them - just as the reasons why a president with low approval ratings, a poor economy, an increasingly expensive and unpopular overseas invasion, and an immeasurably vast opposition in the electorate was voted to a second term are, for Democrats and media alike, worthy of so much agonized debate. Coos County is not - at least now - unique, as I have always thought and hoped; it is subject to the same insipid forces changing other communities across the country. The new McMansions on over- sized lots dotting the hills and woods in Coos are not appreciably different from those crammed into the hills and woods along Rt. 9 and the Taconic State Parkway in Dutchess County. If, in Coos, freedom means space, privacy, and "exclusive use/7 how can this far-flung tract harbor everyone who wants to live free? That we feel truly free only through ownership and exclusion seems an accurate summary of the 2004 election. It's useless to try to nudge the politics and ideas of everyone to whom I've spoken up north toward some sort of accord, to try to interpret their words in a way that supports whatever half-formed thoughts I already possess, the way so many commentators have done regarding the Bush/Kerry contest. Coos county voted for Kerry not because of an influx of people from Massachusetts, or because of a lack of "moral values/7 or because of the economy, or because of Iraq. I can pin down no single cause or source because in northern New England consensus is rare, as anyone who's been to a town meet- ing can attest. William Faulkner, in his essay "A Guest's Impression of New England/' notices as much about the New England polis : It is not the country which impressed this one. It is the people - the men and women themselves so individual, who hold indi-</page><page sequence="29">Harmon /531 vidual integration and privacy as high and dear as they do liberty and freedom; holding these so high that they take it for granted that all other men and women are individuals, too, and treat them as such, doing this simply by letting them alone with absolute and complete dignity and courtesy. The individual choices made on the 16,919 ballots cast throughout Coos County on November 2, 2004 - whether informed or ignorant - reflect this. Of course, Faulkner's fifty-year-old words are yet an- other tidy generalization, but one that, for me, at least, has the aura of truth. To understand the real reasons behind the vote here, I'd have to speak to those 16,919 voters. And to do so would further violate the "complete dignity and courtesy" upon which I have already trespassed. On my way home, I stop at the Trading Post, near the center of town, to fill the gas tank; I bought pocket-loads of candy here those summers I spent in Pittsburg. Inside, I speak to the twenty- something woman working the till. "It's great up here," she tells me. "Last winter we had two weeks at forty-five below! I loved it, except my car wouldn't start." She says she's been here for two years, and has built a place on eight acres, a "deer feed property" where she's permitted to leave food for those animals I often see, in full daylight, crossing streets or browsing backyard shrubs throughout Dutchess County. A flyer tacked to a bulletin board advertises a non-denominational Christian fellowship meeting. Outside, a ban- ner welcomes hunters - none of whom have accepted this greeting today - with an offer of free coffee from five to eight am. Beneath this a smaller sign says "Now Serving Boston's Best Fresh Brewed Coffee." A block and tackle for weighing deer dangles from the side of the building. Knowing that I'll be leaving in a minute, I cannot stop observing all these details, as if tallying their incongruities will help me understand them or this place,- part of me worries that when I next return, two or five or twelve years from now, I will be nostal- gic even for this weekend's Pittsburg. I sit in the car and fill another page of my notebook before taking Rt. 145 south through the hills of Clarksville and Stewartstown Hollow and back to Colebrook.
