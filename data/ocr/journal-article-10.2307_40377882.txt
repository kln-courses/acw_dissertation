<plain_text><page sequence="1">Bahya ben Joseph Ibn Pakuda, The Book of Direction to the Duties of the Heart. Introduction, translation, and notes by Menahem Mansoor. Oxford and Portland, Oregon: The Littman Library of Jewish Civilization, 2004. 472 pp. Bibliography, indexes. This is a welcome reprint of the original edition (Routledge. Kegan Paul, 1973). Ibn Pakuda's book found rapid acceptance in Hebrew; Judah Ibn Tibbon began his work as translator with it in 1 161. Ever since then, the book has been an important reference both in rationalist and in non- rationalist Jewish cultures. It could thus disseminate philosophical and scientific ideas in Ashkenazi Judaism, which was usually unreceptive to whatever smacked of "alien wisdom." Mansoor's is the first translation from the Arabic original (Moses Hyamson's widely circulated English translation was done from Ibn Tibbon's Hebrew). This reprint will provide a younger generation of English readers with access to this translation, which has long been out of print. Petrus Alfonsi, Dialogue against the Jews. Trans. Irven M. Resnick (The Fathers of the Church. Mediaeval Continuation, vol. 8). Washington, 348</page><page sequence="2">DC: The Catholic University of America Press, 2006. xxv+290 pp. Indexes. The late Amos Funkenstein distinguished four basic patterns of Christian anti-Jewish argumentation in the twelfth century and underscored the importance of the new genre of philosophically informed arguments, which invoke scientific ideas and concepts or draw on reason. These are arguments to the effect that fundamental ideas of Judaism run counter to what one knows by reason, i.e., through philosophy. Such arguments were advanced notably by Jewish converts who had an intimate knowledge of the Jewish sources. The most prominent among them was certainly Petrus Alfonsi, who also played an important role in the early Arabic-to-Latin translation movement. Alfonsi composed his Dialogus (or Dialogui) contra judaeos some time after his conversion in 1106, probably only in the late 1120s in Toledo. One of the characteristics of this interior dialogue between Alfonsi's former self (Moyses) and his present Christian self (Petrus) is that it seeks to do much more than justify the author's conversion: addressing itself to the educated reader, it endeavors to show that Christian belief has much more to recommend itself than scriptural evidence, for it is grounded in contemporary philosophy and natural science. Judaism, by contrast- and this is one of Alfonsi's main lines of attack- entertains an anthropomorphic, that is corporeal, notion of God, a charge substantiated with numerous talmudic (mainly aggadic) quotations. Alfonsi similarly draws on science to argue against the idea of the resurrection of the dead. Indeed, Alfonsi's conversion itself must be understood as following from scientific and philosophical considerations. For his rationalist arguments Alfonsi drew on the science and philosophy he had learnt in Andalusia while still a Jew. His anti- Jewish work is therefore an integral part of medieval Jewish intellectual history. Indeed, readers familiar with medieval works like the Kuzari, 'Emunah ramalo , and the Guide of the Perplexed will have a feeling of 349</page><page sequence="3">déjà vu when perusing the Dialogue against the Jew. It is fortunate that Resnick's English translation makes it easily accessible to all readers, who will be grateful for the numerous erudite notes accompanying the translation.</page></plain_text>
