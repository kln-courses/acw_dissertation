      <p>Although this book is full of interesting material on the emergence of applied entomology and related matters, institutional and disciplinary history are not Sarah Jansen’s prime concerns. Hers is instead a study of the formation of what she calls a “scientific object”: namely, that of the “pest” as an insidious threat (<italic>Schädling</italic>). Drawing on Hans‐Jörg Rheinberger’s work on experimental systems, she defines a “scientific object” neither as a material object nor as a concept but, rather, as an entity defined by the activities of observation, naming, and manipulation. Since these processes were shaped by activity both within and without the scientific community, <italic>Schädling</italic> was at once a scientific and a political construct.</p>
      <p>The focus of the study is the fact that between the mid‐nineteenth century and World War I German forest entomologists came to think about insect damage in a different way. There was a shift of meaning and usage from <italic>Schäd</italic>
         <italic>liche Insekten</italic> (“destructive insects”) to <italic>Schädlinge</italic> (“pests,” whether insect or human). Approaches to pest control changed accordingly, as entomologists spoke less about <italic>Vertilgung</italic> (eliminating destructive insects from individual trees or local forests) and increasingly about <italic>Vernichtung</italic> (the elimination of “masses” of pests on a large scale using biological or chemical methods). This shift, she argues, was shaped by a number of simultaneous developments on several fronts. The threat posed by the entry of pests from abroad, such as the <italic>Phylloxera</italic> rampant in French vineyards in the 1870s, lent <italic>Schädling</italic> the connotation of a “foreign” invader that endangered “German” interests. In addition, Darwin’s work—and the writings on degeneration that it spawned—encouraged conceptual links between entomology and the new social hygiene, among them the notion that both bugs and humans could be “social parasites.” Moreover, the gradual displacement of natural history by the new experimental biology in the latter nineteenth century meant that traditional notions of a natural equilibrium gave way to the idea of man‐made equilibria in which insect populations were subject to intervention and control. Finally, although chemical methods of control had few adherents in Germany before 1914, the experience with gas warfare had by 1918 created new opportunities, prompting a rethinking of approaches to pest control.</p>
      <p>Just why Jansen chose to organize the book around the linguistic shift toward <italic>Vernichtung</italic> and <italic>Schädling</italic> is not altogether clear, since little evidence is given for the claim that they possessed substantially different meanings from their mid‐nineteenth‐century predecessors. One wonders whether it is because both terms were part of the anti‐Semitic (and eventually exterminationist) vocabulary of National Socialism. As she notes, both the language and practices (e.g., gassing) of German applied entomology by 1920 provided “enabling conditions” that could later be appropriated for inhuman purposes.</p>
      <p>Since American entomologists had begun experimenting with chemical methods earlier and on a larger scale than those in Germany, it would be interesting to look comparatively at the development of the concept of “pest,” especially since quite a few studies of North American applied entomology (including the links with gas warfare) have appeared over the last decade. Jansen says little about these on the grounds that differences in historiographical approach make comparative analysis impossible (though precisely such historiographical differences might have made a discussion of this work instructive).</p>
      <p>The author’s own approach is that of discourse analysis, drawing on Foucault. The “interdiscursive elements” so central to her analysis are, she argues, not to be confused with metaphors. Whereas the latter work by the transport of meanings from one frame to another, scientific objects like <italic>Schädling</italic> arose through the “interweaving” of several discourses or practices. (On the other hand, many of the “interdiscursive elements” discussed are anthropomorphic and probably arose via metaphorical extension from the social world to the natural one, aided by the fact that two of Jansen’s key entomologists were medically trained.)</p>
      <p>This is an ambitious book that tackles a difficult but important topic. While some might have approached the material differently, most will agree that the overall result is valuable and provocative.</p>
