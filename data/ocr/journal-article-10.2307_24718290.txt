Tangkis are exorcists who perform war magic using the ritual theater of self-mortification. A tangki pierces his body with rods and swords in order to be super charged with the spirit-power of the weapons for the battle with evil. Self-mortification can also enact a bodhisattva sacrifice of the body on behalf of devotees. The virtuality of the ritual theater convinces believ ers of the actuality of exorcism, which will ensure peace and safety in the reality of the everyday. Keywords: demonology, exorcism, gods, Hokkien, ritual theater, spirit medium worship, tangki, war magic Tangki spirit-medium performances are not for the faint-hearted. To the beat ing of drums and gongs, the tangki, head shaking and eyes rolling, dances in a deep trance. Some tangkis cut themselves with knives or hit their bodies with spike-balls to spill sacred blood. Others pierce themselves through a cheek with rods that can be as long as six chiok (about six feet) and one choon (about one inch) thick,1 or they drive needles and swords into the flesh of their arms and back. Bristling like a human pincushion, the tangki dances energetically in an awe-inspiring performance. However, the performance is less about spectacle than it is about exorcist war magic. Tangki worship is a signifying practice of the Minnan (southern Min) people of Hokkien (Fujian) province, which is located on the southeast coast of main land China. The Hokkiens form the vast majority of the Chinese of Taiwan and a major proportion of the Chinese communities in Southeast Asia (Pan 1998: 31). Tangki worship has also spread to Teochew (Chaozhou) and Hainan with the migration of Minnan people to these regions.

The practice consists of congeries of independent sects that share a loose ritual tradition. The worship does not have an ecclesiastical canon and does not feature chanting or the recitation of prayers. The tangki's techne is war magic—a ritual theater in which the pro tagonists are spirit-possessed mediums believed to be warrior gods incarnate. The tangki's magic is not the witchcraft or sorcery defined by Ellen (1993: 8) as "the use of supernatural agency by persons to harm other persons." It is a magic that may be described, in Kapferer's (2005a) terms, as the 'virtuality' of war between gods and demons. Virtuality and Actuality in Ritual and Theater Kapferer (2005b: 157-159) writes of the role of theater in Suniyama exorcism, but he resists the use of the theater paradigm, which can reduce ritual to mere representation. Ritual, he argues, is a dynamic within which meanings are made, so that if the theater analogy has to be used, then ritual would more appropriately be likened to "what goes on behind the scenes" rather than "what is overtly presented" (Kapferer 2005a: 50-51). Approaching from an epistemological perspective that regards the ontology of theater as interactive magic and not as representation, I argue that tangki war magic is ritual theater. I point to reader-response theories, which argue that the reader participates in the making of meaning. I will postpone this deliberation until the next section in order to continue my discussion of the concept of virtuality. Kapferer (2005a) defines virtuality against the actuality of lived life. Lived reality is a chaos within which the virtuality of ritual offers respite by "slowing down" or "holding in abeyance or suspension" some of the exertions of living (ibid.: 48). Norton (1972) offers another perspective with his examination of virtuality and actuality as 'things'. Suppose, says Norton, that only 9 out of 10 members of a committee turn up for a meeting. The meeting is held since virtually all are present. A virtual committee has now been created. Norton notes that virtuality implies the "admission that something is not the case in fact. But something else is the case" (ibid.: 499; original emphasis). How much 'in effect' is a virtual thing? Norton answers that it should be "enough (and no less) in order to be able to persuade the observer that the reality is present and that it is operative" (ibid.). Norton also argues that virtuality can be stretched and tested. Would the presence of 5 key members also suffice to constitute the virtuality of the actuality of a 10-member committee? But virtuality has to be 'enough'. If virtually nobody turned up, we would have the actuality of a non-actual committee, even if three members had in fact turned up (Norton 1972: 500). Virtuality, Norton points out, is actuated out of actuality, whereupon the virtuality would transcend the referred actuality: "Virtuality is housed within the actual but over against it as well; and it is over against the actual that the virtual immediately objectifies its identity and its difference" (ibid.: 500-501). This notion of an objectified identity ties in with</page><page sequence="3">Tangki War Magic | 27 Kapferer's (2005a: 47) proposition of virtuality as an "existential reality" that is as fully lived as ordinary life. Further, we note that Norton's discussion of vir tuality employs concepts of spatiality, and this links with Kapferer's arguments about the "phantasmagoric space of ritual virtuality" (ibid.). The virtuality of ritual can thus be depicted as a means of escape from the everyday through a transcendental experience, but there is always the return to actuality, which is likely to be a new actuality. Tangki War Magic as Ritual Theater Returning to my proposition that tangki war magic is ritual theater, I would agree with Kapferer that the use of theater as an analytical tool in the exami nation of ritual can reduce ritual to mere representation. I am especially con cerned with the conventions of theater as entertainment. Against this worry of the concept of theater as facsimile, I would point out that, in the Asian tradi tion, ritual is theater and theater is ritual. As in my book, Ritual Is Theatre, Theatre Is Ritual (Chan 2006), I argue here that theater constitutes the magic of tangki worship. Traditional Asian theater pieces are performances of ritual. For example, Chinese Nuo, featuring masked performers (see below), is exorcist theater and is the root of Chinese painted face opera and Japanese Noh (Tian 2003-2004) ,2 The Ramnagar Ramlila, an epic re-enactment of the life of the Hindu deity Rama at the city of Varanasi in India, is a site of pilgrimage (Sax 1990). Malaysian, Thai, and Indonesian shadow puppetry concerns the restoration of cosmic bal ance (Wong and Lysloff 1991; Yousof 2010), and the Sinhala Suniyama is drama tized ritual healing (Kapferer 2005b). In tangki spirit-medium worship, the instance of possession, when the spirit of the mortal steps aside to allow the spirit of the god to take its place, is the magical moment of the transmogrification of a mortal into a god, and this transformation is enacted theatrically with the possessed medium behaving in a manner that the audience of devotees would expect of the role. Hence, a medium possessed by the Monkey God would perform suitably simian gestures drawn largely from the Chinese staged shows of the legend of the Monkey God. Although—and this bears repeating—I am not discussing a performance of representation, the concept of the double-of-theater articulated in Western theater theory is most helpful to my discussion of tangki war magic. Laurence Olivier performing Hamlet was Olivier and also Hamlet at the same time. This double-of-theater, I have argued (Chan 2012), constitutes the essential magic of Chinese ritual theater. The Chinese character for puppet and ancient masked actor is {!I (kui), an ideograph that clearly illustrates the ontology of the exorcist as a 'double-nature-being', for it combines the \ (ren) human radical with that of (gui), ghost or spirit. It is this double nature—one that 'is and also is' (the possessed medium enacting a spirit-warrior, the statue that is likewise a god, the anthropomorphic puppet who is also a performing deity)—that makes the image the magical doorway into the virtuality of ritual (Chan 2006: 133-149;</page><page sequence="4">28 I Margaret Chan 2012). The emotive music of drums and cymbals and the synesthesia derived from watching the cruel spectacle of tangki self-mortification invite partici pants to enter into the virtuality of tangki theater. The techne of the tangki is the staging of the phantasmagoria of war. As with the phantasmagoria theater of eighteenth- and nineteenth-century Europe, there is the equivalent of magic lantern projections of ghouls and specters upon the screen of the imagination, for tangki phantasmagoria must, as Norton points out, be 'enough' to persuade the observer that the reality is present and that it is operative. The actuality, within which the virtuality of tangki war magic is actuated, is a mythic world that is founded upon a shared body of knowledge involving a tradition of warrior god exorcisms that go back five thousand years, as well as a belief in demons affirmed in the corpus of demonology. Devotees who enter into the tangki ritual theater are not passive spectators. Reader response theories that have come from literature and now prevail in theater analysis see the reader as an active participant in the dynamic process of making meaning. Rosenblatt ([1938] 1995) proposes that reading is 'transac tional'. Dow (1986: 60-61) writes that 'magical healing' (within which category he includes Western psychotherapy) takes place in a shared, socio-culturally informed mythic world. Healers make this world become real for patients, with healing seen as a process of negotiations of meaning between healer and patient. In a psychiatric study of tangki healing in Singapore, Lee et al. (2010: 77) report that success depends on the healer's ability to enact a shared mythic world and then to persuade patients to attach themselves emotionally to transactional symbols presented in the enactment. For healing to take place, patients need to reframe ideas enacted by the tangki to be consistent with their own explanatory models (ibid.: 74). In common with the discourses of Dow, Kapferer, and Lee et al., this essay acknowledges the place of theater in ritual healing. The Mythic World of Tangki War Magic Tangki worship is a Hokkien tradition, but the tangki's mythic world is founded within a Chinese universality. Hsu (1997) argues that the ancient Chinese iden tity was that of 'culturalism', which involved a shared body of ideas. Culture, according to Hsu, is very much a product of social process, as indeed is tangki war magic. In the last sections of this essay, I discuss how the virtuality of tangki theater has stretched to accommodate new societal norms.3 Returning to Hsu (1997), we understand that the word 'China' was coined by Central Asians with reference to Ch'in (Qin 221-206 bce), the first imperial dynasty that unified China.4 The Chinese, however, did not use this name until the nineteenth century, when notions of the nation-state emerged. Beginning in the Zhou era (1027-221 bce), the Chinese regarded themselves as subjects of the emperor who ruled over 'the world under heaven' (tiawcia). Thus, for the Chinese, their country was their universe, and a Chinese identity based on cultural universalism emerged. By the Warring States period (476-256 bce), Chinese cultural universal ity had united all peoples within the boundaries of the empire. Chinese and</page><page sequence="5">Tangki War Magic \ 29 non-Chinese states did not dispute the idea of cultural unification; instead, they fought each other to win the mandate to rule over the united empire. Hsu (1997) proposes that the Qin unification of China in the third century bce was inevitable, owing to Chinese cultural universalism. Chinese cultural universalism is the subtext (to use the vocabulary of the ater) for the enactment of the tangki's mythic world within which the virtual ly of tangki war magic is actuated. We shall see how the plot, which features spirit-general protagonists battling against demonic antagonists, can be traced directly back to Zhou times and the proto-Chinese dynasties. Ancient Nuo Exorcism: The Template for Tangki War Magic The religious procession through a precinct that is intended to drive out evil has a central place in Chinese religious rituals. The practice goes back to the nuo exorcisms of the first proto-Chinese Xia dynasty (2205-1806 bce) (Tian 2003-2004: 344). From as early as this time, nuos were performed as collec tive exorcist rituals presented as attacks against evil spirits. By the Zhou era, the nuo was institutionalized, and the emperor himself presided over the more important state nuos. Nuo rituals were processional and always led by a warrior exorcist, known as the fangxiangshi, who has been variously named 'the warrior of the four directions' or 'the manic general who clears the way'. The Zhouli (Rites of Zhou) describes the fangxiangshi as an exorcist who wears a grotesque bear skin mask, is armed with a lance and shield, and dances wildly (Bodde 1975: 77-83; de Groot 1910: 974-982). The Zhou nuo exorcisms were violent performances during which sacrificial animals were torn apart. At the Da Nuo (Grand Exorcism), staged annually in winter, soldiers were commanded by the emperor to drive out evil spirits fiercely by "ripping open victims on every side ... [attacking birds are stern and swift" (Lu Shi Chun Qiu [The Annals of Lü Buwei], cited in Tian 2003-2004: 344 345). Always at the head of these rampaging processions was the fangxiangshi, brandishing a lance and carrying a shield while "leading one hundred slaves into houses and tombs to chase away pestilences, ghosts and spirits" (ibid.: 345). The tradition of the state nuo exorcism continued until the Ming period (1368-1644), with a hiatus during the Mongolian Yuan dynasty (1279-1368). State nuo rituals were no longer practiced in the Manchu Qing era (1644-1911), but folk nuo exorcism continues up to the present as masked drama (ibid.: 348). The Modern Tangki as Heir to the Fangxiangshi These descriptions of ancient nuo exorcism almost fit contemporary spirit medium parades of the Thai Vegetarian Festival in Phuket (see Cohen 2001: 88-94), or the Capgomeh (fifteenth day of the first lunar month) procession in Singkawang, West Kalimantan (Chan 2009), or the yiukeng (demon-expelling tours)5 conducted by Singaporean tangkis (Chan 2006: 102-103). All are pro cessions featuring entranced tangkis wielding, or pierced by, weapons. The</page><page sequence="6">30 I Margaret Chan spirit-mediums walk a route through the community, clearing the neighborhood of evil spirits. The link between ancient nuo exorcism and the development of the nuo masked drama of southwest China is well-documented (see, e.g., Chongqing et al. 1989; Riley 1997), but I am not aware of scholarship on the historical development of the tangki role, which includes links to the fangx iangshi, other than that set out in my book on Chinese spirit-mediums (Chan 2006: 20-41). Yet the evidence is compelling, for the tangki clearly performs the ancient ritual role of the warrior exorcist. Tangki as Warrior Hero of Folklore and Theater In medieval times, theater and storytelling were the most important sources of entertainment for villagers, who were largely illiterate. The storytellers' dra matized readings developed into street opera and puppet shows. Performers used iconic gestures and a code of props, costumes, and make-up as mark ers to identify the cast of gods. Chinese woodblock printing ensured that the images of the gods were widely disseminated, and gradually these portrayals of gods and demons—their appearance, dress, and behavior—concretized in the minds of the people as an internalized body of knowledge that constitutes the habitus of the tangki. This embodied knowledge, "beyond the grasp of consciousness... values given body, made body... by the hidden persuasion of an implicit pedagogy" (Bourdieu 1977: 94; original emphasis), can inform trance behavior. A psychiatric report of patients in a Singapore mental hospital who were susceptible to trance demonstrated a clear cultural connection. Of the 29 Chinese patients studied, 55 percent portrayed Buddhist and Daoist dei ties, while 31 percent presented themselves as possessed by ghosts and spirits. The Malays largely enacted deceased ancestors or animal spirits or legendary Malay warrior heroes, and the Indian patients mostly drew from the Hindu pantheon (Ng 2000: 571). The unconsciously acquired somatic knowledge in turn produced what might be considered the 'canon' of tangki worship—a doxa of beliefs, unani mously held, unspoken but understood by all, "the aggregate of the 'choices' whose subject is everyone and no one because the questions they answer cannot be explicitly asked ... [an] absolute form of recognition of legitimacy through misrecognition of arbitrariness, since it is unaware of the very ques tion of legitimacy" (Bourdieu 1977: 168). When in a trance, tangkis perform the theatrical images of their habitus, and devotees judge the authenticity of tangki possessions against a doxa yardstick. For example, if the tangki of the Monkey God performs like an opera actor in the role, this meets the 'gold stan dard' of true possession by the god. New knowledge is also incorporated into the doxa, so we now see tangkis dressed in the image of the gods portrayed on television shows. Tangkis have also learned new methods of self-mortifica tion, such as thrusting an electric fan through a cheek. What would constitute orthopraxy and what would be heterodoxy? Between what should-be and what should-not-be lies the gray area of the tangki's doxa, which, as we will learn later, is a flexible virtuality.</page><page sequence="7">Tangki War Magic | 31 The Antagonist: Ghosts in the Chinese Imagination War magic and the warrior exorcist are responses to the deep-held Chinese belief in the existence of ghosts. The notion of ghosts is endemic in the Chinese mythic world as evidenced by the "staggering amount of materials" on the subject in traditional Chinese literature and "some 200 words still in use" that are related to the radical gui %, which is commonly translated as 'ghost' (Yu 1987: 397-398). Ghosts feature in the major works of Chinese history, including the Zuo Zhuan (The Chronicles of Zuo, covering the period from 722-468 bce), one of the oldest Chinese works of narrative history, and the Shiji (Records of the Grand Historian), written from 109 bce to 91 bce. Ghost stories are found in virtually all periods of Chinese popular tales; thus, "to study this topic is to engage in a survey of the history of traditional Chinese fiction" (ibid.: 399-401). Popular zhiguai (demon tales) and chuanqi (traditional tales of the marvel ous) formed part of the repertoire of wandering balladeers and storytellers. These stories supplied the images of ghouls and specters for the phantasma goria of tangki ritual theater. A corpus of Chinese demonology has developed, and since tangki war magic often deals with healing, I shall set out some ideas from traditional Chinese medicine. For the sake of variety, the following dis cussion uses different terms—demons, evil spirits, ghosts—which generically represent the malevolent spirits that have to be repelled by war magic. Demonology Schiffeler (1976: 19) writes of the Neolithic belief that illness was the result of ghostly gui attacks, which caused the hun ethereal soul to leave the body, thus leaving the po carnal soul vulnerable. Cure was effected by sorcerer physicians who would drive out the gui. Waley ([1934] 1968) reports that during the Shang dynasty (1557-1027 bce) the attitude toward religion was 'auguristic-sacrificial', evincing a belief in magic rather than heavenly rewards for good behavior. Omens and good fortune were obtained by specific perfor mances of ritual sacrifice. The Zhou dynasty, which followed the Shang, was the age of Confucius, who would not speak of "extraordinary things, feats of strength, disorder, and spiritual beings" (Legge [1861] 2012: book 7). Yet at nuo exorcisms, "[w]hen the villagers were going through their ceremonies to drive away pestilential influences, he put on his court robes and stood on the eastern steps" (ibid.: book 10). Confucius was a rationalist. Although he did not believe in spirits, the nuo exorcisms were important state events, and he "sacrificed to the spirits, as if the spirits were present" (ibid: book 3). Confu cian rationalism prevailed among the elite. The wizards and witches of the Shang courts were dismissed, and the educated began rejecting notions of the occult. The villagers, however, continued to believe in spirits. The change in attitude is apparent in the shift away from the demonologi cal paradigm in ancient Chinese medicine to a more systematic approach to cures. Schiffeler (1976: 26) demonstrates how the new idea was reflected in the changed etymology for the Chinese ideograph for yi (physician). The ancient</page><page sequence="8">32 I Margaret Chan character S comprises three ideas: an arrow in a quiver at top left, a hand drawing a bowstring at top right, and two dancing urn M female shamans or sorcerers below. The contemporary character is ft, where the shamans are replaced by the symbol M representing the medical amphora, with its two handles and narrow neck. This ideographic change is suggestive of the dis placement of the shaman curer by the secular herbalist-physician. The present-day simplified character for physician, yi IÜ, retains the notion of an arrow in a quiver and is a visual legacy of ancient medical beliefs in heal ing as a war upon demons. Up to Han times (206 bce to ad 220), it was held that demon attacks had to be repelled with arrows shot from a bow made of peach wood. Such a spell is prescribed in the zhiguai demonography recovered from a third-century bce tomb at Shuihudi, Hupei, and also in the Baize tu (Diagrams of White Marsh), a manual of demon lore, dating perhaps to the Six Dynasties (ad 220-589), in which Baize, a divine beast, tells the Yellow Emperor about the supernatural creatures in the world and describes ways to counter their attacks (Harper 1985: 491-493). Demonological Paradigm in Early Medical Texts Scholars are of the opinion that the belief that evils spirits caused illness only began to wane after the Han period, and then only among the educated (Bar end 2000: 132). All the pre-modern medical texts have a shamanistic base. The third-century bce Wushier Bingfang (Prescriptions for 52 Ailments) is held to be the earliest extant text of Chinese medical lore. Discovered in the Mawang dui archaeological site located in Changsha (tomb 3, burial date 168 bce), this treatise prescribes magical cures, including "[m]alediction, archery, flagella tion, magical entrapment, and demon inquisition," to treat ailments such as "bites, warts and swellings" (Harper 1985: 494). The Wushier provides clear proof of the shamanistic history of Chinese medicine. The discovery of the Mawangdui corpus has put to question the romantic notion of the mythic origins of two other ancient books. Dismissing earlier sug gestions that these works were written at the mythic dawn of Chinese civiliza tion, scholars now argue that the Shen Nong Ben Cao Jing (Shen Nong's Materia Medica Classic), considered the most ancient text on Chinese herbalism, and the Huangdi Neijing (The Yellow Emperor's Classic of Internal Medicine), which sets out the principal ideas of systematic medicine and acupuncture, were prob ably written after the Mawangdui burial date. One of the arguments proffered for the later dates of publication is the nascent move away, in the Shen Nong and Neijing, from the purely magical prescriptions of the Wushier. Notwithstanding this shift toward rationalism, demonology and the magic correspondence theories are still present in the two later texts. For example, in the Shen Nong the efficacy of herbal medicine is discussed in terms of demon slaying: "Tao Hua ... kills malign demonic influx ... Tao Xiao ... kills hundreds of ghosts and spiritual matters" (Kim 2001: 111).6 In the Neijing, the wind is described as an evil that attacks the veins and the five viscera, causing sickness (ibid.).</page><page sequence="9">Tangki War Magic | 33 Folk Medicine to Counter Demon Attacks Schiffeler (1976: 33) writes of the social distance between folk medicine and treatments based on learned medical treatises. The nobility had the services of well-read doctors, but the ordinary people still largely relied on religious heal ing. Benedict (1988: 140-142), in her discussion of the bubonic epidemic that raged through China in the nineteenth century, notes the popular belief that the plague was caused by the displeasure of gods or by witchcraft or ghostly magic. In descriptions reminiscent of the ancient nuo exorcism discussed earlier in this article, Benedict describes processions in Yunnan in which villagers rang bells, beat on gongs and drums, and discharged firearms to scare off demons. In Kunming, soldiers marched through the streets while striking at invisible demons with their swords. In Mengzi, soldiers assembled in front of the local yamen (government office) every evening to "fire salvos in all directions to scare away the evil spirits" (ibid.: 142). The firing of guns recalls the ancient sorcerer physician as a shaman shooting arrows at demons. Daoist Magic as Violent Confrontations with Demons War magic is hence the strategy for curing ills, according to Chinese folk belief. To this day, spirit-mediums use swords to behead demons, spells to summon spirit-soldiers, and charms to issue death threats to the demonic enemy. Writ ing about religious rituals in contemporary Taiwan, Boretz (1995: 93) notes that although the symbols of war magic "may seem quaint survivals of the imperial past, the weapons and blood are nevertheless real, the passion and violence tangible." A Han nuo incantation set out in the fifth-century Hou Han Shu (Book of Later Han), contains this malediction (Harper 1987: 263-264): Let all twelve spirits be charged to pursue the foul and baleful. Scorch your carcass. Pull apart your trunk and joints. Cut away your flesh. Rip out your lungs and guts. If you do not quickly depart, those who remain will be fodder. The brutal self-mortification practiced by tangkis follows in this violent tradition. Spirits may be insubstantial beings by Western conventions, but in Chinese popular imagination they have a real presence, and war against them is unflinchingly gory. Illustrations of the Chinese hell testify to this idea: sin ners have their limbs cut off or their bodies sawed in half or flayed. Yu (1987: 409) remarks: "Not only do the damned spirits or ghosts suffer as if they had bodies, but the instruments of their affliction are of material substance." The tangki has therefore to be a most indomitable spirit-general. Tangki Spirit-Generals in the Heavenly Emperor's Army The tangki is a warrior in the armies of Tiangong (the Heavenly Emperor). Initiation rituals include reporting at a Tiangong temple to enlist in the celestial</page><page sequence="10">34 I Margaret Chan army. The temple-keeper presents the tangki initiate with a registration cer tificate, a copy of which must be burned to dispatch it to heaven. The tangki is then given the regalia of office: a flag of command (ling qi), a seal of office (gong yin), and a ritual sword in a scabbard (bao jian, the Precious Sword), which symbolizes the tangki's license to kill demons. The tangki does not operate as a lone knight errant; he is a general at the head of spirit-armies. The parish of a temple is protected by the 36 celestial armies under the command of Bei Ji Shangdi (the North Pole Emperor, also known as the Emperor of the Dark Heavens). The spirit-power of Bei Ji Shangdi's command is imbued in the or leng, a large black flag that is emblazoned with the eight trigrams and other esoteric symbols. The black flag (see figs. 1.1 and 1.2) is not a mere symbol illustrating ideas of the 'black command'. It is held to be the very energy source of Bei Ji Shangdi, and offerings are made to it. The tangki has a covenant with Bei Ji Shangdi and his celestial armies and can call upon the assistance of the 'black command'. An or leng planted outside a shrine or temple is a sure sign that a tangki works within. The or leng must not be confused with other black flags. In the battle against the forces of evil, the tangki also calls upon the help of the 72 terres trial spirit-armies under the command of the Wu Fang Wu Se Shen Ling (Five Directions and Five Colors Spirit-Powers) who are represented by five colored Figure 1.1 Or Leng or Black Command Flag, Replete with Esoteric Meanings of Thunder and War Photograph ® Patrick Choo</page><page sequence="11">Figure 1.2 Or Leng Legend 1 3 2 4 S 6 10 12 13 16 17 1.

Although the elements of bravado and spectacle do enter into a tangki performance, the underlying motive has a theological basis. Tangkis pierce their bodies with swords and rods in order to take on the spirit-power imbued in these weapons: driven into the flesh, Photograph ® Victor Yue</page><page sequence="14">38 I Margaret Chan the weapons supercharge the tangkis with spirit-power. Tangkis also spill their own blood to make talismans. For this, the tangki will strike his head or back with a sword, axe, or mace. More often, the tongue will be cut (figs. 3.1 and 3.2) so that the oozing blood can be smeared on strips of yellow-colored paper. These talismans effect cures, acting not so much as medicines but as com mands to disease-causing demons to leave the patient. Thunder Magic Chinese talismans often relate to the power of thunder. The Chinese hold that thunder, not lightning, is the punishment that heaven metes out to evil-doers. The swirling and often jagged strokes with which talismanic ideographs of thunder are written might suggest the images caused by the natural phenom ena known as Lichtenberg figures, which are feathering, fernlike, or treelike displays that appear on a body that has been struck by an electrical discharge (Hammond 1994: 490). Thus, the writing on tangki talismans is less a lettered tradition and more a martial act, which possibly explains why many tangki talismanic scripts are barely legible scrawls. The punitive force of thunder is under the command of people who know the secrets of lei fa (thunder magic). The formulas for thunder magic found in manuals such as the twelfth-century Wang Wenqing Leishuo (The Thunder Discourse by Wang Wenqing) are all performance-based. As with all Daoist rituals, this involves dancing esoteric choreographies to music and incanta tions: the performer controls his breath in a specific manner and uses magical hand and finger gestures. The efficacy of thunder magic is clearly martial. In a spell set out in the Wang Wenqing Leishuo (cited in Reiter 2004: 227), the cor rect ritual performance summons the "rumbling emissaries of the thunders," the one million spirit-soldiers under the fire-bell generals, the stalwarts of the three heavens. The legions are armed with "crystallized halberds and battle axes." Evil spirits are smote by thunder to "cut their heads innumerable times and slice endlessly their bodies." Those evil-doers who obey the orders of the ritualist will be spared, but those who refuse to disperse will die (ibid.). The Big Dipper is the single most important element of thunder magic and other Daoist lore. Accordingly, many Daoist religious props, including the tangki's sword, are marked with the sign of the Seven Stars Constellation, the source of thunder magic. This comprises a series of dots joined by zigzag lines. Great magic is invoked when choreography, following the pattern of the Seven Stars, is danced using the limping yubu or yu step. The Dance of Yu Tangkis dance the yubu as a side-to-side stagger punctuated by a hopping on one leg. The heel-toe, heel-toe shuffle takes the tangki forward in a zigzag line. The magic properties of the yubu were formalized as early as the fourth century in the Baopuzi (The Master Who Embraces Simplicity), the earliest extant docu ment on Daoist magic. The yubu imitates the limping steps of Da Yu (Yu the</page><page sequence="15">Figures 3.1 and 3.2 A Singaporean Tangki Cuts His Tongue to Produce Blood to Make a Talisman Photographs ® Victor Yue</page><page sequence="16">40 I Margaret Chan Great), the legendary founder of the Xia dynasty, who, according to myth, saved China from a great flood through magic (Chan 2006: 85-86). It has also been recorded in the sixth-century bce Shangsha (The Esteemed Documents), also known as the Shujing (Classic of History), that Da Yu subdued the Miao tribes with his magical dance, allowing for the establishment of the proto-Chinese Xia dynasty (McCurley 2005: 141-142). That a sacred dance can mount a military campaign is also proposed by a second example: the Tang general Pei Min routed invading Turkic tribes by standing on top of his horse and performing the sword dance, "an art as appro priate to magicians as to warriors" (Teiser 1988: 442). Sacred choreographies as rituals of exorcism constitute the signifying feature of the performances of jiajiang (infernal spirit-generals) in Taiwan (see Sutton 1996, 2003). Thus, every performance element in the tangki repertoire is an act of war magic. The martial spirit may be overt in the bloody acts of self-mortification, but even by blowing out sprays of imbibed lustral water, the tangki is fighting off demonic attacks with qi (energy). Contemporary Tangki Ritual Theater: Reflecting a Diverse Society Contemporary tangki war magic in Thailand has absorbed Buddhist ideas of karma, manifested in 'bizarre' types of self-mortification that use instruments such as fluorescent light tubes, ceiling fans, and rods fixed with satellite dishes. These spectacular ideas have spread to other countries. In April 2007, a female tangki in Singapore, possessed by Nezha, pierced a bicycle through her face (fig. 4). Nezha is the central commander of the spirit-armies of the five direc tions, so his tangkis often perform the 'fiercest' self-mortification. The bicycle, however, cannot be explained in terms of Chinese popular religion or war magic lore, which decrees that weapons, not a utilitarian object like a bicycle, should be pierced into the body. A clue as to the provenance of this 'bizarre' self-mortification is that it was performed under the guidance of a Thai ritualist. Thai tangkis also took part in the same celebrations. One of them weighed down a rod pierced through his cheek with a ladder, the flags of the five spirit-armies, two banners, and other decorations (fig. 5). Reporting on tangki performances in Taiwan, Schipper (1985: 31) describes the tangki as the ti shen (replacement body) who "spills his blood in order that the village may live in peace." A finer point can be made by analyzing the 'bizarre' tangki self-mortification of the Thai vegetarian festival in terms of the Buddhist doctrine of karma. 'Bizarre' Self-Mortification and Buddhist Self-Sacrifice Benn (2007: 1-18) writes of a remarkable Chinese history of self-immolation. Beginning in the fourth century, there have been accounts of several hundred monks, nuns, and laypeople who made offerings of their bodies for a variety of</page><page sequence="17">Figure 4 A Female Tangki in Singapore with a Bicycle Pierced through Her Face Photograph courtesy of hoddermelvin.multiply.com</page><page sequence="18">42 I Margaret Chan Figure 5 A Thai Tangki Performing in Singapore "mm mm xtMfi ' Photograph courtesy of hoddermelvin.multiply.com reasons. Benn includes within the scope of self-immolation a variety of prac tices, such as offering the body to be fed upon by insects, slicing the flesh, burn ing incense upon the body, starving oneself, and auto-cremation (ibid.: 9-10). Benn (2007: 9) sees in the Chinese concept of sheshen (the abandoning of the body) a somatic strategy for the attainment of Buddhahood that he sug gests is inspired by the Lotus Sutra. This doctrine of Mahayana Buddhism pro poses that the carnal body is an impediment to enlightenment. Self-immolation in these terms is therefore "not aberrant, heterodox, or anomalous, but part of a serious attempt to make bodhisattvas on Chinese soil" (ibid.: 11). In this regard, I note the Sinicized legend of Guanyin, a woman who attained nirvana after she sacrificed her hand and eyes to help cure her sick father. Newlin (2008) considers the Chinese concept of abandoning the body to be culturally salient to an analysis of the rash of self-immolation by fire that took place in Vietnam between 1963 and 1975. Newlin's discourse brings the Chinese Buddhist idea of self-sacrifice to contemporary Indochina. These argu ments can be used to understand recent self-immolation events in Tibet. Writing on the 'philosophy of social charity' in Thai Buddhism, Kumar (2001: 70, 74) asserts that Thai Buddhism is focused on the notions of karma and rebirth and that it regards the practice of charity as the best way to live the religious life. Although Thai Buddhism derives from the Theravada school, KfKge^ if-it .i"\ i-n-nrmt'</page><page sequence="19">Tangki War Magic [ 43 Kumar notes the influence of Mahayana Buddhism. One Mahayana theory concerns the 'transfer of merit'. Bodhisattvas have an infinite store of merit, "acquired through many lives of heroic self-sacrifice," which can be drawn upon to short-circuit an unworthy individual's karmic path to rebirth in para dise (ibid.: 70-71). Kumar also writes that giving to others can redound to the credit of the donor. The greater the use that donees can derive from the gift, the more merit, in karmic terms, is earned by the donor. This principle, notes Kumar, has led to extreme acts of self-sacrifice (ibid.: 68-76). Conclusion: Tangki War Magic—Real and Relevant Although it is secondary to ideas of karma or the acquisition of spirit-power, the notion of performances of invulnerability is useful in an analysis of modern tangki self-mortification. We recall Norton's arguments of virtuality as needing to be 'enough' to move the audience to believe in the existence of an actuality. Lee et al. (2010: 56) write how contemporary society is now "culturally more diversified due to globalization and immigration." Health belief systems are also now multi-dimensional with the co-existence of biomedical and alterna tive healing therapies. In such a situation, they note, healers and patients may live in different local worlds. For healing to take place, there must be a meeting of the two parties in a common mythic world. In order to ensure that their war magic remains an existential reality, tangkis have had to adapt their ritual theater to make it relevant to a new generation of devotees. The doxa, which has been extended to include Buddhist ideas and contemporary instruments of self-mortification such as LED lights and satellite dishes, is now suitably contemporary. Singaporean tangkis have broadened their ritual theater to incorporate modern notions of medicine. Besides driving away demons of pestilence with weapons and magical flags, they also prescribe herbs, perform acupuncture and massage, and, as a matter of routine, refer patients to medical doctors. The tangki's war magic comprises the staging of a ritual theater of war between spirit-warriors and malevolent demons. The ritual is a phantasma goric space that the tangki and his devotees choose to enter in order to make meaning. The virtuality of tangki war magic, which presents spirit-warriors fighting for the community, assures devotees that their real, everyday life will be an actuality of pingan (peace and safety).
