<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE RELIGION OF SCIENCE. A RE religion and science indeed as contrary as they are often represented to be, and is the proposition to reconcile them a hopeless and futile undertaking ? Professor Jodl, in his article "Religion and Modern Science," (pp. 329-351 of this number,) says : ' ' That civilised humanity to-day is separated into two groups which no longer understand each other, which do not speak the same language, and which live in totally different worlds of thought and sentiment." There are those who cling to the old religions and those who supplant it by a new idealism. Between both, he adds : "A third class stands which plays the part of a mediator." Professor Jodl does not approve of reconciling the historical forms of religion with science. He rightly says : " The 'pure doctrine of Christ,' the genuine, primitive form of Christianity, is a Utopia of biblical criticism." We heartily agree with him in his remarks concerning the part which the miraculous and supernatural play in the Gospels : ' ' These things are so intimately interwoven with the modes of thought of the synoptic writers that it is impossible to separate them therefrom without doing vio lence to the internal connection of their doctrines." We also concur upon the whole with Professor Jodl in his criti cism of the methods of Speculative Theology. No compromising with traditional errors, no covering or extenuating of the results of historical criticism is allowable merely for the love of tradition and for the preservation of errors that have become dear to a large num ber of people.</page><page sequence="2">THE RELIGION OF SCIENCE. 353 We do not condemn the work of any mediator ; on the con trary, we rather encourage it. We observe with pleasure in the latest phases of the religious evolution of Speculative Theology the prevalence of a more modern spirit, and we follow with a keen in terest also the progress of biblical critique in its truly valuable labors : but we do not expect that either the one or the other will accomplish any regeneration of religion. Professor Jodl knows very well that the editors of The Monist and The Open Court have not undertaken any work of compromising between the errors of the past and the ideal of the future. Our idea of a reconciliation between religion and science is of a different nature. We are not blind to the errors of the old religions, and we do not mean to gloss them over, or to make old-fashioned views acceptable by presenting them in a new garment. We do not even stop to bury the dead, for we have better things to do than to trouble with problems that have been definitely settled. We keep our hands to the plough to accomplish the work needed to-day. While we are not blind to the errors of the old religions, we recognise at the same time that they contain in the language of parables some great truths which will remain forever. These truths constitute the backbone of religion, and we regard it as a very im portant duty of ours to preserve them. These truths must be pre served, not because they were believed in by our fathers, nor from any respect for tradition, nor from any regard for our sentiments, but simply because they are truths, because they can be proved to be true according to the methods of scientific inquiry. What is religion ? Religion consists of all those ideas which regulate our conduct. In the savage these ideas are very crude and superstitious, and often self-contradictory. The higher a man rises, the clearer, the more scientific and consistent do these ideas become, until they develop into a systematic world-conception. Every scien tific idea that changes our world-conception will change also our re ligion and with it our rules of conduct. Thus, for example, the idea of evolution has become to us an eminently religious idea. In order to indicate that the criterion of truth for religion is the very same thing as the criterion of truth for science, we have pro</page><page sequence="3">354 THE MONIST. posed to call the religion we advocate, "The Religion of Science." (For details see the editorial of Vol. VII, No. i, of The Open Court.') Our procedure appears to many as an annihilation of religion in favor of science. But it is not. And why not ? We have learned many truths first from religion, long before science could ever think of proving them. In several respects science took the lead, and religion remained at a long distance behind, awk wardly, very slowly, and unwillingly limping onward on the road of progress. Instances are, the acceptance of the Copernican system and of the evolution theory. But in other respects religion took the lead, and science was unable to follow its ingenious flight. As in stances of this we cite such moral truths as the love of enemies, which were not preached by scientists as scientific truths, but by religious teachers, by Confucius, Buddha, and Christ. There are scientists even to-day who regard what we would call "moral truths" as max ims that are contrary to the established views o science. Professor Huxley, for instance, is very emphatic in his declaration that the facts of nature do not teach morality.* This leads us to a point in which we disagree with Professor Jodl. He speaks of the illusion "of mingling together in the idea of God two wholly distinct ideas?the ideas namely of nature and of an ethical ideal"?an illusion to which "even strict monistic think ers like Spinoza fell victims." Professor Jodl's position reminds us of John Stuart Mill's "Essay on Nature," in which he exposes the old doctrine naturam sequi in all its absurd meanings and carefully avoids a discussion of the only rational conception of the precept. Thus his tirades ap pear most convincing, and to be sure they are quite correct?so far as they go. Says Mill : "In sober truth, nearly all the things which men are hanged or imprisoned for doing to one another, are nature's every-day performances. Killing, the most crim inal act recognised by human laws, Nature does once to every being that lives. . . "Nature impales men, breaks them as if on the wheel, casts them to be de voured by wild beasts, burns them to death, crushes them with stones like the first Christian mar.tyr, starves them with hunger, freezes them with cold, poisons them * For a discussion of this point see Fundamental Problems, pp. 219-226.</page><page sequence="4">THE RELIGION OF SCIENCE. 355 by the quick or slow venom of her exhalations, and has hundreds of other hideous deaths in reserve, such as the ingenious cruelty of a Nabis or a Domitian never surpassed." Mill must indeed have felt the need of beginning these sen tences with the words "In sober truth"; otherwise he might be suspected of humor. Similarly comical is Mill's proposition to regard every volun tary action of man as a direct infringement upon nature. Man's reason in that case would be the most unnatural phenomenon in the world, and the term "nature" would be confined to the lowest realms of existence exclusively. If the usage of reason were indeed an infringement upon nature, man's appearance upon earth would mark the beginning of a supernatural realm ; and Professor Jodl seems to accept this consequence when he says : " It is not of nature, it is above nature." If man's rationality and his ethics were not born of nature, if their conditions were not founded in the very existence of nature, if they were not the natural product of evolution, then indeed I see no escape from a dualistic world-conception, in which a supernatural God introduces the spark of divinity which appears in the soul of man from spheres beyond. We have devoted to these vagaries of John Stuart Mill an elaborate discussion in another place and do not feel the need of re peating our arguments in this connection.* We agree with Professor Jodl that no rationalising of old dog mas will help us in the establishment of "a new idealism, formed in harmony with the spirit of science." We must build our religion anew (as every generation had to build its religion anew) out of the best materials which are furnished by the maturest and most reli able knowledge of to-day. Says Professor Jodl : "Through us something has come into the world that before us did not exist something that the most exuberant creative magic, or nature's grandest mechanical * See the article in Nos. 239, 241, and 242 of The Open Court : Nature ana Morality.

The day on which first a human being pressed his weaker fellow-man to his breast and said, ' ' Brother, not mine, but thy will be done ; I will give up my desires that thou also mayst be glad " ; the day upon which man first lifted up his head and said, ' ' Let us make the world good in the likeness of the picture that has become living in us, just as it should be " ; this is the great and sanctified day in the history of our race on earth, the Christmas day on which God was born." Certainly the origin of man on earth, and again the evolution of the moral man, is something quite new, which before did not exist. But did humanity originate out of nothing, as sometimes the imaginations of a poet are supposed to be created, or is there a pro totype in whose image man has been created ? Man's reason, his ethics, and his humanity are something that did not exist before, but there is a feature in existence which makes it possible that ra tional and moral beings develop. Should there be sentient beings on other planets, and we have little reason to doubt it, we can be sure that they also will develop rational minds, and that they also will learn, perhaps as we did, through many bitter experiences, the same truths which constitute our main maxims of morality,* in cluding such precepts as the love of enemies. And why are we sure that on other planets not only reason, but also the fundamental rules of ethics will be the same as with us here on earth? Simply because we know that there is a certain feature in reality which creates rational beings and moral beings as naturally as it creates rocks and seas on the surface of planets. Man's reason and also man's morality are not original inventions of his, but the result of many experiences which he had to learn. And the world in which he lives is such that he can acquire reason and morality, and if a being should acquire a wrong kind of reason or a wrong kind of morality, it will by and by be blotted out of existence. Accord ingly there is a prototype of reason and of morality, and this proto type of the humanity of man is exactly that which in the language of the old religions has received the name "God." * I purposely cto not say all maxims of conduct, because we can very well imagine that different conditions may produce some very important variations in the rules of conduct ; but the main foundation of morality would be the same.</page><page sequence="6">THE RELIGION OF SCIENCE. 357 We must make a distinction between ideals and dreams. Those creations of our fancy which are woven without any regard to reality are dreams. They have no value beyond whiling away a leisure hour or pleasing our imagination. But those creations of our mind which construct realisable formations such as machines or clocks or higher conditions of human society, are not mere dreams, they are ideals. What, then, is the difference between a dream and an ideal? A dream is a useless ebullition of an idle brain composed of ideas to which there is no correspondent reality; but an ideal is a potent factor in the living presence to shape the future : it is a combina tion of ideas which are correct descriptions of actual realities. The moral aspirations of mankind are not empty dreams, they are true and veritable ideals. There are certain qualities in nature which make their realisation possible and these qualities constitute the Divinity of nature. Professor Jodl speaks of the origin of morality as of the birth of God on earth. Truly that is the meaning of Christianity.- But this birth of God into the world of human evolution as "the Son of Man " is possible only because of the existence of the God in nature whom Christian mythology so beautifully calls God the Father. The appearance of the Son of Man upon earth, the birth of morality, is a revelation of the divinity of nature. True enough, as Professor Jodl says, that we ourselves won the best and highest we have by hard struggles, by terribly severe, self imposed discipline. As Prometheus says : liHast dit nicht alles selbst vollendet, Heilig gl?hend Herzl " That, too, is part of the divinity of nature, that every creature has to work out it? very being itself, and that man must search for the way of salvation with great anxiety, under bitter tribulations and through extreme afflictions. But he cannot invent a new way of salvation, he has to find it, and there is but one that is the right one. The nature of morality is such as it is, and no other morality could be in vented to replace it. And this feature of existence which makes morality quite a determined thing is a real presence in the world, it is an actual quality of the universe.</page><page sequence="7">358 THE MONIST. Some of our liberal friends, foremost among them Professor Haeckel, deny the existence of a personal God and then proceed to declare that the God of science is nothing but matter and energy. We agree with Professor Haeckel in his rejection of anthropothe ism ; God is no supernatural being nor is he a huge world-ego. But we cannot accept his view of God as being only matter and energy. The idea of God is and always has been a moral idea. Thus we have come to regard all those features of nature as divine which condition the origin and existence of morality and we define God as the authority of moral conduct. This authority is not a person, not a sentient being, let alone a sentimental philanthropist ; but it is, nevertheless, a reality, and, indeed, a stern reality. Such is the God of science. God is that quality of existence through which we originated as feeling, thinking, and aspiring beings. He is the prototype of the human soul, and the condition under which develop man's reason and morality. Obedience to him is in dispensable for a continued existence, for further progress and a higher evolution of the human soul. That these features of reality can by a great number of keen and fearless modern thinkers be sup posed to be a non-entity is difficult to understand. This negation of the reality of qualities of existence which are not individual things but intrinsically inherent in all the individual things, it appears to us, is an old heirloom of nominalism. The nominalistic philosophy represented by Roscellinus was suppressed at the council at Soissons 1092, only to rise more powerfully in the fourteenth century in Wil liam of Occam, and finally to exterminate realism with all its rubbish of errors together with the truth contained in these errors. Kant marks in many respects the culmination of the victorious movement of nominalism. With all the benefits modern thought derived from the philosophical work of nominalism, a reaction is needed against its purely negative spirit. There is a truth in the old realism which cannot be neglected with impunity.* * There are two men at present who boldly fly the flag of the old realism again, both having our full sympathy in their aspirations, although we cannot agree with many of their teachings. The one is Mr. Charles S. Peirce, the other Dr. Francis E. Abbot.</page><page sequence="8">THE RELIGION OF SCIENCE. 359 God (viz., the name of God) is, as Kant said, a noumenon, a thing of thought, an abstraction. God is not a thing, a concrete ob ject, or an individual person. All the views of God which regard him as an individual being of some kind, or as a person only of in finite dimensions, are, closely considered, pagan notions which be little God. But the name of God as a noumenon, a thought, an abstract idea, has a meaning. Abstract ideas are not nonentities they represent some real features, some actual qualities, or proper ties, or relations ; otherwise they would not be ideas, but unmeaning sounds. Some of our abstract ideas are of a very delicate fibre, so that the coarse mental vision of the average Philistine is unable to see them in their reality and potency. But it so happens that exactly they are of a more important, more powerful, and inevitable presence than the simple generalisations of things that visibly and corporeally surround us. This, their peculiar nature, makes such ideas mys terious to those who instinctively feel their reality without being able to point it out and understand it. And the most subtle, im ponderous, and sublimated of all ideas is the idea of God. We have defined God as the ultimate authority of conduct, as the condition of our existence as rational and moral beings, as the all-power that enforces obedience, etc. ; but we cannot in any one of our definitions exhaust the significance of the idea. We would by no means exclude from the idea of God anything without which real ity would cease to be real. The qualities of matter and energy con stitute that element in the God-idea which justify the old religions in speaking of him as omnipotent and everlasting. Thus they ought not to be excluded. But these qualities alone are insufficient to characterise his being. The sum-total of matter and energy as such and as such alone does not constitute any moral authority. Nature in her immeasurable greatness and oppressive vastness affects us with awe ; but, after all, we look down upon her massive sublimity. Man is more than the biggest heap of crude matter and unintelli gently operating energy. Says Professor Jodl : ' ' We stand amazed at her might and greatness, at the plentitude of her powers of creation, at her myriad play of forces, at the inexhaustible wealth of the relations</page><page sequence="9">360 THE MONIST. with which she binds being to being., creates and mediates contrarieties, and amidst the most varied change and alternation, ever remains one and the same ! But our prototype, our God, she can never be." This grandeur of nature is part of her divinity, but it alone does not constitute the character of God. Yet, observe that throughout nature there is an imponderable quality present which makes every atom move in a definite way, so that the whirl of gaseous masses, apparently a chaos, will be recognised as a cosmic whole developing in a certain way and describable in what is generally called natural laws. This subtle quality is the condition of the regularities which are found in all the infinite varieties and innumerable particularities, and all these regularities conceived in their systematic unity are called the order of the universe. Man exists as a thinking being only because the immeasurable universe of which he is a part possesses this quality of order, and his reason is closely considered only a copy of it. Man's reason was shaped into the image of the cosmic order, and suppose?a supposi tion which is very difficult to make and regarded by many as impos sible or inconceivable?yet suppose that the world-order were radi cally different from what it actually is, man's reason would accord ingly be different too. Further, suppose that the whole frame and fundamental interrelations of the particles of reality were different from what they are, would not correspondingly the basic rules of conduct be changed too ? The author of this article, in the eyes of the so-called orthodox Christian, is most certainly an atheist. And if theism means the belief in a personal or extramundane God he is an atheist indeed. If there is any opprobrium in? the name atheism we are willing to accept it ; and certainly, we do not reject the label of atheism in order to escape any odium attached to that name. We do reject atheism simply be cause we see a great and potent truth in the idea of God which is but too often disregarded. With Professor Haeckel and Professor Jodl we reject the con ception of an anthropomorphic Deity. The anthropomorphic idol is doomed before the tribunal of science. But we see a deeper mean ing in the idea of God which has formed through millenniums the</page><page sequence="10">the religion of science. 361 very centre of the greatest religions on earth. Science has to recog nise the reality of an all-presence in existence which is analogous to that which in a religious language is called God. Considering the fact that humanity owes many great truths to religion, let us not be hasty in condemning the religions of the past as pure superstition. There are valuable seeds in the chaff. If we discard the wheat together with the tares, we shall have to redis cover them, for it is little probable that humanity can for any length of time be satisfied with beautiful phrases or live in its moral aspira tions in a realm of mere dreams.
