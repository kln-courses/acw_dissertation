<plain_text><page sequence="1">PREHISTORIC FIGURINES FROM CASTLE VALLEY By JAMES H. GUNNERSON â€¢ The author is Curator of the Museum of Anthropology at the University of Utah and Field Director of the Utah Statewide Archeoiogical Survey. In the past his work has been in the Plains, especially in western Nebraska. Since 1954 he has been working primarily with the Fremont Culture in northeastern and east central Utah. Mr. Gunnerson wishes to acknowledge the generosity of Mr. Homer Behunin who gave permission for the study of the figurines. This study was financed in part by the University of Utah Research Fund. From some Castle unusual Valley archaeological in east central specimens. Utah Among have come the some unusual archaeological specimens. Among the most interesting are three wooden figurines discovered by Mr. Homer Behunin. Castle Valley provides an appropriate setting for find- ing the unusual. Along its west wall erosion of the east face of the Wasatch Plateau has left ''castle towers" of crumbling gray stone. These lend an atmosphere of deca- dent antiquity, heightened wherever an occasional farm- stead affords the vivid contrast of poplars, cottonwoods and alfalfa fields. From the gray escarpment can be seen, to the east, other castle-like remnants carved by erosion from the rock of the San Raphael Swell. And between the Wasatch Plateau and the Swell lies Castle Valley itself, extending from Price to beyond Emery. It is nearly a desert land, relieved only at intervals by small streams which head on the plateau and flow across the valley, finally to join the San Raphael River or the Dirty Devil. For a few miles out from the plateau and in narrow canyons which finger into the cliffs, small streams provide fresh water and tillable land. In such areas is concen- trated not only the present population of Castle Valley but also the village remains of the prehistoric inhabitants. Mr. Behunin' s figurines were not associated with abo- riginal habitations, but were isolated finds. A pair of wooden katchina-like figurines (Figures 1 and 2) was found on the north side of Ferron Canyon, about a thou- sand feet up the valley wall, at the edge of a small plateau. There a crevice in an enormous split boulder had been walled up with stone, and the resulting enclosure had been filled with cedar bark. When the bark was removed the two figurines were the only objects found. They are carved partially in the round, but details of arms, breasts and facial features are outlined with grooves or are carved in low relief. The figurines were well smoothed except for the grooves, which still show striations. Both figurines are quite flat, only about two centimeters thick. The figure without a headdress (Figure 1) has mascu- line body proportions, but the breasts identify it as fe- male. It is reddish in color, especially on the face, breasts and arms, as though stained with red ocher. Its clothing consists of a pubic apron and a covering in back extending 137</page><page sequence="2">1. One of a pair of wooden figurines found near Ferron Creek, east central Utah. Front and back views are shown. The breasts identify the figure as female. Height 17.6 cm. 2. A wooden figurine (front and back views) found with that shown in Figure 1. The figure is presumed to be male since breasts are lacking. Height (without headdress) 15.8 cm. PREHISTORIC FIGURINES continued from the shoulders to well below the knees. Both garments are made of deer or antelope hairs (not parts of pelts) stuck on with a black gum which may be gilsonite. The hair on the back has a slight red stain on it. Arm bands are indicated by incision, the fingers and facial features by grooves. The other figurine (Figure 2) has body proportions suggestive of a woman, but it must be male as no breasts are depicted. The only clothing is a small pubic apron of hair similar to that on the companion piece. The eyes, smooth pieces of red stone, and the mouth, a smooth frag- ment of white stone, were cemented into depressions with pitch. The part of the hair or headdress which stands upright is of cedar bark, and the lighter colored strands around the head and hanging down the back are of an unidentified plant fiber. Both are held in place with pitch or gum. This figurine is much darker than its companion and shows no red stain or arm bands. The offset border surrounding the face of the first figurine and that across the top of the head of the second suggest katchina head- dresses. Both figures are too simple in detail to be com- pared with specific katchina dolls. At the base of the canyon wall on the south side of Ferron Canyon a third wooden figurine (Figure 3) was found wrapped in a reed mat which had been thrust into a protecting rock crevice. Although a pictograph panel occurs about a hundred feet away, there was no associated material. The site is near the upper end of the most in- tensively occupied portion of Ferron Valley. This figurine, which appears to represent a pregnant woman, was carved almost entirely in the round. The eyes are slits inlaid with small round pellets of a blue-green stone (not turquoise) . A hank of rather coarse black hair, probably human, was passed through a hole in the lower part of the back of the head and then braided. One rather baffling feature is the sagittal crest, which does not seem to represent any sort of hair style. All three figurines are made of a light-weight wood which was stained a dark color. All were made by a tech- nique of carving and scraping which has been observed on several specimens of Anasazi Basketmaker wood carving. An interesting figurine of fired clay, apparently repre- senting a pregnant woman (Figure 4), was also found 138</page><page sequence="3">3. Three views of a wooden figurine, probably representing a pregnant woman, found near Ferron Creek, east central Utah. The wood has a slightly oily texture. Height 20.9 cm. 4. Fired clay figurine representing a preg- nant woman, found five miles east of Fer- ron, Utah. Height 6.1 cm. 5. Carved stone figure, probably female, found about twenty miles southwest of Ferron. Front view at left, back view at right. Height 7.1 cm. 139</page><page sequence="4">6. Clay figurines (front view above, back view below), accidentally fired during the burning of a pit-house southwest of Ferron, Utah. Height of middle figurine 6.5 cm. (See Dee C. Taylor, "Archeological Excavations near Salina, Utah" in Utah Archeology 1, No. 4, pages 3-8.) PREHISTORIC FIGURINES continued near Ferron. In this greater emphasis than usual is placed on the sexual characteristics. Another figurine, probably female (Figure 5), came from about twenty miles south- west of Ferron. This specimen is carved from a coarse red stone. While the workmanship is crude, details such as hair are represented. Although these figurines were all found under uncon- trolled conditions, the technique of carving and the lack of evidence for the use of modern tools suggests that they are authentic. Their execution, though simple, is highly effective and leaves little doubt as to their indigenous origin. Because of the lack of associated material it is impossible to ascribe the wooden figurines to a specific aboriginal group. It seems probable, however, that they were made by the Fremont people, who occupied most of the archaeological sites in the area. This group occupied Castle Valley between ca. A.D. 800 and ca. 1200. They built numerous small but permanent villages and cultivated the then well-watered stream val- leys. They hunted and probably gathered wild foods. Their culture was either related to or strongly influenced by that of the Anasazi-Pueblo people who lived in the Four Corners area where Utah, Colorado, New Mexico and Arizona touch. Small anthropomorphic figurines were apparently an important element in the ceremonial life of the Fremont people. Most of their known figurines are of unfired clay. Five of these (Figure 6) were found in a Fremont pit-house during the University of Utah's 1955 excavation some thirty miles southwest of Ferron, and a group of eleven was found in a small cave on a branch of Range Creek Canyon (Noel Morss, Clay Figurines of the American Southwest [Cambridge 1954] pages 3-7) about sixty miles northeast of Ferron. It seems likely that such figurines may originally have been paired, since nearly equal numbers of males and females have been found in each group. This equal representation of males and females, the pairing of the wooden male and female found in the split boulder, and the indication of preg- nancy in the single female figures suggest that such figur- ines were used in ceremonies concerned with fertility. 140</page></plain_text>
