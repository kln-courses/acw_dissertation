<plain_text><page sequence="1">ROCK PAINTINGS OF LAGA GAFRA (ETHIOPIA) * PAVEL CERVICEK and ULRICH BRAUKAMPER The archaeological research expeditions of P. F. Azais and R. Chambard in the 1920ies located some rock painting sites in the Hararge Province of Ethiopia. Du- ring the following decades various sites were investigated by researchers of different nations, and their results, exclusively paintings - engravings are not yet known from that area - were fully published (cf. Breuil: 1934; von Rosen: 1949; Clark: 1954;Bailloud: 1963; Graziosi: 1964; Cervicek: 1971). Additional discoveries in various parts of Ethiopia, especially in Eritrea (Graziosi: 1 94 1 ; Franchini: 1951, 1952) and in the region of Dilla in the Governate General of Sidamo (Anfray: 1967) stimulated an increasing interest in this field of archaeological research1. During our sojourn in the region of Grawa (Gara Mullata) southwest of Harar in October 1973, we were informed by local inhabitants of sites of probable prehistoric significance. Also the administrative authorities of the sub-province ("auraja gezat") Gara Mullata showed a remarkable interest in and enthusiasm for an investigation concerning the history of that area. Hence, we succeeded in locating a rock-art site secluded ca. three hours walk from the auraja capital of Grawa in the deeply incised Gafra River Canyon. Grawa is situated at an altitude of 2300 meters on a plateau of sedimentary rocks consisting of Adigrat sandstone, Jurassic limestone, and cretaceous sandstone, and conglomeratic rocks, a geological formation, which extends eastward beyond the Gafra valley to the granitic basement in the Gobelli region (see map)2. The Gara Mullata Mountains, which are composed of basalt and basaltic tuff, reach an altitude of 3450 meters to the west and northwest of Grawa. From the edge of the Grawa plateau the Gafra escarpment sharply declines to a depth of ca. 1700 meters at the valley floor. On the high terrace of Grawa the primary forest, consisting mostly of the podocarpus and juniperus species, was largely eliminated and is now replaced by densely populated settlements. The escarpment to the Gafra valley, as far as it is not fully eroded, is covered by small bush-trees. The valley floor, which according to the Ethiopian classification already belongs to the lowland area (qolla), is intensively cultivated on partly irrigated and terraced fields with sorghum, mais, cat (catha edulis), potatoes, sweet potatoes, onions, tomatoes, sugar cane, mitmitta pepper, and bananas. A sufficient supply of necessary water and useful vegetation, formerly supplemented by an abundant fauna as well, can certainly be considered favourable ecological prerequisites for human settlement since early times. * Our research expeditions in Ethiopia in 1970/71 and 1972/74 were accomplished with the financial help of the German Research Association (Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft) to which we should like to express our deepest gratitude. For the drawings we are indebted to Gisela Wittner, Frobenius Institute. Werner Lange, Frobenius Insitute, was so kind to correct the English text. 1 Photos of rock paintings trom the Harar/ Dire uawa area are siorea in me venire oi louriMn in Addis Ababa, and for purposes of public relations a postcard showing one of the paintings was printed. 2 Schottenloher: 1939, 275.

It faces northeast and has an altitude of almost 1 800 meters above sea level. The area of the site is part of the Gafra Golla Dofa village, and the indigenous Ala Galla call it Gada Ba'la ("large shelter"). Like all of their statements regarding any prehistoric site of ruin of stone-built necropoles, houses and walls, remarkably frequent throughout Northern Hararge3, the present population ascribe the rock paintings indiscriminatingly to the "Harla". According to popular beliefs Harla generally refers to a mysterious, wealthy and mighty people, (frequently even imagined as giants!), who had once occupied large stretches of the Harar Province before they were destroyed by the supernatural powers through natural catastrophies as punishment for their inordi- nate pride4. This occurred prior to the Galla (Oromo) incursions into these areas during the 16th and 17th centuries. The pronounced tendency of contemporary populations to ascribe all material cultural accomplishments not explicable to them, to those previous populations of whom little more than an authentic or a fictitious name is remembered, is by no means a unique phenomenon. In Eritrea, for instance, the ancient people of the Belu is considered as creator of the rock paintings5. Another very small and narrow rock-shelter is situated some hundred meters away on the opposite escarpment of the Gafra valley. Local informants also categorically identified human skeleton fragments and pottery sherds found there to be relics from the Harla period. It was not possible for us to precisely classify either these items or the pottery sherds from the surface of Gada Ba'la rock- shelter6. The wall of the shelter on which the paintings were applied in reddishbrown colour extends to about sixty meters and is now so weather-worn and crumbled that also some of the paintings have been damaged. The groups of figures shall be described from east to west in the following catalogue. 3 Azais/Chambard: 1931; Joussaume: 1971; Joussaume: 1973. 4 The name "Harla" is first mentioned, as for as we know, in the chronicle of the Ethiopian Emperor 'Amda Seyon in the 14th century (Huntingford: 1965, 74) and is occasionally referred to in some later documents. As far as it can be reconstructed by our historical field enquiries, the Harla most probably represented an Islamized population of mixted Harari/Somali stock which partly survived in the ethnic body of the Galla conquerors - a fact which can mainly be demonstrated by clan names and various oral traditions. 5 Franchini: 195 1, 123. The Belu were a people which immigrated trom Arabia in the bth and 7th centuries A. D. and played an important role in the history of Eritrea. Another example of this kind involves the numerous stone stelae of East and South Ethiopia which the present populations indiscriminatingly ascribe to the Islamic conqueror Ahmad b. Ibrahim, nicknamed Gran ( 1 1543). 6 The fragments of pottery from the sites of Laga Gafra which seem to be of more or less recent origin were left with Dr. R. Wilding, archaeologist at the University of Addis Ababa, for further investigation.</page><page sequence="4">50 Pavel £ervicek and Ulrich Braukamper Catalogue of the paintings1 Fig. 1.

The paintings of the Laga Gafra rock shelter seem all to be of the same age. They represent a new, hitherto unknown rock art site characterized, like a number of known rockpain tings sites in the Hararge province of Ethiopia, by the cattle representations in the so-called Ethiopian- Arabian style8 (Fig. 4, 7, 9), which also occur in the Hidjaz, Central Arabia, Eritrea, Southern Ethiopia, and sporadically as far west as Algeria and as far south as Botswana9. On Fig. 1 , we meet the cow-and-calf motif recurring in Laga Oda10, Genda- Biftu (Surre)11 (both sites in the Hararge province), Chabbe (Southern Ethiopia)12, 7 The introductory part of this article has been compiled by U. Braukamper who documented the rock paintings of Laga Gafra on the spot in October 1973. He delegated the material to the co-author for cataloguing and evaluation given below. 8 As defined by Cervfcek: 1971a, b; 1973; 1974, 185. 9 Id.: 1974, 185, note 728. 10 Id.: 1971b, Fig. 14, 19,40,42. 11 Breuil: 1934, Fig. 7. 12 Anfray: 1967, Fig. 1.</page><page sequence="5">Rock paintings of Laga Gafra 5 1 Eritrea13, in the rock art of the Nubian14 and Libyan15 deserts. It has been noted that these cattle representations show affinities with the material culture16 and the art17 of the Nubian C-group peoples who probably moved into Nubia from the Libyan desert in the 3rd millenium B. C. Fig. 4 includes pictures of bovids in the above-mentioned style with vertical stripes in the central part of the body. These correspond to some rock engravings of the Southern Hidjaz, Nubian desert, Nile valley and the Sahara18. They are remi- niscent of a cow ornamented with a bead band around its body, engraved on a bronze cow-bell from Meroe pyramid N. 1 519 or of modern burnt ornaments of cattle applied by East African cattle breeders20. The schematic anthropomorphic figures, often marked as men by hypertrophied phalli (Fig. 4, 6, 7), find an analogy on the rock paintings of Sollum Ba'atti (Mai Aini) in Eritrea21 and, to an extent, at Laga Oda22, Wyboer23 (both Hararge pro- vince) and in the Bwanjai rock shelter, Bukoba district, Tanzania24 . Graziosi linked them with the human figures of the East Spanish rock art of the Mesolithic, and of the post-Mesolithic periods of the Iberian Peninsula (Spanish Art Group III)25. Representations of the fat-tailed sheep (Fig. 7 below, Fig. 8 ? ) are sometimes associated with the bovid pictures in the "Ethiopian-Arabian" style26. Anati suggests the 2nd millenium B. C. for the domestication of this animal in Arabia; after Sergew, sheep were brought to Ethiopia by the South Arabians - their first immigration took place before 1 ,000 B. C.27. Characteristically, humped cattle were depicted only in most recent, conventio- nalized series of the Ethiopian- Arabian style (Fig. 9,7? )28. As to the oblong object on Fig. 3 and 6, it can be compared with the serpent- like engravings superimposed on a bovid picture at Magal Hodein or to the propeller-like object in juxtaposition with dancing ithyphallic men at Gait el-Aguz (both sites in the Nubian desert)29. The open rectangle, depicted isolated on Fig. 2, and in the hand of the man on Fig. 1 0, is paralleled not only in the Hararge province at Laga Oda30 but also at 13 Coulbeaux: 1928, Fig. 9; Graziosi: 1964, Fig. 4.

A similar sign is known as an AKSumne quarry mar* (Littmann: 1913, 55, Fig. 1, 16, 36, 43, 53, 57; 44: in superposition with a cross) and is found in Sharab, Southern Upper Egypt, juxtaposed to signs of the Early Christian era (Cervicek: 1974, Fig. 424, 438). 30Cervicek: 1971b, Fig. 35.</page><page sequence="6">52 Pavel Cervicek and Ulrich Braukamper Amba Focada (Eritrea)31 and in the rock art of the Nubian desert32. This symbol goes back to the pottery decoration of the Nubian A-group33, is frequent as an Aksumite quarry mark34 and still survives as an Arabic tribe and camel mark35. It also occurs in juxtaposition with Arabic graffiti in the Hidjaz36 and as a rock engraving in Kordofan37. In Western Libya, when engraved on palimpsest rocks, it belongs to the supreme level of engravings with the lightest patina which corresponds to that of Arabic graffiti at the same site38. 31 Graziosi: 1941, 64, Fig. 2; Mordini: 1941, Fig. 12. A rock painting here shows a big open rectangle held by a small male anthropomorphic figure. Other two men in the same picture hold closed rectangles - symbols known from the Nubiaji A- and C-group potteries; they also occur in the rock art of Southern Upper Egypt, cf. Cervicek: 1974, 197, Fig. 337 (Magal Hodein), 422, 47 1 (Sharab - in the last picture juxtaposed to 3 "orants"), and of the Fezzan (Ziegert: 1969, Fig. 51). Similar signs, when associated with drawings of wild animals, have been interpreted in the Saharan rock art as traps (Huard - Leclant: 1973). 32 Cervicek: 1974, Fig. 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 9, 34, 204 (juxtaposed to a bovid in the "Ethiopian- Arabian" style), 205, 424, 428, 441, 446, 454, 490 (associated with a cross). An analogous implement, more triangular in shape, is held by men or situated on the backs of bovids on the Karora (Northern Eritrea) rock paintings, see Vigliardi Micheli: 1956, 198 f., Fig. 5-8; Graziosi: 1964, Fig. 9. It can be compared with the "wings" of the Meroitic adorned cow mentioned above (Shinnie: 1967, Fig. 50). 33 Griffith: 1921, PI.
