This article uses critical discourse analysis (CDA) to discuss the relationship between such models in policy documents produced by The Norwegian Federation of Organizations of Disabled People (FFO). Analysis of key topoi in the policy documents shows that they display elements of both social and medical discourse, and that the consequences of medically defined impairments are used as justifications for policy interventions in a framework of social justice. While a strict version of the social model is adopted in general programmatic documents, arguments about specific policy fields conceptualize disability as a property of individuals - traditionally, a medical model framing. Analysis of topoi is shown to be a useful tool when CDA is applied to policy texts. KEY WORDS: critical discourse analysis, disability, medical model, mystification, NGO, Norway 1. Introduction Throughout much of modern history, disability has been understood primarily in medical terms. Medical diagnoses have provided grounds for clinical and therapeutic interventions, but they have also formed the basis of action in other social fields, for example, by legitimizing the payment of welfare benefits, but also policies of institutionalization and segregation. In the latter half of the 20th century, however, particularly in the United States and Britain, the dominant role of medicine in the construction of disability was openly challenged. The challenges frequently took the form of alternative conceptual models conveyed in politicized discourse. In the US, a minority model in which disabled people were seen as analogous to politically oppressed ethnocultural groups (Hahn, 1996) was advanced. Similarly, a social model of disability was developed</page><page sequence="2">3o6 Discourse Studies 11(3) in Britain in order to highlight the disabling aspects of current socioeconomic arrangements (Oliver, 1990). A central feature of the disability field has been debates over discourse and representation. Classical medical models of disability have been subjected to a series of challenges over their mystification of environmental factors and social institutions (Barnes et al., 1999; Corker and French, 1999). Conversely, the social model has been criticized for being conceptually untenable and for lacking clear policy implications - in and for mystifying the role of the body (Crow, 1996; Samaha, 2007; Wendell, 1996). This motivates the need for research into the kind of discourse that is being used in the disability field. In effect, the negotiations between medical and social models are understood as conflicts in which medical and social discourse are mutually exclusive (Shakespeare, 2006). This article is a critical discourse analysis of the interaction between social and medical discourse within the particular context of policy documents produced by a Norwegian NGO, The Norwegian Federation of Organizations of Disabled People (FFO). It is also a critique of the way in which some CDA methods have been employed in the disability field. I aim to show that while medical knowledge alone cannot provide a satisfactory account of disability, neither has the language of socioeconomic oppression or ethnocultural discrimination been capable of producing a true alternative. In practical policy texts, the medical perception of disability as a property of individual people is being integrated, by means of topoi (argumentative warrants) of compensation and amelioration, into a discourse where the social model defines the overarching goals. The article consists of five parts. Following this introduction, the second part presents the corpus under discussion, establishes the research goals, and dis cusses the role of topoi in CDA. The third part presents some recurring elements of medical models in what is ostensibly sociopolitical discourse. The fourth part discusses the implications of these findings for disability studies. The fifth part discusses the emerging disability discourse and suggests further research. 2. Research object, corpus and methodology1 2.1 RESEARCH OBJECT: FFO'S POLICY DISCOURSE At the time of writing, Norway is in the process of adopting a new piece of legislation, The Discrimination and Accessibility Act. The act follows an international trend in which disability is defined as a matter of discrimination - a key element of social model discourse. Bills of varying scope and strength have been introduced in a number of countries and territories since the United States adopted the Americans with Disabilities Act in 1990, including Australia (1992) and the United Kingdom (1995). Simply put, more attention is being paid to causes of disability that are external to individual bodies. The United Nations, in its Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (ratified by 41 countries, signed by 136), recognizes that; [. . .] disability is an evolving concept and that disability results from the interaction between persons with impairments and attitudinal and environmental barriers that</page><page sequence="3">Crue: Critical discourse analysis, topoi and mystification 307 hinders their full and effective participation in society on an equal basis with others. (United Nations, 2007) The spread of sociopolitical definitions may suggest that a major shift away from medical knowledge is occurring in disability discourse. This article is an attempt to investigate that hypothesis in one particular case. The Norwegian Federation of Organizations of Disabled People (hereafter, FFO) is the most politically signifi cant Norwegian disability NGO, and it is strongly committed to a sociopolitical view, defining disability in terms of human rights and discrimination: FFO bases its definition of disability on the understanding of disability as a conflict be tween the capabilities of the individual to function and the demands for function made by the surroundings. [...] The conflicts, or matters of discrimination, are experienced differently by different individuals, but are united by the fact that they affect aspects of life taken for granted by most people. [...] The relations of conflict faced by disabled people therefore centre on the basic interests of human being - human rights.2 FFO is an umbrella organization, which represents (as of 2008) 70 member organizations that collectively contain about 300,000 members. A major part of its brief is to coordinate the policy interests of these member organizations in negotiations with government agencies. The main question I'm asking is: which argumentative stance does the federation adopt on a day-to-day basis? In other words: how is disability defined in its policy discourse? Are sociopolitical and medical criteria mutually exclusive in practical argumentation? 2.2 CORPUS: GENERAL AND SPECIFIC POLICY DOCUMENTS The primary corpus was selected in order to provide data about the justification of arguments, and about the interaction between different forms of knowledge in policy documents. The texts fall into two main categories: a) General policy documents, consisting of FFO's official definition of disability (hereafter, the Definition) and its program as of 2006-7 (hereafter, the Program). b) Specific policy documents, consisting of 92 consultative statements written in response to legislative initiatives in the period 2005-7. The consultative statements break down according to the policy fields shown in Table 1. The leading categories are health, accessibility, independent living and education (a total of 61 out of 92 texts). With the exception of independent living, which includes technical aids and personal assistance, these areas are not exclusively or even particularly relevant to disabled people taken as a group. For example: • Accessibility includes topics such as universal design, a design standard which is generally acknowledged to benefit a wide section of any given population. • Education and Health include topics that are relevant to people with various illnesses and impairments, but also discussions about biotechnology and medical research that are of general ethical relevance.</page><page sequence="4">3o8 Discourse Studies 11(3) TABLE 1.

In each of its consultative statements, therefore, FFO faces the challenge of establishing, making relevant and defending the interests of disabled people in the context of a particular political issue. Whether it does this by invoking the same social model justifications as in its general policy documents is of major interest to the analysis. 2.3 METHODOLOGY: CRITICAL DISCOURSE ANALYSIS AND TOPICAL ANALYSIS Much of the concern with discourse in the disability field comes from the fact that the word 'disability' is ambiguous as regards causation. Different causal models are strongly linked to different discourses. While most definitions specify the condition of being disabled as lacking the ability to do something, that lack of ability may be considered as, variously, 1) a restriction, 2) a disadvantage or 3) an inability. The range of specifications progresses from 1) something imposed (socially, environmentally or politically) from without, via 2) something more akin to a predicament or situation, to 3) something (medically) intrinsic to an individual, and so implies different remedies. The controversy over what policies to adopt has often taken the form of argu ments over words. As one example, there has been extensive debate over whether 'people with disabilities' or 'disabled people' is the preferred usage. In the disability field, as in critical discourse analysis (CDA), language is seen as both a symptom and cause of social change (for the CDA position, see Fairclough, 2005 ; Fairclough et al., 2007; Wodak and Chilton, 2005; Wodak and Meyer, 2001). There is a tradition of applying the methods of CDA in disability studies. A classical example is the British sociologist Mike Oliver's rephrasing of survey questions: [. . .] used in the 1990 OCPS Disability Surveys with the social model approach he preferred. For example, instead of asking 'What is wrong with you?' (medical model), Oliver offers 'What is wrong with society?' (social model). (Shakespeare, 2006: 28) This directs attention to social constraints instead of intrinsic properties (Oliver, 1990). Medical survey discourse is here criticized for mystifying or obscuring 2005 2006 2007 Total Organizational life - 3 3 6 Youth 3 - 2 5 Accessibility 7 6 7 20 Independent living 5 5 4 14 Education 5 1 4 10 Europe 1 - - 1 Working life 1 - 5 6 Welfare 1 2 - 3 Health 7 11 9 27 Total 30 28 34 92</page><page sequence="5">Grue: Critical discourse analysis, topoi and mystification 309 the agency of disabling factors of society and the environment; while discourse that frames disability as intrinsic properties of individuals encourages solutions such as medical intervention and compensatory benefits, discourse that pre sents disability as a product of environmental factors encourages systemic solutions - for example, the introduction of universal design standards and anti-discrimination measures. In later years, however, critics of the social model have, in turn, argued that it mystifies the bodily aspects of impairments - such as pain and fatigue (Wendell, 1996). A shared objective in the disability movement, however, is social justice. Since disabled people generally suffer lower rates of employment and lower living standards than non-disabled people, the identification and use of discourse forms that will effectively promote social change has been a primary goal. A more nuanced application of CDA methods in the disability field may clarify how elements of superficially different ideological positions interact. Mystification analysis, in particular, is somewhat unsuited to this purpose because it is geared towards exposing covert ideological bias in supposedly neutral newspaper texts by highlighting absences (O'Halloran, 2005). Given that an ideological shift seems to be taking place in the disability field, one in which medical definitions are being replaced by sociopolitical ones in key political and legal documents, démystification seems less relevant than the analysis of how arguments are justified in specific cases - of how new grounds for policy action are being established. In order to discuss these grounds, I invoke the concept of the topos (plural topoi). A topos is both a place of common knowledge (cf. commonplace) and a con clusion rule or warrant that may be invoked in discourse interpretation. In CDA, the topos has been developed, with an emphasis on its 'warrant' aspect, by Ruth Wodak and others (Wodak and Meyer, 2001; Wodak and Pelinka, 2002; Wodak and Van Dijk, 2000). It is described as linking particular arguments to reader background knowledge - doxa - of the kind that documents such as the UN Convention mentioned above seek to establish. Wodak presents topical analysis as a way of discovering the hidden premises of argument: Within argumentation theory, 'topoi' or 'loci' can be described as parts of argu mentation which belong to the obligatory, either explicit or inferable premises. They are the content-related warrant or 'conclusion rules' which connect the argument or arguments with the conclusion, the claim. As such, they justify the transition from the argument or arguments to the conclusion. (Wodak and Meyer, 2001: 74; emphasis added) Thus: 1 ) A topos is that which justifies a line of argument, but requires less justification itself because it is anchored in common attitudes or doxa. 2) Topoi, being rules of inference, are tied more strongly to concepts than to words. The same topos can potentially be phrased in numerous ways, and so extraction of topoi will necessitate rewording.</page><page sequence="6">Discourse Studies 11(3) Topical analysis, then, is a method for explicating the link between particular policy debates and justifications that are grounded in the general political climate. In discussing the following passage from 'Austria First', a petition by the far-right FPÖ party, Wodak invokes the general topos of 'burden', which she specifies as the following conditional: if a person, an institution or a country is burdened by specific problems, one should act in order to diminish these burdens. That entails the following policies: The adoption of a federal law to change the law governing the organization of schools so that the proportion of pupils in compulsory and vocational school classes whose native language is not German is limited to 30 per cent; where the percentage of children whose native language is not German is higher than 30 per cent, regular classes for foreigners are to be established. (Wodak and Meyer, 2001: 85) By appealing to the doxa or assumed knowledge of the model reader, topoi both strengthen the argument and suggest the dominant ideology of the com municative context. Topical analysis will produce topoi that form shapes on the map of ideology or doxa. To evoke and use the topos groups or clusters of topoi that are drawn on in FFO's discourse, then, is to present the way in which the federation finds that disability should be understood. Here is an example of a policy recommendation from the Definition: A new and important contribution [...] would be the implementation of a law against the discrimination of disabled people.3 How is this warranted? The reader has to assume, at the very least, that disabled people are in fact objects of discrimination, which means that FFO relies on such an assumption in the reader's doxa. We do not find this warrant in the text, but it's a necessary inference if the above argument is to be rhetorically effective. We are now ready to reframe the three conceptual definitions of disability as restriction, disadvantage or inability as topoi. I will follow Wodak in phrasing them as conditionals: 1) If a problem is caused by restriction, one should act in order to remove the restricting factors. 2) If a problem is caused by disadvantage, then one should act in order to ameliorate or compensate for the disadvantage. 3) If a problem is caused by inability, then one should act in order to remedy the inability. Topical analysis highlights the rhetorical aims of discourse. The rhetorician Jonas Gabrielsen has suggested that the introduction of topoi through syllogisms has long been a crucial stage in argumentation: To say that the minor premise is the centre of application and naming, is to say that it is in the minor premise that the perspectives on the issue are established. The minor premise, in other words, is the centre of the topical and rhetorical choice. Specifically, it is in the minor premise's conjoining of subject (i.e. case circumstances) and predicate (i.e. topos) that the specific circumstance, through naming, is applied to a particular topos instead of another, potential, topos. Whether Socrates is, under</page><page sequence="7">G rue : Critical discourse analysis, topoi and mystification 311 particular circumstances, treated as a person, a man, a Greek, a citizen or an adult is not determined by the case itself. It is determined by the rhetor. While logic is a matter of valid relations and conclusions, topic is a matter of choosing a persuasive perspective. (Gabrielsen, 1999: 35, author's translation from the Danish; emphases in the original)4 That is, the minor premise warrants the major premise and makes it relevant to the case. In being assumed rather than being mentioned explicitly, topoi resemble presuppositions. Two paragraphs from FFO's definition of disability discuss human rights: The conflicts, or matters of discrimination, are experienced differently by different individuals, but are united by the fact that they affect aspects of life taken for granted by most people. Most people take the right to determine the contents and rhythm of daily life as a matter of course, along with the right to free movement, the right to live where one chooses, and the right to education and work. The relations of conflict faced by disabled people therefore centre on the basic interests of human being - human rights.5 The final sentence is in the form of a conclusion. The conflicts are (i.e. FFO thinks they should be seen as) a human rights issue. The conclusion is supported by examples (that can be backed by data from other texts). Disabled people experi ence conflicts in various areas of life. These examples are meaningless, however, unless the reader accepts a topos that relates the lack of self-determination in key life areas and the lack of human rights (e.g. 'If self-determination is lacking, human rights are being violated'). In other words, such a topos belongs to the doxa of FFO's target readership. Topoi relate to doxa, and sufficiently large clusters of topoi might equally well be termed ideologies. Viewed from a great height, topoi constitute reference points in an ideological map. (A branch of rhetorical inquiry has attempted to document a geometrical strain in the etymology of the topos, strengthening the landscape/map interpretation, but the attempt has been largely unsuccessful - see Eide, 1997, for a brief summary. Nevertheless, the topical landscape or space is a rich interpretive metaphor - see for example Aslaug Nyrnes's 2002 study of didactic topoi in the work of Danish-Norwegian author Ludvig Holberg [1684-1754]). The figure of the topical landscape also reminds us of the word's etymological origin (gr. 'place'). In the case of FFO, there are documents in the corpus that describe disabled people as members of an oppressed minority and others that approach them as medical patients with chronic illnesses. When these documents are analyzed in terms of opposing ideological positions, as conforming either to a social or a medical model, it can be argued that one or the other definition is mystifying. Topical analysis instead directs attention to how multiple ideological positions translate to policy. This goal is in direct keeping with Wodak's understanding of the topos as an inference or conclusion rule, and with its history as a warrant when seen in the light of argumentation theory. Syllogistic or deductive reasoning is problematic</page><page sequence="8">312 Discourse Studies 11(3) in practical argumentation because of its insensitivity to context. Given the right premises, the conclusion becomes inevitable, but all of the premises cannot be made explicit. It is therefore more interesting to ask what warrants a rhetorical agent frequently bases arguments on. Practical argumentation works not by laying out a series of deductive steps, but by furthering supportable claims, as demonstrated in Stephen Toulmin's classic The Uses of Argument. Although he does not mention topoi specifically, Toulmin's definition and use of warrants serve a similar purpose: [A] warrant (W) is itself neither a datum (D) or a claim (C), since it implies in itself something about both D and C - namely, that the step from the one to the other is legitimate [...] (Toulmin, 1958: 93-4) The form of Toulmin's warrants is generally that of inference or conclusion rules, for example, A man born in Bermuda will generally be a British subject'. I include Toulmin's definition also because it suggests the need for a topos- or warrant-like category when discussing argumentative (e.g. policy) discourse. As for labeling that category, I believe that topos is preferable to warrant for two reasons: 1 ) The inference rules I'm looking for are highly sensitive to context and subject. Whether the use of a topos is legitimate or not is a question that cannot be explored on a general or universal basis, as is often the case in argumentation theory in the Toulmin tradition. The etymology of the topos, suggesting a particular place, emphasizes this. 2) Topoi are interrelated. While warrants are sometimes treated as algorithmic elements, entering the argumentative process at predetermined points, topoi, again true to their etymology, may be seen as part of a landscape or space which produces and is produced by discourse. In terms that were originally proposed by Aristotle, saying that a topos is that under which many enthymemes fall can be paraphrased so that a topos is the place from which many arguments originate. Correspondingly, an ideology may be defined either as that under which many topoi fall, or the mental terrain in which different topoi may be located. We thus find the topos at the intersection between rhetoric, argumentation theory and discourse analysis. The topos may be used as an analytical tool in the exploration of the discourse employed by, the rhetorical point of, and the argu mentative structures in a particular text or texts. It contributes the analytical level above the sentence, but below that of a whole discourse. 3. Analysis: key topoi in Norwegian disability discourse 3.1 CONFLICTS OF DISCOURSE IN THE DISABILITY FIELD A defining feature of the disability field, as noted above, is the adversarial relation ship between sociopolitical and medical definitions of disability and disablement. The definitions have been treated as being contradictory partly because they originated in very different fields, respectively medical institutions and activist</page><page sequence="9">Grue: Critical discourse analysis, topoi and mystification 313 communities. An illustrative example is Britain in the 1970s (as presented by the disability scholar Tom Shakespeare): The legend of the British disability movement creates a year zero - 1976, the pub lication of the UPIAS Fundamental Principles of Disability - and a strict dichotomy - medical model versus social model. [...] Until someone has done systematic historical research, it is only possible to unearth tantalising clues to pre-1975 social-contextual approaches. For example, Irving Zola cites research by William Frey which demonstrates that, as far back as 1958, the American Medical Association was differentiating between impairment and disability: the former was generally regarded as a medical judgement call whereas the latter was defined as an administrative issue relating to 'the interaction between the impairment and a host of non-medical factors such as age, sex, educational level, economic and social environment'. (Shakespeare, 2006: 14, 19) This quote illustrates two key issues in disability discourse. The first is the com plex interaction of numerous factors in shaping disability at any given historical moment. (For a survey and discussion of different cultural constructions of disability, see for example, Snyder and Mitchell, 2006.) The second is the cur rently hostile ideological climate, in which social and medical models have been viewed as mutually exclusive. There are historical reasons for this development. Mike Oliver, whose work was mentioned previously as central to the development of Disability Studies in general and the British social model in particular, argued that the dominant model of disability in Western society since the beginning of industrial revolution and the prevalence of wage labor was one of personal tragedy - of being unable to work because of a medical condition, rather than, say, the way early industrial enterprises were organized. Oppositional discourses in which disability was re framed as a form of social oppression imposed on people with impairments was a matter of combating negative and influential discourse structures. The social model became important in activist and academic circles, and for good reason. At its most eloquent, it appeared to amount to a coherent and liberating explanation of disability, which would allow for and justify social and political change, with a potentially significant impact on the lives of dis abled people. As the disability scholar Tom Shakespeare points out, however, some versions of the social model presuppose rather than document the existence of a wholly reductionist medical model. Some extreme formulations of the social model argue that the form of oppression termed 'disablement' is 'nothing to do with the body' (Oliver, 1996:35). Over the years, the social model accrued a form of discourse in which it is deemed inappropriate or counterproductive to discuss impairment specific approaches, because: [...] disabled people share a common experience of oppression, regardless of impair ment - just as black people share a common experience of racism, regardless of ethnic origins - [and] to organise or analyse on the basis of impairments becomes redundant. (Shakespeare, 2006: 31)</page><page sequence="10">3H Discourse Studies 11(3) The adversarial view is not the only one, however. In Norway, a relational con ception of disability that incorporates both medical and social elements has arguably been in use for decades: In 1967, a Norwegian White Paper argued that there was a need to shift focus in disability policy: not solely to address how to change disabled people so that they cope better in their environment, but also the other way around, to change the environ ment to fit people with impairments (Stortingsmelding, 1966-1967) [... | in Norway, disability has been defined [in a 1990 government's action plan] as 'a mismatch between the person's capabilities and the function demands of the environment'. (Tossebro, 2004: 3-4, emphasis in original) Terminology that cannot be convincingly identified with a medical model or personal tragedy view has thus been visible in some public spheres for a long time. Disability can be understood as the result of various factors, some of which are rooted in biomedical properties, others in aspects of the physical or social environment. This doesn't imply that the relational model is harmonious, or even fully worked out. And medical definitions and criteria remain important sites of power in Norwegian disability discourse because of the welfare state. A medically sanctioned diagnosis is the basis of benefits, access to technical aids and various kinds of treatment - in other words to economic, environmental and medical factors which may alter the impact of an impairment on everyday life. A recent Norwegian White Paper states that: Persons who are for reasons of health unable to participate in working life shall be provided with a temporary or permanent source of income. [...] The inability to work shall be documented by means of a medical certificate.6 (NOU, 2007: section 5) 3.2 FFO'S POLICY DISCOURSE Against this background of interacting medical and social definitions, we can discuss the discourse of FFO. The federation was founded in 1950, as the National League of Organizations of the Partially Employable,7 with the aim of strengthening the position for disabled people in negotiations with the emerging welfare state. At the time, FFO served as an umbrella for organizations for people with mobility, hearing and vision impairments, as well as people with tuberculosis. Over the following decades, various other diagnostic groups formed organ izations and joined FFO, a trend which accelerated considerably throughout the 1980s and early 1990s, as both more precise diagnostic techniques and less expensive technology for organizational work became available (Drejer, 1994). The federation's main justification for its continued existence remains its capacity for coordinating and exercising political influence: The point of the FFO collaboration is to promote joint political action so that we become better able to achieve our goals in our encounters with decision-makers, whether in public administration, political bodies, or boards and councils where FFO participates.</page><page sequence="11">Grue-. Critical discourse analysis, topoi and mystification 315 In addition to the political work, FFO arranges for meeting places and other arenas where our member organizations can discuss and collaborate on areas of common interest.8 (FFO, 2008) In this context, the social model becomes a strategic asset to the extent that it is able to unite, say, deaf people and people with periodontitis, and it has become increasingly visible in FFO's discourse over time. One of the rhetorical challenges of the FFO organizational model is to identify political goals that are shared by some or all of its member organizations, and to coordinate their often diverse interests. Since the organizations act as representatives for people with specific chronic illnesses and impairments, the challenge consists partly in translating between medical self-perceptions in a local context with an overarching social model strategy directed towards political and economic equality. FFO has to communicate with readers who use both medical and socio political language. Analyzing its discourse is therefore not necessarily a matter of exposing or unveiling hidden ideologies, but of identifying different com municative purposes. The discourse produced by the federation must serve as a constant reminder that it is a necessary part of Norwegian civil society and the disability field. Social model discourse is highly visible in the federation's general policy documents. The Definition states that: The member organizations of FFO represent people who live with disability that may be caused by congenital diseases, damage caused by accidents, or acquired chronic diseases. There are many, potentially complex, causes of disability. Because of this, the concept of disability contains many different causes and symptoms. The member organizations, however, have in common their experiences of encounters with Norwegian society, where one frequently experiences discrimination. There are no mentions of medical remedies, however. The goal of 'full partici pation and equal treatment' for disabled people is to be achieved by combating 'systematic exclusion' and 'market thinking'. Similarly, FFO's 30-page program does not mention the word 'medicine' or variants thereof, and lists 'health' as one 'target' among 10. In the federation's general policy documents, disability is consistently framed as a matter of imposed restriction or conflict between indi vidual rights and social arrangements. In the Program, 'conflict' is mentioned eight times, 'rights' or 'human rights' 22 times, 'society' or 'development of society' 66 times. In specific policy argumentation, however, it is topoi of disadvantage and com pensation that are invoked. The 10 'targets' that are identified in the program are effectively topoi, because they provide warrants for policy interventions in those areas. Below, I quote three of them in full. The pattern is the same for all 10. (Independent living, accessibility, health, rehabilitation, youth, education, organizational development and internationalization are omitted for the sake of brevity.)</page><page sequence="12">3i6 Discourse Studies n{i) Rights9 FFO's goal is that the rights, equal treatment and full participation of people with disabilities and chronic illnesses in every area will be secured through national legislation and a separate law against the discrimination of disabled people. Topos 1: If disability is made worse by discrimination, discrimination must be combated. Work FFO's goal is that people who live with disabilities and chronic illness be secured the opportunity to use their capabilities in active participation in working life in order to secure an income. Topos 2: If disability is made worse by lack of income, the opportunity to provide an income must be secured. Standard of living FFO's goal is an economic policy which secures for people who live with disability and chronic illness a standard of living equivalent to the general population. Topos 3: If disability is made worse by a low standard of living, such standards must be raised. In each case, disability is a property equal to chronic illness, viz. a property of individual people. This does not follow from the social model, which, as we have noted, sees disablement as the result of sociopolitical factors. In FFO's program, a diverse range of policies can improve conditions for disabled people, but they will nevertheless remain disabled. This speaks to some of the practical limitations of the social model. The con ceptualization of disability as a matter of discrimination suggests a strong parallel between disabled people and people who are discriminated against because of their ethnicity, their gender or their sexuality. It also suggests that anti-discrimination measures are the solution to the problem. However, as Tom Shakespeare has noted: Women and men may be physiologically and physically different, but it is no longer possible to argue that women are made less capable by their biology. [. . .] Similarly, only racists would see the biological differences between ethnic communities as the explanation for their social differences. Nor is it clear why being lesbian or gay would put any individual at a disadvantage, in the absence of prejudice and discrimination. But even in the absence of social barriers or oppression, it would still be problematic to have an impairment, because many impairments are limiting or difficult, not neutral. (Shakespeare, 2006: 41) That there is a reality of 'limiting or difficult' impairments makes a consistent application of a strict social model difficult in specific policy discussion difficult. The goal is not to level the playing field in a direct sense, but to make relevant provisions for different groups of people. Before moving on to consultative statements, I'll note that FFO's weekly newsletter, which includes brief presentations of its member organizations, con sistently labels prostate cancer, Tourette's syndrome, rheumatic disorders, etc.</page><page sequence="13">Grue: Critical discourse analysis, topoi and mystification 317 as disabilities rather than impairments or illnesses that interact with disabling structures, and that phrases that are conventionally associated with medical discourse are drawn on for illustration: Rheumatism strikes people of all ages and social classes. The degree of seriousness varies from case to case. Some people may lead practically normal lives, while others depend on technical aids such as wheelchairs, crutches and different adaptations in order to handle everyday life.10 The argument in this quote depends on the kind of assumptions of personal tragedy that have been heavily criticized from a social model perspective. The metaphor of being 'struck' by disease suggests something sudden, dramatic and extraordinary taking place, while the experience of chronic illness is in fact common, gradual and interwoven with ordinary life (also, see Sontag, 1991 on rendering illnesses taboo subjects by way of anthropomorphism). Similarly, the notion that life with a chronic illness is by definition abnormal (that a 'practically normal' life is the best that can be hoped for, and that the degree of normality results directly from the severity of the illness) is an established target of social model criticism. Even in some general-purpose documents, then, FFO's definition of disability as a relation of conflict is intertwined with arguments that assume it to be a 'property' of individual people. Rhetorically, this can be viewed as an appeal to organizations whose members do not necessarily see themselves as disabled. To approach this strategy in terms of critical discourse analysis might, playing devil's advocate, have entailed looking for the "'hidden agenda" [of] the repro duction of class relations and other higher-level social structures' (Fairclough, 2001 [1989]: 33) beneath the textual surface. The social model definition, for instance, could potentially be analyzed as a 'cover' for a more conservative medical definition, in which case FFO would be harboring unspoken ideo logical agendas. This form of analysis would be unsatisfactory, however. That the discourse produced by FFO does not contain a comprehensive and coherent understanding of disability does not entail any single covert agenda, but may rather be explained by 1) the fact that a medically certified diagnosis is the basis of welfare provisions, which attributes disabilities to individual people and 2) the fact that FFO is an NGO which potentially represents all Norwegian disabled people and that new diagnoses are being developed constantly, which means that new organizations are founded with each year. FFO is predicated, as a federation, on the assumption that disabled people have certain characteristics in common which make them deserving of special mention as a group. General experiences of exclusion and discrimination are invoked in the definitional document, which draws on social model discourse. There is, however, always a need to establish some way of distinguishing the group of dis abled people from the able-bodied population, and that distinction inevitably has a medical component. The Definition (briefly) acknowledges as much: In FFO's understanding of disability, there is a criterion of permanence; that it is a state one has to live with, which cannot be healed or cured.</page><page sequence="14">3i8 Discourse Studies 11(3) [■••] The member organizations of FFO represent people who live with disability that may be caused by congenital diseases, damage caused by accidents, or acquired chronic diseases. The criteria are left vague. Nowhere in the text does it say directly where the boundary line between disabling and non-disabling disease, damage, etc. runs. The question of strict definition and causation is deferred so that effectively, a disabled person is defined as a member of one of FFO's own organizations. In that case, disability becomes a matter of self-identification: declaring oneself to be disabled by joining a disability organization is voluntary, and presumably motivated by the need for information, assistance, an improved bargaining position or similar benefits. What are some of these benefits? For this, we turn to the consultative state ments. They break down, as we saw in part 2.2, into the categories of organ izational life, youth, accessibility, independent living, education, Europe, working life, welfare and health. They follow a set rhetorical pattern in which FFO, a) introduces itself and states its organizational purpose, b) relates that purpose to the rules, regulations or laws under consultation, c) summarizes its recommendations, d) interprets the policy situation in detail, e) makes its arguments in detail, and f) recapitulates its recommendations. These sections correspond to the common pattern of a deliberative argument, that is, a) exordium, b) narratio, c) dispositio, d) and e) argumentatio and f) peroratio. A typical text is entitled 'FFO's recommendations for the future organization of transportation for the disabled and chronically ill'. The interesting section for our purposes is b), in which the area of transport is established as relevant to disability issues: FFO works for full participation and equal treatment for disabled and chronically ill people in every area of society, and the area of transportation is important in this context. Many disabled and chronically ill people face barriers in the transportation system that prevent them from breaking out of isolation and participate in society on a par with others. It is FFO's position that as long as the transportation sector is structured so that not everyone may use public transportation, society must com pensate for this by offering transportation arrangements for individuals that covers the need for transportation to work, education and leisure activities.11 In this case, the topos of disadvantage is similar to the ones we've seen previously: Topos 4: If disability is made worse by the lack of accessible transport, that lack must be amended. This position is ambiguous in terms of the social versus medical dichotomy be cause of the formulation 'as long as the transportation sector is structured so that not everyone may use public transportation'. A straight social model position would entail that public transportation that can be used by people with every kind of impairment is the only goal that would truly eliminate disablement. In</page><page sequence="15">Grue: Critical discourse analysis, topoi and mystification 319 the event, FFO settles for a compensatory mechanism, paratransit services, which maintains the potentially oppressive division between disabled and non-disabled people, and subsequently makes its arguments about the specific character istics of the paratransit system. One way of viewing this example is of course that political idealism is trumped by pragmatism in much of policy discourse. Indeed, throughout the consultative statements, the arguments are made in accordance with pragmatic criteria, not primarily on ideological grounds. An exhaustive review would entail discussing the policy issues in each case; I'll restrict the rest of this part to two further examples. FFO does occasionally mark out disability issues explicitly as matters of socio political conflict, but even in such cases the primary topos is one of compensation and amelioration of inherent disadvantage. For example: Hearing - proposal on new regulations for the use of motorized vehicles in wilderness areas. [.. .] The new regulations on the use of motorized vehicles in wilderness areas will impact on the opportunity for many disabled and chronically ill people to experience the outdoors. At the same time, we find that it is in this area that the conflict between the opportunities of disabled people and nature conservation is at its greatest.12 Disabled people are not made disabled by a lack of access to wilderness areas; it is their opportunities for experience that are being restricted. Topos 5: If disability is made worse by a lack of access to wilderness areas, such access should be provided. The only cases I've been able to identify in which topoi of amelioration or com pensation are not invoked are ones in which the disability issue remains entirely implicit: Legislative proposal on the use of live biological animal tissue in medical treatment of human beings. [...] Xenotransplantation raise many issues that ought to be the subject of compre hensive public debate. Questions of xenotransplantation raise both professional and ethical issues that need to be addressed on a broad basis, and debate should not be limited to professional communities or groups of experts. This field impacts on the entire population, and opinions and contributions from different areas and circles need to be a part of the discussion.13 The statement from which this quote is excerpted does not contain the words 'disability' or 'impairment', and the arguments in the document center on general issues of medical safety. The connection between xenotransplantation and disability is implicitly warranted by FFO's role as a consultative body, which is to say by established political and bureaucratic structures. In such cases - and only in such cases - the federation is able to speak without addressing the issue of whether disability is a property of people or relations. In other cases, disability is assumed to be a property of people because it is the only way to establish which people the federation is in fact representing.</page><page sequence="16">320 Discourse Studies 11(3) The representation of disabled people as political category that is created by oppression is challenged by the practicalities of the political process, and the need to identify particular issues in particular contexts. The fact that these issues are discussed largely without reference to social model frames such as the 'conflict' signaled in the Program and Definition does not preclude their being interpreted within such frames. However, what initially appears to be an overarching ideology of socio-political disablement turns out not to have a central position in specific policy arguments. 3.3 THE FUNCTION OF FFO'S POLICY DISCOURSE FFO's uses of the social model in the Definition and Program are in a sense secondary to its medical definitions, in the same way that its membership base is organized primarily according to impairment. Arguments that construe disabled people as a political minority allow FFO to speak on behalf of a group of some 300,000 people - approximately 6.7 percent of the Norwegian population. But these arguments are restricted to programmatic contexts. Social model discourse appears to have the non-ideological primary function of keeping FFO together and creating a united front. Representing disability as a conflict emphasizes that the gains made by the disability movement (e.g. in the form of legal rights) or are not granted by the state so much as fought for by the organizations themselves. Even as the disability movement in Norway remains heavily dependent on welfare state categories, the social model arguments become a means for maintaining an independent organizational identity. Arguably, therefore, the Definition and the Program are more strongly linked to the larger discourse field of NGOs in general, and have more to do with distin guishing FFO from state agencies in the disability field (of which there are many), than with justifying particular policy arguments on ideological grounds. Many of the key words and phrases from the program and definitional document, e.g. discrimination, independence, and human rights are by no means restricted to NGOs in the disability field, but are quite relevant to NGOs in many other fields. The five topoi I've identified so far bear repeating at this point: • Topos 1 : if disability is made worse by discrimination, discrimination must be combated. • Topos 2: if disability is made worse by lack of income, the opportunity to provide an income must be secured. • Topos 3: if disability is made worse by a low standard of living, such standards must be raised. Topos 4: if disability is made worse by the lack of accessible transport, that lack must be amended. • Topos 5: if disability is made worse by a lack of access to wilderness areas, such access should be provided. The pattern, which is clear enough, can be extended to almost any area of policy. The only necessary connection is documentation that disabled people are in fact disadvantaged in the relevant area, documentation that is unfortunately not very hard to provide.</page><page sequence="17">Grue: Critical discourse analysis, topoi and mystification 321 FFO's approach is, as we've noted, a pragmatic one. A salient ideological implication of the topical structure it employs, however, is the persistent link between disability and disadvantage. Being disabled is a matter of joining an organization under the FFO aegis, and simultaneously a reinforcement of the system of compensatory policy interventions. The 'conflict' between disabled individuals and a disabling society cannot be resolved, as in the more Utopian versions of the social model because disability, by FFO's definition, 'is a state one has to live with, which cannot be healed or cured'. Disability policy discourse, then, as analyzed in this article, maintains a definition of its central object - disability - that is tied less to any overarching medical or social model ideology or causal explanation than to specific areas of society. It largely avoids issues of causality because it is preferable to maintain fuzzy membership criteria. It avoids ideology because no ideology of disability that is both coherent and pragmatically useful yet exists. The five topoi listed above (and topoi related to them) could all be situated within a general ideology of social justice. The fact that they are reproduced - and will continue to be reproduced - within the context of a disability NGO means that disability remains a discourse field on a) institutional and b) pragmatic grounds. In the final part of the article, I discuss the implications of this. 4. Implications The presumed conflict between social and medical models of disability is absent in the policy debates analyzed in this article. The social model is ostensibly embraced by FFO, but in practice, it is disability conceived as a property of individual people that gives rise to actual arguments. Does this constitute mystification? Mystification analysis is frequently performed on media texts, particularly news stories. These texts are particularly susceptible to this analysis because of their stated neutrality; they are ripe for exposure of a hidden agenda. Journalists, of course, have ideological beliefs and write within the context of ideological genres - they are simply more reluctant to admit their ideological bias. This aspect of CDA reflects its origins in the British political culture of the 19 70s and 1980s. Some of its most important concerns were with media repre sentations of key ideological conflicts and events such as the miner's strikes of 19 74 and 19 84-5 - and the Falklands War. Exposing the underlying (right-wing and pro-government) bias of news articles became a formative component of the CDA program (see for example Fowler et al., 1979; Kress and Hodge, 1979). Ostensibly neutral newspaper texts are only one form of ideological discourse, however. Strategically conceived documents like political pamphlets, programs, and statements of purpose are far less committed to neutrality. FFO's program draws attention to the fact that it is a political document: The compensatory principle The starting point of FFO's work as a political interest group is the principle that society must compensate for and reduce the consequences of disability and chronic illness.14</page><page sequence="18">322 Discourse Studies 11(3) Newspaper discourse is concerned with balancing (or appearing to balance) dif ferent ideological viewpoints for the sake of neutrality. A political program aims at ideological balance for the sake of consistency. This is a matter of genre and agency. The voice of the newspaper is that of the observer, the voice of the NGO or political party is that of the agent. The research question of how the world shapes and is shaped by discourse may be preserved, but features of discourse must be viewed in accordance with genre purposes. The Program quotes from the UN Declaration of Human Rights when estab lishing the link between discrimination and disability: All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights. (Universal Declaration of Human Rights, Article 1) All are entitled to equal protection against any discrimination in violation of this Declaration ... (Universal Declaration of Human Rights, Article 7)15 In this attempt, the overarching conflict of 'social model' discourse is not contradicted by, but grounded in 'medical model' discourse. Again from the program: To exclude people with disabilities and chronic illnesses by inflicting on them additional expenses which are caused by consequences of the disability or chronic illness, is also a form of systematic discrimination.16 Here, the disability or illness is a property of individual people, and it is the disability or illness that causes additional expenses. Protection against discrim ination, then, consists of compensatory mechanisms that are directly linked to the nature of different impairments. A better term for 'mystification' would in this case be 'explanation'. According to Norman Fairclough, mystification occurs whenever 'true' agency is obscured. But this presupposes that the CD analyst is capable of iden tifying this kind of true agency by extrapolation from the actual text, while maintaining that the text being analyzed withholds the information which makes such extrapolation possible. We see the problem of mystification quite clearly in Fairclough's classic 'Quarry load-shedding problem' analysis. The news item in question runs, in full (foregoing the original formatting): Quarry load-shedding problem Unsheeted lorries from Middlebarrow Quarry were still causing problems by shedding stones on their journey through Warton village, members of the parish council heard at their September meeting. The council's observations have been sent to the quarry management and members are hoping to see an improvement. (Source: Lancaster Guardian, 12 September 1986) (Fairclough, 2001 [1989]: 42) Fairclough argues both that causality is unspecified in the question of what causes the stones to be shed in Warton village. This argument has been countered by Kieran O'Halloran (O'Halloran, 2003), who, writing from a cognitive point of view, suggest that inferences and background knowledge in readers of the text</page><page sequence="19">Grue: Critical discourse analysis, topoi and mystification 323 play a far greater role than Fairclough is willing to admit. Given what we know about the relationships between lorries, lorry drivers and quarry management, it takes a very stubborn reader to miss the cause of the quarry load-shedding problem. The quarry load-shedding is explicitly categorized as a problem (rather than, for instance, an event), and the news article reports the council's hope for improvement. Put in terms of topoi, the thematic connections established in Fairclough's sample text are sufficiently strong warrants for the mystification argument to fall through. A topos that relates being the management of a company and bearing responsibility for the actions of the same company is sufficient for bridging the gap between the data provided by the article (the cause of the problems) and the implicit claim that an improvement may be achieved by addressing the management of Middlebarrow Quarry. O'Halloran makes a similar point when he argues that the premise that problems for which (corporate or individual) human agents are responsible should be resolved by the same agents is unstated because it may be assumed as part of most newspaper readers' contextual knowledge. The key maneuver in Fairclough's news item isn't therefore mystification, but rather the act of placing responsibility specifically with Middlebarrow Quarry - by naming that company and linking it to an event categorized as a problem. Had the quarry load-shedding been categorized as an ongoing, non problematic event, with no mention of a particular company ('Quarry load shedding will continue to take place for the next several weeks on their journey through Warton village, members of the parish council heard at their September meeting.'), mystification analysis might be more relevant - but not as the example currently stands. As we noted in section 2.3, topoi resemble presuppositions. The information that they contain is a necessary component in the creation of meaning, but that information is elicited partly from the text and partly from knowledge about the world outside the text. Against this background, FFO can be seen as producing a form of disability discourse that links social model and medical model categories by appealing to readers' sense of social justice. From the Program: The compensatory principle The starting point of FFO's work as a political interest group is the principle that society must compensate for and reduce the consequences of disability and chronic illness. [...] To exclude people with disabilities and chronic illnesses by inflicting on them additional expenses which are caused by consequences of the disability or chronic illness, is also a form of systematic discrimination. The compensatory principle is here being established as a master topos: Topos 0: If disability correlates with disadvantage, society must work to alleviate that disadvantage.</page><page sequence="20">324 Discourse Studies 11(3) This is a more general form of topoi 1 through 5 and their extensions. It does, of course, depend on the assumptions on the part of the reader that social justice is a valid communal goal, but that goal would, one hopes, transcend both social and medical models. 5. Conclusion and further research The existence of a federation such as FFO is partly motivated by the understanding of disabled people as a group that shares common goals. But impairments differ immensely in their impact on people's lives, and allow for different life goals. The opposing forces of the ideal of unity and the reality of diversity manifests itself, for FFO, in the split definitions of disability 1 ) as a defining, unitary characteristic of a political minority and 2) as a pragmatic re-labeling of physiological or mental impairments, as well as chronic illnesses. That split could be conceived of as a conflict, and in the literature of disability studies, similar splits have been termed conflicts. Moreover, methods of CDA that emphasize mystification encourage a search for clear and unambiguous agency. If there is a conflict, the parties to that conflict cannot be left implicit. Topical analysis, however, shows that agency is not always mystified if it is unclear. The identification of specific disability policy topoi show that when the conflict moves from the general to the specific, disability also shifts from being an imposed restriction to being more closely identified with properties of indi vidual people. Complex phenomena change with context, and disability is no exception. Further analysis of disability discourse should bear this in mind. Topics that might shed further light on the interaction between medical and social models include the particular provisions of disability rights legislation that employ social model language, and the different institutional contexts in which these provisions are to be enacted. Another area of interest is the criteria according to which people join organizations such as FFO and its members; that is, whether social or medical criteria dominate in people's self-perception as disabled or non-disabled; whether they see themselves as medical patients, victims of discrimination, both, or neither. NOTES 1. A note on language: the material for this article has largely been translated from the Norwegian, but the issue of language differences is not excessively problematic. Two terms are of particular importance when discussing disability discourse: disability and impairment, which correspond to a large extent to the Norwegian terms funksjonshemning and funksjonsnedsettelse. While disability/funksjonshemning conventionally denotes limited functioning relative to a socially defined standard or task, impairment/funksjonsnedsettelse denotes some manner of negative deviation from some norm or standard of physical or mental functioning. Although funksjonsnedsettelse is less frequently used than impairment, any problems of accuracy in translation are far less acute than the question of causality within each</page><page sequence="21">Grue: Critical discourse analysis, topoi and mystification 325 language - whether disabilities result, directly or indirectly, from impairments, or funksjonshemning from funksjonsnedsettelse. 2.
