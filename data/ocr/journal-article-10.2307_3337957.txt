<plain_text><page sequence="1">The frican Collection at the Museum of Art BARBARA THOMPSON he history of the Hood Museum of Art and its Af- rican collection is intricately entwined with the unique character of Dartmouth College, the na- tion's ninth oldest college and a member of the Ivy League (Bass 1985:16). Dartmouth College was founded in 1769 by Rev. Eleazar Wheelock, a Con- gregational minister from Connecticut, in the town of Hanover in the Royal Province of New Hampshire. Chartered by King George III, the college provided for the education and instruction of youth of the Indian Tribes in this land in reading, writing, and all parts of learning which shall appear necessary and expedient for civilizing and christianizing children of pagans, as well as in all liberal arts and sciences, and also of English youth and any others.1 Because he considered the primary mission of his school, as out- lined in the Charter of Dartmouth College, "to encourage the laudable and charitable design of spreading Christian knowl- edge among the savages of our American wilderness, and also that the best means of education be established in our province of New Hampshire, for the benefit of said province," Rev. Wheelock chose as the college's motto vox clamantis in deserto, "a voice cry- ing in the wilderness" (Isaiah 40:3). In this context, the "voice" represented the expression of religion in the darkness of an unsettled region, particularly because Dartmouth's remote loca- tion in the midst of New England's "wilderness" inspired a rig- orous desire to further the understanding between life, God, and his creation. Echoing the excitement of colonizing a New World, the allegiance of America's intellectuals to the Enlightenment, and the religious devotion of New England's European settlers, the college's mission engaged Dartmouth students with classifi- able examples of the "natural and moral world" embodied by scientific, ethnographic, archaeological, and natural history teachings and specimens (Bass 1985:10). These were the same perspectives that invited and directed the humble beginnings of a young Dartmouth College museum. The Multifarious History of an Ethnographic Collection The first reference to the development of a museum at Dartmouth College dates to 1772, when David McClure wrote to Rev. Wheelock that he had "collected a few curious Elephants Bones found about six hundred miles down the Ohio, for the young Museum at Dartmouth," thereafter referred to as the Dartmouth College Museum (Bowen 1958:1).2 The beginning of the muse- um's interest in the African continent came soon thereafter. As recorded in the Worcester Massachusetts Spy and the Boston Colum- bian Centinel, on September 7, 1796, Elias Hasket Derby, of Salem, Massachusetts, gave the Dartmouth College Museum a "large number of curiosities," including a stuffed African zebra (Bass 1985:13). According to Dartmouth lore, "unlike a properly regu- lated museum piece, [the zebra] was in the habit of appearing in incongruous places, such as the roof of the chapel or the belfry of the 'College' [Dartmouth Hall], thus requiring laborious trans- portation back to its normal abode" (Richardson 1932:251-2). Dartmouth's interest in material culture from the African con- tinent is directly linked to the history of one of its students, John Ledyard (1751-89), who attended the college for one year in 1772 and was the first American in Egypt. After shipping with Captain Cook to the Pacific and crossing Siberia, Ledyard was engaged by the African Association of London to explore the Nile and the Niger but died in Cairo at the outset of that trip. On August 15, 1788, Ledyard wrote from Alexandria, Egypt, A pillar called the pillar of Pompey &amp; an obelisk called Cleopatra's are now almost the only remains of great Antiq- uity. They are both and particularly the former noble sub- jects to see and contemplate &amp; certainly more captivating for the contrasting dessert [sic] and forlorn prospects around them (Oliver 1979). Museum records confirm that before 1810, a Mr. S. Dinsmore donated two syenite fragments of Pompey's pillar from Alex- 14 african arts - summer 2004</page><page sequence="2">PAU JEFFREY NINTZEL andria-one of which is still extant in the museum (13.158.4255).3 Although the actual date of the acquisition of these two frag- ments remains unknown, it is possible that Ledyard's 1788 ref- erence to this very same pillar was the impetus behind the collection and subsequent acquisition of these fragments by the museum. 1. Mummy mask Thebes, Egypt, Old Kingdom, 2465-2150 B.C. Wood, shell inlay, black paint; 12.0cm x 12.2cm (43/4" x 47/8") Gift of Frederick Hall, Class of 1803, 13.163.4115 Mummy masks such as this example, which was given to the Dartmouth College Museum in 1838 by Frederick Hall (Dartmouth class of 1803), came into use about 2500 B.C. and continued to be produced until the start of the Christian era. The fascination with ancient Egyptian "curiosities" in these early years of the Dartmouth College Museum continued when, in 1838, Frederick Hall (Class of 1803)4 donated an Egyptian mummy mask (Fig. 1) from the Old Kingdom, 2465-2150 B.C.; two fresco fragments from the Tomb of Kings in the Lower Cham- ber, Thebes, 18th Dynasty; a mummy cloth with embalming; and other objects no longer extant in the museum. Although these objects are of little scholarly interest today, they are wonderful examples of the kinds of "curios" that were being collected by Dartmouth College Museum during the first half of the nineteenth century in the interest of exploration and adventure. A pivotal moment in Dartmouth's early nineteenth century history coincided with the tenure of its president Bennett Tyler, a minister from South Britain, Connecticut. During Tyler's summer 2004 - african arts 15</page><page sequence="3">~f-? ?, ..3 i ~:4;f .:.' i i~Zc?r.-I~": -?:;::? JEFFREY NINTZEL presidency (1822-28), Dartmouth students and faculty success- fully petitioned the College to admit Edward Mitchell from Mar- tinique, West Indies, in 1824. Though not without controversy, this event sparked Dartmouth's slow process of racial diversi- fication beyond the few Native American students admitted under the college's original mission statement. This beginning to Dartmouth's diversification of its student population foreshadowed the eventual diversification of its Af- rican collection, which began with President Tyler's son, Josiah. Following in his father's footsteps, Josiah Tyler entered the ministry and became a missionary to the American Board in Natal. While in South Africa, he collected forty-eight "Zulu" objects, most of which are still in the collection today, including a wooden headrest (Fig. 2) and a beaded snuff container (Fig. 3) which he donated to the Dartmouth College Museum in Sep- tember, 1885 (Hunter 1968). Tyler's gift expanded the reach of the early African collection from the northern to the southern tip of the continent, opening the museum doors to objects from JEFFREY NINTZEL 16 african arts - summer 2004</page><page sequence="4">sub-Saharan Africa in accordance with the colonial scramble for African art and authority during the nineteenth century. Dartmouth's collections have a long history of combining sci- ence, art, and education, and like the College itself, the museum has gone through as many changes as the buildings that have housed it and the academic perspectives and curricular goals that have developed it. Until 1985, the collection was historically torn between the claims of various college departments and the desire for an independent museum; struggling with the growth of fledg- ling departments such as natural philosophy, natural sciences, sociology, anthropology, and fine arts; and residing in multiple museum manifestations, such as the Dartmouth College Museum; the Butterfield Museum of Paleontology, Archaeology, Ethnol- ogy, and Kindred Sciences; the Hopkins Center Art Galleries; and the Hood Museum of Art. The subsequent (re)classifications of the collections within these disciplines and museums, along with the long succession of inspectors, supervisors, and curators, in- evitably led to works being transported to and from various lo- cations around campus. At times, rooms or attics were temporarily dubbed "museum" while at other times the collections were housed in relevant academic buildings. In 1928, however, the museum collections were dispersed. The natural science collec- tions were transferred to the diverse natural science disciplines for teaching purposes while the collections labeled "ethnograph- ic" and "natural history" took up residence in Wilson Hall, home also to the anthropology department. Despite the ever-increasing interest in sub-Saharan Africa, the fascination with ancient and contemporary Egypt continued to make its presence known at the Dartmouth College Museum through the acquisition of a sepulchral stela from Thebes, dated ca. 712-664 B.C. (Fig. 4) and a bequest of ninety-eight works col- lected in Egypt between 1866-67 from Emily Howe Hitchcock Opposite page, clockwise from top: 2. Headrest Zulu peoples, South Africa Wood; 36.5cm (14Y16") Gift of Rev. Josiah Tyler, 13.25.885 This headrest was collected by Rev. Josiah Tyler, D.

Tyler, the son of former Dartmouth president Bennett Tyler, gave the headrest to the Dartmouth College Muse- um collection in 1885. 3.

Water jug Egypt, mid-19th century Glazed terracotta; 22.2cm x 11cm (8?%, x 4%8") Bequest of Emily Howe Hitchcock, 12.2.540 Emily Howe Hitchcock (1852-1912), a prominent figure in Hanover, New Hampshire, bequeathed ninety-eight works collected in Egypt between 1866 and 1867. Besides being fascinated with ancient Egyptian arts, Howe Hitch- cock also took an interest in contemporary Egyptian ceramic wares, such as this example of a blackened water jug. (1852-1912) of Hanover, New Hampshire. An interesting aspect of the Howe bequest, which had been largely missing from other acquisitions of Egyptian art, were examples of contempo- rary Egyptian art, including a blackened water jug from the mid-nineteenth century (Fig. 5). In 1939, Dartmouth College Museum acquired through gift and purchase from the Museum and Art Gallery of Reading, England, more than 350 objects. The acquisition was made up primarily of ancient Egyptian pottery dating from predynastic times to the Roman period and objects of everyday use from Uganda, a region that until that point had been unrepresented in the museum. Dartmouth College Museum was especially proud of the Ugandan acquisitions because Uganda was viewed at that time as "the gate- way through which metallurgy, pottery, cattle-raising, and other domestic arts were introduced to the 'dark continent'...."5 Today the Ugandan materials are especially important because of their connection with the famous anthropologist Louis S. B. Leakey, whose work centered on early human origins in East Africa. :?~a~ ;?;?s.;?-~! 1,~: :-? s;-?- ilI il?-' JEFFREY MNTZEL summer 2004 - african arts 17</page><page sequence="5">JEFFREY NINTZEL - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - --- JEFFREY NINTZEL Specifically, the Uganda materials that Dartmouth acquired from the Reading Museum were collected by Rev.

These objects, totaling 197, represented a broad range of items that were being made at that time for popular consumption. The wide diversity of these objects provides an interesting docu- mentation of trade and cultural transformation in the visual arts immediately following the colonial period. Besides collecting objects of everyday use, Fernandez also purchased a strip of kente cloth in Togo from a man in exile from Ghana, a contemporary Fon applique cloth with symbols of Dahomean kings, and a con- temporary Yoruba gelede mask (Fig. 8) purchased north of Puerto Novo, Benin (Dahomey), in 1966. From Ethnography to Art In 1962, following the opening of the Hopkins Center Art Gal- leries in Dartmouth's new arts facility, many works that in earli- er eras would have been given to the "ethnographic" collections were given as "art" to the galleries.

Rockefeller through her son Rodman C. Rockefeller. The head, which is attributed to the Late Period (664-332 B.C.), was originally collected by Mary C. Rockefeller's son, Nelson Aldrich Rockefeller, in Egypt in the early 1930s. It depicts the god wearing a striated wig (originally surmounted by a now-missing attrib- ute) and a false beard with raised chin straps and lidded eyes with extend- ing cosmetic lines beneath modeled brows.

Among the Yoruba, the iconographic attributes of Eshu-Elegba include a coiffure or headdress in phallic form (ogo Elegba) and medicinal gourds, depicted in the figure's right hand, and in bands along the braid, both represented in this example. Eshu priests wear such staffs hooked over the left shoulder, the hairdress providing the hook, just as one is worn by the figure represented in this staff. curricular interests in natural history, the Dartmouth College Museum divested itself of its entire natural history collection in 1974 to help establish a regional museum, the Montshire Muse- um of Science, in the adjacent town of Norwich, Vermont. More- over, Dartmouth merged the administration of its now extensive ethnographic, archaeological, and historical collections with its ever-expanding fine art collection, which had begun in 1793 as a small collection of portraits.6 Due to the changing attitudes toward the arts and the devel- opment of studio art programs at Dartmouth throughout the 1960s and early 1970s, the fine art collection now included not only a gift by Abby A. Rockefeller of one hundred paintings, drawings, prints, and sculptures but also a gift from the Estate of Mary C. Rockefeller of an Egyptian black granite head of a god (Fig. 9) from the Late Period, 664-332 B.C., collected in Egypt by her husband Nelson A. Rockefeller (Class of 1930) in the early 1930s. Throughout the early 1970s, the collection was significant- ly augmented by a gift of forty-eight art works given to the Hopkins Center Art Galleries by Evelyn A. and William B. Jaffe Hall (Class of 1964H). These gifts included a Yoruba Shango staff (oshe Shango) (Fig. 10); a staff for Eshu (ogo Eshu Elegba) (Fig. 11), a Guro dance mask (zamble) (Fig. 12) in the style of the Zuenoula region of Bouafle; and a Shona buffalo figure headrest (Fig. 13), among other classic sculptural works mostly from West and Cen- tral Africa. Under the new auspices of the combined collections, these African works were finally categorized and promoted as "fine arts," with the collection making a noticeable shift from primarily nonfigurative arts to figurative sculpture. Despite the changing view of African sculpture as art rather than artifact during the mid-twentieth century, the unification of the two collection types did not yet completely break down the long-established divide. The development of the ethnographic 20 atfrican arts summer 2004</page><page sequence="8">..'i '41 r .ri; ,,?? JEFFREY NINTZEL collection still relied heavily on the support of the anthropology department. However, in 1976, Tamara Northern, a leading schol- ar in Cameroonian art and former curator of African collections at New York's Museum of Primitive Art, was appointed curator of ethnographic art and as an adjunct faculty member in the anthro- pology department. Northern brought a keen sense of aesthetics into the anthropological tendencies of the academic supporters of this particular collection, and in the interest of building up a larg- er presence of canonical works in the African art collection, she was instrumental in acquiring works of aesthetic and art-histori- cal as well as anthropological value. The transition to total integration was finally accomplished when the quest for a centralized museum structure was realized in 1985 with the opening of an independent museum, designed by Charles Moore, and renamed the Hood Museum of Art in honor of a distinguished graduate of Dartmouth College, Harvey P. Hood (Class of 1918). This centralization of its collections into a single facility represented one of the most significant steps in the history of the museum. With the completion of the new facility, the Hood Museum of Art was able to expand its origi- nal mission to serve as an important educational and cultural resource for the college and the rural New England communi- ties. It was now able to provide Dartmouth College and muse- um visitors with more comprehensive and cohesive educational and outreach programs that incorporated all of its collections; provide exhibition spaces for works from all regions of the world; and develop a holistic approach to acquiring individual acquisitions of importance that relate to the museum's broader holdings and institutional goals. For the ethnographic collection specifically, the move into the new structure meant it would be permanently unified with the fine arts collection, joining some of the museum's most important : r PATRICK J.

By consolidating the art and ethnographic collections from various locations on campus, the museum could draw more effectively from its disparate collections for interdisci- plinary use, further breaking down the barrier between art and artifact. Consequently, Tamara Northern's collection practices could focus more closely on the acquisition of objects with histori- cal and aesthetic significance, emphasizing the quality of the object and the pursuit of so-called masterpieces, rather than on quantity or a broad range of representation as had been the case in the col- lection's earlier manifestations. From 1985 until her retirement in 1999, Northern intentionally developed the African collection with an eye on canonical works from West and Central Africa repre- senting artistic production before the independence era. Having guest curated at other colleges and institutions before her appointment at Dartmouth, Northern had established close connections with important collectors of ethnographic arts. Most important to the development of the Hood's collections were her ties with the Harry A. Franklin family. Franklin, who had begun collecting in 1938, opened his first gallery in Los Angeles in 1955 and was widely recognized as one of the earliest collectors to appreciate the aesthetic worth of non-Western art. Northern's friendship with Franklin's daughter, Valerie Franklin, who later directed her father's gallery, resulted in the family entrusting the Hood Museum of Art with their expansive collection of Mela- nesian art and part of Ms. Franklin's African art collection. Since 1990, the Harry A. Franklin Family Collection has contributed over eighty-six works of African art to the collection, including a Touba mask with a bird's beak (Fig. 14) and an Igbo ochichi bowl and lid (Fig. 15).

Here the typically full cheeks and massive forehead are evenly balanced and tempered to a degree of muted naturalism. The multiple male heads are the symbolic representation of male moral and political authority as well as of the strength of the lineage. Death celebrations, especially that of the king (fon) provide the occasions when such masks emerge and are danced before the entire community, who view the masks with awe and reverence.

Lack of information about where this power emblem was collected makes it difficult to attribute this work definitively to either the Banyang of Cameroon or the Ejagham peoples of Nigeria. However, certain evidence suggests that it was probably made by the Banyang for the Bekundi lodge of the Banyang Ngbe association, which protects its parent association with "medicines," potent substances that can be used to inflict harm or provide protection. The emblem of Bekundi is a mat in the form of a square lattice of raffia palm fronds, surrounded by a raffia fringe, upon which are fixed certain animal skulls, horns, bones, and other significant elements, natural as well as man-made. 20.

Armlet Fulani peoples, Northern Nigeria or Northern Cameroon, nineteenth to twentieth century Copper alloy; 14.3cm x 23.6cm x 6.4cm (55/8" x 91/4" x 21/2") Gift of Arnold and Joanne Syrop, 984.46.26407 summer 2004 - african arts 27</page><page sequence="15">ft JEFFREY NINTZEL Throughout the 1990s, the Hood Museum's new acquisitions in African art included both paradigmatic and noncanonical representations from Africa's major art-producing areas. Among the foundational pieces were Yoruba figures of Eshu-Elegba (Fig. 16), a Kongo nkisi figure (Fig. 17), and a male mask of authority (Fig. 18) from the western grassfields of Cameroon in the Babanki style. An Ngbe/Ekpe society power emblem (Fig. 19) from the Banyang peoples of Cameroon or the Ejagham peoples of Nigeria and a Yaka power vessel (Fig. 20) represent important elements of accumulative and noncanonical arts in Africa. Between 1984 and 1998, a new character was added to the Af- rican collection through gifts from Arnold and Joanne Syrop, well-known collectors of African brass art. The Syrop gifts of 190 brass castings of personal adornment made a significant contri- bution to the African collection, providing an almost encyclope- dic study of West African brass adornment, including a very ornate Fulani armlet from northern Nigeria or Cameroon (Fig. 21) and a Manila-type anklet from the Djerma peoples of Niger. Other objects of historical significance that were added to the collection shortly before Northern's retirement from the Hood Museum of Art include a hip ornament representing the head of a Benin court official (Fig. 22), a Yombe memorial figure of a clan i: i i ii" Iii ,! r. . , ., JEFFREY NINTZEL 28 african arts * summer 2004</page><page sequence="16">I r i JEFFREY NINTZEL i ~:~ ~~iS;i ???i? i.; I:?- ?T~~ : i? -w JEFFREY NINTZEL Opposite page, clockwise from top left: 22. Hip ornament representing the head of a Benin court official Edo peoples, Kingdom of Benin or Nigeria, attributed to the early eighteenth century Brass and iron; 20.3cm (8") Purchased through gifts from the Lathrop Fellows, 999.42.33929 Made of copper alloy with iron inlays in the eyes, this hip ornament repre- senting the head of a Benin court official was collected by the British Punitive Expedition in 1897, and was acquired by the Pitt-Rivers Museum in Farnham, Dorset, England. It was then in various private collections in Great Britain and the U.S. before it was acquired by the Hood Museum of Art in 1999. Hip or- naments, such as this example, formed a part of the regalia of the oba, the divine king of Benin, as well as of high-ranking title holders, especially war chiefs. Suspended on the left side of a low belt worn over the fold of a skirt, this ornament illustrates the quintessential face of Benin art from the middle period. It also typifies emblems of rank and status within the palace hierar- chy: a tight-fitting headdress of coral beads complemented by a low collar of the same beads and broad semicircular ruffle with attached crotals. 23. Cross Afro-Portuguese, M'Banza Congo (formerly Sa6 Salvador), Angola, nineteenth century Wood; 46.4cm x 16.7cm x 2cm (181/2" x 65" x 3/4") Purchased through the William B. Jaffe and Evelyn A. Jaffe Hall Fund, 999.3.30469 This Afro-Portuguese cross with an ink-inscribed paper label identifying its provenance from an old church in Sa6 Salvador was in the collection of Susana Montiel de Colmenares in London, England, before the Hood Muse- um of Art acquired it in 1999. Sa6 Salvador, the capital of the Kingdom of the Congo during the sixteenth to eighteenth centuries, was an important colonial settlement in the Portuguese Kongo. Today, it is known as M'Banza Congo in the province of Zaire, Angola. 24. Female mask (mukudj) Punu peoples, Gabon, late nineteenth to early twentieth century Wood and kaolin; 33cm (13") Purchased through The Mrs. Harvey P. Hood W '18 Fund, 2004.17.35574. Called mukudj (or variations of the name, according to geographical loca- tion, such as mukuyi or okuyi), Punu masks such as these were worn by male masquerade dancers representing an idealized female during funeral cele- brations. When performing, the masked male dancers wore stilts concealed under fiber costumes and performed acrobatic feats. Today, the Punu peo- ples display these masks in their homes as a sign of ethnic identity but commission the masks to be made specifically for other types of perfor- mances to celebrate a number of events. This mask was collected by Lucien Claude-Lafontaine in 1927 or earlier from the Paris art market, before it was passed on to his daughter Pascale Claude-Lafontaine, and then sold into a private collection in France before it was acquired recently by the Hood Museum of Art. - I-. 1 ?: .-"-"i ?, ??~-i~ r .;? ? :? - : u ?-=,-- ~:td~ '" ?:_::: ':-". 1:7[~ :?

Jaffe and Evelyn F Jaffe (58, 60, &amp; 63) Fund, 2003.11.35526 Medicine gourds such as this example represent the ubiquitous type of con- tainer made and used by healers in northeastern Tanzania and elsewhere in East Africa. These medicine containers, called nkhoba by the Shambaa and Zigua peoples, are used to contain physical and symbolic medicines and to represent and/or embody spirits that aid in the healing practice. The exterior decorations of the gourd define particular characteristics of the represented or embodied spirit. The knotted fibers around the waist of this particular gourd may indicate that its was used to battle malevolent human or spirit forces. The carved features of the stopper of this nkhoba are a classic example of the Shambaa-Zigua style, with schematic facial features and large, prominent C-shaped ears. The pony-tail-like hairstyle of the represented figure is indica- tive of the hair tuft worn by young male initiates when in seclusion. 26. Standing male figure Shambaa peoples, Tanzania, nineteenth to early twentieth century Wood, organic substances; 46.8cm x 10cm (183/8" x 4") Purchased through the Alvin and Mary Bert Gutman 1940 Fund, 2003.32.35527 Commonly referred to as ughanga wa kae or "medicines of the past," stand- ing figures such as this male captive are rarely used or seen in situ today. The twisting of the figure's torso, the bound legs and hands, and the grin- ning expression correlate to narratives of older-and aggressive-spirit cat- egories (mphepo, more commonly referred to as jeni today). However, contemporary references to such figures relate also to local experiences with the Indian Ocean slave trade in which Shambaa and Zigua peoples were taken captive by Arab slave traders. The figure would have been used in benevolent or malevolent medicine practices (ughanga or ushai) to pro- mote or counteract spirit or human malevolency. 27. Detail of a staff with figurative finial Makonde peoples, Mozambique, late nineteenth to early twentieth century Wood; 54.9cm x 3.3cm x 3cm (215/8" x 11/4" x 11/8") Purchased through the William B. Jaffe and Evelyn A. Jaffe Hall Fund, 2003.3.35525 Figurative staffs, such as this example, make up an important genre of ex- pressive arts in East Africa. These staffs are used by the Makonde peoples in a variety of contexts: as objects of prestige; professional insignia or title of its owner (most commonly high-ranking individuals such as healers, diviners, and chiefs); as physical representations of spirit beings; or as dance or display items. summer 2004 - african arts 29</page><page sequence="17">JEFFREY NINTZEL leader (mfumu kanda; Cover), and an African-Portuguese cross from an Old Portuguese church at Sa6 Salvador, former capital of the kingdom of the Kongo from the sixteenth to the eighteenth century, now known as M'Banza Congo in Angola (Fig. 23).

Untitled, 1970s Twins Seven Seven, Nigerian 1944- Acrylic and felt-tipped pen on plywood; 60.3cm x 122cm (2334" x 48") Gift of Edward B. Marks, President, Class of 1932, in memory of Tom Marks, Class of 1965, D.2003.21.1 Twins Seven Seven was born Taiwo Olaniyi Oyewale Aitoyeje in Ogidi Ikumu, Nigeria, in 1944. He is one of the most multitalented artists from the Oshogbo school, expressing his artistic vision through painting, drawing, sculpting, de- signing textiles, and metalwork. Twins fills his works, as characterized by this example, with fantastic creatures, a world inhabited by characters and imagery from Yoruba oral traditions, myths, and religion as well as images from his own personal experience, which is densely populated with a sense of horror vacui Each image is carefully outlined in ink and filled in with scrib- bled, scratched, and hatched lines.

Jaffe Hall Fund, P.2003.7 Chief Muraina Oyelami was born in Iragbiji, Nigeria, in 1940 and is one of the leading artists of the Oshogbo school in Nigeria. As one of the founding mem- bers of the Oshogbo school, Oyelami participated in the well-known 1964 workshop of the school during the heyday of Nigerian modern painting. His visual art works are characterized by simplicity of form and subtlety of color, a style he developed early in his career and has maintained to the present. His forms are emphasized through bold strokes, painted and drawn simulta- neously, leaving the strokes as textures. He uses line to define but also to cre- ate crisp details. His themes are often introspective, revealing human fragility, irony, and vulnerability, often defining character with uncanny precision. The Jester, an important character as both entertainer and trickster, represents a modern version of the Yoruba god Eshu-Elegba. its collections.12 Both in preparation for the celebration of its twentieth anniversary in 2005 and in setting new goals for the future, the Hood Museum of Art has recently taken a new di- rection in its collection and exhibition goals, paying particular attention to works from underrepresented regions of Africa, especially figurative arts from East Africa.

In keeping with its mobile and versatile past and working closely with the Hood Museum's curators and collections of American, European, and contemporary arts, the African collec- tion has expanded its interests to modem and contemporary arts in recent years, developing a dialogue that blurs the boundaries of geography and time. This cross-regional dialogue enables art works from different regions of the world to inform each other and reflect the cultural interaction that more closely resembles actuali- ty rather than historical paradigms. Serving the particular interests of Dartmouth's current curricula in anthropology, art history, stu- dio arts, and history around discussions of cultural exchange and appropriation, examples from the African modernist movement have been added to its holdings. Some of these include art works from the early to late years of the Oshogbo school, including a drawing by Twins Seven Seven (Fig. 28), a tapestry by Fabunmi Adebisi, and a recent painting by Muraina Oyelami (Fig. 29).

Jaffe and Evelyn A. Jaffe Hall Fund, and through gifts from the Dickey Fund and the Leslie Humanities Center, T.2003.6 Nike Davies-Okundaye is a textile artist who has carried her adire batik for- mations from a polygamous compound in Oshogbo, Nigeria, to internation- al workshops and centers of culture all over the world. She was brought up by her great grandmother, who was an indigo dyer, a weaver, and also the head of the craftswomen of the village. In 1960 Nike, impressed by the artis- tic community in Oshogbo, moved there to gain more practical knowledge and to immerse herself in the life of the artistic community which has come to be known as the Oshogbo Group. She married one of the founding artists of this group, Twins Seven-Seven, and spent the next sixteen years per- fecting her art, working with her co-wives and other women in the commu- nity. By the 1970s her aptitude as a unique artist was being acknowledged not only locally but also abroad and her works have been collected in Nigeria as also abroad. Her style development since the 1970s has ranged from batik art and adire cloth to quilts combining textiles using different techniques and designs, all derived from traditional African aspects. 31.

Purchased through the William B. Jaffe and Evelyn A. Jaffe Fund, PR. 2002.67.5 Bernie Searle's series Stain provides a very personal journey into the issues of race relations of Apartheid and post-Apartheid South Africa. In her work, Searle focuses much of her attention on the notion of measuring ethnicity, race, and skin color. In this particular work she plays with the dictionary def- initions of the word "stain," which when coupled with the images of henna- stained body parts takes on multiple layers of meanings relating to the tainting of races, access to power (or lack thereof) through the degree of coloring to one's skin, and the infliction of physical abuse and pain. summer 2004 - african arts 31</page><page sequence="19">~p~t~ JEFFREY NINTZEL i~ F JEFFREY NINTZEL 32 african arts s summer 2004</page><page sequence="20">Opposite page, counterclockwise from top left: 33. Noir #211, 2000 Angele Etoundi Essamba, Cameroonian, 1962- Gelatin silver print; 47.9cm x 34.3cm (187/8' X 131/2") Purchased through the Alvin and Mary Bert Gutman 1940 Acquisition Fund, PH. 2003. 30.1 The theme of "contrast" is central in Essamba's work, especially as a black woman living in a white world. Essamba is inspired to picture the world in black and white, with otherness, identity, duality, modernity, and tradition serving as a means of differences that can be harmonized in the image. This image of a highlighted African or black woman's pregnant stomach is dramatically framed and shadowed by a black cloth and chiaroscuro light- ing that abstracts the form of the belly into a kind of still life. Essamba de- rives her imagery from the different cultural backgrounds in which she has lived: the cultural mix of an upbringing dominated by her African heritage and the globalism of her life as a transnational artist. The erotic, mystic, and aesthetic themes continually recur in her work, as in this example, which plays upon both the aesthetic and mystical aspects of pregnancy as well as the eroticism often inscribed upon black women by white society. 34. Double Fuse, 2003 Wangechi Mutu, Kenyan, 1972- Ink and collage on mylar; Panel 1 of 2: 114.1cm x 91.8 cm (45" x 361/8"); Panel 2 of 2: 113.8 x 91.8 cm (443/4m x 361/8.) Purchased through the Charles F Venrick 1936 Fund, MIS.2003.38 Double Fuse (2003), by the Kenyan-born artist Wangechi Mutu, blends draw- ing, painting, and cut-out fragments of imagery from fashion, wild life, trav- el, and motor-sports magazines into seductive and powerful women who confront Western stereotypes and representations of native, marginalized, and non-European women. Upon closer inspection, however, the incon- gruity of shapes, sizes, textures, materials, and colors create figures that are more reminiscent of cybernetic constructions than of humans. Mutu, who plays with such dichotomies as biological/artificial, human/machine, black/white, soft/hard, feminine/masculine, and Western/non-Western, teas- es out the boundaries between balance and disproportion, beauty and de- formation. Her hybrid women become shocking parodies of stereotypes pertaining to exotic native woman, forcing the viewer to question assump- tions about race, gender, geography, history, and beauty. 35. Untitled, 2001 Magdalene Odundo, Kenyan, 1950- Oxidized and reduced terracotta; 58.4cm x 24.8cm x 24.8cm (23" x 93/4m x 93/4") Purchased through the William B. Jaffe and Evelyn A. Jaffe Hall Fund and the Claire and Richard P. Morse 1953 Fund, C.2003.50 This vessel represents the form of ceramic sculpture for which the Kenyan- born artist Magdalene Odundo is best known. Odundo, who lives and works in London, works with a well-defined vocabulary of vessel types that she has developed since the 1980s-a genre that expresses blatant references to Mangbetu anthropomorphic pottery and nineteenth century colonial por- traiture of Mangbetu females. Yet her work also makes more subtle refer- ences to pottery traditions from around the world including blackware in Uganda, Kenya, and South Africa; Late Bronze Age Cypriot and Cycladic ceramic ware; and Pueblo pottery of the American Southwest, where she received some training. As evident in this example, Odundo is interested in the ways that the female body has been defined and reshaped over time and across the world to conform to standards of beauty that are often estab- lished by males who create and support the norms, social values, and ex- pectations of womanhood and female beauty.

Parker and John O. Parker '58 Acquisition Fund, PH.2003.36 This recent photograph by Malick Sidibe shows the artist's changing self- perception and method of working with more emphasis on artistic composi- tion than straightforward portraiture. Unlike his earlier work, in which he captured snap-shots of night life in the clubs and modern youths in the streets and portrait studios of Bamako, Mali, Sidibe now works in a staged setting with a model, appropriating colonial icons such as the reclining nude figure, widely known as the "odalisque" in Western art. adire quilt by the contemporary artist Nike Davies-Okundaye (Fig. 30) complements more traditional adire textiles (Fig. 31) collected by Adrian Wasler in and around Abeokuta, Nigeria, in 1977.

As with the other regional collections at the Hood Museum, the African collection strongly reflects the earlier history of the institution and the unification of two disparate collection modes focusing on the dichotomous notions of "art" and "artifact." What began almost 230 years ago as a cabinet of rare and in- triguing curiosities containing fossils, stuffed animals, and other "souvenirs of important or strange events" (Bass 1985:10) is now one of the oldest and largest college museums in the country, housing more than 60,000 objects from around the world, in- cluding over 1,800 from the African continent. Despite its hum- ble beginnings, its struggle for survival, 13 and the occasional setback,14 the museum has continued to serve as an important educational resource for Dartmouth's faculty and students as well as for public audiences throughout northern New England. Since the opening of its new facility in 1985, the museum en- deavors to open up the forum for less regionalized and ghet- toized discussions about visual expression and to embrace a global perspective that does not privilege one form of expression over another or one region of the world over another. With its more balanced program of exhibitions, publications, and educa- tional services, the Hood Museum of Art seeks to make a signif- icant contribution to the understanding of the theory and history of the arts and their relation to the broader context of the cultur- ally diverse world in which we live. 0 Notes, page 93 summer 2004 - african arts 33</page><page sequence="21">notes THOMPSON: Notes, from page 33 [This article was accepted for publication in September 2003.] I would like to thank Risa Needleman, curatorial intern at the Hood Museum of Art from 2003 to 2004, and Deborah Haynes, data manager at the Hood Museum of Art, for their assistance with collecting data from the museum archives. 1. Quotes from the Charter of Dartmouth College, December 13, 1769. Dartmouth College was named after William Legge, the second earl of Dartmouth, an important supporter of Eleazor Wheelock's efforts to establish the college. 2. A mastodon molar and a portion of a tusk were among the objects sent by McClure to the budding museum, both of which exhibit all the traits of the famous paleontological site Big Bone Lick, in Boone County, northern Kentucky. These specimens were transferred in 1928 from the Butterfield Museum at Dartmouth to the geology department, with the molar being recovered by Dartmouth College Museum in 1957 and the tusk in 1958 (Bowen 1958:1). 3. It was not until 1810 that the museum collection was sys- tematically recorded into official accession records. Hence, prior to 1810, records and documentation of museum acqui- sitions was negligible, if extant at all, making the dating of particular acquisitions difficult to determine. 4. Hall had become acquainted with the museum collection when he was appointed as Inspector of Dartmouth College Museum, a one-year postgraduate position, from 1804 to 1805. 5. This excerpt, based on a public relations text released by the museum at the time of the acquisition, was taken from the Hood Museum of Art object files, which includes a copy of "College Museum Has Notable Collection," from the Hanover Gazette, Thursday, November 9, 1939, p. 1. 6. Except for a brief period of reunion with the ethnographic collection from 1840 to 1870, the painting collection remained separate from the museum collection and fell under the aegis of Dartmouth College Library. In 1962, the portrait collection and other sections of the fine art collection were moved to the Hopkins Center Art Galleries, where they remained until their final move to the new facility of the Hood Museum of Art (Bass 1985:18). 7. The reliefs were acquired by the museum in 1856. 8. John Wentworth was governor of the Royal Province of New Hampshire and provided the land upon which Dart- mouth would be built. 9. Orozco painted this famous mural in Baker Reserve Library from 1932 to 1934 while in residence at Dartmouth College. 10. In 1913, Picasso gave Guitar on a Table (1912) to Gertrude Stein. The painting was later acquired Nelson A. Rockefeller, who donated it to Dartmouth College. 11. The ethnographic collection made up about 54% of the College Museum's holdings in 1985, numbering about 20,000 objects, including about 1,300 examples from Africa. 12. Today, the museum's ethnographic collection comprises a little over half of the museum's holdings, with the African collection representing about 3% of the entire Hood Museum collection. 13. Between 1815 and 1820, the Dartmouth College Case--a bitter fight to remain a private college rather than become a state university-drained the College of its financial re- sources. During this time and in the ensuing years of recov- ery, the development of the museum collections took a direct hit, with its collections of art and artifacts shifting from one discipline to another in response to diverse teaching and dis- play needs. 14. In 1798 a fire broke out in Dartmouth Hall, the location of the museum at that time, which damaged some of its con- tents. Then in 1811, some students protested the location of the museum in Dartmouth Hall by blowing down the walls of the museum with a canon, nearly wrecking the whole building (Bass 1985:13).
