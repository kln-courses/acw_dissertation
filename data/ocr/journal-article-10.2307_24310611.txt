There are large areas where plantations would likely be successful. Yet plantation establishment among landholders in Vanuatu has been limited to date, even with considerable extension support. There has been little systematic investigation of why this has occurred. The purpose of this research was to identify constraints to whitewood (Endospermum medullosum) plantation development. A participatory social research approach was used on Espíritu Santo Island to look for trends in attitudes toward plantations. This was achieved through the use of mixed methods social research to survey 139 local land holders from 42 villages. Most landholders on Santo Island were not convinced that there are good reasons to plant whitewood, at least not in large extensions. Future efforts should be focused on the development of local capacity for plantation establishment, maintenance, processing and export marketing, at a variety of scales.

VIRANAMANGGA Les arbres de bois de coupe de valeur dans les sites accessibles à Vanuatu ont été pour la plupart éclaircis par la coupe. Il existe de vastes zones où les plantations seraient à même d'avoir du succès. Cependant, l'établissement des plantations a été limitée chez les propriétaires terriens de Vanuatu jusqu'à présent, malgré unsupport considérable pour les extensions. Il n'y a eu que très peu d'investigations systématiques pour comprendre les raisons de cette timidité. Le but de cette recherche a été d'identifier les contraintes affectant le développement des plantations de bois blanc ( Endospermum medullosum). Une approche de recherche sociale participationnelle a été utilisée sur l'île Espíritu Santo pour chercher des courants dans l'attitude vis à vis des plantations. Ils ont été obtenus en utilisant des méthodes mixtes de recherche sociale pour interviewer 139 propriétaires locaux provenant de 42 villages différents. La plupart des propriétaires de l'île Santo n'étaient pas convaincus de l'existence de bonnes raisons pour planter du bois blanc, du moins, pas en extensions larges. Les efforts futurs devraient se concentrer sur le développement de la capacité locale d'établir, de maintenir, de traiter , et d'effectuer le marketing des exportations des plantations, à une variété d'échelles.

VIRANAMANGGA En Vanuatu, los árboles de especies maderables valiosas han sido talados en su mayoría en los lugares accesibles. Existen grandes áreas donde las plantaciones tendrían una gran probabilidad de éxito. Sin embargo, el establecimiento de plantaciones en Vanuatu por parte de propietarios ha sido limitado hasta la fecha, a pesar del considerable apoyo de los servicios de extensión. Apenas se han realizado estudios sistemáticos para averiguar por qué sucede esto. El propósito de esta investigación fue identificar impedimentos al desarrollo de plantaciones de Endospermum medullosum. Se empleó un enfoque de investigación social participativa en la isla de Espíritu Santo, en busca de pautas de comportamiento y actitudes respecto de las plantaciones.

INTRODUCTION Value of whitewood in plantations Vanuatu's forests and people In 1996 the Vanuatu government, through the Vanuatu National Forest policy, set a goal of establishing 20,000 hect Vanuatu is an archipelago of 83 islands in the south-west ares of forest plantations by 2023 (Department of Forests Pacific with approximately 36% forest cover (&gt;10m tree 1999).

Future plantation establishment was also constrained by competition with other tree species, particularly big-leaf mahogany (Swietenia macrophylla) grown for its high-value timber and seed, and land competition for food crops. In regard to future plantings, landholders in the central-east region were least likely to plant more trees at only 23% of the additional land area available, being an extra 0.9ha/landholder compared to landholders in the north-east who were prepared to increase plantings by 1.7 ha per landholder, using some 80% of the additional arable land available.

New Caledonia has since ing countries to offer the greatest opportunities (Vanclay et al. emerged as the dominant export market for Vanuatu hard- 2006), particularly those that incorporate an understanding woods. Nevertheless, whitewood is considered to provide a °f 'oca' value systems, provide technical support and work niche timber product with values projected to remain stable towards empowering the poor and disadvantaged through at around US$819/m3 as processed mouldings and other participatory decision making (Garen et al. 2009, McDermott products for interior use as of June 2009 (McGregor and and Schreckenberg 2009). Further, research is recommended McGregor 2010) Another trend in timber marketing has been 'n the processing and marketing of whitewood to ensure that the large volume of New Zealand radiata pine (Pinus radia ta) the benefits of timber growing and processing are shared structural timber imported since year 2002 for use in the widely throughout the community.

This could be explained in part by the substantial body here-A study related to this ProÍect was implemented in 2011: of research already conducted on this species (SPRIG 1997) assessment of the current value-chain of whitewood and and the existence of established markets for mahogany.

This is research and Snook (2006) highlight the potential high growth rates of involvin§ extensive interviews of landholders, loggers, mahogany in plantations in the tropics, where it is not attacked sawmillers, and processors both on Santo and the island of by shoot borers (Hypsipyla spp.) which are found in areas where the tree is native (Mayhew and Newton 1998). Mahogany produces highly valued timber, with 2009 prices of US$300/m3 for finished lumber (ITTO 2009). While the Hypsipyla shoot borer has been found in Vanuatu (Floyd et al. 2003), it is too early to know whether the pest will create serious long-term problems. Efate.

These findings are supported this environment where the biophysical conditions are highly in research by Richardson et al. (2011) and Nielsen and suitable. It appears that primarily a lack of clear options for Reenberg (2010), who suggest that culture can act as a major using and-or selling whitewood, either as standing trees, logs, barrier to livelihood improvement strategies, particularly in or boards is a major factor impeding the development of more</page><page sequence="9">422 R.

The essentially subsistence culture of rural Santo, combined with other more familiar options for earning income, that is growing food crops or kava, also may partially explain the lack of more whitewood plantations.
