<plain_text><page sequence="1">AUTHENTICITY AND ITS MODERNIST DISCONTENTS: THE COLONIAL ENCOUNTER AND AFRICAN AND MIDDLE EASTERN ART HISTORY Prita Meier Well into the 1980s, art historians working in European and North American institutions focused almost exclusively on the "traditional" and "pre-modern" arts of so-called non-Western cultures. With rare exception, scholars only studied those forms and images apprehended as unspoiled by colonization and modernization. The mutually constitutive relation ship between North Atlantic imperial governmentality and modes of knowledge production made such a framework possible. For example, the overarching division between "non-Western" and "Western" fields of study mirrored the seemingly planetary division of colonizer and colo nized.1 The colonized occupied a pre-modern or counter-modern position in the resultant sch?mas and "non-Western" peoples were understood to be the object and even victim of modern colonization, but not modern subjects. But with the cultural turn in the humanities and social sciences from the 1980s onward, new avenues of analysis opened up. Art historians, too, began to engage the perspectives of post-colonial criticism to interrogate the hegemonic assumptions that consigned visual production identified as non-Western to an always lagging, derivative, or lower position within Prita Meier is a Fellow in the Society for the Humanities at Cornell University. 12</page><page sequence="2">Meier the grand narrative of Western progress. Scholars and critics began con sidering how to write about cultural production in/from formerly colo nized territories without resorting to Eurocentric taxonomies of cultural difference. As a result, African and Middle Eastern artists, once invisible in art historical narratives, are now celebrated as transcultural cosmopol itans who deploy modernism to critique the "darker side of modernity."2 How was such a perspectival shift possible? This article attends to this important change by considering how re searchers forced the foregoing concerns to the forefront of intellectual in quiry. Rather than a comprehensive survey, I trace a specific genealogy of modern identity as it is narrativized for artists who experienced colonial ism.3 In particular, I compare the construction of "African" and "Middle Eastern" modernism(s) within the knowledge worlds of North Atlantic art historical institutions. Understood as "non-Western" sites sharing in tersecting geographies and histories, Africa and the Middle East have been constituted in relationship (even one of disavowal) to each other. Also, as spaces of inquiry that demand a serious engagement with the legacy of colonialism, both share closely intertwined critical agendas. Yet their his toriographies also diverge, since studies of Middle Eastern and African modernism(s) emerged respectively from an engagement with the fields of Islamic and "traditionar7"classical" African art history. In recent years, exhibitions about the relationship between represen tation and coloniality have focused on contemporary multi-media artists such as Walid Raad and Yinka Shonibare. Their work certainly interro gates this relationship, but colonialism and the independence struggle is a past these artists did not personally experience. They participate in such prominent art exhibitions as Dokumenta and the Venice Biennale and their multi- or post-media work consciously overturns modernist visual vocabularies and concepts. They subvert attempts to define their practice by place or identity markers and therefore they are often characterized as transnational or postnational. But the initial thrust within the discipline of art history focused on artists who did not enjoy such "distance," as they practiced at the border of colonial subjecthood and post-colonial citizen ship. For artists such as Farid Belkahia, Skunder Boghossian, Munir Canaan, Uzo Egonu, Paul Guiragossian, Rachid Koraichi, Ernest Mancoba, Ibrahim El Salahi, and Jawad Salim, the colonial encounter was not a his 13</page><page sequence="3">torical or analytical category, but a specific place of experience and per sonal memory. The first critical rebuttal of the paradigm of "otherness" in art history was to claim coevalness for these artists, which modernism as an analyti cal framework appeared to offer.4 Artists and intellectuals based in Africa and the Middle East already considered how their modernist practice was constituted by their location outside the m?tropole during the colonial period. But major art institutions in the West did not consider Afro-, Arab, Middle Eastern and/or transnational modernism(s) until the early 1990s.5 Curators, critics, and scholars spearheading this major shift, such as Salah M. Hassan, Okwui Enwezor, Elizabeth Harney, Chika Okeke-Agulu, Sylvester Ogbechie, Sidney Kasfir, John Picton, Kamal Boulatta, Salwa Mikdadi, Venetia Porter, Nada Shabout, and Wijdan Ali, employed a range of intersecting strategies. The intellectual and activist practices enframing their projects led to seeing and analyzing those arts, once considered de rivative, as constitutive of modernism. Insisting on a modern subject posi tion for artists from/in formerly colonized places inserts them into the universalizing temporal and interpretive zone of modernism. For exam ple, Chika Okeke-Agulu therefore argued that "[African modern art] has been with us from modernisms inception, and yet ... time and time again has seemed to need validation within the study of twentieth century art."6 Similarly, Shiva Balaghi states, cc [1] ike artists working in Paris and New York, artists in Tehran lived in 'the Century of Machinery, Speed and the Atom."7 This strategic move not only includes African and Middle Eastern art ists in an established, and perhaps outworn, canon of twentieth-century high modernism or gives "voice" to the formerly marginalized. Rather, such a shift speaks to and even nurtures, even if unintentionally, a par ticular relationship between modern cultural production and colonialism. On one level it suggests a revolutionary transgression against the binaries and inequalities of modern Western imperialism. Yet these critiques are launched from within the discourse of modernity. Modernity is posi tioned as a necessary mode of analysis for understanding those cultures once demarcated as outside of the modern experience by that discourse. As a result, bringing formerly colonized places underneath the analytic umbrella of modernity creates a terrain where the relationship between 14</page><page sequence="4">Meier colonialism, decolonization, and post-independence nationalism con stantly demands accounting. Scholars working with Middle Eastern and African modernism(s) as a subject of intellectual inquiry therefore raise central questions about how one can liberate experience and knowledge from Eurocentric norms and values. How can one produce post-colonial intellectual work without losing sight of the specific historical moment and location of the colonial encounter? Why is it particularly effective to employ the category of the modern to counter ethnocentric visions of world culture, when from a historical perspective, modernism as a con ceptual apparatus for global engagement is created by an imperial culture, making colonization possible? Curating Modern Art, or the Problem of Modernity in the Visual Field From the early 1990s onwards, exhibitions and their accompanying cata logues have served as the primary platform to not only redress scholarly dismissals of non-Western modernist artistic practice, but also challenge a larger public to reconsider their assumptions regarding the cultural pro duction of Africa and the Middle East.8 In the exhibitions of the early to mid 1990s, such as Creative Impulses/Modern Expressions: Four African Artists (US A, 1993), Forces of Change: Artists of the Arab World (USA, 1994), Seven Stories About Modern Art in Africa (UK, 1996), "the modern" was utilized for contemporary marginalized artists more generally.9 In fact, Salah M. Hassan argued for the use of "modern" for the analysis of "new African artistic expressions," because "[to] call it 'modern' distinguishes it from the merely contemporary."10 This was important to his projects be cause "modernism in the African context, as elsewhere, entails a self-con scious attempt to break with the past and a search for new forms of expres sions."" For these curators, "modern" suggests a set of formal strategies, employing easel painting and abstraction, for example. It was also an in tellectual sensibility, embracing the "new" and breaking with the past. More recent exhibitions begin to make a distinction between contem porary and modern art as categories of practice and analysis, aware that in normative art history "modernism" also has periodizing connotations and demarcates a formalist sensibility in art history. Also, by the late 15</page><page sequence="5">1990s the visual "style" of contemporary art is defined by multi-media conceptual practices, simply put: the post-modernist visualities estab lished from the 1960s onward. Exhibitions such as The Short Century: Independence and Liberation Movements in Africa, 1945-1994 (USA and Germany, 2001) and Picturing Iran: Art, Society, and Revolution (USA, 2002) distanced themselves from questions of form and aesthetic practice. Rather, their organizers think of modernism as a "worldly" field of poli tics, focusing on the liberation struggle and the search for national au tonomy. The accompanying publications suggest that understanding modernist artistic practice is not a question of interpreting the appropria tion, translation and reframing of Western material form. In Picturing Iran, Shiva Balaghi continues to be committed to "mapping the modern," but argues that art historians focus too much on material form: "Their conceptualization of hybridity divides art into form, which is learned in and borrowed from the West, and content, whose raw material is abstract ed from national cultures."12 Thus, she observes with some frustration that for forty years the central question in her field continues to be, "Is this art modern and is it Iranian?" She suggests that simply focusing on formal issues elides the central issue of political struggle: Iranian artists in the 1960s and 1970s were engaged in the search for a solution to "the problem of culture" under capitalism. In the cultural lexicon of Iran, the "West" did not simply represent a higher civiliza tional model to be emulated, but an imposing presence on its national autonomy.13 Similarly, in The Short Century Okwui Enwezor seeks to focus on the cul tural dimension of decolonization for understanding African modernism. Rather than an account of the appropriation of European forms or ideas by Africans, African modernism is framed as a tactic of subversion and rebellion. The Short Century "concerns the African systematization, de ployment and usage of modern forms, values, and structure."14 Thus, while form is still part of the analysis, he seeks to move beyond it by bring ing "values" and "structure" to the equation. According to Enwezor, the modernism of the N?gritude movement "achieved its first synthesis through an act of internal reflexivity on the status and value of African culture."15 As an intellectual project it insisted 16</page><page sequence="6">Meier on the "originality of an African culture in the making of modernity.16 N?gritude is thus a "modernist avant-garde ... based on the construction of an ethic, a field of practice, and on the primacy of African subjectivity and subject matter in order to contradict colonial alienation."17 Clearly, the exact relationship between modernity and modernism as artistic prac tice and the claim-making politics of such concepts as "avant-garde" are left unanalyzed by Enwezor. While he insists that this modernism "is not founded on an ideology of the universal," modernity is predicated on the existence of the universal.18 He seeks to elide this contradiction by making the universal an "internal" African site, from which modernity's most cel ebrated artistic trope can be launched: modernist avant-garde originality. This move also begins to illustrate how modernist conceptions of moder nity produce a tension between particularism and universalism by natu ralizing the notion of cultural difference.19 Clearly, The Short Century and Picturing Iran significantly reconsid ered the politics of "modern art" for Africa and the Middle East beyond the formal and aesthetic. These exhibitions were first and foremost con cerned with emphasizing the neglected context of the colonial encounter for modernist cultural practices. Yet in shifting the focus in such a man ner, the unresolved issue of the geopolitics of modernity comes to the fore. As an epistemic framework, modernity is unequivocally Eurocentered, since "the outside is named from the inside in the exercise of the colonial ity of power."20 The overarching conceptual map of modernity requires two complementary spaces, the "Here and the Elsewhere" or the West and non-West, where each cultural complex occupies a topographic node of either center or periphery on a universal world map. Such a geography of the imagination has a temporal marking as well, since the non-West or periphery is also the site of "being behind."21 This way of seeing the world therefore claims a "universal" perspective. Modernity is what Michel Rolph Trouillot has called a "North Atlantic universal," a concept nur tured within the matrix of coloniality that in its very inception places the West as the center of human enunciation, but naturalizes this locative strategy as a "placeless" universal site. North Atlantic universals so under stood are "always seductive, at times even irresistible, exactly because they manage, in that projection, to hide their specific?localized, North Atlantic, and thus parochial?historical location."22 Its temporal inception is the 17</page><page sequence="7">sixteenth century, when an interconnected world system began to be im agined as a result of the global expansion of the North Atlantic commer cial circuit. This was the inception of modernity, when modern individu ality and its concomitant societal structures began to "make sense" for the newly forming world of global capitalist production and consumption. As a civilizational marker, the West claimed modernity for itself, but since it was necessarily a comparative mode of self-perception, it legiti mated the imagining of a globally interconnected and interdependent community.23 But, as the construction of an African and Middle Eastern modernism clearly indicates, it was also a potentially empowering para digm to critique other aspects of its discourse. With its bundled concepts (or fantasies) of rationality and the universal rights of man (who can de fine and declare these was and is contested), colonized intellectuals and cultural workers quickly appropriated modernity as a strategy precisely because it was the potential site from which they could force their recogni tion as rights-bearing members of global community. Authenticity Paradox A central unresolved issue in the revision of the modern is the role authen ticity plays as an evaluative paradigm of artistic practice. This is often explained as a tension between the local and the global and particularism and universalism, but modernity as a representational schema already presupposes the existence of fixed cultural spaces, envisioning any en gagement beyond a single location as a disruptive, but often productive, move against a putative norm. While modernism often celebrates such a transgression as a cosmopolitan critique of nativism or nationalism, it still upholds that place based difference is embodied by individuals attached to these places. Thus, even if difference is not reduced to a matter of pheno type or locale in these narratives, the cultured subject is its affect. In its modernist articulation, difference upholds the West as the normative center; but at times difference, which is located outside the modern West, is able to revitalize the center through its deviation from the norm. The inscription of non-Western modernism as a category of analysis often in advertently reproduces this geography of cultural difference, where the non-Western must be a real place of authenticity. The very articulation of 18</page><page sequence="8">Meier a modernist art historical narrative also demands the teleology of artistic originality, in which the artists autonomous vision creates an original ob ject. Scholarship seeking to excavate the specificity and historical context of regional modernism(s) thus has an ambivalent relationship to the con tinued specter of the colonial encounter and the emergence of the nation state, since the age of global capitalism and imperialism is understood as the moment inaugurating an unprecedented onslaught against the purity of non-Western place. Seemingly paradoxically, the notion of a geographically defined indi geneity, a concept scripted under the crucible of imperialism and much critiqued by postcolonial theory and contemporary artists, was deployed by art historians focusing on historical modernism. Thus, Hassan writes, " .. .long ago Africans and other Third-World people entered the dialogue on modernism and have challenged it on their own soil."24 The theorization of "multiple," "alternative," "hybrid," or "parallel" modernities by Arjun Appadurai, Dilip Parameshwar Gaonkar, Paul Gilroy, and others seeks to decenter ethnocentric and colonial paradigms of research by putting forth a heterogeneous notion of modernity.25 Such scholarship attempts to change the periphery/center model as a starting point of inquiry and instead begins with a focus on the relationship be tween diverse actors who encountered and reworked each others ways of being at the interstices of global networks of exchange.26 For these theore ticians of modernity, the historical moment of this multiplicity ranges widely, from the sixteenth to the early twentieth century. In contrast, for scholars of African and Middle Eastern artistic modernism(s), the colonial period clearly inaugurates the beginning of modernist practice. The unresolved role of modernity is dealt with by eliding a distinction between modernity and modernism. Theories of "cosmopolitan," "discrepant," "alternative," or "vernacular" modernity therefore become stories about multiple aesthetic modernisms, whose plurality is assumed to exist because they are physically located outside of the West, yet, as Balaghi stated in Picturing Iran, Middle Eastern artists, like their western colleagues, also "lived in 'the Century of Machinery, Speed and the Atom.'"27 Elizabeth Harney's groundbreaking In Senghors Shadow: Art, Politics, and the Avant-Garde in Senegal, 1960-1995 (2004) begins with a similar conflation. She states her "research on the history of 19</page><page sequence="9">Negritude-inspired visual arts and the birth of Senegalese modernism draws on models from current scholarship that addresses non-Western 'parallel' or 'alternative' modernisms."28 Harney cites Dilip Parameshwar Gaonkar's Alternative Modernities as a key source for understanding "al ternative" or "parallel modernisms," even though, this edited volume never inflects modernism with plurality. Regardless, Harney's work is the first sustained study of an African post-independence art world, where modernism is enacted by artists who are "self-proclaimed avant-gardists engaged in interesting and often surprising ways with European modern ist visual techniques and aesthetic concerns."29 Notably, she eschews inter pretive models that posit the appropriation of foreign ideas and practices by Senegalese artists as a dialogue or encounter with the West. Rather, she is interested in how artists deployed these strategies within the context of an institutionalization of an art patronage system in post-independence Senegal. Her work begins to push against the idea of place-based authen ticity, but ultimately local authenticity is still personified by the figure of the self-conscious artist. The artist embodies the bounded identity of his or her "home," but also appropriates diverse global imaging and concep tual technologies to create modernist work. The work of Senegalese artists is evaluated as "interesting and often surprising" because it is "avant garde" and vanguardist. But its meaning is located in a place of difference that is beyond, yet contingent upon, the hegemonic control of the m?tropole. At the same time, Hassan, Balaghi, and Nada Shabout have recently questioned the very notion of multiple modernity and modernisms, sug gesting that modernity is already transnational or global at its moment and site of articulation.30 However, even while making this observation, none of these authors push their observation to the point of considering what this means for thinking about a place-specific notion of aesthetic modernism. To be authentic and modern, artists are still retroactively expected to prove their ability to break away from colonial culture, while remaining true to a specific place. Artists themselves did deploy such terms as "avant garde" and argued for the validity of their modernist practice. European primitivism, which inscribed difference onto the colonized in order to critique European nationalism, also enabled a transnational and transcul tural articulation of Pan-African creative identity. This notion of cultural difference, while a product of the colonial encounter, was re-imagined as 20</page><page sequence="10">Meier a positive way of being to counter racist degradations of that very differ ence. For example, work on Nigerian and Egyptian modernism (see be low) clearly documents how artists theorized their appropriation of Western media vis-?-vis the nation-building project. Yet scholarship con flates their enunciations and performances of modernist concepts with modernist frameworks of analysis. This conflation will always produce the suggestion of an illogical contradiction, since this framing pushes against the constitutive inside/outside of modernity. Contemporary postcolonial artists and Western modernists are allowed to play with notions of au thenticity, in fact it becomes sites of critique, but a lingering disquiet un derpins the frameworks employed to make sense of artists working during the colonial period. This is precisely because scholars interpreting their work often de-historize the modern and posit it as simply a marker of positive valuation. Clearly, this scholarship has opened up new spaces of inquiry that are vitally important, yet their work exhibits an unease re garding the implication of their intervention. Employing terms such as "avant-garde" and "original" demarcates a space of value within the mod ernist canon. To understand why "authenticity" remains an unresolved yet vital topic in the writings on African and Middle Eastern artists, one must understand the specific historiography of modern art history. On Modernism and Modernity in Art History From the perspective of artistic practice, modernity and modernism sig nify a set of interrelated conceptual frameworks, critical positions, and creative performances most often vaguely anchored temporally in the nineteenth to twentieth centuries. During the mid-nineteenth century, artists began positioning their work as a new beginning that rejected the conception of art practice as an expression of a period style patronized by such institutions as the French Academy and its official salons. Instead of working within an established style, artists could freely access any reper toire, from any period or place, to create an original work of art. More specifically, Peter B?rger has argued that this maneuver characterized the historical avant-garde, whose distinguishing feature is that it did not de velop a style. "There is no such thing as a dadaist or surrealist style. What did happen is that these movements liquidated the possibility of a period 21</page><page sequence="11">style when they raised to a principal the availability of the artistic means of past periods."31 This rebellion against artistic conventions was ultimately meant to contribute to "real" social and political revolutions. Artists utilized artis tic techniques, including montage, performance, found-object assemblage, pictorial abstraction, and the appropriation of vernacular (including non Western) and mass media forms, to shock the viewer and reject perceived traditions in both art and life. Their techniques not only critiqued nine teenth-century aestheticism and institutions of the status quo, but they also dedicated their practice to rending the perceived autonomy of the work of art from everyday life?rejecting the very category of "art." The individualistic self is posited as the source of the work and thus appropria tion is not a matter of passive influence, but rather a moment of radical invention and defamiliarization. This discourse continues to uphold the notion of the artist as a genius who creates an irreplaceable and original work of art, a standard trope in art historical scholarship from the six teenth century onward. The avant-garde therefore propagated what Rosalind Krauss has called a "discourse of originality," where work must be vanguardist and new to be authentic. As Krauss elaborates, "the theme of originality, encompassing as it does authenticity, originals, and origins, is the shared discursive practice of the museum, the historian, and the maker of art."32 Furthermore, in art historical studies, the "historical avant-garde" designates European artists who practiced around World War I; the appropriation of the term for earlier, later or non-European practitioners seeks to claim these now valorized strategies for politicizing aesthetic practice for artists in different periods or locations. "Modern" colonialism and "modern" art history are both late Victorian projects predicated on the creation of spatially bounded histori cal epochs and cultural spheres. While colonialism and imperialism were multifaceted enterprises, their knowledge-production projects participat ed in policing the imagined divisions between the civilizations of the world. The role of Western social, historical, and cultural scholarship in the creating bounded categories for "Western" and "non-Western" cul tures has been well-documented. Images and objects in particular were utilized to create a hierarchy of racial and cultural "types" based on evo lutionary models, with North Atlantic peoples at the apex and "non-West 22</page><page sequence="12">Meier erns" occupying various lower rungs.33 In turn, visual sch?mas became tools for the management of colonial and imperial interventions in such places as Africa and the Middle East. For example, the color illustrations of Description de V?gypte and the many anthropological publications fea turing photographs of African peoples produced easily digestible infor mation utilized to understand and manage would-be colonized subjects. These images created an inventory of people s "character" under the rubric of ethnic and racial taxonomies, assigning physical traits, and specific forms of dress and personal adornment to purportedly different cultural groups. Such taxonomies also proliferated precisely because the potential for "unacceptable intermingling" increased as the interconnectivity en gendered by global capitalism brought more and more seemingly separate cultures into physical contact.34 Similarly, nineteenth-century art history was keenly concerned with charting the progression of art through the ages and reworking the con cept of style to contribute to newly emerging understanding of global hu man history. Art historians such as Johann Winckelmann, Heinrich W?lfflin, Alois Riegl, and Josef Strzygowski employed racialist ideas to de lineate the purported visible, material, and symbolic divisions between cultures. For example, according to this model, the difference between German and Italian peoples could be visually differentiated by defining the essential stylistic typologies of German and Italian art, which was be lieved to the product of climatic and environmental difference.35 Central to mapping style across time and space is the concept of influence, which made the relationship between separate artists and art enclaves (or cent ers) comprehensible. The analytic framework of stylistic influence hinges on a hierarchical relationship between the borrower and his or her source, always suggesting that the result is an inferior imitation.36 Having "uni versal" ambitions, scholars categorized the arts of Africa and the Middle East?both geographic designations are also the product of Western car tographic taxonomies?as "tribal," "African," "Oriental," and "Saracenic" (later "Islamic"). Theories of cultural diffusionism also assisted in the de velopment of a hierarchy of world cultures, which might "influence" each other, but since Africa usually occupied the lowest ("primitive") rung and the "Orient" a middle position, "outside" influence could only create a derivative copy in these cultures. Stylistic taxonomies became particu 23</page><page sequence="13">larly dominant in the study of African visual culture, where ethnic styles aligned with the colonial map of African "tribes."37 Similarly, the forma tion of Islamic art as a discipline was predicated on ideas that art and ar chitectural typologies embody racial characteristics. Strzygowski, for ex ample, sought to uncover the shared racial roots of German and Iranian culture through an analysis of architectural forms.38 At the same time "modern" also began to be applied to works created by artists living in European imperial m?tropoles during the late nine teenth century. In this context modernist art was scripted as a critique of modern life, through which the modern self seeks an antidote to the man aged routine of industrialization and the commoditization of society by engaging anti-rational and anti-establishment forms of expression. These artists absorbed ideas about cultural difference and became fascinated by the seemingly extreme "otherness" of non-Western cultures. The staging of "exotic" peoples and objects at universal expositions and the public dis play of newly forming "pre-modern" ethnographic collections was an es sential aspect of the colonial project, which artists found particularly titil lating and transformative.39 Part of the critical agenda of the historical avant-garde was to shock bourgeois culture and transgress Victorian pro priety by appropriating non-Western visual culture and performances into "their" Western world. This reframing of African and Middle Eastern images and objects by such artists as Henri Matisse, Hannah Hoch, Paul Klee, and Pablo Picasso as a platform for such a primitivist critique of modern life has been well documented.40 Their cosmopolitan or international positionality was meant to signal a transnational consciousness, where Africa's or the Middle East's cultural difference and exoticness represented a site of coun ter-identification to the nation-state. In particular, scholars in recent years have considered how the very celebration of the imagined alterity of non Western art endorsed or at least colluded with the colonial agenda and why the colonial moment made artistic appropriation possible.41 A more radical position argues that primitivism aestheticized colonial exploita tion, making it also a source of pleasure and fantasy and, hence, construct ed the colonized as a vital source to revitalize the purported sterility of industrialized Western culture.42 For the purposes of this discussion it is important to recall that the production and celebration of primitivist aes 24</page><page sequence="14">Meier thetics by European artists and intellectuals visualized and therefore made tangible emerging concepts about the essential difference between cultures. The appropriation African and Middle Eastern formal elements endorsed and made productive popular tropes regarding the unfettered expressiveness of these cultures. Objects and material fragments collected in the colonies thus were no longer just imperial trophies but also served a social and cultural purpose, as the catalyst for aesthetic contemplation and the renewal of the modern self. Art historians such as Carl Einstein could therefore contemplate African objects as "art," but for this opera tion to be successful such works had to be apprehended as unquestionably counter-modern and anti-Western. Modernist primitivist practices and art history, as projects of modernity, each naturalized the idea that ethnic and cultural identities can be demarcated spatially, as self-contained bounded entities defined by a permanent relationship between the people and their land. As first formulated by the historical avant-garde and imagined by subsequent visual artists with "counter-establishment" agendas, avant gardist subjectivity must radically transgress against these perceived norms. It structures the appropriation of art-making forms as an active articulation of a self-conscious reciprocity and the expression of an origi nal, forward-looking worldview. Artistic modes from the past or "the else where" are apprehended as means deployed by an "autonomous" artist to radically defamiliarize the present and normative notions of a linear pro gression and the purity of artistic style.43 "Art" thus is not an expression of a fixed history or a cultural identity, but of an artist's self-reflexive con templation of form. It is a universalizing exercise. But while artistic originality is allowed to stand as a critique of ethnic ity or nationality for European primitivists such as Picasso or contempo rary postnational conceptual artists, art historical narratives still demand something "different" for non-Western artists of the colonial and independ ence era. Artists from colonized places in fact often resisted reductive inter pretations by claiming an avant-garde sensibility, but their location in or link to colonized space creates discomfort for scholars. This is because the study of artists defined as African or Middle Eastern is imbricated by the disciplinary legacy of "traditional" African and Islamic art history. 25</page><page sequence="15">The Limits of African and Islamic Art Histories In the Africanist scholarship of the 1960s-1980s "modern" was a descrip tor for contemporary production that was no longer strictly indigenous, but somehow at least still comprehensible as authentically African because it incorporated vernacular visual forms or materials. African art history, meaning the arts of sub-Saharan "black" Africa, focuses on creative ex pressions that could be linked to traditional popular culture consumed by non-elite local clienteles.44 Thus even if publications and exhibitions in cluded academically trained artists working with Western pictorial tech niques, their art had to be inflected by a clearly discernible "native" mark, the expression of "roots," since the prevalent paradigms of analysis still posited ethnicity and communal tradition as the definitive characteristic of authentic African cultural production.45 Confusion and anxiety regarding the position of tradition and moder nity as "real" phenomena in Africa and as an organizing principle for scholarly production also characterized much of the 1980s. Just as mod ernization seemed to be erasing Africa's internally coherent cultures?the very object of Africanist art history studies?the notion of tradition was also invalidated as a Western hegemonic discourse.46 Thus, the focus on au thentic modern and contemporary African artists who visualized a clear relationship to "indigenous" forms was meant to rescue "tradition" under the rubric of "continuity and change," allowing the discipline to articulate its continued relevance and reframe its subject of study.47 As noted earlier, the Middle East and Africa became the object of art historical analysis during the age of global expansionist colonialism, when the field began its "scientific" mission of mapping out universalizing tax onomies of world cultures. Both fields needed pure objects undiluted by outside influence that expressed the "essence" of each culture's respective differences. This strategy in turn affirmed the view that clear boundaries are the "natural" state of the world, since these boundaries could be ap prehended as concrete differences through the taxonomy of style. The art of sub-Saharan Africa was defined by the colonial lexicon of ethnic groups, each seen as an autonomous pre-modern universe organ ized around a harmonious relationship between humanity and nature, where "high" civilization had not debased the purity of an unselfcon 26</page><page sequence="16">Meier scious creative expression. Historically, Middle Eastern art has been as signed to the field of Islamic art history, which has the peculiar distinction of being the only major field focused on an entire religion across space and time.48 At its inception the field of Islamic art was understood to be the product of a "higher" world civilization. In this schema its "spirit" was defined by faith, not reason, and therefore it could not belong to a modern world. The pre-colonial past was similarly upheld as the subject of study for African and Islamic art history. This apparatus makes invisible much of the visual culture that cannot be read as an extension of pre-contact authenticity. Ironically, many of the objects celebrated as canonical for Africa were created and used during the late nineteenth or early twentieth centuries, the height of the colonial encounter. In the case of Islamic art history, objects and spaces from the eight eenth century onward do not conform to the stylistic taxonomy created for the "Muslim world" and to this day the discipline does not extend much beyond 1700. Furthermore, while Marshall Hodgson called atten tion to the problem of studying cultural production under the rubric of "Islam" and suggested instead the concept of "Islamicate" in his seminal 1974 The Venture of Islam, art historians rather call for more precise defi nitional markers for Islamic art.49 For example, Oleg Grabar grappled with the vague connotations of "Islam" as it is linked to "art," in The Formation of Islamic Art. He sought to refine the definition of Islamic art, rather than question the applicability of "Islam." Allowing for diversity in identity and religious practice, in his final analysis the existence of "Islamic culture" as a category of analysis was "logical": "Islamic culture automatically compelled the growth of certain physical and aesthetic needs of an art" and therefore a "uniquely Muslim art lay ... in certain identifiable habits and thoughts, which had to be translated into visually perceptible forms."50 In both disciplines objects were framed as representative "types" linked to religious cosmologies or, in the case of Africa, epic oral histories, rather than to the radical socio-political transformations of their particu lar historical context. This art is not only "behind" the temporal progres sion that defines Western art, but exists outside of time. Such positions are still very much evident in exhibition interpretative materials,51 but schol ars in both fields have done much to counter such homogenizing narra tives, instead focusing on issues of contestation and reinvention. For ex 27</page><page sequence="17">ample, Jerrilynn Dodds argued that an "Islamic" style could be understood as a fluid maneuver for political means by religiously diverse actors rather than an expression of a bounded cultural identity.52 Africanists such as Ferdinand De Jong, Sidney Kasfir, Peter Probst, Steven Nelson and Ikem Okoye have foregrounded the interstices between European and African practice in the colonial and postcolonial periods.53 Also, in recent years scholars in both fields have focused on how the legacy of imperialism and nationalist agendas has shaped how they interpret their subject.54 African art historical training emphasizes ethnographic fieldwork, which necessarily focuses on the present and therefore even historical ob jects are apprehended through contemporary experience, often reinforc ing colonial-era discursive paradigms in which African art is always re producing a traditional past and even contemporary works are only apprehended as African if they clearly exhibit a continuity with this past. Islamicists follow an archive-based model, where meaning for the object is produced through the interpretation of contemporaneous texts. While scholarship has moved away from a religious interpretive lens by instead focusing on the socio-political context of empire building,55 it continues to uphold pre-1700 works as the subject of analysis, therefore avoiding the specter of the modern.56 Despite their methodological differences, both fields reproduce discursive models in which authentic African and Middle Eastern culture was only created in the past, before its inward-centered purity began to decay with "outside" conquest. One of the most curious results of their respective disciplinary histo ries is that each continues to ignore the significant overlap in their respec tive fields. The millennia-old practice of Islam by sub-Saharan Africans and their participation in such transcultural networks as the building of Islamic states or the hajj could not be accommodated in a vision of Africans living in halcyon small lineage-centered communities. Although more than half of the continent's citizens self-identify as Muslim, key figures in the field of African art history also positioned Islam as destructive to African figurai sculpture. They understood Islam as a negative "influence" because they conflated Orientalist generalizations about Islamic "icono clasm" with colonial period histories written by British and French schol ars about "Arab" slavers and "jihads" in West Africa.57 Islamicists on the other hand have yet to expand beyond North Africa precisely because 28</page><page sequence="18">Meier African objects categorized as worthy of study mostly date to the nine teenth century onward and do not conform to the Islamicist canon of style.58 Racialist paradigms defining sub-Saharan Africans as Bantu "blacks" and North Africans as "white" Arabs also continue to shape the way subject matter is apprehended in the study of culture.59 The division of the conti nent along these lines in academia continues to endorse ethnic markers as a useful category for the study of culture, even while post-modern positions celebrate identity as a performance in flux and traditions as invented. Such disciplinary divisions are the legacies of the reformulation of art history as a "scientific" discipline during the high age of empire in the nine teenth century. As elaborated on previously, art historical work mapped taxonomies of difference by cataloging the art styles of cultural groups. According to this model, the colonial encounter also inaugurated a cross cultural exchange across these boundaries, which in the case of the "colo nizer" begat originality (in the case of historical avant-garde, for example), while for the "colonized" it signaled a loss of originality and authenticity. Re/locating Modern Art in the National Project In both fields the "modern" is occluded or exists at the periphery since it demarcates the limits of each field's methodological apparatus. The rela tionship between African and Middle Eastern cultural practice and mo dernity cannot be understood within the frameworks of either discipline.60 Therefore, a new generation made the colonial encounter the very topic of study, rather than ignoring its historical impact. These scholars, often trained in Africanist or Islamic art history, place their analytical accent on modernism and a different corpus of objects and material spaces. This new art historical scholarship is therefore necessarily in dialogue with art histor ical studies of modernism. But rather than attempting to simply include the non-Western into the modernist canon, it seeks to disrupt the foundational assumption of modernist art history that Western production is the univer sal norm. Modernist African and Middle Eastern artists are not conceived of as peripheral and derivative practitioners influenced by Western culture, but rather as coeval or divergent to Western modernism. Thus, modernism is not only created in the West, but rather is inflected with an African, Arab, Middle Eastern, or more specifically, a national or regional specificity. 29</page><page sequence="19">The first significant scholarly work that consciously sought to disrupt the marginalization of "other modernism(s)" was written by scholars who were at some point artists or cultural workers associated with one of the African or Middle Eastern modernist movements.61 Their work empha sized the vital prominence of such art centers as Zaria, Nsukka, Dakar, Accra, Baghdad, Beirut, Khartoum, and Cairo for the articulation of a self aware and critical voice for independence and nationhood. It valorized formerly marginalized artists as significant players in a local community shaped by the global experience of modernity. Liliane Karnouk's 1998 book on Egyptian art represents one of the first English-language studies of artists patronized by state art academies during the age of modern em pire. It begins in 1908 with the establishment of the School of Fine Arts in Cairo by Prince Yusuf Kamal, who employed Western artists as teachers and also sent Egyptian artists to Europe. The work chronicles artists in relationship to efforts by nationalists to construct a national identity through modernist painting, sculpture and architecture. Like much of this scholarship, she understands Egyptian modernism as a "fusion be tween artistic tradition and modern expression," without articulating the ideological baggage or conceptual assumptions of endorsing the notion of "tradition" and "modern."62 In the scholarship of the early 1990s, modernist African and Middle artists trained in the Western m?tropole or in colonial fine art schools are invariably framed as struggling to create a "true," "national," and "mod ern" visual lexicon and language that was an expression of autonomous selfhood and communal anti-colonial struggle.63 One of the most impor tant projects in this vein was the 1995 Seven Stories about Modern Art in Africa. Seven Stories presents Zaria artists associated with the Nigerian College of Arts, Sciences and Technology from the 1950s onward as critics of the colonial status quo: "The members of the Zaria Art Society were clearly aware of the continuing elision of the art traditions of their own peoples in the evolution of the new art that was being taught in the acad emy."64 In these triumphal narratives artists succeed in a championing a uniquely Iraqi, Nigerian, Syrian or Sudanese art by appropriating populist "indigenous" idioms in their modernist abstract paintings, prints and sculptures.65 Such a framework reflects the continued impact of national ist scholarship, which often scripted a history of unified revolt and revolu 30</page><page sequence="20">Meier tion for anti-colonial intellectual and political work that in reality did not always share the same goals or interests. The arts of the colonial and im mediate independence period are often still expected to uphold this cele bratory narrative. The work of artists practicing within the period of colo nial modernity must reflect nationalist narratives of anti-colonial struggle and national authenticity. This work certainly is critical and groundbreaking, since the creative output of artists associated with art movements such as ?cole de Dakar, Zaria Art Society, and Cairo's Contemporary Art Group was dismissed as simply a discomfiting legacy of European colonial "influence" in Africa. Also, more recently Harney and others have shown how L?opold Senghor's ?cole de Dakar was a laboratory of complex and conflicting artistic agen das, which not only reimagined Senghor's initial N?gritude philosophies for Senegalese citizens, but influenced the rest of the continent and the African diaspora. Senghor's concept of N?gritude and Africanit?, which was articulated in relationship with its sister project of Arabism, posited a vision of unity for the global black diaspora and also for forming a sense of continental solidarity between black African and Arab-Berber peo ples.66 The artists trained at the various art institutions patronized by Senegal's Ministry of Culture did answer Senghor's call for finding a cul tural "authenticity" that affirms and embraces a sense of identity based on racial self-awareness to counter pejorative colonial definitions of Africanity and Arabness. Scholars now document the socio-political context of de colonization and emphasize the localized logics for the engagement with and reimagining of modernism's cosmopolitan concepts and practices.67 The Canon as Strategy Interestingly, another aspect of the construction of African or Middle Eastern modernism has been the recourse to classical art historical strate gies developed for the study of "artistic genius" and the establishment of a hierarchy of national schools from the Italian Renaissance onward. Although on one hand this work has been critical of the ethnocentric par adigms underwriting art history as discipline, scholars often legitimate movements outside the West as worthy of study by seeking to expand the modernist canon to accommodate non-Western artists. 31</page><page sequence="21">For example, scholars carefully position their work as documenting the "birth" of regional schools and artist collectives in which a particular local subject or formal orientation distinguish their work from other forms of modernism. These artists are defined as "truly" avant-garde and original, their work is celebrated as "surprising," and the artists biography is posi tioned as giving insight into a given artwork s startling originality. A se ries of innovations in form and content spearheaded by the individual vi sions of pioneering artists are documented to prove the validity of "local" manifestations of modernism.68 Harney s analysis also posits Dakar's per formance and multi-media fine arts group, known as Laboratoire Agit Art, as "an important avant-garde group challenging the beliefs of the past and suggesting alternatives for the future."69 Issa Samb of the Laboratoire therefore "create[s] an aesthetic that speaks directly to the experiences of the artists and audience living in Dakar."70 At the same time, another Laboratoire artist, El Sy, described as intense and unpredictable, creates work that is "endowed with a personality of its own."71 Writing a chronology of continuities and discontinuities is a long-es tablished art historical maneuver, which makes the apprehension of a new school or art movement possible. It brings a canonical art history into ex istence. Thus, the originary role of certain artists as the first modern in the national context becomes significant. For example, the project to create an account of modern Nigerian art charts the establishment of various firsts. Whether the Zaria or Nsukka schools are more significant in the original formation of modern Nigerian art or whether Aina Onabolu (1882-1963) and/or Ben Enwonwu (1921-1994) should be credited as the first modern Nigerian artist is debated.72 Scholars such as Okeke-Agulu and Oguibe also emphasize that Western individuals and colonial education programs did ttofintroduce modernism, but rather that indigenous pioneers such as Aina Onabolu and Prince Yusuf Kamal, began a campaign to bring fine art courses to their respective secondary education curricula.73 Onabolu was "not merely mimicking Europe" by painting representational portraits of Nigerian elites in the genre of academic naturalism. Rather, Onabolu "was also beginning to define his idiom as a vehicle for translating and reinstat ing his own heritage into new forms in the context of changing reality of Africa."74 By placing the accent on Onabolu s autonomous subjectivity, the pervasive ideology of Euro-centered diffusionism is thus interrupted 32</page><page sequence="22">Meier through modernist tropes. The frequent focus on origins, originality, and artistic individualism also speaks of an unacknowledged ambivalence in the scholarship regarding the artists' relationship to their African and the Middle Eastern identity. Scholars want these artists to be recognized as not derivative, but also not the "same" as their North Atlantic counter parts, since this would simply fold them into modernity's totalizing no tion of world culture. Transcultural Subjectivity and Authenticity? Accounts of artistic individuality and originality also inadvertently pro duce anxieties regarding the quality o? the work created in "other" spaces, since formally the work could be read as derivative and too similar to the work of their European counterparts. The art historical valuation system that valorizes originality also privileges formal innovation in the visual field. Thus, the influenced artist is reduced to a weaker and imitative posi tion. African and Middle Eastern modernists clearly deployed "European" media, such as easel painting and photography, and artistic techniques including pictorial abstraction and the re-imaging of "vernacular" or "folk" forms. To foreclose and deflect any suggestion of mere imitation, similarities are explained as transcultural affinities in sensibility. Yet, the significance of "vernacular" or "indigenous" forms is assigned a different symbolic weight than for Western primitivist artists. The revitalizing impetus does not come from a spatially distant "oth er," but from inside the self and therefore is an "authentic" source. As Shabout writes, Iraqi artists found approaches that were indigenous to their own cul ture. They were thus able to absorb and understand modernism epis temologically, intuitively, and intellectually, as opposed to borrowing or learning a European style. 5 In her analysis a discourse of indigeneity is posited against any implica tion of imitation. Clearly, much of this scholarship frames the production of modern art as an affirmation of the identitarian politics of liberation movements. Yet the notion that personal and communal identifications are rooted in a single geographical location was an operational mecha nism of imperial governance. It made the colonialist discourse of national 33</page><page sequence="23">citizen and colonized subject differentiation possible. For independence agitators, these external categorizations also became the site from which to launch oppositional strategies. A "native" subject position became an empowering collective identity in the context of anti-colonial struggle from which to articulate a demand for citizenship, since the territory of the colony could be transformed into a nation.76 Cultural workers invested in the liberationist potential of pan-African and pan-Arab ideas posited the pre-colonial past or native populist visuali ses as the most meaningful location from which to launch a national mod ern cultural platform. Afif Bahnassi, an Islamicist art historian at the University of Damascus who endorsed modernist art practice in the Arab world to nurture national unity, was one of the first scholars to articulate the discomfort scholars have had about the relationship between modernist practice and local "authenticity." He warned that " [t ] he only legitimate work of art is that which is intimately linked to the soul of the people."77 The ex istence of the "soul of the people" also necessitated the construction of an autochthonous culture whose unadulterated connection to the native soil naturalizes the nation-state. Thus, Bahnassi praised the projects of Farid Belkahia (b. 1934), an artist who instituted the teaching of "native" handi crafts, such as carpet-making, calligraphy, and leatherworking, at the Casablanca School of Fine Arts "to forge new links with their cultural, hu man, and psychological roots."78 Yet, significantly, a shared territorialized heritage is posited as the source, but not the contemporaneous location for modern artistic practice. The construction of an imagined alterity and dif ference between vernacular artists, who become the passive source, and modern artistic subjectivity allows N?gritude and Arabism to be an active site of a counter-modernity. Arabic and Amharic calligraphic forms and Pharaonic, Sumerian, Assyrian, Kabyle, Yoruba, and Igbo vernacular visual worlds became "traditional" sources to construct a self-reflexive artistic ex pression. These traditions are positioned as the source to rejuvenate the colonized self, alienated from its roots. This strategy necessarily embraces modernity's imagined rupture and discontinuity between a pre-modern and modern subjectivity. By arguing Iraqi artists are anchored somewhere in "their own culture," Shabout also inadvertently naturalizes (as does Enwezor in The Short Century) the Enlightenment idea that a radical break with the past is required to be an active subject in modern time and space. 34</page><page sequence="24">Meier Conclusion While the focus on African and Middle Eastern modernism(s) makes vis ible for often the first time the complex struggles, desires, and achieve ments of artists once evaluated as simply imitative of European modern ism, it often posits retroactive understandings of the independence struggle as the framework for interpreting artistic production created during this period. A concern for a territorially defined identity also per petuates the concept of cultural difference and modernity's invention of tradition as its passive other. Such an analytical apparatus also can allow the artist to slip back into position of the passive producer of tradition, since a place-specific authenticity runs counter to a vanguard position in artistic practice. Clearly, much of this work reflects a disquiet regarding the exact power dynamics and implications of the creative exchange be tween Europe and regions that experienced colonization. The importa tion of modernist artistic modes, media and techniques remains an unre solved issue for this scholarship precisely because modernist concerns over the originality and authenticity underwrite these studies. Within this paradigm an exchange between a place-specific tradition and modernity is also an exchange between the active present and the passive past, where the phantom of an unequal exchange always lurks. A focus on modernism in "other" places has begun to disrupt the foundational assumption of modernist art history that Western production is the universal norm. While critiquing colonialist definitions of authenticity and difference, such work continues to link artistic practice to authenticity and locality to create a positive valuation and to prove the colonized artist survived the onslaught of globalizing forces. Scholars might begin excising the continued anxiety about "authen ticity" by extending the critique begun by Hassan, Shabout, and Balaghi of the "multiple modernities" model. The logic of questioning multiple modernities thinking would also lead one to question what the concept of Iraqi or Senegalese modernism emphasizes and elides. Such work would question the anxieties about particularism and universalism that art his torical inquiry has yet to move beyond, since art history is itself deeply modernist. How can one make incommensurable practices visible, when the very ground of analysis already forecloses certain questions? Such 35</page><page sequence="25">work would explore why the search for an authentic expression that has not been marked by the colonial encounter, loss, and exploitation is in its very articulation the product of the coloniality of power. It would also make a rigorous distinction between the use of such terms as modernism, modernity, and authenticity by artists and the deployment of them as dis cursive frames. New work must continue to contextualize cultural prac tice in more precise localities, but also seek to capture how artistic prac tices are claim-making strategies within a shifting web of new and old forms of territoriality. Modes of questioning can then enter a different ter rain. There, the central agenda would not be to position artists as authen tically local and modernist. This unsatisfying bind is the result of moder nity's desire to flatten a multiplicity of encounters into binaries of local and global and universal and particular. Rather, one could unfurl the complex contradictions and tensions activated once modernity meets dif ferent sites of enunciation. We could begin teasing out why we are en joined to constantly return to place-specific modernisms as discursive and embodied sites. Beyond acknowledging that they have been constructed as spaces under the sign of colonialism and are also real places of experience, what is gained by insisting on "Africa" and the "Middle East" as categories of analysis? Can we exit such geo-political designations and consider networks and fissures beyond the diaspora studies paradigm? One can then begin to consider how different modes of causality and selfhood cohere and diverge. Analysis would move out of triumphal modes of narration and relish frac tious work that "fails" and is not coeval, even when it looks similar or dis comfortingly disparate in normative modes of analysis.79 36</page><page sequence="26">Meier ENDNOTES * Thanks are due to Sarah Rogers and Bibiana Obier for their help in sharpening my prose and argument.

Partha Mitter aptly calls this the "pathology of influence" in his call for a new art history that would decenter the canon of modernist art.

See Hal Foster, "The "Primitive" Unconscious of Modern Art," October 34 (1985), Susan Hiller, The Myth of Primitivism: Perspectives on Art (London;New York: Routledge, 1991), Jill Lloyd, German Expressionism: Primitivism and Modernity (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1991). 42. Frederic Jamesons influential essay, "Modernism and Imperialism" interrogated how modernist aesthetics instrumentalized the imperialist "axis of otherness," and also repressed the new "the relationship between a generalized imperial subject...and its various others and objects" from Western consciousness since modernist literature was seemingly apolitical and concerned with formal issues. Fredric Jameson, "Modernism and Imperialism," in Nationalism, Colonialism, and Literature, ed. Terry Eagleton, Fredric 40</page><page sequence="30">Meier Jameson, and Edward W. Said (Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 1990), 48. 43. This strategy is often labeled "post-modern," even when discussing modernist artists. An extensive discussion of this issue is beyond the scope of this present essay, but at issue is whether avant-garde practice is a modernist or post-modernist strategy. In this context the emphasis is on "modern" as a relationship between signified and signifier, not a temporal marker. 44. See, for example, the position of African "modern" artists as uncontaminated and authentically African: Jean Hubert Martin, Magiciens De La Terre (Paris: Editions du Centre Pompidou, 1989), Susan Mullin Vogel et al., Africa Explores: 20th Century African Art (New York: Munich: Center for African Art; Prestel-Verlag, 1991). 45. But this work also represented an attempt to invigorate the established canon of African art scholarship, which up until this period had focused almost exclusively on the sculptural anthropomorphic arts of West and Central Africa collected during the nineteenth century. In terms of curatorial practice, the focus on "authentic" modern and contemporary African artists was also meant to counter MOM As 1984 Primitivism in Twentieth Century Art, which its curators had envisioned as an affirmation of Africa's passive role as a source of Western modernism. The book and exhibition consigned Africa to a primitive, pre-modern past that needed salvaging. 46. E. J. Hobsbawm and T. O. Ranger, The Invention of Tradition (Cambridge; New York: Cambridge University Press, 1983). 47. Of course this observation represents in part a generalization of a diffuse collection of scholars, who also produced many of the most trenchant critiques of their own discipline. For an extended analysis of the contested relationship between the study of African visual culture and its object, see Kasfir, "African Art and Authenticity: A Text with a Shadow." Christopher Steiner, "The Art of the Trade: On the Creation of Value and Authenticity in the African Art," in The Traffic in Culture: Refiguring Art and Anthropology, ed. George E. Marcus and Fred R. Myers (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1995). 48. Islamic art historians have considered the methodological formation of their field. See S. S. Blair and J. M. Bloom, "The Mirage of Islamic Art: Reflections on the Study of an Unwieldy Field," Art Bulletin 85, no. 1 (2003), Finbarr Barry Flood, "From Prophet to Postmodernism?

Hodgson defined "Islamicate" as a concept that "would refer not directly to the religion, Islam, itself, but to the social and cultural complex historically associated with Islam and the Muslims, both among Muslims themselves and even when found among non-Muslims." Marshall G. S. Hodgson, The Venture of Islam: Conscience and History in a World Civilization, Volume I (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1974), 59. Iftikhar Dadi's work on artists identified as Pakistani has very much foregrounded the notion of "Islamicate" as a more productive site of analysis. 50. Oleg Grabar, The Formation of Islamic Art (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1987), 17. Important works focusing on Africa and the Middle East that have interrogated "Islam" as a category of analysis are Louis Brenner, "Histories of Religion in Africa," Journal of Religion in Africa 30, no. 2 (2000), Edward W. Said, Covering Islam: How the Media and the Experts Determine How We See the Rest of the World (New York: Vintage Books, 1997), Bryan S. Turner, Orientalism, Postmodernism, and Globalism (London;New York: Routledge, 1994). 41</page><page sequence="31">51. African and Islamic curatorial departments have sought to critique the relegation of African and Middle Eastern culture to the past by collecting modern and contempo rary artworks alongside "traditional" works. Yet their interpretive frameworks more often than not emphasize how these works are the continuation of the very "tradition" that their museums' past exhibition and collection logics constructed. 52.

Martha Pollock (Cambridge, MA: The MIT Press, 1997). Yet a recent edited volume on nineteenth-century works actually calls for the reassertion of "the notion of a definable Islamic tradition," thereby strangely reinforcing Orientalist 42</page><page sequence="32">Meier frameworks. From this perspective, the editors of the volume describe the very topic of study as "degenerate."

Karin ?dahl, an Islamic art historian, edited what is thus far the only publication about art created within Muslim societies in sub-Saharan Africa that has included the contributions of Islamicist and Africanist art historians. Yet her explanation for this lacuna is that it is simply an issue of good taste. According to her, Islamic expressive culture in Africa has been ignored because it "lacks a certain quality" and sub-Saharan arts are "simple and mostly second-rate items" compared to the 'Islamic heartland.'" Karin ?dahl, "Islamic Art in Sub-Saharan Africa: Towards a Definition," in Islamic Art and Culture in Sub-Saharan Africa, ed.

In 1967 Senghor gave a speech entitled "The Foundations of Africanite or 'N?gritude' and Arabite " at the University of Cairo. Besides sharing similar political and social agendas with post-independence Arab leaders such as Gamal Abdel Nasser, Senghor wanted to build upon the commonalities between Senegal and the Middle East in the realm of religion and culture since most Senegalese self-identify as Muslim.
