<plain_text><page sequence="1">REVIEWS THE LOGIC AND PSYCHOLOGY OF SCIENCE IN this book1 three distinct themes are developed. The first is the system of concepts that is used in modem science and has largely been inherited from the Ancient Greeks. 'The Ionians', says Hutten, 'speculated about nature and the universe while, at the same time, they invented new concepts and criticized them. Thales, for example, not only claimed that water is the basic element; he must also be credited with inventing the term element, in the sense that he gave an old word a new mean- ing. Or entirely new words were coined like" atom " by Democritus; and he explained what is meant by discussing the phenomena to which it applied. A whole new language was invented during the classical age and subjected to critical discussion.' The second theme is the emotional drive behind the scientific system that the Greeks initiated. Hutten sees this in man's fear of his environment and his urge to come to terms with it. He says on page 56: ' We know that there are waves of anxiety, usually mild ups and downs in the normal individual, that are partly periodic and partly excited by some external danger withwhich the person is confronted. Successful mastery of the situation depends on the ability of the individual to repress his anxiety and to turn the instinctual energy underlying it to some realistic use, instead of being swamped and para- lysed by his fears. Something similar also happens in the life of communi- ties, I think, and it would be indeed strange if it were not so. Thus we may surmise that the external danger which threatened Ionia in the sixth century aroused some of its citizens to an effort of repression and subsequent sublim- ation. This took the form of speculating about reality andoftrying to separate more strictly the world of fantasy from that of fact. The desire for separa- tion (involving the primitive mechanism of splitting) expresses the defence against anxiety; or, to put it in positive terms, this desire drives us to obtain more knowledge of the real world around us.' The third theme is that the pattern of anxiety that provides the motive power for scientific endeavour is set by experiences during the earliest days of the scientist's infancy. Hutten sees scientific achievement as the result of a sublimation of unconscious urges. 'The ambivalent feelings, the moral tensions, which we imbibed at our mother's breast, are thus still alive in the most abstract theories of modern physics.' The three themes are interwoven 1 Ernest Hutten, The Origins of Science. An Inquiry into the Foundations of Western Thought, Allen and Unwin, 1962, pp. 241. 28s. 333</page><page sequence="2">REVIEWS in the book and could not have been developed in isolation from each other. But for the purpose of a review it is necessary to disentangle the strands. Here each theme will be discussed in turn. Hutten says rightly that the Greeks invented new concepts. The process of invention has continued since those days and has gathered momentum in modern times. Not more than a very few of the concepts used in mathe- matics are more than two or three centuries old. The majority of those used in physics are even more recent, such for instance as electric charge, energy, entropy, isotope. It has been estimated that there are more than fifty thou- sand technical terms in electrical engineering alone. Each of these represents a different concept and no more than one hundred of them can have existed when Faraday conducted his famous experiments. A substantial proportion of them are less than ten years old. The importance of concepts in science, as distinct from discoveries, is too often underrated. The popular notion of the scientist as a man who does no more than discover what exists already is very prevalent. A minor conse- quence of this misconception is the complaint that the language of scientists consists of'jargon '. Those who bring this charge must believe that the con- cepts have existed for all time, like the ideas that had a prominent place in Plato's philosophy, and that the scientist gives them new strange names only because he will not take the trouble to find out what their correct names are. But the truth is that a substantial contribution to the progress of science has been made by those to whom we owe our new concepts. Each concept has been carefully isolated from neighbouring ones; the concept of acceleration, for instance, from those of movement and velocity. Each has been given harder, clearer outlines than any concept in humanistic studies could ever achieve. Each has been defined in such a way as to preserve its uniqueness. Each has been assigned its proper place in a logical system of thought. For this reason the task of the compiler of a technical glossary differs basically from that of a lexicographer. The latter takes words as his starting point and seeks to discover the various meanings that usage has assigned to them. The compiler of a technical glossary begins with concepts and devises a system into which to accommodate them. He then makes a choice between avail- able terms, if more than one exists. He rejects, or at least deprecates, syno- nyms. The lexicographer collects and records. The compiler of a technical glossary selects and constructs. A more serious consequence of the same misconception is that the nature of the concepts themselves is wrongly understood. Let the atom of oxygen serve as an example. This is described as consisting of a positively charged nucleus surrounded by eight negatively charged electrons, of which two are in an inner and six in an outer ring. This structure is commonly regarded as a discovery based on experiment. The notion is largely true, but not in the way usually supposed. When oxygen is in a chemical compound, be it simple 02, HO20, or part of a more complex molecule, it does not have the 334</page><page sequence="3">REVIEWS structure described above. Some of the eight electrons are shared with other atoms in the molecule and leave the planetary orbits assigned to them in the familiar model. When oxygen is violently agitated, again, as in a hot gas, some of the electrons are knocked off the atom. If the temperature is very high they all are. The structure as described can and does occur now and then, but only very rarely; and it is soon destroyed. This structure was not discovered by examining oxygen atoms but by thinking about them. For an oxygen atom consisting of a nucleus and eight satellite electrons one must look not at nature but at textbooks on chemistry. Though looking at nature does not reveal the oxygen atom as described in textbooks, it does admittedly reveal the nucleus of the oxygen atom with its eight positive electric charges. But it would not be correct to conclude from this that our knowledge of the existence of atomic nuclei with eight positive charges depends on observation of such nuclei. Observation reveals nuclei with seven charges, with nine, and indeed with any other number from o up to more than Ioo. If in the process of observing atomic nuclei as found in nature, those with eight charges had not been found, the concept of the oxygen atom would have been formed just the same. It did indeed so happen with the concept of the atom of Hafnium. This concept had been formed long before the atom was found. The textbook atom does not serve, and is not intended to serve, as a description of what is to be found in nature. It serves a better purpose, namely to produce tidy, systematic, logical thinking. What can be said about the atom can be said about an unlimited number of other concepts invented and used by physicists. They observe a world in which atomic nuclei may have any number of positive charges and may be surrounded by clouds of electrons in almost any configuration. The configuration does not present a picture of order. If the physicist's task were merely to describe what can be observed, he would present us with a picture of chaos. But his task is to be creative. What he does present us with is a picture of orderly structures, rarely if ever to be observed in nature, but immensely valuable as a basis for the formulation of generalised statements. Plato got a little way towards this insight when he distinguished between his world of ideals and the world of reality. But he made the mistake of thinking that the ideals had been created by nature, whereas the concepts used by physicists have been created by man. Hutten rightly emphasises another contribution made by the ancient Greeks to science. It is the formation of abstractions and generalisations. The inner and outer worlds present us with a mass of data during every moment of our waking lives (and with a further mass while we dream). But what we observe are individual things, what we experience are individual events. Each thing and each event is different from every other one. Yet there are resemblances. While no two wheels are exactly alike, all wheels have something in common. It calls for a creative act to recognise both 335</page><page sequence="4">REVIEWS what is true for every wheel and what aspect of the wheel is relevant to the situation of the moment. This act is called abstraction, and it leads to the formulation of generalisations. Having abstracted the general concept 'wheel' from all observed wheels, one can, for instance, make statements of general validity about revolutions per minute, angular momentum, centri- fugal force, and so on. To invent, isolate, define, and name concepts is only one part of concep- tual thinking. Another is to study the relation between concepts and reality. Scientists would be misled by their own concepts if they did not understand the relation, for instance, between the textbook atom and the atoms found in nature. Similarly they have to understand the relation between ideal electric circuits, in which the ratio of voltage to current is constant and conforms to Ohm's Law, and real circuits for which the ratio is but rarely even approxi- mately constant and hardly ever proportional to the resistance. Those who regard the atom of oxygen as described in textbooks as a discovery and not as an invention, and those who believe that Ohm's Law has been decreed by nature and is obeyed by all circuits, have forgotten, or perhaps never learnt, a lesson that the Greeks taught. It is that one must distinguish between things and concepts of things. Things can be discovered; concepts can only be created. A further part of conceptual thinking requires that concepts be arranged to form a logical and consistent system. In this task the Greeks were supreme. As Hutten says, they invented and codified logic. This calls for a study of the relation between any one concept and others within the same universe of discourse. The degree of generality possessed by each has to be ascertained and defined; a hierarchy has to be established. In such a hierarchy one must distinguish between genus and species, between whole and parts, or adopt some other arbitrary principle of classification. It is because technical glossaries establish a logical structure of thought that they are becoming increasingly recognised as integral to scientific work. Hutten has some penetrating things to say about the processes of abstrac- tion and generalisation. They need to be said in these times, whenthere isso much specialisation that many scientists show too little capacity for wide generalisations. There is an unfortunate tendency to regard any statement that is applicable beyond a narrow field of study as metaphysical and outside the scope of science. This did not hold to the same extent in the seventeenth century. At that time scientists gave much thought to wide generalisations and to clarifying the concepts associated with them. In the sixteenth century the concept of'motion' was, for instance, hazy. Galileo and Newton invented concepts that served to dissipate the haze. Among them were velocity, acceleration, force, inertia, momentum. With these a high degree of abstraction was attained, generalisations were formulated that could be applied to a very wide range of situations. Therewith the science of mech- anics was born. We should expect a similar leap forward if and when the 336</page><page sequence="5">REVIEWS concept of space has been further clarified. Today this concept is still as hazy as the concept 'motion' was before Galileo's time. The concept of reality is more general and more abstract even than the concepts of motion and space. Inevitably it is still hazy. There is need for differentiations within it, such as were made between velocity, acceleration, momentum, etc. To this what Hutten says is relevant: ' The outer world, that is the solid physical reality, as we normally feel it, can be constructed only if we are capable of diferentiating it from the inner world and from the very fluid and powerful fantasies that are alive in our minds. If this is not achieved, we can speak neither of reality nor fantasy.' It is to the failure to make this differentiation that Hutten, righly I think, attributes the barrenness of Eastern philosophy. He says: 'Without differentiatinrtg between the knower and the known the scientific concept of reality could not have been developed.' It is in their appreciation of the reality of the knower and the known that the Greeks excelled. They not only made the differentiation to which Hutten refers, but after separating the two parts they preserved both. Many things can be said about the knower that may not hold for the known. That he knows something, for instance, that he plans for the future, that he has the ability to organise, that he makes mistakes. Such statements are as much based on observation as are statements about the atom of oxygen. But there is a tendency in modern science to deny this. The extraordinary notion that what is subjective is not even real is quite widespread. It needs to be empha- sised more today than ever that one cannot advance science by discarding any observables, be they tangible or intangible. This is why the scientific world would benefit today by an occasional return to the refreshing well of Hellenic thought. Otherwise there is a danger that Western thought will become as barren as Eastern. The book under review is one of the few signs left today that insight about the knower as well as the known has not quite been killed. But having said this, I have to add that Hutten is too much a child of his age to put the differentiation that he advocates into prac- tice. On page 94 he says: ' For the modern scientist teleology has no explan- atory power.' It is certainly the present fashion to say this. But the state- ment is only true for the universe of discourse in which some observables are discarded. The corkscrew is an observable object. Its shape calls for a teleological explanation. Unless one mentions the purpose that it has been designed to serve, one cannot account for the shape of a corkscrew. Later Hutten says: ' Teleological explanations are both anthropomorphic and inherently moral.' The teleological explanation of the shape of a cork- screw is admittedly anthropomorphic; it is hardly moral. Those teleological explanations that biologists cannot avoid (though some of them insist in the face of facts that there are no such things) are neither anthropomorphic nor moral. They are perfectly objective and an understanding of the organic world cannot be achieved without them. 337</page><page sequence="6">REVIEWS About the mind-body problem again, Hutten says: ' There is no problem in the ordinary sense of the word.' Here one can only conclude that, in the contemporary view, it is the duty of a scientist to be an ostrich to well known facts. With better self-knowledge Hutten might have said that he wished there were no problem, or that the problem had not yet been solved, or he believed it to be insoluble, or that he had not succeeded in finding words in which to formulate the problem. But its existence can only be denied by one who lacks the divine curiosity that gave Hellenic thought its fertility. This is not the place to define the problem. Let it suffice to point this out. The very fact that the shape of a corkscrew can only be given a teleological explanation proves that there is a real problem. For anyone who denies the existence of the mind-body problem ipso facto denies the validity of teleo- logical explanation. The ancient Greeks would have seen the point. If the scientific world of the twentieth century has lost something that the ancient Greeks had, it has also gained something that they did not have. Conceptual thinking is but one of the three pillars on which modern science rests. The other two are the application of mathematics and the use of experiment. To the ancient Greeks mathematics was a discipline in its own right and did not serve as a means of advancing other disciplines. To use it, as we do today, as a tool would have been regarded as a desecration. And the notion that experiments lead to knowledge hardly entered the Greek mind. It is at least arguable that, in the days of ancient Greece, experiment and mathematics would have been more of a handicap than an asset. One must gain insight before one begins to collect facts and the path to insight is sign- posted by logic and not by experiment. One must know what to experi- ment on before one devises the experiment. One must also find the right questions before one looks for any answers, and it is answers rather than questions for which the experimenter is looking. Similarly, one must see a problem in its qualitative aspect before one can usefully apply mathematics and acquire quantitative knowledge about it. When the search is for under- standing as distinct from facts, there seems to be no alternative to the use of logic. Today the emphasis has changed greatly, and too far, I think, in favour of experiment and mathematics. As Hutten says on page I Io: 'Most people today, scientists, philosophers, and laymen, distrust any theory that is ex- pressed only in words, and not in terms of mathematics.' The prevailing unbalance could hardly have been expressed more simply. It would be better if scientists, philosophers and laymen were to distrust any theory that is predominantly expressed in terms of mathematics. Anyone who has had to direct research workers finds that mathematics serves frequently as a cloak wherewith to conceal shoddy thinking. It is desirable to withhold acceptance of any theory until as much as possible of the mathematics has been translated into words, until qualitative aspects have been clearly differentiated from 338</page><page sequence="7">REVIEWS quantitative ones, until the physical significance of each mathematical rela- tion has been presented, until every concept used is defined, whether it be represented by an algebraical symbol as well or not, until every statement has been examined for its relevance to the situation, until the logic of grammar has been added to the formalism of mathematics. The Greeks, as the saying goes,' had a word for it '. The modern physicist has only too often no more than a letter, an algebraic symbol, for it. This is not enough. Experiment and mathematics are indispensable aids to conceptual think- ing, but they can never serve as substitutes for it. When they do, one arrives at the situation in which answers are provided to questions that have not been asked. The Greeks may have had the mistake of asking too many questions and finding too few answers; but that was better than avoiding the questions and being happy with the answers. Hutten's failure to appreciate the mind- body problem, coupled with his answer that there is no such thing, is only too typical an example. There was a recrudescence of conceptual thinking during the early part of the present century. It was stimulated in physics by the disquieting con- sequences of relativity and of quantum theory. Freud's discoveries stimu- lated similar thinking in other fields, so that one could call the beginning of our century an age of fermentation. At that time there was intensive and purposeful discussion about the nature of our basic concepts. But the revo- lution that this age promised did not occur. The work of Galileo and Newton produced a basic change in almost every branch of the physical sciences. But most scientific work conducted today would not be any differ- ent if Einstein and Planck had made no contributions to science. In view of their basic nature, one should have expected the consequences of relativity and quantum theory to be more permeating than they are. Perhaps they will become so in the future. The second of Hutten's themes, it will be remembered, is the emotional drive behind scientific work. Hutten discusses this in connection with con- ceptual thinking. One would like to understand why such thinking re- ceived an enormous impetus in the days of ancient Greece and a renewed, if lesser, drive during the seventeenth and early twentieth centuries. Hutten does a service in reminding us that it is not enough merely to know what scientists have done in the past. One should seek to understand their moti- vation. If we cannot follow the working of their minds when they were formulating the problems of their day, we shall mismanage contemporary problems. Hutten is, of course, not alone in drawing attention to the psychology of discovery. A far more acute and penetrating contribution was made by Arthur Koestler in The Sleepwalkers. This was published in 1959, while the book under review was published in 1962. It is disappoint- ing that The Sleepwalkers is not mentioned in Hutten's book. What is, so far as I know, original in the latter is that the emo- tional drive is interpreted in more or less psycho-analytical terms. Such an 339</page><page sequence="8">REVIEWS interpretation is at least potentially valuable. The tenacity with which the scientific world holds to certain beliefs and discards others can rarely be ex- plained on rational grounds. Strong unconscious emotion must play its part. On pag e o103 Hutten refers to attempts by scientists to restore determinism to nature. As he says: ' Whatever the technical, mathematical, or other argu- ments that are put forward, these attempts have so far remained unsuccessful and are likely to remain so.' Hutten attributes these desperate attempts to a need felt by physicists for 'strengthening the tie between crime and punish- ment and for doing reparation when the object becomes more elusive '. He goes on to say: ' It expresses, too, the hope that our knowledge, at least of the basic phenomena, is certain even though the superficial phenomena are less well known.' Later he says: ' Underlying this conception of causality is a view of nature and human nature that is, psychologically speaking, immature.' A few further quotations may serve to illustrate the theme developed by Hutten in some detail. On page 60 he says: ' Unconsciously Thales took the mother's breast or, rather, the milk hidden in it as the primary stuff. The problem of reality is, therefore, the search for a satisfying object.' On page 82 he says: ' The ambivalent feelings, the moral tension, which we imbibed at our mother's breast, are thus still alive in the most abstract theories of modern physics.' On page 133 he says that those who have difficulty in learning higher mathematics 'defend themselves, neurotically, by returning to the original " concrete " meaning of number, that is, the infantile fantasy'. 'Euclid ', he says on page 135, ' was the first to be overcome by the horror of the infinite ', and on page 162 he says: ' the abhorrence we feel to the vicious circle, is thus due to the taboo on incest.' Quotations taken out of their context tend to make a misleading im- pression and so I should hasten to say that the above, and many other passages in which psycho-analytic theories are introduced, are more persuasive in their proper place in the text than they can be in a short quotation. Nevertheless, I doubt whether they would satisfy an expert in psycho-analysis. My own impression is that Hutten's interpretations cover no more than a part of the truth, and perhaps not the most important part. Unconscious motivations are invariably strongly over-determined. Hutten dwells largely on those that have their roots in the oral phase and thereby presents what must appear as a lopsided picture. Apart from this, the connection between an intelligent achievement and its deep seated unconscious motivation cannot be adequately discussed in terms only of what psycho-analysts call the' id '. The ego and the super ego play equally important parts. A neurosis can only be discussed in terms of a conflict between id impulses and the super ego. When a similar conflict leads to an achievement, instead of a neurosis, the process of sublimation is important. Though the word ' sublimation ' is mentioned once or twice in the book, the process of sublimation is not discussed. To understand achievements, one must be able to explain why they become egosyntonic. 34o</page><page sequence="9">REVIEWS Hutten's psycho-analytical interpretations strike the present reviewer as a valiant attempt to do something that ought to be done, but one that falls short of being entirely successful.
