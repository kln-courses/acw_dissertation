<plain_text><page sequence="1">AJS Review 27:2 (2003), 203-226 SPIRITUAL EXERCISES IN RABBINIC CULTURE by Jonathan Schofer Pierre Hadot's formulation of "spiritual exercise" has had a tremendous in- fluence upon the study of philosophy and religion in Late Antiquity and beyond. He argues that the well-known exercises of Ignatius of Loyola are part of an older and broader tradition that has its roots in Greco-Roman and Hellenistic schools of philosophy, and that much of ancient and late ancient philosophical speculation should be analyzed as deeply intertwined with practical goals for self-transforma- tion. His research centers upon the Greek askisis and meleti, which he translates as "spiritual exercise," as well as the Latin exercitium spirituale. However, his study goes beyond occurrences of those particular terms, and he aims to develop a category that can be used in comparative and theoretical reflection.' Hadot is among a number of scholars in recent decades that have drawn attention to the intensive concern with the self and its formation among elites of Roman Late Antiquity. This research has been framed through a number of cate- gories-including the care of the self, sexual renunciation, and the construction of masculinity or manhood-and it has focused upon philosophical schools and ear- ly Christianity but has had little to say about rabbinic Judaism.2 In what ways, then, 1. Hadot's studies of spiritual exercises run through his works, including Plotinus, or the Sim- plicity of Vision. Michael Chase, trans.

(Cambridge, MA: Basil Blackwell, 1995), esp. pp. 81-144; and The Inner Citadel, Michael Chase, trans. (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1998). An important predecessor is Paul Rabbow, Seelenftihrung: Methodik der Exerzitien in der An- tike (Munich: Kbsel-Verlag, 1954). 2. The observation that elites in Late Antiquity were particularly concerned with the self or person goes back at least to Marcel Mauss' essay, "A Category of the Human Mind: The Notion of Per- son; the Notion of Self." For a recent translation by W. D. Halls, and valuable essays critically devel- oping Mauss' observation, see Michael Carrithers et al., eds., The Category of the Person: Anthropology, Philosophy, History (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1985). Michel Foucault has made very strong and controversial statements concerning the "care of the self" in Late Antiquity. For historical purposes, his research is valuable to the extent that, as Arnold Davidson writes, "the man- ner in which Foucault conceptualized issues showed clear resonance with" the work of historians such as Paul Veyne, Pierre Hadot, and Jean-Pierre Vernant. For Davidson's examination of Foucault in rela- tion to these scholars, see "Ethics as Ascetics," in J. Goldstein, ed., Foucault and the Writing ofHisto- ry (Cambridge, MA: Basil Blackwell, 1994), pp. 63-80. Foucault's key writings on the "care of the self' are The Use of Pleasure, Robert Hurley, trans. (New York: Random House, 1985); The Care of the Self Robert Hurley, trans. (New York: Random House, 1986), especially pp. 39-68 on the intensi- fication of these dynamics during Late Antiquity; and Luther Martin et al., eds., Technologies of the Self (Amherst: University of Massachusetts Press, 1990). Paul Veyne uses the category "care of the self" in a section of his history of private life, The Roman Empire, Arthur Goldhammer, trans. (Cam- 203</page><page sequence="2">Jonathan Schofer do similar themes appear in classical rabbinic sources? This paper explores one di- mension of the problem, focusing on "spiritual exercises" in The Fathers and The Fathers According to Rabbi Nathan. THE SOURCES The Fathers is the only compilation of nonlegal material to be canonized in the Mishnah. Over the centuries, this collection of ethical maxims came to be part of Jewish liturgy, and it has since become the most commented upon text in all of rabbinic literature. As many have observed, the large and influential anthology en- titled The Fathers According to Rabbi Nathan is our best source for understanding how these sayings were employed in the context of the classical rabbinic period. This is not to say, though, that R. Nathan presents the "original" meanings of the sayings. As we will see, we often find in R. Nathan explicit adaptation or reinter- pretation of the material it comments upon, especially when it preserves material from before the rabbinic period. Strictly speaking, R. Nathan is a commentary to a version of The Fathers that is shorter and earlier than the one that appears in the Mishnah. The relation between the texts is quite complex, and R. Nathan may have developed in competition with the extant version of The Fathers.3 Despite the attribution to "Rabbi Nathan," The Fathers According to Rabbi Nathan is not a single-authored work but, rather, was compiled by anonymous ed- itors over many centuries and now appears in two major recensions. One, which has come to be treated as an extracanonical tractate to the Babylonian Talmud, is commonly labeled Version A, and another, found only in manuscripts, is known as Version B. My study will focus upon R. Nathan A, but I will strive to address all key sources in The Fathers and the witnesses of R. Nathan.4 The problem of his- bridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1997), pp. 229-232. He places this discussion within a larger section that is provocatively entitled "Tranquilizers" (pp. 207-233). Also on Roman elites, see Maude Gleason, Making Men: Sophists and Self-Presentation in Ancient Rome (Princeton, NJ: Princeton Uni- versity Press, 1995), esp. pp. xi, xxv. On sexual renunciation in early Christianity, see Peter Brown, The Body and Society (New York: Columbia University Press, 1988); note Brown's comment about his debt to Foucault on pp. xvii-xviii; David Brakke, Athanasius andAsceticism (Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins University Press, 1998), who draws upon Foucault in pp. 142-200. On the construction of manhood, see Virginia Burrus, "Begotten, not Made ": Conceiving Manhood in Late Antiquity (Stanford: Stan- ford University Press, 2000), who very explicitly responds to Brown's research; also the article on "Spiritual Direction" in G. W. Bowersock et al., eds., Late Antiquity: A Guide to the Postclassical World (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1999), pp. 704-705 with references. The work of both Foucault and Brown has influenced Daniel Boyarin's studies of rabbinic Judaism, including Carnal Is- rael: Reading Sex in Talmudic Culture (Berkeley, University of California Press, 1993). Martha Nuss- baum's important research addresses similar topics, though she makes strong distinctions between philosophical and nonphilosophical materials that Foucault does not. See The Therapy ofDesire: The- ory and Practice in Hellenistic Ethics (Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1994), esp. pp. 5-6 and 353-354 on Foucault, Hadot, and Davidson. 3. These points have been explored at length in the scholarly literature. See especially Louis Finkelstein, Introduction to the Treatises Abot and Abot of Rabbi Nathan (Hebrew) (New York: Jewish Theological Seminary of America, 1950); Judah Goldin, Studies in Midrash and Related Literature, Barry Eichler and Jeffrey Tigay, eds., (Philadelphia: The Jewish Publication Society, 1988), pp. 3-117. 4. The edition I cite from is Solomon Schechter, Aboth de Rabbi Nathan, Edited from Manu- 204</page><page sequence="3">Spiritual Exercises in Rabbinic Culture torically contextualizing these sources is a thorny one. In brief, they present a dis- cursive world depicting rabbis of Roman Palestine, primarily in the first and sec- ond centuries CE, but they were edited over a period that extended far beyond that time. It is likely that R. Nathan, and probably parts of The Fathers, were still be- ing compiled during the Christianization of the Roman Empire in the fourth cen- tury CE, and they may have undergone changes after the shift to an Islamic context in the seventh century, but we find little explicit representation of those contexts.5 Anthony Saldarini has characterized R. Nathan as presenting a distinctly "scholastic" world-view, and for the material discussed herein, his arguments hold as well for The Fathers. He writes that the text "does not give a complete descrip- tion of the Rabbis nor does it recount how they lived, but rather how they ought to live as members of a school." Key features of this school or disciple circle include a founder who is valued for his teachings and behavior; groups of disciples cen- tered upon fellowship, dining, study, and teaching; and some degree of distance from the rest of society. Saldarini compares this scholastic outlook with that of Greco-Roman philosophical schools, and his work is part of a larger scholarly pic- ture that presents rabbinic sages as playing on the broader discursive field of spir- itual elites in the eastern Roman Empire. Scholastic rabbinism is not an essential and isolated religion, or one pole in a binary opposition of Greek/Jewish thought. The very language of the sources reveals a hybrid elite culture, and prominent scripts with an Introduction, Notes, and Appendices (Hebrew) (Vienna: 1887; reprint, New York: Jew- ish Theological Seminary ofAmerica, 1997). I cite from Schechter's edition by "version, chapter, page." Thus, "A1,2" means version A, chapter 1, page 2 of Schechter's edition. "A6-7, 27-35" means ver- sion A, chapters 6-7, pages 27-35 of Schechter's edition. Readers of the printed edition can look up citations from version A by chapter. Major textual studies include Finkelstein, Introduction and "In- troductory Study to Pirke Abot," Journal of Biblical Literature 57 (1938): 13-50. A recent and crucial study is Menahem Kister, Studies in Abot de-Rabbi Nathan: Text, Redaction, and Interpretation (He- brew) (Jerusalem: Yad Izhak Ben-Tvi, 1998). All translations of Hebrew and Aramaic texts in this ar- ticle are my own. Both versions A and B of R. Nathan appear in reliable English translations: Judah Goldin, The Fathers According to Rabbi Nathan (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1955); Anthony Saldarini, The Fathers According to Rabbi Nathan (Abot de Rabbi Nathan) Version B (Leiden: E. J. Brill, 1975); Eli Coshdan 'Aboth d'Rabbi Nathan. In Abraham Cohen, ed., The Minor Tractates (Lon- don: Soncino Press, 1984); Jacob Neusner, The Fathers Accoralng to Rabbi Nathan: An Analytical Translation and Explanation (Atlanta: Scholars Press, 1986). Very important studies include Judah Goldin, Studies in Midrash, pp. 3-117; Anthony Saldarini, Scholastic Rabbinism: A Literary Study of the Fathers According to Rabbi Nathan (Chico, CA: Scholars Press, 1982); Jacob Neusner, Judaism and Story (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1992). Despite its size and significance, R. Nathan and The Fathers surely do not represent all of rabbinic thought. Their creators were selective and at times contentious. One way that I signal that these sources represent strands and not the totality of rab- binic views is to avoid the use of the definite article before the word "rabbis"; I examine what (certain) rabbis state, but not what (all of) "the rabbis" believed. 5. The Mishnah was completed in the early third century in Roman Palestine, though The Fa- thers was likely reworked and edited over a much longer period. One sign that it is a late addition to the Mishnah is that different manuscripts contain the text in different parts of the canon. On the trac- tate, see M. B. Lerner, "The Tractate Avot," in Shmuel Safrai, ed., The Literature of the Sages (Philadel- phia: Fortress Press, 1987), pp. 263-281. For over a century, scholars have discussed the complex editing of R. Nathan; the most thorough treatment of this point is in Kister, Studies. 205</page><page sequence="4">Jonathan Schofer genres in The Fathers and R. Nathan (maxims, genealogical lists, and narratives) have been centerpoints for comparison with Hellenistic thought.6 The probable late date of the texts' final editing makes these points tenuous, even though some scholars have argued that the cultural dynamics of Hellenism continued into the time of Islamic rule.7 Also, we should not take comparisons be- tween philosophical schools and the rabbis who compiled The Fathers and R. Nathan to imply simple or direct lines of influence; such lines may be quite cir- cuitous (or even run in various directions), and the comparisons ultimately may have value in generating typological rather than historical observations. In either case, it is crucial to note that there are significant differences between rabbis of the 6. Saldarini's arguments for the scholastic nature of R. Nathan run through Scholastic Rabbin- ism, but see especially pp. 79-92 and pp. 135-142; I quote from p. 82; also see Michael Swartz, "Scholasticism and the Study of Judaism," in Jose Ignacio Cabez6n ed., Scholasticism: Cross-Cultur- al and Comparative Perspectives (Albany, NY: State University of New York Press, 1998), pp. 91-114; note that Swartz draws on Saldarini, Scholastic.

Catherine Hezser, in a summary of her analysis of whether the rabbinic movement was institu- tionalized, writes, "Study houses in tannaitic and amoraic Palestine were not rabbinic academies in the sense of schools with a fixed curriculum, appointed officials, and a succession of teachers. They were convenient places where some rabbis and others occasionally went to occupy themselves with Scrip- ture."

Various individual comparisons between rabbinic and philosophical sources appear in Judah Goldin's essays on The Fathers and R. Nathan; see his Studies in Midrash. Henry Fis- chel has argued that the stories of Hillel, including those in R. Nathan, have strong resonance with Greek tales of sagely virtue (chreia). See H. Fishel, "Story and History," in H.

In addition, rabbis were often quite suspicious of Hellenistic culture and Ro- man imperial power. Juxtaposing rabbis with elites of the surrounding culture, then, is best understood not as a matter of arguing for similarities, but of opening up more complex analogical contrasts.8 SPIRITUAL EXERCISES Do The Fathers and R. Nathan prescribe spiritual exercises as part of their scholasticism? This question leads us to examine and clarify further Hadot's cate- gory of "exercise." Hadot employs "spiritual exercise" in both very general and more particular senses. At a general level, Hadot writes that the Stoics and other philosophers would characterize philosophy itself as an exercise, framing it as cen- tral to an "art of living" or as a "therapeutic of the passions" that encompasses all of life and many different activities.9 This spiritual exercise may be seen as simi- lar to physical exercise: Just as, by dint of repeated physical exercises, athletes give new form and strength to their bodies, so the philosopher develops his strength of soul, modifies his in- ner climate, transforms his vision of the world, and finally, his entire being.10 Through contemplating nature, universal reason, or totality, philosophers of vari- ous schools identify with some "other" in order to free themselves from ordinary concerns and desires." Spiritual exercises, then, are central to a vision of self- formation modeled after therapy or medicine: the philosopher heals the soul from false belief as a doctor heals the body from disease.12 Rabbis also set out scholastic activity-particularly Torah study-as an ex- ercise, in the broad sense that the process is not only intellectual but also central to the transformation of a student into a sage.13 The Fathers and R. Nathan differ from Hellenistic sources, though, in the significant respect that the medical or ther- 8.

The topic of medical models and metaphors in self-formation is related to but not the same as the interrelation of ancient medicine and the care of the self. On medical texts as sources for Greek and Roman ethics, see Foucault, Use of Pleasure, pp. 97-139 and Care of the Self, pp. 99-144. 13. Solomon Schechter, who compiled the first critical edition of The Fathers According to Rab- bi Nathan, has made this point in elegant terms: "The occupation with the Torah was, according to the Rabbis, less calculated to produce schoolmen and jurists than saints and devout spirits." See Aspects of Rabbinic Theology: Major Concepts of the Talmud (New York: Schocken Books [1909] 1961), p. 136. For a full study of this topic in R. Nathan, see Jonathan Schofer, The Making of a Sage (Ann Arbor, MI: University Microfims, 2000). 207</page><page sequence="6">Jonathan Schofer apeutic model does not appear. There are no parallels made between physical and spiritual exercise, and these rabbinic texts prescribe no specific practices or med- itations-elaborated in terms of frequency, timing, location, body position, and so on-that one should do as part of one's self-formation.'4 In addition to his general account of philosophy as a way of life, Hadot dis- cusses specific Greco-Roman exercises. For example, drawing upon two lists of Philo of Alexandria, he categorizes Stoic practices as including: First attention, then meditations and "remembrances of good things," then the more intellectual exercises: reading, listening, research, and investigation, and finally the more active exercises: self-mastery, accomplishment of duties, and indifference to indifferent things.'5 Hadot also examines a number of other intellectual pursuits in the Greco-Roman world as being spiritual exercises, including physics, Socratic dialogue, and com- portment towards death.16 The first form of exercise in the list-attention-is most important to con- sider in relation to The Fathers and R. Nathan.'7 Hadot writes that these exercis- es often are indicated by the Greek prosochi, which is a "continuous vigilance and presence of mind, self consciousness which never sleeps, and constant tension of the spirit." He also quotes a passage from Marcus Aurelius' Meditations that cen- ters on attention to the present moment: Everywhere and at all times, it is up to you to rejoice piously at what is oc- curring at the present moment, to conduct yourself with justice towards the 14. Although there are no parallels made between physical exercise and engagement with Torah or the commandments, note that a narrative of Hillel in R. Nathan B cites Gen. 9:6 (which states that God made humans in the divine image) as justification for the claim that going to the Roman baths ful- fills a commandment (B30,66). I discuss this passage as well as other instructions in R. Nathan con- cerning the body in my conference paper and article in progress, "The Body and Self-Cultivation in Abot de Rabbi Natan," Upper Midwest Meeting of the Society for Biblical Literature, Minneapolis, 2002. Regarding medical metaphors, in other sources one well-known teaching punning on Deut. 11:8 states that Torah is a "remedy" (sam) for the yeser, or fundamental inclinations (Siphre Deut. 45 to Deut. 11:18, Louis Finkelstein, ed., Strife on Deuteronomy (New York: The Jewish Theological Semi- nary of America, 1993); also b.

Re- garding instructions for specific practices to be done at specific times, other ethical collections con- tain more of these than do The Fathers and R. Nathan. For example, Derekh Eretz Zuta, and Derekh Eretz Rabbah set out guidelines for daily activities such as eating and excretion. 15.

Ibid., Philosophy as a Way of Life, pp. 87-88 (on physics); pp. 89-93 (on Socratic dia- logue); and pp. 93-101 (on training for death). 17. In addition, whereas R. Nathan does not contain dialogue similar to that of Socrates, the ex- egesis of the epigrams often replicates a dialogue or classroom discussion in its own way. This is par- ticularly clear in passages that comment upon a given epigram with the exegetical opening, "How so? This teaches that.. ." (kesad? melammed she...). Such a format echoes a discussion in which a teach- ing is cited, then someone asks, "How so?" and then an answer is given.

In the words of Plotinus' disciple Por- phyry: 'Let God be present as overseer and guardian of every action, deed, and word!'"'19 In the rest of this essay, I will examine three different rabbinic rhetori- cal forms that are analogous to these exercises of attention: they are similar in pre- scribing modes of comportment and attention that the rabbi is to maintain at all times and throughout all activity, but they are different in both the object of focus and the states of character that they aim to instill. To clarify how I am and am not drawing upon Hadot's scholarship: My min- imal claim, which I most strongly assert, is that Hadot's formulation of spiritual exercises provides a valuable heuristic tool through which we can examine certain teachings in rabbinic literature. I argue that these rabbinic passages not only pre- sent rabbinic beliefs and concepts as part of instruction to guide a rabbi's action, but also that they are exercises of attention in the sense that I have presented. A more maximal set of claims, however, could be developed. The broad yet very im- portant characterization of rabbinic Judaism as "part of the general 'discursive space' of the Hellenistic culture in Late Antiquity"20 opens up the challenge and possibility of specifying the relations within that space. Such a project would in- volve a reexamination of Hadot's descriptive work, detailed research into the dat- ing of individual rabbinic teachings, and close comparative analysis between specific passages in Greco-Roman philosophy and rabbinic sources. I will not take on that task in this work, but I do hope to inspire and establish some groundwork for such inquiry.21 DIRECTING ATTENTION The most widespread of these instructions appears in two forms: one cen- tering on the verb histakkel, indicating observation or attention,22 and the other on 18.

A different but very important approach to similar issues can be seen in the broad study by Michael Satlow, "'And on the Earth You Shall Sleep:' Talmud Torah and Rabbinic Asceticim," Journal of Religion 83/2 (2002), pp. 204-225. He contextualizes rabbinic notions of talmud torah in relation to "the ascetic mentalite of the pan-Mediterranean." Sara McClintock has helped me in refining this set of points. 22. The most common sense of le-histakkel is seeing or observation, but it can have an intel- lectual and perhaps contemplative dimension. Marcus Jastrow translates the term as "to look at, ob- serve, to reflect, to keep in mind." In the passages I focus upon here, it has been rendered as "consider," "mark well," and "meditate upon." I will translate the imperative as "attend to...." See Marcus Jas- trow, A Dictionary of the Targumim, The Talmud Babli and Yerushalmi, and the Midrashic Literature (New York: The Judaica Press, 1992), p. 990; Goldin, Rabbi Nathan, p. 236; Saldarini, Rabbi Nathan B, p. 189; William G.

Consider the teaching of the first-century conservative sage, Aqabya ben Mahalalel, as it is presented by three sources:24 Aqabya [ben] Mahalalel says, Anyone who gives (noten) four things to his heart ('el libbo) will sin no more ... (A19,69).25 Aqabya ben Mahalalel says, Let a person attend to (yistakkel) four things, and he will not come into the hands of transgression ... (B32,69).26 Aqabya ben Mahalalel says, Attend to (histakkel) three things, and you will not come into the hands of transgression ... (Fathers 3:1).27 Both wordings-"attend to" and "give" to one's "heart"-appear in the transmis- sion of this instruction. In all cases, the goal of such attention is to avoid sin or transgression through an intense focus upon "four" or "three" things. Elijah (Philadelphia: The Jewish Publication Society of America, 1981), p. 375; Jeffrey Rubenstein trans- lates "mistakkel" of m. Hag. 2:1 as "contemplate" and "look into," in Talmudic Stories: Narrative Art, Composition, and Culture (Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins University Press, 1999), p. 100. A strange ap- pearance of "meditate" as a translation of mistakkel appears in Israel Abraham's translation of Urbach's discussion of m. Hag. 2:1 in Ephraim Urbach, The Sages: Their Concepts and Beliefs, Israel Abrahams, trans. (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1979), p. 193; 772 n. 37. Urbach's Hebrew text does not convey this sense. He glosses histakkelut in terms of hitbonnenut (observation, consideration, re- flection) and yedi 'ah (knowledge), and then he cites the use of histakkel in Fathers 3:1; see Ephraim Ur- bach, The Sages (Hebrew) (Jerusalem: Magnes Press, 1971), p. 169 and p. 169 nn. 36-37. We have thus come full circle, wherein the scholarship cites for clarification the very texts we are trying to understand. On biblical meanings, see Francis Brown et al., The Brown-Driver-Briggs Hebrew and English Lexicon (Peabody, MA: Hendrikson Publishers, 2000) p. 968 on &amp;.k.l. and Michael Fox, Proverbs 1-9: A New Translation with Introduction and Commentary (New York: Doubleday, 2000), p. 147. In The Fathers and R. Nathan, we find teachings that advocate certain things or images that one should "attend to" (mis- takkel). By contrast, according to Mishnah Hagigah, one should not "attend to" certain forms of theo- logical or metaphysical speculation: "what is above, what is below, what is before, what is after" (m. Hag. 2:1). S. E. Loewenstamm has analyzed this passage and its variants. He suggests that in this passage, be- cause of the use of the verb d.rsh. at the opening, mistakkel refers not just to reflection or attention, but also to reading or expositing out loud. S. E. Loewenstamm, "On an Alleged Gnostic Element in Mishna Hagigah ii, 1" (Hebrew), in Menahem Haran, ed., Yehezkel Kaufmann Jubilee Volume (Jerusalem: Magnes Press, 1960), p. 114 n. 3 and generally pp. 112-122. Urbach rejects this position (Sages, p. 772 n. 37). 23. The phrasing varies, but the key elements are the verb "give" (n.t.n.) and the noun "heart" (leb), including: "give ... to one's heart" (noten 'el libbo), "place ... upon one's heart" (noten 'al lib- bo), and "give one's heart to.. ." (noten libbo le-). The heart is a seat of emotions and impulses, but it also has intellectual dimensions and can be rendered as "heart/mind." 24. For a full discussion of all these variants, and speculations concerning their influences upon each other and from historical context, see Finkelstein, Introduction, pp. 64-70. 25. Goldin translates, "He who takes to heart four things will sin no more .. ." (Rabbi Nathan, 93). 26. Saldarini translates, "Mark well four things and you will not fall into the clutches of sin" (Rabbi Nathan B, p. 189; he lists parallels in p. 189 n. 15). 27.

According to R. Nathan A: Aqabya ben Mahalalel says, Anyone who gives four things to his heart will sin no more: from where he comes, to where he goes, what in the future he will be, and who is his judge. From where he comes-from a place of darkness. To where he goes-to a place of darkness and gloom. What in the future he will be-dust and worm and maggot. Who is his judge-the King of the kings of kings, the Holy One, Blessed be He (A19,69-70; B32,69; Fathers 3:1).28 The "four things" that one must "give" to the heart set out the permanent bound- aries of human existence: origin (from where he comes), end (to where he goes and what in the future he will be), and divine judgment. Then, each of the "things" is atomized and glossed to frame human worldly existence as moving from dark- ness to darkness, ultimately ending in nothing but "dust and worm and maggot."29 By contrast, God is a judge as well as "the King of the kings of kings." The links between divine sovereignty and judgment appear in stark, concise terms. These tropes intensify the contrast between the person and God, setting out 28. This passage has received much scholarly attention. The claim that people go "to a place of darkness and gloom" does not appear in The Fathers; on this point and generally on the textual varia- tions, see Finkelstein, Introduction, pp. 53-55 and pp. 64-67; in English, Saldarini, Rabbi Nathan B, p. 189 n. 15. In addition to the appearances in R. Nathan A, R. Nathan B, and The Fathers, the teach- ing is quoted in Lev. Rab. 18:1 and Eccles. Rab. 12:1. A parallel to the material in A19,69-70 is in Der Er Rab. 3, though the maxim is in the name of Ben Azzai. In Kalla Rab. 6, the material of Der Er Rab. 3 is presented as a "mishnah," to which there is a commentary. 29. On "worm and maggot," see Job 25:6 and Is. 14:11. Aqabya ben Mahalalel's saying likely predates much of the other material in R. Nathan. However, in the broader intertextual contexts of both R. Nathan and The Fathers, the trope of "worms and maggots" carries an extremely strong resonance of mortality, contingency, and the limits of corporeal existence. For example, the image is used as a reason for humility: "Rabbi Levitas of Jamnia says, Be very very humble of spirit, for the end of man is a worm and of humans a maggot" (B34,74; also Fathers 4:4). "Worm and maggot" also has more negative connotations. In one case, "worm and maggot rule over him" describes one of the curses for Adam's transgression (B42,116-117). In another, a narrative about the destruction of Jerusalem, God speaks to Titus after Titus desecrates the Temple sanctuary. God insults Titus by calling him, "Evil one. Stinking secretion. Dust, worm, and maggot" (B7,21). The trope is also used to contrast humans and God in B40, 111. The image of worm and maggot is often coupled with a focus on semen, excrement, and sweat. See, in addition to the insult to Titus, A 19,70; B42,116. On sweat and excrement as dis- tinctive of human embodiedness, see B34,74. Although R. Nathan contains teachings advocating care and honor of the body (such as in B30,66), the image of "worm and maggot" consistently invokes the body in body with a negative evaluation, challenging people to move out of a concern with embodied existence toward a focus on the greatness of God. On similar images in mystical sources, see Michael Swartz, Scholastic Magic: Ritual and Revelation in Early Jewish Mysticism (Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1996), pp. 69, 166-170. 211</page><page sequence="10">Jonathan Schofer a dualism between the embodied human and the all-powerful divine judge.30 Hu- man origin and end are lowly, marked by finitude, boundaries, and contingency, whereas God is infinite, unbounded, and permanent. God is also a king and ajudge, implying that humans are subject to divine rule and judgment. Aqabya ben Maha- lalel's instruction calls for constant attention to these predications, which devalue embodied existence except as oriented to divine judgment. God should be at the center of one's consciousness, with all worldly concerns reduced to darkness and dust. The aim of this exercise is practical-the person "will sin no more.""31 In the commentary of R. Nathan B to Aqabya ben Mahalalel's instruction, as well as in The Fathers, we find a number of teachings attributed to R. Yehudah the Patriarch. One of these employs the same instruction for attention, but with differ- ent theological imagery: Attend to (histakkel be-) three things, and you will not come into the hands of transgression. Know what is above you (le-ma'alah): an eye sees, an ear hears, and all of your deeds are written in a book (B32,70; Fathers 2:1).32 30. Urbach, Sages, pp. 224-225; for a full treatment of tropes for divine justice in R. Nathan, see Schofer, Making of a Sage, pp. 232-308. On anthropomorphic and other dualisms in rabbinic thought, see Nissan Rubin, "The Sages' Conception of Body and Soul," in S. Fishbane and J. Light- stone, eds., Essays in the Social Scientific Study ofJudaism and Jewish Society (Montreal: Concordia University, 1990), pp. 47-103. 31. The commentary in R. Nathan A focuses upon Aqabya ben Mahalalel's characterization of human finitude, and we find various answers to the questions of where one comes from, where one goes, and what one will become. Finkelstein argues that the version of Aqabya ben Mahalalel's max- im in R. Nathan A is the earliest form. He holds that the other versions of the maxim (in B32,69 and Fathers 3:1), as well as the commentaries concerning the "four things," are attempts to ensure that the saying does not conflict with rabbinic views concerning the afterlife (Introduction, pp. 64-67). Saul Lieberman argues that one of these interpretations of the "four things"-that of R. Simeon ben Eleazar-is a response to Gnostic views articulated in the Gospel of Thomas, 55; see Tosefta Ki- fshutah: A Comprehensive Commentary on the Tosefta (Hebrew) (Jerusalem: Jewish Theological Sem- inary, [1955] 1992), pp. 1292-1293 to t. Hag. 2:5, 7; in English, Saul Lieberman, "How Much Greek in Jewish Palestine?," in Alexander Altman, ed., Biblical and Other Studies (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1963), pp. 136-137. Kister disagrees with Lieberman on this point (Studies, 107). In R. Nathan A, after the material concerning the "four things," the commentators develop the theme of finitude through accounts of R. Eliezer ben Hyrcanus upon his deathbed. This scene also teaches that one should attend to God's presence. R. Eliezer's instruction to his students concludes, "At the time when you pray, know before whom you stand to pray, for through this thing you will merit life in the world to come" (A19,70; in the parallel of Der. Er. Rab. 3, the deathbed scene names R. Eleazar ben Azariah, not R. Eliezer ben Hyrcanus). See also the passage in Seder Eliyyahu Zuta that opens, "Upon three things a person must attend (mistakkel / yistakkel) every day" (Sed. El. Zut. 3; Finkelstein, p. 176). Here, the focus of attention is actions of everyday life, such as going to the bathroom, drawing blood, and standing over the dead; Sed. El. Zut. 3; Meir Friedmann, ed., Seder Eliahu Rabba and Seder Eliahu Zuta and Pseudo-Seder Eliahu Zuta (Jerusalem: Wahrmann Books, 1969), p. 176. Braude and Kapstein trans- late, "There are three occasions that a man ought to meditate upon every day" (Tanna Debe Eliyyahu, 375). 32. Saldarini translates R. Nathan B, "Mark well three things and you will not fall into the clutches of sin .. ." (Rabbi Nathan B, p. 191-192). Danby translates The Fathers 2:1, "Consider three things.. ." (Danby, Mishnah, p. 447; Goldin, Rabbi Nathan, p. 233). Finkelstein argues that this epi- gram is a shortened form of the one attributed to Aqabya ben Mehalalel (Introduction, pp. 66-67); Al- beck makes a similar comment; Chanoch Albeck, The Six Orders of the Mishnah, vol. 4 (Jerusalem: Bialik Institute, [1958] 1988), p. 495. 212</page><page sequence="11">Spiritual Exercises in Rabbinic Culture This maxim is striking given that it is attributed to the redactor of the Mishnah. In Mishnah Hagigah we read that there are four things that one should not "attend to" (mistakkel), and that one of them is "what is above" (mah le-macalan) (m. Hag. 2: 1).33 While the passage in Hagigah proscribes certain forms of mystical or philo- sophical speculations, this instruction prescribes attention to anthropomorphic features of God's presence on high: an eye and an ear, as well as a book in which human deeds are written. These concrete images imply God's omnipresent per- ception and recording of all actions, providing the basis for divine judgment.34 At- tention to these features of the divine body reinforces an experience of God's hierarchical observation: one is seen and heard from above by a deity who is not Himself seen. Again, the goal is that one will not transgress.35 Whereas the above passages call for attention to God's presence, two epi- grams employ similar terminology but focus upon the "words of Torah." Both are attributed to sages who flourished in the first century CE, and they may be vari- ants of a common original.36 The shorter passage appears in R. Nathan B: 33. See also Gen. Rab. 1:10 to Gen. 1: 1; J. Theodor and Ch. Albeck, eds., Midrash Bereshit Rab- ba (Jerusalem: Shalem Books, 1996), pp. 8-9 and notes. Urbach points out that in some cases, ma a- lah takes the place of the divine epithet 'elyon ("Most High") (Sages, 79). 34. Other passages describe a "ledger" (A39,116-117) or a hand writing (B44,123; Fathers 3:16). These motifs appear in a number of places in the Bible. On God's eye and ear, see Ps. 34:7, 94:9; Job 34:21; on the book, Mal. 3:16 and Dan. 7:10; also Albeck, Mishnah, vol. 4, p. 357; Saldarini, Rab- bi Nathan B, p. 191 n. 24. 35. Later in the collection of teachings that follow the maxim of Aqabya ben Mahalalel, the ed- itors of R. Nathan B place two other epigrams of R. Yehudah the Patriarch. Neither of these specifies a distinct theological image: king, judge, or employer. Rather, they set out a correspondence between God and humans as willing creatures. Both prescribe intense focus on the divine will (rason) such that all of one's actions are in accord with God. The first maxim counsels orientation toward God's will, "Rabbi Yehudah the Patriarch says, Do His will as your will, so that He will do your will as His will. Cancel your will before His will so that He will cancel the will of others before your will" (B32,70; Fathers 2:4; the text is difficult; I follow the suggestions of Schechter in B32,71 and Saldarini, Rabbi Nathan B, p. 193). Such orientation, though, is not the most radical form of service to God, for it maintains self- centeredness. The sage aligns his will with God's will, but he is still able to act according to his own will. A more stringent demand calls for orientation toward yet separation from the divine will. When one does God's will, recognizing that one does so only because it is God's will and not one's own, then one attains a truly God-centered consciousness. Such a position appears in the next teaching of R. Yehudah the Pa- triarch, which begins, "He would say, If you have done His will as your will, you have not done His will as His will. If you have done His will not as your will, you have done His will as His will ... (B32,71; again following Schechter's text; see B32,70 n.26 and Saldarini, Rabbi Nathan B, p. 193). This state- ment is the strongest prescription in R. Nathan for a God-centered consciousness-the ideal that action should be centered upon God, not upon the desires, emotions, and motivations of the self-centered sub- ject. Fishbane writes that this passage is a strong example of attempts within Judaism "to purify sanc- tioned actions from self-centeredness ... ." See Michael Fishbane, "Action and Non-Action in Jewish Spirituality," Judaism 33/3 (1984): 321. I will examine another example of such "attempts to purify sanc- tioned actions from self-centeredness" at length below, in the maxim of Antigonus of Sokho (A5,25- 26; B10,25-26; Fathers 1:3). For other passages prescribing that one do God's will, see A30,89; A41,133; B48,133. For a contemporary discussion of whether it is a greater virtue to act well easily (as in "Do His will as your will") or through struggle (as in, "If you have done His will not as your will..."), see Rosalind Hursthouse, On Virtue Ethics (New York: Oxford University Press, 1999), pp. 91-107. 36. See the discussion of the names and sources in Finkelstein, Introduction, pp. 53, 67-70, 73, 213</page><page sequence="12">Jonathan Schofer Rabbi Nehunyah ben Ha-Qanah says ... One who gives his heart to (ha-noten libbo le-) words of Torah37 eliminates from it words of foolishness. And one who gives his heart to (ha-noten libbo le-) words of foolishness eliminates from it words of Torah (B32,68). The sage prescribes that one direct the heart to the words of Torah to keep it filled with appropriate discourse. In R. Nathan A, we find a more developed account: Rabbi Hananyah, Deputy of the Priests, says, Anyone who places the words of Torah upon his heart (kol ha-noten dibrey torah 'al libbo) cancels (mebat- telim) from it desires of a sword (hirhurey hereb),38 desires of hunger, desires of foolishness, desires of prostitution, desires of the bad yeser and desires of a bad wife,39 desires of meaningless words (debarim betelim), and desires of the yoke of flesh and blood. For thus it is written in the book of Psalms by David, king of Israel, "The precepts of the Lord are upright, making happy the heart. The commandment of the Lord is pure, enlightening the eyes" (Ps. 19:9) (A20,70).40 This unit develops the instruction through a midrash and a list. Let us start with the midrash. R. Hananyah cites a verse from the Psalms: "The precepts of the Lord are upright, making happy the heart. The commandment of the Lord is pure, en- lightening the eyes" (Ps. 19:9). The psalm itself states that divine precepts affect the heart. In addition, the previous verse mentions the torah ("instruction") of the Lord (Ps. 19:8). The midrashic interpretation draws these images together to as- sert that "the words of Torah" (dibrey torah), if placed upon the heart, will make it "happy" through eliminating its problematic desires. The word I translate as "desires" (hirhurim) is clearly difficult. It can denote desires, thoughts, or anxieties. In this passage, it probably should be translated in a number of ways: desires "for" things (prostitution); desires that emerge "from" 122-124; and Saldarini, Rabbi Nathan B, p. 186 n. 39; p, 187 n. 1. See also Fathers 3:5 and Sed. El. Zut. 16 (Friedmann, appendix, 2). Schechter quotes other parallel sources in Rabbi Nathan, p. 145. 37. Saldarini translates, "He who gives his heart to words of Torah" (Rabbi Nathan B, p. 187). 38. Following the printed edition and most manuscripts; see A20,70 n. 1; Finkelstein, Introduc- tion, pp. 122-124. Schechter follows Ms. E, which reads "many sinful desires" (hirhurim harbeh) (A20,70 n. 1). Goldin does the same (Rabbi Nathan, 94). The phrase hirhurey hereb appears in a par- allel source in Sed. El. Zut. 16 (Friedmann, supplement, 2-3; Friedmann discusses variants in n. 10). Braude and Kapstein translate it as "anxiety about a war's threat to his life" (Tanna Debe Eliyyahu, p. 429). Max Kadushin translates, "thoughts (i.e., fears) of the sword (i.e., government .. .);" Organic Thinking: A Study in Rabbinic Thought (New York: The Jewish Theological Seminary of America, 1938), p. 71. 39. Or, as Finkelstein suggests, "the wife of one's neighbor" ('eshet rea'). The pairing of yeser and a wife also appears in A14,58; see also B29,59 and compare Fathers 2:9. For a talmudic example of this conjunction, see the prayer of Mar son of Ravina in b. Ber. 17a. 40. Mss. N and R attribute this to Rabbi Nehunyah ben Ha-Qanah. A parallel appears in Seder Eliyyahu Zuta. It opens: "Yet another opinion: R. Simeon ben Yohai said, Anyone who gives/places the words of Torah upon his heart (kol ha-noten dibrey torah 'al libbo) eliminates desires of transgression .." (Sed. El. Zut. 16, Friedmann, Supplement, 2). Braude and Kapstein translate, "He who takes words of Torah to heart is relieved of anxiety about his transgression .. ." (Tanna Debe Eliyyahu, p. 429). 214</page><page sequence="13">Spiritual Exercises in Rabbinic Culture things (the bad yeser); anxieties (of a sword?); and states (of foolishness).41 This list of desires is long and implies a particular audience: Some elements are universal aspects of somatic existence (hunger), others are specifically male (such as a bad wife), and one is a problem specifically for rabbinic ideals of intellectual focus (meaningless words). The sage affirms that a man can rid himself of all these dis- tractions through proper attention, saying that the words of Torah actually "cancel" (mebattelim) them. If attributions of rabbinic names have any historical value, then we may infer that this concern with attention was influential among sages in the first century CE-Aqabya ben Mahalalel, Rabbi Hananyah, and Rabbi Nehunyah ben Ha- Qanah. Later, it appears through the voice of R. Yehudah the Patriarch, of the late second century. From the perspective of literary composition and juxtaposition, we can see that the expressions were noted by the compilers of both R. Nathan A and B, who in different ways clustered them together (A19-20,68-71; B32,68-71).42 INTERNAL SPEECH Another set of instructions calls upon people to internalize speech, to "say" particular words to themselves in order to create, at all times, the experience of fac- ing God's ultimate judgment.43 In fact, they are to imagine that they stand before God without any merit. The goal is a state of constant anxiety, in which every mo- ment and every action feel momentous. The stakes are high: eternal blessing or punishment. This material appears as commentary in R. Nathan A to the maxim of Nittai ha-Arbeli, a sage of the second century BCE: Distance yourself from an evil neighbor, do not befriend the wicked, and do not give up ('al titya'esh min) [the idea of] retribution (ha-pur'anut) (A9,38; B16,35; Fathers 1:7). His maxim is difficult and allusive in a number of respects, but I focus upon the third element. What does it mean to "give up" retribution?44 41. Goldin translates "preoccupations" (Rabbi Nathan, 94-95). "Jastrow suggests, 'thought, meditation, heated imagination, impure fancies' " (Dictionary, 366). P. J. Ivanhoe has helped me on this issue. 42. When I presented a version of this paper at the Annual Meeting of the Society for Biblical Literature (Toronto, 2002), one person raised a question concerning the relation between histakkel and noten / leb, suggesting that noten / leb may be an attempt to clarify or rework histakkel. She observed that the passages in The Fathers consistently employ histakkel, whereas those in R. Nathan A use noten / leb. In R. Nathan B we see both formulations. I am not sure that this evidence supports a claim that ei- ther is primary, though the question is certainly important and worthy of further investigation. 43. Such as the experience that R. Yohanan has when he cries upon his deathbed (A25,79). Adolph Biichler points out that in both this deathbed scene and the maxim of Aqabya ben Mahahalel, the focus is upon God's power more than upon "the method of His judgment or punishment;" Studies in Sin andAtonement in the Rabbinic Literature of the First Century (NewYork: Ktav Publishing House, [1927] 1967), p. 46. In the passage to which we now turn, though, this "method" is of central concern. 44. This maxim appears in the name of Nittai ha-Arbeli in A9,38 and Fathers 1:6, and in the name ofYehoshua ben Perahyah in B16,35 (in B, both have the title of Rabbi). On "befriend" (tithab- ber), note that the root of this verb, h.b.r., is used as a technical term for fellowship among the students 215</page><page sequence="14">Jonathan Schofer The commentary in R. Nathan A interprets the "retribution" as divine retri- bution and "do not give up" in a very strong sense. One must not give up the aware- ness of divine retribution at any moment: And do not give up the idea of divine retribution. How is this so? It teaches that a person's heart should be in a state of anxiety (mitpahed) every day. He should say, "Woe am I ('oi ii), perhaps retribution will come upon me today, or perhaps tomorrow." He is found to be in a state of fear every day, as it is said of Job, "I feared something fearful (pahad pahadti) [and it has overtak- en me. What I dreaded has come upon me]" (Job 3:25) (A9,42). The anonymous teaching builds upon a verse from The Book of Job. The doubling of the root p.h.d. ("fear") in Job's statement inspires the midrash that one must be anxious (mitpahed) at all times. Then, the text says that one must memorize and speak a distinct phrase to oneself-"Woe am I ('oi ii), perhaps retribution will come upon me today, or perhaps tomorrow."45 The possibility of God's judgment is to be the center of attention, constantly, "every day." This passage is immediately followed by a second interpretation of the max- im. In order to understand the conceptual and metaphoric underpinnings of this commentary, however, we have to consider two other passages that appear in R. Nathan. Underlying the first is the challenge of theodicy, which in one rabbinic formulation is framed: Why is it that the wicked are at ease while the righteous suf- fer? A common rabbinic response to this problem is that the righteous suffer now but will be rewarded in the world to come, while the wicked ultimately will be pun- ished.46 Here, this point appears through monetary tropes, The wicked are paid (meshallemin lirsha'im) and the righteous are given cred- it (maqqiphin le-saddiqim). The wicked are paid as people who observe the Torah with bad intention and nothing good is ever found with them. The righ- teous are given credit as people who observe the Torah with good intention and nothing bad is ever found in them.47 Each one receives a little, and the rest is set aside for them, multiplying (A39,118; also B44,123).48 of the sages. The line may read, "do not make a haber of the wicked." Modem scholars have translated the third element in a variety of ways. Examples include "And do not lose hope of the final reckoning" (Goldin, Rabbi Nathan, 58), and "And do not shrug off all thought of calamity" (Saldarini, Rabbi Nathan B, 116). Saldarini collects others (Rabbi Nathan B, p. 116 n. 1). I follow Jastrow, Dictionary, p. 560. 45. For other examples of "Woe is me," see A12,48-49; A30,89; A32,93; B24,49-50. 46. Earlier in the same chapter, a short epigram states, "The ease of the wicked-its end is bad" (A39,117), and a passage later in the chapter, in the name of Eliezer bar Tzadoq, expresses the same point using purity motifs (A39,1 19); also see A25,79; B33,73; Fathers 4:15. On the topic of theodicy in rabbinic literature, see Urbach, Sages, 511-523. On the formulation, "the ease of the wicked," note Jer. 12:1-2. 47. Schechter emends the text, "The wicked are paid as people who observed the Torah with good intention and nothing wrong is ever found with them. The righteous are given credit as people who observed the Torah with bad intention and nothing good is ever found in them" (A39,118 n.5). His emendation is probably correct, as the extant text is probably the result of a euphemistic change that softens the argument. The issues of intentionality are complex here-what does it mean, exactly, to ob- serve the Torah with bad intention? 48. The last line of the passage is difficult. See Schechter's comments in A39,118 n.5. Kister 216</page><page sequence="15">Spiritual Exercises in Rabbinic Culture In this case, being "paid" (sh.l.m.) is an immediate event, whereas receiving "cred- it" (n.q.p.) means that payment is deferred to the world to come.49 The wicked re- ceive their payment from God (whatever they have earned through good deeds) immediately and in this world. The righteous may have much larger accounts with God, but rather than receiving the benefits now, they have credit for the world to come. This teaching raises a number of questions. What of the righteous who pros- per? If someone is successful in this world, does it necessarily mean that the per- son will perish in the world to come? Is it possible that right action before God could be rewarded in this world? A passage that opens the next chapter of R. Nathan A partially addresses this problem through a distinction between capital and interest: Four things, if a person does them, he eats their fruits (peyrot) in this world, and the capital (ha-qeren) remains in the world to come. These are: honor of father and mother, deeds of loving-kindness, bringing peace between a person and his fellow, and the study of Torah is as great as all of them (A40, 119; also A40,120).50 The tropes have complex layers of meaning. Not only is human exchange a metaphor for God's payment, but the monetary terms are themselves metaphoric. The word for "capital" (qeren) is most literally a "horn" or a "handle," and the word for "interest" is the plural "fruits" (perot). The underlying image seems to be a plant whose produce can be harvested, but its base remains and will generate more in the future.51 The passage employs these tropes to teach that there are four ways cites this passage as an example of cases in R. Nathan for which he identifies an original reading that is not found among any of the manuscript witnesses (Studies, 42). Parallels include Siphre Deut. 307 (Finkelstein, p. 345); Gen. Rab. 33:1 (Theodore-Albeck, pp. 298-303); Lev. Rab. 27:1. 49. In B44,123, the terms are used differently. Receiving "credit" means that the rewards are loaned in this world, such that all merit is used up before one reaches the world to come. In this schema, the wicked receive credit now, in this world. See also A35,105; B27,54. 50. A parallel appears in the Mishnah, at the opening of the laws concerning the corners of agri- cultural fields to be left for the poor. Here, the play between agricultural produce and the "produce" of one's actions is prominent (m. Pe'ah 1:1). George Foot Moore comments concerning this passage, "It will be noted that all the items of this 'capital in heaven' are things that cannot be defined or measured by law-things that by nature are 'committed to the heart' of the individual;" Judaism in the First Centuries of the Christian Era, Volume Two (Peabody, MA: Hendrickson Publishers, [1927] 1997), p. 92. See also Urbach, Sages, pp. 441-442. A more developed discussion of this topic appears in t. Pe 'a 1:1-4. In b. Shabb. 127a-b, an amoraic tradition expands from this tannaitic material to list six actions with "fruits" in this world and "capital" remaining in the next. This passage appears in the Morning Blessings of the prayerbook; Philip Birnbaum, Daily Prayerbook (New York: Hebrew Publishing Company, 1995), pp. 15-16. An extended talmudic exposition, or sugya, citing and developing this material appears in b. Qidd. 39b-40a; this unit develops addresses many of the same topics as A40,119-120, and includes a parallel to a teaching in A40,120 that states, "Merit (zekhut) has capital and fruits;" also see Sed. El. Rab. 11/12 (Friedmann, 59). For another example of the figurative use of qeren, see m. B. Qam. 9:7. 51. Examples of the figurative use of"fruit" as the results of one's deed or actions appear in Is. 3:10 and Jer. 17:10; note that Is. 3:10 is cited as a prooftext for the epigram "Merit has capital and fruits" (A40,120). 217</page><page sequence="16">Jonathan Schofer of acting for which one is rewarded both in this world and the next. The righteous person can prosper in this world and still gain life in the world to come. To do so, one must live off the "fruits" in this world, and "the capital remains in the world to come." With these issues and terms in mind, let us turn to the second opinion con- cerning "do not give up [the idea of] retribution": Another opinion. Do not give up the idea of divine retribution. How is this so? When a person sees what is at his hand succeed, he should not say, "Because I merited it (zakhiti), The Omnipresent52 has given me food and drink in this world, and the capital (qeren) remains for the world to come." Rather, he should say, "Woe am I ('oi ii). Perhaps there remains to me, before Him, only one merit (zekhut). He has given me food and drink in this world, in order that he make me perish in the world to come!" (A9,42). The passage presumes that, if "a person sees what is at his hand succeed," a ques- tion would arise regarding God's judgment in the world to come: does this success mean that all credit is used up in the present? One answer to this question is, "the capital (qeren) remains for me in the world to come." This response, however, could lead to a complacent sense that one has been good enough, or worse, that success necessarily implies God's favor and fortune. To counter such conclusions, the com- mentary teaches that one must "not give up" attention to God's punishment, espe- cially in times of success. In fact, it is necessary to presume the worst possible case and say internally, "Woe am I." That is, this may be my only merit before God, and I must strive all the harder for righteousness.53 According to these two passages commenting on the instruction, "do not give up the idea of divine retribution," one "should say" specific things to oneself, countering any sense of complacency or self-righteousness. In the first passage, this focus should be maintained "every day." The second concerns moments when "a person sees what is at his hand succeed." The internal voices interpret events in the world through divine accounting. God's judgment and power are to be at the forefront of consciousness, and people should attend to the next world, anxious that they will perish for lack of merit. "BE" A SERVANT BEFORE THE MASTER So far I have addressed instructions for attention to God's power and judg- ment. What of God's reward? If a deity gives payment, then questions arise con- cerning ideal human motivation. Given promises of reward for right character and action, what is the normative status of desire for that reward? What is the role of 52. Hebrew ha-maqom. On this epithet for God, see Urbach, Sages, 66-79. He writes that the term, literally, "place," is "used metonymically and refers to the God who reveals Himself in whatever place He wishes; this epithet thus expresses God's nearness" (p. 72). 53. The righteous person would always assume that he has no merit accumulated, even if in fact he might. He thus maintains something analogous to a "fence" around his actions, insuring that "capi- tal" remains for the world to come. On the trope of the fence, see A 1-2,3-14; B 1-3, 3-14; Fathers 1:1. 218</page><page sequence="17">Spiritual Exercises in Rabbinic Culture self-interest in the spiritual path? Should a person act in order to benefit through God's payment, whether material or spiritual? These questions underlie the maxim attributed to Antigonus of Sokho, who probably lived in the second century BCE. The shortest and likely earliest form of his maxim appears in The Fathers:54 Antigonus of Sokho received from Simon the Righteous. He would say, Do not be like slaves (jabadim) who serve the master for the sake of receiving a food allowance ('al menat leqabbel peras). Rather, be like slaves who serve the master not for the sake of receiving a food allowance, and let the fear of Heaven (mora'shamayim) be upon you (Fathers 1:3). What tropes are operating here? Scholars have debated the translation and imagery. The key term is equivocal: 'abadim may refer to "slaves" or to free "servants." The next question is, what is peras? A common translation is "reward," but Elias Bick- erman has argued that it refers to the "daily food allowance" that masters were ex- pected to give slaves in the Hellenistic world.55 A problem, then, is that we do not know whether Antigonus refers to slaves before a master or free servants before an employer. The complexities multiply when we consider the tremendous diversity in the status and power of slaves in the Hellenistic period and Late Antiquity, and the difficulty involved in reconstructing their everyday life. Generally speaking, though, the figure of a slave before a master would imply a stronger assertion of both divine power and human servitude than would the free servant before an employer.56 The instruction for attention centers on the simple imperative, "Be." Antigo- nus calls upon others to "be" like the slave/servant. He does not specify when and where such imitation is to happen, implying that one should do so at all times. Whether we follow the strong reading of a master/slave, or the softer one of mas- ter/free servant, the passage commands that people not take God's response to be their motivation for action. God has the power to provide for human beings, and perhaps should do so, but the individual must not act in order to attain those ben- efits. Rather, Antigonus instructs, ". .. let the fear of Heaven (mora' shamayim) be upon you." The term mora', from the root yr.'., denotes a divinely oriented fear, awe, or reverence (not a worldly, self-centered fear). "Heaven" (shamayim) is 54. On Antigonus' name and date, see Elias Bickerman, "The Maxim of Antigonus of Socho," Harvard Theological Review, 44 (1951): 153-166. Reprinted in Bickerman, Studies in Jewish and Christian History, Vol. Two, pp. 270-289. 55. A further issue is whether al menat le- should be rendered "for the sake of" or "on the con- dition of." My translation follows Bickerman in depicting "slaves" who receive a "food allowance," but Urbach in the wording "for the sake of." See Bickerman, "Antigonus," pp. 270-289; Urbach, Sages, pp. 402-404, 861 nn.21-23; also Goldin, Rabbi Nathan, 39; Saldarini, Rabbi Nathan B, 85; Biichler, Sin andAtonement, pp. 156-157. 56. Bickerman notes these tensions, writing, "we must remember that ebed means not only slave, but also subject, worshipper" ("Antigonus," p. 279). A recent volume of Semeia, entitled "Slav- ery in Text and Interpretation," is devoted entirely to the topic of slavery in ancient Rome, particularly in relation to early Christianity; Semeia 83/84 (1998). Also on this topic, see J. Albert Harrill, The Man- umission of Slaves in Early Christianity (Tiibingen: J. C. B. Mohr, 1995); David J. Williams, Pauls Metaphors: Their Context and Character (Peabody, MA: Hendrickson Publishers, 1999), pp. 111-140. 219</page><page sequence="18">Jonathan Schofer often an epithet for God. For this Second Temple sage, constant reverence toward and fear of God is the ideal condition for appropriate service. He rejects any form of self-interested action.57 This epigram is particularly valuable for identifying the interests of the ed- itorial stream that developed R. Nathan, for disjunction between the maxim and the commentary reveals their concerns. The commentary differs with Antigonus on two points: the radical rejection of self-interest, and the theological tropes of a master and a slave. The editors both preserve the past material and bring it in line with their outlook, creating a much more moderate and complex set of ideals for motivation. The simplest and most dramatic transformation appears in the initial glosses upon the maxim itself: Antigonus of Sokho received from Simon the Righteous. He would say, Do not be like slaves/servants ('abadim) who serve the master for the sake of re- ceiving a food allowance ('al menat leqabbel peras). Rather, be like slaves/ servants who serve the master not for the sake of receiving a food allowance, and let the fear of Heaven (mora'shamayim) be upon you, so that your pay- ment (sekharkheim) will be doubled in the world to come (A5,25-26; also B10,25-26; emphasis added).58 If we read this passage as a unit, the maxim, with its unusual reference to a peras, is now brought in line with standard rabbinic terminology and tropes, particularly the notion of "pay" (sakhar). As the recipients of this payment, cabadim would be 57. Here we see an example of what Fishbane calls "attempts [within Judaism] to purify sanc- tioned actions from self-centeredness;" "Action and Non-Action," pp. 318-329. Bickerman interprets this passage in terms of theodicy, "you have to serve the Lord, even if he, like a heartless owner, re- fuses yourperas, your daily bread." He also writes that "fear of Heaven," historically understood, means simply "piety" (and only later was interpreted in terms of contrasts between fear and love of God) ("Antigonus," pp. 280-282). I find Bickerman's historical reconstruction persuasive, but, as I am ar- guing herein, I do not believe that the passage is best interpreted in terms of theodicy. For other cases of "fear of Heaven," see A27,84-85; B34,76; Urbach, Sages, pp. 66-79. An even stronger denial of self-interest is present in a variant of the maxim preserved in ancient quotations, a geniza fragment, and B5,25. Antigonus is said to advise: "be like slaves who serve the masterfor the sake of not (al menat she-lo') receiving a reward." (Kister, Studies, p. 127 n.59, 156 n. 195; Bickerman, "Antigonus," p. 270 n.2). In this case, the person acts before God not only without expectation of divine response, but with active rejection of the notion that God rewards right action. Action is purely and intentional- ly intrinsic. Bickerman claims that this reading could not be the original text ("Antigonus," p. 289 n.76), but Kister disagrees concerning R. Nathan based on manuscript evidence (Studies, p. 156 n. 195). While the dominant trend in rabbinic exegesis is to soften the maxim, a number of sources preserve this rad- ical ethical ideal into the middle ages and beyond. See for example Rabbenu Yonah and Midrash She- muel on Fathers 1:3, who weigh the significance of both versions. The strongest statement of the rejection of self-interest in R. Nathan is a maxim of R. Yehudah the Patriarch, preserved in R. Nathan B (B32,71), which I discussed in a footnote above. 58. R. Nathan B has a more expansive addition, which has significant text difficulties (B 10,25- 26; see Schechter's comments in B 10,26 n.2; Saldarini, Rabbi Nathan B, 85; Kister, Studies, 128). These passages are not the only cases in which R. Nathan adds "the world to come" to an epigram found in Fathers. See for example A14,58 in comparison with Fathers 2:9 and Goldin, Studies in Midrash, pp. 68-69; and A27,84 in comparison with Fathers 2:9 and Kister, Studies, 65. 220</page><page sequence="19">Spiritual Exercises in Rabbinic Culture free servants, and the fundamental dichotomy is that of employer/worker rather than master/slave.59 The editorial addition also modifies Antigonus' rejection of self-interest. Now the end of the statement is in tension with the beginning: act without concern for reward, but know that if you do so, you will in fact receive re- ward in the world to come. The new form of the maxim appears to allow for a de- ferred self-interest. One can act for the sake of reward, but only for a reward in the world to come.60 R. Nathan stakes out a middle ground regarding the role of self-interest in ideal motivation. The editors call upon the individual to orient towards God not as a master of slaves but as an employer of servants. They soften Antigonus of Sokho's claim that one should not act for any reward, maintaining that one should not act based on desire for reward in this world, but they imply that it is acceptable to main- tain a limited and deferred self-interest, in which hopes for "pay" are postponed until the next world. In this context, the notion of "the world to come" is not just a theological image concerning existence after death, but a motivational concept that influences desire.61 Let us now focus on the last element in the maxim, which prescribes a par- ticular emotional or affective orientation towards God: ". . . and let the fear of Heaven (mora'shamayim) be upon you." According to Antigonus of Sokho, one should not only avoid self-interest, but also strive to cultivate a constant response to the deity of fear, reverence, or awe. In R. Nathan and rabbinic literature gener- ally, the highest forms of comportment towards God are love ('ahabah) and fear or reverence (usually yir'ah, from the same root as mora': y.r.'.). The two terms are paired in a number of places in both R. Nathan A and B. The most common rab- binic assessment of the two emotions is that love is greater than fear. However, as Louis Finkelstein has observed, several passages in R. Nathan uphold fear over love.62 Antigonus' maxim was probably formulated before this duality developed, and it mentions only fear. 59. Bickerman states, "Antigonus speaks not of reward given to a free man but of food alloca- tion to a slave." Then he adds in a footnote, "Note that in the paraphrase given in Abot R. Nathan free workers are substituted for slaves of Antigonus' maxim and that . .. the term ?okar (wages) is substi- tuted forperas" ("Antigonus," p. 279 and p. 279 n. 38). 60. An additional shift may be imbedded in the difference between action "for the sake of" a response from God (as in the short form of the maxim), and action that occurs "so that" a divine re- sponse will occur. In the first case, one is directly motivated by the payment or food allowance, while in the second, the relation between result and motivation is more ambiguous (this point was suggested by a number of faculty members at Stanford University and at the University of Nebraska at Omaha, January and February, 2000). 61. While the rabbis are not, by any means, proto-Kantians, the distinction between theoretical and practical standpoints is helpful here. From the standpoint of a person describing the world, the con- cept of "the world to come" implies theoretical claims about the nature of time and human life. But from the standpoint of a choosing agent, "the world to come" is a practical concept that shapes desire and motivation. On the language of "standpoints," see Christine M. Korsgaard, "Morality as Freedom," in Yirmiyahu Yovel, ed., Kant's Practical Philosophy Reconsidered (Boston: Kluwar Academic Pub- lishers, 1989), pp. 23-48. 62. The general observations have been made and elaborated upon by a number of scholars, in- cluding Schechter, Aspects, p. 72; Biichler, Sin and Atonement, pp. 119-211; and Urbach, Sages, 221</page><page sequence="20">Jonathan Schofer In R. Nathan A there is no commentary to this last element. For the compil- ers of R. Nathan B, however, the words "fear of Heaven" inspire a discussion con- cerning the two poles of ideal human response to God. For the purposes of reference, I divide the passage into four sections and highlight the varying evalu- ations of love and fear. The third section appears in two significantly different man- uscript recensions, and I present them in parallel: (1) A parable. [To what can this be compared?] To a man who does the will of his master, yet his heart is haughty against the will of his master. [Or to a man who does the will of his father] and his heart is haughty against the will of his father.63 (2) One who acts from love is not like one who acts from awe andfear ('eymah ve-yir'ah). (3a) One who acts from love inherits life in the world to come. (3b) One who acts from love inherits inherits life in this world and does not inherit life in the world to come. One who serves in awe and fear inherits life in this world and does not inherit life in the world to come (Ms. R.) One who serves in awe and fear inherits life in this world and life in the world to come (Ms. H).64 (4) Thus we find regarding the early fathers that they served in awe and fear, and they inherited both life in this world and life in the world to come. OfAbra- ham, what does Scripture say? "For now I know that you are one who fears God" (Gen. 22:12). Of Joseph, what does it say? "I fear God" (Gen. 42:18). What does it say about Jonah? "I fear God" (Jonah 1:9)65 (B 10,26; emphasis added). This passage presents a number of difficulties. First of all, the parable in (1) is not completed, and its relation to the rest of the passage is unclear. Second, our two re- censions of (3) differ on the crucial issue-which is greater, love or awe and fear? One asserts that awe and fear are the greater, for they bring life in this world and the world to come (3b). The other states, in contrast, that serving in love will lead to life in the world to come (3a). What do we make of this difference? Scholars pp. 400-419. Note also Bickerman, "Antigonus," pp. 281-282. In R. Nathan, love and fear are paral- leled in A37,109; A41,133; and B45,124. See also Al,1; A6,27-28; B 10,26; B 11,28; Kister, Studies, pp. 140-142; Finkelstein, Introduction, pp. 29-35. 63. On the term "will" (rason) used for the will of God, see the teachings of R. Yehudah the Pa- triarch in B32,71 and my discussion above in footnote 35; also A30,89; A41,133; B48,133. 64. This text is a seventeenth-century commentary to R. Nathan A by Yom Tov ben Moses Tza- halon, who cites from R. Nathan B (Ms. Halberstam: Oxford Bodleian, Neubauer 2635). Schechter quotes the passage in A5,26 n.10; see also Finkelstein, Introduction, 32-35; Saldarini, Rabbi Nathan B, pp. 87-88 n.13. 65. The quotation in R. Nathan B differs from the Masoretic text, which reads, "I fear the Lord, God of the Heavens" (Jonah 1:9). 222</page><page sequence="21">Spiritual Exercises in Rabbinic Culture have responded to this discrepancy in a number of ways, some saying that the pri- macy of "awe and fear" is late or strange, and some saying that it is early.66 I believe that the wording of (3b), which upholds awe and fear, best fits the literary context. The discussion of the patriarchs and Jonah (4) centers on fear. This is particularly striking given that, often in rabbinic literature, Abraham is the great exemplar of serving God in love; he is upheld over Job, who is said to stand in fear.67 The statement in (2), "One who acts from love is not like one who acts from awe and fear," appears to be setting up the evaluation that fear is greater. One can very well imagine that the parable in (1) would finish by saying that fear is greater, for a haughty servant or son would serve out of fear even if not out of love. Final- ly, since the exegetical context is an epigram that advocates maintaining "fear of Heaven," we have all the more reason to think that the commentators would high- light this emotion.68 Study of manuscript variants is one way to identify tensions that existed over the course of the transmission of the text. The poles of love and awe are given, and their relative value is contested. Textual "corruption" can reveal such contention. It is likely that an early version of the passage upheld "awe and fear" over "love." Yet some transmitter, or school of transmission, disagreed with this position and consciously or unconsciously changed a crucial statement concerning the hierar- chy of affects. What is at stake? The poles of fear and love not only denote the two highest, yet very different, rabbinic modes of orienting towards God and the com- mandments; they also indicate, in different times and contexts, distinct strands of elite Jewish religiosity. Louis Finkelstein connects the primacy of fear in R. Nathan with the school of Shammai, the stringent and conservative pole of Pharisaic legal thought, and fear is also a central term for the early charismatic figures, the hasidim ri'shonim.69 The dominant and more moderate rabbinic position is to uphold love, which also becomes central to erotic dimensions of rabbinic mysticism as well as martyrological ideals.70 66. Schechter comments that the passage is "strange" (B10,16-17 n. 11) as does Biichler (Sin and Atonement, p. 159 n. 2). Finkelstein attributes the emphasis on fear and awe to early Shammaitic editing of the text (Introduction, pp. 32-35). Urbach, who calls the passage a "Baraita," writes, "its strangeness is not sufficient ground for assigning to it a late date" (Sages, p. 403, also pp. 861-862 n. 24). 67. Urbach, Sages, pp. 400-419. 68. Also see Mekh. ofR. Simeon b. Yohai 20:6; Num. Rab. 22. Contrast the commentary in Siphre Deut. to Deut. 6:5, "You shall love the Lord your God ..." (Siphre Deut. 32; Finkelstein, 54). The midrash upon "you shall love" upholds love over fear. 69. For Finkelstein's argument, see Introduction, esp. pp. 18-39; also Saldarini, Rabbi Nathan B, pp. 87-88 and nn. 12-14.

See Michael Fishbane, The Kiss of God (Seattle: University of Washington Press, 1994). 223</page><page sequence="22">Jonathan Schofer According to the maxim of Antigonus of Sokho and its commentary in R. Nathan, what is the role of self-interest in the life of religious elites? On one hand, rabbis have a theology that links service of God and self-interest through promis- es that the righteous will be rewarded. On the other hand, certain sagely figures re- ject this self-interest, the most prominent being Antigonus of Sokho. He calls for a mode of attention structured in terms of similes: "be like" a slave before God as "master" and serve this master in fear and reverence, with no expectation of pay- ment or even basic support for life. The commentators soften the dichotomies im- plicit in the tropes and allow for a deferred self-interest. In addition, in R. Nathan B we see the assertion that one must serve the employer out of both fear and love- one manuscript tradition highlighting fear, another love. We can identify, then, three different modes of comportment before a deity that rewards and punishes: (1) serving God to receive payment (self-interest); (2) serving God to receive payment not in this world but in the next (deferred self-in- terest); and (3) serving God through love and fear. The text does not arrange these types as such, but implicit in the material may be a hierarchy, moving from self- interest to deferred self-interest to consciousness wherein motivation and emotion are centered on the deity and not on reward. CONCLUSION I have examined instructions that direct the aspiring sage to focus attention upon certain images. Through constant or regular exercise, God's presence and Torah are always to be in the consciousness, eliminating certain impulses and giv- ing rise to others. These instructions appear in three variations. The first is most explicitly a form of attention: the call to "attend to" or "place" upon the "heart" particular tropes depicting God and divine involvement in the world. The second is an internal voicing: the prescription to "say" certain statements to oneself, ei- ther all the time or at crucial moments. And the third is a form of simulation: one should "be like" a servant before God as master. Through a variety of tropes, these instructions highlight one's finitude in comparison to God's power, one's indebt- edness and guilt before God's judgment, and one's servitude and dependence in re- lation to God as a master. The ideal result is that a rabbi would not have a self-interested orientation centered on worldly desire and fear, but, rather, a God- centered consciousness characterized by humility, spiritual anxiety, reverence, and love. These instructions, like Greco-Roman exercises of attention, address the general orientation that one maintains during all activity, and they aim to move the person away from a focus on the self and the day-to-day to a focus on an external other. Hadot's theoretical formulation of spiritual exercises, as well as his research on Hellenistic philosophical schools, thus provides a lens through which we can consider the practical significance of certain well-known maxims in The Fathers and their commentaries in R. Nathan. At the same time, a full comparison of rab- binic and philosophical exercises would likely lead to an exploration of difference within this similarity. As with other features of The Fathers and R. Nathan (in- cluding their maxims, genealogical lists, and narratives), rabbinic forms of ex- 224</page><page sequence="23">Spiritual Exercises in Rabbinic Culture pression and underlying concerns have similarities with the writings of philo- sophical schools, yet the content differs dramatically.71 These exercises direct at- tention not to nature, reason, or the immediate moment, but to God or Torah. Their goal is generally not to eliminate passions but (with the possible exception of R. Hananyah's instruction) to cultivate certain emotional responses.72 Such exercises of attention are one element in a broad rabbinic concern with the transformation of motivations and emotions through the instruction and mod- els of the sages, the words of Torah, and the service of God. Elsewhere, I describe this concern as a form of character ethics, which includes accounts of human ori- gin or nature, ideal actions and states, and modes of transformation from the giv- en to the ideal-all occurring in a particular community and addressed to an embodied aspiring rabbi. In this intellectual and practical context, rabbinic exer- cises of attention make up a set of subtle and pervasive techniques, among many, through which an aspiring rabbi may strive to change his selfish and wayward ten- dencies.73 71. What historical claims, if any, can be drawn from these observations? As noted above, the relation between the compilers of The Fathers and R. Nathan and Greco-Roman schools appears not to be one of dependence or influence. Rather, as Peter Schifer writes, the rabbis were "part of the gen- eral 'discursive space' of the Hellenstic culture of Palestine in Late Antiquity." See Schfifer, "Intro- duction," in Schdifer and Hezser, The Talmud Yerushalmi and Graeco-Roman Culture, vol. 1, 14-16 and generally 1-23. Specifically, these sources may give evidence of shared discursive forms but not specific terms or content. Note that most of the instructions for attention that I have examined gener- ated a complex reception by the editorial stream of R. Nathan: the maxim of Antigonus of Sokho for its strong rejection of self-interest; the maxim of Aqabya ben Mehalalel for its conception of finitude; and perhaps also the sayings of Rabbi Nehunyah ben Ha-Qanah and Rabbi Hananyah. Saul Lieberman and Elias Bickerman have examined some of this material as evidence for Hellenistic influence upon the rabbis; see Lieberman, Tosefta Ki-fshutah, pp. 1292-1293 to t. Hag. 2:5, 7; "How Much Greek," pp. 136-137; Kister disagrees (Studies, 107); Bickerman, "The Maxim of Antigonus of Socho." I am not sure what to make of these observations, but they appear to link these "exercises" with doctrines that came to be on the margins of rabbinic thought and culture. 72. Saul Lieberman makes a similar point in comparing the maxim of Aqabya ben Mahalalel with one of Seneca; "How Much Greek," p. 136 n. 13. Urbach comments, in discussing the same max- im, "Concepts derived from foreign sources, and for which there is no Biblical authority, were bound- ed by the belief in reward and punishment and the postulate of free will" (Sages, 224). This contrast also appears in comparing philosophic and rabbinic orientations towards death. Hadot discusses vari- ous forms of "training for death," ranging in time from Socrates to Plotinus, in which one contemplates a universal perspective or totality in order to transcend states of subjectivity or individuality; Philoso- phy as a Way ofLife, pp. 93-101. Contrast the rabbinic deathbed scene of R. Yohanan ben Zakkai found in R. Nathan. The sage is overwhelmed with God's presence as king and as judge, his senses both of the divine and of his subjectivity are greatly intensified, and the result is an intense emotional expres- sion: crying. See A25,79; Schofer, Making of a Sage, pp. 237-240, 325-326; Yonah Frdinkel, Studies in the Spiritual World of the Sages (Hebrew) (Tel Aviv: Hakibbutz Hameuchad Publishing House, 1981), pp. 52-56. Another point of potentially fruitful comparison is that Hadot quotes exercises aiming for "the transformation of the will so that it becomes identified with the divine will" (Philosophy as a Way of Life, p. 136). Compare teachings of R. Yehudah the Patriarch, discussed above in footnotes: "make His will as your will .. ." (B32,70; Fathers 2:4). 73. See Schofer, The Making ofa Sage; a new version of this study as a book is in progress. My account of character ethics builds in part upon the scholarship of Foucault, who treats askisis and, more broadly, "ethical work" as one element in a broader framework of ethics as self-cultivation; see Use of Pleasure, pp. 72-77 and generally pp. 25-28, 63-77. 225</page></plain_text>
