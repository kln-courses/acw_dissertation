<plain_text><page sequence="1">Archaeological Reports 30, 1983-84, 102- I9. Printed in Great Britain ARCHAEOLOGY IN ALBANIA, 1973-83 This is the first report on Albanian archaeology to appear in AR. Its preparation and submission were agreed during a visit which M. F. Smith made to Albania in the summer of 1983 at the invitation of the Centre for Archaeological Research in Tirana and with the support of the British Academy. Professor Smith, who has edited and adapted the report, wishes to thank both these bodies, as well as the author, for their generous co-operation and assistance. INTRODUCTION Like several other sciences, Albanian archaeology emerged and developed after Albania's liberation in I944 and the establishment of socialist government. From the outset it has received strong support and encouragement from the Party of Labour (Communist Party) of Albania under the leadership of Enver Hoxha. At the time of liberation there was no central scientific institution in the country which could organize and guide research in the various fields of archaeology, and there was a lack both of specialists and of the material basis for scientific work. In 1948, under the aegis of the Institute of Sciences, the first archaeological-ethnographic museum was established. This museum, to which the country's first few specialists in archaeology were attached, was charged with the task of the protection, preservation, and study of archaeological monu- ments. In 1955 the archaeological section was included in the Institute of History and Linguistics, and in 1972 in the Institute of History. The organization of Albanian archaeology was greatly strengthened by the establishment of the Centre for Archaeological Research in Tirana in 1976. This institution, which is attached to the Academy of Sciences, is responsible for archaeological research and museums throughout the country. Divided into three scientific sections (prehistory, Illyrian antiquity, mediaeval), it includes the numismatic and anthropological collections and conservation and photographic laboratories and has eight regional centres in Durres, Fier, Saranda, Elbasan, Korqa, Shkodra, Peshkopia, and Kukes. The National Archaeological Museum was separated from the ethnographic museum and transferred to the Centre for Archaeological Research in 1981. The Centre collaborates with the Institute of History, the Institute of Monuments of Culture, and with numerous other bodies throughout the country in carrying out research in the fields of archaeology and ancient history. Within a short time Albanian archaeology has achieved noteworthy results and has thrown new light on a series of important problems concerning the ancient history of our country. In the post-liberation years, archaeological research work has been concentrated mainly in the fields of Illyrian and mediaeval Albanian culture. Linked with these researches are problems of fundamental historical importance such as the ethnogenesis of the Illyrians, the level of their cultural, social and economic development, and their political role in the Balkan Peninsula and the Mediterranean Basin, as well as the problem of Illyrian-Albanian continuity, the autochthony of the mediaeval Albanians, and the formation of the Albanian nation. In the field of prehistory recent excavations have shown that the process of the autochthonous formation of the Illyrian ethnos took place in its historical territories in the Balkans in the Bronze Age, on the basis of a much more ancient sub- stratum. In the field of Illyrian antiquity research has yielded interesting results which testify to a high level of development of Illyrian society and culture, which reached its culmination in the 4th-2nd cent. B.C. when, with the strengthening of slave-owning states, the Illyrians played an important role in the political events of the Adriatic and Mediterranean area. Research in Late Antiquity and the Mediaeval period has proved that the present-day Albanians are descendants of the Illyrians. Our excavations in the Greek colonies of the Adriatic coast, Dyrrhachium and Apollonia, which were integral parts of the Illyrian world in which they grew and became powerful, have been systematically continued. This work has made an interesting contribution to knowledge of the special conditions of their development on the Illyrian coast and has brought to light the ever more appreciable presence of the Illyrian element in their social and political life and in their culture and economy. Several national conferences have been organized, devoted to fundamental problems of the ancient history of Albania. The first conference concerned with the Illyrians and the origin of the Albanians was held in Tirana in I969. Three years later, at the First Congress of Illyrian Studies in Tirana, the funda- mental problems of Illyriology and of the early Albanians- problems of great importance in the ancient history of the Balkans-were subjected to a more thorough interdisciplin- ary examination. The congress outlined some fundamental directions for the further development of archaeological research, to assist the analysis and synthesis of the problem of the Illyrians and of the origin of the Albanians. In 1982 another national conference was devoted to the formation of the Albanian people, their language and culture. Consideration was given, on the basis of historical, linguistic, and archaeo- logical evidence, to the questions of Illyrian-Albanian con- tinuity, the autochthony of the Albanians, and the formation of the Albanian nation, with its own language, culture and territory, in the Middle Ages. At the same time the con- ference set the task for future study in this field. Reports on the work done by Albanian archaeologists over many years have been presented in articles, monographs, and contributions to national and international symposia and conferences. On the basis of these works, as well as studies of a purely historical character, the section dealing with ancient history in Historia e Shqiperise (History of Albania) (Tirana I959; new edition in the press) was compiled. The main organ of Albanian archaeology is Iliria. This journal first appeared in 1971 and until 1980 was an annual publication, with contributions in Albanian and summaries in French. French editions of vols II-V were also published. Since 1981 Iliria has been published biannually. In 1982 it was honoured by the Academie Internationale de Lutece (France) with the award of a gold medal. Other publications relevant to Albanian archaeology include Iliret dhe Iliria te autoret antike (Illyrians and Illyria in Ancient Authors) (1965), Probleme te numismatikes ilire (1967; French trans. Questions de numisma- tique illyrienne, 1972), Iliret dhe gjeneza e shqiptareve (I969; French trans. Les illyriens et la genese des albanais, I972), two books of photographs (mostly in colour) entitled Shqiperia arkeologjike (I97I) and Monumente te arkitektures ne Shqiperi (I973), five issues of Buletin Arkeologjik, and Cambridge Ancient</page><page sequence="2">ARCHAEOLOGY IN ALBANIA, 1973-83 103 i.

Articles of an archaeo- logical character have appeared also in the journals Buletin per Shkencat shoqerore, Buletin i Universitetit Shteteror te Tiranes, Studime historike, Studia Albanica, and Monumentet. In addition to the National Archaeological Museum, which contains the largest collection of archaeological finds, there are archaeological museums at Durres, Apollonia, and Butrint, while the National Historical Museum in Tirana and many historical museums in district centres have archaeological sections. During the past ten years, archaeological research in Albania has been carried out in three main directions. (a) In prehistory research has been extended to new regions and zones for the study of the origin and evolution of prehistoric cultures and to clarify the problem of the ethnogenesis of the Illyrians. (b) In the field ofIllyrian antiquity, excavations have been undertaken in furtherance of study of the Illyrian town. Particular attention has been given to pre-urban settlements, with the aim of following and clarifying the origin and character of Illyrian and Epirot towns as centres of production in the slave-owning era, their lay-out and architecture, and features of their civic culture, as well as throwing light on problems of the material background against which the political history of southern Illyria and Epirus developed. (c) Research in the field of Late Antiquity and the Middle Ages has aimed at further tracing the origin and development of the mediaeval town and at studying the Early Mediaeval Albanian culture and the ethnogenesis of the Albanians. The discoveries at Dyrrhachium and Apollonia, the large ancient cities on the Illyrian coast, have also been interesting. New information has been gained about their planning, building, and development. Moreover, archaeological dis- coveries show that, before the coming of the Greek colonists, the hills on which Apollonia and Dyrrhachium were built were inhabited by native populations. In addition to systematic excavations, a series of exploratory expeditions have been organized in various districts of the country. These have yielded much new information and have greatly enriched the archaeological maps of Albania. In the following survey we present the centres in which excavations have been conducted during the years 1973-83, district by district (Fig. I) and in chronological order. SHKODRA DISTRICT Shtoj (Excavations by A. Koka, 1980, 1983). The excavations were centred on the tumulus cemetery on the plain of Shtoj, where four tumuli built of stone and earth and several built with rings of stone were opened. The graves in the tumuli belong to the end of the BA and to the IA, down to the 4th cent. B.C. The finds in the earliest grave were few, consisting of pottery vessels with one or two handles, decorated with oblique lines, curved iron knives and a bronze sword of well- known Aegean types. The graves of the 6th-5th cent. B.C. yielded richer finds, consisting mainly of pottery vessels of local production with two handles rising above the brim (Fig. 2: scale I: 2), decorated with incised and impressed lines and geometric motifs such as hatched triangles and groups of steep zig-zag lines, but including also some imported Archaic Greek pottery (cups and wine vessels). Many ornaments of a wide range of types, including clasps, buckles, pins, rings, and necklaces, mainly of bronze, were found in the graves. The decoration of the pottery links this culture to the tumulus culture of Mat, but at the same time it has some local peculiari- ties manifested in original motifs such as those in the form of Fig. 2 the letter X, the groups of steep zig-zag lines, and flame-shaped lines, which are not found in the Mat culture, as well as some features which represent new variants of the Mat prototype. Dedaj (Excavations by B. Jubani, 1983). Continuing the investigation of the tumulus culture of the Shkodra district, excavations were begun in the necropolis of Shkrel in the village of Dedaj, where there are more than 40 tumuli. Three EBA tumuli were excavated, built mainly of stone and with one central grave. The bodies had been buried after cremation outside the tomb. Some hundreds of fragments of vessels were found in each grave, linked to the Kotor-Cetina culture of Yugoslavia. Shkodra (Excavations by S. Anamali and H. Spahiu, 1978-79). Exploratory excavations were carried out in a small area of the lower part of the city, NE of the famous castle, at the edge of the River Drini. These revealed the ruins of a big building erected in the 4th cent. B.C. on a terrace reinforced by a strong retaining wall. The carefully constructed walls, a large polychrome mosaic floor (8.4 X 6.7 m.) decorated with geometric and floral motifs, and a number of architectural details depicting reliefs of garlands and other floral motifs indicate a building of importance. Finds included ceramic products (amphorae, pots, lamps, etc.) and agricultural tools, testifying to the continuity of life in the Middle Ages in the small region of Shkodra, the main centre of the province of Praevalitana in Late Antiquity. PUKA DISTRICT Koman (Excavations by H. Spahiu, 1982-83). Excavations continue in the cemetery near the fortress of Dalmace close to the village of Koman-one of the largest Early Mediaeval cemeteries in Albania, of notable importance for the study of the origin of the Albanians (Iliria ix-x [1979-80] 23-46). 71 graves, all of the 6th-7th cent. A.D., have been opened to date. A great wealth of material has been found, mostly bronze and silver ornaments. They are outstanding for their number and varied forms, including clasps, earrings of various types (Fig. 3.1, 2), small smooth bands with spiral hangings, coiled bronze neckbands, necklaces with multi-coloured beads, bracelets, rings, and necklets (Fig. 3.4). The most typical object is the fibula (Fig. 3.5). In some graves iron tools and weapons</page><page sequence="4">ARCHAEOLOGY IN ALBANIA, 1973-83 I05 t 2 4 3 0 CM ( Ar x were found, including axes, adzes, and spear and arrow-heads. Of special importance is the discovery of three rings with the inscription KEB-OHOH-ANN (Fig. 3.3), a Christian formula in Greek of the Early Byzantine period, found with fibulae, earrings, and knives dating from the 6th-7th cent. A.D. KUKES DISTRICT Kolsh (Excavations by M. Korkuti, I975-76). During two years of excavations in the Neolithic settlement of Kolsh near the town of Kukes, two cultural layers were distinguished. In the first, which belongs to the Early Neolithic, the finds consisted of red monochrome pottery, barbotine ware, 'impresso' pottery, and pottery decorated with dark colours on a red background (Fig. 4. 1-6)-an element which links this stratum chronologically to the Rudnik culture in Kosova, to the Starcevo II phase, and to the Vrsnik II phase of the Macedonian Neolithic culture. The second layer belongs to the Middle Neolithic. Some forms of vessels and decorations as well as the burial rites show similarity to the Cakran culture. The incised decoration of bands filled with dots and lines, some encrusted with white paint, indicate links with the Vinca group. (Iliria vii-viii [1977-78] 239-48). q(inamak (Excavations by B. Jubani I973-75). In continua- tion of the excavations begun in 1969 at the tumulus cemetery of Cinamak, four tumuli were opened, bringing the total excavated to 28. The tumuli were built of clay and stone covered and encircled with rings of stones. The graves date from the ioth cent. B.C. to the 1st cent. A.D., but most are of the 6th-Sth cent. B.C. Most of the artifacts found in graves of this period are pottery of typical Illyrian forms, as well as vessels of Greek form but local workmanship such as cups, skyphoi and table amphorae. The metal objects include spear-heads, double-headed axes, cleavers and knives, all of iron, as well as ornaments of bronze, iron and silver. The culture revealed by the tumuli of Cinamak is related to the Mat-Glasinac cultural 5 o 5CM I x - Fig. 4 group and, more closely, to the Dardanian-Illyrian culture of Kosova. Bardhoc (Excavations by A. Hoti, I974). Near the village of Bardhoc two tumuli were excavated, containing 34 graves from the LBA and the 6th-5th cent. B.C. (Iliria xii. I [1982] I5-48.) Keneta (Excavations by A. Hoti, 1977). Four tumuli were excavated near the village of Keneta in 1968. During the 1977 campaign, the last two tumuli (5 and 6) were excavated. Of the 36 graves found, two belong to the LBA, while the remainder date from the 6th-5th cent. B.C. The finds consist of earthen- ware vessels of various types and objects of bronze and iron. (Iliria xi. I [19811 2II-I7). The treasure of Borja. Near the village of Borja a hoard of Byzantine coins of the I2th cent. A.D. was discovered in 1978. LEZHA DISTRICT Lezha (Excavations by F. Prendi, 1973, 1977, 1980-83). Excavations were carried out in the mediaeval castle and in the lower part of the ancient city of Lissus at the edge of the Drini. The following cultural strata were identified in the castle: (I) Graeco-Roman; (2) Late Antiquity; (3) IIth-I3th cent. A.D.; (4) I4th-I6th cent. A.D. mixed with later elements from the time of the Turkish occupation. In the ancient city at the edge of the Drini the circuit-walls, a major highway flanked 5 Fig. 3</page><page sequence="5">io6 Z. ANDREA with footpaths and paved with stone, and three gates, of which the main one is on the S side, were exposed. The main gate is of considerable dimensions (entry is through a corridor 17 m. long and 6 m. wide) and is heavily fortified with four square towers-two at the outer corers and two at the inner-and a double system of gates within the corridor. The largest gate yet known in an Illyrian city, it dates from the late 4th or early 3rd cent. B.C. In the Ist cent B.C. it was repaired and paved with flag-stones. The mediaeval city-gate, built above the ancient gate in about the Ioth cent. A.D., was also exposed. The treasure of Torovica. In I983 a hoard of 123 bronze axes was discovered near the village of Torovica, near Lezha. Of these, 3 I belong to the type known as Albanian-Dalmatian, 91 are small hatchets, while one is a typical Italian axe, with an oval hole for the handle and a straight edge. The hoard dates from the Ioth cent. B.C. Apart from the one of Italian type, the axes are all of uniform weight, according to their type, and since they are incomplete or have casting defects and show no sign of use, and have no functional details which could class them as weapons or tools, it is assumed that they served as a means of exchange before the introduction of coinage. MATI DISTRICT Blaz (Excavations by F. Prendi, 1978-80). In the cave dwelling of Blaz, between the villages of Lac and Bru9, several cultural strata were identified. The earliest is linked to the pre- Neolithic. The second stratum with considerable quantities of 'impresso' pottery of the Adriatic type belongs to the early Neolithic period (Fig. 5. 3, 4). The third stratum, characterized by pottery with incised geometrical and spiral motifs, belongs to the Middle Neolithic (Fig. 5. I, 2), while the latest consists of small deposits from the MBA. (Iliria xi. 2 [1981] I5-40). The excavations of I980 revealed a narrow Eneolithic stratum, in which a chisel and an axe of bronze, as well as fluted black pottery, were found. 2 3 O 5 CM Fig. 5 Nezir (Excavations by Zh. Andrea, 1979-81). Of interest for the more complete tracing of the prehistoric cultures of the Mati district are the excavations in the Nezir cave, close to that of Blaz. In the cultural strata 4 m. deep,-in which more than 20 layers of settlement have been identified, four periods Middle Bronze Age Early Branz,49e - Illllllllllllj/I /li llllll llllllllllllll lllllllll [///1111jjjl,,j 1// I,////''"/ ' ':/ '77 7 7^/7/2'7 K \ \\ \\\\\\\/Rat\\\\ \ \\ // /S/ \. . / / 1, ^\\\\\^&gt;^^^\\X ^ &lt; U / / , ~~~~~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~~~~\ N\\~\\\~ II ~~~&gt;,, I, I ~ ~ :;,,,,, ~~~~~~~~~I I I "l &gt; 2 · \ /~~~~ tin''' '('7\\····· &lt;'&lt; \\\ m 7 w\~~~,;;"` 7?\\\w\\·" Middle N/eoh/ih,e // /^ v////:// 'v 'i'iiN,~5 ',5 \ \\ \\ \~ '2\\\\~:\&lt;\&lt;&lt;\&lt;&lt;&lt;^&lt;^^^^\~ ^"=\\\\\\` //// /// / /,,\////// \\\,, o 100 CM Fig. 6 were distinguished-Middle Neolithic, Eneolithic, EBA, and MBA (Fig. 6). The Neolithic yielded little material. In the Eneolithic strata black monochrome pottery with a smooth surface, glazed and decorated mainly with fluting and more rarely with grey designs, was discovered. Characteristic of the EBA is the ribbon pottery and 'pseudo-barbotine' ware, more primitive than that of the Eneolithic and co-existing with elements inherited from it. The pottery of the MBA, which was more carefully worked, is simple in decoration but more varied in its forms: the most distinctive are vessels with handles rising above the brim in the shape of elbows or axe-blades. Burrel (Excavations by D. Kurti, I975, 1978, 1980). The largest number of tumuli in Albania is in the Mati valley-an area of special value in the study of Illyrian culture. The most recent excavations have been centred on the tombs of Burrel. In all I I tumuli were opened. They were built of earth, some on a bed of gravel or cobblestones and covered with stones. The graves are simple trenches or are encircled and covered with stones. The tumuli contain graves of various periods from the MBA and LBA, to which two swords with horn-covered handles and a number of knives with curved blades of well- known Aegean types belong (Fig. 7), down to the 4th-2nd cent. B.C. The greatest number of graves belongs to the 6th- 5th cent. B.C. They contained a wealth of objects, including tools and weapons of iron, double-bladed axes, cruciform short swords, cleavers, knives with curved blades, swords of the Glasinac type, and very long spears. Especially numerous and , /// /// ~.\\Nx\,x, . //</page><page sequence="6">ARCHAEOLOGY IN ALBANIA, 1973-83 107 varied were the oraments-fibulae, trinkets, pendants, buckles, buttons, necklaces, bracelets, and beads of bronze, glass, and amber. Also found in the graves were pottery vessels of local production, including pitchers with short necks and two handles, decorated with incised motifs and flutings. Found with them was imported pottery of the Archaic period. The culture of the Burrel tombs is closely related to that of the tombs excavated previously in the Mati region and to the Illyrian culture of Glasinac and Bosnia. DIBRA DISTRICT Burim (Excavations by Zh. Andrea, 1978). Close to the village of Burim, near Maqellara (Peshkopia), a Neolithic site was excavated. One stratum with two settlement horizons was revealed. In the older horizon a damaged fireplace with smooth surfaces, as well as a clay floor with traces of beams on the lower part of it, were found in situ. Most of the few tools found are stone axes, adzes, and chisels of Early Neolithic types. Pottery is more plentiful, but in general the vessels are of simple spherical, hemispherical, and (more rarely) biconical types. The main categories of pottery are barbotine, 'impresso', and red monochrome. By these features the culture of Burim, which represents the earliest Neolithic culture in Albania, is chronologically and culturally related to the Starcevo I group. (Iliria xi. i [1981] I5-40.) Cetush (Excavations by M. Korkuti, 1980). In the pre- historic settlement of Cetush two cultural layers were identi- fied. The earlier, in which 'impresso' and, less commonly, barbotine and red monochrome pottery similar to that of Burim was discovered, belongs to the beginning of the Early Neolithic. The second layer yielded a wealth of pottery of varied forms, mostly pots with handles in the shape of axe- blades or elbows. The ornamentation is simple, consisting of bands in relief with or without pitting, conical knobs, etc. The forms and decoration link the pottery of this layer to the EBA pottery of Maliq IIIc. Gradec (Excavations by M. Korkuti, 1980). At the pre- historic settlement of Gradec a narrow Eneolithic cultural stratum was discovered. KRUJA DISTRICT Zgerdhesh (Excavations by S. Islami, I973). The excavations in this Illyrian city, SW of Kruja, were a continuation of those carried out in 1969 (Iliria ii [1972] 217-37 [French ed.].) It was confirmed that the earliest stratum was associated with a pre-urban settlement encircled by walls of unmortared stones, and more information was gathered about the second stratum of the ancient Illyrian period, with a wealth of material from the 3rd-2nd cent. B.C. It was proved that in the 2nd cent. B.C. the city was reduced to a rural centre. 220 coins, mainly of Dyrrhachium, Apollonia, Lissus, Issa, and Corcyra Nigra were found; few were Roman. Kruja Fortress (Excavations by D. Komata, 1979-81). The excavations yielded information about the origin and develop- ment of the life of the fortress. (Iliria xii. I [1982] 221-32). DURRES DISTRICT Durres. Recent excavations have greatly increased our knowledge of the city of Durres (Epidamnus, Dyrrhachium), .0 3 C£M 1 .0 *3 CM Fig. 7 2</page><page sequence="7">Io8 Z. ANDREA which has been inhabited for over 2,500 years and was the largest ancient port on the E coast of the Adriatic. An impor- tant area of investigation is the extensive necropolis on the hill (excavations by H. Hidri, 1973, 1977, 1980-81). In all, I35 graves from the 7th cent. B.C. to the 2nd A.D. were discovered. The burial methods are (a) cremation and the use of urns (pithoi, dinoi, craters, amphorae, and earthenware vessels), (b) placing the corpses in trenches and in graves built of tiles. The finds in the graves are generally of local produc- tion, while imported articles are rare. The graves with urns are the earliest, from the 7th-6th cent. B.C., the vessels being Corinthian or Ionian in style. The trench-graves date from the 5th-4th cent. B.C., while those built of tiles are of the 3rd-2nd cent. B.C. In these graves pottery with red designs and black- glazed pottery of local production predominate. A number of metal objects, including bracelets, rings, and earrings, mainly of bronze, were found too. Of special interest and value for Illyrian onomastics is the discovery on the acropolis of some tombstones with Illyrian names such as AAZIMOC, OACIOY, NECIMOC, which have augmented the list of Illyrian personal names discovered in Albania and, at the same time, confirm the presence of Illyrians in Dyrrhachium. (Iliria xiii. i [1983] I37-80). Arapaj (Excavations by S. Hidri, 1974, 1980-83). A Palaeo- Christian basilica with three naves, transept, narthex, and atrium was discovered in the village of Arapaj, SE of Durres (Fig. 8), the largest such basilica discovered in Albania. The excavations of I983 showed it to be 60 m. X 28 m. It under- went reconstruction and was in use until the I5th cent. It is probably to be identified with the church of St Michael mentioned by Anna Komnena. The discoveries include much Byzantine pottery of the 6th-I4th cent., coins and fragments of architectural decora- tions and building materials, which indicate an important religious monument. Also, a notable polychrome mosaic 9 X 6 m. was discovered in an annexe of the basilica: it belongs to the second half of the 6th cent. A.D., and consists of two emblems. In the first is the scene of the eucharist, with two deer on either side of a cantharus, while the second shows a pastoral scene. (Iliria xiii. I [I983] 233-39). ELBASAN DISTRICT Pazhok (Excavations by N. Bodinaku, I973). In continuation of the excavations undertaken in I960 of the well-known tumulus necropolis of Pazhok (Studia Albanica i [i964] 91-137), four tumuli were opened. They contained 93 graves of the I3th-8th cent. B.C. (Iliria xii. i [1982] 49-IOI.) Belsh. (a) The settlement (Excavations by N. Ceka, I973-74). The latest excavations in the Illyrian settlement of Belsh, continuing the campaign of 1969, enabled several cultural strata to be identified. The earliest belongs to the LBA. The richest stratum is that of the EIA. Here for the first time pottery with the Devollian style of painted decoration appears and, together with local pottery, imported geometric pottery of late Corinthian type was discovered. In the stratum of the 7th-5th cent. B.C., when the settlement became a proto-urban centre, much Greek pottery was found along with local pottery of a simple or decorated type sometimes produced on a wheel. Predominant among the Greek pottery are hydriae, craters, cups of the Ionian BI-II types, and, later, Laconian craters and cups, Attic cups of minor craftsmen and Late Corinthian kotylai (Fig. 9. I [Cbrinthian], 9. 2-5 [Ionian]). In the 4th-Ist cent. B.C. the settlement developed into a fortified township in which urban production predominated. Local pottery produced by hand and on a wheel and imported pottery, mainly of Apollonia and Dyrrhachium, were dis- covered. The life of the township continued, and during the 4th-6th cent. A.D. it was fortified. (b) The necropolis (Excavations by N. Ceka and L. Papajani, I973-74). 24 graves of the 4th-Ist cent. B.C. and 4th-6th cent. A.D. were opened. The objects found, mostly produced locally or in Dyrrhachium, contribute to our knowledge of Illyrian urban culture. (Iliria vi [1976] 334-6). On the W side of the township a rich grave was accidentally discovered: it contained about 70 objects, mainly weapons, bronze and pottery vessels, and silver ornaments. The bulk of the objects are of pottery, most commonly scyphi of Italian type, produced in Dyrrhachium. The finds included a bronze helmet of the familiar Illyrian type and, interestingly, bronze greaves-the first encountered in an Illyrian town. The objects Fig. 8</page><page sequence="8">ARCHAEOLOGY IN ALBANIA, I973-83 Io9 7 10 // t4 0 SCM -+ s s { 12 Fig. 9 in the grave are to be dated 400-350 B.C. and belonged to a member of the Illyrian military class. (Iliria vi [I976] 36I-3.) LUSHNJA DISTRICT Germenj (Excavations by Zh. Andrea, 1978). Excavations were undertaken in a non-tumulus cemetery on the hills of Divjaka, near the village of the same name. Although only a small part of the cemetery was excavated, 37 graves were discovered-six of the LBA, four of the EIA, 25 of the 4th-Ist cent. B.C. and early centuries A.D., and two Mediaeval. The LBA graves contained local hand-made pottery and two bronze daggers of Mycenaean type. Damaged graves also yielded two bronze swords-one with a horn grip and the other with a cruciform grip of the Sandars Di type. (Iliria xi. I [I98I] 219-26). FIER DISTRICT Patos (Excavations by M. Korkuti, 1976). A tumulus built solely of earth was excavated. It was found to contain 78 graves of the I3th-8th cent. B.C. (Iliria xi. i [I98I] 7-55.) Byllis (Excavations by N. Ceka, I978-8I). The excavations in this Illyrian city completely exposed the theatre with seating for 5,500 spectators (Fig. o1). It is situated near the agora, separated by a wall from the residential area. Two stages of its construction were identified. The first belongs to the 3rd cent. B.C., and the second to the 3rd cent. A.D. when the stage and the orchestra were constructed. Excavations were also carried out in the stadium: its connection with the main street was established, and four rows of seats were discovered in situ. In their lay-out the theatre and stadium resemble those of the temenos of Dodona. Excavations in another part of the city revealed a residence with a peristyle courtyard built in the 3rd cent. B.C. and used, after reconstruction, until the 3rd cent. A.D. One of the rooms had a polychrome mosaic floor. Also excavated were the circuit-walls built in the 4th cent. B.C. with six gates and eight towers, on which restoration work has been done. A 5th-cent. A.D. Christian basilica was excavated (by S. Muca, 1979-80) in the agora area. The nave and narthex have mosaic floors with bird and animal designs (Fig. II). At the altar, divided off with vertical slabs decorated with reliefs presenting maritime motifs, the eucharist and deer drinking water are portrayed. Klos (Excavations by L. Papajani, I973-75). Excavations in the Illyrian hill-top town near the village of Klos in Mallakastra have revealed the remains of houses, a water cistern, and a major public building with two rooms. In the N part, the theatre which could accommodate I,000 spectators was completely exposed. In the eastern parodos were 14 inscriptions with decrees about the granting of citizenship and the freeing of slaves. Cleaning and restoration work was done on the circuit-wall and the wall defending the theatre hill. During the excavation the earliest stratum, dating from the 7th-6th cent. B.C., was identified, while it was established that urban life developed and flourished in the 5th-2nd cent. B.C. A large number of tile-stamps with the names of employees and owners belong to workshops of the city. (Iliria iii [1975] 456-71 [French ed.]; iv [I976] 4II-22 [French ed.]; vi [1976] 346-8]. Marqelli (Excavations by N. Ceka, 1982). The excavations in this Illyrian settlement made it possible to identify the early phase of its existence in the LBA on the basis of a circuit-wall and the pottery. The proto-urban stratum proved that the process of urbanization began in the second half of the 7th cent. B.C. This stratum is rich in local pottery, especially of the Late Devollian style, and in orientalizing Greek pottery, Chiot amphorae, hydriae, Samian craters, etc. In the 4th-2nd cent. 4 Fig. Io</page><page sequence="9">I Io Z. ANDREA Fig. I I B.C. the settlement developed into a small urban centre (Fig. I2). To this period belong several complexes of houses laid out on a rectangular system. Interesting finds from this period include much pottery and a collection of iron tools. The town ceased to exist in the middle of the 2nd cent. B.C. Mashkjeza (Excavations by N. Ceka, I983). In the fortified township of Mashkjeza, near the village of Cakran, excavations were undertaken on the circuit-walls of the proto-urban phase, where two periods of construction during the 6th-5th cent. Fig. 12 B.C. were distinguished. With their geometrical lay-out, the rectangular form of the stones, and their horizontal placing, these walls represent a new phase in the development of Illyrian fortifications. The pottery from the early proto-urban phase (c. 600-550 B.C.) consisted of local products as well as Ionian (mainly hydriae) and Corinthian (kotylai, BI amphorae, earthenware pots) imports. After the middle of the 6th cent. imported Attic pottery, along with local pottery, pre- dominated over Ionian and Corinthian (Fig. 9. 6-8 [local], 9. 9-14 [Corinthian]). In the 4th cent. B.C. the township became an outer suburb of the Illyrian town of Gurezeza which was established alongside it. After a long break the site was refortified in the Ioth cent. Apollonia. The excavations at Apollonia, the most important of the 30 Apollonias in the ancient world, have brought to light a series of valuable monuments and objects which confirm the reputation which the city enjoyed as a great cultural centre. Recent work has concentrated on the theatre, the circuit-walls, and the necropolis. (Iliria iii [I975] I63-263, 433-9 [French ed.]; vii-viii [I977-78] 59-70, 275-81; xii. I [19821 191-205.) (a) The theatre (Excavations by A. Mano, 1973, 1976, 1978-9, 1981). In the great theatre, which has been severely damaged over the centuries, the stage, the proscenium, the three entrances and most of the orchestra have been revealed. The theatre was built in the 3rd cent. B.C. In the Ist-2nd cent. A.D. alterations were made to the stage and orchestra, while further reconstruction was carried out in the 4th-6th cent. A.D. (b) The circuit-wall (Excavations by N. Ceka, V. Bereti, V. Dimo, 1981, 1983). It was proved that the circuit-wall to the NW was built in the 3rd cent. B.C. The first great gate to the city was exposed and at the same time on this side two periods of construction were identified. The construction was in brick on a plinth of ashlar blocks with a facing. In the first period the wall was isodomic, whereas in the second period it was pseudo- isodomic with rectangular towers at the corners and beside the entrance. On the E side of the city, structures of the same type surviving from an earlier circuit-wall built in the 4th cent. B.C. were excavated. (c) The necropolis (Excavations by V. Dimo, 1980, I983). In the tumular part of the E necropolis a tumulus was partly excavated. 67 graves of various types-pithoi, sarcophagi, stone urns, graves with adobe brick or Greek tiles, trenches, etc.-from the 6th-4th/3rd cent. B.C. were discovered. Of special interest is grave no. 56, which belongs to a warrior. His equipment includes a bronze helmet of Illyrian type, an Illyrian shield of a type rare in Albania, a sword, a cleaver, a number of iron knives, a bronze ornament, two wine cups, and two bg bowls. The finds from the graves also include a number of Attic bf vases, as well as Italian rf vases with scenes from Amazon battles and theatrical performances. Ballsh (Excavations by S. Anamali, 1975-76, 1978, I983). In this mediaeval centre known from the Byzantine chronicles the ruins of a Christian basilica were discovered (Fig. 13). The basilica originally had three naves divided by granite columns and pilasters, a narthex at the W end, an open exonarthex fronted with an arcade, and a baptistry to the N. The opus mixtumn technique of construction, the archaeological finds, the decorative and architectural sculpture, and a number of inscriptions indicate that the basilica was originally built in the 6th cent. A.D. in the time of Justinian I. Although of modest dimensions (29 X 13 m.), it had a monumental</page><page sequence="10">ARCHAEOLOGY IN ALBANIA, 1973-83 III Fig. 13 appearance, especially inside where it was decorated with a wealth of architectural forms (marble columns, cornices, capitals, etc.) and some of its marble was Proconnesian (Fig. I4). When reconstructed in the Ioth-IIth cent., it re- tained its original lay-out and monumental appearance and was decorated with frescoes. Materials plundered from the ruined Illyrian city of Byllis were used in this reconstruction. They include several blocks bearing inscriptions which tell of the reconstruction of the defensive walls of Byllis by a Byzantine official called Victor, architect to Justinian I. In excavations near the basilica a mediaeval bath-house, part of a circuit-wall, archaeological materials, and coins were discovered, con- firming that Ballsh, which inherited the name of Illyrian Byllis which it succeeded, developed as an important centre in the Middle Ages. (Iliria vi [1976] 359-61; vii-viii [1977-8] 301-6; xi.2 [I98I] 237-42.) Fig. 14 Numismatic discoveries. The following hoards of coins have been accidentally discovered in the Fier district. (a) In 1975 a hoard was found in the territory of Apollonia of 1,874 Roman silver coins of the Republican period and a single half-drachma of Dyrrhachium. This is one of the largest hoards of Roman Republican coins found outside Italy. The earliest coins were minted in the first quarter of the 2nd cent. B.C., while the last minting belongs to the year A.D. 45. (Iliria xi.2 [198I] I05-52.) (b) At Gurezeza a hoard was discovered of 200 bronze coins of Apollonia, Oricum, Dyrrhachium, and Epirus, of the late 3rd cent. B.C. The most common devices are an obelisk symbolizing Apollo, a horn of Dionysus, and a tripod of Artemis. (c) At Kreshpan, near the village of Cakran, a hoard of 200 coins from c. 280 B.C. was discovered. 40 of these are coins of the Illyrian king Monunius, of the type with a cow and a calf and rectangular in shape, while the others are of Dyrrhachium, Corcyra, and Apollonia. (d) A hoard of Roman Republican coins was found near the village of Fusha. BERAT DISTRICT Dimale (Excavations by B. Dautaj, I973-74). This Illyrian city is identified with the ancient ruins in the fortress of Krotina. Excavations were concentrated on the acropolis hill. The stratigraphy of this part of the site was studied: the earliest, proto-urban stratum was dated 6th-5th cent. B.C., while the most flourishing period was from the end of the 4th cent. to the 2nd cent. B.C. when the settlement developed into a city. Structures of this period include various buildings, a retaining wall (Fig. 15, left), and a street. In the ist cent. A.D. Dimale Fig. 15 became a small strategic centre. Interesting discoveries include tiles stamped with the names of the owners of local workshops, e.g. EIIKAAO and NEZETQP, as well as with the words Al MAAAAA, Al MAAAITAN and monograms which testify to the existence of state workshops too. These and moulds for the production of terracottas, pottery and metal wasters, and accumulations of iron slag and clay testify that Dimale was an important centre of handicrafts. Another interesting discovery is of the bust of a woman wearing items of Illyrian dress such as the kenMishe (shirt) and llabanja (cape), the latter identical with the llabanja which the herdsmen of SE Albania wear to this day. (Studinie historike ii [I973] 87-IOO; Iliria ii [1972] 149-57 [French ed.]; iii [1975] 451-5 [French ed.]; iv [1976] 385-409 [French ed.]; vi [1976] 149-63, 338-40.) Berat (Excavations by H. Spahiu, 1973-75, I978). During excavations in the Illyrian/Albanian city of Antipatrea/Berat, the stratigraphy of the site was clarified and the defence system, in which several phases of construction were identified, was traced. The earliest stratum (6th-Sth cent. B.C.) yielded fragments of the mud plaster used in the houses and pottery produced locally or imported from Corinth and southern Italy. The second stratum (4th-Ist cent. B.C.) was associated</page><page sequence="11">II2 Z. ANDREA with the time when the settlement developed into an Illyrian city and was provided with a powerful system of fortifications (Iliria xiii.I [1983] II9-35). In this stratum a large number of fragments of pottery vessels of daily use (cups, bowls, skyphoi, plates, hydriae, amphorae, etc.) and a mass of tiles, mostly of local production, were found. Imports from Greece are represented by vases of the Megarian type. Although Anti- patrea was devastated during the Illyrian-Roman wars, life continued there without interruption. A large quantity of pottery fragments (cups, plates, bowls, amphorae, etc.) from the Ist-4th cent. A.D., the period to which the third stratum belongs, was found. The fourth stratum (4th-6th cent. A.D.) is represented by pottery characteristic of Late Antiquity (pots, bowls, pitchers, oinochoai, amphorae, cups, etc.), by metal objects, and by some coins of Anastasius I and Justinian I. The latest stratum belongs to the mediaeval period (7th-I4th cent.). Here many fragments of kitchen and table-ware were found, especially glazed pottery, tiles, metal objects, and Byzantine coins of the I2th-I4th cent. Finds from later periods indicate the continuity of life within the castle during the Turkish occupation and indeed down to our own day. SKRAPAR DISTRICT Prishta (Excavations by L. Ylli, I973-75). The fortress of Prishta stands on a hill W of the village. The first excavations concentrated on the circuit-wall, remains of which are preserved along the whole length of the hill. It was built of ashlar blocks and enclosed an area of 5 hectares. Excavations were also carried out in other parts of the fortress. The main entrance, built in the 4th-3rd cent. B.C. in the form of a corridor 5 m. long X 2 m. wide, was revealed. In the wall W of the entrance four courses are preserved. The remains of a house and its arched gate date from the 3rd-4th cent. A.D. Another house, of the 5th-6th cent. A.D., was built with stone taken from the circuit-wall and the ruins of tower A. The treasure of Verzhezha. In 1978, near the village of Verzhezha, a hoard of about 200 Byzantine silver coins (IIth-I2th cent.) was discovered by chance-the first of its kind in Albania. Most of the coins, which are also the earliest, are of John II Comnenus, while the remainder are of Isaac II Angelus. (Iliria xiii. 2 [1983] in press.) POGRADEC DISTRICT Pogradec (Excavations by S. Anamali, 1973). The excavations in the fortress of Pogradec, which stands on a hill NW of the town overlooking Lake Ohri, continued those carried out in I970-7I. They brought to light the remaining part of the circuit-walls, built in the 4th-6th cent. A.D. Of considerable interest are the numerous objects discovered-local and imported pottery, terracottas, metal ornaments, weapons, and tools, coins, and especially tackle and other articles connected with fishing. As both the fortifications and the artifacts show, the two most flourishing periods of the fortress' life were the 4th-ist cent. B.C. and the 4th-8th cent. A.D., but the site was occupied without interruption from the Archaic period to the Early Middle Ages (Iliria iii [I975] 481-6 [French ed.]; ix-x [I979-80] 211-58.) KOReA DISTRICT Podgori (Excavations by M. Korkuti and Zh. Andrea, directed by F. Prendi, 1982). Excavations concentrated on a prehistoric settlement, with many broad horizontal strata, inhabited from the Early Neolithic to the Bronze Age. It was most flourishing during the Early Neolithic period, which is represented by a stratum 3.2 m. thick with seven horizons of settlement and three sub-phases of development (Podgori Ia, b, c). This stratum yielded a very large quantity of pottery with a variety of decorative styles. In Podgori Ia the main categories are: monochrome red, with a little grey and black; pottery decorated with white designs on red glaze of good quality (Fig. 16), rarely with red on white; polychrome and 'impresso' Fig. i6 pottery. In Podgori Ib, barbotine pottery appears for the first time. In Podgori Ic, pottery with drawn designs is rare and of a poorer quality and disappears completely in the upper deposits. In addition to pottery, stone tools such as massive axes, various types of flint adzes, bone awls and needles were found. Also found were a number of earthenware objects- stylized anthropomorphic terracottas with long necks and of the steatopygous type, tables and vessels connected with religious rites, pendants, etc. The Podgori I culture, which represents the earliest Neolithic phase in the Korga district, has many similarities to the early Yugoslav and Aegean Neolithic cultures of Macedonia. Several forms of vessel, the red monochrome pottery, the pottery with white designs on red, and the 'impresso' and barbotine pottery are related to the Proto-Sesklo and Pre-Sesklo phases of the Early Neolithic of Thessaly. Some elements, such as the polychrome pottery and a series of original motifs, clearly differentiate the Neolithic Fig. 17</page><page sequence="12">ARCHAEOLOGY IN ALBANIA, I973-83 113 culture of Podgori from the contemporary cultures in neighbouring areas to the E and SE. Also of interest is the discovery of graves within the settle- ment with the skeletons placed in a crouching position-the earliest examples of this burial method in Albania (Fig. I7). Vashtemi (Excavations by M. Korkuti, I974). Near the village of Vashtemi a settlement of the Podgori I culture was discovered. It has one stratum which could be parallel with two later phases (Podgori Ib, Ic) of the development of this culture (Iliria xii. 2 [1982] 9I-I46.) Dunavec (Excavations by M. Korkuti, I973). The excava- tions continued those undertaken in 1971 at this Middle Neolithic settlement. Two phases of development were identified. The earliest horizon of the Dunavec I phase is represented by pile-dwellings, the second by dwellings built directly on the ground. Characteristic of Dunavec I are the glazed monochrome black pottery, barbotine pottery, rhytons with four legs, and terracottas of the steatopygous type (Figs 18, 19) similar to those of Thessaly. Typical of the Dunavec II phase is pottery decorated with incisions, with white incrusta- tion, with fluting, etc. Some forms of vessel, the incised decora- tion, the rhytons, and the anthropomorphic forms link this culture to the Middle Neolithic culture of Elatea in Greece as well as to the Middle Neolithic cultures of Central Bosnia and Dalmatia. (Iliria v [I975] 395-400 [French ed.].) Fig. 18 Fig. 20 brown designs and with incised black pottery, has features similar to those of Maliq Ia, but there are differences as well, and the Barc culture may well be earlier than the Maliq I- Kamnik culture. In the cemetery two tumuli, built of earth and encircled by rings of stone (Fig. 20), were excavated. They contained 205 graves of three kinds-a simple trench, a trench lined with stones, an ur placed in a trench. The graves, which date from the EBA to the 6th-5th cent. B.C., yielded rich and varied finds. The pottery is mainly of local production, and particularly noteworthy are vases with the Devollian style of painted decoration (Fig. 21). They were made from pure clay, carefully worked, and well fired to a brick or ochre colour. The decoration, including geometric and linear designs, chequer-work motifs, and ears of wheat, was applied before firing in red, crimson or brown on a smooth surface and was sometimes glazed (Studia Albanica ii [I966] 255; Les illyriens et la genese des albanais [I97I] 55-83; Iliria iii [I974] 389). The graves also contained imported Greek pottery of the sub- Mycenaean (Fig. 22) and Protogeometric periods. The ornaments are represented by spectacle fibulae, diadems, glass and amber beads, and many long bronze pins similar to those Fig. I9 Burimas (Excavations by M. Korkuti, 1981). In the stratigraphy of the prehistoric settlement of Burimas, which lies on the hill S of the village of the same name, two phases of development (Burimas I and II) were identified. Characteristic of Burimas I is light-coloured pottery with designs in brown as well as black and red pottery with forms typical of the Late Neolithic Maliq I-Kamnik culture. Burimas II, with glazed black or grey-black pottery, decorated with grey painting, incised motifs, and mouldings, represents the earliest phase in the development of the Eneolithic culture of the Korca basin (Maliq II). (Iliria xii. i [I982] 252-3.) Barq. The Neolithic settlement was excavated by P. Lera (1981, 1983) and the tumulus cemetery by Zh. Andrea (I973-75). (Iliria iii [I975] 4I5-I8 [French ed.]; vi [1976] 331-3; xii. I [1982] 257-9.) In the settlement two cultural strata were identified. The earlier (Barc I), with monochrome red, barbotine, and 'impresso' pottery, and with little pottery with white designs on red, is related to the last phase of Podgori I. The later stratum (Barc II), with its light-coloured pottery with Fig. 21</page><page sequence="13">TI4 Z. ANDREA the LBA stratum (Maliq IIId) two phases of development of the decorative Devollian style pottery were identified: in the earlier phase (Maliq IIIdI) the design was applied after firing, while in the later phase (Maliq IIId2) it was applied before firing. (Iliria iii [I9751 401-6 [French ed.].) Symiza (Excavations by P. Lera and Gj. Karaiskaj, I973, I975). On the hill called Gradisht, near the village of Symiza, lie the ruins of a fortified Illyrian settlement. The excavations showed that its earliest phase belongs to the EIA, while at the end of the 4th cent. B.C. it developed into an urban centre encircled by stone walls built of ashlar blocks without mortar. It continued to be inhabited during the Roman period, Late Fig. 22 from the tumular necropolis of Vergina and the Kerameikos cemetery in Athens. The few bronze weapons include knives similar to those of late Aegean type. Maliq (Excavations by F. Prendi, I973-74). Excavations were undertaken, in continuation of those of I96i-66 (Studia Albanica ii [I966] 225-80), in order to verify the stratigraphy of this very important prehistoric settlement. As a result of the latest excavations, the previous chronological division of the Maliq culture into seven phases was replaced by a broader system of ten phases. In the Late Neolithic stratum two small phases of development (Maliq Ia, Ib) were distinguished. Maliq Ib contains along with elements of the Maliq I-Kamnik culture certain other elements which are characteristic of the Eneolithic Maliq II, including several forms of vessel such as milk pots, cups with oval necks, vases with tall legs and fluting, and the grey design on a grey-black background. So Maliq Ib clearly represents a transitional stage in the development of the Maliq culture from Neolithic to Eneolithic. On the basis of the horizontal and vertical stratigraphy, two phases of the MBA stratum (Maliq IIIcI, IIIc2) were also distinguished. In the Maliq IIIcI stratum a large quantity of pottery fragments were discovered, mostly of dark colours, belonging to vases with two handles rising a little above the brim, small jugs with spherical bodies, cups with out-turned lips, goblets, conical- bodied bowls, and vases with tongue-shaped handles. In addition to these types, known from the EBA (Maliq IIIa, b), some new types were found, e.g. vessels with wide biconical necks and two high handles similar to the Minyan kantharos, e vessels with semicircular handles rising above the brims, and conical cups with one handle. In the Maliq IIIc2 stratum the pottery is of lighter colours and the characteristic shapes include narrow-waisted vessels with two vertical handles, amphorae ;~... with crescent handles, and cups with 'wish-bone' handles. In Fig. 23</page><page sequence="14">ARCHAEOLOGY IN ALBANIA, I973-83 TI5 Antiquity, and the Middle Ages. (Iliria iii [I975] 473-7 [French ed.]; vi [1976] 350-2; ix-x [1979-80] I7I-2Io.) The treasure ofHija e korbit. In the village of Pocesht in the Korca district a hoard of I,500 silver coins was found by chance in 1982. They include coins of Athens, Macedonia under Alexander the Great, Lysimacheia, Syrian Antioch, and Antigonus Gonatas. KOLONJA DISTRICT Prodan (Excavations by S. Aliu, I973). The excavations were concentrated on a tumulus near the town of Erseka. 75 graves of the LBA and EIA were discovered. Earthenware vessels of local production, weapons, including two bronze knives of late Mycenaean types, and various ornaments were found. (Iliria iii [I975] 421-4 [French ed.].) Rehova (Excavations by S. Aliu, 1979-80). During excavation of the tumulus of Rehova 285 graves were opened, a few belonging to the LIA, the remainder to different phases of the EIA. The finds consisted of earthenware vessels, weapons, and ornaments similar to those from the tumuli at Barc. Also of interest were the Early Mediaeval graves, the articles in which were of local origin. Borova (Excavations by S. Aliu and J. Qirjako, 1980). In the non-tumular cemetery near the village of Borova 49 graves, consisting of holes encircled by stones, were discovered. Most of the burials were inhumations, a few were cremations. They date from the 7th-5th cent. and 4th-2nd cent. B.C. The graves yielded a wealth of pottery, weapons, and ornaments. The pottery of the 7th-5th cent. B.C. comprises not only typical Illyrian types, but also locally produced vases of Greek types and imported articles. An interesting find is a late 7th-cent. B.C. bronze helmet-the earliest Illyrian-type helmet found in Albania. PERMET DISTRICT Benja (Excavations by M. Korkuti, 1983). These first excava- tions in the Benja cave (Fig. 23), near the village of the same name, showed that it had been inhabited uninterruptedly from the Eneolithic period to the Iron Age. In the Eneolithic stratum black monochrome pottery with grey designs was found. In the EBA stratum many fragments of barbotine pottery were found together with black monochrome pottery, showing that these two techniques co-existed. There is a wealth of pottery from the MBA and especially from the Late Bronze and Early Iron Ages, mainly in the Devollian style. Piskova (Excavations by N. Bodinaku, 1978-79). In the tumular necropolis near the village of Piskova in the upper Vjosa valley three tumuli were opened. Tumulus I, although damaged, was the largest in the necropolis, 4.5 m. high, and was notable for its interesting and complex structure (Fig. 24). It contained 116 graves, mainly of the cist type with the bodies in a crouching or prone position, dating from the EBA to the Mediaeval period. (Iliria xi. 2 [1981] 243-62.) Tumulus II, 1.5 m. high, was raised above a central cist-grave opened under the base in the centre of a bed of stones which covered it. The oldest graves belong to the end of the Bronze Age and the beginning of the Iron Age. In the period of the Illyrian cities, the 4th-2nd cent. B.C., there were many burials, and the tumulus was used again in the Early Middle Ages. It contained 246 cist-graves with the bodies placed in a crouching or prone position. Tumulus III, 2.7 m. high, was built over a central cist-grave opened under the base, which was encircled by a single ring of stones. The tumulus contained 60 cist-graves with the bodies either crouching or prone. In the earlier graves the pottery is of local production and, in addition to local types, includes the Devollian type, which had extended to this region; there are few metal objects-leaf-shaped bronze spear- heads and bronze pins. As for the period of the 6th-2nd cent. B.C., which includes the period of the Illyrian cities, a great quantity and variety of ceramic and metal articles came to light. VLORA DISTRICT Dukat. Three tumuli were excavated in the tumular necro- polis of the Dukat plain-tumulus I by N. Ceka (I973), tumuli II and III by N. Bodinaku (I974). Tumulus I, 2 m. high, was built upon a bed of stones, which covered the central Fig. 24</page><page sequence="15">ii6 Z. ANDREA grave, and was encircled by a ring of stones. It contained 22 graves from the LBA to the 8th cent. B.C., mainly trenches with the bodies in a crouching or prone position. (Iliria iii [1975] 139-61 [French ed.].) Tumulus II is 2.I7 m. high. A bed of stones covered the central grave, with trenches opened below base-level, and the tumulus had a stone covering. It contained 53 graves, simple trenches, generally encircled and covered with stones, with the bodies usually placed in the two positions encountered in tumulus I, while cist-graves, dating from the beginning of the Iron Age, were rare. The graves belong to the period from the MBA to the beginning of the Iron Age, apart from the central grave, which is even earlier, and some secondary graves which date from Late Antiquity and the Middle Ages. The fids in the graves were quite rich. The pottery is mostly of local production, but includes some imported Greek ware. Some leaf-shaped lance-heads and ornaments such as fibulae, long bronze pins, necklets, and knobs for embossing shields were discovered. Only three graves contained no articles. Mavrova (Excavations by B. Dautaj, 1979). The circuit- walls of this fortified Illyrian settlement were traced, and the first period of building in the first half of the 4th cent. B.C. was distinguished from the second period in the second half of the same century. The earliest stratum, belonging to the proto- urban phase, contained pottery of the Late Devollian type together with imported Ionian pottery of the 7th-6th cent. B.C. Of particular interest was the discovery of eight coins of the Illyrian city of Olympae, which is almost certainly to be identified with Mavrova. (Iliria xi. i [i98I] 57-9I). Triport (Excavations by V. Bereti, I975-76). The excava- tions at Triport on the hill known as Pllaka enabled three strata to be identified. The first belongs to the 5th-4th cent. B.C.- the time of the settlement's origin. The second stratum covers the period from the late 3rd cent. to the mid-2nd cent. B.C., when the settlement developed into an urban centre and extended not only over the hill, but also around it, as is proved by the remains of a wall at the edge of the sea. In the last century and a half B.C. it contracted into a quayside place, while the remains from Late Antiquity are even scantier. (Iliria vii-viii [1977-8] 285-92.) Mesaplik. (Excavations by D. Komata and P. Kulla, 1979). A Palaeo-Christian (6th cent. A.D.) basilica was discovered. The floor of the apse is laid with a polychrome mosaic of geometric designs (diamonds, trapeziums, bands) and a series of floral and zoomorphic motifs. Of particular interest in the northern section is a striking medallion containing the portrait of a man in profile; near by is the inscription ATAPKEAC. Kanina (Excavations by D. Komata, 1973, 1975, I977). The excavations in the fortress of Kanina, SE of Vlora, yielded stratigraphic information which enables the successive phases of development to be identified. The earliest stratum belongs to the proto-urban period (7th-5th cent. B.C.) and is followed by the strata of the ancient Illyrian period (4th cent. B.C.- 3rd cent. A.D.), Late Antiquity (4th-6th cent. A.D.), and the Middle Ages (7th-I4th cent.). A large quantity and variety of pottery of all these periods was discovered. Of special interest is the Byzantine pottery (IIth-I4th cent.) for domestic use (jugs, plates, bowls, cups, lamps, etc.), the vessels having glazed monochrome or polychrome surfaces and being decorated with geometric, floral, and zoomorphic designs. As for the fortification system (Fig. 25), four main periods Fig. 25 of construction were distinguished. The earliest belongs to the second half of the 4th cent. B.C., when Kanina developed into an Illyrian urban centre and was encircled with walls of ashlar masonry. In Late Antiquity (5th-7th cent. A.D.) the walls were rebuilt, the builders following the line of the Illyrian fortification and using the 'opus mixtum' technique. In the Early Mediaeval period (9th-Ioth cent.) the circuit-wall and towers were reconstructed with ancient blocks, while the last phase of the fortification belongs to the I3th cent. The excavations brought to light the ruins of various walls and buildings, cobbled streets, water-channels, and cisterns associated with the urban life of the Illyrian and Mediaeval periods. (Iliria iii [I975] 487-93 [French ed.]; vi [I976] 358-9; ix-x [1979-80] 259-78.) SARANDA DISTRICT Badhra (Excavations by M. Korkuti, 1979-80). The excava- tions in this fortified settlement on the coast of the Ionian Sea traced the circuit-wall. Following the contours, it was built of unhewn stones without mortar and had the main entrance on the S side. This wall is associated with a narrow stratum in which pottery, typical of the LBA, was discovered. Of special interest are several houses, which, to judge by the pottery found in one of them, must also belong to the LBA. Of rectangular or elliptical shape, they were built of unhewn stones of small to medium size and are the first houses of this kind in Albania. Qeparo (Excavations by J. Koci, I974-75). N of the village of Qeparo, on the rocky hill of Karos, stands a fortress. On the W side it has a natural defence, while on the other three sides it is encircled by three concentric lines of walls built of unhewn stone without mortar. The fortifications are associated with a narrow stratum in which pottery of the EIA, about the 9th cent. B.C., was discovered. The 4th cent. B.C. marked the final period of the life of the fortress, which served also as a place of refuge for inhabitants of the surrounding area. Within the castle some houses built in the 6th-7th cent. A.D., as well as pottery and ornaments of this period, were discovered. A cemetery situated near the castle is associated with this late settlement. (Iliria vi [1976] 235-43). 4(uka e Ajtojt (Excavations by S. Islami, 1978-79). On the hill named quka e Ajtojt, situated near Konispol about 20 km. S of Butrint, are the ruins of an Illyrian city. The aim of the</page><page sequence="16">ARCHAEOLOGY IN ALBANIA, 1973-83 117 excavations was to investigate the fortification system and the ruins of some houses. The crown of the hill, encircled with an elliptical defence wall with a perimeter of I,Ioo m., enclosing an area of about 5 hectares, constituted the acropolis. Outside the circuit-wall lay the lower city, the remains of which can be seen on the NW side and to some extent on the S side. The circuit-wall is built of polygonal masonry and has battlements in place of towers. In this respect quka e Ajtojt is unique among Illyrian-Epirot fortifications. The acropolis has four gates, three of which are of the so-called tangential type. The ruins of many houses are clearly visible on the surface; about 40 were excavated in the acropolis and another group in the lower city. quka e Ajtojt was at the height of its prosperity in the 5th-Ist cent. B.C. In Late Antiquity it was reduced to a fortress of small proportions, probably built in the time of Justinian I. Butrint. The ancient city ofButrint (Buthrotum) is of great archaeological interest, because we are able to follow its development from its origin through antiquity to the Middle Ages. Recent excavations have been concentrated on the acropolis, the circuit-walls, the area near the theatre, and the SE area near the baptistry. (a) Acropolis (Excavations by Dh. Budina and A. Manaj, directed by S. Islami, 1982). The complex stratigraphy of the settlement on the acropolis was clarified. The earliest stratum, with local and imported pottery, is associated with the creation of a fortified proto-urban centre in the 6th-Sth cent. B.C. The later strata include structures and pottery of the Roman and mediaeval periods, as well as classical and Hellenistic pottery. (b) Circuit-walls (Excavations by Dh. Budina and F. Drini I977-80). In the 5th cent. B.C. Butrint began to develop into a city, and the earliest circuit-walls, of polygonal masonry, belong to the second half of that century. In the Hellenistic period the city spread to the E and N slopes of the hill and was encircled by a new system of walls of trapezoidal and rectangular blocks, enclosing an area of 5 hectares. Near the walls a building with mosaic floors dating from the ist cent. A.D. was discovered. On the W side a tower built of rectangular blocks removed from an older building was discovered. Some of the blocks bear inscriptions (Fig. 26). All the inscriptions-86 have been recovered so far-relate to the manumission of slaves in the 2nd-Ist cent. B.C. They provide valuable information of a social, economic, political, and juridical character about Butrint, which served as a centre for the tribe of the Prasaibi and the population of the surrounding district. (Iliria xi. i [1981] 227-34.) (c) Area near the theatre (Excavations by S. Islami, 1982). The portico on the E side of the theatre was completely exposed. Its plan was clarified, and it was established that it retained its function until the Ist cent. A.D., when it was incorporated in residential buildings. A peristyle house, in which the different phases of construction were identified, was excavated. In the Ist-2nd cent. A.D. intensive building activity which seriously damaged the pre-Roman city took place in this area. The discovery of a bath-house (Fig. 27) in the same area, the fifth discovered to date, suggests that Butrint was a balneal centre in this district. (d) SE area. Excavations (by K. Lako, 1975-76) brought to light a number of buildings behind the circuit-wall and showed that life in this small region of the city continued from the 2nd to the I3th cent. A.D., but was most flourishing in the 4th cent., as is proved by the large quantity of ceramic and numismatic material (Iliria vii-viii [1977-78] 293-9.) Excavations (by S. Anamali, I982) near the baptistry brought to light a complex of buildings divided from the baptistry by a narrow street and, near by, a church built in Late Antiquity and rebuilt in the Middle Ages. Associated with the church was a cemetery in which pottery of types known from the Early Mediaeval Albanian cemeteries of the 6th-8th cent. was Fig. 26</page><page sequence="17">II8 Z. ANDREA second half of the 3rd cent. B.C. to control the road con- necting Butrint and (Cuka e Ajtojt. In the ist cent. A.D. it was transformed into a prosperous rural residence associated with the agricultural environment. In its centre a peristyle courtyard with three rooms around it was discovered. Saranda (Excavations by K. Lako, 1979-80, 1983). Excava- tions have brought to light a Christian basilica of the 5th-6th cent. A.D. within the castle. It was built as an adaptation of a major earlier building. The excavations have revealed its polychrome mosaic floors with geometric and floral designs, including some unique in Albania. Excavations have been undertaken also in the castle built in the 4th-sth cent. A.D. The plan and line of the circuit-walls were ascertained, and one of the main entrances to the castle, the steps, and six towers were brought to light. GJIROKASTRA DISTRICT Antigonea (Excavations by Dh. Budina, I973-4). During excavations in the fortress of Jerma, near the village of Saraqinishta, in 1966-70 some bronze voting-disks were discovered, whose inscriptions prove that the site (Fig. 28) is Fig. 27 discovered. It is evident that this part of the city, built on the remains of earlier buildings, was important from Late Antiquity to the Early Middle Ages. Borsh (Excavations by J. Koci, 1976, 1980). On the hill of Sopot, N of the village of Borsh, lie the ruins of an ancient city which controlled the coastal road of Chaonia to southern Albania. The excavations traced the circuit-walls and showed that two main periods of construction during the 4th-3rd cent. B.C. are to be distinguished. Several houses were excavated within the circuit-walls. Excavations in the necro- polis revealed graves with coffins of stone slabs and a monu- mental grave with a cylindrical arch which date from the 3rd cent. B.C. (Iliria vii-viii [1977-78] 269-73). Finiq (Excavations by Dh. Budina, 1973, 1980-81). In the ancient city of Finiq (Phoenice), capital of Epirus and Chaonia, some exploratory excavations were carried out. In the S part of the site three graves of the 3rd cent. B.C. containing sarcophagi were excavated, while three others were discovered in the W part. Two of them yielded rich finds comprising 30 objects-kantharoi, plates, cups, skyphoi, lamps, etc. On the W slope of the hill remains of the theatre built in the 4th-3rd cent. B.C. were discovered. The wall of the stage, 35 m. in extent, and some blocks of the seating were found in situ. Malathre (Excavations by Dh. Condi, 1980, 1983). To the E of the village of Mursi, a fortification of rectangular form, reinforced at the four corers with towers and at the main entrance with false arches, was excavated. It was built in the Fig. 28 that of Antigonea, an important city of Chaonia (Iliria ii [1972] 269-378 [French ed.]). During the latest campaigns the extent of the city and its fortification system were traced further. The circuit-wall, built of ashlar and polygonal masonry and reinforced by II square towers, had a perimeter of 4,000 m. and enclosed an area of 45 hectares; the construction technique and archaeological discoveries suggest that it belongs to the 4th cent. B.C. In the SE comer of the city a Christian basilica, built on a triconch plan in the 5th-6th cent. A.D., was dis- covered. Its floor was covered with a polychrome mosaic (Fig. 29) containing a variety of motifs and four Greek inscriptions referring to the builders of the basilica and to those who served in it. (Iliria vii-viii [I977-78] 225-35.) Paleokastra (Excavations by A. Bace, I974-75). The fortress of Paleokastra, SE of Gjirokastra, stands at the confluence of the rivers Drino and Kardhiq and served as a station for military units which controlled the roads along the two valleys. In plan it is a regular trapezium; the walls, enclosing an area of one hectare, are reinforced by II towers, and there are three gateways, the main gateway being in the</page><page sequence="18">ARCHAEOLOGY IN ALBANIA, 1973-83 II9 Fig. 29 middle of the W side. Of importance is the discovery of a block bearing two dedicatory inscriptions which reveal that the fortress was in the province of Epirus and that its construction was carried out under the supervision of the governor in the years A.D. 311-314. In the 5th-6th cent. the place was re- fortified and two Christian basilicas belong to this period. (Iliria vi [1976] 352-4.) The castle of Gjirokastra (Excavations by D. Komata, 1983). The first excavations in the mediaeval castle of Gjirokastra show that the hill on which it is built began its existence as a small settlement in the 4th-3rd cent. B.C., was fortified in the 5th cent. A.D., and was extended and refortified during the Middle Ages. At the time of the creation of feudal principalities, in the I3th-I4th cent., it assumed the form of a mediaeval city. The important results of the excavations of the last ten years include rich numismatic finds in the Illyrian cities, in Dyrrhachium and Apollonia, and in the mediaeval cities and castles. Numismatic finds, as well as other archaeological discoveries, confirm the economic prosperity of southern Illyria in the 4th-2nd cent. B.C. (see e.g. Iliria vii-viii [1977-78] 83-112, on the coinage of Amantia.) Again, the discoveries of Byzantine coins furnish vivid evidence of the economic development of Albania, and of the intercommunication between different districts of the country, in the 5th-I3th cent. (Iliria ix-x [1979-80] 353-422.) The excavations have also brought to light many human skeletal remains ranging from the beginning of the Neolithic (end of 6th millennium B.C.) to the Late Mediaeval period (8th-9th cent. A.D.). Some of the skeletons from the Middle Ages and the Illyrian urban period have already been studied, while those from the earlier periods are being examined in the anthropological laboratory of the Centre for Archaeo- logical Research.
