<plain_text><page sequence="1">ATNA AND TLINGIT SHAMANISM: WITCHCRAFT ON THE NORTHWEST COAST FREDERICA DE LAGUNA Abstract. Shamanism, sorcery, and witchcraft of the Athapaskan Atna and the Tlingit of Alaska are compared and contrasted, applying Murdock!s criteria. The analysis is extended to other Northwest Coast and interior tribes. The prominence of witchcraft beliefs among the Tlingit and their presence on the northern coast, in contrast to their absence on the central and southern coast, is explored and the possibility of Russian influences on aboriginal systems of sorcery is suggested. INTRODUCTION I had been reading George Peter Murdock!s last book, Theories of Illness: A World Survey (1980), when I was invited to take part in a symposium on relations between coastal and in- terior peoples in northwestern America (see Acknowledgements). It seemed to me that Murdock's observations about sorcery and witchcraft, and the distinction he made be- tween these, could shed light if applied to the two Alaskan native cultures that I know best: the Tlingit of the coast and the Atna Atha- paskans of the Copper River valley. I did fieldwork among the Tlingit in 1949, 1950, 1952, and 1954, and also know them through research done for my own publications and for the editing of G. T. Emmons* posthumous monograph (n.d.). I know the Atna from fieldwork in 1945, 1958, 1960, and 1968, and from the scanty literature on them. My paper was at first limited to a comparison between Atna and Tlingit beliefs, and while these seemed to fit fairly well into Murdochs scheme, I later wondered whether this would also be true for the beliefs of other northwestern tribes. The present essay, therefore, at- tempts to apply Murdochs theoretical approach to sorcery and witchcraft in northwestern North America, and asks why witchcraft seems to have been most highly developed among the late nineteenth century Tlingit. Murdock (1980:17-22) utilized data from 186 societies represented in the Human Relations Area Files and distinguished three categories of supernatural causes of illness: (1) mysti- cal (fate, ominous sensations, contagion, mystical retribution for taboo violation), which is widespread but nowhere of major importance; (2) animistic (soul loss, spirit aggression), which is very important and common in many societies, and (3) magical, comprising sorcery (aggressive use of injurious magical techniques) and witchcraft (voluntary or involuntary aggres- sive action by a specially endowed evil person). "The distinction between witchcraft and sorcery [is] difficult to comprehend for individuals lacking actual experience with either practice" (Murdock 1980:21-22). To understand beliefs in supernatural causa- tion of illness, we have to start with the dis- tinctions made by specific peoples and with concepts in their own cultural contexts, as was done by Evans-Pritchard (1937), in his seminal volume on magic, sorcery, witchcraft, and oracles among the Azande, and by the authors of Walker* s (1970) collection of articles on witchcraft and sorcery in North America. We appreciate the reluctance of ethnographers to export conceptual categories from one region for application elsewhere, or to make clear dis- tinctions between different kinds of injurious magic, with the resultant tendency to use the terms "witchcraft" and "sorcery" interchange- ably. But cross-cultural inquiries demand that some definitions and categories, though possibly arbitrary, be used and tested. I shall here follow Murdochs distinction between sorcery and witchcraft because it seems appli- cable to the American Northwest and may have historical significance . The sorcerer (male or female) causes illness by using spells and magical techniques (Mur- dock 1980:21, 65-70). These may involve Frederica de Laguna, Department of Anthropology, Bryn Mawr College, Bryn Mawr, PA 19010 ARCTIC ANTHROPOLOGY Vol. 24, No. 1, pp. 84-100, 1987</page><page sequence="2">de Laguna: Atna and Tlingit Shamanism 85 imitative or contagious magic in which the sorcerer manipulates the victimfs clothing or effluvia. Or, he may "shoot" something into the victim's body, or send a spirit to steal the latter1 s soul. This "black magic" is theoretically available to anyone who can ac- quire the techniques. The witch (male or female) is someone who is intrinsically evil, and witchcraft does not depend on acquired skills. "Witches are en- dowed with a special power and propensity for evil," as a "sort of class prerogative," and "are believed to use their powers exclusively for malign purposes, and they are conse- quently loathed as well as feared" (Murdock 1980:21, 67, 70). Murdock also states that there is no counter- witchcraft, like the counter- spells of "white magic" of the sor- cerer. Amulets or spells may ward off witch- craft, but there is no cure, unless the witch responsible can be forced to undo the harm, if that is possible. The sorcerer, or sorcerer- shaman, who can both kill and cure and also control luck, may be viewed ambivalently, with a kind of fearful hope. On the whole, there is gratitude for his benevolence as a curer. The witch is the one upon whom resentment and fears are pro- jected. The accused is apt to be the unpopu- lar and helpless: the senile, the cripple, the orphan without kin, or the slave (see Murdock 1980:67). And, when the rich and mighty fall ill, they look for the witch among those whom they may have injured or who may have cause for jealousy and envy. Using innovative statistical techniques, Murdock explored the tendencies of the various theories of illness to be associated with "ideo- logical regions" (meta culture areas), with certain features of social structure, and with each other. Thus, witchcraft and sorcery, as he defined them, are negatively correlated with each other as reported causes of illness, and both are negatively correlated with spirit aggression (Murdock 1980:64-81). He also found that sorcery theories of ill- ness are more important in North America than in any other part of the world, although be- liefs in illness as mystical retribution for breaking ritual and food taboos are also common there. In South America, by contrast, theories of spirit aggression, especially by ghosts, are more developed than in any other major area, although theft of the soul by sorcery is also a prominent belief. In East Asia, beliefs in aggression by spirits or demons are very important, while theories of sorcery and mystical retribution are not. The Insular Pacific area ranks high in spirit aggres- sion and sorcery, but below average in beliefs ascribing illness to taboo violations. In sub- Saharan Africa, ascription of illness to mysti- cal retribution ranks very high, but spirit aggression (by ancestors) and sorcery are less prevalent (Murdock 1980:49-52). "The Circum- Mediterranean shows an enormously higher in- cidence of witchcraft theories than any other region," although surpassed even there by spirit aggression (Murdock 1980:49). The Evil Eye is usually associated with witchcraft. Conditions favorable to witchcraft fears, according to Murdock (1980:60-62, 67-70), are found in societies with marked social classes (creating envy of the haves by the have-nots), patrilocal residence and polygyny (creating insecurity among married-in wives who are separated from their kin and are apt to be jealous or mistrustful of each other), and sub- stantial bride-price (creating competition be- tween brothers for wives or between sons and their father). No other theory of illness seems to be as closely correlated with social traits or as limited to specific areas. These distributions and correlations, if Murdock1 s data are adequate, pose questions about the social, psychological, and historical conditions affecting the incidence of these beliefs. Since sorcery is negatively correlated with witchcraft and is so highly developed in North America, the appearance of witchcraft beliefs in certain regions of the New World, such as on the Northwest Coast, invites com- ment. We may also ask whether sorcery and witchcraft, as defined by Murdock, are suf- ficiently correlated with degrees of social com- plexity to serve as distinguishing features be- tween tribes of the Northwest Coast and the adjacent interior. In MurdockTs sample, shown on Table 1, the Northwest Coast is represented by the Haida (among whom he did fieldwork), Bella Coola, and Twana, with the Yurok as southern outliers; in the northwest interior he selected the Ingalik of Alaska, the Slave of Yukon Ter- ritory, and the Kaska of British Columbia (all three Athapaskans). To these I have added the Tlingit of the coast and the Atna of in- terior Alaska, and have followed Murdock by indicating on a scale of 1 to 3 what I believe to have been the relative importance of the various supernatural causes of illness. My data refer to the late nineteenth century when shamanism was important among both these groups. According to the Tlingit, their shamans did not cause illness and did little firsthand curing themselves. The Tlingit also believed in witches, and even in recent years there have been outbreaks of witchcraft fears (de Laguna 1960:200, note 56). Among the Atna, the shaman or sorcerer- shaman might be held responsible for both illness and cure.

One clan of the Gulf Coast (Yakutat) Tlingit is of Atna derivation, and the Atna of the Chitina area on the lower Copper River claim a Tlingit origin for one of their own clans. Both peoples have matrilineal moieties divided into clans. Among the Tlingit, the clan is the major social-political-ceremonial unit. The Atna clans are too small to func- tion in such capacities, so the village substi- tutes for the clan. The Atna have tried to support social and ceremonial institutions on levels like those of the Tlingit, whom they admire, but they remain simpler in social organization and poorer in means of subsis- tence and in prestige wealth.</page><page sequence="4">de Laguna: Atna and Tlingit Shamanism 87 The Atna leaders were the entrepreneurs, the able hunters who were also wealthy from intertribal trade with the Russians and, later, with the Americans on the coast as well as with the Indians of the upper Tanana. They controlled the caribou fences and fish weirs, and attracted followers because they could feed them. They were often autocratic in their rule. But political alignments shifted as leaders grew old and were replaced by younger men, rising in wealth and power. Therefore, there could be no permanent aris- tocracy, no matter how grand a style might be assumed by a leader and his family. Nor could there be fixed succession to leadership in any clan or settlement. The Atna them- selves recognized this cycle from riches to rags. The Tlingit had a nobility made up of clan and lineage chiefs ("masters of houses") and their immediate families, and were careful to arrange marriages between those of the same social status. Though a bride-price might be given, this was usually equalled by return gifts from the brideTs family. Below the aristocrats were their middle-class relatives and clansmen, who shared their houses, and, lowest of all, the freed slaves who lived just within the door. If there were no sharp class lines, there were gradations of rank. The Tlingit had true chattel slavery, and every wealthy house chief owned slaves for menial work, to sell or give away, and to kill or free at potlatch time. Being chattels, slaves did not constitute a fourth class in Tlingit eyes. The Atna also claim to have had "slaves," but these seem to have been only homeless drudges or widows in mourning. Leaders among both Atna and Tlingit were polygynous. While the Atna seem to have been more aware of jealousy between co-wives, the leader ideally sought political and military allies by taking wives from as many clans as possible, even from his own! (His brothers- in-law would all stand together and fight for him like a family of wolves, it was said.) The Tlingit preferred to marry women who were sisters, but distrusted the loyalty of their wives since, in case of interclan trouble, a woman might side with her brother rather than with her husband. Both tribes stressed marriage with cross- cousins, especially the taking of a spouse from his or her fathers clan. Tlingit kinship was "avuncu-Crow" with avunculocal residence; that of the Atna was "Iroquois," without fixed residence rules, although tending toward avunculocality (for definitions, see Murdock 1949:223-226, 243-248). Among both peoples, shamanism was apt to run in families and to be largely involuntary ("Siberian type"). Tlingit shamans were chosen by their spirit helpers, some of which were associated with certain clans. Among the Atna, "power" might come to any descendant of a shaman who dreamed òf him, although close relatives were favored. A number of Tlingit chiefs were also shamans, as were many influential Atna. Among both groups, the shaman never cut or combed his hair, which was considered the seat of power. Among both tribes, there were ordinary or layman cures for wounds, burns, and broken bones; home remedies for rheumatism, colds, and sore eyes; and midwives to aid in child- birth. The shaman was usually called in only to deal with serious cases, deep injuries, pro- found emotional disturbances, or deadly ill- ness. THE ATNA "DREAM DOCTOR" The Atna shaman or shaman -sorcerer was called te9taesen ("sleeper"), ke?de?dli'nen ("singer"), or more commonly gyénen/diyénen (not further analyzed), and "dream doctor" when speaking English, a usage followed here to emphasize his primary role as curer. The shaman acquired "power" (u-siha9, "his/her power") by dreaming of an ancestor in the act of shamanizing, and practiced by means of, or during, a dream or trancelike state. There were not as many women doctors as men, but they were said to be more powerful. Those named by our informants were chiefly men. Most Atna dream doctors seem to have acquired power late in life, for it was reported that "the most powerful doctor must be the one who has lived longer than most." Even young people, however, might begin to get some power by dreaming, but if it were unwanted or if the young person seemed likely to be- come "mean," the power could be removed by another shaman. Or, someone desiring power might go to the grave of a doctor-relative, hoping to dream of him. "When you dream," one Atna told us, "you make room for him. The dead doctor gets into you. Your former life is gone." "You wake up singing his song," another explained, "even if you never heard it before, and you act like him." To be effective, the dream had to be terrifying. The shaman- sorcerer never revealed the content of his dreams, but people recognized the old songs. In addition, the Atna doctor had to have repeated dreams that gave special knowledge, and hence special powers, for true knowledge was power, according to Atna belief. There- fore, the Atna doctor or shaman -sorcerer might dream about the spirit bosses (qasqaá, "chief") of the animals. If one dreamed of all six bosses of the moose, for example, one knew that animal and could control it. Or, one might dream repeatedly of some material</page><page sequence="5">88 Arctic Anthropology 24:1 thing, such as an ax, and so come to "know" it. Or, one might dream about the Copper River, and so be able to travel along one's own trail under it. If one dreamed of the whole world, one would be able to fly outside it and then in again. Many doctors dreamed of "Bush Indians" (k'iyu'y), manlike creatures that kidnapped children and young women lost in the woods in order to transform them into bloodless creatures like themselves. The doctor who dreamed of them acquired their surgical power. The shaman -sorcerer or doctor also dreamed of something that he wanted, a k'izé9 or "ritual gear." This might be a large boulder or even a railroad car, a cane decorated with ribbons, or a white cloth with a "map of the world" painted on it. These k'izé9 were the shaman- sorcerers T "magic tools," and symbolized the powers obtained in dreaming. Atna dream doctors were often jealous of each other and were very touchy. So, the k'izé9 of one might serve as a "watchman," to warn of danger from a rival. Or, the dream doctor might "shoot his k'izé9" into the body of another in order to kill him. The k'ize9 of two shaman -sorcerers would fight each other until one was subdued and his master died. The Atna dream doctor or shaman -sorcerer had many functions. Among these was his ability to entertain. Almost all seances in- volved an exciting and dramatic display of power, while the singing of the audience strengthened the shaman. The dream doctor also located game in time of starvation. One who had dreamed of, and therefore "knew," moose would dream again and "give" the ani- mal to the hunter, telling him where to find it. Some shamans might first show off by pulling up a whole moose head, horns and all, from the ground or a pile of snow, to "prove their power." Next day, the hunter would shoot the moose. Finally, the dream doctor engaged in curing. This was the function most often noted by the Atna. A doctor who had dreamed of water might "bless" a cupful and give it to the patient to drink. Another might wave his k'izé9 in the patient!s face, while the audience called "Help him! Help him!" A friend might bring the dream doctor a garment belonging to a sick person, on which the shaman would exercise his curative skills. Or, the shaman might visit the patient while both were sleeping. It was the doctor's own spirit-soul (yé'gi) that traveled and the pa- tient might see it in his dream. On waking, the doctor would foretell the patient Ts recovery or death. A person could become ill from losing his soul through fright. The specialist shaman- sorcerer would cover his own and the patient Ts head, and talk, "like praying," while the audience remained silent. The doctor would verbally (and inwardly?) retrace all the patientfs wanderings back to where he had lost his soul. Then the doctor would tell him what had caused his fright (e.g., seeing a bear or capsizing in a canoe). Having brought the cause of the terrifying experience to con- sciousness, the doctor would restore the soul by placing a hand on the patientTs head. Other dream doctors might specialize in serious wounds. A man cut his foot with an ax. The doctor who treated him had dreamed about the salmon that can ascend the river, though cut on the rocks; he had also dreamed about the ax. He, therefore, "knew" the ax, and that it was to cut wood, not flesh. So he "put the ax back in the wound," by licking and blowing on the blade and laying it on the foot, and then he stuck the ax into a block of wood. That night, in his dream, he dulled the blade so it could not hurt. Next morning the wound was closed and the foot was "only a little sore." A dream doctor could not cure a member of his own household because that person slept too close to him. But presumably he could do so if they were in different settlements or houses . There were some bad "sleep doctors," or at least some who killed people or sent bad luck (like an automobile accident), "just by thinking bad." These bad thoughts might work even when the shaman -sorcerer did not want the people to die. There were others, like Single- Eye of Gulkana, who could hurt people "just by looking around." He once visited Copper Center in his sleep, but a local doctor flashed a light in his eyes, blinding him, "so he didnft hurt anyone." Although the Atna denied that a shaman - sorcerer, or rather his spirit -soul, could appear in animal form, others said that some doctors could change into bears and come to bother people in their sleep. "Bear- walking" was presumably practiced by "bad doctors." A doctor, or his spirit- soul, might travel far while the shaman -sorcerer slept. Too often, the ye* gi would become hungry on its journey and eat a human soul, mistaking it for food. So, a doctor might agonize when he awoke, wondering whose sòul he might have devoured. A shaman -sorcerer sometimes acquired such a taste for souls that he consciously selected his victims. Thus, if a mysterious death occurred in one settlement, a doctor in another would be blamed. In retaliation, the doctor in the deceased's village might kill someone in the "bad doctor's" village by magic. Or, the two doctors might fight. The stronger might capture the ye' gi ot</page><page sequence="6">de Laguna: Atna and Tlingit Shamanism 89 spirit -soul of the weaker, display it as a little manikin, and possibly eat it. (It "tasted like fried chicken," the informant said.) The dream doctor who had killed someone was supposed to pay the victimfs relatives, otherwise they would try to kill him. He would give a potlatch and pay them in blankets. "Then everybody was happy," it was said. Sometimes doctors worked together, espe- cially if their powers came from the same prede- cessor or if they wanted to injure a foreign doctor. For example, the Atna say that all the Copper River doctors flew to Germany in 1918 and worked together to win the war by magically "poisoning" the Germans. The rewards for being an Atna shaman- sorcerer or dream doctor were minimal. Al- though he did not ask for pay, a grateful patient or lucky hunter would give something. One man told us that doctors did not have to hunt; people took care of them as if they were chiefs. If true, the shamanistic profes- sion might serve as a pension in old age. But people wanted to be doctors because they wanted to be "high." It was for prestige. Thus, Atna sorcery- shamanism seems to have been well developed, with some prac- titioners acquiring individual specialities. There were no witches, for although a few doctors might be termed "bad" or "mean," there is no evidence that any were regarded as inherently evil. THE TLINGIT SHAMAN Every Tlingit clan in every major village was supposed to have its own shaman (9íxíf), who might also be a clan or house chief, uniting supernatural power with economic and cere- monial leadership. He could hardly be classi- fied as a sorcerer according to Murdock!s criteria, since he injured only other shamans or enemies of his own people (see Fig. 1). The functions of the shaman were several (see also de Laguna 1972:701). He fought with the shaman of an enemy clan in war time, and furnished military intelligence to his own people, as reported by his spirits (ye'fc). He sent his spirits for news of absent friends and relatives, to find lost persons, and, if not too late, to restore to human form those who had been "captured" and transformed by Land Otter Men (creatures who were the equivalent of the Atna "Bush Indians"). He brought good weather, restored fish runs, announced the warnings of the spirit, and furnished amulets for good luck. He cured those suffering from aggression by evil spirits, and instructed others in the use of devilclub branches to ward off "disease spirits." Al- though the shaman had considerable medical and surgical knowledge, he personally under- took fewer and fewer cures during the later decades of the nineteenth century. His major function was to detect witches. There were very few women shamans among the Tlingit, but they were judged to be as powerful as their male colleagues. One even brought to life a youth who had died, and an- other prophesied the coming of the Russians. The power of a shaman depended entirely on the character and number of the spirits he or she could call. When a shaman died, his whole clan would assemble and call on his spirit helpers (ye'Jc) to select a new "master" (sa* ti). People shunned the grave, except for the successor who would take the professional "outfit" that was cached in the grave house where the shaman's uncremated body had been placed. When passing by in a canoe, people might throw some tobacco into the water as an offer- ing and pray to the dead shaman for wealth and long life. The novice selected by his predecessor's spirit helpers could not resist the call, upon pain of illness or death. The young person would begin to act queer and feel dizzy, espe- cially when one of the dead shaman's spirit songs was sung. The only cure was to become a shaman. This meant that the novice and his spouse and children had to adopt a very ardu- ous regimen involving eating and drinking and sexual relations, which continued after he had become a professional. The novice, or a mature shaman desiring more power, had to go into the woods, accom- panied by one or more experienced assistants (men of his own clan). Here, a spirit or yé'k would appear in the form of an animal that fell dead at his feet. The shaman would cut off a slice of its tongue, and this, to- gether with bits from other animals (teeth, claws, or skins), was put into a bundle of twigs. This bundle was like a medicine bag, to be worn by the shaman during a seance or touched to the body of the sick person in appropriate cases. The novice prayed to the dead animal for power and wealth. Most shamans "cut four tongues" on as many quests; but a very powerful one might reach the ultimate limit of "eight tongues," and so gain eight main spirits. The quest by the female novice and shaman was presumably similar, though we have no detailed informa- tion. All shamans seem to have acquired a Land Otter spirit helper; but there were many dif- ferent kinds of animals (Bear, Mosquito, Devil- fish, etc.), and these had no relation to the totemic crests of the shaman's clan. Some spirits of the sky and clouds, like the "Chil- dren of the Sun," seem not to have had ani- mal forms. Spirits were represented by anthropomorphic masks, donned at various</page><page sequence="7">90 Arctic Anthropology 24:1 Figure 1.

(From de Laguna 1972:pl. 65.)</page><page sequence="8">de Laguna: Atna and Tlingit Shamanism 91 stages of the séance. Masks representing animal spirits possessed identifying features, such as a sharp "nose" for the Mosquito!s proboscis. Some or all spirits had personal names; one of these might become the shamanTs professional name, by which he and his suc- cessors were known. Thus, at Dry Bay near Yakutat on the Gulf Coast of Alaska, there were a series of powerful "Wolf- Weasels" in the same clan. (For spirits and masks, see de Laguna 1972:690-692.) When the shaman summoned his spirits, he donned a special costume for each, and would sing and speak in yé'k language while possessed. His prophecies were delivered in riddlelike utterances. The assistant who accompanied the shaman on the spirit quest and beat the drum at seances might also obtain some power. Some assistants could remove intrusive "objects" or spiritual essences of things. These were con- tracted by approaching or handling a shaman's things, from which some entity had entered the layman1 s body. Women from a different clan were especially vulnerable. The intru- sion manifested itself in a vague, diffuse dis- comfort, but the "hidden, unseen thing," some- times conceived as alive, could be removed by a shaman or his assistant without leaving a scar. Tlingit shamans were very touchy and jeal- ous of each other, like their Atna colleagues. Sometimes the major spirit (yé'k) of one shaman might tell his master to "kill" another shaman, so that the spirit could "eat" the victimfs "fat." Then, as the other shaman wasted away and died, the spirit of the first waxed fat as did, supposedly, his master. The dead shaman1 s spirit would then enter his new master and give him four songs. To guard against such attacks, a shaman had special spirits as watchmen (see de Laguna 1972:707; Olson 1961:208, 212-214). Tlingit shamanism brought not only power and prestige but material wealth as well. Unlike the Atna shaman, his Tlingit counter- part had to be paid before attempting a séance, for his spirits would not render ser- vice without pay. Shamans, like lay persons, strove to accumulate wealth (ultimately to be given away in potlatches) , and many of the taboos observed by the shaman, such as that against eating "beach food" (easily obtained clams, seaweed, etc.), were like those of the ordinary Tlingit. They were designed to bring and keep wealth, except that the shamanfs observances were more severe. THE TLINGIT WITCH The origin of witchcraft is variously ascribed by the Tlingit to the Haida or Tsimshian, or to the teachings of Raven (Krause 1956:200), but there is general agree- ment that all witches came from the first. Emmons (n.d.) was told that this first witch was a man who not only excessively craved magic power (even a shaman had to be moder- ate) in order to punish his faithless wife, but sought it through improper means by drinking from a shamanTs skull. Once introduced into the world, witchcraft became a malignancy that grew of itself. But the witch was some- thing other than an unscrupulous shaman. The power of the witch to harm was due to possession of a "witch spirit." According to Emmons (n.d.), this spirit was not born in one, nor did it come of its own accord, but rather it had to be sought through repeated vigils in the graveyard while handling human remains. On the other hand, Olson (1967:116) was told that witches go to the graveyard be- cause "they are impelled by a 'feeling1 or spirit within them," and that witchcraft was "inherited in the same way as hereditary traits." My information would indicate that witchcraft was passed on, like an infection, from person to person (most likely in the same family), and that the power and compulsion to harm was due to the witch spirit. The Tlingit called the witch, nú#kw s'a'tí or ní'k* s'a'tí, "master of pain" or "master of sickness." The common designation, na'kw s'a'tí or "master of medicine," is, I believe, a euphemism. The witch spirit is hí' x , not yé'k, the spirit of the shaman (?ixf). The witch could be male or female, and, consumed by hatred and envy, killed or harmed personal enemies by making little dolls in their likenesses from bits of the victims1 clothing, hair, and food leavings (i.e., "witches1 dirt"). These dolls would be put into a grave, and while they rotted with the corpse, the victims sickened. The witch could bewitch others by touching them with a dead dog or dog skin. People so bewitched were then forced to do the witchfs bidding and collect "witches' dirt" for making dolls. An unwilling assistant might escape by "confessing to the bushes" (immediately declaring out-of-doors that he or she did not want to become a witch). The strong-willed and virtuous were deemed too "solid" to be affected. Some bewitched persons might com- mit suicide, but those who served the witch became witches themselves. In cases of illness that did not yield to ordinary remedies, especially if the patient were a member of the aristocracy, witchcraft was suspected. Traditionally, the witch be- longed to the same lineage and clan as the victim. It might be the younger brother of a chief who coveted his older brothers position, or a poor hunter who wanted to "get even with" a brother who always got valuable pelts.</page><page sequence="9">92 Arctic Anthropology 24:1 In most cases, however, the accused witch was a helpless member of the lowest social standing. One who had recourse to overt violence in quarrels was not suspected; an aristocrat sus- pected of witchcraft could usually avoid accu- sation and punishment. To detect the witch, a shaman from another clan, preferably from another place, would be called in. With the aid of his spirits, the shaman would point out the witch and often the latter?s bewitched spouse or child or other assistant as well. Then the witch would be tied up- hair, wrists, and ankles drawn pain- fully tight behind the back- and left without food and water to extract a confession. Con- fession without suffering was believed ineffec- tive, since only torture could break off the eight invisible "shells" that covered the witch. After confessing, the witch could cure the victim by removing the doll from the grave and plunging with it into salt water, where both were washed clean. But a witch could never cure anyone who had spoken for him or defended him at his trial. Since no one could be sure that the witch had not also put his image in the grave, this belief insured una- nimity in the clan. Some alleged witches would refuse to confess and so died. If the patient succumbed before the witch had con- fessed, the latter was made to suffer a linger- ing death. Anyone found in the graveyard after a recent death might be shot on sight as a witch. Even the children of a female witch might be killed, if she did not confess. Al- though the forced confession and washing might save the life of a witch, it did not re- move the taint, and the stigma of having a witch or bewitched person as an ancestor or close relative could never be wiped out. A Tlingit witch could change shape to be- come an animal or bird. The witch could fly or bound lightly with enormous airy strides or climb a post by hoisting himself with his tongue. A witch could shrink to pass through a tiny hole into a grave. The newly bewitched and the hardened witch had a compulsion to visit the cemetery, often staying all night, where they had sexual relations with the spirits of the dead (Olson 1961, 1967:115-117). The witch was shameless and under compulsion to perform such shameful acts as lying, steal- ing, and committing adultery. Even speech between grown brother and sister marked the witch . Since the first quarter of this century, witchcraft accusations have been directed at persons in the village other than the patientsf clanmates. This probably reflects more dif- fuse anxiety or suppressed animosity than does suspicion of a relative. Since cremation was replaced by inhumation in the last decades of the nineteenth century, witches have had access to more corpses, it is said, and the shamans have had to deal with more cases of witchcraft. DISCUSSION The Atna shaman -sorcerer functioned to relieve personal anxiety and strain, which often manifested itself in illness. That strain existed is evidenced by the elaborate system of avoidance between close relatives. Even siblings of the same sex had to be guarded in their mutual relations, the younger speak- ing only to answer the elder, except in emer- gencies. Furthermore, the family group might spend months isolated in their camps. Unhappy wives, far from their parentsT home, are known to have strangled themselves. Another important function of the dream doctor was to find game and fur-bearing ani- mals. Starvation was feared and is known to have killed many. Animals were treated with great respect. They were apt to be desig- nated by circumlocutions rather than their "real names," especially if they had valuable pelts, and their remains were removed from possible contamination. Fear of starvation was manifested in cannibalistic fantasies, for example, in the belief that dream doctors ate human souls. Even though there were "bad" dream doc- tors, there seem to have been none that were inherently evil, like witches, although as sorcerer- shamans grew older and perhaps cranky (for the Atna say that old people get "mean"), some may have been suspected of killing more than curing. Still, we cannot call them "witches," as defined by Murdock, even though there are some elements in Atna belief that suggest traditional witchcraft ("thinking bad," hurting others "just by look- ing around," and the compulsion to "eat" souls). These instances were rare and would be (in theory) compatible with the tendencies in a few cases to establish an aristocracy of chiefs and their immediate families. Tlingit shamanism must have resembled Atna shamanism more closely in precontact days, when most illnesses were due to injuries or nonfatal ailments like arthritis, or were emotional disturbances due to stress, which shamanism was well fitted to alleviate. When smallpox was first introduced to the Tlingit in 1775, and when it reached epidemic propor- tions in 1836-1839 and again in 1862, the Tlingit ascribed it to "disease spirits" who rode from village to village in canoes through the air (together with the ghosts of those who had died from the disease) and "shot" invisible weapons into their victims. The shamans would tell the people to put the spiny stems of devil- clubs around doors and windows to keep out these spirits, and would themselves attempt</page><page sequence="10">de Laguna: Atna and Tlingit Shamanism 93 to cure those shot by the invisible weapons of the disease spirits. They failed, of course, and lost prestige when vaccination by the Rus- sians saved those who had accepted it. These major epidemics were followed by others of in- troduced infectious diseases. As the people began to rely more and more upon the white manTs drugs and medicines, especially after the purchase of Alaska (1867), the shamans withdrew gradually from attempting to cure such illnesses. But in the last decades of the nineteenth century, tuberculosis became prac- tically endemic. Incurable by any remedies then available, this mysterious and fatal wast- ing disease was ascribed to witchcraft. It was then that the Tlingit shamans conducted so many witchcraft trials, until finally the Ameri- can authorities suppressed the practice, leav- ing the people with witchcraft fears but little to alleviate them. Their shamans were per- haps left only with emotional disturbances and rheumatism to treat. Personal anxiety among the Tlingit was ex- pressed in the vague unease or shifting pains ascribed to immaterial intrusions which shamans could remove. Fear of this ailment kept the layman away from the shamanTs secret cache. (Other "intrusions" were tumors, to be re- moved in the hospital!) The belief that sha- mans and their spirits could feast on the fat of rivals may reflect the strain of observing the rigorous self-imposed food taboos, en- joined on all at times but especially on shamans. Murdochs correlations between social con- ditions and the presence or absence of witch- craft beliefs in illness seem to be supported by the Atna and Tlingit examples. Among the latter, we have a social order based on dis- tinctions of inherited status, wealth, and power, with polygyny, bride-price, and avun- culocal (if not patrilocal) residence, and witches. But the latter do not completely fit Murdock!s definition for they are reported to have used the techniques of contagious black magic characteristic of sorcerers, even though they also needed the power of the witch spirits. And, although inherently evil, as practicing witches, performing anti- social and loathesome acts under the compul- sion of those spirits, they were apparently innocent, if vulnerable, before bewitchment (recruitment) by a witch. Later, they could be redeemed through torture, confession, and washing as they undid their evil work. While comparison of the Atna and Tlingit suggests that there may be similar differences between interior and coastal groups in northwestern America with respect to social conditions and beliefs in the supernatural causation of ill- ness, this needs investigation. Murdock did not claim that witchcraft beliefs were caused by certain social situations, but only that the latter were favorable to their adoption. And, we may also investigate to what extent his categories seem to fit or are useful. In Murdochs sample of 27 North American tribes, shown somewhat rearranged in Table 1, he found that only the Haida, Micmac, Co- manche, Havasupai, Aztec, and Popoluca ascribed illness to witchcraft. The Iroquois, Navajo, Hopi, and Rio Grande Pueblos could surely be added to this list, but even these (and possibly other valid) additions would still show a spotty distribution, only in part conforming to culture areas. Witchcraft be- liefs, therefore, do not appear indigenous, and Murdock (1980:58) believed that "a sub- stantial portion of the scattered occurrences of witchcraft theories outside the Circum- Mediterranean region are reported for socie- ties that have been conquered or colonized by peoples from the core area, for example the Spaniards, from whom they are quite likely to have borrowed the complex." American Indian witchcraft beliefs would ap- pear to be due to European influences, from the Spanish in the Southwest and Mexico and probably from the French (and English?) in the Northeast. For the Northwest Coast, we can eliminate the Spanish, for if they had been responsible we should expect such be- liefs to be most clearly and strongly developed among the Nootka, among whom the Spanish had a temporary settlement. However, this is not the case, as we shall see. Sometimes, it may be difficult to distinguish between sorcery and witchcraft, as is the case with the Chiricahua Apache whom Murdock cited (see Table 1) for belief in sorcery, not witch- craft, as causing illness, although they called the practitioner a "witch" (see Opler 1941:242- 257, Murdock* s principal source). The Apache believed that his (or her) supernatural power could be used for either good or evil. While some used it only for evil, any shaman might be suspected of practicing such black magic. Even one noted for his many cures might be forced by his "power" to sacrifice the life of a close relative to save his own. Some of the reputed techniques and characteristics of the sorcerer suggest those of the classic witch: shooting an "arrow" of human bone into his victim, so deadly that a shaman would not dare to extract it, and harming another through a glance, thoughts, or spoken words. He "hated to see people happy," and frequented graveyards. Incest and shameless nudity, even a special odor, marked the "witch." And the punishment was to hang the suspect from a tree by the wrists and there to burn the "witch" alive. Apache fear of the dead might have inhibited cremation of a corpse, but it was presumably Spanish influence that prescribed destruction by fire. Was the sus- pect witch or sorcerer?

SORCERY AND WITCHCRAFT ON THE NORTHWEST COAST To information about illness and curing which Drucker (1950) published in his Culture Element Survey, I have added data from the Eyak (E), Tlingit (Tl), Haida (H), Tsimshian (Ts), Bella Coola (BC), Kwakiutl (Kw) and Nootka (N) from the sources listed on Table 2 and in the bibliography (Boas 1916; Garfield 1939, 1951; Miller 1984; Murdock 1934; Smith 1925; Swanton 1909). I have attempted to apply the terms "sorcerer" and "witch" as de- fined by Murdock (see Table 2). All of these Northwest Coast tribes (Fig. 2) attributed illness to soul loss, usually caused by fright (TI, H, Ts, BC, Kw), by theft by a witch (E, Ts), or by a shaman- sorcerer or a spirit (N). But there were shamans in all tribes who could restore lost souls. All tribes ascribed illness to intrusive objects (or animalcula) from a natural source (Tl: from a shaman!s grave or outfit), and among all tribes a shaman could remove it. Illness might be caused by an intrusive or aggressive spirit (Tl, BC, Kw, N), but the shaman could deal with it. Some shaman -sorcerers had special "throwing power" to send disease into their victims (BC, Kw, N), and also the power to remove it. Among the Eyak, Tlingit, Haida, and Tsimshian, the practitioners of contagious magic were witches, called by terms distinct from those used for shamans. Among the Bella Coola, Kwakiutl, and Nootka, they were sorcerers (shaman- sorcerers), and there were io distinctive native names for these practi- ioners except as derived from the kind of )lack magic they practiced (Kw, N). Witches and sorcerers caused illness or</page><page sequence="13">96 Arctic Anthropology 24:1 death by taking something intimate of the victim: nails, hair, excreta, breath, soiled clothing, or food leavings. Among all tribes, these were put with human remains (corpse, piece of flesh, bone), and were also heated (Be, Kw), or they were placed with a dead dog (E, TI), in contact with menstrual blood (E), in the mouth of a live toad (BC, Kw), or with unspecified "evil things" (N). As these rotted, so did the victim sicken and die. Assistants who col- lected such intimate personal remains ("witches1 dirt") were the bewitched relatives or friends of the witch, destined to become witches them- selves (T), relatives and children of the shaman-sorcerer (BC), or "secret men", ac- complices of the shaman- sorcerer (Kw). The witch (Tl, Ts) and the sorcerer (BC, N) might also kill with "poison" in food or drink. The Haida witch might use the Evil Eye. Power came from human remains (E, TI, H, Ts), the sorcerer- shaman using his victim!s corpse as protection against his ghost and making "poison" from human fat (BC). The "throwing shaman" -sorcerer prayed to the dead for power (Kw). The witch obtained power from a dead dog (E, TI), or from the live mice in his body (H). According to the Eyak, Tlingit, Haida, and Tsimshian, witches were inherently evil, and under compulsion to use power for harm. This propensity was inherited, so one had to kill all the descendants of a Tlingit witch to eradicate the taint. Among the Bella Coola, Kwakiutl, and Nootka, it was generally be- lieved that the ability to kill by contagious magic was learned, though one Kwakiutl man "dreamed" it, and the Nootka also ascribed it to encounters with evil supernaturals or to failure to dominate the supernatural. In all tribes, practitioners of contagious magic worked in secret. Witches tried to hide their identities (E, TI, H, Ts). Tsimshian witches wore masks when distribut- ing corpse parts, and would either kill or turn into a witch anyone who might discover them. The "killing shaman" (sorcerer- shaman) was the policeman for the Bella Coola secret society and the assistant of the Kwakiutl chief. Their identities were known. But the sorcerer- shamans who killed to excess, for personal reasons, tried to keep their identities unknown by wearing masks (BC) or by trying to buy silence or recruiting anyone who dis- covered them (BC, Kw). Rarely, a sorcerer might boast of his killings (BC, N). The identity of the witch or sorcerer responsible for an illness was discovered by the shaman through his spirits (T, H, Ts), by the victim in a dream (E, TI) or when dying (N), by watchers at the graveside (T, Ts, BC), or by gazing into water (E). (The Tlingit shaman also used various water tests; the Haida might interrogate a mouse.) The only cure for illness caused by conta- gious magic was to undo the spell. Usually this could be done only by the one who had made it. As already explained, the Tlingit witch was forced, through torture, to confess, retrieve the doll representing the victim, and to wash himself and the doll. The mouse or mice controlling the Haida witch had to be ex- pelled from his body through torture or drown- ing by the rising tide; the Tlingit witch might be drowned this way. The Tsimshian shaman, however, could counter the black magic if he were more powerful than the witch. If found, the witch /sorcery bundle would be washed or thrown in the sea (Ts, BC, Kw). Contagious magic could be countered by reversing or re- peating the procedure (BC, Kw). A shaman with knowledge of sorcery could undo the magic of a weaker sorcerer or could force him to undo his magic (N). Witches were compelled to practice black magic because of their own evil nature, and also because of their jealousy, spite, and "touchiness" (E, TI, H, Ts). Sorcerer- shamans felt some compulsion to exercise their supernatural killing power, and if done at the bidding of a chief or secret society, this was legitimate (BC, Kw, N). To kill to excess (BC, N), from personal spite (Kw?), for pay (Kw), or to earn the curer!s fee (BC, N), was morally condemned. Witches (E, TI, H, Ts) were violently loathed, as were some sorcerers (BC), and brought dis- grace to their relatives and descendants. Although Murdock confined his analysis to theories of illness, we should note that the Eyak and Tlingit witches could fly or move miraculously, change size, or assume the form of animal or bird. CONCLUSION Data from the Northwest Coast indicate that belief in witchcraft was most highly developed among the Tlingit, with specific details shared by the Eyak and northern Haida. Unfortu- nately, the natives* fear of witches or of appearing to know too much about witchcraft has hampered ethnographers among the Tsimshian and perhaps among the Haida also. Similar fears were encountered by Drucker when he attempted to learn about black magic among the Nootka. But even if we make al- lowance for scantiness of data from these areas, Tlingit witchcraft is striking. The Tlingit seem to represent a center from which such ideas and associated practices spread to other coastal tribes, where they were added to a common, underlying system of sorcery. The rich data from the Bella Coola reported by Meli wraith (1948) suggest that the sorcerers</page><page sequence="14">de Laguna: Atna and Tlingit Shamanism 97 were becoming witches, and some had achieved that transformation into inherently loathesome, evil persons, whose children had to be killed to eradicate witchcraft. The northwest interi- or tribes and those farther south on the coast were barely affected, if at all, by such witch- craft beliefs. Why these witchcraft beliefs were not adopted by the Kwakiutl and Nootka may have been a function of time or of other circum- stances. Thus, the Nootka put more emphasis on the careful performance of ritual than on help from a supernatural, while the latter was stressed by the Kwakiutl. Nootkan bathing rituals were elaborated into the establishment of shrines where corpses were used by the ritualist because the dead were believed to have the power to call dead whales and salmon runs. The late Philip Drucker referred to this as "witching" the whales. These shrines remind one of the "witching places" described by George Hunt to Franz Boas (1966:279-282). The Inland Tlingit shared many specific witchcraft beliefs with their coastal relatives, as did the Tagish (who abandoned the Atha- paskan language for Tlingit in the nineteenth century). The nearby Southern Tutchone de- nied that they had witches, except for a few among bands most closely associated with the Chilkat Tlingit. All groups feared witchcraft, but the Tagish and Inland Tlingit were more afraid of being bewitched unknowingly and thus forced against their will to injure their closest relatives (McClellan 1975:329-365). When Murdock (1980:25) indicated that the Kaska lacked belief in witches, he was refer- ring to "aboriginal" conditions. Honigmann (1947, 1970) described Kaska witch fears and witch hunts of 1900-1926 and argued that such ideas spread from the Tlingit, by way of the Tahltan, to the western Kaska about 1897. The Indians of the Pelly and Little Salmon Rivers were also briefly affected, but not the Slave, Carrier, or Sekani. The Kaska mani- festations of Tlingit practice were limited to the tying up and torturing of children or youths by their own parents to force confes- sions, or to killing them as witches. These acts were to avenge a death in the family, not to seek a cure for illness. Tahltan be- liefs and practices (Emmons 1911:113-114) more closely resembled those of the Tlingit. I suspect that these interior copies of Tlingit belief and practice were all adopted rather late in the nineteenth century, accom- panying the disruption of native life caused by the influx of white traders and prospectors and the contagious diseases brought with them. The coastal tribes, as earlier purveyors of trade goods to the interior, would have opened the way for the importation of ideas. If my impression that the Tlingit repre- sented a center of witchcraft beliefs on the Northwest Coast is correct, then it is likely that the source of these beliefs was the Rus- sians. That there were similarities between Tlingit and Russian notions is attested by VeniaminovTs detailed account of the alleged powers of the Tlingit "sorcerers" (kolduny, Russian plural, a term for any practitioner of black magic), and his statement that: "The same marvels are related hereabouts of the sorcerers as we tell about the witches of Kiev" (1984:418). The context of this statement and the use of Tlingit designations make clear that Veniaminov was referring to the Tlingit witch, not the shaman. According to Zguta (1977, 1978), the Russians of the fifteenth, sixteenth, seventeenth, and even eighteenth centuries did not make clear distinctions be- tween the different kinds of magical prac- titioners, but credited them with "a broad range of occult practices including magic, spell-casting, fortune-telling, divination, dream interpretation, weather manipulation, and herb medicine. Basically, however, in the eyes of the people a witch was a person of either sex who could mysteriously injure another" (Zguta 1977:1188). unlike contem- porary beliefs common in Western Europe, those of Russia (Muskovite and Ukrainian) did not include a pact with the Devil or worship of Satan, but were based on pagan notions that some persons might possess the power to control nature (drought and rain) and human ills. This they were supposed to accomplish through spells, talismans, potions, and conta- gious magic. Thus, the following allegations (Zguta 1977, 1978) were made at trials (al- though the list is obviously incomplete): start- ing a conflagration by soaking human hearts in water and sprinkling them on Moscow streets, poisoning a drink with grave dirt, and causing illness by magic over an article of clothing or earth from the victim's footprints or by strew- ing ashes or salt over the footprints. The witch or sorcerer might have rats and mice as "familiars," and might appear in the dream or vision of his or her victim. Ever since the eleventh century, and especially during the witch scares of the seventeenth, Russian ecclesiastical and later civil courts tested the guilt or innocence of women accused of witch- craft by throwing them bound into the water. Those who floated were deemed guilty and burned at the stake. This terrible punishment was inflicted even in the early eighteenth century, and in the area of Kiev the "swimming" test was commonly applied well into the nine- teenth (Zguta 1977:1190). Possession of herbs, roots, potions, or written incantations were evidence of guilt; less common than in Western Europe was reliance on "anger followed by mis- chief" (Zguta 1977:1199). The accused were tortured to force confessions and disclosure of confederates.</page><page sequence="15">98 Arctic Anthropology 24:1 I do not propose that a Russian system of beliefs in the supernatural and in maleficent magic was exported wholesale to the Tlingit, but I do suggest that certain items or notions might have been diffused. Zguta (1978:439), who has explored popular Russian beliefs of the seventeenth century, reported that: "The magical causes of disease were believed to be demonic possession, displeasure of the gods, the evil eye, and most frequently, malefic witchcraft, or porcha [occult harm, malefi- cium]." Professional healers could divine the cause or the author of the illness by magical techniques, including gazing into water, ashes, or a mirror. Cures were at- tempted through magical rites, accompanied by all-important incantations. The latter were closely guarded family secrets, and included spells to harm as well as to heal. A potent and popular cure was to bathe in a lake or river during a thunderstorm on the first day after a new moon. Other methods might in- volve the expulsion of disease demons by noise, exorcism, fumigation, sucking, burning a lock of the patient's hair, wrapping him in a fresh hide, or passing him through the cleft of a tree (as the Tlingit patient might step through a ring of devilclubs?; see de Laguna 1972:708). Magic rites accompanying incanta- tions were to wash away, lick off, gnaw off, squeeze out, or bite out the illness (a physi- cal object), or to transfer it to some object and then destroy that object. The healer, if unsuccessful, was himself or herself apt to be accused of witchcraft, for "there was only a fine line between witchcraft and medicine in pre-Petrine Russia" (Zguta 1978:448). Some of these magical beliefs and practices survived into the early nineteenth century. This is shown by the evidence given in the ecclesiastical trial for sorcery of a Tlingit lay cleric at Sitka in 1829 (Manzel 1951). The accused was convicted of assisting two shamans in an attempted cure that included burning some of the patient's hair and toenail parings, an act which Manzel (1951:16-17) correctly points out was not Tlingit practice, but which we have seen was a Russian magical cure (Zguta 1978:443). Some similarities between Russian and Tlingit methods of detecting witches and un- doing their evil involve the use of water (see also practices of the Eyak and Haida). The Haida also feared the Evil Eye, and "swam" witches, like the Russians. My suggestion is, therefore, that some Russian beliefs and prac- tices associated with black magic were intro- duced to the Tlingit (and Eyak). From them, they spread to other tribes among whom condi- tions were ripe for their acceptance, and where they were, to varying extents, added to or assimilated into the older aboriginal sys- tems of sorcery. Although I have found Murdochs distinctions between witchcraft and sorcery helpful in pointing out features for analysis, I do not now feel that they are com- pletely adequate for categorizing what appear to be the richly blended beliefs on the North- west Coast. I am not familiar with what magi- cal notions the Russian clergy, officials, hunt- ers, and laborers might have brought to Alaska, and I do not know how these should best be classified. But I do suggest that these are matters for further investigation if we are to understand native witchcraft and sorcery in northwestern North America. Acknowledgements.
