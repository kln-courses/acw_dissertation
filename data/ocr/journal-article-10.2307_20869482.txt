Submitted: 30 March 2009 Abstract This paper looks at electronic art as a new form, suggesting the term 'faciality'. It is not simply for re-staging the invisible using the visible, but for provoking a fresh view on the discussion of electronic art in terms of reconsidering ideas and concepts of art and technology. In Alice's Adventure in Wonderland, the Cheshire Cat remains only a grin without body or presence [1]. As Alice felt, this curious experience seems practically impossible. However, when so many out-of-the-ordinary things happen frequently, it can be natural to think that a very few things are really possible [2]. While our world is not Wonderland, technology can dare to be the most sensible answer for the question of the possible impossibilities in our reality. As Arthur C. Clarke insists, "Any sufficiently advanced technology is impossible to distinguish from magic" [3]. Usually, the magic shows the visible, which conceals the invisible. The experience of the invisible that overwhelms the visible bestows on us the sense of the impossible. And this magical moment, not the magic itself, is the ultimate purpose of the technology mediated experience. In a sense, the experience of electronic art can be indistinguishable from magical experience. In the experience of electronic art, it becomes more and more infeasible to recognize what is visible, invisible, possible or impossible. Thus the aesthetic experience seems to become the grin of the Cheshire Cat. This paper aims to trigger a new insight for the discourse on electronic art as a new art form, suggesting a term, 'faciality.' It is not simply for re-staging the invisible with the visible, but for provoking a fresh view in the discussion of electronic art in terms of reconsider ing ideas and concepts of art and technology. The Experience The chronicle of the electronic arts is the record of the assemblages of artistic will and electronic expression. In the process, it is found that the artistic material has gone beyond our perception and furthermore beyond the traditional concept of aesthetic object and experience. The computing machinery is the most remarkable among those imperceptible materials. Even though many problems and questions about the relationship between the produced electronic artwork and the audience, or the system and the user, still remain, there is an essentially componential and prominent proof that the audience should be included in the aesthetic object and experience. The experience of electronic art is the combination of the visible and the invisible. This dichotomy usually does not fall under the discussion about the matters of electronics, for example, hardware and software, or coding and application, etc. Frequently we notice that many people talk about how the system is implemented, what the newness inside the system is, etc. The discourse on the experience of the visible/invisible, however, requires an insight different from the machinic traits and its consequences for discussing the new aesthetic object and its experience. The invisible in electronic art is not the wi-fi networks or the hidden circuits. Rather, the invisible is the signification system. Electronic art converts the exterior world into its own invisible signification system as an aesthetic object. And this aesthetic object completes its signification process with the mediation of experience. Redundancy The isolated signification system has an open structure that it is full of redundancy which awaits the subject's participation. Without an audience, electronic art is a meaningless signification system. This redundancy implies not meaninglessness but the possibility of myriad meaning. Meaning in electronic art can be easily fixated by the relation of the signifier and the signified. It is regarded that there is an apparent causality in the fixation of meaning in electronic art. The machinic aspects such as algorithms, database, interfaces etc. give strong conviction for this causality. The structure of signs, however, shows us that "the limitless ness of significance (signifiers) replaces the signs" [4]. Simply put, the lack of necessity in the system of signification reveals the lack of causality and fixation in the signification process of electronic art, for there is no innate causality of fixated meaning in electronic art; each artwork becomes a redundant signification structure. Redundancy in electronic art, however, is not meaningful before the audience's perception of the artwork. At this stage the artwork is nothing more than a redundant object that has nothing to do with the individual subjects, the audiences. The way we relate to the electronic artwork is definitely dependent on the subject's perception. Through the subject's perception, the signification system becomes meaningful for each audience. Without the subject and his/her perception, the electronic artwork is just a marooned signification system. By the subject's intervention, the redundancy of electronic art begins to be re-organized as a signifying system. As an independent signification system, both the audience and electronic art regenerate the invisible signification system. Thus, the audience's experience is equal to the encounter of two isolated signification systems. And this confrontation reassembles the structure of signs inside electronic art. The visible interaction between the audience and the electronic artwork is the correlative regeneration of two invisible signification structures. Faciality Faciality, the Deleuzian concept of the signifying process, is the assemblage of the visible that conceals the invisible [5]. The viewer disassembles the invisible signified and then reassembles it according to the viewer's signification structure. The viewer accumulates this combination of assemblage and dis assemblage until s/he stops viewing. Consequently, faciality is the viewer's impression that results from the mutual re-assemblage of invisible signification systems. What we call a 'face' in ordinary life is the anthropomorphic result of faciality. When we see someone's face, even in a very ordinary situation, the signifier is not the organs such as nose, eyes or mouth. Behind those visible organs, there is the faciality that organizes those organs and signifies the invisible signification structure. Usually, we think meaning is transferred by the face. Meaning, however, is beyond the facial organs. Rather, meaning is transmitted by the faciality which leads the viewer to the invisible signification system of his/her own (the viewee). 288 LEONARDO, Vol. 44, No. 3, pp. 288-289,2011 ?2011 ISAST</page><page sequence="2">In Wonderland, the Cheshire Cat's grin is the faciality that leads Alice to the invisible signification system of Cheshire Cat and Wonderland. As a structure, Wonderland is the eternal recurrence of signifiers. Without faciality, there exists only the redundancy of signifiers. That is, Wonderland and Cheshire Cat cannot express themselves without visible substances. These substances don't need to be the apparent face with facial organs. Only the facial expression is required. That is why Alice sees the Cheshire Cat's grin with no presence of facial organs. Also the audience of electronic art can communicate with the invisible signification structure through the experience. The electronic artwork never makes its entire signification system visible and meaningful by itself. Preferably the electronic art has to include the audiences (viewer) for the completion of its signification process. Through faciality, audiences can access the invisible aspects of electronic art and reassemble the innate signification system of electronic art. Throughout this process, the redundant signification system of electronic art becomes the invisible expression to the audience. Grins of Electronic Art In 2007, for the exhibition "How to see the beauty that is not there," I introduced an electronic art work, Dis-cryption [6]. In this artwork, the movie Waiting for Godot is transformed into black-and white ASCII art [7]. Every colored pixel in each frame is replaced by selected alphabet characters. And these characters are subtracted from Samuel Beckett's original script. As a result, in each scene the audience watches the moving alphabetic codes which derived from the character's name, speeches and directions in Beckett's script [8]. In this artwork, as an artist, I wanted to disrobe the visible possibilities of expressive images. For me, the image is the compulsory medium that forces audiences to conceive the habitual impression. Replacing the image with alphabetical characters was intended to peel off the expressiveness of images. On the contrary, I juxtaposed the sounds from the original film with the ASCII based images. So, it became nearly impossible to recognize the visual depictions in the original film. I wanted to push the habitual images to an area of the unrecognizable. At the same time, I hoped that the audiences it ill if|, M*HH&lt; 111II Ml i**#I MIa * : s a a a a a a 8 i aaaa?aaa a a a a a aan aaaaaaaa i a a a a a a a a &lt; aaassdiii saaaaaasi \ sa 84 1 a a aj aaaaaaaai aaaaaaaai aaaaaaaas - i (&lt; t MM :0 4-4 4-*4i&amp;# rliilllllli I'M i IMHii i ? a a a a a a * # I 1.4 i M *1 illsiista | .# l?., | a aaMaa : ! il0811a| It* ? ii ioaa Fig. 1.

So I expressed the primitive and machinic aspects of the film Waiting for Godot. That is why I chose ASCII code, the original play of the movie and algorithmic approaches to the visible images. Although the descriptive elements were minimized, the audience could recognize what was happening in the artwork and perceive the faces and characters though the space in which there were no more images. I believe this impossible possibility could be accomplished by a junction of the audience and the signification system which was visualized by the computing machinery. The invisible aspect of the artwork is visualized by its faciality, which can be catalyzed by the audience's participation. Conclusion As in Wonderland, Dis-cryption expresses itself with the Cheshire Cat's grin. Any expression of the hidden signification system produces faciality. Due to the pure redundancy of the signification system, the whole cannot be made visible. There is no way to pause the recurrent signification system without the intervention of the audience. Only the viewer can interrupt the recurrence and then can make a temporal state of the signification system visible. And this invisibility hides itself behind the visible faciality. As Paul Klee said, "Not to render the visible, but to render visible," art makes the invisible visible [9]. Electronic art not only represents the visible, as art does. Rather it expresses the invisible in a visible way that is accompanied with machinic traits and its consequences. And this visible expression is derived from the audience's intervention during the aesthetic experience. To the extent that only visible faciality remains, the aesthetic experience in electronic art is very close to Alice's experience of the Cheshire Cat's grin. As the grin is the result of Alice's intervention in the signification system of the Cheshire Cat and Wonderland, the experience of electronic art is the visualization of the invisible signification structure. For both Alice and the audience of electronic art, it is faciality that those experiences are mediated by. Acknowledgments This work was supported by the Soongsil University Research Fund.
