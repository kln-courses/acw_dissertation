The general uncertainty regarding moral convictions and spiritual beliefs is reflected in psychiatric case work. In a large number of cases this uncer- tainty adds to, or is even at the core of a patient's problems and conflicts. The statements made below are based on a research study in progress on the material of 125 psychotherapy cases, fifty-seven men and sixty-eight women. These cases are a fair representation of all possible social, economic, educational, religious, and many characteristically American backgrounds and traditions. In religious edu- cation, the cases range from the most strict to extremely liberal upbringing. They also show diversity in the degree of their identification with, or opposition to, the moral and spiritual atmosphere in which they were raised. In an over-all survey we can distinguish about five different attitudes : ( 1 ) There are those who cling to, and are satisfied with the moral and religious traditions in which they were reared. (2) There are those who feel they want to belong to a definite church, whether that of their parents or another, but who sway in their convictions and are defensive or apologetic about them. ( 3 ) There are those who renounce belonging to any church or religious group and who live according to certain personal moral convictions. (4) There are those who grope for new standards, new spiritual enlightenment. (5) Finally, there are those who live from day to day and do not care. In the main, the psychiatric material seen by this author falls in the three middle groups: those who live in moral and spiritual insecurity, but who long for some- thing in which to believe and by which to be guided. The following are examples of how people actually feel about these problems: Helen, a twenty-six year old secretary and housewife, is representative of the first group. She says: "Like my parents, I belong to the First Christian Church. I get consolation from my religion. I was always religious, quite on my own. My parents did not press it at all. I had so much enjoy- ment from the social life of my church group. I also sang in the choir." Helen is a worrier. She worries constantly over doing the right thing. Her husband, who caused her much grief by "stepping out" on her, respects her religious beliefs and joins her in going to church on Sundays, although he himself feels "muddled" about religion. Natasha, like many Catholics, receives from her religion spiritual support and consolation. In + This study is an abstract from material to be used in a larger study, Explorations in Psycho- therapy.

She, her husband, and her three growing children are truly united in their religious convictions. To the second group belongs the case of Tom, a twenty-five year old aircraft worker who was reared a Catholic. Although truly religious, he rebelled early against many of the church's dogmas, especially the confessional. After long search, he and his wife, who had been reared a Lutheran, joined the Baptist Church "because they preach the Bible." He and his wife go to church regularly, but his convictions still waver regarding some of the rules imposed by this church. He doubts, then again defends his church, the same as Cynthia, an unmarried clerical worker of forty-five who declares that she should not even come to a psychologist, but rather should be- lieve God will help her as the Science of the Mind church teaches. Margaret, a forty year old unmarried teacher, was reared in a Methodist family by a mother who made religion and church the major issue of her life. In her own words, this mother "in the zeal of her soul strove too hard to subject her children to the teachings of this wonderful teacher, Jesus Christ." She would have loved to see her children become missionaries, but did not succeed in this ardent endeavor. Margaret feels the need for religion and a church, but she feels that being forced into it before she could appreciate it has made her antagonistic toward her mother's church. She joined the Pres- byterians, and is apologetic and defensive toward outsiders as well as toward her mother. The third group or those who reject church and religion is large in this case- study material. There are many different reasons for this rejection. A typical neurotic reason is the identification of the church with the ^parents against whom the individual rebels. Ambrosio, a forty year old administrative officer, felt bitter about his parents, his childhood, and everything connected with them. He felt it was hypocritical to go to confession when people afterwards continued sinning as they had before, and he also felt they thought of God only when in trouble. People's abuse of religion, and particularly his parents' failure to con- vince him that religion made them understanding or good, became for him a reason to doubt the value of religion. Another frequent cause for the rejection of religion is a person's interpretation of events as incompatible with the existence of a kind or just God. Roberta, twenty-nine, reared in the Episcopalian faith, felt at the age of thirteen, when her beloved twin sister died after an accident, that there could be no God who would let her sister suffer so much and die so senselessly, without listening to her prayers. "I cannot understand why idiots live on when my sister had to die like this. I can't believe in anything. I have no faith of any kind." This last statement will be discussed further in the last sections of this article. Religious insecurity of parents can arouse skepticism in a child just as much as the parents' fervor in enforcing religion does in other cases. Prudence, a thirty year old divorcee, says, "Mother treated religion in the same way she treated physicians. She changed them constantly. Mother raised me in the Union Church. She used to frighten me with hell. God was a beautiful man sitting on a cloud. In puberty I began to doubt. Mother then sent me to a Christian Science School. I disliked it. Then she went to the Congrega- tional, Unity, and Baptist churches. Finally she went back to Christian Science in which she now believes. I began to wonder and to think. I could not see it. Religion was no influence in my life. At the present time I am more of an agnostic." Another kind of agnosticism has intellectual foundations. George , for example, a thirty-five year old musician, reared in a religious, protestant family, came by way of reasoning to the conviction that for a scientifically thinking person, religion was not acceptable. The human being, he declared, finds himself put in a world which is un-understandable. We live, we die, we don't know why this is. The only possible conclusion is to make the best of life, to live a morally satisfactory life, to be kind to others, to find one's place in the community of men.</page><page sequence="3">SPRING, 1952 251 Moral convictions replace, for this group, faith and religious beliefs. By far the largest in this case material is the fourth group, those who grope and hope for new enlightenment and who live in the meantime within the frame of some very general positive belief. "There must be something" is the general trend of thought of these searchers, be their ideas more articulate and with the tendency to give them a scientific background, or be they vague and inarticulate. An example of carefully considered and rather clear thinking on the subject is offered by Milton , a fifty year old engineer. He was reared in the Baptist church, but evolved, since his student time, "a sort of independent idea about the whole thing. There is a first cause, there must be. I don't believe in an anthropomorphic God. I don't believe He rules the Universe by decree. I believe 'God' established an order." From there he goes on to explain disorder, the latitude in the choice of human action, and so on. Very representative for a non-dogmatic inarticulate, groping ^ belief in God is the statement of Astrid, thirty-two who in arguing with her Catholic fiancé says: "I believe in God. I believe that in the end things come out good. Perhaps I am often being helped without knowing. If you do what you believe, God helps in a way, although I never was helped so that I knew it. But there must be something." Still less conservative is the formulation of Martin , a young businessman of twenty-five. He says he believes in a certain cohesion, there is a reason for rain and sun. Not a personal God, not prayer or such. But there is a reason. "And I believe in being good, kind and thoughtful, it is better for the world in general and makes me happier." In all these groping theories, a general cause and plan is tied up with ethical concepts regarding human conduct. This will be further discussed in the last section of this article. The fifth group is represented by those who for various reasons do not care. Eddie , twenty-four, a young salesman, declares: "I have no philosophy of life. We should have all the fun we can, that is all. Yet we should do what is right. Life is so short, why worry about the hereafter." Stella, a twenty-five year old secretary, says: "What I live for? I am alive, I am here. I can't see any objective." Alvin, a thirty-eight year old business manager, said that he found no time to think about these things. The people discussed as examples of these five groups are all persons with emo- tional troubles, but with a rational enough attitude toward religious problems. In psychiatric work, many individuals are of course encountered whose religious atti- tudes and problems are much less rational than those discussed. In this sixth group would be found all those who suffer from deep irrational anxieties in connection with religion, or who developed some eccentric theories about their religious ex- periences. This group contributes less to the problem presented here, because the thinking of these individuals is less influenced by the spiritual confusion of our time than by their own inner confusion. In surveying the material presented in the first five groups the question arises: What conclusions can be drawn from this evidence? How does the obvious moral and spiritual uncertainty of our time affect people? How does it contribute to or aggravate their emotional disturbances? The first thing to realize is, of course, that spiritual and moral uncertainty as such could never be considered the primary causes of a neurosis or psychosis. But they could become important secondary, or contributory factors, in a person whose</page><page sequence="4">252 PI LAMBDA THETA JOURNAL trust in his parents and whose belief in himself is badly shaken. The child's basic security derives from his parents' affection and from the model quality of their personalities with whom the child wants to identify himself, and in whom he wants to believe. A second type of basic security is derived by the child from the belief in what he finds in himself, what he feels able or unable to achieve in respect to his own and other people's ideals. If the child is failed in his basic security, this in itself can be the beginning of a general skepticism. It is easy to go on from this basis to feel like Roberta: "I have no faith of any kind" if, in addition to feeling rejected by her own mother she finds that God does not seem to help her in a just cause. This sort of thing must, of course, have happened always. But in other centuries and generations the skeptic and agnostic was usually under pressure to return to religion. At this present time he finds himself in the company of very many people who, not only for emotional but also for intellectual reasons, reject the faith in which they were reared. Since moral standards are always very closely related to religious beliefs, the foundation of morality has become problematic. This is the most dangerous trend in the general insecurity pattern of our time. To many people it seems that an abyss is separating them from the world of their parents and grandparents whose faith in the security of their status and position, their bank accounts, their tradi- tions and convictions, was not shaken by world events. To find security in newly established spiritual and moral values is surely one of the greatest needs of our time. The psychiatric material presented here attests this fact, and general experi- ence bears equal witness. SPECIAL ANNOUNCEMENT Dr. William G.
