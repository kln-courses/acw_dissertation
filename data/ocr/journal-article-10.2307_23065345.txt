<plain_text><page sequence="1">8 Which art in Heaven: the Sphere of Manilius1 ALEXANDER MAC GREGOR For George Goold, as sensitive to science as to song. And what is Manilius doing in a volume on Divine Epiphany? His Astronomica in five books straddles the reigns of Augustus and Tiberius, the last of the Latin didactic poems and supposedly the first "complete manual of horoscopic astrology."2 That of itself has been sufficient condemnation; then Housman exalted his own reputation as an editor by belittling his poet as an astrologer.3 But there is Manilius saying such things as "What you seek is God," when he consoles his reader trying to understand the triangles that link 1 As given orally April 6, 2002; Lepus has been added after Fides as the concluding sign. Translations are by this author. Given the relative unfamiliarity of Manilius in religious studies, it seems best to quote him in English; the Latin is readily accessible in G. P. Goold's Loeb (1997). For Goold, though, Manilius is astrological "furniture" set against high poetic "wallpaper"; to use his translation here would prejudice the discussion at the outset. But despite many a difference of opinion, I will always be grateful to him for his magnanimity in encouraging me to complete my own translation. 2 So Evans 1998: 343, with similar characterizations in Housman et al.; a sample of critical judgments (since Manilius is an author we are free to judge) might include "third rate poet," "that poet," "bizarre," and "artificial." Hostility that unanimous, nay popular, is prima facie suspect. The reader of this paper can decide how "bizarre" Manilius is. It is not "astrology" in any useful sense of the word; see below n. 4 for an analysis. 3 What is more disturbing than Housman's invective against the author that he is editing is his inability, for whatever reason, to apply a relevant resource to the text at hand. For Manilius, that would be Plato. Housman's antipathy to Plato (and God, however conceived) is notorious; cf. Graves 1980: 48. Stoppard puts it more pungently: "Plato is useless to explain anything except what Plato thought" (1997: 46). Once only to my knowledge does Housman adduce Plato in the course of editing Manilius. At 2.66 corpus animate: "breath of life"; lit., "a living body," Manilius asserts that the universe as a whole is alive, an idea that extends from Plato through Cicero to Macrobius, In Somn. 1. There Housman does adduce PI., 77m.30B, "It must be said that the universe is alive, with soul and intelligence" (cf. also Diog. Laert. 7. 142, Ov., Met. 15. 342, and Sen., Q Nat. 3. 29. 2). He observes (11,10) that Manilius didn't have to resort to lost works of Posidonius for the idea, given the popularity of Plato and Plato's interpreter Cicero. But this was 1912. The passage occasions some jolly abuse of the Germans; Plato, though, was the only stick he could find. The (inadvertent?) citation is not included in the Index Auctorum to the volume; nor for all of that does the name "Plato" occur in CPAEH. Mere antipathy is understandable and perhaps excusable; suppressio veri is not.</page><page sequence="2">144 Illinois Classical Studies 29 (2004) zodiacal signs (4. 390). Why? For Manilius, the stars constitute a divine epiphany. The poet does not intend "to justify the ways of God to man"— which would Be an impertinence —but to show us that the stars are the God who rules the world. He begins with the star-map "Sphere" of Book I, then their relationships and motions in the next two books; in the last two, he fulfills his promise in the very first verse and "draws from Heaven" the laws that rule every aspect of our life, and death, through the constellations both inside and outside the Zodiac.4 All this he can show us, he tells us at 4. 915-19, because God grudges not to Earth the face of Heaven, But has himself revealed his countenance And form within his revolutions, His very self to offer and impress Upon mankind, and thus be truly known; To teach us, who behold him, what He is; And force mankind to recognise his laws. The Stars, first, prove the existence of God. This he assumes in the 4 To expand on the contents of the poem, book by book—the arrangement of Book I follows that of PL, Tim. and Arist., Cael., which rank as science or philosophy depending on the viewpoint of the reader: they likewise start with the zodiacal firmament and work their way down to earth level by level. The book begins with a star-map whose climax (1. 452-531), a paean to the unchangeability of the firmament, culminates in a proof from design for the existence of God, a proof strengthened by the mathematical truths of Books II and III. The remainder of Book I arranges the stars just mapped within the celestial geometry, then gradually descends to earth via the Milky Way and finally the comets that actually reach us, God's only emissaries to do so. Books II and III deal with concepts and algorithms (e.g. the zodiac and Houses; the changing length of the day) basic to astronomy and astrology both. Book III concludes with the mechanisms whereby that the stars determine the human lifespan—a problem of the greatest interest to astrologers then, and to Housman as well, a practicing astrologer himself. But Manilius was at pains to spike that particular gun; his algorithm for calculating the total lifespan is left incomplete because he explicitly says that he will not discuss the years allotted by the Quarters (3.583-85), or the Moon and Planets. Nor is there any algorithm for combining the allotments that he does mention. All that Book III demonstrates is that the stars, taken together and by themselves, determine the length of the lifespan. God does, in other words. At no time, though, does he give a specimen lifespan and how it was arrived at; or conversely demonstrate how to cast a specimen horoscope, much less how a practicing astrologer might predict a lifespan therefrom. Books IV and V between them demonstrate the influence of each constellation on individual natives and collectivities both (e.g. Italy); but there is no algorithm for applying them to a given nativity, since the effects of the constellations are always found in combination. Book IV describes the influence of the zodiacal Signs on each native. With rigorous consistency book V extends the stellar influence to include the paranatellonta, the extra-zodiacal constellations; in this he is unique. But in sum the five books are useless for the purposes of predictive astrology, whatever the overlap therewith. What they demonstrate is the divine governance of the universe, since he has already proven that the stars themselves are Reason, and God (1.456-531). The usual assumption that Manilius is astrology pure and simple is thus a falsifiable hypothesis, and it is false. What the modern reader expects to find in the poem, or wants to find there, is not to the point.</page><page sequence="3">Alexander MacGregor 145 exordium to Book I, soon to be followed by a Proof from Design (1. 474 531)—the perfect regularity of the celestial motions over the centuries, as impressive to Manilius as to Plato and later Dio Chrysostom in his Olympian discourse. "Such order is not Chance at work, but God" (1. 531). Indeed the stars themselves are God, God manifest. There is no "hidden god" or agnostos theos here, to be teased out or inferred; "they are their own best teacher far" (1.702). The identity of the stars and God is the fitting climax of the celestial exposition (4. 884-85, 894-95): And, howso small a part we are, the part Now contemplates the Parent of us all: Born of the stars, the stars we now approach. 885 * * * * Why wonder if mankind can comprehend The firmament? The firmament itself Dwells within man, and every man presents In miniature the paradigm of God. 895 Still, there is the sort of confusion here as in Cicero, Nat. D. 1 or Hermes Trismegistus. God, aether, cosmos, reason are virtual synonyms. The apparently nice distinctions are never clarified; they seem purely verbal. They recall levels of being in e.g. Plotinus, or the wrangles over Filioque and the Trinity. Overall, though, for Manilius the stars are God manifest: "the parent of us all" (4. 885). He follows a tradition of astral deity that ascends to Plato's Timaeus and the Epinomis—a totalitarianism that betrays Socratic individualism and freedom.5 In the Epinomis, for the "judges of the secret court," who fittingly hold their sessions by night, the highest truth is astronomy, not geometry stubbed into gymnasium sand. Earlier, only a few had dared identify heaven with the highest god. So for example a fragment of Euripides, likely hostile to the idea but quoted by Cicero with approval (fr. 386, ap. Nat. D. 2. 25. 65): You see the boundless aether, poured on high, Embrace the earth within its gentle round; Have this the highest god, have this your Jove! By now the idea is mainstream. In 290 Demetrius Poliorcetes could descend from his chariot in a star-decked robe, a god manifest to the Athenians. The Stoic Chrysippus equated the aether with Zeus (Cic., Nat. D. 1. 15. 40); Cicero's schoolmasterish Stoic proves the stars are God because they are predictable, largely by dint of repeating his syllogism over and over (Nat. D. 2). 5 So Popper 1966: 189-201 on Socrates, also 86-87, 210, 244; Sarton 1952: 1.414-19.</page><page sequence="4">146 Illinois Classical Studies 29 (2004) Manilius follows this tradition of astral deity. Soon enough, in his Borysthenitic discourse Dio Chrysostom (Or. 36. 39-53) will give pride of place to the chariot of the elements, where the Zeus of Chrysippus drives his aetherial steed; but in the Olympic discourse (Or. 12. 27-37) he sketches an ascent of man to the stars in no essential detail different from Manilius. In Ovid the brutes hung their heads, gaze fixed on the earth; only man can raise his eyes to the heavens (Met. 1.85-86). For Manilius, though, all creation turns to the new moon (2. 99-104), like the pious pig in Plutarch, trussed upside down, who rolls its eyes to the heavens (Quaest. conv. 4. 5. 3 = Mor. 67IB). To be sure, only mankind enjoys reason and can leave its caves to understand the laws that govern the stars (Arist.,pen Phil. ap. Cic., Nat. D. 2. 37.95).6 In Manilius and Dio both, mankind rises from primeval muck, "The farmer still the equal of his clod" (1. 74; cf. Or. 12. 35) to get his first inkling of God at night. For Dio, that is not enough.7 To go further and represent such a God in human guise is a necessary concession to human frailty, in the spirit of Homer representing ineffable Justice and Fate in the guise of Zeus. And so we file into temples, to garland gods with wishful familiarity—cattle from the barnyard of Xenophanes (fr. 15 Diels), but with opposable thumbs. Manilius makes no such concession. He has the air of a mathematician filling his blackboard with equations equally valid if not visible on Alpha Centauri. In the same spirit he despises the anthropomorphism derived from Homer and his pantheon. That tradition has petered out. Theocritus, a surrogate for Ovid, prompts a sermonette (2. 39-42) that reworks Verginius' outburst against lust (Livy 3. 47. l,pecudum ritus): A son of Sicily in turn evokes The ways of brutes, and PAN upon his pipes; He sings unto the woods no woodland strain, But through the shaggy countryside distills A suave sly tune to woo his barnyard Muse. In the same spirit Manilius ridicules the sublunary Jupiter who mismanages the weather (1. 104-05): Reason freed minds from idle wonderment, Wresting from Jove the thunder and the bolt, To clouds his Fire, his Noise to winds dispelled. 6 It is perhaps worth noting that Cicero chose to elaborate on Aristotle's "myth of the cave," which survives only thanks to him, rather than Plato's version of what must have been a commonplace (Resp. 514A-17A). 7 So Or. 12.58-60. His paean to God manifest in the stars is perilously close to a recusatio of the topic he was commissioned to treat, the aptness of the Pheidian statue of Zeus as a representation of the divine majesty.</page><page sequence="5">Alexander MacGregor 147 But worst of all is the rag-bag of mythic cosmology in his predecessor Aratus, and rival Germanicus, that makes the Stars depend on the silly or scandalous doings of the gods here on earth (2. 37-38): In their song, Heaven's naught but fairy-tales, And Earth itself creates the firmament From which in truth the very Earth depends. For Manilius, such stuff is not even Gradgrind's "well-told lie." To be sure, Manilius is not wholly consistent. Though attested crabs and centaurs are all obnoxious,8 he takes for granted the traditional representations of the constellations. There is still a Centaur overhead, not, as in China, a butterfly, or the sanitized geometries of Gregory of Tours.9 So Manilius applies a moral appropriate to the Platonic Idea of a centaur, since Reason is superior to Animality (2. 534-35): The Centaur must himself obeisance pay Himself in part, and hindmost learns to bow: So much is virtue human property. Nor does he identify Aquarius with Zeus' light-of-love Ganymede, much less with the whimsy of Germanicus: "Next, pouring hateful waves which once he fled, / Deucalion denotes the little jug" (561-62). In Manilius, a generic Waterboy sponsors feats of hydraulic engineering out of Vitruvius or Frontinus, and spendthrifts who run fortunes through their fingers like water (4. 259-72). In the same spirit, the accidental position of some constellations makes them look mutilated; he draws a general moral here too (2. 260-61): By its example does the firmament Console us our own loss, and teaches us To bear a chance mishap with fortitude. But in a given case the defective draughtsmanship can acquire added point. So for example the neutered Ox (i.e. Taurus) would rise rump-first, if he had a rump, therefore his natives include the passive homosexuals born under the Pleiades (5. 140-56). Fated though they are "to be that way," they are blameworthy for all of that (4.115-17). Manilius finesses the problems of Free Will, and of Evil, the same way Cicero had. 8 The battle of the Centaurs and Lapiths was fresh in memory thanks to Ov., Met. 12.210 535; even good Chiron will turn would-be pederast in Dio Chrys., Or. 58. 9 Gregory renames most of the constellations that he retains for calendric purposes: so e.g. Orion becomes "the sickle" (Curs. Stell. p. 868 Arndt and Krusch), the Dolphin becomes "the lesser Cross" (p. 865); he suppresses the Zodiac, since the liturgical calendar is in question. He is following the exhortation of Augustine, Doctr. chr. 2. 39. 58-2. 42. 63 to "spoil the Egyptians" of pagan learning until it is possible to erect sciences that are truly Christian.</page><page sequence="6">148 Illinois Classical Studies 29 (2004) Such are the stars. Manilius rises to them in a chariot apparently borrowed from Plato's Phaedrus (2. 136-40; also 1. 13; 2. 59; 4. 390-406; 5. 8-12):10 'Tis this I mean to carry to the stars With breath inspired, nor in a crowd Nor for a crowd compose my poetry, But by myself, as being borne aloft: Free, in an orbit yet unoccupied, To drive my car with none to block my path, And none beside to steer a common course. 140 Hackforth knew of no earlier parallel to the Plato,11 but compare the car which bore Parmenides (fr. 1 Diels) to the palace of Justice; Empedocjes rode the car of the Muses to the realm of Night and Piety (fr. 3 Diels). Thus too will Manilius reach the heavens, all by himself. There will be none of the scrapes and collisions that punctuate a celestial ride in Plato (and even Dio Chrys., Or. 36.47-50). Manilius mentions his mythic competition, deserved failures all— Phaethon, naive though sympathetic (1. 735-52; cf. Dio., Or. 36. 48), the charlatan Salmoneus and the over-reaching Bellerophon, "And footsteps there were none to mark his fall" (5.100). They were human, storming Heaven in a bad cause like those archetypal rebels the Giants (1.420-32) and Typhon (2. 874-80). As on the great altar at Pergamon, the hybrid monsters are the vanguard of barbarism and revolution. In this age they are symbolic of the mongrel citizenry that both Augustus and Tiberius strove to prevent.12 God reveals himself to Manilius, and to Reason, which overcomes all (4. 924-30, 932):13 10 For his conceit of the heavenly journey see now Volk 2002: 110-11,235^4. 11 SoHackforth 1952: 76-77: Empedocles may have enjoyed a chariot of some kind, and "we remember Pegasus... &lt;but&gt; I know of no parallel to the winged charioteer." But cf. Socrates of himself at Ar., Nub. 225, "I tread the sky, and contemplate the sun." Manilius is the best parallel that Plato enjoys, and vice versa. 12 The emphasis at 1.420-32 on their discordant and hybrid looks (the fruit of miscegenation?) may be a reaction to Hellenization. In his "political testament" Augustus warned Tiberius and the Roman people "not to free too many slaves, lest Rome be filled with a heterogeneous mob" (Dio Chrys., Or. 56. 33. 3 uairoSaitoi) ox^ou). The letter sounds apocryphal, but the sentiment rings true; Augustus himself restricted manumission with that in mind (Dio, Or. 55. 13. 7). Tiberius' own attitude was captured by Phaedrus, himself a freedman (2.5.25; cf. Tac., Ann. 2.55): he told a slave who was officiously watering down the walks of his villa that "freedom comes at a much higher price with me." The attitude towards (sc. Greek) freedmen had hardened since the days of Pompeius Trogus and Manilius (sc. "Antiochus," the founder of Roman astrology according to Piin., HN 35. 58. 199). 13 Compare Cic., Nat. D. 2. 7.18; for the priamel, Anth. Lat. 898 Riese ed. 1 (Seneca?): Auro quid melius? iaspis. quid iaspide? sensus. Quid sensu? ratio, quid ratione? deus. "What betters gold?" The jasper. "What in turn</page><page sequence="7">Alexander MacGregor 149 Just as the weight of but a little gold Exceeds in worth uncounted hoards of bronze, 925 And diamonds too, a speck and still a gem, Are worth the more than that amount of gold; Just as our tiny pupils scan the sky, Our smallest part, that grasps the sum of things; Just so our mind, the heart its lodgment spare, Rules the whole body from its modest court. 930 REASON it is surpasses everything. 932 We are a part of Reason ourselves, indeed part of God, as in Cicero (Nat. D. 2. 12. 32): so explicitly at 4. 406 (v. supra) and 4. 893-95: Why wonder if mankind can comprehend The firmament? The firmament itself Dwells within man, and every man presents In miniature the paradigm of God. Can anyone in honesty believe That men are born from anywhere but Heaven? Now, for Manilius, as for Plato, "reason" meant mathematics, and hard work. Contrast the typical Hermetic identification of Man with God, with its New-Age air. Simply by thinking lofty thoughts about God we encompass him thereby; so e.g. Corp. Herm. 11. 20 Nock: Make yourself grow to unmeasureable greatness, free of the shackles of every body; raise yourself outside all time and become Eternity (A iön), and you will understand God. Once you recognize that nothing is impossible for you, consider yourself immortal and capable of understanding everything— every art, every science, the character of every living thing; become higher than any height, and deeper than the depths. Collect inside yourself all the feelings (aistheseis) of creation—fire and water, dry and wet—and exist together with them. And so throughout books II and III Manilius displays his knack for doing "sums in verse."14 But it is more than that. This is theology; "god is a geometer."15 The length of days increases Sign-by-Sign from the winter Solstice to the Equinox; the poet manfully tries to describe its rate of change stepwise, without benefit of calculus. The new invention fractions helped some but not enough. They were unhandy, and took five years to learn in school. Manilius grumbled when he had to divide the circumference of the Zodiac into Betters the jasper?" All our senses do. "What betters them?" Our reason."Reason?" God. l4Housman 1937: II2, xii-xiii: "Now follows a long digression ... due to the pleasure he takes in exercising that eminent aptitude for doing sums in verse which is the brightest facet of his genius." 15 Cf. Plut., Quaest. conv. 8.2. 1 (= 718C), who notes that the phrase does not occur in Plato.</page><page sequence="8">150 Illinois Classical Studies 29 (2004) chords not arcs; this was worse. But what has gone unremarked here is not the clumsiness of the juggling—any fool could sneer at what Housman does—but the novelty of the balls. Manilius is working with a constant unit of time—hours like the modern constant hour, 1/24 of a day in December or in June no less than at the Equinox. Who invented his "standard springtime hour?" Certainly its discovery represents a "paradigm shift" more radical than anything in Kuhn.16 Perhaps it was hatched out of the calendric reforms of Sosigenes; enough that Manilius is the first exposition of the thing.17 Give him high marks. He was a theologian, by his own lights; therefore he engaged in cutting edge science and mathematics. Hence he does not have faith that there is a God "who governs all, infused through every part" (4. 890). Manilius thinks he knows that "God does not dice with the universe," and for the same sort of reason as Einstein. Such is the Reason that is both God, and us. For Manilius there is a constant reciprocity of Man and God, Earth and Heaven.18 It is transparent, and manifest many ways. So our progress in revealing new Truth, first sketched in the Rise of Man (1. 96—110). From Heaven we receive our souls, and indeed sporadic messages from God, "who pities us our fate"—that is the function of Comets (1.813-926), of all the celestial phenomena the closest to earth, and a fitting conclusion to Book I. In return, we send heaven new gods: Julius Caesar here (1. 925-26): Nor, when she gives a new God to the stars, Should Rome complain she misses God on Earth. and Augustus at the end of Book IV (4. 933-35): Nor should you hesitate to credit Man With having him a vision of the gods, Now that himself he makes new gods, to send Their powers to the constellations: So, greater than Augustus, grows the firmament The greater with AUGUSTUS as its chief. 16 Cf. Kuhn 1957 and esp. 1970:43-52; contra Evans 1998:418-20. Kuhn's exaltation of the heliocentric "revolution" as the preeminent paradigm shift is unfortunate. There are many others equally far-reaching, but anonymous or nearly so, and not attended with the air of intellectual martyrdom that makes Galileo attractive to many. So here. "Evans 1998:96 and 238-39 cannot name the discoverer of the "equinoctial hour." Ptolemy used it, but all ancient sundials divided the day into twelfths. Manilius seems the first attested use. 18 This is not the "cosmic sympathy" that pervades Piin., HN, which can be seen at times in Manilius: so e.g. the stellar enmities and friendships at 2. 466-640, in the view ofLiuzzi 1991 (2. 17 and 2. 117), though everything in Manilius can be reduced to celestial geometry, in theory at least. And it is not Lovejoy's "Great Chain of Being" either. The source for this reciprocity is likely the love of Plato's demiurge for his creation, but this is not the place to explore the question.</page><page sequence="9">Alexander MacGregor 151 This is not mere poetic flattery—an Ovid gushing over now the callow youth Germanicus, now Rome's geriatric dyarchy, cum seniore senex (Tr. 2. 166).19 It is in man's gift to make gods, and unmake them too. Pliny mentions offhand (HN2.72.178) that you can see Caesar's Throne down in Alexandria, but not Rome (where it would have been an embarrassment); unsurprisingly, he does not mention the Lock of Berenice it used to be, nor does Manilius. Well into the reign of Vespasian the workings of the stars remained a state secret, guarded by the heirs of Thrasyllus, astronomer and Platonist. Such men were the emperor's secret weapon, the equal of Los Alamos.20 Manilius even manages to symbolize the reciprocity of man and God by an elegant figure of speech. The height of ambiguity is not the Delphic accusatives that betrayed Pyrrhus, aio te Aiacida Romanos vineere posse: "'Tis you the Romans can indeed subdue." Manilius knows a subtler sort: a single word stands in two constructions, in two different cases.21 He reserves the figure for climactic passages where heaven and earth interpenetrate (4. 406): quid caelo dabimus? Quantum est, quo veneat omne? What price will we for Heaven Heaven give? What is the value of the currency That is the standard of the universe? And in the same spirit (4. 885): pars sua perspicimus genitique accedimus astris. Bom of the stars the stars we now approach. The poet invokes the utmost resources of language to reproduce the reciprocity of the universe.22 19 For the deification of Caesar, manifest in "his" comet, cf. e.g. 0 v., Met. 15.745-870 and Dio Cass. 45.7.1; for the testimonia, Ramsey andLicht 1997:155—81. What is peculiar to Manilius is the sense of reciprocity to the process; moreover, given the deification of Augustus as well at 1. 801 and 4. 935, its regular recurrence (rather like celestial revolutions). 20 The best account of the pervasive influence of astrology on official policy throughout the empire remains Cramer 1954. This is not the place to discuss the influence of Thrasyllus. For him, cf. Oliver 1980 and especially Tarrant 1993 for his Platonism; for his remains see CCAG 8.3 (1912): 99.6-8. 2' Isidore of Seville is apparently alone in distinguishing that type of amphiboly (1.34.14); his example is also pregnant: bellum ingens gerel Italiä (Verg., Aen. 1. 263): "A war so great will great Aeneas wage." Ovid overdoes the trick—over forty times in the Amores. In Manilius cf. also Scaevola igne sepulto vulneribus victor at 4. 31, and Augustus welcomed into heaven at 1. 801. 22 The conundrum at 4.406 started a fine battle of the books. Goold translated it "what... shall we give for heaven?"; Bailey demurred (1979: 159), "What shall we give to heaven [in exchange for heaven]?" The image of "currency," which was a commonplace in Latin poetry (though not Greek), recurs independently, and to striking effect, in Miller 1978:216, writing of the circulation of the blood:"... it is beyond price as long as it visits and revisits every part of the body. How does this treasure work? In what currency are its transactions conducted? What are its denominations?</page><page sequence="10">152 Illinois Classical Studies 29 (2004) The reciprocity is at work in the everyday world too. The Reason of the stars makes us what we are, at birth (4. 16); the so-called "astrology" of the last two books is simply social type-casting, the Commonwealth on earth that mirrors the stars. An explicit statement of this serves as the climax of the poem overall (5. 710^15), and a summary of Rome's social order, identical to heaven's own: As in the greatest cities of the earth The people are allotted each their class: The Senators obtain the foremost place, 735 And next to them the order of the Knights; Then you can see the People in their train And, lower still, the idle mass of men And finally a mob of no account; So even in the lofty firmament There is a certain sort of Commonwealth Which NATURE made, who in the firmament Has builded her a City for all time. There are the Planets, with their lordly mien; 740 There are the Constellations next the first; And there is every grade and privilege Pertaining to each order in its turn. Greatest, there is th' unnumbered Populace Which wheels around the heavens and its dome: Had Nature granted strength to match their count, The aether's self could not withstand their flames; OLYMPUS would itself now catch on fire, And flames involve the very firmament. 745 The preceding two books had spelled this out in detail—the nativities of the Signs and what they each sponsor, with their emphasis on technology and exploration. As in the equally optimistic Vitruvius, peacetime allows discovery and invention, gadgetry and infrastructure both.23 Aqueducts and courtyard fountains, "The countless nameless parts that make a ship" (4. 277), they all intrigue the poet; unlike Seneca, he decries the luxury but applauds the trade. Mining lays bare what is hidden, the raw materials for cities and civilization (2. 780); contrast the literary Luddites who decry mining as a "rape of the earth," and extol Sabine smallholdings out of Livy.24 In the same spirit the skills of the circus-performers, on display throughout the extra-zodiacal constellations of Book V (the paranatellonta), Such questions would have made no sense to Harvey...." 23 For contemporary praise of the pax Augusta cf. Manilius 1.13, Just., Epit. praef., German., Arat. 16, and esp. Vitr., De arch. 10. 9. 7 concluding his discussion of odometers: "useftil and amusing devices in times that are peaceful and without fear." 24 So e.g. Ov., Met. 1.138 and ps.-Sen., Oct. 417-18; also Horace's bucolic suburbia.</page><page sequence="11">Alexander MacGregor 153 exemplify the marriage of Reason and discovery here on earth—e.g. the natives of the Dolphin, whose gyrations emulate their stellar patron in swimming and gymnastics both (5.416-48). Even the humblest natives share in the cosmic template—the fisher-folk who load our tables are all the more welcome because they reveal the secrets of the Sea (5.395-409) and "visit the nymphs" (5. 434), just as the astronomer "will call on Jove with questions of the god" (4. 908). Such penetrations of barriers are not transgressive; they are revelations thanks to Reason, licit as such and indeed god-given. These revelations occur in unexpected Signs. So Fides the Lyre or "Strings" (5.410-15): Whene'er the constellation of the STRINGS Rises within the vasty firmament, There comes a born inquisitor of crime And nemesis of those who stand accused; Through chink and crack he ferrets out their deeds With evidence that they themselves supply, And brings to light a hidden underworld That revels in its silence and deceit. Hence too the tortures of the merciless, And punishments for warders to dispense. Natives will cherish truth and hate the wrong, Glad to expose the dissidence that dwells Deep in the heart for them to extirpate. "Strings" is in fact the nickname of an instrument of torture (still in use) much favored by Tiberius (cf. Suet., Tib. 62 and Calig. 33).25 Still, Housman ad loc. imagined that the native is a judge who "defends the unjustly accused," presumably wielding "the strings" in the process. Bailey and Goold envision an arbitration procedure. None of this is Roman law, least of all Housman's presumption of innocence for the defendant. The Roman empire was as much a police state as any other; why deny the obvious? As the native doubtless said to the suspect he was interrogating. Here too Reason prevails, with the help of torture. The interrogator brings what's hidden to the surface—like the pearl-fisher "diving to the depths."26 But what emerges here is dead serious. As one of the wiser gods put it, nobody ever believed there was a plot to assassinate him until he had been killed (Suet., Dom. 21). And so, there can be an epiphany in the police station too. Reason overcomes and reveals everything; to that extent if no other, this is 25 The device seems Roman; the Greek basanon is generic. For the meaningless euphemism "cord compressing the arm" (suggesting a blood-pressure cuff), cf. Enc. Brit. ed. 13 (1926) 27.74a, rp.ed. 11 (1910) = ed. 14 (1948) 22.310b. A certain evasiveness runs through English scholarship on the subject. These "strings" or ligatures were wound around the male genitalia, as Suetonius demonstrates. 26 The parallel was adduced by Htibner 1984: 185-86.</page><page sequence="12">154 Illinois Classical Studies 29 (2004) Popper's "Open Society." But there are happier instances of revelation among the natives of the paranatellonta. The natives of the Hare are all four of them as quick as their patron constellation (5. 162—71 ):27 One leaves the race a victor ere it starts; 162 One 'scapes the weighted glove with nimbleness 163 And lightly ducks or counters every blow; One with quick heel returns the flying ball 165 His feet as good as hands, to perch and play And multiply his strokes with nimble brawn; One rains a cloud of balls upon his limbs, 168 Deploying hands his body round about, To rule such Spheres, and play against himself, Then bid them sail as at his beck and call. 171 The juggler who is the climax of it all presumably has the number of balls attested elsewhere—seven.28 Even on the stage of the arena the secrets of the universe are revealed.29 But there is more revealed in the passage than just that—not just the planets who are the variable mechanism of the heavens overlaid on the unchanging firmament that is the god of 1. 456-531, but the essence of the universe itself, the tetraktys. The pattern of the verses here is simple: ten dots arranged as a foursome 1-2-3-4.30 That is, the tetraktys which Pythagoras supposedly discovered, a visual representation of the triangular number ten.31 Devoted Pythagoreans 27 The translation of 162-71 is isopsephic (verse-for-verse); the Latin has a corresponding four fold anaphora of ille. 28 The ancient sources go out of their way to mention seven balls: "As we ourselves have seen onstage," Housman remarks ad loc. He refers to P. Aelius, a contemporary of the poet, juggling seven; Goold 1997: 314a, adduces another juggler with seven on an imperial sarcophagus (Dar. Sag. 4.479, fig. 5668). The number looks canonical, and is an obvious symbol of the planets; Manilius presumably thought it could go without saying. 29 Since Gemini sponsors poets and astronomers (4. 152-61), and Lepus arises in the seventh degree of Gemini, Manilius seems to be revealing that he was born May 28th. If so, it is a pity he did not tell us the year as well. 30 An earlier tetraktys stands at 3.669-79, obscured by 670 (which is irrelevant as transmitted, and redundant as corrected); there the anaphora una emphasizes the figure. Another lelraklys apparently begins at 5. 701 (with anaphora of ille), but the archetype broke off at 709. The probability that any of these patterns arose by chance is infinitesimal, but space does not permit a discussion. The first tetraktys had dealt with the Signs (the tropics), the second with the planets, the putative third with the superiority of Man over Beast (as at 2.523-35). That is, the superiority of Reason as-such (cf. 4.924-30 et al.), with the climactic lost verse on the order of "Man rules them all, since reason rules the man" (Ille quidem dominat, quia homo est, ratione superbus\ cf. 5.636). 31 Ten was "the most revered number, because it represented the cosmos as a whole"; so Livio 2002: 33. Each component had its significance: cosmic unity, then feminine two and masculine three. Four, the last term as well as the total number of terms, ranked as the number of justice and</page><page sequence="13">Alexander MacGregor 155 swore by it;32 it was "the kernel of Pythagorean wisdom."33 But the poet is not merely casting his poem in the pattern of the universe itself; he is revealing his own philosophic allegiance as well. The universal epiphany, and his own, both at once—Manilius belongs in this volume. University of Illinois at Chicago order. Six, the sum of the first three terms, was the first "perfect" number (i.e. the sum of its factors); for Augustine, this was reason enough for God to create the world in six days (Civ. 11. 30).
