Scrupulous analysis of the material is comple- mented by annotated translations of variants of all the main texts. Those who might regard the subject as marginal should be assured that the specific conclusions about Ivan's enduring folk image have much more relevance than might at first appear to the understanding of modern Russian and Soviet history and culture. SCHOOL OF SLAVONIC AND EAST EUROPEAN STUDIES, FAITH WIGZELL LONDON Birds and Other Relations: Selected Poetry of Dezso' Tandori. Translated by BRUCE BERLIND. (Lockert Library of Poetry in Translation) Princeton, New Jersey: Princeton University Press. 1986 [I987]. xii + 153 pp. ?17.40 (paperbound ?6.35). The last decade or so has seen the death of many of the greatest post-war Hungarian poets, notably Laszlo Nagy, Janos Pilinszky, and Gyula Illyes. Simultaneously, there has been a sea change in Hungarian poetry: in the volatile climate of Central and Eastern Europe in the I98os the traditional role of the poet-leader-saviour is increasingly seen as both irrelevant and unperformable. It is not surprising that creative linguistic energies in Hungary are now being channelled, instead, into prose: Peter Esterhazy's phenomenal Introduction to Literature and Peter Nadas's Book of Memoirs, for example, are far more interesting and important than any post-war poetry, Pilinszky alone excepted. It is in this context that the present selection of forty-five poems from the 1970s work of Dezso Tandori should be seen. Now aged fifty, Tandori is a prodigiously fecund litterateur, whose colossal output embraces detective stories, children's books, and translations from a dozen languages, as well as novels, plays, poetry, and literary criticism; he is also a graphic artist. Much of his often technically brilliant poetry is fashionably and fascinatingly reflexive, being rooted in the minutiae of a daily life devoted exclusively to writing - and to the sparrows that find themselves in the title as well as on the dust-jacket of this beautifully-produced bilingual edition. Readers who enjoyed Bruce Berlind's excellent versions of Agnes Nemes Nagy's anthropomorphic landscapes will recognize the kind of care and attention that he has lavished on these translations, and those with clear reference points outside language (for example, the series on Impressionist paintings, and some of the bird poems) work eerily well. But many of the purely reflexive-reflective improvisations, with their delicately fractured syntax and wispy content, disintegrate under the thud of transatlantic paraphrase, and their closing doubly or trebly punning twists are usually well beyond the translator's reach (see 'It goes on', 'And there isn't', and "'Let's buy him an alarm clock"', for example). The original Hungarian on the facing page offers the toughest of tests to both translator and printer; Bruce Berlind does not always pass, though sometimes his rough-translator is clearly to blame ('szine barnabb' misread as 'szinte barnabb' (p. 74)), and it is disappointing to note almost a hundred misprints, some in the English and confusing ('its quiet planned I with telephone receivers' for 'planted' (p. 45)). None the less, there is much to enjoy in this volume, and it brings welcome light and colour to the somewhat ragged patchwork quilt of Hungarian poetry available in English.
