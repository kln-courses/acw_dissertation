<plain_text><page sequence="1">Ethics, Economics, and Christian Realism: Religious Social Theories of Reinhold Niebuhr and Gregoiy Vlastos P. Travis Kroeker The question of the relationship between religion and economics is currently the site of a raging ideological battle between proponents of democratic capitalism and democratic socialism, liberalism and commu nitarianism, neo-conservative and leftist theologies. In attempting to negotiate this battleground of ideas and positions, one is often caught in a confusing crossfire of claims—some of which are religious, others economic or social scientific. Some claims appeal to revelation and tradition; others, to the backing of empirical economic and social analysis. Sometimes the claims have a normative or prescriptive thrust; at other times they appear to be purely descriptive. How might we reflect on the complex relations between theology and economics so as to achieve conceptual clarity on the issues and to establish intelligible criteria with which to assess possible courses of action and policy proposals? How do those who wish to contribute to issues of economic policy arrive at and argue for the value judgments that inform their proposals? These questions might helpfully be addressed by the elaboration of a religious social theory. An important body of recent social theory has called attention to the presence of practical moral concerns in the social sciences and argues for the need to move from an instrumentalist view of rationality to one which recognizes that reason is grounded in social practices, institutions, and discourses that embody particular interests and values.1 Hence it is necessary to attend to the moral and symbolic dimensions of socio-economic life and rationality. It is here that the conversation among the social sciences, social ethics, and theology becomes significant. The way in which human beings, society, and socio historical processes are understood makes a crucial difference to the "interests" which guide social analysis and to the possibilities which orient a society and its people. For example, if the human agent is pictured as an autonomous individual will confronting an objectified world and</page><page sequence="2">78 The Annual of the Society of Christian Ethics making free, sovereign choices based on rational observation of the "facts" and his or her personal preferences, then there will be present a different understanding of human responsibility and the proper social order than is present when one highlights structural constraints and determinations imposed upon human action by economic systems, ideological beliefs, and socio-political conditions. Of course, some attempt to mediate between extreme positions on the relationship between human agency and social structures characterizes most social theoretical and ethical positions, but the emphasis and consequent descriptions and prescriptions of any view will depend on the factors selected for consideration, and it is important to take note of these.2 Insofar as religious or theological interpretations of reality imply or prescribe certain values, normative patterns of human action, and meaningful forms of social practice which shape social conditions and public policy, these must be considered by social theory. Yet religious perspectives and theological ethical choices, to be credible and adequate interpretations of and guides for human life, must be coherently related to the empirical conditions of socio-economic existence interpreted by social theories. Obviously, then, there is a complex reciprocity between theology and social theory which has important implications for the possible contributions of theology to issues of public policy. This reciprocity is primarily mediated in the realm of social ethics, i.e., how ought we to respond given the problems, limits, and possibilities of our common life in this society? This requires an interpretation of the particular relationships between religious ethical values and socio economic practices in our society. And this is the task of a religious social theory: to specify the empirical conditions for the realization of constitutive human needs and values by elaborating a theory and strategy of social change. Religious social theory is therefore both descriptive and normative, empirical and evaluative, and social theorists are obligated to justify their linkage of "is" and "ought" both in terms of the ethical priorities they entail and the empirical causal relationships they disclose. In order for religious social theories to be practically validated, their ethical priorities must be intersubjectively and publicly meaningful, and their empirical analyses must illuminate the limits and possibilities of actions and practices. In the remainder of this essay, I wish to investigate these ideas through a comparative analysis of two different models of religious social theory: the "Christian realism" of Reinhold Niebuhr and the "religious realism" of the Fellowship for a Christian Social Order (FCSO), a group of socialist Christian intellectuals active in Canada from 1934 to 1945.3 Both Niebuhr and the FCSO develop critiques of the economic and political consequences of modern capitalism, particularly as they were</page><page sequence="3">Ethics, Economics, and Christian Realism 79 being experienced in the Depression era. However, their theological and ethical analyses employ different interpretations of God's relation to the world, of human nature and experience, and of the root causes of the crises and distortions of economic life. Hence they also develop different social theoretical models and provide different proposals for addressing economic issues; these are differences which prove illuminating for our purposes. I will argue that Niebuhr's transcendent ideal of love cannot ground an adequate social theory—it cannot illuminate the socio-economic crisis of the 1930s, nor can it provide effective strategies for avoiding future crises. A realistic social theory must be grounded, as it is for the FCSO, in the immanent priority of membership in a historical community. Reinhold Niebuhr One way to develop a critical social theory is to explicate the normative purposes of human action and social practices in terms of ideals that are anticipated and presupposed in these actions; this enables one to move from "is" to "ought" in a critical evaluation of existing social practices. This is how Jürgen Habermas proceeds in his theory of communicative action, arguing that the basic human interest is one of mutual understanding. This is the goal immanent in all human action, an ideal speech situation in which all subjects are free to participate in the public social dialogue and the rational validation of normative claims. The ideal counterfactually illuminates the ways in which distorted social structures prevent such communication.4 Reinhold Niebuhr also employs an ideal from which to assess basic social structures and practices, but he does not elaborate a comprehensive theory of procedural rationality. His ideal is both more substantive and more transcendent. Niebuhr rejects any attempts to derive an "ought" from an "is" rationally. Moral norms and the ultimate meaning of human experience, the yardsticks by which we measure the distortions and the realistic possibilities of all historical achievements, are religiously discerned; they are not disclosed through social and historical analysis.5 This was Niebuhr's basic criticism of the social gospel—its religious ethical ideal was too immanent and therefore erroneously propagated as a simple social and historical possibility. For Niebuhr, only a religious perspective can disclose the ideal of life because human nature is characterised by self-transcendent freedom which exceeds the constraints of any natural or rational principles of interpretation. Only the transcendent law of love as the harmonious relation of life to life can comprehensively ground socio-historical meaning and provide a universal moral ideal. This ideal, while not deduced from experience, nevertheless illuminates and is validated by human</page><page sequence="4">80 The Annual of the Society of Christian Ethics experience.6 However, this ideal is not a simple possibility; rather, it is an "impossible possibility" which reveals the permanent dialectic in human experience between, on the one hand, relative historical achievements or approximations of love in forms of justice and, on the other hand, the impossible perfection which judges and orients human activity toward ever higher possibilities. There are two related problems with Reinhold Niebuhr's ideal: (1) The universal normative ideal is disclosed in the vertical, self transcendent relationship of the individual to God. It is not a social ideal, since it is not socially or historically constituted; therefore, it cannot specify a hierarchy of values or make judgments between competing interests or social policies. Niebuhr must supplement the religious ideal with a pragmatic political ethic which sorts out conflicting social claims in a contingent balance of power. The ideal of love, as an individual religious ideal, cannot be the outer norm for action since it is not a socio historical possibility—how can one act in a self-sacrificial manner toward a plurality of persons whose interests or conceptions of the good conflict? For this we need the rational calculations and relative norms of justice.7 Hence Niebuhr calls for a "frank dualism in morals," a recognition of the distinction between what is possible for self-transcendent individuals and what lies within the range of the more limited moral capacities and resources of collective action.8 This means that only individuals, not communities, can apprehend and live according to the ideal law of love. The best that can be attained in collective life are contingent balances of power, relative systems of "rough justice" which restrain the egoistic quest for dominance by particular interest groups. Principles of justice are elaborated in every society to guide the process of adjusting interests and forms of power to one another in an acceptable, though tentative, equilibrium between freedom and order or equality.9 However, these principles of justice must be rooted ultimately in transcendent religious conceptions of the meaning of life discerned by the sensitive conscience of the individual;10 they cannot be derived from the inevitably hegemonic and ambiguous cohesions of actual social life. (2) The ideal is ahistorical or trans-historical and does not orient human action in the sense of elaborating the enabling conditions and concrete possibilities for better social practices. While the ideal does illuminate the inevitable self-interest of all human beings, it offers no practical guidance for effective social strategies or agencies to overcome the distortions. This reflects Niebuhr's analysis of the real source of all social problems. He locates the source not in distorted social structures or a false vision of society, but rather in sinful human nature expressed in the self-interested will-to-power of anxious individuals, in all of its many possible masks, rationalizations, and distortions. Of course the</page><page sequence="5">Ethics, Economics, and Christian Realism 81 consequences of such will-to-power will be more harmful when individuals or groups are endowed by "the accidents of history"11 with greater power than is available to others. The task of social theory in Niebuhr's view is thus to disclose where the accidents of history have provided the occasion for egregious abuses of power that result in unjust forms of domination, and an adequate social ethic will then develop pragmatic strategies to beguile, harness, and restrain those powers in order to restore a modicum of balance and order, i.e., "justice." While Niebuhr holds in tension the bi-polarities of love and justice, individual and community, freedom and order, self-transcendence and organic relatedness, the relations between them are not clearly specified or even carefully attended to. The character of the relations between individual and community remains vague, I would suggest, because Niebuhr does not investigate them socio-historically. Niebuhr must specify more concretely what kind of community enables us to be the kinds of persons we ought to be since this is not given by nature. More is required than simply proposing the avoidance of tyranny and anarchy and the need for a balance of power.12 The constraints to which individuals are subject and the capacities which they develop are related to certain social conditions, practices, and understandings— to particular forms of human identity which are not given a priori, but are given in history, and which cannot be attained on our own, only in community. This raises questions about the socio-historical conditions of freedom, love, and justice, about the social matrix which constitutes and sustains these "essential values." However, Reinhold Niebuhr never at any point elaborates a systematic social or political theory to illuminate these questions. His social analyses are desultory and frequently only illustrative of general principles drawn from religious and ethical conceptions of human nature. This is because socio-historical analyses are not constitutive of the "total schemes of meaning" which inform social and historical interpretation. Social analysis can refute extravagant ideological claims regarding the causal relations of particular social conditions, but it cannot resolve the "irreducible ideological preferences" espoused by the various interest groups and classes in a society.13 Conflict can never be overcome in history since it is rooted in the very structure of the self. The basic social problem, then, is how to balance the competing interests of individuals and groups that occupy different functional roles in society. Such a balance will always be provisional and dependent to some extent on the coercive hegemony of certain interests and functional powers over others.14 The perduring problem of justice is to establish the best possible harmony by restraining powers that threaten social stability and by establishing an acceptable compromise between freedom and</page><page sequence="6">82 The Annual of the Society of Christian Ethics equality. Niebuhr's social theory therefore concentrates on a functional analytics of various forms of power. Consequently, although Niebuhr addresses the economic and political crisis of the 1930s, for example, he never engages in a thoroughgoing socio-historical analysis of the material relations in which that crisis occurred, since the economic relations of production are simply the occasion, not the cause, of the crisis. Note his early explanation of economic crisis, which he erroneously assumes to be Marxist: The oligarchs of capitalism, who own the productive processes upon which the weal and woe of all people depend, take too much for themselves out of this process, depriving the general public, and particularly the worker, of the consumption power by which the markets for goods are kept open. Thus capitalism suffers from increasingly serious crises of overproduction, unemployment, and depression.15 The fundamental economic problem is moral—the excessive greed of self interested capitalists—and functional, in that the excessive privileges of ownership result in a maldistribution of wealth which cannot sustain the necessary consumption capacity of the social masses. In the life-cycle of social organisms, capitalism has outlived its usefulness, degenerating into a vicious class struggle. The capitalist system has become "dysfunctional" and moribund, and it must be replaced by a more functional balance of power.16 Even as late as 1939 or 1940 Niebuhr still holds that this would require the transition to a more socialist political order, but when Keynesian policies of economic regulation and demand management within an expanding American economy (particularly after World War II) provides the kind of consumption capacity necessary to mitigate class conflict and to establish what appears to be an acceptable equilibrium, Niebuhr revises his view. Democratic capitalism can provide a functional political equilibrium. Indeed, Niebuhr's understanding of the economic crisis as a problem of underconsumption is in the first place Keynesian and not Marxist. Hence the Keynesian compromise between capital and labor through a politically controlled crisis management strikes him as a pragmatically sound solution.17 Niebuhr's view of democratic justice fits well with certain assumptions of what C. B. Macpherson calls the "equilibrium pluralist" model of democracy.18 While he rejects the narrow market rationality of "economic man" and seeks to preserve the moral content of democratic theory, Niebuhr tends to see democracy primarily as a procedure which maintains social stability through the balance of conflicting interests and</page><page sequence="7">Ethics, Economics, and Christian Realism 83 powers. Given the realities of human nature, the priority of the individual, and the inevitable inequalities of social function, an equilibrium of power—especially between economic and political power in modern democratic capitalist societies—is the most workable model of social justice.19 This model of state-regulated capitalism certainly functions to moderate the class conflict that has caused Niebuhr such concern in the 1930s; but it can do so only, as he himself realizes, within an ever expanding capitalist economy, a continual growth which Niebuhr calls a "gift of providence."20 This ¿ft has not been an unmixed blessing in our own experience, as current crises attest. For that reason alone, the equilibrium model of justice can be called into question—it lacks historical perspective. While it allows for a dynamism of social function, it does not consider the historical sources of class struggle and economic crises in the domination of a particular system of economic power oriented toward accumulation and continual growth, nor does it consider their possible consequences in future crises. In practice, historically, there can be no stable equilibrium in a system fundamentally dominated by the capitalist need for material expansion and accumulation. Niebuhr, along with other "realist" theorists of the equilibrium model, fails to perceive the extent to which political power is implicated in a system of extractive and unequal economic power. This failure, I suggest, is rooted in an inadequate analysis of the dynamics of capitalist society and in an inability to envision a changing and socially constituted conception of human nature in history. The Fellowship for a Christian Social Order The FCSO identifies its "religious realism" more closely than Reinhold Niebuhr did with the social gospel movement. While its leaders eschew a progressivist theology of history and concentrate, like Niebuhr, on theological anthropology, they also—like their social gospel forerunners—emphasize the immanence of God's purposes in socio historical and natural processes. They identify the primary religious norm as mutuality, the combination of solidarity and justice grounded in the reality of human community. Indeed they are critical of Niebuhr's theological anthropology, arguing that his realism does not focus adequately on the social character of human nature and identity, i.e., that the self (including the religious self) is constituted by its socio-historical relationships and communities. This leads to a fundamentally different construal of the relationship between religion and social theory than we find in Niebuhr. It is an approach that demands a much more concrete and critical understanding of material social relations, since these have a religious importance—they are constitutive of human self-understanding and agency.</page><page sequence="8">84 The Annual of the Society of Christian Ethics The FCSO elaborates an objective ethics that bridges the gap between "is" and "ought" by enjoining an absolute loyalty to the structured order of value found in nature and history. In Gregory Vlastos's words: God is not the sum of men's moral ideals. God is the patterned ground of value in the world itself. God is the structure of reality which men must discover and express in their ideas, in order to conform to it in their actions. Moral idealism is the last refuge of anthropomorphism. God is not the Ideal.21 God, on this view, makes demands through the particular concrete structures of the world. Religion is a commitment to something objective, not to inner experience or to a supernatural or transcendent ideal. A realistic ethic is one in which actions are recommended by what Vlastos calls "an historical fitness"—it is, claims Vlastos, more Marxist than Hegelian in that it seeks to change existing beliefs and practices through fit praxis rather than merely interpreting the world as it is from the perspective of an eternal ideal.22 But here we come upon a problem, suggested by Niebuhr's form of realism. If one seeks to derive a religious ethic from interpretations of value and meaning in historical and natural structures, how can one arrive at a principle by which to criticize existing states of affairs? How does one justify a particular moral action or social program as historically fit? We are confronted with the problem of the Archimedean point, namely, how is a realistic ethic or social theory grounded? The way Vlastos addresses this problem is very different from the way Niebuhr addresses it, and Vlastos criticizes Niebuhr's approach for residual idealism and individualism that render it unrealistic.23 Conceding Niebuhr's stature as an "expert diagnostician of sin," who provides a "terrifyingly true analysis of the spiritual condition of the isolated self,"24 Vlastos is less impressed by Niebuhr's normative model of the human self where anxiety, as the permanent concomitant of freedom, becomes the basis of all human creativity as well as sin. Such a model of human nature, focusing on the inordinate quest for security and the inevitable self-assertion of anxious individuals, is descriptively accurate of contemporary capitalist society, but it cannot, according to Vlastos, be justified as normative. Furthermore, Niebuhr's perfectionist conception of the ideal of love as self-sacrifice is not sufficiently immanent or social to reorient social practices in a way that overcomes distorted forms of community life. Reinhold Niebuhr's theological anthropology does not escape the realm of the paradoxical—the normative law of the essential human self remains an "impossible possibility." Actual human nature is defined and evaluated in terms of what it cannot be or do in history. There is no relief from anxiety and its inevitably sinful consequences.</page><page sequence="9">Ethics, Economics, and Christian Realism 85 Vlastos singles out two related defects in Niebuhr's anthropology—an isolationist conception of freedom and a perfectionist understanding of love. Vlastos disagrees with the notion that anxiety is a permanent concomitant of freedom and the basis of human creativity. Such a view derives, he argues, from the classical liberal understanding of freedom as a purely individual possession, a theory of freedom which views all forms of social organization as a sacrifice of liberty. Freedom here is the domain of individual sovereignty.25 The anxiety that inevitably attends this conception of freedom is not a source of creativity but rather a symptom of "the contradiction in which man is involved when denied a basic requirement of his very humanity: community."26 Far from liberating, anxiety stifles human action and creativity, constricting it into the alienating pursuit of one's own security. In contrast, a social model of human being does not perceive society and the individual as two abstract, contrasting entities that need to be constantly adjusted in a tentative compromise. For Vlastos meaning and value are grounded in historical community. Freedom and love, no less than justice, are social realities, defined by and realized within social relations. When individuals are understood as social and historical beings, there can be no radical hiatus between individual self-consciousness (which for Niebuhr is a permanent "given" that lifts persons beyond their communities as a transcendent "pinnacle of freedom") and the external social system that relates to it. Such a hiatus leads inevitably to instrumental social relations and abstract calculi of justice which distort the concrete forms of reciprocity and interdependence that constitute human communities.27 The problem of freedom requires social relations in which persons are treated as members of a community wherein they can develop their creative capacities together—this is what justice means, and it relates to a common social identity. Anxiety is not caused by human spiritual transcendence over material realities but is the spiritual and material product of the lack of genuine community. It is not merely a state of consciousness but is related to a material state of affairs. The fundamental problem of contemporary society is a sense of individualistic isolation and the need for community.28 A realistic religious ethic or conception of justice, therefore, is grounded not in a transcendent or transcendental Archimedean point, but in the immanent priority of membership in a historical community.29 Hence the primary value is mutuality or solidarity, not as a counsel of perfection, but as a necessity for survival in an increasingly interdependent world.30 The practical moral task is one of reflecting upon and illuminating what is at stake for us as a community and not just as individuals. Vlastos's second criticism of Niebuhr's theological anthropology is that it converts the common need for social solidarity and the mutual reciprocity of community into a perfectionist ideal of love,</page><page sequence="10">86 The Annual of the Society of Christian Ethics again conceived in individualistic terms as self-sacrifice. Vlastos does not begin with an abstract human essence inherent in the self-transcendent consciousness of each individual and immune to social or historical modification. Nor therefore does he establish as normative a transcendent ideal which does not and cannot exist in material historical reality and concrete action. Such an impossible ideal, as Niebuhr himself concedes, cannot guide us in the complex problems of social life. Indeed, such a perfectionist, individualistic ideal can only produce anxiety. Vlastos proposes an alternative starting point: "Let us look at reality itself and discern its own structure, its own historic direction, its possibilities, its opportunities, its commands."31 It is to historical, material reality that we must look if we are to perceive the character and purposes of God. And it is in the concrete structures of our life in the world that love as mutuality is found as a necessary practical requirement. Love must be rooted in material relations, and it can exist only in material activity. It is not an ideal revealed to human consciousness from beyond history. The truth about life is found as well as validated in practical human experience. There is in this view a highly interactive relationship between religion and social theory as our interpretations, commitments, loyalties, and practices are constantly revised and expanded by the "real" claims of other persons, of other communities, and of social, historical, and scientific analyses which we have hitherto ignored or failed to see. Such a religious understanding gives priority to the elaboration of a public practical discourse about values rather than to a utilitarian compromise between an inner religious ideal and the conflictual realities of political morality. What is at stake here is precisely the construal of reality to which persons in community must respond, and here religious faith and public reason cannot be separated—both are relational and community centered, both involve loyalties and commitments. This is not an attempt to construct universal structures of communication, nor does it employ a religious ideal which comes from beyond the social and historical processes of human culture. Rather it is the movement toward an expanding human community which orients human identity and action, and which must be taken into account in the setting of political economic priorities and policies. Such a religious vision is integrally related to socio-historical and material processes, and it is mediated through an interpretation of these processes. Like the Reinhold Niebuhr of the 1930s, the FCSO locates the heart of the social crisis in the class struggle. But in contrast to Niebuhr's functionalist analysis, which focuses on the permanent problem of social stability and counsels an equilibrium of competing powers, the FCSO attends more to the material and institutional practices of capitalism, which they view as constitutive causes—not mere occasions—of the crisis. The fundamental problem, according to the FCSO, is not the excessive</page><page sequence="11">Ethics, Economics, and Christian Realism 87 greed of capitalists, but the objective contradictions between the demands of capitalist development and the requirements of a democratic polity.32 While the material realities of modern economic practices involve complex relationships of social interdependence and cooperation, the structure of capitalism is oriented toward the protection and growth of private profits according to a market rationality based on maximising individual interests. The historical crisis grows out of the contradiction between private, autocratic economic decisions of self-interested capitalists which have a profound public impact, and a democratic polity which recognises and promotes the right of all citizens to participate in decisions about the allocation of public resources. The crisis is therefore not merely a question of inadequate economic demand but rather of the collision between capitalist and democratic social relationships, a question of the consensual criteria by which to evaluate and legitimate socio political and economic choices. While the FCSO's particular economic policy proposals and strategies for change are pre-Keynesian33 and therefore anachronistic in the context of today's complex global economy dominated by multinational corporations,34 their model of religious social theory remains an important alternative to Niebuhrian realism in addressing economic issues. They recognise, through their socio-historical analysis of North American capitalist democracies, that economic rationality constricts public choices into the political pursuit of short-term, self-interested material gain and that this undermines democratic culture, a substantive long-term vision of the common good.35 They recognise that these cannot coexist harmoniously in a stable compromise or equilibrium, but that at some point a political decision must be made between these contrasting visions of society, human agency, and "reality." Finally, they recognise that this is not a permanent tension pre-given in the structure of human nature, but a socio-historical development that can be changed—changed not into the kingdom of God on earth but at least toward a less crisis ridden political economy in which both particular and more general needs can be addressed in a democratically accountable community of moral discourse.

The FCSO advocated, among other things, policies of nationalizing monopolistic industries and establishing a comprehensive national economic plan. See Eugene Forsey, "The Economic Problem" and "A New Economic Order," in Towards the Christian Revolution, Chapters 5 &amp; 6. 34. See Edward S. Herman, Corporate Control, Corporate Power (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 1981). 35.1 do not have the space to argue it here in detail, but I am suggesting that the FCSO's conception of democracy comports well with the "participatory democracy" model.
