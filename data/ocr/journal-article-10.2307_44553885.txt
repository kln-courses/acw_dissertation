<plain_text><page sequence="1">A Dynamic Crash Test of an H-25 Helicopter J. W. Turnbow Flight Safety Foundation, Inc. NO TECHNICAL CRASH -PERFORMANCE DATA presently exists for rotary-wing and VTOL aircraft, i.e., data ob- tained under conditions permitting engineering measure- ments to be made during the accident. Consequently, our ability to design intelligently for crashworthiness does not match our ability to design for airworthiness. To reduce this deficiency in our technology, a longrange program, based on a series of progressive steps ultimately leading to full-scale droned crash tests, has been initiated by the Flight Safety Foundation (FSF) in conjunction with the U. S, Army Transportation Research Command (TRECOM). Through a contract between TRECOM and FSF, Aviation Crash Injury Research (AvCIR), a division of FSF, was given the respon- sibility for the accomplishment of certain tasks in an ex- tensive program initiated by TRECOM for the promotion of Army Aviation Safety. Among these tasks were: 1. Crash-testing of representative types of aircraft for the purposes of study of structural integrity. 2. Experimental evaluation of safety devices, crew and passenger restraint systems, and auxiliary equipment. This paper describes the first test conducted as an ex- ploratory study to : 1. Provide a "first look" at the acceleration environ- ment in helicopter accidents. 2. Determine the feasibility of using a shock-mounted oscillograph as an on-board recorder (not discussed in this paper). 3. Evaluate certain problems inherent in the dynamic crash testing of full-scale helicopter and VTOL aircraft. Because of the interest and need of the Army for the ex- ploitation of the capabilities of such aircraft, it was desired that rapid progress in the experimental crash test program be made. Rather than using droned aircraft in the initial study, it was decided to proceed with a "simulated crash" in which the test vehicle would be dropped from a moving crane. This would save much time and yet was expected to give reasonably accurate results insofar as the establish- ment of the approximate acceleration envelope. An H-25A twin -rotor helicopter (typical light cargo and personnel aircraft) was selected as the test vehicle, and a test condition was chosen which would yield an impact in- volving both longitudinal and vertical impact forces on the aircraft. The conditions at impact were established to give asevere, yet potentially survivable accident. Such an ac- cident is defined as one in which the occupiable areas of the aircraft remain reasonably intact. Test Conditions The conditions at impact were as follows: 1. Rate of descent: 45 fps. 2. Longitudinal velocity : 44 fps. 3. Angle of impact with the ground : 44 deg. 4. Pitch angle with the ground: 3-point attitude. 5. Yaw: 5 deg left. 6. Roll: 6 deg left. Two Alderson P- 3 anthropomorphic dummies were placed inside the helicopter, one in the left-hand pilot's seat and the other in the side-facing troop seat of the passenger cabin. These dummies were instrumented to measure acceleration in various parts of the body. An experimental range -ex - tender fuel tank, filled with 200 lb of colored water to sim- ulate its normal fuel load, was placed in the right-hand co- Abstract An H-25A Piasecki helicopter has been employed in re- creating a "typical" accident occurring with both longitudi- nal and vertical velocity components at impact. Accel- eration patterns at various stations in the aircraft and in the dummy occupants have been found to be incomparable with the results of similar tests conducted for fixed -wing aircraft by NACA. For the helicopter, large magnitude, short du- ration, accelerations have been observed. By contrast, ac- celerations of smaller magnitude but with relatively longer duration were found for transport type aircraft by NACA. When the acceleration environment for the H-25 is com- pared with known tolerance limits for human subjects, the need for modification in crew and passenger seats to provide better crash protection for the aircraft's occupants becomes apparent. 508</page><page sequence="2">pilot's seat. The main fuel cell contained 250 lb of colored water. Sand ballast was added to bring the weight of the helicopter to 6250 pounds, and the center of gravity loca- tion within normal limits. The forward and aft rotor blades were removed for the test. A photograph of the test article is presented in Fig. 1. A photograph of the interior of the test article is shown in Fig. 2. Test Method A moving crane was used to suspend the helicopter at the 30 -ft freefall height necessary to give the required ver- tical velocity at impact. The forward velocity of the crane vehicle provided the forward velocity of the aircraft. This method proved to be a simple and effective way of accom- plishing the task, but is limited to helicopters of approxi- mately 8000 lb or less when using a 30 -ton Lorain crane. Fig. 1 - Test specimen ready for drop Fig. 2 - Internal view before crash - looking forward. (Side-facing dummy passenger) The suspended helicopter was stabilized against pitch, /aw, and roll during the crane run by means of special fit- tings and cables on the crane boom. A photograph showing the helicopter suspended from the crane as it was in the test run is presented in Fig. 3. INSTRUMENTATION PICKUPS - Accelerometers were installed to measure vertical, longitudinal, and/ or lateral accelerations at various locations on the airframe and within the dummy pilot and passenger as listed in Table 1. Strain Tensiometers were used to measure loads at the following points: 1. Shoulder harness of pilot dummy. 2. Seat belt of pilot dummy (left and right tie points). 3. Shoulder harness of range extension fuel tank. 4. Seat belts of range extender fuel tank (left tie point only). 5. Seat belt of passenger dummy (right tie point only). The output from the force and acceleration transducers was recorded on two 18-channel "ground" oscillographs. Eight of the channels were also simultaneously recorded on both the ground and airborne recorders.* A complete listing of instrumentation to each "ground" oscillograph is presented in Table 1. Four high-speed 16mm cameras were installed on-board the aircraft. A total of six 16mm and one 70mm camera were used for ground coverage. RECORDING SYSTEM - The "ground" oscillograph re- cording system was shock-mounted upon the rear deck of the crane. The system included two oscillographs, cal- ibrator, and associated power supplies. The umbilical cable, installed between airborne instru- mentation pickups and the ground recording system located on the crane deck, had a maximum playout length of 100ft. A disconnect panel was provided should the distance be- tween the helicopter and crane exceed this length. It was found possible to stop the crane without disconnect, how- ever, thus permitting a postcrash calibration of all trans- ducers to be made. ♦Results obtained with the airborne recorder were, in part, found to be invalid due to a system disturbance apparently not due to acceleration of the recorder itself.

TURNBOW Test Results During the 4000 -foot run, the crane accelerated smoothly to a maximum speed of 30 mph as in previous trial runs with a dummy load. The suspended helicopter was observed to be slightly swaying as it neared the target area. (A 5-knot right crosswind was observed.) The center of the helicopter impacted at a point 2 ft to right and 3 ft forward of target dead center. During the free fall, the vehicle was observed to roll slightly to the left and yaw to the left ; the roll angle measured approximately 6 deg, the yaw angle approximately 5 deg at ground contact. There was no pitching of the ve- hicle. The helicopter moved forward after ground contact a total distance of 16 ft.

The following visual observations were made: 1. Helicopter Structure - At ground contact, the lower landing gear struts on both sides of the aircraft were pushed into the fuselage causing considerable distortion to the fuse- lage around the gear and internal buckling of the fuselage floor in the region of the forward landing gear attachments. The outer shell of the helicopter did not greatly distort ex- cept on the underside ; however, there were a number of skin penetrations and breaks. (See Figs. 4 and 9.) The oc- cupant area, although distorted, was essentially intact. 2. Pilot - The pilot seat support structure collapsed through buckling of the front legs and the dummy pilot's head struck the fuselage frame on the left-hand side of the cockpit vi- olently enough to split his helmet visor and crack the hel- met. The helmet remained intact and was not perma- nently dented. (See Fig. 7.) The right foot had been pushed under the right torque pedal. The seat belt and shoul- der harness (attached to the seat) did not fail. 3. Passenger - The troop seat collapsed in such a manner Fig. 4 - Postcrash front view Fig. 5 - Postcrash front quarter veiw that the passenger dummy was thrown forward and downward, his head contacting the rear of the pilot's seat with no ap- parent damage to the helmet.

(The shoulder joint mechanism of theP-3 dummy is quite dissimilar to that of the human.) 4. Range Extender Fuel Tank - The copilot seat support- structure failed, through buckling of the front legs, causing the seat to move forward. The range extender fuel tank located in this seat contacted the instrument column (see arrow, Fig. 9) causing the cell to tear with its fuel (colored water) spilling over a large area. Failures of the tank were observed in the bottom and in the upper and inboard seams joining the two halves of the tank. These failures were prob- ably due to the tank having impacted the top of the right- hand window (observed in highspeed photographs). DATA REDUCTION AND PRESENTATION - In this ex- ploratory test no filtering was introduced between the trans- ducers and recorders in order that maximum frequency re- sponse could be maintained.* Smoothing of the acceler- ometer data has thus been required as was anticipated. Since smoothing introduces an additional source of error, the smoothed acceleration-time curves were integrated to obtain velocity-time plots, providing a check on the total change in velocity of selected points of the aircraft. Typ- ical examples are shown in Figs. 10 and 11. In the case of the longitudinal motion of the cockpit floor (see Fig. 11), the velocity -time curve was integrated to give the displace- ment plot. Satisfactory agreement with the measured dis- placement of the aircraft (as obtained from high-speed photo- graphs) was obtained. Reliability of the data is thus indica- ted. The sign conventions used in presenting the acceleration- time plots are as illustrated in Fig. 12. For the safety belt and shoulder harness loads tension is taken as positive. ACCELERATION AND FORCE MEASUREMENTS - The acceleration-time plots and force-time plots obtained from •CEC type 347 and 342 galvonometers maintain a re- sponse flat to 135 cps. Natural frequency of accelerometers: 110-250 cps for 10g transducers, 850 cps for 200g units; damp- ing 0.7 critical. Fig. 9 - • Postcrash view of cockpit the two crane mounted oscillographs are presented in Figs. 13-20. Two channels of airborne recorded data (range ex- tender tank seat -belt and shoulder-hamess loads) are also shown in Fig. 19. The condition of the aircraft at various times during the test is illustrated in the sequence photo- graphs of Fig. 21 which may be referred to for a better under- standing of events and results discussed below. 1. Cockpit -Floor Accelerations - Referring to Fig. 13, and to the sequence photographs of Fig. 21, it is clear that the landing gear did not appreciably decelerate the aircraft during the impact. The primary acceleration pulse began at 0.085 sec, at which time the forward portion of the fuse- lage began to contact the ground. In a rise time of 0.017 sec the vertical acceleration peaked at 115g. The relatively high stiffness of the forward fuse- lage ring and the small distance between floor and the bot- tom of the aircraft (allowing little deceleration distance) would account for the high peak vertical acceleration and high rate of onset at this point compared to the passenger cabin floor (discussed in the following section). The longitudinal acceleration of the cockpit floor (Fig. 13) built up gradually to about 20g at 0.09 sec due to the gradually increasing contact area between the fuselage and r°° 4 1 - i - - - ñ m I I I rs - - g ^ ORIGINAL OSCILLOGRAPH RECORD ñ I I » I 1000 ^ I I HIGH FREQUENCY COMPONENT OCCURS AT 260 C.

(See Fig. 21A and 21B.) The sudden reduction to zero g's at 0. 10 sec is probably attributable to the rapid break- ing up of the floor structure (115g vertical acceleration at 0.105 sec) in the immediate vicinity oftheaccelerometer attachment point (as found from postcrash inspection) thus momentarily relieving the longitudinal forces at this point of the aircraft. A 45g peak longitudinal acceleration fol- lowed immediately.

W. TURNBOW increase in forward velocity of the cockpit area in the in- terval 0.12 to 0.19 sec. The lateral acceleration of the cockpit floor was of an oscillatory nature with peaks of 10g to 15g and a frequency (irregular) of the order of 20 cycles per sec, with correspond- ing amplitudes of about 1/4-in. 2. Passenger Cabin Floor Accelerations - In general, the pattern of accelerations at the passenger cabin floor level follows that for the pilot compartment. Almost no (2.5 fps) reduction in the vertical velocity was attributable to the action of the landing gear up to the time of its failure at 0.05 sec. (See Figs. 10 and 21B.) The vertical acceler- ation built up slowly as compared to that for the pilot com- partment and reached a peak value of 61g at 0.10 sec or about 5 milliseconds earlier than for the corresponding 115g peak value for the cockpit floor. That the time delay should exist is made obvious from a study of the sequence photo- graphs of Fig. 21, i.e., the aircraft first contacted the ground at the tail section, then settled progressively along the lon- gitudinal axis toward the nose section. The lower peak ver- tical acceleration at the passenger cabin floor, as compared to the pilot compartment, was probably due in part to the decrease in vertical stiffness of the floor supportstructure in ♦ 100C 0 d 22 e o" ~° - ~ "1-^ 7^ 13G 1 o" ~° - ~ T7r "1-^ 7^ A U 13G Ą . . , 00G U ^ v I - . ,0G U»C_i ~~ Vi gJ£/ ~~ ^-ACC.

(See Fig. 6 and discussion of cockpit floor accelerations. ) The peak longitudinal acceleration, 36 g, was of the same order of magnitude as for the passenger cabin floor. 3. Pilot Harness Loads and Pelvic Accelerations* -A study of Fig. 15 shows that the peak longitudinal and ver- tical accelerations observed at the floor level were carried through to the pilot -dummy pelvic -region with a time delay of approximately 10 milliseconds. There was, approxi- mately, a 50 °]o reduction in amplitude of the main pulse in each case, but with a corresponding increase in time dura- tion as would be anticipated. In fact, the pelvic vertical acceleration was maintained at an average value of about 30g for some 0.040 sec, accounting for a change in veloc- ity of 39 fps in this interval. Film records from two of the high-speed cameras mounted on board the aircraft indicate that the pilot seat started to fail (rotate about rear floor attachments) at 0.11 sec. A postcrash inspection showed this to be due to the buckling of both front legs of the tubular steel seat. The seat failure is seen from Fig. 15 to correspond with a sudden reduction of load in the shoulder harness. This would be expected since the shoulder harness is attached to the seat structure in the H-25A aircraft. The time of fail- ure also corresponds with the peak pelvic vertical acceler- ation of 60g. The seat continued to rotate (Fig. 22) until 0.143 sec, at which time a very abrupt reduction in the for- ait must be emphasized that all accelerations recorded within the dummy pilot and passenger are simply the re- sponses of the dummy stmcture, in many respects dissimilar to the human frame, to the input accelerations to the dummy. Direct correlation of these accelerations with those that would be experienced by a human occupant is questionable. Orders of magnitude and event timing, however, are probably re- presentative of an actual crash. C-46 TRANSPORT STATION, 11G AT 0. 122 SEC.

The 40g vertical and 43g longitudinal pelvic accelerations of Fig. 15, occurring at 0.143 sec, are thus in agreement with the hi -speed photographic record, as are the peak lateral and longitudinal chest accelerations of Fig. 16. • Stoppage of the forward motion of the seat is attributable to these sources: (a) Contact of the pilot's head with the main fuselage frame in the region of the pilot compartment. (See Fig. 22.) (b) Contact of the forward edge and bottom of the pilot seat with the underlying structure, i.e., floor and control system. (See Fig. 9.) (c) Forces transmitted to the pilot dummy torso through the legs. It is of considerable interest that the shoulder harness and seat belt loads were extremely low in comparison to the mass-acceleration product for the pilot dummy anatomical components. It is thus obvious that these forces were neg- ligible compared to the other forces transmitted to the pilot through the legs, seat, and fuselage frame. 4. Pilot Chest Accelerations - As in the case of the pel- vic accelerations, the chest accelerations for the pilot dummy initially correspond fairly closely with the accelerations of the cockpit floor. (See Fig. 16.) It is of interest that the initial peak chest longitudinal acceleration (27g) while lag- ging that for the floor, slightly leads that of the pelvic re- * Records for the pilot head also show 80g longitudinal and 12g lateral (10g range accelerometer bottomed) at this time. gion. The 14g lateral chest acceleration is associated with the abrupt stoppage of the forward motion of the pilot and seat as discussed in the preceding paragraph. Progressive attenuation of the vertical accelerations from the floor upward appears to have existed as shown by these recorded values: Floor - 115g Pelvic region - 60g Chest region - 51g Head (obtained from airborne oscillograph) - 45g Such attenuation is not necessarily always found in the im- pact of elastic systems. In fact, amplification is often dis- covered (1, 2).* 5. Passenger Seat Belt Load and Chest Accelerations - A comparison of the accelerations for the passenger dummy with the corresponsing seat belt loads (Figs. 8 and 17) illustrates, as in the case of the pilot dummy, that the seat belt load was relatively low (1100 lb max**) compared to the loads from other sources. For the passenger, these loads came from: (a) The troop seat. (b) The floor of the aircraft. (c) The left wall of the aircraft. The film record from a high-speed camera in the pas- senger compartment shows that at 0.105 sec the passenger, while sitting essentially upright, started to move downward with the respect to the aircraft. At 0.15 sec this motion •Numbers in parentheses designate References at end of paper. **The belt did not fail. Fig. 21 - Sequence illustrations of an H-25 drop test</page><page sequence="9">516 J. W. TURNBOW was abruptly halted. These times are noted in Fig. 17 and correspond to : (a) The failure of the seat at 13g. (b) Contact of the dummy while in a sitting position with the floor of the aircraft, giving a peak acceleration of 56g. The peak lateral and longitudinal accelerations and seat belt load will be seen, from Fig. 17, to occur at or near the time (approximately 0.15 sec after impact) at which the passenger dummy contacted the floor. 6. Passenger Head Accelerations - During the interval 0.105 to 0.150 sec, the vertical axis through the passenger dummy's head was observed to rotate clockwise, as seen in Fig. 2, through approximately 50 deg. Thus, the "ver- tical" and "longitudinal" accelerations presented in Fig. 18 are not so aligned with respect to the airframe, but with respect to the rotated head. *Thus, the peak (56g) ver- tical acceleration recorded in the dummy chest region upon impact of the dummy with the floor, following the seat fail- ure, should have been transmitted to the head with consid- erable reduction in magnitude. Thirty -three g's were re- corded, as seen in Fig. 18; furthermore, the peak "vertical" •Observe from Fig. 12 that the "longitudinal" direc- tion of the dummy is the lateral direction with respect to the airframe itself. Fig. 22 - Pilot dummy position before and after impact head acceleration occurred simultaneously with the peak vertical chest acceleration. The rotation of the head from the vertical should also have resulted in positive "longi- tudinal" accelerations in the head for negative vertical ac- celerations in the chest (neglecting elasticity of dummy). A sharp positive peak "longitudinal" acceleration of llg is seen from the figure to exist in conjunction with the pri- mary vertical pulse due to the impact with the floor. Ac- tually, the true peak was probably higher than llg; how- ever, the 10g range accelerometer used has since been shown on bench test to bottom at about -llg and +13g, and prob- ably did bottom on this short duration pulse without present- ing visible evidence of such bottoming. There is no ques- tion but that the accelerometer did bottom on the subse- quent two negative pulses as shown in Fig. 18. The hi -speed photographs show a rapid deceleration of the forward rota- tion of the head in this period. This would account for these large negative "longitudinal" values. The lateral head acceleration consisted of two pulses. The first was an 80g deceleration at 0.165 sec, i.e., im- mediately following the vertical impact of the dummy with the floor. This was followed by 22g acceleration at 0.21 sec. The velocity changes corresponding to these pulses were -37 and +10 fps, respectively. These motions are not visible in the high-speed photographs because of the motion of the aircraft itself and because these motions were along the line of sight of the camera. The total displacement of the head with respect to the airframe during the 27 milli- seconds required for the 37 fps velocity change would only be about 2 in. 7. Range Extender Tank Loads - The seat belt and shoul- der harness loads were, as for the pilot, relatively low. (See Fig. 19.) They remained below 970 and 300 lb respectively, building to or near these values as the longitudinal accel- eration of the cockpit floor began to build up. Observation of the upper portion of the seat through an on-board high- speed camera indicated that the collapse of the seat began at 0.11 sec, i.e., at or near the time for the peak accel- erations of the cockpit floor. This time was the same as that for the failure of the pilot seat. Buckling of the for- ward legs of the seat allowed the seat to rotate and move forward. At 0.145 sec the forward inboard comer of the tank contacted the instmment console (Fig. 9) rupturing the fiberglass tank, and fuel spillage began. Other tank fail- ures were: (a) Failure in the pan area of the seat (a cushion was placed between tank and seat). (b) Separation of the upper and inboard seams due to con- tact of the filler cap with the top windowsill of the right hand window of the aircraft. Occupant Injuries It is recognized that no direct correlation can be made between the response of the two dummy occupants of the aircraft and the response and injuries which would have been sustained by an actual pilot and passenger. The following</page><page sequence="10">DYNAMIC CRASH TEST 517 summary comments must thus be considered with this point in mind. Pilot 1. The head impacted the main fuselage ring, splitting the visor and cracking the helmet (Army APH-5 as shown in Fig. 22 ; however, the helmet remained intact and was not permanently dented. Some damage to the airframe structure did occur in the vicinity of the point of impact but this damage was apparently due to compression and bend- ing loads in the fuselage frame introduced by the decelera- tion of mass of the forward transmission system. The fiber- glass fairing over the fuselage frame was destroyed by the impact. An 80g* longitudinal acceleration in the head was re- corded at the moment of contact with the frame. The lat- eral acceleration record shows the accelerometer to have bottomed at 12g*. 2. Vertical accelerations of 60g in the pelvic region and 51g in the chest region were recorded. An average pelvic acceleration of 30g existed for approximately 40 millisec- onds and was coupled with a simultaneous longitudinal pulse of 43g. 3. Evidence of considerable force in the ankles existed (see Fig. 22). The right foot was pushed under the right hand antitorque pedal (probable ankle injury). 4. The right hand was driven into the instrument col- umn with sufficient force to bend the hand backward to an angle of less than 90 deg with the forearm. Index finger and thumb of dummy were damaged, Fig. 9 (probable wrist injury). Passenger 1. The passenger seat failed allowing the dummy to im- pact the floor in an upright sitting position with a 56g ver- tical acceleration being recorded in the chest region. 2. A lateral head acceleration of 80g was recorded, re- sulting in a change in velocity of the head of 37 fps in 27 milliseconds. This was followed approximately 40 milli- seconds later by a reverse acceleration of 22g with a cor- responding change of velocity of 10 fps. A vertical accel- eration of the head of 33g occurred only 10 milliseconds prior to the 80g acceleration. 3. The right arm of the dummy was broken off at the shoulder, probably due to the absence of a "human like" ball socket joint in the shoulder. Fire - Fuel (water) from the range extender tank sprayed throughout the cabin area, and covered the ground on both sides of the aircraft from the landing gear forward. (See Figs. 4 and 5.) Both occupants, pilot and passenger, were sprayed with the simulated fuel. The main fuel tank did not fail. Comparison of Test Results with Other Test Data A significant difference has been observed to exist be- tween the acceleration pulses recorded in the occupiable •Airborne recording, not shown elsewhere in this paper. area of the H -25 aircraft in this test and those recorded in the cabin area of larger transport aircraft which were sub- jected to crash tests by NACA (3, 4, 5). With reference to Fig. 20, it is evident the accelerations for the H-25 were much larger in magnitude (with shorter time duration) than for the transport. The accident conditions were certainly not identical for the two aircraft ; however, each accident was typical for the respective aircraft involved. Further- more, these differences in acceleration pulses may be ex- pected to occur even undei more nearly identical condi- tions. The shorter deceleration distances which are appli- cable to the smaller aircraft, and the low energy absorp- tion capacity of the lighter sheet metal structure of the hel- icopter will tend to yield higher (and shorter duration) ac- celerations at floor level in the helicopter than in the trans- port. In fact, it appears from a study of data reported by NACA (3, 4, 5) on fifteen crash tests of fixed -wing aircraft ranging from the Piper J-3 to the C-82 that, in potentially surviv- able accidents, the acceleration environment in light heli- copters (as shown by this test*) is, in general, more severe with respect to peak magnitude of vertical acceleration at floor level than in fixed -wing aircraft of the light plane or fighter types, as well as for the larger transports. This would suggest the possibility that a higher incidence of deceler- ation injuries might be expected in survivable helicopter accidents than in survivable fixed -wing accidents. A brief analysis of the Army fixed -wing and helicopter accidents during the interval July 1957 to December 1960 appears to validate the above statement. During this period major accidents and injuries reported** are shown in Table 2. Then, on the basis of a comparable number of accidents in each aircraft involving comparable numbers of occupants, •Four additional tests conducted by AvCIR on two H-25's and two H-13's now substantiate the test data presented in this paper. The results of these tests will be presented in another paper at a later date. ••Per data obtained from Anthony Bezereh, Capt. , MC, Flight Surgeon, Human Factors Section, USABAAR, Fort Rucker, Alabama.

W. TURNBOW approximately twice as many injuries were sustained inheli- copters as in fixed wing. Further, about one and one-half times as many deceleration injuries occurred for the heli- copter as for fixed wing. There are many hidden variables in the numbers presented above, and a statistical analysis is needed to give a trae picture. Comparison of Test Data with Known Human Tolerance to Acceleration In Fig. 23 plots of vertical acceleration versus time du- ration for: (1) the cockpit floor, (2) pilot chest, (3) pilot pelvic region, and (4) passenger chest have been superim- posed upon a plot ( NACA TN 3775) of human tolerance to acceleration. The significant curves, so far as possible ev- idence of deceleration injury in the H-25 crash test is con- cerned, are probably those of the chest accelerations of the dummies. Minor to severe injuries are indicated even though any dynamic amplification that might occur in a live sub- ject is neglected. Actually, the H-25 test curves of Fig, 23 should be somewhat higher than those shown because the human tolerance curve and the test curves were not com- pared upon an identical basis. (It is not possible to do this because most of the present tolerance limits are based upon the trapezoidal pulse as shown in the figure, while the ac- tual test data yields curves of other than trapezoidal shape.) The errors due to this effect are probably small, however. More significant is the fact that simultaneously with the ver- tical acceleration, the subj ect in an actual crash must undergo both longitudinal and lateral accelerations. This (1) un- doubtedly reduces the tolerance to acceleration through in- duced misalignment of the subject with respect to the seat and support harness, and induces a larger resultant acceler- ation upon the subject than the value given by any of the three components. A similar plot in Fig. 24 shows that, so far as longitu- dinal accelerations alone are concerned, the "accident" as created in this test would probably not have produced de- celeration injuries, provided maximum body support had been used. This was not the case, however, particularly NOTE: HUMAN TOLERANCE CURVES H-25 TEST TAKEN FROM NACA TN S775 COCKPIT FLOOR A »***.« PILOT'S CHEST I MSSENOCR'S CHEST '99r SEVERE INJURY STOPPING PILOT PEIVIC 80 1 '' FORCE 60 - 'v H UM,TS UP0N WM,CM y&gt; PRESENT EJECTION 40- MļNOļ|'V SEATS ARE OESIGNEO 1 ' INJURY VAjk ' ^ 2 20 - ¿ V6luMa*Y ' ..TV * . g _ HUMAN TOLERANCE ' ' * S •" NN 4 . ļ-OURATlON-ļ . 4 . - I Hą i . duration at "x" o's / '™r «•« ^ S.™* HUMAN TOLERANCE LIMITS H-25 CRASH TEST 1 1 1 1 I i I i I il 1 1 I i I i I il I ■ i ■ i ■ i -i .001 .01 .1 I DURATION OF UNIFORH ACCELERATION. SEC Fig. 23 - Tolerance to acceleration parallel to spine when using seat belt and shoulder harness compared with H-25 crash test data for the side-facing passenger dummy which was restrained by a seat belt only. Even for the pilot dummy (restrained by seat belt and shoulder harness) maximum body support was not provided as illustrated by the following quotation from a paper in which the performance of various restraint systems is discussed (6). "Tests with the different harness configuration brought out the following: 1. The standard USAF harness shoulder straps and lap belt combination was unstable and inadequate with uneven application of force due to sequence of: (a) The head and shoulders coming forward, stretching the shoulder straps and elevating the lap belt to the solar plexus level, above the center of gravity of the seated sub- ject. (b) The pelvic girdle and lower extemities then slid for- ward without restraint until the trunk draped around the lap belt. This resulted in sudden pressure to the epigastrium and rib margins that was not tolerated by any subject above 17 g average applied. This agrees well with the findings of Bierman, whose subjects could not tolerate more than 2600 lb with the same harness. " Thus, it is possible, even though the H-25 test curves lie below the "tolerance limit" in Fig. 24, that the longi- tudinal accelerations may also be significant from the stand- point of injury potential, particularly for side-facing oc- cupants restrained by seat belt alone. Conclusions It is concluded that: 1. A satisfactory and relatively inexpensive method for the simulation of accidents of helicopters has been devel- oped. The method permits the use of "ground -mounted" instrumentation. The approximate limitations when using the 30 ton crane are: Maximum gross weight - 8000 lb. Maximum horizontal velocity - 30 mph. Maximum vertical velocity - 30 mph.

Reliable acceleration data for both the airframe and dummy occupants have been obtained in a typical crash of an H-25A Piasecki helicopter. 3. On the basis of this test for an H -25 aircraft accident involving an impact in a 3-point attitude at 30 mph, in both the horizontal and vertical directions, peak accelerations may be expected to be of the order of : Airframe: Vertical acceleration at the floor - 100g +. Horizontal acceleration at the floor - 50g. For a Normally Seated Pilot or Copilot: Vertical pelvic acceleration - 60g. Longitudinal pelvic acceleration - 25-40g. For a Normally Seated Passenger: Vertical pelvic acceleration - 50g*. Longitudinal pelvic acceleration - 35g*. 4. Pilot, copilot, and troop seats, designed to present military standards, can be expected to fail in this aircraft in accidents of this, and probably even less severity, in- cluding potentially survivable accidents in which category the test crash described in this paper falls. 5. The peak vertical acceleration pulses recorded in the occupiable area of the H-25 aircraft in this test were rel- atively large in comparison with those recorded in the cabin area of fixed -wing aircraft which were subjected to crash tests by NACA. 6. The installation of the experimental range -extender tanks in service aircraft should be made in only those re- gions of the airframe which will allow maximum isolation of the tank from the structure in event of accident.

The extensive failure of the seam between the two halves of the tank suggests that further study and devel- opment of these devices is needed. 7. A comparison of the vertical acceleration-time his- tories for the pilot and passenger chest regions with known human tolerance limits shows that improvements in seat de- sign are needed to reduce the injury producing potential of these vertical accelerations in helicopter accidents involv- ing moderate to high rates of descent at impact.
