<plain_text><page sequence="1">The theology of al-A sh'ari, by Dr. R. J. McCarthy, S.J. Beirut: Imprimerie Catho- lique, 1953. 275 pages in English; IO9 in Arabic. [Distributed in the United States by the Weston College Library, Weston, Mass.] Cloth $5.00; paper $4.00. Reviewed by A. S. Tritton Muslim theology is a development of ideas found in the Qur'an, but it has never escaped from the circumspection of words. To take only one example, God is said to have hands so Muslims insist on taking this literally, though His hands are not as man's; the theologians refuse to consider the word as an attempt to express in human language the activity of that Lord on whose transcendence they lay such emphasis. Orthodoxy is an attempt to keep midway between a rational interpretation of God and a crude anthropomorphism. Al- Ash'ari is regarded as the author of that system of theology which, after much opposition, ousted all others; but little is known about him, most of his writings are lost, and it is doubtful how much of the system is due to him and how much to his followers. The present volume contains two works with translations, Kitab al-luma' and Risalat istihsan al-khawd fi 'ilmn al-kalam. The former covers the whole field of theology sketchily, being arranged as question or objection and answer. The latter, a pamphlet, is a vindica- tion of theology. Dr. McCarthy's volume also contains an abridged translation of a history of the school of al-Ash'ari, a list of his works,</page><page sequence="2">228 THE MIDDLE EAST JOURNAL and two forms of his creed. Dr. McCarthy has produced a good book, beautifully printed, and with all the necessary helps and indices. Another book, Ibana, runs parallel to part of the Luma', but is more discursive and relies largely on tradition, which is rarely quoted in the Luma'. The benediction which follows mention of the prophet in the Luma' is the shorter form, "May God bless' him"; this is a sign of an early date and so, indirectly, of the book's authenticity. In the pamphlet here translated the longer form is used: "May God bless him and give him peace." The longest book by al-Ash'ari which has survived, Maqalat al-islamiyin, is a record of the doctrines of the many sects and contains no constructive thinking. Muslims themselves complained that al-Ash'ari did not compose his books skillfully. He was not a philosopher and his religion was "that of the old women" to use the time-honored phrase -supported by logic rather than by philosophy. Dr. McCarthy treats him too respectfully, using a razor to chop wood, for al-Ash'ari would have stared blankly at some of his comments. Dr. Mc- Carthy does not claim to present the thought of al-Ash'ari as a clear-cut system but he calls at- tention to obscurities and deficiencies. He notes al-Ash'ari's system cannot explain motion (which included change and growth), as il- lustrated by the treatment of divorce and manumission, but this weakness was common to all Muslim thought. Al-Ash'ari has taken over the philosophers' idea of the unmoved mover of all, though in Ibana he quotes the tradition that God comes down to the lowest heaven every night. It is fair to say that Dr. McCarthy is a better philosopher than philologist, though his few emendations to the text are eminently reasonable. The word naqawir in ? I3 seems to be corrupt, for it is not in any dictionary and the form is unusual, yet McCarthy passes over it in the translation without comment. In ? I57 it would be better to read harada, for the root jrd would be used in the intensive form with the corresponding infinitive. In ? I43 the word ytyqwn has no vowels but com- mentators on the Qur'an quote several possi- bilities, all meaning "were able" or "enabled." In ? I45 an yakunu kanu is a future perfect, according to the grammarians, but perhaps al-Ash'ari ignored niceties of grammar. In ? I4 of the Risalah, 'irq has been misread as 'araq; 'irq al-su' is a common expression, "bad strain,") or as we should say, "bad blood." A short search would have shown that the words of the Prophet, "Who infected the first"? are quoted in Lisan al-'arab I9, 266. The editor has not noticed that "worship Me and pray to Me" are quoted in Ibana as words of God. The translation is accurate and as readable as can be expected. In ? 22 the first line is ugly if not unintelligible; "the assertion that an intelligent act proves the existence of knowl- edge" might be better. In ? I90 "belied" is surely a misuse of the word; what is wanted is "did not believe him." Most of the details of the story in ? 157 are in commentaries on the Qur'an; "the wind described her" means blew her dress against her body, revealing her figure, contrary to Muslim modesty. For the same reason puritans objected to people throw- ing water over each other at Nawruz. It was a literary convention to pretend that a book was written at the request of a friend. "He said the morning prayer with the ablution of the previous night" is a stock description of a pious Muslim, suggesting that he had spent the night in prayer. In the summary of the history, Dr. McCarthy has not noticed the error on page I85; al-Shafi'i was dead before the reign of al-Mu'tasim began. On page I97 the point of the story is obscured; it speaks of the virtues of 'Ali in Syria as a doctor treats a hot disease with a cold drug. (3A. S.
