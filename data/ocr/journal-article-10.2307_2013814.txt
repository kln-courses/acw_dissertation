<plain_text><page sequence="1">BEAUTY AND RELIGION 3HE mind of the American novelist, Theodore Dreiser, is torn by the often conflicting demands of beauty, goodness, and truth. Because he has tried to do justice to all three he has offended the puritans of the vinegar-visaged type and the ineffectual esthetes as well. On the other hand, he has been overpraised by his realistic colleagues. The student of contemporary science will see that these apostles of disillusionment are dominated by the scientific traditions of Darwin, Huxley, Tyndall, and Spencer, rather than by the dawn- gleams of Lloyd Morgan, William Patten, Thomas Hunt Morgan, Rutherford, Bragg, and Millikan. The nucleus of Mr. Dreiser's view of nature lies bare in that powerful passage in The Financier which describes a boy's feverish meditations over "the struggle for existence," as staged in a tank in front of a fish-market which he passed by daily. "The lobster lay at the bottom of the clear glass tank on the yellow sand, apparently seeing nothing-you could not tell in which way his beady black buttons of eyes were looking-but apparently they were never off the body of the squid." After days of suspense the boy rushed to the tank just too late to see the end, but in time to hear the comments of more than one bystander, adult but no less boyishly bewildered than he. "It answered in a rough way that riddle which had been annoying him so much in the past: 'How is life organized'?' Things lived on each other-that was it." There is plentiful evidence in A Book about Myself and in an article hardly more than a year old in The American Mercury that Mr. Dreiser himself continues to share young Cowperwood's point</page><page sequence="2">BEAUTY AND RELIGION 655 of view. As a truth-lover he is too reverent of whatever facts he has chanced to find to turn from them to the contemplation of beauty hothoused from the winds and snows. Not so Conrad Aiken, one of America's distinctive contemporary poets. In an article in The New Republic for April 11, 1923, Mr. Aiken justly condemned the literary adjudicators and impressionists for their evasions concern- ing the nature of beauty and proposed an unequivocal esthetics as "A Basis for Criticism.&gt;" Like Dreiser, he finds the universe a sorry place. But, unlike Dreiser, reality does not interest him. Be- cause of "the restrictions of every kind that hem us in," he turns to beauty, the "very essence " of which he conceives to be "illusion." Alas for us, "we come into the world confident of omnipotence," but " daily our power dwindles." Mr. Aiken then defines beauty formally as " the profound satisfaction we feel when, through the medium of fantasy, we escape from imposed limitations into an ag- grandlized personality and a harmonized universe." Let us enlist psychology to correct both the common-sense defini- tion of beauty (which helplessly makes it an indefinable quality in objects independent of ourselves) and Mr. Aiken's swing to a hope- lessly subjective extreme. Psychology divides experience into three closely linked phases cognition (perceiving or identifying objects), affection (vague feelings or definite emotions pleasant or unpleas- ant), and conation (strivings, movements which range from the all but imperceptible strains of eyeball muscles, the tonicity of the muscles of the torso, sub-vocal tensions in the larynx, general bodily postures, variations of respiration, to eating, fighting, fleeing, em- bracing, dancing). Obviously cognition, affection, and conation must all be constituents of every mental experience. But a growing number of students of values esthetic, ethical, and utilitarian, are convinced that the valuing aspect of experience is its conative-affec- tive portion. Thanks to James, Lange, Sutherland, and others, we have come to say that we see and identify a bear (cognition), we start to flee or hide ourselves or stifen into immobility like an inseet "&lt;feigning death" (conation), then a massive reverberation flows back from muscles to glands, blood-vessels, heart, and brain (the affect or emotion), and thus fear lends us wings or paralyzes us (reinforced conation). Now when an object is beautiful it arouses unique conations which may be called empathy (einfiihlung) in justifiable defiance of the etymology which suggests emotions or feelings rather than the move- ments of the external parts of our bodies. These empathic conations are movements by virtue of which we tend to identify ourselves with an object, to become at least metaphoricaly one with it. Thus empathy differs from sympathy, which recognizes keenly our separa-</page><page sequence="3">656 JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY tion from the object which we feel with. Empathy may be imitative, as when before a Doric pillar we stand comfortably erect. Or it may in no manner mimic the object, as when the muscles of the eye- ball twist the lens in zigzag lines leaping athwart the curves of an urn to sweep in the salient features, not langorously following the outline. Or again empathic conations may expand into a dance, either pantomimic and so imitative, or ecstatic and so not imitative at all. To the conception of the advocates of this revised and be- havioristic theory of empathy we may weld the theory of "senti- ments." As the empathic conations begin, our organisms are flooded by a symphonic reverberation of several emotions, perhaps two, per- haps eight or ten, perhaps synchronous, perhaps in rapid succession, but always centering about the emotion of love in the most primitive and the most inclusive sense of the word. This "sentiment," as Professor McDougall would call it, reinforces our empathic cona- tions until verily we have lost ourselves to save ourselves in our de- lighted non-possessive contemplation of the object. Now the object, to arouse such a complicated response, must have a more or less complicated arrangement of details, a form which unifies without annihilating the variety; or we must perceptually select from the chaotic details of our object a pattern which will inspire us to iden- tify ourselves with it. Beauty is neither a quality in the object nor in the fantasy of the beholder. Like all values it is a relation. Beauty is our marriage with the object which we call beautiful. An object is beautiful when it has form in actuality or potentiality and when it arouses in us a sentiment which centers in love and when it arouses the unique conations called empathy. And when that object is such a comprehensive substance or process in nature that we may with William James cry out, "All is not vanity in the universe whatever the appearances may suggest," then our esthetic contemplation, not merely reposeful nor militant, but a delicate blend of both, is the attitude which has always been the goal of mysticism confirmed and reconfirmed in all religions before they fall prey to the letter: But is the marriage called beauty made in heaven? Does beauty rebelliously falsify a tyrant nature as Conrad Aiken thinks? Is the fundamental tendency of reality, as Theodore Dreiser infers, ruthlessly competitive, engendering fear, hate, avarice, or at best pity among a few enlightened and stoical spectators? Does the fable of the lobster and the squid sum up the most fund- amental of the evolutionary tendencies? Far be it from scientist, artist, or religious seer to make light of the reality and ubiquity of evils. Competition, repulsion, fear, suspicion, anger, jealousy, greed, and hatred flourish among men and have their foreshadowings</page><page sequence="4">BEAUTY AND RELIGION 657 throughout the length and breadth of nature. Even electrons act at times as if they were stirred by motives not dissimilar. Let us never forget all this. But to the contemporary investigator of or- ganic evolution competition does not appear to be the most funda- mental tendency. According to Thomas Hunt Morgan in his Criti- que of the Theory of Evolution, Mendel's researches have led us to a view which differs "somewhat . . . from the old idea of a ferocious struggle between the individuals of a species . . . Evolution assumes a more peaceful aspect. New advantageous" characteristics, quali- ties, or trends "survive by incorporating themselves into the race, improving it and opening to it new opportunities. " William Patten, in The Grand Strategy of Evolution, does not hestitate to describe both organic and inorganic evolution as fundamentally more co- operative than competitive. "Progressive union and stability, pro- gressive co6peration, organization, service and discipline are . . . in- herent properties of life and matter. . . . Light and gravity, vitality, genes and gemules, heredity, intelligence, 'selection,' social contact, and all the rest of the growth-machinery of life portrayed by the phy- sicists and biologists may be regarded as local, or special manifes- tations of a common creative agency." In extending his interpretation of living things to include non- living has our second biological authority turned myth-maker? No. To the physicist who deals with the most minute particles of inor- ganic as well as organic matter, the atoms and their constituent elec- trons and protons clearly attract each other more or less. There is also repulsion. Atoms are not to be coerced into molecular organ- ization. They have their autonomy. But atoms are not to be found alone, nor electrons, except at most for the briefest of periods when they are travelling at marvellous velocities which are soon tempered by friction. Fearful of anthropomorphism, Frederick Soddy would call these tendencies "tractation" and "pellation." But a rose by any name smells as sweet and evil called error is just as tragic. Science has done well to discipline us against reading our own feel- ings into objects. But science has never proved that the animist is wholly wrong as well as naive. What if in its zeal to save us from anthropomorphism science should one day blind us to those similari- ties which, indeed, Haeckel did find in atoms and lovers and poets? But science is too cautious ever to go blindly astray in a perverse anti-anthropomorphism. In fact, one chemist and biologist, Law- rence J. Henderson, has been of late arguing somewhat for a "bi- ocentric universe," wherein the material environment adapts itself to living things no less surely than living matter adapts itself to its inorganic milieu. In Concerning the Nature of Things by the emin- ent physicist, Sir William Bragg, we may read of astonishingly subtle</page><page sequence="5">658 JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY reciprocities and sharings of atoms. The chlorine atom, because it has seven planetary electrons in its outermost shell or ring, seeks to add another, while sodium, since it has but one in the same ring, is careless of it. Now all atoms in their normal state contain a per- fect balance of positively-charged protons and negatively-charged electrons. Consequently, when chlorine secures this extra electron it is negatively charged and presumably more restless than ever, while sodium, now minus its one straying outermost electron, has become positively charged. But if the negatively-charged chlorine atom and the positively-charged sodium atom enter into relations as a molecule of everyday table salt, that molecule has as a whole the normal balance of electrons and protons. Sodium has easily re- nounced one electron and chlorine has no longer those restless prop- erties which make it so poisonous to man. Atoms do not combine in- discriminately, to be sure. It is not easy to coerce them. But they do not brook loneliness. "Besides this give-and-take arrangement" which characterizes chlorine, sodium, and various other kinds of atoms, "there is another method," writes Bragg, "by which atoms seek to complete their external groups; they may share electrons with one another, each being capable, apparently, of counting them in its own structure. . . . In the diamond . . . each carbon atom is surrounded by further carbon atoms, with each of which it shares two electrons. So each carbon atom is provided with an external shell of eight electrons none of which it has to itself. This kind of com- bination is very strong." We must not forget the many atomic and molecular repulsions and the struggles between atomic velocities and gravitational pulls when these particles are in liquid or gaseous states. But atoms and molecules do not remain alone. Attraction, then, is fundamental. It is not a wild fancy to envisage the universe as saturated with an immanent love, not necessarily omnipotent, but slowly prevailing. And we have spoken of love as the central emo- tion of the esthetic sentiment. And those empathic conations that merge the art-lover with the masterpiece he enjoys or the artist with the piece of nature which he refashions, those movements of the orchestral conductor which unite him with the symphony which he interprets and with the audience who listens, are not all such em- pathic conations, a search for those movements in nature which even- tuate in unions and free associations? Moreover, when we think of molecules drawing together towards the solid state in those intricate and lovely patterns which we know as crystals in snow-flake and salt and diamond and Damascus blade, we see that in microcosmic activities, as well as in the macrocosmic making of solar systems, nature is everywhere engaged in form- making. In a crystal, as Bragg tells us, "the molecules lie side by</page><page sequence="6">BEAUTY AND RELIGION 659 side in an ordered array. The point is of fundamental importance. Order and regularity are the consequence of the complete fulfillment of the attractions which the atoms or molecules exert upon one an- other. When the structure has grown to a size which renders it visible in the microscope, or even to the naked eye, the regularity is manifest in the form of a solid body: it is what we call a crystal. It is bounded by a number of plane faces often highly polished in appearance, so that the crystal has a certain charm due partly to glitter and sparkle, partly to perfect regularity of outline. We feel that some mystery and beauty must underlie the characteristics that please us, and indeed that is the case." The staggering versatility of living things in evolving further this fundamental form-making tendency in simple cells, in the segmentation of ova, in skin and nerve and muscle and bone tissues and in shells, has received pano- ramic treatment, mathematical and biological, in D 'Arcy Wentworth Thompson's Growth and Form, wherein the author is led to the re- flection that "the biologist, as well as the philosopher, learns to recognize that the whole is not merely the sum of its parts. It is this and much more than this. For it is not a bundle of parts but an organization of parts in their mutual arrangement, fitting with one another in what Aristotle calls 'a single and indivisible principle of unity.' The artist who makes still more complicated forms and the beauty-lover who remakes them in enjoying them are not there- fore indulging in esoteric and exotic practices. Art is not wholly artificial; it is fundamentally natural. Would that both the com- placent philistine and the pejoristic or pessimistic artist could ap- preciate this! No wonder we lack a Virgil, a Dante, a Goethe, a Dostoyevsky when men of letters describe beauty as essentially il- lusion and leave it to Mr. Thompson to write like this: "The har- mony of the world is made manifest in Form and Number. ... A greater than Verhaeren had this in mind when he told of 'the golden compasses, prepared in God's eternal store.' A greater than Milton had magnified the theme and glorified Him 'who sitteth upon the circle of the earth,' saying: 'He measureth the waters in the hollow of his hands, he meteth out the heavens with his span, he com- prehendeth the dust of the earth in a measure.' " Long ago Aristotle associated forms somehow with souls. And today certain biologists, psychologists, and philosophers are recall- ing his phrases as they turn from the warped solutions of material- ists, spiritualists, and extreme dualists, which from Descartes on have made the study of mind-matter and mind-body problems so unprogressive. Aristotle, however, was not quite so headlong as some of his twentieth-century followers. He seems, at times, to speak of the soul as form and no more, as the impression on the wax to the</page><page sequence="7">660 JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY wax itself, as vision to the eye. But for him the soul seems also to be a sort of vital principle making matter into individual things. To have form, he thought, matter must fulfill its purpose. Is soul nothing but form in some external sense, mere outline, or is there something immanent in individuals and 'in the universe at large? In either case it seems likely that our position would not be remote from either Aristotle or modern science if we declared to philistine, to esthete, to literary realist, and literary naturalist that the experi- ence of beauty which makes and enjoys forms is no bizarre and parasitic supererogation, but a normal extension of that soul-making tendency throughout nature which is driven by love to reorganize the haphazard bombardments of gaseous particles torn by their conifict between movement and mutual attraction, to transform the vast and tenuous nebulte into rhythmical solar-systems, and to lure the groping unielular organsms from vaguely engulfing each other to conjugate, to cling together, to form tissues and organs, of which the culmimation is the nervous system, making possible for man the life of reason. And while the literary men are still dominated by the outposts of Huxley's nineteenth-century vision, the reverent but forward-looking pupil of Huxley, Lloyd Morgan, brings together his Hfelong biological, psychological, and philosophical researches in Emergent Evolution, wherein he writes of the universe as a pyramid near the base of which "is, a swarm of atoms with relational struc- ture. . . . Above this level, atoms combine to form new units," molecules, while "higher up, on one line of advance, are, let us say, crystals wherein atoms and molecules are grouped in new relations of which the expression is the crystalline form; on another line of advance are organisms with a different kind of natural relations which give the quality of vitality" and so evolve with still higher "emergences " of new powers to give us human personalities. "Within us if anywhere, " reflects Morgan, " we must feel the urge," the activity, the " Nisus " which we can see saturating everything else. "What then does it feel like ? Each must answer for himself, fully realizing that he may misinterpret the evidence. Without denying a felt push from the lower levels of one's being-a so-called driving force welling up from below-to me it feels like a drawing upwards through Activity existent at a higher level than that to which I have attained." And this faithful and rigorous scientist- philosopher, who as a youth was sent on to this research by the agnostie Huxley with a magnanimous benediction, this pupil loyal not to the letter, but to the spirit of his eminent master, has come to feel that the Nisus in nature which wells up from below and draws us from above must be recognized as God. A nisus, says the dictionary, is a "conative state." And what are those empathic</page><page sequence="8">BEAUTY AND RELIGION 661 conations in the experience of beauty by which we seek to become one with the object we contemplate unless they are the rhythmic tendency to bring our energies into harmony with God's ways? Aristotle conceived of the soul as the form or form-maker which individualizes matter and gives it existence. Individuality has seemed always difficult to define. But a survey of the various at- tempts now available and the influence of the evolutionary point of view would lead us, perhaps, to conclude that everywhere individual- ity is more a matter of degree than of absolute attainment and that in their evolution beings seek to attain and to reconcile (1) indivisi- bility, (2) integration or unity and diversity, (3) uniqueness or variability, and (4) permanence. Electrons and protons (if they are the simplest of things and if we know them at all) are indivisible and permanent. But they are hardly unique, because all electrons are like electrons and all protons are like all protons. And since both are perhaps nothing but ether-vortices, one turning one way, the other the reverse, they are too simple to claim integration. When they join together as atoms they attain integration, for their nuclei and elec- tron-rings present unity and variety. And they gain in uniqueness; there are some ninety-two different kinds of atoms or "elements." But indivisibility and permanence have to some extent been sacri- ficed as radioactivity reveals. We can not divide them. But at times they explode. At the molecular stage there are further gains in integration and uniqueness. There are chain structures and ring structures and protein molecules of hundreds of atoms. And there are subtle variabilities, as in the case of diverse activities of ether and of ethyl alcohol molecules, which are made of the same kinds and proportions of atoms, but which are so arranged that they are very different substances. But molecules are more divisible than ever. Even a human chemist can break them down. And in nature they are often very evanescent. In the living unicellular creature there are vast gains in integration, considerable recovery of permanence, but no marked recovery of indivisibility and no striking gain in variability. In multicellular organisms there is a progressive gain in indivisibility until man will part readily with little more than with bits of his skin. But there is some loss of permanence. In- tegration grows more elaborate by leaps and bounds and variability becomes incalculably great. We find the integration of nervous systems. We behold the variability of geniuses. Sometimes in- tegration seems to overlap itself, as in the crustacean, in whom the muscular segments are so united within an external shell as to make him sluggish. Now motility, exploration of environment, is a great source of uniqueness. So it is not surprising that when the verte- brates so developed their bony structures as not to impede their</page><page sequence="9">662 JOURNAL OP PHILOSOPHY muscular versatility there was an immense recovery of variability due almost as much to motility as to a highly evolved nervous sys- tem. The development of sex, too, with its sorting and resorting and blending of diverse germ-plasms, lends itself powerfully to uniqueness. With the emergence of the mammals life became mind- ful of permanence and the suckling of the young broadened into an even more elaborate prolongation of infancy and the triumph of the ideal of education. With this recovery of permanence, at least as an ideal, man has come at last to dream of immortality and perchance actually does survive death if he is loyal enough to the great task of form-making and form-enjoying. Such a survival may be more than the mere survival of influence. It may be a strictly personal sur- vival in what Josiah Royce loved to call the "beloved Community." Thus individuality, which needs indivisibility, integration, unique- ness, and permanence, appears to evolve, sometimes at the cost of one essential, sometimes at the cost of another, but cumulatively on the whole towards a realization and increase of all four properties. And since with each new level new and unpredictable powers have emerged (if we are to believe a growing number of scientists and philosophers who in some measure share the views of Lloyd Morgan) so man the artist, when dominated by empathy and a sentiment which centers in love, seems in his form-making to have reached the far- thest-flung frontiers of evolution, mindful of the ways of God and at- taining with a steadily emerging freedom to a new power which is a continuance into eternity of form-making and form-enjoying, the power of immortality.
