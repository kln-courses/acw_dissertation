<plain_text><page sequence="1">28o THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY FUNCTIONAL EXPLANATIONS IN BIOLOGY As I mentioned in the first, lecture, this second one will deal mainly with teleological explanations in biology. However, since the struc- ture of explanations for goal-directed processes has already been described, the task that remains is to examine explanations in that subclass of teleological explanations usually designated as func- tional. I must therefore make clear what I understand by func- tional explanations. Functional explanations are most easily described by distinguish- ing them from functional statements on the basis of differences in grammatical structure and with the help of some examples. A func- tional statement ascribes a function to some object or process, as in assertions like "The function of gills in fish is respiration," or "One function of white blood cells (leucocytes) in human bodies is to defend the body against invading microorganisms." On the other hand, a functional explanation does not explicitly ascribe a function to anything-indeed, it does not contain the word 'func- tion'-but accounts for the presence of some item in a system (or states why the item is there) in terms of the contributions the item makes to, or in terms of certain effects the item produces in, the system of which it is a component-as in the assertions "Fish have gills in order to obtain oxygen" or "Human blood contains leuco- cytes for the sake of defending the body against invading bacteria." There are a number of divergent analyses of functional explana- tions, the differences being often attributable to different concep- tions of what it is to be a function in biology. In consequence, an examination of proposed accounts of functional explanations is bound to go hand in hand with an assessment of different explica- tions of the notion of function. I want to discuss several types of such explications that have received some attention in the recent literature. The first type is a teleologically neutral definition of the notion of function-I will refer to it as the "neutral" view-such as the one proposed by Professors Walter Bock and Gerd von Wahlert. Ac- cording to them, the function of a given item in an organism is the set of all the manifest as well as dispositional properties (in- cluding the physicochemical ones) the item exhibits in diverse circumstances, properties that the item possesses in virtue of its components and their arrangement.' It is evident that the attribu- 1 "Adaptation and the Form-Function Complex," Evolution, xix (1965): 274.</page><page sequence="2">FUNCTIONAL EXPLANATIONS IN BIOLOGY 28i tion of a function to an entity, in this sense of 'function', like the ascription of mass or velocity to an object in physics, has no teleo- logical connotations. Explanations of the presence of functions so defined, will therefore have the same structure as explanations in the physical sciences, and raise no issues that are distinctive of biological inquiry. However, Bock and von Wahlert themselves note that their def- inition of 'function' does not express what is perhaps the generally accepted and most wide-spread sense of the word. In fact, they graft that customary meaning of 'function' on the term 'biological role', so that in many contexts the word 'function' in its familiar meaning can be used interchangeably with the phrase 'biological role'. For they define the biological role of a faculty in an orga- nism as "the action or use of the faculty by the organism in the course of its life history." For example, the biological role of the large mucus glands of gray jays is said to be the use of those glands "as a glue to cement food particles together into a food bolus which is then stuck to the branches of trees" (278). Accordingly, questions that may be generated in attempts to clarify the nature of explanations of biological roles-for example, under what con- ditions an item can properly be said to have a biological role, or what is the objective of explanations of biological roles-appear to be quite similar to questions raised in the analysis of functional explanations (in the familiar sense of 'function'). II A second type of explication of the notion of biological function is based on the assumption that the primary meaning of any teleo- logical term is the one it has when used in statements about actions that are directed by purposive agents toward achieving selected ends. Although this view resembles in some respects the account of goal-directed processes that was designated as the intentional view, the view to be examined is sufficiently different from the intentional view to require independent discussion. I will refer to it as the "selective agency" view. According to it, teleological char- acterizations of nonhuman behavior constitute a "metaphorical ex- tension" of anthropomorphic concepts. In consequence, when the term 'function' is employed in contexts in which human intentions are irrelevant (as when the natural function of the heartbeat in vertebrates is said to be the circulation of the blood), there must be strong analogies with uses of the word in contexts in which some item has been deliberately instituted or selected to behave in some specified manner (as when the governor on a steam engine is</page><page sequence="3">282 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY said to have the conscious function of regulating the speed with which the engine works). The natural function of an item is there- fore not any effect of the item's presence; it is that particular effect for the production of which the item had been selected. I will waive the question as not strictly relevant to the present discussion, whether it is in fact the case that the use of teleological language in nonhuman contexts is a metaphorical extension of its alleged primary use in connection with the pursuit of conscious ends. The question that is relevant is whether an account of func- tional explanations in biology is sound, when the account rests squarely on the supposition that there must be strong analogies between teleological characterizations of human and nonhuman behaviors. A number of such analyses have been proposed, but there is time for discussing only one of them. In a recent book,2 Professor Larry Wright offers an account of functional explanations that is admittedly based on the assump- tion that there is such an analogy. He points out that in the case of so-called "conscious functions"-that is, functions assigned to artifacts by their conscious makers-some entity i (which may be an object, property, or process) is "introduced" into, or is identi- fied in, a system S. for the sake of the effects or consequences F that i produces in S. Thus, a governor is introduced into, or made part of, an engine in such a way that the spreading and retraction of the arms of the governor affect the speed with which the driving wheel rotates. More generally, the function of an item i in system S is an effect F that i produces. However, the function of i is not any effect; it is that effect for the sake of which the item i was selected and placed in the position it actually does have. The governor of an engine produces a variety of effects: it adds to the weight of the engine, it reflects light that would otherwise have traveled in some other direction, it makes sounds when it is spinning rapidly, and it regulates the speed of the engine. Not everyone of these effects is the function of the governor; its function is that effect for the sake of which the governor was constructed and made part of the engine in just the position it actually has. In consonance with his view on the primary context of teleologi- cal language, Wright believes that explanations of natural func- tions have the same pattern as do explanations of conscious ones. According to him, therefore, to say that the function of the heart- beat in vertebrates is to circulate the blood, is to say two things: 2 Teleological Explanations (Berkeley: Univ. of California Press, 1976).</page><page sequence="4">FUNCTIONAL EXPLANATIONS IN BIOLOGY 283 first, that the circulation of the blood is an effect or consequence of the heartbeat taking place in the organism; and second, that the heart is present in the animal and engaged in the activity of beat- ing, just because it circulates the blood by beating. However, beat- ing hearts do not exist in vertebrates because they were placed there by some human agent who selected them for their ability to circulate the blood. If we exclude the possibility of divine inter- vention, they occupy the place they do in vertebrates because of the operation of natural selection. Wright's analysis of functional explanations therefore yields the following abstract pattern: A functional explanation of the form "The item i is in system S in order to do F" [whose content is the same as that of the functional statement "The function (or a func- tion) of item i in system S is F"] is equivalent to the conjunction of two statements having the forms: "F is a consequence of i's pres- ence in S" and "The item i is in S just because F is a consequence of i's presence in S." This analysis is said to be adequate for both natural and conscious functions, with the understanding that in the case of natural functions, natural selection takes the place of conscious choice. Wright thus proposes what he takes to be a "causal" analysis of functional explanations. It is said to be a causal analysis, because the causal relation between the item i and its effect F allegedly "plays a role" in bringing about the presence of i in the system S (ibid., 22). However, Wright is very careful to point out that when a function is ascribed to a particular item (e.g., to the heartbeat of President Ford's heart at noon on Election Day in 1976), it is not the existence of this particular item at the stated time that is ex- plained by the fact that the presence of item i in S on that occasion produces F. Or stating this point in terms of the example, it is not the existence of President Ford's heart at noon on Election Day that is explained by the fact that the beating of his heart at that time produced the circulation of his blood on that occasion. It would be patently false if not absurd to assert the contrary. Wright's claim seems to be that the existence of hearts in general (that is, the existence of that type of organ) is explained by the fact that organisms with hearts that circulate the blood are more likely to survive and reproduce than organisms with hearts that do not do so-in short, that organisms with beating hearts that circulate the blood have an advantage in the evolutionary process. Or again stating this in terms of the example, on the construal just presented of Wright's claim, President Ford has a beating</page><page sequence="5">284 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY heart in his body, because his ancestors had beating hearts that circulated their blood-a circumstance that gave them an advan- tage for survival. The outcome of Wright's analysis is that when we ascribe a function to an item, we are at the same time explain- ing why that item is present in the system and occupies the place in the system that it actually does. However, Wright's proposed explication raises some problems. (i) His analysis requires us to say that F is a function of an item i if and only if the item had been selected in some way to be present in the organism just because F is an effect of i's presence. It there- fore follows that F can be asserted to be a function of i, if and only if it is known (or there are good reasons for believing) both that F is an effect of i and that i had been selected to be present in the organism just because F is an effect of the item i. In fact, however, biologists commonly do state (often on the basis of experimental findings) that a function of some item i in organism S is F, but without knowing or believing that one causal determinant of i's presence in S is that F is an effect of i. For example, when William Harvey showed that one function of the heartbeat is to circulate the blood, he was unfamiliar with the etiology of the heart's for- mation, or with any causal determinants of the heart's presence in vertebrates. Nor is there any evidence to show that when Walter Cannon ascribed to the adrenal medula, on experimental grounds, the function of accelerating the heart's action in circumstances of emergency for the organism, he believed that the gland having this effect is a causal determinant of the gland's presence in the orga- nism. Such examples can be easily multipled, and are grounds for skepticism concerning the adequacy of Wright's analysis of func- tional explanations. (ii) But the main reason for doubting the soundness of his anal- ysis is the questionable validity of Wright's central claim that a functionally characterized item is "where it is," because the item has that function. In the first place, the claim is mistaken even in the case of conscious functions. Consider, for example, the func- tional statement that the function of the main spring in a watch is to provide power for rotating various cogwheels in the watch. On Wright's analysis, this is equivalent to saying that the spring does have this effect, and also that the spring is where it is because the spring has that effect. However, the second clause of the al- legedly equivalent statement is surely an error. The spring was placed where it is by the manufacturer not because the spring is able to rotate wheels (as is required by Wright's analysis), but</page><page sequence="6">FUNCTIONAL EXPLANATIONS IN BIOLOGY 285 because the manufacturer knew or believed that this was so. For springs of the required sort possess that capacity whether or not anyone knows or believes this; and a spring does not appear in a watch simply as a consequence of its possessing that capacity. It is rather the manufacturer's knowledge that a spring does have the capacity which accounts in part for the spring being "where it is." In the second place, the claim is incorrect when made for nat- ural functions. To be correct, the presence of beating hearts in vertebrates must be accounted for by assuming that vertebrates whose hearts circulate the blood have been "selected" for survival by natural selection just because their hearts circulate the blood. However, in the present context the claim can be understood in two ways, each of which requires attention. On one interpretation, the claim is about the causal conditions for the existence of a particular heart at a stated time in a given organism. We do not at present know in sufficient detail just how the heart is formed in the development of a specified organism from a fertilized egg. But we do know that the organism has a heart because the zygote from which it developed was "programmed" to grow one-that is, we know that the zygote has a definite physicochemical composition such that, in consequence, and under normal environmental con- ditions, numerous (but still largely unknown) physicochemical pro- cesses take place whose outcome is the heart. It is therefore evident that neither conscious nor natural selection plays a role in the genesis of a particular heart. Nor is there any reason for believing that the heart's causal role in circulating the blood needs to be invoked in accounting for the presence of a particular heart in a given body. On the second interpretation of the claim under discussion (namely, that vertebrates with hearts exist because hearts produce the circulation of blood), the claim is about the causal conditions for the existence of hearts in the vertebrates that have them. Wright believes that the analysis of explanations in this case closely parallels the analysis of explanations in the case of con- scious functions. As he puts it, "just as conscious functions provide a consequence-etiology [that is, behavior that occurs because it brings about some specified end] by virtue of conscious selection, natural functions provide the very same sort of etiology as a result of natural selection" (38 and 84). The claim is thus made to rest on a reading of the theory of evolution according to which verte- brates with beating hearts exist, because only those vertebrates have been selected to survive by natural selection whose beating</page><page sequence="7">286 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY hearts circulate the blood. Wright therefore concludes that func- tional explanations, whether the functions are conscious or nat- ural, all have the same structure. Moreover, since in either case consequence etiologies are asserted, functional explanations are said to be of a distinctive kind, and are not translatable into ex- planations of the sort customary in the physical sciences. But is it really the case that natural selection operates, as Wright apparently believes, so as to generate consequence-etiologies-that is, to produce organs of a particular kind just because the presence of such organs in the organisms in which they are components gives rise to certain effects? As I see it, to suppose that this is so is to do violence to the currently accepted neo-Darwinian theory of evolution. At the risk of carrying coals to Newcastle, it may be helpful to spell out my reasons for this assertion. According to that theory, which heritable traits sexually reproducing organisms pos- sess, depends on the genes organisms carry-genes that either are inherited from parent organisms or are mutant forms of inherited genes. Which of its genes an organism transmits to its progeny, is determined by random processes that take place during the meiosis and fertilization of the sex cells. It is not determined by the effects that the genes produce in either the parent or daughter organisms. Moreover, mutation of genes-the ultimate source of evolutionary novelty-also occurs randomly. Genes do not mutate in response to the needs an organism may acquire because of environmental changes; and which genes mutate, as well as what alterations take place in a gene when it mutates, are independent of the effects a gene-mutation may produce in the next generation of organisms. Furthermore, natural selection "operates" on individual organisms, not upon the genes they carry; and whether an organism survives to reproduce itself, does not depend on whether it has traits that would be advantageous to it in some future environment. Natural selection is not literally an "agent" that does anything. It is a com- plicated process, in which organisms possessing one assortment of genetic materials may contribute more, in their current environ- ment, to the gene pool of its species than is contributed by other members of the species with different genotypes. In short, natural selection is "selection" in a Pickwickian sense of the word. There is nothing analogous to "foresight" in its "op- eration": it does not account for the occurrence of organisms with novel genotypes; it does not control environmental changes that may affect the chances organisms have of reproducing their kind; and it does not preserve organisms that have traits which are dis-</page><page sequence="8">FUNCTIONAL EXPLANATIONS IN BIOLOGY 287 advantageous to the organisms in their present environment, but which may be advantageous to them in different environments. The term 'natural selection' is thus not a name for some individ- ual object. It is a label for continuing sequences of environmental and genetic changes in which, partly because of the genetically determined traits organisms possess, one group of organisms is more successful, in a given environment, than are other groups of organisms of the species in reproducing their kind and in contrib- uting to the gene pool of the species. For these reasons, Wright's analysis of functional explanations in biology seems to me to be untenable. Before leaving the subject of natural selection, it is only fair to add that the supposition that natural selection is more than a negative "sifting" process, and is "creative" in "directing" genetic changes, is endorsed by distinguished students of organic evolu- tion. For example, the late Professor Theodosius Dobzhansky dis- agreed strongly with those biologists who "doubted that natural selection can be the guiding agent in evolution because selection, allegedly, produces nothing new and merely removes from the pop- ulation degenerate variants and malformations." 3 He maintained that although the raw materials of evolution are the genotypes that arise by gene and chromosome mutation and recombination, never- theless "it is selection which gives order and shape to the genetic variability, and directs it into adaptive channels" (131). Indeed, he went on to say that "It is fair to say that selection produces new genotypes, even though we know that the immediate causes of the origin of all genotypes are mutation and reproduction.... In the long run, selection is the directing agent because it determines which genotypes are available for new mutations to occur in." 4 A more moderate presentation of the "agent" conception of nat- ural selection is given by Professor Ernst Mayr. "Evolution is not an all-or-none process," he writes. "Genetic variation is enormous and does not consist merely in the production of a few new types; it 'selects' them precisely in the same way in which a breeder 'selects' the founder individuals for the next generation of breed- ing. This is a thoroughly positive process; inferior zygotes are simply lost. We do not hesitate to call a sculptor creative, even though he discards chips of marble. As soon as selection is defined as differential reproduction, its creative aspects become evident. 8 Evolution, Genetics, and Man (New York: Wiley, 1955), p. 130. 4 Ibid., p. 132. Cf. also F. J. Ayala, "Teleological Explanations in Evolu- tionary Biology," Philosophy of Science, xxxvii, 1 (March 1970): 1-15.</page><page sequence="9">288 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY Characters are the developmental products of an intricate inter- action of genes, and since it is selection that 'supervises' the bring- ing together of these genes, one is justified in asserting that selec- tion creates superior new gene combinations." 5 It is little wonder that readers of such passages are persuaded that natural selection is an agent operating in a manner closely similar to the action of a conscious agent, such as the action of an animal breeder. But it is fairly clear that not everything in the quoted passages is intended to be taken literally, as the placing of quotation marks around some of the words in them strongly sug- gests. It is surely not natural selection that literally produces geno- types, for this is done by the mechanisms involved in cell division and reproduction. Nor is it natural selection that does any direct- ing, but it is the environment together with the genotype of an organism which determine whether the organism can survive long enough to reproduce its kind. And it is certainly not the case that natural selection "selects" individuals for survival "precisely in the same way in which a breeder 'selects' the founder individuals for the next generation of breeding." For a breeder deliberately selects the animals he will mate, on the basis of what he knows of the likelihood that the traits for which he is breeding will appear in the next or other future generation of the mated animals. But natural selection has no eye to the future; and if any zygotes are eliminated by natural selection, it is because they are not adapted to their present environment. III I must now turn briefly to an account of the function concept which in one respect is like the view just discussed, but which differs from it in construing functional ascriptions as having a purely methodological or heuristic role. I will refer to it as the "heuristic view" of functional ascriptions. This view resembles the Kantian interpretation of teleological attributions; but it has contemporary adherents as well, and its distinctive thesis can be stated independently of Kant's elaborate conceptual machinery. Kant was an heir to the thought of Descartes and Newton, and subscribed to the principle that all material pro- cesses of nature must be explained by "merely mechanical laws." However, the apparently purposive character of the organization and behavior of living things seemed incapable of being under- 5 Populations, Species, and Evolution (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard, 1963), p. 119.</page><page sequence="10">FUNCTIONAL EXPLANATIONS IN BIOLOGY 289 stood in terms of "the mere mechanical faculty of motion"; 6 and they had to be viewed as if they had been produced by design. Kant therefore formulated a second principle, that some events cannot be explained on the basis of purely mechanical laws. But these two principles appear to be incompatible; and according to Kant, they would indeed be contradictory if they were assertions about the objective constitution of nature. He resolved the antin- omy by construing the principles to be "maxims" or regulative principles for guiding inquiry. According to him, the first prin- ciple does not demand that the events of nature be investigated only within the framework of mechanical laws. On the contrary, accepting that maxim "does not prevent us, if occasion offers, from following out the second maxim in the case of certain natural forms .., in order to reflect upon them according to the principle of final causes." On the other hand, though we may follow the second maxim in dealing with biological phenomena, this does not exclude the possibility that after all living things have been pro- duced in accordance with purely mechanical laws. Indeed, in in- vestigating biological organisms as parts of nature, we must go as far as we can in our efforts to understand them in terms of me- chanical laws; for unless we do so, "there can be no proper knowl- edge of nature at all" (295). The conclusion to be drawn from all this is that since we cannot really understand how final causes operate except in the case of our own actions, ascriptions of goals and functions to nonhuman organisms and their parts cannot be taken literally, as objective assertions about nature. They must be construed as statements that have only a heuristic value in guiding inquiry into the mechanisms of living organisms (279-281). Something like Kant's views on this subject is also present in C. D. Broad's definition of teleology. "Suppose," he wrote, "that a system is composed of such parts arranged in such ways as might have been expected if it had been constructed by an intelligent being to fulfil a certain purpose which he had in mind. And sup- pose that, when we investigate the system more carefully under the guidance of this hypothesis, we discover hitherto unnoticed parts or hitherto unnoticed relations between the parts, and that these are still found to accord with the hypothesis. Then I should call this system 'teleological'." 7 Broad believed that living organisms 6 The Critique of Judgement, J. H. Bernard, trans. (London: Macmillan, 1931), p. 278. 7 The Mind and Its Place in Nature (London: Paul, Trench, Trubner, 1925), p. 82.</page><page sequence="11">290 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY are teleological systems in the sense of his definition. However, he also maintained that the "intelligent being" needed to design and produce the complex systems that constitute living organisms, would have to possess powers of intellect far beyond anything dis- played by minds with which we are familiar. It is therefore un- clear just what is assumed in the hypothesis that enters into Broad's definition of teleological systems-that is, it seems impos- sible for minds like our own to know what would be the arrange- ment of parts of organisms that such a superhuman intelligence instituted to achieve his purposes. It is in consequence also unclear how Broad could have known that living organisms really are teleological systems. Both Kant and Broad were therefore agnostics about the literal truth of any functional ascription. In both cases, the agnosticism has its source in the assumptions that a process cannot properly be characterized as purposive, if it can be explained on the basis of physicochemical laws, and that an effect of an organic process can count as one of its biological functions only if that process was intended or designed to produce the stated effect. Agnosticism con- cerning the truth of function ascriptions seems to be the price that must be paid for explicating the notion of biological function in terms of conscious intent. But if the notion of being a function can be explicated, as I believe it can be, with no reference to the intentions or choices of conscious organisms, the validity of ascrib- ing a function to an entity can be decided by empirical inquiry, without any need for the elaborate make-believe that seems to be an inseparable accompaniment of the heuristic view. IV An explication of the notion of biological function that seems far more plausible than those discussed thus far, rests on the assump- tion that functions contribute to the "welfare" (in a sense to be specified) of either individual organisms, or populations of orga- nisms, or the species to which an organism belongs. I will call it the "welfare" view of biological functions. There are several vari- eties of this view; and commenting on two of them will enable me to state my own views on the subject more clearly. (a) Perhaps the best known and most carefully articulated cri- tique of functional explanations is that of Professor Carl Hempel. Since his evaluation of them has been highly influential, it is ap- propriate to examine his analysis once more. His analysis is quite familiar to students of the subject; a brief summary of the salient points in his account will therefore suffice.</page><page sequence="12">FUNCTIONAL EXPLANATIONS IN BIOLOGY 29I According to Hempel, the cognitive content of the functional statement "The function of the heartbeat in vertebrates is the cir- culation of the blood" is stated more explicitly in the following: "The heartbeat has the effect of circulating the blood, which ensures the satisfaction of certain conditions (e.g., supply of nutriment and removal of wastes) that are necessary for the proper working of the organism." 8 Just what is to be understood by "the proper working of an organism" and by the "certain conditions" that are allegedly required for such working, are important questions; but they can be waived for the present. The basic pattern of a functional state- ment is therefore "The function of item i occurring in organism (or system) S during period t and in environmental setting C, is to do e"; and the schematic form of the import of such statements is "Item i in system S during period t and in environment C, has the effects e that satisfy the conditions n which are necessary for the proper working of S" (306). On the other hand, on the assumption that a functional explana- tion must account for the presence of item i in S-that is, that it must explain why it is that during t and within C, item i is present in S-Hempel proposes the following schematic form for the ex- planatory premises: (i) During period t and in environment C, S is in proper working order. (ii) If S is in proper working order, then condition n must be satisfied. And (iii) if i is present in S., then the effect e of i's presence in S satisfies the required condition n. [Using Hempel's initial example, the explanatory premises for the presence of a heart in a given human body are as follows: (i) During a certain period and under normal environmental conditions, a certain hu- man being is in proper working order. (ii) If that person is in proper working order, then various conditions, such as his having nourish- ment, must be satisfied. And (iii) if the person has a beating heart in his body, the circulation of his blood, which is an effect of the heart's beating, satisfies the required conditions.] However, if this is a correct analysis of functional explanations, the assumed prem- ises do not entail the desired conclusion, and so the presence of item i in organism S is not explained. Hempel points out that the flaw in the argument would be re- moved if the third premise were replaced by its converse (iii')-that is, by a statement of the form: The condition n is satisfied only if item i is present in S. He believes, however, that in general there is no warrant for doing this. Indeed, he thinks that "it might well be 8 Aspects of Scientific Explanation (New York: Free Press, 1965), p. 304.</page><page sequence="13">292 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY that the occurrence of any one of a number of alternatives would suffice no less than the occurrence of i to satisfy n" (310). But if this is so, the explanatory premises fail to explain why it is item i, rather than one of its possible alternatives, that is present in S. Hempel therefore concludes that while functional characterizations may have considerable heuristic merit, they have little if any explanatory or predictive value (313). The main burden of Hempel's devastating critique of functional explanations is that the presence of some specified item in an organism, which is to be explained in terms of its function, is in general not a necessary condition (or is not known to be a necessary condition) for the performance of that function. Accordingly, the presence of a heart in vertebrates is not explained by the fact that it has the effect of circulating the blood, because the heart is not the sole thing that can do this; for example, artificial pumps when properly connected with the blood vessels could also perform this function. It is of course beyond dispute that if the structure of functional explanations is as Hempel describes it, these explanations fail to explain their ostensible explananda. However, it is questionable whether functional explanations, at least in biology, do in general have the form he indicates. For example, a convincing case can be made for the claim that in normal human beings-that is, in human bodies having the organs for which they are at present genetically programmed-the heart is necessary for circulating blood; for in normal human beings there are in fact no alternative mechanisms for effecting the blood's circulation. For physiologists seeking to explain how the blood is circulated in normal human bodies have discovered that human bodies have no organs other than the heart for performing that function. The observation that it may be (or actually is) physically possible to circulate blood by means of other mechanisms is doubtfully relevant to those investigations of how the blood is circulated in normal human beings, upon which physiol- ogists were once embarked. The denial of the claim that the heart is necessary for circulating the blood appears to derive part of its plausibility from the impre- cise way in which the expression 'human body'-and more generally the expression 'the system S'-is usually specified. Is the normal human body to be counted as the same system as the body whose blood is being circulated by a mechanical pump? The issue Hempel's analysis raises is one that has long been discussed in connection with the "doctrine of the plurality of causes." For example, since death can result from drowning, from gun wounds, from poisons, and so</page><page sequence="14">FUNCTIONAL EXPLANATIONS IN BIOLOGY 293 on, it is sometimes said that death has a plurality of causes. But, as has been often noted, the doctrine is plausible in this example, only because the causes of death have been analyzed more precisely and into a larger number of types than has their effect. However, if the state of a body whose death has been caused by drowning is com- pared with a body whose death was the result of gun wounds, it is clear that each of these causes has its own distinctive effect; and it no longer seems so evident that death has many causes. Something like this point seems to be involved in the denial that the heart is necessary for circulation, except that it is the loose way in which the expression 'human body' (or 'the system S') is used that may underlie the denial. It must of course be recognized that there are systems in which several items have a common function, so that no particular member of the set of such items is necessary for performing that function. Human beings normally have two ears, either of which, by itself, is necessary for hearing. Nevertheless, in the normal body it is still necessary that one or the other or both ears be present if the orga- nism is to hear. In such cases, functional explanations account for the presence in the system under discussion of a set of items. It seems to me that Hempel should agree, at least in principle, with this defense of premises in functional explanations which assert that some item in a given system is necessary for the performance of a stated function. Despite his doubts that such premises can be validly asserted, he does assume that there are necessary conditions (such as the elimination of wastes) for the proper working of orga- nisms. He must therefore have had in mind organisms which are actually found in nature in determinate environments and which must satisfy certain conditions if they are to flourish. For if we are free to exercise our imagination and deal with mere possibilities, with no limitations placed on the kinds of organisms that may be considered, organisms can be imagined that produce no waste ma- terials and have, in consequence, no need for eliminating them. However, if necessary conditions can be discovered for the "proper working" of organisms in their natural state, what reasons are there for doubting, on general principle, that certain organs and other parts of organisms may be necessary for the performance of the func- tions that are associated with those organs and parts? In point of fact, examination of standard treatises on the physiology of the hu- man body, shows that the great majority of its organs and parts are necessary for the performance of their several functions. Let me return briefly to Hempel's analysis of functional explana-</page><page sequence="15">294 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY tions. As has already been noted, it was not part of the task he set for himself to provide an adequate account of what is to be under- stood by "the proper working" of an organism, or how the "neces- sary conditions" for such "proper working" are ascertained. Why then did he place a limitation, involving these notions, on the effects of an item that are to count as the item's function? The main reason for his doing this was to exclude as incorrect function ascriptions which, despite the fact that the alleged functions are the effects of stated items, are strongly counterintuitive. Hempel's example of such a counterintuitive statement is: "A function of the heartbeat in human beings is to produce heart sounds." However, the validity of the claim that this statement is a mis- taken attribution of function-as all function ascriptions are alleged to be which identify a function of an item with any of its effects- depends on whether, in a given environment, the production of heart sounds satisfies a necessary condition for the proper working of organisms possessing hearts. It is therefore arguable that although in other environments and other periods heart sounds contributed nothing to the proper working of human beings, this is not true in the present environments of human beings, since heart sounds have a diagnostic value for modern physicians. But be this as it may, the requirement Hempel places on effects if they are to count as func- tions, does enable him to achieve his objective (in principle and at least in part) of excluding as incorrect many counterintuitive at- tributions of function-provided, of course, that saying that an or- ganism is in proper working order is not just another way of saying that the various parts of the organism are performing their functions. To be sure, without a detailed account of what the proper working of an organism is-an account that is bound to require considerable biological, medical, and perhaps even psychological knowledge-it is difficult to apply Hempel's criterion for distinguishing functions from mere effects. On the other hand, just because he leaves largely unspecified what is to be understood by "the proper working" of organisms, his analysis of functional statements has a generality that many other analyses lack. In consequence, many of these other anal- yses can be subsumed under, and regarded as special cases of, Hempel's formulation of the structure of functional explanations. (b) I want now to examine the version of the welfare view of bio- logical function proposed by Professor Michael Ruse.9 He presents his analysis in the context of a critique of some views of my own. 9 The Philosophy of Biology (London: Hutchinson, 1973), ch. 9.</page><page sequence="16">FUNCTIONAL EXPLANATIONS IN BIOLOGY 295 An examination of his statement of the issues will enable me to assess both his own analysis and his criticism of mine. (i) In presenting my views on biological functions which Ruse criticizes, I argued that the statement: "The function of chlorophyll in plants is to enable plants to perform photosynthesis" is equiv- alent to another one that no longer contains any functional terms: "When a plant is provided with water, carbon dioxide, and sun- light, it manufactures starch only if the plant contains chlorophyll." And I added the proviso that functional ascriptions presuppose that, and are appropriate only if, the system under consideration (in the example it is a plant) is "directly organized" or "goal-directed." I also explained that the term 'goal-directed' was to be understood in the sense of the system-property view of the notion of being goal-directed.10 Ruse believes that this account of functional statements is "fun- damentally misconceived," and states two objections to it. The first is directed against the assumption that the presence of chlorophyll in plants is a necessary condition for the performance of photo- synthesis. Neither Ruse nor I think this is a weighty objection, and I have already stated my reasons for believing this. On the other hand, I also think that Ruse may be correct in saying that it is "somewhat unfortunate" I placed so much emphasis on the neces- sity of an item's presence for the performance of a stated function. For the emphasis can be construed as an oversight of cases in which an organism is known to have more than one organ for the performance of a function (as in the case already discussed of orga- nisms having two ears for hearing), as well as an oversight of cases concerning which it may be unknown whether more than one organ is present to perform the function. In such cases, it is not the presence of some single item that is explained, but rather the presence of one or more members of a set of items. An explanan- dum of the latter sort is in a sense weaker than an explanandum consisting of a single item; but though it is weaker, it is not neces- sarily a trivial one. (ii) Ruse's second objection is that the requirement mentioned in my proviso, according to which the use of functional statements presupposes that the systems to which they are applied are goal- directed, is "altogether inappropriate." He offers the following ex- ample in support of this judgment. Suppose it were true that long 10 The Structure of Science (New York: Harcourt, Brace &amp; World, 1961), ch. 12.</page><page sequence="17">296 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY hair on dogs harbors fleas, and also that dogs are goal-directed toward survival. Ruse believes that the conditions stated in my account for something to be a function are satisfied in that case, so that I am committed to saying that a function of long hair on dogs is to harbor fleas. But he thinks this functional statement is strongly counterintuitive, and that no one is likely to assent to it. On the other hand, he believes that we would be very much inclined to accept that functional statement if it were the case that dogs with more fleas receive more fleabites, and that fleabites pro- vide dogs with immunity from a certain parasite whose presence in dogs without fleabites lowers their life span. The reason we would be inclined to accept the statement in this case, Ruse thinks, is that, on the assumed evidence, harboring fleas contributes sig- nificantly to the survival and reproduction of long-haired dogs. In short, on the stated hypothesis, harboring fleas is what biologists call an "adaptation," which confers an adaptive advantage on long- haired dogs. Generalizing from this example, Ruse maintains that to say that the function of item i in organism S is to do F, is to say two things: first, the organism S does F by using item i; and sec- ond, F is an adaptation-that is, F contributes to the survival and reproductive activity of S. He therefore concludes that it is a mis- take to say, as I did, that a functional statement presupposes that the system about which it is made is goal-directed. Let me first comment on this second objection. In my opinion, this criticism rests partly on a misunderstanding for which I am largely responsible. I did indeed say that a functional statement "presupposes" that the system under consideration is directively organized or goal-directed (421). (I did not say that a functional statement implies that the system is goal-directed, which is the way Ruse states my view. Although the distinction between implying and presupposing is important, I do not think that much hangs on this distinction in this portion of Ruse's criticism. I will there- fore ignore those parts of his objection that are based on a confla- tion of the two terms of the distinction.) In any case, what I did say appears to warrant Ruse's claim that, to be consistent, I must accept as correct his allegedly counterintuitive statement that the function of long hairs on dogs is to harbor fleas. However, I also said, at other places in my analysis of functional notions, that functional statements not only presuppose that the systems under discussion are goal-directed, but also that the func- tion ascribed to an item contributes to the realization or mainte- nance of some goal for which the system is directively organized</page><page sequence="18">FUNCTIONAL EXPLANATIONS IN BIOLOGY 297 (408, 422). I failed to stress this second part of my requirement, and was therefore insufficiently clear in presenting my analysis. However this may be, I want now to make explicit in a semi-formal manner what I think is a presupposition in the application of functional statements. A functional statement of the form: a func- tion of item i in system S and environment E is F., presupposes (though it may not imply) that S is goal-directed to some goal G, to the realization or maintenance of which F contributes. I will call this account the "goal-supporting" view of biological func- tions. Since in Ruse's initial example harboring fleas apparently does not contribute to the maintenance of any goal for which dogs are goal-directed, I do not believe that I am committed to holding that the function of long hair on dogs is to harbor fleas. There may be difficulties in my account of functional statements, but the one Ruse mentions does not seem to be one of them. One difficulty I do recognize is that every effect of an item will have to count as one of its functions, if it should turn out that each effect contributes to the maintenance of some goal or other. Although I have no reason for thinking that this is the actual sit- uation for any organism, I do not know how to eliminate this possibility. However, even if it should be the case that each effect of an item contributes to some goal, it would not follow that the notion of being a function would not be differentiating-that is, it would not follow that every effect of an item would be a func- tion simpliciter. For on the goal-supporting view, being a function is relative to some goal, but not necessarily relative to the same goal. The goal-supporting view of functions seems to me to be com- patible with, but to be more general than, the accounts of both Hempel and Ruse. Ruse appears to deny that this is so. On the strength of the familiar Fregean distinction between meaning and reference, he maintains that the statement that an organism has an adaptive trait does not imply that the organism is goal-directed, even if, as a matter of fact, all actual organisms were goal-directed for survival. However, since the notion of what is an organism has not been precisely defined in the present discussion (or for that matter in any other discussion), it is endlessly debatable, though perhaps impossible to decide, whether or not there is that impli- cation. In any event, it is not essential that there be that implica- tion, for the claim to be correct that the goal-supporting view of functions is more general than those proposed by either Hempel or Ruse. It is sufficient, to establish that claim, that in point of</page><page sequence="19">298 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY fact all biological organisms are directively organized with respect to some goal. (iii) I must comment briefly on Ruse's own thesis that what are called biological functions of various items in organisms are adap- tations. It is certainly true that many effects of items that are gen- erally called functions are adaptations. But this does not seem to be so invariably. Whether a designated feature of an organism is an adaptive trait, depends on the environment in which the orga- nism lives. In consequence, if the environment is changed, a fea- ture that was adaptive in the earlier environment may not be adapted in the altered one. For example, the fur of polar bears helps prevent heat loss in the animal, so that in arctic regions possession of heavy fur has an adaptive value for the animal. But what if the environment of polar bears were changed, whether because of long-lasting climatic changes in the polar regions or because of a migration of polar bears to other climes? In that even- tuality, possession of heavy fur may no longer contribute to the survival and reproduction of the bears, although it might still be maintained that one function of the fur is the prevention of heat loss in those animals. Moreover, it is not incompatible with currently accepted evolu- tionary theory to suppose that the appearance of an adaptive trait in an organism is strongly coupled with the appearance of another trait which is not, or is not known to be adaptive, but comes to be designated nonetheless as a function of some item. More gen- erally, biologists frequently succeed in ascertaining effects of some item which they designate as the item's functions, without being at all sure that those effects contribute anything to the survival of organisms possessing the item. For example, certain genes of the yellow onion produce the yellow color of the plant, so that the production of this color is a function of those genes. However, al- though yellow onions are resistant to a fungus disease while white onions are susceptible to it, the color of yellow onions appears to have no adaptive value in itself.'1 This objection to Ruse's thesis is perhaps not a fatal one. But the objection does suggest that mak- ing adaptedness the criterion of a trait being a function, is not always congruous with biological practice. V In conclusion, I want to state-in summary manner the main out- come of these lectures that bears on the nature of functional ex- "l Verne Grant, The Origin of Adaptations (New York: Columbia, 1963), p. 117.</page><page sequence="20">FUNCTIONAL EXPLANATIONS IN BIOLOGY 299 planations. In the first place, if the system-property account of goal-directed processes is sound, goal ascriptions can be explicated without employing any teleological notions in the explication; and goal ascriptions can be explained in a manner that is structurally identical with explanations in the natural sciences. And in the second place, if the goal-supporting view of biological functions is correct, functional statements, as well as the presuppositions of functional ascriptions, can also be rendered without using func- tional concepts; and functional explanations can be shown to have the same structure as explanations in the physical sciences. However, one further question must be faced. It has been argued that explanations of both goal and function ascriptions are struc- turally similar to causal explanations in the physical sciences. Are the former two kinds of explanation also causal accounts, in one case of goal-directed activity, and in the other case of the presence of some item to which a function is attributed? The two cases require separate discussion. (a) It was noted earlier (277 above) that a statement of the form "The system S is goal-directed with respect to the goal G" (for ex- ample, "The normal human body is goal-directed with respect to the homeostatis of the blood temperature") is explained if it is shown to be a logical consequence of an assumed set of explana- tory premises, some of which are held to be laws (for example, premises that include assumptions such as that the human body possesses adrenal glands whose activity affects the body's metabolic rate, that moisture is evaporated when the body sweats, and that these activities produce changes in the temperature of the blood.) A number of these premises are causal laws, which state just how the goal G is related to various antecedent conditions. Explana- tions of goal ascriptions are therefore causal. (b) Explanations of function ascriptions cannot be characterized in the same way. This will be evident from a consideration of a function ascription having the form: "During a given period t and in environment E, the function of item i in system S is to enable the system to do F"-for example, "During a period when green plants are provided with water, carbon dioxide, and sunlight, the function of chlorophyll is to enable the plants to perform photo- synthesis." The explanatory premises for the assertion having the form "The item i occurs in S during a given period t and circum- stances E"-for example, "During a stated period and given cir- cumstances, chlorophyll is present in a specified green plant"-are as follows; (i) "During a stated period, the system S is in environ-</page><page sequence="21">300 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY ment E (for example, "During a stated period, a green plant is provided with water, carbon dioxide, and sunlight"); (ii) "During that period and in the stated circumstances, the system S does F" (e.g., "During the stated period, and when provided with water, carbon dioxide, and sunlight, the green plant performs photosyn- thesis"); (iii) "If during a given period t the system S is in environ- ment E, then if S performs F the item i is present in S" (e.g., "If during a given period a green plant is provided with water, carbon dioxide, and sunlight, then if the plant performs photosynthesis the plant contains chlorophyll"). It is obvious that "The system S contains the item i during the stated period and in the specified circumstances"-in the example, "Chlorophyll is present in the given green plant"-follows from the premises. The first two prem- ises are instantial statements, and the third is lawlike. However, the performance of F (photosynthesis) is not an antecedent condi- tion for the occurrence of the item i (chlorophyll), and so the premise is not a causal law. Accordingly, if the example is repre- sentative of explanations of function ascriptions, such explanations are not causal-they do not account causally for the presence of the item to which a function is ascribed. What then is accomplished by such explanations? They make explicit one effect of an item i in system S, as well as that the item must be present in S on the assumption that the item does have that effect. In short, explanations of function ascriptions make evident one role some item plays in a given system. But if this is what such explanations accomplish, would it not be intellectually more profitable, so it might be asked, to discontinue investigations of the effects of various items, and replace them by inquiries into the causal (or antecedent) conditions for the occurrence of those items? The appropriate answer, so it seems to me, is that inquiries into effects or consequences are as legitimate as inquiries into causes or antecedent conditions; that biologists as well as other students of nature have long been concerned with ascertaining the effects produced by various systems and subsystems; and that a reasonably adequate account of the scientific enterprise must in- clude the examination of both kinds of inquiries. (c) None of these conclusions concerning the character of expla- nations of goal and function ascriptions shows that the laws and theories of biology are reducible to those of the physical sciences, although if the conclusions really do hold water, they undermine one objection that is sometimes made to the possibility of such a reduction. What I think those conclusions do establish, is that</page><page sequence="22">BOOK REVIEWS 30I teleological concepts and teleological explanations do not consti- tute a species of intellectual constructions that are inherently obscure and should therefore be regarded with suspicion.
