<plain_text><page sequence="1">SOME ELABORATELY DECORATED BRONZE QUIVER PLAQUES MADE IN LURISTAN, c. 750-650 B.C. By P. R. S. Moorey No single " Luristan Bronze " has been the subject of so many diverse interpretations as the tall, narrow rectangular strip of sheet-bronze now in the Metropolitan Museum, New York, decorated in horizontal panels with chased and repousse' scenes of animals, men and demons (P1. I).1 In the past this quiver plaque, said originally to come from a grave, has been variously dated between the twelfth and seventh centuries B.c. In interpreting its complex iconography scholars have usually taken for granted that it illustrated the theology either of Mesopotamians, sometimes specifically Kassites (Godard; Lancaster), pre-Zoroastrian Iranians (Ghirshman; Dussaud) or Indo-Aryans (Dumizil). The apparent confusion, particularly considering the narrow limits of the available evidence, could hardly be greater. The group of decorated quiver plaques to which this one belongs provide a microcosm of the icono- graphy used by the Luristan bronze-smith in Iron Age II-IIIB. In the absence of any written records which bear on the question the following paper seeks to define as narrowly as possible the limits within which interpretation is feasible. Such a quest must take into account both the source and date, not of the Metropolitan Museum quiver alone but of all similar pieces available for study, the historical situation in Luristan at the time of their production, the repertory of motifs employed (its range and ancestry) and only then seek, if possible, to elucidate this iconography in religious terms. Even the most cursory examination of such work in related fields, where some literary evidence may even sur- vive,2 indicates that neither a single simple solution, nor any specific identification of deities or myths, is probable. The aim is not so much to banish speculation entirely, for the very nature of the evidence precludes that; but to reduce its role as far as is presently possible by a rigorous consideration of what actually constitutes the available body of evidence. The Metropolitan Museum's quiver plaque is the largest of a small group, which form but one aspect of Luristan's sheet bronze industry in Iron Age II-IIIB. The integrity of the larger repertory of products to which they belong is established by a common iconography, style and technique and by close associa- tion in the shrine at Dum Surkh in the only controlled excavation where many, often fragmentary, examples were found.3 The whole range embraces decorated sheetmetal vessels, belt and body armour fragments, as well as hammered disk-shaped pinheads and pendants. The last level of use in the Dum Surkh shrine in the Kuh-i Dasht, excavated by the Holmes Luristan Expedition in 1938, yielded a considerable number of these decorated pieces. Van Loon dates this level to the seventh century.4 How late into this century the shrine was in use remains an open question. To judge by the faience objects of Elamite manufacture found with the metalwork in question in this upper level the majority of it was made in the last decade or so of the eighth, or first quarter of the seventh, century B.C.5 The 1 The main references are R.

North-west Luristan then formed the ancient non-Iranian state of Ellipi, a buffer region between the spheres of Assyrian and Elamite influence, mentioned in Assyrian records from the reign of Ashurnasir- pal to that of Esarhaddon.7 Westwards it ran down to the edge of the Mesopotamian plain, probably embracing many of the important cemeteries recently explored in the Ilam region by Professor Vanden Berghe," southwards to Elamite Luristan (Rumishgan and Kuh-i Dasht). Its eastern limits are obscure. From sometime about the middle of the eighth century it was increasingly in contact with the Medes who had by then established themselves along the line of the Great Khorasan road in the eastern Zagros. Indeed when last mentioned under Esarhaddon Ellipi was on the brink of an alliance with the Medes and their Cimmerio-Scythian confederates.9 It may then be assumed, in the light of subsequent historical developments, that when Assyria first crushed Elam and then retreated from the south- western Zagros crippled by her own troubles in the third quarter of the seventh century B.C., the Median alliance overwhelmed Ellipi and with it all of Luristan. Now for the first time pottery taken to be typical of the Iranian-speaking intruders was widely distributed between the Mahi Dasht and the northern borders of Khuzistan.xo One point, more vital than any other for the present discussion, then becomes clear. The artefacts in question here were made in an area not yet under the control of Iranian-speaking peoples at the time of their production. Indeed it is likely that it was the arrival of these intruders which saw the end of such local shrines as that at Dum Surkh. Before considering the known local Luristan quiver plaques in detail, the wider Near Eastern tradition of which they form a remote part may be rapidly reviewed. Both Hrouda and Madhloom" have provided concise surveys of the evidence on Assyrian palace reliefs for the forms and decoration of quivers. In so far as this evidence goes it was only in the reign of Ashurnasirpal II (c. 883-59 B.c.) that animals and mythological demons were used to decorate the covers of royal chariot and personal quivers. Rosettes and geometric patterns alone appear to have been used in the eighth and seventh centuries B.C. as on actual examples from excavations at Uruk in Iraq12 and War Kabud in western Luristan.13 No elaborately decorated metal quiver plaques have yet been reported from excavations in Assyria, though plain ones have. A marked contrast is presented by the archaeological evidence from Urartu, where excavations have yielded a whole range of military equipment, metal shields, helmets, belts and quiver plaques, decorated with horizontal friezes. Many of these objects bear royal inscrip- tions which allow for a reliable chronology.14 The earliest richly decorated quivers, normally 65 to 70 cms. long, belong to the first half of the eighth century B.c. Piotrovskii'5 has given details of their various designs. The majority at Karmir Blur have eight bands of decoration filled with friezes of horsemen and war-chariots; but other fragments indicate a wider repertory of motifs, akin to those also used on shields and helmets, in which animals, real and imaginary, as well as ritual scenes appear. Plainer metal quivers are known from a number of sites, notably those from Kayalidere,e1 that show clearly how the exposed front only of the quiver was normally covered with metal. These may be taken as the form regularly issued to Urartian troops. It is broadly to this tradition that the armour from the destruction debris of level IV at Hasanlu, c. 8oo00 B.c., possibly an Urartian sack, belongs.17 6 A corpus is clearly desirable, but must wait on Professor van Loon's publication of the Dum Surkh material, and of the two finest collections, those in the Louvre (Coiffard) and the Mus6e Cinquantenaire, Brussels (Graeffe) only partly avail- able in published illustrations. 7 L.

A western iconographic source is also evident on the best known group of quiver plaques from Luristan, recently dis- cussed by Calmeyer.18 According to Madame Maleki's original reportl9 a considerable number decorated in derivative Assyro-Babylonian styles were found in a ceme- tery illicitly excavated about 1956 near the village of Gilan in north-west Luristan. They were said to have been associated in the graves with arrowheads, shields, iron helmets and swords. Calmeyer defined two groups, one in a reasonably well executed style closest to Babylonian art, the other more ineptly worked that owes more to Assyrian sources. Both types may be broadly dated to the eighth century B.c. The source, at the western end of the Great Khorasan Road through the Zagros, is exactly where such a fusion of influences might be anticipated at this time. Against this background the distinctive decoration of the quiver plaques reviewed here becomes the more obvious. There are no direct links of style or decoration with any of those already discussed. If anything slightly later than the " Gilan Group ", the "Dum Surkh " group belongs to an entirely different milieu. Apart from a fragment in Tehran20 that may well come from the Dum Surkh shrine, the others have no context; their decoration suggests objects for deposit in shrines or graves rather than routine military equipment. The seven examples known to me, all illustrated in publi- cations, will be considered here one by one, before an attempt to elucidate the complex sources of their decoration. As illus- trations of all but number 6 are included, I have for economy's sake dispensed with conventional catalogue descriptions. I. The plaque in the Heeramaneck Collection,21 New York, (fig. I) by far the most finely executed, has four surviving registers each occupied by a symmetrical group. The flank- ing animals, lions and caprids, are in no sense exceptional; only the full-face rendering of the lion-heads in the lowest panel provides a trait distinctive of this sheetmetal work in Luristan.22 The lowest central figure, entirely human, with long robe and prominent forelock has Neo-Elamite relatives.23 The other figures introduce a sub-human theme. The bull- men of panel 3, two in profile, one full-face, are also in the Elamite tradition, as Miss Porada has pointed out,24 and may be associated directly with scenes on decorated faience boxes from Susa, some of which reached the Dum Surkh shrine in the early seventh century B.C.I2 A fragment in the Louvre, which may well be from one of these quivers, illustrates a 18 P.

This triple-headed motif requires fuller elucidation. The central head, essentially human, may be flanked either by animals, birds or secondary human heads in profile, which often seem actually to spring from the sides of the central head. They appear on cast standard-finials2' and, with greater elaboration of detail, on sheetmetal pinheads and Fig. 2. Bronze umbo in a private collection in Basle; after R.

This clue leads naturally to another Luristan quiver, until recently in the Barbier Collection (Fig. 5),32 where again resource must be made to " Mitannian/Middle Assyrian " glyptic for the best source of its primary motifs. Two panels here are occupied by a rampant double-headed leonine monster, with interlaced body and the feet of a rapacious bird, hold- ing inverted goats or gazelles. Such a monster, with single body, appears on the seal of Eriba-Adad I at Assur (c. 1392- 66 B.c.).33 Virtually contemporary are representations of an allied creature, but with single head and body, on Middle Elamite cylinder seals from Tchoga-Zanbil in Iran.34 Exactly the monster of the quiver is shown with the same victims on an electrum goblet in the Louvre (P1. IVc),35 which may be dated by analogy with the fine gold goblets from the Marlik cemetery, where Middle Assyrian influence is very clear, to Iron Age I (c. I300-II00 B.C.). Though rare, relatives of the bicephalous leonine figure appear on the cast bronze pinheads from Dum Surkh and on disk-headed pins in Iron Age IIIB.36 The central panel's figure, holding braces of birds, is not so easily placed. The treatment of head, hair and beard, as also the tasselled skirt, is at home on Middle Assyrian seals."' A fine Middle Elamite cylinder seal illustrating a ritual meal shows an attend- ant holding a tethered bird.38 The frieze of vultures passant appears on other Luristan sheetmetal whereas the lowest scene on this quiver, of vultures feasting on a caprid or gazelle, appears both in Kassite art and on a Marlik goblet.39 3. To move from this quiver to the well-known Metropolitan Museum example (P1. I) reveals fresh motifs, but not real surprises.

The upper and lower registers of winged rampant bulls flanking a central tree are but one variant of a predominant motif among the cast standard-finials. It may also occupy the whole field of a disk pinhead or be constantly repeated as on a remarkable example in the Rietberg Museum, Ziirich (P1. IIIa).4? This pinhead also bears the lion and gazelle motif of the Metropolitan Museum quiver. The narrow band of gazelles passant draws in another group of sheetmetal objects produced in Luristan in Iron Age IIIB: tall goblets with concave sides decorated in horizontal registers with animal friezes.41 Here also belong two similarly decorated narrow-necked bronze jars,42 rather awkwardly made in two pieces, for the form is not one naturally suited to reproduction in metal, that match the form and decoration of contemporary polychrome glazed pottery jars.43 In the third quiver panel the triple-headed motif reappears.

On the parallel range of cast standard- finials the anthropomorphic central figure is never so obviously dominated by the animals. This profile figure and those in panel 5 with their rounded hair-styles, fluid features and straggly beards are again familiar participants in scenes on disk-headed pins.45 The central figure of panel 5 has at the centre of his skirt a detached face which has stimulated considerable speculation. When set in context there seems little doubt that here, as for instance on the Cincinnati silver plaque and a number of pinheads (Fig. 4, P1. IIIb),46 it re- presents a metal umbo in the form of a face sewn onto the skirt. Such detached face umbos, directly related to those often set at the centre of disk-headed pins, are well known,47 and examples were found in the Dum Surkh Shrine. Constantly in Luristan part of an animal may stand for the whole and the same idea applies to these faces which may, as on the Mus6e Rietberg pin (P1. IIIa), be set between rampant animals to represent the whole human figure more usually put there. Quivers 4, in Brussels (P1. IIb), 5, in the Louvre (P1. IIa) and 6, in Tehran,48 are equally close to the decoration of the pinheads in the choice of themes and in the manner of rendering them. Here also appear the floral borders so often used by the makers of disk headed pins either as primary motifs of decoration or as frames for other main scenes.49 Yet again, as Amiet noted in first publishing it, the Louvre quiver draws upon a repertory of motifs shared with Elam. The large Tehran example no. 6 (64 cm. in length) still retains some of the rings in its perimeter holes that secured it to the quiver, and the large chains by which it was fitted to a chariot or human bearer. The style and manner of executing the floral borders, two sets of panels with opposed recumbent winged bulls, two panels with a central tree flanked respectively by winged semi-human genii and rampant winged bulls, and its central panel framed within a large floral ornament, associate this example particularly closely with no. 5. It is the last of the published quiver plaques, no. 7 now in Tehran (Fig. 7),50 which opens some new avenues for exploration; but only in the upper and lower panels.

In the upper panel a light chariot with six-spoked wheel, drawn by a bovid not an equid, carries a bowman hunting lions, to judge from the creature set in the upper field. This chariot is like those in the upper register of the Hasanlu gold bowl and on a goblet in the Louvre (P1. IVa and b)51 in contrast to the war chariots of Neo-Assyrian type shown on the silver goblet and ivories from Level IV at Hasanlu.52 The cast cheek-pieces for horsebits from Luristan include a few rendered as a very stylized light chariot, but with four-spoked wheel, and a bowman almost standing on the yoke-pole to take aim.53 There the draught animal is a monster more feline than equid. On this quiver, as on the cheekpieces and the Hasanlu bowl, this is a world of myth, not reality. A seated male or female figure, set above a creature more like a leopard than a lion to judge from its body markings, in the lowest panel has no close parallel elsewhere. A disk-headed pin in Brussels shows a female figure, possibly an Elamite deity, holding snakes. She is seated directly on a leopard's back;54 on the Hasanlu gold bowl the " mountain- god" is set on a lion's back.55 Du Mesnil du Buisson's recent detailed interpretation of this quiver, taken in isolation, in terms of Canaanite religious imagery, is based on extremely general iconographic comparisons unchecked by any archaeological or historical controls.56 He offers no reasons why at the time of its production, or at any other time, the inhabitants of Luristan should use a religious icono- graphy, which even in its homeland is still a source of much lively discussion.57 If it may be accepted that these quivers form a homogenous group, and that their relation to the whole range of decorated metalwork of the Dum Surkh type establishes their time and approximate place of manufacture, then some attempt may be made to define the major strains in the iconographic repertory upon which their makers drew. The concise investigation offered here broadly indicates a blend of various strains, some long established, some more recent, which may be crudely classified in the following way: I. The Prehistoric legacy: a foundation of imagery native to the region since the prehistoric period that describes the world of the hunter in certain distinctive concepts and images, notably the nature- demon, half-man, half-caprid, mouflon or lion. It well espresses the intimate, in the case of the lion mutually predatory, relationship of man and wild fauna in their mountain home. So far as it is possible to judge domestic animals are conspicuously absent. Glyptic evidence is steadily growing for the " master-of-animals " and a close relative, either a man wearing an animal mask and skin or a demon, part man, part beast, in Luristan in the fourth millennium B.C.58 Thereafter it is, in so far as present evidence goes, generally submerged until exceptional circumstances at the very end of the second millennium B.C. allowed for the emergence of a local industry producing bronzes illustrating much of this very ancient repertory of motifs. By then it has been modified by contact with at least one other tradition: 2. The "Hurrian or Mitannian " legacy: in analysing the motifs of the Luristan quiver plaques recourse has constantly been made here first to the imagery of the " Mitannian-Middle Assyrian " glyptic styles, and secondly to the iconography of a series of decorated vessels produced in north-west Iran in Iron Age I under strong western influence. Miss Porada implicitly59 and both Miss Mellink and Amiet60 explicitly have defined the Hurrian character of the stories, and the pictorial means for expressing them, used on the Hasanlu gold bowl and such relatives as the copper and silver goblet in the Louvre (P1. IVa and b). Other vessels from Marlik, on which the iconography has much less narrative, have also been recognized as showing Middle Assyrian traits.6e Any attempt to define further the significance of this relationship in terms of Luristan's history runs the danger of categorizing what is, for the moment, no more than a hypothesis cautiously advanced. 51 Persia, fig. 31; P.

A Hurrian presence in Elam in the earlier second millennium B.C. may be identified from a variety of evidence, though this is too sparse at the moment to reveal their effect on Elamite art or religion;62 the more so northwards into Luristan. The cultural significance of clear affinities between the painted pottery tradition of western Iran and ceramics from Syrian sites, where a Hurrian presence is well established, depends once again on further documentation, as indeed does the possible Hurrian role in the diffusion of metal types postulated by Deshayes.63 Although a Hurrian homeland eastwards of the Tigris is generally accepted, it is more often located in the region of Lake Van or north-western Iran than further south in the Zagros.64 More striking, in the light of Dumezil's earlier argument associating the Metropolitan Museum quiver with Vedic theology, is the extent to which Luristan smiths in Iron Age IIIB may have been drawing on an iconographic legacy of Mitannian origin, albeit modified in the process of transmission. Dumezil's argument in this case rested on no more than an assumption that he had found in this quiver clear illustration of his well-known tripartite division of Indo-European society and religion. There is no direct evidence whatsoever for his very specific identification of Vedic deities in these scenes.65 But, allowing for the purely speculative nature of Dumezil's identifications, did he perhaps direct attention to a very significant cultural substratum in Iron Age Luristan not otherwise evident ? It is now widely recognized that the Aryan linguistic traces in the Near East in the third quarter of the second millennium B.c., outstandingly the names of such Vedic gods as Mitra, Varuna, Indra and the Nasatyas in the fourteenth century Hittite-Mitannian treaty of Shuppiluliumash and Kurtiwaza,66 are to be connected with Indo-Aryan, not Iranian. So long as the archives of the Mitannian capital remain unknown the basic evidence is certainly meagre, but this fundamental conclusion has yet to be cogently challenged.67 The small minority of Proto-Indo-Aryans who established themselves, c. 1550 B.c., as a ruling aristocracy among the Hurrians in the steppe lands of north Mesopotamia came out of Iran, where it is currently assumed they formed the western branch of intruders from central Asia."6 In Iran they were particularly associated with the central northern part of the country (Mazan- deran) and may have penetrated westwards by the route from the Urmia basin to the Upper Zab and beyond. Their Near Eastern ascendancy was relatively brief, virtually over by the mid-fourteenth century B.C. By the early 13th century they were Assyrian vassals, but what happened thereafter is unknown.69 They had established a link between northern Mesopotamia and north-western Iran that endured, perhaps not merely for commercial reasons, and has a vivid archaeological reflection in the luxury goods of gold and glass at Marlik, some of them dating from not long after the eclipse of the Mitannian supremacy in the west. Might there then have been a proto-Indo-Aryan element in the population of Luristan by at least the later second millennium B.C. ? 3. The Elamite contribution. It is particularly difficult with the material to hand to decide exactly how the undoubtedly close relationship between the lowland urban civilization of Elam and their northern neighbours in the mountains of Luristan affected their respective cultures. It would be unwise to assume that the conventionally more primitive tribes of Luristan were necessarily always the debtors, as there is enough in Elamite art to suggest that they shared from prehistoric times, if they had not adopted more recently, primary motifs and symbols. The mountain fauna, and the nature-demons, of Elamite art might be supposed to spring most naturally from the life and aspirations of their mountain neighbours. Recent excavations at Tchoga Gavaneh (Shahabad), 70 km. west of Kerman- shah, have revealed, by way of inscribed tablets and seals, clear evidence for a strong "Middle 62 R.

With the rich range of illustrative material for the religious imagery of Luristan in Iron II to IIIB recovered from excavations in the Dum Surkh shrine, and other unknown sites in Luristan, the tempta- tion to explain and interpret it in precise and specific terms is strong; so strong indeed that self- deception is a constant danger. When there are no checks or controls it is all too easy to be persuaded that more has been discovered than is actually discoverable in the present state of knowledge. This paper is predominantly negative in tone. It has attempted to underline the dangers of overconfidence in interpretation by seeking to eliminate certain possibilities on historical grounds, whilst pointing out the broad range which might still apply in the light of present evidence. Where reliable sources for the interpretation of ancient Near Eastern religious iconography exist they always reveal the extreme fluidity of the underlying religious attitudes and the protean character of deities.
