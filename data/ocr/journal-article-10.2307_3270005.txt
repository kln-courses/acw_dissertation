<plain_text><page sequence="1">Numen, Vol. XXXVIII, Fasc. 1 AYODHYA: A HINDU JERUSALEM An Investigation of 'Holy War' as a Religious Idea in the Light of Communal Unrest in India* HANS BAKKER Summary This article discusses the concept of 'holy war' and the religious ideas it implies. According to some these ideas are characteristic of monotheistic traditions. The author investigates recent developments in Hinduism and comes to the conclusion that some of these characteristics are coming to the fore in modern forms of the Hindu religion that have strong bonds with fundamentalist movements. The ques- tion of the mosque occupying the holy spot in Ayodhya, which is considered as the birth-spot of Visnu's incarnation as Rdma, plays a central role in these developments. 'Liberation' of this site has many features in common with the motif of liberating Jerusalem in the age of the crusades. The author concludes by remarking that, though Hinduism has proved in the past to be a religion not prone to holy wars, recent developments in Indian society have made the prospect of a holy war between Hindus and Muslims seem only too real and close. Since the cultural discovery of India in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth century, Indian culture and society have been widely regarded as more than ordinarily pacifistic and moral. Johann Gottfried Herder (1744-1803), for example, speaks of the brahmins as a 'gentle race of men,' 'happy lambs' whose idea of God is 'great and beautiful' and whose 'morals are pure and lofty' (Bakker 1988: 99). This idealized image was enhanced in the twen- tieth century by the manner in which India freed itself from colonial rule; the non-violent resistance that Mahatma Gandhi both preached and practised. On the other hand, as every student of India knows, there have been few periods, even up to the present century, during which the South-Asian sub-continent has been free of war. And this fact seems to have been accepted by the Indians themselves as more or less in the natural order of things. Until the establishment and enforcement of the pax Britannica, the waging of wars against rival rulers was generally regarded as one of the natural political tasks of kings and the aristocracy.'</page><page sequence="2">Ayodhya: a Hindu Jerusalem 81 How is this contradiction to be explained, and how has the image of a peaceful and peace-loving India managed to remain prevalent in the face of the historical facts? The answers to these questions should probably be sought in the first place in the ambivalent attitude towards violence and the use of force found in India's own culture and world-view. This ambivalence may be seen as an inevitable product of the tension between conflicting traditional values,2 which on the one hand sanctioned countless armed con- flicts yet on the other hand never seems to have directly involved Hinduism in the start of a war.3 Not surprisingly then, several scholars have excluded India from the scope of their investigations into 'holy war.' These scholars regard the pluriformity of polytheism as the main reason that Hinduism appears to differ fun- damentally from the monotheistic (semitic) religions as to the legitimization of the use of force for religious aims.4 We shall refer to this theory as the 'polytheism thesis.' Holy war as a religious idea On the eve of the deadline of the UN's ultimatum to Irak (15 January 1991) the British prime minister John Major declares in the House of Commons that the now inevitable war is a 'just' one. At the same time Saddam Hussein calls on all Muslims to fight under Irak's banner, as it leads them on to a 'holy war,' jihdd, to be fought by 'believers' against 'infidels.' It cannot but be noted that both speeches make use of concepts developed during the early Middle Ages in the two great monotheistic traditions, which apparently still retain some cur- rency, and indeed evocative force. In the predominantly secular society of late twentieth century England a summons to a 'holy war' would hardly have an effect, except to provoke ridicule and suspi- cion. Instead, we find an appeal to a concept first developed by St. Augustine, namely that of a bellumjustum ('just war'), which can be shown to be the source of the idea of a crusade.5 Saddam Hussein's proclamation of a jihadd has almost equally venerable precedents. The aim of summoning 'believers' to a holy war against 'infidels' is to mobilize the strength and motivation of the faithful in a military enterprise, to suppress fear of physical danger, and to</page><page sequence="3">82 Hans Bakker encourage actions which frequently are opposed to the direct per- sonal interests of the individual. Such declarations and exhortations on both sides are clearly primarily intended to raise morale among both soldiers and civilians. In other words, their value is chiefly propagandistic, and this is certainly an important aspect of the phenomenon of holy war. It would however be a serious mistake to imagine that this alone could provide a full or adequate explanation of the phenomenon. It is necessary to ask a more fundamental question: why is it that the call to a holy war has any stimulating or pro- paganda effect in the first place? To answer this we will have to investigate problems in the field of religious studies: what are the religious ideas and beliefs of the 'believer' to whom such a call is directed, and what framework of action is directly associated with them? When a modern researcher of war and peace, the polemologist Hylke Tromp, concludes that we should forget about 'the faith, ideology and sacred fire' of soldiers on the field of battle because they only 'go forward because they have no alternative if they do not want to lose the respect of others and their own selfrespect' (Tromp 1991), this may seem to suggest that cultural anthropological questions and questions such as posed in the previous paragraph are irrelevant. However, the self-image which determines the content and force of this 'respect of others and self- respect' is in fact the product of the individualization of the cultural and religious values of the society which the soldier is called upon to fight for.6 It is this self-image that war-propaganda aims at building up and strengthening, in order to break down any innate repugnance against killing fellow men.' To understand what ultimately motivates the individual soldier to place his duty as soldier above personal safety it is necessary to focus on the social, cultural and-in the case of holy wars--particularly the religious values and symbols which constitute this self-image. Fear and violence are universal basic experiences and thus impor- tant constituents of all religions (von Stietencron 1979). But this has not always resulted in them giving rise to collective violence sanc- tioned by religion. What then specifically distinguishes holy wars from war in general?</page><page sequence="4">Ayodhya: a Hindu Jerusalem 83 As has been noted above, some scholars have seen the answer to this question in some common element of the three great monotheistic religions: Judaism, Christianity and Islam. Significantly, Colpe does not consider Hinduism at all in his two articles Zur Bezeichnung und Bezeugung des Heiligen Krieges (1984), while as to the polytheism thesis he remarks with reference to ancient Greek history that: Da, wo innerhalb eines polytheistischen Systems G6tter Kriege ffihren, [...], da verbleibt der Heiligkeitscharakter ausschlietflich ihnen und teilt sich dem Kriege nicht mit; wo dies nicht der Fall ist, kann der Krieg heilig genannt werden. (Colpe 1984: 199). Similarly, in his Krieg, Sieg und die olympischen Gotter der Griechen, Burkert has stated with regard to the polytheistic structure of Greek religion: Auch wenn die Stidte je ihre Stadtgottheit haben, so sind diese G6t- ter doch 'vielverehrt,' haben an vielen Orten ihre Heiligtfimer; keine Stadt kann sich auch auf die G6tter ganz verlassen; ein Gott behailt es sich vor, ffir welche Seite im Krieg er Stellung nimmt [...] man sieht nicht sich selbst als die allein Bestitigten, Bevorzugten, die Auserwiihlten eines 'heiligen Kriegs.'8 Although the term 'holy war' (hieros pdlemos) seems to have been used first by the Greeks, they appear to have meant something quite different from the phenomena we are concerned with here (Brodersen 1991). As is clear from a glance at the literature on this subject, especially Colpe's work, the definition of 'holy war' itself is con- siderably problematic. Agreement may be reached easily enough on the meaning of the word 'war' but 'holy' and the idea of 'holiness' have been understood in very different ways by various scholars. Kippenberg (1991 a) has pointed out that 'the word "holy" should be freed from its connotations of irrationality, with which especially R. Otto has associated it, and should rather be connected with "the uncommon" ("nicht-alltfgliche") in contrast with "the common" ("alltaigliche") (M. Weber), and with "collective" in contrast with "individual" (E. Durkheim).' By such a definition all wars are 'holy,' and in view of the large number of wars which have taken place on the South-Asian sub-continent, the polytheism thesis</page><page sequence="5">84 Hans Bakker would have to be considered to be directly refuted. On the other hand, the historical material definitely suggests that holy wars form a separate category, and for heuristic reasons too it seems desirable to narrow the scope of our definition in some way. The narrowest definition of a 'holy war' would be a war waged in the name of God by people who believe that by doing so they fulfil His will and carry out His plan. Some of the Christian crusades may be taken as examples of such wars. The deus vult of Pope Urban II's address in Clermont in AD 1095, and the conse- quence of this 'will' are well known. However, it seems ques- tionable whether the Islamic jihadd can in all circumstances be com- prised within this definition.9 A compromise, which comes close to the ordinary usage of the term and seems at least to provide a work- ing definition with some heuristic value, is to define those wars as 'holy' in which religious or pseudo-religious concepts play a domi- nant role; i.e., armed conflicts in which a major appeal is made to the religious convictions of the combatants, in which (at least) one side claims possession of absolute theological truth and which is fought with the conviction that this truth must be victorious, for the greater glory of God and for the weal of mankind. In this connection five conditions for religiously motivated violence formulated by H. von Stietencron (1974: 334) appear to be relevant. The first of these is the belief of the side that knows God to be with it in its own superiority-frequently this may apply to both parties. An extreme case of such a conviction is the idea of a 'chosen people' as found for instance in the school of the Deuteronomium (7:1-5, 20:16). Research carried out since von Rad's Der heilige Krieg im alten Israel (1952) has, however, demonstrated that the kinds of warfare, including the 'ban-practice' (bherem), preached in the Laws of War (Deut. 20), were also known in Assyria, and in fact were common practices of war in ancient times.10 The notion of being 'the Lord's chosen people' too is found not only in Judaism; it was used, for instance, in Calvinistic pro- paganda during the Dutch-Spanish Eighty Years War (Huussen 1991). One condition for holy wars thus would appear to be the notion of exclusivity which attributes absolute status to one's own beliefs.</page><page sequence="6">Ayodhya: a Hindu Jerusalem 85 At the same time the opponent, who is fighting against the good, is demonized, that is, seen as a threatening embodiment of evil. Religions which develop such dyadic concepts and can sanction wars as 'holy,' are in consequence confronted with the problem of the theodicy; the vindication of the existence of evil in the world. Two of the conditions formulated by von Stietencron do not appear to be necessary conditions for a holy war: namely the belief that there is no second earthly existence ('Einmaligkeit des Lebens'), and the 'close connection between religion and secular violence.' The latter should probably be regarded as concomitant rather than conditional." Another condition should however be mentioned, which undoubtedly plays a central role; namely that of 'community.' The importance of this factor can only be realized when we consider religions such as Hinduism that place little explicit emphasis on the 'community of believers' and do not have the kind of organisational structure necessary to form such a com- munity. The common acceptance of an exclusive truth unites believers into a community. Each member of such a community considers himself as taking part in a summum bonum that transcends individuality. In situations of crisis, such as a war, this can lead to the member of the community giving up his life for the common good. Martyrdom is always founded on such feelings of com- munity.12 Kippenberg has rightly emphasized that martyrdom and holy war are related themes; the concept of a 'holy war' would not be complete without the idea of meritorious and exemplary suffer- ing of the just (Kippenberg 1991a). On the other hand it must be noted that the presence of these conditions does not necessarily lead to 'holy' wars, as is shown for instance by the fact that the crusades were legitimized by the Roman Catholic but not by the Orthodox Church (Palmer 1991). The Hindu religion and the social reality of war To pursue our investigation into collective religious violence in the historical and contemporary reality of South Asia, in relation to Hinduism, it is necessary to introduce a chronological differen- tiation. Early Hinduism, before Muslim dominance (c. AD 1200),</page><page sequence="7">86 Hans Bakker unquestionably taught an absolute truth as the basis of the entire universe and the final aim of all living beings. However, as argued by Hacker (1983), this truth had a diffuse, all pervasive, inclusive ('inklusivistisch') nature and was thus the opposite of exclusive. God transcends the world but is simultaneously omnipresent in it. Such a world-view can have no fundamental opposition between good and evil. This characteristic of early Indian thought can be illustrated by a passage from Kausftaki Upanisad 3.1: Indra said to him: Know me alone; for I hold this alone to be the most beneficial thing for a man, that he should know me. I slew the three- headed son of Tvastar. I gave the Arunmukha ascetics to the hyenas. After breaking many promises, in heaven I crushed the Prahladlyas, in the sky the Paulomas and on earth the Kalakhaiijas. Yet not one hair of mine (having done this) was destroyed. And no hair will be destroyed of him who knows me, by any deed; not because of theft, not because of infanticide, not because of matricide and not because of patricide. Even if he commits evil, the colour does not leave his face. 13 This viewpoint is connected with a totally different concept of time from that found in the semitic religions. The infinity of time is regarded as cyclic, and the notion of a final period in which the highest divine aim shall be realized and towards which the history of mankind tends (a civitas dei) is practically absent. From a divine standpoint, sub specie aeternitatis, worldly activity is a spectacle (tamdsJ'a), a drama, the play (lild) of God. In such a view there is no place for martyrdom. Individual self-sacrifice, which is of course as common in India as elsewhere, yields in the first place benefits for the same individual in an ensuing existence. The hypocrisy of mar- tyrdom (described by von Stietencron (1979: 330) as 'besondere Raffinesse') which conceals the egotistical desire for the martyr's crown in the hereafter under altruistical motives of self-sacrifice for a common goal, the weal of all, is not found in Hinduism, at least in the early period. Hinduism is a religion which in the first place aims at individual liberation, and only to a far lesser extent than the semitic religions unites believers into a single community.'4 This may perhaps be connected with the fact that a plurality of deities is worshipped, but this connection does not appear to me to be intrinsic. It is clear that, also in the early period, a deep conviction</page><page sequence="8">Ayodhya: a Hindu Jerusalem 87 of a single, all-compassing and absolute divinity underlies this out- ward polytheism.'5 We shall investigate whether a change has recently been taking place in regard to this last point. For it appears that a tendency can be detected among the Hindu population today to define itself as the community of Hindus, and this tendency seems to be connected with a shift in emphasis which has brought the monotheistic aspect of Hinduism to the fore and given it tangi- ble form. Such tendencies generally have a long history. As has been shown in Lorenzen's study, Warrior Ascetics in Indian History (1978), before the Muslim conquests India did not have any holy wars, either in the sense defined above or in the sense of 'wars fought by holy men.' But with the introduction of Muslim rule in North India, a change takes place, although this does not directly result in a holy war. Hindus are obstructed in the observance of their religious practices, and the religious interests vested in temples and monasteries are threatened with confiscation or destruction. At the same time the influx of Islam leads to conflicts between Hindu monks and Muslim fakirs, and the system of traditional education, which ensured the continuity of cultural and religious values, was seriously undermined. The state of affairs may be illustrated by a description of the razzia of Mahmud of Ghazni, who destroyed the great temple in Somnath (Gujarat) in AD 1024-1025. In the year 414AH Mahmuid captured several forts and cities in Hind, and he also took the idol called Somnit. The idol was the greatest of all the idols of Hind. Every night that there was an eclipse the Hindus went on pilgrimage to the temple, and there congregated to the number of a hundred thousand persons [...] One thousand Brahmans attended every day to perform the worship of the idol, and to introduce the visitors. Three hundred persons were employed in shaving the heads and beards of the pilgrims. Three hundred and fifty persons sang and danced at the gate of the temple. Every one of these received a settled allowance daily [...] He reached Somnait on a Thursday in the middle of Zi-l Ka'da, and there he beheld a strong fortress built upon the seashore, so that it was washed by the waves [...] Next morning, early, the Muhammadans renewed the battle, and made great havoc among the Hindus, till they drove them from the town to the house of their idol, Somnait.'6</page><page sequence="9">88 Hans Bakker It is a well-authenticated fact that when Mahmfid was about to destroy the idol, a crowd of Brahmans represented (to his nobles) that if he would desist from the mutilation they would pay several crores of gold coins into the treasury [...] Mahmfid replied: 'I know this, but I desire that on the day of resurrection I should be summoned with the words, "Where is that Mahmfid who broke the greatest of the heathen idols?" rather than by these: "Where is that Mahmfid who sold the greatest of the idols to the infidels for gold?" '17 A dreadful slaughter followed at the gate of the temple. Band after band of the defenders entered the temple to Somnait, and with their hands clasped round their necks, wept and passionately entreated him. Then again they issued forth to fight until they were slain, and but few were left alive [...] This temple of Somnit was built upon fifty-six pillars of teak wood covered with lead. The idol itself was in a chamber. [Mahmfid] seized it, part of it he burnt, and part of it he carried away with him to Ghazni, where he made it a step at the entrance of the Jami'-masjid. The worth of what was found in the temple exceeded two millions of dinars, all of which was taken. The number of slain exceeded fifty thousand.'8 It is therefore hardly surprising that in the following centuries a number of groups of Hindus formed military organizations to defend such religious interests. However, significantly enough this process only appears to have taken place among groups which already formed a religious community, namely various orders of ascetics or monastery-orders. Of course these were also the groups whose direct interests were particularly threatened. Resistance was naturally also offered by the Hindu kingdoms, but the resultant conflicts did not essentially differ from early wars between Hindu rulers themselves, as may also be illustrated by the fact that many Hindus served in the armies commanded by and fighting for Muslims. It is important to note that there never was a popular Hindu uprising against the new Muslim rule. The lack of unity within the Hindu world is even more apparent from the reports that have come down to us of the actions of these militarized orders. The earliest battle known to us in which armed religious ascetics took part, in Thanesar, AD 1567, was between two Hindu orders, and was motivated not by a desire to protect Hindu religious values but rather to secure the interests of one order against claims of a rival</page><page sequence="10">Ayodhya: a Hindu Jerusalem 89 group (Lorenzen 1978: 69). Abu-1 Fazl has given us an eyewitness account in his Akbar Ndma. There are two parties among the Sanyisis (i.e., Saiva ascetics): one is called Kur, and the other Pfiri. A quarrel arose among these two about the place of sitting. The asceticism of most of these men arises from the world's having turned its back on them, and not from their having become coldhearted to the world. Consequently they are con- tinually distressed and are overcome of lust and wrath, and covetousness. The cause of the quarrel was that the Pfiri sect had a fixed place on the bank of the tank where they sate and spread the net of begging. The pilgrims from the various parts of India who came there to bathe in the tank used to give them alms. On that day the Kur faction had come there in a tyrannical way and taken the place of the Pfiris, and the latter were unable to maintain their posi- tion against them [...] The two sides drew up in line, and first one man on each side advanced in a braggart fashion, and engaged with swords. Afterwards bows and arrows were used. After that the Puris attacked the Kurs with stones [...] The Kurs could not withstand them and fled. The Puris pursued them and sent a number of the wretches to annihilation.19 It is therefore clear that the case of these militarized ascetic orders falls under the first type of movement differentiated by Lorenzen (1978: 63), namely 'a movement concerned with the protection of specific, local economic and social interests and privileges.' A larger framework which could have mobilized the Hindus as a single community against the new Muslim rule simply did not exist. The segregation of the Hindu and Muslim communities To trace developments further we will now turn to a particular religious centre, situated centrally in North India: the city Ayodhya. The sacredness of this city was (and is) founded on the belief that in the far distant past the god Visnu was born there as the son of king Dagaratha. This particular incarnation of Visnu is named Rama. This belief belongs to the cultural inheritance of every Hindu. The story of Visnu's avatara as Rima is told in the ancient Sanskrit epic Ramayana, as well as in countless later, ver- nacular versions. The figure of Raima has developed into the</page><page sequence="11">90 Hans Bakker archetype of the just king in Indian culture, the ruler who brings happiness and prosperity to all his subjects. He is introduced in the Ramdyana .1.12-4 as follows: Who is there in this world today who is virtuous? Who is mighty (heroic), knows the dharma, is grateful (krtaji1a), speaks the truth and firmly keeps his vows? Who is possessed of good conduct, and who is well-disposed towards all living beings? Who is wise, who is skilful, and who alone is beautiful to behold? Who is self-controlled and has conquered (his) wrath; who is wise and free from envy? For whom do (even) the gods feel fear when his fury is roused in battle? The answer to all these questions is of course Rama. His rule, popularly called Rdma rdjya, as depicted in the Rdmayana and later literature, represents the ideal society, and Rama himself per- sonifies simultaneously the ideal king and God. The sixteenth cen- tury Rdmacaritamdnasa describes his divine reign thus: When Rama sat upon his sovereign throne, the three spheres rejoiced and there was no more sorrow. No man was any other's enemy, and under Rama's royal influence all ill-feeling was laid aside. Everyone devoted himself to his duty in accordance with his caste and stage of life, and ever found happiness in treading the Vedic path. Fear and sorrow and sickness were no more [...] Sole monarch of the land engirdled by seven seas was Raghupati (i.e., Rama) in Kosala-no great dominion for him in each of whose several hairs dwelt many a universe. [...] The bliss and prosperity of Rama's realm neither Ser- pent King nor Sarasvati can describe. All who dwelt therein were generous and charitable and did humble service to the Brfhmans. Each husband was true to one wife, and each wife was loyal to her husband in thought and word and deed.20 As I have attempted to demonstrate elsewhere, the religious cult of this incarnation of Visnu only assumes significant proportions in the period that saw the forces of Islam threatening to destroy Hindu society, many centuries after the formation of the Ramayazna itself (Bakker 1986; 1987). It is only in the eleventh and twelfth centuries that Ayodhya develops into a pilgrimage-centre in which the spot where Rama was born, the Ramajanmabhfimi, is the main attrac- tion. A coincidence? Or is there some intrinsic connection between the Muslim invasions and the rise in importance of this god-king</page><page sequence="12">Ayodhya: a Hindu Jerusalem 91 as a symbol for traditional Hindu values? In any case, there can be no doubt that as the time-honoured model of justice (dharma) and regal fame and power (ksatra), Rama was remarkably well suited to develop into a symbol of the struggle against the forces that threatened traditional Hindu society and values."2 It is not possible to go further into this problem here; for our present purpose it is sufficient to remark that in the course of the second millennium Rama, together with his birth-place Ayodhya, came to occupy an increasingly important and central role in Hinduism. Now until the end of Great Moghul rule, that is to say till the beginning of the eighteenth century, Ayodhya was the capital of one of the provinces of the Muslim empire in North India. In con- sequence, Hindu sects had few rights to defend in the city. Pilgrimage was tolerated, but the cream of the profits from it was taken by the Muslim rulers in the form of a tax on pilgrims. It was forbidden to build temples or monasteries of more than a certain dimension in the city, and the existing temples fell into decay and disappeared or were replaced by mosques. The latter took place with the temple on the supposed spot of Rama's birth, dating from the early eleventh century. This small temple was replaced by a mosque, the Babri Masjid, in AD 1528, during the reign of the first Moghul emperor, Babur,22 a deed which was to have far-reaching consequences. After the death of Aurangzeb in AD 1707, central Muslim rule in North India was weakened to such an extent that regional and local rulers could found small independent kingdoms. Ayodhya becomes the capital of the virtually independent kingdom Avadh, ruled by the former governor of the Moghul province, the nawab Saadat Khan, a Shiite Muslim of Persian descent. However, the power of the rulers of Avadh has been weakened so much that the execution of their authority comes to lie more and more in the hands of allied Hindu leaders and large landowners. Even the military power of the Islamic nawabs of Avadh is partly dependent on the services of Hindu ascetics.23 The logical outcome of this situation is that Muslim authority loses its control over the activities in and around the Hindu holy places. The organization and management of the birth-city of Rama come into the hands of orders of Hindu monks,</page><page sequence="13">92 Hans Bakker who do not hesitate to use force to drive each other from the most lucrative spots. A Vaisnava source describes the situation as follows: At that time [...] when the occasion of Rama's birth came, people went to Kosalapur (i.e., Ayodhya) and assembled there-who can describe the enormous crowd? At that place there was an unlimited (number of) strong warriors in sarmnyasin garb, carrying weapons, with matted hair and ashes smeared on every limb-an unlimited army of soldiers taking pleasure in battle. Fighting with the vairdgins broke out. This fight was of no avail (to the vairdgins), owing to lack of strategy. [...] They made a mistake by going there towards them; the vairdgin garb became a source of misery. All people dressed in vairagin garb fled-through fear of them (scil., sarmnyasins) Avadhpur was abandoned. Wherever they (scil. sarmnyasins) happened to find people in vairdgin garb, there they struck great fear into them. Through fear of them everyone was frightened and wherever they could they took shelter in a secret place and hid themselves. They changed their dress and hid their sectarian markings-no one showed his proper identity.24 Inevitably, the Vaisnava orders arm themselves too. The resultant military orders are organized on the model of their Saiva counter- parts, into akhdrds, 'wrestling-schools,' and during the eighteenth century their fort-like monasteries appear throughout North India. One of these orders manages to wrest the control over some of the important holy places in Ayodhyaf from the Saiva opposition. And as a reward for services rendered to the nawab of Avadh-a Shiite, as remarked above-the Vaisnavas are even granted permission to build a fort-monastery at a mere 700 meters distance from the Babri Masjid. This so-called 'Fort of Hanuman,' the Hanumaingarhi, has remained the most important and frequently visited monastery-cum-temple in Ayodhyaf until the present time. For our subject, it is important to keep in mind that even in this period of religious turmoil and anarchy the conflict still remains internal, and is limited to certain local centres. There still is no common Hindu attack on the strongholds of Islam, as represented for instance by the Babri Masjid on Rama's Birth-spot (ramajan- mabhuimi). It is true that religious interests and emotions play a major part in these conflicts, but the fight is hardly, if at all,</page><page sequence="14">Ayodhya: a Hindu Jerusalem 93 inspired by religious ideology. Nor is there as yet any mobilization of the large mass of the Hindu population which did not belong to any organisation of ascetics or monks. It is interesting to observe that as official Muslim authority in North India continues to weaken during the nineteenth century and grows more and more dependent on the support of the Hindu aristocracy, the originally political contrast between Muslim rulers and Hindu subjects changes in character and focus and begins to take the form of a religious conflict which both sides attempt to decide in their own favour by any means, including the use of force. It should of course be remembered that by that time the Muslim segment of the population is not only to be found among the ruling classes, but that large groups from especially the lowest strata of Hindu society had converted to Islam. This new development, the religious conflict that was to take on such important and threaten- ing dimensions in the history of South Asia in the twentieth cen- tury, both under British rule and in the post-colonial period, can again be particularly clearly illustrated and traced with reference to the events in Ayodhya. On the eve of Britain's annexation of Avadh, with the ruler of Avadh, the Shiite Wajid Ali Shah, already no more than a puppet for the British, groups of Sunnis rise in protest against the per- missive attitude of their Islamic government. They demand to be allowed to build a mosque on the site of the Hanumangarhi (Bhat- nagar 1968: 117ff.). Inevitably, this results in a direct conflict with the ascetics of the fort-monastery. Despite attempts by British troops, with the sanction of Wajid Ali Shah, to separate the com- batants, heavy fighting breaks out between the Hindus and the Muslims, and the Muslims are forced to retreat into the Babri Mas- jid on Rama's Birth-spot. The Hindus storm the mosque and seventy Muslims are killed, after which Hindu wrath turns against the Muslim population of the city and leads to large-scale plundering. Large numbers of Muslims, led by fanatic mullahs, gather from all parts of Avadh and proclaim jihdd against the Hindus of Ayodhya. Feelings run high, and the situation grows even more explosive-partly because the Hindus slaughter a number of pigs on the day of the burial of the Muslims who died in the Babri</page><page sequence="15">94 Hans Bakker Masjid-and this results in the first direct confrontation between Hindu and Muslim populations as such. The Islamic campaign sets out from Lucknow, the new capital of Avadh, under command of the maulvi Amir-ud-din alias Amir Ali, who is hailed as the fifth imam. Despite desperate attempts on the part of Wajid Ali Shah, who has the jihadd pronounced unlawful by both a Shiite and a Sunna court, Amir Ali continues his march, leaving a wake of destruction. But before this mob reaches Ayodhya, they are intercepted by government troops under British command. Consultations ensue with the lawful Muslim authorities in Lucknow, in the course of which the British far-sightedly point out that if the rebellious Muslims were after all to be permitted to build their mosque on the site of the Hanumangarhi, chaos would immediately result, with the Hindus in their turn claiming their rights to the holy places now occupied by mosques in Ayodhyai, Benares etc. But the consultations and all attempts at negotiation yield no result, and finally the jihadd of Amir Ali ends before the British cannon of captain Barlow. Four or five hundred Muslims perish, Amir Ali among them. Two months later, in February 1857, Avadh is annexed by the English, who promptly erect a wall and fence around the Babri Masjid.25 This harrowing episode clearly shows that large-scale conflicts between Hindus and Muslims do not directly spring from the historical situation of an Islamic ruling class and an oppressed Hindu population. The religious conflict only takes the form of popular movements when Muslim authority is about to topple and both segments of the population attempt to take the law into their own hands. With the restoration of government control and the emergence of the modern state, these movements subsequently become increasingly directed against public authority, which they try to undermine, no matter whether this authority is exercised by British colonial power or the democratically chosen government of the Republic of India.26 From a core of a small number of fanatic Sunni mullahs and trained Hindu ascetics, the awareness of being a group with common religious beliefs that differ fundamentally from those of the oppos- ing group spreads out among both the Hindu and Muslim popula-</page><page sequence="16">Ayodhya: a Hindu Jerusalem 95 tion during the nineteenth and twentieth century. In other words, the feeling of 'community' arose also within the Hindu population, stimulated, among other things, by the regularly recurrent conflicts around the spot of Ra-ma's birth, the Babri Masjid. An additional factor was that in accordance with British colonial policy the Hindus were now officially defined as a separate category from the Muslim segment of the population. In connection with the colonial census reports, the individual citizen was compelled, for the first time in the history of India, to explicitly state whether he was of the Hindu or Muslim faith. The combination of such factors meant that Hindus of all castes and sects were forced to reflect on what made them Hindus and distinguished them from their Islamic fellow citizens.27 With the restoration of central rule by the colonial authorities, the role of the armed Hindu ascetics was greatly diminished. Some of them served as mercenaries in the colonial army, and some were of assistance to the authorities in times of crisis, such as the Mutiny of 1857 (Fyz.Gaz.163), but they played no further important role as a military power. Instead one could say that their militant char- acter gradually spread out over the Hindu population in general. The most gruesome consequence of this development (so far at least) took place during the period of de-colonization, when the empire of British India fell apart into two states; the secular state of India and the Islamic Pakistan. This 'partition' was accom- panied by massacres, carried out by both sides, which are estimated to have cost half a million lives. But even after the secession of Pakistan some 40 million Muslims remained inhabitants of the state of India; a number which had already doubled in 1981. At present the Muslims comprise 12 % of the total population of India. Since the secession India has fought two wars with Pakistan, and the present unrest in Kashmir could be the prelude of a third. Nonetheless such wars between states, fought over territorial disputes, should probably not be called 'holy wars,' also because Hindus, Muslims and even Sikhs have fought on both sides in them. Ayodhya: a Hindu Jerusalem For our present subject it is more fruitful to look at the current situation in India - which, it must not be forgotten, is a secular</page><page sequence="17">96 Hans Bakker state. This situation is characterized by the disintegration of the population into several sections whose identity is chiefly based on religious beliefs. This is generally referred to as 'communalism;' it may be compared with the phenomenon of 'segregation' ('verzuil- ing') in twentieth century Dutch society. In regard to the Muslim segment, the world-wide tendency towards fundamentalism has undoubtedly played a role in India too. Numerous accusations have been made by the Hindus that Islamic organizations in India are being financially supported by the rich Arab oil producing nations. Another danger is of course seen in Pakistan, which is said to aim at destabilizing India via the Islamic population; particularly by fanning the flames of Sihk violence in Punjab and, most recently, by causing the turmoil in Kashmir. These geo-political factors have no doubt strengthened the self-awareness of the Hindus as forming one community. A common ideology, which could (and increas- ingly does) unite the still largely fragmentary Hindu population under a single banner, has been developed on the basis of the mythology of the Ramadyana. In this ideology, Rama is the deity who in the past created and ruled the ideal state here on earth. Through the inevitable process of historical decline, this state has since disappeared, but can, if all Hindus were to unite in working towards it, be recreated in the future. This new utopic reign, the Rama rdjya, which will of course encompass only the Hindu faithful, may be compared with the eschatological ideal of the civitas dei reified in the reconquered earth- ly Jerusalem.28 For the Hindu believer of the present, a holy place like Ayodhya or Braj (associated with Visnu's incarnation as Krsna) is more than a sacred remembrance of the past; it is an actual hierophany of the paradise of Visnu/Rama. The holy spots in Ayodhya represent the manifest (prakata) forms of transcendent (aprakata) archetypes in the paradise Vaikuntha. The occupation of the central and most holy site by a mosque is therefore a direct encroachment on the holy or divine itself. From such a point of view, the fight for control of Rama's Birth-spot can be seen as a divine fight. A historical religious ideal is transformed into a political programme.29 The ideology which aims at restoring Rama's rule in its pure form by eliminating the profane encroachments on it has become</page><page sequence="18">Ayodhya: a Hindu Jerusalem 97 a politic factor of increasing importance, particularly in North India, where the oppositions between Hindus, Muslims and Sikhs are most deeply felt, and where, as we have seen, the historical developments took place which gave the Hindu community its cohesion. This ideology is connected with the attempts on the part of fundamentalist Hindu groups, such as the Rastriya Svayamsevak Sangh (RSS), to make India a national Hindu state (Hindu Rds.tra), just as Pakistan is an Islamic state and Khalistan a wished-for Sikh state.30 On the religious level this ideology has led to the monotheistic aspect of Hinduism being articulated and assuming tangible, personal form, embodied as Rama. It is in this light that the exorbitant success of the recent Radmyatna television series should be seen. This series enthralled the Hindu population to such an extent that riots broke out when power-failures inter- rupted television-reception, and a television-station was stormed when the series (already stretched as far as human ingenuity could manage) finally came to an end without a sequel, 'the later deeds of Rama' (a kind of Uttararamacarita) being announced. As the re-capture of Jerusalem was the central theme in the ideology of the Christian crusades, so the re-possessing of Rama's Birth-spot, the Ramajanmabhfimi, gradually came to be central in this newly developed Hindu ideology.3' As we have seen, after the annexation of Avadh the English erected a fence around the Babri Masjid to prevent Hindus and Muslims from fighting over the spot. This policy was continued by the government of independent India. Hindus and Muslims alike were prohibited from entering the mosque. It is neither possible nor necessary to discuss all the incidents that took place around this holy spot in the last hundred years. It should however be mentioned that in 1949, in the aftermath of the partition, the Hindus suc- ceeded in installing an image of Rama and his wife Sita inside the mosque. As may be understood, this again led to serious riots between the Muslims and Hindus, and numerous legal actions were undertaken by both sides. The judge finally decreed that during the lengthy process of legal settlement the mosque should remain closed. In this way all goes relatively well until 1984. In that year the fundamentalist Hindu organization Visva Hindu</page><page sequence="19">98 Hans Bakker Parisad (VHP), a sister organization of the RSS, starts a new cam- paign to 'liberate' the Birth-spot of Rama, that is to say, to pull down the mosque and replace it by a large Hindu temple.32 This movement scores its first success in 1986, when a clever lawyer from the neighbouring city of Faizabad procures a court judgement which declares the closure of the mosque to be legally unfounded. The gate of the fence is opened, and a stream of Hindus enters the mosque to worship the idol of Rama which has remained there all these years. As may be imagined, with the VHP growing more and more succesful and winning more and more adherents, a large number of politicians seek to connect themselves with this popular movement. In particular, right-wing Hindu politicians united in the Indian People's Party (BJP) expect-rightly, as has since emerged-to be swept to political power on the shoulders of this mass-movement. On the Muslim side, a national action committee is started to protect the Babri Masjid. The ruling Congress Party of Rajiv Gandhi, which traditionally is dependent to a high degree on votes of the Islamic section of the population, desperately tries to avoid the looming Scylla and Charybdis by portraying itself as the defender of India as a secular and united state. This tight-rope feat becomes increasingly difficult, however, as the polarization of Hindus and Muslims continues. In the election-year 1989 the VHP, supported by the politicians of the BJP, make a brilliant move. In order to mobilise as large a mass of Hindus as possible for the 'liberation' of Rama's birth- spot, a new campaign to replace the mosque by a temple is laun- ched. The model for this was Somnath, where, after the destruction of the Hindu temple by Mahmud of Ghazni, and despite the razing of later rebuildings by the Muslim rulers, a large Hindu temple had recently been erected. The idea behind the campaign was that action committees should be formed in all cities and villages with more than two thousand inhabitants, to consecrate a number of bricks in accordance with Vedic ritual. These bricks, consecrated in long and elaborate ceremonies (always something capable of rousing Hindu enthusiams), should then be brought in procession to Ayodhya, and, after much orthodox ceremony surrounding the laying of the first stone on the site of the mosque, should then be used to build the new temple. This campaign may be said to have been largely successful.</page><page sequence="20">Ayodhya: a Hindu Jerusalem 99 When I visited India in the autumn of 1989, the election- campaign was in full swing, and the disputed Babri Masjid in Ayodhya had become its central and dominant theme. The leaders of the Indian People's Party openly backed the brick-campaign of the VHP. All over the country bricks were being consecrated with much pomp and ceremony. The processions bearing the con- secrated bricks often passed through districts and villages inhabited by Muslims, and this frequently led to bloody riots. Rajiv Gandhi's ruling Congress Party was put under so much pressure that it finally gave in and gave permission for the first stone of the planned temple to be laid on 9 November, 60 meters in front of the gate of the mosque. A total of 300,000 consecrated bricks streamed into Ayodhyaf, and hundreds of people died, frequently in horrific fashion, in the ensuing violence. A curfew was imposed in many places, including Benares. Hindu youths marched provocatively through the streets, chanting slogans like the following: That Hindu whose blood does not boil has water in his veins, youth that does not serve Raimajanmabhfimi is youth lived in vain.33 An illustration of the clashes that resulted is provided by the occurances in Bhagalpur, a fairly ordinary village in Bihar, as reported in the Indian press (Hitavada 19-11-1989): It was Friday, October 27: the Muslims had just said their prayers in the newly built makeshift mosque when they found themselves sur- rounded from all sides by fierce mobs. One pretext trotted up by them was the presence of a Rajpur imam to read the namaz. 'Why bring an outsider,' they asked. The Muslims explained there was nobody educated enough in the village to preside over the Friday prayers, but the mob wouldn't listen. The scared Muslims gathered in the house of Minnat Mian, the only building without a thatched roof that would not collapse when torched. Later in the afternoon, the local head of police along with some policemen made their appearance and assured them safety. Meanwhile, houses in the Muslim quarter had begun being set ablaze with both sides exchanging brickbats. 'My hands were aching, we had hurled so many stones,' recalled Suleiman. When night fell, the stone throwing stopped but the houses continued to burn. Suleiman and a few others managed to escape to Rajpur but the rest stayed put in Minnat Mian's house. One escapee was killed,</page><page sequence="21">100 Hans Bakker but late in the evening an army contigent arrived. The army officer personally counted the number of people sheltering in the house and handed over charge to the local policemen, leaving word that he would return next morning to remove them elsewhere. When he did, almost all of them were dead. It was the silence of the graveyard. Fundamentalist organizations sanction the use of force on the part of the Hindus. A statement is issued saying that (Hitavada 13-11-1989): [the laying of the foundation stone] is the result of sacrifices made by hundreds of thousands of Hindus over centuries to redeem Ramajan- mabhumi and establish the temple. 'The restoration of the birthplace of Rama' is symbolic of re-establishment of our national pride just as the reconstruction of the great Somnath temple was. Nor are any scruples felt about annexing and misusing, not to say abusing, the spiritual legacy of Mahatma Gandhi in support of the new ideology (Hitavada): When Mahatma Gandhi envisaged freedom, he dreamt of and defined the independence as 'Rama rajya.' His whole life was inspired by Lord Rama.34 The Times of India (7-11-1989) rightly remarks in a commentary that: There is hardly a village where the consecration of bricks for Rama's temple has not been held. And almost everywhere the ceremony has evoked a popular response. Lord Rama and his controversial birth- place is fast becoming a Hindu symbol, as no previous ones, uniting co-religionists accross caste barriers. In the elections of late November 1989 the Congress Party is defeated. Particularly in North India, where the new Hindu move- ment was most successful, the opposition inflicts a crushing defeat on Rajiv Gandhi's party. The Indian People's Party BJP rockets from 2 to 88 seats in the newly elected Loksabhai (parliament). This trend is continued in the state-elections in early March 1990: the BJP even acquires an absolute majority in the state-parliaments of Himachal Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh.</page><page sequence="22">Ayodhya: a Hindu Jerusalem 101 A year after the first stone of the temple on Rama's Birth-spot was placed, the question flares up again. Hundreds of thousands of 'temple-builders' (kdr sevaks) are called upon by the VHP and other fundamentalist Hindu groups to march on Ayodhya. The leader of the BJP, Lal Advani, places himself at the head of this procession in 'Rama's Vehicle' (Ram rath) and is promptly arrested. Tens of thousands of soldiers seal Ayodhya off. Photos of inflamed Hindus waving flags on the domes of the Babri Masjid make the front pages of newspapers all over the world. The whole country is in the grip of the struggle around the mosque in Ayodhya. The secular and unitary state of India seems about to founder; the population, incited by religious emotions, seems deaf to reason, and the minority-government of the People's Front Uanata Dal)-together with the BJP the main winners of the 1989 election-seems helpless and at a loss. The BJP withdraws its support from the minority-cabinet of V.P. Singh and precipitates yet another government crisis. Like his predecessor Rajiv Gandhi, V.P. Singh had endeavoured to remain neutral in this conflict between members of two faiths, but he too is brought down by the new Hindu fundamentalism. In December 1990 communal disturbances and riots claim hun- dreds of lives. Noteworthy is the fact that the disturbances clearly are spreading to the south as well. 'Temple-builders' are arrested in large numbers. Ayodhya becomes a military fortress, and new fortifications in the shape of a wire-fence and barbed wire are placed around the mosque. The new minority-government, led by prime minister Chandra Shekhar and formed out of a faction of the Janata Dal, is completely dependent on the support of the Congress Party and seems about to fall at any moment. The idealized image referred to at the beginning of this article of a country and culture in which peace-loving tendencies are stronger than elsewhere, seems more than ever to be a mirage. Epilogue Our conclusions may be summarized as follows. During a process of interaction with Islam, a new Hindu self- awareness gradually emerges, particularly in North India. This</page><page sequence="23">102 Hans Bakker self-awareness draws heavily on the mythological material of the Rdmayana. The worship of Rama as the highest, personal, God becomes ever more prominent. Hindus of other sects also increas- ingly partake in this movement, so that a shift in emphasis appears to take place towards the more monotheistic aspects of Hinduism. Related to this, the feeling of belonging to a single (religious) com- munity spreads during the nineteenth and twentieth century from the militant monastery-orders to large sections of the population. The myth of King Rama provides a new utopic ideal of a summum bonum here on earth: the Rama rdjya. The first step towards the realization of this ideal is seen in a very concrete action, which inspires violent emotions: the 'liberation' of Rama's Birth-spot in Ayodhya. This goal not only unites Hindus of all castes all over the country, but also provides an effective instrument to harass the Muslim population, which is regarded as the major hindrance with regard to the realization of this ideal, and as an encroachment on the holy order. The result is large-scale disturbances which result in the death of large numbers of Hindus and Muslims. By imposing strict measures the state-authorities and the central government in Delhi just manage to prevent an outright civil war. India has known countless wars, but none of them can be called 'holy wars' in the sense defined here. The developments sketched above, however, have led to the incorporation into Hinduism of a number of elements which have been associated with the idea of a 'holy war.' These elements are: 1 the formation of an exclusive community of Hindus who share the desire for a common good; 2 a shift in religious emphasis towards a single, personal, God, Raima; 3 a tendency to see Islam and its adherents as agents of evil (which may be described as demonization of the enemy); 4 the regading of Hindus who perish during conflicts with Muslims as victims for the common weal. The question may be asked whether Hinduism is developing into a monotheistic-like religion. As a rule historians rightly refrain from making predictions about the future, and I too will not attempt to answer this question. We may con- clude then merely by remarking that, though Hinduism has proved in the past to be a religion not prone to holy wars, recent developments in Indian society unfortunately have made the pro- spect of a holy war between Hindus and Muslims seem only too real and close.</page><page sequence="24">Ayodhya: a Hindu Jerusalem 103 BIBLIOGRAPHY Abu-1 Fazl The Akbar Nama.

The article has been translated into English by Drs. H. Isaacson. I In the famous Indian handbook on politics, the Arthasdstra, the king is regularly referred to as vjigigsu, 'he who wishes to conquer,' an epithet which is not given a religious justification. The duty of the nobility (kyatriya) is defined as: 'Studying (the Vedas), performing sacrifices (with the help of brahmin priests), dotation, liv- ing by arms (sastrajivana), and protection of beings' (1.3.6). 2 Heesterman (1985) has traced the origin of this conflict in the Indian tradition to the opposition between the Hindu ideal of world-renunciation and the reality of social conditions. 3 Cp. Encyclopaedia of Religion and Ethics (ERE) s.v. 'War' (XII: 677): 'While the Vedas are sufficiently war-like, and Braihmanism gives a consecration to the military caste, the mild spirit of Hindu religion tended to view war under the repugnant aspect of murder.' 4 Burkert 1986: 81ff.; Colpe 1984; Kippenberg 1991a. Cp. also Bruce Lawrence's (1990: 107) restriction of the fundamentalist world-view to monotheistic traditions (cp. Kippenberg 1991b). 5 ERE s.v. 'War' (XII: 682): '[Augustine] had no difficulty in deciding that there are unjust and just wars [...] Just wars are those which are waged to inflict punishment, or to secure reparation for injury or (as in OT) by express command- ment of God' (ref. to Quaestiones in Josue III.2 584f.). For a study of the develop- ment of the idea of a crusade from this concept cp. Vanderjagt 1991. 7 Cp. Mead 1964: 244f. 'The individual enters as such into his own experience only as an object, not as a subject. [...] Existence of private or 'subjective' contents of experience does not alter the fact that self-consciousness involves the individual's becoming an object to himself by taking the attitudes of other individuals toward himself within an organized setting of social relationships, and that unless the individual had thus become an object to himself he would not be self-conscious or have a self at all.' 7 Eibl-Eibesfeldt 1975: 146; Gladigow 1986: 151ff.; Kippenberg 1991a. 8 Burkert 1986: 82f. See also Brodersen 1991. 9 Noth remarks in his Heiliger Krieg und Heiliger Kampf in Christentum und Islam (1966: 21f.): 'Fassen wir als "heilige Kriege" bewaffnete Unternehmungen auf, bei denen die Religion allein das Gesetz des Handelns bestimmte und nicht</page><page sequence="28">Ayodhya: a Hindu Jerusalem 107 zugleich Volkswohl, Landesverteidigung, Staatsinteresse oder nationale Ehre mit im Spiel waren, dann hat es "heilige Kriege" im Islam auf staatlicher Ebene nie gegeben. Missionskriege, die als heilige Kriege angesprochen werden k6nnen, waren die Kdimpfe der Muslims noch nicht einmal zu Lebzeiten des Propheten. In der Folgezeit wurde der Missionskrieg zwar theoretisch konzipiert, aber nicht in die Tat umgesetzt.' Cp. also Weippert 1972: 490. 'Der "Heilige Krieg" als eine von "profanen" Kriegen unterschiedene Institution ist weder im Alten Testament noch in aufier-biblischen altorientalischen Texten nachweisbar. Es empfiehlt sich, den-auch sonst problematischen-Terminus zu vermeiden, wenn auf den von G. v. Rad und seinen Vorgaingern und Nachfolgern damit bezeichneten Themenkreis Bezug genommen wird.' 10 Weippert 1972: 485ff. 'Wichtig erscheint mir jedoch die Erkenntnis, dafi diese Motive in den assyrischen K6nigsinschriften eine legitimierende Funktion haben. Sie sollen zeigen, dafi in den Kriegen des K6nigs und seiner Truppen der Wille des Reichsgottes Assur und der anderen grofien G6tter vollstreckt wird, dafi der K6nig als vicarius deorum auf die Weisung und mit dem Beistand seiner "Herren" handelt. [...] Die Legitimation kann auch propagandistisch verwendet werden, etwa bei offentlich zugiinglichen Siegesstelen. Auch in Israel l1fit sich die legitimierende Funktion der Motive vom g6ttlichen Eingreifen in Kampf- handlungen mit einiger Sicherheit feststellen' (o.c. 487f). The 'polytheism thesis' should be examined further with respect to this historical material. This is, how- ever, beyond the competence of the present author. " The papal proclamation of crusade can, on the contrary, not be regarded separately from attempts to bring complete power (plenitudo potestatis) into the hands of the church. Cp. Noth (1966: 21f.): 'Der Character des islamischen Staates (oder spaiter der islamischen Staaten) als Gemeinschaft, in der Religion und Politik untrennbar miteinander verbunden waren, [...] verhinderte es, dafi der Kampf gegen Ungliubige ein reiner Religionskrieg wurde.' 12 Cp. Mead 1982: 173 'The individual may indeed sacrifice the physiological organism for the benefit of the group; man as an organism may go down and give his life for the group which persists. Body and mind thus have different unities.' Though Noth (1966: 135ff.) emphasizes the personal character of both the Islamic duty of jihdd and the Christian vow to take up the cross-which both promised the individual the fruits of martyrdom in the hereafter-we should not lose sight of the fact that in both cases the individual was strongly reminded of his holy duty by a collective body, either the Church of Rome or the Islamic state, the avowed beneficiaries of the individual's sacrifice. 13 Cp. the Bhagavadgfta 10.3.6,38: 'I am the gambling of cheaters, the energy of the energetic ones. I am conquest, I am resolve, I am the vigour of the vigorous. [...] I am the rule of the subduers, the policy of those "who wish to conquer," I am the silence of things hidden, I am the knowledge of those who know.' Agaystyasamzhita 5.47: 'For those who live, having realized that the self is eternal Rama, there is no misdeed and no misfortune arising from a misdeed.' 14 This is not to say, of course, that community did not exist in South Asia. But communities were basically founded in the social ramifications of caste and village. Though Stein rightly attributes a significant role to religion (worship) in the for- mation of communities on local and regional level, the postulated 'segmentary state' testifies eo ipso to the limitedness of the communities involved. Stein 1991: 'Com- munity must be understood according to the usual English signification of being simultaneously a people and a place, rather than in its limited and debased usage as sub-caste or religious group. [...] However, in addition to the sharing of sen-</page><page sequence="29">108 Hans Bakker timents and values, community is also about shared rights or entitlements over human and material resources. Thus, in its particularities and under conditions of premodern technology, community pertains to smaller, local spatial entities.' The picture becomes more complicated when we take Buddhism into considera- tion. Already in an early stage Buddhism tended to extend the community of monks (safigha) to the community of all followers of the Buddhist faith. Conse- quently in that community the concept of the Bodhisattva, the one who tem- porarily sacrifices his own salvation for the benefit of all, could arise. 15 For instance expressed in the Bhagavadgftd: 'There is nothing transcending me, O Dhanarpjaya: this universe is strung on me like pearls on a string' (7.7). 'I know all beings, past, present and those to come, O Arjuna, but no one knows me' (7.26). 'But there is another, Highest Person, who is referred to as the Supreme Soul: He is the eternal Lord who pervades this universe and sustains it.' Cp. Chaudhuri 1980: 148f.: 'In the foreground stands one object of faith for all Hindus. It is a genuine, monotheistic, personal God. [...] Though he is a personal God, he is never thought of or spoken about as an anthropomorphic God in a physical form. [...] Nevertheless, this Bhagavan has never been worshipped, nor has he ever been an object of regular prayer. [...] Below this God there was the specific world of the Hindu gods [...].' 16 Ibn Asir's Kdmilu-t Tawdrikh, Elliot and Dowson 1867-77 II: 468f. 17 Mulla Ahmad Tattawi's Tdrikh-i Alfi, Elliot and Dowson 1867-77 II: 471f. 18 Kdmilu-t Tawdrikh, Elliot and Dowson 1867-77 II: 470f. 19 Abu-1 Fazl's Akbar Ndma (transl.

Lawrence 1990: 240. 27 In this connexion it is significant that the term (and concept) 'Hinduism' was first introduced by the missionaries of the Baptist Missionary Society in Bengal at the beginning of the 19th century (Ward 1817: 348, 427), for lack of an ade- quate indigenous term. See van den Bosch 1990: 18. 28 For St. Augustine the NewJerusalem was not a historical geographic reality, but the City of God situated at the end of time. In the eleventh century, however, when pope Urban II proclaimed the First Crusade, this idea became reified in the actual Jerusalem that only awaited emancipation from its desacration by the Gen- tiles (i.e. Muslims). (Robertus Monachus 1866: 729). 29 Cp. Riesebrodt 1990: 243. 30 For more information on the history and background of the RSS see Ander- son and Damle 1987. Though it is not the aim of the present paper to depict the rise of Hindu fundamentalism, several tendencies indicated here are evidently at the core of the fundamentalist world-view as described by Riesebrodt 1990: 214ff. Cp. also Freitag 1989. 31 In the early phase of Hindu fundamentalism (as embodied in the RSS) the 'liberation' of Rama's Birth-spot in Ayodhya did not yet take a special place. Gradually it was realized however, that to combine fundamentalist aims with a pilgrim's goal like Ayodhya had unparalleled mass-mobilizing potential. A similar</page><page sequence="30">Ayodhya: a Hindu Jerusalem 109 process seems to have taken place in the history of the crusades: 'Der Einfluti des Pilgerwesens, wenn nicht auf die Entstehung, so doch auf den Character schon der ersten kriegerischen Orientfahrten der Abendlinder ist bekanntlich sehr stark gewesen, und die Verbindung von Wallfahrt und Heidenkrieg kann geradezu als typisch ffir die gesamte Kreuzzugbewegung gelten. Den Anstoti dazu hat wiederum Urban II. gegeben, indem er das Wallfahrerziel Jerusalem zum Marschziel der geplanten Orientexpedition bestimmte. Dati Urban Jerusalem in seinen Kreuzzugplan aufnahm, ist wahrscheinlich aus Griinden der Werbung geschehen, denn-wie Erdmann fiberzeugend hat nachweisen k6nnen-sah Urban den Zweck der Orientexpedition nicht in der Eroberung Jerusalems, sondern allgemeiner in der Befreiung der Orientalischen Kirchen.' (Noth 1966: 128). 32 As described in van der Veer 1987, this campaign found little support from the monasteries and temples in Ayodhyfi itself, which feared that the turmoil involved would endanger their own income. 33 jis hindu kd khun na khaule, khun nahimn vah pant hai/janmabhumi ke kdm na aye, vah bekdr javant haill// (India Today October 31, 1989: 29). 34 The nature of this 'abuse' can be illustrated when we apply the typology of 'religious revivalist movements' proposed by M. Riesebrodt 1990: 18ff. Riesebrodt reduces this type of movements to a 'Krisenbewufitsein' as a result of 'rapider sozialer Wandel,' but he distinguishes two types of response. In search of authenticity both responses make an appeal to a 'g6ttliches Gesetz, eine Offen- barung oder auf eine ideale Urgemeinde' (e.g. the Rama rajya). 'Doch kann dieses Ankniipfen an eine ursprfingliche ideale Ordnung mythisch oder utopisch ausgerichtet sein. Als Mythos hat sie die Funktion einer restaurativen Krisenbewiiltigung. Das "Goldene Zeitalter" soll durch Riickkehr zu seinen w6rtlich tradierten Ordnungsprinzipien wiederhergestellt werden. Als Utopie dagegen dient die ideale Ordnung zu einer "progressiven" sozialreformerischen oder sozialrevolutioniiren Krisenbewiiltigung. Nicht den Buchstaben, sondern den "Geist" der in der Vergangenheit einmal verwirklichten idealen Ordnung gilt es unter neuen Bedingungen zu realisieren. Demzufolge ist das "mythische" Denken tendenziell durch eine rigide Gesetzethik, das "utopische" Denken dagegen durch eine radikale Gesinnungsethik gekennzeichnet." (o.c. 20). It is clear that Mahatma Gandhi exemplifies the 'utopic' type of movement, whereas the movement described here should be classified as 'mythic.' Riesebrodt proposes to restrict the use of the term 'fundamentalism' to the latter type of movement.</page></plain_text>
