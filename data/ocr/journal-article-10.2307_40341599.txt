It is certainly not easy to condense into a few pages the enormous mass of historical evidence that has been gathered from the numerous excavations carried out in nearly every part of the continent; still less easy is it to expound its significance and value. Suffice it to say that this evidence has appreciably modified the scientific view of what constitutes our essence as humans: biologists have taken note of the proofs that have accumulated, and are still arriving, on the map of evolutionary theory, and every other branch of science has had to take account of what has emerged from the pages of our distant past. The finds of fossils of hominids in the Olduvai gorge and other parts of South Africa are now famous; their presence in geological levels of extraordinary antiquity, dated to about 2-2.5 mil- lion years ago, occasioned a surprise and a scepticism that did not last long. Their attribution to the genus Australopithecus has not caused long polemics, nor were many objections raised when Leakey considered that he had identified the new species Homo habilis in the fossiles found together with stone tools which had undoubtedly been worked. And beyond these are the discoveries with still earlier dates, made to the east of Lake Rudolf, which would seem to modify the already astonishing situation by placing the genus Homo in levels several hundred thousand years older than the Olduvai series. One may think of these fossil genera as hominids that are no longer brachiators, i.e. not having a locomotory activity like that of gibbons, but al- ready largely freed from the necessities of a treedwelling life ; the archeological and paleoclima- tic evidence is clear and points, at least for the African deposits, to a drier environment than that of the present day, with an extension of the savannah at the expense of arboreal vegetation in part of the continent to the south of the Sahara. The modifications of the eco-system must have been accompanied by a substantial adaptation of diet: the preponderantly vegetarian nour- ishment suitable to life in the forest must have been followed by a more generalised diet, per- mitting adaptation to the changed environmental conditions. Indeed, progressive emancipation from every rigid specialisation was certainly one of the most important elements in the succes- ful advance of the prehuman line. Thus in this first part of the Pleistocene certain basic elements are discernible: the upper limbs are already freed from the slavery of walking on all fours, and it can never be emphasized enough that this long phylogenetic process must be given the main credit for an unsuspectedly powerful thrust towards the series of messages which a "fortuitous" manual activity has already begun to exchange with the brain through the medium of the visual apparatus. At this point probably there has already started the uninterrupted phase of perceptions, gradual apprehend- ings, and reflections that will lead to the first flashes of consciousness. Some of the senses will inevitably be much attenuated, and the hand with its sense of touch will move into the empty place, giving rise to the thought that this was responsible for most of the subsequent cultural evolution of the "phylum". The altered diet, to which I have referred, was perhaps also due to the diminished amount of green areas. These facts are well documented archeologically and the evidence provided by food remains found in association with prehuman fossils is clear; the traces of varied diet are pointed out and bear witness to that proteinic regimen which, even if not preponderant, was well</page><page sequence="2">3 6 Fabrizio Mori enough established to furnish good evidence that the pursuit of small animals was in its first stages. But the main part of nourishment must have continued to be based on food-gathering: the evidence with regard to present-day human groups, living in desert or semi-desert surround- ings, is significant; anyone who has the smallest experience of life in such eco-systems, especial- ly in Africa, knows how hard and laborious and meagre in results is the hunting of animals whose speed arid strength are the weapons of a defence that man does not always succeed in overcoming. In fact the diet of such populations is still vegetarian for about 70 per cent and is only occa- sionally integrated by the necessary quantity of pro teinic substances. Besides, even the owners of large flocks and herds who roam in the loops of the Niger and the Senegal, or on the tab- leaux of central-eastern Africa, display an extreme reluctance to using any of their own beasts for food. The accumulations of animal remains found in Pleistocene deposits may reasonably be con- nected with the prolonged stay in the same place of a single group or of different groups, or equally well with repeated seasonal visits. On the other hand the presence of bones must not be interpreted as a sign of particularly successful hunting; in most cases the big game could have been bagged, as still happens sometimes today, on the occasion of the natural death of one specimen and then have been consumed after transporting part of the carcass to the habitual dwelling area. The remains of mammals used for food that have been found in the different levels of Olduvai show significant aspects of a basically human behaviour and the typological examination of the stone tools leads one to think that their prevalent use was in breaking up, crushing and grinding vegetable substances, and only less frequently in killing and cutting away flesh. The practice of hunting, at any rate and within the limits stated, has definitely started; with it the earliest forms of association, stimulated by the search for food, must have been represen- ted by scattered families consisting of few individuals. Chance encounters with wild animals were certainly not uncommon, but it is reasonable to suppose that the prehuman beings of the lower Pleistocene still found their most efficient de- fence in flight; struggles with representatives of the same species or of different species of the same genus still seem, at our present stage of knowledge, to be an hypothesis more fanciful than serious. Interspecific struggles for survival, in which the burgeoning phylum was becoming expert, are a very different thing from aggressivity between members of the same species (intraspecific), of which today we are victims and perpetrators. That at the basis of the two phenomena there may also be a congenital element seems proved, but to assert, as do some authors, that the mo- tives of the second are embedded only in our primitive impulse toward hunting is, to say the least, hasty and incorrect. The very necessities of the chase must, on the contrary, have stimul- ated progressive and concrete forms of solidarity; if these last within the small groups had arriv- ed at less and less ephemeral structures (for the wellknown phylogenetic motivations;, then also between different conspecific groupings there must have come into being intermittent, pro- visional alliances; nor was there any necessity for those "struggles", which do not seem to be at all substantiated by low demographic density set in relation to territory and sources of food supply. Lorenz himself refers to the "malign intraspecific selection" which must have had a be- ginning at a certain point in human history, when the selective pressure of the environment on man became less severe and gave free rein to the spirit of group competition. But this spirit, in its extreme consequences, develops and reveals itself only quite late as the result of a long series of cultural conditionings, when the survival instinct gets absurdly heightened by terror lest</page><page sequence="3">Brief Remarks on Cultural Evolution 3 7 territorial usurpation, loss of a part ofone "food reserves, and diminution of prestige, may lead to a lowering of the threshold of vital security. And it seems to me worthy of note that such a concept can and must be correctly stated in great part through the observations which paleth- nology can conduct, while collecting every smallest trace, upon the various cultural moments that have characterized our coming into being. In the last decades prehistoric researches in Africa have meanwhile multiplied; the results of the various finds integrate and support one another in turn. Numerous industrial "fades" have been brought to light in nearly every region: the total number of stone implements available to specialists is imposing and the increase in their forms and functions, together with the improve- ment in the techniques of working them, becomes gradually evident as one draws farther from the dawn of the Pleistocene. With the perfecting of the industries following upon the lower Paleolithic (in Africa, Early Stone Age) one notes, finally, the gradual increase in that process of interaction between envir- onment and culture which, springing from a quite perceptible phylogenetic base, responds with notable variations of pliancy to the ever less stringent demands of nature. Human life expands, in space and in its own expressions. In the periods around a hundred thousand years ago caves and caverns, which previously could have been only seldom frequented, are more and more often the permanent or semi permanent home of families or groups, now that greater familiari- ty with fire permits their easy defence. The possibilities of nutrition and, in consequence, of demographic expansion must have considerably increased if such diverse and important factors as the following are added together: language and greater facilities in the communication and transmission of cultural elements; greater psychic adaptation to the environment with the con- sequent possibility of moving away from watering points, which in certain areas were the only places suitable for settling in; group organization; improvement of arms; increase in forms in- strumental for social activities; use of fire; dwelling in natural shelters. Archeological evidence, which is nearly all relevant to the purpose of considering the econo- mic activity of certain populations, may also with luck sometimes provide us with information about their social life. The instances of typological variability noticeable in the stone imple- ments are evidence in favour of a greater cohesion within those groups that produced them; such a phenomenon of lasting association must in fact have brought about a series of behaviour- al modifications which continually reinforced the group structures. It is maintained - and it seems to me reasonable - that the residual selective pressures of the environment could not per- mit the luxury of serious intraspecific struggles and that cooperation, rather than competition, was essential to the sociative pulsions. The first "moral" rules must have made their entry, in the guise of defences that were often unconscious, into a humanity still full of uncertainties, surrounded by a chaos which only the slow formation of individual and group consciousness, together with the progressive extension of identification and of language, had been able apprec- iably to reduce. And equally stimulating seem to me the hypotheses formulated about the necessity, in the psyche of prehistoric man, of the search for an order that might be and become explanation, justification, religion. In the final part of the Pleistocene there exist clear evidences of burials in association with food, arms and ornaments; the Old World, perhaps with a certain crhonological advantage of Europe with respect to Africa, sees the marvellous explosion of art which is to be considered the most ancient form of language that has materially come down to us, and which is indissol- ubly linked to what must have constituted the "religious world" of prehistoric man. Examples of it have been found on all sides, in this continent, from the Mediterranean coasts</page><page sequence="4">3 8 Fabrizio Mori to the tablelands of South Africa; scattered and mysterious, they are the testimonies left on the rocks by populations that have disappeared for millenniums. They also constitute one of the richest sources through which to arrive at suggestions and possibilities of investigation concern- ing the life of the prehistoric populations; the period they cover, starting from dates anterior to the Neolithic probably by several millenniums, reaches its apogee in the transition from an eco- nomy based on hunting/ fishing/ food-gathering to an economy centred on control of the env- ironment through the domestication of certain animal and vegetable species. Very numerous in the regions of the great Saharan massifs such as the Tassili of the Azgher, the Tadrart Acacus, the Hoggar, the Tibesti, the Atlas range, they offer a set of records unique in the world for art- istic splendour and palethnological importance. This wide-ranging series of works of rock-art has undoubtedly led to a better statement of some problems relative to the "interpretation" of prehistoric art. It is in fact necessary to emphasize that the totality of the images which we are accustomed to describe as "prehistoric art" cannot be judged according to the same aesthetic canons and with the same critical ideas as those with which the "visual" art of historical times is examined and analysed. Certainly the latter, too, cannot be studied, if one wants to do so correctly, without taking account of the period in which it was executed, of the social, economic and political environment which was the soil where it flourished: contemporary studies are quite explicit and in accord on this point. But in dealing with the "artistic" products linked to the multiform and elusive world of the most remote ages, our critical sense must be still more watchful, our reserves fuller, our rigour complete. In a word we should try to free ourselves from the countless, unobserved condition- ings that tie us to a particular type of highly industrialised culture within the ambit of other communities contemporary with it and variously arranged in the mosaic of cultural differences; all of them, in any case, very far from what might have been the world of prehistoric man and his way of conceiving reality. However perspicacious may be our interpretation of the most remote works of art, however lucid the reasoning that attributes to them this or that sense, however logical may seem the anal- ogy with the corresponding "art-making" of the primitive men of today for all that, our ideas about the model that prehistoric man might have constructed of the reality surrounding him, continually adapting it to new necessities, will inevitably always be deformed. Let us think of the diverse relations that he had to maintain, in the various periods, with the environment; his necessities were directed in great part toward the animal world from which, besides, came answers essential to the purpose of the conservation of the species. The dialogue must have been intense; and even if we do not know what its themes and syntax were, we may certainly argue that, in the biome of which he was a part, he had ever more eagerly paid regard to the aspects that interested him most until he became conscious of them and "identified" them. We may think that the whole of the observations made upon the reality around him was very largely based on the attitudes and responses that could have reached him as stimuli of primary importance from the animal world. And it is therefore indispensable to take into consideration the possibility that most of the system of communications also was based on the model that man may have made of reality. This model, and its varying realisation in the course of the devel- opment of the individual and of the species, is linked to the system of reflections and forecasts useful for attaining the best adaptation to the environment; it is, at least in part, the result of a very long process through which the communications system of H.sapiens was repeatedly re- fined and enriched.</page><page sequence="5">Brief Remarks on Cultural Evolution 3 9 The aesthetic sense was certainly not foreign to him, if to this expression we give a wider meaning: if we free it from the equivocal senses that are sometimes assigned to it, if in short we include it in the category of those needs, in part innate and in part acquired, abstract and im- palpable, which still today appear linked to the most hidden and least known part of our ner- vous system, that which exercises the greatest sway in the emotional affairs of the individual. On the contrary, the aesthetic sense must have presided at the conception, the trials and the realisations of the first forms of art; rationality and emotions, mixed in varying quantities, fused together in a crucible from which there slowly emerged lines and plastic forms, and for these the pre-existing models of stone implements had certainly furnished repeated suggestions and unconscious inspiration. The qualitative leap with which the first artistic manifestations confront us is, in fact, only apparently abrupt; it too must have followed the slow process that seems to have characterized prehistoric man's conscious apprehension of every "fact" and every "idea". If this conscious apprehension seems to be linked to the network of communications that are exchanged within a group and to their elaboration in an individual's nervous system, we must also presume that the velocity of transmission of such varied elements has undergone profound modifications in the last fifty thousand years. Our knowledge is scanty and conjectural, but it is enough to think how arduous and laborious still today is the "awareness" necessary to the accomplishment of any cultural operation for one to realise that the slowness and infrequency of the exchange of information that may be supposed among our predecessors, some tens of millenniums ago, gives to the appearance of the first art forms the value and significance of a real revolution in the field of the bio-cultural history of Homo sapiens. The interpretations of the separate works have been and are the object of most discerning and deeply eighed reflections: nevertheless, like the more general theories that try to explain the phenomenon in its origins by supplying a key for the underlying sense, they seem fated to remain in the ever-increasing group of questions without answers. The analysis of a picture is certainly tied to the observer's complex system of ideas; beside the bolder and less plausible hypotheses there are, it is true, interesting pages to be read; the logical evidences on which they rely are valid; the intellectual severity, the perseverance that have led to their elaboration seem by themselves to constitute an effective argument for credibility. And yet they are all to be put away in the great storehouse of conjecture: the semiotic key to these countless messages on rocks perhaps disappeared for ever at the moment when the groups for which they were inten- ded broke up. All this must be said, but a similar critical sense cannot permit to be accepted the pressures of those who hold that one should not go beyond observation of the evidence fur- nished by research in the field, nor proceed to any interpretation or reconstruction of the possible formative process of what appears to be the world of the most ancient artistic remains: magico-religious thought or, better, religious without further distinction between religion and magic, The language and the method of modern art criticism are not logically adaptable to the study of these ancient works; in the rare cases in which they are not ignored, and this happens in nearly every treatise on the "History of Art", the scientific approach smacks of that detach- ment, of that semi-nudity which, in giving prominence to a gap which there is no intention of covering, fills one with discouragement rather than with indignation. In this field it is no longer a question of critically examining the forms or of reading their hidden sense; bearing in mind that this will remain for the most part and for ever unknown, the problem will have to be approached by other routes, at once more modest and and more spa- cious. It will be a question in fact of setting this extraordinary phenomenon in the broader context of the biological and cultural development of our species, reflecting again on the</page><page sequence="6">40 Fabrizio Mori various stages in the light of all the data that researches carried out in the various branches of the prehistoric sciences can offer. Every connected group of art works is linked, in space and time, to an infinity of factors, some of which can be particularised by means of inquiries in the various fields of physical anthropology, botany, climatology, arriving (when possible) at the simplest cultural concordances such as correspondences with the industries based on various materials, i.e. bone, stone, and the more recent pottery. Each of these connected groups must then be looked at afresh by itself, and thought about afresh in the environment whose central lines at least it will be possible with luck to make out. Then probably one will manage to grasp more correctly the general picture within which a cer- tain artistic phase flourished and passed away, and one will also be able to grasp that environ- mental tissue to which and from which continually passed emotional and "economic" stimuli, both linked to the most basic necessities for survival. The fundamental differences for example, between the Franco-Cantabric and the Saharan works of art, over and above their different chronological placings, must certainly be studied on the plane of the deep environmental differences that constituted their raison d'etre. Among the latter group too, scattered from the Atlas Mountains to the Hoggar, the various phases are car- acterized by aspects differing greatly between themselves. The graffiti, taken as a whole, are separated from the paintings by something that goes well beyond the pure and simple contrast of techniques; the most ancient phase, that of the "great wild animals", offers with its superb engravings a view that has little in common with the subtle and enigmatic world of the "round heads"; this, in its turn, does not give any advance notice of what will be the salient features of the art of the shepherds, all turned toward the delicacy of the forms, which is linked to more narrative and earthly purposes. Each of these phases can offer important starting-points for considerations about behavioural patterns, rites and myths, but what seems to me more im- portant is the general picture that each single phase can offer in regard to the cultural develop- ment which had been attained by the group linked to that phase. Let us take for example the already mentioned paintings of the "round heads". Extraordinary and numerous in the Saharan massifs of the Tassili and the Tadrart Acacus, they are still almost unknown even to the special- ists. One is not dealing, to be sure, with the most ancient artistic manifestations, but it is also true that they constitute one of the rarest groups of prehistoric works, valuable for the countless hints and the profound impressions they offer us concerning the "spiritual" life of the human group who in them wished to write and reread their own mystical beliefs. Their absolute crono- logy is still largely unknown; we know that they are anterior to the fifth millennium B.C., through a dating with the radio-carbon method obtained in the Tadrart, but by how much is unknown. Their number and the great quantity of styles perceived among them lead one to think that this phase may have lasted for several millenniums, and that the human groups who were the invisible protagonists may have belonged to different "races". This phase does not present physiognomonic characteristics so clear-cut as those of the subsequent pastoral peoples: its figures, save in exceptional cases, are represented with oval or perfectly round heads; no trace of any facial lineaments appears and the bodies are always lacking in sexual attributes. The phallic sheath, it is true, is sometimes to be seen, but this is in connexion with scenes of ritual dance that fit perfectly into the basic structure of the whole extensive series. There is, in short, clearly the wish to not realise these particulars; a wish probably tied to a definite idea of what those figures had to represent: beings who had only the blurred outlines of men and of women, who were not "real" men or women, and who sometimes are reproduced with fantastic deformations that give the immediate sensation of mythical creatures. It is not a remote possibi- lity that this phase go beyond the "neolithic" limit hitherto assigned to it; but far more impor-</page><page sequence="7">Brief Remarks on Cultural Evolution 4 1 tant considerations must be drawn on the type of "metaphysical" rapport that seems to mark the Weltanschauung of those populations. This is no novelty in the cultural history of H. sapiens over the last fifty thousand years, inasmuch as particular modes of procedure for interments, the use of ochre in conjunction there- with and other vestiges lead one to recognise growing anxieties about death. The evident con- sciousness of this biological "fact" would already constitute in itself a very strong argument for discussion concerning the cultural and social stage of our species in times anterior to the appear- ance of the first art form. Here it will suffice to recognise that this consciousness is a strong support for maintaining that those art forms, far from constituting the "origins" of art, must have been preceded by a long period of preparation in which the socialising activities of the individual, together with the awareness of the importance of non-material means to achieve sur- vival, must have been continually strengthened until they became a model of established and traditional behaviour. The analysis of prehistoric art, in short, tells us more of the "how" our distant predecessors lived their reality than of the "what" they wished to represent. It is the very problem in its totality that has to be approached from the angle which offers the greatest probability of sta- ting it correctly. Every group of works, in the various regions and the different epochs, brings us its own particular message: all of them in any case, from those manifestly paleolithic to those which belong to the border line between Pleistocene and Holocene, tell us of something that has profoundly modified man's way of life ; the relation with the environment has been altered and perhaps reversed. The repetition of certain figures, their separation from the indi- stinct chaos of forms which is slowly losing its nebulosity, implies a series of psychic attitudes and consequent behaviour that must have set the path of our genus on new bases, extraordinar- ily fruitful for social cohesion and intellectual development. The richness and variety of infor- mation that every image carried with it are still today a source of amazement; the great animal figures are not merely magic for the chase or sympathetic magic: they manage to make us discov- er new aspects in our way of considering certain species; to make us have an inkling of the new psychic bond that must have united the man of the upper Paleolithic to them so as to prepare the path for that slow, laborious development of consciousness which culminated in domestica- tion. The mythical figures that appear sporadically in Franco-Cantabric art but which populate, with a certain chronological lag, the shelters of the Saharan massifs signify the possession of a supernatural world, anthropocentric and anthropomorphic. It is a world, then, that is pivoted upon man, perhaps for the first time; it is made in his image, and if it is not given to us to know the ways of this mysterious journey, perhaps it is allowable to think that the anthropomorphic beings "invented" on the rocks of the Sahara express, with their polychrome language, the most ancient description of religious beliefs based upon a transcendent world that starts from man and is modelled on him - a world containing a swarm of creatures like him, who probably fore- shadow by many millenniums the multiform aspects taken on by the subsequent myths of the Mediterranean environment.</page></plain_text>
