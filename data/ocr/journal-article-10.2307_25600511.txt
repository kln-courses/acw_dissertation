<plain_text><page sequence="1">MICHAEL G. COOKE Romanticism and the Paradox of Wholeness Towards the midpoint of To the Lighthouse Virginia Woolf brings Mrs. Ramsay into a secluded state, without light, or sound, or smell, or movement. The setting might almost seem a casual prophecy of recent experiments in sensory deprivation. Mrs. Ramsay, though, ex periences no revulsion, no hallucination. She becomes a kind of instan taneous global presence. With contentment she thinks of herself as "a wedge-shaped core of darkness"; she devotes herself to withdrawing not only from people and objects and attachments, but eventually from all but unfocused light and a final consciousness of herself dissolved in the dark rolling sea, in ecstacy. The moment is uncanny, and not alone for its anticipation of Virginia Woolf's death. It passes quickly. Mr. Ramsay, officious and selfish as ever, misses his wife and, catching her attention with a presumed desire to "protect her," effectively forces her back to the reality of the everyday world. But from where, and from what? Is Mrs. Ramsay doing more than what Hamlet shrinks from, willing her own dissolution and giving up the ghost? Or is she uncannily, as she appears to regard it, getting rid of overspecified, confining, even privative connections in favor of par ticipating in the all? Those of us who like to keep busy and manage things and make improvements will side with Mr. Ramsay and say she has been saved for life, while those who cannot abide that portentously good-looking and aging gentleman will wish to see Mrs. Ramsay off to ineffably better things. This brief episode cannot be followed out in To the Lighthouse. By a defect of what I would call the novel's economy, it plants the germ of issues and expectations that the entire work does little to articulate towards a viable point. Lily Briscoe's painting perhaps is the technical obverse: a piece of material reality supposedly encompassing the inef fable, whereas Mrs. Ramsay represents reality surrendering, dissolving to ineffability. The episode merits our attention less in itself, than as a late, faint manifestation of a major phenomenon of the romantic period in England and Germany, namely, the poising of the individual yearn SiR, 24 (Spring 1985) 435</page><page sequence="2">436 MICHAEL G. COOKE ingly between annihilation and omnipotence. Faust and Manfred and Alastor stand out as examples, Coleridge and Fichte as commentators on this metaphysical drama. It is not, in romanticism, an isolated drama. The all is only the most blatant and panoptic expression of a problem that occurs as often as the romantic poet seeks to establish propriety-in-place, that is, the standing of any entity which is proper to itself and free to assert independence from any other, but which is obliged to maintain relationship to reach its fullest growth. Blake, with his burly blitheness, is capable of reducing this problem to a trick of perspective, like looking through different ends of a telescope, so that the single person caught at one end is equally the vast panorama registered at the other; Albion gives us individual man, England, and the world primordially made of the unified giant. Likewise the "earths rolling in . . . space" only manifest "all the eternal forests . . . divided" (Europe, pi. 10). Even Blake, though, makes it plain that the right and, in certain cases, the need to go it alone turns into a self-diminution. Thel defeats herself with the demand for uniqueness, and Albion can only fulfill himself when he gives over selfish guilt and surrenders himself to reconciliation. In other words, the problem is not one of perception or logical definition, having to do with the class to which an entity is assigned. It is basically a question of the capacity of the entity, taking capacity in moral terms, to the extent that choice and responsibility apply, and in metaphysical terms, to the extent that choice modifies the character and quality of the entity by altering the disposition of the elements it interacts with. This point may be illustrated readily with reference to Wordsworth's "The Thorn. " Martha Ray is really three different people as she occupies three different environments: the isolated and for that reason defenseless love affair with Stephen Gill; the separated position at the village out skirts, where the villagers make accusatory sorties and where a kind of animistic superstition on their part proves her sole, frail defense; and the implicitly bonded position where the narrator and hence the reader see the horror more than the error of her position and strive, however ineffectually, to shield her from censure and despair. At bottom Martha Ray's is an insoluble problem, because there is no communication among the three sets of forces in her life, and thus no hope of reconciliation. Obviously she is not communicating with any one, except by the cryptic repetitious cry, "oh, misery," "oh woe is me." In turn the villagers are too much caught up in their feelings of prurience and righteousness to respond to her crushing grief. And the old sea-captain, though all but involuntarily caught up in her grief, lacks (a) the courage and the skill to deal directly with Martha Ray, and (b)</page><page sequence="3">ROMANTICISM AND THE PARADOX OF WHOLENESS 437 the will and the ethical force to confront the villagers meaningfully. He falls back on the ploy of agnosticism, suggesting that we do not know enough to judge Martha's acts, when in fact he wants us to judge her state and accord her pity and protection?for we know enough of her state, and it is humanly grievous. The world of "The Thorn" is made up of simple characters and even simple situations, but these are involved in complex and resonant rela tionships. What sometimes may keep critics from acknowledging either the complexity or the resonance of the poem is the fact that the rela tionships are at an impasse. Little happens, little changes. But in the eyes of the narrator, and probably of the poet, that is an aggravation of the poem's tragedy, not grounds for slighting it. "The Thorn" remains a tragedy of avoidance. Even the old sea captain who is inspired to try to shield Martha Ray approaches her for shelter for himself and has come to the village to leave the world behind. In this respect, it is impossible for Wordsworth to do more than intimate by omission the kinds of growth and reconciliation that would bring Mar tha Ray, Stephen Gill, the outsider seaman and the vindictive villagers into one, all-embracing order of experience. In fact Wordsworth tends to resort to nature, and to avoid human personality, where he pursues reconciliation and unity. The Borderers ends in fragmentation and avoid ance and so does a tonally very different work like "Resolution and Independence, " in that the poet never even conceives of keeping up a human relationship with the leech-gatherer, who is overtly changed from a suffering person to a sustaining symbol in his mind. It is possible, then, to see an underside deficiency in the continuity from part to whole that Wimsatt recognized in "The Structure of Ro mantic Nature Imagery." The continuity is not all-encompassing, but substitutive, and it substitutes nature for man in vital ways. The "all" eludes the romantic writer, even where an innovative cohesion and continuity can be shown to be intrinsic. Does this mean that romanticism is humanly defective? No one would say that. Wordsworth adopts one emphasis while Blake, for example, adopts another. Blake is willfully human in his orientation: "where man is not, nature is barren." Not that Blake does not show human inco hesiveness of a severity equal to Wordsworth's. To the contrary, Jeru salem and The Four Zoas are predicated on cosmic incohesiveness. What truly distinguishes Blake is his ability to put his characters into open interaction even as they insist on going their own way with their own closed minds. The need to assert or merely to live their prejudices makes every Blakean character paradoxically vulnerable to every other. The more solipsistic the character, the greater the need for others. Thus it</page><page sequence="4">438 MICHAEL G. COOKE becomes necessary for Albion, who merely wants to maintain his un worthiness, to be forever leaving without ever being gone. He is in a relationship of un worthiness, and as there remains some relationship there remains?and this holds good throughout Blake's work?some grounds for ultimate unity. The fact that Oothoon continues to wail every day means that Theotormon has not changed, but not that he cannot or will not. And yet neither Wordsworth's unity of a symbolic nature nor Blake's unity of a mythic humanity quite secures command over the all. Words worth's Snowdon vision evaporates. And there is no guarantee, in piv otal situations like The Four Zoas 9:127:16-36, that Vala's revelatory and liberating response to the summons of nature (which is oddly sacra mental for the curmudgeonly Blake) will not revert to Thel's; nor indeed is there any controllable reason why it should have not been the same as Thel's, timorous and self-immuring. Given that the sense of the all is the sense of a moment, and also has a partial base, it is no wonder that Thomas McFarland, in his recent study of Romanticism and the Forms of Ruin, should have come out with such a negative view of the matter. But we can profitably turn back to Thel and to Martha Ray for instruction as to what we seek when we talk of wholeness. Both these women, whether by will or force of circumstances, are cut off from a dynamism and interactivity with the world, to the extent that it is known by them. The question must be asked whether theirs is a limitation of knowledge or one of commitment. And Blake's images of wholeness seem to suggest that it proceeds from dynamic commitment, not necessarily but effectively. To ask for some thing logically incontrovertible, fixed, and faithful is to turn Urizen, and to give over the very dynamism that alone seems to make wholeness available. That is to say, available in the mode of creatures who, as Shelley noted in the very throes of desiring wholeness, are not "immortal and omnipotent." Let us concede that for the most part what emerges clearly in roman ticism is that all relationships fall into uncertainty, with the nature of identity fused, and confused, with the question of wholeness. The ro mantic mind assumes the task of perceiving and expressing the all, and even more of relating to it. Ways of managing this task abound. Met aphors of marriage, the harmonizing of faculties and emotions, the rhetorical figure of synaesthesia, the new aesthetic emphasis on the sublime, travelling and thresholds, states of possession and psychic pa thology, androgyny, and even incest: all these can be recognized as part of the search for forms that can survive at the juncture of personal integrity and structural wholeness.</page><page sequence="5">ROMANTICISM AND THE PARADOX OF WHOLENESS 439 The conception of wholeness?for that word covers both the individ ual and the cosmic dimensions of the case?as a problem is something of an identifying mark for romanticism. Lucretius, enunciating the atomistic views of Democritus, woos us to settle with our own insig nificance, with the aleatory condition of all things. An antithetical phi losophy, Platonism, inculcates at once a radical sense of inadequacy in individual being and an orientation, as to an unreachable magnetic North, toward ultimate beauty and good. Similarly, Pyrrhonism with its reins on the intellect and Thomism with its relish for the intellect's formal power have in common a firm placing of the individual in the total scheme. No more than the briefest reference to Tillyard's The Elizabethan World Picture will be required to convey the sense of rank and order prevailing at that height of the Western tradition. But perhaps our best picture of the change wrought by romanticism will come from comparing versions of wholeness in romanticism and the last great period before romanticism, the neoclassical age. On one side let us focus on the summary lines concerning the Stuart reign, in Windsor Forest, a work of precocious authority that evinces the total absorption of a system by a writer, and vice versa. And on the other side let us consider the lines on the ascent of Mt. Snowdon from the final book of The Prelude, a work of tenacious, almost neurotic incom pleteness, where even the episode in question is chronologically out of place, as though sequence and form, fact and meaning hang asunder, and where the writer is as much at pains to discover as to convey a sense of system. For Pope, discovery changes the known order only by intensifying it. Thus the sway of England increases when new lands are found. New people fit into the scheme of understanding and value as, earlier in the poem, new birds fit into the hunter's scheme: they are trophies, they are food. By the same token, the objects of nature exert no influence in and of themselves. "Thy trees, fair Windsor," Pope intones, "now shall leave their woods, / And half thy forests rush into thy floods, / Bear Britain's thunder, and her Cross display. ..." Forests turn into navies, meeting the preconceived demands of empire, while their solitude (vast ness, chiaroscuro, fleeting sounds and singular flowerings, a violet by a mossy stone) impinges not at all on whoever comes to exploit their resources. The shift into romanticism can be glimpsed in relation to this image of forests as ships, for what Pope sees as prescriptive right and orderly exercise of power at the source, Byron in Don Juan perceives, at the stage of finished product, as "a wilderness of masts." Byron returns the wood to nature, not as contained and controlled forest, but as wilderness.</page><page sequence="6">440 MICHAEL G. COOKE Perhaps more than Tillyard allows, Pope apprehends the dynamism behind the relationships within a hierarchy. He is attuned to power, but so identified with those who hold and wield it as to fall into an ecstacy of imperial egocentrism: "For me the balm shall bleed, the amber flow, / the coral redden, and the ruby glow, / The pearly shell its lucid globe infold, / And Phoebus warm the ripening ore to gold." There is one world for Pope, and it is English: "Unbounded Thames shall flow for all mankind, / . . . Earth's distant ends our glory shall behold, / And the new world launch forth to seek the old" (italics added). What Hegel will say about the complementary flabbiness of the lord and firmness of the bondsman is denied here. The bondsman is much the slacker of the two, in Pope's portrayal, for where Hegel's bondsman is so for failure of thought, Pope's remains so by thinking bondage a privilege. The question of power immediately separates Wordsworth from Pope. On the face of it Wordsworth's depiction of Mt. Snowdon yields nothing to Pope in the way of hierarchy; the calm, bright, single moon sits above the dense variegated clouds, the clouds in turn above the shapeless, unruly, unavailing sea. The most that might offer itself in palliation is the fact that the human figures can move from the bottom toward the top of the hierarchy. But the essential picture carries a far different value, even ignoring the fact that the moon sitting in the firmament is not a permanent fixture. For one thing, the apparent vertical division is broken by the lines of communication and sympathy proceeding reciprocally from sea to sky: the moon attentively gazing, the ocean sending up through the clouds sounds that are "felt in the starry heavens." Again, each order of being has a presence in the existence of the others. The mist is a sea, a hill, has a back, a tongue. Above all, the moon waits at the service of the most lowly and bewildered, as both Wordsworth and the ocean appear to be when he sets out "to see the sun rise." At best the moon is a shy, a surprise power, known only to those who climb, and unanticipated by them. It is "sovereign" to be sure, but the Atlantic over which it presides is "majestic." No upper hand is guaranteed, no hierarchy is ordained to abide. The subtle equalities of Wordsworth's vision may be easier to bring off in a natural order than in Pope's social one. After all, despite the chain of alimentation and Darwinian theory there is nothing in nature to match the systematic, self-seeking domination of one people by an other that social life affords. It costs Wordsworth precious little, seem ingly, to be kindly and democratic. But we may detect in Pope's social structure an unnatural fixity, a denial of versatility and surprise (which even Darwin endorses), whereas in Wordsworth's natural panorama much that is social, and indeed moral and intellectual inheres.</page><page sequence="7">ROMANTICISM AND THE PARADOX OF WHOLENESS 441 When Wordsworth writes that the hills "their dusky backs upheaved," he makes the hills (a) livelier, (b) more intimate, and (c) more acceptable in their distinctiveness?they need not be shiny like the moon?than Pope seems capable of conceiving. The scene, or rather the situation at Snowdon is positively humanizing for the protagonist, and yet avoids being anthropomorphic. Wordsworth evinces a larger capacity to relate to the terms of the world, Pope a stronger ability to bend the world's phenomena to his terms. The effect is, with Pope, a certain admirable simplicity of conception, but with Wordsworth a higher achievement of harmony and unity, where sea and cloud and sky, and man, variously claustrophobic, benighted, agonizing, graced, and freshly lucid and grateful, all merge into one moment, one meaning. Nor should we disregard the lurcher and the hedgehog, for they too have a part in this Wordsworthian unity far superior to the function of fodder that Pope attaches to animal life. As earlier in the poetry-writing episode in Book iv of The Prelude, Wordsworth here makes animal life the stimulus to a basic awakening of the unfocused mind and spirit, a rousing out of stupor or narrowness or defiance or whatever curtails the amplitude of the individual being and his context. Let us recall Words worth's eager recollection of "glad animal movements" in "Tintern Abbey," and let us recall that "animal" is derived from the Latin word for "spirit," in the sense of something possessing its own power of movement, with all that implies of decision and aim. Wordsworth knows he is on to something special, but it is striking that he skews his valuation toward the intellect, and toward the intellect in terms of conventional domination: the majestic intellect. The intellect should form no more than a troika with the moon and the sea, which are also sovereign and majestic. But Wordsworth wants it otherwise. He is suddenly committed to a fixed meaning, though he would have had no basis for that without the gratuitous combination of elements that the episode reveals. The intellect thus carries the poem out of the realm of phenomenal encounter and momentous revelation, and into a reincarnation of generality and abstract value. In retrospect the ascent becomes a progress, a formal eighteenth-century maneuver. This may constitute a good, but not unqualified. The vision of unity that has befallen Wordsworth clarifies and encompasses a whole, but his codi fying it denies one of its fundamental features, namely, its momentari ness as event, and further denies one of his own fundamental apprehen sions, of "something evermore about to be." If we look further into this shift in posture, and in value, we may recognize an influence coming from the unsettled relationship of self and whole. For Wordsworth's vision, merely vouchsafed, inspires but also implicitly belittles him. He is in the right place, but on the wrong track,</page><page sequence="8">442 MICHAEL G. COOKE and might almost seem an accidental, passive recipient of a good. In effect he must, as soon as he regains possession of himself, or of his powers of reflection, reestablish himself while not surrendering what he has gained. His claim that the mind of man is greater than the universe has a compensatory smack, and cannot be a declaration absolute. If it sought to be absolute, it would make the poem subject at once to charges of fallible economy, insofar as the spontaneous movements of Wordsworth's mind invariably lead him astray. But for the rectifying force of nature, which enters critically whether he is indulging in an all night grange party, trying to get an early start in the Alps, or stealing from other people's springes, he seems unlikely ever to have found his way. The person who confesses himself "fostered alike by beauty and by fear, " and who illustrates this truth from nature, must have a hidden agenda in suddenly crying up the mind over nature. Even the influence of books, such as Don Quixote, is embodied and realized through nature, landscape and shell and sea. Basically Wordsworth is responding to a necessary impulse to protect himself from the very wholeness of nature that he revels in. The human agent, the personal agent becoming greater by identification with the natural also runs the risk of becoming nil. It is to ward off that annihi lation that Shelley at the end of "Mont Blanc" abruptly introduces the question: And what were thou [Mont Blanc], and earth, and stars, and sea, If to the human mind's imaginings Silence and solitude were vacancy? The answer, of course, is nothing, or more strictly nothing to us. An anthropomorphic force and scale reassert themselves just where they seem, at the transcendental level of Mont Blanc, impertinent and im potent. They do so by a sort of metaphysical reflex, the same that keeps Manfred from throwing himself off the Jungfrau to merge with nature, the same that makes the actor-poet of The Fall of Hyperion fight the captivating effect of the food he has so eagerly shoveled home. Philosophy knows how to look with equanimity upon the problem of the individual's simple possession by a total system. As H. Wildon Carr writes in A Theory of Monads, The monad is the concept of an individual experience as an integral unity in which the subject and object are distinct but united in an indissoluble relation. Subject and object . . . are a unity in duality,</page><page sequence="9">ROMANTICISM AND THE PARADOX OF WHOLENESS 443 a duality in unity. Suppress either term or the relation that binds them, there is no remainder, all is dissolved. But that answer sticks in the craw of personality. The romantic period offers no more poignant instance of the personality's jealousy of its own part in a supervening whole than Coleridge's crying, in spite of his generous disposition, and despite the grand design of treating his and Wordsworth's poetry as one body, that he has poured his stream into another's river. It is an attitude prevalent enough to occur in Maria Edgeworth's Letters for Literary Ladies: To an enlarged mind . . . [considering] the universe as one vast whole, 'the conduct ofthat little animated atom . . . [the] self must be too insignificant to fix or merit attention' ... 'It might be nothing compared to the great whole, but it [is] every thing to the individual. ' We must be mindful of the fact that decidedly diverse thinkers in the eighteenth century provided for romanticism a legacy of systematic theory highly unfavorable to the individual. Hume, besides denying that there was the least evidence for the existence of an intrinsic self, pos tulates in his History of Great Britain that change is a matter of occasional crystallizations in a chaotic flux; human causation and worth do not apply. Montesquieu in his Esprits des Lois advances the conception of society as an organism developed in response to impersonal geographic forces. And Burke, shifting the emphasis from geography to civil con stitution, makes a cornerstone of his Reflexions on the Revolution in France the idea of society as an organic whole, comparable to Linnaean ecog raphy or the Newtonian cosmos. Not to belong, obediently and con veniently, is for Burke to be cut off, and to fall into "madness, discord, vice, confusion, and unavailing sorrow." And of course Hegel will come, in the thick of romanticism, to call the individual abstract and the universal concrete, and to construe as the imperious and sacred process of time the fulfillment of universal intent. Against such a background we must hear Wordsworth crying up the self-sufficing power of solitude, and both Godwin in Political Justice and Rousseau in The Social Contract proclaiming that the social system is not intrinsically wholesome, nor should it be impervious to the individual. But the romantics were not antipathetic to system in and of itself. They sought it, they sought to be its discoverer, and its propagandist. Thus Blake: "I must create a System or be enslaved by another Man's," little appreciating the inconsistency of trying to purvey his system when every person must labor under the same creative emergency as himself. Put another way, if everyone felt equally compelled to create a system, as</page><page sequence="10">444 MICHAEL G. COOKE everyone must desire not to be enslaved, then there would be a chaos of systems. In dealing with Blake's misleadingly monumental prophetic figures, it is all too easy to overlook the anxious, and ambitious motions of personality, just as it is too easy to miss the exuberance, the fun that goes into his monumental style. One is grateful for the occasional com ment of a David Erdman or an Irene Tayler on the merry side of Blake. But some headway can be made toward appreciating the Prophesies if we see the Zoas, and the Spectres and Emanations, as personal forces seeking to be universal, or to put it another way, as figures who like Milton's Satan want no part of a universe they do not imprint and control. Part of the genius of the poems, the "visionary forms dramatic" as Blake terms them, is that each person is allowed his or her own full voice; part of their tension and length is that nobody readily listens or trusts, so that the harmonizing of the clashing figures is infinitely slow, and seems to occur both precariously and arbitrarily. For a text of ample resonance and moderate compass, let us focus on the problem of wholeness in The (First) Book of Urizen. Toward the middle of the poem we find these lines: Then he look'd back with anxious desire But the space undivided by existence Struck horror into his soul. (xm. 45-47) The figure in question is not Urizen, though it may sound so. It is Los, the Eternal Prophet, and he is neatly poised between two horrors: that of the absoluteness of the whole, without specific identities, and that of infinite division, expressed in terms of pity which "divides the soul / In pangs eternity on eternity." The poem moves from an all-embracing but inaccessible wholeness, by a series of creations and births, to ever more minute actualities that are genuinely partitive, rather than synecdochic. That is to say, the parts are taken from the whole, not representative of it. First we see Urizen, then Los, then Enitharmon, then Ore, then "similitudes / Of a foot, or a hand, or a head, / Or a heart, or an eye ..." Everything, or every part, seems to be pressed into distinctness, into its own space and state. But the pressure toward identity is not an unchallenged ill. There occurs also a pressure toward generalization, though the wholeness of Eternity be lost. Urizen resurfaces in the poem to make laws "that no flesh nor spirit could keep," and with a brilliant combination of the everyday and the uncanny Blake shows the development of Religion as a ubiquitous spider web, and shows disease as a form of physiological</page><page sequence="11">ROMANTICISM AND THE PARADOX OF WHOLENESS 445 generalization, a "net of infection" corresponding to the web of religion. The web and the net are not entities, but entity-catchers and entity trappers. Deceptively, and yet revealingly, they are made up of a min imum of matter and an abundance of nothingness. Their design, in both senses, makes them work, and not their substance. The poet says that the forms of existence "forget their eternal life," and we must take this as a lament, and a denunciation. But what do we make of the counter-statement: "No more could they rise at will / In the infinite void"? Are they stopped by a deficiency or a denial of will, and was their eternal life enjoyed in a void? The (First) Book of Urizen cannot provide any relationship with the infinite, beyond that of privation or, in its guise as "void," that of dread. One of the inadvertent ironies of the poem is the way it stimulates sympathy for phenomena or feelings or relationships that prove hostile to its preferred sphere of infinity, such as the affection of Los for Eni tharmon, and the affection of the much-maligned Urizen for ordered and occupied space. In sum, the poem leaves personality maimed and spectral: similitudes of a foot. . . . But it leaves infinity, perforce, period. As the Eternals, who seem not to approve of our existence, shut them selves off with a structure highly reminiscent of the one misguided Urizen has entered earlier, we are tempted to ask with Shelley: "And what were thou ... if to the human mind's imaginings ... ?" What The (First) Book of Urizen establishes, at least by implication, is that wholeness must take the form of a synecdoche, and may not be intrinsically encountered. Blake furnishes a striking number of these synecdoches: "self-contemplating" (1.21), "a joy without pain" (n.iv.io), personal heroism (11.iv.14 ff.), laws and absolute common values (11.iv.34 ff.), creativity (iv.[6]x-v.xiii.27), pity and procreation (vi), mathematical ordination (vu), religion (vm.xxv.5 ff). He seems to omit little except the desire for infinity itself. This desire is sensitively explored by Shelley in Adonais, disclosing an admixture of poignancy and irony in the face of an insupportable existence and an unattainable abode where "the Eternals are." But it is Goethe in Faust who most tellingly articulates the longing for infinity at the heart of the romantic notion of wholeness, as he also brings out the implicit dualism, almost Manicheanism, involved in its pursuit. Following the impetuous passion and the metaphysical insta bility of its protagonist, Faust achieves the same range of approaches to wholeness as The (First) Book of Urizen. But where with Blake the narrator assumes the philosophical role, Goethe gives that role also to his erstwhile bookworm. Faust sums up his dual role: "Two souls, alas, are housed within my breast. / And each will wrestle for the mastery</page><page sequence="12">446 MICHAEL G. COOKE there." In actual fact Faust seeks a state in which he can have it all, becoming himself master of both worlds of his soul. He "longs to join" the quest of "the fiery god," the sun, in a scene at once utterly imperi alistic and pastoral, that is, Popean and Wordsworthian: On tireless wings uplifted from the ground . . . . . . should I see, in deathless evening light, The world in cradled stillness at my feet, Each valley hushed, fire touching every height, While silver brooks in golden rivers meet. Then mountains could not check my god-like flight, With wild ravine or savage rocky ways; But lo, the sea, with warm and tranquil bays, Would hold its beauty to my wandering sight. Faust is, however, too honest or too impatient to believe in his vision. He calls it "A lovely dream, but gone with set of sun. " And so it goes with his other more spiritual flights. He has possession of a magical "phial" that will set him "free" and let him "rise to spheres of pure activity, " but a mere bell ringing and an Easter choir bring out his sense of impotence and unworthiness, "in dust distressed. " He has his Mar gareta, but cannot keep her, as she changes into a mere "Gretchen." The supernal passions prove but a path to the "swamp of wretchedness, " a source of madness and remorse. He has "imagination, " and in its wake "diurnal defeat." He has his Helen, if only in similitude, and then is left with their offspring Hilari?n in slow self-immolation. Actually, only Mephistopheles is "part of" a whole, and yet "whole" in himself. And he is less than happy about it. The fixity of his situation robs it of any savor, just as Faust is robbed by the uncertainty of his. But it is Mephistopheles who best captures the nature of Faust's cond tion: "Let man's dim soul / Regard his toy-world as a perfect whole." He goes further and points out that neither annihilation nor wholeness is a workable value, for "annihilation's forces meet resistance, / From something coarse asserting its existence, " while on the other hand No mortal, from the cradle to the bier, Digests the bitter dough; a god alone Can hold this sense of oneness. In a blaze Of lasting light he sees a whole serene, But us he leads in chequered, darkened ways, While yours are broken days, With night between. Faust himself cryptically contends in Part Two that "the All" may be</page><page sequence="13">ROMANTICISM AND THE PARADOX OF WHOLENESS 447 found in Mephistopheles's "Nothing." But the deepest force of the text moves against satisfying his yearning "to feel the thrill of awe." The play may be construed as proceeding from an old devil-ridden religious convention toward a new humanistic dispensation in which Mephis topheles, and the pact Faust makes with him, simply prove otiose. Perhaps Homunculus, or science, provides a pivotal energy, certainly he provides a pivotal conception when he says to Mephistopheles; Of northern kin, Having in misty times your origin, In coil of priestcraft and Knight-errantry, How should you have clear eyes and vision free? Homunculus himself, the hermaphroditical figure of all potentiality, is also the embodiment of utmost vulnerability and offers nothing to advance the needs of Faust. Rather than advancing into science, the play swings back toward a nostalgia for the human. This is especially apparent during the classical Walpurgis-Night on the Lower Peneus, where the sound of "human voices mid reeds and rushes" so stirs Faust with longing. The chiron episode begins to give this nostalgia a moral and social bearing, with its emphasis on healing and versatility of gifts and mutual respect for one another. But its force is suspended upon mention of Helen's name, and Faust's consequent pitch into new "raptures," against the check of Chi ron's "soul sweet-willed. " Even the war episode, though not exempli fying humanism, bears toward it in two ways, by stripping some of the mystery from religion in the person of the land-grabbing, tithe-and rent-loving Archbishop, and by furnishing Faust with the ocean drenched land that will induce him to work for something, as humans must, rather than waiting for everything from"fiery god" or no less "fiery" Mephistopheles. For Faust, of course, the land represents his last chance (he has run out of space and time, and must go into the formless future of the sea) to make a whole world he can "call [his] own." But he is no more than a reflective Kubla Khan, aware that his omnipotent decree encompasses very little after all: "The flights of my all-powerful will / Are broken on this sandy hill." He realizes a new world, but also his old fear of being thwarted by "wild ravine or savage rocky ways." As he pushes further over what he expects to be the final threshold of happiness, he finds deceit, disaster, disillusionment, with Baucis and Philemon dead and himself "left to struggle still toward the light." The fact is that Faust has proceeded from the solitude of his profession, his study, to the solitude of his spirit, his essential standing in the face</page><page sequence="14">448 MICHAEL G. COOKE of the world. The first solitude is chosen, and effectual. The second is almost a perverse development of his numerous encounters. It weighs on Faust, as an expression of his incapacity to manage affairs (when he had been so successful in the order of study). The French psychiatrist, Michel de Salzmann has identified "egoism and separatedness . . . [as] deep motives for guilt." But for Faust guilt is not really a prelude to expiation or reconciliation. He goes into a sort of reflective selfishness that allows him to acknowledge his disabilities without ultimately giving over his ambitions. We can think a conventional moral revelation and conversion are underway when Faust at last comes to acknowledge the existence of the Grey Hags, Want, Guilt, Need and Care. We can think he is close to spiritual poise when he recognizes the absolute extremism of his pursuit of annihilation and wholeness. But he cannot relinquish this pursuit. His desire for, his avowal of humanity proves brief, and oblique. First, there is the contrary-to-fact condition: "Could I but break the spell . . . /I'd know at last the work of being man." Then there is the displaced subjunctive of the erstwhile star-gazer: "Fool, fool is he who blinks at clouds on high . . . / Let him look round, feet planted firm on earth: / This world will not be mute to him of worth." The passion for wholeness proves incurable in Faust. Benjamin Bennett calls it "a great tragic illness." An admixture of humanism, or perhaps hubris tic philan thropy colors it at last, but that only makes Faust resemble the wealthy old man of Blake's "The Mental Traveller," who gives to dominate, and who gets repressed hatred in return for his largesse. However indecisive, the movement toward humanism in Faust sug gests the absence of the kind of apodictic power which for Descartes saves man from utter isolation. From this absence, an interesting prob lem develops in romanticism, in that a reliable form of wholeness is withdrawn, while the desirable form of annihilation?namely, self-con scious annihilation?is denied. And yet something akin to self-conscious annihilation manifests itself in the period, with the sense of unrelieved emptiness that we find preeminently in Coleridge. In effect nothingness, which is external, takes the place of annihilation, which is intrinsic and personal, and also takes the place of wholeness, as all we know on earth and all we need to know. Works like "Limbo" and "Cain" and "Ne Plus Ultra" stand out in illustration, but the depth of Coleridge's preoccu pation with the conjointed self-and-nothing reveals itself in out-of-the way places: in the scene of the schoolboy entranced by "that fluttering stranger," in "Frost at Midnight," in Christabel's mind after all she believes in or dares acknowledge has been seduced away from her, in the imposing blackness of the "Song at Sunrise, in the Vale of Cham ouni," and in "Dejection: An Ode."</page><page sequence="15">ROMANTICISM AND THE PARADOX OF WHOLENESS 449 We should not pass lightly by the fact that Coleridge should be the one to unfold this slightly recondite dimension of the problem of whole ness. As a rule he projects a very positive attitude, though Dorothy Wordsworth suspected that he was just indulging in a "fanciful dream. " He avows that his nature requires "another Nature" for fulfillment, and adopts an image of the harmonious unity of a flute and clarion to bring home the point. This is a Notebook entry of 1803. More formally, in a letter of 12 March 1811 to Henry Crabb Robinson, he analyzed mutual love as the equivalent of "two correspondent concave mirrors" with "a common focus" in a situation that yields "endless duplication." Whatever drove him to pursue, or dream of wholeness proves also capable of withstanding heavy adversity. In the throes of his spiritual desolation, his Ancient Mariner retains the will to bless, or to offer a pattern of blessedness to others: "Tis sweeter far . . . / To go together to the kirk / In a goodly company." And in the throes of his own spiritual desolation Coleridge is capable of divining joy for his Lady, or Lady manqu?. Coleridge's was a nature finely calibrated to apprehend the forms of goodness, and indeed to invent them, as he does in "This Lime-Tree Bower, My Prison" with his gratuitous construction of a view for his inexperienced and unguided friends, and with his gratuitous conversion of their view into his vision. It would be interesting to speculate on the influence that sexual frustration might have had on his spiritual turns, given the situation in "Dejection: An Ode" and the folkloric connection between lime-trees and sexual excitation. But what must occupy our attention here is the fact that Coleridge's temperament and also his intellectual habits would have turned him away from the lure of nothingness. His theory of the imagination as secondary creation ("a repetition in the finite mind of the infinite I AM") precisely militates against the implied void of the uncreated world, and simultaneously establishes the ultimate self and the consummate whole. His theory of perception, embedded in his theory of imagination and further elaborated in such phrases as "multeity in unity," also should ward off the spell of nothingness. That spell nevertheless exerts its force, and offers one explanation of the separation of Coleridge from Wordsworth, for Wordsworth, feeling it in the "Immortality" ode exorcises it with the image of fire unquench ably burning under the ashes of hearth and taste and thought. In exor cising that spell, he exorcised an essential manifestation of Coleridge's spirit. But not everyone can be so fortunate, or so forceful. We should see that the spell of nothingness can arise anywhere in romanticism, and if Wordsworth in Book iv of The Prelude can look down with safety and profit over the side of a metaphorized boat to apprehend something of the reciprocal wholeness of sea and sky, this offers scant comfort to</page><page sequence="16">450 MICHAEL G. COOKE Heine's sailor who finds in the deep not his synecdoche for wholeness and transcendence but only a spur to rough authority and rude disillu sionment. In a sense the synecdoches of wholeness?and they are synecdoches, since wholeness does not admit of metonymy?represent a stay against nothingness, a something of which one can be sure and with which one can identify the whole. Blake furnishes the epigraph for an entire cultural movement in the opening lines of "Auguries of Innocence": To see a World in a Grain of Sand And a Heaven in a Wild Flower Hold Infinity in the palm of your hand And Eternity in an hour [.] The most salient and the most intricate example of this synecdoche is to be found in marriage. In The Last Man, for example, Mary Shelley speaks of Adrian, while he remains without prospect of marrying, as "destined not to find the half of himself. " But of course the marriage of Coleridge proved the opposite of fulfillment, and we have on record in "The Eolian Harp" the fact that marriage kept him from a certain access to the all. What we do not know is whether Sara Coleridge objected to a new formula of unorthodoxy, which would have been footling, or rather to the implied loss of self in the all, which would very much have accorded with the romantic outlook. Perhaps, by the very force of its predominant social reality, the metaphor of marriage drags against its own flight. One of the most beautiful and cogent descriptions of a marriage in romantic literature occurs in Friedrich Schlegel's Lucinde. It is meant to be symbolic, even prophetic of a new order. But it is either curiously conservative in effect, or merely eccentric; that is to say, it canonizes the nuclear family and the values of social intercourse on one level, and on another is unable to generate a pattern or reduplicate its ideal goal. Where Jane Austen tends to describe the process of coming to marry, Schlegel genuinely depicts a marriage, and we can share Schleiermacher's sense that Schlegel was doing something epochal without failing to see that Lucinde and Julius are in a conceptual bind: if they are only happier than most, their story loses scope, but where they have scope they fall into mere category. It is the predicament of romanticism all over again: the individual case relatively insignificant by itself, but lost to itself in the enlarging whole. The much grander marriage of man and nature brings out the diffi culty in porportionate degree, and reveals new ones as well. We should note that this marriage begins as a compounded metaphor: the marriage</page><page sequence="17">ROMANTICISM AND THE PARADOX OF WHOLENESS 451 of man and woman stands as a metaphor of wholeness, and that meta phor is translated into the relation of man and nature. But Nature plays Sara Coleridge, failing to go along with the ploy, to the nth degree. It continually upsets Wordsworth's expectations, from the rowboat epi sode to the ascent of Mt. Snowdon, and if in the meantime it engenders amplified, rectified, and illuminated understandings, these are never wholly reliable, or whole. Wordsworth recognizes as much, expressing a blend of optimism and frustration in the phrase, "something evermore about to be." Similarly, when he presses nature for a fixed value, he gets fluctuating indices. In "Evening Voluntaries vi" the bright daisies that are so strongly reminiscent of the host of golden daffodils in "I Wandered Lonely as a Cloud" actually keep Wordsworth from recog nizing the good he stumbles upon at dusk in the humbler grass, and he is led to complain about the changeable code of nature in the face of his constant desire for a message. Wordsworth's desire for clarity and constancy in nature by itself points to an underlying problem in the marriage metaphor, to wit, its being biased in terms of gender. In the marriage of man and nature it is presumed that nature is feminine, not as in the traditional guise of prolific mother, but as wife, as simultaneous sustainer and dependent; as Carlyle will say in Past and Present: "Nature ... is a heavenly bride and-, con quest"(italics added). An unequal concept of marriage is carried over, conservatively, into what appears a revolutionary, or at least transfor mative order. Thus Asia plays no active or constructive role in tempering Prometheus's suffering, or his mind. She waits demurely, immured, for him to work his way through the stony labyrinth of his defiance and his pride. Nor is the case much altered when nature has a more direct role. With Wordsworth, for whom the man-nature marriage is a leit motif, all the gifts, all the goods of nature are ultimately arrogated unto the mind, as though they were simply dowry. In person Wordsworth took no original approach to married life, and there can be little doubt that a cultural force enters to constrain the play of the marriage metaphor in his poetic hands. Margaret Homans has suggested that the same force inhibited Dorothy Wordsworth's expression of her close relationship with nature; that is, a woman (Dorothy) cannot consummate marriage with a woman (nature). But De Quincey recognized, as we in our own way do, that Dorothy's mind may have been more intimately and richly and comfortably wedded to nature than her brother's, and Wordsworth seems to acknowledge this in poems like "The Sparrow's Nest." Both nature and metaphor are malleable, with the result that, as Wordsworth feminizes nature, so could his sister have masculinized it to her conve nience. Besides, it is hard to divine why the marriage of man and nature,</page><page sequence="18">452 MICHAEL G. COOKE or mind and nature, should have seemed less scandalous than that of woman and nature. Apart from the problems arising in individual cases, the very wealth of synecdoches of wholeness suggests that a certain satisfaction must be wanting (just as the multiplicity of metaphors for Intellectual Beauty shows Shelley groping for something inaccessible). In theory the ro mantics knew this. In theory they renounced political and religious and philosophical dogmatism. In theory they espoused a new definition of method, as that which led to a compelling sense of resolution and satisfaction though the momentary stages might seem difficult and ob scure. In theory they believed in organic form, in emergent or self revealing wholeness that would be proper to the quality of the material in all its relations. But in fact they expect revolutions to succeed and a perfect world to succeed upon revolution. Keats compromised with art: Pipe to the spirit ditties of no tone: Fair youth, beneath the trees, thou canst not leave Thy song, nor ever can those trees be bare; Bold Lover, never, never canst thou kiss, Though winning near the goal?yet, do not grieve; She cannot fade, though thou hast not thy bliss, For ever wilt thou love, and she be fair! Goethe, more robust and demanding, compromised only with time (it is as a symbol of time, of Faust's presumed power to make time do his bidding, that the ocean serves): "Oh, stay, thou art so fair." Byron sought to avoid compromise by adopting attitudes of defiance and hi larious irony. Only Fichte persistently shunned compromise, even in the early Critique of All Revelation, where "noble souls feel far more fear and awe before themselves than before the might of all nature, " and where it is resolved "to derive the entire system of appearances, and ultimately the entire world of sense, from a causality through freedom according to rational laws. . . ."In the Wissenschaftlehre he elaborates on the con cept of a primary freedom inhering in das Ich, the ego or individual being in the act of consciousness. The finite self in time adumbrates and approaches the Absolute Ego, which essentially enjoys "absolute unity . . . with the Divine." Adopting metaphors, or synecdoches, of links in concatenation or notes in a melody or the prismatic multiplication of colors out of one pure light, Fichte staves off a conclusion in favor of determination, that is, the effective loss of being as a self. And yet even Fichte concludes that the particular and the Absolute merging in das Ich constitute the "one great mystery of the invisible world. "</page><page sequence="19">ROMANTICISM AND THE PARADOX OF WHOLENESS 453 For his crucial definition of the Imagination, Coleridge picks up on Fichte's act of consciousness, but he makes it his own by infusing it with strenuous process and cloaking it in doubt. The elements of the all bedevil the pursuit of the all, in a bewilderment of synecdoche. Perhaps Coleridge is fulfilling Fichte by changing him. For romanticism is not a matter of its elements, or their sum. That would imply a stated, accepted, and sustained certitude, such as the Augustans claimed and the Victorians longed for. The figures who evince that outlook in roman ticism, a Lycius here, an Alastor poet there, are tacit suicides who carry in their lives the pathos and in their deaths the doom of romanticism. At its more heroic and durable reaches romanticism embodies a drama of revelatory encounter, of ultimate participation toward a con tinuum that makes an old man double for a sea beast and a desperate woman for a sheltering ledge in a storm. It seeks to catch and render unharmed the whole complex of relation ships in a self-expanding universe, where to discover a violet by a mossy stone is not less significant than discovery of the Pacific or entry into the occult and the forbidden. Perhaps the problem for the romantic self in the romantic whole is a Heisenbergian one, to wit, that if the self knows where it is, it cannot know where it is going. But at best the romantic self responds with a bracing, and would-be reconciling "strug gle to idealize and to unify." Yale University</page></plain_text>
