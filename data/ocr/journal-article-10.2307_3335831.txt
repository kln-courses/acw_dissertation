Archaeological finds, be they metal, ter- racotta, or stone objects, allow a glimpse of the artistic production of time periods long passed and open the door for speculation about the history of African sculpture. It is the quest for the historical dimension in African art and culture history that draws scholarly at- tention of ethnographers, art historians, and anthropologists to such artifacts belonging foremost in the archaeologist's domain. Al- though scholars from other disciplines deal- ing with archaeological materials may occa- sionally run into difficulties when disregard- ing some of the basic methodological caveats of the neighboring discipline into which they venture, they may contribute to a greater un- derstanding of the corpus of objects and widen the narrow confines within which members of a given field find themselves. Schweeger-Hefel's book on the stone sculp- tures of the Nyonyosi is such a venture into archaeology, in this case by an ethnologist who has published extensively on peoples in Upper Volta, most notably the Kurumba. Her investigations have focused on the uncover- ing and reconstructing of cultural phenomena distinguishing the stratum of autochthonous populations from immigrants who founded states, such as the Mossi state Yatenga or the Kurumba state Lurum. Among the autochthonous stratum of populations are the Nyonyosi (lit. "the first who were there in the beginning," p. 3), who according to Schweeger-Hefel entered into an alliance with immigrants around A.D. 1530 to form a state she calls Lurum II. (Lurum I was a pure Nyonyosi state that came into existence around A.D. 1330 [p. 101].) The Nyonyosi partly retained their distinct identity, wielding 86</page><page sequence="2">above all magico-religious authority while the recent immigrants exert secular political power. This dualism, the presence of two dis- tinct population elements, is a fundamental structural principle manifest in all spheres of culture from the spiritual life to the material, tangible domain. In her previous book Masken und Mythen; Sozialstrukturen der Nyonyosi und Sikomse in Obervolta (1980), Schweeger-Hefel came to the conclusion that masks are the central struc- tural element in Nyonyosi culture, or, as she puts it somewhat cryptically in this book, "The mask is the central cultural possession of the Nyonyosi" (p. 3). Having established this link of masking with the stratum of the autochthonous population rather than with the newcomers, a finding supported by the results of other researchers in the area, she now sets out to deepen the historical perspec- tive on masking by introducing stone sculp- tures as evidence that the Nyonyosi had masks even before the immigrants arrived. These ancient masks "not only displayed formal similarities to the present masks, but also corresponded to them in meaning." Furthermore "the configuration of the stone sculpture illuminates the meaning frequently hidden in the present-day masks" (p. 3). To prove these theses is her central concern in the following discussion of the stone artifacts, which elaborates on and repeats in part previ- ous writings on stone sculptures she discov- ered when working among the Kurumba and in central Yatenga (see for instance Die Kurumba von Lurum, 1972, pp. 151-57, 174-84; and Masken und Mythen, 1980, pp. 219-21, 394-408). The stone objects she found are fascinating, and the interesting pictorial record of the pieces speaks for itself. They fall into two major categories. In the first part of the book, the author discusses stone sculptures of vary- ing configurations and sizes. The second part deals with stone steles marking the graves of high-ranking men, such as the tengasoba, the owners of the land, who belong to the autochthonous Nyonyosi. These steles are more recent than the heterogeneous corpus of objects analyzed in the first part of the book, thus allowing a different type of approach to their interpretation. In the final paragraphs, several interesting terracotta objects are in- troduced, which the author tries to link with some of the stone artifacts discussed in the ini- tial chapters. The first category of objects comprises three subgroups. The first subgroup consists of three fairly large and several smaller an- thropomorphic stone sculptures displaying certain stylistic similarities. All pieces are ex- tremely stylized in their representation of the human body: torsos with unpronounced ex- tremities and small, neckless heads. They were all used in ritual; the figure of Ourb, for example, impressive because of its simplicity and strength, was guarded by a blacksmith, a descendant of the autochthonous population, and used in a fertility cult. According to myths, these stone figures were given to specific Nyonyosi lineages by the same bush spirits that gave the masks to the humans (pp. 6, 96). Informants attributed all figures to pre- vious, unknown populations. The cir- cumstances of their discovery give no clue about their age. By means of the interpreta- tion of myths and the consideration of formal characteristics, Schweeger-Hefel places this group into a period before the founding of Lurum I. The second subgroup of stone artifacts con- sists of small-scale objects, most of them found near ancient settlement sites, at times just below the surface. Among these stone sculptures is a little janus figure bearing traces of a sacrificial patina (pp. 47 ff.). An incised linear design is highlighted by the application of white pigment. Another remarkable piece, a small grinding stone in the configuration of two phalli, acquires a second meaning be- cause of the incised linear designs: it also rep- resents two human figures, which the author interprets as a mother and child representa- tion (pp. 54 ff.). Here, as well as in a third sculpture of two phalli with several incised faces, Schweeger-Hefel sees the early occur- rence of formal characteristics and design ele- ments found in Nyonyosi masks. She consid- ers this as an indication that masks already existed when these stone sculptures were created, none of which can be accurately dated by archaeological means. She assigns this second group of objects to the population of Lurum I (p. 101). The third subgroup of stone objects, among them triangular grinding stones and little mallet-like pieces, all showing incised mark- ings of facial features, are miscellaneous finds, discovered below the surface by her as- sistants when plowing with modern equip- ment in areas once part of the ancient state of Lurum I. Again, there are no firm dates estab- lished for any of the objects, but because of their formal characteristics she considers them to pre-date Lurum I; yet they are not quite as old as the objects in the first subgroup (p. 101). Schweeger-Hefel's speculation about these interesting and varied stone objects compels the reader to contemplate several methodological issues, such as the basic ar- chaeological methods used in dating a piece. More importantly, the author's extensive use of myths that she collected about some of the stone objects and the subsequent extraction of attributions, as well as the interpretation of some of the stone sculptures' meaning from this verbal evidence, raises a general question that applies to the interpretation of ar- chaeological objects from other sites in Africa as well. This is the problem of continuity. Is there enough evidence to postulate physical continuity, and, moreover, continuity in thought, from the creators of the pieces to the population presently living around the site where the pieces were found, in order to allow the introduction of contemporary data? The answer may vary according to the specific cir- cumstances. Nevertheless, this issue should always be of prime concern when interpreting archaeological material by drawing on present-day data. A final consideration should be given to myths as historical sources. Schweeger-Hefel postulates that actual his- torical events are contained in myths which follow specific structural patterns (p. 100). It should be pointed out, however, that the in- terpretation of myths and the question of their historical veracity is a hotly debated issue among historians working with oral sources and that not all of them come to the same posi- tive assessment. The second part of the book contains a number of interesting findings about stone steles that represent two basic types: plain, flat stone grave markers and sculpted ones. Both types are connected with the Nyonyosi. Schweeger-Hefel uses distributional evidence to link the unsculpted steles with Lurum I and points out that their occurrence coincides with that of the abstract and abstract-figural Nyonyosi mask, which is, according to her findings, the oldest mask type of the Nyonyosi. Consequently, she postulates that the plain steles, produced by the same people who made the masks, are the older type of steles (p. 71). The sculpted steles that occur in Yatenga bear striking resemblance to present Nyonyosi mask forms in their formal config- uration as well as in their symbolic meaning (p. 70). Their creators, Nyonyosi who founded settlements in central Yatenga, were migrants from Lurum I. Some of them had left the area partly as a result of the turmoil that marked the creation of Lurum II in the 16th century. Only in their new locations did they "invent" the sculpted stone steles (pp. 73, 74, 102) in the late 16th century, which accounts for the lack of sculpted steles in the areas of Lurum I and II. According to formal criteria the author divides the sculpted steles into five types: steles in the configuration of the bifur- cate wooden pole, of the general mask form, of phalli, of the stele mask type, and of figures (i.e., anthropomorphic forms) (pp. 74 ff.). Then she discusses the relationship of each type of stele to specific types of masks and some of the stone objects dealt with in the first part. These formal comparisons (see the ta- bles of line drawings at the end of the book) are of great interest, adding new perspectives to the discussion of masking among the Mossi and Kurumba. amen pt 5-YEAR INDEX - Volumes 11 -1 32 pages, including a complete:~~~: tabl ofcontntsand xpaded 87</page><page sequence="3">In her final analysis of all the data, she suggests complex interlinking of all groups of stone sculptures, pointing out that in some cases these relationships are circumstantial (for example, in regard to the first subgroup, stone objects still used in ritual). While there seems to be little doubt about the attribution of the steles to the Nyonyosi, she ultimately links most of the stone objects to them as well, and expresses her conviction that her in- terpretation and analyses of the material and oral documentation have established that the Nyonyosi knew masks similar to their present ones very early, actually soon after A.D. 1330, the founding date she assumes for Lurum I (p. 103). This brief discussion of some of the theses brought forth in this book may provide a basic idea of how the archaeological material has been dealt with by Schweeger-Hefel. Yet, it is virtually impossible to give more than a rudimentary and incomplete outline of the book's basic premises because her treatment of the stone sculptures involves a great deal of speculation and presents an amalgamation of methodological approaches. Even if one is familiar with her previous work, most readers will find it difficult to follow her arguments. Nevertheless, it is because of her continuous efforts that we now have a comprehensive presentation of this remarkable corpus of ob- jects, which will no doubt stimulate further research bearing upon these complex hypoth- eses.
