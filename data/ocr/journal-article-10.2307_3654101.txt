<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Enchantment of Art: Abstraction and Empathy from German Romanticism to Expressionism David Morgan A familiar tradition since the eighteenth century has invested art with the power to heal a decadent human condition. Inheriting this ability from religion-the romantic enthusiast Wilhelm Wackenroder considered artistic inspiration to originate in "divine inspiration" in the case of his hero, Raphael'-art eventually replaced institutionalized belief in an evolutionary schedule of cultural development determined by German idealism. Hegel, for instance, theorized the evolution of spirit from religion to art as a qualitative advancement over time. Rejecting the metaphysics of German idealism, Friedrich Nietzsche nevertheless contended that "Art raises its head where religions decline." By assuming the "feelings and moods" of religion which had been dismantled by enlightenment, Nietzsche claimed that art gave new form to the life of feeling and imbued human endeavors with a "loftier, darker coloration."2 In the early twentieth century Wassily Kandinsky be- lieved that the "spiritual in art" was the historical manifestation of an "inner necessity" that was in itself timeless and universal. Kandinsky portrayed the "life of the spirit" as "a large acute-angled triangle divided horizontally into unequal parts." In a kind of "trickle down" aesthetic, the compartments of the triangle move slowly upward toward the apex, which is inhabited by the solitary genius of an age whose vision gradually elevates all those who occupy the lower stages.3 t Wilhelm Wackenroder, Confessionsfrom the Heart of an Art-Loving Friar, 1796, in Confessions and Fantasies, tr.

Thus, evil can be warded off by the use of an apotropaic amulet, and fertility can be enhanced by the recitation of a suitable prayer or the performance of a certain ritual. In a modem analogy a sense of impotence is often alleviated by a trip to the mall where the bored therapeutically lose themselves in symbolic acts of self-renewing consumption. In the traditions of philosophy and science, systems of representation such as astrology, the microcosm, the harmony of the spheres, the great chain of being, the celestial hierarchies, or the mechanisms of theurgy and divination situate humanity within a cosmos that follows a particular order accessible to and in some degree manipulable by human beings. Enchantment consists of an apparatus of belief whose form of representation or enactment is thought to exert influence over the realities it configures. But enchantment is not limited to the spells and magic of premodern metaphysics (or modem consumerism). By means of religion, morality, and aesthetics, Nietzsche once averred, "man likes to believe that ... he is touching the heart of the world."5 This study will focus on the manner in which art as constructed within the idealist tradition of German art theory functioned as an enchantment. Specifically, it will explore what the history of ideas about abstraction and empathy has to tell us about the spiritualization or enchantment of art. After identifying the philosophical and aesthetic where- withal of enchantment in nineteenth-century Germany, attention focusses on Franz Marc's early twentieth-century theorization of abstraction. It is cer- tainly more customary to study Kandinsky, whose writings and early efforts at abstraction are much better known, but Marc's ideas offer more immediate connections to German intellectual history and clarify the aims of his abstract art as a strategy of enchantment. Moreover, Marc was unusually articulate and wrote often, exploring ideas and artistic efforts with great insight. Focusing on Marc therefore offers a corrective to the historiography that has favored Kandinsky's writings. Finally, Marc differed from his Russian friend over the cause of the war. Manifesting a difference that is portentous for this study, Kandinsky left Germany for Russia in 1914, while Marc enthusiasti- cally took up arms for the fatherland. Given these circumstances and the unfortunate tendency of art historians to valorize expressionist art rather than situate it in the ideological context of its production, it is time to delimit more precisely than has usually been done what Marc sought to do and how it 4 On the role of enchantment in the history of scientific hermeneutics see Mark A.

Strategies of Enchantment: Abstraction and Empathy from Schopenhauer to Marc In the eighteenth century abstraction in the creation of a work of art was generally defined as the determination of the essence of a thing.6 The artist was thought to arrive at this essence by a process of generalization whereby particulars were eliminated until only a subject's generic, universal quali- ties-its essence-remained. It was this view that informed Hegel's discus- sion of the artist's treatment of the "essence" or "universal idea" and Schopenhauer's assertion that the individual was raised to the "Idea of its species" in aesthetic contemplation. Yet Hegel and Schopenhauer created idealist philosophies which were distinguished by virtue of a peculiar inter- pretive value, a capacity to account in a sweeping manner for the human condition and in a way that gave art a central importance. Hegel worked out a dynamic of history in which Geist or spirit drew ever closer to its ultimate self-expression and characterized in its development the historical ages of mind that allowed Hegel and his contemporaries to locate themselves in the final dispensation. "May the kingdom come," he wrote to Schelling, "and may our hands not be idle."7 A darker vision animated Schopenhauer's lamentation on the will as the basis of suffering. All existence groans and the only redemption is to recognize the true nature of things and to pursue the transcendence of art or the path of the ascetic. Each in his own way, Hegel and Schopenhauer offered an immediate revelation of true being in art. It was the concrete immediacy of this other that distinguished German romantic idealism. The enchantment of romanticism was that the absolute was not strictly absolute but immanent in nature, in the human self, and in the work of art. For Schopenhauer the art work disclosed the eternal platonic form under- lying appearances. Thus, "the object of aesthetic contemplation is not the individual thing, but the Idea in it striving for revelation."8 Knowledge of the 6 See David Morgan, "The Rise and Fall of Abstraction in Eighteenth-Century Art Theory," Eighteenth-Century Studies, 27 (1994), 449-78. 7 Quoted in Walter Schmithals, The Apocalyptic Movement: Introduction and Inter- pretation, tr.

This occurs when we devote the whole power of our mind to perception, sink ourselves completely therein, and let our whole consciousness be filled by the calm contemplation of the natural object actually present, whether it be a landscape, a tree, a rock, a crag, a building, or anything else. We lose ourselves entirely in this object ... we forget our individuality, our will, and continue to exist as pure subject, as clear mirror of the object, so that it is as though the object alone existed without anyone to perceive it, and thus we are no longer able to separate the perceiver from the perception, but the two have become one.... Now in such contemplation, the particular thing at one stroke becomes the Idea of its species, and the perceiving individual becomes the pure subject of knowing. The individual, as such, knows only particular things; the pure subject of knowledge knows only Ideas. (178-79) The legacy of German idealism persisted throughout the nineteenth century. The work of such philosophers and aestheticians as Friedrich Theodor Vischer and Eduard von Hartmann was fundamentally indebted to Schopenhauer, Schiller, and Hegel. Schopenhauer's philosophy was also vital to Nietzsche in the early 1870s, when his first published works defended direct access to the "primordial will" that he found embodied in Wagner's music.9 In 1907 Georg Simmel published his Schopenhauer and Nietzsche, in which he gave a long chapter to Schopenhauer's "Metaphysik der Kunst."'0 Schopenhauer's concept of self-alienation in aesthetic contemplation played a particularly important role in the early work of someone who had attended Simmel's lectures as a student in Berlin, the art historian Wilhelm Worringer. In his well-known Abstraction and Empathy (1908), Worringer drew an explicit analogy between his description of the transcendental inclination of the abstract Kunstwollen or artistic volition and Schopenhauer's discussion of escape from the realm of blind will by contemplative immersion in the work of art."l Before we can fully assess the idealist components of Worringer's thought, however, it is necessary to examine the development of empathy as a legacy of idealism. 9 See Nietzsche's Die Geburt der Tragodie (1872) and Schopenhauer als Erzieher (1874), and, on Nietzsche's debt to Schopenhauer, Julian Young, Nietzsche's Philosophy of Art (Cambridge, 1992). 10 Georg Simmel, Schopenhauer and Nietzsche, trs.

Two broad phases in the history of empathy theory should be distinguished. The first consisted of an enthusias- tic aesthetic experience which sought to break down the distinction between subjective feeling and objective realities, an experience often described in pantheistic terms. The second phase represents the attempt to construct a theory of perception in which human feeling is projected into forms through the eye's constructive acts of visual interpretation. In the first phase art was regarded as an affective, pantheistic, fundamen- tally romantic fusion of the soul with nature. The romantic poet Novalis had claimed at the beginning of the nineteenth century that no one could grasp nature who did not possess an "organ for nature" which, with an inner affinity with all things, "mixes itself through the medium of feeling into all natural entities, as it were, feels itself into them."'2 This idea persisted among empathy theorists in Germany. In 1876 the young aesthetician Johannes Volkelt expressed the enchantment of the pathetic fallacy: "When I feel my soul from out of the wind and clouds, the mountain and heath, the illumination of morning and evening, the presentiment penetrates me that nature is spirit of my spirit, that there is in the strictest sense no duality in the world."13 The most renowned advocate of empathy, Theodor Lipps, followed Heinrich W6lfflin in eliminating Volkelt's pantheistic monism from the treatment of empathy as a psycho-perceptual process. Lipps was instrumental in putting in place the second major understanding of empathy in the nine- teenth century.'4 In an essay of 1900 he sought to describe empathy as a psychological function fundamental to aesthetic experience. He characterized it as an "animation" of an object which becomes a mirror of the viewer's personality. According to Lipps, "Aesthetic harmony is grounded in the harmony of the personal and the foreign...."5 Empathy is a working out of one's relations with the objective world by means of objectifying oneself. "Aesthetic sympathy means this: to experience and feel oneself in another, at 12 Quoted in Paul Ster, Einfihlung und Association in der neueren Aesthetik.

Aesthetic enjoyment based on this is the felicitous feeling of the objectified self."'6 This notion of empathy inverted the kenosis or self-emptying of Schopenhauer's aesthetic contem- plation. The presence in the work of art was ultimately the presence of one's own self, the animation of otherness with the viewer's ego. As the concept of empathy became more circumscribed within the bounds of perceptual psy- chology, the aspect of identity shifted from a pantheistic-ontological unity of mind and nature to an epistemological imperialism of the human personality responsible for overcoming all otherness, all difference with its powers of animation.17 The experience of enchantment was replaced by a scientific explanation of human feeling and perception. But the two strands of idealist thought under consideration here-ab- straction and empathy-were interwoven in Worringer's aptly titled Abstrac- tion and Empathy. Worringer's attempt at a "psychology of style" combined the nineteenth-century study of perception with a philosophical sensibility colored by Schopenhauer. Worringer contended that the use of abstract line in geometrical ornament offered comfort to primitive humanity because it excluded all traces of organic life-that is, the change, growth, and decline which made for an insecure and finite human existence.'8 Abstract form created in the space of aesthetic experience a dimension composed of neces- sity and absolute, immutable regularity, which provided a refuge from the "caprice" of the organic world (34-35). This yearning for the transcendent corresponded to an abstract artistic volition or Kunstwollen. Worringer con- trasted abstraction with empathy, which he defined after Lipps as the enjoy- ment of the self projected into an object or form. Worringer repressed or ignored empathy theorists such as Volkelt, whose thought exhibited an important debt to idealist metaphysics. Limiting Lipps's empathy to organic forms and identifying the "abstract Kunstwollen" as the impulse toward geometrical, inorganic, crystalline forms, Worringer claimed that these forms denied life because the viewer does not find in them the biomorphic design which conforms with the design of one's own body. 16 Ibid., 432-33. Lipps was indebted to Robert Vischer's phenomenology of feeling in Ueber das optische Formgefihl (Leipzig, 1873). Compare Vischer's statement with Lipps: "To trace the outline of a form is a self-movement, an act that is predominantly subjective: the form being no more than an arbitrary, willful, and unilateral means by which the body can enjoy itself" (Mallgrave and Ikonomou, Empathy, Form, and Space, 107). But Lipps moved beyond the idealist metaphysics which still informed Vischer's influential doctoral dissertation; Vischer's paper is translated in Empathy, Form, and Space, 89-123. 17 Cf. Lipps, Grundlegung der Aesthetik (2 vols.; Hamburg, 1903-5), I, 106: "Der 'Andere' ist die vorgestellte und je nach der ausseren Erscheinung und den wahmehmbaren Lebensausserungen modifizierte eigene Pers6nlichkeit, ein modifiziertes eigenes Ich. Der Mensch ausser mir, von dem ich ein Bewusstsein habe, ist eine Verdoppelung und zugleich eine Modifikation meiner selbst." 18 Worringer, Abstraction and Empathy, 19-21. 322 David Morgan</page><page sequence="7">Fig. 1: Franz Marc, "Small Blue Horses," 1911, oil on canvas, 61.5 x 101 cm. Reprinted by permission of the Staatsgalerie, Stuttgart.</page><page sequence="8">The influence of Worringer's dissertation on German expressionists, particularly the artists of the Blue Rider, is customarily regarded as consider- able. Many have even claimed for it the status of a manifesto.'9 While this is dubious at best, Karsten Harries's claim that the book "suggested that the situation of modem man demanded an abstract geometric art" seems an accurate estimation of the book's significance.20 Early in his book Worringer observed a parallel between "primitive" and modem humanity. Because the primitive stood "so lost and spiritually helpless amidst the things of the external world," he aspired to what Worringer characterized as the "thing in itself."21 Likewise, though from the intellectual perspective of Kant's criticial idealism, the modern indulges a "feeling for the 'thing in itself'" when he refuses to accept phenomena as absolute reality but instead sees in the visible world, as Worringer quoted Schopenhauer, "the work of Maya, brought forth by magic, a transitory and in itself unsubstantial semblance, comparable to the optical illusion" (18). The art of the modern world, Worringer suggested, shares the abstract Kunstwollen of the primitive. Yet the question remains just what abstract meant. In fact Worringer did not intend by abstract the non-objective painting which Kandinsky and others pursued only a few years later. In Abstraction and Empathy Worringer praised the ancient Egyptians as those who "carried through most intensively the abstract tendency in artistic volition" (42). Worringer regarded style as a synonym for abstraction, and he contrasted style with naturalism in the same manner that he opposed abstraction to empathy (26). The primary aim of abstraction was to transcend nature by denying space in representation, as Riegl had observed. Under the rubric of style Worringer included all artistic expression whether representational or not-Gothic architecture, primitive ornament, ancient relief sculpture-which was directed by this denial of space and use of inorganic forms. Style, like abstraction, meant anything anti-naturalistic, any art which did not function expressively through empa- thy. It seems clear, therefore, that Worringer's study was not a brief for non- representational art. As for Marc, the evidence is secure that he admired Worringer's general thesis. In an essay published in PAN in March of 1912 Marc singled out Abstraction and Empathy and Kandinsky's Concerning the Spiritual in Art for unique praise.22 In a group of aphorisms written early in 1915 Worringer's discussion of abstraction was probably in Marc's mind when he compared 19 Peter Selz, German Expressionist Painting (Berkeley, 1974), 8, calls Abstraction and Empathy "almost the official guide to expressionist aesthetics"; Ulrich Weisstein, "Expressionism: Style or 'Weltanschauung,'" Criticism, 9 (1967), 52, refers to it as the "aesthetic Bible of Expressionism." 20 Karsten Harries, The Meaning of Modern Art: A Philosophical Interpretation (Evanston, Ill., 1968), 69. 21 Worringer, Abstraction and Empathy, 18. 22 Franz Marc, Schriften, ed.

Furthermore, it is attractive to parallel Worringer's ideas of abstraction and empathy with the development in Marc's art and thought from an earlier affinity with empathy to a later preference for abstraction. Yet this relationship must be carefully modified for Marc's conception of empathy was not restricted to Worringer's or to Lipps's. In the work he produced in 1911 before the influence of cubist and futurist art (which he would shortly see in Berlin and in organizing the Blue Rider exhibition) Marc celebrated animal life in the landscape in a way that recalls the monistic-pantheistic version of empathy theorized by Volkelt. Work such as Small Blue Horses (fig. 1) organizes animal and landscape into rhythmic configurations whose curvaceous, rolling forms merge, fusing figure and ground, and then dissolve the unity into gaseous swirls. This pulse of formation and dissolution characterizes Marc's pictures of animal life at this time, which, he wrote in 1910, were informed by "a feeling for the organic rhythm of all things, a pantheistic feeling of oneself into the quivering and flowing blood of nature, in the trees, in the animals, in the air" (Marc 98). In a matter of one or two years Marc went from yearning to feel the life in nature to creating images that violently dismantled the animal and its happy existence in the landscape. By 1912-13 he understood the artist's task to be to escape from all forms of anthropomorphic appropriation of the animal's autonomous being. "We must unlearn from now on to relate animals and plants to ourselves and to portray in art our relation to them" (113, emphasis added). Instead-and here Worringer's notion of primitive mankind's long- ing for the "thing in itself" comes to mind-the artist must strive to see things "as they really are," shorn of the categories of human knowledge (112). Marc became unable to accept empathy as a means of enchantment because he came to see it as only a projection of anthropomorphic interests. As with Worringer, Schopenhauer's quest for the transcendence of human reason in the aesthetic revelation of the Idea came to inspire him. Yet Marc was not of one mind on this as the war opened and the call to arms seized Germany. In the final stage of his abbreviated life (he died at Verdun in 1916) Marc vacillated between an essentialism taken to its logical extreme by scorning nature in abstract painting, on the one hand-and a patriotic empathy with the blood and soil of the fatherland represented in the animal and landscape subject matter of his art, on the other. Accordingly, Marc's oft-quoted statement in a letter of 1915 that his art became more and more abstract "out of an inner compulsion" as he came increasingly to recognize the "ugliness and impurity of nature," which is often interpreted as consistent with Worringer's view that the abstract artistic drive originated in an antipathetic attitude toward nature,23 must be balanced against his patriotic interpretation of Germany's military struggle with the Allies. 23 Franz Marc, Briefe aus dem Feld (Berlin, 1948), 64. 325</page><page sequence="10">The Rhetoric of Enchantment: Marc's Struggle for the Absolute The expressionist aesthetic was premised on the rejection of naturalistic representation because it implied the restriction of the artist to the "seen," what the young poet and critic Kasimir Edschmid called the "chain of facts," the positivist's building blocks of truth and reality.24 In an essay of 1912 Marc contrasted contemporary painting to the art of the nineteenth century which, he wrote, was "carried to the grave in a small coffin: the camera" (Marc 105). Marc asserted that the new art "takes the opposite direction than all earlier movements, where volition and ability strove for ever greater accord with the external image of nature, which banished with its bright light of day the secret and abstract conceptions of the inner life" (105). The "bright light of day" was an obvious reference to impressionism, the artistic style which avant-garde voices in Marc's day identified as the culmination of nineteenth-century naturalism. Critics directed their polemics against impressionistic naturalism because it had come to dominate the marketplace and exhibition system. Marc and others made use of a militarist rhetoric of violent struggle to characterize their opposition to the old and their search for the new. In the 1912 essay on "The Constructive Ideas of the New Painting" Marc considered the rejection of extraneous or "foreign ele- ments" (Fremdkorper) from the picture to constitute "the Great Revolu- tion." He went on to maintain that the painter no longer depended on the image of nature but destroyed (vernichtet) it in order to disclose the "power- ful laws which rule behind beautiful appearances" (Marc 108). This use of military rhetoric, which is consistent with the pervasive militarization of the German middle class in the years leading up to World War I, should not be misconstrued as a flat expression of Marc's artistic intentions.25 Instead, the military trope adorns his pictures with a polemical character directed against naturalistic painting. The fact is that at the time he wrote this, Marc's painting was not at all-indeed, virtually never would be-non-objective. In 1912 he manifested the first tendencies toward the geometric abstractions of Parisian art. As a result, the impassioned military rhetoric of the passage depicts an inimical, embattled relationship between art and nature rather than the final vanquishing of either foe. Marc more frequently expressed this antagonism in another metaphor: the opposition of an inner and an outer side of objects, which he joined in an increasingly violent tension. The inner side was an aspect of reality governed by its own laws rather than those of the outer, phenomenal side of things. Marc developed this scheme in an essay entitled "The New Painting." In a 24 Kasimir Edschmid, "Expressionismus in der Dichtung," Die Neue Rundschau, 1 (1918), 364. 25 See Gerhard Ritter, The Sword and the Sceptor: The Problem of Militarism in Germany, tr. Heinz Norden (2 vols.; Coral Gables, Fla., 1988), II, 93-104. 326 David Morgan</page><page sequence="11">The Enchantment of Art familiar pattern of expressionist polemic, he contrasted modern painters to "impressionists and plein-air painters of the nineteenth century." Today we seek beneath the veil of appearances the hidden things in nature, which seem more important to us than the discoveries of the impressionists.... And, indeed, we seek and paint this inner, spiritual side of nature not out of whim or desire for something different, but because we see this side just as they "saw" violet shadows and aether over all things. (Marc 102) Two weeks later Marc published further meditations on the concept of the "inner side" and asserted that opposition to "naturalistic form" was the consequence of a deeper will that he claimed permeated the present genera- tion: the urge to investigate metaphysical laws (106). Art, Marc believed, had the ability to manifest the imperceptible, metaphysical essence of a thing, its "absolute" or "abstract" being, the "true form" that was left behind when appearances were completely removed (113). For Marc the task was to withdraw from art the prejudices of human perception by rejecting mimesis as an anthropomorphic mode of representation-in effect, to achieve a manner of empathy that transcended human feeling altogether in favor of the local feeling of another (nonhuman) being. He delineated this aim as the very definition of "abstract art" in an important group of notes written in the winter of 1912-13: What we understand by "abstract" art.... It is the attempt {and yearning to see and depict the world no longer with the human eye but} to bring the world itself to speaking.... Art is, will be, meta- physical; it can be today for the first time. Art will free itself from human purposes and human will. We no longer paint the forest or the horse as they please us or appear to us, but as they really are, as the forest or horse feels itself, its {abstract} absolute essence lives behind the phenomenon, which we only see....26 Marc wrote that things contain their own will and form and that they speak among themselves, and this led him to declare: "Why do we want to interrupt? We have nothing intelligent to say to them" (Marc 113). Objects become muter the more "we hold before them the optical mirror of their appearance." By using this metaphor of a language of nature, Marc stressed the autonomy of nature's underlying forms, its inherent integrity. The artist was not to impose art on nature, but to penetrate to the essence of things where nature speaks for itself. By emphasizing nature's own power of speech, Marc sought to circumscribe humanity's reliance on its own perceptual habits 26 Marc, Schriften, 112 (brackets enclose original text which Marc crossed out; emphasis in original). 327</page><page sequence="12">David Morgan Fig. 2: Franz Marc, "Deer in the Forest, II," 1914, oil on canvas, 129.5 x 100.5 cm.

Schopenhauer had characterized the problem of self-transcendence in optical terms. In the state of "pure, will-less knowing," he wrote, "[w]e are only that one eye of the world which looks out from all knowing creatures" (I, 198). It was in this state that knowledge became absolute, free of all relations, and therefore a disclosure of the platonic idea. According to Schopenhauer, this vision occurs when the "pure subject of knowing gazes through [the] struggle of nature" (I, 204), what he called the "permanent battlefield" of the world, the "unending conflict" of the will individuated in all phenomena (I, 265). Marc agreed: We depend no longer on the image of nature, but destroy it, in order to show the powerful laws which reign behind beautiful appearances. As Schopenhauer put it, today the world as will is more important than the world as representation. (Marc 108) Marc held in common with Schopenhauer a deep appreciation of the suffer- ing and turmoil that characterized existence as a whole. According to Schopenhauer, all things are manifestations of a universal will struggling to fulfill itself in the individual purposes directing each thing. Humans achieve momentary deliverance from this blind striving of the will in the blissful absorption of aesthetic contemplation. The degree to which Marc came to regard nature as a struggle is evident in his militant rhetoric of revolution, destruction, and the penetration beneath the surface of appearances to the hidden metaphysical interior. As his written reflections in 1912 and after indicate, Marc aspired to depict objects as non-materialistic, as transparent to underlying or inner dimensions hidden by conventional pictorial devices. He was seized by the presentiment that nature was much more than the opaque surfaces portrayed by naturalistic art. Abstraction was the pictorial means for getting at a hitherto imperceptible reality. Marc proceeded to visualize the penetration of the veil of appearances by an aggressive altercation between representational and non-representational forms. The linkage of these two aspects replaced the priority of the mimetic relationship of the image to visible phenomena but did so without pursuing a purely non-objective art. For Marc to have forsaken external reality entirely would have precluded the visual sensation of pen- etrating into the concealed interior of his subjects. It was just this enterprise of disclosure which was so important to him, as suggested by his repeated use of the term "durchschauend" or "looking-through" to describe his manner of viewing the world of objects.27 Nature was not completely surrendered or annihilated, but seen-through, visually infiltrated and, therefore, sustained as 27 See the letters of 24 December 1914 and 12 April 1915 (Marc, Briefe aus dem Feld, 41 and 65), and Marc, Schriften, 170; also 195, ?35, where Marc distinguished 329</page><page sequence="14">Fig. 3: Franz Marc, "Struggling Forms," 1914, oil on canvas, 91 x 131.5 cm.

The presence he sought was the absolute in the act of becoming present. The 1914 oil painting Deer in the Forest II (fig. 2) makes this eminently clear. In this work the organic vitality of Small Blue Horses (fig. 1) has given way to dissected, angular forms which somewhat unevenly compress the nebulous space of former years into a fractured geometry clinging to the picture surface. Marc achieved the revelatory clash of inner and outer aspects in such visual devices as the stark contrast of surface and depth; by merging the vertical line from the upper left with the left contour of the deer in the foreground; and by the repetition of this deer's orange hue in the ground, which can be read as either behind or above the deer. Likewise, the largest deer takes its blue color from what may be fractured intervals of sky above. Marc subverted but did not efface the descriptive function of line and color. Recognizable forms are framed within broken templates that both echo the forms and distill them into an abstract geometry. Contours disintegrate and reemerge within a restless grid that oscillates between opacity and transpar- ency. The contrast between the brilliantly colored animal family and the violence of the abstract scheme seems to suggest a transformative event. Marc meant to place the viewer before a nature become porous, a nature whose surfaces submit to a momentous transformation from within. What Marc intended for the viewer to behold in Deer in the Forest II and so many pictures like it at this time was an ontological revelation, a disclosure of what underlay reality. In a reversal of the Hegelian subordination of art to philoso- phy as the ultimate disclosure of Geist, Marc looked to art to reveal meta- physical laws which only philosophy had previously known (Marc 106). Despite the importance of representational form in this visual dialectic in Marc's late work, several writers have focused on a small number of canvases of 1914 which they believe are completely non-objective.28 The painting most often adduced as evidence of Marc's allegedly non-objective aim is Struggling Forms (fig. 3). But as even a cursory examination of this painting demonstrates, the attempt to portray Marc's final works as decisively non- representational is unfounded. The large red shape on the left suggests the form of a bird, perhaps an eagle, and the linear forms possess the character of lashing talons or tendrils reminiscent of futurist lines of force describing violent motion. It may be that the combat between mimetic and abstract forms tips in favor of the latter in Struggling Forms; but when viewed in the Weltanschauung from Weltdurchschauung, regarding the latter as symptomatic of the new art which did not seek form "im Aussen, in der stilisierten Facade der Natur" but constructed "von innen heraus." 28 John Moffitt, "Fighting Forms: The Fate of the Animals: The Occultist Origins of Franz Marc's 'Farbentheorie,' " Artibus et Historiae, 12 (1985), 122, repr. in Kathleen J.

Indeed, the struggle we witness may be the very struggle of the artist to gaze, as it were, upon the reality that he believed was concealed beneath the "stylized facade of nature" (Marc 195, ?35). No appearance, no form of idealized imitation could express the absolute for Marc as it could for Schiller and Schopenhauer. Schein as abstracted from phenomena was still an imposition of the human will according to Marc, still an aesthetic based on mimesis. To Marc the work of art was not an elevation above or purification of nature, not a realm of free play of the imagination, as Schiller characterized it, but a site of violent revelation, a destruction of appearances, whether phenomenal or idealized. In an article of 1913 that he entitled "Toward a Critique of the Past" Marc collapsed all forms of apperception into the "mortal structure of our mind" and proceeded to describe the nature and function of art: The yearning for immutable being, for liberation from the sensory deceptions of our ephemeral life is the fundamental disposition of all art. Its great aim is to dissolve the entire system of our incomplete sensations, to manifest an unearthly being that lives behind every- thing, to break the mirror of life [in order] that we gaze into being. (Marc 169) To break the mirror meant to transcend the mediated relation with nature that representational art offered, to surpass the structures of appearance con- structed by apperception. Marc strove to envision this revelation in art, to show the break-through as an antagonistic engagement of abstract and figura- tive forms: phenomena giving way to a higher ontology. This epiphany swept away all forms of mimesis by suggesting the imminence of pure being. The artist could not represent this in itself but could allude to or anticipate it by envisioning the destruction of the present order as the birth of something new. The Ideology of Enchantment As we have seen, because he regarded empathy as anthropomorphic, Marc sought to move beyond it as an inadequate form of enchantment: since it offered only a projection of human categories, empathy could not reveal the hidden face of reality. He may have been encouraged in his rejection of empathy by Nietzsche's critique of anthropomorphism. In a pessimistic vein struck by Schopenhauer and treated by the neo-Kantian historian of philoso- phy, F. A. Lange, Nietzsche had argued that all human knowledge was a result of anthropomorphic projection: The sublimity of nature, all those impressions of grandeur, nobility, grace, beauty, goodness, austerity, power, and rapture that we record 332 David Morgan</page><page sequence="17">The Enchantment of Art in the experience of nature, history, and mankind are not immediate feelings, but the aftermath of innumerable, deep-rooted errors-ev- erything would appear cold and lifeless to us were it not for this long schooling.29 On another occasion Nietzsche insisted that, "apart from our condition of living in it, the world that we have not reduced to our being, our logic and our psychological prejudgments, does not exist as a world 'in itself.' '30 Yet Marc must have drawn greater support from Schopenhauer's meta- physics of the will than from Nietzsche's post-Wagnerian demythologizing of romantic metaphysics. The former offered an escape from anthropomor- phic delusion while Nietzsche, in the words of one scholar, came to the conclusion that "thought cannot transcend the human standpoint or escape its anthropomorphic perspective."31 The Birth of Tragedy (1872) extolled the Dionysian aesthetic experience of ecstatic mingling with the "mysterious primordial unity" of the will behind the torment of phenomenal existence;32 but by 1878 Nietzsche repudiated his earlier infatuation or enchantment with Wagner and Schopenhauer by arguing that the thing in itself, the will, was an "all too human" projection. Rather than renounce the individual will in himself and merge with this metaphysical reality through art, Nietzsche affirmed this world. He satirized the Schopenhauerian-Wagnerian religion of art with its prophetic seer-artist: The belief in great, superior, fertile minds is not necessarily, yet very often connected to the religious or half-religious superstition that those minds are of superhuman origin and possess certain miraculous capabilities.... They are credited with a direct view into the essence of the world, as through a hole in the cloak of appearance, and thought able, without the toil or rigor of science, thanks to this miraculous seer's glance, to communicate something ultimate and decisive about man and the world.33 29 Quoted in George J. Stack, Lange and Nietzsche (New York, 1983), 125. 30 Ibid., 131. 31 George J. Stack, "Nietzsche and Anthropomorphism," Critica: Revista Hispano- americana de Filosofia, 12 (1980), 48. Julian Young argues persuasively that Nietzsche's middle period (Human, All Too Human, 1878; The Gay Science, 1882-87) rejected the previous interest in Schopenhauer but that by 1888, with the Twilight of the Idols, he returned to Schopenhauer's view of art in important respects (Nietzsche's Philosophy of Art). Thus, opposing Schopenhauer and Nietzsche in any strict sense may miss Marc's debt to both authors. Depending on what he read by Nietzsche, Marc could have found Schopenhauer and Nietzsche in accord with one another. Moreover, Nietzsche remained at least somewhat ambivalent about the enchantment of music in Human, All Too Human (see ?153). 32 Nietzsche, The Birth of Tragedy or Hellenism or Pessimism, tr. Wm. A. Haussmann (New York, 1964), 27. 33 Nietzsche, Human, All Too Human, 112-13 (?164). 333</page><page sequence="18">Nietzsche developed a critique of enchantment which contrasts with the metaphysical aim which Marc assigned art. Nietzsche proposed a perspec- tivalism that embraced anthropomorphism as the necessary condition of human knowledge. "Relativity" was inescapable. The "world" was un- avoidably a valuation from the perspective of "the preservation and en- hancement of the power of a certain species of animal."34 In notes written at the front in 1915 Marc explicitly rejected such "Relativitat" as "a thoroughly secondary thought and as philosophy a false doctrine which only exhausted minds could invent in order to give the appearance of wit to their failure of judgment" (Marc 185, ? 1). In contrast to Nietzsche, Marc insisted on the dualism of essence and appearance and charged the artist with the task of penetrating to the "essence of the world," what he regarded as the purpose of abstraction, affirming that "[e]ach thing in the world has its form, its formula, which we cannot touch with our coarse hands, but which we can embrace intuitively in the degree that we are artistically gifted" (Marc 113; 185, ?1). Schopenhauer's philosophy pro- vided a special place for art as revelatory and redemptive. For this reason Marc relied on Schopenhauer's construction of a dualistic contrast between the surface of appearances and the will as the metaphysical basis for artistic experience as a disclosure of the transcendent. For Marc this power was nothing less than soteriological. In a group of notes from 1912-13 he pro- claimed that "Faith in art is wanting, we wish to raise it up," and, complain- ing of the adulteration of the concept of art, concluded that "only a single way out remains: return the word art to its purity and lead the people back to God instead of the golden calf" (Marc 113, 114). Two years later, in the midst of the war, he announced that "The coming art ... is our religion, our center of gravity, our truth" (Marc 196, ?35). If Nietzsche sought to dis- mantle the religion of art, Marc yearned to reinvigorate it. In spite of his vigorous rejection of animals and nature as ugly, Marc could also write during the war years with a nostalgia that revived in him a romantic ethos of empathy. In a letter of 1915 to his wife Marc described gardens that reminded him of his own in Bavaria, and confessed: "More than ever I am still in love with flowers and leaves. When I look at them some feeling of compassion is always present, a kind of secret understanding."35 he embraced abstraction and empathy alternately because each in its own way could reveal for him the deeper laws that governed appearances. With the arrival of World War I and the emergence of the German nation as an eschatological force in creating a new European order, Marc had turned with even greater rigor to empathy as a patriotic enchantment. Not only did 34 Friedrich Nietzsche, The Will to Power, ed. Walter Kaufmann, tr. Kaufmann and R. J. Hollingdale (New York, 1967), 305, ?567. 35 Marc, Briefe aus dem Feld, 66. letter of 13 April 1915: "Ich bin noch mehr als je in die Blumen und Blatter verliebt. Ich seh sie jetzt so anders an, irgend ein Gefuhl von Mitleid ist immer dabei, eine Art Mitwissertum...." 334 David Morgan</page><page sequence="19">The Enchantment of Art empathy identify him with the elusive reality of the German nation unveiling itself in the war as the future of Europe, the aesthetic of empathy allowed him to express a mystical identity with Germany in conscious contrast to France and its culture. Two weeks before joining the army in the summer of 1914, Marc revealed in a letter to the painter August Macke a fervent patriotism which dismissed Parisian avant-garde painting. Suddenly the old romantic meta- phors of blood and soil and the familiar contrast of Roman and Teuton serve as the foundation of his art. In the pressing context of German mobilization for the imminent war, we encounter the traditional rhetoric of German nationalism extending from Vater Jahn to Julius Langbehn: I am a German and can only plow my own field. What do I care about the painting of the Orphists? As beautiful as the French are, we say: Romans we cannot be. We Germans are and remain born graphic artists, illustrators as well as painters. (Worringer says this very nicely in his introduction to "Old German Book Illustration.") You know how I love the French, but I cannot make myself into a Frenchman. I dig [schiirfen] into myself, only into myself, and seek what lives within me, to represent the rhythm of my blood....36 On the eve of the war, convinced of the unprovoked aggression against the fatherland, Marc, like millions of Germans, prepared for the conflict by seeking to ground his art within himself and his national identity. In this light we do well to consider an alternative reading of Struggling Forms (fig. 3), which was completed only shortly before the outbreak of conflict in a summer dominated by rumors of war. An emphasis on abstraction as disinte- gration sees the painting as visualizing the destruction of mimesis; but the suggestive forms, one of which appears to be an eagle, invite, under the auspices of empathy, a reading which puts the imagery to political use: as a totem of imperial Germany, the eagle engages an enemy in battle for its existence. Rather than passing out of existence, the eagle invites the viewer's empathic conjuring of a narrative in which the German mascot fights for dominance.37 Yet it was abstraction that remained the primary strategy for enchantment for Marc until his death. The enchantment of abstraction consisted of a spell cast by the new art of dissolving nature's appearances in search of a novel 36 Letter to Macke, 12 July 1914, Briefiechsel (Cologne, 1964), 184. For further discussion, see Pese, Franz Marc: Leben und Werk (Stuttgart, 1989), 129. Already in 1910, in Form Problems of the Gothic (New York, 1922), 416, Worringer had argued that the Germans were the "conditio sine qua non of the Gothic." 37 On the political significance of the eagle for Marc see Peter Klaus Schuster, "In Search of Paradise Lost: Runge-Marc-Beuys," Keith Hartley, Henry Meyric Hughes, Peter-Klaus Schuster, and William Vaughan (eds.), The Romantic Spirit in German Art 1790-1990 (London, 1994), 74. 335</page><page sequence="20">order of being. Abstraction represented a new dispensation which Marc's late writings demonstrate the war helped to usher in. The ideological function of abstraction amounted to its magical ability to bring about a spiritual regen- eration of Europe under a German aegis. What remains is to show the mechanics of this enchantment. Marc and the Problem of Modernity The ideological significance of abstraction for Marc was framed within his understanding of moder cultural history in Europe. Marc premised his artistic efforts on a repudiation of nineteenth-century art and technological developments and on an abiding, characteristically Germanic suspicion of modernity. In effect, what he sought to exclude through abstraction was a mechanized, industrialized modernity and its foundations in the applied sciences and an economy geared to proliferate the moder urban world. This is made clear in a number of Marc's writings in the last two years of his life. For instance, in the midst of the catastrophic upheaval viewed first- hand from the trenches of the First World War, Marc defined "das Abstrakte" as "natural sight, as primary, intuitive vision." He contrasted this to "das Sentimentale": the "hysterical sickness and reduction of our spiritual capacity to see," which he explicitly linked to a "deeply ill France" and proclaimed was the sensibility that the war came to purge from the moder world.38 "Our European will to abstract form," he wrote feverishly, "is indeed nothing other than our highly conscious, energetic retaliation and conquering of the sentimental spirit."39 This recalls Friedrich Schiller's distinction between the naive and sentimental in poetry, where the naive denoted simplicity, closeness to nature, and directness of expression and the sentimental exhibited greater conceptuality, artificiality, and a longing for nature from which it was estranged.40 Such an allusion in regard to abstract art suggests that what Marc sought was a purified vision, a way of seeing restored to "primitive" simplicity and directness. The appearances which he sought to strip away were the artistic and social conventions which concealed a spiritual view of nature whose features he could only anticipate in his paintings. He grafted to Schiller's romantic primitivism the colonial dis- course of German expressionism, which associated purity with the tribal cultures of Germany's colonies. In contrast to moder society, "early man" 38 Marc, Schriften, 210 (?89); see also ?6 and ?86 on the question of the purification and the war; and Briefe aus dem Feld, 60; on the sentimental sickness of France, 210, ?86. 39 Marc, Schriften, 210, ?87: "Unser europaischer Wille zur abstrakten Form ist ja nichts anderes als unsre hochst bewusste, thatenheisse Erwiderung und Ueberwindung des sentimentalen Geistes." 40 Friedrich Schiller, "Ueber Naive und sentimentalische Dichtung" (first published in Die Horen, 1795). Marc reversed Schiller's scheme, which had located the naive in the irretrievable past. 336 David Morgan</page><page sequence="21">The Enchantment of Art had still not encountered the sentimental illness because, as Marc insisted, "he loved the Abstract."4' Many concerns which occupied Marc and shaped his estimation of the significance of art can be found among those who sought to define a spiritual and cultural agenda for Germany on the basis of the mythical idea of the Volk. This ideology has been carefully studied in a classic work by George Mosse, who has identified several themes among proponents of the Germanic Volk that were also present in Marc's art and writings: an emphasis on intuition, instinct, and feeling over reason; a suspicion of technology and moder industry; a mystical, pantheistic experience of the German landscape; a rejection of moder urban life; and a substitution of cultural ideals for political and social praxis.42 It is of course important to point out that these similarities to Marc's thought should be balanced against several significant dissimilarities: Marc shared nothing of the antisemitism or the ardent nation- alism of the volkish ideology; he spoke enthusiastically of the importance of non-German artists at a time when it was not popular to do so; and he exhibited an enduring ambivalence toward the aesthetic of empathy that formed the basis of the volkish, patriotic, neo-romantic experience of the landscape.43 Marc was not a rabid nationalist, but a patriot who came to equate Europe's future with what he believed was the manifest destiny of Germany. In the fall of 1914 Marc wrote a brief essay in which he took care to distinguish himself from the "narrowness of heart and of national desire" and sought to redirect the "German cultural spirit and national impulse" toward a broader European scope. Yet he did not hesitate to assert that Germany would be, as France had formerly been, the "heart of Europe." On the role of the war in accomplishing this Marc differed from his friend and colleague, Wassily Kandinsky, who left Germany appalled at the violent prospect of war.44 But Marc had no misgivings: "Germanness," he pro- 41 Marc, Schriften, 210, ?87.

If there was a single theme which charac- terized the optimism behind the positivist conception of science and the technocratic hopes for moder technology in the industrial state in the nineteenth century, it was the fundamental belief in progress. This grew out of the ideology of the enlightenment with such thinkers as Saint-Simon who communicated a belief in progress to his pupil, Auguste Comte, through whom it attained a permanent place in the presuppositions of positivism.48 The operative premise was that nature could be controlled by science and technology to provide a secure environment for human development. Noth- ing could be more disenchanting: symbolic influence over the universe was replaced by physical, technological control. Romantics early in the century and neo-Romantics at the end resented this view because to them it tended to reduce the experience of nature to a materialist framework shorn of the beloved sublimity, mystery, and divine presence, in short, the power of enchantment. Furthermore, the new industrialism with its techniques of mass production made the tradition of Handwerk or craftsmanship obsolete and thereby threatened to leave behind the customs and folkways inherited from the past and transmitted in the arts and crafts. The rural, nationalist sensibility was imperiled by an urban, pragmatic, and cosmopolitan understanding of moder society. Marc polemically described "progress" as a moder "system of reli- gion" with its own prophets, priests, and laity (Marc 122). This new religion replaced the "inner, inherited, and organic abilities of people with external, learned, mechanical abilities." The gullibility of "the people" for this religion disturbed Marc but not as much as the agents of technological transformation of whom he spoke in the impersonal "they" as he lamented the insidious effects of modern technology and its machines: 45 Marc, "Im Fegfeuer des Krieges," in Schriften, 161: "Das Deutschtum wird nach diesem Kriege iiber alle Grenzen schwillen." 46 See Stephanie Barron, "Degenerate Art": The Fate of the Avant-Garde in Nazi Germany (Los Angeles, 1991), 295. 47 Lloyd, German Expressionism, 110. 48 Donald D.

But in reality, to make them bodily dependent {and wretched}. They invent the telephone, the high- speed press, and the like for the people in order to impair their independent thinking. They build machines so that people might forget their wonderful abilities in the arts and crafts and become sufficiently crude and stupid for the religion of progress.49 On another occasion Marc proclaimed that the "genuine art" of his day was incompatible with "our scientific and technical age" (Marc 111). He went on to prophesy that the "time will come very soon when we will find all of our technology and science immeasurably boring; we will altogether abandon it, even forget it; we will have no time for it because we will deal in spiritual goods" (ibid.). Marc's aim to revive "faith in art" to lead the people away from the false god of the mass cult of progress lead him to announce a prophetic warning: the grand "achievements" of science and technology were a "dangerous, bloody toy" in the hands of the people and may very well lead to a violent end (Marc 123). Marc's art stands in contrast to the mechanized world which his ongoing jeremiad bemoaned. In the place of industrialized urban society he focused on the animal and its place in nature. Even after Marc began dismantling the empathy between viewer and image, nature remained the locus of epiphany, the violent epicenter of metaphysical truth on which humanity depended for its spiritual welfare. The revelation of metaphysical truths by the new art of abstraction prophesied a transformation in European culture. During the war Marc wrote passionately of what he called the "high type," the "few" who were being "steeled" through the sacrifice of the war to carry on the struggle against the bonds of the past (Marc 169). Marc took the trouble to point out that he was not referring to politicians or their efforts or to the masses, but to the "good European" whom he hoped would emerge from the war ready to assume the task of ushering in a new age. The thought is indebted to Nietzsche's concept of the Uebermensch. "Now is the hour," Marc wrote, "in which all values will be measured anew ..."-transvalued (umwertet), Nietzsche would have said. During the war Marc became an avid reader of Nietzsche whose theme of destruction developed Marc's antebellum reflections on struggle into a full blown apocalyptic purge that promised a new age rising from the ashes of the war.50 For millennia, we read, humanity has longed to overcome nature, to peer behind the world, to see the back of divinity. The new European would be poised to do just that. The war for Marc was a watershed that left the Europe of the past steeped in absurdity. 49 Marc, Schriften, 122-23 (brackets enclose original text which Marc crossed out). 50 Ibid., 170, 66.

Let us go forth, onward, without looking back.... The great war has refreshed and freed us.51 The war was a spiritual, cultural conflict in Marc's view, one waged in paint and ideas as well as cannon and mortar shells. Indeed, this struggle was not preeminently a political or social reality for Marc, but a metaphysical one. Mosse has discussed the ways in which, since early in the nineteenth century, volkish thought in Germany tended to detach itself from real events in the political arena in order to address what it felt was the superior reality of the spiritual crisis of the German Volk. Marc followed this pattern, although he never exhibited extreme German nationalism. He had read Nietzsche too attentively for that and, like the cosmopolitan philosopher, looked for a supranational European elite to command affairs.52 Yet Marc was a proud German who fully anticipated a just victory for his nation. And the "high type" he awaited was going to be German. "The coming type of European," he wrote from the front in 1915, "will be the German type," although he was careful to add that this would not occur before the German had become "a good European" (Marc 161). Marc's characterization of the relationship between art and nature in a rhetoric of antagonistic struggle could easily be mystified by modernist historiography as a noble struggle of the avant-gardist against a backward establishment.53 However, this would overlook the fact that he forged his rhetoric in a period of unprecedented German militarization. In fact his ideology was able to mask German militarism. Rather than address the political issues of Germany's foreign policy and historic preparation for war, Marc mythologized the conflict into a search for European rebirth under the star of German leadership. In November of 1914 he wrote the following: Politics stand in a very loose and secondary relationship to the meaning and course of world history, always merely the mask and not the spirit, administration not imagination.... No and a thousand times no, we Germans are not fighting for a place in the sun.... The war concerns more [than that]. Europe ails from a deep-rooted weak- 51 Marc, Schriften, 173.

(Marc 163) Such was the cultural rather than formally political strategy for European renewal. This was the way of enchantment, the magic of a cultural tradition of yearning, an artistic incantation which summoned into being a longed-for state that politics and economics could not finally be trusted to achieve. As Schiller had argued, the aesthetic state must be attained before the political one could become a reality. But Marc found himself in the midst of unprec- edented conflagration and no doubt expected the new art and the new Europe would share a violent birth. He admired the Nietzschean will to power as a dire expression of the need for radical cultural transformation, as a purgato- rial fire to cleanse Europe. But after the war, Marc was convinced, the will to power would take a constructive turn and become the "will to form" in order to build a new order to replace the destruction of the old one (Marc 193, ?26). The form which would emerge among artists, which was even then taking shape in early experiments in abstraction would, according to Marc, visualize the truth of things rather than their surfaces. Marc charted a path between the two philosophers whom he admired by transforming Nietzsche's will to power and by dismissing Schopenhauer's pessimism. The "good European" would create a vision of the absolute that was not anthropomorphic pace Nietzsche and that offered a viable alternative to the void into which Schopenhauer saw all things pass (Marc 197, ??40, 41). As a cultural strategy of enchantment, abstraction consisted of destroying a bankrupt materialist worldview just as the war would purge society of its decadence. By violently perforating the outer shell of phenomena, abstract painting promised to unveil the absolute. What Marc fashioned in his abstract art was a practice of image-making that preserved the Germanic notion that the fatherland's problems were spiritual in character, that nature remained the site of revelation and national identity, and that a cultural rebirth, the complete epiphany of a new age, summoned by the new art, would follow the purgatory of the war. Gripped by the need to glimpse what was invisible, to embrace what was transcendent, the artist-shaman cast a spell that bewitched whoever shared his urgency. Abstraction and empathy were powerful means of imaging a transcendence to venerate and pointing toward an invisible reality to behold. Each performed the cultural work of evocation, an ideologi- cal operation that attempted to transfigure the world through the work of art. Such was the aim of the spiritual in art as a form of cultural enchantment. Valparaiso University. 341</page></plain_text>
