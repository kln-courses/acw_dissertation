CLARK'- Much ink has been spilt in consideration of the once pervasive reliance on military metaphors to depict the relationships between science and religion in the nineteenth century. This has resulted in historically sensitive treatments of secularization; and the realization that the relationship between science and religion was not a bloody war between intellectual nation states, but a protracted divorce of former partners. Moreover, historians of science have been encouraged to throw off the yoke of the inter- nalism-externalism debate, and to explore the cultural boundaries that impinged upon practitioners of a natural knowledge of the world.1 Within the historiography of nineteenth-century science, this has resulted in many new perspectives on science and natural knowledge in relation to cultural control and authority. Nevertheless, the historiography of nineteenth-century science often becomes chrono- logically bifurcated. Whereas the early nineteenth century is seen as rife with sectarian disputes that were fuelled by fears of revolution, the defining feature of the latter half of the century is taken to be the rise of scientific naturalism. Furthermore, the latter, secular, ideology is usually linked to professional and disciplinary closure. As the laboratory replaced the museum as the dominant site of knowledge production, science itself is said to have experienced a divorce from general culture. A new expert elite arose as public mediator of natural knowledge. Although I do not wish rigorously to contest this scheme, I seek in this paper to provide some nuances. I wish to place professionalism and scientific naturalism within a liberal, centre-right, 'generalist', intellectual culture. John Lubbock (Figure 1) and entomology are excellent vehicles for this task because both are perceived as bastions of 'amateurism' at a time when professionalism was in the ascendant. Although he never practised science as a vocation, Lubbock (1834-1913) employed scientific naturalism and a 'professional ideal' to fulfil his educative role as a member of an intellectual aristocracy. In retrospect, his programme is relatively transparent because he chose to infuse 'disinterested' experimentalism into a science dominated by collection - School of History, University of Kent at Canterbury, Canterbury CT2 7NX.

In addition, he demonstrated the authority inherent in a purportedly obj'ective and apolitical science by concentrating upon a subject that carried considerable social and political freight - the social insects. He promoted a professional ideal of a science of progress, not to effect a specialist, disciplinary closure, but to buttress the cultural authority of a 'generalist', whig-liberal, intellectual aristocracy. For Lubbock, ants could lead the progressive march towards the 'moral regeneration of mankind'. A word or two about Lubbock's career indicates the scope for re-evaluation in these terms. In an often-repeated, and perhaps apocryphal story, a young John Lubbock purportedly confided in his neighbour and mentor, Charles Darwin, that he aspired to become President of the Royal Society, Lord Mayor of London and Chancellor of the Exchequer. Darwin later reflected that Lubbock could have achieved any one of these heights had he been willing to forego pursuit of the other two.' The historical reality, of course, renders this an especially piquant tale. Lubbock became a vice-president of the Royal Society, Second Chairman of the recently constituted London County Council, and 2 Bernard Mallet, 'Political and economic', in The Life-Work of Lord Avebury (Sir John Lubbock) 1834-1913 (ed.

This paper is not, however, concerned with a 'Kiplingesque' tragedy of a 'first rate second rate man'. Nor is it an exercise in the posthumous reclamation of centre stage for a 'misunderstood' intellectual. But the apocryphal story resonates with historiographical difficulties and considerations that often confront scholars attempting any proper treatment of the lives and careers of polymaths. As a prominent supporting actor in a number of historical contexts, Lubbock repeatedly surfaces as an archetype of a multiplicity of social and intellectual groupings that often appear to be irreconcilable. In the case of Lubbock, a possible clue to clarity can be found in Proverbs: 'Go to the ant'.3 As an insect which shows a high degree of communal organization, the ant has enjoyed a long and varied history in literature. Often myrmecological accounts reveal as much about the observer as the observed. Lubbock's work on ants demonstrates that appeals to scientific objectivity were an integral part of the emergent scientific naturalists' attempts to establish their own cultural hegemony in late nineteenth-century Britain. Insignificant insects, which showed an amazing propensity for social organization, could be extremely effective demonstrations of the naturalization of human beings and their experiences. A naturalistic explanation of the mental capabilities of the minima of sentient beings could similarly represent a triumph for materialist science. More particularly, it would vindicate the intellectualist evolutionary belief in 'psychic unity' that underpinned Lubbock's anthropology, myrmecology and pedagogy. Upon the death of his father in 1865, John Lubbock succeeded to the baronetcy and head of Robarts, Lubbock &amp; Co. (established in 1772 as Sir William Lemon, Buller, Furley, Lubbock &amp; Co.), which was one of the three most prominent established private deposit banks in late nineteenth-century England. Three years of an upper-class education at Eton, a large country seat at High Elms in Kent, familial connections with members of the Court of Directors of the Bank of England, and the assumption of a strictly supervisory role at the family bank after 1882 readily earn Lubbock membership in Youssef Cassis's 'City aristocracy'. But Cassis's delineation of the social and economic integration of the London banking community into the ranks of aristocracy suggests continuity in general, and, therefore, partially misleads in the particular case of Lubbock.4 In apparent contrast, Noel Annan numbers the Lubbock family amongst the 'intellectual aristocracy', which he disentangles from a complex web of kinship ties and a network of intermarriages. Committed to meritocracy, the intellectual aristocracy opposed traditional aristocratic privilege. They were 'wedded to gradual reform of accepted institutions and able to move between the worlds of speculation and government'.5 Adopting Annan's category, George Stocking, Jr, places Lubbock among an intellectual aristocracy of evolutionary anthropologists, who used their expositions of socio-cultural evolution to reinforce a middle-class ideal of social mobility.

Clark personally exemplified this ideal by his rise from baronet to the title of Lord Avebury in 1900, and by his acquisition of a castle, Kingsgate, in Kent.6 Lubbock's dual membership in the 'City aristocracy' and the 'intellectual aristocracy' sounds a cautionary note to any strictly class-based interpretation. Moreover, in his increasingly complex lattice-work of vertical and horizontal structures, rivalries and antagonisms, Harold Perkin posits the 'professional ideal' as the antithesis of the 'capitalist ideal'. The former, he asserts, promoted 'trained expertise and selection by merit' as part of an attack on the concept of absolute property. As a stalwart member of the Liberty and Property Defence League, and founder of the Industrial Freedom League, Lubbock, we are told, represents the archetypal capitalist, committed to extreme laissez- faire, and opposed to the professional ideal.7 In sharp contrast, Frank Turner presents Lubbock and his fellow X Club members as the nucleus of scientific naturalism, a tool of scientific professionalizers, bent on wresting socio-cultural authority and leadership from the hands of the clergy.8 To understand Lubbock fully, we must perhaps see him as building on his father's Broughamite whig programme for science. J. P. Parry identifies Lubbock as a whig-liberal, committed to the defence of a reformed Established Church, and to the necessity of education to inculcate individual responsibility. According to A. B. Cooke and John Vincent, Lubbock was a 'moderate' who drifted into Liberal Unionism in mid-1886. Concerned primarily about the change in the franchise after the Third reform act, and about the spectre of working-class demagogues, such as Joseph Chamberlain, Lubbock entered this party through promoting proportional representation. As a 'moderate' or 'whig-liberal', he also used Darwinian science to inculcate correct ethical and social behaviour.9 Reflecting upon the state of the poor in his diary in 1853, he observed: there [sic] high wages do them no good, it all goes in drink so that their wives and families are as badly off as ever. There are fewer petty thefts but not fewer crimes. The delegates instil Chartism and infidelity, which are on the increase, into them. Education has not yet been able to counter this. Certainly there are thousands of Children yet, who go to no school.'0 6 George W. Stocking, Jr, Victorian Anthropology, New York, 1987, 150-6, 212-18, 253. Five years after the death of his first wife, Ellen, in 1879, John Lubbock married Alice Lane Fox Pitt, the daughter of the renowned evolutionary anthropologist, General A. H. L. F. Pitt Rivers. 7 See Perkin, op. cit. (4), 116-70, especially 145-54. In addition, see N.

After all, illiteracy spawned the criminal classes, who were civilization's savages.' To maintain social stability, a whig-liberal clerisy had to instruct the nation in good political behaviour. Lubbock was in an excellent position to effect such a programme. He was a member of the Senate, Vice-Chancellor, and, finally, parliamentary representative for the University of London. He served on three royal commissions concerned with educational issues, the most significant being the far-reaching and comprehensive Devonshire Commission on scientific instruction and the advancement of science. And as principal of the Working Men's College, and an active supporter of the University Extension movement, he spread his educational panacea to the labouring classes and to the provinces.13 In an age steeped in the rhetoric of morality and character, John Lubbock proclaimed that 'the true glory of a nation' consisted 'in the moral and intellectual pre-eminence of the people'.14 Unlike many of his contemporary scientific naturalists, Lubbock suffered no crisis of faith,15 and lived happily with an intellectual marriage of science and religion. While courting his second wife in the 1880s, he briefly deferred his proclamations of love, 'because it was good Friday'. 16 Less than a month later, he continued to woo Alice Lane Fox Pitt with a reading from the Origin of Species.'7 As an 'intellectualist' anthropologist, he believed that science provided correct naturalistic explanations in place of past attempts of superstition and dogmatic religion.'8 With heady confidence, he declared: The future happiness of our race, which poets hardly ventured to hope for, science boldly predicts. Utopia, which we have long looked upon as synonymous with an evident impossibility ... turns out on the contrary to be the necessary consequence of natural laws.19 11 The phrase is from J. S. Mill, On Liberty, 1859; repr. Harmondsworth, 1984, 114. Parry, op. cit.

Clark Committed to the belief that 'men of science, and not the clergy only, are ministers of religion', he associated with the broad church intelligentsia that defended a reformed Establishment.20 His closest friend was Balliol-educated Mountstuart Grant Duff (1829-1906). And he sent his eldest son to Balliol, where he made frequent visits to the College's master, Benjamin Jowett. Convinced that science exerted a purifying influence on religion, Lubbock used the tools of scientific naturalism to earn his place amongst the whig- liberal intellectual aristocracy. LUBBOCK AND THE SCIENTIFIC NATURALISTS From his open support for the evolutionary theories of the Origin of Species at the famous 1860 Oxford meeting of the British Association for the Advancement of Science (BAAS) to his parliamentary petition for the burial of Charles Darwin in Westminster Abbey, Lubbock was intimately associated with the circle of scientists who coalesced around their support for Darwinism.21 Within several decades of the appearance of the Origin, these scientific naturalists achieved broad acceptance of a naturalistic world-view. Very effectively organized, they were able to launch unified campaigns in favour of secularized science. Equally influential, they wielded biology as a publicist science. Lubbock was a key agent in the latter campaign. In both the parlour and the lecture hall, he introduced lay culture to the fruits of Darwinian experimental entomology. Lubbock, and the circle of Darwinian supporters with whom he associated, concerned themselves with an amalgam of science, politics and religious beliefs throughout the 1860s. In the early years of that decade, for instance, they took up the cause of the authors of Essays and Reviews and of John William Colenso, Bishop of Natal, who had been deposed for his 'heretical' arithmetical calculations of biblical food supplies and population figures in his Pentateuch and the Book of Joshua Critically Examined (1862-65). One year later they opposed the dissemination of the 'Declaration of students of the natural and physical sciences'. Instigated by a coterie of men with a loose affiliation to the Royal College of Chemistry, the 'Declaration' recommended the continuance of a theology of nature; and affirmed the contiguous truths of the book of nature and the book of Scripture, the antithesis of the creed of scientific naturalism.22 Opposed to such 'dogmatic theology', and committed to the cause of science, nine men - John Lubbock, Joseph Dalton Hooker, Thomas Henry Huxley, William Spottiswoode, John Tyndall, Edward Frankland, Thomas Archer Hirst, George Busk and Herbert Spencer - united to create an informal dining club in late 1864.23 Meeting the first 20 John Lubbock, The Pleasures of Life [Part I], 3rd edn, London, 1887, 161-2. 21 J.

Interestingly, Lubbock does not note the creation of the X Club in his diary, although he does mention his</page><page sequence="7">Making sense of John Lubbock 157 Thursday of every month between October and June, the X Club wielded unparalleled influence within the scientific world for almost thirty years. In combination, the members of the X Club 'conspired' to promote their ideal of unfettered scientific research. Committed to the creed of 'scientific naturalism', they believed that all phenomena in the material world could be reduced to naturalistic explanations; revelation had no explanatory role in the realm of scientific investigation. Dalton's atomic theory, the law of the conservation of energy, and evolution were their holy trinity.24 Lubbock's most significant contribution to the spread of scientific naturalism came through the X club. Throughout the 1860s, Edward Livingstone Youmans (1821-87) was a frequent guest. As Herbert Spencer's official agent in the USA, Youmans engaged in proselytizing the creed of evolutionary naturalism. With the backing of the X Club, he successfully proposed to the publisher Appleton a venture that would eventually encompass 120 titles in four languages in five European countries and the USA. Between 1871 and 1910, the 'familiar red covers' of the International Scientific Series represented one of the most successful efforts to meet the dual demand for specialized knowledge and general comprehensive textbooks. Lubbock's association with the X Club made him an obvious candidate as a contributor to the series. Huxley, Tyndall and Spencer constituted the series' advisory committee in London. At their initial meeting in 1871, they discussed Lubbock as an author; but in a negative context. They decided that E. B. Tylor (1832-1917) was 'greater than' him on the topic of 'primitive man'. When Lubbock finally contributed to the series a decade later, his subject was the social insects.25 Besides Ants, Bees, and Wasps (1882), Lubbock contributed three other volumes to the series: On the Senses, Instincts, and Intelligence of Animals with Special Reference to Insects (vol. 65, 1888 (6 editions)); A Contribution to our Knowledge of Seedlings (vol. 79, 1896 (1 edition)); and Buds and Stipules (vol. 86, 1899 (1 edition)). As the author of Pre-Historic Times (1865) and The Origin of Civilisation and the Primitive Condition of Man (1870), Lubbock was, in 1871, best known as an archaeologist and an anthropologist. This image of him persists. Unfortunately, because of the historiographical priorities of the Darwin industry, Lubbock's wider intellectual career has suffered a retrospective stasis. Peter Riviere therefore asserts that 'it is probably true to say that despite his numerous contributions to botany, entomology and biology ... it is for his archaeological and anthropological work that those who know him best remember him '.26 True as this statement may be, it casts serious doubt on just how well we know Lubbock. involvement in the purchase of the Reader with many of the same people.

F. M. Clark On his death in 1913, Nature recognized other biological texts - the Monograph of the Collembola and Thysanura (1873), On the Origin and Metamorphoses of Insects (1874), Flowers, Fruits and Leaves (1886), Ants, Bees and Wasps (1882) and On the Senses, Instincts, and Intelligence of Animals (1888) - as 'five of his most illuminating books '.27 In a career that spanned half a century, he contributed countless papers to learned societies and their journals; made frequent public lectures; and produced some twenty books. His collections of loosely didactic essays - The Pleasures of Life, part 1 (1887) and part 2 (1889), and The Use of Life (1894) - sold in excess of 500000 copies and were translated into forty languages. In 1891 alone, his books netted him a profit of ?750.28 Remembered as ' one of those gifted men who, without making any profound advances in science ... succeeded in making science acceptable and even welcome to the ordinary man', Lubbock successfully combined the roles of scientific naturalist and 'public moralist'.29 In 1881, Leisure Hour published a detailed biographical sketch that compared his work on social insects with his previous scientific contributions. The anonymous author stated that Lubbock's earlier work had been devoted to obscure specialist points in the morphology and physiology of crustacea and insects; and that his more recent research on ants and bees was 'much more popular '.30 The sheer success of Ants, Bees, and Wasps guaranteed its recognition as 'popular; and certainly by 1929 it had passed through eighteen editions. But the specialist/popular dichotomy carried a number of implicit meanings. Most significantly, it implied that Lubbock's hymenopteran studies were less rigorous and original than esoteric scientific literature. Arthur E. Shipley therefore characterized him as an unexceptional researcher, whose greatest contribution was his encouragement to others.31 And Nature described him as an unoriginal scientist, who was best remembered as the 'ordinary man's' interpreter of scientific knowledge.32 The use of accessible language and the absence of counter-intuitive concepts and holistic theories produced this perception of Ants, Bees, and Wasps. Furthermore, the book was a contribution to a nascent and amorphous specialty. Within the field of comparative psychology, however, Lubbock's work received recognition and respect from his contemporaries. George J. Romanes, the man whom Darwin chose to deal with mental evolution, based the clear majority of his Animal Intelligence (1882) on Lubbock's hymenopteran experiments. And C. Lloyd Morgan (1852-1936) - whose canon of 1894 is celebrated by triumphalist whig historians as the herald of modern psychology - felt that Lubbock's experimental methods and techniques were the way of the future for comparative psychology.33 27 'Lord Avebury, F.R.S.', Nature (1913), 91, 350-1, on 350. 28 Riviere, op. cit.

Homes to lumbricid worms, these pots and their inhabitants sustained a barrage of sensory phenomena from Charles Darwin and his family. At various times, the worms were exposed to red and blue light, and to a red hot poker. Darwin breathed gently on them when chewing tobacco, or while sucking cotton balls, which were saturated with perfume or acetic acid. He watched the worms attentively while the study reverberated from the bass notes of a bassoon, or shrieked to the shrill of a metal whistle, or echoed forte piano. Finally, with his head close to the pots, Darwin directed his loudest shouts at the captive worms.34 Less than a mile away, thirty to forty artificial ants' nests lay strategically scattered throughout High Elms. John Lubbock, his family and Miss Wendland, their governess, subjected these nests and their inhabitants to a barrage of sensory phenomena. The ants were left to arrange their pupae under an artificially induced spectrum of colours. Lubbock dipped camel's-hair brushes into essence of clove, peppermint and lavender water, and dangled them a quarter of an inch above the ants. He keenly observed the same insects' reactions to the assorted sounds of a dog-whistle, tuning forks, a violin and a shrill pipe. In a final volley from his sensory arsenal, he hovered over the ants - like a bee above flowers - and screamed and yelled at his tiny subjects.35 Both Darwin and Lubbock engaged in experimental research on the physiological psychology of minute organisms. Robert Richards and Richard Burkhardt have demonstrated how considerations of animal instincts, intelligence and habits were an integral part of the development and final formulation of Darwin's theory of evolution.36 Prior to reading Malthus, in fact, Darwin accorded instinct and habit a central role in his explanation of transmutation of species. In the Origin of Species, he devoted a single chapter to instincts to demonstrate that they were subject to gradual modification through natural selection; and that they were not evidence of a supernatural template implanted in animals as part of the beneficent design of the Creator. But in the Descent of Man, he tackled one of the central tenets of the opposition to evolution by natural selection, and its extension to man. A fundamental part of the 'eclipse' of Darwinian evolutionary theory was the contention that the mechanism of natural selection was incapable of explaining the Evolutionary Theories of Mind and Behavior, London and Chicago, 1989, 331-408; L.

F. M. Clark development of man's mental capabilities.37 Often willing to grant the existence of physical and anatomical homologies, critics argued that the human mind represented an unbridgeable chasm between man and animals. As analogues of humans and their behaviour, ants, bees and worms accentuated the evolutionary continuum between human and animal. In October 1854, John Lubbock delivered his first lecture on ants; and several years later he assisted Darwin in the determination of the morphological differences between worker castes of the same insects.38 But almost two decades passed before he took up the study of ants in earnest. Between 1874 and 1882 he published nine papers in the Journal of the Linnean Society and delivered two lectures at the Royal Institution. Drawn together into a single volume, these lectures and papers metamorphosed into Ants, Bees, and Wasps. Although ants constituted the majority of the book's subject matter, Lubbock's first interest had been bees. His reasons for initially taking up the study of bees, and subsequently shifting his emphasis to ants, explains much about his unique contribution to myrmecological literature. Unsurprisingly, perhaps, Lubbock's inspiration came from Darwin. In a presidential address of 1866 to the Entomological Society of London, Lubbock used Darwin's evidence for the co-evolution of flowers and insects as a springboard for his own speculations regarding the physiological psychology of bees. Taking his cue from the pollination biology of Darwin - and Conrad Sprengel - Lubbock pondered the bee's ability to perceive 'bright and conspicuous flowers': we obtain from these facts the best evidence that insects possess the faculty of perceiving and distinguishing colours. For as regards the vision, and indeed the other senses of insects, we have yet much to learn. We do not yet thoroughly understand how they see, smell, or hear; nor are entomologists entirely agreed as to the function or the structure of the antennae. This interesting subject offers a most promising field for study.39 He further speculated that insects possessed the power of reason, and were capable of feeling pain. More important, he employed ants and 'savages' to support his suppositions: Look, then, at the ants; they build houses, they keep domestic animals [aphids], and they make slaves; if we deny to them the possession of reason we might almost as well question it in the lower races of Man: insects cannot speak, indeed, but they evidently communicate by means of their antennae, just like certain North American Indians who cannot understand one another's language, but who can yet converse together with ease and fluency by a code of signs.40 In retrospect, this presidential address could easily serve as a prospectus for all his subsequent research on the social insects. Bees, of course, were not the only insects that acted as pollinators. But, as part of a flourishing apicultural tradition, they were semi-domesticated. They were therefore readily 37 Alvar Ellegird, Darwin and the General Reader: The Reception of Darwin's Theory of Evolution in the British Periodical Press, 1859-1872, 1958; repr.

As Lubbock discovered, the bees did not submissively succumb to the experimentalist's designs. In July 1873, he established a Marriot flat glass hive in his sitting-room 'so as to be able to observe them more continuously'. One month later, his abandoned hive required a new lot of bees. The following July, he replenished his observatory hive with yet another swarm of bees; and in November of the same year, he obtained a new queen and a Cheshire Frame Hive.41 Less than a month later, he began to build artificial ants' nests that were clearly fashioned after the glass hives. He later explained: I originally intended to make my experiment principally with bees, but soon found that ants were on the whole more suitable for my purpose. In the first place, ants are much less excitable, they are less liable to accidents, and from the absence of wings are more easy to keep under continuous observation.42 In contrast to the experience with bees, Lubbock maintained and manipulated ant colonies for considerable lengths of time. Writing for the Edinburgh Review in 1882, surgeon Robert James Mann (1817-86) reported: The chief difficulty in the case of the ant is that it works principally in the dark. The most important operations of its social life are carried on underground, or in nests enclosed within dense and opaque walls. This difficulty, however, Sir John evades by the employment of glass nests which he has himself devised.43 These nests consisted of 'two plates of common window glass, about ten inches square, and at a distance apart from 1/10 to 1/4 of an inch ... with slips of wood round the edges, the intermediate space being filled up with fine earth'.44 They were kept either in shallow boxes or on stands surrounded by trenches of water. In the latter case, six nests were placed horizontally, one above the other, upon a vertical rod, so that each could be turned out for observation (Figure 2). Although others before him - most notably Pierre Huber (1777-1840) - had employed bell jars and glass observation nests, Lubbock reduced the space between the glass plates so that the ants' activities would always be visible. Furthermore, by laying the frame flat, he rendered the upper plate mobile, so that it could be removed, replaced, or cleaned. He kept one colony of ants in the same glass nest from 1874 to 1890; and he shed new light on the longevity of ants by keeping a queen of Formica fusca for fifteen years.45 Moreover, his glass nests were transportable. In the autumn of 1875, he attempted to fill seventeen artificial ants' nests while on holiday in Italy. And between 29 June and 10 August 1880, he made regular visits to the Royal Institution with his ants to perform experiments using electric lights and spectra.46 His plan of construction 41 12 July 1873, 13 August 1873, 15 August 1873, 4 July 1874 and 10 November 1874, John Lubbock, Diary, 1872-1879, SAP, Add.

John Lubbock's ants made the transition from a semi-domesticated 'second nature' to a domesticated experimental regime.49 Darwin credited his cousin Francis Galton with producing experimental proofs of the variations and inheritance of human mental attributes.50 Through John Lubbock, Galton's influence spread to comparative psychology. Building upon his ethnological work, Galton began, in the 1860s, to chart the inheritance of mental qualities in man. Most significantly, he recognized psychological differences amongst individuals, and created apparatus to measure them. Initially committed to anthropometric investigations, he made static bodily measurements of his subjects. But by the mid-1870s, he deployed his own psychometric instruments as part of his experimental physiological psychology. Like Darwin, Lubbock, and most of his nineteenth-century British counterparts, Galton subscribed to association 47 See P. Huber, The Natural History of Ants (tr. J. R. Johnson), London, 1820, 12-13, 61-5, 310-28, for detailed descriptions of his 'glass apparatus'. Auguste Forel, The Social World of the Ants Compared with that of Man (tr. C. K. Ogden), 2 vols., London, 1928, i. 379-404, provides the best historical survey of myrmecological 'observation apparatus'.

Rooted in Lockean empiricist epistemology, it consisted of the belief that all ideas emanated from sensations of the external world, which were bound together in the mind through associations and memory. Consequently, Galton believed that an accurate assessment of an individual's sensory physiology constituted a measure of his or her intelligence.51 A frequent guest at the weekend gatherings at High Elms, Francis Galton was also a participant in Lubbock's experiments on ants and bees. Coming to the subject through the pollination biology of Sprengel and Darwin, Lubbock shared Galton's interest in sensory physiology, as he acknowledged in Ants, Bees, and Wasps: My object has been not so much to describe the usual habits of these insects as to test their mental condition and powers of sense.52 Moreover, as an arch-individualist, Lubbock found Galton's emphasis on the individual attractive. John Lubbock was the first naturalist to keep a 'careful record of individual ants' by placing dabs of paint on their backs.53 But Galton's influence was most conspicuous through Lubbock's use of his psychometric apparatus to determine the ants' powers of sensory discrimination. As part of a 'Special Loan Collection of Scientific Apparatus' exhibited at South Kensington in 1876, Galton devised a whistle for determining the upper limits of audible sound in different persons. He subsequently extended his investigations to animals, and made frequent visits to the Zoological Gardens, with his whistle attached to a hollow walking-stick.54 With Lubbock's help, he tested his whistle on insects in early 1878. In the company of weekend guests George J. Romanes and John Tyndall, Lubbock employed Galton's whistle - attached to a tube of compressed oxygen - on his ants. One week later, Galton himself assisted Lubbock in a repetition of this experiment. On both occasions, the ants appeared oblivious to the shrill sounds that were produced.55 Interestingly, Galton reported to Nature in 1883 that he had modified his whistle to meet the possible demands of insect hearing. Working from the premise that insects heard sounds inaudible to humans, he increased the pitch of his whistle by blowing hydrogen gas through it. Several months later he made a special visit to High Elms to try his 'hydrogen whistle' on Lubbock's ants. Once again they displayed no signs of hearing.56 In his Life, Letters and Labours of Francis Galton, Karl Pearson speculated that Galton probably never tested his hydrogen whistle on insects, because of the inherent difficulties of adapting a laboratory experiment to the exigencies of fieldwork. Most notably, the 51 See Richards, op. cit. (33), 169-72; Hearnshaw, op. cit.

Clark transportation of a tank of hydrogen gas posed a formidable impediment to chasing insects in the field.57 Understandably, Pearson did not consider the possibility of insects domesticated to a type of laboratory regime. Although he studiously combined parlour entertainment and experimentation, Lubbock emulated laboratory-based research in his work on ants, bees and wasps. Beginning in the 1870s, new physiology laboratories had sprung up to meet the latest demands for qualifying physicians. Prior to this, chemistry and physics had experienced considerable institutional or disciplinary success through laboratory-based work.58 Although apparently a gentleman amateur scientist, Lubbock supported the laboratory culture as part of his professional ideal. In 1883, he headed the committee formed at the International Fisheries Exhibition in favour of the establishment of a marine laboratory. And in 1897, Lubbock, Galton and five other men played a pivotal role in the creation of a psychology laboratory at University College London.59 This focus on laboratory culture, be it in a parlour or elsewhere, bears closer examination. Eschewing the depiction of the X Club as a group of scientific 'professionalizers', for example, Ruth Barton identifies the members as bound together by a common commitment to serious research. She characterizes Lubbock's approach to science, however, as less rigorous than his colleagues ', because he wrote 'diverting articles on ... the habits of ants'.6O Lubbock, in fact, explicitly distanced himself from the naturalists' tradition of recounting the habits of insects. In a light rebuke to antecedent and contemporary myrmecologists, he argued that 'it ought not to be necessary for us to rely on accidental observations; we ought to be able to test them by appropriate experiments." As early as 1856, T. H. Huxley acknowledged Lubbock's contributions to serious experimental research, when he informed him: 'It is not very often that I find any one who can or will work philosophically.'62 In the same year, Lubbock contributed an article, 'On the objects of a collection of insects' to the Entomologist's Annual. He disparaged the myopic bias that entomologists placed on 'collecting'. Insects in a collection, he stated, should be like books in a library; they must be studied to be of value. Entomologists paid too little attention to the habits, anatomy and physiology of insects. He warned that 'collecting for the sake of collecting' tended 'to narrow the mind'. Moreover, the pursuit of money was an illegitimate reason for studying entomology. 'Regular habits, temperance and industry' provided the true motivations.63 Earlier in the 57 Pearson, op. cit.

'Specialized expertise and human capital' displaced acquisition and blatant 'materialism'. Thus Ants, Bees, and Wasps was as much a narrative of the extensive labours of the specialist entomologist as it was a study of the sensory physiology of insects. Simple, but copious, lists and tables charted the times and incidents that constituted elaborate experiments. Lubbock adhered to Francis Galton's dictum that 'until the phenomena of any branch of knowledge have been subjected to measurement and number, it cannot assume the status and dignity of science'.66 To elevate the professional status of his entomology as a science, Lubbock faithfully quantified. 'A definite numerical statement', he said, 'always seems to me clearer and more satisfactory than a mere general assertion'. 67 Furthermore, unlike Kirby, Lubbock never engaged in economic, or applied, entomology. He and his fellow scientific naturalists believed that utilitarian applications would taint their moralistic quest for Truth. They were part of the ' anarchic or individualistic professions' that coalesced for 'intellectual and cultural rather than professional purposes'. They used the professional ideal to establish themselves as a scientific clerisy or an intellectual aristocraCy.68 Scientific naturalists took the physical sciences as their model for serious research. Huxley disparaged the very word 'Naturalist' because it includes a far lower order of men than chemist, physicist, or mathematician. You don't call a man a mathematician because he has spent his life in getting as far as quadratics; but every fool who can make bad species and worse genera is a 'Naturalist'!69 Sensory physiology was a propitious bridge between physics and the biological sciences. The first half of the nineteenth century was a productive period for work on the anatomy and phenomenology of sensation. By successfully distinguishing sensory and motor functions, Sir Charles Bell and Francois Magendie stimulated interest in the physiology of the nervous system. Because optics and acoustics were established research traditions within physics, they provided obvious avenues of research into the physics of sense- organs.70 Lubbock exploited this link with the physical sciences by drawing into his myrmecological investigations the expertise and apparatus of physicists.

Clark and 1878, William Spottiswoode and his assistant, Mr Ward, generated spectra for Lubbock, and provided him with access to electric lighting. Tyndall did the same under the auspices of the Royal Institution. In addition, he lent Lubbock a sensitive flame apparatus - to detect any ant sounds - on one of his weekend visits to High Elms. Similarly, after attending a weekend gathering at High Elms in late August 1878, Alexander Graham Bell returned the following week with 'a very sensitive microphone' for Lubbock's ant experiments. Finally, as a combination of parlour entertainment and the physics of sense- organs, Galton and Lubbock projected an image through the eye of an insect, for the viewing pleasure of Lady and Sir James F. Stephen, Charles Dilke and Mountstuart Grant Duff, in February 1879.71 An acknowledged 'popular' book, Ants, Bees, and Wasps also contained original and lasting contributions to the sensory physiology of insects. Using a rotating table devised by Francis Galton, Lubbock determined that ants followed scent trails, but that, in themselves, these trails provided no sense of direction. The latter attribute, he linked to the incident light and thereby laid the foundations for the elaboration of the 'sun compass' reaction. To test the colour vision of bees, he trained them to visit honey smeared on glass that was laid over different coloured cards. Called 'dressur', his method of 'training' became widely employed by the German school that was led by Karl von Frisch (1886-1982). And by observing where in the spectrum ants arranged their brood, he discerned that they were sensitive to ultraviolet rays. He did not concern himself with the contested distinctions between instinct and intelligence. His epistemology and related sensory experiments, and his Darwinian proclivities, convinced him that the ants' 'mental powers differ from those of men, not so much in kind as in degree'. In total, he partially achieved his goal of penetrating the different world that insects perceived.72 Moreover, he presented the results of his experiments in an accessible, secular language. At a time when scientific disciplines drifted towards professional closure, Lubbock believed that his contributions 'need not, because they are popular, be the less truly scientific'.7" To promote the ambitions of a whig-liberal clerisy, he popularized the scientific naturalists' professional ideal. His commitment to a mid-century ' generalist' intellectual culture meant that he did not equate professionalism with disciplinary fragmentation. 71 See, for instance, 12 September 1877, and 23 February 1879, John Lubbock, Diary, 1872-1879, SAP, Add.

The Lubbock nest never became a middle-class fad in late Victorian Britain. But through John Lubbock's informal and formal expositions and demonstrations, the ant, as domesticated nature, achieved immense notoriety. Informally, Lubbock effectively combined experimentation with parlour entertainment. Beginning in the 1860s, he provided weekend gatherings for prominent members of society circles and the educated classes at High Elms. Undoubtedly, a major drawing card was a Sunday visit to Charles Darwin, which Lubbock made a frequent feature. He truly was 'Darwin's Mercury', introducing the reclusive naturalist of Down to a veritable pantheon of Victorian celebrities. In early March 1877, for instance, he took his weekend guests - Huxley, Lyon Playfair, John Morley and William E. Gladstone- 'up to the hill-top', where 'the great statesman of liberalism met for the first time the great scientist of liberalism '.75 With thirty to forty glass nests established in his rooms at High Elms, Lubbock's ants were another feature of these weekend gatherings. His first artificial ants' nests were, in fact, constructed with the help of friend and visitor Anna Grant Duff in December 1874.76 Over a decade later, Mountstuart Grant Duff noted that the 'ants were duly visited' as part of the weekend entertainment at High Elms.77 Even in the absence of his nests, Lubbock's ants became a topic of interest in society rounds. In December 1881, Lubbock, on request, regaled the Duchess of Cleveland, Count Bismarck, the Bishop of Ely and other fellow guests at Woburn Abbey with talk of his ants.78 Lubbock was equally effective at reaching a broader popular audience. Although endowed with a weak voice, he drew large crowds to his lectures on ants. At the Dublin meeting of the BAAS in 1878, the audience was so large that the organizers arranged for Lubbock to take his lecture outside. Rain prevented this course of action, and 'hundreds' were turned away. Lubbock proudly recorded in his diary: 'My ants made quite a sensation.'79 In November 1881, he drew a crowd of six or seven hundred at the Bow and Bromley Institute; he lectured on ants to an audience of 2000 at the Victoria Theatre in November 1885; and, in spite of miserable weather, 1500 persons attended his address to the Wolverhampton Literary Society in January 1887.

Clark requested Lubbock to send copies of the papers and his book, Ants, Bees, and Wasps.80 The following year, Thomas Greenwood noted that 'naturalists owe him a debt of gratitude for probably more than any other writer having familiarized the public with interesting facts respecting ants'." Naturally, when the Working Women's College asked him to lecture in 1892, 'they chose the Ants as subject'.82 Like Darwin, Lubbock sought to combine common and scientific language.83 This was, after all, the mandate of the International Scientific Series. But Lubbock published literature on ants, bees and wasps in a variety of different contexts. Articles appeared in the Journal of the Linnean Society, the Fortnightly Review, the Contemporary Review, and the London Magazine. He devoted substantial portions of his collection of Scientific Lectures and of his reader for the Anglicans' National Society to his studies of the social Hymenoptera.84 Perhaps the most striking aspect of this apparent multiplicity of 'imagined audiences' was Lubbock's consistency of content, presentation and style. Shortly after submitting his Scientific Lectures to Macmillan's for publication, he requested the publisher to return briefly one of the chapters on ants, because he intended to use it, verbatim, for a lecture at the Athenaeum Club. He held no compunctions about delivering one of his avowedly 'popular' lectures before the 'metaphorical lodge of the intellectual freemasonry' of late Victorian Britain.85 Contemporaries such as John Ruskin questioned Lubbock's 'popular' educational programme. On 9 January 1886, Lubbock delivered an address 'On the Pleasure of Reading' to the Working Men's College. The highlight of this lecture was his recommended list of 'the best hundred books', which spawned a flurry of discussion and criticism in the contemporary press. Writing in the Pall Mall Gazette, Ruskin slashed his 'pen lightly through the needless - and blottesquely through the rubbish and poison of Sir John's list'. He then proceeded to question for whom and for what the books were intended: young people or old, sick or strong, innocent or worldly - to make the giddy sober, or the grave gay. Above all, they do not distinguish between books for the labourer and the schoolman; and the idea that any well-conducted mortal life could find leisure enough to read a hundred books would have kept me wholly silent on the matter.86 As if to illustrate Ruskin's criticism, Lubbock published his lecture to working men in the Contemporary Review, an organ of the new higher journalism. 80 29 November 1881, John Lubbock, Diary, 1879-1882, SAP, Add.

His popular science was not targeted at a lower- middle-class or labouring audience. He wrote his hymenopteran expositions in one 'voice' for a multiplicity of contexts. The commitment to the psychic unity of man, which underpinned his anthropology and comparative psychology, guided his educational approach. All persons were capable of becoming rational, civilized humans, in the image of the late-nineteenth-century British, educated, elite man. They just needed training in the values and knowledge of the intellectual aristocracy. His literature was not, therefore, a tool of social control, that was meant to produce cogs in the industrial machine. 'Now we advocate Education', he explained, 'not merely to make the man the better workman, but the workman the better man'.87 Lubbock used science to proselytize the professional ideal. Through his lectures and publications, he ensured that the ants' ubiquitous presence in nature was duly reflected in their successful colonization of the many strata of Victorian society. SOCIAL INSECTS AND THE SCIENCE OF SOCIETY As myrmecologists explicitly acknowledged, glass hives and artificial ants' nests were lilliputian islands. They offered the observer a transcendent and synchronic view of nature: a miniature world that could be endued with socio-cultural meanings. And in the late nineteenth century, a convergence of biology and social theory played a prominent role in British thought.88 The publication of the Origin of Species, of course, was the single greatest factor behind this convergence. Darwin's ambiguous 'multivocal' presentation of his theory made it prey to reappropriation by a broad spectrum of socio-political groupings and persons.89 Often characterized as an ideological buttress to atomistic individualism, unfettered competition and economic freedom, 'social Darwinism' has undergone a significant historical revision over the last several decades. Much of this revisionism has focused on the rise of 'reform Darwinism' in the 1880s. With the appearance of New Liberalism in Britain and Progressivism in the USA, reform Darwinism displaced conservative social Darwinism. As social reform theorists looked to greater state 87 John Lubbock, The Use of Life, London, 1894, 97, quoted in Kuklick, op. cit.

Clark intervention to address endemic social problems - poverty, disease, unemployment - they adopted a co-operative, altruistic version of Darwinism. Co-operation, or 'mutual aid', replaced the 'struggle for existence' or the 'survival of the fittest' as the engine of social evolution or developmentalism. In the wake of the Origin of Species, biology carried unparalleled intellectual authority. Social theorists, therefore, amassed evidence from nature to support their arguments. The axis of political polemic spun on the antipoles of individualism and collectivism.90 Committed to addressing the nature of social relationships, collectivists most often resorted to nature's social animals for evidence. Revolutionist J. Addison proudly proclaimed the existence of a collective form of struggle as well as the struggle of the individual. The various colonies of insects and animals such as ants, bees, wasps and beavers, discover to us a process that the human species could well imitate.91 Although far from a collectivist, Russian edmigre geographer Peter Kropotkin developed the most sustained and systematic elaboration of co-operation or 'mutual aid'. Between 1890 and 1896, he presented his argument over seven instalments in the Nineteenth Century, which he brought together as Mutual Aid in 1902. Building on the work of Professor Karl Kessler and Alfred Espinas, the 'anarchist prince' argued that co-operation, rather than competition and conflict, was the universal basis of ethical principles, and the engine of evolution. He turned to nature for evidence: And if the ant ... stands at the very top of the whole class of insects ... is it not due to the fact that mutual aid has entirely taken the place of mutual struggle in the communities of ants ?92 The same, he continued, held true for bees. Although Kropotkin used it to affirm his own anarchist politics, the 'co-operative' behaviour of social insects was a staple of socialist and collectivist arguments. In October 1890, Huxley warned secularist William Platt Ball: Have you considered that State Socialism (for which I have little enough love) may be the product of Natural Selection? The Societies of Bees and Ants exhibit socialism in excelsis.93 Collectivists and individualists alike recognized the ants' nest and the beehive as archetypal socialist communities. In his assessment of the entomological career of John Lubbock, J. G. Myers asserted that 'he missed practically entirely, or at least failed to develop the immense importance of the 90 Stefan Collini, Liberalism and Sociology: L. T.

He first summoned ants and bees in response to Alfred Russel Wallace. Nourished on an intellectual diet of Owenite socialism and Spencerian radicalism, Wallace began, in the 1860s, to challenge Darwinian biology and anthropology with his co-operative, collectivist vision. As co-discoverer of evolution by natural selection, he posed a formidable problem for Lubbock and his circle of scientific naturalists.95 In the Origin of Civilisation, Lubbock opposed Wallace's depiction of savage communities as commendable enclaves of perfect equality and co-operation. Taking a tack which Darwin adopted in the Descent of Man, he argued that Wallace had conflated 'social' organization with 'a high moral condition'. If we accepted Wallace's argument, he stated, 'we must equally credit rooks and bees, and most other gregarious animals, with a moral state higher than that of civilised man'.9' Ostensibly a refutation of John Grote's theory of ethics, Lubbock repeated the same argument in Ants, Bees, and Wasps: 'Organised communities labouring with the utmost harmony for the common good' did not necessarily possess moral faculties. Moreover, he devised experiments, using disabled, dead and anaesthetized ants and bees, to prove that social insects were not paragons of mutual aid; they did not consistently come to the assistance of helpless comrades. Detecting a passionate hatred in some ants, he concluded that these insects, like man, were susceptible to a range of 'individual differences'. More definitively, he concluded that hive- bees 'appear to be thoroughly callous and utterly indifferent to one another'. Aware of the collectivist ideological uses of social insects, John Lubbock employed 'disinterested' experimentation to cast doubts upon the utopian depictions of co-operative, altruistic communities of ants and bees.97 Throughout the nineteenth century, this myrmecological mixture of nature and culture flourished. The ambiguity of the word 'social' in the appellation 'social insect' encapsulated the tensions inherent in the literature on ants, bees and wasps. Natural theologians, social evolutionists and neo-Darwinians all applied varying degrees of 94 J. G.

Descriptions of insect societies performed something of the same function as European travel and exploration writing; it produced self-affirmation and self-definition through likeness and unlikeness. Myrmecologist P. A. Latreille implored readers to consider the similarities: Most travellers believe that it is their duty to inform the public of the very remarkable things that they have seen in the regions through which they have travelled. I have sought to inform myself about a remarkably good nation by the type of individuals which compose it, by their variety, their multitude, their industry; a nation which we count as one of our most bothersome enemies, which lives with us, and of whose history we are ignorant. Would I also not have the right to publish an account of my voyages; to relate what I have seen or what I believe that I have seen ?98 Both travel narratives and literature on miniature or microscopic worlds were beyond the realm of common experiences and perceptions. Whereas travel narratives miniaturized and interiorized 'contacts with the imperial frontier', the microscope revealed a miniature frontier amidst the material world.99 These two frontiers merged on the title pages of David Livingstone's Missionary Travels (1857) and H. W. Bates's (1825-92) Naturalist on the River Amazons (1863), which featured a magnified tsetse fly and a magnified Sauba ant, respectively (Figure 3). Insects and non-European savages both served as objectified and culturally distant 'others'. Working within a developmental framework, nineteenth-century social anthro- pologists used ethnographic parallels to discern vestiges of their primitive ancestors in contemporary savages. In opposition to the degenerationist assumptions of biblical anthropologists, social evolutionists, like Lubbock, deployed savages as the ' missing link' between apes and nineteenth-century European man. Notoriously, Lubbock denigrated savagery to emphasize its evolutionary proximity to animality. He therefore denied savages the possession of religion.100 At the same time, his edifice of evolutionary progress rested upon a belief in the psychic unity of animal, savage and European man. The savage, the ant and the bee were perfectible; they could be 'civilized', 'domesticated' or 'tamed'.101 Thus, Lubbock, renowned armchair 'intellectualist' anthropologist, embarked upon his 98 Pierre-Andre Latreille, Essai sur l'histoire des fourmis de la France, 1798; repr.

Punch likened him to a flea-tamer, and then proposed him for Lord Lieutenant of Ireland; for he could surely 'pacify the Irish hornets' nest' (Figure 4). Like a flea-tamer, Lubbock brought the yawning infinity of the unseen insect world under his dominion. He established the continuity of mental evolution between animal and man; and affirmed the superior rationality of nineteenth-century European man, by demonstrating his control over nature.

Evolutionary anthropologists and biologists grappled with the ambiguous relationship between objectified nature and the subjective experiences of consciousness inherent in both the observer and the observed.103 CONCLUSION While canvassing scientists for their support of the authors of Essays and Reviews, Lubbock engaged in a correspondence with fellow X Club member J. D. Hooker. This exchange is an excellent illustration of Lubbock's particular commitment to scientific naturalism. Hooker felt that the memorial represented sectarianism, and that it threatened disunity within the "'body politic" of scientific men'. He observed that most of the signatories were 'the young progressionists in Science', who represented 'one way of thinking in such matters as " Origins of Species ", " Age of Man ", etc. etc.'; and that they 103 Lubbock, Ants, Bees, and Wasps, op. cit.

Although he would unhesitatingly oppose any challenge to 'progression' within science, Essays and Reviews clearly fell beyond his own broadly demarcated disciplinary boundaries. Lubbock did not share Hooker's vigilance over the borders of science and religion. Whereas Hooker spoke as a professional, vocational scientist, Lubbock spoke for part of a 'generalist', whig-liberal clerisy. Evoking the military metaphor, he cried, 'it is sadly irksome to do nothing while the battle of freedom is being fought, &amp; I do think that the great liberal party should stand by their guns &amp; their friends '104 Lubbock had published his first paper on the social Hymenoptera in 1874. Within a decade, his commitment to the study of ants, bees and wasps came to dominate his public image. In 1882, Punch produced a trenchant satirization of his multi-faceted public persona as one of their 'Fancy Portraits' (Figure 5). Underneath a caricature of him depicted as a bee hovering above flowers was the following verse: How doth the banking busy bee Improve his shining hours By studying on bank holidays Strange insects and wild flowers!"05 By transforming him into the object of his studies, Punch captured Lubbock's avowed campaign to promote industriousness, and self-help through self-knowledge. Writing in 1888, Evangelical evolutionist Henry Drummond declared: A few years ago, under the distinguished patronage of Mr. Darwin, the animal in vogue with scientific society was the worm. At present the fashionable animal is the ant.106 John Lubbock was the British scientist most responsible for the ants' successful ascent to these lofty heights of fame. The ant, in return, provided him with the means to pursue and propagate a professional ideal grounded in the tenets of scientific naturalism. In the act of domesticating ants to a laboratory regime, Lubbock brought a microcosm into his parlour. The ambiguous depiction of him as both 'philosophical biologist' and unoriginal popularizer was perhaps the result of this inability to separate the laboratory from the parlour. Although this ambiguity served scientific naturalism, and the promulgation of evolutionary theory, well, it impeded his recognition as a professional scientist. Lubbock promoted a 'professional ideal' as part of the generalist culture of an intellectual clerisy. The forces of disciplinary fragmentation, however, increasingly equated 104 29 February 1861, J.
