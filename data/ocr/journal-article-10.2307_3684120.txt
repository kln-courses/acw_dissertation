There is no border which can limit the void with a before without including it in the origin-indefinitely. There is no time which delimits the unlimited without at the same time betraying its relativity.

In the beginning, for example, was the Word. But what does the past signal here, if not the impossible? If not that the first instance should remain silent (about) itself lest all be lost (from it)? And what would this Word be without echo, what would it signify except silence? The question naively refers to the absence of the very thing which would enable it to be relevantly posed. In no case does it coincide, can it coincide with that which it seeks to unmask. The beginning does not begin (itself) until it has already ceased beginning, and the only status which it has is that of a future anterior. NOTHING SHALL HAVE TAKEN PLACE BUT THE PLACE which also symmetrically sends it back to the most illusory past, since it is only in the act of denying its existence that it enters, like a phantom, into the realm of the say- able. Preceding everything which attests to its existence, the beginning allows only a retrospective fiction-but it is in this gap, in this opening of the void, in this endless concealment in the unthinkable that it precisely grounds the thought which will express it. Nameless is the beginning of heaven and earth. 1 Indeed how could we name what precedes the nameable? Only a negative can express this status of anteriority, but by drowning itself in its own void. To the priva- tives whose absoluteness is protected by theologies: un-created, in-variant, in-copore- al, im-material, im-mortal, im-mutable, in-corruptible, in-temporal, etc., corresponds the enumeration of what these answers excluded, but in the future tense, as though to anchor memory only it its absence: No earth, no sky, No sea, no men... 2 When above us the skies were not yet named, When below the earth had not yet received a name, When Apsu the primoridal who engendered them When Mammu, when Tiamat, their common mother, Mixed together into one all their waters, When the sacred rooms were not yet constructed, When the reeds of the ponds were not yet visible, When none of the gods shone forth as yet, When they were not yet named, or their destinies...3 If naming always sanctions its own delay, how could it ever claim to be first? The</page><page sequence="3">The Writing Machine 9 expedience of a language which is sacred, primordial, contemporary and creator of what it enunciates evidently is only a sign of our impossibility to come out of the constraints of opposition. As soon as the inaudible moves closer, as soon as the Verb reveals certain of its words, in Homer for example, it declines as though contaminated, to the status of a foreign language. Thus, as we shall see, the process should not be considered to start from the sign. Pretending to be inaugural, the sign could only endlessly mime its own circularity, since it has to be already constituted to de-signate- to whom?-its own birth. Mythology imprisons this tautological figure into that of a Monster, a Sphere, an Egg where the nothingness unites with Being, and whose multi- ple names-Noun, Kneph, Okeanos, Ouroboros, Aion, Leviathan, Ain-Soph, etc.- arbitrarily conjure up that which in principle has no appelation, as though to deny to thought the access to its own silence. As soon as it speaks (for itself) the origin is condemned to the double. Double times: I am yesterday and I know tomorrow.4 double place: Fire of the hearth below, fire of the hearth above, Light which shines in the moon, light which shines in the sun... double effect: Fire which passes, and everything dies behind thy steps, Fire which passes, and all is alive behind thee.5 double ascendancy: Then the gods were born from the bosom of Aspu and Tiamat, Lahmu and Lahamu arose, they had a name...6 for before this disjunction, from which language derives its laws, there is nothing it can invoke as its precedent-the invocation itself owes its efficiency to its repetition: Go quickly, go quickly, Already the echoes are descending this night. ..7 What arises here is not in any sense the sign, but rather its condition: the gap. Mythi- cally, it will be the opening of the mouth or of the eye which will un-close the un- sayable and the in-visible-and doubtlessly this is the ultimate operation which human imagination can lend to the One: He who is at the origin will open the door of the unacknowledged.. .8</page><page sequence="4">10 Jean Paris the origir. opens itself to language, as language to the origin, only in opening it; the part of the origin which inscribes itself in language, and vice-versa, is nothing but this opening. We do not have to look to "inaugural couples" for the "true parents" of speech: dissociated in their sex, in their territories, in their roles, as speech is in its elements, they are themselves captive; their duality repeats the dual conditions of their existence. If, according to the fable, they produce speech, as one says of a play, it is because speech is already virtual in them, between them, it is because they already went through the split which names them and constitutes speech-so that one is tempted to reverse the Heideggerian formula and to hold that "only silence makes speech possible"-silence which furnishes a secondary "mode" after having authorized speech.9 The generation of eponymous twins-frequently by the difference of a syllable, or a letter-manifests the impossibility for the origin to announce itself as such. And if this impossibility seems, traditionally, to veil some ontological mystery, some taboo, it is because language cannot formally transgress, without abolishing itself, the opposition which structures it at every level. What persists in it from the principle remains un- named because it is unnameable. Sounds against silence, traces on a blank page, split of the sign in two faces-the primordial asserts itself only in the absence of its own saying, in this uncertainty that ours reflects only negatively. The goatherd journeys in the brush to the tree where Mouno keeps the secret speech. He says to him, "put your speech in my ear." But first of all Mouno demands a house. The goatherd builds it for him. But Mouno demands a mat. The goatherd gets it for him. But Mouno demands a woman. The goatherd buys one for him. But Mouno: "As for this woman, I'm not sure whether it's a man or a woman" because she has not been to the menstruation house, and, "that is bad." The woman goes to the menstruation house. But Mouno will not talk before she comes back. She comes back. The goatherd: "Teach me your good words." But Mouno: "The woman is not pregnant." She is pregnant. But Mouno: "I don't know if it is a chicken egg or a stone egg." The woman gives birth to a child. "Teach me your good words." But Mouno: "As to the child, I don't know whether it is a serpent or a child," etc.. .10 How could the primordial distinguish between signs, since it remains precisely their between? "Full speech" is only full of its own emptiness, and it is because it ignores the law of the double that we are reduced to it. Like the look (regard) absent from all paintings, it only transmits to all discourse the neutral background, the space of the spacing, of the displacement, of the deletion. And this is to posit paradoxically, since it is "nothing, but this spume", that it tends, in its "virgin verse" to disappear. "It</page><page sequence="5">The Writing Machine 11 disappears, that is to say appears to be that into which it disappears and thus transpires in its final form,"11 impugning in advance, ironically, the antinomies which will try in vain to circumscribe it. First proposition: the question which begins here no longer springs from the sign because, on the contrary, it supposes it; it no longer concerns in criticism, either the signifier or the signified, either speech or writing, but the gap itself from which these will be engendered, or, if one prefers, this articulation whose other name would be: change. A double movement announces itself here, to be deciphered, whose every meaning doubles itself in turn. On the one hand, a beginning has really taken place, since other- wise there would be no problem-and that which has carried it unto my interrogation, though effaced, cannot be illusory. But on the other hand, it has no place other than that from which I question it here, since it cannot indicate by itself that which is no longer, and the movement which regresses toward it can be but fictional. Thus it is the implicit which becomes undeniable, and the explicit, problematic-by an inversion which Heidegger himself witnesses, since every search, for him, comprises "a previous orientation toward that which is searched": but formulates itself "from the essential situation of the questioning being-there."12 Prospectively, in the direction which escapes me, the only reality of the beginning is to found in the future the question which it becomes-retrospectively, in the course which I assign to it, it remains aleato- ry, since the question which it has founded is also the one that founds it. Between the undeniable and the improbable, the paradox inscribes the meaning as the duplicity of the sign which only closes it on condition of its never being closed-and vice-versa. Generating/generated, the beginning obliges (itself) to dispossess its naming of all univocal meaning. To propose it as a speech of the origin and as a speech about the origin. In it as well as outside of it, without any border to define its ulterior post- supposition. For before this disjunction the beginning will only begin perpetually to begin-and the hypothetical term cannot either grow or recede, since it will not displace itself in any time or space. Thus we have to return to what we would say about it previously: sacral or not, every speculation about the origin will always be constrained by this disjunction without which it could not find any orientation. To affirm that in the beginning "was the Word" or that "Noun reigned alone" is to say this nothingness, but to say nothing: it is to posit language in an exteriority which prohibits it, nullifies it, resorbs it in its emptiness. For there to be a beginning, the split has to introduce itself into this primordial which did not know of it: Noun must become bored or the Word must experience itself virtually as separation: "In the beginning was the Word. And the Word was in God and the Word was God." - contradictory proposition, logically absurb, since if the Word is God it exhausts his unity; if it lives in God, it distinguishes itself from Him as a content-but it is precisely because it is one and the other, already disjunct, that it can enter into the sayable. This disjunction calls for and signifies desire. It is desire which is going to thematize the condition of speech-of the universe-in proposing to the One the becoming of the double. Superficially, the fictional diversity of the operation confirms its very pur- pose: the coming into being of the multiple; but fundamentally these modes reduce themselves to two: the scission and/or the emanation, which we can easily identify as</page><page sequence="6">12 Jean Paris metapbor and metonymy. Sometimes, it is the division of the primary and neutral unity into sexually complementary halves which creates the universe-and then speech; example: In the beginning of the world was Atman. .. Looking around him, he could see nothing but Himself. At first he pronounced: "I am. .. " But Atman felt no joy of Himself, and he felt no joy because he was alone. And he was overcome with the desire to have a second. He was in fact as big as a man and a woman when they embrace together. He made his self divide (pat) into two parts: thus husband (pati) and wife (patni) were born.14 Sometimes, on the other hand, it is in materializing its own substance, in projecting it, as it were, outside of itself, that the unity expulses a first couple of opposites; example: Atum took his phallus in his hand in order to give himself pleasure. A brother and sister were born: Shu and Refnut.15 I copulated in my hand; I joined with my shadow and I ejac- ulated through my own mouth. I vomited Shu and I spat Tefnut.16 Desire combines well here, in its first instance, the two forms which, dissociated, are required by any discourse: desire of the self as the same/desire of the self as other. The initial distance is only the impossibility of thinking the identical, and it is significant that it is only produced in dividing itself into these two modes of the sayable. In the first, metaphorical, the resorption of the one into two-Lahma/Lahamu, Kahuli/ Kahela, Izanagi/Izanami, etc.-warrants the specular identity of the constituents, the creative play of their permutations, of which erotic positions will provide as many figures-thus Rangi and Papa, in the Maorian genesis, will make sky and earth corre- spond, copulate, like the halves of gold and silver of the cosmic Egg in the Cbandogya Upanisbad. 17 In the second, metonymic, it is the emphasis on difference, on the mode of expansion, which guarantees the articulation of these constituents: ejaculation, vomiting, spitting, hemorrhage, exhalation, emission of warmth, projection of a light- ning bolt, of a look, etc.,18 diversify corporally the essence of the syntax itself. Sperm, saliva, breath, fever or flux, what comes from the primorial becomes imme- diately distinct from it, and it is in displacing itself that this otherness will constitute the multiple as a discontinuous series. The genesis would not be treated in the mytho- logical discourse so exclusively and so obsessively if it did not refer to the process of this discourse itself, if its two instances-similarity/contiguity-did not repeat the fundamental operations: selection, substitution tracing the axis of paradigms/ combination, concatenation, that of the syntagms-and, beyond, all the categories</page><page sequence="7">The Writing Machine 13 which Jakobson, as one knows, finds at work in rhetoric (metaphor/metonymy), in logic (disjunction/conjunction), in dreams (identification and symbolization/condensa- tion and displacement), in magic (sympathetic magic/contagious magic), in medicine (homeopathy/allopathy), etc.19 Mathematics itself observes this "double production" in the formulation of its own birth. First because the number, no more than the word, escapes from gender: even or odd, it already lends itself, in Martianus Capella's works for example, to the sexualiza- tion of its combinations into male and female. But each gender in turn divides itself into two: the odd numbers into prime or composite/the even into evenly even (pro- ducts of even numbers) or oddly even (products of even and uneven numbers). And the composite numbers in turn are differentiated according to whether they are equal or unequal to the sum of their aliquotes. If they are equal, they are perfect; if unequal, they in turn divide themselves into two opposing groups: unequal by excess (superflui) or by deficiency (diminuti)...20 Seen in this perspective, multiplication, as well, appears double. The fact that Pythagorians conceive the generation of elements along the same lines as that of numbers, can be explained by their setting into relation to two classes of operations which one could respectively call metaphoric and metonym- ic: the multiplication of the same by the same and the multiplication by the different. From the second one, one can generate the series of whole numbers by syntagmatic displacement of each term toward its contiguous term; the first which generates the series of squares, illustrates above all the scission of the beginning and its passage to the triad. If indeed we apply it to the unity-the argument is to be found in Thierry of Chartres-it can only be indefinitely repeated, the product being equal to the multiplicator and the multiplicand: 1 x 1 = 1. Yet, how can we posit the one without the ghost of the double and the triple, that is to say without evoking the scandal of scission? It is the same here with the number as with the Word. In order that its iden- tity "think itself in itself" it has to belong to itself, desire itself, postulate its alterity as a possibility. "The only number" Mallarm&amp; will say, "which cannot be another," cannot be conceived without passing through this impossibility. Tautological multi- plication summarizes this necessity by emptying it of every anthropomorphic pre- supposition. It breaks with the one without breaking it, it preserves it and explicates it in opening it up to the virtuality of the two, the triple product nullifying the threat of their split and restoring the initial term in its integrity. Translate: "The consciousness of self is essentially this return to oneself from the being-other. As self-consciousness, it is movement. But when it distinguishes itself only, as the thing in itself, from itself, its difference as other is immediately suppressed; the difference does not exist; and the consciousness of self is only the motionless tautology of myself = myself."21 Admittedly the difference is "suppressed", but in order for it to be suppressed it must at least have been possible, and not only possible, inevitable, since it alone allows the tautology to even establish itself. That theology derived from this the structure of the Trinity-the Father reflecting Himself in the Son through the "connexion" of the Holy Ghost-or Hegel that of the dialectic, does not bear perhaps such important conse- quences today; the point is that this metaphorical genesis, entirely included in the virtual, also announces the other: one becomes two in order to know itself as one and</page><page sequence="8">14 Jean Paris becomes three in order to abolish two, beginning the infinite series of ruptures: two becomes four, etc. The two multiplications conjugate, presuppose one another, like the two modes of desire or the two axes of language, as a condition of all beginning. Thus, what is anticipated in the mythical is nothing but the system of its own actualization. If the two laws of its functioning structure the genesis, it is because they alone effectively allow us to conceive of it-and it is one and the same whether we attribute them to the primordial itself or projects them onto it. In either case, they necessarily preexist their formulation. The first page is always white. Space before space, beginning before this word which already haunts it as a possible becoming, no sign traces even as much as an absence in it, and the future alone will reveal that which -perhaps-inscribed itself in the invisible, in the negative: this "virgin index"whose non-existence I can no longer pretend to, since I know now and forever its trace-from the chance of a title, for example: A THROW OF THE DICE on page two, on this page which accuses the "rigid, ridiculous whiteness" of the preceding one only in denying it with four words, themselves immediately denied, absorbed by the desert-az-zahr in Arabic means dice throw-the etymological detour restitutes in advance the Book to the sterility of its origin: "A throw of the dice will never abolish a throw of the dice." ("Un coup de d6s jamais n'abolira le hasard/Un coup de des jamais n'abolira un coup de d6s.") And, ironically, this is just what hap- pens, it is the temptation to abolish, to take back, to nullify the "simple insinuation toward silence" which forces the poem to generate itself toward this end. That is to say, to discover the impossibility of not writing itself, in order to re-produce at the end its initial absence, and therefore to conceive the absurdity of its own project since once written, nothing will erase it. On the second page, no longer defended by its whiteness, the inscription of the rape instantly gives rise to the system of oppositions which rendered it tautologically possible and which the first (perhaps) concealed: high/low, left/right, black/white, formed/unformed; whole/empty, figure/ground, text/extra-text, foreground/background.22 But the categories, which found the passage from the possible to the actual in implementing it, would remain empty if they did not themselves call in their translations: sky/sea, masculine/feminine, night/day, body/thought, matter/nothingness, meaning/meaninglessness, life/death, etc., between the four cardinal points of the page or its zenith, its meridians, its equator and its nadir. And there springs already, the "mobility of the written" tracing the horizon, a whole thematics which organizes itself into an "orphic explanation of the Earth": fall of the one into the dual, of the absence into the multiple, of the inert into transmuta- tion, sky mirroring itself in water, plunging into it, destroying every vessel in its ship- wreck, like consciousness in the carnal night, and inversely: sea climbing toward the clouds sail toward the sun, body towards knowledge, and so on. A "total expansion of the letter," the Book will only abolish itself fictiously once it has been finished, following "natural law," when, once exhausted all the "prismatic subdivisions of the</page><page sequence="9">The Writing Machine 15 Idea," it will finally name, as a "last point which sacralizes it" this "identical neutral- ity of the abyss": the initial whiteness regained.24 The text begins perhaps to clarify itself on the basis of this model which assigns to its ending the vacuity of the antecedent, and the opposite, "the successive sidereal/ impetus of a totality in formation." "Apart from the secret which it withholds," the beginning is only evidenced once it has begun, by the disjunction which compells it to the reign of doubles and to its immediate re-production. And this disjunction, which we will call generative here, since it metaphorically includes those out of which the text is constituted, can only be discerned at the place, already disjointed, where its apparition effaces itself, is effaced for ever. In the whiteness of the paper, the word, "stellar progeny," keeps only the trace of it as an enigma, but the "formal division" which founded its visibility, its readability-this would be, say, the fold separating the two first pages-conceals itself in an immemorial present. We can only infer it from its repetitions, and thus this passage to the preliminary should be thought of as a disjunc- tion of disjunction, if that which enables it to be thought were not also that which conceals it. The birth of a writing is to itself its own question, but the question of this question loses itself in the unfathomable. "Ich habe meine Grunde vergessen," Neitz- sche will say-and Mallarme: "L'ombre enfouie dans la profondeur..." Thus as long as it is thought as metaphorical, textual genesis only refers back to its paradox. But if the split which it presupposes and which it accomplishes eludes all interrogation, it is still as a question that it inscribes itself in the text. Therefore it had to cbange, to displace itself, and it is here, consequently, that the other mode, metonymic-one is tempted to say the "other scene"-intervenes to translate, in other words to transform this split into, precisely, a question. We now understand why generative disjunction can never be ascertained except in its doubling back; it is because it does not disjoin terms already constituted by a lexicon (as do the other disjunctions which will follow) but rather the two modes which will allow the lexicon to constitute itself. From this operation, and from it alone, the text can thematize the law which produces it. The concrete question out of which it proceeds-whatever this question is-will be, turned toward us, the reflexive side of this original, unformulable, disjunction: the difference attempting to deny itself in its saying as it will say itself by its negation. For the question, of course, calls for an answer: the closing of the space from which it arose. But, in attempting to close this space, the question keeps pro- jecting itself outside of it, until it symmetrically attains its double opposite. "One has to go from zero to zero," Valery says, but from one to the other there will be that which renders this action unforgettable, all this multiple thickness which must be crossed, this dispersion, this diversion which writing can only refuse in refusing also its own birth, etc. That this suspension provisionally be the point where-very early, as we can see- ideology would interfere. For this discourse of the beginning can only itself begin in emerging from its own myth. Of concern, here, is the "text"-its question. And how could this question pretend to be so exclusive? Not only does it, practically as soon as it has been asked, expand towards those which repeat and change it; but the multipli- city into which it enters overwhelms it and remains the master of its consequences, if</page><page sequence="10">16 Jean Paris not of its pertinence. This forces us to multiply the perspectives of its resolution; yet the total number of these surpasses the number of elements out of which it is actually composed, since it also depends on those which surround it. "The text"-we must insist with Lotman on these evidences at a time when writing institutes itself as a causa sui-"the text as a general rule does not exist in and for itself," but as the counter- weight of exterior structures, of an bors-texite to which it remains attached "as are the two terms of an opposition."25 And so, from the outset of its generative question, it finds itself taken in an immense and multiform history, where its introduction cannot miss causing in return some variation, however small. Here, probably, some critical economy should make explicit what attracted it to a particular problematics, a particu- lar genesis, and should discover in its reiterations the "reciprocal displacements", the "transmission" which make it a "bearer of action", as has been so well shown by Jean Pierre Faye. Thus it is not in the old fashion, that of signifieds, that these transfers are likely to be instructive, since that part of the world which passes into the question, and vice versa, is only secondarily of a conceptual order. The real purpose should be to "capture alive the circulation of the signifiers and their effect on form"26 or even, beyond this division, proceeding from the underlying split of the sign itself, to elabo- rate this criticism of the textual process which can also be read as the process of our age, as that, first of all, of its own alienation, and which could function at the collec- tive level as well as at the level of individual works. From this methodological view- point, there is no difference between the type of analysis practised in Langages totali- taires and that which is hypothetically proposed here. In the network of its relations, internal and/or external, synchronic and/or dia- chronic, the question fixes a first anchor point: it defines itself as contradictory. And this contradiction itself can be understood according to two analogous and comple- mentary perspectives. On the one hand, the question specifies, localizes in a text the disjunction which provokes it-it would be difficult to justify this passage from the informulable to the formulated, except that the rule now seems clear enough: this metonymic displacement, which rejoins history to the same extent that history calls for it, can precisely be described as an "ideological effect." On the other hand, this question which unlooses itself, issued from another, immemorial one, already appears properly reflexive, textually dedicated to its own reiteration-and from this, as soon as the question is asked, it's the very project of self-destruction, of resolution, which obliges it to repeat itself, in an obsessional or disguised or allusive or symbolic form which at every moment of development, except the last, designate the plurality of possible but provisional solutions. Thus, the first disjunction only suppresses itself by passing through, by producing other disjunctions-that is, by posing its succession in the form of chains of questions, of series of repetitions and changes, determined at the same time by the ideological system and by the textual mechanism itself-one trans- lating/transforming the other-and it is precisely this "series of transformational stages" which will be the object of a generative criticism. One is tempted to write "the other scene". . . To take up now this previous allusion, the genesis of this "textual" process, one notices a double operation: the disjunctive appearance of a split which constitutes the virtuality of the sign, the conditions of its</page><page sequence="11">The Writing Machine 17 own saying and the displacement through which it changes itself, at the border of the text, into that question out of which the text arises. But reduced to these two mo- ments, the model would not reveal much of its essential quality, its dynamism. As we have seen in the case of cosmological multiplications, not only does each operation imply, repeat the other, but each one, in order to satisfy this relation, must repeat itself in doubling itself. The generative disjunction thus escapes, in a way, the condi- tion of the ones which follow: in producing nothing but the modes of production, the two axes according to which the genesis will accomplish itself, it remains virtually anterior to that which, textually, manifests itself as a question. That is to say: it supposes this metonymic displacement in intimating, however primeval it may be, that it re-produce itself and, thus doing, that it fix the principle of its reiteration. But this displacement in turn, if it belongs to ideology for its effects, also displays in its func- tioning a rhythm which remains its own, a logic of temporality. For the split which it signals and which manifests itself indifferently in speech or writing-can in no way be restricted to the mythic order of the beginning: in its most syntagmatic dimension it hides behind any particular genesis. And it is because it also is dedicated to its re- production that it can constrain the disjunction, as well as be constrained by it to generate a series of repetitions-this series which aims only at suturing the initial gap, at recovering the whole which theoretically preceded it, but which in the end only attains its opposite-since from now on this movement of annulation will no longer annul that which will have allowed it to be annuled: the text itself.27 Some have already guessed that all this is about Freud. That all along this topic has been the unconscious. And, for instance, the play of a certain spool thrown from his crib by a lonely child, then brought back by the end of a string, and thrown again, each disappearance greeted with a Fort! and each return with a Da!-like a face hid- den/uncovered in turn-coucou/here I am-now you see me/now you don't-and, in the further extreme to be sure, time lost and time regained. It is even in this playful detour that one can verify what until now has been advanced as a simple hypothesis. It little, matters in fact that alternation, according to Freud, exorcizes the relation to the mother in dramatizing it, or that the child left alone compensates for her absence "by himself staging the disappearance and return of the objects within his reach."28 The essential thing, as Lacan has rightly seen, is that the genesis re-presents itself here of itself: significantly, this "moment where desire humanizes itself is also the moment in which the child is born to language." "We can now see that the subject not only masters his depriva- tion in assuming it, but that he elevates his desire to a second power. For his action destroys the object which it makes appear and disappear in the anticipatory provocation of its absence and its presence. Thus it negativizes the magnetic field of desire in order to become itself its own object. And this object which immediately embodies itself in the symbolic couple of two elementary ejaculations announces in the subject the diachronic</page><page sequence="12">18 Jean Paris integration of the dichotomy of the phonemes, the structure of assimilation being offered by existing language; thus the child begins to engage itself in the system of concrete discourse of his environment, in reproducing more or less approximately in his Fort! and Da! the sounds which he receives from it." 29 Yet, how could such a mechanism engage itself concretely unless it were not at the same time supported by another? In periodically conjuring his spool, the little man in fact accomplishes a series of actions in a single action, or rather his unique action decomposes itself under a look, which of course cannot be his, into a series of perspec- tives every one of which would authorize a different theoretical approach. From one to the other, as between the versions of a sentence, there is only a transformational operation. Thus in their enumeration, which follows, there is no attempt to articulate them chronologically, to classify them in separate "moments," since what we are trying to do is precisely to liquidate taxonomic practices. Thus, let us count, using temporal liaisons only as stylistic expedients. The question which from the outset the analyst poses when considering this game is that of its cathartic virtue. As soon as the scene which it reproduces is discovered, it is important for him to explain why this duplication allows the infant "to bear without protesta- tion the departure and absence of his mother." But this would be to anticipate, with insufficient grounds, a more general problem which is known to have concerned Freud through his interest for the theater: the affective, if not magical value of representa- tion. Doubtlessly this is why he turns away from it in order to ask himself, briefly, as though derivatively, whether this game "was invented by the child himself or whether it was suggested to him by someone or something." But again this would be to fall into a dilemma, the more serious one of innateness and apprenticeship, complicated by the possibility that these two eventualities only form one: for, if the conduct has in fact been learned, it could only interiorize itself through a preexisting structure of wel- come, and if it declared itself spontaneously, it exteriorized this preexisting structure- and which one? We will come back to this. The dramaturgical question then reiterates itself under another form: "How to reconcile with the pleasure principle the fact that in playing the child reproduced this event, for him painful?" First answer: "At the outset, he was in a passive situation-he was overpowered by the experience; but, by repeating it, unpleasurable though it was, as a game," he satisfied at the same time "an instinct for mastery." Second answer: "Throwing away the object so that it was 'gone' might satisfy an impulse of the child's [...] to revenge himself on his mother for going away from him. In that case it would have a defiant meaning: 'All right, then, go away! I don't need you. I'm sending you away myself'." Third answer, combining both: "the child may, after all, only have been able to repeat his unpleasant experience in play because the repetition carried along with it a yield of pleasure of another sort but nonetheless a direct one."30 In all cases, this orientation of the problems toward the utilitarian leaves many others in the shadow. The relationship, for example, between the spool and the mother, that is to say the arbitrariness of symbolizations. It is from this point precisely</page><page sequence="13">The Writing Machine 19 that the interrogation was to start again, in order to move this time toward the signi- fier. Freud himself encouraged this, elsewhere, in noting that the object reflects "what is most changeable in the drive", that far from remaining "originally connected" it can be "replaced at will at any point in its destiny.'31 Similarly, in relation to what it symbolizes, it acts like a name in relation to its referent: on the one hand, its liaison remains contingent; on the other hand, it manifests itself as "murder of the thing" and one can go even further, since the spool appears doubly matricidal: not only does it eclipse the mother, supplant her in a fiction where her absence is assumed, but her function in the play is to disappear, repeating the eviction which founded the play as substitute. And if "this death constitutes in the subject the eternalization of his desire," according to Lacan,32 what the child learns is that this desire exists only as discontinuity: just as the sign and the object continually change, the one making unnecessary the recourse to the other, the desire would be denied by what would satisfy it-"Time," Leclaire will say, "punctuates its perpetuation,"33 initiating this binary movement which the oscillation between Fort! and Da! expresses... One understands the difficulty of isolating these instances, since they are reciprocally dependent on one another. For example, in order for the object to function as symbol, it must already be distinct from what it symbolizes, but in order for it to distinguish itself from it, it must have already gained the power to substitute itself for it, and for it to obtain this power it must already be subject to alternation, etc. This is why the process as a whole remains the tributary of this primary disjunction, which cannot be grasped, which the other, temporal, only exorcises in repeating. If this play refers back to the genesis, for which it furnishes an exemplary image, this division from which all begins, we should start at last to suspect its place: systole/diastole, inspiration/expira- tion, ingestion/excretion, repast/repose, sleep/wakefulness. . ., this space from which the first instance derives, in all myths, its disjunctive power and its language-it is the body. Nothing has been said of this play, of which nothing remains to be said, as long as the body from which it proceeds, whose rhythms it mimes, has not inscribed itself into the play of the text which it announces. And to begin at its beginning, if nothing is said of it, it is that this beginning has never taken place. Has never, at least, a sayable place. The body has no name. Blind hearth. But already in the opaqueness it is haunt- ed by alternation, which the unconscious makes into the condition for all language- and vice versa. Thus the chance of an infantile rite serves only to affirm, like the two twins of the first emanation, the disjunction of the two generating modes which rule it. And this first disjunction, absolutely original, can only be inferred through its re- production. In itself, it does not take place in any conceivable time or space-and it is this very impossibility of situating it which negatively implies its doubling: it dispar- este. In the virtual, in fact, the change of a mother into a spool can only occur meta- phorically because it also, like the primordial, has already split into two persons: one tangible/the other hidden. But the substitution also could not occur without the metonymic passage from one phase to the following phase. The identity of the symbol and the symbolized necessarily calls forth its own rupture, but in order for it to produce itself it is necessary that their difference, in declaring itself, should also</page><page sequence="14">20 Jean Paris declare itself as capable of being neutralized. Metaphor becomes metaphoric through the mediation of metonymy just as metonymy becomes metonymic through the mediation of metaphor. And the essential thing is no longer one term or the other, neither the Fort! of exile nor the Da! of return, but the pendulum motion of this voyage-or, if one prefers, the essential thing in language is syntax. What does the little one gain from this play, if not the discovery and interiorization by exteriorization of the capital condition of the code? More than the opposition of a signifier and a signified, what he experiences, what he tries out, is the complementarity of the sign and the act, which in any enunciation will become that of the nominal and the verbal. Of those two branches of the phrasal tree which in their divergence repeat the very inscription of the genesis: repetitive disjunction. And if we are concerned with what feeds it, Freud should be left to arbitrate: "The compulsion to repeat must be ascribed to the unconscious repressed."34 Now, it is evidently not in its content that the repetition is constrained, since the mechanism is purely formal, syntactic one might say, independent of what it actualizes. Vertiginous supplement: that which is repressed in the unconscious, for ever, out of reach, and which therefore guarantees the perpetuity of its reiterations, is the very law of its functioning, this fundamental disjunction which commits the whole system of signs to nullify it. But in vain, since it is in the attempt to return to this null point, to suture the difference which gives them birth, that the signs necessarily call upon others, and that these others, for this very reason, will have no other recourse or role than to repeat them in transforming them, and so on. This alternation, in multiplying itself, generates language as dual at every level; but this multiplication, itself produced from alternation, only translates a law which over- flows all the areas. By what arbitrary rule can we now privelege one or another term at the expense of its relatives? Introduce a causal order through the expedient of hier- archy? If the unconscious appears "structured like a language" it is because language too would appear structured like the unconscious, the one and the other already structured by the deeper body, and the fact that this body itself is subject to this dynamics-into which, somewhere, the text will be located-suggests that it structures the material universe itself. It is not surprising then, that mathematics provides some paradigm for it as well. In formalizing complex movements-the fall of a leaf, for example, or the spreading of a drop of ink in the water of a bottle-that is to say the "qualifiers of deterministic type" emerging from "quantifiers subjected to rather large aleatory fluctuations", Rene Thom distinguishes the alternative opposition of two elements, of two temporalities (just as the analyst in a particular dream or the critic in a particular story): periods of regular change or chreodes separated by catastrophes or bifurcations... 35 It is on the basis of this model, whose analogy was furnished by remote cosmogonies, and whose formulation found a precedent in Freud, that the final constitution of the text will define itself as the serialization of its own contra- diction. This contradiction, specified at the textual level by the question which translates/ transforms the generative disjunction, reappears with insistence at every phase, as though writing could only assure itself any hold through and by this contradiction: "each new repetition appears to firm up this mastery" where Freud localizes "a source</page><page sequence="15">The Writing Machine 21 of pleasure." This is to strangely equate pleasure and failure. For if the alternative is ceaselessly made to reproduce itself, it is because it is unable to resolve itself into its principle. Conceiving this fatalism as a "process of maturation," Freud is forced to introduce the corrective: while the child never grows tired of hearing the same story over and over again, of again going through the same ceremony, however painful, with the most intransigent exactitude, "later, this character trend tends to disappear" or at least to become diversified, travestied, so that a joke heard for a second time will have practically no effect. So repetition itself enters into the disjunctive process which brought it about. It separates itself, like medieval multiplication, into two instances which respectively correspond to childhood and to adult life: the productive repetition of identity and the productive repetition of difference-along the lines of which one could distribute not only the styles, but all literary genres. This play of the same and the other also furnishes a first formal grid to criticism; it determines the essential rhythm of a text, it reveals a deep structure very different from the surface structure, since repetition can take even the detour of singularity. "Real repetition" Deleuze asserts, "appears as a strange conduct which we have in relation to what cannot be exchanged, replaced or substituted: a poem which one repeats to the extent that one cannot change a single word. The concern is no longer an equivalence between similar things, or even the identity of the Same. True repetition addresses itself to something strange, inexchangeable and different, without 'identity'. Instead of exchanging the similar and identifying the Same, it authenticates the different. "36 To shift to Chom- sky, in one case creativity assures its negation by the strict respect of the rule; in the other, it is in changing the rule that it assures its own functioning. Generative criticism can define its purpose as the analysis of this dynamics at work in the text, that is in retracing, step by step, the work of transformation. For if the text, like a leaf or a drop of ink, like the play of Fort! and Da!, like repetition itself, participates in the two states whose alternation provides its structure, it is because they correspond so well to the two orientations which solicit it and which also pressure it to destroy itself: the return to the origin/the advance toward the end. These two states in turn create two others: one of equilibration between opposites and the other of rupture, let us say: identity and displacement. And there too, this dyna- mics participates of the body itself: "An urge inherent in organic life to restore an earlier state of things which the living entity has been obliged to abandon under the pressure of external disturbing forces," how could it be translated except by this nostalgia, this despair of being torn from the "white page" and abandoned to the hell of succession? It is in order to suture this opening, to end up, in other words, its own reflexivity that the text, being unable to go back, will paradoxically re-present, re- produce it, and then represent this representation, reproduce this reproduction, and so on, rebounding, like Macbeth from crime to crime, from repetition to repetition, in a series of series every term of which will only be the exact or transformed version of the preceding one. And the new task of criticism will be this very production: to retrace from chreode to chreode the bifurcations which ramify themselves, the struc- tural changes of a deep syntax which articulates it in its duration. Generative grammar has already codified this register: expansion/substitution/suppression/reduction/ addition/permutation, etc.</page><page sequence="16">22 Jean Paris Strangely enough, if the origin retracts into the inconceivable, textual consciousness can more easily conceive-though falsely-its ending. And this ending, too, must be thought of on all the levels which it invests from the beginning, according to all the perspectives and parabolas whose point of convergence it fixes. As the definitive return of the same, this empty wall prohibiting every transformation from going on any further: "an old state," Freud says, "an initial state since abandoned by life," like the silence by speech or whiteness by writing, "and toward which it tends to return through all the detours of evolution"-since it is only for having preceded movement that inertia gives movement no choice but to return to that state. Thus this contradic- tion which constitutes the essence of the temporal, presents writing as analogous to life, to the living substance where at the same time two opposite and complementary processes take place: that of construction by assimilation/of destruction by disintegra- tion-which the text will translate by the antithesis of disjunction and conjunction. Flowing back across the whole transformational series, a counter-system defines something like an anti-text which is just as necessary for the dynamics as is the nega- tive for an assertion, in order to exorcise exorcism in turn and to reinvest into the nothingness of a last page this force which, from far away, "had awakened in inani- mate matter the properties of the living." Conjunction, without which no generative disjunction could have arisen, fulfills the vocation of the text which is to recover its anterior mutism as its real place. One last time Freud admirably summarizes this whole mechanism which, one should say, condemns man to creativity: "The repressed instinct never ceases to strive for complete satisfaction, which would consist in the repetition of a primary experience of satisfaction. No substitute or reactive formations and no sublimations will suffice to remove the repressed instinct's persisting tension; and it is the difference in amount between the pleasure of satisfaction which is de- manded and that which is actually achieved that provides the driving factor which will permit of no halting at any position attained, but in the poet's words, 'Presses ever forward unsubdued'."37 Thus the text only clarifies its deepest nature, its movement, in the instant when it definitively bids farewell to them. The instant when the division of the reflexive closes, unto the deletion of its original split. And one finally understands why this transfor- mational work was bound to occult its own awareness by tautologically denying it the least repose: it is because transformation never produces anything but difference that it is forced into repetition. Each suture does nothing but create a new opening, as each continuity leads but to new catastrophes. And that is why, finally, the meaning remains unattainable: for if it can arise only at the end of the enunciation, as the last product of its production, where is its place but beyond the book, where, but impos- sibly, in the act of closing it? The subject matter here will be the text-or death. Translated by Inez Hedges</page><page sequence="17">The Writing Machine 23 NOTES 1. Tao t6 king, I.
