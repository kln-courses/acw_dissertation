The reader might become bothered by this as well as by the strictly chronological, rather than conceptual, organization, which results sometimes in a sacrifice of the logical flow of narration. Possibly the worst example is an interruption of an enlightening discussion of Cole's progress on the Voyage of Life series with a ten-page digression on extraneous paintings and Cole's venture into architecture (pp. 241-251). This book comes on the heels of some rather provocative challenges to traditional interpretations of Cole and his work: semiological and psychoanalytical discussions of some of Cole's paintings by Bryan Wolf in his 1982 Romantic Re-Vision,5 which Parry mentions and discards (p. 57); and a more conventionally accept- able argument, which Parry does not address, probing the motiva- tions of Cole and a few of his Federalist patrons, in Alan Wallach's 1981 article, "Thomas Cole and the Aristocracy," in Arts Magazine.6 Prompted by these efforts and others, if by nothing else, Parry might have paid more attention to interpretation and thereby have provided us with a more developed account of the artist. Although one learns much about Cole's paintings, one leaves Parry's book without the impression that one really knows Cole. The opportunity to establish a sense of the man is partly precluded by the fact that the text does not cover Cole's early formative years. This includes those he spent as an engraver's assistant in England and as a painter of theatrical scenery in Ohio. Parry says in the preface that his treatment of this period will be published elsewhere (p. 14), but a subsequent footnote tells the reader that this part of Cole's life has already been published separately as a section in the 1986 Corcoran Gallery exhibition catalogue, Views and Visions.7 There are additional opportunities, which are overlooked, for interpreting Cole within the time frame of the book. One of Cole's most intriguing and telling statements, made in 1838, is that "I never succeed in painting scenes, however beautiful, immediately on returning from them [.] I must wait for Time to draw a veil over the common details" (p. 201). This sounds very like the recommen- dation of Sir Joshua Reynolds, in his second and ninth discourses, and the method described by Washington Allston, whom Cole had met in 1828, in his published novel Monaldi. Parry lets this rather rich confession pass and uses the letter in which it appeared to confirm that Cole was then working on certain paintings. Other fascinating quotations with wider implications that might be developed in the future include Cole's description in 1826 of a wooded area southwest of Albany in anthropomorphic terms: "The hemlock with its grey mossy head . . . arms over the trees [like a] patriarch blessing his children . . . some trees intertwining their branches with others as though in affection.... The young support- ing the aged" (p. 31); and Henry Tuckerman's 1867 response to Cole's highly contrived and sentimental The Hunter's Return as "altogether a beautiful and most authentic illustration of American life and nature" (p. 311). In the epilogue, Parry disagrees with a recent "pejorative reading" of Cole's art as "transitional" to luminism. He sees "evidence, however faint, of luminist tendencies" in the light that appears in some of Cole's late work and therefore denies that Cole is merely transitional. There is difficulty here in that luminism, as a category, is a 20th-century invention that has had a flexible definition. If it is 4 For another interpretation-one that is well argued-see H.A.

Cole's dramatic use of light in Parry's late examples surely developed from the concept of the sublime as defined by Edmund Burke. Parry's book makes a number of significant contributions, such as its correction of the common assumption that Cole's American scenes were the ones that were consistently preferred by the picture-buying public (pp. 204-205). As a compendium of careful archival research, this book will unquestionably be used as the basis for further scholarship, but it also leaves much to be done in the way of both a full catalogue raisonn6 and a more thorough exploration of how Cole relates to his contemporaries. DORINDA EVANS Emory University Atlanta, Ga. 30322 MARTIN KEMP, The Science of Art: Optical Themes in Western Art from Brunelleschi to Seurat, New Haven and London, Yale University Press, 1990. Pp. 375; 16 color pls., 553 ills. The characterization of the arts as "visual" serves to obscure the simple and important fact that the long tradition of Western painting descending from Greek classicism has been more or less explicitly optical. It has been optical in two ways. First, the perennial goal of the imitation of appearances has been achieved primarily by showing the surfaces of recognizable forms as if they were surfaces in light and therefore in space. Such imitation is optical in the sense that, whatever else it might do, its elements are light, dark, and color, shown as if from a more or less definite point of view, as appearances to the eye. The familiar features of modeling and highlights-the constituents of the "heritage of Apelles"-are optical in this basic and culturally specific sense. Light and shadow imply sources of light with respect to forms and also imply the geometrically regular behavior of light, since shadows are cast and light sources are reflected in predictable ways. This leads to the second meaning of the optical. Western painting has also developed at least in parallel to an intermittently developing tradition of optics, which, if perhaps less well known than the histories of physics, biology, or astronomy, has nonetheless been foundational for Western science in general. Western optics is based upon the premise that the relation of sight and its objects may be described geometrically and that this description allows us to explain why things do not appear to us as they "really" are, why objects of the same size appear smaller at a distance (because they are under a smaller angle of vision), or why round coins appear to be ovals (because they form a base nonperpendicular to the point of sight at the vertex of the visual angle.) Optics thus began as the paradoxical science of appearances. On the one hand, it explained appearances away by demonstrating that things are not really as they seem (or that they really are not as they seem); on the other hand, however, optics also provided constructions for appearances themselves, and thus might assist in fooling the eye, of deceiving Pliny's famous birds, or even great painters themselves. Western painters not only understood the forms they represented to be primarily optical, they also organized these forms in ways consistent with geometric optics, showing ground lines as sloping ground planes, and edges perpendicular to the surface as recessive diagonals, refining the foreshortened drawing corollary to their optical enterprise. Once again, these features of Western painting hardly seem extraordinary, and their historical appearance is usually attributed to observation, or to the study of nature. But again it may be suggested that a fundamental conception of painting as optical provided the deeper framework for these equally fundamental (and simple) devices of representation, devices that in their exploration and adaptation by painters might contribute to the understanding of the discipline of optics, just as the investiga-</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 497 tions of the optical writers might contribute to the work and understanding of painters. Both proceeded from a common base. Geometric optics in fact seems to have begun in close proximity to painting. If we are to believe Vitruvius, skenographia, or scene painting, was invented by Agatharcus for a play by Aeschylus, his innovation then being improved upon by the philosophers Democri- tus and Anaxagoras. Vitruvius's skenographia is often translated by the term "perspective," and we see late echoes of it in Roman architectural painting. It may be fairly safely imagined that the ability to create such illusions (from the word ludere, to play, like the plays that took place before them) not only created pictorial possibilities but also raised the need for the explanation of properly optical questions, questions about the physiology of the eye, the nature of light and color and of the medium between the eye and its objects, and the nature of the transmission of the forms of things to the eye and, beyond that, to the mind. All of these problems were investigated through the centuries, taking optics further and further from its connection with painting, as, for its part, painting devel- oped themes and techniques in adaptation to its own purposes. But there was always a common ground shared by the art of painting and the science of optics (or the art of painting and the art of optics, as the matter would have been stated before the skimming off of the "fine" arts in the 18th century.) Martin Kemp's The Science of Art: Optical Themes in Western Art from Brunelleschi to Seurat begins with the premise "that there were special kinds of affinity between the central intellectual and observa- tional concerns in the visual arts and the sciences in Europe from the Renaissance to the nineteenth century." Proceeding with the scope and scrupulousness of inference we have come to expect in his scholarship, Kemp does not try to show that art and the science of vision advanced abreast into the modern world, arguing instead that art and science continued to grow robustly and independently in the period under examination and that their paths only met from time to time in episodes of collaboration or of obvious or possible influence. What emerges from the explanation of these art- historical episodes are remarkably clear and synthetic histories of the "optical themes" making up the three parts of the book. The first is the history of linear perspective from Giotto to Turner; the second is a history of what might be called the technology of perspective, the many mechanical devices for the reproduction of appearances devised between Alberti's veil and the invention of photography; the third is a history of color theory from the Renaissance to the end of the 19th century, to Seurat. These accounts and explanations will be used for many years to come, and when they are finally amended and revised, the amendments and revisions will be based upon the materials that Kemp has presented in support of his own interpretations. The book thus provides a much-needed history of perspective itself (usually considered in terms of its origins, as if it could have no history once formulated) and of the various apparatuses more or less closely allied to painting that made the geometry of perspective literally manageable. The proliferation of these devices, which roughly paralleled that of the optical devices of the new natural sciences (telescopes and microscopes, for example) forms a signifi- cant and underexamined commentary on painting, on its presumed nature and conditions of viewing, even if, for example, the panto- graph or zograscope had little or no impact upon art of the first rank. In fact, once major themes were set they continued to be repeated and refined throughout the centuries of the tradition Kemp describes. Velazquez used a variant of Renaissance one-point perspective and the simplest principle of catoptrics when he devised the optical armature for his endlessly fascinating Las Meninas. The camera obscura, based on the pinhole images demonstrating the theory of light upon which medieval optics was based (and upon which, as I believe, one-point perspective itself depended), stands behind the still and again endlessly fascinating brilliance of Ver- meer. At the same time, the common optical base of painting and natural science meant that explorations or results in one could at any time intersect with the other, even if, to take another major example, Newtonian color theory, and the speculation on the nature of color and light it provoked, had no impact on painting for over a century. The eventual impact, however, had the force of a fundamental correction and reorientation. Both painting and optics were part of a reevaluation of the world as in some basic respect optical, and the potential for important interaction between the two was very much heightened by the keen interest of the founders of modern science in optics, the careful working out of the epistemolog- ical implications of the new optics in 17th- and 18th-century philosophy, the emergence of the modern psychology of percep- tion, and the increasing assimilation and institutionalization of these major intellectual changes over time. In his opening treatment of Renaissance linear perspective, Kemp has held to the position he formed in reaction to S.Y. Edgerton's The Renaissance Rediscovery of Linear Perspective, pub- lished in 1975. In that book Edgerton argued that medieval optics figured prominently in the invention of perspective, as did the humanist recovery of Ptolemy's Geographia. Kemp insists instead that the invention of perspective should be explained in terms of solutions to problems presented by the earlier tradition of painting and by the practical mathematics of surveying and measuring learned by every Florentine schoolboy of Brunelleschi's station. He places in the category of less immediate contingent factors bearing on the invention "a range of techniques from medicine and classical science, including optics, astronomy, horology, and geography." These belong to what he calls the "technically difficult category" and should for that reason be set aside as unnecessary elements of any explanation. Optics, astronomy, horology, and geography, how- ever, were all applications of geometry, and their principles and arguments therefore overlapped to one or another degree. When Vitruvius (I. 1. 14-16) wrote of the learning appropriate to the architect, he argued that while medicine and music, astronomy and optics might share principles, so that theorists of one might speak with comprehension to theorists of the other, we still call a physician rather than a musician to heal us when we are sick, or, by implication, an architect rather than an astronomer to correct the proportions of the design of a building. The important point, however, is that all these specialized skills apply the same principles to different situations and purposes, and so it may be said did optics and surveying. A person such as Brunelleschi, schooled in practical geometry, thus had a leg up in the understanding of other related fields, the demonstration of which could not have been as resistant to comprehension as the data and arguments of modem optics or astronomy might be to a modern goldsmith or architect. The word "perspectiva" as it was used in the Middle Ages and the Early Renaissance was the translation of the Greek optike, from opsis, an appearance, aspect, or the power of sight, and it referred to the art of optics. Perspectiva was added to the quadrivium by certain writers of the late Middle Ages, an elevation in status that, together with its derivation from geometry, can only have made it more attractive to painters and writers bent on showing the liberality of painting. Perspectiva, as I have just argued, was a "subalternate" geometry, which framed its demonstrations of physical phenomena as geometric arguments, and we should probably understand what we call "perspective" in Renaissance painting to stand to perspectiva as perspectiva stands to geometry. That is, as optics is the more concrete case of geometry, la prospettiva dei pittori is optics adapted to the more specific purposes of painters. Geometry was said to argue with "pure" immaterial lines, optics with physical lines (rays of light). The optics of painters worked with more corporeal lines still; it was thus Alberti's "fatter Wisdom," the geometrical elements of which he likened to threads, cloths, and garlands. If this is so, then it is not necessary to suppose that perspective in Italian Renaissance painting was ever meant to be the construction of vision solely on the basis of the laws of optics, and it is significant from the standpoint of such a negative argument that in fact there are no real precedents for the one-point perspective construction to be found in medieval optical writers. What we call perspective was rather first and foremost a new skenographia-whether the stage painting or the architectural drawing for which Vitruvius used the same term-a persuasive fictive place before which memorable narratives (or histories) could also be persuasively enacted. The demand to depict events in such a way might be supposed to have preceded the</page><page sequence="3">498 THE ART BULLETIN SEPTEMBER 1991 VOLUME LXXIII NUMBER 3 "influence" of optics at the same time that painters on a broad front were rehabilitating the optical features of their own tradition, the modeling, highlights, foreshortened planes, and diagonal lines that provided a system of devices endlessly adaptable to narrative purposes. Although these devices are in a broad sense fundamen- tally optical, as mentioned above, the effect of Kemp's arguments is to cut painter's perspective off altogether from the immediate tradition of medieval perspectiva, and to me it seems plausible, even if 14th-century painters had their own solutions to the problems of the representation of interior spaces, and even if the diagonals of pre-Brunelleschian paintings may sometimes coincide like true orthogonals on a single point, that medieval optics still supplied one essential ingredient to the characteristically Renaissance construc- tion of space. This ingredient was an adequate theory of light. As the work of D.C. Lindberg and I.A. Sabra has made both clear and available to historians in other fields, modern optics began with the great Book of Optics of the Muslim scholar of the 10th-llth centuries called Alhazen by his Latin translators. The De aspectibus (as Alhazen's book was called in Latin) was translated by the early 13th century and provided the basis for the Western optics of Roger Bacon, Witelo, and John Pecham. Lorenzo Ghiberti knew Alhazen in an Italian translation and quoted extensively from the De aspectibus and the other authors drawing upon it in his Commentarii. It is to be noted that Ghiberti did not quote these writers to explain painter's perspective but rather to explain light, the act of vision, the general judgment of size and distance, and the circumstances under which forms might be seen. The optics of Alhazen combined classical geometric optics, the Galenic version of the physiology of the eye, and a theory of light that in principle made possible a complete geometric description of the relation between the surfaces of the eye and the world before it. According to this theory, every point of the surface of every body in light multiplies an infinite number of noninterfering rays in all directions of the space before it. We do not see all of these rays at once, rather only those registering as they strike the surface of the eye at points perpendicular to lines tangent through points on its convex surface. Thus the shape and position of the surfaces of the eye determine the way in which objects in lighted space are seen. This definition of light itself gave new meaning to the visual pyramid of optics and to the more general principle of the similarity of triangles for the simple reason that it meant that the world comes to the eye as a bundle of rays any section through which is similar, that is, proportional, to any other. The geometrization of light itself, in other words, provided the basis for two of the distinguishing features of 15th-century perspective in comparison to its medieval forerunners, namely isometry and proportionality. The tiled floors and coffered ceilings of the scenographic paintings of the 14th century could become the proportional modules of the 15th, and it was possible to subject a whole virtual space to uniform measure at the same time that it was described as visible. The same module-in principle if not always in practice-also governs the construction of figures and thus implicitly defines the precise relation of viewer to painting, the diminution of transversals, and the single stationary vanishing point of the viewer. Thus, if a fundamental principle of optics may have been grafted to painting's own scenographic formats, this crucial intervention of then-new medieval optics might explain some of the important differences between late medieval and Renaissance painting. At the same time, by grounding it in optics, and therefore in the geometry of light, this intervention made painting (or the "science of art") continuous at the deepest level with important aspects of the rising modern natural sciences in ways it could not have been before. Alhazen's theory of light was duly recounted by Lorenzo Ghiberti and given great importance by Leonardo da Vinci. At the beginning of the Codex Urbinas it is called "the first principle of the science of painting," which, more geometrico, follows a list of Euclidean defini- tions of point, line, and surface reminiscent of the beginning of Alberti's treatise on painting. Leonardo's "first principle" is a paraphrase of Alhazen's own summary of the discussion of light with which his optics begins (I. 14): "From any body illuminated by any light, light goes out before it in every direction. When, therefore, the organ of sight is opposite a visible thing and that thing is illuminated by any light, light will come to the surface of the eye from the light of the thing seen." The transcription of Leonardo's text is illustrated by two facing planes, accompanied by an argument to the effect that from any point on one plane all points on the other plane are visible. This diagram in turn is in effect a shorthand version of Brunelles- chi's first perspective panel of the Florentine Baptistery as described by Antonio Manetti. If this connection is not incidental, then Brunelleschi would have been demonstrating Alhazen's principle, or better, he would have been demonstrating that because of Alhazen's principle, he could insert a visual angle into measured drawings and, by taking a section through this angle, make a virtual image at once proportional to what was seen from the position corresponding to the apex of the visual angle in the measured drawings, an image true as the reflection in a plane mirror is true, and equivalent to the image on the surface of the eye because made up of the same set of points. If the principle that light is geometrically describable is basic to one-point perspective construction, it must be stressed that the further assumption that the construction-and therefore painting- is, or should be, radically optical, seems to have formed after the Renaissance. It was, moreover, recognized very early on that perspective construction only works under certain conditions, that it quickly becomes anamorphic, and that, while its powers of illusion are clearly to be admired, it is also irremediably artificial. Consistent with this awareness, the uses to which perspective was put remained to my mind fundamentally scenographic, and, in line with such an understanding, it may be supposed that Alberti presented the construction (which he did not call "perspective") in the first book of his treatise on painting because, in addition to grounding the art in geometry, this order established a prior framework of perspicuitas, that clarity of organization and outline recommended by the rhetoricians, in this case providing the clear and persuasive stage for the historia. Medieval writers on optics resisted the notion that the image in the eye is inverted. When, after Kepler, however, the view prevailed that the eye is like a camera obscura, and that the image registered on its surfaces is in fact upside down, it became increasingly necessary to explain how it is that we see things right side up. Moreover, when it came to be believed that the consequences of the action of external things upon the sense of sight bear an indexical rather than an iconic relation to their causes-which became the scientific view at least after Descartes-then it became necessary to explain how we make sense of visual sensation taken altogether. In the stimulating and suggestive fifth chapter of his book, Kemp treats the increasing subversion of the authority of perspective by the advance, diffusion, and assimilation of optics itself, a subversion that leads to problems peculiar to modernity. If optics had made it impossible to consider the image in the eye to be a simple reflection of the world, then there were two alternatives. The first, which Kemp calls "empiricist" and exemplifies by John Locke, held that our cumulative spatial experience comes to provide the basis for our ability to read the indexical patches of pure vision; the second, which Kemp calls "nativist," and which he exemplifies by Thomas Reid, took the position that the mind itself completes perception according to its own innate structures. One way or another, the status of perspective is called into fundamental question. From the empiricist point of view, the structure we give to our visual experience is based upon a deeper and more mysterious phenome- nology of the spatiality of our own changing bodies; from the nativist point of view, it is necessary to explain the faculties of the mind that represent the world to us and that are themselves revealed in that representation. The most radical and influential nativist was Immanuel Kant, who elaborated his solution to the problem of the noniconicity of sensation into a system of transcen- dental idealism, at the very base of which the "productive imagination" "represents" the world to us as spatio-temporal. In works such as Peter Schmid's Das Naturzeichnen, first published in 1828, the study of perspective had become the training of that imaginative faculty by means of which we make the world three- dimensionally meaningful. (Such ideas, by the way, both empiricist</page><page sequence="4">BOOK REVIEWS 499 and nativist, are of interest to historiographers of art history as the lineal ancestors of Adolf Hildebrandt's Das Formproblem, and of the linear-painterly, haptic-optic dualities of Wolfflin and Riegl, or the tactile values of Bernard Berenson.) In any case, perspective no longer corresponds to a primary intuition. As the modern split between art and science developed in the 18th century, and became philosophically institutionalized in the new discipline of aesthetics, which defined art as prerational, the newly emergent "fine arts" moved more and more toward the exploration of the pre- and nonspatial forces shaping our representation of the world and thus toward the exploration of the foundation of subjectivity. It is against this backdrop, an unanticipatable but equally deep and broad consequence of the rise of modern science, that writers of the 19th and 20th centuries have been so unhappy with perspective. Considering the work that continues to be done by the example of perspective in general cultural criticism, it is remarkable that it has been as little the object of historical analysis as it has. The studies of Martin Jay have examined the toppling of vision from the pinnacle of the senses and the consequences of this in modern writers, and something comparable may now be done for perspective, or for the problem of spatial representation. The rejection of perspective, after all, was one of the first articles of artistic modernism, and at least from Bergson's characterization of spatialization as a deathly crystalline illusion of rationality spread over a deeper, living, temporal reality, perspective has served as a negative paradigm, an ominous "symbolic form" (as it was in Panofsky's famous essay), a first exhibit of anthropocracy and the rise of the calculating bourgeoisie; a source of alienation and relativism; a product of instrumental reason and the technologization of the world; and a device of theatricality, the male gaze, the Cartesian cogito, the centered ego, and many other centrisms-all perhaps to be summed up in Foucault's lugubrious account of Jeremy Bentham's Panopti- con as a paradigm of peculiarly modern relations of power and powerlessness. Kemp's history of pictorial perspective from its first definition to modern times is an invaluable contribution to the historically more concrete investigation of such broader problems of interpretation. The last third of the book is devoted to color theory. Between the Renaissance and the late 19th century, color theory generally moved from the dominance of the Aristotelian to the dominance of the Newtonian. The Aristotelian schematization of color was prima- rily determined by value, and "the Philosopher" and his many followers arranged hues between the extremes of black and white, blue being closer to black, yellow to white, other colors falling in some order between these two. Since for Aristotle, light was the condition under which vision may occur and darkness is its opposite, any color might be regarded as a mean between these extremes and the status of white and black as colors was moot. Still, the primacy of value in the Aristotelian scheme is clear, as it is also clear that the scheme generally corresponds to the organization of color by the deeper framework of value in European painting from the system- atic rilievo of Cavallini and Giotto and the tonal underpainting of early Flemish painting through 19th-century realism. The tonal ground that predominated in painting after Leonardo da Vinci is a refinement of the same scheme, in which the ground color stands for any color to be put over it as a mean between black and white (or at any rate between uniform tonal extremes), between value con- trasts that themselves became primary objects of composition in chiaroscuro composition. To me it defies the principle of Ockam's razor not to draw the inference that this pictorial schematization of light, dark, color, and sight in general was Aristotelian in the first instance, acknowledging at once that it was adapted in myriad ways by any number of painters. So flexible and serviceable was this formula-Gombrich still writes of it as one of the "conditions of illusion"-and so deeply did it come to be installed in the assump- tions, practices, and techniques of painters and in the expectations of their audiences that the revolutionary formulations of Newton did not "demand the muse" of painting for well over a century, although it should be noted that when, after decades of assimilation and popularization, Newtonian color theory had become current and had begun to affect painting, the consequences were revolution- ary. An important compositional principle linking and underlying the application of both Aristotelian and Newtonian color theories had a long tradition outside the history of the science of optics, but may nonetheless be supposed to have shaped observation. This is the principle of "simultaneous contrast." This principle, primarily associated with Chevreul's De la Loi du contraste simultane des couleurs of 1839, had been stated earlier, perhaps first in The Natural System of Colours of Moses Harris of 1766, and Kemp (p. 276) finds the principle already enunciated by Leonardo da Vinci. Leonardo referred to contrasts of value, not of hue, however, and if his observations may have been optical, the scheme preceding the observation is compositional and more specifically rhetorical, and it has its precedent in Alberti's prescriptions for the ornamentation of the historia. The more general principle embracing the organization of optical elements was that all opposites heighten one another in directjuxtaposition (for example, young-old, female-male, near-far, as well as light-dark), and this was argued to be a fundamental part of pictorial composition, by which a maximally interesting and persuasive vividness is to be achieved, just as the rhetorician or poet might use antitheses. Antithesis, of course, is itself a visual meta- phor, and chiaroscuro is a more specifically optical one, but an optical one sanctioned by the more general rhetorical purposes of painting. "Contrasts" became a basic recipe of neoclassical composi- tion from Alberti onward-Reynolds still criticized the Venetians for their "capricious composition, their violent and affected contrasts, whether of figures or of light and shadow," and it might be suggested that this scheme, which was so fundamental to pictorial construction, preceded the notion of complementary contrast, an idea that, if borne out by the experience of after-images, continued to exert a disproportionate influence in painting, influence that can only be explained by its earlier pictorial history. In any case, it oversimplifies the matter, and makes Leonardo too much a prophet of the modern scientific vision, to attribute to him the definition of simultaneous contrast. At the same time, it obscures the important ways in which the aims of optical painting were much more than optical, or that "optical" questions reach much more deeply into Western art-historical and art-critical issues than the bare history of optics itself allows to be seen. The scholarship on perspective (and color theory), which is vast, and, like all scholarship, rapidly growing, tends to be segregated, marginal with respect to the study of Renaissance art, more marginal still to the study of the art of later centuries. Neglect of such a culturally specific and structurally basic feature of so much Western art owes partly to our continuing acceptance of the mistaken notion that perspective is the same as optics, and that therefore it simply corresponds to vision, a naturalization of an artifical construction that seems to make it historically neutral (which of course conceals the continued acceptance of optical naturalism as a norm). At the same time, the post- 18th-century idea that art is "aesthetic," and science is not, allows us to disregard what we now consider to be the scientific component of works of art in favor of what we feel is truly artful about art. In tandem, these attitudes conceal the historical character of schemata for the representation of the visible world and further conceal their com- plex cultural and social affiliations. By making available this gener- ous and clear account of the histories of "optical themes in Western art," Martin Kemp has provided a solid basis for their further study and understanding. He has also provided access to the principles and problems that fueled the imaginations of Western artists through centuries of the highest accomplishment. His book is a major contribution to the future explanation and interpretation both of the poetry and of the purposes underlying that accomplish- ment by historians of art.
