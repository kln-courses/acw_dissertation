This volume contains the papers presented at a colloquium held in 1980 at the Warburg Institute with the aim of setting out and assess- ing the most recent scholarly research on the sources and interrelationships of the several medieval versions of the Secretum secretorum. Probably the most popular and widely diffused of the corpus of Aritotelian spuria, it is a sort of Mirror for Princes whose influence spread throughout the Middle East and North Africa from the tenth century or earlier, and was felt in Eastern and Western Europe, including Russia and Scandinavia, till as late as the seventeenth century, affecting the thinking of such luminaries as Roger Bacon and Albertus Magnus. All these versions ultimately go back to an Arabic Vorlage, the Sirr al-asrdr, which can be dated to A.D. 941 and allegedly was translated from Syriac by Yahya (or Yuh.anna) ibn al-Bitriq. In the first paper in this collec- tion, dealing with the formation and interpre- tation of the Arabic text, M. Grignaschi ana- lyses the various extant versions and forcibly argues for the priority in the genesis of the Sirr al-asrdr of the Siyasa al-'immiyya, which he attributes to Abu 'l-'Ala' Salim, the kSitib of the Umayyad caliph Hisham ibn 'Abd al-malik. The implications of this authorship are far-reaching in the context of the origins of Arabic prose writing and Grignaschi's thesis has subsequently been resumed and elaborated by J. D. Latham in The Cambridge history of Arabic literature. The next contribution by A. I. Spitzer on the place of the Hebrew version in the transmission of the Sirr al-asrdr presents an incisive critique of Gaster's published text and translation and makes a plea for a new critical text. The remaining four papers are devoted to the medieval European tradition. M. A. Manzalaoui investigates the textual methods and translation techniques of Philip- pus Tripolitanus. J. Monfrin surveys the French versions and their contribution to medieval French literature. W. F. Ryan analyses the Russian translation (made from a Hebrew version, but apparently not the text of Gaster) and its affect on Russian political thinking. C. B. Schmitt turns his attention to the last printed version of the Secretum secretorum, that of the Renaissance scholar Francesco Storella (1555). Finally, the doyen of medieval Aristotelian textual scholarship, Mlle. M.-Th. d'Alverny, provides a lucid mise en scene which skilfully knits together the scattered strands of the individual contribu- tions. All in all, this is a fascinating and engrossing book. Granted that the contribu- tors are obliged to admit that their labours are far from complete and that the most pressing need is for the collation and publication of the innumerable MS sources, their efforts provide an impressive example of collective scholarship and should offer a spur to all concerned with the transmission of Greek thought through Arabic to the West.

Introduc- tion, texte arabe, traduction, notes et index du vocabulaire. (Recherches [Beyrouth]. Nouvelle Serie: A. Langue Arabe et Pensee Islamique, Tome xiII.) xxiii, 373, 62 pp. [Arabic text]. Beyrouth: Dar el-Machriq Riditeurs, 1982 [pub. 1983]. The Arba'in had than of al-Nawawi (631/1233-676/1277) is probably the best known and most influential of secondary works of religious edification amongst Muslims. Printed editions of the matn or core of the badiths abound. But the non-Muslim might be forgiven for failing to appreciate the signifi- cance of the collection, attractive as it is, if he has not studied the sharh which accompa- nies it. Although it is extant in several eastern printings, Pouzet is the first Western scholar to attempt a critical edition of this important work. The result of his labours is indeed com- mendable, for, as Pouzet shows, the badiths were thoughtfully selected to enable al-Nawawi to present a carefully and methodically worked-out exposition of the fundamentals of the Islamic faith. In his introduction, the editor provides a meticulously researched study of the life and achievements of a Muslim scholar who, naive and unoriginal as he may have been (and that largely in keeping with the spirit of his time), nevertheless had suffi- cient confidence in his Shafi'i convictions to pronounce against unjust actions of the Mamluk ruler Baybars on at least two occa- sions. Pouzet discusses with patent sympathy the known events of al-Nawawi's short life centred on Damascus, his teachers and models, the works which influenced his intellectual development, and his own literary output, before subjecting the arba'un genre to a fascinating historical and formal analysis. The translation of the Sharh is carefully annotated, and the glossary, which excludes only such words as kdna and the commoner pronouns and particles, sets a fine example for the future editing of Arabic texts as well as highlighting the mental preoccupations of the author. This book is perhaps not epoch-making in terms of furthering Islamic scholarship, but it has been splendidly produced and is to be welcomed as a true appreciation of al-Nawawi's influential little work. A. K. IRVINE VICTOR E. MAKARI: Ibn Taymiyyah's ethics: the social factor. (American Academy of Religion. Academy Series, No. 34.) ix, 236 pp. Chico, Ca.: Scholars Press, 1983. $17.95. If there is any writer in the field of Islamic studies who has scarcely been acknowledged or objectively assessed by later generations for his enormous contribution, both in terms of literary legacy and community role, it is Ibn Taymiyya (661-726 A.H./1263-1328 A.D.). 348 REVIEWS</page><page sequence="2">REVIEWS Only a decade ago, a score of' serious ' Arabic works began to emerge, but with the exception of a few studies in French, mainly by Henri Laoust, there has hardly been a scholarly investigation into the methodology and doctrines of Ibn Taymiyya, particularly in English. Makari's work, therefore, is probably the first such study of the man, the theologian- jurist, and above all the ' consistent' theorist of Islamic ethics and founder of the principles of later Muslim reform movements. This book, published in an economical but unattractive typeface, was originally presented as a Ph.D. thesis at Temple University, in 1975. There is no mention of any modification, major or otherwise, so one is bound to conclude that this is its original form and content. It contains an introduction and ten chapters distributed unevenly within four parts, followed by notes to the chapters and an impressive bibliography, of which 62 entries are primary works by Ibn Taymiyya himself, 6 are translations or com- mentaries on his works, 5 are critiques of his doctrines and methods and the remaining 65 are secondary sources, the majority of which are again in Arabic. The brief introduction which sets out the methodology, and is followed by Part 1 (two chapters, pp. 1-29), traces the origins of the spirit and thought of the Islamic reform move- ments beyond the 'traditional ' horizon, namely, Muslim reaction to external enemies (Napoleonic invasions), back to the much deeper roots of such movements (e.g., the im- pact of the Crusaders on the Muslim Umma, which received its final blow at the hands of the Mongol Turks), and back also to internal 'enemies', whose passivity and wrangles facilitated the weakening and the disintegra- tion of the Umma. The method of investigation is claimed to be 'historical and ideational ', beginning with the historical developments and the general back- ground of the political and social (including religious) life of the Muslim community up to the time of Ibn Taymiyya (ch. i), and proceed- ing to a biographical account of Ibn Taymiyya (ch. ii) which leads into a discussion of his doc- trinal ideas on related topics and issues selected from his works (Parts 2 and 3, comprising 7 chapters, pp. 33-173). These topics involve theology and law, politics and 'economics', as well as social ideology, response to Revela- tion and its media, Muslim brotherhood and solidarity, etc. The protagonists in each sphere, mainly theologians, philosophers, STifis, and jurists, as well as the Shi'a, are introduced as appropriate and their doctrines and ideas are defined in relation to those of Ibn Taymiyya and his criticism of them. Causes and consequences of his activities in the fields of theology, juris- prudence and politics are also clarified. Part 4, in a single chapter (pp. 177-93), presents a summary and conclusion. Within the terms of a review it would be difficult to do justice to both the theories and doctrines of Ibn Taymiyya as analysed here, but they may be presented generally as follows. The kernel of Ibn Taymiyya's thought is the conviction of the oneness and uniqueness of God (whether in His attributes or in their relation to 349 His essence), and the preservation and applica- tion of that conviction in faith and action. This goes together with an adherence to and safe- guarding of God's revealed pattern for human conduct, be it individual, or as a member of the Muslim community, or as a subject or function- ary of the state. In essence, this is the absolute dissimilarity of God and man and the latter's total submission to God alone: al-Tawhid wa ikhlds al-'ibdda li-lldh. Hence, anything relat- ing to the nature and character of God, whether positive or negative-ithbdt aw nafy- mentioned in the Qur'an or by the authentic Prophetic Traditions (Revelation), must al- ways and unalterably be attributed to Him (bild ta'wil wald ta't)l), without trace of figura- tion (tashbih or tamthal), anthropomorphism (tajsim), or neutralization (ta'til), and with absolute transcendence (tanzih). This convic- tion must be maintained equally with regard to all God's attributes, such as His will, His speech, His eternity, etc., which are all in- separable from His essence and co-eternal with Him. Conversely, any attribute of the nature or character of God, whether positive or nega- tive, outside Revelation must not be ascribed to Him; for no one can ever know the essence or nature and character of God but God him- self. To reflect beyond that is not only to seek to know the unknowable but also to try consciously or unconsciously to create god(s) other than Allah. Both the nature and charac- ter of God, together with His pattern for human conduct, are clearly embodied in His Revela- tion, the Qur'an, exemplified and demonstrated by His Prophet and put into effect by the early Muslim generations, who fully understood the Revelation. The ethical counterpart of the doctrine of God's oneness and uniqueness is the oneness and uniqueness of the Muslim community, which meant in practice the application of what Muslims believed and understood about the one God in the expression of the nature and purpose of their community, which was a singleness of calling and a singleness of aim to do God's revealed will. Hence, the everyday conduct and social interaction of Muslims and the state must be firmly and unequivocally grounded in the oneness of God, who is not only the Creator of all things that are, unique in everything, but is also Supreme Ruler, Law- giver, Source of supreme justice and of infinite mercy. Thus, the Revelation is the only 'constitution' which is to be protected and uncompromisingly applied, and in which salva- tion lies. This Revelation is communicative, self-interpretive and may be approached both with certain belief and with true rational inquiry, including the proper use of analogy (qiyds) within the framework of the Muslim consensus (ijmd'). Hence, neither the jurist nor the theologian, neither the leader (al-imdm) nor his agent has a binding authority in what is lawful or unlawful; only the Qur'an and the Sunna enjoy that status. Ijtihdd can and should be exercised in matters of conduct, as opposed to theological speculation, whenever necessary, by those who have full knowledge of Revelation and its circumstances, which in- clude the occasions of Revelation (asbdb al-nuzil), the Arabic language, and the</page><page sequence="3">opinions of the early generations of the Muslim community. Makari rightly assesses such a position as being unmistakably fundamentalistic (Han- bali). Nevertheless, he considers Ibn Taymiyya to be a basis of common, permanent standards for existing conditions, at the same time reformist, ' adapting and adopting' anything which does not infringe the oneness and uniqueness of God and total submission to His revealed laws. Thus, unlike the rigorous Hanbalis, he welcomed and used rational methods, but at the same time insisted on deductive methodology, depending primarily on Revelation, rather than relying primarily or wholly on an inductive methodology, such as that of the philosophers. Often, for instance, he was able to step outside his affiliation to the Hanbali madhhab when intellectual integrity required him to do so. His intellectual ability is here assessed for the way that, forced by the very methods of his adversaries in any con- troversy, he successfully used the Qur'an and the Sunna first, without forsaking his atavistic attitude, and at the same time was able to introduce the changes necessary for a 'dyna- mic ' Islam. He accepted, for instance, the existence of a confederation of Muslim states rather than insisting on the ideal of one Islamic State. He equally strove to restore an open, healthy Islam against the doctrinal and social phenomena of legalism, esotericism, mysticism and, above all, blind dogmatism. In short, 'his entire system of thought seems to have been so socially oriented and consistent that every realm of his intellect in theology, law and demonstrative activity was aimed at more lasting social change within the so- vereignty of the one and unique God of Islam '. Within this lies his major contribution not only in reassessing Islamic values afresh, but also in laying foundations for later movements. However, despite the fact that the biblio- graphy contains at least five critiques of Ibn Taymiyya's doctrines and methods, there is no discussion of post-Ibn Taymiyya criticism. Consequently, perhaps, the author often ap- pears to be apologetic or subjective whenever there is inconsistency between a general prin- ciple of Ibn Taymiyya and a specific example given by Ibn Taymiyya himself, though it is worth mentioning that such occasions are very few indeed. For instance, Ibn Taymiyya accepts and defends the maxim 'Leadership belongs to Quraysh ', yet he supports the doc- trine of competence for leadership irrespective of blood origin. He equally maintains and defends the superiority of the Arabs, a common theme in the Hadith literature, yet he accepts and defends the doctrine of piety as the only criterion for superiority, mentioned by the Qur'an. Similarly, Ibn Taymiyya's rigorous adherence to the Revelation pattern with regard to God's attributes and his doctrine of ' the affirmation of the particular and negation of the general' (-ithbdt al-mufassal wa -nafy al-mujmal) on the basis of the concept of divine incomparability (as opposed to the methodology of the Muslim philosophers in dealing with the problem of divine transcen- dence, namely, affirmation of the general coupled with the negation of the particular) hardly has a supportive Qur'anic text. The very Surat al-Ikhlds, which Ibn Taymiyya takes as the point of departure for his theologi- cal arguments is contrary to this doctrine and is more in line with the doctrine of his oppo- nents. Nevertheless, this work is not only the first significant and serious contribution to the subject in English, but is also an impressive analysis and assessment of the doctrines and theories of Ibn Taymiyya, conducted mainly from original sources. It will be of great help to students of Islamic studies, particularly those who have no access to the original works and yet are interested in the reform move- ments which at present are in upsurge. A. A. M. SHEREEF JOHN OSBERT VOLL: Islam: continuity and change in the modern world. [xiii], 397 pp. Boulder, Colorado: West- view Press; Harlow, Essex: Long- man, 1982. The political manifestations of militant Islam which were so prominent in the 1970s stirred academic establishments in Europe and America to organize conferences which in turn led to a number of publications of collected papers on various aspects of the so-called Resurgence of Islam. Monographs seeking to present a sustained analysis of these events have been slower to appear, but on the whole, the recent examples by H. Enayet or E. Morti- mer provide an experience for the reader which is at once more satisfying and more challeng- ing. Although composite volumes will inevit- ably offer greater depth of regional expertise on the world of Islam, they cannot compete with the cohesion in approach and perspective pro- vided by the monograph which offers a con- vincing thesis sustained by sound evidence. This contribution by Voll to the discussion of the modern history of Islam has the advantages of the synthesizing view of the individual scholar applied to a range of material which verges on the encyclopedic. The chronological scope of this book extends from the Revival and Reform Movements in the eighteenth century to the period of Islamic Resurgence in the 1970s and 1980s, and in evaluating the dramatic events which have marked the beginning of the fifteenth Islamic century, the author insists, quite rightly, on a strong sense of historical perspective: the period of Western domination in the world of Islam which occurred between the eighteenth century and the 1970s is but one episode in the long-term experience of Muslim peoples. The processes of defeat, secular reformism, and national emancipation, which have taken place over the last two centuries did not destroy the underlying continuities of Islamic societies. The significance of the eighteenth century was that it witnessed attempts at Islamic re-definition which were both funda- mentalist and pre-imperialist, thus lending the legitimacy of pre-imperial development to Muslim fundamentalism today. Thus the fundamentalist style was firmly established long before it was called upon to oppose 350 REVIEWS</page></plain_text>
