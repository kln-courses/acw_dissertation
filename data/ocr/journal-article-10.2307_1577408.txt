<plain_text><page sequence="1">ELI IIAU I I] U Ii (UN [SJM 1W Section Editor: Louise Poissant Leonardo Editorial Advisor The New Media Dictionary project [1] was born out of the desire to name and define the many and varied forms of art that have devel- oped in conjunction with technology. A whole lexicon is being created to describe the many processes, techniques, instruments, and critical and aesthetic concepts-in short, the entire emerging culture-of this immense laboratory workshop. The terms selected for this issue come from the field of Telematics. The terms and definitions have been chosen by the Groupe de recherche en arts mediatiques (GRAM). Interested artists and researchers are invited to submit additions and comments to Section Editor Louise Poissant [2]. These contribu- tions will be added to the electronic version of the dictionary, with credit to the author In this way, the New Media Dictionary will gradually become a collective project, in which each significant contribution will find its place. These definitions were prepared by Suzanne Leblanc. Project director: Louise Poissant. Translator: Lou Nelson. DICTIONARY TERMS-PART VI: TELEMATICS ACTIVATION-An act by a user working with a graphical user interface (GUI) that produces a specific response within the interface. The activation occurs when the user presses a key on the keyboard or clicks the mouse. The result may be the open- ing of a window or menu, or the execution of a hyperlink. AESTHETICS OF COMMUNICATION-An approach to art that consid- ers art an act of communication between humans. The ex- pression was introduced in 1982 by Fred Forest and Mario Costa to describe art that focuses on relationships rather than on objects, on promoting human interaction rather than the process or the medium and on integrating commu- nication technologies currently used in society. This approach to art is a natural extension of art sociologique, as formulated by Fred Forest along with Herve Fischer and Jean-Paul Thenot in 1974. AGENT-A software entity that can perform various tasks within a multimedia or virtual-reality program with relatively little user input. The tasks are those that it makes sense to automate, such as retrieving information from a database or the Internet, or offering a selection of profiles for user- specific guided tours of a hypermedia program. Agents can also be used for role-playing, where they may be characters in an interactive story or scene; this function is similar to that of a soft actor. Agents are often anthropomorphic, designed with the culture and expectations of users in mind, and are given features and characteristics that seem appropriate to their functions. The idea of agents was introduced in the 1950s byJohn McCarthy of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. His concept was further defined and developed by Oliver G. Selfridge, also of MIT. In the early 1990s, Brenda Laurel made agents one of the basic concepts of her theory of human-computer interaction. ANcHOR-The active element in a hypertext or hypermedia node; the location of a link, but not the destination to which it connects. The anchor is usually a word or series of words set off from the text by its color or appearance. In hyper- media, the anchor may also be an image or a sound. The terms anchor and button are almost synonymous. In systems where both concepts are used, they are distinguished by the fact that the button usually includes a directional indicator. AsYNCHRONOUS TRANSMISSION-A transmission method in which data is sent one character at a time, each character being preceded by a start bit and followed by a stop bit. Asynchro- nous transmission, also called "start-stop synchronization," is the simplest way of synchronizing data flow between comput- ers where the timing of these computers is not controlled by the same clock signal. AUDIOCONFERENCE-A teleconference in which participants are connected by telephone circuits that transmit speech and sound. AUTHORING SYSTEM-Software used to create hypertext or hypermedia programs. This type of software includes a set of tools for importing, processing or generating various types of data (text, visual or sound) to be included in the hyperdocu- ment (for example, graphics, animation and editing tools), as well as for creating the structure of the hyperdocument itself (nodes and links) and its GUI (node format, types of buttons activating the links, etc.). Some authoring systems allow the programmer to use a programming language to define the hyperdocument's various functions. These pro- gramming languages are usually scripting languages (e.g. HyperCard and Macromedia Director). AVATAR-A representation of the user in a virtual environ- ment. This representation may mirror the user's actual char- acteristics to a greater or lesser extent. Especially when interacting with other users, the user may wish to create an avatar designed to achieve specific interaction objectives rather than to depict reality. BACKDROP-An unchanging or stationary part of a graphical interface in an interactive multimedia system or of an environ- ment in a virtual reality system. In the former case, the back- drop provides a base for the construction of a complex and changing image built of superimposed planes, forming, among other things, visual representations of the system's interactive functions. In the latter case, the backdrop provides the basic structure and visual boundary of the virtual environment. BACKACKnc-A software tool used in hypertext and hypermedia that allows the user to retrace the pathway taken to his or her current position. LEONARDO, Vol. 35, No. 4, pp. 439-443, 2002 ? 2002 ISAST</page><page sequence="2">BANDWIDTH-The range of frequencies determining the data transmission capacity of a communications channel. BRANCHINc-A part of a flowchart for a hypertext or hyper- media program, representing a point where the user must choose among the options available before continuing. See also node, decision point. BROADBAND-A high-capacity data transmission channel, generally using coaxial or fiber-optic cable. BROWsING-Movement through a hypertext or hypermedia program by a user. Browsing differs from navigation, the relatively directed movement through a hyperdocument. Bus-A bundle of parallel conductors in the architecture of a computer to which the various components-memory, input- output devices, etc.-are connected. See also network topology. CELLULAR RADIO NETWORK-A computerized wireless communi- cations network consisting of radio transmitters circulating in a territory divided into "cells." Each cell has a low-power antenna that transmits only within its boundaries. The net- work is managed by a computerized central switching system, capable of switching a signal from one antenna to another as the transmitter moves from one cell to another in the terri- tory. Digital radio transmitters also use data compression. Also called a cell-net. CYBERNAUT-A person who "travels" in cyberspace. This neol- ogism was formed from the words cyberspace and astronaut. CYBERPUNK-An aesthetic movement that began in the 1980s, combining cyberspace technologies with underground culture. CYBERSPACE-The total environment formed by the continu- ous electronic circulation of data, including everything from the internal circuits of computer processors to global telecommunications networks. The term was introduced in 1984 by William Gibson of Canada in his science-fiction novel Neuromancer to designate "a consensual hallucination experienced daily by billions of legitimate operators." CYBORG-The term is short for cybernetic organism. It was first used in science fiction to designate beings that are part human, part machine. DATA SUPERHIGHWAY-The worldwide computer telecommuni- cations network. The concept of a data or information su- perhighway is based on the idea that the circulation of information will be to the 21st century what the development of transportation networks was to the 20th and will produce a similar degree of profound socio-economic change. The term is associated with the High Performance Computing Act, introduced by U.S. Senator Al Gore in the early 1990s. DECISION PoiNT-An element in a hypertext, hypermedia or virtual reality program that requires the user to choose among different options. DELTA MODLATION-Pulse code modulation using only one bit per sample. DowNLK/UPuINK-The path taken by the radio signal linking a satellite to a station on Earth. A downlink is from the satel- lite to the station; an uplink is from the station to the satel- lite. DOWNLOAD/UPLOAD-The transfer of data from a server to a client computer (download) or from a client computer to a server (upload), or from one personal computer to another, which are linked by a more or less large and complex net- work. These terms are also commonly used to refer to trans- fer from a network to a PC (download) or from a PC to a network (upload). DUPLEX NETWORK-A data transmission network in which the messages routed from node to node can move in both direc- tions. In a half-duplex network (semi-bidirectionnel), data trav- els alternately in one direction, then in the other, while in a full-duplex network (completement bidirectionnel), data can travel in both directions simultaneously. THE EDGE-A cyberpunk concept designating the limiting and marginal conditions in which the cultural mutations of a society develop. FLOWCHART-The schematic representation of the main oper- ations and sequences of operations in a system. FULLtDUPLE-See duplex network. GoPHEm-A client/server system developed at the University of Minnesota (1991) and used to search for data on the Internet. The Gopher is a navigation tool that facilitates searches by using a hierarchical classification system some- what like a directory structure. It provides access to text, sound or image files. HACKER-A computer enthusiast who can apply his or her specialized knowledge to get results that go beyond or are different from the results obtained by normal procedures. HIERARCHICAL NETWORK-A data transmission network that includes at least two levels of switching, with the lower levels depending on the higher levels to route messages to the proper destination. HOST-A computer that functions as a server for a network of client computers. HYPERCARD-An authoring system created by Bill Atkinson in 1986 for the Macintosh platform. The GUI for the Hyper- Card system is based on the idea of cards (corresponding to a hypertext or hypermedia node), stacks (groups of nodes that can be navigated) and buttons (which trigger a jump from one place to another in a stack, make a pop-up window appear, etc.). Each card consists of a backdrop containing all the data shared by cards in the same stack, along with a num- ber of image planes and a foreground that contain the data specific to that card. Short programs written in the Hyper- Talk scripting language are attached to each button to tell the system what to do when the button is activated. HYPERDvocuME-A document in hypertext or hypermedia. HYPERGRAM-An image containing elements or zones that can be activated by the user in a GUI. When the user activates one of these elements or zones, the system will respond, by, for example, revealing hidden parts of the image, displaying 440 New Media Dictionary</page><page sequence="3">text, making sounds or even calling up a new image. The idea of hypergrams was introduced in 1974 by Ted Nelson. HYPERUNK-See link. HYPERMAP--A map based on the navigation and interaction principles of hypermedia. A hypermap includes elements or zones that when activated move the user to another part of the map or change the scale. HYPERMEDA-See "New Media Dictionary Part I," Leonardo 33, No. 2 (2000). HYPERTALK-A scripting language used in the HyperCard authoring system. HYvPErix'-An interactive computer program consisting of a non-linear text-linking structure composed of nodes and links between nodes, with operations that allow the user to move within the structure. The nodes are blocks of text, parts of which (pointers or buttons) can be activated to jump to other blocks of text or to open windows that contain brief comments. These other text blocks and windows may also contain areas that can be activated and lead to other nodes and so on. The network of links that makes up the structure can be expanded in number and in complexity. The process in which a user accesses hypertext nodes by moving through the network of links is called navigation or browsing, depend- ing on the degree of organization of the exploration. The origins and structure of hypertext also apply to hypermedia. HYPERaEXT MARKUP LANGUAGE (HTML)-A markup language used for the World Wide Web to code hypertext links be- tween different content pages. It can also encode character, page and text-formatting information. HYPEiTEXTi TsANsFR PROTOCOL (H1'1'P)-A protocol governing the transactions among all the servers that make up the World Wide Web. INTERACTWE MovIE-A movie in which viewers can influence how the narrative unfolds. At key points, the narrative di- vides into a number of branches, and it is up to the viewers to decide what happens next. Decisions can be made collec- tively in special cinemas where the viewers' seats have con- trols linked to a computer that tabulates the votes cast and chooses the story line selected by the majority of viewers. In some interactive movies, the narrative is set, but parallel story lines show the action from the viewpoints of different characters. Viewers can choose which character's viewpoint they wish to follow. The idea for interactive movies came from computer-based interactive fiction, developed in the mid-1970s, which was itself inspired by games like Dun- geons and Dragons (created in the United States in 1974 by Dave Arneson and Gary Gygax), in which correctly negoti- ating a series of branching options would lead the user to a reward. INTERNET-The largest computer communications network in the world. The Internet consists of many smaller intercon- nected networks that link all kinds of private and public organizations and institutions and is used by individuals to communicate with each other. Internet access is also pro- vided by specialized private companies called Internet ser- vice providers (ISPs). The Internet grew out of the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPANET) project, led by the U.S. Department of Defense in the 1970s. Set up in the 1980s under the auspices of the National Science Foundation to enable university researchers to communicate with each other and with the country's few supercomputers, the Internet subsequently expanded to include the entire world. INTERNET RELAY CHAT (IRC)-A network communications system in which a number of users type in and exchange real- time messages. Participants congregate in different chat rooms according to their areas of interest. JuMP-(1) A direct move from the anchor to the destination of a hypertext or hypermedia link; (2) an instruction to move from one part of a computer program to another, in the form of a conditional statement. LINK-A connection between part of one node and a differ- ent node in a hypertext or hypermedia document. The first term of the connection is the link source, or anchor, and the second is the destination. Generally speaking, there are two types of links. One type includes links set by the system it- self-for example the connection between a word in a node and its definition in a dictionary included in the hyperdocu- ment. The second type includes links created by the hyper- document author-for example the connection between a word or part of an image in one node and a different node that is related to it in some way-a connection designed as a jump and programmable as a "GOTO" statement. Links can also be either specific-for example, the relationship be- tween a word or part of an image and a window containing related notes-or organized into various structures, hierar- chical or otherwise, that reflect the overall conceptual rela- tionships among the hyperdocument nodes. In the absence of this type of structure and an overall vision on the part of the hyperdocument programmer, the wholesale linking of nodes can result in a kind of spaghetti, which ultimately confuses the user. There is also a distinction to be made between open links, where the destination leads to new links-for example, from a table of contents to a section of a document and then to the related subsections-and closed links, where the destination can only lead back to the an- chor-for example, a pop-up note or explanation. Links provide the means to navigate through a hyperdocument and, with nodes, constitute the two fundamental units that determine its structure. They are also called hyperlinks. MODEM-An abbreviation of modulator-demodulator. These devices enable computers to communicate over telephone lines by converting digital signals to analog and vice versa. The flow of digital data from the computer is modulated so that it can be transmitted over a telephone line, and the analog signals produced by the telephone system are demodu- lated to be read by the destination computer. MODULE-See node. MuLTIzMDIA-See "New Media Dictionary Part I," Leonardo 33, No. 2 (2000). MULn-PLATFoRM-A designation of software that can run on different kinds of computers using different operating sys- tems. IBM and Macintosh are examples of two types of com- puters that use different operating systems: DOS and New Media Dictionary 441</page><page sequence="4">Windows, for example, in the former and one of the many versions of the Macintosh operating system in the latter. MuLTIPLEXINc-A technique in which multiple transmissions are sent along the same cable. In multiplexing, the bandwidth is divided either into subchannels that are used simultaneously by the transmissions (frequency-division multiplexing) or into different time slots used successively and alternately by the transmissions (time-division multiplexing). NAVIGATION-The process of moving through a hypertext or hypermedia program. This involves exploring the dataspace of a hyperdocument by following the links to the nodes that make up the content. Navigation is generally more struc- tured than browsing. More specifically, navigation tools pro- vide maps that show the main nodes and hyperlinks, or that indicate the user's position within either the hyperdocument as a whole or a particular section of it. Navigation also makes use of tracking software that allows users to retrace their steps (backtrack) or view a list of their previous steps (or "history"), as well as "bookmark" information for future reference. Users may also go on "tours" in some hyperdocu- ments, which offer a number of different pathways based on various user profiles or areas of interest. Recent develop- ments in navigation allow for the use of agents, complex software entities that can perform a variety of searches for users based on their specific needs. Communications net- works such as the World Wide Web present a special case of hyperdocument navigation; in effect, each Web site is compa- rable to a node, in that it can contain a number of links to and from other sites. Movement through computer-generated environments such as those created by virtual-reality systems can also be considered a kind of navigation. And lastly, the term navigation can be used in a broader sense to include retrieving information from a database. In this case, a num- ber of computer operations are involved, such as searching for a character string or consulting menus, operations that can also be used to navigate a hyperdocument. NETWORKiTOPoLoGY-The structure of interconnections or the architecture of the nodes in a network. The topology of a network can be a ring (with links between nodes organized in a circle), a tree (with links that form branches), a bus (in which all links are attached to a single channel that carries all the signals) or a star (wherein links all connect to one central unit-that of a computer or telephone network, for example). NODE-The basic unit of information in a hypertext or hyper- media program. The node may include a block of text, a chart or diagram, a picture or sequence of pictures (ani- mated or video), a sound or series of sounds, or any combi- nation of these. A node can contain a number of anchors and be the destination of a number of links. Anchors are generally "hot spots" within a block of text or a picture, for example, that can be activated to jump to a different node. Nodes come in various basic forms, depending on the graph- ical interface (e.g. card, page, window or screen) of the authoring software used to create them. PACKET SITrCHIIN-A data transmission method whereby the original message is divided into units, called packets, which are then routed to a single destination. The size of each packet is determined by the network being used. Each packet from a single message is assigned the same destina- tion address, as well as a sequence number indicating its original position, so that the message can be correctly re- assembled at its destination. A "virtual circuit" is established to route the packets from node to node, using the optimum route given traffic conditions on the network. PROTOCOL-A set of standards for transmitting information over a telecommunications network. Protocols are usually defined by standards organizations, such as the Comit6 con- sultatif international telegraphique et t6elephonique (CCITT) and the International Organization for Standardization (ISO). PULSE CODE MODULATION-A technique for converting analog signals into digital signals. The analog signals are sampled and a digital value is assigned based on their amplitude. For telephone communications, the voice signal is sampled 8,000 times a second, and 8 bits are used to record the amplitude at each sample point. As a result, digital encoding of this type of signal requires 64 kilobits per second. REAITImE PROTOCOL (RTP)-A connection protocol for tele- phone conversations via the Internet. This protocol makes it possible to establish long-distance telephone communications that are not subject to the long-distance charges of traditional telephone systems. Also called Real-Time Transport Protocol. REMOTE SENSING-The use of satellites or other aerospace equipment to derive data, usually atmospheric or geological in nature, by means of remote observation. RING-See network topology. RoLE-PLAYING GAME--A game in which the players play differ- ent characters in a story. Role-playing games became popular in the United States in the mid-1970s with Dungeons and Dragons, an interactive story developed by Dave Arneson and Gary Gygax in the style ofJ.R.R. Tolkien's mid-1950s trilogy, The Lord of the Rings (published in French as Le Seigneur des anneaux). The story has a number of characters with very specific skills, who face a series of challenges in which their particular skills give them a greater or lesser advantage, depending on the situation. Similar games were available on computers in the late 1970s, but it was not until the 1990s that role-playing games such as W Industries' Leg- end Quest were installed in virtual-reality systems. SCRIPrING LANGUAGE-A high-level object-oriented program- ming language used in some authoring systems, e.g. Hyper- Talk, used in HyperCard systems, or Lingo, used in Macromedia Director systems. SENSENET-In cyberpunk terminology, a system of computer and telecommunications networks designed as an extension of the human nervous system. SIMPLEX NETWORK-A data transmission network in which messages are sent from node to node in one direction only. SLIP/PPP-Serial Line Internet Protocol/Point-to-Point Protocol, a combination of protocols that makes it possible to link a personal computer to the Internet via a modem. This system provides a connection between a home com- puter and the computer of an Internet service provider. The user can thus have Internet access without needing a connec- tion to a local area network that uses the TCP/IP standard. 442 New Media Dictionary</page><page sequence="5">SMILEY-In electronic mail, a series of punctuation marks that represent a smiling face, used to show that humor is intended. One reads them by tilting one's head, usually to the left. They typically consist of a colon, a hyphen and a closing parenthesis. Many other variations exist, notably with an opening parenthesis replacing the closing parenthesis to indicate a bad mood. These symbols are used to convey emotion in electronic messages. This sentence ends with a smiley, showing that the author is in a good mood :-) SoFT ACTOR-An anthropomorphic computer-generated image that plays a role in a multimedia or virtual-reality program. In some cases, the soft actor is linked to a real actor by a system that can generate image sequences from data recorded by a special device, such as a face tracker or a sen- sor mask. With such a device, the computer can track the morphological changes related to the changing facial expres- sions of the real actor playing the soft actor's role. Tracking devices can be extended to the hands or the entire body, or can be combined with other equipment (sliders, digital pedals, 3D mice) used to control the position and actions of the virtual actor in virtual space. This system is used both for animation and in real-time applications, with the real actor located offstage or even outside the performance space. STACK-A series of cards in hypertext or hypermedia software that uses the card as its basic form of node or module. STANDALONE-A feature of hypertext or of hypermedia pro- grams that allows them to run on any computer, regardless of the authoring system used to create them. This feature makes it easy to use hypertext and hypermedia programs in interactive kiosks. STAR-See network topology. SYNCHRONOUS TRANSMISSION-A transmission method in which data blocks are sent in a continuous stream, each block being preceded by a special clock signal used to synchronize the sending and receiving computers. TCP/IP-Transfer Control Protocol/Internet Protocol, a set of standards that enables computers to exchange informa- tion over the Internet. This protocol defines how messages are divided into data packets and addressed. TELXATIncART-See "New Media Dictionary Part I," Leonardo 33, No. 2 (2000). TEEMAIIC NoMAD--A person who uses portable computers and telecommunications equipment, such as cellular phones, to work in multiple locations. TELEMATIcs-Techniques and services for the processing and transmission of data, common to computer and telecommuni- cations fields in particular. The term teimatique was coined in France in 1978 by Alain Minc and Simon Nora in their report on the computerization of society (L'informatisation de la socite). TELEPORT-An installation that allows a group of private sub- scribers to access a number of telecommunications services, such as satellite communications and videoconferencing. TELEPRESENCE-(1) The remote operation of equipment in places that are inhospitable to humans. In this application, telepresence is used in combination with telerobotics. (2) The feeling of "being there" that occurs to users in vir- tual environments, whether in reproductions of real places or in completely imaginary contexts. TELEPUTER-A multimedia system combining the television and the computer, expected to be the eventual replacement of both. TELNET-Software that gives the user remote access to an- other computer for the purpose of directly using its resources. Files cannot be transferred during a Telnet ses- sion; file transfer is possible, however, during an FTP session. TRAIL-A series of links used and nodes traversed by a user navigating through a hypertext or hypermedia document. VIDEO GAME-An interactive game that can run on either a personal computer or a standalone console. The first video games were introduced in the United States in the early 1960s. VIRTUAL MUSEUM-An immersive or desktop virtual reality environment that reproduces the various objects in a mu- seum collection. Generally, the virtual museum re-creates each room in a real museum and provides ways for users to move around and through them. The individual objects are displayed, usually with explanatory text. VIRTUAL REAITY MODELING LANGUAGE (VRML)-A modeling language used to create virtual environments that can be accessed through the World Wide Web. WIRED ART-See "New Media Dictionary Part 1," Leonardo 33, No. 2 (2000). WIRELESS NETWORK-A communications network that uses infrared or radio waves so that data can be exchanged by mobile nodes. WORLD WIDE WEB-A network of networks integrated with the Internet, which uses a hypertext access protocol allowing the exchange of multimedia documents. A WWW file is known as a page. It is formatted using relatively simple coding (HTML) to mark keywords that provide direct access to other pages, which may be found on different computers. The World Wide Web provides access to a number of different Internet resources thanks to a standardized addressing system (URL). A special modeling language (VRML) allows users to visit virtual environments on the Web.
