<plain_text><page sequence="1">to Jerusalem BY JAKOV LIND For Francis Huxley O n April 23rd 1970, on a very fine day about three in the afternoon, standing under the pines behind the Mirador, my small summer home in D., I had a vision. The sea, the mountains, the trees, bushes, grasses, people, cars, are a total and my- self a particle within the total. It requires my consciousness yet needs nothing of the kind to perfect what is seemingly perfect. The words "I do not believe it" turned into their opposite and I became a new convert to God. I could no longer understand how I could ever have called myself an atheist. It sounded like "being insane." By seeing per- fection I began to see purpose, line and unity in all things. My eye- sight had improved suddenly and dramatically and I had witnessed a perfect beauty, harmony and peace in constant creation. I began to study the Bible, the few books I had with me on Jewish mysticism by Scholem, Philo of Alexandria, Maimonides' "Guide for the Per- plexed" and Evelyn Underhill, curious to hear about similar experi- ences of others. I try hard to understand why I should have had these strong, beatific sensations, but I think this might take too long to explain. My death fears increased a thousand times. I expected to die within hours and minutes. Maybe I had seen too much. I might have overstepped an unknown law that limits human perception. I would have called myself a mystic had anyone suggested it to me. I had a permanent sensation of light flowing through me while my body had become transparent. To prove, as it were, what I had witnessed: Mountains, trees, stones are perpetually changing, forming and reforming in endless labour. Friends began to feel that "there was something different" about me. I suddenly stopped hating any thing and anyone. How 59 The Antioch Review</page><page sequence="2">can I hate anyone if every "self" exists within a perfect totality? Without this awareness, how can I not suffer this existence as a bad joke? Without an all-mighty there is nothing, and this all- mighty is nothing but infinity. The creative part of this all-mighty, the masculine part, we refer to God by calling it HE. The feminine counterpart of this HE we term SHE, the perfect harmony and beauty creative energy produces before our very eyes. I To empty the mind may be a good first step, but afterwards the mind must be filled wvith concrete content. -Adin Steinsaltz B ack from D. in May 1970, my mind full of beatific visions, I went to see a friend, a famous doctor of the mind, R.D.L. I wanted L. to convince me that I had in fact lost my mind on God and was from now on a hopeless case whose mental health could only be restored by the passing of time; instead L. admitted that he himself had been reading "the Prodigal Son" to his patients more recently (more one could not do nowadays). By now, having had his "experience" a few years previously, he thought he had more or less adjusted himself to this "madness" and I, in time, would have to learn the same. (The doctor took his wife and children and went off to the Far East to meditate on his final answer and I came here in search of the spiritual Israel.) A s soon as the wheels of the plane touched the ground the old phobias came back: I wanted to take off instantly and go back to London where I can write and read words and not be confronted by facts. I have my own Jewish state of mind in my 60 Spring/ Summer 1972</page><page sequence="3">head, and it's no less vivid or less confusing than what's going on here. To come here is definitely a family affair. My two sisters waited for me at the exit and we immediately talked about the rest of the family. The first four days I spend mostly in a deck chair on the balcony of my younger sister's house on the Carmel, smelling, tasting, medi- tating. Reflecting. I watch the clouds sail by and count backwards into a mathematics that calls all things One. I am in this "One." I am here because I love this country. I am a lover who found the love of his life married. Maybe it has never been my country, yet I have always been in love with it, with the ideal with this pain in my bowels, with this fear when someone mentioned the word Jew. I am conditioned like Pavlov's dog to excrete some kind of mental saliva as soon as anyone mentions the word Jew, Israel, Yid, Jude, Jood, Dsjid, in whatever language or connection. And it's not only the word; it depends how it is pronounced and what is said and who says it. I grew up to hate anti-Semites with a hatred that could hardly be matched by their hatred for us. I didn't just hate them back be- cause they hated us. I hated them because they could think of hating us. Just like our family, we Jews were undoubtedly the very best people in the world. I was very militant minded, ready at any time to answer force by force. In our block of apartment houses in Vienna, in number 2 lived Walter K-6nig, the Hitler of the district. Whenever one of us children passed him, he shouted after us: "Stink- ing Jew! Rotten Jew! Drop dead Jew!" and that kind of thing. If he was alone he would never dare run after us, to tease us and throw things at us. Once he ran after my sister and pricked her with a needle. She screamed and was rescued by grown-ups. Walter Konig was my archenemy number one. I had many ideas on how to get hold of him and kill him. I would much rather have seen him dead than wait for what he was going to do to us, at night maybe, with a whole gang of them. My mother remembered Cossack pogroms, yet she herself was apparently helped by a Cossack (with whom she fell in love, that's how we figured it out) and rather warned me to be cautious and not to look for trouble. My sister tells me I used to go after Walter Konig and shout "stand up and fight" but he would run away (and so would I for that matter if he turned round and seemed ready for the fight). Alone, neither of us dared to beat the other; we needed friends. We could get at least eight Jewish boys together in our gang named after Leo Stern-the Stern gang- while Konig could mobilize ten times that number. Our strategic position was not very good either as we lived in different houses-in cases of emergency it took some time to get together and we could easily be cut off by the enemy trying to reach the next post. In the The Trip to Jerusalem 61 The Antioch Review</page><page sequence="4">long run the eight Jewish children had no chance of winning a battle against hundreds of Walter Konigs, thus it was fairly obvious that the Zionists were right and the Communists and others wrong. The Zionists said we have to have our own country and our own army to defend ourselves, while the Communists-socialists and others said we should help to re-educate the stupid kids who call us dirty names. It depends what kind of person you are. I, speaking for myself, was for fghting them and even killing them. I was no pacifist when it came to defending myself against a madman. Justice not mercy was my motto. Rather die like Bar Kochbah, Maccabee, Trumpeldor, than one of those long-bearded pious Jews who get struck down from behind while they bend over the Talmud. After June 1967 everything is different and nothing will ever be the same again. I no longer need to defend myself, my ancestry, my background, my uniqueness, my scepticism and optimism, my twisted notions of what is right and wrong, my passion to take my own and other people's minds apart, my socialist democratic inter- national national utopian dream (a not unreasonable political ideal), my sexuality, my perverse nervous energy, my love or harmonious music, all my quirks, foibles, idiosyncrasies of speech and manner, all this part of a self I call "Jewish." Anxiety has been removed as if by magic. For forty years of my life (1927-1967) and twenty-four hours of every single day, I had been ready for the role of victim or hero or both. I can relax finally. I can look again. he sun set. A tired soldier slept at a bus station. A rude man tried to sell us Coca-Cola and potato chips. Behind us, three carriages away, a group of men shouted in loud prayer, thank- ing the Lord and shaking their bodies with the movement of the German-built diesel train. My son Grisha travelled with me and Judy. Grisha tried to make me answer a question to which I had no answer. My son persisted in one and the same question. He wanted to know before he had to go back to his army unit in Beersheba, he absolutely had to know the answer and I couldn't shake him off: "Do you like being a Jew, father, yes or no?" I finally said: "Who likes being a Jew? Now the entire world has gone Jewish it's no longer anything special, son." "Why do you want to be something special, father? What's the big deal?" 62 Spring/ Summer 1972</page><page sequence="5">Judy read a book, went for beer and sandwiches, wrote letters and smiled, while I believed the train was not real, nor the land outside the window, nor anyone I met, nor anything I saw. It seems only yesterday when we sang in our youth club: Ha-mashiach hine ba [The Messiah cometh]-and there he is. The Jewish state is packed with highways, motor cars and high-rise buildings, tourists and soldiers and people. Israel seems definitely the most overpop- ulated country in the world. Everywhere crowds. Where do all these Jews come from? Haven't they killed six million of them? What happened? HOW CAN ISRAEL BE ALIVE AND BEAUTIFUL if I am still in mourning for what happened to me back in the 1940s-some- where in a strange country? This is home. This is my country. These are my people. My own family. I know them by heart. I am at home. Home. Home. Let me out! Let me out of here! I opened the window for some fresh air and was suffocated by the sweetness of jasmine, oranges, soil. The holiness of the Holy Land is its beauty, a beauty that winds itself into myth and religious mystery. A beauty that has not been disturbed by the ugly, practical modern housing estates and would be dead without the people who live and walk in it. A Venice without its inhabitants and tourists one would also call a ghost town. I should maybe try again to settle down in my own country among my own people. Why not? Would my parents be pleased, were they stilve? They wouldn't care maybe, one way or an- other. I don't think they would. Why move, my mother would say, if you feel all right where you are? Feel all right where I am? I never feel all right wherever I am, but at least I know: In exile nothing lasts, nothing is permanent. Anyway a home here in this country, even a simple one, costs twelve thousand pounds sterling. I can't afford to live among the family; it doesn't matter whether I want to live here or not. Theirs is certainly a good, a beautiful, a warm country, but why do I still think I should be part of it? Only because I want to be part of something, which here seems nearly possible and is absolutely out of the question. It's a hard thing to admit to myself, that I don't like to live only among Jews. I wonder why. I like them as individuals and even in groups. I think they are fabulous, superior, super-intelligent, talented, gifted, good people on the whole, don't drink much, don't kill much. Just swindle, just try to be smart. And always in a hurry, as if the Messiah might leave the same day. Alchemists transformed ordinary stone and sand outside this train window within the last fifty years into innumerable towns and suburbs. Some more attrac- tive than others. All of them dull. The Trip fo Jerusalem 63 The Antioch Review</page><page sequence="6">II "Do you not know, have you not heard, were you not told long ago, have you not percei'ved ever since the world began that God sits throned on the vaulted roof of earth, whose inhabitants are like grasshoppers?" -Isaiah 40:21 he holy Jerusalem is a bustling, overpopulated town. Mount Zion is a bus station. Jerusalem is rebuilt-in the world. On the roof of King David's tomb (it used to be a mosque until an in- fluential man from Warsaw called Kahane managed to convert the place to its present-day use) rises a small minaret and on the plat- form of this minaret I met Mordechai Feinmann, about twenty- three, dressed in a black kaftan and wide-brinmmed hat, with very long, brown earlocks. He was a Yeshiva bocher-a student at a ye- shiva, the high school cum university for higher Orthodox studies. According to Feinmann, who had been meditating and smoking (cig- arettes) probably for an hour before I came upstairs, three things are wrong with this Israel: (1) the government snatches dead Jews out of their graves and sells them to laboratories and medical schools around the world, keeping a few for local needs; (2) the govern- ment calls everyone a Jew, even if he eats pork and doesn't pray; (3) there is a need for Jewish self-defense against "them." Saying this he took a small pistol from his right-hand pocket. "This I have to carry with me to defend myself against the Black Panthers, my friend. They have beaten three of us into hospital in the past few weeks. The police look the other way." The story of the dead Jews snatched from their graves and sold by government agents in the dead of night was too good to let pass so quickly. Why are you against it? Because we mustn't touch the dead. But the doctors have to know what man looks like inside. Why? To cure him. The law of the Torah is against it. No medicine? The inner Jew is of no importance. See? It's the outer Jew, the one who built the asphalt roads up to 64 Spring/ Summer 1972</page><page sequence="7">this place, that Feinmann is concerned with. He wouldn't admit that much. Instead he suggested I should join him in his synagogue in Mea Shearim for prayer. That the government calls everyone a Jew, number two of his complaints, I thought he should not take too seriously. What else can the government of a Jewish state call its citizens? Call them Polacks, Rumanians and Yekkes? The people do that among themselves anyway. He laughed, and gave me two points here. The question of Jewish self-defense in the heart of the Jewish universe impressed me; the pistol looked real. But you are not allowed to kill, are you? If I have to, yes, but I'll try to fire in the air first. We have heard that before. That's what the first settlers said and did when they confronted the first Arabs attacking them. Things changed. Feinmann was in good shape. He didn't look the kind who was going to get beaten up by the Brownshirts. I felt that for the first time I had met a really courageous Jew, one who is not afraid of his own fellow men. Nobody seems to be afraid of the Arabs, but most Israelis fear their countrymen. The Galicians for their cunning, the Rumanians for their cheating and stealing, the Russians for their autocratic arrogance, the Yekkes for their efficiency, and the Americans for their demand for special privileges. Mordechai Feinmann is the new type of chalutz-"a man who passes armed be- fore the Lord." Jews, the real ones too, are apparently heavily armed. The world is still after them, twenty-five years after Hitler the world wants to get rid of them, even of the few thousand Fein- manns. Aren't you paranoic, Mordechai? Auschwitz is paranoic? How can you compare it? Compared to the Germans the bastards here are just less ef- ficient. When your three friends were attacked and beaten, did the Black Panthers want to kill them? No, I suppose they wanted to pray Ma'ariv* with us. I should ask them next time. Mordechai Feinmann tried to depress me. I stand on the roof of the Holy Land with a straight view of the golden bowl over the Mosque of Omar that hides the seat of the Holy of Holies in the temple, the ark and the centre of the ark, the centre of God all- mighty, the lord of the universe, and this Feinmann tries to tell me Israel is a bad place to be in, because an Orthodox Jew gets beaten up occasionally. Listen Mordechai, it's nothing new, stop complaining. *The evening prayer. The Trip to Jerusalem 65 The Antioch Review</page><page sequence="8">Who said it was new? All I said is it's not nice to be beaten up. At this moment I felt it again: a hatred of those who are fright- ened by the might of their fellow men. I couldn't even stand his presence. I would have liked to beat him myself and throw him down into the tomb of our mutual ancestor. It was a curious way to discover that I am actually not a Jew, because I am never ready to kill the assailants of the innocent. The mind boggles. This discov- ery alone had been worth the trip. If I am not a Jew, which I always thought I was and to which my family and friends would swear, what am I? I can certanly not call myself a non-Jew-and to call myself simply a human being is too simple to express the truth. I am not a Jew, though I always thought I was one, whether I liked myself, my people, my family or not. I am one of us, or am I one of them? Everyone calls me a Jew, and certainly everyone who knows I am a Jew will say, "That's what you are." But now after I see armed Orthodox Jews defending themselves with guns in the heart of Jerusalem against other Jews (it doesn't matter whether it's thirty thousand Mea Shearim Orthodox against only a handful of Black Panthers; the fact is, it's not a political problem), it's a matter of (my own) identity. Today's wars take place inside; arms are yesterday's symbols. The real question is: What do the Mordechai Feinmanns stand for that anyone would lift a hand against them? What a fine mystical weapon this Mauser is, to protect the life of the true believers, and therefore their belief in the meantime. "Mor- dechai Feinmann," I hear myself say, "you think you have a prob- lem. Your kind of 'Jews' are a powerful minority here; you can look after yourself. What shall I say? I am alone among the others; I live in the Diaspora." But why? Why don't you live here? It's your country as well. What's wrong with Israel? It's impossible for Jews to live among Jews, Mordechai, that's my conclusion; put that in your pipe. You have found it to be true as well. It's not so bad as I made out. It's all right. And what about the gun in your pocket? That's just to be on the safe side. What is a Jew, Mordechai? Well, I am a Jew. Look at me. I do what the Law tells me. It says I should shave my hair and grow my earlocks; it tells me to wear tzitzot.* I shave my hair and grow my earlocks. I wear tzitzot. It tells me to pray. I pray. *Tzitzot are, properly speaking, the four strands of wool worn on the inside of a piece of cloth, made from the same material as the tallith. This cloth covers the body. Every male is supposed to wear this religious garment over his shirt. 66 Spring/ Summer 1972</page><page sequence="9">It tells me to keep the Sabbath and the Holidays holy. I do what it says. If you follow most of the 613 commandments of Moses you are a Jew, that is, if you were born one and are circumcised and your mother is Jewish. The Law is too stern, Mordechai. Let's live a little less perfectly. The Law is too much for ordinary people; we cannot change it but we can reinterpret it. In my Yeshiva I'll teach: If you can't, don't take the Law too strictly. Life doesn't last forever one way or an- other. What's all this nonsense, Mordechai? Take off this ridiculous kaftan, this fourteenth-century German merchant fashion, and join the army. Ask them to put you in the navy or in the cavalry. A ship is as good as a horse, and healthier than your synagogue, to pray from. God doesn't live in a synagogue. I have been to the army. They always say here in the country: We from the yeshivas refuse to serve. It's a lie. We are thirty thou- sand and maybe three thousand refused to serve. We should spend our time studying the Talmud and Gemarah. How else will the country have rabbis? Who will teach the law when all of us are drafted? It's only three years, and afterwards you can do what you please. Don't tell me. I was in the army. I even liked it. My father wants me to be a chazzan but I can't sing. I was happy to get away from home for a while, so what? You don't understand the real enemy of this country, my friend. It's themselves, their pagan way of life. They eat here like chazers* and die like flies, of heart attacks and cancer, because they don't keep the Law. They don't keep the law? Which law? There are so many, Mor- dechai. I f nothing else, even a quick glimpse over this land- scape teaches humility. In an etemal Holy Land, with many holy cities and innumerable holy stones, a single individual is hardly no- ticeable. Even if a man here reaches 120 years of age, like the pa- triarchs, he remains-less than a handful of dust. One might "know" this to be true anywhere in the world. Here, for a reason hard to define, the superior lesson is not taught by the Wisdom of Torah and Talmud. It's the other way round: Torah (the Law) and Tal- mud (the study of the Law) teach a man how to conduct his life because he is supposed to have learned the fear of God in the sub- *Pigs, not Khazars. The Trip to Jerusalem 67 The Antioch Review</page><page sequence="10">conscious of his heritage.* Study begins at the age of four (in the traditional cheder) and never ends. It may take half a lifetime to study the major works of Mishnah, Gemara, Kabbala, Rambam, the Book of Splendor, the Book of Creation-and a single sentence in Exodus (Ja-hweh's I am who I am) might take up all the rest of a lifetime. This wisdom is written in a code-Hebrew. Hebrew and Aramaic. Both can be learned, depending at what age you be- gin to learn them. Four years might already be too old. he friend of a friend in London is Moshe Pilz, an of- ficial in the Ministry of Culture, and he must have thought me at least "peculiar" when I told him I wanted to see some Arab, Chris- tian and Jewish wise men, Sufis, Hassids, Christian mystics. Moshe Pilz didn't know any Sufis or Christian mystics he could send me to at such short notice, but he knew of a Rabbi Matalon who speaks English and would maybe talk to me if first I rang his father-in-law, a man who turned from "freethinker" to Hassid at the age of forty. I should ring him up first. Mr. Levine was already waiting for me when I arrived at our meeting place, the synagogue of the President, so called because the President comes here to pray, if not every Saturday, quite frequently. I haven't been to a synagogue for thirty years. I remember them as cold, damp, badly ventilated basements. Christians have similar problems at their places of worship; they too somehow man- age to keep fresh air out and I believe it is not because of negligence, or stinginess on the part of the church wardens, which stops them investing in an air-conditioner. There is a deeper reason. The pious benefit by asphyxia. Any reduction in oxygen heightens the mystical experience. That's why all those who keep their heads down con- stantly over books can see such wondrous things indeed. They are only half breathing, or stoned out of their skulls. Levine had the light blue eyes of the Hassid but didn't grow a beard. He wore modern dress. He looked like Gurdieff with his white drooping moustache and it turned out he came from the same part of the world. There were quite a few pairs of those light blue mystic eyes** above beards and moustaches. I tried to pray myself, but lost the passage on the first page, in spite of the help of Levine, who kept on thumbing my prayer book and pointing to the words the leader of the congregation was about to say aloud. 'The Jew is, so to speak, born religious whether he knows it or not. `*There are "light" and "dark" Hassids. This was a congregation of light Hassids, with bright, shining eyes. 68 Spring/ Summer 1972</page><page sequence="11">I became uncertain whether they pray to the same God of Israel I pray to. Mine is no doubt the same as theirs, but while they speak Hebrew to him very rapidly, I hope he also understands silence. But I am not sure. How can one be? After seeing Levine I saw no point in visiting Rabbi Matalon. I felt I was back in the old synagogue in the Schiittaustrasse in Vienna, though the ventilation here was far better, the building new, not even completed, and even the Hassids looked healthier than ours at home. After the prayer, a study group sat down to study a page from the Talmud. Whether in Hebrew, Aramaic or Yiddish, I wouldn't have been able to fol- low a single word. Even if I can speak the language and read it, I still cannot speak it and read it. The real Hebrew is codified in a few "nus, nus" and shrugs of hands and shoulders, and every sen- tence in the Bible, the Book of Books, is open to six hundred dif- ferent interpretations. "In the beginning God created heaven and earth"-the very first sentence in Genesis-is being discussed among these men as if their lives depended on it. Yet if I can't even pray with the Jewish Orthodox mystical Hassidic sect, what chance do I have to communicate with a Sufi master or a Christian monk? Or can I learn from them because I don't speak or understand their language. I don't know what they are saying. The same old stifling synagogue atmosphere among middle-aged businessmen, clerks, shopkeepers, is necessary to convince me that I do not belong here either, that "they" try to keep people like myself out for good. O n my way home to Washington Street I went to meditate on the physical Israel at my favorite spot (an old Arab coffee house) near the Jaffa Gate in the Old City. Seen from here, from the other side as it were, the noisy stream of Israeli and foreign tourists who rush through this gate and into the old town with the speed and power of a Niagara Falls (seemingly 24 hours a dav) are the true answer to my question. Looking at all these hustling and fast-walking people, I began to understand why princes, priests and prophets must hide behind temple walls, palace grounds or in caves in the Judean desert. The physical power of the people here is a frightening experience, particularly in a country that only respects the privacy of the dead (and according to Feinmann not even that). Israel is not a ghost, and not a monument, but very much alive and moving. So far I was either depressed or impressed. One of the greatest wonders to me, for instance, is the adaptation of Europeans to this incredible heat. While it would be natural to drag your feet The Trip to Jerusalem 69 The Antioch Review</page><page sequence="12">and hardly move your behind, Jews here work like their ancestors in Egypt, and gradually teach the same to the local Arabs. Things will change, even here. Now it's the Arab's unskilled labor which "rebuilds" the country, and they benefit from it too. The Arabs have never seen so much prosperity and employ- ment, money and business, in their own, their parents' or their grandparents' lifetimes. Not surprising the guerrillas failed. The Arabs whom they want to liberate from the Zionist yoke are doing too well under this yoke. The Zionists brought them a taste of America, their promised land, into their houses. Only in American movies had most Arabs ever seen this kind of bustling, booming, neon-lit, eroticized, fast-cars-along-boulevards, overloaded shop win- dows, skyscrapers and rich men's swimming pools dreamland be- fore. Only fools and fanatics would like to change this vision back into what it had been before. Anyway a generation has grown up in the meantime (since '48) that does not even remember the Pales- tine (that was either a Turkish or a British backwater) that they are now supposed to take back from the newly landed Martians who have electrified them out of their traditional posture of laissez- faire. Maybe he is not, but the Israeli seems to have no choice but be involved personally in the success or failure of this country. He donates three years' army service and a lifetime in the Reserve. He pays taxes that take nearly all his earnings-taxes to travel abroad (50 per cent of the ticket), taxes to purchase, to sell, to die-taxes kept artificially high or the citizen might get carried away in a cloud. ("We are at war always, remember chaver!"*). Life is tough, tougher than in most countries, too many geniuses competing against too many geniuses, if it's quiet on the fronts. A never-ending stream of new immigrants arrives daily to demand their share in the com- ing of the Messiah. Like a hundred years ago they come again from the East, from Russia, and for the first time they also come in large numbers from the West, the previously promised land, "Amerikke." There are too many practical problems for the man in the street to solve; my esoteric wish to experience a spiritual Israel would need a new interpretation of what spiritual means. Is defiance against the world ("We'll never give them anything back, are you crazy?") spiritual? The fear of the neighbors ("The Arabs won't make peace, why should they? They benefit by this state of war and so do we") spiritual? Yes, of course, it is that as well. I know that those who claim that both parties benefit by the war are right. Only the exterior enemy makes them forget their private quarrels among *Hebrew for comrade. 70 Spring/ Summer 1972</page><page sequence="13">themselves and even in this respect Jews and Arabs are truly family. They have known one another for ages, as Ishmael and Israel, Esau and Jacob. They have a long history together and the same archfathers in common. The Muslims recognze Moses as a prophet and Jesus as a prophet and in their hearts know only too well that Israel in the Middle East spells economic progress and ultimately prosperity for the entire area. Not the French and not the British, not the Americans and certainly not the Russians are at home here. The Israelis are. They have proven it. They have made something out of nothing. It proves it can be done. This lesson is not lost on the Arabs. I suggest that most Arabs secretly love the Israelis, like a tired old man who likes to see a young partner enter his shaky, crumbling enterprise. But it certainly takes time to get used to this new energy. Strangely enough, in spite of what Israelis mumble, I believe that they too are happier, livng in a sea of Arabs whose backwardness stimulates their own sense of achievement. They are the teachers in the Middle East (and in half a dozen African and Asian countries) and feel safer here than in Poland, Russia, Germany, Rumania, Hungary, etc.-for very good reasons. And while no one talks about it, everyone knows that "Amerikke," the promised land, did not keep its pronise (didn't even make one) and rejected the Jews that Hitler wanted to get off his Christian conscience. In 1942 Hider righdy assumed he had the silent majority of gentiles on his side when he began to apply his own final solution to the "Jewish Queston." Israelis don't wish to discuss the past at length. They seem to be saying: "Why discuss what is beyond dispute? The new spirit of Israel is made of steel and concrete. Let 'them' never try it again and may God forgive them." Perhaps it's this sense of forgiveness that turned their eyes to the divine miracle of concrete high-rise buildings growing out of holy and barren hills, but while our God may or may not forgive the gentiles, He will not and cannot forgive us our own meekness, our pacifist humility among "goyim." Still besieged by "goyim," the new secret weapon of the Israelis is self-reliance, a very powerful device exceeding all notions of nuclear fission, and neither mystical nor mysterious. he kabbalistic diagram of an anthropomorphic God shows the right shoulder to be Wisdom and the left Understanding, the divine attributes chochmah and binah. The head on the shoul- ders is crowned by keter, the crown of God. If the shoulders are out of balance, the crown shakes, and what it covers, the head, is in dis- array. Wisdom and Understanding equals scholarship. It's all in the The Trip to Jerusalem 71 The Antioch Review</page><page sequence="14">mind, so to speak. That's the way I learned it, that's why I still had a strong desire to meet the town's intellectuals and poets and maybe a politician or two, to get an idea of what the articulate have to say. Everyone has a lot to say here: people talk non-stop. They don't drink, don't smoke drugs, don't take mushrooms or mescaline, and are always turned on. What are they high on here? They are high on living in Jerusalem, on living in Israel, on defying the United Nations, the Arabs, the Russians, the Americans, anyone in fact who doesn't let them do what they want. All they want is: To stay right here on their balconies and never move again. The people are high on being home. I am just a visitor. I came to study. I have come too late. The world has found its savior without me. I have an Austrian passport and a residence in London and Majorca. I speak Hebrew fluently and lived five years in this coun- try. I am a Zionist by education, a Jew by choice; I am not an Israeli, I am not a Zionist, I don't know what Jew really means. R inging the Professor for an appointment was a courageous undertaking and I couldn't believe my good fortune when he said, yes, he wanted to see me and even remembered me. The Professor is a Jewish mystic in the disguise of a German scholar, born in Berlin. He came here in 1923, as a Zionist and to study Kab- balah. Half a century and a few hundred papers and books later, he is probably the secular world's greatest authority on Jewish mys- ticism, in fact, I am convinced he is. I had met him a few years ago in Cincinnati, Hebrew Union College, where I read and talked to a congregation of young reform rabbis, their teachers, and their wives, cousins and girlfriends. The Professor, who at the time was the honored guest in residence, gave me a sceptical look from the first row that made me feel that whatever I had written, thought, or had to say seemed simply "just experience" in his small light blue ironical eyes. I had talked with passion about the difficulties of a Jew writing in German after what had happened, but all my passion sounded sentimental in my ears when I looked into the eyes of the Professor. Now I had come to listen. And I listened. He talked. His wife talked. They both talked simultaneously at me. I talked. We cut to safe topics, like Sartre, Graves, Grass, who had all been sitting in the same chair I was sitting in, and where Borges and Buber had been sitting and where Agnon used to eat two different kinds of cake and drink tea. We talked about publishers and publishing and first and later editions. Smiles all round. (The Professor's wife was born in the same town as the Ba'al Shem Tov, and my mother's 72 Spring/ Summer 1972</page><page sequence="15">birthplace was only a few miles away.) I told him about LSD and the Khazars and how I learned I was an ex-anti-Semite and maybe not a Jew. He smiled, because nothing is new under the sun. We talked a little longer, then he put on his scarf and walked me to the corner. I felt my interview had come to nothing, we hadn't even broached the subjects I wanted to know most, but consoled myself that this was just a first visit and on first visits "heavy subjects" are better avoided; besides, I didn't want to ask questions, but rather, in the tradition of watching the Master tying his shoelaces, I was ready to learn from everything he said and did not say. A week later I went to visit him a second time (I still couldn't understand how scholarship could converse with fantasy); he had been kind enough to invite me for another evening of tea and cakes and talk. This time I went with Annie, and again we talked about nothing in particular I can recall now, but I was glad to find that far from disturbing the Professor a female audience cheered him up.* "Jews are not spiritual," said the Professor, "the Christians are. We are a practical people." He confirmed what I'd felt all along. It's this atmosphere practical people create about themselves which made me also most of the time reel the helpless bystander among busy, shouting and hard-working laborers erecting a pavilion for a fair that has to open the next morning. As if I had always known it. Jews are not a spiritual people, they are down to earth, they believe in the here and now, in the world. "Better to be a live dog than a dead lion," says Ecclesiastes in the name of the great and wise King Solomon, and he also says: ". . . it is good and proper for a man to eat and drink and enjoy himself in return for his labors under the sun, throughout the brief span of his life God has allotted him" (Eccles. 5:18), etc. etc. A philosophy of life hard to resist. The spiritual Christian world in which all my ancestors lived, does not stress this libidinous engagement of man to his life. Like its found- ing fathers the Essenes, Christianity points for salvation to the sky of the Judean desert. The wildemess of Judah slopes down to the ends of the world only twenty miles east of Jerusalem. A vision of arid land, unin- habitable by cattle or men, while ours is an older "orthodox" look of archfathers and prophets who filled this void with a thousand earthly delights. I suggest there are at least two kinds of prophets in Israel: those who "see" the wasteland of Ein-Sof ["the infinite"] and, frightened by what they see, urge stern reforms to combat a grim human condition, and those who "see" the lush, pleasing, over- *The study of Jewish mysticism is not incompatible with ordinary life; on the contrary, Jewish mysticism relates to ordinary life just like the mythical (or is it mystical) twins Esau and Jacob. One follows the other, one conditions the other, they share the same womb. The Trip to Jerusalem 73 The Antioch Review</page><page sequence="16">whelning, rich beauty of an oasis in the desert and dispense a more humane counsel for the same incurable ailment called "the brief span God has allotted him." With the Christians we differ not in principle but in vision. I meandered through Jerusalem and crossed near the Wailing Wall where a small bridge over excavations leads to the grounds of the former Temple. A big board, black on white, said in four or five languages: "This is holy ground. You are not allowed to enter." Yet the two policemen inside the gate told me I should go right ahead. The place was swarming with tourists. III Over Jerusalem flutters the sadness of too many defeats the young and foolish enjoy their victory while the old and wise bewail the loss of their youth. -J.L. But the law doesn't permit me to enter. It's their law, not ours. (They could see I wasn't an Israeli by my clothes and tourists are allowed any number of stupid remarks and questions.) What do you mean their law? Aren't you a Jew? Does a Jew have to be crazy? What do you mean? Look chaver, I have been sitting here near this gate for four years. I can see it's a big attraction. The whole town belongs to the Orthodox Mafia, but up here they have no business. The business belongs to the Arabs here; that's why they put up the sign: Don't enter. How can you talk like that? Where are you from? Do you want me to kiss them? They smell. Never mind. Be healthy and go in peace. Shalom. Shalom. 74 Spring/ Summer 1972</page><page sequence="17">The Palestinian Arabs, as some scholars claim, are the Jews who were not deported to Rome when the Temple fell (the poorest were not deported; the Romans had enough of their own poor). The long stay in the country made them slow down and dampen down their voices. Arabs only shout when they want to sell you something or threaten they are about to kill you; for the rest they seem the quietest and most peaceful part of the population. In the courtyard of the Mosque of Omar there was real peace in Israel. Yet no Jew is allowed to enter its compounds, as he might unknow- ingly wander through the place where once the Holy of Holies stood.* The Arabs built their Omar Mosque over it (they think) while the rabbis and scholars do not agree. To replace the mosque with a third temple is also out. The third temple, it is prophesied, will not be built by human hand; it will descend straight from heaven, God himself will build it, with his own plans and his very own materials. In the shade of a huge cypress, observing tourists queueing for tickets and a few old men ceremoniously washing their feet, I meditated on what materials God might be using and how far his plans had progressed. In spite of the fact that the rabbis don't agree even among them- selves whether or not this board should be up, and whether it is right or wrong for a Jew to walk in the compound of the former temple, in spite of the fact that no one knows exactly (or those who do, will not tell) where the Holy of Holies stood, I was prevented from eventually sinning by the idea of having to queue for a ticket in the broiling heat. Looking over the shoulder and outstretched arm of the young man at the door (who gave me filthy looks for trying to see his show and his secret without paying for it), I couldn't make out anything but a piece of ornamented ceiling and an idea of small carpets manned by pious Muslims with faces pressed to the floor. Nothing else to be seen. The light outside was too strong and the inside was too dark. The ancient Jebusite threshing floor which archfather Abraham had bought to leave to his descendants was vis- ible only to those who keep their faces to the ground. The final attempt to put my head through the door practicaly broke my nose. I stared into the glasses of a friend I had not seen for years. What are you doing here? Looking for you. Well, here I am, how are you? He introduced me to his friends, a young French couple whom he had been sightseeing with. Like all Israelis, Bernie thought it To which only the high priests had access, while Israel (the people) remained outside, as it should be. The Trip to Jerusalem 75 The Antioch Review</page><page sequence="18">his duty to leave home and work when visitors arrived from abroad.* How are you Bernie? I'm leaving (he told me the same four years ago) but I can't leave. Where in the world are there so many Jews together in one big lump? I am here because I am an anti-Semite. Before the war we had plenty of Jews in Antwerp, but they have gone. Where can an anti-Semite go, I ask you? One who enjoys hating them? He has to come to this rat-hole. His French friends tried to crack a smile. Israelis who malign their country are considered "originals" here, and they are indeed quite rare. Don't you know a woman for me? I want to get married. But none of the girls here want me; they think I am a stupid ass. After fifteen years in this country I still have nothing. As it is not advisable to discuss marriage or sex with Bernie, because he gets carried away easily and won't change the subject for three hours, I tried to switch the topic before it was too late. What's happened to Eli? 0, whatshisname. Who knows? He's crazy. You haven't made up yet? Make up what? With an idiot? What do you take me for? Bernie and Eli had both been officers. They had wild escapes, adventures, fantastic things happen to them. They had also jumped by parachute as part of their training. One day in late December 1967 Moshe Dayan and a friend entered the famous Fink's, the last British colonial pub in the Middle East; it's run by a German-speak- ing Czech. Dayan had hardly sat down at his table when Bernie and Eli, five tables removed, began to quarrel over whether it's possible to descend on a marking with one eye closed. What began as a joke nearly finished in a fist fight. Dayan's missing eye ended a friend- ship of many years. Bernie brought me back from the clouds I had been drifting on since I had crossed the small bridge and passed the two policemen at the gate. I was suddenly down. I looked at him. I stared. What's this magic Bernie has that can puncture, burn down and totally destroy another man's kite? Just a few words, just the sound of these words. The ordinariness of the people and their pride in not being sophisticated, and not sensitive, purposely not sensitive, to people who are "not on the ground" is a very local trait. I remember *Israelis love nothing better than to receive visitors from abroad. If the visitors are non-Jewish (as in this case) sightseeing with them becomes even more of a patriotic duty. Whenever a tourist looks at something, be it a house, a moun- tain or a field, the Israeli will soon stop to ask the perennial question: Nu, what do you think? If you say "Wonderful," you still feel you walked into a trap. 76 Spring/ Summer 1972</page><page sequence="19">well that as a child I could never sit still anywhere for a few moments and look at something silently without my mother, one of my sisters, or a relative or friend coming up and asking: What are you looking at? or, What are you thinking? Being silent here, meditating, reflecting, means: "A man who thinks is obviously in trouble or he wouldn't have to think." It's a friend's duty to cheer him up by talking. Bernie was like most of my friends in this country (not to speak of relatives). They will never be quiet in company. ("If I want to be quiet, why do I need com pany?" is the logic at the root of a perpetual, never-ending stream of words). Maybe there is nothing typically Jewish about this. Idle and pohte conversation is always made among people who in fact have no communication between one another. That's why attempts can be so unpleasant. What is very Jewish, and especially Israeli, is the patronizing way people encourage one another when they've finished talking. Whatever the tale, the listener will sum it all up in two words, easy to learn: "Yiyiyae toy," meaning "All will be well, don't worry." Before he or I could say yiyiyae tov we shook hands. M ount Zion is just twenty minutes' walk away and only five minutes by car. There is a Greek Orthodox, a Catholic, a Protestant church or monastery (one of each) on Mount Zion. An Arab boy showed me the roohm where Jesus had his last supper. A perfect, elegant dining room in a beautiful old Arab house. In the courtyard looking down from the dining room on the first floor, to the left is the entrance to King David's tomb. The old bearded man sitting on a bench in the shade was already off duty and the night watchman now in charge of the keys was "somewhere around. But the place is closed, it's after 5:30 P.M. Come tomorrow." I was ready to wait. I wanted to see this tomb of the great king. I don't know what I expected from it. Two young, dark, local women with two small children had been here before me. They had come for a blessing: closed or not closed, with a bit of good will and maybe a small bakshish they would get in. Little did they know that this night watchman was one of the very few saints in the world and probably the only one in Israel. He didn't want any money. He just wanted to go back to his room, three catacombs along the corridor, to start on his work. I didn't know it either until he took me back to his quarters. His duties at thle tomb are to keep the keys at night, to switch lights on and off, keep the yard clean, occasionally talk to an angry inspector from the City Council (his employers) on the phone, but it didn't disturb him. Nothing dis- The Trip to Jerusalem 77 The Antioch Review</page><page sequence="20">turbed him. He had no complaints. Josef is no Portnoy. Josef is not any Jew I had ever met before. His reward for keeping the keys to the holy grail was the two hundred Israeli pounds a month and this place to sleep-a cool damp catacomb, shielded from the rest of the cellars by a door made of wood, asbestos and corrugated roofing material. One door. No win- dows. Before Josef moved in it was a storeroom: Josef left it that way, just making himself a small shelf for a teakettle, another shelf to write his books, and a third for his small Philips tape recorder and radio. From the two hundred Israeli pounds he has one hundred left at the end of the month. Nothing he could think of to spend his money on. His staple diet is leaves. "You can eat all leaves, every single green leaf from trees, bushes, grass. Any green leaf, though some have more nourishment and taste better than others. I might one day maybe write this book on my diet, but that's too early. I'm stil experimenting so to speak. Some leaves make me very ill and I lie here with cramps for a few days. But then the 'Highest' puts me back on my feet again." Josef was small, had piercing blue eyes beneath excessive bushy eyebrows and a dark blond, slightly greying, scruffy beard. His black hat, instead of being dented in, pointed up. He wore an old dishevelled grey suit, a shirt that didn't fit and shoes that were either too big or too heavy for him. On first sight I believed I had last seen him in the Gorky trilogy. He spoke Russian, Czech, German, Hungarian, Yiddish. My Yiddish is bad imitation. He didn't mind speaking German. He placed a few old broken chairs under an open bulb, offered me dried prunes and dried apricots and old boiled sweets from huge paper bags-and of course green leaves, which didn't taste too bad-and tea. We sat under the bulb like on an open stage and talked. He did most of the talking. I learned something from his "turning point." It happened at the end of the war when Josef, after a few days march in an Arbeitskommando, reached a casino occupied by the SS. Instead of shooting the Jews the commanding officer gave them a feast. The war was practically over and the SS men needed a few Jews for an alibi.* Josef's turning point was also a day in March 1945. He owed his life to divine intervention and from then on devoted all his time to prayer and study and the writing of holy brochures which he printed at his own expense and sold to "his customers" in town. The job as night watchman at the tomb was his best deal in life yet. *Exactly this had been the story I wrote ten years before "Soul of Wood." The story of one Anton Barth, who spent his war years in a forest where he survives miraculously as a deer among deer and is carried down from the wilderness into civilization by a few SS stragglers who are ready to capitulate to the Americans and need a Jew for an alibi. 78 Spring/ Summer 1972</page><page sequence="21">He said it left him with plenty of time to study and to write "and what else is life all about but to praise the wonders of the Lord of the Universe, what else is there?" I can't think of anything else, either, Josef. This meeting with Josef at the tomb of David, this unique spot, was more than weird. As if I had suddenly found, exactly ten years later, the ending of the short novel I had started in the summer of 1961. 1 had expected anything to happen to it, but cer- tainly not that. IV The Jews know hardly anything of a hell that might await them. Their hell is a personal dissatisfaction with themselves if they are mediocre. -David Ben Gurion, Recollections ** . EIII nd Israel shall be at rest once more pros- perous and unafraid, prophesied Jeremiah. At rest not, but prosper- ous it definitely looks. And whether it is He who heals the broken in spirit and binds up their wounds as the psalnists claim, the map of Israel is not only a biblical reference book but also a diagram of restored fates. Everything that was wrecked, country and people, is on its feet again. The towns are bursting at the seams (urban dwellers don't change so quickly their taste for crowds and bustle). In the towns there is nothing to see, they are not beautiful (except Jerusalem and partly Haifa, people say), the countryside is the place everyone sends you to. See the country! Have you seen the coun- try? You've been three weeks in Israel and you haven't seen the country? What else is there to see? The rented Hertz Ford Taunus (15 to 20 per cent off if you have a friend in the Ministry of Tourism, which I have) was to see the country. I had thought I would take a week to travel around. To see the "country," meaning the countryside, is not the same as seeing the country anywhere else. Of course it's beautiful, every part of it, beautiful because it's the holy country. But what exactly is there to see from the Carmel where the prophet Elijah ascended straight to heaven? The villages of the The Trip to Jerusalem 79 The Antioch Review</page><page sequence="22">Druses? The Carmel range of mountains above the Bay of Haifa is the home of the Druses, a small sect of non-Muslim Arabs who have always been the friends of the Israelis and are still the most reliable frontier guards. A visit to the new university? It looks just like any modem building in the world, but for the Israelis it's something else. They mention it with the pride of villagers who have seen their first water pump installed. If it's not the universitv, it's the location people send you to. There is something Germanic about their love for "views." Looking over the bay and on clear days up to Rosh el Nikra on the Lebanese border is a patriotic duty. The visitor who doesn't have many "beautiful views" to report is considered "insensitive"; if he says everything is beautiful they think he is pull- ing their leg; if he doesn't say anything they think he is a snob. Down the Carmel the asphalt road (fit for a Switzerland) winds down to the Mifraz, the industrial pulse of the country, no uglier than Pittsburgh, Manchester or the Ruhr but much hotter than similar areas. Polluting the rivers and sea at the same frenetic speed, their lorries carry the raw materials down the Acco road. Arab towns-Acco is still 95 per cent Arab-have in common the smell of burned oil and rotten fruit. The squalor of the old town is a true sight for the tourist. Most houses are still without toilet facilities. One can well understand why perfumes were first manufactured in the East and one can equally well understand the Israeli arrogance, pointing proudly to their modem and clean towns, yet one cannot help but feel that "there is something to see here." Though not for long (the main attraction, the old Mosque, supposedly older than the Mosque of Omar in Jerusalem, is packed with children from the kibbutz, who come here with their teachers on their day's excur- sion). Maybe it's the smallness of the country, but nowhere else in the world is the tourist so obvious. Whether Israeli or foreign, he stands around and gapes for hours and bargains in his remaining time for junk the local traders offer you in a loud voice (A little board in an Arab shop reads: "Come in and try to beat the Arab down." Another sign reads: "Haggling is part of our business"), and every- one, steered by the idea that he can beat down an Arab trader, ends up with a comucopia of brass trays, Turkish coffee pots, hand- carved crosses, sheepskins that keep on smelling forever of sheep, Bedouin jewellery and plastic handbags. The Arab traders are the Israelis' best friends. Only Israeli housewives reportedly bring back tomatoes and sardines from Cyprus because they are cheaper there (Cyprus is the only foreign country within a reasonable distance that the Israeli tourist can afford). Jews who seem to eat and con- sume as if they were just recovering from a grave illness can safely walk through anv Arab quarter, and even right on the Lebanese border they are safer than crossing Oxford Street in the rush hour. 80 Spring/ Summer 1972</page><page sequence="23">It's hard to explain this to anyone who has never been here: But Jews and local Arabs have made peace a long time ago. Not far from the German (Jewish-German) village of Nahariya sleeps an abandoned Arab village right in the dunes. The visiting writer or artist hears about this village ten times a day. All you need do is grow your hair long and the Israeli will associate you with a hippie and send you to this village by the sea where an artist and his friends have moved in, attracting all youngsters in blue jeans and long hair who arrive here with a rucksack. In this isolated vil- lage by the sea, it is rumoured, hippies smoke hash and the police raids are less frequent than in the discotheques, clubs and private parties. Wherever the long-haired come, it is said, the local youth is in danger of being infected with a germ of anarchistic philosophy that tramples on the holiest of Israeli pagan gods: physical labor. The myth of redemption through physical labor was the credo of the Zionists and physical labor is still, if not in reality at least in ideology, worshipped. The effect of half a dozen long-hairs in a small Israeli town is explosive. The citizens are scared out of their wits just to see them walking down the street. We never made it to the hippie village. Lost interest just by look- ing at it from afar. Maybe it was too hot for hip-talk, we went for a swim instead. We drove north along the coast and then turned east towards Tiberias. M aybe because Annie is not Jewish, looking at the land from her perspective it seemed just another very hot coun- try in the Middle East, in yellow, brown, green and blue. While I was emotionally exhausted ?- so many fantastic results of so much Jewish enterprise, she was mostly bored with the new. Only at Capernaum, on the northern shore of Lake Galilee, where Jesus and John had preached to the local fishermen, did she sense something "special" about this country. It must have been the Syrian moun- tains in the hazy afternoon sun, the rustling in the eucalyptus along the blue lake. Ein Gev on the eastern shore is known for its heroic resistance in the '48 war and its excellent fresh fish. The fishermen in Tiberias ready to row us over for a small fortune were not Arab traders in the Acco shuk; besides we could make it by car within the hour along the shore and still get back to Jerusalem the same evening. The fish was better than I had expected, the wine excellent (Israel used only to grow sweet wines or Passover, but in recent years, trying to corner a part of the world's wine market, it sud- The Trip to Jerusalem 81 The Antioch Review</page><page sequence="24">denly produces great dry French wines). Four American ex-hippies (one can't escape them) joined our table, two bearded men and two girls. They had come here because they thought "it's a gas and the shit's cheap." It turned out the kibbutz calls in the police to arrest the hashish smokers. There was no work on the boats either. Mike and Herb ended up in the fish ponds, breeding carp for export, while the girls were constantly switched from kitchen to laundry. We who came from far away cheered them up. They were restless. There is nothing to smoke up here and even if we turn on it's not the same. Why not? Because everyone else thinks you are insane. "Smoking shit is for the Arabs. We give it to them. Let them get stoned, they won't be able to move their asses or see straight." That's how they talk here. Who? Everyone. Mike, with the glasses and long black beard, ex-psychology student from Chicago, didn't want to go back all the same. "So we'll give up smoking! It's not the end of the world. But we sure miss it, to be among our own kind. I had always thought the Jews are my kind, but by God they are not! The Jews are squares. Man, are they ever square. It's like being home with mother." They wanted to get away from home and came home. There are many more of the new hip homecomers in Jerusalem, in the Yeshiva Diaspora, founded by the dancing and guitar-playing young rabbi from New York, Shlomo Carlebach. Those who gave up drugs in exchange for Jewish mysticism and Bible Carlebach managed to turn into pious Orthodox yeshiva bochers, fanatical as only new Hindu or Buddhist converts can be. "But that's not my trip, this mystic shit," said Pearl, "it's also shit, just like pot. Right?" Right, everything is right. W had seen most of the north of the country in one day. In Ramle, which is not too far from Ayalon, where sun and moon stood still according to Joshua 10:12, we stopped to buy yoghurt and olives. Ramle was roamed by thousands of short- trimmed young men in white shirts and uniforms who hang around on street corners, waiting for a bus, a girl, a cinema, or a lift-we could have taken half the town along. In the evening there is damned little to do here but walk from one terrace to the next, one coffee 82 Spring/ Summer 1972</page><page sequence="25">house to the next, in search of a party that might be going on some- where. Two days later we went south to Beersheba, where we took Grisha for lunch, him and his girlfriend, and wandered afterwards through an Arab market (a dump for old cars) at the edge of the town, the only "sight" worth seeing. We had planned to go even further south, to Eilat, but decided for the swimfming pool of the Desert Inn Hotel instead. The heat is nothing I could describe. It's like a sauna with a thermostat that's out of order. After two hours we felt strong enough to try to make it back north to Jerusalem along the Dead Sea road. By the time we arrived at the Seawaves Hotel it was dark. The hotel was packed with tourists, Israeli and foreign, none under fifty-five, who come here for the famous Dead Sea cures by mud and kali, widely advertised as a cure for every illness under the sun from rheumatism to rapid ageing. The heat, even at night (some- thing like 30 degrees Centigrade), robs your breath and pleasure in life, but it's impossible to leave the windows open. Open windows invite mosquitos, the only creatures alive on this lowest spot of the world. No fish, no birds, no animal can survive here, only mosquitos and mad Israelis who can even thrive on the heat and the oily chem- ical brew they sell. This Dead Sea doesn't allow you to lie flat on your stomach either (your feet are thrown up high in the air as if the law of gravity neither functions in outer space nor in the bowels of the earth) and yet the place is packed all the year round. Those who want to be young again go early to bed, to be ready to combat their age by next morning at six with Prussian discipline. Men and women, wrapped in a lifetime of fat, smeared all over with black mud, stalk on thin legs over burning sand beaches like strange ghosts from a comic opera set in hell. This hell is mentioned by Isaiah: . . . and the land shall become blazing pitch, which night and day shall never be quenched, and its smoke shall go up forever. From generation to generation it shall lie waste and no man shall pass through it ever again. There was no smoke going up from the other side of the lake, no Arab and not even a sheep in sight. In fact one had the impres- sion there had never been a Sodom and Gomorrah across the Hotel Seawaves. The bartender, an avid jazz fan who used to run a bar in Warsaw (only five years ago), convinced us that there is nothing going on in the hotel either, worth staying for longer than a night. For real meditation it would be advisable to sit in one of the many caves of the Essenes along the road to Jericho and watch the sun rise and set. The road along the western shore, through the wilderness of The Trip to Jerusalem The Antioch Review</page><page sequence="26">Judea, leads to Jericho, the world's oldest town. It says so on a board when you enter the town, "Jericho, eight thousand years old." It is the greenest of towns, famous for its walls that crumbled at the sound of trumpets, and one can easily understand why a palm oasis in the middle of nowhere could not withstand an army of thirsty Jews who came from hell. Before they finally caught their breath to blow their trumpets it took them forty years, but then it worked and the walls fell down. For an hour we climbed over opened ruins of eight-thousand- year-old dwellings gaping at us from big open holes dug deep down right in the middle of the hills. The excavations produced more hewn stones and more evidence of settlements. These shafts, dug to an unconscious pre-Stone Age time, are now free for everyone to see (with or without the Arab guide). Archaeology stimulates the appetite, just like a wake. We looked for a place to eat and found nothing. Jericho is not the friendliest of towns to strangers-it never was. It has this kind of tradition. We didn't feel like sitting down anywhere. Too many eyes stared at us, with more attention than we paid their walls, new and old. Yet what a beautiful place! Why is not one single Israeli town built like this? The answer is disturbing. H ard to explain to myself why I had wanted very much to meet the old man, father of the state. A leftover wish from younger days when we praised him in our songs in the youth move- ment. What could he possibly say to me I couldn't read somewhere? What shall I ask him when I see him, what will we talk about? I had come half an hour too late. The old man was asleep, the secre- tary told me, or maybe I should wait for a second and he wasn't asleep yet. Could I wait a moment? The secretary came back to tell me that he is taking his after- noon nap. Could I come back at 3:30 but not at 4? The hours after lunch in the heat of the day are reserved for sleep. I would have liked to do the same. But rather than face long fruitless talks with distant relatives, I decided to ponder the question of what to say when he wakes up. I sat in a restaurant overlooking the beach, with waiters half asleep, none under sixty, in the air-conditioned Amer- ican-style Dan Hotel. Even the gefilte fish I ordered looked tired. I was the only guest, lunch hour was over. The empty hours of the day, when all comes to a standstill. Tel Aviv wakes up at night and is open until the early hours of the morning. From my chair I could see the bench in the green above the beach where I had 84 Spring/ Summer 1972</page><page sequence="27">spent the meditating hours between jobs when I walked around in this town roughly twenty-five years ago as an unskilled laborer and later clerk, photographer's assistant, actor, etc., etc. It all came back, the hungry and embittered years, when I didn't quite know what whale had washed me here ashore. Last time I looked across the same stretch of blue seas, I had not dreamt of ever coming back. Or had I foreseen all this? What visitor am I? Don't I know every street and square by heart? Nothing much has changed in what is now the old part of the town, the houses, badly built, look just that much dirtier, as befits an old town. Tel Aviv was founded in 1906 in the sand dunes north of Jaffa and now extends practically half way up the coast to Haifa. New housing is the philosophy of the land. I was getting bored with my newly enflamed enthusiasm for this country. So what, I kept repeating, so what? What's so important about these new settlements? Who cares? What a peculiar kind of hang-up to get excited about Jews (or any people for that matter) living in houses old or new? As the time of my twenty-eight-day visit was drawing to an end, I felt more comfortable than ever, and the old feeling from 1950 (the year I left) came back: Total ennui with Jews, Socialism, homeland, return, etc. All these feelings of return are nothing but the vulgarization of a much deeper need of returning. It's not a country one can ever return to, but a state of mind that gives you a feeling of inner peace and rest. Where the many return there is much noise, while the private return is a silent affair that takes place inside my head and it matters little whether I carry this head around here or anywhere else. At first instance I thought I had seen him before, not just in pictures but in real life. He looked like he had been a very good chess-player who was now watching the games and shaking his head at wrong moves. He was the old man from the chess table, a kibitzer, but I forgot his name and I don't know the place. Vienna? Zich? London? Amsterdam? New York? He is one of us I felt, a continental Jew, a man who likes talk- ing and playing chess. He was small, a huge potbelly, tearful eyes, his hair not as long as mine. I liked his eyes, blue, probing, sceptical, impatient. I came to disturb him and didn't quite know why. I brought him my book; he glanced through it. I was a totally unim- portant visitor to him, and with nothing to recommend me. What's a book writer after all in the eyes of a retired king? But this is a special kind of king who looks unhappv. I was sure he would never read my book, nor had I ever read much he has written. He wanted to know why I grew my hair long and whether many writers in England had long hair. I said: a lot of people have long hair nowadays. He seemed surprised though his own hair is The Trp fo Jerusalem 85 The Antioch Review</page><page sequence="28">not short trimmed either. Hair has quite a meaning among Jews; the Orthodox have to shave their heads and only grow earlocks, long haired people are frowned upon. All the same, I think Ben Gurion was ready to believe he had a "serious writer" in front of him. What did I want to know? I couldn't think of anything better to provoke him with than by saying: "How can the youth in Israel be idealistically engaged with this country now that Israel is a country just like any other coun- try in the world?" (I can say such things without believing them.) "Israel was founded in 1871 as a lone agricultural station a few miles south of here, called Mikveh Israel. Mikveh Israel was the beginning. Jews had arrived to work the land, not to die here. When I came in 1906, there was still nothing, and all I dreamit of was to see half a million settlers in the country before I died. And look at it now. We have here two and a half million Jews and room for five million more. We have an army, a fleet, industry, universities, life. And youngsters still volunteer for the kibbutz and Nachal (the para-military border settlements) and more people are coming every year." It wasn't news he told me, I realized, but the summary of a philosophical contention. What about the idealism, the Zionism? Nothing has changed. Jews everywhere in the world have now identified themselves with the Zionists. There is room for all of them, we could cope with another five million right away. A famous statement that is ridiculed by most people in the street. I wouldn't have wanted to ask him where he would put the five million. It would have been an impertinence to ask such a ques- tion or a revelation of ignorance and lack of imagination. The coun- try where the impossible seems easy and scepticism ridiculous has this ex-chessmaster and kibitzer in the library of a second-floor, semi- detached house on the Boulevard Keren Kayemeth writing his auto- biography. I have four more years to go and still a few books to finish be- fore I die. To my "until 120" (which is the appropriate Jewish blessing) he had a wry smile, as if I had wished him another forty years of hell in the paradise he had helped create. Was the bitterness in his face linked to the bad moves the new players are making? Or just the pain at losing in the end all games, even those we think we have won? J ust before the outbreak of war, a Swiss scientist by the name of Hoffmann (sounds like Hoffnung) discovered he could produce the very holy fire that ravaged villages in Germany and 86 Spring/ Summer 1972</page><page sequence="29">France in the late Middle Ages. Ergotism means an insane chaos produced by eating the female wheat infected by this toxic fungus. Ergot contains a really dangerous madness: instant religious illumina- tion. The holy fire, as it used to be called, was first produced syn- thetically in Basle. From there it found its way to London and was used by pioneering British psychiatrists to cut down the length of psychoanalysis. A little of this Godliquid helped shell-shocked Amer- ican soldiers to find a way back into their senses. What could have taken the conventional therapist hours, days, weeks and years could be accomplished by lysergic acid in a fraction of the time. In 1958, Dr. Tom Ling, who had been one of the first British doctors to use LSD in psychotherapy during the war, opened up a private clinic in Chelsea. Between October '58 and spring '60 he gave me ten or maybe fourteen injections of lysergic acid (adminis- tered together with Antromorphine "to make the going more gentle"). In each of the twelve rooms of Ling's LSD clinic on St. Leon- ard's Terrace lay one of his patients with icy limbs and hellfire in the skulL There were both day sessions and night sessions. The word trip had not yet been coined nor had the name Leary been heard, either in the United States or in London. Ling's purpose was healing, repairing the inner man. That's why one had to change into pajamas on arrival, go to bed, alone, and wait for the injection. I preferred to come in the mornings, and had to be on time at 9:20 A.M. sharp. The room was small, simply but pleasantly furnished, and a window half open behind drawn curtains allowed a glimpse of a small garden and a high wall overgrown with roses. Should the experience get "out of hand" the press of a button would call a fair, middle-aged woman, the nurse, to bring a cup of tea, two biscuits and the tablets to interrupt the session. Ling usually wore a striped suit; he was tall, hair parted in the middle, a starched white collar, a polka-dotted tie, a white or red carnation in his buttonhole-a city gent who spoke a careful, educated English, just a few words, before he closed the door behind him: "Think of your mother" he would say, or "Have you seen God, Mr. Lind?" Then I was left to myself to sort out the rest. Left to myself within the peace of a cloister, I didn't just think of my mother. This I realized was just a metaphor for childhood and all that had happened before that experience. Mother meant also going back into my mother's mind, not just into her womb (which seemed surprisingly easy), and in this mind of my mother I found what I had been, or must have been seeking, for half my life. To enter my mother and father physically, and their parents The Trip to Jerusalem 87 The Antioch Review</page><page sequence="30">and grandparents, was no trouble: to realize that I was part of their brains, their beliefs, their emotions, their dreams and wishes, was the struggle. The lysergic acid had lifted me outside the magnetic pull of ordinary terrestrial rationalization. I discovered myself to be the offspring of a non-Jewish father of Tartar ancestry-from the tribe of the Khazars-who had settled down to marry a Jewess, the deepest humiliation a free Tartar nomad could experience. The Tartar on horseback riding through an end- less steppe, was I, myself. I dismounted the horse (a beautiful white mare) at a brook, and stayed a night-or two hundred generations- with this woman (my mother, my wife, or what have you) and this woman was Jewish. To settle peacefully is Jewish, to lead a quiet, harmonious, uneventful, holy life is Jewish, and Jewish equals female. I felt that I hated the Jews because they are the mothers-the weak, dependent yet magically powerful species of men. They are different than us. I couldn't stand them. I wanted to be a real, or- dinary man, and a real man will have nothing to do with settling down, with mothers, households, duties, homes, regular occupations, a peaceful and stable life. I hated the Jews because they were bour- geois, boring, humdrum, meek, weak, simple human beings, and not horsemen, warriors, hunters, cowboys, pioneers-in other words, they were the mass of men. Yet it was my mother who got us out of Austria in 1938, just before the doors were shut, because of her courage and tenacity and patience-and courage and tenacity turned out also to be Jewish. The free-riding male, gentile Tartar in me felt trapped among the Jews and by their peculiar fate. It wasn't surprising that I didn't like "them"-and that them meant "the Jews." My hatred for anti- Semites, I discovered, was actually a hatred for Jews, and Jewish anti-Semitism is as old as the phenomenon called "Jew." I needed this fungus called Ergot (from which LSD is derived) to make me see clearly what had been for so many years not just my own sickness, but a condition from which many if not all of us, Jew and Gentile alike, suffer in our hearts. Anti-Semitism cannot be eliminated by only fighting anti-Semites; it needs to be healed at its root, and the root of anti-Semitism is the hatred of what is seem- ingly defenseless and weak, and yet at the same time made of steel, iron and concrete. This strength of the weak has confused innumer- able Jew-haters; the trip to Jerusalem confirmed this truth again. In 1960 I finished my sessions with Dr. Ling without seeing God, and therefore could not understand anything about the true meaning of Jew and Israel. Now there seems not a chance for the world, for our species, for myself, if we don't learn to love this Jerusalem. 88 Spring/ Summer 1 972</page></plain_text>
