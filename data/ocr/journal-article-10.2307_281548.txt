Klesert (Navajo Nation Archaeology Department [NNAD]) directed surface collection and test excavation at 20 sites ranging from Middle Archaic to Anasazi Pueblo III located along the Antelope Point Road (Navajo Route 22B), south of Page. All of the sites (temporary camps) consist predominantly of lithic artifacts with few ceramics and surface feaiures. Larry Benallie (NNAD) surveyed an Indian Health Service water line from Klagetoh to Wide Ruins (Kin- tiel). This survey revealed considerable prehistoric and historic occupation of the area with sites from Bas- ketmaker III through Pueblo III and early Navajo oc- cupation (Kin Nazhin Pueblito, A.D. 1760). Three Chacoan Great houses and a Basketmaker III village with an associated Great Kiva have been located and recorded. Dennis Gilpin (NNAD) has been coordinating anal- ysis of a Basketmaker II site at Lukachukai where wa- ter-line construction exposed an ash lens, two pit struc- tures, five hearths, one bell-shaped pit, and one ash stain. Carol Brandt (Zuni Archaeology Program [ZAP]) analyzed flotation samples in which maize and Cheno- Am seeds were most common, respectively. Radio- carbon dates for the site are 3110 ? 90 B.P. (Beta- 43317) and 3040 ? 90 B.P. (Beta-43318). The Museum of Northern Arizona/Northern Ari- zona University/Oberlin Field School (under the direction of David R. Wilcox and Linda Grimm) investigated sites in three areas of the Kaibab and Pres- cott National Forests. On the Mogollon Rim, two Co- honina ball courts and associated sites dating to ca. A. D. 1000 were identified and mapped. On a site near Sitgreaves Mountain, excavations continued in two al- cove houses, a linear room block, and a deep, 13-m pithouse with central hearth. A large walled plaza site with several large rooms and outside cremation areas was also mapped and surface collected. South of the Grand Canyon, Linda Grimm surface collected and tested a shallow Archaic site. The University of Arizona [UA] Archaeological Field School completed its twenty-eighth season at Grass- hopper in 1990 under the direction of J. Jefferson Reid. Survey activities focused on ceramic variability and population movement during the late A.D. 1200s. Ex- cavations at Grasshopper Spring Pueblo (ca. A.D. 1275- 1300) provided information on an earlier room block occupied by an Anasazi group during the Pueblo II period. Research continued on the rapid social and economic changes that occurred ca. A.D. 1300 involv- 721</page><page sequence="2">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY ing ceramic production and distribution (Nieves Ze- deiio, Daniela Triadan, and Mark Neupert), formation of the ceramic record (Barbara Montgomery), projec- tile-point form and function (Leon Lorentzen), and the shift from hunting/gathering/horticulture to agricul- ture (John Welch and Joe Ezzo). Jeffrey S. Dean, Donald A. Graybill, Gary S. Funk- houser, and William J. Robinson (all Laboratory of Tree-Ring Research, UA) are in the third year of Na- tional Science Foundation (NSF)-sponsored research on dendroclimatic characterization of paleoclimate in the Southwest over the past two millennia. Several thousand tree-ring samples have been procured, and 26 chronologies are in the initial stages of climatic analysis. The chonological grid has been expanded by using bristlecone pine and now covers most of the Southwest and adjacent edges of the Great Basin. Alan P. Sullivan (University of Cincinnati) directed the second season of the Upper Basin Archaeological Research Project. Seven square kilometers in the Kai- bab National Forest south of Grand Canyon National Park were surveyed intensively in 10 days by 13 stu- dents. Sixty-three artifact scatters and 34 sites with surface architectural remains were found. Of the 37 sites recorded in detail, 24 were Anasazi, 5 were Co- honina, and the remainder were mixed. In addition, two piles of fire-cracked rock, "activity areas" between them, and a small feature containing charred pinyon nuts were excavated. Twenty floatation and 13 14C samples were taken for processing. A total of 28 archaeological projects in Arizona was completed by Plateau Mountain Desert Research. Completed and ongoing projects under the direction of Donald E. Weaver, Jr. include intensive surveys of approximately 130 ha along SR89A near Bitter Springs, 187 ha along SR73 near Fort Apache, 78 ha along SR89A near Sedona, and 729 ha in the Kaibab Na- tional Forest near Williams. In addition, Weaver di- rected work at three sites along SR69 near Dewey. These sites included a large pithouse village (eight houses and 10 other features dating to A.D. 700-1100), a small, earlier pithouse village (three houses and two features dating to A.D. 500-900), and a probable campsite (four roasting pits, one storage pit, and one burial dating between A.D. 900 and 1200). This project made the first use in the Dewey area of 14C dating and flotation and pollen analyses. Henry D. Wallace (Desert Archaeology, Inc. [DA]) and James P. Holmlund (Geo-Map [G-M]) developed a predictive model of petroglyph site distribution in the Painted Rock Reservoir area and tested it by spot surveys. The model was found to be effective with 49 petroglyph sites located, 46 of which were previously unreported. An additional 18 sites not containing pet- roglyphs were also recorded including sites with trails, rockshelters, geoglyphs, and habitation areas. The de- signs in the Painted Rock area are primarily affiliated with the Hohokam, Archaic, and Patayan cultural traditions. Intensive survey and petroglyph documen- tation around the southeastern tip of the Gila Bend Mountains resulted in recording 1,187 petroglyph de- signs. Cory Dale Breternitz and Robert I. Birnie (Soil Sys- tems, Inc. [SSI]) report that excavations along Wash- ington Street, north of Pueblo Grande Museum, Phoe- nix, exposed 21 prehistoric features including one inhumation, one cremation, 12 pits, three floor frag- ments, two wall fragments, a pithouse, and a com- pound room. Nineteen features are interpreted as dat- ing to the Classic period, the cremation is dated to the Colonial or Sedentary period, and the pithouse dates to a transitional Sedentary to Classic period (Sacaton to Soho phases). SSI also undertook archaeological test excavations in September 1990 at Pueblo Grande Museum. Testing on the museum grounds exposed 126 prehistoric fea- tures (pithouses, floors, wall fragments), 48 pits, 11 possible burials, and 29 other features (e.g., hearths, trash deposits, etc.). No features were excavated. The majority of these features are tentatively dated to the Colonial and Sedentary periods. Evidence for Classic period occupation is limited primarily to the plow zone. C. D. Breternitz, C. K. Robinson, M. S. Foster, and D. R. Mitchell (SSI) directed analyses on materials recovered from the Hohokam Expressway Project at the Pueblo Grande ruin. Ceramic studies have focused on the intrabasin exchange patterns as documented through petrographic and inductively coupled plasma emission spectroscopy studies. Distinctive temper zones in the Phoenix area have been identified to which par- ticular ceramic wares and types can be linked. One hundred and seventy-eight archaeomagnetic and 30 14C dates were taken, indicating that the site was oc- cupied from the Sacaton phase through the Polveron phase. At the height of the occupation, a number of discrete and semiautonomous habitation areas existed with accompanying burial grounds, all spreading out from the focal part of the site, the large platform mound. Breternitz and Daniel G. Landis (SSI) investigated 43 sites for an AT&amp;T fiber-optic route. The sites in- cluded lithic quarries near Bullhead City, a historical- period site associated with the railroad near Kingman, Archaic and Cohonina sites (some possibly transition- al) near and on the Kaibab Forest, and Sinagua sites on the Coconino Forest near Flagstaff. One Cohonina structure dated to A.D. 760 ? 80 (Beta-40582). A burned Sinagua pithouse was found with the remains of a female, pots, ground stone, corn, and pinyon nuts. This pithouse burned at least 150 years before Sunset Crater erupted. Laurie V. Slawson (Cultural and Environmental Sys- tems, Inc. [CESI]) directed a cultural resources inven- tory of 337 ha in the Silver Bell Mountains, northwest of Tucson, Arizona. A small Hohokam limited activity site and seven historic sites were recorded, including a mining operation, four mining camps, two cemeter- ies, and a trash dump. All of the historical-period sites are associated with mining activities that occurred in the district between the 1880s and the 1930s. Ronald P. Maldonado and Mary Lou Heuett (CESI) directed an assessment of 76 historic buildings along Speedway Boulevard in Tucson prior to a road-wid- ening project. Twelve of these may be eligible for the National Register of Historic Places. The 76 buildings date from 1905 to 1939; most were constructed in the 191 0s and 1920s. Ronald P. Maldonado and Mary Lou Heuett (CESI) directed a cultural resources inventories on a right-of- 722 [Vol. 56, No. 4, 1991]</page><page sequence="3">CURRENT RESEARCH way near Douglas, and 13 prehistoric resource pro- curement camps of the Archaic, Mogollon, and Salado cultures were recorded. Seven historical-period sites of Hispanic, Chinese, and Anglo cultures were recorded. All of these sites may be eligible for the National Reg- ister of Historic Places. Barbara J. Roth (Pima Community College Archae- ology Center) will be excavating three Late Archaic sites in the upper foothills of the Tortolita Mountains in the northern Tucson Basin. Analysis of surface ma- terial indicates that the sites represent either temporary camps or dispersed agricultural settlements. The field- work will involve excavating surface features and lo- cating subsurface features to obtain subsistence data and additional artifacts. Data recovery should help clarify the role of these sites in the Late Archaic set- tlement system and elucidate land-use patterns in the Tucson Basin. Jonathan Mabry (DA) directed test excavations at a multiple occupation, pithouse village site in the west- ern Tucson Basin. At least three subsurface occupation strata, dating to the Archaic and Sedentary Hohokam periods, and two surface occupations, dating to the Tortolita and Tanque Verde Hohokam phases, were found. Hearths, pits, stratified pithouses, and an in- humation were identified in a buried occupation ho- rizon. Excavation of a pithouse yielded lithic artifacts, faunal remains, and charred plant remains, including maize cupules and kernels. Mesquite charcoal from the central hearth yielded a conventional radiocarbon date of 3040 ? 110 B.P. (Beta-39577). Allen Dart and Deborah Swartz (DA) directed the Tohono O'odham Nation's Schuk Toak mitigation project in the Avra Valley. Five Sedentary-Classic pe- riod Hohokam and Protohistoric period O'odham (Upper Piman) sites were excavated, producing data on settlement and subsistence. Of four habitation sites, the two larger sites included a total of seven cultural- feature clusters encompassing one to four pithouses each (total 20), distributed around a 1-ha open space with outdoor-activity features. The sites yielded many animal bones and burned plant remains. One site in a flood zone yielded food-processing features. Allen Dart (DA) and James Holmlund (G-M) di- rected survey on the east face of the Coyote mountains to delineate the boundaries of a complex of large pre- historic sites, including at least five platform mounds and many compound enclosures. James Holmlund prepared detailed instrument maps of most of these sites. Controlled surface collections in the mounds and trash concentrations dated most of the occupations to the Late Rincon, Tanque Verde, and Tucson phases (A.D. 1100-1450). The area was nominated as a Na- tional Register District. William H. Doelle and Allen Dart (DA) directed reconnaissance survey in the lower San Pedro Valley to identify previously unrecorded Hohokam/Salado platform-mound and Sobaipuri O'odham (Upper Pi- man) sites. The 103 sites recorded included one pos- sible platform-mound site, one undisturbed Hohokam village with masonry ball court, and five possible So- baipuri-occupation sites. This survey confirms a pre- vious investigator's suggestions that the lower San Pe- dro Valley saw complex intermixture of the Mogollon- Western Pueblo and the Hohokam traditions during the prehistoric period. Deborah Swartz (DA) directed limited excavations at the Romero Ruin in Catalina State Park to gather information for a planned interpretive trail. Two pre- historic features were tested: a compound wall and a trash mound. The remains of a historical-period struc- ture were also tested. The lowest layer of the trash mound almost exclusively contained plainware and redware ceramics thought to represent the recently de- fined Tortolita phase (A.D. 450-650). This is the first known good stratigraphic context for this phase. The site continued to be occupied until A.D. 1300-1450, and was reoccupied by rancher Francisco Romero in the mid-1800s. Elizabeth Skinner (ZAP) directed backhoe trenching outside site boundaries of 12 prehistoric sites, within the right-of-way of a proposed road on the Sanders- Chambers Trust Lands ("New Lands"). This work was undertaken to determine whether subsurface cultural materials occur beyond the extent of those recognized on the surface, to avoid unanticipated discoveries dur- ing construction, and to compile information on pa- leoenvironmental conditions. Cultural material was found at a depth of 1 m in dune areas with no surface manifestations. The sites range from small sherd and lithic scatters to medium-sized habitation sites, nearly all of them multicomponent, some of which date to the Basketmaker III/Pueblo I period and the late Pueb- lo II period. At Petrified Forest, Ann Trinkle Jones and Jeffery Burton (Western Archaeological and Conservation Center, National Park Service [WACC, NPS]) began a site-monitoring program. In three weeks, 104 localities (17 percent of known park sites) were relocated, in- cluding pueblos, field houses, artifact scatters, pithouse villages, one burial, and one historical-period scatter. Site plots, forms, maps and site-condition observations were updated for the NPS Archaeological Site Inven- tory. Systematic collections of ceramics were made for later studies of ceramic production and exchange in the region. Jeffery Burton (WACC, NPS) reported on salvage excavations at a Late Basketmaker II/Early Basket- maker III pithouse village at Petrified Forest. Two pit- houses were described with many storage features, and results of analyses of artifacts, soil, pollen, flora (maize was ubiquitous), fauna, obsidian, and '4C dates indi- cated use around A.D. 200. These are the earliest known dates for sites solely with Adamana Brown Ware. Six chronometric dates from the Flattop site fall in the same range. Ann Trinkle Jones and Jeffery Burton directed mem- bers of the American Rock Art Research Association in recording about 40 percent of the petroglyphs in the Newspaper Rock Archaeological District at Petrified Forest. At seven loci, nearly 2,000 elements on 83 boulders were photographed and sketched. Most of the art probably dates A.D. 950-1200, although there were some of Archaic style and others of Pueblo IV style. Six studies of pollen records from southwestern ar- chaeological site contexts were completed at the Pal- ynology Laboratory of the Department of Anthropol- ogy, Arizona State University (ASU). Analysis by 723</page><page sequence="4">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY Michael M. Gregory (ASU) of 13 surface and 49 sub- surface samples from Shoofly Ruin suggests the tem- poral ordering of a number of rooms. Gary Cantley (ASU) completed three investigations in the Hohokam area. The study of one site sponsored by the Phoenix Chapter of the Arizona Archaeological Society suggests that the site occupants practiced both agriculture and gathering. Two studies of the palynology of a rock-pile field site in the Santan Mountains, one sponsored by Archaeological Consulting Service, conclude that the field was constructed during the Classic period, fulfilled an agricultural function, and was not a locus for pro- duction of maize, squash or cotton. Agave production is not ruled out, but agave pollen was not recovered. James Schoenwetter (ASU) produced a report on the palynology of the Zuni-area Hinkson site. This study suggests applicability of the Colorado Plateau Pollen Chronology to assist intrasite dating, notes the presence of cotton pollen, and argues for the construction of agricultural terraces at a locale unusually suited for early crop maturation. Schoenwetter and Virginia M. Betz also undertook study of alluvial pollen-sequence data to coordinate with Michael Waters's (Texas A&amp;M) and Glen Rice's (ASU) work on Salado paleoenviron- ments in the Tonto Creek Basin. They suggest that interpretive problems encountered during the past 20 years' study of Arizona Transition Zone pollen records can be overcome by application of numeric approaches to the analysis of larger pollen counts. COLORADO. Crow Canyon Archaeological Cen- ter (CCAC) completed the third field season of its site- testing program, using a stratified random sample to test Pueblo III period sites in the Sand Canyon locality. Goals of the project are to identify datable (burned) structures, to obtain artifact and ecofact assemblages for intersite comparative studies, and estimate total artifact populations in order to measure the length of site occupation. Mark Varien and Kristin Kuckelman (CCAC) di- rected field work at two sites near Sand Canyon Pueblo in upper Sand Canyon. Both sites are on talus slopes, and each has two kivas, associated surface rooms, and trash areas. A burned kiva was found at the site nearest the enclosing wall of Sand Canyon Pueblo. Tree-ring dates indicate construction after A.D. 1270. Jim Kleidon and Ricky Lightfoot (CCAC) conducted test excavations on three sites in lower Sand Canyon near its confluence with McElmo Creek. Kleidon tested a small cliff dwelling and an isolated tower with the rubble of a single room nearby. Test excavations re- vealed pit structures (kivas) not visible at the surface. The cliff dwelling had a burned kiva, at least four rooms, and a deep midden. The tower-kiva site might have had a specialized function. Lightfoot tested the Castle Rock site, a small village with an estimated 50-60 rooms and 12-15 kivas. The site is bounded by an alignment of stones and boulders and has two open- plaza areas bounded by architecture. A single room on top of the central butte may have served as a lookout, and a petroglyph panel shows three anthropomorphic figures with bows and arrows. Bruce A. Bradley (CCAC) is in the process of com- pleting a major report covering the first six years of research at Sand Canyon Pueblo. Tree-ring dating and architectural construction sequences indicate that this large late Pueblo III site was built and used in the last half of the thirteenth century and may have been pre- planned at the level of functional site zoning. Abundant artifact-abandonment assemblages are being compared to architectural interpretations to define better the uses of structures and architectural units. Michelle Hegmon (Conservation Analytical Labo- ratory, Smithsonian Institution and CCAC) conducted petrographic and chemical (instrumental neutron ac- tivation) analyses of Pueblo I (ninth century) white- ware ceramics. Specifically, Mesa Verde-region ma- terial from the Dolores Archaeological Program and the Duckfoot site, and Kayenta region material from the Black Mesa Archaeological Project were analyzed. Results indicate that many white wares in both regions were locally made at a fairly small scale (at many sites), though local exchange is also likely. Karen R. Adams and Mark Hovezak initiated a new environmental Archaeology Division at CCAC. They started a number of projects in the modern environ- ment to evaluate supply and distribution of native plant resources (construction timbers, fuels, foods) com- monly encountered in archaeological sites in the region. They received permission from Mesa Verde National Park to begin a five-year ecological and ethnobotanical study of vegetation recovery following natural fires. They are currently developing assemblage formation studies. These modern perspectives complement a rap- idly accumulating data base from CCAC-excavated sites. Archaeologists from CCAC spent six weeks con- ducting an intensive archaeological survey of 300 ha of federal lands between East Rock Creek and Sand Canyon Drainages in Montezuma County. A total of 34 prehistoric and historical-period sites was recorded. Of note are at least six instances of probable Anasazi ceramic kiln features, all of which appear to date be- tween A.D. 1150 and 1300. The survey was supported by funding from the Bureau of Land Management and Crow Canyon, and adds to Crow Canyon's ongoing research on cultural resources in the Sand Canyon/ Rock Creek locale. Carla Van West (Washington State University and CCAC) developed a high-resolution model of potential agricultural productivity and sustainable population for a 1,816-km2 area of southwestern Colorado, A.D. 901-1300. Tree-ring-based reconstructions of Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI) were used in conjunc- tion with soil productivity studies and GIS technology to quantify and depict annually varying agricultural conditions. Results indicated there was always suffi- cient productive land minimally to support 21 persons/ km2 in the study area, suggesting that local climatic variability was never so extreme that decreased agri- cultural production can be cited as the sole or even primary cause of the thirteenth-century depopulation of the Mesa Verde heartland. Rand Greubel and Alan Reed (Alpine Archaeolog- ical Consultants, Inc.) directed a survey for future man- agement planning of approximately 1,656 ha surround- ing Hovenweep National Monument in Colorado and 724 [Vol. 56, No. 4, 1991]</page><page sequence="5">CURRENT RESEARCH Utah. Most of the 373 sites recorded were Pueblo II- III, although Archaic, Basketmaker II and III, Pueblo I, and historic Navajo sites and components were lo- cated. Few resources demonstrably dating to the pro- tohistoric period were recorded. Site densities averaged slightly over 22 per square kilometer. The data suggest a trend toward a late Pueblo III settlement shift from loosely aggregated mesa-top communities to canyon- head and rimrock habitation sites. Philip Duke (Fort Lewis College [FLC]) directed an archaeological survey sponsored by the National For- est Service, the Four Comers School of Outdoor Ed- ucation, and the Sierra Club. The class II survey was of portions of the continental divide in the Grenadier Range area of the Weminuche Wilderness. Isolated lithics were found, as well as the remains of early min- ing (European) and Hispanic aspen art. The project was intended to provide training for members of the public in survey and archaeological conservation, as well as to provide baseline data for the area. Philip Duke and Mona Charles (FLC) directed a survey and test excavation of portions of the San Juan National Forest by the Fort Lewis College Field School. Excavations at one site (at about 2,438 m asl) recovered Archaic and Late Period components as well as an extensive Anasazi component. The base of a scarred tree, used by the historic Ute for a variety of resources was also excavated. Analysis of the material is ongoing and includes obsidian-source studies. Patricia Robins Flint (Flint Research Associates) conducted excavations and survey on private land 1.6 km north of Mesa Verde National Park. Of 22 sites located so far on 40.5 ha, two have been partially ex- cavated. Most of the sites appear to have been occupied ca. A.D. 1050-1175 (Pueblo II, early Pueblo III) judg- ing from ceramic typological cross dating. Excavations have revealed a distinctive architectural technique of using large upright sandstone boulders in masonry structures, a construction method usually associated with earlier Pueblo I Anasazi structures. The infor- mation from these sites is adding data to support the theory of a Pueblo II population expansion in the Mon- tezuma Valley east of Cortez. NEW MEXICO. Neal W. Ackerly and Sally J. Lee (Center for Anthropological Research, New Mexico State University [CAR, NMSU]) compiled a bibliog- raphy of approximately 500 major cultural-resource- management reports (survey and excavation) in the state of New Mexico for the years 1970-1990. For the survey reports, only those which covered more than 259 ha (640 acres) were annotated. The volume is now under consideration for publication by the state of New Mexico. Ackerly directed a mixed 100 percent block survey and 25 percent sample quadrat survey of 1,101 ha by the NMSU Field School. The area was adjacent to the Isaack's Lake Playa at the southern terminus of the Jomada del Muerto. A total of 22 sites and 148 isolated occurrences was recorded. The sites consisted mainly of lithic scatters and sherd/lithic/fire-cracked-rock con- centrations. Most of the sites appear to date to the A.D. 500-1450 period. Pollen spectra from Isaack's Lake Playa postdating 3290 ? 80 B.P. (Beta-39044) show significant changes in vegetation. Ackerly also directed a historic buildings inventory of 33 buildings located in the Alameda Depot Historic District in Las Cruces, New Mexico. In addition, ar- chival and courthouse research was conducted in order to determine changes in property ownership and his- toric land use. Architectural changes were related to the arrival of Anglos and rail transport in the late 1800s. Under Ackerly's direction the center also completed a Research Orientation, Projection, and Evaluation Study (ROPES) for the Mimbres Resource Area of the Las Cruces Office of the Bureau of Land Management. The study showed that Dona Ana County has been disproportionately examined during project surveys. A high priority area for future study is Hidalgo County. The report summarizes the characteristics of archae- ological sites throughout the Mimbres Resource Area. The Office of Archaeological Studies at the Museum of New Mexico (MNM) continues to be active in re- cording cultural resources for the Abandoned Mine Lands Bureau across the state. In 1990, 14 projects in 10 counties documented historic coal, silver, lead, ura- nium, copper, calcite, and tungsten mine sites. Docu- mentation and recording included entire mining camps, mills, loadouts, adits, and abandoned equipment. David A. Phillips, Jr., Jeffrey L. Boyer, and Daisy F. Levine (MNM) directed testing at a Hispanic home- stead and five prehistoric (A.D. 1100-1300) artifact scatters on state Road 518. The sites were severely disturbed by underground utilities with no further work recommended. A semisubterranean structure and mid- den were found at the homestead. Data recovery at the site will define temporal, functional, and spatial rela- tions between the site features in order to determine site-formation sequences and processes and will in- clude archaeological and ethnohistorical investiga- tions. James L. Moore (MNM) directed test excavations at three sites near Abiquiu' and nine sites near San Ildefonso. The Abiquiu' sites included a lithic scatter and two Classic period farming complexes with gravel- mulched grids, contour terraces, and check dams. Pol- len analysis indicates that corn and cotton were grown at these sites. Near San Ildefonso, a quarry, an Archaic site with five occupational levels, three mixed Basket- maker II and Anasazi artifact scatters, two Anasazi artifact scatters, an Anasazi field house, and a Spanish Colonial homestead with a trash pit were tested. Daniel Wolfman (principle investigator) and Adisa Willmer (MNM) are directing "The Jemez Mountains Chronology Study" under contract from the Santa Fe National Forest. The objectives of the study are to increase knowledge of prehistoric periods, date sites more accurately, and test the usefulness of dating tech- niques in the Jemez Mountains with recommendations for further research. Due to the location of major ob- sidian quarries and the abundance of artifacts made from this material in the study area, particular atten- tion is being paid to obsidian hydration and the pos- sibility that different sources were used at different times. Yvonne R. Oakes (MNM) directed excavations at 18 sites from the Middle Archaic through the Late Pueblo periods between the Pine Lawn Valley and Luna. 725</page><page sequence="6">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY A buried Middle to Late Archaic pit structure, asso- ciated storage pits, faunal remains, milling stones, and over 16,000 lithic artifacts have been found, including approximately 100 San Pedro and a few Chiricahua projectile points. As the preservation of the site is ex- cellent, investigators hope to answer questions about Archaic subsistence in the Mogollon Highlands. Stephen S. Post (MNM) excavated two sites 45 km west of Albuquerque that yielded small and large pit structures with extramural features that roughly date between A.D. 750 and 850 and 1150 and 1200. Initial evidence suggests that a component at one of these sites may be the earliest Pueblo period site excavated in the area. The research efforts are focusing on oc- cupation duration, seasonality, subsistence strategies, and mobility during the middle to late Pueblo I period. Regge N. Wiseman (OAS) excavated a thirteenth- fourteenth-century pithouse village at Roswell. Find- ings include 10 small, shallow, circular-to-oval pit- houses, extramural pits and hearths, a deep rectangular religious structure with a horned/plumed serpent wall painting and a subfloor deposit of ceremonial signifi- cance, and limited trash. The pottery and rectangular structure are late Jornada Mogollon in nature, but the small pithouses do not represent the Jornada pattern. The possibility of a Plains hunter-gatherer affiliation is being investigated, though Plains artifacts are vir- tually absent. Wolcott Toll (MNM) directed excavations at two sites in La Plata Valley as part of an ongoing highway mitigation project. Most of one site lies outside the right-of-way, but the edges of three Pueblo II room blocks were exposed, including part of a large circular structure with possible cross walls. The other site had a large Pueblo II-III structure superimposed on a late Basketmaker III occupation. The 1990 Southern Methodist Archaeological Field School at the Fort Burgwin Research Center continued excavations at Pot Creek Pueblo under the direction of Patricia Crown (now ASU). In continuing efforts to date the aggregation at large pueblos in the Taos area, subfloor excavations were undertaken in Unit 6. A series of single-story structures underlie the latest two- story rooms, but tree-ring samples failed to produce any cutting dates. Rosanna Ridings continued her in- vestigation of the effect of effective hydration temper- ature on obsidian-hydration dates from sites in the area. David Crass completed his dissertation on fron- tier economies using data from Cantonment Burgwin. James Schoenwetter (ASU) conducted a study com- paring modern and site-context historic pollen records from the Acoma Reservation. This study demonstrates that palynological "signatures" may be identified to distinguish the modern pollen rains of irrigated and nonirrigated pastures, of grazed and ungrazed lands, and of irrigated cornfields. Occurrence of these signa- tures in historic site-context pollen records is consistent with historical records. Jonathan E. Reyman (Illinois State University) com- pleted the collection and computer entry of the un- published field notes and other records of George H. Pepper and Richard Wetherill. These materials are from the Hyde Expedition at Chaco Canyon (1886-1899), and several later projects (1900-1905). When pub- lished, a vast amount of primary data previously un- available will significantly alter researchers' under- standing of the history of Chacoan archaeology and the prehistory of Chaco, especially Pueblo Bonito. Dabney Ford and Thomas C. Windes (NPS) contin- ued the Chaco Wood Project. Over three years, 750 of 1,500 pieces of wood have been sampled at Pueblo del Arroyo, and 550 new tree-ring dates are being added to the previous 46. Two building periods were evident: the initial central core of rooms in A.D. 1078 and then a massive addition in A.D 1100-1104 to complete the main building. Some construction at about A.D 915 at Penasco Blanco and in the 11 20s at Pueblo Bonito has also been verified. Windes directed an interagency group in continued investigations at the East Chaco community. About 20 percent of the 50 houses and public architectural units have been mapped and dated. The community of small houses and a great house began in the Early Bonito phase in the A.D 900s but was smaller in the A.D. 1000s and early 11 00s with much reuse in the 1200s. Massive architectural additions were not made to the A.D. 900s great house in the 1000s and 1100s, unlike those in nearby Chaco Culture National Historical Park, although it saw continued use. Dennis Gilpin (NNAD) investigated a cluster of An- asazi agricultural features exposed during excavation of a sewer lagoon at Toadlena. One site consisted of an irrigation ditch, five hearths, two postholes, and ceramic and chipped-stone artifacts. Ceramics indicate a date of about A.D. 900. The site is significant because its date and its location, ca. 18 km from the nearest identified Chacoan Community, suggest that irrigation was being practiced on the Chuska Slope earlier and more commonly than previously thought. Joseph C. Winter (Office of Contract Archaeology, University of New Mexico [OCA/UNM]) is the prin- cipal investigator working with various project direc- tors on a major series of surveys, excavations, ethno- logical studies, and related research, in association with the construction of the San Juan Basin/Transwestern Pipeline, from Bloomfield to Needles, California. To date, 244 archaeological sites and 43 significant current cultural properties have been identified, with many of the test sites excavated. Due to the length of the pipe- line transect (805 km) and the many cultural and en- vironmental zones crossed by it, the overall research theme for the project is a study of culture variation. Carl Phagan will direct full-scale excavations and re- search throughout 1991. The following studies have been carried out to date. Charles Amsden (OCA/UNM) directed a survey of a pipeline route from Bloomfield to Gallup across Chacra Mesa. Thirty-five Anasazi, 28 Navajo, 9 ac- eramic sites, and 29 current cultural locations were identified. Due to the heavy concentration of Pueblo sites on Chacra Mesa and around the Casamero Great House community, plans for this pipeline route were dropped. Amsden also directed survey and excavation west of Chaco Canyon where 32 Anasazi, 24 aceramic, 1 Gob- ernador phase Navajo, and 10 twentieth-century Nav- ajo sites were identified. Fred York (OCA/UNM) in- vestigated 24 significant current cultural properties 726 [Vol. 56, No. 4, 1991]</page><page sequence="7">CURRENT RESEARCH including nine graves, one plant and one mineral-gath- ering area, several Enemy Way ceremonial sites, six agricultural locations, and seven residences and related structures. Jane Bradley (OCA/UNM) directed survey and ex- cavations from Gallup to Needles. Twenty-seven An- asazi, 21 Sinagua, 20 Patayan, 31 aceramic, and 12 Euroamerican (including the gold-mining towns of Gold Road and Vivian, and Beale's Wagon Road) sites were recorded (many were tested). Orit Tamir (OCA/UNM) investigated 19 significant current cultural locations along the route, including seven possible eagle-catching sites, four Enemy Way and other ceremonial locations, several fields, 10 residences, and related structures, and the San Francisco Peaks ritual area. Frank Wozniak and John Poncinzki (OCA/UNM) carried out a remote-sensing study of both pipeline routes. One Chacoan road, near the Standing Rock Anasazi Great House community, was identified through aerial reconnaissance, while four buried sites were discovered through a nonsite trenching program. Mike Marshall and Frank Wozniak (OCA/UNM) directed survey of 130 ha at the mouth of Cebolla Canyon, focusing on the Cebolla Canyon Anasazi. Fif- ty-one sites were recorded, including one Basketmaker II, 13 Pueblo I/Early Pueblo II, 12 Middle Pueblo III, and 10 Late Pueblo III components (the most intensive occupation of the area). One of the Middle Pueblo II (A.D. 1050-1125) sites is a great house with an asso- ciated kiva and aureola, while five Pueblo III (A.D. 1175-1325) sites are large compound or plaza sites. Jeanne A. Schutt with Richard C. Chapman (prin- cipal investigator) (OCA/UNM) directed excavations at 11 sites dating from the Late Archaic through the Classic Mimbres phase in the Cuchillo Negro Drainage near Truth or Consequences. Radiocarbon dates iden- tified three occupations: Early Pithouse phase (A.D. 450), Georgetown phase (A.D. 620), and Classic Mimbres (A.D. 1000). Twenty-eight dates were recov- ered from a multicomponent village site consisting of a Georgetown phase circular community structure, 10 pithouses, and 5 noncontiguous surface rooms dating to the Classic Mimbres phase. Seven dates were from an Early Pithouse phase village site, and 14 were from seven smaller sites. Schutt and Chapman also tested along Alameda Boulevard in Albuquerque prior to the proposed wid- ening of the roadway. Three areas with intact historic (Alameda School site [A.D. 1539-1680], Alameda Pla- za [A.D. 1710-1903]) and prehistoric (Pueblo III-IV period, Alameda School site) cultural remains were found. Richard Lang (Southwest Archaeological Consult- ants [SWAC]) completed data recovery along an in- terpretive trail through Poshu'ouinge, one of several large Classic period villages located within the Chama River basin claimed as ancestral sites by the modem Tewa. The ruin forms the principal element of the Poshu'ouinge Archaeological District, which includes associated lithic and ceramic scatters, agricultural fea- tures, shrines, and a rock-art site. Over 2,800 artifacts were collected. A long history of use for the site is suggested, potentially beginning with a Basketmaker II occupation, extending into Basketmaker III, and fol- lowed some centuries later by possible use at the time of the initial Puebloan expansion into the Chama Val- ley. Later components are affiliated with the settlement of Poshu'ouinge. Lonyta Viklund and Jan Biella (SWAC) directed ex- cavations at a large, multicomponent lithic scatter on lands owned by Los Alamos National Laboratory in the Jemez Mountains. Dates from 28 obsidian-hydra- tion samples indicate the site was occupied from the Archaic through the Basketmaker periods, and in the thirteenth century. Ceramic analysis supports the thir- teenth-century dates. Obsidian sources were identified by composition to be Obsidian Ridge and Cerro del Medio. Cherie L. Scheick and Frances Levine (SWAC) are writing a cultural-resource overview for the Santa Fe National Forest. This work will provide a synthesis of recent archaeological and cultural-historical data from both the Jemez and Pecos areas of the forest, and from the central northern Rio Grande Valley with relation to developments in areas on both sides of the river. The history of forest use can best be seen as one of exploitation by diverse user groups with interactions marked by a theme of competition and alliance. This theme provides a perspective for interpreting the marked variability in cultural use and adaptation to the forest, starting with its earliest use. Viklund completed four cultural-resource surveys from the piedmonts above the Santa Fe River to the foothills of the Sangre de Cristo Mountains. Over 607 ha were surveyed, and 33 sites were located. Sites ranged from large quarries, lithic-processing loci, to a camp- site. Although many sites cannot be dated, Archaic, Basketmaker, and late Coalition/Classic Pueblo re- mains were identified. All of the sites showed marked similarity and identify an important resource-procure- ment area within a larger settlement system. Viklund and Lang tested and excavated 12 artifact scatters in the foothills of the Sangre de Cristo Moun- tains. Sites included quarries (exposed chert/chalced- ony veins), lithic-processing areas, and campsites. Sample collections yielded over 20,000 artifacts, more than one-half of which were shatter. Formal tools were rare, and almost one-half of the flakes showed use of some kind. From the preliminary analyses and obsid- ian-hydration dates, the sites were classified multicom- ponent (Archaic, Basketmaker, Classic, and modem). Vicklund also conducted four cultural-resource surveys near or on the Galisteo Basin. Two surveys yielded 19 sites (including field houses and multicomponent ar- tifact scatters) over 364 ha. Most sites were from the Coalition through Classic periods, with a few from the Developmental period. Two other surveys of 38 ha identified two pueblos of over 20 rooms and a sub- stantial Puebloan presence predating Galisteo Pueblo (of the Classic period to protohistoric). In addition, Vicklund surveyed 296 ha of land north- west of Milan, recording 33 sites from the Early Ar- chaic (35 percent of the sites) through Basketmaker III/ Early Puebloan (9 percent), and some of later Puebloan and Historic periods. Five sites had structural remains (mainly historical period), and Archaic and Puebloan scatters with hearths and pits may have been camp- sites. The majority of sites were multicomponent lim- 727</page><page sequence="8">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY ited-activity sites associated with plant-food collecting and processing. The density of sites suggested inten- sive, long-term use of the inner basin. Cherie L. Scheick (SWAC) excavated 17 sites north- west of San Mateo ranging from the Archaic period to the Historic period. Research focused on (1) cultural- temporal affiliation, (2) land use and subsistence prac- tices, (3) settlement strategies, and (4) population or- igins. The use of the area apparently focused on wild plant resources. The size of prehistoric settlements sug- gested small groups (Puebloans may have come from the Red Mesa Valley), and historical-period sites re- flected specialized winter use except for one Hispanic homestead occupied ca. 1900-1930. Scheick also excavated a site in the South Lease of the McKinley mine with an eight-room pueblo, plaza, pit structure, midden, and two single-room (storage) structures from the turn of the twelfth century. The pueblo was occupied seasonally between A.D. 1110 and 1170-1180. There may have been year-round oc- cupation at its height. About A.D. 1140-1150 a group (possibly from the San Juan Basin) arrived, as evi- denced by dramatic changes in ceramics and architec- ture. Timothy Keams (Division of Conservation Archae- ology) directed survey for an El Paso Natural Gas line from Bloomfield to Twin Lakes. The pedestrian survey documented 117 sites and 220 isolated occurrences within a 92.7-km-long corridor. Archaic, Basketmaker II and III, Pueblo I and II, and Navajo sites were found including Chacoan road segments and three Chacoan Great House communities. Another road segment west from the Escalan Great House was documented in de- tail. Approximately 3,000 artifacts were piece plotted, and 17 road-related features were documented. For one month each year, Richard Bice has con- ducted the excavation of the Vidal site by the Archae- ological Society of New Mexico Summer Field School. The site consists of a great kiva, ca. A.D. 1100-1150, built over a large kiva; an earlier small kiva (excavation complete) with some associated surface rooms, ca. A.D. 980; and several still-earlier pithouses, currently un- dated. In 1990, the west half of the great kiva was exposed to below wall fall, the surface-room outlines were better defined and auger samples suggest that more pithouses are present than were previously known. Mark Sant, Galen Burgett, and Elizabeth Skinner (all ZAP) conducted data-recovery investigations at six historic Navajo and 10 prehistoric sites (Basketmaker III/Pueblo I period) along the N30/N31 road near Mexican Springs. Ten hogan rings/foundations, one sweatlodge, two brush structures, and a number of pit features were excavated at the historic sites. Twelve pit structures, four surface room blocks, over 40 pit features, and a number of burials have been excavated at the prehistoric sites. Stratigraphic evidence suggests that most of the prehistoric sites were reoccupied, with differential use of space through time and abandoned pit structures used as refuse-disposal areas. Craig Birrell and Roger Anyon (principal investi- gator) (ZAP) supervised the recording and analysis of houses in the Pueblo of Zuni in the fall of 1990. This work, funded by a Housing and Urban Development Community Development Block Grant, is part of on- going research at ZAP focusing on the architectural documentation of Zuni structures. A total of 24 houses was slated for rehabilitation. All external elevations were photo documented and drawn in profile. The wall elements, openings, and house plan views were also recorded. The ASU Field School, directed by Keith Kintigh, continued research on prehistoric population aggre- gation and social integration at the site of Heshotauth- la, on the Zuni Indian Reservation. Heshotauthla, a nucleated pueblo with about 500 ground-floor rooms, was first excavated by Cushing in the 1880s. Excava- tions along the outside wall of the pueblo exposed a series of extramural ovens. Deposits in deep rooms indicate a long occupation span for the site, from per- haps A.D. 1275 to 1375. Systematic survey of an ad- jacent canyon revealed an extraordinary density of oc- cupation between ca. A.D. 1100 and 1275. Recorded sites include what appears to be a previously unrec- ognized Chacoan outlier with an associated commu- nity (Leslie Spier's Site 81) and a tight cluster of Pueblo III room blocks near the canyon mouth. Winifred Creamer (Northern Illinois University) and Jonathan Haas (Field Museum of Natural History) tested 26 of 39 room blocks at San Marcos Pueblo in the northern Rio Grande Valley to determine the rel- ative date of abandonment of room blocks and to re- cover samples of ceramics from the terminal occupa- tion of the site. Preliminary results of the ongoing analysis indicate that the site was used sequentially with fewer than half the room blocks in use simulta- neously and had a smaller population than that tra- ditionally estimated. Subsequent research will be aimed at determining whether the site was abandoned be- tween each construction episode. Jeffrey L. Boyer (Consulting Archaeologist) exca- vated a Hispanic torreon site. Radiocarbon, ceramic, and dendrochronology-intercept dates indicate use be- tween A.D. 1740 and 1850. Historic data show that the site could not date before the 1740s and that the modern plaza was established in the early 1800s. These data suggest the presence of scattered Hispanic farms and ranchos along the Arroyo Seco in the 1700s. They support an argument concerning so-called "isolated" torreones and the time frame of these features of dis- persed Hispanic settlement. Lance K. Trask (Maxwell Museum, UNM) is co- ordinating a joint project between the Maxwell Mu- seum and the Santa Fe National Forest Jemez Ranger District to record petroglyphs, pictographs, and related features in the forest. William Whatley continues to direct the Kwastiukwa Interdisciplinary Archaeological Research Project in the documentation of one of the largest prehistoric sites in America. Materials and work are all volunteered. Records are being taken at the scientific, Native Amer- ican, and aesthetic levels without disturbing the site (in the Jemez mountains). Results will be presented as a documentary for PBS, in a hardback publication, and as an educational symposium focusing on children. Eileen Camilli and James I. Ebert (Ebert and As- sociates) conducted an intensive distributional survey 728 [Vol. 56, No. 4, 1991]</page><page sequence="9">CURRENT RESEARCH of a 250-km2 unit near Socorro to test a computer system for distributional survey sponsored by the NSF Small Business Innovation Research grants program. The area was surveyed at a 5-m-transect interval, and the 3,264 artifacts found were flagged and precisely located with Lietz-Sokkisha electronic distance-mea- surement equipment. They were coded by a crew of five in three weeks using field-hardened Husky com- puters equipped with specially designed software in- corporating a branching decision structure. UTAH. Alan D. Reed (Alpine Archaeological Consultants, Inc. [AAC]) directed excavations of five sites previous to construction of the Halls Crossing Airport. Chert pebbles scattered over the area were used for Archaic and Anasazi lithics reduced from bi- polar cores. Structures and cultural features were ab- sent. The discovery of nonlocal lithic materials and a small number of prepared stone tools and potsherds indicated that a limited set of activities beyond lithic- material procurement occurred at the sites. Jonathon C. Horn (AAC), under contract to the Utah Department of Transportation, conducted data-recov- ery excavations at two sites in advance of road con- struction between St. George and Hurricane. One was an open site with Southern Paiute and Pueblo II-III Virgin Anasazi components. The other site was a rock- shelter with Southern Paiute materials dating from ca. A.D. 1532 to modem times. Among the Southern Pai- ute ceramics, a vessel with fingernail impressions and diagonal scored lines was a previously unrecorded vari- ation. Alan R. Schroedl (P-III Associates, Inc. [P-III]) ex- cavated Horse Canyon Rockshelter in southern Utah. This stratified site contained 1.3 m of deposits with four distinct components, two dating to the late Ar- chaic, one to the Late Prehistoric, and one to the Pro- tohistoric. Twenty-one slab-lined and unlined hearths and pit features, most dating to the Late Archaic, were excavated. Four features produced stratigraphically correct radiocarbon dates the oldest of which is 2760 ? 100 B.P. (Beta-35319). This site apparently func- tioned as a field camp for hunters and gatherers throughout its occupation. Betsy L. Tipps (P-III) excavated portions of 11 sites along the Burr Trail Road. The sites were occupied by Archaic, Anasazi, Fremont, and Numic peoples. Two open-air, Middle Archaic sites had clusters of cooking and storage pits. An aceramic, Late Archaic site had a pithouse with projectile points and wood superstruc- ture remains preserved. The calibrated tree-ring date range was A.D. 426-542. Project research focused on chronological concerns and resource procurement and use, particularly of resources used to manufacture lithic tools. Joel C. Janetski and James D. Wilde (Office of Public Archaeology, Brigham Young University) directed ex- cavations at Aspen Shelter on Old Woman Plateau to test predictions about shifting strategies at the site from Archaic to Formative times. Radiocarbon dates from 1989 and 1990 document sporadic use from 4000 to 1300 B.P. Work in 1990 defined two small, basin- shaped structures at the basal level of the shelter dated to 4000 B.P. Both structures contained a small central hearth and reflector stone. Floor contact artifacts in- cluded Gypsum points, scrapers, bone awls, and ground stone. Abundant deer bone suggested a fall occupation. NORTHERN MEXICO. Michael Foster (SSI) is currently analyzing materials recovered from test ex- cavations at Santa Ana, a large Chalchihuites site lo- cated near Zape in northern Durango. The site was excavated in the 1960s by J. Charles Kelley and is thought to date between A.D. 1200 and 1400. The Zape area is the northernmost enclave of the Loma San Ga- briel and Chalchihuites cultures and is cited as a pos- sible major node on a north-south trade route linking northern Mexico to the American Southwest. Robert D. Leonard MESOAMERICA MEXICO. George A. Agogino (Eastern New Mex- ico University) reports that his research, begun in 1980, supports Manuel Moreno's belief that Mixcaltitlan in Nayarit corresponds to the lagoon island in the west that the Aztec claimed as their ancient home. The name Mixcaltitlan translates to "Homeland of the Mexi- cans," and the street pattern today is reminiscent of Tenochtitlan. The site is located in a lagoon crowded with reeds and herons, as Aztlan was claimed to be. Helen Pollard (Michigan State University [MSU]) undertook survey and test excavation at Urichu, Mi- choacan, a Tarascan administrative settlement, with funding from the National Geographic Society [NGS] and the Wenner-Gren Foundation. Excavations in- cluded deeply stratified areas and a series of intact elite burials, and analysis of the excavated materials should provide a ceramic sequence from the Late Classic to the early Colonial period, along with a definition of elite material culture spanning the period from before the rise of the Tarascan state to Postconquest times. Metal artifacts from the burials are under study by Dorothy Hosler (Massachusetts Institute of Technol- ogy [MIT]). XRF analysis of more than 400 obsidian artifacts from Tzintzuntzan and five fortified sites along the Tarascan-Aztec frontier by Pollard and Thomas Vogel (MSU) indicate acquisition of obsidian from Zinap6cuaro-Ucareo (gray), C. Zinaparo (red), C. Varal (clear), Pachuca, Hidalgo, and a variety of sources in Jalisco (green). Pollard and Anthony Aveni (Colgate University) confirmed that a major ceremonial com- pound at Ihuatzio is aligned to the cardinal directions; discovery of a sight line due east from the ball court to the midpoint between a pair of hills appears to con- firm an ethnohistorical reference to the scheduling of a fall festival in relation to sunrise location. Thomas H. Charlton (University of Iowa), Cynthia L. Otis Charlton, Deborah L. Nichols (Dartmouth Col- lege) and their colleagues continue the study of mate- rials from the Aztec city-state of Otumba. Analyses of soils, macrobotanical remains, obsidian and other chipped stone, ground stone, spindle whorls and whorl molds, figurines and figurine molds, lapidary tools and 729</page><page sequence="10">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY debris, and ceramics are designed to assess the role of craft production and agricultural intensification. Statistical analysis of domestic-artifact assemblages from the rural Late Postclassic sites of Cuexomate and Capilco in western Morelos by Michael E. Smith (State University of New York [SUNY]-Albany) suggest that Aztec conquest of the region had little effect on rural social and economic patterns by comparison with local processes of elite dynamics, population growth, and agricultural intensification (terracing). Dorothy Hosler (MIT) has undertaken laboratory analysis of 48 metal artifacts from the two sites-mainly chisels, awls, nee- dles, and other small hand tools of the sort that are prevalent in West Mexico after A.D. 1200-as part of her research on the evolution of mesoamerican met- allurgy. All of the artifacts are bronze alloys (copper- tin, copper-arsenic, and a ternary alloy of copper, ar- senic, and tin), indicating that metalsmiths were taking advantage of the superior mechanical properties of the alloys to produce thinner, harder tools. These data are included in ARMQUIT, a custom data base developed by Nate Osgood (MIT). Archaeologists from the Centro Regional de Morelos (Instituto Nacional de Antropologia e Historia [INAH]) are continuing excavation of a large Late Postclassic platform in Yautepec in conjunction with the Sociedad Cultural Yautepec. D. A. Peterson (Institute of Oaxaca Studies, Uni- versity of the Americas) has completed a study of the Main Plaza at Monte Alban. His analysis of Building J indicates that an earlier pointed structure in the same location was oriented to the 10 November and 2 Feb- ruary antizenith sunset point and that an earlier eastern stair was aligned with the 8 May and 5 August zenith passage sunrise. Joyce Marcus (University of Michigan [UM]) has completed a study of the entire corpus of Zapotec carved stone monuments from the Valley of Oaxaca. The Mu- seum of Anthropology (UM) will publish the corpus, which will include more than 100 monuments now missing or so eroded or damaged that they can no longer be drawn or photographed. Arthur G. Miller (University of Maryland), with sup- port from NGS, completed a study of painted tombs in the Valley, including Suchilquitongo (Huijazoo) Tomb 5. Miller, Nancy Farriss (University of Penn- sylvania), and Angeles Romero (Centro Regional de Oaxaca, INAH) have begun a project in the Zapotec sierra funded by the National Endowment for the Hu- manities. The investigation will focus on the transfor- mation of European symbolic, ideological, and eco- nomic ideas and forms into native ones, especially as the process is reflected in ritual calendars and maps produced during the first two centuries after the Eu- ropean invasion. Kent Flannery (UM), Frank Hole (Yale University), and Robert G. Reynolds's analyses of Cueva Blanca, near Mitla, include a computer-assisted reconstruction of activity areas on three Archaic living floors. Cres- cent-shaped debris areas resembling the "drop zones" of Binford's Mask site model are emerging on each floor. Projectile points indicate a Late Archaic occu- pation related to the Abejas phase in the Tehuacan Valley. M. G6mez Jim&amp;nez (Frissell Museum of Zapotec Art, University of the Americas) reports that experi- mental attempts to grow maize in Mitla with spring water from the nearby site of Hierve el Agua, often interpreted as a locus of early irrigation, were unsuc- cessful. Gary Feinman (University of Wisconsin) and Linda Nicholas have begun an investigation of dense con- centrations of marine shell at an archaeological site beneath and around Ejutla. Mapping and excavation in 1990, assisted by Scott Fedick, Sherman Banker, and Michael Elam, indicated that shell ornaments (in- cluding beads, pendants, and bracelets) were manufac- tured from pearl oyster, conch, and at least 10 other species of Pacific shell. Preliminary indications are that the shell-working dates to the first millennium A.D. John E. Clark (New World Archaeological Foun- dation, Brigham Young University [BYU]) and Mi- chael Blake (University of British Columbia) continued investigations at the Early Formative sites of Paso de la Amada and San Carlos in the Soconusco region. Nonelite residential zones as well as structures that evidently housed emerging chiefly lineages were ex- cavated. Data documenting changes in architecture, importation of obsidian and other nonlocal materials, craft production (pottery, figurines, lapidary work), and development of a complex subsistence strategy (in- volving a mix of wild food resources and domesticated plants) will be used to assess processes involved in the evolution of ranked societies in the region. Stable car- bon-isotope analysis of bone from 15 individuals sug- gests that maize was not yet an important dietary item. Clemency Chase Coggins (Boston University [BU]) directed the relocation and recording of some 50 stone monuments at Dzibilchaltfin with support from the Middle American Research Institute of Tulane Uni- versity. These Late Classic and Postclassic monuments include at least a dozen carved stelae; 10 of these, along with five other monuments, had inscriptions, of which five are still legible. The monuments are concentrated near the central plaza and along the east-west sacbe, which apparently involves a solar alignment. Continu- ing investigation will focus on the numerous and sty- listically diverse Florescent facade stones at the center. Michael P. Smyth (University of Cincinnati) and Christopher D. Dore (Texas Tech University and Uni- versity of New Mexico) completed a systematic surface collection in the western part of Sayil. Analyses still in progress confirm that the major occupation at the site occurred during the Terminal Classic, although small areas were apparently occupied both earlier and later. Differential distribution of ceramic wares and vessel forms suggest spatial segregation of specialized activ- ities and of socioeconomic groups, but likely ceramic indicators of high status are not exclusively associated with elaborate architecture. Ceramic assemblages from perishable structures include a greater variety of vessel forms than those from stone-walled buildings, sug- gesting that a more restricted range of activities took place in the latter. The survey also revealed a new sacbe connecting Sayil with the nearby site of Chac II, which may in fact be part of the same community. Analysis of data from Calakmul continues under the direction of William J. Folan (Universidad Aut6noma 730 [Vol. 56, No. 4, 1991]</page><page sequence="11">CURRENT RESEARCH de Campeche). Ceramic analysis by Maria Rosario Dominguez Carrasco indicates an occupation ranging from Middle Preclassic through Postclassic and sug- gests closer connections with the southern lowlands than with northern areas. Study of settlement data from some 6,750 structures within a zone of 30 square ki- lometers around the center by Laraine A. Fletcher (Adelphi University) and James Gann has led to an increased awareness of its concentric and lacustrine character. Analyses of astronomical alignments by Abel Morales L6pez, dynastic texts by Joyce Marcus (UM), burials by Mario Coyoc Ramirez, palaeoclimatic data by Joel Gunn, hydrology by Gary Gates, and land-use patterns by Marilyn Gates (Simon Fraser University) are in progress. GUATEMALA. Excavation continues at Nakbe as part of a larger regional investigation in the northern Pet6n directed by Richard D. Hansen (University of California-Los Angeles [UCLA]) with a particular fo- cus on the emergence of complex societies in the south- ern lowlands in the Preclassic period. Analysis of ce- ramics by Donald W. Forsyth (BYU) indicates a substantial early Middle Preclassic occupation with ex- ternal economic connections (indicated by obsidian nuggets and Strombus shells). Pollen and soil analysis by John G. Jones and John Jacob (Texas A&amp;M Uni- versity [TAMU]) indicate that maize and squash were already present. Excavation by Hansen, Juan Luis Ve- lasquez (Instituto de Antropologia e Historia de Gua- temala [IDEAH]), Francisco Roberto L6pez (Univer- sidad de San Carlos [USAC]), Susan Snow (UCLA), and Frank Wood (UCLA) have identified a massive late Middle Preclassic construction effort at the site. Late Preclassic excavations by Hansen, Forsyth, and Gustavo Martinez (USAC) revealed a series of mon- umental architectural masks and panels. Four Preclas- sic monuments, including a large carved stela, have been located so far. Excavations by L6pez and Renaldo Acevedo (IDEAH) are probing Late Classic settlement areas around the center, including a zone with "codex- style" ceramics; neutron-activation analysis by Ron Bishop (Conservation Analytical Laboratory, Smith- sonian Institution) suggests that Nakbe may be a pro- duction center for pottery in this style. Excavations at Mirador have identified a Preclassic text on Stela 2 as well as new Preclassic monuments. Excavation at Tin- tal uncovered a mosaic jade mask at the base of Pre- classic Stela 1 as well as a substantial Late Classic occupation. BELIZE. Thomas W. Killion and Patricia A. McAnany (BU) directed the 1990 excavations at K'axob, a small settlement on the edge of Pulltrouser Swamp, occupied continuously from Middle Preclassic to Terminal Classic times. Excavation in the platform in front of a small Late Classic pyramid (originally painted red) revealed a Late Preclassic mortuary com- plex. Burials associated with low (shrine) platforms contained more individuals and had more complex grave goods than those placed in subfloor pits without platforms. Investigations projected for 1992 will assess the possibility that this differential burial pattern may relate to ancestor worship as an expression of lineage organization in the context of increasing social in- equality. Analysis of materials recovered by Colhi Project investigations, focusing on craft specialization and stone tool production, are nearing completion. Studies by John Jacob and John Jones (TAMU) have produced a pollen sequence with information on initial defores- tation, major cultigens, and field abandonment in the Cobweb Swamp area where Late Classic Colhf farmers constructed raised fields. Meredith Dreiss, Thomas Hester, and David Brown (University of Texas-Austin [UTA]) have analyzed the distribution of obsidian in Late/Terminal Classic contexts. Leslie Shaw (Univer- sity of Massachusetts-Amherst) has completed a de- tailed study of Preclassic faunal remains, while Fred Valdez (UTA) continues analysis of Preclassic mate- rials excavated in 1989. HONDURAS. David Webster (Pennsylvania State University [PSU]) directed excavation of part of a large Late Classic elite residential compound in the Sepul- turas area of Copin. The investigation, funded by the Annenberg/CPB Project, revealed three major elite buildings; the hundreds of pieces of associated sculp- ture, including a new carved bench representing a sky band, are under study by Barbara Fash. Randolph Wid- mer (University of Houston) recorded the features, sculpture, and artifacts uncovered during restoration of the structures by Rudy Larios. The Proyecto Arqueolo6gico Cataguana y Olomfn, directed by Rosemary Joyce (Harvard University [HU]) with the assistance of Julia Hendon (HU), conducted test excavations along the drainage of the Rio Cuya- mapa in 1990. Six of the eight clusters of large archi- tectural remains located in the survey were investigat- ed. Tests of pairs of parallel mounds in five of these sites revealed features consistent with identification as ball courts (prepared floors in the alleys, mirror-image wall profiles, vertical walls without access stairs flank- ing the alleys, and in one case a sculpted marker). Ce- ramic assemblages from these and other excavation units ranged in date from late Middle Preclassic to Terminal Classic. Similarities to ceramic complexes from Playa de Los Muertos (Middle Preclassic) and Cerro Palenque (Terminal Classic), both in the Ulua Valley, are particularly noteworthy. Investigation of site planning at the Preclassic site of Yarumela in the Comayagua Valley continued in 1990 under the overall direction of L. R. V. Joesink- Mandeville (California State University-Fullerton [CSUF]). Boyd Dixon (New World Research, Inc.) di- rected a third season of excavation on Structure 101, a platform at least 18 m in height that supported a massive (ca. 19 by 31 m) wattle-and-daub superstruc- ture with an elaborate drain system, by the end of the Middle Preclassic. Geomorphological testing of the an- cient river channel defining the west side of the site by Glenn S. Greene (University of Northwestern Louisi- ana) demonstrated its pre-occupation origin and clar- ified the late Pleistocene history of this portion of the Rio Humuya drainage. Subsurface electronic resistiv- ity testing by Nobukatsu Hasebe (CSUF) has begun to delineate areas of nonplatform residential architecture 731</page><page sequence="12">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY surrounding the Main Plaza. A new sculpture fragment, possibly Izapa in style, was recovered during recon- struction of Structure 102, a 9-m-tall Late Preclassic platform facing Structure 101 across the plaza. John S. Henderson CENTRAL AMERICA Research in Central America continued in 1990 de- spite earthquakes, economic readjustments, and polit- ical unrest in various locations. Support for research and professional training, as well as the development of curation standards for research collections and ac- cess continue to be major problems and challenges in the region. PANAMA. Richard Cooke (Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute [STRI]), Tony Ranere (Temple Uni- versity [TUI), Pat Hansell (TU), and Fione Wilmott (STRI) returned briefly to the Paleoindian locus at La Mula-Sarigua, Herrera. This site has "Clovis-like" flut- ed points, as well as boring and scraping tools typical of the Paleoindian horizon. Some apparently in situ materials were located, although they were not conclu- sive enough to shed light on the true nature of the deposit. Dolores Piperno (STRI) and Mark Bush (Ohio State University) took a Livingston core from a swamp in the El Valle crater, central Panama, where a complete glacial cycle of vegetational changes has recently been reported. It is hoped that this core will fill in gaps in the Holocene record for the area. In August 1990 a congress entitled "Non-imperial Polities in the Lands Visited by Columbus on His Four Voyages to the New World" was held at the Earl S. Tupper Conference Center at STRI. This important conference was attended by 55 scholars from 9 coun- tries; the conference was cosponsored by STRI, the Social Science Research Council, and the University of Costa Rica (Regional Center in Liberia). Cooke (STRI) and Oscar Fonseca (University of Costa Rica [UCR]) evaulated Cerro Juan Diaz, a severely looted site on the Azuero Peninsula. A small test pit suggests an occupation from 2400 to 1800 B.P., and associated data include well-preserved faunal remains and Tonosi Polychrome sherds. The cemetery portion of the site contains gold artifacts, which is the primary reason for the heavy looting in the area. COSTA RICA. Ana Cecilia Arias, Eva Neff La- torre, and Carlos Rodriguez (UCR) continued their ongoing research project, "Clays and Ceramics of the Central Valley," a multidisciplinary endeavor focusing on clay sources and technology of prehistoric ceramics in the area. Floria Arrea Sierman (UCR) continued her research on Colonial period archaeology in central Costa Rica, analyzing existing collections and surveying for addi- tional sites. Maureen Sanchez Pereira (UCR) continues to ex- pand the botanical-analysis capabilities of the Labo- ratory of Archaeology with the development of com- parative collections and curation of archaeological samples. Sergio Chavez (UCR) participated in a two-month study and training program in instrumental analysis of ceramics at the Conservation Analytical Laboratory, funded by the Office of International Programs of the Smithsonian Institution (SI) and directed by Ronald L. Bishop (SI) and Frederick W. Lange (University of Colorado-Boulder). The project was designed to fur- ther expand the data base of the Greater Nicoya Ce- ramic Project. Wilson Valerio (Museo Nacional de Costa Rica [MNCR]) also participated in the project, as did Silvia Salgado (State University of New York- Albany) and Francisco Corrales (MNCR), who are studying in the United States. Juan Vicente Guerrero and Myrna Rojas (MNCR) directed rescue efforts at a 2,300 B.P. habitation site in the central valley of Costa Rica. The site had house floors and refuse and will be preserved, after some excavation, within the grounds of the new Biodiversity Institute in San Jose. NICARAGUA. Dominique Rigat and Franck Gorin (Centro de Estudios Mexicanos y Centro Amer- icanos) and Rafael Gonzalez and Ronaldo Salgado (Museo Nacional de Nicaragua) continued their survey and testing project in the Managua Basin in the north- central part of the country. One of the important pre- liminary results of the project is the identification of a much greater extension of ceramics from Greater Nicoya, especially during the period A.D. 800-1350, than previously noted for the northern area. Salgado also participated in the Smithsonian-sponsored Great- er Nicoya Ceramic Project. Laraine Fletcher (Adelphi University) continued survey in northern Nicaragua near Esteli. Frederick W. Lange ERRATUM In the July 1991 issue of the journal (Vol. 56, No. 3), several lines of text in the Southeast section of Current Research were sent to press incorrectly. In the paragraph referring to the Southwest Florida Project, directed by William H. Marquardt (Florida Museum of Natural History) (p. 552), the sentence "Under the professional supervision of Marquardt, volunteers Karen Jo Walker and Corbett Torrence excavated at Useppa Island (8LL51), .. ." should read "Under the professional supervision of Marquardt, Karen Jo Walker, and Corbett Torrence, volunteers excavated at Useppa Island (8LL51), . . ."
