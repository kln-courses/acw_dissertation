Psalm 109:27 And it came to pass, when the minstrel played, that the hand of the Lord came upon him (upon Elisha). II Kings, 3:15 The language of the Holy Scripture, a language of symbols and allegories that occupied such a central place in the visual art and architecture of the Middle Ages and the Renaissance, is no less important in the art of music and specifically in the polyphonic Mass, the leading genre of the fifteenth and sixteenth cen- turies.1 However, in contrast to art and architecture, this symbolism is deeply concealed in music. The present work is devoted precisely to the discovery of signs/ symbols expressed in the form of the Renaissance Mass. These symbols reflected the profundity and majesty of their authors' aspirations, the play of their ima- gination and the power of their intellect. They were never accessible to the understanding of ordinary people, but rather intended for an elite circle of professionals.2 With the sunset of the Renaissance and the decline of the genre, those who knew of this unusual practice vanished as well, and this most arcane aspect of composition completely disappeared from the awareness of the subsequent generations of musicians. Indeed, it would have remained hidden forever if not for com- puter technology, which has been instrumental in helping rediscover it. However, these symbols, which form the very foundation of the five-part Ordinary, are the key to understanding the nature of the Mass genre, the cipher needed to reveal its intricate and multi-layered content and to establish a correlation between the design of musical compositions and works of visual art.3 1. The Mass: GENRE OR FORM? Our discussion, therefore, will focus on the symbolism of form of the Mass. We should begin by addressing a question, vital for this study, which has not been answered in a defi- nitive manner to date: does the Mass in effect constitute a musical form?4 Experts on the Renaissance Mass answer this question in the affirmative, citing as their main argument the unity of musical material common to the Masses of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries.5 On the other hand, experts in the field of musical form are likely to object to this view, since they define the Mass not as a form but rather as a genre, whose structure derives exclusively from the text.6 Cyclical compositions (instru- mental and choral) are after all associated with genres rather than forms. This point of view gains additional support from the fact that unlike any musical genre that represents a form at the same time, the Ordinary was never performed as a unified composition from beginning to end. Its parts did not follow directly one after the other, but were interspersed in the liturgy. This particular manner of performance effectively prevented it from being perceived as an integral musical form. The argument is even more valid for the early polyphonic Masses of the fourteenth century and plainchant Masses, where unity of musical material is absent. © 2008 Research Center for Music Iconography CUNY 69</page><page sequence="2">Irene Guletsky, Manus Mysterialis : The Symbolism of Form in the Renaissance Mass Is there then justification in asking whether the composer of the Mass was faced with a task of construc- tion, such as that of an architect planning the design of a cathedral? Or was the composer limited to choosing the material and its development and arrangement, while the formal foundation was provided by the text alone (a constant, unchanging element of the composition)? In other words, does the Mass contain a powerful constructive idea that, despite the multi-movement nature of the composition and the specific conditions of its performance, provides it with a measure of unity that allows us to define the given genre as a form as well? And if so, what is this idea? A second question which follows directly from the previous one: in what circumstances does one of the key criteria of musical form - the unity of its performance - cease to play a decisive role? For many years the present author has sought answers to these questions, realizing that they lie hidden within the layer suffused with the profound enigma of these works. It is a noteworthy observation that music theorists of that time never actually addressed the subject of form.7 This may seem strange, considering, first of all, the zealous attention paid by philosophers of the Middle Ages and the Renaissance to the problem of form in general,8 and the important place it occupied in the theory of visual arts and architecture; and second, the meticulous care with which musical theory shaped all the other elements of compositional language and technique: the theory of modes and intervals, the mensural system and rhythm, or the foundations of counterpoint. Johannes Tinctoris, who wrote twelve treatises for his royal students,9 and who, alone among his contem- poraries, covered a most extensive range of issues in musical theory and composition, joins his other colleagues in his total silence on the subject of form, if we do not count his definition of the Mass as cantus magnus.10 However, even this single definition is of vital importance to us, since it intimates that Tinctoris and his contemporaries recognized the Mass as a unified and large-scale composition. Nevertheless, in the second half of the sixteenth century a few rare remarks by Gioseffo Zarlino in his treatise Le istitutioni harmoniche shed light on the interpretation of the notion of "form" (though not specifi- cally "the form of the Mass"). Zarlino defines the form primarily as a proportion, like the consonance which is built according to a proportion between one number and another, and as a model as well, "according to which any thing is being made". 11 Today we know the importance assigned to numerical ideas and propor- tional regularities in the composition of religious works, especially Masses. These ideas were expressed primarily, though not exclusively, through the structure of the cantus firmus. Later in the same treatise Zarlino provides an equally valuable definition of form as a pivotal idea, a design realized by the musician through the process of consolidating and developing his material.12 This definition of form - like that in Zar lino's other, later treatise, Sopplimenti musicali, which refers to Ptolemy and the gene- ral science of forms - indicates that the theoretician did not regard musical form as such as a specific category of musical science, but rather as a general philosophical category.13 All these definitions of form may guide us in our search for the comprehension of this term by theorists and composers of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries: form as proportion, as model, the embodiment of the composer's idea and design. It is crucial to note that numerous studies have analyzed the Mass from the standpoint of these aspects. However, these analyses deal mainly with the structure of the cantus firmus, the significant element of the cycle and the master work of the fifteenth-century Mass.14 Nevertheless, the cantus firmus, even though it plays a very important role, is not an obligatory structure for all the works written in this genre, and certainly cannot be identified with the form. This study focuses on an analysis of the overall structure of the polyphonic Ordinary, which is defined by the proportions of the cycle. This structure fulfills the most important, "ideal" plan of the composition, its "contour", its design. It is the point of departure for all the other structures, and comes closest to the con- cept of "form as a whole", which includes Zarlino's definitions as well. It is also an area neglected in existing research. 2. Symmetrical design. The present study is based on an analysis of the overall structure of 315 Masses dating from the fourteenth to the end of the sixteenth centuries.15 These include the three preserved complete cycles of the fourteenth century, ten English Masses from the fifteenth century,16 all Masses by Guillaume Du Fay, Johannes Ockeghem, Jacob Obrecht, Josquin des Prez, Pierre de la Rue, Alexander Agricola, Firmi- 70</page><page sequence="3">Music in Art XXXIII/ 1-2 (2008) 1.

This analysis, using specially created computer programs, examines two things: (1) the general proportions: symmetry or asymmetry of the form, and (2) the overall graphic design. The program employs a method whereby data pertaining to the size (duration) of each movement of the cycle are entered into the computer, which calculates the proportions, and then builds a chart of the cycle.19 The duration of movements was usually calculated by counting the number of measures or breves, while taking into consideration the shifts of perfect and imperfect mensural signs (integer valor and diminution) with the corresponding choice of a common unit of measurement. The first stage of this research revealed that there are two main types of the cyclic design: symmetrical and asymmetrical. Despite the fact that the first group is much smaller in number of settings, we will start our study namely from this one because of its crucial importance for the definition of the Ordinary as a form. Thus a clear symmetrical structure is found in the many of Palestrina' s mature and late Masses. In com- positions of this type, the parts that are equidistant from the central part- the Credo - are identical in their proportions (i.e., the Gloria to the Sanctus, the Kyrie to the Agnus Dei). The composer builds an arched form, wherein the Credo serves as the axis of symmetry, while the Gloria/ Sanctus and the Kyrie/ Agnus move- ments make up two corresponding pairs.20 In the course of research, however, it became clear that Palestrina did not invent this design, although he did provide it with its most complete and consistent expression on all levels of composition, including thematic structure.21 The symmetrical design was known to Franco-Flemish composers as early as the 1470s. Although rarely used, it is found in Masses of Ockeghem, Obrecht, Josquin, Brumel, La Rue. Obrechťs Mass Plurimorum carminum I represents an example of perfect mirror symmetry of the form [fig. I].22 It is inconceivable that such symmetry, at the level of large-scale cyclical composition, could have formed at random or as a consequence of Textvertonung, which, incidentally, is totally asymmetrical in its proportions [fig. 12a].23 More likely, it represents the final result (fine ) of the composer's original idea. This means that the composer planned it from the start, as he did the mensural, textural, contrapuntal, and other aspects of the structure. Its proportions were as scrupulously calculated as those of the cantus firmus, leaving no doubt that the Ordinary was perceived by composers as a whole, or as a unified form. Besides, the symmetry of the overall structure observable in some Masses is built into the very protof orm of the Ordinary.24 This is evidenced by its semantic structure, where the Credo (the symbol of faith) forms the central axis of the composition, flanked by the corresponding pairs: Gloria/ Sanctus, representing worship and praise, and Kyrie/ Agnus Dei, representing prayer.25 The three-part macro-structure (or macro-level) of the Ordinary is equally symmetrical, since the extreme pairs flanking the Credo are paired as a result of their location in the liturgy: thus, the Kyrie/ Gloria, which directly follow one another, are placed in the Introductory Rites, the Credo in the Liturgy of the Word, and the Sanctus/ Agnus Dei in the Liturgy of the Eucharist respectively.26 71</page><page sequence="4">Irene Guletsky, Manus Mysterialis : The Symbolism of Form in the Renaissance Mass The two structures of the protoform (the semantic and the three-part macro-structures), together with the symmetrical cycle patterns cited above, fully conform to the design of the altar triptych with its three- or five-part hierarchically fashioned form,27 as well as to the layout of the western facade or cross-section of the three- or five-nave cross-vaulted church, encountered in basilicas such as San Marco in Venice or Cathe- dral in Toledo [fig. 2]. The assumption that the mirror symmetry found in some fifteenth- or sixteenth-century Masses reflects the design of the altar and the church is thus justified. Not only does it make artistic sense; it also underscores the similar functions of the Mass and the cathedral.28 In this case we will have to acknowledge that composers up to Pales trina made very infrequent use of the symmetrical cycle. Despite the perfection of this design, Franco-Flemish composers took great care to avoid it. In fact, only about ten percent of Masses written by fifteenth-century Netherlands' masters feature this design. Josquin and Lasso employ it only once each. In the overall structure of the majority of Renaissance cycles a clearly expressed asymmetry dominates. Why did composers avoid the circular, balanced form in a time when it was held in such high esteem in philosophy, aesthetics and the visual arts? One possible answer is that the asymmetry of the Franco-Fle- mish Masses is not an evidence of flawed design, but embodies a different constructive idea, one that these composers found more desirable. If the symmetric form with identical Credo-related corresponding parts was adopted by composers as reflecting a certain idea, or model, there is no reason to believe otherwise of these asymmetric compositions, whose design - as we are about to find out- was copied and modified to a considerably greater extent by many generations of musicians. The idea of these cycles may be less acces- sible and lie deeper below the surface; but it is precisely our task to unearth the meaning and reveal the mystery of these models - a task that requires a more thorough investigative approach. 3. Asymmetrical design. Unlike the symmetric model, which forms a single unit despite certain varia- tions in its proportions, asymmetric designs are extremely frequent. Nevertheless, classification of these models according to certain similarities reveals that all the asymmetric compositions fall into several large groups. The largest variety is represented by a pattern that is essentially fairly similar to the symmetric de- sign. In these cycles, the symmetry is not broken completely but only in part. It is usually preserved in the Gloria/ Sanctus pair, and absent from the Kyrie/ Agnus. Moreover, the Kyrie is as a rule considerably shorter than the Agnus (less frequently it can also be longer). This kind of design was found in almost half of the examined Masses written prior to 1520.29 Sometimes, proportions of the golden section, or ratios that are close to it, are revealed between cycle movements, as in L'Homme armé Masses by Du Fay, Ockeghem and Busnoys. However, on the level of the overall structure of most Masses, it is generally impossible to explain this departure from symmetry and the extreme popularity of this model by any particular mathematical logic or a specifically musical logic of form. The second version of asymmetrical design, also encountered in many cycles, is markedly more asymmetric in comparison to the previous one. It lacks centricity, since the Credo loses its dominant position in the form, becoming comparable in length to the Gloria. The Credo and Gloria form a pair not only with regard to proportion, but also to other structures and cantus firmus treatment. In its turn, the Sanctus forms a corresponding pair with the Agnus Dei. Thus the inner arrangement of cycle parts in this instance looks as follows:30 K-GC-SA 1-2-2 This design appears particularly bizarre in light of its "conflict" with the distinct symmetric three-part macro- structure discussed above, which is related to the arrangement of the Ordinary movements within the overall liturgy, and represents one of the key proto-structures of the composition: KG-C-SA 2-1-2 The strange use of the 1-2-2 pattern that became a tradition in Masses from the fourteenth century has been noted by many scholars. In his work on the Caput Masses, Manfred F. Bukofzer attempted to explain this phenomenon. He attributed the similarity between the Gloria and Credo on the one hand, and the Sanctus and Agnus (or Kyrie, Sanctus and Agnus) on the other, to the initial similarity in the structure of the 72</page><page sequence="5">Music in Art XXXIII/ 1-2 (2008) 2.

Indeed, it would be quite reasonable were it not for the fact that the majority of cycles in this group re- present precisely the mirror version of this design in their proportions and sometimes in the arrangement of other structures. In such cycles, the Credo is similar or identical in its length to the Sanctus, and not to the Gloria; moreover, in a number of works this connection is forged in other parameters as well, e.g. the number of sections within the movements, the mensural and ensemble patterns, or the use of cantus firmus. Specific examples are the Masses L'Homme armé no. 3 from the six anonymous Masses at the Biblioteca Nazionale Vittorio Emanuele III in Naples and L'Homme armé by Tinctoris, as well as some works by Obrecht and Jos- quin, which will be discussed later. Accordingly, the inner cycle arrangement in these Masses forms the fol- lowing pattern: KG-CS-A 2-2-1 In addition, in discussing the Caput Mass, Bukofzer also points out other quite uncommon design featur- es that, while also related to the inner arrangement of the parts, are yet distinct from the patterns cited above. For instance, in Ockeghem's Mass, the Kyrie is marked by its pronounced compositional isolation, and it is contrasted to all the other parts. It is considerably smaller in scale than the other four movements, it lacks a motto and the introductory duet, and its cantus firmus is used only once, and even then in a shortened ver- sion. The Kyrie also differs from the other parts in terms of harmony.33 Thus the overall design of the cycle may be expressed with the following figure: K-GCSA 1-4 A similar cycle design is also evident in Obrechťs Caput Mass.34 These distinctions, however, are largely disregarded by Bukofzer. An entire series of Masses with the same proportions was also discovered. In these works, the four parts - Gloria, Credo, Sanctus and Agnus, or Kyrie, Gloria, Credo and Sanctus (in another version) - resemble one another in their scale, while one of the extreme parts - the Kyrie or the Agnus Dei - is considerably smaller in duration. For example, in Frye's Nobilis et pulchra, the duration of movements from the Kyrie to the Agnus is as follows: K G C S A 164-170-169-161-136. And in Josquin's Mass N'aurr ay je jamais: K G C SA 71-217-252-217-200 Naturally, this begs the question: What is the logic of such a design? What purpose is served by contras- ting one part with all the others? After all, if this is not an accidental phenomenon, it must have a rational explanation. The next discernable group of asymmetric Masses once again makes use of the decentralized cycle. The scale of the movements gradually increases toward the end of the cycle, up until the Sanctus (the peak of the composition), and then drops significantly in the Agnus Dei. Such, for example, are Obrechťs Masses Si de- dero , Cela sans plus , Fors seulement, as well as Josquin's Allez regretz , Mater Patris , Da pacem. Another variation of this version is found in the English anonymous Fuit homo missus, where the first three movements are identical in size, the Sanctus is larger, and the Agnus is smaller than the other parts: K G C S A 150 - 150 - 150 - 168 - 121 75</page><page sequence="8">Irene Guletsky, Manus Mysterialis : The Symbolism of Form in the Renaissance Mass 5.

The designs of the examples cited above prompt two conclusions. First, that the composition of the fifteenth-century Masses depended far less on the structure and proportions of the text than has commonly been believed. Second, that it is impossible to explain the distinctive features of these models by purely musical or mathematical logic. So, if neither the text, nor the logic of mathematics or of musical form determined the cycle's proportions, overall design and inner arrangement, what did? 4. The mysterious MANUS. The answer to this question is, perhaps paradoxically, the same as in the case of the symmetric design of Mass composition. If the symmetric model represents the church idea, i.e. consti- tutes a form that is essentially a symbol, then it is reasonable to assume that the asymmetric model may also represent a symbol of some sort. The only question is: what is that symbol? In our case, the search for the answer would probably have been long and fruitless, in view of the variety and individuality of proportions in each cycle, had it not been for the help of a computer program that examined the proportions in Masses. This program revealed that the pattern of all asymmetric cycles, despite their wide variety, invariably re- sembles a single sign: the hand symbol. This iconographie gesture is depicted in every possible version, being essentially a recurrent element of any church interior [figs. 3 &amp; 4]. 35 On the whole, based on their design, the cycles may be divided into four main groups, arranged here by their similarity to certain gestures :(1) the "benedictory hand" (palm); (2) the "pointing finger" (index); (3) the "middle extended" (gesture of Truth);36 and (4) the "two blessing fingers" (mano pantea). Certain pictures, as well as their possible prototypes, representing human gestures, occupy an inter- mediate position, and it is occasionally quite difficult to assign them to a specific group.37 These four types of design, once they emerged, were widely imitated with varying degrees of similarity to or divergence from the original. In fact, it was these that provided the composer with the main models of the form. Thus a com- poser writing a Mass usually relied on two models: one served as the original source of musical material (the Gregorian chant, chanson or motet), the other provided the model of the form, of the overall design.38 This practice of repeated reproduction and even imitation of certain designs by composers of various schools and generations confirms the assumption that in this instance we are dealing not with accidental similarity to the hand, but possibly with a genuine symbol of profound theological and philosophical signi- ficance, which I will discuss in more detail later. The design of the overall structure also allows us to discuss the style of different schools (such as the English or the Franco-Flemish), as well as the style of individual composers like Ockeghem, Obrecht, Josquin, Lasso and Palestrina - a subject that requires a special study. Let us now take a more detailed look at the main groups of designs. The first type - the "benedictory hand" - is the most common in cycles of the second half of the fifteenth century. This group includes more than half of all the examined Masses of that period (84 out of a total of 155). Here it is crucial to highlight several main ways of interpreting the "hand": Tf An ordinary hand, with its natural proportions [figs. 3 &amp; 5]. The earliest example of this design might well have been Ockeghem' s Caput Mass, which became in the mid-fifteenth century extremely popular in the Low Countries. The majority of Masses based on the theme of L'Homme armé from the second half of the fifteenth century also reproduce this very design.39 However, by the middle of the sixteenth century, and possibly somewhat earlier, this model faded into insignificance and was used much rarely. If A second interpretation of this model was a stylized hand with less natural proportions, such as fingers of identical length, encountered in works by Frye (Nobilis et pulchra), Obrecht (Caput) and Josquin (De Beata Virgineý0 [fig. 6]. Tf A third interpretation - a symmetrical hand [figs. 1 &amp; 2], as we have noted above, a type of composition that was introduced in the last third of the fifteenth century, but is more typical of Palestrina's Masses during his mature and late periods (Ave Maria (16), 41 Qual e'il piu grand amor). 77</page><page sequence="10">Irene Guletsky, Manus Mysterialis : The Symbolism of Form in the Renaissance Mass 6.

It appears for the first time in stylized version in the anonymous English Mass Fuit homo missus [figs. 4e, 4f, &amp; 7]. Compositions of this type are quite clearly dominated by the Sanctus, with the resulting elimination of centricity . This type is rarely encountered in the sixteenth century.42 The next group consists of compositions where the extended "finger" is the middle one. This type appears for the first time in the Mass by Machaut; it is also to be found among Ockeghem's (Au travail suis , Mi-mi), Obrechťs ( Scaramella , Je ne demande) and Josquin' s works. However, it achieves its greatest popularity in the sixteenth century, when, by virtue of its centricity, it displaces all other "gestures", becoming the pro- minent feature. Many of Palestrina's Masses, including the Inviolata , Jesu nostra redemptio, Nasce la gioia mia, Regina coeli (21) Masses, and finally, the famous Missa Papae Marcelli, belong to this group. Sometimes, this design may also be assigned to the "palm" type, with the middle finger outstretched and the others slightly bent [fig. 8]. In this group should be also assigned a subgroup of symmetrical cycles such as anonymous O Rosa bella no. 3, Agricola' s Primi toni, Palestrina's Assumpta es Maria, O admirabile commercium and others. The "two blessing fingers" design of the fourth group of Masses was also fairly widespread, and even though less prominent in the fifteenth century than the first group ("palm"), it emerged earlier and main- tained its presence throughout the three centuries of the Renaissance. It is reproduced in Du Fay's Se la face ay pale , Sancti Antonii da Padova, La mort de Saint Gothard ,43 in many of Josquin's settings such as Faysant re- gretz, Una musqué de Buscaya, La solfa re mi, in Masses by Pierre de la Rue Alleluia, Cumjucunditate, Ave Maria, De Sancto Antonio and in the large group of Palestrina's Masses, including Confiteor Tibi Domini, Ascipe Do- mine, Veni sponsa, Jam Christus astra and Gabriel Archangelus [figs. 4a, b &amp; 9]. This design is already in evidence in the first polyphonic Mass of the fourteenth century - the Mass of Tournai. u Moreover, at an early stage, and also later, it is frequently encountered in a stylized version, as in the Tournai Mass, which is distinguished by the equality of the "index and middle fingers". 5. The iconography of Du Fay's St. Antonii de Padua and Se la face ay pale Masses in the liturgi- cal, HISTORICAL AND ARTISTIC CONTEXT: THE "TWO-FINGERS" DESIGN IN OTHER MASSES. The diversity of compositional decisions involved in the designing of "gestures" is fairly wide, ranging from meticulous copying of famous originals to the master's creative freedom to fashion his own unique models. At times, it seems as if composers literally "copied" the gestures of the saints on the icons of local churches. Moreover, one cannot rule out the possibility that a Mass dedicated to a certain saint could depict a gesture associated with that saint in composer's own church. One example of this type of connection is found in Du Fay's St. Antonii de Padua Mass and the fresco depicting the saint in the Basilica of St. Anthony in Padua.45 According to David Fallows suggestion, this Mass was composed toward the end of the 1440s and performed at the con- secration ceremony of the famous Donatello altar in the Basilica of St. Anthony in Padua, held in June of 1450. 46 Du Fay's Mass is written for three voices, echoing his cantilena style of the 1440s and 1450s.47 The fresco, by an unknown artist of Giotto's school, depicts St. Anthony in the act of blessing. It is located in the presbytery directly under one of the choral gallery arches. The Mass design represents the same gesture (the "two-fingers" blessing) as the one used by the saint depicted in the fresco [fig. 10]. In fact, the design of the Mass cycle reproduces not only the gesture but (despite the abstract form of the graph) also to some extent the shape of St. Anthony's hand, with its tapering fingers and gentle, "melodious" line reflecting the spiritual grace, tranquility and harmony of the saint's image. Moreover, in the formal structure of the Mass the composer repeats the characteristic outline of the upraised fourth and fifth fingers, including even the precise proportion between them [figs. 10a &amp; 10b]. The proportions of the other fingers are reflected in the length of the respective parts of the Mass only more or less approximately, with the exception of the thumb, which is exaggeratedly elongated in the fresco and looks much shorter in the cycle design. At the same time, had the length of this "finger" in the Mass been equal to its counterpart in the fresco, the overall design of the symbol, i.e. the identification of the gesture in the graphic depiction, would have been com- pletely lost [fig. 10c]. By renouncing exact imitation of the proportion, Du Fay preserves the crucial elements: the gesture and the overall character of St. Anthony's hand. 79</page><page sequence="12">Irene Guletsky, Manus Mysterialis : The Symbolism of Form in the Renaissance Mass 7.

It is impossible to say with any certainty whether exact reproduction of visual proportions in the formal structure of a musical work was the result of inspired intuition, or whether the composer measured the pro- portions with a ruler before embarking on the composition; whether he drew a preliminary sketch for the "hand" to be "depicted" in the future Mass, or held the plan in his mind. Nor is this of any real importance. What is far more significant, is the fact (or possibility) that the composer was directly inspired by the visual image, transferring the sacred symbol as the key source of information to the musical work and reproducing of certain characteristic visual details, in a process that affirms the connection between both works.48 Of the seven cycles by Du Fay, yet another Mass represents the "two-fingers" design: the aforementioned Se la face ay pale. As in the case of the St. Anthony Mass, it would be interesting to examine the composer's choice of the "gesture" for this work in the specific historical and iconographie context. The four-voice Se la face ay pale is one of the four Masses written by Du Fay that employs a strict cantus firmus, whose treatment resembles the technique of the English Masses of the 1430s and 1440s, and specifically Lionel Power's Mass Alma redemptoris and the famous Caput Mass. As its original source, the composer used the tenor of his own ballad by the same name, which he wrote during of his first stay at the Savoy court in the 1430s. The cycle is dated to the early 1450s - the time when Du Fay was once again in the employ of the Duke of Savoy. More- over, it is more than likely, as Fallows believes, that the Mass was timed to coincide with the consummation of the wedding of Amadeus (the elder son of Duke Louis) and the French princess Yolanda (the daughter of Charles VII), which took place in October 1452 (their formal wedding occurred in 1436, when the newlyweds were still children). This would explain the composer's choice of material- his love chanson, 80</page><page sequence="13">Music in Art XXXIII/ 1-2 (2008) which obviously had been dedicated once to one of the beautiful ladies of the Savoy dynasty, Anne de Lusignan.49 The Mass is distinguished by the splendid clarity of its design, which is carried out on all the levels of the structure. Its composition reproduces the left hand and is highly stylized, relying on the canon of the Tournai Mass and reviving it for the first time in the fifteenth century [figs. 9a &amp; b]. The Gloria/ Credo move- ments resemble a pair of twins, in that they are totally identical both in length and structure:50 in the number of sections (three in each movement), the correspondence between their motto, the order of their mensural signs and all the proportions of the cantus firmus, the interludes and the instrumental conclusions at the end of each. The Kyrie/ Sanctus/ Agnus Dei movements, in turn, make up a group unified by the mensuration of the tenor, which forms double bars that provide a contrast to the rest of the voices.51 There is a possibility that the peculiar design of this composition, and above all of the perfect parity of the Gloria/ Credo, repre- sents a hidden allusion to the union of the married pair, symbolizing a strong family tie. A stylized picture, albeit of the right hand, also marks the Mass La mort de Saint Gothard based on the theme of the French chanson.52 The Mass, as its name implies, is dedicated to St. Gothard, the famous saint of the Alpine region. In this work, the design is expressed particularly in the almost identical length of the Credo and Sanctus parts but to a lesser extent in the pattern of their internal structures [fig. 11a]. Since this cycle came into being at approximately the same time as Se la face ay pale, i.e. in the early 1450s, it was appa- rently the earliest example of the "two-fingers" right hand design.53 This innovation was definitely influenced by the English school (in light of the fact that all English Masses are "right-handed"). With the exception of the aforementioned cycles by Du Fay, which represent the "left hand", as well as six similar Masses that adhere either to an earlier tradition or to the mournful spirit of the text (such as Lasso's Triste depart , Quand'io penso al martire ),54 all the subsequent cycles in this group (44 works in all) are represented by the "right hand" . The majority of the works in the group of "two-fingers" Masses are based on liturgical material, or other kinds of sacred sources. As a rule, their titles reflect a dedication to Christ, an apostle, the archangel Gabriel, the church, a saint, or the martyrdom, i.e. images traditionally related to the iconography of blessing, or else depicting the act of blessing itself. This group includes La Rue's Pur natus est , De Sancto Antonio, De Sancta Anna; Palestrina's Gabriel Archangelus, Veni sponsa Christi muñera, Sine titulo (Benedicta es); Morales's Benedicta es caelorum regina; Lasso's Ecce nunc benedicite, Quand'io penso al martire, Frere Thibault. It also includes Masses devoted to certain religious festivals and based on appropriate liturgical chants. The texts of the original sources, the names of these Masses and their iconography are also related, directly or indirectly, to the act of blessing. An example are Palestrina's three hymn Masses: Ad coenam agni providi (performed on Easter, the hymn symbolizing the glorification and blessing of the Easter sacrifice); Jam Christus astra ascenderai (for Pentecost, which celebrates the descent of the Holy Spirit to the apostles, as well as the festival of the giving of the Torah to Moses on Mount Sinai and the blessing of the first fruit in the earlier Jewish tradition); and Te Deum laudamus (for Thanksgiving Day, connected to the ancient tradition of harvest blessing and celebration) [figs. 4c &amp; 11]. It is therefore obvious that the choice of the "two-fingers" design for all of the above Masses is not acci- dental. It is dictated by the content of the Mass's original source, the context of the religious festival for which the Mass was written, and occasionally even by its specific artistic prototype (Du Fay's St. Anthony Mass), by a certain event or a festive ceremony such as a wedding, as in Du Fay's Se la face ay pale Mass, where the essence of the sacrament taking place is the blessing of the married couple.55 6. The "two-fingers" design and the paired inner cycle arrangement. It is the "two blessing fingers" design that contains the answer to the question of the strange asymmetry exhibited by many of the cycles, in which the Gloria and the Credo form an invariable pair, frequently sharing not only their length but also their inner structure, the distinctive features of the cantus firmus, and the textural and mensural outline. Obviously the grouping of the "fingers" in the cycle also accounts for the large number of separate pairs that appeared in the early fifteenth century in precisely such a combination in the Cyprus, Old Hall and Trent 92 manuscripts. In these manuscripts the Gloria/ Credo and the Sanctus / Agnus movements frequently follow one another. They are coordinated in their clefs, mensural signs, number of voices, modes, and possess an identical inner design.56 This indicates that the author or compiler could have formed the Ordinary out 81</page><page sequence="14">Irene Guletsky, Manus Mysterialis : The Symbolism of Form in the Renaissance Mass 8.

Below: (a) Jacob Obrecht, Scaramella ; (b) Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina, Regina coeli (21). of two different pairs (or groups): Gloria/ Credo and Sanctus/ Agnus (or Kyrie/ Sanctus/ Agnus). Moreover, these movements could have occasionally belonged to different composers. In MS Bologna Q15, there are several such cycles assembled by the compiler from two groups of parts written by different composers. These are the Masses by Zacharia de Teramo/ Du Fay and by Ciconia/ de Lantins.57 It is crucial to point out that the transition to a thematically (by cantus firmus) unified cycle, completed by the end of the first half of the fifteenth century, was marked by the emergence of the "blessing hand" mo- del, which was enormously popular throughout the second half of the century. However, the stable paired grouping is maintained even in those Masses whose overall design assigns them to different groups. As an example, we could cite the Masses of Ockeghem. In their design, most of them belong to the "palm" group. At the same time, as noted by Fabrice Fitch, the connection of the Gloria/ Credo pair in these Masses is pa- tently obvious, even though it is invariably expressed through different means: the common mensural pat- tern (De plus en plus), similarities in the texture and motto material (Sine nomine), or the similar use of cantus firmus ( Ecce ancilla).58 What is evident in such cases is the presence of two signs on different levels of the form: a "palm" in the overall design, and the primary sign of the form - the "two fingers" - which is retained often more as a hint, a tribute to tradition, in other structures. 82</page><page sequence="15">Music in Art XXXIII/ 1-2 (2008) 9.

The "two fingers" design does not disappear, but it definitely loses its dominant role. Also of interest is the fact that despite the appearance of a large number of pairs in manuscripts of early-fifteenth-century En- glish music, this sign is never encountered in the proportions of full English cycles of the time, and up until the sixteenth century it is common exclusively to the continental Franco-Flemish tradition. 7. The origin of the Manus-Mass concept. Can one accept the hypothesis that the form of the Mass represents the sacred symbol of the iconographie gesture? This question prompts a number of others. When and why could the idea of using this particular design in the Ordinary have arisen? Did this take place with the birth of the first polyphonic cycle at the beginning of the fourteenth century? Was it perhaps in the mid- thirteenth century, with the emergence of the Franciscan and Dominican graduais, in which the parts were arranged for the first time in the order of their sequence from Kyrie to Agnus?59 Or should it be dated to the twelfth century, the time of the earlier manuscripts, which contain movements of the Ordinary but still arrange them in a free fashion?60 To date, no trustworthy answer has been found to these questions. There are no documented sources, and no studies. Nevertheless, I will take the liberty of putting forth some consi- derations, which seem to me deserving of attention. First of all, it is impossible to ignore the very fact of the similarity between the pattern of Mass designs and the key gestures employed in Christian iconography, as well as the reproduction of exact finger propor- tions in dozens of works by various masters. The insistent recurrence of these designs, to the extent of exact imitation of the "classical" original, encourages us to give serious consideration to the idea of the manus- 83</page><page sequence="16">Irene Guletsky, Manus Mysterialis : The Symbolism of Form in the Renaissance Mass 10.

Below: (a) St. Anthony's blessing hand; (b) Guillaume Du Fay, Sancii Antonii de Padua ; (c) ibid., a hypothetical design. symbol of the Mass, and to find its explanation and confirmation, even if indirect, in the history of formation of its initial structures, in musical and philosophical treatises of the Middle Ages, in the Bible, in the tradi- tions of symbolism, numerology and the magic of the gesture rooted in the distant past, and finally, in the art of the period. Because of the scope of this article, the above subjects will be given only a superficial look. The first topic is the origin of the idea of the Manus-Mass. This idea could well be contemporary to the origin of the Ordinary, i.e. dating from the eleventh century when the final crystallization of its protostruc- ture occurred. This is supported by several factors, including the choice of the number of movements ac- cording to the number of fingers on the hand, and the proportions of the text itself. Both ideas serve as the point of departure for the musical proportions, and could not have been accidental.61 The overall design of the textual protoform is in effect the gesture of the intermediate subgroup of the "two blessing fingers" and the "middle extended finger". It is these two types that are recreated in the first fourteenth-century cycles, which set in motion the history of the polyphonic Mass. Interestingly, the compo- ser, who came the closest to this earliest version of textual proportions was Orlando di Lasso, who frequently recreated them in his cycles [fig. 12]. 84</page><page sequence="17">Music in Art XXXIII/ 1-2 (2008) 11. The "two blessing fingers" design in the 15th- and 16th-century Masses: (a) anonymous, La mort de Saint Gothard ; (b) Pierre de la Rue, De Sancto Antonio ; (c) Orlando di Lasso, Quand' io penso al martire ; (d) Cristobal de Morales, Benedicta es caelorum regina ; (e) Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina, Ad coenam agni providi. 12. The comparative design of the Ordinary text (a) and Orlando di Lasso's Masses Qual Donna attende (b); Certa fortiter (c); and Oscule tur me (d). In the eleventh century, yet another Ordinary structure was formed, duplicating the "two fingers" pat- tern. The chants included in the cycle were divided according to stylistic contrast in the following fashion: the Gloria/ Credo pair was as a rule syllabic in its style, while the Kyrie/ Sanctus/ Agnus parts were marked by their melismatic quality. Thus the syllabic parts represented as it were the upright index and middle fin- gers. Meanwhile, the melismatic melodies of the other movements created the impression of fluidity and li- nearity, providing a vivid depiction of the bent "low" fourth and fifth fingers, as well as the proportionally similar thumb. At the same time, the latter, by virtue of its special place on the hand, transmitted, as it were, its "special status" to the Kyrie, for which it had been initially intended (in view of the fact that the Ordinary was modeled on the left hand). The Kyrie differs from the other movements even in its text, which, as we know, is in Greek, whereas the other movements are in Latin. In many plainchant manuscripts, the Kyrie are set apart, whereas the Sanctus/ Agnus often form a pair. While similar to the Sanctus/ Agnus pair in some of its parameters, the Kyrie nevertheless does not com- pletely coincide with this pair, as is noticeable in the first polyphonic works such as the Mass of Tournai and Machauťs Mass. This also accounts for the emphatic separation of the Kyrie from the other four movements in many of the Masses by Franco-Flemish composers, specifically in some of the Masses by Du Fay and the Caput Masses by Ockeghem and Obrecht discussed above. At an early stage, the paired (symbolic) grouping within the cycle could already have been highlighted by the use of chants dedicated to a holiday or a saint, as well as of a single modus. Thus it is important to stress the fact that the sign was not an accidental offshoot of the Ordinary's formation and the proportions of its text, but rather that the final formation of the cycle, its text and its primary structures, probably took its clue from the sign. It is for that very reason that any fifteenth-century composers who wished to "replace" the left hand with the right, and the "two fingers" gesture with the "palm", could easily have done so by 85</page><page sequence="18">Irene Guletsky, Manus Mysterialis : The Symbolism of Form in the Renaissance Mass 13.

Copy at the Civico Museo Bibliografico Musicale, Bologna, A 57. abandoning the traditional reliance on the proportions and the structure of the text, while retaining and developing the idea of the symbol inherent in the Ordinary. Several factors were apparently responsible for the emergence of the manus-symbol of the Mass. Above all, we should note such an important factor in the history of Western music as the solmization theory of Guido d'Arezzo, which appeared at the same time and was based on the hand outline [fig. 13]. From the mo- ment of its appearance in the early eleventh century, Guido's theory gained considerable popularity, giving rise to numerous speculations and inspiring countless treatises throughout the following centuries, up until the early seventeenth century. Evidently, these two events - the appearance of the solmization system in Guido's work and of the Mass cycle within monastery walls - were very closely related, expressing a single concept of musical art, a bond between its external and internal aspects, its exoteric and esoteric elements. Viewed in this way, the entire musical system, from its basic components (the scale and the intervals) to its highest manifestation in the form of the Mass, was expressed in a single sacred scheme that linked music to the entire range of medieval knowledge, both official (trivium and quadrivium) and occult.62 Regarding the theory of solmization, it is important to note the element of the composer's choice of hand. This choice was probably far from accidental. 86</page><page sequence="19">Music in Art XXXIII/ 1-2 (2008) 14. Jan Provoost, The Christian Allegory (ca. 1510). Oil on panel, 50.5 x 40 cm. Paris, Musée du Louvre. Church iconography, as we know, assigns a special role to left and right side symbolism. Between the twelfth and the sixteenth century treatises on solmization, Guido' s theory ("gamut") was invariably illus- trated by the left hand. Most authors and compilers did not explain their consistent choice. Only a few trea- tises contained commentary regarding this phenomenon. Thus Michael Scot, in his Liber introductoris (the first third of the thirteenth century) intended for students of astrology, in the chapter devoted to music, mentions those he considers the two most important authors in the field of musical theory and practice: Boethius and Guido. The author provides an entire series of analogies between astronomy and music, writing, for example: As the moon goes through its greatest cycle every nineteen solar years, so the musical scale is made up of nineteen sounds, which the pedagogues of the time taught by the articulations of the left hand.63 In this instance, it should be taken to mean that the left hand is associated with the Moon, while the right hand presents the Sun. 87</page><page sequence="20">Irene Guletsky, Manus Mysterialis : The Symbolism of Form in the Renaissance Mass 15. Giovanni di Pietro, detto Lo Spagna (1450-1528), The Adoration of the Magi (Madonna of the Spineta). Vatican, Pinacoteca, cat. 40316. A more detailed explanation for the preference given to the left hand may be found in the treatise Musica manualis cum tonale, copied by Ioannis Wylde, the choirmaster of the Augustine Abbey Waltham Holy Cress between 1430 and 1450, from an earlier and apparently anonymous source: Hence we perform this art with the left [hand] with more intensity that with the right, the reason being that it [the left hand] lies closer to the heart, and first placed upon it. Now, the heart is set on the left- hand side. That is why we are in the habit of raising the left hand more often than the right. That which is moral is more appealing: the left hand holds the present life, while the right hand holds the future. Indeed, the present music, suffused with sorrows, is turned to the left, for the present life is so burdensome. Yet future music, filled with joy, should not be intermixed with any sorrow, so that it is preferable to transmit it from the left to the right hand.64 These two passages, even though they deal with the theory of solmization, can also help us to some extent to understand the initial preference of the creators of the Ordinary for the left hand and the composer's choice of hand for the cycle's design as well.65 88</page><page sequence="21">Music in Art XXXIII/ 1-2 (2008) 16.

Detail of fig. 6; (c) St. Denis Abbey church, West facade (ca. 1137-40); (d) Amsterdam, Zuiderkerk, designed by H. de Keyser (nave 1611, tower 1614). The other factor that, in my opinion, influenced the origin of the symbol of the Mass form is related to the symbolism of gestures and its immense importance in the ritual and art of the medieval church.66 The divine hand is the dominant symbol in the Old Testament. According to my calculations, in the Book of Psalms alone it is mentioned 67 times in 12 different connotations. The more frequent symbols are those of the hand and even fingers, in the act of creation, bestowing deliverance and blessing, punishment and mercy, and giving the law to mankind.67 This divine hand (dextera), was interpreted as a symbol of the "voice of God", or in other words, as a "speaking hand".68 This image was frequently depicted in church art. It predates anthropomorphic depictions of the God- head, and can be found as far back as early Christian art.69 In fact, Christian symbols and allegories are among the central themes of fifteenth- and sixteenth-century Flemish art, as evidenced by such works as a series of paintings by Flemish artists based on the Mass of St. Gregory™ Among the key symbols depicted by the artists are hands in the act of blessing and creation [fig. 14]. 89</page><page sequence="22">Irene Guletsky, Manus Mysterialis : The Symbolism of Form in the Renaissance Mass Religious art was particularly influenced by the gestures of preachers. Gestures added expression to words; they were commonly used in the church interior, as if imbuing it with sound, and decorated the church facades. In his book Painting and Experience in Fifteenth Century Italy Michael Baxandall cites certain gestures from the succinet English list of the conservative minimum in the third edition of The Mirror of the World , published in the 1520s. Thus, for example, nos. 1 and 5 on the list recommend the following: Whan thou speakest of a solempne mater to stände up ryghte with lytell mevynge of the body, but poyntynge it thy fore fynger. And whan thou speakest of any holy mater or devocyon to holde up thy handes.71 As a vivid example of artistic depiction of a gesture carrying important information, Baxandall cites a fresco by Fra Angelico Coronation of the Virgin, which uses the fifth gesture. Six prominent preachers and founders of orders, with St. Dominic and St. Francis at the center, their arms upraised, demonstrate this very gesture [fig. 5]. 72 This same gesture finds expression in Joseph's upraised arms in The Adoration of the Magi by Giovanni di Pietro detto Lo Spagna [fig.15]. Finally, a cathedral facade represents the same gesture, only fashioned in stone.73 The single-tower asym- metric and symmetric western facades of certain gothic churches actually reproduce the same design as do the Masses of the second and third groups - the "pointing finger" and the "finger of Truth" - the gestures of a preacher [fig. 16]. 74 Considering the imagery employed in cathedrals and their interiors, as well as the dominating power of the hand symbol within this space and the ritual performed, the birth of the Mass form as the mystical Manus appears quite organic. In the course of the evolution of this form the multiple meanings attached to the hand symbol determin- ed not only the composer's choice of the actual gesture, but also his left-right hand interpretation, depending on the emphasis he wished to place on his message in any given case. Thus, for instance, the Franco-Flemish composers of the fifteenth century preferred the left hand, whereas the English school actually preferred the right one. In the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries the "two fingers" gesture, unlike the "benedictory hand", most often employs the right hand, even though we can see that in the earlier examples from the fourteenth cen- tury, the hand of choice is the left one. Finally, if the "pointing finger" or "extended middle" are gestures that are usually associated with a hu- man (preacher gestures), while the "mano pantea" or "natural" palm gestures may be interpreted as either divine or human, the "symmetric palm" can symbolize only the Creator and His attributes - glory, eternity and divine perfection.75 8. The divine HIEROGLYPH. Thus the original intention of the Ordinary form was for the Mass to serve as a synthesis of Christian theology and the seven liberal arts (i.e., not only the quadrivium, which incor- porated music as one of the mathematics, but also as the trivium, which included grammar, rhetoric and logic). This form provided a center, a focal point for the cathedral design and interior, its sacred ritual and its auditory expression. The purpose of this unity was to concentrate the occult forces, which, according to the teaching of Agrippa of Nettesheim, inhabit the so-called "pure forms" (numbers, letters, geometric fi- gures, musical harmonies). The occult forces, which originate in the higher realms - the heavenly world of planets and stars, and the super-heavenly world of higher intelligence - facilitate a mystical fusion between the human spirit and the divine, by means of faith, theurgic and musical rites. In such an instance, according to Agrippa, all the types of magic - natural, heavenly and ritual - are united into one.76 Therefore the Ordinary certainly represents not only a liturgical, but also a hermetic genre, a kind of hybrid of hermetic and musical forms, because during the Middle Ages and the Renaissance, the palm of the hand symbolized wisdom, i.e. the entire range of occult knowledge.77 It is the hermetic nature of the Ordinary that apparently holds the answer to the question raised earlier: under what conditions does the performance of a work as a unified composition cease to play the primary role? Not only does the hermetic form not strive to be sensuously comprehended by the listener. On the con- trary, it actually precludes this comprehension, for the innermost mystery is not intended for the ears of the common crowd.78 Paradoxically, through all the stages of its evolution in the course of five centuries -from the earliest stage, when it all but merged with the Proper, to the highest level of prominence and unity of the 90</page><page sequence="23">Music in Art XXXIII/ 1-2 (2008) polyphonic cycle - the Ordinary never became more accessible for the lay listener as a unified composition, than it had been at its inception. This form, both at the start and the end of its existence, was perceived solely by the initiated. It is also noteworthy that the paper of certain manuscripts from Provence, Italy and Northern Spain dating form the second half of the fourteenth to the early fifteenth century, such as the Apt 16 bis codex that contains movements of the Ordinary bears watermarks shaped as a hand.79 Here, this creates a clear allusion to the musical form of the Mass, whose secret essence, the same as a watermark, is hidden from the ignorant. In his treatise De mystica numerorum signification (1583) Pietro Bongo mentions the "secrecy that is an integral part of the knowledge of numbers'7, and that, according to Elders, fully explains the absence of any references to numerical symbolism in the musical theory of the time.80 This holds equally true for the know- ledge of forms, since in Agrippa' s theory, forms rank together with numbers and letters.81 Significant in this context is the cautionary exhortation addressed to the layman in Zarlino's Sopplimenti musicali : We are speaking with the experts, and therefore you the laymen should keep well away from us. . .82 In fact, it was the masters' specific intention to conceal their innermost knowledge - the mystery of the numbers and mystery of the form - from the laymen. It was passed on from teacher to pupil when the latter was ready. Evidently, for a musician to receive this knowledge was tantamount to initiation. This would account for the silence with which musical theorists zealously guarded the secrets of their guild. The form-symbol of the Ordinary is unique in the history of music. It generates multiple layers of meaning, and ties this genre to all the areas of medieval thought. Yet above all, it conveys the genre's main idea and function- benediction and absolution - expressed in the final words of the liturgical text: Ite missa est. The creation of such a form reflecting a pure sacred idea, was the highest goal of a composer. This disco- very confirms our image of the unity and integrity of the entire artistic system of Middle Ages and Renais- sance temple art, in which music held a place of honor. As for musical form, this Manus mysterialis, like a di- vine hieroglyph, being an invisible and imperceptible spiritual truth, could have only been comprehended through the intellect.

See particularly: Don Michael Randel, "Form", The New Harvard Dictionary of Music (Cambrige; London: The Belknap Press of Harvard University Press, 1986), 320-321; Kühn, "Form", 608-609. In the last article we read: "Daß Form in den historischen Quellen überhaupt als kompositorischer Gegenstand abgehandelt wird, geschieht erst seit dem 18. Jh. [sic! - 1. G.] weil sich in früherer Musik Form gar nicht als substantielles Problem stellte, und weil sie wesenhaft zu instrumentaler Musik gehört. In den bedeutenden vokalen Gat- tungen der Renaissance - der Motette und Messe, ab dem 16. Jh. auch im Madrigal- trägt ein Text die Musik. Von ihm her sind die melodischen Phrasen ( soggetti ) erfunden, seine Gliederung bestimmt die musikalische Gliederung. Solange also Musik Text- vertonung ist, hat sie daran formalen Halt. Anfang, Verlauf, Ende sind durch Beginn, Fortgang und Schluß des Textes definiert.", 608. 7 I do not mean Coclico's teaching on music-rhetorical fi- gures, or Zarlino' s on counterpoint. In the sixteenth century these theories also belonged to the sphere of composition and form. 8 As we know, the leading philosophical movements of the Middle Ages and the Renaissance, particularly Scholasticism and Neo-Platonism, acknowledged the absolute superiority of form over matter. 9 During the 1470s Tinctoris served as music instructor for the family of the King of Naples Ferdinand I (Ferrante). 10 Johannes Tinctoris, Dictionary of Musical Terms. Ed. by Carl Parrish (New York: The Free Press of Glencoe, 1963), 41. 11 "La forma, cioè la proportione, che si addimanda cagione formale; ... la Forma è quella specie, o similitudine, o vogliam dire essemptio, che ritiene la cosa in se, per la quale è detta tale. . . Et questa si chiama cagione intrinseca. . . la quale è (per dir cosi) il Modello, o vogliam dire Essemptio, alla cui similitudine si fa alcuna cosa, sicome è quella della Consonanza, che è la proportio- ne di numero a numero". Gioseffo Zarlino, Le istitutioni har- moniche (facs. ed. of Venice 1558 edition, New York: Broude Brothers, 1965), 54. 12 "Il Musico nelle sue operationi havendo rigardo al fine, che lo muove all'operare, ritrova la Materia, overo il Soggetto, sopra' 1 quale viene a fondare la sua compositione, e cosi viene a condurre a perfettione l'opera sua, secondo il preposto fine' (ibid., 171). The word "fine" has many meanings, among them "pur- pose", "idea", "design", "project" as well as "any object's contour that outlines its form". See Salvatore Battaglia, Grande dizionario della lingua italiana (Torino: Unione Tipografico- Editrice Torinese, 1972), voi. 5, 1025, 1027-1028. 13 "secondo la dottrina di Tolomeo. . . tutte le cose che sono nella Natura, hanno per principio la Materia, il Moto e la Forma" and further: "Accioche meritamente anco dimostri la Scientia commune delle Forme appartinenti alla Ragione, la quale con nome proprio è detta Mathematica, che non appartenga solamen- te alle specula tioni delle cose belle, come forse hanno pensato al- cuni; ma per la dimostratione e medita tione che le amministrano, istrutta dalla Consequenza istessa." Gioseffo Zarlino, Sopplimenti musicali (New York: Broude Brothers, 1979), lib. I, cap. 12, 34-35. Zarlino's grasp of the form in the entire spectrum of its definitions reflects the age-old tradition of West European philosophy, which traces its origins to ancient Greek sources: Plato's Timaeus (the concept of the transcendental nature of ideas) and Aristotle's Metaphysics , where the idea-form is defined as the primary principle of existence, and the essence of existence is embodied in all things through the fusion of the four first causes of exis- tence - idea, matter, motion (the coming into being), and purpose (the result). Thus musical theory reconciles the adherents of the two philosophical camps, who for centuries engaged in long and bitter arguments in their search for truth. This dispute is reflected in Raphael's famous fresco The School of Athens. 14 I will mention only several of the authors who researched this subject: Manfred F. Bukofzer, Marcus van Crevel, Marianne Henze, Edgar H. Sparks, Willem Elders, Judith Cohen, Richard Taruskin, Michael Long. 15 This refers to complete five movement ordinaries only. 16 This number includes seven anonymous cycles and three Masses by Walter Frye, Richard Cox and John Plummer. Unfortu- nately most of English cycles are preserved without Kyrie. 17 With the exception of three incomplete cycles De feria and two Masses Pro defunctis. 18 The following Masses have not been analyzed: De feria (incomplete cycle), the requiem Mass De profundis , the 18-voice Mass Tues Petrus , as well as the nine Mantuan Masses, the so-call- ed alternatim missae, that are different in structure. 19 The program "Mamys", © Irene Guletsky, 2005. Since the overall structure in itself already constitutes what is essentially a complex of structures, the program makes it possible to obtain not one but an entire series of charts (5-10), namely: the cycle's designs, plotted in relation to the vertical and the horizontal axes of coordinates, which correspondingly reflect the 92</page><page sequence="25">Music in Art XXXIII/1-2 (2008) spatial - temporal aspects of the form. In addition, we can also obtain the design of the three-part macro-level of the cycle (see below); and finally, the multi-level design that reflects the form's hierarchy, from the smallest structures to the level of the full-scale composition. Since analysis of all of the aforementioned types of Mass design calls for a full-fledged monograph, in this article I will limit myself to discussing the //vertical,/ charts, corres- ponding to the concept of the cycle's "spatial" design. At the same time, I will do my best also to show the way the overall structure interacts with the other structures and parameters of the form. 20 The symmetrical arched form represents a particular in- stance of the so-called "convex curve", common to the forms of Western music, which possesses directionality (Dalia Cohen and Shlomo Dubnov, "Gestalt Phenomena in Musical Texture", Music , Gestalt and Computing. Ed. by Marc Leman (Berlin: Springer, 1997), 386-405. 21 See my "The Mirror-Symmetry, the Fibonacci Series and the Golden Section in the Renaissance Mass Composition", Sym- metry: Culture and Science IX/ 2-4 (1998), 231-247; "Proportions in Palestrina's Masses", Palestrina e l'Europa: Atti del III convegno internationale di studi. Ed. by Giancarlo Rostirolla, Stefania Soldati and Elena Zomparelli (Palestrina: Fondazione G. Pierluigi da Pa- lestrina, 2006), 329-340. (The last article was printed without full proof corrections. My apologies to the reader for its poor typo- graphical condition). More in detail on this subject see in I. Guletsky, "Palestrina7 s Masses as the Culmination of the Re- naissance Large Scale Form" (Ph.D. diss., The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, 2000), 54-59, 103-156. 22 Absolute symmetry of proportions is very rarely encoun- tered in cycles. More often than not, equality of corresponding movements refers to their relative equality, which allows for small discrepancies in size (usually from one or two to five or seven bars). Furthermore, it should be noted that some Masses, including those cited in figure 1, the cycles of Obrecht, Brumel and La Rue, exhibit a strictly symmetrical design without taking into account Osanna II, which is marked as ut supra in these cyc- les. This fact, together with others that cannot be examined here, testifies to the special role played by Osanna ut supra , and merits a separate study. 23 I have used the number of syllables of the Ordinary text cited by Marianne Henze in her book Studien zu den Messenkom- positionen J. Ockeghems (Berlin: Merseburger, 1968), 34. 24 The protoform is the original, i.e. the most ancient and most stable level of the form. The protoform of the Ordinary is hierarchical, and includes a number of fundamental structures: the overall structure (made up of five main movements); the se- mantic structure; the functional and structural macro-levels; the sub-level of composition (which sets the sections of every move- ment); and the textual structure. For a more detailed discussion of this issue, see Guletsky, "The Mirror-Symmetry", 233-234. 25 Joseph Schmidt-Görg, History of the Mass (Köln: Arno Volk, 1968), 5. 26 See the general figure of liturgy in the article by Steiner, "Mass", 770. 27 Despite the somewhat "blunted" use of this hierarchy in works of art (with only the central part emphasized as a rule), the hierarchy is nevertheless rigidly maintained in the composition, since the closer the figures are placed in relation to the center - the divine presence - the greater the importance attached to them in the church canon. 28 The similarity between the Mass's overall design and the cathedral layout is even more obvious when we collate the ob- tained charts in their entirety. Thus, for example, if the Mass's "vertical" chart corresponds to the cathedral's transverse or façade, the "horizontal" chart, usually shaped in the form of a cross, clearly resembles the cathedral's horizontal layout, which, more often than not, also exhibits the form of the Catholic cross. The principle of analogy and similarity is a crucial element of the philosophical and artistic thinking of the time. It derives from the concepts of man's creation in God's image and likeness, of the similarity between the microcosm (man) and macrocosm (the universe), and accordingly the successive series of similarities where definite places are also reserved for the man/ church and church/ Mass pairs: "Seeing man is beautiful and perfectest work of God, and his image, and also the lesser world [i.e. the micro- cosm - I.G.]; therefore he by a more perfect composition, and sweet harmony, and more sublime dignity doth contain and maintain in himself all numbers, measures, weights, elements, and all other things which are of his composition; . . . From hence all the ancients in time past ... seem to prove that from the very joints of man's body all numbers, measures, proportions, and harmonies were invented; hence according to this measures of the body, they framed, and contrived their temples, palaces, houses, theaters ... and every kind of artifice..." Henrich Cornelius Agrippa von Nettesheim, De occulta philosophia libri tres (1533), vol. 2, 27. See idem, Three Books of Occult Philosophy. Ed. by Donald Tyson (St. Paul: Llewellyn Pulications, 1997), 345. The fundamental work that paved the ground for the relevant direction in musicology and art studies, wherein music and visual arts are examined from the standpoint of their unifying features, belongs to Curt Sachs, The Commonwealth of Art: Style in the Fine Arts , Music and Dance (New York: W.W. Norton, 1946). 29 The remaining cycles of this period fall accordingly into other groups, to be discussed below. 30 As a rule, this pattern of paired sections was noted by scholars in every parameter, but not in the proportions of the overall structure. 31 As for the last statement, the author's opinion can be call- ed into question: strictly speaking, a three-part design can only appear in the Agnus Dei, while the Kyrie in plainchant Masses often employs four verses (Kyrie I, Christe, Kyrie II, Kyrie III), a situation we find also in the Mass of Tournai and the Mass by Machaut. In Gregorian Masses the Sanctus is usually arranged in five verses, while in the early polyphonic Masses it does not yet have a firmly established structure. 32 Bukofzer, "Caput" , 219. 33 Bukofzer, "Caput", 278. The unique nature of the Kyrie in Ockeghem's Masses is also commented on by Fabrice Fitch: "Ky- rie is a separate entity within the Mass: it has the greatest melodic freedom of all the movements, but is also the most strictly indebted to the structure of its model". Johannes Ockeghem: Masses and Models (Paris: H. Champion, 1997), 76. The somewhat isolated character of the Kyrie, which is due to the more complex version of the motto, also takes place in Du Fay's Masses based on chanson. See David Fallows, Dufay (2nd ed., London: J.M. Dent &amp; Sons Ltd, 1987), 206. 34 Bukofzer, Caput , 301. 35 I would like to stress that what the figures show is not the gestures themselves but their symbols, since all we see are the "fingers". However, the fingers are the most expressive part of the hand. After all, it is the arrangement of fingers that allows us to easily identify a certain gesture. 36 In the Middle Ages the extended middle finger symbol- ized Truth and Justice. Betty J. Bäumel and Franz H. Bäumel, A Dictionary of Gestures (Metuchen, N.J.: The Scarecrow Press, 1975), 83. 93</page><page sequence="26">Irene Guletsky, Manus Mysterialis : The Symbolism of Form in the Renaissance Mass 37 The wide range of interpretation of the typical models is also explainable by the fact that a gesture in its essence is a dyna- mic and variable but not a static symbol. This feature is very im- portant for music as a dynamic (//fluid,/) art. (I am indebted to Dorothea Baumann for this valuable remark). 38 In principle, the composer could also simultaneously rely on models of other structures of already existing compositions, such as the mensural-rhythmic pattern of the cantus firmus. One example of this is Obrechťs L'Homme armé Mass, which borrows this structure from Busnoys' s Mass by the same name. See Oliver Strunk, "The Origins of the "L'Homme armé7 Mass,r, Essays on Music in the Western World (New York: W. W. Norton, 1974), 68-69. 39 The first Masses on the tune of L'Homme armé by Ocke- ghem, Busnoys and Du Fay appeared in the wake of Ockeghem' s Caput Mass (during the 1450s). However, while Ockeghem sub- jects his own model to considerable variations in the new work, Busnoys follows it almost verbatim (as a sign of respect for his older colleague?). On the chronology of these Masses and their dating, see Fitch, Johannes Ockeghem , 56-64. 40 Stylization is known to have been one of the most com- mon iconographie techniques employed in medieval art. The ima- ge of the stylized hand is encountered sometimes in solmization treatises of the Middle Ages and Renaissance. See Susan Forscher Weiss, "Disce manum tuam si vis bene discere cantum: Symbols of Learning Music in Early Modern Europe", this Journal XXX / 1- 2 (2005), 38. 41 The number of the volume edited by Franz Xaver Haberl is listed in parenthesis whenever there is another Mass bearing the same name. Pierluigi da Palestrina's Werke , vols. X-XXIV, XXXII (Leipzig, 1880-1888). 42 In the sixteenth century it was found only in three Pa- lestrina's Masses. 43 This anonymous Mass was first attributed to Du Fay by Laurence Feininger, and also by Heinrich Besseler, who included it in the composer's collected work. (Guillaume Dufay, Opera omnia, ed. by H. Besseler, 6 vols. Corpus mensurabilis musicae 1 (Roma: American Institute of Musicology, 1951-66) ii/6. How- ever, other scholars, among them Wolfgang Nitschke and Alejandro Enrique Planchart, cast doubt on Du Fay's authorship, leaning in favor of his younger contemporary, Johannes Martini. 44 As we know, the Tournai Mass, and other anonymous fourteenth century Masses, have not been regarded until now as homogenous compositions possessing artistic unity. Nevertheless, a thorough analysis of the musical fabric and form of these works refutes the commonly accepted viewpoint. This issue is the focus of my article "The Four 14th-Century Anonymous Masses: Their Form, The Restoration of Incomplete Cycles and The Identifica- tion of Some Authors", Acta musicologica (forthcoming). Besides, we must make clear the question of the number of movements of the Mass of Tournai. Like Machauťs Notre Dame, this cycle is considered to be a six-movement work, since the Agnus Dei is followed by the Ite missa est. However, according to a number of indicators I cite in the aforementioned article, the Ite does not constitute the sixth part of the cycle. It either served as a separate piece (Missa Tournai), or may have been treated by the composer as an additional section of the Agnus Dei (Missa Notre Dame by Machaut). 45 This Mass was identified by Besseler as one of the St. Anthony Masses mentioned by Du Fay in his will. There, the composer names two Masses, one of which was dedicated to St. Anthony of Padua, and the other to St. Anthony, the Abbot of the Viennois church. Besseler mistook the surviving Ordinary for the Abbot Mass, and published it under the title Missa de Sancii Antonii Viennensis, believing the Mass of St. Anthony of Padua to be lost (Dufay: Opera omnia, ii/1). However, David Fallows in his book makes the convincing case that the Mass in question is actually the cycle of St. Anthony of Padua, while the Mass of St. Anthony the Abbot has been lost (Dufay, 182-193). 46 In support of his hypothesis, the scholar cites serious ar- guments, such as the coincidence of the dates, Du Fay's location during the relevant period, the number of singers required to perform this Mass as specified by the composer in his will, and the number of "monks" that accompanied Du Fay on his journey at the time (Fallows, Dufay, 66-68, 185-87). 47 This cycle possibly forms a part of a plenary double cycle, which also included one or two sets of Proper. Ibid., 187-191; see also Alejandro Enrique Planchart, "Du Fay", The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians (London: Macmillan, 2001), vol. 7, 653. 48 An analogous case is encountered in Du Fay's motet Nu- per rosarum flores , where the composer probably reproduces the architectural proportions of the famous dome by Brunelleschi, erected over the Florentine cathedral of Santa Maria del Fiore in 1436 (Charles W. Warren, " Brunelleschi' s Dome and Dufay's Motet", The Music Quarterly LIX/1 (January 1973), 92-105), or what seems to me more convincing, the proportions of the King Solomon's Temple (Craig Wright, "Dufay's Nuper rosarum flores, King Solomon's Temple, and the Veneration of the Virgin", Journal of the American Musicological Society XL VII/ 3 (fall 1994), 395-441). It must be noted that Fallows once tried to find evidence to corroborate his hypothesis regarding the dating and the intent of the Mass not only in available indirect historical facts, but also di- rectly in the formal connection between Du Fay's cycle and the Donattello's altar. However, this hypothesis has not found enough support. See his article "Dufay, la sua messa per Sanť Antonio da Padova e Donatello", Rassegna di musica veneta II- III (1986-87), 3-19 and Eleonora M. Beck, "Revisiting Dufay's Saint Antony Mass and Its Connection to Donatello' s Altar of Saint Antony of Padua", this Journal 26/1-2 (2001), 5-19. 49 Fallows, Dufay, 70, 196; Planchart, "Du Fay", 650. 50 Their scale also coincided with that of the analogous movements in the Tournai Mass. In all likelihood, Du Fay had the opportunity to view the Tournai manuscript when he was appointed canon at the Tournai cathedral in September of 1436. Planchart, "Du Fay", 649. 51 On this Mass see in: Fallows, Dufay, 194-99, Andrew Hughes, Style and Symbol (Ottava: The Institute of Mediaeval Music, 1989), 405, Julia Evdokimova, Istoria polifonii. 2A (Moskva: Muzyka, 1989), 128-30. 52 See footnote 43. 53 Besseler surmises that this Mass preceded the Se la face ay pale. Dufay, Opera omnia, iii/IV. 54 On the symbolic meaning of the right and left hands in church iconography and also for the transmission of joy and sorrow, see chapter 7. 55 The framework of the article does not enable me to exa- mine other design groups within this aspect. I hope to devote a separate article to this issue. In light of the above, one cannot help recalling the profound observation made by Manfred Bukofzer. Even though it refers to the use of the antiphon melisma in the Caput Masses, it is highly relevant and applicable to the issue of Mass composition and form as a whole: "We have here a striking example of how the fields of liturgical history, iconography, and music elucidate one another, how the one becomes intelligible only through the other". Bukofzer, Caput, 240. 94</page><page sequence="27">Music in Art XXXIII/ 1-2 (2008) 56 See Manfred F. Bukofzer, "The Music of the Old Hall Manuscript" and "The Fountains Fragment", Studies in Medieval &amp; Renaissance Music (New York: W.W.

However, very few examples of compound "cycles" with a double authorship have actually sur- vived. Thus it is impossible to determine how widespread this practice was. On the other hand, as pointed out by Reinhard Strohm, separate parts or pairs from a complete cycle could have been occasionally inserted by the scribe in different places in the manuscript; or portions of the cycle could have been omitted alto- gether. This accounts for the fact that initially complete cycles have survived only in fragments. Reinhard Strohm, The Rise of European Music , 1380-1500 (New York: Cambridge University Press, 1993), 171. On the practice of "dispersion" in manuscripts of complete cycles, see also Andrew Kirkman, "The Invention of the Cyclic Mass," Journal of the American Musicological Society LIV / 1 (spring 2000), 13. The possible "victim" of this dispersion was the incomplete Toulouse Mass, as well as other fourteenth- to early-fifteenth-century Masses, of which we know nothing today. 58 Johannes Ockeghem, 71, 85, 110, 117, 126. 59 See Willi Apel, Gregorian Chant (Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1958), 420 and note 28; also Geoffrey Chew, "The Early Cyclic Mass as an Expression of Royal and Papal Su- premacy", Music and Letters LIII/3 (July 1972), 254. 60 Dom Dominique Gatta, "Aux origines du Kyriale", Revue grégorienne XXXIV (1955), 175. In these cycles, the Credo was still frequently assigned a separate place, which, according to Hoppin, was probably due to practical considerations. Richard H. Hoppin, "Reflections on the Origin of the Cyclic Mass", Liber amicorum Charles van den Borren (Antwerpen: L. Anversois, 1964), 86-87. 61 According to the number symbolism, which had a great significance in the church culture and got its peak in the thir- teenth century, the number five was associated with microcosm, with living nature, with building of human body (pentagram), with a hand, even with its fingers, and with counting (in general).

Nam ibi est peritia numeri sive numerandi et artis musice et kalendarii et aurei numeri et adinventionis paschalis festivitatis. Simili modo in Scriptura divina preter litteralem sive hystoricum sensum repperitur allegoricus intellectus, anagogicus, tropologicus, mora- lis et misticus, et ex hoc utilior et nobilior iudicatur quam si tan- tum ad unum intellectum coartata uni intellectui deserviret." (We can add further evidence to the aforesaid: we see that beyond common use and custom the left hand has a multitude of uses, as even the peasants and unlettered know. For therein are found the skills of ciphering and music-making [italics I.G.], of the calendar and the golden number, as well as the calculation of the date of Easter. Similarly, in Holy Scripture there is a sense beyond the literal or historical, for one must take into account the allegorical, the anagogical, the tropological, the moral, and the mysti- cal - from which fact the Scripture is judged to be far more useful and noble than if it were restricted to the one sense alone).

In her excellent paper, giving historical excursus on the Gui- donian hand, Susan Forscher Weiss writes: "The hand was in- tended to help the student accomplish mnemonic feats, serving as a cognitive map, as well as an iconic metaphor in a number of disciplines besides of music, such as language (grammar and rhe- toric), mathematics (finger reckoning and computus ), religion, phi- losophy, medicine, astrology, alchemy, architecture, meditation and palmistry" ("Disce Manum", 38).

These interpretations are based at the Middle Ages tradition developed by the eleventh- to thirteenth- century writers such as Honorius Augustodunensis, Sicardus, Durandus and other. See also Timmers, Christelijke Symboliek , 172; and Sauer, Symbolik des Kirchengebäudes , 12-49, 98-123. 74 Quite possibly, it was not the Mass that borrowed the cathedral design. Rather, both designs - of the Mass and of the cathedral, both symmetrical and asymmetrical - depicted the same symbol- a hand, or a gesture. What makes this supposition even more plausible is the fact that the first gothic cathedrals date to the same period as does the birth of the Mass Ordinary, i.e. to the eleventh century. 75 "For I lift up my hand to heaven, and say, I live for ever" (Deuteronomy 32:40). "the right hand of the Lord doeth valiantly. The right hand of the Lord is exalted: the right hand of the Lord doeth valiantly" (Psalm 118: 15, 16). 76 Agrippa of Nettesheim is a prominent sixteenth-century philosopher and occultist, whose works summarized the centu- ries-old traditions of Neo-Platonism, occultism and magic, Chris- tian mysticism and cabbala. In Agrippa7 s classification, contained in his treatise De occulta philosophia libri tres (1533), there are three types of magic that correspond to the three realms of existence: natural magic, which belongs to the world of matter and incor- porates medicine and natural philosophy; heavenly (quintessen- tial) magic, which belongs to the world of stars and planets and includes mathematical disciplines, among them astronomy (astro- logy) and music; and super-heavenly (ceremonial) magic, which belongs to the realm of higher intelligences, and includes theol- ogy. To each of these three types of magic, Agrippa devoted one of the books of his treatise. On this issue see also: Gary Tom- linson, Music in the Renaissance Magic : Toward a Historiography of Others (Chicago; London: The University of Chicago Press, 1993), 44-52, 61-66. 77 See footnote 62, and Franz Lissen, Musik und Alchemie (Tutzing: Hans Schneider, 1969), 68. 78 Works that belong to the hermetic genre include alchemi- cal treatises, whose text and illustrations conceal rather than reveal the true meaning from the reader. Only those who held the right key could discover the actual substance of these texts beneath the layer of symbols and allegories. Medieval gothic cathedrals are nothing short of true hermetic encyclopedias (see, for instance, Fulcanelli, Le Mystere des Cathedrales (Albuquerque, N.M.: Brotherhood of Life, 1984). Interesting observations regard- ing this issue were produced by Otto J.Gombosi discussing the mystical and hermetic nature of Machauťs Mass: "The other factor is entirely outside of the sensuous. It concerns itself with the higher order of metric units and lines by bringing them into a complex system of symmetries. It transgresses the proper limits and limitations of music as a perceptible order of tones, and acquires an abstract spatial quality. It mirrors a world outlook that is idealistic and transcendental, mystic and hieratic, Gothic and scholastic. It is other-worldly."
