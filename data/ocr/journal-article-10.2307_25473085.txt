<plain_text><page sequence="1">RECOMMENDED FILMS | 337 LISA MIGHETTO going wild THESE FILMS, Never Cry Wolf (Carroll Ballard, 1983) and Grizzly Man (Werner Herzog, 2005), have more to say about humans than about wolves or grizzlies. Like many of the best wildlife movies, they examine the ways in which humans struggle to understand the rest of the natural world and their place in it. Both films feature lone men venturing into the wild to test themselves, and both offer compelling journeys of self-discovery. However, their visions of nature are vastly divergent, imparting different messages about the ability of humans to connect with other creatures. Never Cry Wolf is based on Farley Mowat's nonf iction book recounting his government-sponsored trip to northern Canada, where he observed wolves and analyzed whether they were responsible for declining caribou herds. The actor Charles Martin Smith is charming as Tyler, the central character, who takes on this assignment "to find that basic animal I secretly hoped was hidden somewhere in myself." With macho overtones, Tyler explains that what made the arctic appealing for him was "all the dangerous things lurking there." Before he boards the bush plane that will drop him in a remote location many miles north, a crusty figure at the Hotel Caribou adds a sense of foreboding. "You will be the only fresh meat," he warns. The film's stunning scenery-sweeping views of mountain peaks, ice fields, and tundra-reinforces Tyler's isolation as he tries to establish a camp in this wilderness. He is woefully unprepared for the challenge, and the film makes much of his inept survival skills as well as the government's ignorance of conditions in the Far North. Scenes of him plucking a frozen sock from his sleeping bag and wondering what to do with the light bulbs and other useless supplies packed for him are presented with gentle humor, making Tyler a sympathetic character. Tyler adjusts to the arctic environment at the same time he moves close to the wolves. Although mostly an observer, he does interact with the animals, at one point urinating around the camp to mark his territory. Tyler's narration emphasizes that wolves mate for life, adopt orphans, and cooperate in teams. He further humanizes them by naming them "George" and "Angeline"-there is even an "Uncle Albert" that watches over the pups. Clearly Tyler identifies with the animals and at one point says he envies them. Surprised to discover the wolves eating mice, he does the same to prove that a large carnivore can subsist on a diet of small rodents. One of the final scenes depicts Tyler running naked with a herd of caribou with the wolves in pursuit, which seemed over-the-top to this reviewer, but which serves to blur the boundary between human and wolf, solidifying Tyler's bond with the creatures. The scene closes with his realization that the wolves were killing only sick caribou, and by thus culling the herd they were keeping it healthy. Lisa Mighetto, "Going Wild," Environmental History 12 (April 2007): 337-40.</page><page sequence="2">338 | ENVIRONMENTAL HISTORY 12 (APRIL 2007) The message for Tyler, and presumably for the viewer, is that contrary to previous assump tions, wolves aren't "aggressive" and "bad," and because they perform a useful function are deserving of protection and consideration. While it romanticizes wolves, the film demonizes humans-and it ends with the destruction of the alpha wolves. Despite Tyler's claim that there are "no heroes or villains," most people in the film, viewed through his perspective, come across as greedy and self indulgent exploiters. At the very least humans are intruders. Only the Inuit have wisdom and a sensible perspective, noting that "this place doesn't belong to man." In the end, Tyler is redeemed by his deep, if short-lived, connection with the wolves. This film seems very much a product of the 1980s. Released in iIIIIIm -: l Image ? Buena Vista Pictures. Poster for A/ever Cry Wolf (1983). 1983, it was one of my favorite movies when I was a graduate student, and watching it again more than twenty years later reminded me how Barry Lopez and others during the late 1970s and 1980s had sparked an interest in wolves, revising their longstanding reputation as cruel, bloodthirsty creatures. In Never Cry Wolf, Carroll Ballard, known for films such as The Black Stallion (1979), once again had produced a beautiful story of a lone, struggling figure saved by his bonding with animals. Grizzly Man, a more recent film, explores many of the same themes as Never Cry Wolf while offering a different vision of the natural world. It is a haunting documentary about Timothy Treadwell, an amateur naturalist and filmmaker who spent thirteen summers in Alaska living unarmed among grizzlies. This movie, narrated by its director, Werner Herzog, tells Treadwell's story by interviewing friends and acquaintances and by piecing together Treadwell's footage of bears in the wild. In a manner reminiscent of Tyler's narration, Treadwell announces his intention to "run wild" with the bears, placing himself at the "precipice of death." He further describes himself as a "kind warrior" and "master" of the animals, claiming ominously that he would "not die at their claws and paws." Seeking to explore "the secret life of bears," Treadwell, like Tyler, hoped to correct misconceptions about grizzlies. "I think they've been misunderstood," he explains. This film is not gentle like Never Cry Wolf, however, as the narration reveals early</page><page sequence="3">RECOMMENDED FILMS | 339 Image ? Lionsgate Films. A still from Timothy Treadwell's own footage of grizzly bears, as edited and presented by director Werner Herzog in Grizzly Man (2005). on that Treadwell and his girlfriend, who accompanied him in his last few excursions, were killed by a grizzly at the end of his thirteenth season. The irony of the film is that for all his years living with and studying grizzlies, Treadwell misunderstood these animals-and knowing his fate makes watching him interact with them a painful experience. "I'm in love with my animal friends," he tells the camera at one point. "I am one of them." Like Tyler, Treadwell wanted to connect with the bears, to establish some kind of kinship. One disturbing shot shows him reaching out to a cub, which looks more dangerous than cuddly. And while he describes "Mr. Chocolate" as "my good friend," there is no evidence that this large male bear, hovering in the background with formidable teeth and claws, feels the same way. Shots of Treadwell in his tent holding his childhood teddy bear add poignancy to his final encounter with a grizzly. This film offers spectacular footage of the bears, but Treadwell occupies center stage. Like Never Cry Wolf, this is a story of self-discovery. As presented in his film clips, Treadwell is an enigmatic character, fraught with contradictions. A quixotic, self-appointed caretaker and protector of the bears, he does not clearly explain or demonstrate the threat. While he views other humans as intruders, Treadwell builds a channel for spawning salmon so that the fish could reach the bears-a manipulative, if not invasive, act. His camera becomes his confessional, as much of his narrative examines his troubled past and his motivations for moving into bear country. The grizzlies provide Treadwell with an identity, as the title of the film indicates. "I had no life and now I have a life," he says at one revealing point. One of Grizzly Man's chief values is its attempt to find meaning in Treadwell's experience. In interview excerpts, some people question Treadwell's common</page><page sequence="4">340 | ENVIRONMENTAL HISTORY 12 (APRIL 2007) sense, while others portray his fatal encounter with the bear in moralistic and anthropomorphic terms. The pilot who found his body, for example, calls the animal that killed him "a dirty rotten bear that he didn't like anyway." Even Herzog describes the bear as a "murderer," instead of as a hungry wild animal or a creature motivated by forces that we might never understand. Like the Inuit in Never Cry Wolf, an Alutiiq from Kodiak Island explains that bears live in a "different world" from humans-one whose boundaries should be respected. He portrays Treadwell's actions as invasive and potentially damaging to grizzlies, because he habituated the bears to humans. Grizzly Man is a complex film, in part because there are two voices and two visions presented here: Treadwell's and Herzog's. Although Treadwell's views as presented in this movie are the result of Herzog's editing, it seems clear that he romanticized the bears, while Herzog sees indifference rather than kinship in the natural world. Herzog's is the dominant view here-and Grizzly Man shows the terrible consequences of misunderstanding the natural world and assuming a benevolent bond that does not exist. While Never Cry Wolf is an uplifting film that minimizes the dangers that wild animals can pose to humans, Grizzly Man horrifies as well as fascinates us. Both Never Cry Wolfand Grizzly Man offer a mesmerizing look at how humans interact with other animals and both offer awe-inspiring footage of wolves and bears in their habitats. Despite the promotional posters for both, which feature isolated men and ferocious beasts, these are not adventure stories about rugged heroes battling the predators of the Far North. These movies are about vulnerable characters forced to confront themselves in difficult circumstances and to reflect on their relation to the wondrous creatures around them-and that's what places them in the best tradition of wildlife films.
