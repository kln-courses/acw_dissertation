A member of a prominent New Light family, Smith entered Princeton in 1767 from his father's academy at Pequea, Pennsylvania, and graduated in 1769 in the first class under Wither spoon. He so distinguished himself academically that at commence ment on September 27, 1769, he was chosen—as James Madison, a fellow student and later friend, reported—to deliver "the Head Ora tion, which is always given to the greatest Scholar by the President and Tutors." After graduation Smith spent a short period as a teacher at Pequea Academy and then came back to Nassau Hall in 1770 to be a tutor and to read for the ministry under Witherspoon. In 1773 he left Princeton, obtained a license to preach from the Presbytery of New Castle, and went to Virginia as a missionary. Once in Virginia, in 1774 he helped to establish, and became first rector of, Prince Edward, later Hampden-Sidney, Academy. Mar riage to Ann Witherspoon on June 28, 1775, insured his father-in law's interest in his career, and, through Witherspoon's efforts, Smith returned to Princeton as professor of moral philosophy in 1779. During the remaining years of the Revolution, when the college struggled to stay alive, Smith became its effective head in Witherspoon's frequent absence at the Continental Congress. Since failing eyesight and poor health limited Witherspoon's activities * A Faculty Research Award from the General Research Board of the University of Maryland for the summer of 1968 aided in the research for and writing of this article. 189</page><page sequence="2">Journal of Presbyterian History after Independence, Smith continued as de facto president. In recognition of his actual position the board of trustees appointed him professor of divinity in 1783 and vice president in 1786. Election as president in 1795 after Witherspoon's death merely con firmed Smith in the office he had already filled for sixteen years.1 Under Witherspoon's sponsorship Smith entered into the activi ties of the Church. With Witherspoon he was a member of several of the committees of the Church in the late 1780's to draw up a new constitution. As far as the records of these proceedings are available, they indicate that Smith acted to further Witherspoon's views on church reorganization. In one sense Smith played a more important role in fitting the Church to the demands of Inde pendence than Witherspoon, for the latter found his efforts handi capped by physical infirmity and by opposition to him from Old Light ministers, though Smith, of course, also faced the hostility of the Old Lights. Whenever Smith attended the meetings of the General Assembly in the 1790's, he took an active part in its delib erations. His election as Moderator in 1799 demonstrated the influential position he had attained. Indeed his career seemed to indicate he would end his life the figure in the Church that Witherspoon had been.2 Smith possessed too much ability ever simply to follow tamely in Witherspoon's footsteps. At Princeton he proved a capable administrator and teacher in his own right. Perhaps the most perceptive evaluation of him came from Philip Lindsley, presi dent of the University of Nashville. Lindsley, at one time a student and tutor under Smith, wrote that when he came to Prince ton in 1802, Smith's "superior talents and accomplishments . . . were every where spoken of and acknowledged. . . . We thought not only that he was equal to every emergency, but that no other man could have succeeded so well."

Lindsley, who had experienced similar adminis trative problems at Nashville, asserted that "of the government of the College, at this period of its greatest prosperity, under President Smith, I can hardly use any language too favourable. . . . My present deliberate opinion is, that he was one of the ablest and most successful disciplinarians of any age." 3 In the Church Smith's great abilities attracted equally favorable notice. His intellect, eloquence, and personal dignity made him one of its outstanding members. His years as a missionary in Virginia made such lasting impression that Lindsley recalled, "I happened, while on a visit to Virginia in 1810, to meet with several elderly persons who had heard him preach, when a young man. They spoke of him as an impassioned orator,—like Whitefield or their own Davies and Henry." 4 An anonymous obituary in the Port Folio in 1820, obviously written by one who had known Smith well, concluded that he "had, perhaps, no superior in this country, for a dignified, classical, and impressive eloquence." 5 In spite of his ability, the end of Smith's life belied his earlier prominence. He found himself forced out of Princeton and estranged from the dominant group in the Church. In 1812 the General Assembly created the Princeton Theological Seminary for the training of ministers, an act directly opposed to the tradition to which Smith was loyal, that the education appropriate for the ministry and any other profession were the same. The need for an expanded ministry to convert the West and the fear that Nassau Hall no longer instilled piety and orthodox doctrine in its students were largely responsible for this step. Samuel Miller, one of the founders of the Seminary and its first professor of ecclesiastical history and church government, expressed a general sentiment when he wrote that separation was vital "if it be desired to have the divinity-school uncontaminated by the college . . . and its ortho 3 Lindsley to William B.

Even within Princeton Smith came under attack. In the first decade of the nineteenth century frequent student riots and falling enrollment made many members of the governing board of Princeton think him no longer able effectively to discharge the duties of his office; consequently, interference by the trustees plagued the last years of his administration. By 1812 dissatisfaction with him had grown to such an extent that in effect he was forced to resign. Withdrawal from the college mirrored his fate in the Church. The record of his attendance in the Gen eral Assembly tells something of his story. From 1801 to his death in 1819 he was a member only in 1804 and 1811, in contrast to his more frequent attendance in the 1790's. Smith spent the years after 1812 a saintly and respected figure in the town of Prince ton, but one stripped of his former influence.6 Smith failed to live up to his promise as Witherspoon's heir in part because of his poor health. He had suffered from tubercu losis since his days at Hampden-Sidney, and the disease steadily sapped his vitality. Periodically the demands of Princeton proved too great, most notably in the struggle to rebuild after the Revolu tion and in the early 1800's. In 1803 he attempted to share his burden by asking Ashbel Green, then a minister in Philadelphia, to undertake the role that Smith had assumed under Witherspoon. Green, however, refused the offer to become professor of theology and vice president. Ironically he did come to Princeton later, but in quite different circumstances, as Smith's successor. By 1812 tuberculosis and the cares of office had so undermined Smith's health that at his last commencement he could do little more than present the diplomas to the graduating class.7 Although Smith inherited the mantle of Witherspoon, he al ways lacked what had given Witherspoon so much authority in American Presbyterianism—the prestige conferred by his Scottish e Miller to Ashbel Green, May 10, 1808, in Samuel Miller, Jr., The Life of Samuel Miller (Philadelphia, 1869), I, 242.

Having Witherspoon's prestige might have compensated for a critical flaw in Smith's personality. He was as urbane and cultivated a person as eighteenth century Presbyterianism ever produced, but he was never a fighter in the tradition of Wither spoon. When opposed, he ordinarily retreated behind a facade of good manners, instead of vigorously contending for his beliefs as had Witherspoon. Philip Lindsley caught his character with the remark that "he had enemies and he knew them. He was often misrepresented, and sometimes grossly slandered. But he uttered no words of complaint, or anger, or unkindness. I believe he for gave them and prayed for them." Yet Smith needed a more pugnacious personality, for, though always a supporter of ortho doxy, he both resented and resisted its tendency to become need lessly crusted and rigid. His willingness to sanction innovation made him suspect by the early 1800's when the dominant groups in the Church and at Princeton became increasingly intolerant of change, largely as a result of the radical secularism that seemed rampant in American society.8 None of these reasons, however, completely explain the isola tion of Smith's last years. Of equal importance was Smith's development of the thought of Witherspoon, for Smith was also heir to Witherspoon's philosophical and theological position. Witherspoon's ideas had been at best unsystematic and at worst in coherent. He had produced his college lectures in so hurried a fashion that on occasion they had proved dangerously superficial and embarrassingly eclectic. Certainly he was aware of their limitations; he never permitted their publication during his life time. Although Smith possessed a far keener and more inquisitive mind than Witherspoon, his thought grew out of the intellectual and religious position of his father-in-law. Smith's life may be described in part as a careful and sensitive unfolding of the conse quences of Witherspoon's thought. Surprisingly this process led to mildly unorthodox conclusions. Working within the framework of Witherspoon's views on natural and revealed religion and on philosophical realism, Smith arrived at positions that many in the Church and at the college found theologically suspect, if not heretical.9 8 Lindsley to Sprague, 344.

To one rooted in the common sense tradition, the truth of Christianity depended at least in part upon the conformity of faith to reason. As Smith put the matter in his Lectures on the Evidences of the Christian Religion (1809), men must possess objective evidence for their be liefs "that . . . faith may not be merely an enthusiastic and visionary confidence, but a rational offering to truth and reason." Such a statement merely echoed numerous others made by Wither spoon. However, Smith's defense of revelation did differ in im portant ways from that of his father-in-law. Witherspoon's, of course, had never assumed polished form. By contrast in numerous works Smith presented a detailed and systematic demonstration of the unity of reason and revelation.10 A deeper cause of difference between Smith and Witherspoon than comparative rigor of exposition lay in the infidelity each tried to overcome. Witherspoon had sought primarily a position in vulnerable to the attack of such thinkers as David Hume and Francis Hutcheson. In the Scottish common sense philosophy he had found rational justification for his acceptance of the scholastic logic and theology of the Westminster Confession. Though Smith faced popular freethinkers who traced their origins to the intel lectual milieu of Hutcheson and Hume, he confronted as well an other form of infidelity. The new danger in Smith's view came from natural science. "It has lately become a kind of cant," he wrote, "with certain superficial smatterers in physical science to speak of revealed religion, and of the spirit of piety as being hostile to profound researches into nature, lest they should be found to contradict the dogmas of revelation." Witherspoon had always contended that science confirmed the truth of religion. This conviction had sufficed to justify the greater emphasis he had given science in the Princeton curriculum. Smith, however, refused to be content with mere iteration as had Witherspoon. Because of a more passionate interest in ideas and science than Witherspoon ever possessed, Smith preferred to fight the opponents of revelation on the ground of natural science. As he explained his intention in An Essay on the Causes of the Variety of Complexion and Figure in the Human Species, "while others . . . are successfully defending the interior fortresses of religion, and extending her practical sway over the hearts of men, I thought that I might render a valuable service to the cause, by cooperating, in some degree, with those who 194 10 Evidences of Religion (Philadelphia), 3.

First published in 1787, it appeared in a second, more lengthy, edition in 1810. Although well in formed and competently done, it possessed no deep originality. Winthrop Jordan, its modern editor, has justly observed that its chief value consists in its being a position paper for the thought of an age. It offers numerous insights into the prevailing thought about the human species. No doubt the general curiosity, Ameri can and European, about the American habitat made Smith write it. The American Indian had first aroused his interest in the effect of environment on the human species. Three years before pub lishing the Essay, he had written to Charles Nisbet, then a minister in Scotland and later president of Dickinson College, that the study of "the character, and manners, and state of society among the savages, would make a very important part of the history of human nature." By the time the Essay took shape, Smith's interest in the savage had broadened into concern with the general conditions or laws that produced human difference. He wrote the Essay to prove the truth of the Mosaic account of creation, that all man kind were descended from a single pair. He accounted for the numerous varieties of the human species by reference to the opera tion of natural causes. In his terms the effect of climate, the state of society, and the manner of living determined changes in human physiogamy. After lengthy analysis of the evidence to support his position, Smith concluded that belief in a multiple creation was unscientific. By showing that natural causes produced human change, he had proved the unity of the species. It was "contrary to the laws of true philosophy to resort to the hypothesis of differ ent original species of men in order to explain varieties which can otherwise be accounted for from the known operation of natural causes." 12 The Essay developed logically from Witherspoon's intellectual and religious position. That Witherspoon was partly responsible for its appearance indicates his interest in its ideas. Smith unfolded 11 An Essay on the Causes of the Variety of Complexion and Figure in the Human Species, Winthrop Jordan, ed. (Cambridge, Mass., 1965), 3, 4. Sydney E.

Their encouragement led him to present his ideas publicly. The Essay proved an important document for the defense of the philosophy of Witherspoon. Its compatibility with the Mosaic account of creation enabled Smith to draw the favorite moral of Witherspoon, the harmony of reason with revela tion. "A just philosophy will always be found coincident with the true theology." The Essay performed in natural science much the same function that Witherspoon's principle of common sense had in philosophy. Smith's demonstration of the unity of the species provided an empirical scientific basis for common sense epistemol ogy. Realist philosophy depended for its validity upon the asser tion that all men perceived the objective world in essentially the same way, that the senses in other words were common to all men. If men were not descended from a single creation and were not of the same species, then Smith saw that they had to be of radically different natures, "subject to different laws both in the physical and moral constitution of their nature." As a consequence "the terms which one man would frame to express the ideas and emotions of his own mind must convey to another a meaning as different as the organization of their respective natures." A theory of multiple creations led to the same subjectivism as philosophical idealism. Thus, in one sense the Essay merely continued in natural science the struggle against David Hume that Witherspoon had begun.13 The Essay served as the foundation of the structure of natural religion Smith erected in A Comprehensive View of the Leading and Most Important Principles of Natural and Revealed Religion (1815; 2nd ed., 1816) and The Lectures, Corrected and Improved, Which Have Been Delivered for a Series of Years, in the College of New Jersey; on the Subjects of Moral and Political Philosophy (1812). By demonstrating the unity of the species, Smith made "the science of human nature, in all its relations . . . susceptible of system." Since all men were of the same species, they were capable of arriving at much the same natural knowledge of God. Smith's ideas about the moral knowledge naturally available to man are of particular interest. Since he had proved the uniformity of the species, he believed it possible to apply the methods of Newton to moral philosophy. By use of the inductive method, by rigorous appeals to human experience, Smith hoped to formulate laws of 196 is Smith to Ashbel Green, no date but circa 1817, Gratz Collection, Historical Society of Pennsylvania.

His interest in moral philosophy derived from the same source as that in the human species. He intended to demonstrate the harmony of reason and revelation. Unfortunately for him, however, the information he brought to bear on the attempt created difficulties for the very revelation he wished to defend.14 Smith's pursuit of natural religion seriously undermined revela tion. He never contended that reason furnished all the knowledge men needed to conduct their lives. As he observed in the Evi dences of the Christian Religion, his attempt to prove the truth of revelation presupposed the inadequacy of reason. "If revelation be not necessary, and reason alone be sufficient to lead man to his Creator, and to furnish him with all the principles, the motives, and aids of duty which are necessary in his present state, any examination into the truth of Christianity is manifestly superfluous." Smith then proceeded to show the necessity of revelation by the traditional argument that reason did not suffice as a moral governor of man. "A degenerate world, never can be reformed by the in fluence of reason alone. Its lights are too dubious and uncertain; its sanctions are too feeble." Yet, in spite of the force of this asser tion Smith steadily expanded the religious knowledge of man. As he demonstrated in book after book the harmony of reason and revelation, the conclusion that reason without revelation would lead to all the essential doctrines of Christianity became increasingly difficult to resist. Smith never made this inference from his writings. Nevertheless, his attempt to refute infidelity, or ration alism, by showing the unity of reason and revelation itself ended almost inevitably in rationalism.15 Smith's Evidences of the Christian Religion best illustrates this tendency in his thought. In writing the Evidences Smith relied heavily on the standard works in the literature of British apologetics. William Paley's A View of the Evidences of Christianity (1794), itself borrowed largely from earlier authors, provided most of the intellectual substance on which he drew. By imitating the British Smith built their rationalism into his book. As a result he found it difficult to avoid an anthropomorphic conception of God. Indeed from a strictly Calvinist point of view the whole proof from the external evidences always ran that danger. Its explicit assump tion—that God wanted to reveal Himself to man in prophecy and miracle in order to satisfy man's reason of the fact of His existence —depended for its validity on an implicit one—that God, if He existed, would behave in ways in which an eighteenth century Smith, An Essay, 149, and Lectures on Moral Philosophy (Trenton, N. J.), I, 9-27. is Smith, Evidences of Religion, 4, 9-10. 197</page><page sequence="10">Journal of Presbyterian History philosopher thought God likely to behave. In the Evidences Smith conceived God to act in the universe, not like the God of the Westminster Confession, but more like a transcendental school master, busy teaching man by offering evidences of His existence such that "every man of a sound mind who honestly applies his understanding to the subject, is capable to judge of." 16 Smith's rationalism also seemed to undermine the truth of Christian doctrine when not confirmed by reason. An example will suffice. Though Witherspoon had always insisted that "reason and observation" proved the truth of revelation he had carefully inter preted their conclusions in such fashion as not to contradict the Bible, even at the cost of intellectual consistency. Thus, with re spect to marriage he had argued that "reason and nature" pointed out that it should be monogamous, "be between one man and one woman. Polygamy is condemned by nature." Merely by paying heed to the evidence presented to him by his senses, man could perceive the truth of Christian doctrine about marriage. By con trast Smith reached precisely the opposite conclusion. He had no intention of condemning monogamy. The "positive institution" of Christ enjoined its practice upon all Christians. However, Smith was not prepared to admit that reason and nature equally forced monogamy upon men, for he argued polygamy was not inherently moral or immoral. The Old Testament indicated that the Biblical patriarchs had lived perfectly moral lives while practicing polygamy. The evidence the Bible presented to Smith's senses made him conclude that polygamy was consistent with sound morals. The laws and religion of a given society, not the dictates of nature, determined the morality, or lack of it, of polygamy or monogamy. Thus, Smith's rationalism removed the support that under Witherspoon "reason and observation" had given to Chris tian teaching about marriage. Such arguments, when combined with Smith's contention that reason proved the truth of the essen tial doctrines of Christianity, tended to the conclusion that belief in any part of Christian teaching not confirmed by reason was unimportant. Perhaps the doctrine itself was not true.17 Smith never drew such conclusions, but some Presbyterians feared that his rationalism would have such a result. When news of Smith's ideas about marriage reached William Hill, the Presby terian minister at Winchester, Virginia, he quickly reported to Ashbel Green at Philadelphia the rumor that Smith "undertakes to is Ibid., 34.

Hill warned Green that morality and religion are more endangered by such sentiments so taught and propagated, than by all the writings of Paine and his Deistical fraternity together." Hill lamented Smith s eftect on Princeton: How distressing to think that this fountain should send forth its impure and deleteri ous streams, polluting and intoxicating all our country." Green investigated the report by having his nephew, John Bradford, a tutor at the college, quietly obtain a copy of Smith's lectures and send them to Philadelphia. The copy, together with Brad ford's reply that "the gentleman of Virginia has not complained without some sufficient grounds," moved Green to attempt to induce Hill to prosecute Smith for heresy in the Church. No action in fact was taken against Smith, but the incident did serve to in crease suspicion of his orthdoxy. The underhandedness of the affair does little credit to Hill, Green, or Bradford. However, the basic perception that moved them, that Smith's rationalism might destroy the orthodoxy it was intended to defend, was well founded.18 In revealed religion Smith's explication of the ideas of Wither spoon created, as it had in natural religion, suspicion of his ortho doxy. The suspicion developed from Smith's attempt to reconcile common sense philosophy and Reformed orthodoxy more rigor ously than had Witherspoon. Whenever philosophical realism and religious doctrine had appeared to conflict, Witherspoon had usually responded either by ignoring possible contradictions or by effecting a reconciliation no matter what the cost in intellectual consistency. Smith's more sensitive mind did not permit him to pursue such a course. In particular Smith grasped the importance of reconciling common sense philosophy with the Calvinist belief that man possessed freedom of the will, yet was predestined to sin unless saved by God's grace. Smith first grappled with the problem while a missionary in Virginia in the 1770's. His philosophical position, defined in approximately 1777 to 1778 in two letters to James Madison, remained in broad outline the point of view defended until the end of his life. In discussing freedom of the will, or the liberty of the mind to choose among various courses of moral action, Smith insisted on the independence of the mind in the act of choosing. External causes did not necessarily determine human action. Thus, he held that motives, or the effects of external is Hill to Green, January 20, and May 12, 1804, General MSS (misc.), Prince ton University Library.

However, Smith distinguished two kinds of motives—one occasional, "those emotions and desires that arise only on the presence of their objects to the sense or fancy;" the other habitual, "because they constantly attend us." Habitual motives were always present to man's consciousness. And they usually, though not necessarily, determined the acts of man's will. "Liberty consists in such a proportion of external objects to the prijiciples of human nature, as always to raise some emotion or desire sufficient to be a motive of volition, but not to determine the will with absolute necessity. The mind is always determined in its volition by motive." 19 The significance of Smith's resolution of the problem of free will is most easily grasped when compared to that of Thomas Reid, the founder of the Scottish common sense school of philosophy. Reid published his position in 1788 in his Essays on the Active Powers of Man. He insisted that the act of the will in choosing among moral actions was merely the effect in a cause and effect relationship. To strengthen the argument that the cause of moral action was "the person himself," Reid further contended that motives did not determine human actions. Instead the cause of moral actions lay in man's reason and the active power of his mind. Man could thus be held responsible by God for obedience to moral laws only so far as he possessed the capacity to obey them. Reid denied that original sin could possibly make man morally guilty in the eyes of God: "There can be no moral obligation to what is impossible, . . . there can be no crime in yielding to necessity, and . . . there can be no justice in punishing a person for what it was not in his power to avoid." The dangers to Reformed orthodoxy from Reid were clear. He denied man's guilt by original sin and by the power he gave the will to determine freely its own acts advocated Armin ianism. Man was not predestined to eternal damnation unless saved by an irresistible act of God's grace.20 When Smith published his ideas on freedom of the will in his Lectures on Moral and Political Philosophy and A Comprehensive View of Natural and Revealed Religion, he seemingly brought his ideas into harmony with those of Reid. Yet, the similarity is misleading. Smith permitted motives a far greater role in determin ing human actions than Reid.

By so doing he did not have to leny original sin or ¡predestination. He argued that motives lid not necessarily determine the moral choices of the will. But in fact God foreknew that motives would affect man in given ways. By the . . . Creator ... all the thoughts and purposes oí mankind, til the circumstances and motives which can in any way influence iheir actions, were, from eternity most distinctly known. Yet his foreknowledge does, in no way, necessitate the events connected with it, although it proves his preordination; that is, their certain existence, according to, and resulting from the order of nature, whether physical or moral, established by him. Man would »in with certainty, though not necessity. Man's salvation depended upon the free gift of God's grace.-1 Smith's reconciliation of common sense philosophy and Calvin ism proved too subtle for many in the Church to grasp. By inter preting Reid so that his ideas became compatible with Calvinist doctrine, Smith became a well-known advocate of Reid's philosophy and, thus, in the eyes of many tarred with Reid's Arminianism. The student, William Weeks, complained from Princeton in 1808, "the favorite work here is Reid's Essays, which is strongly recom mended by Dr. Smith, our President. . . . Reid is grossly Arminian, and advocates a Self-determining power, which, if it means any thing, means that the creature is independent of the Creator." This criticism of Smith, though overlooking his ditterence trom Reid, did have some justification. To escape from Arminianism, Smith had to equate predestination with God s foreknowledge. Thus, the moral world operated in something like the clockwork fashion of the Newtonian physical world. The operation of the moral universe was not necessarily predetermined, but in fact God foreknew the results of its workings. Lost in Smith's formula tion was an omnipotent God, ever present, ever active in the universe. In some ways God had been relegated to being the clock maker of the moral, as well as the physical, world.2 The theological consequences of Smith's reconciliation ot com mon sense philosophy with Calvinism can be specifically illustrated. By removing God from immediate intervention in the universe. Smith made man by his own exertions more responsible tor his own salvation.

The Discourse aroused criticism for its apparent Arminianism. In a curious episode in 1808 Ashbel Green, then edi tor of the General Assembly's Missionary Magazine; or Evangelical Intelligencer, published a letter from Smith in which he defended himself. The letter is valuable, for it pinpoints the precise grounds on which Smith had been criticized. Some in the Church—the letter did not state who—had attacked Smith's assertion that the "faith which unites us to Christ, arid is the principle of a holy life, is the ground of our justification, and our title to eternal life." The basis of the attack was that Smith's views were contrary to the Westminster Confession, that he made human faith, not God's grace, responsible for salvation. Smith protested in his letter that he nowhere implied that "faith contains, in its own nature, any meritorious title to salvation." He defended his orthodoxy with vigor and possibly justice. However, his rationalism, his reconcilia tion of Calvinism and common sense philosophy, had made him strain the bounds of orthodoxy in the direction of Arminianism.23 The dilemma of Smith's life was ironical. The price of his essential devotion to the philosophical and theological tradition instilled by Witherspoon was condemnation for deviation from it. Witherspoon's joining of reason and revelation simply would not sustain the intellectual burden he had supposed. As Smith worked out the implications of Witherspoon's views, he found himself end ing in unorthodoxy. The moral of Smith's life for the Church in the nineteenth century was clear. It could accept revelation as expressed in the scholastic terms of the Westminster Confession, or it could accept the conclusions of reason. But it could not easily do both, at least not within the confines of common sense realism. The rejection of Smith prefigured the choice that orthodox Presbyterians made between the two alternatives. Under the tutelage of the Princeton Theology the mind of nineteenth century orthodoxy became closed to theological innovation as it proceeded to isolate itself from some of the most significant intellectual cur rents of Western civilization.24 23 Smith to an unidentified correspondent (probably Ashbel Green) in the General Assembly's Magazine, new ser., II (1808), 104. 24 The literature on the philosophical heritage of Witherspoon and, more generally, the Princeton Theology is quite large.
