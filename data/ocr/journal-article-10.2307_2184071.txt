<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHILOSOPHY' THE Encyclopedia of Philosophy is described by its editor-in-chief, Professor Paul Edwards, as intended to fill the need for "a truly encyclopedic presentation of philosophical theories and concepts" in the light of "the revolutionary developments in philosophy and related fields" since the publication in i90i of its only major predecessor in English, J. M. Baldwin's Dictionary of Psychology and Philosophy (I, ix) .2 The Encyclopedia is well produced. It is printed in legible type, on thick opaque paper. Lines are well spaced, and columns well divided. Other encyclopedias consulted in preparing this article-for example, the Britannica-were in these respects much inferior. Since I cannot tell what its costs of production were or ought to have been, its high price ($219.50) may, for all I know, be just. The editors wisely chose not to add to it by furnishing illustrations. Technically, the editorial staff has done least well in constructing the Index (VIII, 387-544). While extremely useful, entries are not always comprehensive, and sometimes injuriously not. For example, in the entry "Truth," the list of philosophers whose views on truth are discussed in Volume II contains the names of Aristotle, Plato, Cudworth, Collingwood, and Moore, but omits those of Duhem (424b) and Carnap (3ob-3Ia, where, it is true, the word "truth" occurs only once). Although the proofs have, in general, been well corrected, I noticed too many errata, besides the ten recorded (VIII, 385), for it to have been profitable to make a list of them: most are easily corrigible by the run of readers. The useful bibliographies with which the major articles are furnished seem not to have been drawn up on common principles; nor is their style uniform, either in composition or printing. With few exceptions, Edwards has been judicious both in choosing subjects for articles and in determining their length. In order to 1 Encyclopedia of Philosophy (New York, The Macmillan Company, and London, Collier-Macmillan Ltd., i967, 8 vols.) 2 All references to the Encyclopedia will be incorporated in the text. Each will consist of a volume number (an upper-case Roman numeral), a page number or numbers (in lower-case Roman or Arabic numerals, as required), and, where appropriate, column letters ("a" for the left-hand column, "b" for the right). 83</page><page sequence="2">ALAN DONAGAN avoid polemical bias, he has followed the policy of assigning topics to "authorswho were to some considerable extent sympathetic to the theo- ry or the figure they were to discuss," provided only that they were not markedly inferior to other available writers in "such qualifications as intellectual incisiveness and capacity for clear statement" (I, xi). As a result, the Encyclopedia is both lucid and fair. Yet Edwards does not disclaim all bias. He avows and defends his policy of selecting topics according to his own philosophical judgment, as one "raised in the empirical and analytic tradition of Anglo-Saxon philosophy"; and he candidly acknowledges that "if the Encyclopedia had been edited by a follower of Hegel or by a phenomenologist, assuming him to have made every effort to be fair and equitable to other viewpoints, it would have looked very different" (I, xi). Here Edwards is certainly right. An encyclopedia of philosophy, edited with the fairness and competence of this one, but from the point of view of a phenomenol- ogist, a Thomist, or a Hegelian, would be of great value; but one edited from no point of view at all would not. Some of Edwards' decisions as editor-in-chief are questionable, however. He wins our applause by not demanding that his contributors be "serious and solemn at all costs" (I, x); but might he not have hinted to one or two of them that the jokes with which they regale us are sometimes too long (e.g., "NOTHING," V, 524a-525b) ? Whether or not to include a biographical article is often a difficult question, on which it is impossible to please everybody. Most of Edwards' decisions are conservative and unobjectionable; and the few that are bold are mostly right: for example, to include a substantial article on the Scotch-Australian philosopher John Anderson (by J. A. Passmore, I, I I 9b- I 2 I b). But some of his omissions are hard to excuse. There is no biographical article on H. H. Price. Here, his own contributors have delicately reproved him by discussing Price's work in no fewer than nine "topic" articles. It is more intelligible that H. A. Prichard and William Kneale have no biographical articles, though not much. That Gustav Bergmann's work is usually not discussed where it might be expected to be must charitably be put down to accident. The omission of his name from the Index is an oversight. His publications are mentioned in more than one bibliog- raphy, and C. E. Caton considers his views in "ARTIFICIAL AND NATURAL LANGUAGES" (I, I68b-I7Ia, esp. I69a-b). Of Edwards' questionable inclusions most are defensible. Articles on such philosophers as Orestes Augustus Brownson (I803-1876), Cadwallader Colden (i688-I776), Laurens Perseus Hickok (1798- 84</page><page sequence="3">ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHILOSOPHY i888), and Evander Bradley McGilvarey (i864-1953) are presumably designed to supply a demand from students in courses in American philosophy. Some of the articles on lesser philosophers who wrote in German honor worthies of European free-thinking, whose direct influence was to be obliterated by nationalist barbarism. Edwards' own article on Josef Popper-Lynkeus (I838-i92i), almost twice as long as Anthony Quinton's article on Karl Popper (i902- ), is the most splendid of these pious monuments. The articles on Wilhelm Reich (VII, 104a-I 5a) and on Bertrand Russell's life and social theories (VII, 236a-239a), both by Edwards, place on accessible record brief histories of two squalid episodes of American anti- intellectualism. One must be glad of this: that intellectuals have long memories, and are known to have them, may not secure their liberties, but it will help. To turn to the topics discussed in the Encyclopedia is embarrassing. On virtually all of them I am conscious of having learned from it. Not merely was I made acquainted with arguments and points of view of which I had been ignorant or poorly informed, but, perhaps even more important, I was forced to consider in their bearing on one another matters I had before considered only in isolation. Half the value of this Encyclopedia will be lost if it is used solely as a work of reference. Few philosophers will not profit from reading groups of related articles and pondering the different approaches of the several authors. The period in which most of the articles were presumably written, i96i-I966, was one to which a saying of F. H. Bradley applies: philosophy then was not what it had been, and it could not have remained what it was. Rapid advances had been made in the first forty years of the century, which were consolidated in the decade after the Second World War; but they brought new problems with them, and by i960 the orthodoxy of 1945-1955 was in doubt. The historical articles in the Encyclopedia show that a period of confusion, however pregnant, is unpropitious for definitive appraisals of the past. It is true that historical scholarship has advanced. We know more than ever before what philosophers of the past said and thought. Since we now know too much to take any interpretation of Plato's dialogues as established, the Encyclopedia boldly presents Ryle's radical reinterpretation ("PLATO," VI, 314a-333b). And since we now know enough to arrive at a historically respectable analysis of the work of Duns Scotus, the Encyclopedia offers Wolter's scholarly and original study ("DUNS SCOTUS, J.," II, 427a-436b). Yet contemporary historians 85</page><page sequence="4">ALAN DONAGAN have not arrived at any comprehensive interpretation of the work and influence even of the major philosophers; nor can they do so until solutions of our present philosophical problems are found. I have therefore devoted most of this article to what the Encyclopedia has to say about the present state of philosophical thought in its two central fields, metaphysics and epistemology, which I consider inseparable. The editors of this Review agreed that I should not write about the articles on logic and the foundations of mathematics except incidentally. Since even a logician as indifferent as I can tell that they are excep- tionally strong, it is fortunate that we can look to the Journal of Symbolic Logic for a thorough examination of them. Because of its traditional connection with metaphysics, it was necessary to say something about philosophical theology, and that led to my concluding remarks on religion. I had intended also to discuss ethics, but could not contrive to do so, even within the very generous space allotted to me. I. THE LEGACY OF LOGICAL POSITIVISM Philosophy as it is at present is unintelligible without some reference to its recent past; and in the recent past, the most convenient point of departure for a study such as this is Logical Positivism (or Logical Empiricism). Both the articles, "AMERICAN PHILOSOPHY" by Paul Kurtz (esp. I, gob-gia) and "BRITISH PHILOSOPHY" by Anthony Quinton (esp. I, 394a), attest that the work of the Vienna Circle and its associates (for example, Karl Popper), especially after the migration of most of its members to the United States or Britain, was a turning point. In 1939, a reader of this Review, or of Mind, might well have concluded that Logical Positivism had been "contained" by traditional versions of realism and pragmatism, and even that idealism had survived its onslaught. By 195o, nobody could cling to that illusion. Yet by then, as J. A. Passmore points out in "LOGICAL POSITIVISM" (V, 52a-57a), Logical Positivism itself was dead: what remained was a legacy which it was often hard to distinguish from that of Russellian logical atomism, Moorean "analysis," and Polish semantics (V, 56b). But Logical Positivism was the crucible in which these traditions were fused. Passmore and R. W. Ashby ("VERIFIABILITY PRINCIPLE," VIII, 240a-247a) agree that the most distinctive doctrine of Logical Positivism was that "for any sentence to be cognitively meaningful 86</page><page sequence="5">ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHILOSOPHY it must express a statement that is either analytic or empirically verifiable" (Ashby, VIII, 240a; cf. V, 54b). The Verifiability Principle, which, according to Ashby, was first formulated in 1930 by Friedrich Waismann (VIII, 240b), is that cognitively meaningful sentences expressing nonanalytic statements must be empirically verifiable. It provides a criterion for determining whether certain sentences are cognitively meaningful, but it plainly does not pretend to provide a way of determining what their meanings are (Ashby, VIII, 24ib). Some questions admit as answers only sentences that fail to satisfy the Verifiability Principle. The Logical Positivists followed Rudolf Carnap in dismissing such questions as "pseudo-problems" and in holding that the problems of traditional metaphysics, ethics, and epistemology are pseudo-problems (Norman M. Martin, "CARNAP, R.," II, 25b-33b, esp. 27b-28a; Passmore, V, 53a-54a). Carnap ascribed the Verifiability Principle to Wittgenstein (Martin, II, 27b), but its place in Wittgenstein's thought is unclear. In "WITTGENSTEIN, L. J. J." (VIII, 327a-340b), Norman Malcolm shows that it is neither implied nor presupposed in Wittgenstein's Tractatus (VIII, 333b-334a). Wittgenstein held that "to understand a proposition means to know what is the case if it is true" (Tractatus, 4.024, qu. Malcolm VIII, 333b); but this, far from implying the Verifiability Principle, is connected with Wittgenstein's Fregean doctrine that "a proposition is an expression of its truth-conditions" (Tractatus, 4.431), which he dissociated from Frege's notion that the True and the False are objects. Members of the Vienna Circle did discuss philosophy with Wittgenstein before Wittgenstein's return to Cambridge in i929; but, if Wittgenstein advanced the Verifiability Principle then, Malcolm gives no evidence of it (VIII, 328b-329a). Malcolm holds that in Philosophical Investigations (Oxford, 1953), which was composed years after Wittgenstein's direct influence on the Logical Positivists had ceased, Wittgenstein espoused the theory that "an expression has a meaning only if there is a regular, a uniform, connection between saying the expression and certain circumstances" (VIII, 33ga-b). This implies something like the Verifiability Principle, and is even less plausible. The question is thoroughly explored in "PRIVATE LANGUAGE PROBLEM" (VI, 458b-464a), by H.-N. Castafteda. The Verifiability Principle was no sooner advanced than critics pointed out that, if cognitively meaningful, it is self-refuting. Hence Logical Positivists were early agreed that it was to be interpreted as a recommendation, and, therefore, as non-cognitive (Passmore, V, 87</page><page sequence="6">ALAN DONAGAN 54b; Ashby, VIII, 244b). The objection considered fatal by the Logical Positivists themselves was that the Principle, which had been invoked to rid philosophy of traditional metaphysics and theology, "threatened to destroy not only metaphysics, but also science" (Passmore, V, 55a). As Karl Popper observed, no scientific law is strictly verifiable; but it will not help to change the Verifiability Principle into a Falsifiability Principle, because no existential proposi- sition is strictly falsifiable (Ashby, VIII, 24ib-242a). Carnap, Hempel, and others proposed that verifiability be replaced by confirmability; but, in explicating the concept of confirmability, they made use of the concept of a formalized empiricist language, which even now awaits elucidation (Ashby, VIII, 243a-b). Passmore noncommittally decides that it remains controversial whether the "confirmability principle" can be so restated as to condemn traditional metaphysics without condemning science (V, 55a-b). Ashby aspires to salvage something more from the wreck. The Logical Positivists, he holds, correctly divined that there is "a close connection between the notion of cognitive ... meaning and the notion of truth" (VIII, 245b). Any sentence that expresses a true or false descriptive statement must contain predicates for which semantic rules can be given relating them to certain possible states of affairs (VIII, 246a). Now, asks Ashby, "how can these rules be explained to anyone else if the states of affairs which the sentences are supposed to describe are not experienceable in any way at all" (VIII, 246a) ? One petitio principii deserves another. In reply, it suffices to ask: why does Ashby imagine that the only states of affairs to which a predicate can be related by intelligible semantic rules must be experienceable? But more can be said. With no syntactical or semantical resources except those of elementary sentential and predicate logic, Popper has explicated a sentence equivalent to: (M) There exists an omnipresent, omnipotent and omniscient personal spirit, in terms of four primitive physicalistic predicates;3 (I) "occupies a position of which ... is a part," (2) "can put the thing ... into position," (3) "makes the utterance," and (4) "is asked whether or not." Ashby presumably denies neither that intelligible semantic rules can be given for (i), (2), (3), and (4), nor that the state of affairs specified in (M) is unexperienceable by any human being. 3 The Philosophy of Rudolf Carnap, ed. by P. A. Schilpp (LaSalle and London, i963), pp. 207-209. 88</page><page sequence="7">ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHILOSOPHT In his "Replies and Expositions," Carnap acknowledged (M), as interpreted by Popper, to be "clearly empirical."4 Yet Popper's interpretation of (M) resembles much philosophical theology-for example, Aquinas' investigation of the divine attributes by the via remotionis.5 Not knowing this, Carnap denied that (M), as interpreted by Popper, belongs to "metaphysical theology," and wrongly likened it to statements of astrological or magical belief (which are straight- forwardly falsifiable, as [M] is not) and to religious myths (which are not put forward as literally true).6 Hence he did not perceive that a Verifiability Principle liberal enough to accommodate unverified but unfalsifiable existential statements in the natural sciences will not eliminate metaphysical theology. Carnap, here followed by Ashby, did not grasp the radical idea in Popper's treatment. Although he proposed a falsifiability criterion to distinguish natural science from metaphysics, Popper, having no desire to eliminate metaphysics, strenuously denied that his criterion could be used as a criterion of meaning. If Popper's falsifiability criterion correctly demarcates the boundary of natural science, which is doubtful, it does so by specifying how propositions in natural science are established. Nothing follows from it about metaphysical propositions except the uncontroversial conclusion that, if they are not established as propositions in natural science are, then they do not belong to natural science. II. THE A PRIORI AND THE ANALYTIC The Logical Positivists accepted the Kantian distinction between a posteriori truths, knowledge of which is derived from experience, and a priori truths, of which this is not so. The Kantian distinction itself was developed from a more complex one drawn by Leibniz. (Cf. D. W. Hamlyn, "A PRIORI AND A POSTERIORI, " I, 140a-144b, esp. 14oa; L. J. Russell, "LEIBNIZ, G. W.," IV, 422a-434a, esp. 426b-427a; W. H. Walsh, "KANT, I.," IV, 305a-324a, esp. 3ogb-3ioa.) Hamlyn inclines to the common opinion that if a proposition is known a priori, it must be necessarily true, although he points out that, since not all non-empirical propositions are known, it does not follow ,I bid., p. 8i i. O of course, Popper's imaginary theology is not identical with Aquinas' serious one. 6 The Philosophy of Rudolf Carnap, p. 8 i i. 89</page><page sequence="8">ALAN DONAGAN from this that no non-empirical propositions are contingent (I, 142a- 143a). Kant maintained that the propositions of metaphysics are not only a priori, but also synthetic. What he meant by "synthetic," which he understood as the contradictory of "analytic," he did not make completely clear.7 He distinguished analytic judgments from synthetic as being uninformative, and as serving merely to elucidate the concept under which the subject falls (D. W. Hamlyn, "ANALYTIC AND SYNTHETIC STATEMENTS," I, io5a-ioga, esp. io5b). In addition to this, Kant offered two criteria of analyticity: (I) "an analytic judgment is one in which the concept of the predicate is contained (although covertly) in the concept of the subject"; and (2) "analytic judgments are such that their denial involves a contradiction" (Hamlyn, I, Io0b). Hamlyn holds that (2) is at most a criterion and not a definition; and he points out that (I), while formally suitable as a definition, holds only forjudgments expressible in subject-predicate form (I, io6a). He then suggests that the following extension of (2) might embody Kant's point of view: a judgment is analytic if and only if "only the meaning of the terms involved, the nature ofthe correspondingconcepts, make [it] true" (I, Io6a).But how can the meaning of the terms involved make ajudgment true? Not because analytic judgments are definitions; for definitions are "about words not things" (Hamlyn, I, io6a). Nor because they "make clear our determination to use words in a certain way," as A. J. Ayer once maintained; for analytic judgments are not prescriptive. The only plausible answer is along lines originally set forth by Frege, who "defined an analytic proposition as one in the proof of which one comes to general logical laws and definitions only" (Hamlyn, I, i43a; cf. I, io6b). A proposition is made true by the meaning of the terms involved if, as Waismann proposed, it can be reduced, by the substitution of definitional equivalents, to a logical truth (Hamlyn, I, io6b).8 7Besides the difficulties in Kant's explicit formulations (see Walsh, IV, 309a), it has been persuasively argued that, since Kant's use of "analytic" and "synthetic" does not correspond to his formulations, hidden criteria must be sought (Moltke S. Gram, Kant, Ontology and the A Priori [Evanston, I968], esp. pp. 70-74). 8 This does not presuppose Hamlyn's odd view that "all that can follow from a definition is another definition" (I, io6b). From the definition of a brother as a male sibling, it follows that all brothers have siblings: the fact that logical truths are found in the proof is neither here nor there. There is no trace of Hamlyn's view in the article "DEFINITIoN," by Raziel Abelson, II, 314a-324a. 9o</page><page sequence="9">ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHILOSOPHY The concept of analyticity is fundamental to Logical Positivism. It is implicit in the Verifiability Principle, which underlies the Logical Positivist rejection of metaphysics. According to the Verifiability Principle, sentences which apparently express synthetic a priori propositions lack cognitive meaning; hence, if Kant's conception of metaphysical judgments as synthetic a priori was correct, then metaphysics consists of pseudo-propositions. The Encyclopedia itself for the most part countenances the concept of analyticity. It is accepted by Hamlyn, in the articles cited above; and it is canonized in "LOGICAL TERMS, GLOSSARY OF" (by Boruch A. Brody, V, 57a-77b), where it is laid down that all propositions whose denial is self-contradictory are true, "either by virtue of [their] logical form alone (in which case [they are] called logical truths] ... ) or by virtue of both [their] logical form and the meaning of [their] constituent terms" (V, 58a). Yet W. V. Quine has denounced it in what is probably the most influential philosophical paper written since the Second World War: "Two Dogmas of Empiricism."9 Quine's repudiation of analyticity is a natural growth from the formalization of logic in the 1930's, which Logical Positivism had fostered. By rigorously distinguishing syntactics from semantics, modern formalized logic "identif[ies] the intuitive conception of logical truth with the precise concept of a valid sentence" (Albert E. Blumberg, "LOGIC, MODERN," V, I2b-34b, esp. 30a). Its calculi have to do with sentences and predicates, rather than with propositions and properties; and their validity is established by means of semantical interpretations of those sentences and predicates (Blumberg, V, 26a-27a, 2ga-30a). Such a logic has no place for the notion of sentences made true "only [by] the meaning of the terms involved" (cf. Hamlyn, I, io6a), unless "meaning," like "logical truth," can be identified with something logically respectable. To Frege's proposal, as revised by Waismann, that analyticity be identified with reducibility to logical truth by the substitution of definitional equivalents, Quine objects that, except where, as in formal logic, it is merely abbreviatory, definition, along with Carnap's device of meaning postulates, "rests on synonymy rather than 9 W.

A Logical Positivist who was persuaded by Quine's objections to analyticity might reclassify cognitively meaningful sentences into (a) those that are logically true or false, and (b) those that are empirically verifiable. Quine is more radical. He adopts the Duhemian thesis (cf. Peter Alexander, "DUHEM, P. M. M.," II, 423a-425b) that, since the totality of a man's beliefs at a given time are a "fabric which impinges on experience only along the edges,"'12 a falsifying observation "shows conclusively that something is wrong, but it tells us neither where to look for that something nor what we must reject or modify" (Alexander, II, 424b-425a); and he goes beyond Duhem in including a man's logical beliefs in the modifiable fabric. "Revision . . . of the logical law of the excluded middle," he observes, "has been proposed as a means of simplifying quantum mechanics"; and he finds no difference in principle between such a modification and that whereby Kepler superseded Ptolemy.13 How Quine conceives an amendment in the law of the excluded middle, or any other logical truth, is far from clear. Heyting has constructed a sentential calculus from the axioms of which neither "p V Up" nor --.-p p" is derivable.14 But Heyting's calculus is not an "amendment" of the classical one, since its semantics is different. In an eloquent exposition of Quine's philosophy, Professor Gilbert Harman has offered the following elucidation. 10 Quine, From a Logical Point of View, 26, 32-37. Cf. Ashby, IV, 480b- 48Ia. 11 Linsky rightly argues that this does not show the concept of synonymity to be illegitimate; it is more likely that philosophers who have discussed it have supposed it to be governed by criteria that do not in fact apply (VIII, 57a). But Quine's argument against synonymity, unlike, e.g., Goodman's (cf. VIII, 56a-b), makes no assumptions about its criteria. 12 Quine, From a Logical Point of View, p. 42. 13 Ibid., p. 43. 14 Mentioned by Charles Parsons in "MATHEMATICS, FOUNDATIONS OF," V, i89b. Parsons discusses mathematical intuitionism further at V, 204a-205b, and in "BROUWER, L. E. J.," I, 399b-40Ib. He has not been allocated enough space for the thorough exposition that the subject deserves. Intuitionist logic (as distinct from intuitionist philosophy of mathematics) might well have had an article to itself. I turned for help to William and Martha Kneale, The Development of Logic (Oxford, i962), esp. pp. 672-681. 92</page><page sequence="11">ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHILOSOPHr [O]ne can refuse to accept our [logical] principles and instead adopt principles that cannot be translated into ours; and we can conceive of his principles being correct. Perhaps the law of excluded middle (for all P: P or not-P) fails to hold, even though it is not false. A person who accepts a logic without this law may mean something different by "not" from what we mean; but his language may contain no principle we can identify with our law. According to such a person, our law of the excluded middle fails to have a truth-value; he rejects our notion of "not."1-5 This, too, is unclear. What does such a person mean by "having a truth-value"? And what is it for us to conceive his principles as being correct, if it is not conceiving each of them as true, and the denial of any of them as false? Even if logical truths are exempt from the ravages of the Duhemian thesis, as Quine sometimes appears to say,16 repudiating all analytic statements arrived at by substituting synonyms for synonyms drastically alters the Logical Positivists' map of knowledge. Not surprisingly, the decade following the publication of "Two Dogmas of Empiricism" was thick with rebuttals. From Quine's point of view, most of them begged the question. As he sees the matter, meanings are theoretical entities postulated in order to explain facts about human linguistic behavior. If human linguistic behavior is intelligible without postulating them, then they should not be postulated. Most rebuttals of his view, however, take meanings to be entities of which we are immediately aware. This Quine is entitled to dismiss out of hand. P. F. Strawson has laid down the most promising strategy for Quine's critics. It is to try to show "that Quine's account of logical truth cannot be made to yield the results he . . . desires, unless it is taken to make implicit use of certain notions which elsewhere he attacks, declaring them to be superfluous and to embody mythical distinctions.""7 The most impressive application of this strategy to date is by Strawson himself; and C. F. Presley (VII, 53b) implicitly grants its succe-ss. 15 Review of Metaphysics, XXI (1967-i968), 133. Harman cites Quine, The Ways ofParadox (NewYork,i966),p. 102, for comparison. Since Quine seems to me to be saying something quite different here, I probably misunderstand him. 16 W. V. 0. Quine, Word and Object (Cambridge Mass., 1960), pp. 57-61.

Nobody who takes sentences as what is true or false can admit that whether somebody uttering this sentence says something true depends on the meanings of "married" on the two occasions when he uttered it. Suppose, as they imaginably might, that the first "married" means "being in the state of matrimony," and that the second means "being thoroughly devoted to something," as in the phrase "married to his work." The utterance would then have the sense that matrimony is a necessary condition of thorough devotion to anything, which is almost certainly false. It would seem to follow that the sentence "No unmarried man is married" is neither true nor false, and that whether the statements made by uttering it are true or false depends on the meaning of "married." Quine has not to my knowledge replied to Strawson.I8 Harman, however, offers this. According to [Quine] a person associates varying paraphrases with ambiguous sentences (Word and Object, 129, 191-195) .... The varying paraphrases represent what the speaker takes to be equivalent to the ambiguous sentence given a particular context. The notion of equivalence here is not that of "meaning equivalence" but rather the notion of an equivalence taken to follow fairly obviously from what the relevant group of people (possibly only the speaker or hearer) accepts.19 My initial difficulty is with the second sentence I have quoted. What paraphrases are equivalent to a given sentence is determined by the "particular context." Is that context itself sentential? If so, Harman's position would be that (i) (No un-F is F)- P where P is a proposed paraphrase, is true if and only if "No un-F is F" is uttered in a particular sentential context "K," such that (2) K-+ [(No un-F is F) &lt;-+P]. But that is plainly false. On the other hand, if the particular context that determines equivalent paraphrases is not sentential, what is it? If it is supposed to be a physical context such that in it the relevant group of people is disposed merely to assent to the sentence (I), then Harman has no right to say that the relevant group takes the "8 See Quine, Word and Object, p. 65, n. 3. 19 Harman, loc. cit. pp. I50-I5I. 94</page><page sequence="13">ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHILOSOPHr equivalence "to follow fairly obviously from what [it] accepts." What could give him that right? Well, the equivalence would follow fairly obviously if, on that occasion, "No un-F is F" had, for whatever reason, been taken to have the same meaning as "P." Harman cannot, on his view, accept this answer; but, until he offers another, suspicion must linger that he makes implicit use of it. Although Richard M. Gale's valuable "PROPOSITIONS, JUDGMENTS, SENTENCES, AND STATEMENTS" (VI, 494b-505a) does little to answer the questions Quine has raised, it throws light on why many philosophers hesitate to accept the existence of propositions. Gale recognizes two kinds of sense that the word "proposition" may have: "ordinary nonphilosophical senses," in which "there are obviously propositions," and a philosophical sense, in which "proposition" stands for an independent abstract entity that is both the intentional object of a mental act (the act of judgment) and the meaning of the sentence formulating this act (VI, 494b-495a). Gale argues forcibly that, in the philosophical sense, there are no propositions. Strawson would join Quine in applauding this conclusion. But Gale does not mention that there is room for philosophical disagreement about the non- philosophical senses of "proposition." Some of those senses Quine can accept as having paraphrases sanctioned by his theory. Some he cannot. The non-Quinean sense in which Strawson and others hold that there are propositions can be illustrated as follows. Take the two compound sentences, each consisting of a pair of sentences connected by "if ... then . . .": (I) If I weigh more than i 8o pounds, then I outweigh you. and (2) If you weigh more than i8o pounds, then you outweigh me. Imagine that (I) is addressed by a man, A, to another man, B; and that (2) is addressed by B to A, prefaced by the words "I agree." Then, out of these conjoined pairs of sentences, take the first sentence in each pair: (I a) I weigh more than i8o pounds. and (2a) You weigh more than i8o pounds. 95</page><page sequence="14">ALAN DONAGAN About these four sentences, the following seem to be true: (i) The meaning of (i) is not the same as the meaning of (2); and the meaning of (i a) is not the same as the meaning of (2a). (ii) Although A in uttering (i) makes the same statement (expresses the same judgment) as B in uttering (2), A makes no statement in uttering (ia), nor B in uttering (2a). (iii) A in uttering (i a) and B in uttering (2a) propound or put forward, without assenting to it, either one and the same truth, or one and the same falsehood: this truth or falsehood is conveniently and traditionally called a "proposition." (iv) In making the statement they make when they respectively utter (i) and (2), A and B propound the same compound proposition, and in addition indicate their assent to it.20 The propositions (iii) and (iv) imply the existence of propositions in a nonphilosophical sense that Quine disallows; for it involves synonymity. But the existence of propositions in this sense does not imply the existence of propositions in the philosophical sense attacked by Gale; for it does not imply that propositions exist independently of what anybody says or thinks. The existence of propositions, in the sense described, does not imperil the formalization of logic. Propositions must be distinguished from sentences, because sentences may be ambiguous both in reference and in sense. In a properly formalized calculus, however, since both kinds of ambiguity are excluded, different propositions cannot be propounded by different utterances of the same sentence. Hence, in such a calculus, no ill consequence follows from neglecting the distinction between sentence and proposition. Nor does the existence of analytic truths in the Frege-Waismann sense imply that Quine's attack on the analytic-synthetic distinction has wholly miscarried. As Hilary Putnam has argued, even though Quine was wrong in his "literal thesis" that the analytic-synthetic distinction does not exist at all, he was "overwhelmingly right in his 20 I have drawn here upon Strawson, loc. cit., esp. pp. i6, 19-23; Richard Cartwright, "Propositions," in R.

The Logical Positivists and their successors, including Strawson himself at one time,22 darkened counsel by classifying as analytic everything they were inclined to accept a priori. Except for logical truths and analytic trivia, no propositions in a theoretical system are unconditionally immune to evidence that compels a revision in the system, although some are more immune than others. Hence, in the propositions of such a system, it will often be impossible to separate what reflects the meaning of a word, and what reflects "deeply embedded collateral informa- tion."23 This is now recognized by many historians of science: witness the widespread reluctance to classify the laws of motion in Newtonian physics as either a priori or a posteriori (see Dudley Shapere, "NEWTONIAN MECHANICS AND MECHANICAL EXPLANATION," V, 49ib- 496b, esp. 493b-494b; and N. R. Hanson, Patterns of Discovery [Cambridge, 1958], pp. 99-112). III. REALISM AND THE CONCEPT OF TRUTH That the concept of truth is philosophically fundamental became more and more evident to the Logical Positivists, especially Carnap, and to their successors. Of a number of good articles on the subject in the Encyclopedia, two stand out: A. N. Prior's "CORRESPONDENCE THEORY OF TRUTH" (II, 223b-232a) and Donald Kalish's "SEMANTICS" (VII, 348b-358b). In Theaetetus and Sophist Plato examined the theory (called by Prior the "Existence Theory") that a true belief is directed toward what is, considered in Parmenidean style as an existent object, and a false belief toward its opposite, what is not. Arguing that to believe what is not is to believe nothing, which is indistinguishable from not believing at all (cf. Ryle, VI, 328b-329a), Plato rejected the Existence Theory in favor of a Correspondence Theory, according to which a belief is a complex which, if true, corresponds to a complex; although it is directed not toward the corresponding complex, but to the simples 21 In Herbert Feigl and Grover Maxwell (eds.), Minnesota Studies in the Philosophy of Science (Minneapolis, I962), III, 368. 22 Cf. P. F. Strawson, Introduction to Logical Theory (London, I952), pp. 2-15, with W. V. 0.

If the belief is false, it is directed toward the same simples, but those simples do not enter into a corresponding complex. Thus the belief that Socrates is sitting is directed toward Socrates and sitting, neither of which fails to be a proper object of thought if the belief is false-that is, if there is no corresponding complex, Socrates is sitting (II, 224b). In the present century, G. E. Moore completed Plato's (and Aristotle's) theory. Agreeing with them that in order to define truth all we need to know are such facts as that The belief that Socrates is sitting is true if and only if Socrates is sitting, Moore nevertheless observed that truth is not defined by stating these facts. In asserting that a belief is true, "we mean to assert that [it] has some property, which it shares with other true beliefs," whereas in asserting that Socrates is sitting, we are not attributing any property at all to the belief that he is sitting (II, 226b; quoting Some Main Problems of Philosophy, p. 276). The facts remarked by Plato and Aristotle show there to be a familiar though apparently unanalyzable relation between the true belief that Socrates is sitting and the fact that he is sitting. This relation may be called "correspondence." Truth may be contextually defined in terms of it as follows: "to say that [a] belief is true is to say that there is in the Universe a fact to which it corresponds, and to say that it is false is to say that there is not in the Universe any fact to which it corresponds" (II, 226b, quoting Moore, op. cit., p. 277). Moore's Correspondence Theory has been defended as obvious, and assailed as fabricating a nonexistent relation. F. P. Ramsey, for example, argued that if, as Moore held, "It is true that, as Xbelieves" means no more than "X believes that p, and p," then the clause "it is true (that)" should be construed adverbially, and attaching it to a sentence says no more than the sentence says on its own (II, 229a). Ramsey's view, sometimes described as a "no-truth" theory, has been developed by P. F. Strawson, drawing upon J. L. Austin's theory of speech acts (see J. 0. Urmson, "AuSTIN, J. L.," I, 21 I a-2 I5a, esp. 21 2b-2 I4a), into the "Performative Theory" that the phrase "it is true that . .." has no statement-making function: by attaching it to a sentence, a speaker performs the act of endorsing the proposition expressed in that sentence. Uses of "true" in such clauses as "Is it true that . . . ?" and "If it is true that . . ." derive 98</page><page sequence="17">ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHILOSOPHY from its primary use in endorsing, and are expressive merely (Gertrude Ezorsky, "PERFORMATIVE THEORY OF TRUTH," VI. 88a-gob). Miss Ezorsky convincingly rejects both Ramsey's and Strawson's views on the ground that neither can account for "blind" statements like "I hope that what Jones will say will be true," which neither endorses what Jones will say nor expresses any attitude about it.24 However, she dismisses P. T. Geach's criticism that, according to the Performative Theory, the inference: "If x is true then p, x is true, sop," would fail for ambiguity, since on that theory "true" is expressive in the hypothetical premise, but endorsing in the categorical one. Her ground is that "a fallacy of equivocation is not committed simply because an expression has a performative use in one premise of a logical argument and a non-performative use in another" (VI, 89b). Indeed not: provided that the meaning of the expression used in these two ways is the same. But how can that be if, as the performative theorists hold, meaning is use? It is true that they also hold that the expressive use of "true" in the hypothetical premise is derivative from its performative use in the categorical premise; but that will meet Geach's objection only if the derivation of one use of "true" from the other can be exhibited as preserving its meaning. Unfortunately for the Performative Theory, J. R. Searle has shown that derivations in which "is true" is not equivocal (e.g., "If I endorse x then p, I endorse x, so p") patently misrepresent Geach's example.25 The Logical Positivists and their successors did not for the most part follow Ramsey. Many, like Carnap,26 accepted the Semantic Conception of Truth, by which Alfred Tarski hoped to do justice to the intuitions that "adhere to the classical Aristotelian conception," whose usual modern expression Tarski took to be that "the truth of a sentence consists in its agreement with (or correspondence to) 24 In "PRAGMATIC THEORY OF TRUTH" (VI, 430a-b), Miss Ezorsky argues that the Ramsey-Strawson view can be strengthened by including in it the insights underlying John Dewey's theory of truth as warranted assertibility. 25 John R.

While doubting this on Strawsonian grounds, I have suggested that, with respect to formalized languages, no harm is done by following Tarski's practice (see Section II above). In his classical paper, "The Problem of Truth in Formalized Languages" (originally published 193i), Tarski set himself the following problem. Take an object language L, some sentence of which is named "x" in the meta-language M; and let the translation into M of that same sentence in L be "p." Then it is true in M that (i) x is a true sentence if and only if p. A satisfactory definition of ". . . is (a) true (sentence)" for L would be one which entailed the truth of every sentence in L of the same form as (i), in which whatever replaces "x" is a name in M of a sentence in L, and whatever replaces "p" is a translation into M of the same sentence. Can such a definition be found? The following will not do: A p ("p" is a true sentence U-+p); for " 'p' " is not a variable. In describing Tarski's solution, Prior and Kalish rely on different papers. Prior chooses the I931 paper already mentioned, in which a true sentence in L is defined as a sentential function of L, all the variables of which are bound-that is, satisfied by all objects. There Tarski succeeded in giving, for two very simple object languages, recursive definitions of "sentential function" and of "satisfaction" of a sentential function by arbitrary objects (II, 23ob-23ia). Kalish turns instead to "Arithmetical Extensions of Relational Systems," which Tarski published in I957 with R. L. Vaught. Here Tarski defines truth in L by way of the more general notion of truth in a model for L, which he defines in turn by way of the notion of the satisfaction of a function of L in a model (VII, 35i b-353a). Although they do not contradict one another about what Tarski has shown, Prior and Kalish differ radically about what is philosophically important in it. To Kalish, it is that Tarski's methods can be applied to richer and richer formalized languages. Every serious scientific 27 Alfred Tarski, "The Semantic Conception of Truth" in H. FeigI and W. S.

VII, 35ia, 356b-357b). Prior, on the other hand, finds more important a Goedelian result in Tarski's I 931 paper: that for languages like the civilized natural languages, in which the number of logical types of variable is unlimited, any definition of truth as satisfaction, in terms of the basic material Tarski allows himself, would result in the provability of some sentence of the form: (x is a true sentence if and only if p). Yet Tarski himself went on to show that the meta-language even of an object-language of infinite order can be axiomatized by introducing into it the undefined semantical expression "true sentence." To those who complain that this makes no advance upon Moore's unanalyzed notion of correspondence, Prior retorts that "Tarski has not merely a suspicion but a proof that, where 'truth' is understood as a property of sentences [of a language as rich as English], such acceptance of a semantic term without definition is inevitable" (II, 23ib). This returns us to the ultimate philosophical core of the Corres- pondence Theory, which both Plato and Aristotle held; that for any statement there must be something in virtue of which either it or its negation is true. This Michael Dummett has justifiably labeled "realism."28 If Dummett is right in thinking that even philosophers who reject the Correspondence Theory "remain realists au fond" (Strawson?), then the failure of the Encyclopedia to discuss realism thoroughly29 may perhaps be explained by F. M. Cornford's observa- tion that the common basis of a dispute is likely to be the last thing of which the disputants are aware.30 Generalizing what Intuitionists say of mathematical propositions, Dummett denies that there must be something in virtue of which a proposition is true or false unless we 28 "Truth," Proc. Aris. Soc., LIX (1958-1959), 157. 29 The article "REALISM" (VII, 77a-83b), by R. J. Hirst, after noting that in the Middle Ages "realism" was the name given to a doctrine about universals, declares that "in modern philosophy ['realism'] is used for the view that material objects exist externally to us and independent of our sense experience" (77a). Realism in Dummett's sense appears not to be discussed in the Encyclopedia except briefly and incidentally in such articles as Charles Parsons' "BRouwER, L. E. J." and "MATHEMATICs, FOUNDATIONS OF" (see II above). The Index gives no help. 30 F. M. Cornford, The Unwritten Philosophy (Cambridge, 1950), P. 39. Cornford acknowledges A. N.

"[T]he notions of truth and falsity," he writes, "cannot be satisfactorily explained- so as to form a basis for an account of meaning once we leave the realm of effectively decidable statements" (loc. cit., p. i6i). Realists, of course, deny that the notions of truth or falsity need explanation; and maintain that if we do not know that the world is such that what a given sentence expresses is either true or false, then we do not know whether that sentence expresses a proposition. But, although neither the mathematical Intuitionists nor even the later Wittgenstein, in whose spirit Dummett writes, have "dethron[ed] truth and falsity from their central place in philosophy" (loc. cit., p. i62), the last word has not been said.3' IV. THE NEW ONTOLOGY Philosophical ontology could not be condemned as a pseudo-science by successors of the Logical Positivists who abandoned the Verifiability Principle, while retaining the Tractatus doctrine that a proposition is an expression of its truth-conditions. Ontology treats of what there is, but at the highest level of generality. When he wrote the Republic and Timaeus, Plato believed that applied mathematics is impossible if only material things exist, and so introduced into ontology kindred forms and souls, and the "receptacle" of becoming (cf. Ryle, VI, 322a-326b). Medieval philosophers who believed themselves to possess causal principles by which they could ascend from finite to infinite, were less interested in the ontological presuppositions of mundane science, and sought, like Aquinas in De Ente et Essentia, to ascertain the hierarchical order of existing substances (cf. Vernon J. Bourke, "THOMAS AQUINAS, ST.," VIII, io5a-i i6b, esp. ioga-i ioa). The ontologists on whose work the Logical Positivists built, especially Russell and Wittgenstein, rejected medieval and rationalist causal principles, and returned to the Platonic manner of investigating the ontological presuppositions of natural science and mathematics. The fundamental ontological principle of both Russell and Wittgenstein was that sentences that express truth are isomorphic 31 I have not examined Dummett's hint of a tertia via between realism and subjective idealism: that "our investigations may bring into existence what was not there before, but what they bring into existence is not of our making" (loc. cit., p. i62), because I do not understand how what my investigations bring into existence can be not of my making. 102</page><page sequence="21">ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHILOSOPHT with reality. Russell thought that strictly such sentences could be formulated only in a perfect or ideal language that is both logically adequate, and such that its undefined non-logical terms stand for constituents of reality with which we are directly acquainted (the Principle of Acquaintance). The ontology Russell sketched on these principles, which he called "Logical Atomism," was both phenomenalist and realist;32 phenomenalist, because it took material things to be logical constructions out of sense data; and realist, because it resolved sense data into simple individuals and the properties that characterize them (Alston, VII, 242a-b). Wittgenstein was more elusive. Although in the Tractatus he did not endorse the Principle of Acquaintance, neither did he embrace any alternative. "The world is my world" (5.641), but he did not say how (cf. Malcolm, VIII, 334a). Nor did he call for an improved language; for he considered that "all the propositions of our everyday language are actually in perfect logical order, just as they are" (Malcolm, VIII, 332a, quoting 5.5563). He also held, however, that a proposition pictures reality by way of its "one and only one complete analysis into elementary propositions" (ibid., quoting 3.25); and he did not claim that there are sentences in everyday language that express elementary propositions. Whether the Tractatus is realist or not is obscure, and Malcolm is content to leave it so (VIII, 332a-b). Stenius has interpreted it as realist; and certainly Wittgenstein was realist both before he published it (see his Notebooks, I914-19I6) and after (in his 1929 paper, "Some Remarks on Logical Form"). Anscombe has offered an interpretation according to which properties of objects in the world are represented by configurations of names in elementary sentences. Since Wittgenstein held that objects correspond to names, he did not, on this view, consider properties to be objects.33 32 In the sense in which this term is used in discussions of the problem of universals (see R. J. Hirst, VII, 77a, and A. D. Woozley, "UNIVERSALS," VIII, I94a-2o6b, esp. I94b-i95a). I prefer it to "Platonist," the term used by Quine, because not all realists hold Plato's view that universals exist in a higher realm than that of what we can see and touch. "Realism" and "realist," without a qualifying epithet, are so used throughout this section. 33 See G. E. M. Anscombe, An Introduction to Wittgenstein's Tractatus (London, I959), ch. 7. Edwin B. Allaire usefully examines the controversy from the realist side in "The Tractatus; Nominalistic or Realistic ?" in E. B. Allaire and others, Essays in Ontology (Iowa City and The Hague, I963), pp. 148-i65. In A Companion to Wittgenstein's Tractatus (Cambridge, i964), p. 57, Max Black gives reason to suspect that the issue is irresoluble. 103</page><page sequence="22">ALAN DONAGAN As practiced by Russell and Wittgenstein, ontology is essentially a method for determining what ontological propositions you are committed to accept by accepting a nonphilosophical proposition as true. Since they consider everyday existence propositions to be general (the proposition that Fs exist, where "F" is a complex predicate analyzable into "G" and "H," is rendered " V x[Gx A Hx]," and this in turn, in the Tractatus, as an infinite disjunction, "[Ga A Ha] V [Gb A Hb] V [Gc A Hc] V .. ."), and since the bearers of ontological commitment are the undefined names that occur in sentences expressing true elementary propositions, everyday existence propositions have little ontological significance. You and I may have the same ontology, even though you think that Fs exist and I think they do not; for we may both accept the same simple individuals, a, b, c, ... and the simple properties G and H, even though you affirm and I deny that at least one of a, b, c, . . . is both G and H. Hence, provided that agreement is reached that the sentence "God exists" expresses a proposition, and about what that proposition is,34 an atheist need not disagree with a theist about ontology. It is otherwise with such classical issues as phenomenalism versus perceptual realism, or nominalist versus realist theories of universals. Although, following Carnap, the Logical Positivists rejected these as typical metaphysical pseudo-questions, they are legitimate on the above conception of ontology. In a language adequate for expressing what is reasonably believed about the empirical world, are any of the primitive descriptive terms physicalistic? If some of them are, then phenomenalism is false. Are there primitive descriptive predicates ? If there are, then nominalism is false. Carnap tried to escape these unwelcome conclusions by laying down a Principle of Tolerance, which Bede Rundle renders as follows: "any forms of expression [may be countenanced] . . ., provided only that sufficient logical rules governing their use [are] given" (A. N. Prior and others, "LOGIC, HISTORY OF," IV, 5I3a-57ib, esp. 56ob- 56ia).35 34 A strong proviso. The legitimacy of many concepts of classical natural theology-e.g., Aquinas's esse subsistens, and Leibniz's ens necessarium-is questioned by philosophical atheists. 35 Carnap formulated thi', principle as follows: "Our attitude to [negative requirements by which certain common forms of language would be excluded] is given a general formulation in the Principle of Tolerance: It is not our business to set up prohibitions, but to arrive at conventions" (The Logical Syntax of Language [London, I937], p. 51). I04</page><page sequence="23">ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHILOSOPHY In "CARNAP, R.," Norman M. Martin describes Carnap's mature development of this idea (II, 32a-b).36 With respect to a "linguistic framework" for speaking about certain entities, both "internal" and "external" questions may arise. Internal questions are about the existence of entities within the framework. Thus, if you accept a framework containing words like "red," "hard," "house," and so forth for describing things, and variables for which those words are substitutable, then, in that framework, "Do these stones have at least one color in common?" will be an internal question.37 Answers to internal questions may be either logical or empirical. External ques- tions, on the other hand, are about the existence of the whole system of entities spoken about in the framework. The Principle of Tolerance now takes the form that " 'acceptance of a framework' carries no commitment with respect to these 'external questions' " (Martin, II, 32b). Carnap's argument for this was specious. "Acceptance or rejection of abstract linguistic forms," he maintained, "... will finally be decided by their efficiency as instruments"; answers to external questions, on the other hand, are "decrees," of which his only examples are "prohibitions based on prejudices deriving from religious, mytho- logical, metaphysical, or other irrational sources."38 To speak of frameworks as instruments insinuates misleadingly that to accept them implies no truth claim; but if they are instruments, it is for getting at the truth. "Carnap maintains that ontological questions ... are questions not of fact but of choosing a convenient conceptual scheme or framework for science," Quine observed, and righty brushed the distinction aside: "[W]ith this I agree ony if the same be conceded for every scientific hypothesis."39 Although he reaffirmed the pre-Logical Positivist conception of ontology as an investigation of the very general existence propositions to which you are committed by your nonphilosophical beliefs, Quine repudiated Russell's and Wittgenstein's principle that language and reality are isomorphic.

Not even the names in your linguistic framework commit you to asserting the reality of the entities named; for names themselves may be reparsed as predicates. Ontological commitments may, however, be incurred by affirmations of existence. [T]here is certainly [Quine wrote] commitment to entities through discourse; for we are quite capable of saying in so many words that there are black swans, . . . and that there are prime numbers above a hundred. Saying these things, we also say by implication that there are physical objects and abstract entities; for all the black swans are physical objects and all the prime numbers above a hundred are abstract entities [The Ways of Paradox, p. i28]. Although wholly untechnical, this passage gives ground for C. F. Presley's complaint that Quine has not made clear what he takes ontological commitment to be (cf. VII, 55a). Consider a Pythagorean mathematician, who holds both that there are numbers and that numbers are the stuff of the material world. It may be true that numbers are abstract entities but must a Pythagorean therefore be held to countenance abstract entities ?40 Gilbert Harman persuasively argues that, since Quine denies that expressions used to state a theory have meaning independently of its details, Quine would hold that such a Pythagorean is committed to recognizing the existence only of whatever entities he considers numbers to be.41 Quine has also stated his criterion by reference to the "canonical notation" of quantification theory. "To be assumed as an entity," he declared, "is, purely and simply, to be reckoned as the value of a variable."42 This will do on his interpretation of his canonical notation; for he takes its variables to be pronouns ranging over a universe of real objects, and reads " Vx(Fx)" as "Some object in the universe is F." Not everybody so reads it. For example, following Russell and Whitehead, Professor Ruth Marcus has read "Vx(Fx)" as "Some 40 The referential opacity of propositions about ontological commitment was first pointed out by I.

Why must it be by quantification that the referential dimension is depicted? Harman has protested that "Quine's criterion of ontological commitment ... is the truism that what a theory says there is is what the theory says there iS."45 But it is more. It is a criterion of commitment: and, while it is a truism that a theory is committed to say there is what it says there is, it is not a truism that it is committed to say nothing that it does not say there is. Undoubtedly, Quine's condition for ontological commitment is sufficient.46 Is it also necessary ? The Logical Atomists would have thought not; and their position has been defended by Gustav Bergmann in four books which, since the Second World War, are unsurpassed in philosophical intensity and depth.47 I confine myself to a few of Bergmann's elementary points. Assuming a distinction between the logical and the descriptive expressions in a language, as even Quine does, what is it for an undefined descriptive expression to be significant? The Logical Atomists had an answer: it is for it to name or refer to something, "naming" and "referring" being themselves indefinable. The link between a predicate and what it names or refers to is considered to be the same as that between an individual name and the individual it names. To those philosophers who have no difficulty in grasping the link between an individual name and what it names., this is at 43Ruth Barcan Marcus, "Interpreting Quantification," Inquiry, 5 (I962), 252-259, where she refers to A.

To object, as Quine does, that individual names may be reparsed as predicates, and that predicates do not refer to anything, being merely "true of" or "false of" what their subjects refer to, would be a non sequitur. Why should expressions that are true of, or false of, individual entities not have reference as well? After all, the proposition that a given predicate is true of a given individual does say something about the world other than that the given individual exists. Could it do so if that predicate had no counterpart in the world? And can that counterpart be distinguished from a Bergmannian referent? Before Logical Atomism is cast into outer darkness, these questions ought to be investigated. Now that hope has revived that ontological questions may be answerable by new techniques of inquiring into the presuppositions of existing human knowledge, such traditional metaphysical quarrels as that between nominalists and realists are no longer ridiculed as being about pseudo-questions. If a proposition is the expression of its truth conditions, then investigation of the referential element in sentences expressing true propositions should bear ontological fruit. Differences about this referential element have given rise to the most intractable present-day ontological disputes. Quine's confidence that there are no attributes (although there are abstract entities-namely, classes), and Bergmann's confidence that there are, plainly reflect their disagreement about whether all undefined descriptive expressions are referential. Hence, until we are clearer about reference, ontology cannot advance. Little of this is brought out in the Encyclopedia. Indeed, on ontology in the sense here in question, the Index gives a fairly accurate impression of what is offered. The entries under "Ontology" and "Being" (to which the former contains a cross-reference) are jejune. Most references given are to articles on individual philosophers; but, except for those I have mentioned, I found only "LESNIEWSKI, S.," IV, 44ia-443b, byC. Lejewski (listedunder"Ontology"), "MEINoNGA.," V, 26ia-263b, by R. M. Chisholm, and "MOORE, G. E.," V, 372a-38ib, by John 0. Nelson (listed under "Being") at all informative. As for the subject references, those under "Ontology" are: "biology," "change," "creation, religious doctrine of," "existence," "holism and individualism," "intentionality," "irrationalism," "metaphor," " realism." Only "EXISTENCE," III, 14ia-147a, by A. N. Prior, and "INTENTIONALITY," IV, 20ia-204a, by R. M. Chisholm, helped. Nor were the subject entries under "Being" and "Existence" (to i08</page><page sequence="27">ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHILOSOPHr which there is a cross-reference under "Being," but not under "Ontology") any more useful. Two special points call for final comment. (i) A. D. Woozley maintains, in "UNIVERSALS," that a nominalist ontology can be vindicated by a version of the resemblance theory of universals developed by H. H. Price; and (2) Norman Malcolm appears to endorse an argument he finds in Wittgenstein's Philosophical Investiga- tions against the picture theory of language on which the ontology of the Tractatus rests. (i) Russell had argued that resemblance theories of universals cannot support nominalism, because the predicate ". . . resembles. . ." itself signifies a universal. To this, following H. H. Price, Woozley replies that "the resemblance we notice between any pair of similar individuals is as individual as they" (VIII, 205a). Although, since each and every individual resemblance bears an individual resemblance to each and every other, the series of individual resemblances must be infinite, Price rightly held that "there is nothing logically vicious ... about that" (VIII, 205a). The difficulty is not that the set of individual relations postulated must be infinite, but rather that there is no reason why its members should be accounted resemblances. If resemblances are individual, then differences are too. Therefore, since every pair of similar individuals is also a pair of differing individuals, every individual resemblance has an individual difference as a counterpart. We have two infinite sets of individual relations, each member of one having a counterpart in the other: why are the members of one held to be resemblances, and those of the other to be differences? The solution seems to be that all the members of the set of resemblances are resemblances, and that all those of the set of differences are differences. The universal signified by the two-place predicate ". . . resembles. . ." can indeed be expelled, and replaced by an infinite set of individual resemblances; but it cannot be prevented from returning in the shape of a universal signified by the one-place predicate "... is a resemblance." (2) According to Norman Malcolm, Wittgenstein in the Tractatus held that language is ultimately composed of names, that the meaning of a name is a simple object, and that the sense of a sentence arises from the names that compose it. One name stands for one thing, another for another thing, and the combination pictures a state of affairs (4.031i). Thus, naming is prior to the sense of sentences [VIII, 337a]. I09</page><page sequence="28">ALAN DONAGAN Against this view, Malcolm describes Wittgenstein as arguing in Philosophical Investigations that before one can find out what a name stands for one must already have mastered the language game to which the name belongs. In order to learn the name of a color, a direction, a sensation, one must have some grasp of the activities of placing colors in order, of reading a map, of responding to words, gestures and behavior that are expressions of sensation. Merely pointing at something and saying a word achieves nothing [VIII, 337a]. This shows that we do not learn the meaning of a name before we learn the sense of any sentence containing it. But did the Tractatus doctrine that the sense of a sentence arises from the names composing it imply anything at all about how we learn the meanings of names? The names of natural languages do not name simples; nor was it anywhere implied that the simples for which names stand, in the elementary sentences Wittgenstein postulated, could be spatially separated, and labeled like bottles. If the Tractatus teaches anything about how the meanings of names in a natural language are learned, it is that the process is complicated. It says this about how they are understood (4.oo2). Has Philosophical Investigations an ontology? Not, I think, an explicit one. Ontological topics are discussed in it, like the difficulties in the concept of an absolute simple (Malcolm, VIII, 335b-336a). But its fundamental problem is: what is it to mean something by an utterance? And this, although its solution bears on the picture theory of language, is but indirectly ontological. Wittgenstein's most searching discussion of it, which impresses me as the profoundest passage in Philosophical Investigations, is Part II, Section xi. His editors inform us that he would have suppressed portions of Part I, and worked this, with other material, into its place (ibid., p. vi). In "WITTGENSTEIN, L. J. J.," Malcolm elects to say little about Part II, although he has discussed it illuminatingly elsewhere.48 This is a pity; for what Wittgenstein there implies about the picture theory of language is subtler than the meaning-as-use theory of Part I, which Malcolm presents (cf. VIII, 336b-337b, 339b). That the picture theory is wanting is shown by such examples as Jastrow's duck-rabbit picture, which is isomorphic with two different 48 Norman Malcolm, Knowledge and Certainty (Englewood Cliffs, N. J., i963), pp. 96-I!29, esp. pp. I 9-I!20. In what I go on to say, I have been influenced by this; but even more by Rush Rhees's preface to Ludwig Wittgenstein, The Blue and the Brown Books (Oxford, 1958), pp. v-xiv, esp. pp. xii-xiv. 110</page><page sequence="29">ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHILOSOPHY states of affairs, and can be seen as depicting now one, now the other (Investigations, pp. 194-195). The change of aspect can be brought about at will, and can be experienced; but seeing the picture as a picture of a duck, say, is not an experienceable inner process. A man shows what he sees it as by what he does and says. The parallel with meaning is striking (ibid., p. 214). A man may mean now one thing, now another, by the word "march": and although which he means is shown by what he does and says (by what language games he plays with it), he can experience the change in what he means by it. Yet meaning by it, say, the third month, is not an experienceable inner process: "no process could have the consequences of meaning" (ibid., p. 2i8). Wittgenstein appears to be intimating that a state which I can experience as changing, although not itself an experienceable process, controls what language game is played: the language game played is not sufficient unto itself. And, at one point, he seems to me to hint that the picture theory itself was a mistaken attempt to do justice to this fact (ibid., p. 215). If this section of Philosophical Investigations, when it is better understood, throws light on what is true in the picture theory, it will have an indirect bearing on ontology. V. THE REVOLT AGAINST CARTESIANISM Plato deplored the existence of a party of "Giants" who "obstinately maintain that only the things that can be touched or handled have being, because they define being and body as one, and if anyone says that what is not a body exists, they utterly despise him."49 For almost three centuries it has been philosophical orthodoxy that Descartes refuted materialism once for all: until recently, the party of the Giants has been an insignificant sect. Descartes's anti-materialism followed from, his dualist doctrine that the human mind is really distinct from the human body. This rested on three identifications. Body, or matter, was identified with substance having extension as its essential attribute; mind was identified with substance having consciousness (cogitatio) as its essential attribute; and a real distinction between substances was, in effect, identified with the logical possibility of one's existing without the other. In his valuable discussion of Descartes's dualism ("DEscARTEs, R.," II, 49 Plato, Sophist, 246A-B. I I I</page><page sequence="30">ALAN DONAGAN 344a-354b, esp. 348a-b), Bernard Williams does not sufficiently distinguish it from its near relation, the doctrine that the "I" whose existence is established by the Cogito is res cogitans. It must also be distinguished from causal interactionism, the classical arguments against which were formulated by Spinoza (cf. Alasdair MacIntyre, "SPINOZA, B.," VII, 530b-54ib, esp. 534a-b). In philosophy today these distinctions are crucial. Those seeking what is alive in the philosophy of Descartes cannot do better than go to the work of Gustav Bergmann. Bergmann affirms the real distinction of mind and body ("The conscious state and the brain states that go together are of course two things and not one"),50 while denying that the "I" of the Cogito is a substance ("Are a mind and the series [of conscious states] which belongs to it two or are they one? Since there are no substances in my world, I agree with those who hold that they are one"))51 and, even more emphatically, repudiating causal interactionism.52 Philosophers who have no stomach for the parallelist or epiphenom- enalist implications of positions like Bergmann's53 are inevitably drawn to a monistic alternative (in "MIND-BODY PROBLEM," V, 336a- 346a, esp. 342b-343bJerome Shaffer describes their reasons). Russell and the Logical Positivists experimented with varieties of neutral monism: in particular, with phenomenalism. But, although one phenomenalist system continues to be seriously discussed-namely, that developed by Nelson Goodman in The Structure of Appearance (see Richard Rudner, "GOODMAN, N.," III, 37oa-374b, esp. 372b-373b)-Goodman himself has disavowed any commitment to phenomenalism as against physicalism (III, 373b). For the most part, neutral monism is considered to present even more difficulties than dualism (cf. Shaffer, V, 340b; Hirst, VI, 132a-134b; Alston, VII, 24ib-242a). Anti-dualists who are repelled by subjective idealism are therefore tempted to enlist in the party of the Giants. 50 Gustav Bergmann, Logic and Reality, p. 2 I. 51 Ibid., p. 328. 52 "The physical universe is comprehensively lawful and causally closed. Hence the only way in which a conscious state, whether perceptual or volitional or anything else, can interact with any part of the physical universe is through its parallel brain state" (ibid., pp. 2I-22). 53 "A scientist ... remains within his province when he tells us that the nexus between the two states is not one of cause and effect in either direction. Whenever there is the one, there is the other, and conversely. That is all" (ibid., p. 2i). For Bergmann's denial that the distinction between parallelism and epiphenomenalism is ultimately intelligible, cf. ibid., p. i2i n. 112</page><page sequence="31">ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHILOSOPHY Psychologists led the way. In "PSYCHOLOGICAL BEHAVIORISM" (VI, 5 I 6b-520a), Charles Taylor explains economically how psychol- ogists like Thorndike transformed the nineteenth-century associationist theory of learned adaptation into a behaviorist theory in which reference to mental events ("ideas") in the nineteenth-century manner was prohibited (VI, 5 I 8a-b). Both Taylor and Arnold Kaufman ("BEHAVIORISM, I, 268b-273a) agree that behaviorists have not produced an adequate definition of behavior in their own terms of stimulus and response: either it is defined so narrowly that it is identified with a subset of bodily motions, of which no useful theory has ever been advanced; or it is defined so accommodatingly that some behavior is identified with intentional action, with the consequence that a dualist interpretation is not ex hypothesi excluded (cf. Kaufman, I, 269b, 27ia-b; Taylor, VI, 5i8b, 519b). The most influential philosopher to employ behaviorist techniques in attacking dualism (which "with deliberate abusiveness" he nicknamed "the dogma of the ghost in the machine")54 was Gilbert Ryle. I have heard it maintained that Ryle merely introduced to the British philosophical public a point of view familiar to American philosophers from their psychological studies. But if there were inglorious American Ryles, they appear to have been mute. At least, they have left no trace in the Encyclopedia. Paul Kurtz does not mention them in "AMERICAN PHILOSOPHY"; and the only American philosopher mentioned by Arnold Kaufman in discussing philosophical behaviorism is the anti-behaviorist A. 0. Lovejoy, for a reply to whose "Paradox of a Thinking Behaviorist" (1922) he goes to Ryle (I, 270b). The concept Ryle principally exploited was that of a disposition. As Keith Campbell records ("MATERIALISM," V, I 7ga-I88b), "Ryle and his followers offered to show that attributions of intention and intelligence, choice, desire, excitement, fear and so on all are to be understood as attributions of a disposition to behave in a characteristic manner in suitable circumstances" (V, I84a). Their claim was plausible because, as Kaufman shows, dispositional analyses can account for the intentionality of mental acts (I, 270b). Although Ryle refused to repudiate the description "behaviorist,"55 his analyses affronted behaviorist orthodoxy in two respects. First, "4Gilbert Ryle, The Concept of Mind (London, I949), pp. 15-i6. 55 Urmson asserts that Ryle "repudiated [the] label [of philosophical behaviorist] in advance" (VII, 270b). But Ryle wrote that "the general trend of [The Concept of Mind] will undoubtedly, and harmlessly be stigmatised I 3 8</page><page sequence="32">ALAN DONAGAN he sometimes refers to what Feigl has called "raw feels"-to twinges, thrills, flutters, and glows-in a way irreconcilable with behaviorism; and although Urmson writes off these references as "a relic of the essentially private in Ryle's public world" (VII, 270b), I do not think Ryle could or would get rid of them. Secondly, his conception of the public and witnessable is not that of the stricter sects of S-R behaviorism. He goes for examples to candidates at examinations rather than to rats in T-mazes. Following Wittgenstein, he is aware that private "inner" episodes do not confer meaning on themselves by some magic which their public "outer" counterparts lack. The intellectual act of drawing a conclusion may be public and witnessable, as when an examination candidate utters some such words as "This, so that." No intellectual act is performed, however, when a parrot, or a man asleep, utters the very same words. What is the difference? Ryle answers that the words must be uttered in a certain "frame of mind"; and his concept of a frame of mind is necessarily connected with that of being able to make certain avowals.56 Since what is avowed is not witnessed,57 this part of Ryle's work is not behaviorist. Just as psychologists led philosophers in using behaviorist techniques, so they have led philosophers in the more recent movement from behaviorism to centralism. Ryle's philosophical analyses correspond to the "peripheralist" position that psychology is a molar science of behavior correlating the stimuli impinging on the periphery of the organism and the gross observable responses made by the organism (Taylor, VI, 5i9a). Peripheralism in psychology is "having more and more trouble maintaining itself," partly because its results have been "relatively meager and very disparate," and partly because it has been both multiplying the theoretical entities it postulates and extending the meaning of basic concepts like "stimulus," "response," and "drive" in ways that render it questionable even by its own criteria (Taylor, VI, 5i 9b). The beneficiary of these doubts whether correlations between stimuli and responses can be erected into a science of human behavior has been "centralism"; the doctrine that "central processes in the brain or nervous system ... determine the course of both perception and response" (Taylor, VI, 5i9a). as 'behaviourist' " (Concept of Mind, p. 327; my italics). The behaviorism Ryle condemned as mechanist or para-mechanist was carefully described as "early" (ibid., p. 328). 56 Gilbert Ryle, The Concept of Mind, p. 301. 5' Ibid., pp. 176-178, 183-185. 114</page><page sequence="33">ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHILOSOPHY Psychologists' dissatisfaction with correlations between gross stimuli and responses as the foundation of their science has an exact parallel in philosophers' dissatisfaction with Ryle's dispositional analyses, as voiced by Campbell. Both dissatisfied parties demand causal analyses. Mental states, after all, are plausibly held to be causes of behavior. Psychological peripheralism either ignores them, or, like Ryle's philosophical behaviorism, analyzes them dispositionally: in effect, as patterns of behavior. But a pattern of behavior cannot cause that of which it is a pattern (Campbell, V, 184a). In addition, centralism holds out some hope of dealing with those episodic relics of the essentially private which, as Urmson noticed, Ryle retained. Philosophical centralism has two stages. The first is to supply analyses of mental states in terms of postulated "central" states of the organism, conceived as arising from certain stimuli, or as issuing in characteristic kinds of behavior, or both. These analyses are "topic-neutral," because the theoretical central states postulated in them are characterized neither as material nor as immaterial. Their range is persuasively exhibited in D. M. Armstrong's A Materialist Theory of the Mind (London, i968). At the second stage, most philosophical centralists go on to argue that the postulated central states are in fact identical with states of the organism's central nervous system (Campbell, V, i85a). The questions about centralism that will prove decisive have to do with its first stage. When J. T. Stevenson, discussingJ. J. C. Smart's "Sensations and Brain Processes,"58 distinguished two sorts of properties-M-properties, which are allowable in a materialist scheme, and P-properties, namely "those defining properties for 'sensation' which prevent us from defining 'sensation' in terms of M-properties"59-Smart rejoined that, in his view, there are no P-properties: "Sensations do have features . . ., but these features, save perhaps for some topic-neutral ones like waxing and waning, are not immediately apprehended or mentioned in sensation-reports."60 A topic-neutral strategy in specifying the central states that are to function as causes of behavior is possible only if there are no P-properties. Are there none ?61 58 Philosophical Review, LXVIII (I959), I41-I56. 59 Ibid., LXIX (i960), 507. 60 Ibid., LXX (i961), 407. 61 Much in this paragraph I owe to some remarks in conversation by Professor Douglas Gasking. The major idea in it is lucidly expressed by Professor Max Deutscher: "[Smart's] theory of the identification of mind I 15</page><page sequence="34">ALAN DONAGAN In "PSYCHOLOGY" (VII, Ia-27b), R. S. Peters and C. A. Mace describe the psychological tradition that begins with Descartes's doctrine that "all modes of consciousness are states of the soul," and culminates in the theory that states of mind are analyzable into mental acts and their contents ("intentions"). Peters and Mace rightly draw attention to G. E. Moore's "negative introspective report-that the act is diaphanous, unintrospectable";62 but add, with depressing frivolity, "Exit the act, the last claimant to mentality" (VII, 27a).63 Moore himself did not draw this conclusion; for he continued to number acts of consciousness among existents (J. 0. Nelson, V, 377a); and, although he came to doubt whether the act-content distinction applied to sensation, that was because he wondered whether the apparent content might not be a mode of the act (R. J. Hirst, "SENsA," VII, 407a-415a, esp. 413b). The Encyclopedia shows that "the last claimant to mentality" still gains adherents: Charles Landesman, Jr., presents Moore's act-content analysis of consciousness as a live option ("CONSCIOUSNESS, II, 1i9b-i95a, esp. 193b-194a); R. J. Hirst declares that "visual sense-data, such as color shapes, would seem clearly ... to require an act-object analysis" (VII, 413b); Bruce Aune analyzes both intentions ("INTENTION," IV, Ig8b-20 ia) and thinking ("THINKING," VIII, Iooa-Io4a) in terms of act and content, in the former article defending the concept of a private mental act (IV, 200b) ;64 and R. M. Chisholm's articles, "BRENTANO, F.." (I, 365a- 368b) and "INTENTIONALITY," are in the same tradition, although he tends to eschew the word "act." Some contemporary philosophers hold that the contents of acts and matter is a theory expressed in terms of something known in part, but not identified, by the subject, and known more fully, and identified as a brain state, by an observer. [It] is not a theory that something is first identified in one way and then in another" ("Mental and Physical Properties," in C. F. Presley [ed.], The Identity Theory of Mind [University of Queensland, i967], p. 7I). 62 G. E. Moore, "The Refutation of Idealism," Philosophical Studies (London, I922), p. 25. 63 Contrast: "In an unforgettable metaphor G. E. Moore once called awareness diaphanous or transparent. What he wanted to call attention to was that, because we are so prone to attend to their contents, the awarenesses themselves easily elude us" (Gustav Bergmann, Meaning and Existence, p. 34). In the same book, there is a non-malicious history of act-psychology (ibid., pp. 9-17). 64 Aune has acknowledged the influence of Wilfrid Sellars, Science, Perception and Reality, passim. I i6</page><page sequence="35">ENCrCLOPEDIA OF PHILOSOPHY of sensation, or what corresponds to those contents, cannot be described except in terms of P-properties. Accepting an "adverbial" or modal analysis of visual sense contents, Sellars and Aune for one set of reasons, Chisholm for another, maintain that some adverbs that are true of acts of sensation cannot be true of any part of the brain or nervous system as science now conceives either. They do not deny that an identity theory may turn out to be true; but they hold that, if it does, our beliefs about matter will have been changed.65 In setting out to show that P-properties must be recognized, it was to mental acts that Moore himself looked: he even implied that nobody who distinguished mental acts from their contents could be a materialist.66 Of course Moore did not use Stevenson's term "P-property"; and in examining his work it will be necessary to extend the meaning of "P-property" to "defining property of any mental act or content which prevents us from defining that act or content in terms of M-properties." Several approaches on Moorean lines are possible. Since mental acts all "intend" their contents, their immateriality may be demonstrable by finding a logical criterion of the intentional that is not shared by any of the sentences we must use in describing material phenomena. Chisholm has made progress in this direction, although he has not yet obtained decisive results (cf. Chisholm, IV, 203a-204a). The older approach is implicit in Moore's own work. In acts of perceiving, a man is conscious of what he sees, hears, and so forth; and in acts of thinking, he is conscious of what he thinks. Although pure ostensive definition is as futile here as elsewhere, for reasons given by Wittgenstein (cf. Hamlyn, I, 14Ia), the meaning of the predicate ". . . is conscious of . . ." is not hard to grasp, provided you have learned the ordinary verbs of perceiving and thinking, and that you understand the act-content distinction. The diaphanousness of acts of consciousness is not a difficulty; for the meaning of .... is conscious of. . ." is not learned by ostensive definition. Suppose a neurophysiological theory T were to be developed 65 Wilfrid Sellars, "The Identity Approach to the Mind-Body Problem," Review of Metaphysics, i8 (I965), reprinted in Philosophical Perspectives (Springfield, Ill., i967); Bruce Aune, Knowledge, Mind and Nature (New York, I967), pp. 241-244; R. M. Chisholm, Theory of Knowledge (Englewood Cliffs, N.J., i966), pp. 99-i02. 66 "That many people fail to distinguish [the act of consciousness from its content] at all is sufficiently shown by the fact that there are materialists" (G. E. Moore, Philosophical Studies, p. 20). I 17</page><page sequence="36">ALAN DONAGAN according to which the various waking activities of human life, in various conditions of stimulation, were explained by postulating that certain conditions obtained in the agent's brain.67 Suppose, in addition, that a condition C of the brain of living human beings were identified, which alone appeared to be necessary to the occurrence of all the special conditions by which their various waking activities were explained. It is conceivable that, suitably corroborated, the theory T would become well entrenched. In that case, materialist centralists would not hesitate to identify being conscious with having one's brain in condition C. Furthermore, that* identification could in principle pass into everyday speech. Just as an irascible man may semi-jokingly be begged to "let that adrenalin subside" rather than to calm down, so, if the theory T became well entrenched, one might commiserate with an insomniac by saying, "What a pity you can't get out of condition C," instead of, "What a pity you can't fall asleep." It is of the last importance that such theories as T are theories not of consciousness, but of certain human activities under certain conditions of stimulation, which enable us to dispense with many pre-scientific explanations in terms of mental states. Not only materialist centralists, but also parallelists like Bergmann, expect that a theory like T will be developed; and Richard Rorty has argued that, if the explanatory functions of the concept of consciousness disappear, it too will disappear, like the concepts of phlogiston and of a caloric fluid. Bergmann has denied this, on the ground that the concept of consciousness is needed in order to state facts about accompaniments of human activity that do not enter into causal explanations of it. Obviously, Bergmann cannot be refuted by showing that the concept of consciousness is scientifically redundant.68 It is necessary to show that consciousness is not a P-property. That consciousness is a P-property can be shown by the following example. The theory T is well entrenched. A scientist who accepts it is lying in bed after an accident. Before his eyes is an encephalograph, 67 In the example that follows and what I have to say about it, I am indebted to Kurt Baier, "Smart on Sensations," Australasian Journal of Philosophy, 40 (1962), 57-68; and to Richard Rorty, "Mind-Body Identity, Privacy, and Categories," Review of Metaphysics, i9 (I965), reprinted in Stuart Hampshire (ed.) Philosophy of Mind (New York, I966), pp. 30-63. 68 See Rorty, loc. cit., pp. 32-39. For this reason I cannot accept Rorty's view that materialists can concede that concepts such as consciousness are not topic-neutral, and can defend materialist centralism simply as a "disappearance theory." xx8</page><page sequence="37">ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHILOSOPHY which has been attached to his head and which shows that his brain is not in condition C. Witnesses observe him to open his eyes, and, barely moving his lips, but distinctly, to utter words corresponding to the numerical reading of the encephalograph, followed by, "Oh, I'm not conscious." His eyes close again. Before the encephalograph shows his brain to have returned to condition C, however, he twice more opens his eyes and delivers himself of an identical utterance, save that on each occasion the numerical readings of the encephalograph to which his utterances correspond are different. Afterward, he remembers nothing. This example is not incompatible with the truth of the theory T; for persons not in condition C sometimes open their eyes and utter intelligible sentences, as when they are asleep. If the theory T were well entrenched, what would be surprising about the example would be that the injured man's utterances corresponded to encephalograph readings, and to correct inferences from those readings, according to the identification of consciousness based on the theory T. While not implying that these things could not happen, the theory T does not explain them. Materialist centralists and parallelists would both hold that they must be explicable by a theory more comprehensive than T. Plain men will hold that the injured man thrice briefly regained consciousness. Even if a more comprehensive theory T' were devised, by which the phenomena in our example were causally explained by the injured scientist's brain being in condition C', nevertheless, provided only that T' allows, as it must, for such phenomena as talking while asleep, a further possible example could be constructed, in which a true and well-founded utterance, "I am not now in condition C'," was made. Hence, for any theory such as T, however comprehensive, a sentence corresponding to "I am not now in condition C" must be intelligible. What is philosophically interesting about this is that, if consciousness be identified with having one's brain in a condition specified by a theory such as T, then the sentence "I am not now conscious of anything" must also be intelligible. Notoriously, it is not. If ". . . is conscious of . . ." means what most English speakers mean by it, then ".... not be conscious of anything" has no first-person present-tense use. Although when I am conscious of something, I can avow it, there are no circumstances in which I can intelligibly disavow it. Since it is evident that if consciousness is an M-property, it will be identifiable with having one's brain or central nervous system in a state specified by a theory such as T, a similar argument I 19</page><page sequence="38">ALAN DONAGAN can be constructed against any identification of consciousness with an M-property. Hence, by the definition of a P-property, consciousness is a P-property.69 In the principal articles that treat of materialist centralism, Campbell's "MATERIALISM," Landesman's "CONSCIOUSNESS," and Shaffer's "MIND-BODY PROBLEM, opinion about it is divided. Landesman, describing the view of one of the earliest centralists, U. T. Place, as the view that "consciousness is a process in the brain, where 'is' designates a relation of composition" (II, 194b), and dismisses it on the ground that, while brain processes are events, the centralists have not made clear in what sense they think that consciousness, or indeed anything else, could be composed of events (II, I94b). If he had had the opportunity to read Campbell's "MATERIALISM," I do not think Landesman would have written so. Shaffer does not deny, although he considers it too early to accept, the common scientific hypothesis that "each particular mental event occurs if and only if some particular brain event occurs" (V, 339a). This hypothesis, however, implies neither the truth nor the plausibility of the identification of mental events with "neural" ones (V, 33ga-b). Against its plausibility, Shaffer advances two arguments: (I) that whereas two putatively different things can turn out to be one and the same only if they have the same location, and central neural events do have a location, "it makes no sense to ask where in the body [a mental event] occurred" (V, 339b); and (2) since a subject has privileged access to events in his own mind, but not to those in his brain, events in his mind cannot be identical with events in his brain (V, 339b)- What a materialist centralist might reply to Shaffer's first argument may be inferred from Campbell's criticism of C. D. Broad's argument that molecular movements in the brain have properties of rapidity, configuration, and direction, which it is nonsense to ascribe to mental acts.70 Campbell argues that if mental acts are "dealt with by a topic-neutral strategy," they can be "held to be the covert presentation of bodily changes," even though predicative expressions used to describe them are not "just . . . names for the same characteristics" 69 After the draft of this article had been submitted to the editors of this Review, I had the benefit of discussion of the ideas in this section of it at a colloquium at the University of Wisconsin at Madison. I am indebted to those who attended for a number of revisions and clarifications. 70 Campbell refers to C. D. Broad, The Mind and Its Place in Nature (London, 1925), p. 623- 120</page><page sequence="39">ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHILOSOPHr as are named by predicative expressions used to describe the central events with which they are identified (V, i86b). Shaffer's and Broad's arguments both presuppose that at least some expressions by which mental acts are described are not topic-neutral; but, since they do not demonstrate their presupposition, Campbell is entitled to question it. Campbell does not, even by implication, provide a rejoinder to Shaffer's second argument. He does, it is true, outline Smart's and Armstrong's replies to a related argument from the alleged incorrigibility of avowals of mental states (V, i 87a-b). But privileged access does not imply incorrigibility; for a subject may be inattentive or slipshod in his reports. Replies to Shaffer's argument have, however, been made.7' What is called privileged access is put down as nothing but the capacity of human beings to make avowals of their own mental states, and only of their own-avowals the reliability of which is held to be an empirical matter. Nothing in that is incompatible with materialism. As for Shaffer's premise that "mental events can be known, but not in the way physical events can be known" (V, 339b), it is held to beg the question: since they are topic-neutral, it cannot be taken for granted that avowals of mental states may not turn out to refer to central physical states. In the Encyclopedia, materialists win most battles on specific issues, but not the war. In a number of articles, the concept of a mental act is vindicated; and, if there are mental acts, the topic-neutral strategy is implausible. Whether or not the particular argument I have advanced against that strategy holds water, others can certainly be found. And if the topic-neutral strategy is illegitimate, materialist centralism is ruined. Would Cartesianism then be restored? Shaffer, echoing (perhaps unconsciously) Descartes's famous letter to Princess Elizabeth,72 would appear to think so: It may well be [he writes] that the relation between mind and body is an ultimate, unique, and unanalyzable one. If so, philosophical wisdom would consist in giving up the attempt to understand the relation in terms of other, more familiar ones and accepting it as the anomaly it is [V, 345a]. The precedent of other restorations is not hopeful: as Byron said of the restored Bourbons, their crutch, although repaired, was "a prop 71 E.g., D. M. Armstrong, A Materialist Theory of the Mind, pp. 107-109. 72 28 June i643, in Correspondence, ed. by Adam and Milhaud, no. 3I0; ZEuvres, ed. by Adam and Tannery, iii, 69o. 121</page><page sequence="40">ALAN DONAGAN not quite so certain as before." If we are not to fall back on Bergmann's parallelism, the possibility of a materialist emergence theory ought to be explored. The Encyclopedia barely enters this ill-charted territory: its article "EMERGENT EVOLUTIONISM" (by T. A. Goudge, II, 474a-477a), while useful, is largely historical. J. J. C. Smart ("RELIGION AND SCIENCE," VII, 158a-i63b, esp. i6ia) is justly caustic about "evolu- tionary metaphysics of the type expounded by Bergson or, in a more popular form, by George Bernard Shaw, which provides a sort of substitute for religion." VI. THE THEORY OF HUMAN ACTION Since The Concept of Mind and Philosophical Investigations appeared, the theory of action has been closely studied by philosophers. Scientific psychologists, pursuing their elusive theoretical quarries, have with good reason preferred the evidence of manipulable animal behavior to the bewildering complexities that exercise students of human affairs. One day, we are assured, psychology will put the study of man on a scientific basis; but, for the present, we must make do with imagination and sympathetic insight. It is not surprising that legal theorists and historians have been less than satisfied; or that, thinking of their work now as being theoretical as well as imaginative (and is not physics itself imaginative?), they have sought to improve it by inquiring into their presuppositions and methods. Inevitably, they turned to classical philosophical psychology, which, from Aristotle's De Anima and Nicomachean Ethics, through Aquinas' and Duns Scotus' studies of intellect and will, to the modern tradition from Locke to Brentano, had never lost touch with the other "moral" sciences. So began a collaboration between philosophers, legal theorists, and methodologically inclined historians, which has now flourished for over a decade.73 The treatment of human action in the Encyclopedia is imaginative and up to date. In the cardinal article, CHOOSING, DECIDING, AND DOING" (II, 96a-IO4b), Andrew Oldenquist perceptively condenses established results and suggests lines of future inquiry, some of which have proved fruitful since he wrote. The related articles on which I 73 Compare, for example, Herbert Morris, Freedom and Responsibility: Readings in Philosophy and Law (Stanford, i96i), which shows that his complaint, "[I]t is as if philosophers had never heard of the law and lawyers of philosophy" (p. iv), is no longer true. 122</page><page sequence="41">EXCTCLOPEDIA OF PHILOSOPHr have chiefly drawn are: Richard Taylor, "CAUSATION" (II, 56a-66b) and "DETERMINISM" (II, 35ga-373b); W. P. Alston, "MOTIVES AND MOTIVATION" (V, 399b-409b); Bruce Aune, "INTENTION" and "THINKING"; Keith S. Donnellan, "REASONS AND CAUSES" (VII, 85b-88b); and G. N. A. Vesey, "VOLITION" (VIII, 258b-260b). The Index entry, "Action," appears to be reasonably adequate, although it does not mention Taylor's "CAUSATION." Since the shadow of controversy about determinism falls on virtually every topic in the theory of action, I will try to let in a little light by disposing of an obfuscating determinist sophism. In an article signed "R. E. Hobart," with the provocative title, "Free Will as Involving Determinism and Inconceivable Without It,"74 Dickinson Miller offered an argument which may be recast as: (a) Any item of behavior that is causally undetermined is uncaused. (b) Any item of behavior that is uncaused is an accidental, chance event. (c) No accidental, chance event is a free action. Therefore, (d) No item of behavior that is causally undetermined is a free action. Herbert Feigl describes Miller's article as a "locus classicus" ("MILLER, D. S.," V, 323b-324a). As I have recast its argument (fairly, as I think), most readers who recall the history of the concept of causation will smell a fallacy of equivocation. In "CAUSATION," Taylor neatly exposes its root. Two doctrines about causation must be distinguished: (I) the principle of universality, that no change can occur without some cause, which has "throughout the history of philosophy, until very recent times, usually been regarded as very obvious, sometimes even self-evident" (II, 57b); and (2) the principle of uniformity, that causal relations between changes or states can be expressed in the form of general laws (II, 57b), which, although anticipated by the Greek atomists, "is relatively recent in philosophy and arose, more or less, with the development and growth of science" (II, 58a). The principle of universality was originally put forward in connection with the ancient unanalyzed conception 74 Mind, 43 (I934), 1-27. 123</page><page sequence="42">ALAN DONAGAN of a cause as "that which produces something and in terms of which that which is produced, its effect, can be explained" (II, 56a). That this conception does not involve the principle of uniformity is shown by the standard examples of efficient causality: a maker causes what he makes, a man causes his voluntary movements, God causes the existence of the universe. Taylor records that "John Stuart Mill, following Thomas Reid, distinguished efficient causes from what he called 'physical' causes, delimiting the former to the causation of a voluntary act by an agent, but he considered the concept of an efficient cause, as thus conceived, to be esoteric-capable of being confirmed only by oneself" (II, 57a). I do not know to what passage Taylor here refers. We can now return to Miller's argument. Premise (a) presupposes a concept of causation upon which the principle of uniformity is true: a concept something like Mill's of physical causation. Premise (b) is one of the grounds on which the principle of universality is asserted, and presupposes no particular conception of causation at all. Certainly, (b) does not presuppose what (a) implies, that the Aristotelian conception of agent causation is improper. Indeed, no Judaeo- Christian Aristotelian could possibly accept (b), if in it "uncaused" were to be understood in terms of the principle of uniformity, as in (a) it must be; for (b) would then imply that, had it occurred, that medieval paradigm of causation, the free creation of the universe by God, would have been an accidental, chance event! From the first appearance of the principle of uniformity, acute minds have separated it from the principle of universality. Taylor records that the skeptic Carneades (2I3-138 B.c.) argued against the Epicureans that, in acting freely, although men "are simply the sources of their own behavior, which is therefore caused," it does not follow "that a man's actions are random, like the swerves of the atoms" (II, 369b). I am not ashamed to have been ignorant of Carneades' argument (see also R. P. Hallie, "CARNEADES," II, 33b-35a, esp. 34b); but I do blame myself that I knew nothing about Thomas Reid's argument, against Hume, that there is no reason why men may not be the original causes of their own voluntary actions, which is precisely what all men believe themselves to be. This way of viewing the matter permits us to say that determinism ... is false and, further, that nothing occurs without any cause whatsoever [II, 370a].75 75See also C. D. Broad, "Determinism, Indeterminism, and Libertarianism," Ethics and the History of Philosophy (London, 1952), pp. 195-217, esp. pp. 212-217. 124</page><page sequence="43">ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHILOSOPHr Although in "REM, T.," (VII, I i8b-I2ib) S. A. Grave does not discuss this argument, he throws light on how Reid developed it. The concept of causation by an agent is now so generally received that, beginning an often-cited paper, Daniel Bennett treats it as a commonplace that Someone does some thing, i.e., he acts, only if he causes (determines, makes) some object or objects to have some property or properties.76 This condition, Bennett recognizes, is necessary but not sufficient: "basic to our idea of action," he adds, "is the idea of agency somehow modified by intention and reason."77 The concept of intentional causing introduces a difficulty. Suppose Jones opens a door to a room, thereby startling Smith, who is inside. Oldenquist points out that Jones's action can be described both as ''opening a door" and as "startling Smith," as well as in other ways. That Jones startled Smith is a result or consequence of his opening the door,78 but the sentence "Jones startled Smith" does not describe any other action than Jones's opening of the door. "There is," Oldenquist comments, "... no rigid distinction between action and consequence, and we are free to construe many characteristics either as results or as constitutive of an expanded version of the action" (II, ioib). Joel Feinberg has happily named this feature of action- descriptions "the accordion effect."79 Now, supposing Jones not to have known that Smith was in the room, while his opening of the door was intentional, his startling of Smith was not. Therefore, since they are the same action, the same action would appear to have the Broad beautifully elucidates the concept of "non-occurrent" agent causation, even though, when he wrote, he was sufficiently a child of his time to dismiss that concept, on a petitio principii, as absurd (ibid., p. 215). 76 "Action, Reason, and Purpose," Journal of Philosophy, LXII (I965), 85. 77 Bennett, ibid., p. 85. 78 Oldenquist points out that 'y can be a consequence of x when y is not at all caused by x, for example, when a consequence of extending one's arm from a car window is that a turn signal is given" (II, 102a-b). Hence we can say that Jones's opening the door has as a consequence Jones's startling Smith, without implying that, by opening the door, Jones caused himself to startle Smith. I owe this point to Donald Davidson's contribution to the University of Western Ontario's Colloquium, "Agent, Action, and Reason," I November I 968. 79 "Action and Responsibility," in Max Black (ed.), Philosophy in America (Ithaca, N. Y., I965), p. 146. 125</page><page sequence="44">ALAN DONAGAN incompatible properties of being intentional and of being unintentional. How can this appearance be removed? Many philosophers, including Oldenquist, follow G. E. M. Anscombe in holding that actions have certain properties, like being intentional, only under a description.80 Although Daniel Bennett has objected to this on the ground that "under the description .. ." is the formal mode descendant of such expressions as "qua ..." and "under its aspect as . . ." which "dot the history of philosophy with obscurity,"8' he has not produced a less obscure alternative. I share Bennett's qualms, but resign myself to Anscombe's device in the hope that it will not turn out to be too obscure to work with. On Anscombe's view, Jones's action is unintentional under the expanded description "startling Smith," but intentional under the less expanded description "opening the door" (cf. Oldenquist, II, ioib). We now have an answer to the question, "How, in the concept of action, is the idea of agency modified by intention ?"-namely, that an agent's causing something to have some property is an action only if what the agent did is, under some description, intentional.82 It is not controversial that an action is intentional only if there is an intention with which it was done. What is such an intention? Oldenquist reminds us of the recent revolt against the Cartesian orthodoxy that "actions are necessarily preceded by mental events called 'intentions"': the rebels arguing that, on the contrary, "inten- tional actions... [should] each [be] construed [as] actions which are explainable in certain kinds of ways" (II, Io3b). Of course, intelligent advocates of orthodoxy did not deny that an action might be simul- taneous with the intention with which it was done. The objection to recognizing "intending" as an event seems to have had two sources. First, because of an infinite regress remarked by Locke when he maintained that a man may be free to act, but never to will,83 intending cannot be an action (cf. Oldenquist, II, 97a-b). Intentions are not, under any description, intentional. Secondly, since a man holding fast to an intention is unquestionably in a dispositional state, it is tempting to identify his intending whatever he intends with being 80 G. E. M. Anscombe, Intention (2d ed.; Oxford, 1963), pp. 37-47. 81 Bennett, loc. cit., p. 87. Bennett's way out of the difficulty is to make purposiveness a modality of propositions held by the agent, and to define intentional action in terms of purposive action (ibid., pp. 94-95). 82 This answer was explored by Davidson at the Western Ontario Colloquium. 83 Essay concerning Human Understanding, II, chs. 21, 24-55. I26</page><page sequence="45">ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHILOSOPHY in that dispositional state (cf. Oldenquist, II, 98a-b; Aune, IV, x98b-i99a); and to conceive an intention as a "frame of mind," rather than as an occurrence. Yet this would be a mistake; and not only because, as Aune points out, intending is sometimes unquestionably occurrent, as when a man forms a resolution as an immediate consequence of deliberation (IV, 200b). A deeper error is revealed as soon as one tries to specify in what disposition to action a given intention consists. Let us suppose that the intention with which Jones opened the door was to see who was in the room. Was his intention a disposition to open the door? Not at all. He would have had no disposition to open it if he had believed that behind it was a second locked door to which he had no key. Since he intended to see who was in the room, his disposition to open the door was conditional upon his believing that by opening it he might see who was in the room. What of his belief? Virtually the same reasons as can be given in the cases of intentions can be given for holding that beliefs are dispositional (cf. Aune, VIII, ioib, I02b-103a; Anthony Quinton, "KNOWLEDGE AND BELIEF," IV, 345a-352b, esp. 35ia-b). Hence those who maintain that intentions are dispositional must by parity of reasoning identify Jones's belief with a disposition to open the door conditional upon his intention to see who was in the room. But so to analyze intending as conditional upon believing, and believing as conditional upon intending, generates a vicious infinite regress. At least one must be analyzed as not conditional upon the other; and, on any plausible analysis of the kind required, that one must be an occurrent event. Yet neither can be accepted as occurrent without repudiating the reasons upon which both were held to be merely dispositional.84 Even though intentions are occurrent mental events,85 they cannot be actions; for they are not, under any description, themselves inten- 84 The argument of this paragraph is heavily indebted to P. T. Geach, Mental Acts (London, 1957), PP. 4-I O. Although I fear they would not approve of the use I have made of their work, I have also drawn upon Alston, "MoTivms AND MOTIVATION," V, 403a-404b; Aune, "THINKING," VIII, 102b- I 03b; and Anthony Kenny, Action Emotion and Will (London, I 963), esp. chs. Io-I I. 85 It might be objected that even if forming an intention is an occurrent event, sticking to it is not. The question is, I think, complicated rather than difficult. Forming an intention must be distinguished from sticking to it, just as picking up a ball must be distinguished from holding it; but both are occurrent events. Also, having an intention must be distinguished from having it in the forefront of one's mind; but it does not follow that only the latter is occurrent. 127</page><page sequence="46">ALAN DONAGAN tional. They are nevertheless mental acts, in the sense of the act- content distinction examined in the preceding section (cf. Aune, IV, 200b). Is the relation between an act of intending and action causal? Or, in terms of our analysis, is it because acts of intending are, under certain circumstances, causes of actions, that if a man has an intention then he also has a conditional disposition to action? The sense of these questions will plainly vary according as different conceptions of causation are invoked. If agent causation is invoked, since acts of intending are certainly not agents, they are not causes of actions. But no argument hitherto considered shows agent causation to exclude the applicability of other concepts of causation. Is it possible that acts of intending are connected with actions by causal laws? Ten years ago, as Donnellan reminds us, this was widely held to be impossible, on the ground that, whereas causal laws are contingent, the connection between intending and doing is analytic (VII, 86b-87a). Donnellan tentatively, and Aune confidently, allow that the connection between intending to do A in C, and doing or trying to do A when you believe you are in C, is analytic (Donnellan, VII, 87a-b; Aune, IV, i99a, 200a; VIII, I02b). And this seems right. Does it follow that one cannot be the cause of the other? In a paper which transformed the state of the question,86 Donald Davidson pointed out that whether a statement that, if events of kinds F and G occur, then an event of kind H will occur, is analytic, depends on how those events are described; but that whether the statement is causal depends on what those events are. Suppose that in fact events of kind F are also of kind J, those of kind G are also of kind K, and those of kind H are also of kind L, and that there are causal laws according to which the occurrence of events of kinds 7 and K will be followed by the occurrence of an event of kind L. There will, in that case, be a causal connection between events of kinds F and G. on one hand, and events of kind H on the other, even though it may be that, under the descriptions "F," "G," and "H." it is analytic that the effect follows from the cause. Accordingly, if intentions were in fact identifiable with events describable in terms of wants or desires, considered as constructs of psychological theory (cf. Alston, "MOTIVES AND MOTIVATION," V, 405a-406b), or with events in the brain or central nervous system describable in terms of some neurophysiological theory; and if beliefs were similarly 86 Donald Davidson, "Actions, Reasons, and Causes," Journal of Philosophy, 6o (i963), 685-700. i28</page><page sequence="47">ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHILOSOPHY identifiable; then there might be causal connections between certain intentions and beliefs on one hand, and certain actions on the other: even though, described as intentions, beliefs, and actions, it is analytic that the latter follow the former. If acts of intending are in fact identifiable with certain theoretical events postulated by either psychology or neurophysiology, then Davidson has unquestionably shown that intentions may be causes of actions. In "Actions, Reasons, and Causes," Davidson treated intentions as complex "pro-attitudes," presumably analyzable in terms of such concepts as wanting and desiring. Donnellan follows him (cf. VII, 88a-b). If this were justified, the doctrine that reasons for acting are causes would be almost irresistible. For, as Davidson points out, an agent normally has pro-attitudes relevant to his action which nevertheless do not enter into its explanation: thus, he smokes even though he wants to avoid lung cancer, and believes smoking to cause it. How is the pro-attitude that enters into the explanation of his action, that he wanted to enjoy a certain pleasure, to be distinguished from other relevant pro-attitudes that do not? By far the most plausible answer would be Davidson's, that the pro-attitude by which an action is explained must be its cause. Yet this is implausible if action is analyzed in terms of agency, for then the concept of intention is sharply distinguished from those of pro-attitudes such as wanting and desiring. If an action-say, smoking a cigarette-is in the power of a rational agent, he has the power to perform it or not according to whatever reasons he adopts, whether to obtain a certain pleasure or to avoid a certain risk. Adopting a reason as a reason for acting is forming an intention, or deciding (Oldenquist), or resolving (Aune); and, given that the agent has power to smoke or not to smoke, his intention to obtain a certain pleasure or to avoid a certain risk, if he adheres to it, necessarily issues in smoking a cigarette, or refraining from doing so, when the appropriate belief conditions are satisfied (a cigarette is in reach; only by smoking it will I obtain that pleasure or incur that risk). Here intending is conceived, not as a complex pro-attitude, but as an exercise of the agent's power of action.87 There is no room for causal 87 "[T]he things which Hamlet says 'lose the name of Action' cannot be deeds, for the things he is talking about never culminate in deeds, so the name of deeds was a name they never had. They are decisions that come unstuck. When their author's mind was made up they had the name of action; but he has changed his mind; so they have lost it" (R. G. Collingwood, 129 9</page><page sequence="48">ALAN DONAGAN laws linking intending and the appropriate beliefs with doing. If causation is conceived according to the Principle of Uniformity, then on this view reason-explanations neither are nor presuppose causal explanations. In addition, it is highly implausible that acts of intending can be in fact identified with theoretical events postulated by either psychological or neurophysiological theory. The conclusions I have reached are closest to those of Aune (esp. IV, 200a-b; VIII, Io3b) and Richard Taylor (esp. II, 36ga-372a), although I have drawn more heavily upon Taylor's conception of agency than I suspect Aune would approve. Of all the theories of action described in the Encyclopedia those farthest removed from mine are the psycho- logical theories of motivation in terms of theoretical constructs such as wants, drives, and the like, which Alston lucidly dissects in "MOTIVES AND MOTIVATION." Alston himself is not committed to any particular theory. He briefly, but not unsympathetically, discusses "Wittgensteinian" analyses of motivation in terms of reasons, fairly commenting that the "Wittgensteinians" he mentions did not succeed in providing a non-causal analysis of what it is to do something for a reason (V, 4o8b). The view I have embraced would, according to Alston, disturb Wittgensteinians, because it construes motives in terms of mental processes (V, 4o8b). Anxieties on this score seem to me misplaced; and I believe that sometimes, at least, Wittgenstein himself rose above them. Donnellan and Oldenquist prefer to delineate the problems rather than to advance their own solutions (see esp. Donnellan, VII, 88b; Oldenquist, II, io4b). But there was no article in this group that I did not find rewarding. VII. PHILOSOPHY, THEOLOGY, AND RELIGION God and immortality are not central topics in contemporary metaphysics. Yet, since from Aristotle to Kant most metaphysicians not only have offered to prove the existence of a being which they identified with the deity worshipped in their society, but also have held that it would be unreasonable to worship that deity if such a proof could not be given, the educated public seeks to know what philosophers now think about such proofs. The Encyclopedia is com- The New Leviathan [Oxford, 1942], 13.89-13.9). Collingwood's (and Shakespeare's) terminology is not mine; but I think our views are here the same. 130</page><page sequence="49">ENCFCLOPEDIA OF PHILOSOPHY prehensive. The classical proofs are treated with kindly severity by: R. W. Hepburn, "COSMOLOGICAL ARGUMENT FOR THE EXISTENCE OF GOD" (II, 232a-237b); David Sanford, "DEGREES OF PERFECTION ARGUMENT FOR THE EXISTENCE OF GOD" (II, 324b-326b); John Hick, "ONTOLOGICAL ARGUMENT FOR THE EXISTENCE OF GOD" (V, 538b- 542b); W. P. Alston, "TELEOLOGICAL ARGUMENT FOR THE EXISTENCE OF GOD" (VIII, 84a-88a); and M. H. Carre, "PHYSICOTHEOLOGY" (VI, 300b-305a). None of these philosophers considers the argument about which he writes to hold water. For no apparent reason, the last two articles cited are not listed in the Index under "Theism." It may be doubted whether any man without philosophical educa- tion has ever been convinced by any of the classical proofs except the teleological. A valuable feature of the Encyclopedia is that it also discusses arguments by which educated but unphilosophical people are often persuaded. G. C. Nerlich examines a number of these, including some popular scientific fallacies, in "POPULAR ARGUMENTS FOR THE EXISTENCE OF GOD" (VI, 407b-41 ib), while the egregious Lecomte de NoUy, whose sophisms still misguide many a freshman, is annihilated by T. A. Goudge ("LECOMTE DE Noty, P. A.," IV, 41 7b-4I8b). Edwards himself tackles the topic "COMMON CONSENT ARGUMENTS FOR THE EXISTENCE OF GOD" (II, 147b-155b) and easily shows that all such arguments contain some false or doubtful premise. It is false that, even in the Western world, all men believe in a monotheistic god; nor is it established that all men seek God. The principal puzzle about such arguments is why honest and intelligent men have taken them seriously. Perhaps the explanation is that, in the Western world, most people have been taught from childhood a Jewish or Christian conception of the universe as divinely created and of man as having a supernatural destiny. While fewer and fewer deeply believe the religion in which they were reared, almost none accept any definite alternative to it. Cardinal Newman records that for years after the doctrine that the Pope was Antichrist had been "obliterated from [his] reason and judgement," his imagina- tion was "stained" by the effects of it.88 For good or ill, the imaginations of most of us are stained by the religion of our childhood. Few profess atheism, or doubt that inability to believe is an emotional loss. As traditional orthodoxy has lost ground, other religious traditions have gained it. Hence it is not surprising that people have become less interested in Judaeo-Christian natural theology, and more in 88J. H. Newman, Apologia pro Vita Sua (New York, 1956), p. 129. '3'</page><page sequence="50">ALAN DONAGAJN what is called "philosophy of religion." The nature of this subject is obscure. In "RELIGION" (VII, 140a-145b), W. P. Alston elucidates it as well as anybody can, and shows why complete clarity is unobtainable. The question "What is (the nature of) religion?" has no answer; for religion has no nature. The word "religion" is applied to a variety of complex human dispositions, whether of belief or of practice or of both, which have some or other of certain characteristics that may be called "religion-making." Alston lists nine such characteristics- namely: i. Belief in supernatural beings (gods). 2. A distinction between sacred and profane objects. 3. Ritual acts focused on sacred objects. 4. A moral code believed to be sanctioned by the gods. 5. Characteristically religious feelings (awe, sense of mystery, sense of guilt, adoration) which tend to be aroused in the presence of sacred objects and during the practice of ritual, and which are connected in idea with the gods. 6. Prayer and other forms of communication with gods. 7. A world view, or general picture of the world as a whole and the place of the individual therein. This picture contains some specification of an over-all purpose or point of the world and an indication of how the individual fits into it. 8. A more or less total organization of one's life based on the world view. 9. A social group bound together by the above [VII, '4ib-142a]. Between different religions, there need be no more than a Wittgensteinian family resemblance. It is true that contemporary world religions whose status as religions is indisputable may be classified according to the degree (if any) to which they are sacramental (characteristics I, 2, 3), prophetic (characteristics 4, 7), or mystical (characteristic 6). "Thus Buddhism and philosophical Hinduism are predominantly mystical; Judaism, Islam, and Confucianism are primarily prophetic; and popular Hinduism ... is primarily sacramental .... [A]lthough it is pre- dominantly a prophetic religion, as compared with Hinduism and Buddhism, with respect to its internal divisions the Catholic wing [of Christianity] ... tends more to the sacramental, while the Protestant is more purely prophetic, with mysticism appearing sporadically throughout" (VII, 144b-145b). Yet questions about doubtful cases-for example, "Is Communism a religion?"-can at best be dissolved. Once it has been determined what religion-making characteristics Communism has and what it has not, the only question remaining will be: are the respects in which Communism resembles other cases 132</page><page sequence="51">ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHILOSOPHr of religion more important than those in which it does not (VII, 143a) ? Since the sense of this question is irreducibly religious, it has no correct philosophical answer, but rather a number of religious ones, each correct or incorrect from the point of view of some religion. Philosophy of religion has therefore no unifying connection except that everything in it springs from the rational scrutiny of the claims of one religion or another (cf. Alston, "PHILOSOPHY OF RELIGION, PROBLEMS OF," VI, 285a-289a, esp. 285a). Every religion, however little prophetic, involves some claim about the nature of the world, and about man's place in it. Yet since there is no claim that is made by every religion, there are no "claims of religion" for philosophers to scrutinize, but only the competing claims of Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, Buddhism, Judaism, and so forth. In "PHILOSOPHY OF RELIGION, HISTORY OF" (VI, 276a-285b), H. D. Lewis recognizes this very imperfectly. After a section on Eastern traditions (one and a half pages), and a section on ancient Greek speculative theology (two pages), in both of which the misnamed problem of the one and the many is prominent,89 he offers us a survey of medieval and modern philosophical investigations into the claims of Christianity, with occasional references to Judaism (five pages). Cross-reference is made to "`JEWISH PHILOSOPHY" (IV, 26ib-277b, by Shlomo Pines) and to "ISLAMIC PHILOSOPHY" (IV, 2igb-224a, by Fazlur Rahman). Alston provides the required correction: while acknowledging that most philosophers have an eye to more than one religion, and therefore seldom dwell upon sectarian questions, he repeatedly insists that the religious claims philosophers investigate are necessarily those of a particular religion or religious teacher (cf. VI, 285b-286a, 287b). His ambiguous remark that "there is a common task underlying all the different approaches" (VI, 288a) is true only in the sense in which a common task underlies all the different approaches of householders in a street to making a garden: that they have the common task of each making a garden does not entail that all are making the same garden, or that the gardens they make are alike. Just as there are no claims of religion, but only the different claims of different religions, so there are no experiences that are recognized as 89 " Miscalled" because "the" problem is itself a many: different philosophers have different problems of the one and the many according to their principles. Heraclitus' problem, for example, was different from that of Parmenides; for he was not even aware of Parmenides' principle "that it is, and cannot not be" (cf. D. J. Furley, "PARMENIDES OF ELEA," VI, 47a-5I a, esp. 48a). 133</page><page sequence="52">ALAN DONAGAN religious by all religions. This is the source of most of R. W. Hepburn's difficulties in his valuable articles, "MYSTICISM, NATURE AND ASSESS- MENT OF" (V, 42ga-434b), and "RELIGIous EXPERIENCE, ARGUMENT FOR THE EXISTENCE OF GOD" (VII, i63b-i68b). One distinction, which seems to me fundamental, he does not sufficiently press: that between experiences which are only felt to have religious significance and experiences which really do have it. Hepburn recognizes as "certainly in an important sense religious" not only the experience of Prince Andrew, in Tolstoy's War and Peace when, lying wounded on the field of Austerlitz, it seemed to him that there is nothing but quiet and peace; but also that of Leonard Woolf when, at the age of eight, he felt cosmic despair at being powerless in a hostile universe (VII, i65a). Since they contradict each other, these reveries cannot both be true. Hence, even if Prince Andrew and Leonard Woolf each felt his experience to have disclosed some religious truth, what at least one of them felt must have been mistaken. It will be evident that an experience may lack religious significance even though its content is true. Supposing it is true that man is powerless in a hostile universe, and the thought that this is so fills me with despair as I am recovering from influenza, nobody is likely to ascribe religious significance to my experience.90 If an experience has religious significance its content does not merely happen to be true: it is true because of the cognitive character of the experience. In what follows, I shall call such experiences "revelatory." Natural as well as supernatural experiences have been alleged to be revelatory. By "natural experience" I mean one in which neither the mental acts involved, nor their contents, differ in intrinsic character from those of non-revelatory experiences. Hepburn's examples from Tolstoy and Leonard Woolf are of this kind: they are acts of thinking, and there is nothing in their content that is not found in speculations which nobody would consider revelatory. Even clearer examples may be found in biblical narratives of hearing "voices," as in the experiences of Samuel (i Samuel 3, 10-14) and of Elijah (i Kings i9, I3-i6). Literally interpreting those narratives, Samuel and Elijah both heard certain verbal utterances, the content of either of which might have occurred in such non-revelatory experiences as delusions 90 The fashion of ascribing religious significance to some of the experiences induced by drugs is odd. Malt does more than Milton can to justify God's ways to man; but malt-lovers have sensibly refrained from claiming that the experiences they get from it are religious. 134</page><page sequence="53">ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHILOSOPHr or hoaxes (for example, "I have sworn unto the house of Eli, that the iniquity of Eli's house shall not be purged with sacrifice nor offering for ever" and "Go, return on thy way to the wilderness of Damascus; and when thou comest, anoint Hazael to be king over Syria"). By Jews, Christians, and Moslems, although not by Hindus or Buddhists, these experiences are held to be revelatory; not because of their intrinsic character as experiences, but because God is believed to have brought it about that Samuel and Elijah heard what they did-presumably, though not necessarily, by miraculous means. The grounds for this latter belief are complex, and for the most part lie outside any experiences Samuel or Elijah may have had. It is convenient to label as "mystical" any experience that is seriously felt by whoever has it to be both supernatural and revelatory. This accords fairly well with Hepburn's view (V, 42ga-b). Since not all the revelations advanced on the ground of mystical experience are compatible, at least some mystical experiences are not revelatory. Non-revelatory mystical experiences are presumably either not supernatural or from the devil. Although I have no definition of "supernatural experience" (the Index entry "Supernatural" did not lead to one) it is evident that an experience would be supernatural if it satisfied the description of either of the two highest states of cognition recognized by Meister Eckhardt (see Ninian Smart, "ECKHARDT, MEISTER," II, 449b-45Ia, esp. 45oa), the higher of which is hard to distinguish from the beatific vision as conceived by Aquinas: a state in which, by the lumen gloriae, the divine essence is united with a human intellect as its intelligible species.9' I will not dispute that anybody who had such an experience would know that he had it. Yet he could not, by describing the content of his experience, provide evidence of its revelatory character to anybody who had not experienced something like it. To describe it in theoretical terms, for example, in the terminology of Eckhardt or Aquinas, would not convey its content as an experience. And to describe it by comparing it with natural experiences would do only if the hearer antecedently accepted that what was being described was supernatural. Since there are no other ways in which mystics can describe their experiences, it follows that no description of the content of a mystical experience which is intelligible to a non-mystic can justify the inference that that experience was revelatory. A conclusion Hepburn draws from the findings of depth psychology 91 Aquinas, Summa Contra Gentiles, III, 53, esp. 2, 5-6. '35</page><page sequence="54">ALAN DONAGAN would therefore seem to follow from the concept of religious experience itself. For non-mystics, at least, "There seems no way, at the experiential level, of settling the most urgent questions, most of all the following: Do we have in theistic experience mere projection?" (VII, i68a). The conclusion that religious truth is to be found neither by philosophy nor, for most of us, by experience, is borne out by the evidence scattered through the Encyclopedia about the speculations of individual philosophers, a formidable number of whom have taken it upon themselves to add to the religious knowledge of mankind. In ancient Greece and Rome this was intelligible. The polytheistic cults then popular propounded no coherent systems of belief; and the teachings of individual philosophers were for the most part cautious: witness Plato and Aristotle, the Stoics and the Epicureans. Even so, what Plato tells us of the life and death of Socrates appears to me to be important for religion in a way in which his theological speculations in the Republic, the Timaeus, and the Laws are not.92 While a few systems of philosophical theology-for example, Spinoza's and Plotinus'-command respect, even they differ in degree rather than in kind from the lucubrations of good and intelligent men like Alexander (D. M. Emmett, "ALEXANDER, S.," I, 69b-73a, esp. 7Ia), McTaggart (J. B. Schneewind, "McTAGGART,J. M. E.," V, 229b-23Ia, esp. 23ob-23 Ia), and Whitehead (D. M. Emmett, "WHITEHEAD, A. N.," VIII, 29ob-296b, esp. 295a-b). To explore the theological ramifications of philosophical ideas is of course admirable; yet how did it escape these excellent men that their systems are too idiosyncratic to be credible? They are, in Newman's damning phrase, "paper religions," having no more bearing on man's religious life than coterie utopias have on his political life. Even Spinoza resorted to dubious subsidiary assumptions in drawing his system from its fundamental principles (for example, in Ethics I, 28, he shows that if there are finite existents, they have causal determinants that are also finite; but he cannot show, on his principles, that there are finite existents); and no philosophical theologian I know of is more rigorous than Spinoza. To any man in agony at intimations that he was not made for the vanity and evil of his life, Isaiah and the Buddha, Mohammed and 92 Although he does not, like Ryle, largely discount Plato's Dialogues as evidence of the historical Socrates (cf. VI, 3I5b-3I 7b), I. G. Kidd ("SOCRATES," VII, 480a-486a) declares that "He was no mystic" (VII, 482b). However, unless the evidence of such passages as Apology 3id be dismissed, A. E. Taylor's conclusion that Socrates "really possessed the temperament of the 'visionary' " is irresistible (cf. Socrates [Boston, I952], p. 45. 136</page><page sequence="55">ENCYCLOPEDIA OF PHILOSOPHr St. Paul have something to say. Philosophers with paper religions do not. Many of them, indeed, are greater than their systems. Thus Spinoza was a profound moralist and, like Leibniz, became petty only when he offered to demonstrate that, even when a man does evil, everything in the universe is as it must be and ought to be.93 To ridicule the benevolent complacency of more recent systems is as easy as it would be cheap. Kant stands out among the theistic philosophers of the last two centuries in part because of what he did not claim to establish (cf. Walsh, IV, 3i6b-317a, 322a-b). The founders of the great world religions did not offer to prove them: they professed to speak with authority, whether of God or, like the Buddha, of their own experience. Nor have their followers accepted their teachings because of proofs. The credibility of particular religions is not much explored in the Encyclopedia: perhaps the best thing on it is Paul Edwards' "ATHEISM" (I, I74a-I8gb). According to Edwards, an atheist confronted with the "anthropomorphic" theism of Judaism, Christianity, or Islam will ... question the intelligibility of anthropomorphic theology insofar as God is here said to be a purely spiritual unity. If and insofar as belief in an infinite anthropomorphic God is intelligible, he will maintain that it is shown to be false by the existence of evil [I, i85b]. This seems right. It would suffice most believers that their faith be consistent with what they know or reasonably believe. The existence of evil is a fact which it is difficult, if not impossible, to reconcile with the major theistic religions. For my own part, I might accept the partial Christian solution of the problem of evil (cf. John Hick, "EVIL, THE PROBLEM OF," III, I36a-I4ia, esp. I36b-I39a), if I were not persuaded both by Catholic arguments that an organized Church endowed with a supernatural magisterium is necessary to safeguard the deposit of faith, and by Protestant arguments that no ecclesiastical organization in fact possesses such a magisterium. Although I do not share his taste for Bertrand Russell's atheist rhetoric ("in the end the fresh air brings vigor, and the great spaces have a splendor of their own"; "ATHEISM," I, i88b), Edwards has no difficulty in showing that the lives of atheists as a class are no worse, in any observable respect, than those of theists as a class (cf. I, I 74a-b, 93 My views on this point are given no support either by L. J. Russell, "LEIBNIZ," IV, 43i b, or by Alasdair MacIntyre, "SPINOZA," VII, 533a, 540a-b. I37</page><page sequence="56">ALAN DONAGAN i87a-i88b). Nor any better. Edwards rightly draws attention to the malice and cruelty of organized theism toward unbelief (I, I 74a-I 75a); but when it has attained power, organized atheism has exhibited the same vices. A conviction of the absolute value of the life of every rational being is possible to theist and atheist alike. Perhaps the ultimate difference between an atheist and a theist who share that conviction is this. To an atheist, no problem about this life can be solved in any life beyond it. To a theist, when we shall have come to ... the day of the Lord, we shall then recognize the justice of all God's judgments .... And in that day we shall also recognize with what justice so many, or almost all, the just judgments of God in the present life defy the scrutiny of human sense or insight [St. Augustine, De Civi- tate Dei, XX, 2]. Atheists do not find this life an enigma: their problem is to disabuse mankind of the sense that it is. 94* ALAN DONAGAN University of Illinois 94 Compare Wittgenstein, Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus, 6.43X-6.5, and Malcolm, VIII, 333b. * I desire to thank Professor John P.
