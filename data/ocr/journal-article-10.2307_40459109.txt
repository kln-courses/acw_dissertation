With 157 Fig. Wash- ington 1974. Dumbarton Oaks. Trustees for Harvard University. Price: $ 3.50. Spindle whorls act as balance wheels to steady the whirling motion of the spinner. Whorls are made of wood, drilled pottery sherds, tortoise shells, bone, stone, rock and raw or sun-dried clay forms. Spindle whorl shapes vary but many are discs or discoidal forms. Johannes Wilbert and artist Helga Adibì present a study of ceramic spindle whorls from coastal Ecuador made in Guangala (500 B. C.-500 A. D.) and in Manteño (500 A. D. to time of the Conquest) cultures and discuss the symbolism in their incised and excised designs of birds, animals, fish and geometric patterns. These miniature, round, beadlike pottery whorls are 10-14 mm. high and were decorated before kiln firing. J. Wilbert identifies the spindle whorl designers as Guangala and Manteño peoples who fished and farmed the Ecuadorian Guayas coast and identifies the Guangala as producers of the pelican and snake designed spindle whorls. The archaeology of these whorls has not been worked out. This reviewer's experience suggests that the whorls presented in this book primarily represent the Manteño culture. The more adventure- some immigrant Manteño prowled the ocean in large rafts holding up to twenty men and accumulated jade and copper attesting to their long distance trading skills. Their lifestyle may have inspired their unusual whorl designs. While discussing design, Wilbert explores possible Mesoamerican and Asiatic contacts with Ecuadorian coastal peoples, discusses function and shapes of spindle whorls and the two techniques of spinning, the Bororó and Bacairi. While the Bororó spinner holds the spindle horizontally while sitting on the ground, the Bacairi spinner attaches the fiber to the upper end of the spindle which is held vertically and often walks while spinning. Turning from the technological, Wilbert introduces us to the myths and magic associated with the "thread of life". For instance, when articles were manufactured to be used in sorcery, yarn was spun to the left (S-twist) in hopes of visiting harm, sickness and death on an enemy. Just as the spinning and weaving process has a beginning and end, so does life. In the spinning process the full spindle is seen as a mandorla - the symbol of dualism and inversion - culminating in a combination of matter and spirit or earth and heaven. Just as the spinning process culminates in the weaving of an article and a finished product, so in the life cycle birth culminates in death. Based on this philos- ophy, individual spindle whorl designs are analyzed and correlated with world cultural mythology. Specific spindle whorl designs have been interpreted with the help of consultant zoologists and ornithologists. Careful discussion and wide-ranging speculation are pre- sented for birds and bird symbols, the opossum, fishes, reptiles (snake and lizard), frogs, toads and slugs, and anthropomorphic and zoomorphic representations of what appears to be an "Earth Mother " figure. Birds are the most commonly represented design. Forty different bird or bird- symbol whorls are presented as rollout drawings. Pelicans and owls are clearly seen, with another common bird being interpreted as the pachota. In relation to the life and death cycle, bird-wing designs supposedly symbolize spirituality, enlightenment and sublimation.</page><page sequence="2">Bibliographia 331 The most frequently depicted and beautifully incised animal representation is the jaguar. It is symbolically linked with earth, fertility, night and moon, the Otherworld and more indirectly with the Sun. The jaguar represents the Shaman. The opossum is described as symbolic of life and fecundity. They are seen as resembling man because their hind legs are shaped like the human hand and they are omnivorous. Fish, the symbol of fertility, are depicted swimming up and down, to the right and to the left, showing scales, fins, gills, vertebras, and other details, even dead and decaying fish. All of the other spindle whorl designs are analyzed in similar detail. Interpretative difficulties are shown by two rollout drawings of serpents on page 92. This reviewer believes the more accurate presentation would be to turn the serpents upside down. In this way, the serpent's face appears humanoid and the tail points upward ("the rattle-snake's tail always points up"). The overall presentation is thoughtful, provocative and intellectually consistent. Were these beadlike ceramic artifacts just spindle whorls? The artistic skill used in their design seems to belie a utilitarian product. His theory regarding the symbolic role of the spindle whorl and other paraphernalia of weaving is tenable. In the section entitled, "Head Portrait of Death - The Owl", Wilbert interpreted a specific spindle whorl design as "disembodied heads" to fit his theories oí life and death. He states, "In many cases these heads are unquestionably owls, in others they resemble human skulls." Prior to reading Thread of Life, this reviewer examined dozens of these incised human-life spindle whorls, never "seeing" them as skulls. After reading Wilbert, these spindle whorls still don't look like skulls. These incised faces are round or oval and resemble the "It's a Happy Day" symbol. These incised-face spindle whorls are the only zoomorphic representation of a head without a body and may very well have a different meaning. The bibliography is excellent. Although it includes the 1907 report of Marshall Saville, the bibliography omits the 1910 volume of equal importance. The quality of the artistic rollout presentations of these spindle whorls earns high praise. Wilbert's provocative thinking and correlations with other mythologies forces thoughtful reflection. The Thread of Life presents a somewhat romantic interpretation of belief systems of a pre-Columbian South American culture based on a specific art form. Wilbert's thesis is based on his intuition after carefully examining thousands of spindle whorls and then searching his own thoughts and world literature for meaning. Much of the evidence used is presented by analogy. This is a fascinating route to follow to add to our understanding of pre-historic man and his belief systems. Harold B. Haley</page></plain_text>
