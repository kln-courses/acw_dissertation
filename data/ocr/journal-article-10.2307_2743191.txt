<plain_text><page sequence="1">On Art for Art's Sake in the Paleolithic DENIS DUTTON School of Fine Arts, University of Canterbury, Christchurch, New Zealand. 12 IX 86 Halverson's (CA 28:63-71) bold and refreshing approach to the "miracle" of the Upper Paleolithic is a most wel- come departure in an area of scholarship heavily bur- dened by the received speculations of earlier thinkers, speculations which have too often been taken as fact. It is perhaps unfortunate that Halverson chooses Schiller (through Cassirer) as the inspiration for his posi- tion. The real early exponent of the view of art expressed in his article is Aristotle, who opens his Poetics with the straightforward and quite stunning thesis that art is es- sentially imitation or representation (mimesis): "Imita- tion is natural to man from childhood, one of his advan- tages over the lower animals being this, that he is the most imitative creature in the world, and learns first by imitation. And it is natural for all to delight in works of imitation" (1941:742). With regard to this last point, Aristotle even provides an argument: that we can de- light in pictures, sculpture, and literary descriptions of disgusting objects-such as snakes or dead bodies- which might repel us in real life shows that it is the representation itself we enjoy, often more than the thing represented. It is thus Aristotle, rather than the English aestheticists or German idealists, who provides the his- torical precedent for Halverson's "representation for rep- resentation's sake." For Aristotle, the natural inclination to enjoy repre- sentations-which would explain such diverse phenom- ena as children's fascination with models and dollhouses and the adult love of pictures of all kinds, moving and still-is explanatory bedrock. Representation is not seen by him as a function or by-product of religious impulses, love of power, or magical tendencies. The only specula- tion Aristotle allows himself in this connection is his suggestion that the basic human love of representations is related to the love of learning. Perhaps so, and possibly even some didactic purpose was thus implicated with the art of the Upper Paleolithic; but I think that such a speculation is no more confirmable than the notion that Paleolithic cave art has an essentially religious-mythi- cal-metaphysical reference. Given Halverson's liberation from the paradigms which have so hypnotized previous thinkers in this field, I was disappointed that he should try to interpret the</page><page sequence="2">204 1 CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY cave paintings as the "free play of signifiers." I don't believe the Paleolithic artists were deconstructionists before their time, even if many of them did live in France. But of course, Halverson goes on to explain that by "free play" he simply means that the cave representa- tions of the Upper Paleolithic may well have been pro- duced with no ulterior mythic or social significance, simply for the delight in representation itself. In this sense, Halverson's talk of "signifiers" here is confusing and misleading, for, as he recognizes, what is most strik- ing about these images is that on the face of it they are precisely not stylized symbols or signifiers but highly realistic, naturalistic representations. They are more es- sentially pictorial than linguistic. And as Halverson so well puts it (in what is unintentionally almost a para- phrase of Aristotle), for their explanation they require only "a natural pleasure evoked both in the making and the recognition of realistic images." Finally, a query: If sheer delight in representation it- self is to stand as the best available explanation of the miracle of Paleolithic art, what are we to say of its con- tent? Halverson makes much of failure of the Paleolithic artists to place their images in intelligible large composi- tions, and I agree that this is a provocative question. But even if we grant Levi-Strauss's dictum that "animals are good to think," what most intrigues me is the relative absence of realistic human forms, especially the human face, in this art. The cave artists may have much in common with artistic traditions of the last 4,000 years, but they diverge on this one point: the focus of European art since the archaic Greeks has always been to a significant extent on the human form and, in particular, on the face. The geniuses of the Paleolithic had, it would seem, an ability to produce realistic representations of human beings. Why weren't they interested in doing so? V. B.

Academy of Sciences, Vorovsky is-a, Moscow 12I069, U.S.S.R. 29 Ix 86 Halverson's article seems to me to contain nothing new (even if we assume that what is novel about it is merely something obsolete). The concepts of Schiller, Verwom, and Luquet have not been forgotten; they still hold wa- ter as to the genesis of artistic representation. The ele- ment of play here appears obvious. The play (spontane- ous play, including the play of imagination) that gives rise to a fortuitous occurrence precedes not only art but every innovation in culture in general. What we know of the ecological characteristics of the Franco-Cantabrian region in the Paleolithic, i.e., the local fauna, the occur- rence of caves, pigments, and clay, as well as developed handicrafts and pastimes leads to the conclusion that artistic representation is the sum total of a variety of factors. Certainly the question arises what in the situa- tion was the equivalent of Newton's notorious apple. It k nisite -nrnhleh thlat as uiiniipt and 1a-lverqnn hnld. the hunter's imagination was stirred into activity by images created by Nature itself. On the other hand, it might just as well have been stirred by foot or hand imprints in clay, claw marks on the walls of a bear's den, the coating of skulls with clay (reconstruction), etc. One may safely concede that there is more than one answer to this ques- tion, which, as I see it, is of secondary importance. Though Halverson links the concept "art for art's sake" mainly with the genesis problem, he should be more accurate in drawing a line between the genesis and the functions of representative art. The distinction is evident once we see that representation, having come into existence as a result of individual casual play, is adopted only after it has become a collective tradition- has, so to speak, become play according to rules. It is this quality that makes it a unique means of accumulation and distribution of information, the nucleus from which issues the whole of culture. Also of some importance is the question whether it is correct to draw a parallel be- tween Paleolithic art and the traditional art of Bushmen, Australians, et al. I believe that such comparison is warranted insofar as both are the products of hunter- gatherers. The distinction between naturalistic (physio- plastic) and symbolic (ideoplastic) is evidence of the ini- tial and final stages of evolution of primitive art. The evolution (for instance, the appearance of anthropomor- phic images) is a corollary to the process of further struc- turing and differentiation of human consciousness (animal -* zooanthropomorphic totemic images [masks] nonindividualised anthropomorphic images [ancestor statues] -* personified images of chiefs). Reply JOHN HALVERSON 2715 Fresno St., Santa Cruz, Calif. 95062, U.S.A. 22 XI 86 I had in fact thought of mentioning Aristotle on in- nateness but decided that his authority was not likely to cut any ice and neither would his argument (since people are fascinated by real snakes and corpses as much as by their representations). The references to Schiller and Cassirer are in the context of play and consciousness, a connection not made by Aristotle so far as I know. Semiotic terminology is unfortunately very unsettled, but I take it that images as well as arbitrary signs can fairly be called signifiers, since both evoke the absent referent, though in different media. The idea of a free play of visual signifiers seems to me readily understand- able; the free play of linguistic signifiers seems largely confined to Derndian prose and is not so readily under- standable. It might be well to distinguish "natural signs," such as foot and hand prints, claw marks, and the like, from iconic signs. Traces and images, as we may call them, must "stir the imagination" in very different ways.</page><page sequence="3">Volume 28, Number 2, April I987 205 Traces are not far removed from "signals," that is, they imply some sort of action-pursuit, flight, exploration, etc.; they are alerting signs. The image, on the other hand, has no signal value: it incites no expectations, no anxiety, no action. The observer has nothing to do but observe-and perhaps reflect. Hunters would have been quite used to natural signs; images would have been new and remarkable, eliciting a recognition of distinctively human powers, for the image points not only to a re- ferent but also to a maker. In the case of hoofprints these are one and the same, but in the case of the image they are different. The awareness that images were man- made could have provided an impetus towards collective self-consciousness. Why the interest in animals and not people and espe- cially faces? This is a hard question and not altogether legitimate, for the representation of human forms not only began very early but endured in substantial quan- tity throughout the Upper Paleolithic. Faces too, though rare, are by no means unknown. Yet it is true that most representations of the human form are faceless, often indeed headless and in the case of engraved vulvas even bodiless. This suggests that they are generalized objects largely in the category "human female" and as such are exactly analogous to categorical representations of ani- mals. Both human and animal representations, appar- ently lacking any individuating features, seem to reflect a species or category interest. It follows that representa- tion began with the general rather than the concrete. This conclusion is consistent with the notion that Paleolithic depiction is to be correlated with mental de- velopment, for the human mind becomes mind in its grasp of the general, or more precisely, in its conscious recognition of category (as distinct from mere responses of sensory-motor schemata, which are themselves, of course, graspings of the general at a lower cognitive level). Psychologically, the interest in faces is too partic- ular to be readily generalized, especially as a category of objects of desire like "animal" and "female." Reference Cited ARISTOTLE. I94I.
