<plain_text><page sequence="1">Timaeus 41 A In a note of his Commentary on Plato's Timaeus (Oxford 1928), A. E. Taylor says that "the evidence of Augustine and Chalcidius together is less valuable in a textual matter thar that of Cicero alone." Cer- tainlv Cicero's restoration of the essential p74 to the phrase EjUoi ye ,U71 0,EAOVTrS (4i A), rendered by him 'me invito,' results in an interpretation far supenror to that of Chalcidius's 'me ita volente.' How then does one account for what is surely an erroneous rendering of the controversial 0,Eo't 0Erv as Haec vos, qui deorum satu orti estis, attendite? The most recent interpretations of Eo't 0,Eov range from Taylor (who considers the text corrupt and ac- cepts Badham's emendation of &amp;r&lt;twv for OE,k)v Jov) to Archer-Hind (London i888), Bury (Loeb ed. I929), Shorey (Chicago 1933) and Prins (Antwerp I939) who consider the phrase pure rhetoric in the Biblical tradition. Cornford (New York I939) emulates some of the earlier commentators in trying to eliminate the difficulty by placing a comma after Eo t'. The objection to an analogy between aEoit oeiv an(l such phrases as KaKaL KaK6V, appvpT' app?ToV, on the ground that the latter are adjectival and poetic seems scarcely well founded. The one quality that to the lay mind separated gods from men was the immortality of the former, an immortality contingent upon the will of the 8&amp;ytoypyos' in the Timaeus. Cicero (De Finibus 2.3.40) speaks of man as a 'mortalem deum' on the analogy, as Reid suggests in his note, of Heraclitus who used the terms aiavaTot alv6pwrot and 0Eo' 0VqTro to illustrate his theory of opposites in the case of human beings. Since the 8[uovpyo's is enlisting the aid of the visible created gods, not of the anthropomorphic deities of the cosmogonies towards whom Plato (or Timaeus) has just directed the full force of his irony-I agree, however, with Cornford (I39) that the irony is not directed against the religious beliefs of the common man-the phrase OE)ot 0EGv may be considered the equivalent of a'OavaToL aMavaTOv, in which aOavaTOI must be the visible created gods or heavenly bodies, and aOaVaTWV must be all immortal beings, including those visible and those whose manifestation is, to put it mildly, unpredictable. Taylor seems quite justified in rejecting Cicero's</page><page sequence="2">CLASSICAL WEEKLY 245 translation, which is more interpretation than transla- tion. The clause 'qui deorum satu orti estis' has a stateliness which approximates the quality if not the idea of the original. Stolz-Schmalz5 (390) point out that the 8Za Ocacwv type of expression (Iliad 6.305) had its counterparts in early Latin, though it seems to me that such expressions as 'multo mulier melior mulierum' (Ennius Fr. 56 V) and 'regum rex regalior' (Plautus. Captivi 825) are rather examples of bombastic allitera- tion than of anything else. However, despite the phrase 'divom deo' in early Latin (Carmen Saliare frg. Varro, Lingua Latina 7.27), it seems clear that the rex regum type of expression was due to an oriental influence. Hence, Cicero's translation of Eco't OE9v may have been due to the fact that he found the Greek unnatural and supplied EK7OVO0 to make it plausible or to the fact that he rejected the Greek because he found its Latin equiv- alent archaic or oriental.
