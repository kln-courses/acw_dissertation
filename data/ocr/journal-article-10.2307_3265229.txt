Michael J. Cook Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion, Cincinnati, OH 45220 Two Powers in Heaven: Early Rabbinic Reports about Christianity and Gnosticism, by Alan F. Segal. SJLA 25. Leiden: Brill, 1977. Pp. xxiv+313. HFL 92. The author's goal in this revised Yale dissertation (1975, supervised by N. A. Dahl and J. Goldin) is "to collect [collate] and examine the rabbinic reports about the [two powers] heresy . . .and to identify the proponents of the heresy" among the possible candidates in the ancient world (p. 3). "Two powers in heaven" is an early Jewish "heresy" opposed by the rabbis. Its basic premise, as identified by Segal, was "interpreting scripture to say that a principal angelic or hypostatic manifestation in heaven was equivalent to God" (p. x). The rabbinic reports have been the subject of earlier studies, but a new examination of material is warranted, Segal argues, on the basis of the inadequacy of the earlier studies, the development of new method- ologies, specifically form criticism, and the availability to scholarship of new infor- mation. The book is divided into three parts. Part 1 is an introduction to the problem including a brief history of research on the "two powers in heaven" controversy. Part 2 consists of the collection, collation, and analysis of the rabbinic evidence for the "two powers in heaven" heresy from the tannaitic and amoraic periods. The rabbis' description of their opponents is far from clear, and understanding the development of the rabbinic argument will not be easy for the nonspecialist. Segal's analysis of the material, however, helps to clarify the frequently abstruse rabbinic arguments. The author acknowledges that the dating of the rabbinic reports is a difficult problem. Although the earliest rabbinic materials date from the second century C.E., Segal believes that he can trace the "two powers" controversy into the first century C.E., based on an analysis of the extrarabbinic evidence in the light of the rabbinic materials. The similarity of language and common biblical proof-text tradition among the two blocks of material and the correspondence of certain first century C.E. traditions to the brief descriptions of the heretics by the rabbis allow the earlier dating of the controversy. Part 3 is a discussion of the extrarabbinic evidence for the "two powers" controversy. In this section, Segal considers evidence from Philo, Jewish sectarian texts (among which he includes the NT texts!), the Church Fathers, Marcion, and gnosticism. Segal does not show any concrete historical connections between the rabbis and their "opponents," as represented by the nonrabbinic materials; he does, however, establish a plausible context for the "two powers" controversy, involving rabbinic Judaism, Christianity, and radical gnosticism, that may reasonably be dated into the first century C.E. Two results of his study have implications for the origins of christology and gnosticism. With respect to christology, Segal argues that his study of the interaction between early Christianity and rabbinic Judaism makes it possible to see the development of christology in early Christianity emerging out of biblical exegesis within the parameters of the "two powers" debate: "It is not necessary to postulate a pre-Christian 'son of man' redeemer figure with which Jesus was identified. The</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 639 character of the rabbinic debate makes it possible to see christology build through exegesis rather than through hypothetical preexistent titles. Christians believing in his translation to heaven could have applied to Jesus a number of passages describing either God's principal angel or some other divine but anthropomorphic manifestation . . " (p. xi). Segal's suggestion that the development of christology was stimulated by the "two powers" debate between the rabbis and Jewish/Christian sectarians is reason- able and should be discussed, but to regard it as the context for the origin of christology to the exclusion of other influences is uncertain. In this connection, Segal goes too far when he suggests that it was Christianity that "first put together the complete myth of the redeemed redeemer who descended to earth to save his followers" (p. 219). One basis for this latter suggestion appears to be that Segal's research into the "two powers" controversy has shown that Christianity was opposed as a heresy by the rabbis earlier than radical gnosticism. He distinguishes between Christian oppo- nents of the rabbis and their gnostic opponents based on whether or not the sectarians in the rabbinic reports believed in two complementary powers in heaven or two opposing powers in heaven (p. x). Clearly, he argues, belief in two opposing powers implies radical gnosticism. His results show that the earliest heretics believed in two complementary powers in heaven, and only later could the rabbinic opponents be shown to believe in two opposing powers. Hence, he concludes that radical gnosticism is a post-Christian phenomenon: "The radicalism of gnosticism was a product of the battle between the rabbis, the Christians, and various other 'two powers' sectarians .. ." (p. 265). It "arose in Judaism out of the polarization of the Jewish community over the issue of the status of God's primary angel" (p. 266). The scenario for the origin of radical gnosticism that Segal has constructed will have to be tested against the Nag Hammadi corpus, where one does find gnostic texts that seem to fall more into a Neoplatonic tradition than a Jewish/Christian one. One weakness of Segal's scenario is that it does not make allowance for the fact that the rabbis would probably not have engaged in debate groups with radical gnostic features that expressed their faith apart from reliance on Jewish Scriptures, such as may be represented by the Trimorphic Protennoia (XIII, 1) and the Discourse on the Eighth and Ninth (VI, 6). As Segal himself notes (p. 4), such engagement would only have further contributed to the spread of the heresy. Hence, his post-Christian origin for radical gnosticism may simply reflect the later influence of non-Jewish/Christian gnosticism on the synagogue and the church. A major weakness of Segal's study is that it does not make more use of the Nag Hammadi library, which is undoubtedly one of the more significant blocks of "new information" that has recently become available to scholarship since the "two powers" heresy was last studied. Segal's study provides valuable information to the student of gnostic and Christian origins by reconstructing and analyzing the rabbinic side of the exegetical debate that clearly involved all three groups. The value of his explanation for the origins of christology and gnosticism will only emerge in the context of scholarly debate. Unfortunately, the most valuable part of his study, the analysis of the rabbinic reports, is slow reading, and the reader will be distracted throughout the book by proofreader's errors and unclear turns of expression.
