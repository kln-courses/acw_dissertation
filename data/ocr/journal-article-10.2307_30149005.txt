Dye and Camille Wharey, catalog refer- ences, index to text. $50.00.) The Southeastern Ceremonial Complex, or Southern Cult, does not refer to a pattern of antebellum ritual, nor to a fervid ethnocentric movement. It is, rather, an assemblage of striking and exotic motifs and artifacts found at prehistoric (and perhaps early historic) archaeological sites in the southeastern United States that, because of mortuary contexts at large mound cen- ters, is assumed to be socioreligious in nature. The associated artifacts of embossed copper, engraved shell, stone, and pottery are decorated with distinctive motifs includ- ing the winged rattlesnake, eye-in-hand, the "weeping eye," and anthropomorphic and man-animal representations. Major sites include Spiro in Oklahoma, Moundville in Alabama, and Etowah in Georgia. Closer to home, the mounds at Lake Jackson near Tallahassee and Mount Royal on the St. Johns River have yielded important Southern Cult materials. The papers that comprise this volume were presented at a conference at the Cottonlandia Museum in Greenwood, Missis- sippi, in 1984, and are concerned with definitions of the com- plex or cult, the geographic span and regional manifestations of it, and interpretations of its meaning in terms of culture history and cultural dynamics. Although the basic concept is over one- half century old, the lack of consensus among the participating specialists on the material content of the cult, its spatial and temporal limits, and its significance indicates a still-viable arena of study. Although none of the seventeen chapters is devoted to an overall appraisal of the Southern Cult in Florida, two chapters do deal with specific areas of the state, and there are passing references to Florida sites and artifacts in several of the interpre- tive chapters. Noel Stowe discusses evidence of the Complex as seen in the Pensacola variant of the Mississippian cultural tradition, found along the Gulf coast from Choctawhatchee Bay into Mississippi and up the lower Alabama and Tombigbee rivers. In this area,</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 97 most of the Cult symbols are found as decorations on pottery types that continue into historic times, as evidenced by post-De- Soto sixteenth-century Spanish coins found in association. Randolph Widmer discusses certain south Florida artifact types, including well-known ones from Key Marco, that have long been considered as related to the Southeastern Ceremonial Complex. He argues that the motifs derive from an earlier wide- spread base and from later and continuing interaction of peoples and cultures over the Southeast, but that the actual cere- monial integration differs markedly between non-agricultural south Florida and the agricultural Mississippian areas, including Apalachee. However, the similar sociocultural level, that of the chiefdom, accounts for similarities in the patterning of religion between the areas. At the conference itself the papers were, in a sense, a mere verbal accompaniment to the unprecedented exhibit of over 350 Southern Cult artifacts amassed on loan from a number of museums and private collections. It is a matter of disappoint- ment, then, to find that the 150 photographs in the exhibition catalog approximate commemorative postage stamps in size, but not in quality, and are often distressingly murky. Aside from this, the volume is well designed, edited, printed, and bound, and illustrations in the main text are excellent. The enduring value of the book lies in the recording of the currently varied views of this archaeological conundrum. St. Augustine, Florida JOHN W. GRIFFIN</page></plain_text>
