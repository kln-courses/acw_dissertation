<plain_text><page sequence="1">Toward Grounding Peirce's Semiotics in a Homological Architectonic ROBERT E. CHUMBLEY I. Introduction What I believe may be helpful to construct from C. S. Peirce's work is rather simple, perhaps even simple-minded: 1) the triadic nature of the sign is not arbitrary and depends upon a complex of homologous relations represented by Peirce in equally trichotomous manner; 2) this complex tissue of thought is not merely a function of "triadomany" (triadmania), but rather of the innate structure of the universe as Peirce perceived it; 3) this innate structure is rep- resented in a realist-organic architectonic which Peirce never explicitly con- structed, but toward which all his thinking tends. Rulon Wells notes that Peirce's work "is not a mere heap of ideas from which one can deftly pick out some [themes] while leaving the others quite behind. His concept of sign involves interpretant . . his concept of interpretant involves mind; his concept of mind is generalized (to include 'quasi-mind') beyond recognition along panpsychistic lines dictated by his synechistic idealism. His pragmatism and his anti-Car- tesianism must be mentioned in the same breath."' W. B. Gallie agrees that this organic unity is important, but notices as well that its expression is incom- plete: "The greatness of Peirce ... lies rather in the organic unity of his think- ing, a unity which has been obscured by his own failure to present his teach- ing during his lifetime in a unified literary form, but partly also by the fact that he sought to test out his central doctrines on a wide variety of clearly defined issues."2 While Murray Murphey senses organic unity to have been a motivation present from the beginning,3 William Rosensohn points out that the term "archi- tectonic" makes its first appearance in 1891 in the Monist article "Architecture of Theories."4 What follows is an effort not just to tie in semiotics with other aspects of Peirce's philosophy, a task well fulfilled by already available texts,5 but to suggest the relational density of the semiotic. Indeed, reading the Collected Papers is an adventure in itself.6 Quite often triads seem a function of sheer triadomany; some suggest a unique expression, and others are genuinely homologous tri- SubStance No 44/45, 1984 106</page><page sequence="2">Peirce's Semiotics 107 chotomies - systemic in nature. But while we shall focus on the systemic, we must remember that many of the papers are not rigorously reviewed pieces, that their looseness quite often reflects "musement" (VI.461) tending toward an unreached final expression. Nonetheless, there are many extraordinary homologies across these pages of personal musement, articles, and corres- pondence. The homologies which we shall discuss are those which suggest what might be called a semiotic Weltanschauung, or, at least, a necessary propedeutic to one of the things Peirce loved so much in Kant: the architectonic and organic construction of systems.7 It may well be helpful to rehearse some of the most important and pervasive influences on his thought before entering Peirce's own constructions. Duns Scotus, the scholastic realist, contributes to Peirce an abiding belief that generals (universals) actually exist, are real, and are not merely mental sorting devices - as nominalism would have it. This stand of radical realism is, in fact, for Peirce the beginning of scientific pursuit: the discovery of imma- nent regularities or "universals." How does one conduct this scientific inquiry? Here Peirce turns mainly to Kant, as previously cited, for the architectonic construction of systems and organic models as opposed to aggregates and classes, the business of nomi- nalists. The organic model suggests the discovery of laws of a system and laws of growth. The latter notion of organic modeling was to inform Romantic think- ing across the nineteenth century, to find its fullest expression in the theories of evolution. In fact, Peirce discusses the three main theories of evolution, now agreeing with one, now with another, ultimately discovering a new type, based on his reading of Lamarck, but always firmly convinced that evolution was a construction which discovered actual generals at work in the universe. Our minimal catalogue should also include the fact that Peirce credits Kant with having first remarked the frequency of trichotomies in logical analysis (1.369). Moreover, Kant's categorial analysis, amending Aristotle's, affords a marked influence on Peirce in his reduction and construction of a minimal tri- chotomy of categories. Peirce is generally, on another front, rather hard on Hegel as a logician, but he does admit a certain resemblance, as we shall see, between the phenomenological (phaneroscopic) categories and the three moments of dialectic. With a preference for evolution, it is not surprising to find the presence of two "isms." First, if all evolves in nature, Peirce assumes that laws evolve as well (VI.91). This leads him to an enduring doctrine offallibilism (I.173). Second, the very evolutionary process itself is seen as matter developing from mind. This continuity between mind and matter, monism, is also a continuing characteristic of Peirce's thought. Of course, the ultimate sanction, if not origin, of the triadicity that Peirce will find in so many domains, and of the "realist" stance as well, can be found in the great mysteries of Christian faith: the Trinity and the Eucharist. While it would here be inappropriate to discuss the mysteries of religious faith, it is important to realize just how extensive was Peirce's conception of triadicity.8 Finally, it may be helpful to mention several idiosyncrasies of Peirce's</page><page sequence="3">108 Robert E. Chumbley thought. First, there is the already noted propensity to think by threes. Second, triadic thinking is done in terms of mediation rather than in terms of conflict. As we shall see, the concepts of community and cooperation are continuous themes. Third, he prefers to think in diagrams (sometimes "existential graphs"). This visual bias may well have led him to the uniqueness of the triad, for it is in graphs and geometry that the triad becomes minimal, while in "non-visual" arithmetic, counting systems can be reduced to the binary. Hopefully the placing of some of his meditations in further musement will reveal some of the density of triadic semiotics. II. Categories &lt;= &gt; Signs In searching out those homologous triads which should help us to see semiotics at work, we begin with a loop between the categories in "phaneros- copy," Peirce's term for phenomenology, and the concept of a sign.9 Peirce's "phaneron," or all that is present to consciousness, is broader than continental phenomenologies, which do not include imagination, dreams, fiction, etc.10 The bias of monistic continuity between mind and matter is present in this refusal to distinguish between objects of thought and objects of sensate (sential) experience, all being objects of consciousness. Whatever the nature of the object, there is a reductive description, a minimal yet suffi- cient system for the description of what is before consciousness. Joseph Esposito cites Peirce in showing that his "early metaphysical system [was] built on three fundamental forms of relation which he called I, It and Thou" suggesting the famous distinctions made by Martin Buber. I" As "objects" present themselves to consciousness, they may be viewed as "monads," "dyads," and "triads" (1.293). But why stop there? Peirce sees that all structural groups of higher number are reducible to triads (I.347) by geometric or graphical means.12 This is a signal intuition. It supersedes the mysterious reductive tetrad of Pythagorus and opens on an even more potent numerical model: % (3). Again it is important to underscore the visual nature of Peirce's thinking and the geometric or graphi- cal nature of his intuition. Moreover, the implied triumph of the triadic over the binary in dimensional contexts may be seen today in some of the geodesic constructions d la Buckminster Fuller. Triadic is not, however, synonymous with triangular! It may mean simply three things grouped in different ways. And while structural reduction to triadicity is clear, the actual triadic distinc- tions - Firstness, Secondness, Thirdness - are not as self-evident, although they are rooted in Aristotle's and Kant's more numerous categories. Early on Peirce follows a vision of the categories quite similar to Hegel's dialectical moments. 13 This perspective, however, becomes altered by his concept of evolution. We shall look at this in more detail in a moment, but it is important at the outset of our search for homologies to be aware of these two related but distinct approaches to the categories. Now we should remember that phaneroscopy or phenomenology deals with appearance, with consciousness, and not with things in themselves. The cate-</page><page sequence="4">Peirce's Semiotics 109 gories are, then, psychological in origin (perhaps "pr'gnance" plays a major role) and have to do with perception and cognition. We cannot move any closer to an initial point of departure than to stand back and look at ourselves look- ing at things (unless to continue in an infinite regress). In that first abstractive stance, Peirce seizes on the organizing categories. Firstness remains pretty much the same throughout as potentiality, pure chance - a quality or accident in consciousness as distinct from its embodiment or substance, "quality" and "accident" being taken here in their philosophical sense: "I may call its form Firstness, Orience, or Originality. It would be some- thing which is what it is without reference to anything else" (11.85). "First is the con- ception of being or existing independent of anything else" (VI.32). Indeed one may say something qualitatively about what is before the mind without imputing its existence in a particular case. It is most probably via this doorway that the imaginary and fictive entered Peirce's phenomenology. As for Secondness, if the Hegelian route is taken, it becomes reaction and struggle, the site of rivalry between chance and continuity. On the other hand, in the stance of evolution, Secondness is still actuality, but viewed as matter and as such the site of law. Peirce begins to think in terms of Secondness as a site of growth and change, where even the laws governing matter are under- going evolution. Law was originally associated with Thirdness (1.536), but later came to be treated like a living form (VI.33). Thirdness never loses its original function of mediation or representation, but the type of mediation becomes evolutionary, and the most frequent later terminology is "taking of habits" (VI.33). To underscore the difference in the two versions of the categories, we may place two of the clearest formulations side by side: Hegelian: quality/ reaction/ mediation (IV.4) Evolutionary: variety/ uniformity/ passage into uniformity (VI.97) In both cases, Thirdness may be viewed as mediating between potentiality and fixed actuality, but by different modes. In a slightly different formulation, the categories become: quality/ reaction/ representation (V.66). This view of Thirdness as mediation becomes overtly semiotic and defines mediation (whether dialectical or evolutionary) as a signi- fying practice. Indeed phaneroscopy and semiotics are symbiotic, because each is obviously a precondition for the other. For a signifying practice to occur, differentiation over the phaneron is required, and yet to achieve this differen- tiation a signifying function of representation must be equally operative. We might say that in Peirce's universe there seems to be a common structure to the observer and the observed. In fact, the phaneron can be considered as a multi-semiotic differential which by Thirdness becomes possible as thought. Thirdness is always semiotic because it treats re-presented, predictable, and, therefore, recognizable regularities: "As in metaphysics information is the con- nection between form and matter, so in logic [semiotic] it may appropriately mean the measure of prediction" (II.418). Semiotic information or representa- tion is precisely attribution of forms to matter. Only Thirdness carries with</page><page sequence="5">110 Robert E. Chumbley it the possibility of representation, recognition, replication. These concepts are absolutely necessary for a sign. Charles Morris notes the richness of the aspect of Thirdness: Peirce is impressed with the close relation of the concepts of symbol, thought, habit, law, generality and continuity, indeed so impressed that they are used interchangeably, and they are all brought together to form the category of Third- ness. Call Thirdness by the name of mind and regard it as directing the actuali- zation of possibility, and the result is Peirce's objective idealism.14 In this semiotic aspect of the phaneron, Peirce sees that the structure of the sign is homologous to the categories: A sign, or representamen, is something which stands to somebody for something in some respect or capacity. It addresses somebody, that is, creates in the mind of that person an equivalent sign, or perhaps a more developed sign. . . . That sign which it creates I call the interpretant of the first sign. The sign stands for something, its object. It stands for that object, not in all respects, but in refer- ence to a sort of idea which I have sometimes called the ground of the representamen. (11.228) The "ground" may be understood as the object's capacity itself to be a sign at a given moment for a given speaker. As in any phenomenology, what is known about an object never exhausts the potential of the object itself. 15 There is a great deal of discussion as to the nature and function of the "object." A. J. Ayer finds "the obscurity of his notion of the object of a sign" the greatest obstacle in his theory of signs,'6 but he suggests a remedy. "The third, and, to my mind, the most promising course would be to dispense altogether with the object as an element in the analysis of the meaning of a sign and make the sign's being understood to stand for something entirely the matter of the character of its interpretants and of the relations that obtain between them" (Ayer, pp. 162- 163). Douglas Greenlee, too, thinks that an object is not always necessary for a sign and flatly refuses the triadicity of signification in favor of a dyadic model.17 Roman Jakobson also speaks of dyads rather than triads in Peirce's work on signs.' 8 To ignore the pertinence of the "object," however, with respect to the tripartite sign (ground, representamen, interpretant) to which it refers is to abandon the modeling of the sign as the activity of phenomenology in its dis- covery of the potential signification of objects or concepts. The ground also shares in this potential with respect to its object (because it changes with phenomenological activity) and, as such, is correctly considered Firstness. The representamen as existent-matter is Secondness, and the inter- pretant, mediation by tendency to take a habit, is literally the re-presentation or Thirdness function. It is easy to see that, in effect, it is by the semiotic triad (ground, representamen, interpretant) that access to the phaneron is obtained, while at the same time the posited structure of the phaneron informs the semiotic activity- is congruent with it. The structure of the sign is then homologous to that of the categories. Moreover, J. J. Fitzgerald remarks that the categories and three types of signs (icon, index, symbol) are mutually reinforcing.'9 In</page><page sequence="6">Peirce's Semiotics 111 a different vein, Philip Wiener feels that "there is a close correlation between each mode of evolution (Darwin's, Cuvier's, and Lamarck's) and each of Peirce's three categories: chance, brute existence and continuity."20 While both these observations deal with the extension and richness of the categories, Murray Murphey notes the intentional nature of the 1885 formulation: "Peirce intro- duced his revised list of categories in 1885 in a paper entitled 'One, Two, Three: Fundamental Categories of Thought and Nature' (cf. 1.369-372, 1.376-378, III.359-403, and VIII.39-54). Instead of deriving the categories from the analysis of the sign relation as he had done in the 'New List' Peirce presents them directly as three sorts of logical relations" (Murphey, p. 303). Yet another important aspect of the categories is raised in a problematical fashion by Gallie with respect to the relationship between categories and pragmatism: "Broadly, Pragmatism tells us that a statement has a meaning . . . if and only if some distinctive consequences of an experiential character can be deduced from it. Quite evidently, however, if Peirce's categories are universal in the sense he intends, no distinctive consequence can ever result from the assertion that they apply to this or that actual or conceivable state of affairs. This all pervasive- ness inevitably spells their vacuity" (Gallie, p. 204). This is not a terribly helpful criticism, for while the categories are ubiquitous, Peirce is always careful to speak of different combinations thereof in copresence. Moreover, there is a complex notion of categorical function. Rosensohn has remarked that "one of the chief difficulties with Peirce's philosophy, as it is formulated, is that each element-Iness, IIness and IIIness-may be treated on the ontological level as separate modes of reality while, in experience, the categories are always taken to be interdependent and universally present" (Rosensohn, p. 97). Isabel Stearns also subscribes to the double function of the sign as intermediate between form and matter: "Since the categories are not only immanent within the process, but are also treated as limiting concepts in the light of which it may be inter- preted, each of them must function in a material and formal way."21 Pushing even further this relationship between mind and world, Peirce concludes that there must be some similarity between the structure of the mind and the struc- ture of the universe to account for the better than chance results in the forma- tion of hypotheses which is the hallmark of man's development.22 This seems most clearly true of the homology between phaneroscopy and semiotic. Moreover, the triadic structure of both gives rise to three branches of semiotic: The first is called by Duns Scotus grammatica speculativa. We may term it pure grammar. It has for its task to ascertain what must be true of the representamen used by every scientific intelligence in order that they may embody any meaning. The second is logic proper. It is the science of what is quasi-necessarily true of the representamina of any scientific intelligence in order that they may hold good of any object, that is, may be true. Or say, logic proper is the formal science of the conditions of truth of representations. The third, in imitation of Kant's conceptions, I call pure rhetoric. Its task is to ascertain the laws by which in every scientific intelligence one sign gives birth to another, and especially one thought brings forth another. (II.229)</page><page sequence="7">112 Robert E. Chumbley While a single person may exercise the semiotic sketched above, it is important to note that Peirce is writing for a semiotic community, "for the uni- verse must be understood to be familiar to the speaker and the hearer, or no communication about it would take place between them.. ." (11.357; cf. 11.536). This common experience does not, however, necessarily breed mechani- cal interpretants: "No communication of one person to another can be entirely definite, i.e. non vague . .. no man's interpretation of words is based on the same experience as any other man's" (V.357). As we shall see, this stance does not lead, as one might expect, to the crisis of "signification." In another context, that of monism, Peirce sees continuity not only of mind and matter in general (VII.570), but a continuity among minds as well. His doctrine of "synechism," or continuity, finds its initial step in the assumption of a shared site of thought. In a formulation which anticipates structuralist sys- temics of the LUvi-Strauss or Foucault variety, Peirce writes: "Accordingly, just as we say that a body is in motion and not that motion is in a body, we ought to say that we are in thought and not that thoughts are in us" (V.289, p. 173 n. 1). Yet another statement of this participation in Mind is more radical. The normal barriers of self are viewed as a delusion because of synechistic con- tinuity: Nor must any synechist say, "I am altogether myself, and not at all you." If you embrace synechism, you must abjure this metaphysics of wickedness. In the first place your neighbors are yourself, and in far greater measure than, without deep studies in psychology, you would believe. Really, the selfhood you like to attribute to yourself is, for the most part, the vulgarest delusion of vanity. . ... (VII.571) In fact, the notion of community, of immersion in various cooperative sys- tems, as, for example, in the community of seekers of truth, is one of the rarely signaled, yet important, elements of his semiotic: It may seem strange that I should put forward three sentiments, namely, interest in an indefinite community, recognition of the possibility of this interest being made supreme, and hope in the ultimate continuance of intellectual activity, as indispensable requirements of logic. . . . It interests me to notice that these three sentiments seem to be pretty much the same as that famous trio of Charity, Faith and Hope, which, in the estimation of St. Paul, are the finest and greatest spiritual gifts." (II.655) It is the community, for Peirce, which ultimately decides what is reality (V.316), as opposed to "the individual man since his separate existence is manifested only by ignorance and error" (V.317). This ethical, scientific, and social concept of community also has an impor- tant semiotic dimension. Aside from Peirce's notion of literal continuity between psychic and physical phenomena, we may all be seen to be in a "sea of signs" synonymous with a "sea of thought," all thought being in signs and all signs being in thought (II.220). In short, man himself becomes, in community, a sign: "When we think, we, ourselves, as we are at that moment, appear as a</page><page sequence="8">Peirce's Semiotics 113 sign" (V.283; cf. V.313 for man and word as signs and VII.583 for man as symbol). The key word here is the phaneroscopic "appear" which suggests the world of forms rather than of matter or objects. This distinction will become clearer shortly, but it is quite similar to that between ground and object in the sign. It is not, therefore, surprising to see Peirce define man as the set of forms which he conveys or rather signifies by signs: It is sufficient to say that there is no element whatever of man's conscious- ness which has not something corresponding to it in the word; and the reason is obvious. It is that the word or sign which the man uses is the man himself... Thus my language is the sum total of myself, for the man is the thought. (V.314) The word "man" must here be read as a sign, not necessarily as an "object" or existent, that which is always beyond congruency with the ground. In this way Peirce's intuition reduces to "one signifies all the thoughts (signs) which one can say or signify." The tautological nature of the assertion is saved only by a systemic function which in any situation will put a set of practical limita- tions on any practice of thought whether private or communal. The nature of this sort of limitation (which is parallel to diachronic limitations on synchronic systems) anticipates the "pragmatic maxim" which we shall discuss further on. Important, however, to note at this point, in returning to community, is the shared nature of language and other sign systems: In every proposition the circumstances of its enunciation show that it refers to some collection of individuals or of possibilities which cannot be adequately described, but can only be indicated as something familiar to both speaker and auditor. At one time it may be the physical universe, at another it may be the "imaginary world" of some play or novel, at another a range of possibilities. (11.536) Elsewhere this commonality is compared to a fulcrum: But as Archimedes said he could do that [move the world] with his lever if he had a roi'~vr, a where to stand, so I am obliged to remember that no man can communicate the smallest item of information to his brother-man unless they have a oVirPwv of common familiar knowledge, where the word familiar refers less to how well the object is known than to the manner of knowing. (MSS Item 614, p. 1) The last sentence is particularly helpful; it implies that one must share with another the forms (manner of knowing) to be mediated by signs. An object may be "well known" by two or more sets of radically different forms. Communica- tion comes out of a cooperative modeling of experience via shared, derived, or mediated forms. The community shares not only (a) language(s), but a com- mon experience and assent.23 This pointing (taken in a broader sense than the precise term "index") is just that- pointing toward, but not completely mapping, the referenced object. This indication of meaning via community activity (building the ground of an object) should not be confused with what Peirce sees as the "physiological compulsion" of the object to call forth, or be called</page><page sequence="9">114 Robert E. Chumbley forth by, a representamen. Just how ground and object interact is a function of semiosis. Rather than Descartes's pineal gland, which would arbitrate between inner and outer worlds, Peirce advances the sign as intermediate and as having the power actually to turn a user toward the sign's object: What the sign virtually has to do in order to indicate its object - and to make it its- all it has to do is to seize its interpreter's eyes and forcibly turn them upon the object meant. . . . It is pure physiological compulsion, nothing else. (V.554) This automatic compulsion to reference is in sharp contradistinction to the rela- tion between ground and object, and it is the latter relation which leads Peirce by another path to a radical scholastic realist stance: "There must be some- thing more in reality than mere representation; . . . a sign cannot have a sign as its sole object, though it may refer to an object through a sign" (MSS Item 7). If ground and object are not congruent, it is because the sign is always between matter and form: "By the action of a sign, matter becomes determined to a Form; and we infer that wherever Matter becomes determined to a Form it is through a sign" (MSS Item 4, DM 49). Elsewhere we see that a sign has its being in producing that union of form and matter (MSS Item 4, DM 50), and he is quick to add that it is the power to produce the union of form and matter, not the act of bringing it about, that is the sign's nature (MSS Item 1, DM 51). This is an important distinction, because it reminds us of the poten- tial nonvolitional generation of interpretants. It is precisely the triadic relation form/matter/sign which is homologously mirrored in the definition of semiosis: But by "semiosis" I mean on the contrary [to brute dynamical action of pairs] an action, or influence which is, or involves, co-operation of three subjects, such as a sign its object and its interpretant, this tri-relative influence not being in any way resolvable into action between pairs. (MSS Item 316, p. Prag 49) In the same text, "semiotic" is defined as "the doctrine of the essential nature and fundamental varieties of semiosis" (MSS Item 316, p. Prag 58). Semiotics is the study of the activity of semiosis, an activity which is measured in terms of "proper significate effects" (V.475). This action of semiosis is no mere figure of speech: "The sign has its essential significant character, which is the char- acter of causing the interpretation of its object" (MSS Item 4, DM 41). This systemic causality is present also in Peirce's theory of two objects: . we have to distinguish the Immediate Object which is the Object as the Sign itself represents it, and whose Being is thus dependent upon the Repre- sentation of it in the sign, from the Dynamical Object which is the Reality which by some means contrives to determine the Sign to its Representation. (IV.536) The immediate object may here be viewed as the ground which is a community activity, whereas the dynamical object represents a "physiological compulsion" toward interpretation, or, as stated earlier, a referencing or calling forth of</page><page sequence="10">Peirce's Semiotics 115 a representamen (interpretant) without conscious effort. This is as well a modeling of prignance. Now there is clearly a homology between form/matter/sign and ground/rep- resentamen/interpretant - homology both in the nature of the terms and in the activity called semiosis. Moreover, the triad form/matter/sign is helpful in understanding some of Peirce's meditations on the triadic nature of the sign. Signs have the property, says Peirce, of referring only to other signs (1.538). Moreover, anything can be a sign (IV.531) if it enters into the relation of stand- ing to someone for something, or more precisely: A sign is anything which is related to a second thing, its Object, in respect to a Quality, in such a way as to bring a third thing, its Interpretant into relation with the same Object, and that in such a way as to bring a Fourth into relation to that Object in the same form, ad infinitum. (11.92) This significant aspect of the "Object," here "Quality," is what has been referred to as "ground," but with a clear reference to phaneroscopic Firstness. There is a marked difference between Saussure's "signifi" and the ground of the object. The object is the residue beyond what "real" forms are perceived as present in it, hence the ground is not just a concept (a nominalist stance), but that which is active in matter. Also, Saussure's "signifi" does not distin- guish between variations in ground and interpretant, the interpretant often exceeding simple sign/word values, becoming, as we shall see, effects in the behavior of the person addressed. Disengaging "dyads" instead of "triads" radi- cally distorts the function of mediative activity in the Peircean sign (as we just saw in MSS Item 316, p. Prag 49). Yet another definition of the sign distinguishes between "sign" as a familiar conveyor of sense and "representamen" as the token replica or analytical nature of the sign (1.540): A REPRESENTAMEN is a subject for a triadic relation to a second called its OBJECT, for a third called its interpretant this triadic relation being such that the REPRESENTAMEN determines its interpretant to stand in the same triadic relation to the same object for some interpretant; . . . the relation must therefore consist in a power of the representamen to determine some interpretant to being a representamen of the same object. (I.541, 542) The representamen has the power to point toward the object via the ground of that object, whether in actuality it does or not. Just as the object had the power to call forth a representamen, so the representamen has the power to call forth interpretants. This is important, because it once again implies a non- volitional use function of the sign. The sign itself has the power to unleash interpretants. But it is not just a question of a signifier soliciting a fixed signified. The interpretant mediates between representamen and ground/object, just as we might say that the representamen is between the potentiality of its object- ground and the actuality of a given momentary production of interpretants. As we shall see, the problem of the interpretant is a complex one. The defini-</page><page sequence="11">116 Robert E. Chumbley tion above would give the impression that the interpretant is merely another signified or set of signifieds which arise in the mind of the interpreter upon the use of a given sign. That this is not entirely the case begins early on to be evident. The sign's "power" and multiple nature for the interpretant com- plicate the situation. Indeed, the interpretant suggests itself, in its turn, as triadic in the type of effect the original sign has upon the receiver: ". . . that which the sign produces, in the Quasi-mind, that is, the interpreter by determining the latter to a feeling, to an exertion, or to a Sign which is the interpretant" (IV. 536). These three basic types of interpretants are homologous to Firstness (quality), Secondness (actuality-existence), and Thirdness (taking of habit-rep- resentation) and are defined as follows: ... in the first place the Immediate Interpretant as it is revealed in the right understanding of the sign itself, and is ordinarily called the meaning of the sign; while in the second place, we have to take note of the Dynamical Interpretant which is the actual effect which the sign as a Sign really determines. Finally there is what I provisionally term the Final Interpretant, which refers to the manner in which the Sign tends to represent itself to be related to the Object. I confess that my own conception of this third interpretant is not quite free from mist. (IV.536) While Peirce seems reasonably immune to the problem of "signification," for reasons we shall see, he does open a most important polysemic doorway. Even if the Immediate Interpretant might find congruency with the ground of the original sign, there is more activity here than a meshing of concepts. The notion of the Dynamical Interpretant adds the power of the sign to unleash interpretants beyond volition, but it also lays the groundwork for, or is at least another pathway to, his pragmatism. It is the generality of interpretants as "proper significate effects" (cited supra) which, beyond simple meaning, take sign and semiosis back into the phaneron where Peirce will distill the prag- matic maxim. The force of the effective interpretant can be felt even in this single- interpretant description: "Consequently, the most perfect account of a concept that words can convey will consist in a description of the habit which that con- cept is calculated to produce" (V.475). (Habit is "by no means exclusively a mental fact" [V.492]; moreover, habit is precisely the passage between inner and outer world [cf. V.493].) Aside from the sense and behavioral interpretants, there is a third kind of interpretant which he calls "misty" in IV.536.24 The final interpretant has to do with the way the sign is related to the object and will be more clearly pre- sented in the nature of a familiar and homologous triad of signs (icon, index, symbol [1.369]) built precisely on the relation of representamen and object. The multiplicity of these interpretants and their simultaneous presence places in question the general arbitrariness of the sign in its function. The arbitrary is only one of several possible relations of a sign to its object. Peirce did not develop this, but the line of implications is clear from the nature of the three interpretants.</page><page sequence="12">Peirce's Semiotics 117 Not only does the concept of the interpretant branch out, the interpretant itself can take interpretants. The sign can bring an infinite number of inter- pretants into relation with the same object (11.92). This again is a positive power of the sign for Peirce, and it does not suggest the dire problem of signification for which, in continental literature from the period, there seem to be no con- trols. In fact, Peirce espouses a purely scholastic view of signification concern- ing only universal or general terms, posing a category but no threat. Making clear his notion of this concept to Lady Welby, he quotes John of Salisbury: " 'Nominantur singularia, sed uniuersalia significantur,' cited from Metalogicus II, xx ed. of 1620" (cf. VIII.379). Moreover, the seemingly infinite chain of generated interpretants is not truly infinite. According to Peirce, this chain of signs must lead ultimately to an interpretant outside this generation of "logical interpretants" referring mediately via representation one to the other. This ulti- mate interpretant he calls a "habit-change" (V.476). He even wonders if there is a limiting state which may be approached, yet not necessarily attained (V.609). The absolute nature of this ultimate interpretant (absolute at least until that habit is changed) is stated elsewhere in more familiar terms as a leap from speculation and argument to a final recognition of truth: "The 'Truth,' the fact that is not abstracted but complete, is the ultimate interpretant of every sign" (MSS Item 517, p. 16). Peirce recognizes that because everyone's experi- ence is different, interpretants produced from those different experiences will be different (see supra). But unlike the problem of signification, these differ- ences are not viewed as essentially problematic in the communicative circuit. This is certainly true if we inquire as to the power of the sign, aside from voli- tional considerations, to operate, thus creating variations between ground and interpretants of differing degree rather than differing kind. But even were they of differing kind, the active mediative function of the power-full interpretant would set limits not present in dyadic models of signification. That power of the interpretant is held in control by the reality of ground and representamen. Again triadicity has shown its function. Just as any sign has three parts based on the categories, there are three trichotomies of signs depending upon which of the three categories is applied to one of the three elements of the sign. Yet again a mutual influence and control is visible between the sign and the categorial study of its object. The categories and triadicity of signs are each, we remember, the basis of the other: Signs are divisible by three trichotomies: first, according as the sign itself is a mere quality, is an actual existent or is a general law; secondly according as the relation of the sign to its object consists in the sign's having some char- acter in itself, or in some existential relation to that object, or in its relation to an interpretant; thirdly according as its Interpretant represents it as a sign of possibility, or as a sign of fact or as a sign of reason. (II.243) The trichotomies suggested are: qualisign/ sinsign/ legisign; icon/ index/ symbol; rheme/ dicisign/ argument (elsewhere term/ proposition/ argument) (II.243-253). These give birth combinatorially to ten classes of signs (see II.254ff), but this suddenly nominalist classification clashes with the deriva-</page><page sequence="13">118 Robert E. Chumbley tion of the trichotomies and may be partially responsible for the little attention paid the classes. Even more seemingly contrived are the new (10) trichotomies with 66 classes developed in the Welby correspondence. They have not had much critical favor, for they too have lost the necessity and simplicity (although combinatorially drawn) of triadic activity. Essentially in the papers on semiotics, Peirce gives us a phenomenological description of certain types of signs, but generally from a realist standpoint. And yet the theory of semiosis or production of interpretants is what he means by pragmatism, as we shall see in the next section. If the function of conscious- ness is representation (1.532), and if triadic meaning is inexpressible by dyadic terms (I.345), then consciousness is the locus of constant exchange, and par- ticularly the site of the recognition and production of interpretants. The tendency to produce chains of interpretants is physiologically and psychologically verifiable. Normally this production is governed; but ask any sufferer from paranoia, for instance, about the hell of the interpretant mecha- nism unleashed. Indeed, there are many other less chaotic cases where incor- rect interpretant production needs attention, where incorrect balance of the three interpretants is in instance. To a certain extent the history of rhetorical figures is a collective meditation on the problem (i.e., conventions of interpre- tant production). And even before Jakobson, Peirce suggests resemblance and contiguity as prime figural axes of experience (IV.87), contiguity being the nature of the outer world of experience, resemblance being the nature of the inner world of thought. Not only do interpretants generate others in terms of similarity (or mistaken similarity), but consciousness carries simultaneously three different types of activity, albeit in different combinations at different moments. It is not surprising that the three types of interpretants coincide with Kant's three segments of mind: feeling/ willing/ knowing. It is in examining again the three interpretants that we are brought to the conceptual neatness of pragmatism. At any given moment a person may have an automatic emotive reaction, a reaction such as a punch in the nose and a reflective consideration of the logical or general principles involved in the communicative act of whatever nature. The focus of all three activities is in the recognition of interpretants or production of meaning. But what is responsible for keeping the "proper" balance of interpretants in a given situation? It is a careful attention to the significate effects of an experience (potential or actual). The Ockham's razor of pragmatism will shave away all significate effects not having practical con- sequences (actually or potentially). Certainly the term "practical effects" is very broad, while the sense of pragmatism is quite narrow - in fact, Peirce after inventing "pragmatism" changed the name to "pragmaticism" to underscore that he was not developing a philosophical framework, but rather a necessary mechanism in semiotic/logic (see V.18, where it is a question of a maxim of logic, not a "sublime principle of speculative philosophy"). Nonetheless, con- trol over the "balance of interpretants" is more an ideal than a practical con- ception. It is more mental habits than analytical urgency which convey an image of semic equilibrium, and those habits in their turn are the result of originary</page><page sequence="14">Peirce's Semiotics 119 semic "prignance." An exact general appreciation of voluntary semic equilibrium is difficult to conceive. III. Pragmatism In the last section, we saw that there is a problem even in conceptualizing the production of meaning and recognition of varied interpretants. Where does volition function? We remember that the unleashing of interpretants, accord- ing to Peirce, is automatic. If, in each instance, it is not the function of con- sciousness to choose critically its interpretants - to limit the chain of interpre- tants - in an architectonic system, logically the place to look for help is either the next higher stage of generality or the next lower constitutive stage. Logic/semiotic (Thirdness) is built on but requires ethics (Secondness), which is built on but requires aesthetics (Firstness) (V.35-36). This is yet another homology with the categories, but an important one both for the structure of the architectonic and for perceiving the ultimate limit of semiotic/logic in itself. Charles Morris remarks that "[Peirce's] formulation of the 'pragmatic maxim' is a later product of the lifelong work in semiotic" (Morris, p. 18). J. J. Fitz- gerald, quoting Peirce in a 1904 letter to Christine Ladd Franklin, points out the following conceptual association: "Pragmatism is one of the results of my study of the formal laws of signs, a study guided by mathematics and the familiar fact of everyday experience and by no other science whatsoever" (Fitzgerald, p. 10). Elsewhere Fitzgerald indicates that the precise point in the theory of signs which leads to the pragmatic principle is Peirce's notion of an ultimate inter- pretant that is viewed as a habit (Fitzgerald, pp. 71, 163). "In this doctrine on interpretants we have at hand the proximate basis of pragmatism as the theory of signs . . we should look to the consequences or effects for the mean- ing of the sign" (Fitzgerald, p. 90). Commenting on this same process, Zeman states that "the interpreter will have formed the habit of acting in a given way whenever he may desire a given kind of result. The real and living logical conclusion is that habit; the verbal formulation merely expresses it. . . . The deliberately formed, self-analyzing habit - self-analyzing because formed by the aid of analysis of the exercises that nourished it - the living definition, the veritable and final logical inter- pretant (V.491)" (Zeman, pp. 33-34). The earlier discussion of Peirce's definition (cf. V.476) shows that the ultimate interpretant is not "logical," but outside the series of logical interpretants. In order for the interpretant selection and/or recognition to operate in par- ticular, that process must be informed from the outside by an ethical dimen- sion, one of whose options is the pragmatic principle. There are several rea- sons why this perspective was attractive to Peirce. First, it is an application to the domain of thought of the principles of how change is effective or ineffec- tive in evolution. Second, the maxim functions, as we shall see, as if it were an Ockham's razor, and even though Peirce considered himself a realist in the</page><page sequence="15">120 Robert E. Chumbley Duns Scotus tradition, the razor-like function of the maxim's formulation is salient. Third, it was very much in harmony with positivism in its early con- ceptualization, for Peirce agrees with Auguste Comte "that a theory cannot be sound unless susceptible of applications, immediate or remote, whether it be good economy so to apply it or not" (11.7). Moreover, it was his opinion "that metaphysics is to be largely cleared up by the application of the following maxim for attaining clearness of apprehension: 'Consider what effects, that might conceivably have practical bearings, we conceive the object of our con- ceptions to have, then our conception of these effects is the whole of our con- ception of the object' " (V.2). Just as the phaneroscopy included everything present to the mind, so the maxim occurs over all mental maps of that domain, actual or imaginary. Even though Peirce is careful to dissociate the maxim of signs from the investigation of things, there is the reminder here of the dis- tinction between ground and object of the sign: Pragmatism does not intend to define the phenomenal equivalents of words and general ideas, but, on the contrary, eliminates their sential element, and endeavors to define the rational purport, and this it finds in the purposive bearing of the word or proposition in question. (V.428) This curious delineation and delimitation of pragmatism will continue, even as William James and others expand its application. Peirce refuses to accept generalization, even to the point of changing the name of the maxim and its import to pragmaticism: According to that logical doctrine which the present writer first formulated in 1873 and named Pragmatism, the true meaning of any product of the intellect lies in whatever unitary determination it would impart to practical conduct under any and every conceivable circumstance, supposing such conduct to be guided by reflexion carried to an ultimate limit. (VI.490) Having restated the original semiotic use of the maxim, he continues to so delimit its function under a new name: "Pragmaticism, then, is a theory of logical analysis or true definition; and its merits are greatest in its application to the highest metaphysical conceptions" (VI.490). As popular versions of pragmatism were beginning to spread, we find Peirce's stance adamant: Suffice it to say once more that pragmatism is, in itself, no doctrine of meta- physics, no attempt to determine any truth of things. It is merely a method of ascertaining the meanings of hard words and of abstract concepts. (V.464) The maxim may be used on metaphysical concepts qua concepts, but Peirce claims that it is no metaphysical doctrine. This distinction is crucial. For Peirce the implications of a metaphysically pragmatic universe - whether Newtonian mechanical or Darwinian organic - were totally unacceptable. When Peirce thinks metaphysically, as we shall see, he sees not pragmatism but Agapasticism (love) controlling the universe as system. Moreover, this supremacy of"Agape"</page><page sequence="16">Peirce's Semiotics 121 is more compatible with Lamarck's discussion of habituate effects than with evolution by chance or by mechanical necessity: Lamarckian evolution is thus evolution by force of habit; . . . this account of Lamarckian evolution coincides with the general description of the action of love, to which, I suppose he yielded assent. (VI.300) We shall return to this more thoroughly in a later section, but it is important both to notice Peirce's continued caution against abuse of the pragmatic maxim and to see very briefly the reason for this caution. The pragmatic maxim, then, is not for things, even less for metaphysical speculation. It is an ethical convention for the use of signs. If we think of exchange between ground and interpretant - of a growth of ground with respect to new forms applied to the object - then the pragmatic maxim becomes the basis for a theory of interpretants: retain only those interpretants which reflect or increase (or decrease when necessary) the ground of the sign, whether actually or poten- tially all other interpretants being considered irrelevant. I believe this to be the narrow sense of pragmatism which has become strange to us because we have not taken Peirce literally. Of course, the breadth of effect of such a simple maxim is overwhelming in the actual practice of thought - it is the control on abduction (hypothesis) passing to induction (see the following section). With this in mind, let us look at several formulations of the maxim. Sometimes a logical interpretant is envisaged as in V.2 above. At others, dynamical and emotional interpretants are stressed: In order to ascertain the meaning of an intellectual conception one should consider what practical consequences might conceivably result by necessity from the truth of that conception; and the sum of those consequences will constitute the entire meaning of the conception. (V.9; cf. V.402, V.412) The dynamical interpretant takes us perforce into the ethical domain of action, but it retains the function of a semiotic imperative: the entire intellectual purport of any symbol consists in the total of all general modes of rational conduct which, conditionally upon all the possible different circumstances and desires, would ensue upon the acceptance of the symbol. (V.438) Not only is the problem of interpretants dealt with, but a return to the con- sideration of the sign as mediation between form and matter (see section I). The pragmatic maxim closes off those forms which cannot even virtually asso- ciate in some useful manner to a given object through its ground. This said about a nascent theory of interpretants, it is important to realize that Peirce quite obviously generalized pragmatism at times! As we saw in sec- tion I, he has an unabashedly anthropomorphic bias, and it is this bias which informs the following extreme statement, found in the Welby correspondence:</page><page sequence="17">122 Robert E. Chumbley It seems to me that the objections to my word "pragmatism" are very trifling. It is the doctrine that truth consists in future serviceableness for our ends. "Prag- matism" seems to me to express this.25 Notice, however, that even this statement becomes tame in semiotic terms: symbols are such in the measure that they are serviceable, and they become serviceable by careful attention to their proper significate effects (V.475). As Morris points out: The most important point is that pragmatism, more than any other philosophy, has embedded semiotic in a theory of action or behavior. The relation of a sign to what it signifies always involves the mediation of an interpretant, and an interpretant is an action or tendency to action of an organism. (Morris, p. 40) Elsewhere he states this more concisely: there is a strong strain in Peirce's later thought which, if generalized, in a thoroughgoing fashion would lead to a consistently behavioral semiotic in any- one for whom it is a sign. (Morris, pp. 24-25) Moreover, these behavioral habits in their production are entirely unconscious for Peirce (V.492). Gallie also is sensitive to Peirce's view that "save in relation to physical action (real or imagined), no word, symbol, or conception has any definite meaning" (Gallie, p. 18). IV. Logic "If you carefully consider the question of pragma- tism, you will see that it is nothing else than the question of the logic of abduction." (V. 196) To the normal dyad of types of reasoning - induction and deduction - Peirce adds a third, sometimes called "retroduction" (1.68), sometimes "presumption" (II.774), but most generally "abduction" (1.68; II.774). He attributes this to Aristotle and claims that abduction is but a translation of Aristotle's term arcaywcy (V.144). Abduction is "the provisional adoption of a hypothesis" (1.68). It is "the only kind of reasoning which supplies new ideas" (II.774). Even more plainly: "Abduction consists in studying facts and devising a theory to explain them" (V.145). Peirce stresses the "reality" of the concept of abduc- tion, for it "goes upon the hope that there is sufficient affinity between the reasoner's mind and nature's to render guessing not altogether hopeless, pro- vided each guess is checked by comparison with observation" (1.121). In the construction of abductions, the isolation of all conceivable significate effects and the practical consequences, real or imaginary, of adopting this or that option are pragmatic activities. Pragmatism here is a method of scientific activity; it does not, however, produce of itself the hunch or guess at the conclusion of the abduction. According to Peirce, the abductive mode is "sensuous" (II.643) and may</page><page sequence="18">Peirce's Semiotics 123 be associated with Secondness, as that reasoning somewhere between the par- ticular and the general seeking to unite them with only a heuristic guide, the pragmatic maxim. Jiirgen Habermas associates abduction with Firstness and induction with Secondness, but he misses the curiously existent flavor of abduc- tion as Peirce presents it.26 Continuing the earlier homology with the categories, deduction, in moving from the general to the particular, is always drawing from a given set of significate effects. It is "volitional" (II.643) in that one has only to select a significate effect given by the logical formula or general. It is a sort of Firstness which Peirce says "may be considered as the logical formula for paying attention" (II.643). Indeed, it may be viewed as the process of focus- ing on a particular aspect of a given general pattern. Peirce considered it natural to use diagrams for deductive thought (11.778; cf. III.363), and to that end considered his system of "Existential Graphs" his chef d'oeuvre. Paul Weiss reminds us, however, that such "diagrammatic think- ing" is tied to distortions of Euclidean space. 27 Nonetheless, some of the import of these diagrams, even though the system has been met with little enthusiasm, may be felt in noting the connection between iconic Firstness and the process of disengaging or recognizing forms (ground) in the object. This recognition is basically deductive reasoning, as Peirce sees it: "By deduction, the habit fulfills its function of calling out certain reactions on certain occasions" (VI. 146). This more behaviorally oriented expression of deduction nonetheless suggests the automatic calling forth of a particular by a general, here suggesting a dynamic interpretant. Peirce's terminology is sometimes confusing. He also refers to existential graphs as a "guide to Pragmatism" (IV.7), but here has in mind the develop- ment of right habits of logical analysis. In yet another vein, induction is viewed as containing the support of pragmatism, but it is true only insofar as abduc- tion and induction alike deal in the necessary relation between the particular and the general, abduction hypothetically, induction by observation (see V. 170). This third type of reasoning, induction, is viewed as "habitual" (11.643). It is precisely a question of generalizing from the particular, of taking habit, and as such is genuine Thirdness. This particular homology of logic and categories is rather surprising in where the congruencies fall, for deduction may well be viewed as habit-forming, just as induction may be viewed as dealing with the Firstness (particular) of experi- ence. Peirce arrives at this mapping, however, by way of the equivalency between logic and semiotic, and it comes via a direct homology between deduc- tion/icon, abduction/index, induction/symbol. The deductive activity is iconic in that its ground is a set of already general forms to be recognized. Abductive logic is in itself both everything and nothing. It is everything in that it can point to something new; it is nothing in that it depends upon induction to repli- cate what is pointed to in a symbol. There are broad and narrow senses to the term logic, but the homology above seems to fit both. The general definition of logic according to Peirce is as follows: "logic, in its general sense, is, . .. only another name for semiotic . .. the quasi- necessary or formal doctrine of signs" (II.227). But he distinguishes between</page><page sequence="19">124 Robert E. Chumbley this general logic and a formal or "exact" one which conditions it. In a slightly different vocabulary the two logics are defined as follows: logic may be defined as the science of the laws of the stable establishment of beliefs. Then, exact logic will be that doctrine of the conditions of establishment of stable belief which rests upon perfectly undoubted observations and upon mathematical, that is diagrammatical or iconic thought. (III.429) If "belief" is replaced by "meaning," the familiar context returns. As for iconic thought, Peirce has in mind first and foremost his existential graphs and the logic of relatives, the latter being a form of symbolic logic built not on nomi- nalist classes, but on realist systems. Both the Kantian organic system and the problem of fragmentation for nineteenth-century thought are captured in this definition of the logic of relatives: But where ordinary logic talks of classes, the logic of relatives talks of systems. A system is a set of objects comprising all that stand to one another in a group of connected relations. Induction according to ordinary logic rises from the con- templation of a sample of a class to that whole class; but according to the logic of relatives it rises fromn the contemplation of a fragment to the envisagement of the complete system. (IV.85) Whatever the level or type of discussion concerning logic, Peirce is unequivocal about the possibility of reduction to the forms of the categories: But I am prepared to show in detail, and indeed virtually have shown, that all forms of logic can be reduced to combinations of the conception of infer- ence, the conception of otherness, and the conception of a character (see 111.63). These are obviously simply forms of Thirdness, Secondness, and Firstness. ... (V.194) Moreover, the semiotic equivalency to logic is rather far reaching and sug- gests three branches of study: [logic] is general semiotic, treating not merely of the truth, but also of the gen- eral condition of signs being signs (which Duns Scotus called grammatica specula- tiva), also of the laws of the evolution of thought, which since it coincides with the study of the necessary conditions of the transmission of meaning by signs from mind to mind, and from one state of mind to another, ought, for the sake of taking advantage of an old association of terms, be called rhetorica speculativa, but which I content myself with calling objective logic, because that conveys the correct idea that it is like Hegel's logic. (I.444) Indeed, even the construction of a logical statement, its representation, is triadic in nature: term/proposition/argument (II.95) and reducible to First- ness, Secondness, and Thirdness respectively (II.95). Even more clearly, the expression and activity of logic are brought under the aegis of triadic repre- sentation: [logic is] the science of what must be and ought to be true of representation, so far as representation can be known without any gathering of special facts</page><page sequence="20">Peirce's Semiotics 125 beyond our ordinary daily life. It is, in short, the philosophy of representa- tion. . . . I confine the word representation to the operation of a sign or its relation to the object for the interpreter of the representation. (1.539, 1.540) This converges on preoccupation with a theory of interpretants seen in sec- tion I. How does one sign bring forth another sign? This is the problem of rhetorica speculativa as well as of the interpreter before the object of representa- tion- it is the problem of semiosis. It should become apparent that "organic system" is no mere metaphor for Peirce and that the architectonic for which he strove is a living, "real one." The homologies that we are developing are not mere geometric congruencies. Not only is there dovetailing between different zones of the architectonic, but a building continuity between the homologies which tend as a group to become mutually grounding and mutually commentarial, each triadic system condi- tioning the others which surround it and being conditioned by them. As the triadic families grow, so does the dense simultaneity of Peirce's architectonic. V. Moving Toward Peirce's Metaphysics Before examining triadicity in the metaphysics, it is helpful to mention the mixed reactions which this area of Peirce's work has received from critics. Israel Scheffler suggests that although the metaphysics are often treated apologeti- cally, the cosmology needs a redress of balance; it is not just the quirk of a great mind.28 A. J. Ayer is much harder on Peirce: but since its pragmatic elements [of Peirce's philosophy, which is here incom- pletely represented] when taken as incorporating his theory of scientific method, seem to me to constitute the structure of an edifice for which the formal logic provides the cement and the metaphysics a somewhat florid decoration, I do not think that it will be seriously distorted. (Ayer, p. 6) While it should be evident from the preceding sections that triads abound in every aspect of Peirce's thought, it should be noted that he indeed made rather extensive application of categorial triadicity to various disciplines in a proposed chapter for a book, "A Guess at the Riddle" (I.355ff). In the same chapter he speculates on the psychological origin of the categories (1.374). They are not, moreover, metaphysical (what is), but logical (what appears to be) (II.84). At the first order of phaneroscopic activity, the categories present them- selves as a somehow innate heuristic of analysis. It is sometimes necessary for Peirce to defend himself against "triadomany" (I.568ff) - especially when he makes almost lyric statements about triadicity: So prolific is the triad in forms that one may easily conceive that all the variety and multiplicity of the universe springs from it, though each of the thousand corpuscles of which an atom of hydrogen consists be as multiple as all the tele- scopic heavens, and though all our heavens be but such a corpuscle which goes with a thousand others to make an atom of hydrogen of a single molecule of</page><page sequence="21">126 Robert E. Chumbley a single cell of a being gazing through a telescope at a heaven as stupendous to him as ours to us. All that springs from the A -an emblem of fertility in comparison with which the holy phallus of religion's youth is a poor stick indeed. (IV.310) Despite its frequency as a mode of thought, the ordering of the triad has been one of the most persistent problems. We have been focusing on homologies with the categories and will continue to do so, but there are noncongruent triads! And sometimes even the congruencies are in need of explanation. For instance: "Chance is First, Law is Second, the tendency to take habits is Third; Mind is First, Matter is Second, Evolution is Third" (VI.32).29 Evolution as a tendency to take habits mediates between mind and matter, just as it does between chance and law. Thirdness, as abstractly fixed general or law,30 has been superseded by evolution of law, absolute habit by taking of or tendency toward habit (cf. Hegelian and evolutionary models for the categories supra). Moreover, even the notion of evolution creates some problems. At one point he sees metaphysical continuity (synechism) as the product of chance (tychism) and pragmatism (IV.584), as opposed to the definitive triad of tychasm/synechism/Agapasm (see VI).31 Rather than contradiction, I believe that we see in the formulation above simply an indication that it is Agape which takes precedence in Peirce's view over Darwinian or other pragmatic theories of evolution! With this more general homology in mind, it is interesting to think back to the problem of the interpretant which, as genuine Thirdness, becomes evo- lutionary tendency toward a habit (but is not yet a habit). This in turn mediates between ground and representamen, so that not only does the ground in some ways suggest interpretants, it is also enriched by the actual effects which are not in the lexicon. The model becomes clearly organic, and the fate of the inter- pretant evolutionary. The evolutionary formulation of the later triads supersedes the early logical one similar to Hegelian dialectic (see 11.87). There is obviously a different con- ception of the categories and of their relation one to the other. Rather than contradicting the earlier formulations, Peirce literally gives to merely logical distinctions an organic evolutionary model. Now if we remark that this evolu- tionary Thirdness is as well considered the "tendency of an idea to bring along other ideas with it" (VI. 135), the pragmatic maxim seems to become the selec- tion function, whether for a concept or for an evolving entity. Far from a crass utilitarianism, the maxim becomes a method of talking about evolution which actually reflects evolutionary process. This continuity between mind and matter - monism - is one of the funda- mental leaps of faith which comprise Peirce's metaphysical thinking. In a famous formulation, he claims that "matter is effete mind, inveterate habit becoming physical law" (VI.25; cf. VI.268). Once this central idea is in place, it becomes easy to see that scholastic realism is not by chance his favorite philosophy. The rudiments of his scientific metaphysics have their grounding in realist conti- nuity between thought and reality: "Metaphysics consists in the results of the absolute acceptance of logical principles not merely as regulatively valid, but</page><page sequence="22">Peirce's Semiotics 127 as truths of being" (I.487). Moreover, monism gives a marked perspective to the categories as well. Firstness, tychasm (absolute chance) would be associated with the pure freedom of Mind which may come into "existence" in a particular moment of law-governed matter, which, in its turn, has been brought from chance to law via the evolutionary tendency to take habit. This tendency to take a habit is at least a general tendency to shave away, at any given moment, nonhabituating occurrences (those which have no practical bearing on "con- duct"). A thing is, then, a "cluster or habit of reactions" (IV. 157). Notice here the convergence of habits of signification and of matter viewed as physical habit (governed by law). It is monism which, through its synechism, permits this analogy, or rather homology, between thinking and being. This habit of reactions, the Second of synechism, is brought about by a "synthesis of tychism and pragmaticism" (IV.584). Moreover, since law has become the product of evolution (VI.101g), it is, says Peirce, imperfect. He therefore grounds his notion of scientific metaphysics, after the notions of evolution and monism, on fallibilism (see 1.152-153). The maxim is, as well, at the service of higher evolutionary considerations. It is also important to remark that it is not entropy, but ultimate continuity, which is at the end of Peirce's evolu- tionary and positivistic process: "Everywhere the main fact is growth and increasing complexity. Death and corruption are mere secondary phenomena" (VI.58). That this could be so thought is clearly conditioned by a theory of signs rather than by a biological model of evolution, for only there does the production of interpretants not necessarily imply an equivalent number of "deaths" of interpretants. Truly, the metaphysical concepts so far enumerated may be viewed as applying in a certain sense to (although not derived from) the use of signs in a communicative circuit. If, then, we remember that logic = semiotic,32 it is not surprising to read Peirce's characterization of "scientific" as opposed to other types of metaphysics: To me it seems that a metaphysics not founded on the sciences of logic is of all the branches of scientific inquiry the most shaky and insecure, and in its turn, to be used as the support of the exactest sciences in their deepest and nicest questions. (II.36) Metaphysics for Peirce, insofar as it can be a pursuit of knowledge, should be founded on logic (= semiotic), not vice versa (11.168). This is not to place a radical priority of logic over the metaphysical domain, but rather to suggest that whatever from that domain which can be understood will be recuperated in some signifying, therefore logical, system which makes its apprehension, or rather understanding, possible. In fact, the first of these Peircean semiotic occurrences is the conception of the categories over the phaneron. Step by step, through a path of homologous triads, Peirce is led to speculate more boldly. The categories, become evolutionary triadicity, have led us to a view of thought and reality which portrays an active pragmatic maxim operating between chance and law. This would be, however, but a variation of tychastic (Darwinian) or anancastic evolution had not Peirce gone much further to offer yet another</page><page sequence="23">128 Robert E. Chumbley triad: tychasni/synechism/Agapasm. The order of this triad may appear dis- concerting, since synechism is normally associated with Thirdness. Nonethe- less, as we saw above, because Secondness is existence-matter, habituation and continuity, as posited by Peirce's monism, it would become synechism's pur- view, while Agapasm would become mediation between potential and actual, genuine Thirdness. Or again, Agapasm may be viewed as mediation between law and evolution of law, distribution of laws and law of laws. And yet in the truest sense and clearest terms, Agapasm becomes a technical name for the action of God in the world. Peirce sees a living Love at the helm of the prag- matic maxim and of all else - an evolution by Agape. Karl Britton's failure, in this context, to distinguish between eros and Agape reminds us of the very necessity of this distinction between spiritual and beastly love.33 Moreover, within a Peircean framework, Agape would correspond to the possibility of change in the universe, while eros would characterize the very nature of matter, habituate in itself, in its repetition: The Agapastic development of thought with adoption of certain mental tenden- cies, not altogether heedlessly as in tychasm, nor quite blindly by mere force of circumstances or of logic as in anancasm, but by an immediate attraction for the idea itself whose nature is divined before the mind possesses it, by the power of sympathy, this is by virtue of the continuity of mind; and this mental tendency may be of three varieties as follows. First it may affect a whole people or community in its collective personality and be thence communicated to such individuals as are in powerfully sympathetic connection with the collective people, although they may be intellectually incapable of attaining the idea by their pri- vate understandings or even perhaps of consciously apprehending it. Second it may affect a private person directly, yet so that he is only enabled to appre- hend the idea, or to appreciate its attractiveness, by virtue of his sympathy with his neighbors, under the influence of a striking experience or development of thought. The conversion of St. Paul may be taken as an example of what is meant. Third, it may affect an individual, independently of his human affec- tions, by virtue of an attraction it exercises upon his mind even before he has comprehended it. This is the phenomenon which has well been called divination of genius; for it is due to the continuity between man's mind and the Most High. (VI. 307) The Agapastic tendency toward habit is a very different one from the opera- tion of some abstractive pragmatic maxim. Under this system there is conti- nuity between mind and matter: all is tending toward synechism (continuity/ law) mediated from tychasm (absolute chance) by Agapasticism (the highest form of mediation which is Love). Not only is all tending toward continuity, but Peirce attributes discontinuity and chance to appearance: "the world of chance is simply our actual world viewed from the standpoint of an animal at the very vanishing point of intelligence" (VI.406). Although Peirce speaks of the "Buddhisto-Christian" religion (I.673), the pages on metaphysics reveal more a Christian homology than a syncretism. The continuity which Peirce suggests above between the mind of man and the Most High opens his media- tion on the ultimate triad - the Christian Trinity. There is a cosmic loop in</page><page sequence="24">Peirce's Semiotics 129 Peirce's vision, an imprint throughout creation of this "natural relation" and quite often by homology. But such remarks touch on the quiet and personal domain of faith. The Agapastic process generalized gives an almost hallucinating picture of the universe: The evolutionary process is therefore, not a mere evolution of the existing uni- verse, but rather a process by which the very Platonic forms themselves have become or are becoming developed. (VI.194) We shall naturally suppose . . . that existence is a stage of evolution. This existence is presumably but a special existence. We need not suppose that every form needs for its evolution to emerge into this world, but only that it needs to enter into some theater of reactions, of which this is one. (VI.195) This is a remarkable statement given Peirce's early anthropomorphic bias (which is indeed enduring), and its production is probably due to his pushing the concept of evolution as far as he could. Nonetheless, in the complexity and mystery of such a supposed universe, it is comforting-indeed necessary-to know that it is Agape which is the dominant force. This attempted presentation of Peirce's semiotic in its density and breadth is a necessary step for those of us in critical model-building for literature. All the more so since many semioticians, among them Jakobson and Eco, wish to reduce triadic to dyadic modeling. This apparent economy, in effect, changes not only the functioning of the sign, but a world view as well. In fact, much of the differencing of semantic unities from Hjemslev to Greimas has been based in the metaphysics of presence/absence, a digital dualism quite often blurred by simultaneity which goes back to the Romantic Christian metaphysics offered clearly by Chateaubriand (Le Ginie du Christianisme) and Hugo ("La Preface de Cromwell"). Peircean thought, while remaining profoundly Christian, attacks this nineteenth-century foundation from a very different viewpoint than that of Derrida. First, he posits monistic continuity, and second, he considers the sign and experience in general as susceptible to mediation. Indeed, there is a place for a program of research dealing with production and control of mediated/mediating interpretants, a zone which rejoins psychoanalysis in considering the relationship of the unconscious to the conscious. Interpretants are, after all, the emergent unities of the unconscious, the conscious being a critical filtering, acceptation and rejection, of interpretant process - the scene of Kantian feeling, willing, and knowing. In a literary vein, Michael Riffa- terre's notion of generating a text from a minimal sentence or matrix may be viewed as a theory of mediated interpretants or, rather, a theory of the pro- duction of certain kinds of text.34 Peirce himself saw the relationship between triadic function and the Hegelian dialectic. The deconstructive process as a variation of dialectic (bypassing syn- thesis to generate thesis from antithesis) may be viewed in Peircean terms as the awkward passage from interpretant to ground, the ground being structurally opposite to the interpretant, although generally not conceptually so. The tension of their opposition is precisely that of the deconstructive process of analysis.</page><page sequence="25">130 Robert E. Chumbley The density of Peirce's work is rarely found in the American philosophical tradition, or in any tradition. The metaphysical, historical, and semiotic meet, however, in the work ofJosiah Royce commented by Peirce.35 Royce's Problem of Christianity explores the notion of community under the triadic temporal func- tion of past, present, and future. This is the kind of text that Peirce approved, and it is a model well worth a fresh critical reading. NOTES 1. Rulon Wells, "Criteria for Semiosis," in A Perfusion of Signs, ed.

David Platt, "Transcendence of Subjectivity in Peirce and Whitehead," The Personalist, XLIX (1968), p. 240. Platt finds the categories distinct from Hegelian process because Firsts and Seconds are not subsumed under Thirds.

Nonetheless, insofar as Secondness is existence-matter, habituation and continuity become its purview, while Agapasm becomes mediation between potential and actual. Or yet again, Agapasm may be viewed as the site of "law of laws" or at least the distribution of law or the evolution of law, as Peirce puts it. Or perhaps more clearly, Agapasm becomes a technical name for the action of God in the world. 32.
