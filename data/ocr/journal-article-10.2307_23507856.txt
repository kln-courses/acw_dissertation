<plain_text><page sequence="1">Mystical Rationalization of the Commandments in Sefer ha-Rimmon ELLIOT WOLFSON New York University SeferSefer ha-Rimmon (1287), written by Moses ben Shem Tob de Leôn (circa 1240-1305), the assumed author of the Zohar, is a significant text in the his tory of kabbalah for basically two reasons. First, insofar as the Sefer ha RimmonRimmon is replete with Zoharic parallels, linguistic and conceptual in nature, the former is an invaluable tool for scholarly research into the authorship and literary genesis of the latter. Second, the Sefer ha-Rimmon represents the first expansive reschematization of traditional rabbinic mizwot in accordance with the theosophic principles of medieval kabbalah. The centrality of tacamei ha-mizwotha-mizwot in the history of kabbalah cannot be denied. Indeed, from the ear liest kabbalistic documents, such as the Sefer ha-Bahir, the kabbalists' concern with seeking mystical rationale for the commandments is evident. In the 13th century this enterprise gradually increased until the last decades of that cen tury when a voluminous work like Sefer ha-Rimmon was composed. Although the Sefer ha-Rimmon deals only with a limited number of positive and negative commandments, in theory it is certain that Moses de Leôn would have been prepared to reinterpret all of normative Judaism in light of his sefirotic kabbalah. This grand effort at transposing orthodox observ ance into mystical praxis reflects well on the ethos of Moses de Leôn and his popularistic conception of kabbalah. While it is true that during his life kabbalah was still an esoteric discipline limited to small circles of initiates, there can be little doubt that a prime motivation in Moses de Leon's literary career was an effort at disclosing the secrets and thereby making kabbalah exoteric. The kabbalistic treatment of ta'amei ha-mizwot in Sefer ha-Rimmon is an important part of this larger process. Three main conceptual structures are analyzed which inform de Leon's discussion of the commandments: mizwot as the fulfillment of divine need; mizwot mizwot as the means for the maintenance and ground of existence; mizwot as the means for separation of the holy and demonic realms. The first two principles represent a response to two post-Maimonidean philosophic posi tions: God is self-sufficient and therefore in no need of human action, and man is not to be conceived of as the center of the universe. The third prin ciple, in turn, represents a response to the growing cultural and religious assimilation of Jews into Christianity. The need to keep the holy and demonic distinct is the theosophic correlate to the historical task of keeping Israel and Esau, Judaism and Christianity, distinct. By emphasizing the theocentric and anthropocentric dimensions of the mizwot, therefore, de Leôn sought to combat both sorts of enemy: the rationalist and the assimilationist. 217</page><page sequence="2">218 ELLIOT wolfson [2] I.I. Introduction The second of Moses de Leon's (c. 1240-1305) Hebrew theosophic writings which we know by name is entitled Sefer ha-Rimmon ("Book of the Pomegranate").1 The Sefer ha-Rimmon technically belongs to the genre of literature known as tacamei ha-mizwot, i.e., the explication of the rationale (in this case mystical rationale) for the commandments.2 In Sefer ha-Rimmon one finds a systematic re-interpretation of the tra ditional structure of normative practice in terms of sefirotic theosophy. The Sefer ha-Rimmon, as Daniel Matt has aptly put it,3 is a "kabbalistic manual" in which the author "demonstrates how everyday halakhic ob servance flowers into mystical practice." Although a sizeable part of 12th and 13th century kabbalistic liter ature was dedicated to tacamei ha-mizwot, beginning with the Sefer ha BahirBahir itself and continuing in the circle of R. Isaac the Blind's disciples in Gerona,4 it was not until the last two decades of the 13th century5 (1) Cf. Elliot Wolfson, The Book of the Pomegranate: Moses de Léon's Sefer ha-Rimmon (Brown )udaic Studies: Scholars Press, 1988) [hereafter ShR], All subsequent references to this volume are to the Hebrew pagination of the critical edition unless otherwise noted.

(4) In the Sefer ha-Bahir only a select number of mizwot are discussed: phylacteries (§ 152), fringes (§§ 92-93), the four species of the palm branch (§§ 98, loi, 172, 175-78), terumahterumah (§§ 97, 102-03), the first-born (§ 104), sacrifices (§§ 108-09), prayer (§ 68), the priestly blessing (§§ 123-24), the sending of the mother-birds (§§ 104-05), circumcision (§§ 168, 172), Sabbath (§§ 158-59, 181), the festival of Sukkot (§ 105). Sodot concerning prayer were transmitted by later sources in the name of Provençal kabbalists such as Jacob ha-Nazir and R. Abraham ben David. See Scholem, Reshit ha-Qabbalah (Tel Aviv, 1948), pp. 94—97; idem, Les Origines de la Kabbale (Paris, 1966), pp. 223-26; Joseph Dan, Hugei ha-Mequbbalimha-Mequbbalim ha-Rishonim (Jerusalem, 1984), pp. 144—58; Martelle Gavarin, "R. Azriel of Gerona — Commentary on the Liturgy" (M.A., Hebrew University, 1984), pp. 39—46. In the case of R. Isaac, several of his mystical rationales for the commandments have been transmitted by subsequent kabbalists in the 13th and 14th centuries; see Scholem, Reshit Reshit ha-Qabbalah, p. 113, who assumes that these formed part of a "lost book of R. Issac." This activity continued in Gerona particularly with Ezra ben Solomon who wrote an ex tended list of the "613 commandments deriving from the Ten Commandments" which he appended to his commentary on Shir ha-Shirim; see Kitevei Ramban, ed. H. Chavel (Je rusalem, 1964), II, 522-48. R. Ezra's list is apparently the first systematic kabbalistic près entation of the mizwot', see A. Jellinek, Beitrage zur Geschichte der Kabbala (Leipzig, 1882), p. 24. On the centrality of uTamei ha-mizwot to the "wisdom" of kabbalah, see R. Ezra's own remark, op. cit., p. 479 [cited below, n. 181]. In Azriel of Gerona, Ezra's younger contemporary, we find isolated discussions on the mystical import of the several mizwot. See Perush ha-'Aggadot, ed. Tishby (Jerusalem, 1945), pp. 25-27, 38-39, 53-54. In addition Azriel wrote what is presumably the first full-length commentary on the liturgy. See Tishby, "Kitevei R. Ezra ve-R. Azri'el mi-Gerona," in Studies in Kabbalah and Its Branches [Hebrew] (Jerusalem, 1982), pp. 11-20. The application of kabbalistic tacamei ha-mizwot</page><page sequence="3">[3] MYSTICAL RATIONALIZATION OF THF. COMMANDMENTS 21g that extensive kabbalistic treatments of the subject, such as sections of the Zohar including the Piqqudin, de Leon's Sefer ha-Rimmon, and Joseph Hamadan's Sefer Tacamei ha-Mizwot,7 were written. This intensive effort continued as well into the 14th century as is evidenced from works like Menahem Recanati's Tacamei ha-Mizwot and the Racaya Meheimna (print ed together with the Zohar though presumably composed by a kabbalist other than the author of the bulk of the Zohar), as well as countless anon ymous sodot extant in manuscript. Jacob Katz8 has distinguished three typologies of tacamei ha-mizwot in the first centuries of kabbalistic literary activity. The first is the mini malist approach of the Sefer ha-Bahir: only a select number of mizwot are kabbalistically interpreted.9 The second, of which R. Ezra of Gerona is apparently the first representative, is the median approach: any mizwahmizwah which lacks an explicit reason in the Torah is open for kabbalistic interpretation.10 And the third, the maximal approach, is alluded to first was further extended by Jacob ben Sheshet; see Meshiv Devarim Nekhohim, ed. G. Vajda (Jerusalem, 1968), p. 83, 175-79; idem, Ha-'Emunah ve-ha-Bittahon in Kitevei Ramban, II, 364, 370. The centrality of the issue of ta'amei ha-mizwot is apparent in Nahmanides' com mentary on the Torah. Although he is generally most reticent in divulging kabbalistic secrets, a survey of his work will show that kabbalistic meanings are operative in particular in contexts where explaining the mizwot is called for. Cf. Moshe Idel, "We Have No Kabbalistic Tradition on This," in Rabbi Moses Nahmanides: Explorations in His Religious and Literary Literary Virtuosity, ed. I. Twersky (Cambridge, 1983), p. 63. See also Chayim Henoch, Nachmanides:Nachmanides: Philosopher and Mystic: The Religious Thought of Nachmanides From His Exegesis of of the Mitzvot [Hebrew] (Jerusalem, 1978). For a survey of the historical development of kabbalistic tacamei ha-mizwot, particularly in the 13th century, see Jacob Katz, "Halakhah and Kabbalah — First Contacts" [Hebrew], in Halakha and Kabbalah (Jerusalem, 1984), pp. 9-33; Matt, "The Mystic and the Mizwot," pp. 377-82.

Altmann, "On the Question of the Author of Sefer Ta'amei ha-Mizwot" [He brew], Qiryat Sefer 40 (1965)256-76, 405-12. (8) See J. Katz, "Halakha and Kabbalah — First Contacts," esp. p. 22. It should be emphasized that Katz does not use the terminology that 1 have employed. It seems to me, however, that my categorization is faithful to his position. On p. 32 the author speaks clearly of two types; the one for whom halakha is primary and kabbalah secondary, and the one for whom kabbalah is primary and halakha secondary. As an example of the first type Katz mentions Nahmanides and as an example of the second Ezra and the author of the Zohar. See idem, "Halakhic Discussion in the Zohar" [Hebrew], Halakhah and Kab balah,balah, pp. 34-51• For an alternative view on Nahmanides, see ldel, "We Have No Kabbalistic Tradition on This," p. 63, n. 45. (g) See above n. 4. (10) Cf. R. Ezra, Commentary on Shir ha-Shirim, in Kitevei Ramban, II, 496. As Katz notes, "Halakha and Kabbalah — First Contacts," p. 22, R. Ezra fails to realize the full scope of his own program, i.e., he only discusses a limited amount of mizwot for which there are no explicit reasons in the Torah. See also the comment of Matt, "The Mystic and the Mizwot," p. 378.</page><page sequence="4">220 ELLIOT WOLFSON [4] by Jacob ben Sheshet" and later developed by kabbalists such as the author of the Zohar, Joseph Hamadan, and Recanati:12 any mizwah, whether a reason already exists for it or not, may be interpreted kabbalistically. It is clear that the treatment of mizwot in Sefer ha-Rimmon is an ex ample of the last approach. 3י In one place in Sefer ha-Rimmon the author writes that he is particularly interested in the instances where no reason is apparent: For there are mizwot in the Torah whose reason is known to all and they are not hidden, and there are those mizwot whose reason is hidden, for their reason is a mystery hidden inward in the palace of the King. The mizwah which is revealed to the eye will not be elaborated for the matter is known.'4 Presumably, this reflects, or at the very least, accords with the stated position of R. Ezra to "allude to all the reasons for mizwot which are not specified in the Torah.'"5 De Leon's proclamation notwithstanding, in practice he expounds upon the whole range of mizwot including some laws for which an explicit reason is given in the Torah, such as Sabbath16 and the law of the sciatic nerve,'7 as well as many mishpatim18 whose reasonableness is beyond doubt. Although de Leôn limits his exposition by the eminently pragmatic qualification that only those commandments "that are always necessary'"9 will be discussed, in theory we could say (11) Cf. Jacob ben Sheshet, Ha-'Emunah ve-ha-Bittahon, in Kitevei Ramban II, 364, 370. Katz, "Halakha and Kabbalah — First Contacts," p. 29. (12) See Katz, op. cit. In the introduction to his Tacamei ha-Mizwot (Basel, 1581), fols. 4b~5a, Recanati states that "there are many mizwot whose reason is stated explicitly in the Torah" as well as other "mizwot for which no reason has to be given for the intellect necessitates them." Notwithstanding these theoretical qualifications, in practice he pro ceeds to explain mizwot which fall into these two categories. Moreover, in the same in troduction the author states, "If you can give a reason for the mizwot to restore them to their first root this is good." This unqualified statement is clearly an example of the "maximal approach." See, however. Matt, "The Mystic and the Mizwot," p. 392. (13) Although Katz mentions the author of the Zohar, it is curious that he does not refer to Moses de Leon by name. (See, however, Katz, op. cit., pp. 77-78.) Apart from the problem of the authorship of the Zohar, de Leon's independent Hebrew work on the mizwot,mizwot, Sefer ha-Rimmon, is the first large-scale effort to interpret a sizeable number of commandments according to theosophical structures.

Indeed, every mizwah is a potential stepping-stone for mystical exegesis. For de Leôn the gates of mystical imagination are wide open.20 Significant in this regard is the radical reduction, almost eclipse, of the role of kab balah understood as received tradition21 in this enterprise. It is impor tant to note that in all of Sefer ha-Rimmon, admittedly a voluminous trea tise, in only two places22 does de Leôn make a special appeal to kabbalah as received tradition in order to adduce the mystical rationale for a com mandment. By way of contrast consider the following remark of Nahmanides: "The truth of these matters, and those like them, is not known to a person by his own understanding but through qabbalah (tra dition). And this matter is explicit in the Torah to whoever hears the reason for the mizwot through qabbalah as it is appropriate."23 For his part, de Leôn freely expounds upon the kabbalistic rationale for the commandments, hardly relying on such a "hearing through tradition."24 More than any other kabbalist before him, he is most representative of the "maximal approach" to tacamei ha-mizwot, taking the exegetical meth od to its logical limit. (20) See Idel, "We Have No Kabbalistic Tradition," pp. 70-73; Matt, "The Mystic and the Mizwot," p. 390. According to Idel, de Leôn, together with such figures as Abraham Abulafia and Joseph Hamadan, represent the "innovative" approach to kabbalah as op posed to a figure such as Nahmanides who is representative of the "conservative" ap proach. See ShR I. 38 n. 85. (21) Noted already by Matt, "The Mystic and the Mizwot," p. 390. See also Idel, "We Have No Kabbalistic Tradition," p. 71. Cf., however, the following remark of de Léon in his Mishkan ha-'Edut, MS Berlin Quat. Or. 833, fols. 528—533: "I have seen the secret of the matters of Can Eden and its divisions according to sages that were great in their generation, who spoke in accord with the content of their conjecture. And so the gen erations that came after them also followed their words .. . which are not comprehended by conjecture or supposition but rather from the secret of the inner wisdom which [is a] received tradition and a law to Moses from Sinai." And see below, n. 24. (22) Cf. S/tR,241:1-4; 270:12-14. For a discussion of these two passages, see ShR 1.17 and 22. (23) See Nahmanides, "Sermon on Qohelet," in Kitevei Ramban, ed. Chavel, I, 190. (24) This is not to say that de Leôn doubted the authenticity of kabbalah. On the contrary, he was firmly convinced that the Talmudic sages possessed knowledge of esoteric matters disclosed by the kabbalists of his own time. See ShR 256:19-21; 270:10-11; Mishkan Mishkan ha-cEdut, MS Berlin Quat. Or. 833, fols. 51a-b [cited by Scholem, Major Trends, pp. 201—2], 53a, 57b, 58b. [Cf., e.g., R.

Scholem's remark concerning the attitude of the Sefer ha-Bahir towards aggadah in Les Origines, pp. 97-99, which may be taken as representative of the kabbalists in general.

While the former two have been briefly discussed in relation to Sefer ha Rimmon,25Rimmon,25 the latter has only been discussed partially and exclusively in relation to the Zoharic literature.26 A fresh analysis of all three will shed light on some of the main rationale for the mizwot in Sefer ha Rimmon.Rimmon. It seems to me, moreover, that one could subsume these three principles under two overriding concerns which motivated de Leôn in all his writing: the intellectualist attack on philosophic rationalism,27 on one hand, and the ethical-social attack on the assimilation to Christian ity, on the other. That is, whereas the theurgic notion of fulfilling God and the cosmic one of placing man as the center of the universe may be directly related to opposing views expressed in philosophic literature, the notion of separating the holy and the demonic may be related to an ongoing polemic with the Christian faith, particularly aimed at those Jews who had intimate relations with Gentile women and who had adopted the ways of the non-Jewish world.28 That certain of the mizwot whose purpose it is to keep the holy and profane separate should be viewed in this context is beyond question, as we shall see in greater detail later on. (25) See Daniel Matt, "The Mystic and the Mizwot," pp. 389-go. (26) See I. Tishby, Mishnat ha-Zohar (Jerusalem, 1971), I, 2go-g2; Morris Faierstein, "God's Need for the Commandments in Medieval Kabbalah," Conservative Judaism 36 (1982)50-51; Jacob Katz, "Halakhic Discussions in the Zohar," p. 44. (27) That the impetus for de Leon's undertaking to write Sefer ha-Rimmon was the increasing influence of philosophy among the Jewish intellectual elite in Northern Spain is clear from the proem in the introduction to the text; cf. Scholem, Major Trends, p. 203. In addition, we know from several literary sources, including one passage from Sefer ha RimmonRimmon (cf. ShR 391:3-392:11), that the philosophic orientation to tacamei ha-mizwot had resulted in the neglect of traditional praxis. Cf. Scholem, op. cit., pp. 397-98, n. 154; Matt, "The Mystic and the Mizwot," p. 375. (28) On the Zoharic view that Israel's struggle with Edom (i.e., Christianity) is symbolic of of the struggle of the force of holiness with the demonic power, see Yitzhak Baer, A History of of the Jews in Christian Spain (Philadelphia, 1978), I, 246-47; Yehuda Liebes, "The Messiah of the Zohar" [Hebrew], in The Messianic Idea in Israel (Jerusalem, 1982), p. 196.

Mizwot as Divine Fulfillment De Leon's treatment of ta'amei ha-mizwot in Sefer ha-Rimmon begins from the assumption, first stated openly by the Geronese kabbalists,29 that the mizwot in their mystical essence are identical with the middot or attributes of God, i.e., the stages of divine emanation. And everything revolves around and around until all is bound in the mystery of His Name, and there you will find all the chains and all the patterns [of existence] for they are all in the mystery of His Name. Thus30 each and every mizwah is bound to and found in the mystery of His Name.3' The "mystery of His Name" here alludes to the sum totality of the divine emanations which together form His Name.32 Just as all existence derives from and is bound to this Name, so too every mizwah. 'Let the simple enter here, and to those devoid of sense she says' (Prov. 9:16). 'Devoid of sense' indeed for whoever is not occupied with the mizwot is lacking a heart33 for he has no portion in the God of Israel,34 for the mizwot are all linked to the mystery of the great Name . . . And everything emerges from the mystery of the ten sefirot belimah [which are the] mystery of the ten dibberot35 cor responding to the ten maamarot.36 Everything is one mystery.37 (2g) Cf. R. Ezra, Commentary on Shir ha-Shirim, in Kitevei Ramban, II, 538: "the mizwot are the middot"', R. Azriel, Perush ha-Aggadot, p. 33: "all the mizwot are the [divine] glory." See Matt, "The Mystic and the Mizwot," p. 378. (30) This last sentence is omitted in both the Moscow-Guenzberg and British Museum mss. See critical apparatus ad loc. (31) ShR 11.131:11-13.

Implicit here is a second Geronese notion, which is expressed in an other context in Sefer ha-Rimmon38 more clearly, concerning the mystical identity of the Name and the Torah.39 Insofar as God is identical with His Name and His Name is identical with the Torah, it follows that He is identical with His Torah.4" That the mizwot refer to stages within the divine is further supported by the identification between the sefirot and ma'amarot,ma'amarot, on the one hand, and the dibberot, on the other. In de Leon's case, the ten sefirot and the ten ma'amarot are used interchangeably4' to refer to the ten stages of divine emanation. That these are identical with the ten dibberot imparts to the latter an ontologically divine status. This identification, in turn, is employed by de Leôn to explain an older midrashic motif concerning the inclusion of all the mizwot of the Torah in the ten dibberot.4* That is, inasmuch as the dibberot correspond to the sefirot,sefirot, i.e., the Name or the Torah, it follows that all of the Torah will be contained in the dibberot. In the mystery of the ten dibberot is the principle of all the Torah and all the mizwot . . . For when the matters are unified in their (38) See ShR 11.341:2—g.

(40) This radical step was taken by Recanati. See his Ta'amei ha-Mizwot, fol. 3a (cited by Scholem, "The Meaning of the Torah," p. 44). According to Scholem, Recanati was influenced by a comment of Joseph Hamadan (although at the time Scholem considered the author to be Gikatilla) in his Sefer Talamei ha-Mizwot.

See Moshe Idel, "The Sefirot Above the Sefirot," pp. 245-46, who has argued that, in the case of some kabbalists, among whom Nahmanides is to counted, a distinction is to be drawn between sefirot and ma'amarot; the latter term refers to ten higher powers concealed either in the first sefirah or in the Infinite Godhead, whereas the former refers to the ten lower or more manifest emanations.

And thus you find that they [the dibberot and the ma'amarot]ma'amarot] are the ten sefirot belimah which come to be in His Name.43 What emerges from all this is the ontic correlation between the mizwot below and their mystical essence above, viz., the sefirot. The relationship between the mizwot and their divine paradigms, however, is not one of static reflection. On the contrary, the nature of this relationship is dynamic: the image activates the pattern of which it is an image.44 The mizwot below represent the embodiment or con cretization of divine energy and as such can strengthen the correspond ing gradation above. As de Leôn in one context puts it: You must know that He and His Name are one thing and there is no separation between the sensible light and the intelligible light45 . . . Inasmuch as His existence is found and His truth is 'es tablished on earth' [cf. AMos 9:6]. He brought forth the mizwot inscribed in mysteries, revealed and hidden, each thing according to its measure and quality in a known mystery and gradation in the mystery of the Divine Name. And there is no mizwah that does not have a known and appropriate gradation in the mystery of His Name . . . And thus you must know that when one performs a mizwah,mizwah, insofar as the mizwah is established in his hand, it is as if that [corresponding] grade above is established. Consider the es oteric sense of the verse, 'And observe them and do them' (Deut. 7:9), that is to say, a doing that has a suitable repair [tiqqun] below and above.46 The fulfillment of the mizwot thus establishes and strengthens the sefirot above.

Ezra: "The perform ance of a mizwah is the light of life [of a sefirah]. One who acts below maintains its power."49 For the kabbalist, the primary function of the mizwot mizwot is to perfect the divine being. From this perspective kabbalistic tacameitacamei ha-mizwot may be called theocentric: God is in need of man. The ultimate religious value according to this view is the completion and aug mentation of the divine nature, a process referred to by the kabbalists themselves, as influenced by Zoharic terminology, as hit'orerut50 (lit. 'arousal' or 'awakening'). De Leôn affirms this notion in a variety of con texts: the event above [in the sefirotic realm] is 'stirred up' or 'aroused' by the event below.5' It is the task of homo religiosus to perform the mizwot for by so doing he triggers a set of actions above which ultimately increase the power of the divine. In describing the mystical significance of the mizwah of lulav and etrog, de Leôn prefaces his explanation with the following remark: And you must know that there are great matters in the world which appear to the eyes of men52 as if they are small; yet their power is great and their matter is strong. Since Israel is God's own people, He commanded and showed them the straight and correct way. And thus you find in the matter of human action that the thing which is done arouses a power above which [corresponds to] that very thing . . . And thus you find that there is nothing in this lowly world that does not have its great power above, as they [the rabbis], may their memory be a blessing, have said: There is not a single (47) Cf. Morris Faierstein, " 'God's Need for the Commandments' in Medieval Kab balah," pp. 45-59. The phrase is found in the Talmud where it means "for the need of the Temple." The first to use the phrase in its kabbalistic sense, as noted by Faierstein, ibid.,ibid., p. 58, n. 11, was Nahmanides in his commentary to Ex. 29:46. See also Matt, "The Mystic and the Mizwot," p. 394. (48) See Sefer ha-Bahir, §§ 102, 113, 129. The theurgical aspect of prayer is also em phasized in §§ 5, 123. (49) R. Ezra, Kitevei Ramban, II, 528. R. Ezra, however, does not employ the key phrase. See above n. 47. (50) As far as I am aware this usage originates with the Zohar and the Hebrew writings of Moses de Leôn. See references in n. 51. (51) Cf. ShR 91:14-15; 111:14-15; 144:4-5. The notion appears often in Zoharic texts; see, e.g., Zohar 1,31b, 35a, 77b, 86b, 88a, 235b, 244a; 11,31b; III,92a-b, 110b, 112b, 145a (Piqqudin). (52) The reference is particularly to the philosophers who, according to a text in part two of ShR, mocked the traditionalists for performing this very mizwah. See above n. 27.</page><page sequence="11">[11] MYSTICAL RATIONALIZATION OF THE COMMANDMENTS 227 blade of grass below that does not have a power and a planet above which strikes it and says to it, 'Grow.'53 Do you not find that all the inner, higher powers and the outer powers beneath them ex tend their rule over earth? Thus you find that nothing in this lowly world is for naught.54 Every event below is imbued with cosmic significance because the mizwah is linked to its divine paradigm and arouses its power above. Before proceeding with our analysis of this theurgical conception, it is of interest to note that in one place in Sefer ha-Rimmon the author himself recoils from this very notion. In this context de Leôn reiterates one of the standard rabbinic rationales for the mizwot: to benefit the creatures.55 You must know and recognize to pursue wisdom and the worship of God, and to pursue the knowledge of His commandments. And the essence of His Torah is 'to bestow good upon us all the days and to keep us alive as this day' (Deut. 6:24). For we must know that He, may He be blessed, commanded us in His Torah to strive after the mizwot so that we may live in the world that is all good and extend [our] days in a world that is enduring, for when we strive to do [the mizwot] He, may He be blessed, is not increased and when we detract [from doing them] He has no deficit.56 In any case, He commands us in this [to do the mizwot] in order to benefit us and to give us life as this day and to bestow upon us good all the days.57 According to this passage, then, the mizwot must be viewed strictly from the perspective of human benefit,58 in no way can they affect the divine. There is here a clear theistic rejection of the theurgical conception: God is neither increased by our dutifulness nor diminished by our negligence. (53) Bereshit Rabba 10:6 (éd., Theodor-Albeck, p. 79). (54) ShR 181:3-12. (55) See Tanhuma, Shemini, 8; Bereshit Rabba 44:1 (pp. 424-25); cf. Isaak Heinemann, TacameiTacamei ha-Mizwot be-Sifrut Yisra'el (Jerusalem, 1966), 1, 25. (56) Cf., however, ShR 292:9-109. And see ibid., 361:22-23, where de Leôn makes a similar claim with respect to prayer: "If [one] blesses or does not bless [God] His gra dation is not increased or diminished, for the faith does not depend on this." Yet, in the continuation of that paragraph, esp. 362:14-20, de Leôn affirms the theurgic view. I have discussed the text in detail in "Mystical-Theurgical Dimensions of Prayer in Sefer ha-Rimmon"ha-Rimmon" in Approaches to Medieval Judaism, ed. D. Blumenthal, vol. Ill (Atlanta, 1988), p. 46. (57) ShR 102:2-7. (58) Cf. Sefer ha-Mishqal, ed. Jochanan Wijnhoven (Ph.D., Brandeis University, 1964), p. 98, where the utilitarian purpose of the mizwot is again emphasized by de Leôn.</page><page sequence="12">228 ELLIOT WOLFSON [12] It is necessary to understand this passage, however, as something of an aberration, for in several places in Sefer ha-Rimmon the author as sûmes a theurgical posture and speaks of creating a blemish or defect above or of augmenting the blessing above.59 It is also important to com pare the aforementioned text to another passage, which we have already had the occasion to cite, that stands in diametric opposition to the form er. In the beginning of the seventh gate of part two, de Leôn affirms another standard rabbinic notion: through the mizwot one earns merit in this world but receives the reward only in the world-to-come.611 After stating this, he assures the reader: "Know that regarding the person who performs and is engaged in the mizwot God will protect him in this world and save him from every evil thing . . . God dwells within him and does not move from him."61 Yet, after making this assurance, de Leon proceeds to unfold the "true secret" of the matter which consists of a purely theurgical conception of the mizwot: "And thus you must know that when one performs a mizwah, insofar as that mizwah is estab lished in his hand it is as if that [corresponding] grade above is estab lished. Consider the esoteric sense of the verse, 'And observe them and do them,' that is to say, a doing that has a suitable repair [tiqqun] below and above."62 In this case, unlike the former, the utilitarian purpose of mizwot is accorded a lower status while the theurgical-theosophic ex planation is presented as the deepest level of esoteric truth. The very conception which the author rejected above is here affirmed: through human activity the divine is strengthened or weakened. The end of the above passage may reflect the following passage in the Zohar: 'If you follow My laws and observe them and do them' (Lev. 26:3). What does this mean: 'and do them'? Since the Torah has already said 'follow' and 'observe,' why 'do? Because one who performs the commandments of Torah and walks in God's ways, it is as if he has made Him above, as if it were possible. The Blessed Holy One says, 'It is as if he has made Me'.63 (59) Cf. ShR 186:7-8; 216:14-15; 219:4-6. I have discussed in detail the theurgical aspects of prayer in the article cited above, n. 56. (60) ShR 364:11-12. (61) Ibid., 13-15. (62) Ibid., 365:1-4. (63) Zohar III, 113a. Cf. R. Margaliot, Nizozei Zohar, ad loc., n. 12, who gives as the source for this interpretation Leviticus Rabbah, 35:6. Yet the crucial phrase, casa'ani "has made me," is missing from that midrashic text. See Tishby, Mishnat ha-Zohar, II, 434-35, n. 50. A similar formulation, "Whoever keeps my commandments I regard him as if he made me," occurs in a late 13th century kabbalistic work, Sefer ha-Yihud. See Moshe Idel,</page><page sequence="13">[13] MYSTICAL RATIONALIZATION OF THE COMMANDMENTS 22g In Sefer ha-Rimmon de Leôn speaks of an action that has "an appropriate tiqquntiqqun below and above." He does not, however, elaborate on what that tiqquntiqqun specifically consists of. All we know is that by doing the mizwot one fulfills an action that creates a "repair below and above." In the case of the Zoharic text we learn that the "making of God" above through the mizwot mizwot consists of unifying the Holy One and the Shekhinah, the masculine and feminine potencies of the divine.64 In Sefer ha-Rimmon, although such a mythical conception is alluded to as the reason for certain mizwot,65 it is not offered as the rationale for mizwot in general. In one text, however, this theurgical conception of mizwot is related specifically to the task of increasing power from Binah to Malkhut and from there to the lower worlds.66 'And who does what is righteous?' (Ps. 15:2). What is [the meaning of] 'who does what is righteous'? You must know that the one who walks in the way of his Creator and fulfills the mizwot . . . that is one 'who does what is righteous' [for] he draws forth the desire and the will from the source of life [Binah] and causes the true light to illuminate the moon [Shekhinah] [in order] to shine upon the lower [entities] . . . And thus the matter of drawing forth the desire and will from above to below that is the fulfillment of the mizwot mizwot and the worship of the Creator,67 may He be blessed. And the [rabbis], blessed be their memory, said in the midrash: With "The Concept of the Torah,' pp. 63-64, n. 145. Concerning this work and its author, see idem, Alei Sefer 6-7 (1979)82-84. The identical formula occurs in Recanati, Commentary on on the Torah, Tezaveh, 51c, who cites it in the name of "our rabbis, may their memory be for a blessing." Finally, it should be noted that in ShR 14:7, de Leôn states that "through the mizwot and their fulfillment one makes one's soul." On this expression, to "make one's soul," cf. T.B. Sanhédrin 99b; Targum Onkelos to Gen. 12:5; and see ShR 111:1. (64) Cf. Tishby, Mishnat ha-Zohar, II, 434: "The mystery of union [between the male and female divine potencies] is the central motif in the Zohar also in the descriptions of the activity of the mizwot above." As Tishby goes on to note, this is the conceptual source for the later liturgical formulation uttered before fulfilling a mizwah: "for the sake of the unification of the Holy Blessed One and His Shekhinah." See Zohar II, 119a (Racaya Meheimna)',Meheimna)־, Elijah de Vidas, Reshit Hokhmah, Shacar ha-'Ahavah, ch. g; Tishby, Netivei EmunahEmunah u-Minut (Jerusalem, 1964), p. 20. (65) For example the giving of charity (see ShR 112:10-113:5); the recitation of the qiddushqiddushqiddush on Sabbath eve (119:7-12); sancitification and blessing of the new moon (188:1-19; 190:6-10); the act of qiddushin and the giving of presents prior to sexual in tercourse (216:6-21). (66) The same dynamic constitutes the essence of prayer according to several passages in Sefer ha-Rimmon. Cf. ShR II. 34:14-35:3; and see the extended discussion in E. Wolfson, "Mystical-Theurgical Dimensions ... of Prayer in Sefer ha-Rimmon, pp. 45-48." (see n. 56)• (67) Hence, the fulfillment of mizwot in general is here compared to worship of God, i.e., prayer. See n. 66.</page><page sequence="14">23O ELLIOT WOLFSON [ 14] righteousness the world was created and [He] carried out His work. And who worked upon Righteousness [Zedeq, i.e., Shekhi nah]?nah]? The zaddiq, as it says, 'And who acts upon Righteousness,' when he performs the mizwot.68 Although I could not locate an exact source for the midrash that de Leôn refers to, it seems to me that the tenor of the passage is quite com patible with the Zohar. This passage may, then, either reflect a Zoharic source that is no longer extant or an original composition written in the vein of the latter. Be that as it may, the theurgical intent of the pas sage is clear. The esoteric sense of the expression u-focel zedeq is: the righteous person below, the zaddiq, 'acts upon' the shekhinah, 'zedeq',69 by causing an influx of light to descend upon Her from above; this in flux inturn overflows to the lower realms. This process is depicted as the very essence of the fulfillment of the mizwot.7" Two things that follow from this passage are worthy of our notice. First, the theurgic power deriving from the doing of mizwot is focused mainly in the last emana tion, the divine Glory. In this respect de Leon's view reflects the position of the Sefer ha-Bahir.71 Secondly, the theurgic process initiated by the doing of mizwot culminates in an overflow of energy from Shekhinah downward. The theurgical dimension, therefore, dovetails with the magical. Such a fusion of theurgy and magic is characteristic of both earlier kabbalistic sources, such as R. Azriel,72 and of later sources, such as the Zohar 73 In the case of de Leon's Hebrew writings we find a con densed description of the mizwot in Sheqel ha-Qodesh (1292) which directly addresses this fusion of theurgy and magic: "The essence of the mizwot and the good deeds that a person performs in this world is to prepare his soul and to arrange great things above, to draw down upon himself an emanation of flowing light.'"74 The Zohar, basing itself on the Geronese notion of the Torah as a (68) ShR 377:13-21. See also ibid., p. 46 (English section). (69) The expression is similarly interpreted in Zohar III, 98b. (70) Cf. ShR 388:5-7. (71) See Scholem, Reshit ha-Qabbalah, pp. 52-53. (72) See ibid., pp. 143-44. (73) Cf. Scholem, "Tradition and New Creation in the Ritual of the Kabbalists," On the the Kabbalah and Its Symbolism, pp. 122-28, who distinguishes between two aspects in the kabbaiistic conception of ritual: the symbolic and the magical.

As such, "one who transgresses any command of the Torah is like one who sins against the body of the King."76 Conversely, one who ful fills any mizwah can be said to sustain that corresponding limb. The Zoharic notion, which was expanded by subsequent kabbalists,77 is clear ly based on the Talmudic dictum of R. Simlai78 that the 248 positive commandments correspond to the 248 limbs of the human body and the 365 negative commandments to the 365 days of the year. In the Zohar,Zohar, however, the correspondence refers not simply to human but to divine limbs as well. Insofar as the human anthropos is a microcosmic image of the divine anthropos, it follows that the performance of the mizwot mizwot will strengthen the human and divine limbs simultaneously.79 Although in Sefer ha-Rimmon this anatomical conception is not men tioned in such an explicit way, it is implied in any number of contexts. In the first place de Leôn affirms, indeed copies, R. Ezra's description (75) See Scholem, "The Meaning of the Torah in Jewish Mysticism," pp. 44-50. (76) See Zohar II, 85b, 162b; III, 136b (Idra Rabba); Tishby, Mishnat ha-Zohar, II, 432. It should be noted that R. Ezra of Gerona had already written in connection with the limb limb-mizwah correlation that "the 248 positive precepts are to guide the limbs of man, which number 248, in the path of righteousness and goodness, to purify and sanctify him, to purge and bless him, and to enable him to resemble his Maker." Cf. Kitevei Ramban, II, 548. See n. 78. (77) For example, the author of Ra'aya Meheimna and the Tiqqunim, Joseph Gikatilla, the author of Sefer ha-Yihud (see above, n. 63); Joseph Hamadan who was apparently the first kabbalist to employ the dictum 'ever mahaziq 'ever, i.e., 'limb strengthening limb' (see Altmann, "On the Question of the Author," p. 275) and Menahem Recanati. Cf. Zohar II, 117b (Ra'aya Meheimna)־, Tiqqunei Zohar, 70, 13a; Zohar Hadash, Tiqqunim, 101b; Gikatilla, Sha'arei 'Orah, ed.

Clarke with collaboration by W.E. Aufrecht, J.C. Hurd, and F. Spitzer [Hoboken, N.J., 1984], p. 2, where the number of sinews given is 665. And cf. Eleazar of Worms, Sodot ha-Tefilah, MS Paris 772, fol. 159b. (79) Cf. Nahmanides, "Sermon on Qohelet," in Kitevei Ramban, I, 203: "The human being is vanity and air, nothing at all, but reverence is the essence of his creation. His eyes and head and all his limbs are as nothing; the mizwot are his body and his limbs and his soul" (cited by Matt, "The Mystic and the Mizwot," p. 382); Joseph Hamadan, Sefer Sefer fa^amei ha-Mizwot, p. 428: "When a human being fulfills a mizwah, he maintains an upper limb and a lower limb. The 248 mizwot correspond to 248 limbs."</page><page sequence="16">232 ELLIOT WOLFSON [16] of the Torah as organism composed of limbs.80 In that context de Leôn combines this Geronese concept with the older midrashic motif of the inclusion of all the mizwot in the Ten Commandments and the Zoharic notion that the latter correspond to the sefirot.81 Insofar as the Ten Com mandments, which comprise all the commandments, correspond to the ten sefirot, it follows that all the mizwot are contained in the divine pie roma. The sefirot, in turn, are identical with the Torah or the divine essence which is conceived of as an organism consisting of limbs. It fol lows, therefore, that the mizwot themselves are the limbs of this divine corpus. Furthermore, the correspondence in structure between the human and divine is repeatedly emphasized in Sefer ha-Rimmon. There is, how ever, a fundamental tension in de Leôn,s presentation between what may be called the Platonic approach, on the one hand, and the mythic approach, on the other.82 In some contexts83 the correspondence be tween man and God is linked specifically and exclusively to the psychical domain, i.e., the "true" man is identified with the soul which is "clothed" in a body.84 Hence, the three parts of the human soul — nefesh, ruah, and neshamah, derive respectively from three corresponding gradations in the sefirotic pleroma, to wit, Malkhut, Tiferet, and Binah.85 It is in (80) Cf. ShR 341:2-6 and notes ad loc. In another context, ibid., 366:2-5 (and cf. 327:15—18), de Leon uses the image of a tree to describe the organic quality of the Torah in its mystical essence. The same image appears in Zohar III, 202a. Cf. Scholem, "The Meaning of Torah in Jewish Mysticism," p. 46. (81) ShR 340:17-341-2. See note ad loc., and above nn. 43 and 49. (82) The same tension is discernible in the body of the Zohar. See references given in nn. 83, 84, 91. Cf. A. Altmann, "The Delphic Maxim in Medieval Islam and Judaism," Studies Studies in Religious Philosophy and Mysticism (Ithaca, 1969), pp. 14-19. Altmann notes: "Jew ish mysticism . . . wavers uneasily between the purely Platonic approach and an attempt to see in the totality of man as body plus soul an image of the Divine realm of the Sefirot" (p. 19). And cf. I. Tishby, Netivei Emunah u-Minut, pp. 14-17. (83) Cf. ShR 38:8-13; 46:11-47:5; 88:2-5; 3°4:233°5:41־ Zohar 1:140a. It is interest ing to note here that Joseph ben Shalom Ashkenazi in his Kabbalistic Commentary on Genesis Rabbah,Rabbah, ed. M. Hallamish (Jerusalem, 1984), p. 146, asserts that there are some people, influenced by the philosophers, who incorrectly interpret Gen. 1:26 as affirming that God has a physical likeness to man. It would seem that a kabbalistic explanation, based as it is on a mythical conception of the divine anthropos, would be much more likely to involve such an interpretation. (84) Cf. Sheqel ha-Qodesh, pp. 33-34; Sefer ha-Mishqal, ed. J. Wijnhoven, pp. 44, 159. In both of these sources de Leôn prefaces his remarks with the comment, "they said in the mysteries of the Torah," an allusion to the Zohar. Cf. Zohar I. 20b; II. 75b-76b; Altmann, "The Delphic Maxim," pp. 16-17. (85) Cf. ShR 305:2-15; 406:24-407:9. In several places, however, de Leon connects the tripartite soul with the three verbs that appear together in Isaiah 43:7: bara', yazar, and 'oseh. It would appear from these contexts that the three parts of soul derive from the sefirot: Hesed, Din, and Rahamim. Cf.

Ezra: "man is comprised of all the spiritual entities,"87 i.e., the sefirot, which he connects with a microcosmic motif. Man is said to be a "little world"88 or "a world in himself'89 for he contains "the form of the world, the image of all the [upper] entities."90 Yet, in other contexts,9' it is clear that the body itself is said to be in the image of the sefirot.

ShushanShushan 'Edut, Scholem, p. 353. In ShR 243:12-16, de Leôn employs Ezra's formulation to emphasize man's task to unite with a woman, i.e., man below is in the image of the divine anthropos which is androgynous. In this context de Leôn has combined R. Ezra's terminology with that of the Zohar. See Shushan 'Edut, pp. 353-54, n. 183. In several con texts de Leôn employs Ezra's locution "comprised of all the spiritual entities" to describe the status of Shekkinah which receives from all the upper sefirot. See Shushan 'Edut, p. 364; Sod Sod cEser Sefirot Belimah, ed. Scholem, p. 383, n. 100. In one context in ShR 206:17-18, de Leôn describes Israel as being "a pattern comprised of all the spiritual entities." There, however, it is the corporeal dimension of the limbs, the unity of the organism, that is emphasized. Elsewhere Israel, which according to the traditional account numbered 600,000 adult males at the Sinaitic revelation, is described as being in the image of the "six extremities," i.e., the sefirot of Hesed to Yesod. See ShR 11.138:2-4. Finally, in one con text (ShR II. 257:18-20) de Leôn combines R. Ezra's formulation with the anthropo morphic notion of the correspondence of the ten fingers to the ten sefirot; see below n. 91■ (87) Cf. R. Ezra, Commentary on Shir ha-Shirim, Kitevei Ramban, II. 528; Aziel, Perush ha-'Aggadot,ha-'Aggadot, p. 5, n. 7. Cf. R. Ezra, op. cit., 510; and idem, Commentary on the Aggadot, pub lished in Liqqutei Shikhehah u-Pe'ah (New York, 1978), fols. 16b, 18a. (88) Cf. ShR II. 4:17; Sefer ha-Mishqal, p. 42. On the image of the 'olam qatan, see AvotAvot de-R. Natan, 31, ed. Schechter, pp. 91-92; Tanhuma, Pequdei, 3. It is of interest to note that the author of the Tiqqunim connects the anthropomorphic conception with the microcosmic motif. That is, he uses the expression 'olarn qatan to denote the fact that the human body corresponds to the divine anthropos. Cf. also the formulation in Sefer ha temunah,temunah, (Lemberg, 1892), fols. 25a-b: "And the sefirot which are the image of man — for man is a microcosm according to 'Let us make man in our image, in our likeness' (Gen. 1:26) — are seven forms and the soul is in the body and is the hidden light which is in the head. For in it [the body] is the mystery of the small image, for it is written, 'And from my flesh I behold God' (Job 19:26), and the mystery of the supernal image." See Altmann, "The Delphic Maxim," pp. 14-15. For other kabbalistic references to this conception of the microcosmos, see Joseph ben Shalom Ashkenazi, Kabbalistic Commentary on on Genesis Rabbah, ed. M. Hallamish, p. 136, n. 96, and p. 147. (89) Cf. ShR 38:11. (90) ShR 4:16. (91) Cf. ShR 140:17-19; 268:19-269:17; 337:16-17. Cf. Zohar 1. 186b; II. 23b, 162b. An alternative anthropomorphic conception is that of the correspondence of the ten fin gers to the ten sefirot. Cf. ShR 56:17-57:16; 254:15-16. The source of this theosophic conception is in Sefer Yezirah, 1:3. Cf. Sefer ha-Bahir, §§ 124, 138; Nahmanides' commen tary to Ex. 30:19; Zohar II. 75b. See n. 86.</page><page sequence="18">234 ELLIOT WOLFSON [18] The mystical conception of a limb-to-limb correspondence between God and man is predicated upon the latter mythical conception.92 Insofar as the corporeal body corresponds structurally to the divine anthropos, it follows that there is a limb-to-limb correlation: man can strengthen or weaken the divine form. Moreover, insofar as the 248 mizwot corre spond to the 248 human limbs, they will ipso facto correspond to the divine limbs. This seems to be the tacit assumption in de Leon's par aphrase of a passage in Pesiqta de-Rav Kahana: "There are mizwot which [correspond to] the number of human limbs and they are 248 as the number of limbs. And indeed the person's limbs cry out, 'Do such and such a mizwah with me, complete such and such a mizwah by me'."93 The limb desires, as it were, that the mizwah be done by it because the very essence of that limb is constituted by the mizwah. The correspondence between limb and mizwah is placed in an eschat ological context as well. "For [on account of] the mizwot the person will live in the world-to-come, and he will be revived from the dead. His limbs will be revived according to their just number."94 Here again one can assume that the underlying assumption is the structural kinship be tween the divine and human forms. The limbs which perform the mizwot and are thereby connected to the divine limbs merit to be resurrected. In another context we read that one "must arrange his limbs so that they will be perfected when he approaches his God."94a It seems rea sonable again to assume that the unspoken premise is the correspond ence of human and divine forms. Man must arrange his limbs before drawing near to God because the limbs are symbolic of those divine limbs and as such can have a theurgic influence upon the latter. It is on account of this kinship that one is implored to keep the com mandments for if one fails to do so he blemishes the corresponding structure above: "Know that the Creator, may He be blessed, created man and established him in the upper form, the correct pattern, so that he would be separated from the rest of the creatures. And insofar as man is above all other creatures in the upper pattern, he must be careful not to destroy or blemish in any way that upper form so that the faces [i.e., the sefirot] will be complete without any damage, and so (g2) This is the original intent of the Sefer ha-Bahir as well: the limbs of the human anthropos correpond to those of the divine anthropos. See § 82. Cf. Altmann, "The Del phic Maxim," p. 14, and see above n. 82. (93) ShR 132:1-3. The reference is to Pesiqta de-Rav Kahana, 12:1 (ed. Mandelbaum, p. 203).

Israel is in the form of the king, i.e., God, and as such must maintain that form by doing the mizwot. It is on account of the mizwot that Israel can cleave to God.98 By performing the mizwot one binds one's limb to the upper limb, thereby sustaining the latter and nourishing the former. III. Mizwot as the Ground of Existence In addition to the theurgical-theocentric conception of mizwot which we have analyzed above, there is a second conception which provides the axiological axis upon which de Leon's treatment turns: man is the unifying ground of all existence. This conception likewise depends upon the structural kinship between man and God. From one perspective this kinship shifts the focus of tacamei ha-mizwot to the divine being, the re cipient of theurgical activity. From another perspective, however, this kinship places upon man the central task of maintaining the existence of all worlds and, consequently, the focus of tacamei ha-mizwot shifts to the human realm. Whereas in the former case de Leon's treatment of the mizwot is decidedly theocentric, in the latter case it is clearly anthro pocentric.99 To put the matter differently, in Sefer ha-Rimmon theosophy (95) sflR 298:24-299:4. (96) ShR 299:7-13. (97) Cf. Zohar I. 245b. The parable is strikingly analogous to the gnostic myth of the spark of God which falls into this world and is imprisoned as the spirit in the human body until such time that it is redeemed and returns to its source in the world of light. Cf. Hans Jonas, The Gnostic Religion (Boston, 1963), pp. 62-65. (98) Cf. ShR 131:22-24; 326:3-9. Concerning the latter passage, see Moshe Idel, "In finities of Torah in Kabbalah," in Midrash and Literature, ed. by G. Hartman and S. Budick (New Haven, 1986), p. 147. After translating the text, Idel comments: "Thus, not only does the infinity of the Torah reflect God's infinity, but apprehension of this infinity offers now a way to cleave to Him. How precisely this happens, we do not know." It seems to me, however, that the means of cleaving implied by this passage consist of doing the mizwot. This may be gathered by comparing this text with the other cited at the beginning of this note. Consider also the proof-text which de Leôn cites in this context: "I have seen that all things have their limit, but Your commandment is broad beyond measure" (Ps. 119:96, my emphasis). The infinity of God's wisdom embodied in the Torah can thus be experienced by man through performance of the mizwot. For an earlier kabbalistic source for this use of Ps. 119:96, cf. Isaac the Blind, Commentary on Sefer Yezirah, 1:6 (print ed as an appendix to Scholem, Ha-Qabbalah be-Provans [Jerusalem, 1966]). (99) Cf. Tishby, Mishnat ha-Zohar, II, 3, who uses the word "anthropocentric" to de scribe the Zoharic view that man is the "central pillar" of the world. As Tishby points out, however, in respect to this view the Zohar is not innovative but rather follows previous lines expressed in talmudic and midrashic sources. See n. 100.</page><page sequence="20">236 ELLIOT WOLFSON [20] and anthropology merge for it is in virtue of human fulfillment that God is fulfilled. The means for the one as for the other are the mizwot. De Leôn emphasizes this cosmic dimension of the mizwot in a variety of contexts. "You must know . . . that the Creator, may He be blessed, made man and established him in the upper pattern so that man would be complete in His attributes . . . And contemplate that, since he is the supernal level above everything else which is beneath the sphere of the moon and below, he establishes this world . . . when he keeps His mizwot . . . the maintenance of the world [qiyyum ha-colam] rests upon man."100 Insofar as "man is the pillar of the world he must strive to pursue his Creator through His Torah and mizwot day and night."101 "Everything is such that the lower world is in the pattern of the upper world and all the gradations concatenate in one chain so that His Glory will be drawn forth in all of them and His unity will evolve through all the worlds. And thus He, may He be blessed, brought forth man so that he would rule in this world . . . And in him the world is established as the pattern of what is above, when one strives to perform His service and to know Him."102 Again, repeating the same theme: "You must know that the Creator, may He be blessed, created His world by means of loving-kindness1"3 and He created man in the proper form so that he would be prepared for complete service and to govern the lower world in the pattern above . . . And He set [man] in this world in the upper pattern so that everything would be one and the worlds would be unified according to their order . . . The world does not exist except through man who is set in the [form of the] upper intelligible grada tions, the 'upper and lower bowls'."104 Elsewhere it is the people of Israel who are singled out as being en dowed with this cosmic task: "The true Creator, may He be blessed, (îoo) ShR 88:12-18. Cf. Zohar I, 205b; II, 42a; III, 29b, 48a. 11 should be emphasized that the characterization of the mizwot as maintaining the universe is expressed in earlier rabbinic sources. See, for example, M. Avot 5:1; T.B. Avodah Zarah 3a. (101) ShR 88:19-21. (102) ShR 102:22-103:2. (103) It should be noted that in Sefer ha-Rimmon one finds what appears to be two contradictory opinions upheld. That is, at times de Leôn maintains that the world was created by the attribute of hesed 'loving-kindness' (cf. ShR II.213.16), whereas at other times he emphasizes that the world was created by means of the attribute of din 'judgment or rigor' (cf. ShR 291: iff). And see esp. ShR II.296:2ff., where he tries to harmonize the two views. Both views are traceable to midrashic sources; see Ginzberg, Legends of the Jews, V, 4, n. 6, and references given there. (104) ShR 313:17-314:1. On the expression "upper and lower bowls," cf. Joshua 10:19. In some contexts this verse is used by de Leôn to designate the holy and demonic powers which together form the totality of being.

Thus He gave them the mizwotmizwot by means of which to govern the world, for were it not for the performance of the mizwot the world could not exist."1"5 The mizwot "are the principle of everything and the secret of the holy Torah, the secret by which the upper and lower realms are maintained."1"6 "The secret of the performance of the mizwot [is] the perfection of all the worlds [tiqqun[tiqqun kol ha-colamot\ and the drawing forth of the desire and will from above to below."107 "You must know that the world, heaven and earth and all their hosts, would not be upheld were it not for the existence of the Torah and the secret of its commandments and laws . . .

The latter had argued against those who would posit that "the finality of all that exists is solely the existence of the human species so that it should worship God."11" In Maimonides' view, the correct be lief, and one which he says accords with the Torah, is that all beings do not exist for the sake of man but rather each being for its own sake.111 The kabbalists reacted strongly to Maimonides' claim.112 (105) ShR 356:22-357:4. (106) ShR 371:16-17. (107) ShR 388:5-6; cf. 377:13-21. (108) ShR 11.111:15-20. (109) ShR 11.357:6-7. (110) The Guide of the Perplexed, III, 13, (ed. Pines, p. 451). It is of interest to note that the key proof-text which Maimonides cites in this context is Jer. 33:25. As Pines al ready noted, op. cit., n. 12, Maimonides probably had in mind the talmudic interpretation which understands the verse as referring to the Torah ( = covenant) in general. Cf. T.B. ShabbatShabbat 33a; Nedarim 32a; Pesahim 68b. The same verse is the locus of de Leon's exegesis. See ShR II. 111:15-18; 357:4-5; and cf. to Zohar I. 185a; II. 46a, 94a, 200a; III, 11b, 73b; Zohar Hadash, 44d. (111) The Guide of the Perplexed, III, 13, pp. 452-53. (112) A classical expression of the kabbalists' attack on Maimonides is that of Meir</page><page sequence="22">238 ELLIOT WOLFSON [22] Kabbalistic anthropology is thoroughly anthropocentric: man is the chief actor in the cosmic drama, the one who sustains all existence, the axis axis mundi. The means at his disposal to carry out this task are the mizwot. Let us examine a bit more closely the anthropology of Sefer ha Rimmon.Rimmon. Employing the formula of R. Ezra of Gerona, de Leôn empha sizes several times that man "is comprised of all the spiritual entities.'"13 From a careful examination of most"4 of the contexts in which this for mula appears it would seem that de Leôn used it to denote an onto logical resemblance between the human psyche and the sefirotic plero ma."5 That is, the soul originates in the divine world and as such may be said to comprise all the sefirot. In one place the description is expand ed: "Man comprises all the spiritual entities and within him is the pattern of all the worlds and the things hidden and revealed.""6 In this case de Leôn has combined Ezra's conception with a microcosmic notion that is expressed in similar terms in the Zohar.117 Not only does man contain in himself an image of the divine pleroma, but rather of all the worlds. The idea that man contains the pattern of both the hidden and re vealed worlds is expressed by de Leôn in somewhat different terms in ibn Gabbai, QAvodat ha-Qodesh, 3:1. See Tishby, Mishnat ha-Zohar, II. 4-5; idem, Netivei EmunahEmunah u-Minut, p. 14. It is of interest to point out that R. Abraham b. David in the introduction to his Bacalei ha-Nefesh, ed. J. Kafih (Jerusalem, 1965), affirms the view that all things were created for the sake of man. Cf. J. Dan, "Haqdamat ha-Rabad le—Sefer BaPalei ha-Nefesh,"ha-Nefesh," Sinai 77(1985)143-45. The same position is accepted by R. Solomon b. Abra ham ibn Adret who considers man the "primary intention of creation" Ifiqqar ha-kawwanah bi-berPatbi-berPat ha—colam). See "Perush ha—Aggadot le—Rashba le—Masekhet Bava Batra," ed. L. Feldman, Shnaton Bar-Han 7-8(1970)147; "Perush ha—Aggadot le-Rashba le—Masekhet Nedarim,"Nedarim," ed. L. Feldman, Hagut QIvrit be—Ameriqa (Tel Aviv 1972), pp. 422-23. (113) See above nn. 86-87. (114) For the exceptions, see n. 86. (115) A similar usage of Ezra's formulation is to be found in Sefer ha-Ne'elam, MS Paris 817, f. 73b: "Man is comprised of all the spiritual entities, and he is complete from all the attributes, and he was created with great wisdom . . . for he comprises all the secrets of the merkavah, and his soul is bound therein even though the man is in this world." On the relationship between this text and de Leôn, see ShR 55-56 (English Section). (116) ShR 171:10-11. (117) Cf. Zohar II. 75b; III. 117a, 135b (Idra Rabba), 141b (Idra Rabba). The notion that man comprises the pattern of all things was expressed by R. Isaac the Blind in his commentary on Sefer Yezirah, 3:4 (cf. Scholem, Ha-Qabbalah be-Provans, appendix, p. 14): "Man is the great seal in which the beginning and end, the totality of all created things, are contained." Cf. Tishby, Perush ha—Aggadot le-R. AzrPel, p. 5, n. 7; Altmann, "The Del phic Maxim," p. 15. The idea that man comprises all of creation is echoed in certain aggadic traditions. See, e.g., the fragment from Midrash Avkir in Yalqut ShimPoni to Genesis, § 34 (cited by Scholem, "The Idea of the Golem," in On the Kabbalah a71d Its Symbolism, p. 162); Avot de-Rabbi Nalan, version A, ch. 31 (ed. Schechter, p. 91): "one man is equal to all the work of creation"; T.B. Sanhédrin 37a. Cf. Urbach, Hazal: Pirqei Emunot ve-Decot (Jerusalem, 1971), pp. 190, 206-8, 226.</page><page sequence="23">[23] MYSTICAL RATIONALIZATION OF THE COMMANDMENTS 239 other contexts in Sefer ha-Rimmon. Man is described as the "special créa ture" for he is created "from both worlds, from the higher world and the lower world" so that "the two worlds can be brought into agreement by one who mediates between them."8 And since man is the one who mediates between the two, above and below, He, may He be blessed, established him in the [divine] image and form.""9 The lower world is governed by nature and the upper world by intellect;120 man alone comprises both and is thus able to act as the mediator to unify the two. "This lower world is the last of all the gradations and it must be con nected to the upper world, for this world is governed by nature and the upper world is governed by intellect. And there is no one who can draw this lower world to the world of intellect except the man who wor ships for he mediates between them and holds on to both of them to unite them in the unity [of the] intellect and intelligible."121 All existence, de Leôn states on several occasions,122 ontologically (118) It may be suggested that this conception reflects a sefirotic process: the mas culine sefirah of Tiferet, depicted as the higher Adam or the torso of the macroanthropos, is situated between two feminine sefirot, Binah and Malkhut, which are also designated re spectively as the "upper" and "lower" worlds. Hence, just as Tiferet is located between two worlds so man below is the median between two worlds. See ShR 97:2-4. (119) ShR 46:7-10. (120) Cf. SAfi46:5- And see ibid., 316:18—20, where de Leon calls the lower world the "world of nature" and the upper world "the intelligible world." It is possible that we have here a kabbalistic transformation of Neoplatonic ontology: intellect-soul-nature. In the case of de Leôn, man represents the gradation of soul which mediates between the upper world of intellect and the lower world of nature. (121) ShR 235:22-236:3. (122) Cf. ShR 5:3, 131:6-12; 181:22-182:20; 240:7-11; 296:2-6; 316:11-18, 357:13—15. On the question of pantheism in Moses de Leon's thought, see Scholem, Major Trends,Trends, pp. 222-23. Scholem cites ShR 182:14-20 (although he made use of the MS British Museum; see Major Trends, p. 405, n. 64). A lengthier discussion by Scholem on the ques tion of pantheism in the kabbalah can be found in his Kabbalah, pp. 144-52. See Joseph Ben-Shlomo, "The Research of Scholem on Pantheism in the Kabbalah" [Hebrew], GershomGershom Scholem: The Man and His Work (Jerusalem, 1983), pp. 17-31.

To the sources noted by Farber one might add de Leon's pretheosophic Or Or ZaruQa, ed. A. Altmann, Qovez cal Yad, n.s. 9(1980)253. It should be noted that Joseph Hamadan, a contemporary of de Leôn, was also especially fond of using the image of a "chain." In particular, he used the expression "the holy and pure chain" to denote the unity of the sefirotic world. See Altmann, "On the Question of the Author," p. 274, n. 49; Meier, Sefer Ta'amei ha-Mizwot, p. 24, n. 42. In Shushan 'Edut, p. 339, de Leôn himself uses the image of the chain to name the sefirot. Finally, mention should be made of another Neoplatonic doctrine affirmed by de Leôn: restitutio omnium rerum ad integrum, i.e., the return of all things to their source. De Leôn sometimes refers to this idea in contexts which lend themselves particularly to a pantheistic interpretation. See, e.g., ShR 62:2-3;</page><page sequence="24">24O ELLIOT WOLFSON [24] forms one chain. At times he even embraces a view which approximates pantheism: In truth there is nothing, not even the smallest thing in the world, which is not connected to the links of the chain. Everything con catenates in its secret and is connected with its unity, to demon strate that He, may He be blessed, is one and His secret is one, and all the worlds below and above are all one secret. There is no separation in His true existence . . . The entire chain is in one secret. Everything is linked, one to another, until the end of all the rings which are below, so that His true existence is above and below, 'in the heavens above and on earth below; there is nothing else' (Deut. 4:3g).123 "Everything is connected as a flame bound to a coal124 to unify every thing in a true unity."125 "All things from below to above concatenate so that everything is a complete unity in the secret of His unity, blessed be He, to bind everything in one knot to show that He is one unified in His unity and there is nothing besides Him. And all existents, above and below, are all bound in one secret."126 Notwithstanding this onto logical posture, de Leôn emphasizes that this unity of being is not a fait accompli.accompli. It is the religio-ethical task of man to unify and complete that chain, to draw nature and intellect together. It is through and within man that "all worlds, above and below, are unified in the secret of His unity."127 "Man is the perfection of this world to draw it toward the upper world, so that the one be like the other, to join them together so that His unity be unified in all the worlds, according to the mystery, 'the Lord is one and His Name is one' (Zech. 14:9)."128 IV. Mizwot as Separation of Divine and Demonic In this section I will discuss one final theme which figures rather prominently in de Leon's overall scheme. Central to de Leon's kabbalah is the doctrine of two parallel realms: the holy forces of the right side and the demonic forces of the left side.

Although in one context'3" the author stresses the need to con tain the two realms together, the more characteristic line that is devel oped in Sefer ha-Rimmon emphasizes the necessity to separate the two, to keep the holy and demonic distinct. The reason for several mizwot is understood in terms of this purpose. Before proceeding to adduce examples of specific mizwot, it is nec essary to make two introductory remarks. De Leôn notes several times that each person has the capacity to do good or evil. Moreover, in ac cordance with the way that one acts the spirit descends from above. "If a person goes in the good way, the attribute of goodness will emanate upon him and will be aroused by him; if a person goes in the bad way, the attribute of evil will emanate upon him.'"3' In another context de Leôn connects this process specifically with the performance of mizwot: "You must know that when a person walks in the ways of his Creator and performs the mizwot, the attribute of goodness, which is the right side, emanates upon him, and when he transgresses the mizwot the at tribute of evil, which is the left side or the side of death, emanates upon him.'"32 Thus, by doing the mizwot one cleaves to the right side and (12g) Cf. Scholem, Madda'ei ha-Yahadut 2(1927)193-97; Kabbalah, pp. 123-25; Tishby, MishnatMishnat ha-Zohar, I. 287-307; J. Dan, "Samael, Lilith, and the Concept of Evil in Early Kabbalah," AJS Review 5(1980)17-40. On the possibility that the conception of a demonic realm paralleling the divine first surfaced in Provence, see Scholem, Les Origines, 306-16. (130) Cf. ShR 101:7-9; Zohar IE 26b. This Zoharic parallel is referred to by the author himself with the words "there are those who explain etc." Cf. also the marginal note in MS Oxford-Bodleian cited in n. 2 ad loc. (cf. ShR 12). It should be noted as well that several times de Leôn emphasizes the unity of all being in the context of a discussion which involves the doctrine of the demonic realm. This probably reflects his own tension between a pantheistic view, on the one hand, and a dualistic one, on the other. Cf. ShR 264:16-22; 296:3-6; 307:14—16. A similar tension is found in the Zohar itself; see Tishby, Mishnat Mishnat ha-Zohar, I, 286-95. See also Sefer ha-Mishqal, pp. 147-52, where de Leôn inter prêts the esoteric meaning of I Chron. 4:22 in light of this doctrine to know the demonic side. On p. 149 he writes: 'It is an obligation and a religious duty to know and to seek out that matter [sc. the demonic realm], so as to distinguish between good and evil, but not to cleave to it!" (131) ShR 11.27:9-10. Cf. Zohar I. 99b, 125b. De Leôn (ShR 11.27:7-9) connects this notion with an interpretation of Deut. 30:15 which he attributes to the "sages." Though the reference sounds "Zoharic," I have not located an exact parallel in the Zohar. See, however, de Leon's untitled commentary on the sefirot extant in MS Munich 47, fol. 347b (concerning this work, see Scholem's article, "Eine unbekannte mystische Schrift," re ferred to above, n. 45); and cf.

From this we may gather that the mizwot serve to prevent the augmentation of the demonic spirit in the world. The second point which must be borne in mind is that de Leôn posits an ontological distinction between the Jew and the rest of the nations. He states in clear, unambiguous language that the soul of the Jew de rives from the right, holy side, and that of the non-Jew from the left, impure side.133 Even the one who converts to Judaism is on a lower level than the one born with a Jewish soul.134 De Leôn mystically trans forms the biblical description of Israel as the sons of God (cf. Deut. 14:1); the Jew is the "son of God" for his soul originates in the divine palace.135 The special relation between the Jew and the divine pleroma is expressed in any number of ways. The Jews have received the name Israel because they uniquely participate in the divine attribute of love, Rahamim,Rahamim, which is also called Israel.136 The three divisions within Israel — priests, levites, and laymen — reflect the three sefirot which constitute the threefold unity of the divine; Hesed, Din, and Rahamim.137 The peo pie of Israel are the "perfection of the Throne"138 for they elevate the Presence upward. They are "wicks of light" which serve to ignite the ShekhinahShekhinah to unite Her with the higher "intelligble light," i.e., Her mas culine consort.139 The 600,000 males of Israel who stood before Sinai to receive the Torah symbolically correspond to the six divine extrem ities, the sefirot from Hesed to Yesod.14" Whereas all other nations are ruled by a celestial power, Israel's governance belongs exclusively to the province of God.141 Hence, the Jew, of all the nations, has been (133) Cf.

It is of interest to point out that in the beginning to the second part of Sefer ha-Rimmon (ShR 265:6ff.), de Leôn affirms this view in connection with his rejection of the philosophic view which assigns a causal role to the separate intelligences; there is no cause in existence other than God. This is precisely the position of Hallevi who also connects the larger metaphysical question with the particular historical question of God's relation to Israel. Cf.

It is of interest to note that de Leon's ex planation of the prohibition of eating the sciatic nerve does not involve this separation of the demonic and the divine; cf. ShR 315:16 ff. On the contrary, according to this text, the sciatic nerve corresponds symbolically to Yesod. According to one Zoharic text (I, 170b), the sciatic nerve does, in fact, correspond to the demonic force, the place of the evil in clination. There is some doubt however as to the authenticity of this passage; cf. Altmann, "On the Question of the Author," p. 275. But see Zohar II. 41b.

The same reason underlies the law of not walking in the way of the nations (see Lev. 20:23): Israel is a holy nation which cleaves to God and thus cannot behave or dress in the way that is appropriate for the nations who cleave to the demonic side.149 Similarly, it is forbidden for a Jew to drink wine touched by heathen hands (cf. Deut. 32:38) for there are two types of wine: the wine given to the Jew which derives from the side of holiness and the wine of the non-Jew which derives from the demonic.demonic. '5° The same dynamic is apparent in the law not to gash oneself or shave the front of one's head because of the dead (see Deut. 14:1).151 Sexual relations with a non-Jew are equated with worshipping a strange God.'52 It is clear that the intent here as well is the prevention of the mixing of the holy and impure. "And you must know that he who de rives from the holy seed . . . should not blemish the holiness of the holy seal [the phallus, the place of circumcision] inscribed in his flesh.'"53 The laws of qiddushin, to have intercourse with a woman only after pre senting her with a dowry or a gift, similarly reflect and maintain the distinction of Israel vis-à-vis the rest of the nations: "The holy seed is not as the rest of the nations who have intercourse in the manner of the beasts who have no fence to their licentiousness. However, the holy seed Israel, His treasure, the nation of His lot, all have a wall with bolt and latch surrounding [them] and they should not go outside of it and break the fence so that they be separated from the rest of the creatures on the face of the earth.'"54 Finally, in his discussion of the prohibition of having relations with a woman in her menstrual period, de Leôn hints at an esoteric interpretation which, we suggest, again involves the pre elusion of mixing the holy with the demonic.'55 The mystical reason for several other mizwot involves the separation of the demonic from the holy.

Yet, in the case of the earlier mystics this did not have a demonic versus divine connotation. For de Leôn, the forces that are so mixed correspond respectively to the holy and unholy realms. In this respect, then, de Leon transforms the Geronese formulation in light of a Castilian doctine.'59 The opposition of the demonic and divine plays a role in the mizwot of destroying the leaven before Passover and of eating the unleavened bread on Passover.160 The Exodus from Egypt on the symbolic level represented the nation's going out from being under the dominion of the demonic and entering into the realm of holiness. The leaven, ac cordingly, symbolizes the impure force and thus must be destroyed; the unleavened bread, by contrast, symbolizes the first gradation on the side of holiness and therefore must be eaten. Thus, commenting on the mizwahmizwah not to see leaven all seven days of Passover (cf. Deut. 16:4), de Leôn writes: In truth, the esoteric meaning [literally, the 'way of mystery,' derekh ha-sod]ha-sod] is not to mix the holy with the profane for the leaven is external, the outer gradation, to which it is forbidden to cleave. And the unleavened bread ... is the gradation of holiness. There fore one must be careful that the external thing which is profane will not be seen in the secret of the holy.161 Other mizwot whose particular function is to keep the demonic and divine separate are the scapegoat on Yom Kippur162 and the goat offering on the New Month,163 both understood to be bribes given in (157) Cf.

The mystical significance of the havdalah service on Saturday night is similarly viewed in terms of the separation of the holy, i.e., Sabbath, and the impure, i.e., the week days: "On Sat urday night we must distinguish between holy and profane for the week days are unified in the cause of the attribute which is not in holiness and it is the 'other cause' on the outside . . . And one must distinguish between the cause of holiness and the other cause which is profane."164 The qaddish prayer165 is likewise an opportunity afforded us to separate the divine from the unholy, for by uttering the appropriate words of response with all our force166 and intention167 we elevate the Shekhinah infinitely upward to Her source, thereby freeing Her from the dom inance of Amalek, i.e., the demonic.168 Interesting in this context as well is de Leon's interpretation of the aggadahaggadah in T.B. Pesahim 56a concerning Jacob's desire to reveal the qez, 'end,' to his children: He wanted to reveal to them the end so that the qez ha-yamin would not be mixed with the qez ha-yamim which comes from the side of Cain . . . the 'end of all flesh' . . . And the secret of [the statement that] he came to instruct about that end is that he came to uncover the mystery of the foreskin from the covenant comprised [of all].169 And the secret is in the verse, 'The end-of-all-flesh came before me' (Gen. 6:13). Of this end it is written, 'An end he put to the darkness' (Job 28:3) so that it would not rule over the qez ha-yamin.110ha-yamin.110 There are thus two "ends"171 to be distinguished: the qez ha-yamin172 (164) ■SA/( 130:1-3.

Jacob wanted to reveal the "end" to his sons in order to separate the qez ha-yamim from the qez ha yaminyamin so that the latter would not rule over the former. In other terms, he sought to uncover the foreskin, the demonic shell, from the covenant, the holy core,'73 thereby preventing the mixing of the two realms.

V. Conclusion In the above analysis we have investigated three of the main theo sophic assumptions which inform Moses de Leon's treatment of the mizwotmizwot in his Sefer ha-Rimmon. Although this text had a minimal influence in subsequent kabbalistic literature,175 it still must be seen as a pivotal document insofar as it represents the first known expansive reschema tization of traditional rabbinic mizwot in terms of medieval kabbalistic ideology. In addition, the significance of this text with respect to the question of the authorship and literary genesis of the Zohar is beyond question, as has already been established by several scholars.176 The mystical rationale for the commandments put forth by Moses de Leôn, in fact the crystallization of about a century's worth of kabbalistic literary activity, reflect well on the cultural, religious, and so cial milieu of 13th-century Northern Spain. By way of summation, it may be said that the three principles in de Leon's treatment — mizwot as divine fulfillment, mizwot as the ground of existence, and mizwot as the separation of the divine and demonic — may be viewed as a response to the twin dangers of philosophic rationalism and cultural-religious as similation.similation. The common denominator of these dangers was the possi bility of antinomianism. In the case of the latter this is obvious, for one (173) See n. 169. Cf. Sheqel ha-Qodesh, pp. 67-68. (174) ShR 370:11-14. (175) See ShR 55-57 (English Section). (176) Cf. A. Jellinek, Quntres Taryag (Vienna, 1878), p. 1g, no. 116; Scholem, Major Trends,Trends, p. 187.

Implicit in the kabbalistic infatuation, one might say, with tcfamei ha mizwotmizwot is an on-going polemic with the dominant faith of the countries wherein 12th— and 13th-century kabbalists lived. This is a point often overlooked by scholars who have written about this topic.177 That the kabbalists went to such great lengths to emphasize the divine status of the mizwot and the necessity of their performance seems to me intelli gible only if we understand well the Christian environment which shaped the Jewish experience of the time. The tense relation with Chris tianity is very evident particularly in the case of de Leôn, both in the ZoharZohar and in his Hebrew theosophic writings. The repeated insistence on the separation of the divine and the demonic must be seen in the context of the socio-religious realia of de Leon's time. Israel derived its power from the realm of the divine sefirot whereas Edom (i.e., Chris tianity) derived its power from the demonic powers. One of the primary functions of the mizwot is to separate these realms, to keep Jacob and Esau distinct. There can be little doubt that de Leôn was speaking di rectly about and to the communities of his day. Hence, one can say that, even at this early stage, kabbalah is thoroughly moralistic in its attitude. The notion that not until after the Spanish expulsion of 1492, and par ticularly through the efforts of Isaac Luria in the 16th century, does kabbalah become a "popular doctine"178 is in part a misconception, for it can be shown that already in the theosophy of the Spanish kabbalists, especially the author of the Zohar, ethos and mythos are inseparably bound. One cannot read one page of the Zohar without becoming im mediately aware of the fact that this book is infused with a spirit of or thodoxy and revivalism. It seems to me no exaggeration to say that the Zohar, at least in relation to all that preceded it, is indeed a popularistic (177) This is not to say that scholars have not written about the relationship — both positive and negative — of Christianity to the Zohar, see the references given above in n. 28. To those one may add, Y. Liebes, "Christian Influences on the Zohar" [Hebrew], Jerusalem Jerusalem Studies in Jewish Thought 2 (1983)43-74. My point is rather that scholars have not adequately understood the significance of kabbalistic tagamet ha-mizwot in light of the polemic with Christianity. (178) This is the picture presented by Scholem. See especially Major Trends, pp. 244ff. Scholem writes that only two mystics from the pre-expulsion period, the anonymous au thors of the Racaya Meheimna and the Sefer PelPah, dreamt "about a mystical revolution in Jewish life." It seems to me, however, that one cannot fully comprehend the Zohar itself if one does not attribute to its author some such vision of a "mystical revolution." Cf. Y. Liebes, "The Messiah of the Zohar" (see above, n. 28), who has challenged Scholem's claims about the lack of an active messianic dimension in the Zohar. Liebes has pointed out that already in the Zohar mysticism and messianism dovetail.</page><page sequence="33">[331 MYSTICAL RATIONALIZATION OF THE COMMANDMENTS 249 work intended to reach wider audiences. This accounts not only for its basic midrashic structure, but also for the author's masterful weaving together of the theosophic doctrine with earlier strands of the tradition. While the form of Jewish mysticism at this time may have been esoteric and limited to small circles, the generative impulse is no less socially conscious in its orientation than the kabbalah of a later date.'79 In good measure, I submit, this social consciousness was a response to the claims of Christianity and the sway it had over certain Jews. Yet it is also clear that de Leôn was responding to an internal chal lenge, the growing influence of philosophical rationalism. In this case as well, the potential, and sometimes realized, antinomianism was no less of an existing threat. Particularly in the 13th-century we have ample historical evidence that this danger was not merely academic in nature. Although Maimonides himself tried to uphold the literal and spiritual, praxis and theory, some of his Spanish disciples evidently used the master's writings to construct a rationalistic ideology which undermined ritual observance. The philosophical approach to tacamei ha-mizwot, at least after the dissemination of Maimonides' Guide of the Perplexed, was based largely on an instrumentalist view which conceived the mizwot as means to achieve certain — whether physical, socio-political, or intellec tual — ends. Once these ends are known, however, the possibility exists that one may dispense with the specified means and either replace them with other means or by no means at all. A gap is thus wedged between means and end, for the latter may, theoretically, be attainable without the particular means dictated by a given tradition. This is the crux of the philosophers' attack on tradition as reported by de Leôn himself in Sefer ha-Rimmon: if the reason for the commandment to take the palm branch and citron on Sukkot is for the sake of rejoicing before the Lord, as the Torah put it (cf. Lev. 23:40), then one would do better to take vessels of silver and gold and fine garments because these would bring one greater joy! Or again, when certain "philosophers" were asked why they did not wear phylacteries, they responded: "The only [reason] for the phylacteries is, as it says, 'so they be a memorial between your eyes' (Ex. 13:9). Yet there is no better memorial for us than to remember the Creator with our mouths [i.e., through philosophical discourse and argumentation], even many times a day. This is a better and more suit able [means of] memory.'"80 (179) This has been recognized by Baer who appropriately calls his chapter on the kabbalah in his History of Jews in Christian Spain, "Mysticism and Social Reform." Baer, in my opinion, is correct in perceiving the mystics as social reformers. (180) ShR 391:15-392-3. And see above, n. 27.</page><page sequence="34">25O ELLIOT WOLFSON [34] What is true of the Sefer ha-Rimmon in particular can be said with respect to the kabbalists in general: the intense effort to expound upon the reasons for the commandments must be viewed against the back ground of a similar effort among the philosophers or those who used philosophy as a pretext to justify their disregard of ceremonial law.181 The plethora of kabbalistic treatments of the commandments in the last two decades of the 13th century and the early part of the 14th century points to the seriousness with which the kabbalists themselves responded to the philosophical approach. It is clear that the propagation of this mode of kabbalistic exegesis represents one of the central concerns of the historical development of theosophic kabbalah: to counteract the philosophers and those who used philosophy to rationalize their own heresy. For the kabbalist, the harmonization of the mystical and nor mative182 is the basic tenet underlying the exposition of the rationale for the commandments. No gap separates the spiritual and legal realms: the experience of divine immediacy is mediated through the dictates of tradition and law. Indeed, the very structure of God is mythically identified with the body of law, the Torah:183 to experience the one (181) To be sure the centrality of tacamei ha-mizwot to kabbalistic thinking can be traced to the earliest stages of its literary development; see the extensive documentation above, n. 4. And cf., in particular, the following comment of R. Ezra of Gerona in his Commentary on on Shir ha-Shirim, Kitevei Ramban, II, 479; "From the time that the House of our God [i.e., the Temple] was destroyed . . . this wisdom [kabbalah] ceased in Israel, the wisdom and the Torah with it have been lost, there is no one who knows its explanation, its details, its interpretation, or the rationale for its commandments. For there is a strong and tight connection between the rationale for the commandments, the explanation of the Torah, the words of kabbalah and this wisdom." See above, n. 27. In this regard it is also sig nificant to note the Rashba's words to the Provençal community (cited in cEin Yacaqov to b. Sukkah 28a) criticizing those Jews, presumably influenced by philosophical trends, who viewed the mizwot as having no intrinsic value. Such a view, argued the Rashba, nec essarily leads to the denigration of the practical fulfillment of the mizwot. Against such a notion the Rashba maintained that the mizwot not only have intrinsic worth but they constitute the very substance of the esoteric discipline of maQaseh merkavah. See J. Katz, "Halakhah ve—qabbalah ke-nosY'i mitharim," Halakhah ve-Qabbalah, pp. 73-74; D. Horwitz, "The Role of Philosophy and Kabbalah in the Works of Rashba" (M.A. thesis, Yeshiva University, 1986), pp. 121-25. The essential feature of the mystical rationalization of the commandments was affirmed as well by the Rashba's student, Meir ibn Sahula, who defined kabbalah as comprising two disciplines, the study of the doctrine of the ten sefirotsefirot and tacamei ha-mizwot; see Scholem, Reshit ha-Qabbalah, p. 17; D. Matt, "The Mystic and the Mizwot," p. 377. (182) Cf. Scholem, "Religious Authority and Mysticism," in On the Kabbalah and Its Symbolism,Symbolism, pp. 5-31, and idem, "Tradition and Creation in the Ritual of the Kabbalists," ibid.,ibid., p. 125. See also S. Katz, "The 'Conservative' Character of Mysticism," in Mysticism and and Religious Traditions, ed. by S. Katz (Oxford, 1983), pp. 3-60; M. Idel, "Hitbodedut as Concentration in Ecstatic Kabbalah," in Jewish Spirituality, pp. 406—7. (183) This idea, central to kabbalistic exegesis, is formulated already by the Gerona mystics but reaches its most extreme formulation in kabbalists in the end of the 13th and</page><page sequence="35">[351 MYSTICAL RATIONALIZATION OF THE COMMANDMENTS 251 is therefore to be conditioned by the other. Inasmuch as the Torah in its mystical sense is identical with the divine corpus, it follows that par ticular mizwot likewise are elements or components of God.184 The kabbalistic rationale of a commandment is therefore intrinsically bound to the performance of that commandment. Indeed, one might say, the reason is the act. Put differently, the end cannot be achieved without the specified means for the means themselves are constitutive of the end. Here, in contrast to the philosophic approach, the intrinsic nature of the mizwot is maintained even when the mizwot are perceived of as means to achieve a certain end.185 Kabbalistic tcfamei ha-mizwot thus pre served the nomian character of tradition even while transposing it into a mystical key.186 beginning of the 14th centuries, such as Joseph Hamadan and Menahem Recanati. See references in n. 3g. (184) Cf. Scholem, "Tradition and Creation in the Ritual of the Kabbalists," pp. 123-24; Tishby, Mishnat ha-Zohar, 1.144—5, H.431-32. And see the citations above in n. 29• (185) See Matt, "The Mystic and the Mizwot," pp. 394-98. For a different formulation but one which likewise emphasizes the "practical difference between the philosophical ra tional meanings for the commandments and the mystical ones" in terms of means and ends, see J. Dan, Jewish Mysticism and Jewish Ethics (Seattle, 1986), pp. 90-91. See, however, F. Talmage, "Apples of Gold: The Inner Meaning of Sacred Texts in Medieval Judaism," pp. 337-42, who challenges the "widespread view that philosophic allegoresis led to the abandonment of the observance of halakha" (pp. 340-41 ). As Talmage further notes, this schematization is oversimplified inasmuch as we have textual evidence of philosophers stressing the ultimate significance of the literal and of kabbalists employing allegory. (186) See Tishby, Netivei Emunah u-Minut, p. 20. This is not to say that there was no antinomian tendency in the history of kabbalah. In fact, the seeds for such antinomianism, with particular eschatological overtones, are to be found in such works as the Ralaya MeheimnaMeheimna and Tiqqunei Zohar. The historical realization of this trend, however, did not reach fruition until the Sabbatian movement. Cf. Scholem, "The Meaning of the Torah in Jewish Mysticism," pp. 66-70; idem, The Messianic Idea in Judaism (New York, 1971), pp. 49-77, and Sabbatai Sevi: The Mystical Messiah (Princeton, 1973), pp. 11-12, et passim', Tishby, op. cit., pp. 16-17; Matt, "The Mystic and the Mizwot," p. 399.</page></plain_text>
