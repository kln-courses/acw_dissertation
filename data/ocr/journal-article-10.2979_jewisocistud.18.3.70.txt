<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> “I Said unto You When  You Were in Your Blood,  Live”:   Yoram Kaniuk’s Tasha’’h Amir Eshel AbstrAct This essay examines Yoram Kaniuk’s acclaimed 2010 fictionalized memoir, Tasha’’h  (1948) in the context of Hebrew literature’s reaction to the War of Independence and  to the Nakba. Placing an emphasis on the narrative’s multiple connections between  historical memory and the narrator’s contemporary position, the essay points to cru- cial moments of literary ethical and political reflection. Building on my recent work  on futural aspects in Hebrew literature’s reaction to 1948, the essay places Kaniuk in  the tradition established by such authors as S. Yizhar, Amos Oz, and A. B. Yehoshua,  among others. At the same time, the essay highlights Kaniuk’s implicit understanding  of 1948 as a modernist event: as one of the man-made catastrophes that came to de- fine the modern era. Keywords: Israeli War of Independence, Nakba, modernist event, memory, trauma  H ebrew literature’s grappling with the watershed year 1948 demonstrates the capacity of the arts to broaden our political and ethical horizons not only by unveiling repressed aspects  of our histories but even more so by drawing attention to the past’s ef- fects on our present and its possible impact on the future. Shortly after  the 1948 Arab-Israeli war, in the novella “Hirbet Hiz‘ah,” the writer S.  Yizhar presented this war to his Israeli readers in a provocative man- ner, challenging, deepening, and broadening public perceptions of  the war and subsequently generating a lively debate on the war’s mean- ing for the young Jewish state. “Hirbet Hiz‘ah,” Anita Shapira has  Amir Eshel, “‘I Said unto You When You Were in Your Blood, Live’: Yoram Ka- niuk’s Tasha’’h,” Jewish Social Studies: History, Culture, Society n.s. 18, no. 3 (Spring/ Summer 2012): 70–84 </page> <page sequence="2"> shown, redescribed what most citizens of the young Jewish state saw as  an untainted victory of the few over the many by presenting a much  more complex set of events that also included the expulsion from their [71] homeland of unarmed Palestinian civilians.1 After depicting the war as  a brutal struggle in the course of which young Israelis defended their Yoram Kaniuk’s  state but also engaged in war crimes, Yizhar concluded “Hirbet Hiz‘ah” Tasha’’h with a powerful allusion that tied the war’s atrocities to Israel’s possible • future. The novella ends with the image of the emptied Palestinian vil- Amir Eshel lage as the site of a coming visit:  And when silence had closed in on everything and no man disturbed the  stillness, which yearned noiselessly for what was beyond silence—then  God would come forth and descend to roam the valley, and see whether  all was according to the cry [hake-tsa‘akatah] that had reached him.2  The last word in Yizhar’s novella, hake-tsa‘akatah (“whether all was ac- cording to the cry”), is taken from Genesis 18:20–21.3 There, God ad- dresses Abraham, telling him that the outrage of Sodom and  Gomorrah is so grave that he will visit these cities to see whether their  citizens have acted as unlawfully as the outcry suggests. God’s visit to  Sodom and Gomorrah unleashed severe rage and punishment, end- ing with the cities’ complete destruction. Concluding “Hirbet Hiz‘ah”  on this note, the novella suggests to its readers the possibility that the  actions carried out by Israeli soldiers in places such as the fictional  Hirbet Hiz‘ah may lead in the future to a catastrophic punishment  similar to the one that struck Sodom and Gomorrah.4  “Hirbet Hiz‘ah” was thus not merely a depiction of the 1948 war  but an invitation to its readers to expand their view of what they re- garded as their “War of Independence.” Yizhar’s work challenged  them to reflect on the war’s effect on the ongoing conflict over the  land and perhaps to consider their own ethical and political convic- tions. The questions, whether all is according to the cry and what may  happen in the land if the cry is indeed as awful as it seems, remained  for the readers to answer with new thinking and, possibly, with new  forms of action.5 During the decades following 1948, many Hebrew writers and poets  followed Yizhar’s path in associating the events of this year and the es- tablishment of the Jewish state with repercussions and resonances in  the present and possible futures. In 1952, the poet Avot Yeshurun pub- lished the elegy “Pesah ‘al kukhim” (Passover on Caves), a work that  brought into proximity the fate of Yeshurun’s family during the Holo- caust and the pain of Palestinians in 1948.6 Alluding to Yehuda Halevi’s  </page> <page sequence="3"> canonical poem “Tsiyon ha-lo tishali” (Zion, Wilt Thou Not Ask), Ye- shurun turns in this work to his readers—Jews living in modern Zion,  [72] in Israel. Using tishali (“you will ask”), the future form of the verb lishol  (to ask), Yeshurun’s poem prompts Israeli readers to ask, to inquire and  Jewish possibly pay greater attention to the fate of the exiled Palestinians—to  Social come to terms with their own ethical and political responsibility for the  Studies pain of the exiled Palestinians.7  • In the early 1960s, a writer of a younger generation, A. B. Yehoshua,  Vol. 18 No. 3 offered in “Mul ha-ye‘arot” (Facing the Forests) a thorny parable of  Israel’s attempt to cover up the exile of Palestinians during 1948 by  planting pine forests over the ruins of their villages.8 The dramatic  conclusion of Yehoshua’s work—the arsonous burning of the veiling  forests—suggested that the historical event many Israelis wish to con- ceal—the 1948 flight and expulsion of Palestinians—is hardly a dis- tant past. The image of the burning forest suggested, furthermore,  that this part of Israel’s history will return to haunt Israelis and Pales- tinians alike with ever-greater brutality. Tying the fate of Palestinians during and after 1948 to Israel’s po- litical present and possible future, S. Yizhar, Avot Yeshurun, and A. B.  Yehoshua have set an example for numerous writers across genres,  styles, and generations.9 Although in the 1970s Hebrew literature  rarely dealt with the plight of Palestinians during 1948, from the mid- 1980s onward a number of writers confronted their readers with new  renderings of these painful realities. In light of the 1982 Lebanon  War, the Intifadas, and the stalled peace negotiations between Israe- lis and Palestinians, Amos Oz, David Grossman, Yehoshua Kenaz,  Yitzhak Laor, Daniella Carmi, and Michal Govrin, to name only a  few, presented 1948 and (with ever-growing attentiveness) the fate of  Palestinians during and after the war as a touchstone of Israel’s ethi- cal and political integrity.10 In recent years, even authors born an en- tire generation after 1948, such as Eshkol Nevo in Arba‘ah batim  ve-ga‘gua‘ (Four Houses and a Longing, 2004) and Alon Hilu in Ahu- zat Dajani (The House of Dajani, 2008), have displayed in successful  and acclaimed works how the newly established Israel not only wit- nessed the flight of numerous Palestinians from their homeland (as  the collective memory still suggested) but also actively engaged in  what Palestinians and increasing numbers of Israelis call the Nakba,  the catastrophe of Palestinian expulsion and ongoing exile.11 As was  the case with their literary predecessors Yizhar and Yeshurun, the  symbolic thread that runs through the work of these younger writers  indicates that accounting for the Nakba will have a critical impact on  Israel’s future.12 </page> <page sequence="4"> The literary interest in the Nakba never took place in a political  vacuum. From S. Yizhar’s 1949 “Hirbet Hiz‘ah” to Alon Hilu’s Ahuzat  Dajani, Hebrew literature has been part and parcel of the much [73] broader scholarly and cultural-political discourse surrounding 1948  as it affects Israel’s present and future.13 Though Israeli historiogra- Yoram Kaniuk’s  phers, sociologists, and left-leaning politicians embraced a more nu- Tasha’’h anced historical memory as reflected in the writing of Yizhar and • others, right-leaning scholars, writers, and especially political actors Amir Eshel pursued an opposing course. In May of 2009, a ministers’ committee  of the newly elected Israeli government under Benjamin Netanyahu  decided to support the draft of a law that would outlaw the commem- oration of the Nakba on Israel’s Independence Day.14 After a hefty  public debate, in March 2011 the Israeli Knesset approved an amend- ment to a budget regulation making it possible for Israel’s Ministry of  the Treasury to reduce the funding given to public institutions if they  choose to commemorate the Nakba on Israel’s Independence Day.15  Amidst this most recent public dispute surrounding the Nakba,  the writer Yoram Kaniuk published one of the most remarkable liter- ary works on 1948—his fictionalized memoir Tasha’’h (1948 repre- sented in Hebrew letters)—a work that justifiably brought him the  distinguished Sapir Prize.16 Written in the first-person singular,  Tasha’’h, much like S. Yizhar’s “Hirbet Hiz‘ah,” reflects the writer’s  war experiences—his attempt to personally account for the war’s po- litical and ethical implications for the individual and the nation alike.  In contrast to Yizhar, however, Kaniuk was only 17 years old when he  joined the Palmah in 1947 to fight in the war.17 Furthermore, in  Tasha’’h Kaniuk returns to his youth not immediately after the events  but from the perspective of a 78-year-old man who lived to see the  war’s outcome on Israel’s future—a writer who experienced the 1967  and 1973 wars, the Jewish occupation and settlement of the West  Bank, the Intifadas, and the failed attempts to come to a peaceful  resolution of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.  Relating to the distant past and offering numerous moments that  tie historical memory to the present, Kaniuk’s Tasha’’h recounts 1948  in a set of vignettes organized in a loosely chronological fashion.  Aware of the failures of human memory, Kaniuk frames his testimo- nial work in several significant ways, beginning with a striking visual  component: the cover of the book.  Kaniuk’s 1953 oil painting, featured on the book’s cover, recreates  Israel’s flag as two lines of hazy blue and a muddled, oversized Star of  David. Refracting the stylistic plainness of the actual Israeli flag, Ka- niuk’s banner is dotted with blotches of red that clearly evoke blood.  </page> <page sequence="5"> The visual evocation of blood returns in the book’s motto—“And  when I passed by you, and saw you polluted in your own blood, I said  [74] unto you when you were in your blood, Live; yea, I said unto you when  you were in your blood, Live” (Ezekiel 16:6). The bloodstained flag  Jewish also points to the book’s dedication:  Social  Studies To my dead and alive friends from the Harel Brigade, and to Hanoch  • Kosovsky, the hero who loves who I am, and who is my enemy; the man  Vol. 18 of the land, a bloody man, like all of us, with great love to all those who  No. 3 were there in the hell of slaughter, and yes, we also established a state.18 Though the motto from Ezekiel frames Kaniuk’s Tasha’’h in a highly  dramatic manner (a claim I will return to toward the end of this essay),  his dedication expresses the realization that he and his fellow soldiers  of the Palmah’s Harel Brigade established in 1948 not merely a state in  the narrow sense of the modern nation-state, but rather a homeland, a  refuge for Jews only three years after the end of the Holocaust. Kani- uk’s words also acknowledge, however, the ethical paradox of the sol- diers and their actions. It states what the book’s narrative bluntly  unfolds: that they were also “men of blood.” The idiom ish damim (“man  of blood”) in the dedication alludes to 2 Samuel 16:7, in which Shimei,  believing that David’s troubles are a direct result of crimes David com- mitted against the house of Saul, curses David: “Get out, get out, you  man of blood, you scoundrel!” Kaniuk’s allusion thus suggests viewing  those who fought the war not as flawless national idols but rather as  akin to the biblical David: heroic, complex, and at times flawed.  Kaniuk’s bloodstained flag, the motto, and the dedication unsettle  the glory of the modern nation-state, the idea of Israel as a “normal”  example of that entity (the claim that the establishment of Israel  means the normalization of the Jewish people was a staple of Zion- ism). They also upset the one-dimensional image of the unblemished  Israeli soldier. The following narrative reiterates this move: “It [the  1948 war] happened or not. No memory has a state [medina]; no state  [medina] has memory. I may remember or invent a memory, may in- vent a country or think that in the past things were actually differ- ent.”19 Tasha’’h begins as the conscious attempt to deprive of its purity,  exclusivity, and presumed accuracy the national-collective narrative  regarding 1948. Rather than deliver a precise account of what hap- pened, Tasha’’h offers a personal reflection on 1948—a lyrical, can- did examination of the events as an acrimonious whole.  The narrator-writer attempts in the following pages to make distinc- tions, to show how conflicted 1948 must have been for the different  </page> <page sequence="6"> groups whose fate it determined. He explores a variety of emotions and  truths to see if one may still pass ethical judgment in light of such di- verging memories. To do so, Kaniuk’s narrative turns time and again to [75] the readers, asking them to join in this poetic investigation. “And so it  happened to us,” writes the narrator at a crucial junction. Yoram Kaniuk’s  Tasha’’h We went to bring Jews by way of the sea and we found ourselves creating • a state in the mountains surrounding Jerusalem. Since we hardly knew Amir Eshel how to establish a state, it is a mistake to say that we fought for it. How  could we have known how one does so? . . . The first thing we know in  the history of our people is that Abraham escapes his homeland be- cause he heard God telling him, “Go from your country, your people,  and your father’s household!” So, how can we know what love of the  homeland is?20  Addressing the “we” in gestures such as “we know in the history of  our people,” Tasha’’h invites its readers to explore from new view- points the events that transpired between the November 29, 1947,  United Nations vote on partition and the end of the war. Through its  similes, allusions, metaphors, and allegories, the unnamed “we,” the  readers, participate in an attempt to unveil as-yet unrecognized ele- ments of 1948—to absorb its repressed features. Reading means po- tentially participating in the narrator’s attempt to express the painful  personal and collective truth. Thus, Kaniuk’s narrative recounts the  arrival of Holocaust survivors on the shores of Palestine and their  sense of salvation. At the same time, it records how the writer in 1947  witnessed a helpless Palestinian lynched in plain sight in Tel Aviv.  The narrator remembers thinking, after the November 1947 U.N.  vote, that two thousand years of Jewish persecution, humiliation, and  expulsion had come to an end. Soon after, however, he recounts with  similar emotional intensity the deportation of the Muslim Bosnian  inhabitants of Qisarya (the Arabic name for Caesarea):  They [the expellees] wore coats and hats and already looked like ants  making their way in the sand. At the edge of the procession I saw a little  girl in a green jacket holding a doll. She looked back, and was dragged  away by the Arab, whom I recognized as a Bosnian, a friend of my father,  and I was sad but I didn’t do a thing. What I saw still did not have a  name. . . . [T]he convoy looked ever smaller and lost.21 Remembering 1948, in this scene as in the entire book, involves pre- senting what occurred—the expulsion—and reflecting on one’s own  responsibility through the narrator’s failure to act. In another  </page> <page sequence="7"> memorable scene, Kaniuk recalls entering the cities of Ramle and  Lod shortly after their Palestinian residents were forced from their  [76] homes: Jewish Ramle, the capital of the sands; Ramle the lively city, with its beautiful  Social homes, wide avenues; the city whose streets were filled with acacia and  Studies ficus trees seemed like a murderous storm passed it, leaving only the  • buildings to stand. Lost donkeys were roaming the deserted streets. A  Vol. 18 camel chewed slowly, not knowing where its owner had disappeared to.  No. 3 Palm trees and bushes of prickly pear, and the smell of burned food. In  the homes one could see tables that were arranged for a meal. Food that  dried up on the plates. Hungry dogs nervously searched the remains of  the trash, while barking that seemed like screams in an empty echo cham- ber resounded. A huge broom swept over the city, taking all with it: chil- dren, the elderly, women, the young, leaving only their shadows  behind.22 Kaniuk shifts from a mixture of journalism and lyricism to ethical  reflection. Recording the silence that ensued after the abrupt depar- ture of the city’s Palestinian population, he comments on his emo- tional confusion, his struggle to navigate his role as a soldier, and his  feelings of regret, anger, and shame: The emptiness of the city made me sad. Despite the horrors of war I ex- perienced recently, I couldn’t remain untouched by the sight. But, to my  shame, I could not still be really angry. I was young. I saw friends die. I  saw atrocities on both sides. I felt as though I didn’t have feelings. . . . We  stayed in Ramle for a few days. In nights that were silent because of the  painful hush, I felt I could hear the cement moving.23  The narrative’s dithering in regard to ethical responsibility continues  to build toward the depiction of the desolate Lod: At the back of my mind, I began to hear the steps of those who fled these  cities. . . . Near a long concertina I noticed a crowd gathering. The  women were crying. They howled and begged. Children screamed in  anger and pain. Men shouted and cried as well.24 The testimony then morphs into both communal and self-judgment.  Asking a soldier standing guard in order to prevent Palestinians from  returning to their homes, “Who are these people?” Kaniuk hears that  they are “ just Arabs!” 25 The soldier stresses that Kaniuk should not  be so foolish as to ask who ordered the Palestinians to remain on the  outskirts of town. The city may have been theirs in the past, but it is  </page> <page sequence="8"> no longer. Kaniuk abandons his distant perspective with language  that brings to mind the internal monologue of Yizhar’s soldier in  “Hirbet Hiz‘ah”: [77] I was angry with myself because when I entered the city I felt its empti- Yoram Kaniuk’s  ness only formally; I was angry because I didn’t think what was here be- Tasha’’h fore the city was emptied. Now I could see the faces, flesh, pain. Clothes. • Children. Old women spread over thorny shrubs, screaming. Men in Amir Eshel suits but not always with shoes on their feet, begging. Pain. Longing.  Humiliation. I felt like an accomplice; that the conscience of my youth,  on which I could always count, fell asleep at the most crucial moment.  What could I have done? Fight against the army of the country that I  had just helped found?26 Twice Kaniuk’s narrative breaks in this scene, preventing the sheer  brutality of the events, the magnitude of the pain, from being sub- sumed in a soothing explanation. Using anthropomorphic nouns— “faces, flesh, pain”—the writer fills the city’s void with attributes we  associate with suffering human beings. It is he alone who can spell  out what the military violence erased. The elliptical sentences— “Pain. Longing. Humiliation.”—that give voice to the experiences of  the defeated resist any rationalizing account. Kaniuk’s narrative  turns here as before to the readers, with a question that only seems  rhetorical: “What could I have done?” may be answered in different  ways. Those who will absolve the narrator of his responsibility will  become, like him, accomplices to the act of expulsion. Significantly,  the following pages also do not offer any answer to the question of  what the narrator could have or should have done. It is the readers  who should fill in the gap, consider if the soldier-witness could have,  in fact, done something to help prevent or lessen this massive suffer- ing and terrible national legacy.  Tasha’’h’s exploration of 1948 peaks with the account of what oc- curred in the Palestinian village of Beit Yuba—a fictive name the nar- rator gives to the actual community in the mountains near Jerusalem  that once enjoyed the shade of thick-crowned cypresses. It is there  that the young Jewish soldiers discover the body of one of their unit— mutilated and humiliated, dangling from a tree. At the sight of this  horror, one of the soldiers, N.—a good friend of the lynched sol- dier—explodes with rage. His hatred targets both the Palestinian ci- vilians who remained in the mostly deserted community and the  narrator himself, whom N. regards as a leftist and a softy in all mat- ters relating to Palestinian civilians. N. hates Kaniuk’s “screwed jus- tice,”27 his belief in a binational resolution to the Jewish-Palestinian  </page> <page sequence="9"> conflict. This hatred soon turns into blind violence: N. hammers an  old woman and a younger woman who rushes to her aid. Then he  [78] stabs the young woman, screaming, “All Arab women are nothing but  means of production for the creation of murderers.”28 As Kaniuk  Jewish jumps to help the woman, his fellow soldiers hold him back, remind- Social ing him that he, too, who believes in the brotherhood of man, has  Studies shot numerous Arabs in the war.  • Unrelenting, Kaniuk sees N. grabbing the eight-year-old son of the  Vol. 18 No. 3 woman, holding a knife to his throat. A wave of “rage and remorse”  sweeping him, Kaniuk aims his machine gun at N., saying, “Either you  leave the boy or I will shoot you.” N. does not surrender: “Either you,  Kaniuk, shoot the boy or I slaughter [shohet] both him and his mother.”29  Kaniuk aims his weapon at N., knowing that he is “ just [tsodek]”:  This justice flexed muscles I never thought I had before, . . . and I  thought about . . . the binational state . . . that I thought then as I do now  is the only reasonable solution, but one I can’t live in, and I aimed at N.  and heard a shot. . . . And N. stood there safe and sound while the child  fell, at the beginning like a butterfly and then . . . like a stone.30 As in earlier scenes involving an ethical verdict, Kaniuk’s narrative is  not a self-confident indication of what justice is but rather an explora- tion of the war crime, of the circumstances that led from the rage over  the lynching of the Jewish solider to the murder of helpless Palestinian  civilians. Tasha’’h details how Kaniuk reported N.’s actions to his superi- ors, how instead of pursuing the case and bringing N. to justice they  merely staged a mock trial in which Benny Marshak, who was known as  the politruk (political commissar) of the Haganah defense force, served  as the reluctant judge. This veneer of justice soon dissolves into a sweep- ing justification of the killing through stories about leftist Zionists who  thought that they had developed friendships with Palestinians only to  be betrayed by them later. The notion of the brotherhood of man sim- ply cannot work between Jews and Palestinians.  This moral pretense does not reassure Kaniuk, however. Directly  following the events, he inflicts on his own flesh a sign of Cain: he  shaves his head with an old blade that leaves visible slits on his head:  “No one [of his fellow soldiers] said anything about the ugly bald  head. What they knew they remained silent about. I knew. And I re- mained silent as well.”31 Although Kaniuk’s narrative breaks at this  point without expressing a clear condemnation of this moral dumb- ness, it nevertheless echoes the narrator’s “shame,” his sense of guilt.  </page> <page sequence="10"> Yoram Kaniuk’s narrative in Tasha’’h is not confined to the descrip- tion of the Palestinian expulsion and to the tracing of ethical contin- gencies alone. What lends this book crucial depth is its attempt to [79] capture the broader scale of the tragedy and the complexity of 1948  without resorting all too quickly to moralism and predictable judg- Yoram Kaniuk’s  ments. Rather than allowing the narrator to present himself as a moral Tasha’’h apostle, the work sets him as a prism that refracts different aspects of • what occurred in 1948, most important the proximity if not the imme- Amir Eshel diacy of the forced departure of Jews from Europe following World War  II and the Holocaust and the flight and expulsion of Palestinians from  their homeland in 1948. In fact, immediately after the scene with N.  discussed above, the narrator describes how a convoy of trucks carrying  Holocaust survivors arrives in Ramle only a few days after the eviction  of the city’s Palestinian population. Coming out of the trucks are people like I have never seen before. . . . They wore odd hats like I used  to see in old movies. They shouted. They spoke a mixture of languages:  Bulgarian, Polish, Russian, Yiddish, German, Greek. They dragged  their screaming children and carried their scruffy bags with suspicion.  They looked like locusts attacking the city. They did not walk toward the  empty houses, they jumped at them! They attacked them hungrily while  the previous owners of the houses stood by the fence, hoping to return  or already proceeding in long convoys toward the unknown.32 As in the previous scene, the narrator struggles with his conscience  and implicitly invites the readers to participate in exploring what  should have been the ethical course of action. He notes that these  refugees belonged to “a different cosmology,” that they were beyond  “moral calculation” (heshbon musari).33 Coming from “history’s gar- bage bin,” Kaniuk reflects,  they are right because they survived. By which I want to say that they felt  like sinners who do not possess the right to judge. . . . The sight of the  Jews that nabbed the houses was dreadful, but it also contained some  beauty that does not allow for judgment. The last time that any one of  them owned a house or an apartment was in the 1930s. . . . These chil- dren, who were born in German or British camps, did not know what  homes that are not surrounded by barbed wire look like. No one gave  them the houses they entered now; they simply broke in. They were  stronger than the Israelis [who arrived in Palestine before the Holo- caust]. . . . They felt that they were victorious because they had survived.  They dismantled the barbed wire fences like kids opening bars of choc- olate. They took. They remained.34 </page> <page sequence="11"> One could read Kaniuk’s weaving-together of the two images—the  expulsion of the cities’ Palestinians and the entering of Jewish Holo- [80] caust survivors—naïvely, as a more or less direct attempt to balance  the plight of Palestinians with that of Jews, as a thinly veiled attempt  Jewish to avert questions of guilt and responsibility toward Palestinians. Yet,  Social tempting as such a moralizing reading may be, it is hardly satisfac- Studies tory. Much more than sublimating the pain of Palestinians by invok- • ing the plight of Jews (in the sense of a Hegelian Aufhebung), Kaniuk’s  Vol. 18 No. 3 narrative suggests that Tasha’’h consisted of several interrelated trag- edies and miracles. There was the tragedy of the fate of Jews in mo- dernity, the Holocaust. But there was also the miracle of survival  against all odds. Ensuring that the Jews living in mandatory Palestine  and Jewish Holocaust survivors would have a homeland brought  about a violent clash between Jews and Arabs, between Israelis and  Palestinians. It also meant, simultaneously, the Palestinian disaster,  the Nakba. Kaniuk’s narrative weaving together of the two scenes al- lows us to see that this fateful year that signaled hope for Jews was  also a catastrophe for Palestinians. Kaniuk’s Tasha’’h presents 1948 as  one of the “modernist events” that came to shape the twentieth cen- tury. Modernist events, Hayden White has argued in a seminal essay  by the same name, are man-made disasters such as the world wars,  genocide, the implementation of weapons of mass destruction in war- fare, mass expulsions, and ethnic cleansing such as those we have  often witnessed in the twentieth century.35 Characterized by the un- precedented use of modern technology, these events have shattered  communities, cultures, and our entire ethical framework in ways we  are still grappling with. As images stemming from modernist events  are disseminated through omnipresent media outlets, they function  in our collective awareness in a manner similar to the working of  trauma in the psyche of individuals. Modernist events cannot be for- gotten or remembered, White underscores, without a significant im- pact on our ability to engage constructively with the present or  envision our future. In other words, due to their scope and impact,  “modernist events” make it difficult for us to order them as “pro- cessed past” and thus to positively imagine our future.  According to Hayden White, modernist literature (by which he  means literary works like Kaniuk’s Tasha’’h) is uniquely qualified to  help us come to terms with events such as 1948 and to begin to “posi- tively imagine our future” because it does not restrict itself to represen- tation. Rather, self-reflective modernist literature allows us to reengage  with the past and to connect that engagement to our future horizons  and possible actions. In the case of Tasha’’h, this means reengaging  </page> <page sequence="12"> with 1948 and locating the political and ethical challenges that the  Nakba presents today. Kaniuk’s Tasha’’h is the attempt to let memory  speak, yet it is also an effort to warn of a future that will perpetuate the [81] past and, moreover, to imagine a different kind of future. Earlier in this  essay, I mentioned the book’s motto: “And when I passed by you, and Yoram Kaniuk’s  saw you polluted in your own blood, I said unto you when you were in Tasha’’h your blood, Live; yea, I said unto you when you were in your blood, • Live” (Ezekiel 16:6). Kaniuk returns to this motto in the concluding Amir Eshel scene of Tasha’’h, in which he recounts how he was invited as “an old  man” to speak to schoolchildren about 1948. Kaniuk describes the  beauty, youth, and softness of the young students, their bracelets, ear- rings, and tattoos. He recalls how they quietly listened to his testimony.  Finally, he notes, as he walked away from the school, he stopped for a  moment at the entrance and said to them, in his heart and “with sad- ness,” “unto you when you were in your blood, Live!”36  The past—1948—is tied here to the present: To Israel after the  wars of 1967 and 1973; after the Lebanon Wars; after the Intifadas.  To Israel that is defined by the weighty debates surrounding the Pal- estinian refugees, the occupied West Bank, and the ever-elusive pros- pect of a peaceful resolution of the Arab-Israeli conflict. Just as did  Yizhar in his 1949 “Hake-tsa‘akatah” and Yeshurun in his 1953 “Tsi- yon ha-lo tishali,” Kaniuk ties Israel’s past to the future through Eze- kiel’s “unto you when you were in your blood, Live!” Kaniuk’s  concluding words to the schoolchildren and to his readers are not a  mere description of what some see as Israel’s fate—to always live a life  characterized by the blood of wars, by the conflict over the land.  Rather, Kaniuk asks at the end of this remarkable work what it would  take for Israelis to rise up from the blood in which they lay together  with Palestinians and live a life worthy of humans, a life described in  the words of the book of Ezekiel: “I have caused thee to multiply as  the bud of the field, and thou hast increased and waxen great, and  thou art come to excellent ornaments: thy breasts are fashioned, and  thine hair is grown” (Ezekiel 16:7).

Yizhar published the novella in 1949 with the title “Sipur Hirbet  Hiz‘ah” in a volume containing both “Sipur Hirbet Hiz‘ah” and  </page> <page sequence="13"> “Ha-shavui.” The novella appeared in English translation as Khirbet  Khizeh, trans. Nicholas de Lange and Yaacob Dweck (Jerusalem, 2008).  [82] Quotations in the text are from this translation. In Amir Eshel, Futu- rity: Contemporary Literature and the Quest for the Past (Chicago, 2013),  Jewish 109–20, I discuss Yizhar’s novella in detail. For further explorations of  Social the significance of Yizhar’s novella for understanding the constellation  Studies “1948” in Hebrew literature, see also in this volume the essays of Shira  • Stav, “Nakba and Holocaust: Mechanisms of Comparison and Denial in  Vol. 18 the Israeli Literary Imagination”; Todd Hasak-Lowy, “An Incomplete  No. 3 Frame Narrative Revisited: S. Yizhar’s Introduction to ‘Hirbet Hiz‘ah’”;  Shaul Setter, “The Time That Returns: Speculative Temporality in S.  Yizhar’s 1948”; Gil Hochberg, “A Poetics of Haunting: From Yizhar’s  Hirbeh to Yehoshua’s Ruins to Koren’s Crypts”; Lital Levy, “Nation,  Village, Cave: A Spatial Reading of 1948 in Three Novels of Anton  Shammas, Emile Habiby, and Elias Khoury”; and Uri Cohen, “Unravel- ing the Wars of 1948.”   2 Yizhar, Khirbet Khizeh, 113.  3 Eshel, Futurity, 114–15.  4 On Yizhar’s allusion to the story of Sodom, see Nurit Gertz, Hirbet  Hiz‘ah veha-boker shele-maharat (Tel Aviv, 1983), 77, and Hannan Hever,  Producing the Modern Hebrew Canon (New York, 2002), 114.  5 Yizhar’s writing itself reflected the sense that the 1948 expulsion of  Palestinians remains a facet of Israel’s realities. See, for example,  Yizhar’s prose “Shetikat ha-kefarim,” which appeared in S. Yizhar,  “Sipur she-lo hithil,” in Sipurei mishor (Tel Aviv, 1963), 99–205. The sec- tion “Shetikat ha-kefarim” is on pp. 145–64.   6 Avot Yeshurun, Kol shirav, 6 vols., ed. Binyamin Harshav and Helit Ye- shurun (Tel Aviv, 1995), 1: 81–85. On Yeshurun’s seminal poem, see  Michael Gluzman, The Politics of Canonicity: Lines of Resistance in Modern- ist Hebrew Poetry (Stanford, 2003), 141–72, and Hannan Hever, “Lo  tehat gam mi-penei ‘Al tagidu be-Gat’: Ha-nakbah ha-falastinit ba-shi- rah ha-ivrit 1948–1958,” in Al tagidu be-Gat: Ha-nakbah ha-falastinit ba- shirah ha-ivrit 1948–1958, ed. Hannan Hever (Tel Aviv, 2010), 35–41,  and Hannan Hever’s essay, “‘The Two Gaze Directly into One Anoth- er’s Face’: Avot Yeshurun between the Nakba and the Shoah—An Is- raeli Perspective,” in this issue. Yeshurun was certainly not the only  poet to reflect in his work on the repressed facets of the 1948 war and  on the fate of the land’s Palestinian population, as Haggai Rogani has  shown in his study Mul ha-kefar she-harav: Ha-shirah ha-ivrit veha-sikhsukh  ha-yehudi-arvi, 1929–1967 (Haifa, 2006).   7 My reading builds here on Hannan Hever’s astute reading of the  poem. See Hever, “Lo tehat gam mi-penei,” 37.  8 “Mul ha-ye‘arot” was first published in the literary journal Keshet 5, no. 3  (Spring 1963): 18–45. Later, it was included in Yehoshuah’s second col- lection of stories, Mul ha-ye‘arot (Tel Aviv, 1968), and in Kol ha-sipurim (Tel  </page> <page sequence="14"> Aviv, 1993), 99–128. On this novella and its reception, see Eshel, Futurity,  121–32.   9 The scholarship that emphasizes the Nakba in Hebrew literature as it [83] turns to 1948 is vast. For an overview of some of the major literary  works on the issue and the relevant scholarship, see Eshel, Futurity, 99– Yoram Kaniuk’s  169.

On the origins in the 1980s of scholarly and public debate  surrounding the Nakba, see, for example, Laurence J. Silberstein, The  Postzionism Debates: Knowledge and Power in Israeli Culture (New York, 1999),  and Uri Ram, “Postnationalist Past: The Case of Israel,” in States of Mem- ory: Continuities, Conflicts, and Transformations in National Retrospection, ed.

All translations from this book  are mine, though for a new English translation, see Yoram Kaniuk,  1948, trans. Anthony Berris (New York, 2012).  17 The acronym Palmah stands for Pelugot Mahats (“strike force”). The  Palmah was the elite fighting force of the Haganah, the underground  army of the Jewish population in pre-state Palestine.  18 Kaniuk, Tasha’’h, 5.  19 Ibid., 9.  20 Ibid., 14–15.  21 Ibid., 98.  22 Ibid., 172.  23 Ibid. </page> <page sequence="15">  24 Ibid., 173.  25 Ibid., 174.

As Yochai Oppenheimer has shown,  Vol. 18 the protagonist in Kaniuk’s novel Ha-yored le-ma‘lah (Jerusalem, 1962);  No. 3 Eng. trans., The Acrophile, trans. Zeva Shapiro (New York, 1961), tries to  save an Arab child in a similar situation but eventually fails. Oppen- heimer reads that scene as the narrative’s probing of the borders of  obedience in the course of war. He also, rightly I believe, interprets the  guilt Kaniuk’s narrator feels in this novel as the embodiment of the  writer’s remorse over war crimes that occurred during the war.
