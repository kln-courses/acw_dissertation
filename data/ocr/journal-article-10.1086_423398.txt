<plain_text> <page sequence="1">               E. F. Beall THEISM AND  MYSTIC ISM IN  HES IOD’S   WORKS  AND  DAYS Near its beginning the Works and Days is in accord with the earlier The- ogony’s step away from an anarchic polytheism. The Zeus of  that poem, although a latecomer in the scheme of  things, established hegemony through vanquishing his progenitors and some monsters and consolidated it by siring a number of  principles to preserve order. The later poet has just endorsed the assertion of  the earlier that the primordial principles Night (Nyx) and Strife (Eris) were mother and daughter, respectively, al- beit with a correction: the latter was actually two daughters, a good one and a bad. But he then says the good Strife is now established “in the roots of  the earth” by Zeus himself; the bad is honored only through the will of “the deathless ones,” presumably headed by Zeus. These Strifes are por- trayed so compellingly in the ensuing passage that some interpreters read the entire poem as a matter of  working out their details. Given that both poems enjoyed prestige in the ancient world, one might wonder why the later Greeks did not develop the impulse concerning Zeus in particular further, to arrive at something closer to monotheism than their variegated (and variable) pantheon prior to Christian times. Part of  the reason this did not happen may be that the later poem has a different sentiment near its end. Namely, in specifying which days of (any third fraction of ) the month are good or bad for given activities, the Works and Days says at one point: “Avoid the fifths (i.e., for any activity), Contact the author at 115 Twelfth Street SE #3, Washington, D.C. 20003. ç 2004 by The University of  Chicago.

Indeed, the notion that there are actually two Erides is forgotten regardless of  their status with him.2 Rather, the poet goes back to primordial forces, only a step or two removed from Abyss (Chaos), Earth (Gaea), and Love (Eros), who begin the Theogony’s theogony: Hor- kos in indeed born to Eris there, after Gaea herself  bore the Erinyes.3 That inconsistency has not been remarked—Hesiod authorities have only recently approved the “Days” portion of  the Works and Days in which the cited segment appears as a legitimate object of  scholarship.4 However, another possible mismatch is noted. Namely, while some parts of  the poem stress Zeus as chief  deity, others at first sight cast the rela- tion of  given aspects of  nature to the divine in the mode of  a naturalistic deism (or perhaps animism). Thus in the 1960s Seth Benardete was able to say that, while Zeus is prominent in the primal narratives making up much of  the piece’s opening portion, when it proceeds to the actual works and days of  roughly its second half, his overt role is essentially that of weather god.5 More recently, Richard Hamilton probably speaks for many in claiming that in the agricultural and sailing sections the gods “are sim- ply the random factor in the worker’s routine.”6 Or, in noting the poet’s discussion of  the farmer’s plow, Marie-Christine Leclerc says that the unusual amount of  detail shows the item to be “the tool of  a complex 1  Hesiod Works and Days 802–4: “pevmptaÍ d’ ejxalevasqai, ejpeμ calepaÇ te kaμ a√naÇ: / ejn pev- mpt¬ gavr fasin ∆ErinuvaÍ a ̊m ̃poleuvein / £Orkon geinovmenon, to;n ¢EriÍ tevke phÅu’ ejpiovrkoiÍ.” In this article I mediate between the Greek texts of  M.

Translations are my own, except where noted. I cite other ancient works according to their standard editions, as listed in the Liddell-Scott-Jones Greek-English Lexicon, 9th ed.

Cited verse numbers are to the Works and Days unless otherwise noted. 2 Richard Hamilton, The Architecture of Hesiodic Poetry (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins Uni- versity Press, 1989), is among those who interpret the full poem in terms of  the two Erides (pp. 53–66) and says that Eris in verse 803 is the bad one (p. 80); however, nothing there qual- ifies her as one of  two entities as in the opening section (verses 13, 14–16, 17–20, 24, 28). 3 Hesiod Theogony 231 and 185, respectively. Nyx bearing Eris and similar principles: verses 223–25. Eris in particular was famous in literature and art; see Otto Waser’s entry in the Pauly-Wissowa Real-Encyclopädie, vol. 6 (Stuttgart: Metzler, 1909), pp. 463–66. 4 However, West’s (on verses 765–828) excellent defense of  “Days” against Wilamowitz and others has now been supplemented by several discussions. In particular, the portion sup- plements the yearly rhythm of  the bulk of  the “Works” with a more immediate daily one in various ways; see most recently André Lardinois, “How the Days Fit the Works in Hesiod’s Works and Days,” American Journal of Philology 119 (1998): 319–36. 5 Seth Benardete, “Hesiod’s Works and Days: A First Reading,” AGWN 1 (1967): 150–74, at 165. 6 Hamilton, p. 56. </page> <page sequence="3">                                                     History of Religions 179 communication between man, wild nature, domestic animals, and beyond that, the gods” (emphasis added).7 It can be noted that the poet does not even give the Zeus who is bringing the rain either of  the ominous stan- dard epithets “cloud-gathering” and “delighting in thunder” anywhere in the second half  of  the poem, much less remind us that he is also the “father of  men and gods,” as is said during the conflict with Prometheus in the first part of  the poem as well as on several occasions in Homer.8 One might also wonder why another of  the Titans whom the Theogony’s Zeus defeated and humiliated is singled out for positive mention, when the listener is reminded that the Pleaides who rise at the actual beginning of  the works and days proper are related to Atlas. Still, other commentators take a less agnostic view. Luciana Bona Quaglia thinks that the poem’s Zeus is owed homage from the humans who are part of  his order (more or less as gods were said to be part of  it in the earlier poem), by virtue of  his bringing riches and punishing wrongs, but also because “he inspires the fundamental principles of  life in men.”9 Thus, she concludes, Hesiod’s human is Zeus’s instrument and collaborator and thereby perfects the latter’s glory.10 Without going that far, Stephanie Nelson nonetheless holds that “Hesiod’s sense of  the di- vine is all-pervasive, extending throughout his poetry” and that the gods of  the agricultural portion “are immediate, omnipresent, and, above all, part of  a divine order, the order which creates the dramatic arrangement of  the farmer’s year.”11 It is certainly true that Zeus is not only said to de- cide when rain does or does not come but, at one point (verse 565), to be the agency that ends winter per se. A third issue is a contradiction in Hesiod’s basic sense of  who or what Zeus is. Apart from a ten-verse proemium, the Works and Days begins with some ninety-odd lines composed mostly in a mythic-narrative mode. (The composition consists of  the discussion of  the two Strife daemones noted above, which corrects the Theogony conception without challenging its mythic basis; a formally didactic section that asks the nomi- nal addressee Perses to eschew the bad Strife and work instead, which at least in principle one can see as offering exemplification of  the general 7 “L’instrument d’une communication complexe entre l’homme, la nature sauvage, les ani- maux domestiques et, au-delà, les dieux” (Marie-Christine Leclerc, Le parole chez Hésiode: À la recherche de l’harmonie perdue [Paris: Belles Lettres, 1993], p. 285). 8 Pater andron te theon te occurs fifteen times in Homer, where it indeed connotes total dominion; see G.

Still, the way that the conflict with Prometheus is cast undermines this treatment. Writers on Greek religion have recently debated whether the Greeks thought of  their gods as personalities or as powers.13 Jan Brem- mer in particular feels that the two aspects are complementary.14 How- ever, in our case they work at cross purposes, in that both poems cite Zeus’s “mind” as a basically implacable guarantor of  the world order, while in dealing with Prometheus he is essentially an anthropomorphic character with emotions, as in epic where fickle impulses determine the gods’ course of  action and therefore the fate of  humanity. More precisely, the Theogony poet papered over the conflict inherent in Zeus being omniscient, on the one hand, but also being tricked when Prometheus disguised the bones as meat in the original sacrifice, on the other hand, by saying that Zeus saw through the trick but let himself  be fooled.15 The later poet, perhaps realizing that that solution was unsatis- factory, does not mention the sacrifice etiology, at least not overtly.16 He stresses Zeus’s superior trickery rather than intelligence.17 Still, Zeus’s anger remains. Perhaps an attempt to distract attention from the underly- 12 The jar only became a “box” in modern times, due to Erasmus’s error; see Dora and Erwin Panofsky, Pandora’s Box, 2d ed.

West (Hesiod: Theogony [Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1996], p. 321) argues well that there will have been an earlier story where Zeus was completely fooled. To be sure, G. S. Kirk, The Iliad: A Commentary, gen. ed. G. S. Kirk, vol. 2, Books 5–9 (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1990), p. 5 (cf. pp. 9–10), suggests that Zeus “condoned” the trick because the gods’ diet no longer required meat anyway. How- ever, the passage is clear that he was angry at the deception. 16 Hesiod Works and Days 47–48 begin the narrative by saying that Zeus acted because Prometheus tricked him. It is usually presumed (e.g., by West) that the trick in question is that of  the sacrifice, but that involves the metaliterary assumption that the narrative in the earlier poem is “the same story” as in the later, not just the latter’s point of  departure. The statement may only refer to Prometheus’s general nature as a trickster. 17 See E. F. Beall, “Hesiod’s Prometheus and Development in Myth,” Journal of the His- tory of Ideas 52 (1991): 355–71, at 358–62.

In particular, although scholars often posit that the narrative constitutes an etiology of  the labor featured later in the poem, it fails to make a clear statement that Pandora’s act caused drudgery.19 It thereby seems to me to deny itself  any essential role in prefacing the actual works and days that make up the bulk of  the piece (beyond generating some poetic reflections here and there as a number of scholars have noted). It may only serve as a bridge from the Theogony and its concern with matters internal to the divine sphere in the sky to our poem, whose interests are in human affairs on the earth.20 However, at least that issue will prove to be resolved when the poet throws over the mythic mode of  discourse in the immediate sequel. He says that he will give “another account” (heteros logos, verse 106)21 and “well and knowledgably” at that (eu kai epistamenos, 107). Specifically, what follows consists of  a description of  four past “races” of  humans; a statement in the prophetic mode of  the poet’s present-future, convention- ally called the “fifth race”; a nominal fable where a hawk holds a night- ingale in its claws and says resistance is futile; and a quasi-theoretical discussion of  a concept, dike, approximately “justice.”22 Hartmut Erbse makes a case that this section of  the poem is a coherent account of “Right,” which forms the basis of  the work as a whole.23 Thus logos is 18 For the specifics of  the wordplay, see Beall, “Hesiod’s Prometheus,” pp. 362–64. 19 Labor is not explicitly stated either as Pandora’s result at verses 100–104 or as lacking before, at verses 90–92. Thus, e.g., W. J. Verdenius (A Commentary on Hesiod: Works and Days, vv. 1–382 [Leiden: Brill, 1985], pp. 62–63 [ad verse 9, ponoio]) interprets it as included in the ponos, “pain,” cited there, precisely in order to uphold the etiology interpretation. See further Glenn Most, “Hesiod and the Textualization of  Personal Temporality,” in La Com- ponente Autobiografica nella Poesia Greca e Latina fra Realtà, ed. Graziano Arrighetti and Franco Montanari (Pisa: Giardini, 1993), pp. 73–91, at pp. 88–89. 20 This is how Benardete (n. 5 above) in particular characterizes the difference between the two works (pp. 151–52). 21 This cannot mean that the material to follow will simply amount to another myth (as is held, e.g., by the leading commentator West, as well as by his principal critic Verdenius (on verse 106), for as some scholars have long noticed, the immediate sequel is not a character- driven story and is too abstract to deserve the name “myth” without qualification; see Thomas G. Rosenmeyer, “Hesiod and Historiography (Erga 106–201),” Hermes 85 (1957): 257–85; M. I. Finley, “Myth, Memory, and History,” History and Theory 4 (1965): 281–302, at 287; and Hartmut Erbse, “Die Funktion des Rechtsgedankens in Hesiods Erga,” Hermes 121 (1993): 12–28, at 20. Moreover, although the standard assumption is that the new logos only extends to verse 201, the end of  the “fifth race,” as far as I can tell this view is not based on any substantial consideration. 22 That is, from verses 109 to 285. Verse 108, which some editors excise, says that what will be shown is something about a commonality of  gods and humans; it is difficult to interpret. 23 Erbse, “Funktion des Rechtsgedankens,” pp. 12–20 (coherence), 16, 27–28 (basis). </page> <page sequence="6"> 182 Theism and Mysticism already opposed to mythos, as “words [which] were the sites of  important semantic struggles fought between rival regimes of  truth,” as Bruce Lin- coln characterizes their distinction in the preclassical period.24 And the new logos brings with it a stronger role for divinity. Alain Ballabriga offers the suggestion that the first part of  the section, the races of  verses 109–201, constitutes a correction to the Prometheus-Pandora account that removes its anthropomorphisms much as in the case of  the Book of  Genesis, where the Documentary Hypothesis’s Priestly narrative modernized the archaic Jahwist account of  origins before they were merged to yield the text we have.25 For the most part that is indeed what the section as a whole does. In one place Zeus is said to destroy a race “in anger” because they failed to offer homage to the gods (verse 138), but otherwise his responses to events are unemotional. That is, within the account of  the races alone, either he or “the gods” create the four past races (verses 109–10, 127–28, 143–44, 156–57); he guarantees a good afterlife to the spirits of  the fourth (verse 168); and it is promised that he will destroy the fifth when it becomes hopelessly corrupt (with no emotion stated [verse 180]). That he supervises dike in the theoretical passage is clear, doing so by employing immortal observers to keep watch over court proceedings (verses 253–55), by constituting the father of  the divinized principle Dike (verse 256), and by allotting the faculty of  dike to humans so that they need not behave like animals feeding on one another (verses 274–85; read: like the earlier hawk and nightingale). Another point of  comparative religion may be noted in passing. He- siod’s description of  the corruption and eventual fate of  present humans is often compared with the offerings of  the Old Testament prophets,26 but his eschatology is rather different. At the end, he says, when Envy (Ze- los) will become humanity’s companion, indeed right then, to Olympus from broad-wayed earth, with their white cloaks covering their beautiful bodies, will go to the tribe of  immortals, abandoning humanity, 24 Bruce Lincoln, “Gendered Discourses: The Early History of  Mythos and Logos,” His- tory of Religions 36 (1996): 1–12, at 11. In a recent study of  the word logos, Roman Dilcher (Studies in Heraclitus, Spudasmata no. 56 [Hildesheim: Olms, 1995], pp. 31–40) follows the conventional view that Hesiod means “story” (p. 33) but acknowledges a basic connotation of  rational argument from the earliest use (p. 34). 25 Alain Ballabriga, “L’invention du mythe des races en Grèce archaïque,” Revue de l’his- toire des Religions 215 (1998): 307–39, at 307. 26 See most recently Klaus Seybold and Jürgen von Ungern-Sternberg, “Amos und He- siod: Aspekte eines Vergleichs,” in Anfänge politischen Denkens in der Antike: Die nahöst- lichen Kulturen und die Griechen, ed.

In accordance with polytheism the destruction is left to subordinate principles, but what is striking is the specific daemones involved. We do not hear of  Zeus delegating fire and brimstone to angel analogues as one might expect from the prophet comparison; rather, Envy replaces Shame (Aidos) and Indignation (Nemesis) among people, it be- ing implied that the loss of  ability even to feel a sense of  disgrace or out- rage at the perversions cited earlier in the section (children mistreating parents, right being defined as might, etc.) is what will end the human ex- periment. To be sure, that borders on naturalism in its attitude to divinity: Hesiod has personified social traits that Homer treats in secular fashion.28 What of  divinity in the works and days proper?29 It must be said that at least for the agricultural portion, Nelson’s sense of  its presence is closer to the truth than the skeptics allow, albeit the precise mode of  this pres- ence changes as the poet’s treatment unfolds. Specifically, after an over- ture of  sorts introduced by the Pleiades, the poet begins concrete statements about particular yearly or daily activities, organized into three sections.30 27 Hesiod Works and Days 197–201: ka√ tovte dh; pro;Í ¢Olumpon a ̊po; cqono;Í eu ̊puodeÇhÍ, leuko∂sin favressi kaluyamevnw crova kalo;n, a ̊qanavtwn meta; fuÅlon ≥ton prolipovnt’ a ̊ntr∫pouÍ A√døÍ ka√ NevmesiÍ: ta; de; leÇyetai aßlgea lugra; qnhto∂Í a ̊nqrwvpoisi: kakouÅ d’ ou ̊k eßssetai a ̊lkhv. In this article I translate the Works and Days in such a way as to maintain the words of  a given verse within it, although this often violates strict English syntax. 28 “Shame and indignation” was a standard expression if  we may judge from Hesiod’s use and its citation in the Iliad: Poseidon tells the Achaeans to instill aidos kai nemesis (meaning the capacity to feel them) into themselves prior to a battle (Hom. Il. 13.122). 29 Before that, the section consisting of  maxims of  correct behavior (verses 286–382) con- tains mostly perfunctory citations of  the gods, but one segment (verses 336–41) reminds the audience to sacrifice appropriately, stating that this is the way to ensure that you acquire property rather than having yours acquired. It is of  a piece with the preceding segment deal- ing with appropriate family relations, and with the sequel on treatment of  neighbors, once one realizes that the gods are viewed as part of  the ancestral community. Thus behaving properly toward them is one illustration of  dike among others in the section. 30 Most commentators who consider the structure of  the agricultural portion divide it into three sections following the preface of  verses 383–413: 414–92, 493–563, and 565–617; see, e.g., Jean-Claude Riedinger, “Structure et signification du ‘Calendrier du paysan’ d’Hésiode (Travaux vv. 383–617),” Revue de Philologie 66 (1992): 121–41. I argue for this breakdown in “The Plow That Broke the Plain Epic Tradition: Hesiod, Works and Days, vv. 414–503,” Classical Antiquity 23 (2004): 1–31, but with verses 493–503 assigned to the first section. On the preface itself, cf. as well Francisco Rodríguez Adrados, “La Composición de los </page> <page sequence="8"> 184 Theism and Mysticism The overture’s personified principles apart from the Pleiades include only Atlas, as noted above, and the agricultural goddess Demeter, her “work” (i.e., produce) being cited as something garnered by appropriate labor. The first section itself, nominally dealing with woodcutting and plowing, begins by stating that when the summer heat ends and the autumn rain “of  mighty Zeus” begins, and when the star Sirius no longer weakens people, tree wood is dry and worm-free, so that woodcutting can be car- ried out. Graziano Arrighetti observes that this passage draws on material from all of  the subjects now known as meteorology, anthropology (actu- ally physiology), astronomy (perhaps actually astrology), zoology, and botany.31 Whether it also includes theology depends on whether “rain of mighty Zeus” is interpreted as more than the classical-period figure of speech “Zeus is raining” (meaning not much more than our phase “it’s raining”). Similar expressions appear later: “Athena’s servant” (meaning the carpenter [verse 430]); “the Olympian” may grant full produce if  you plow properly (verse 474); and, again, “Zeus may rain” so as to help the tardy plower (verse 488). Athena was considered to sponsor crafts includ- ing carpentry, but the use of  her name as a descriptive adjective here is sometimes thought simply figurative.32 And to say that one will succeed “if  Zeus grants it” might seem like our modern phrase “god willing,” in- sofar as it is interchangeable with “knock on wood” or similar hopeful expression. However, two statements imply that mention of  the gods in the section is intended in all due gravity. When you first begin to plow: “Pray to Zeus of  the ground and to Demeter the pure / to weigh down to fruition Demeter’s sacred grain.”33 To be sure, this is said in the context of  a de- scription of  the plowing process, which is poetically impressive overall.34 Plutarch, for one, interprets the passage as a whole as saying that if  you must pray, do so in the context of  your own goal-oriented activity.35 None- theless, the arresting first line with its symmetrically placed nouns and epithets impresses us with a sense that the activity it recommends is to be Poemas Hésiodicos,” Emerita 69 (2001): 197–223, at 219–20. Also, he and I in the cited ar- ticle agree that verses 614b–17 are better read as a coda to the entire agricultural portion. 31 Graziano Arrighetti, ed., Esiodo: Opere (Turin: Einaudi-Gaillimard, 1998), p. 435 (on verses 414–47). 32 For example, in the treatment of  farming as figurative by Maria Marsilio, Farming and Poetry in Hesiod’s Works and Days (Lanham, Md.: University Press of  America, 2000), the Athenaies dmoos is a “metaphor” (p. 16). 33 Hesiod Works and Days 465–66: “eußcesqai de; Diμ cqonÇå DhmhvterÇ q’ aÒgn¬Å / ejkteleva brÇqein DhmhvteroÍ ¥ero;n a ̊kthvn.” 34 So, e.g., Nelson (n. 11 above), p. 54. 35 Plutarch Mor. 169b. One Line Short </page> <page sequence="9"> History of Religions 185 carried out seriously, not just on a pro forma basis.36 Then, after saying in a later segment that the tardy plower will have a poor harvest, the poet introduces a proviso that he may be lucky after all: “Now one way, now another (goes) the mind of  aegis-bearing Zeus,”37 so that rain may come in such a way as to make the tardy plower competitive after all. This state- ment seems to point to a fundamental uncertainty in the world order (and as such is tailor-made for interpretative eloquence),38 but the uncertainty surely refers to Zeus in more than a figurative manner. When the other ci- tations of  Zeus and Athena are viewed in this light one must believe that they are in earnest. The feeling is reinforced when winter arrives, even though the Olym- pians themselves are most tacit. The second section deals with the per- sonified north wind Boreas, whose graphically portrayed effects on plants, animals, and humans show that he is certainly not a metaphor. Mean- while, he is easily interpreted as Zeus’s agent: in the Theogony the winds caused by the monster Typhoeus are counterposed to the winds Boreas, Zephyr (west wind), and Notus (south), implying that the latter entities are now on Zeus’s side even though their origin was primordial.39 The third and final agricultural section consists of  five distinct episodes or vignettes.40 In general, apart from the statement at the beginning that “Zeus” has ended winter (verses 564–65, as noted above) they are rather jocular, so that the section is theistic if  we allow the gods a lighter side. They certainly have one in Homer, and it does not negate the serious con- texts in which it is usually found.41 With Hesiod the one other mention of 36 It does not count against this conclusion that Zeus chthonios may have been another name for Hades, as some have said, for if  so Hades is simply Zeus’s under-earth manifesta- tion; see West on verse 465. The Greeks had different cults for a given deity depending on his or her epithet, as with Zeus “most high,” Zeus “the savior,” etc., at Athens; see Bruit Zaidman and Schmitt Pantel (n. 13 above), pp. 177–78. 37 Hesiod Works and Days 483: aßllote d’ a ̊llo∂oÍ Zhno;Í novoÍ a√giovcoio. 38 For example, in the deconstructive literary criticism by Pietro Pucci (Hesiod and the Language of Poetry [Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1977], pp. 8–9), Zeus’s un- certainty here is related to the Muses telling both lies and truth in the Theogony. 39 Counterposition: Hesiod Theogony 869–70; origin: 379–80. Otherwise, only “the works of  Aphrodite,” meaning sexuality, are cited in the Works and Days passage (verse 521), as not relevant to a maiden protected from the wind indoors. It seems to me that the maiden sym- bolizes barrenness and that a certain lack of  sexuality, which some writers have pointed out in the section comprising verses 519–35, reflects a threat by the sky gods to end reproduction on earth.

In princi- ple one could think of  all that as a return to the mythic descriptive mode after it has been dispensed with, but Dawn herself  is given a paean at har- vest time, when you are to rise ahead of  her: For Dawn yes claims a third portion of  the work; see, Dawn furthers the way and also furthers the work; Dawn: she whose appearing sets on the path many a person, and puts the yoke on many an ox.44 This is as if  one were offering praise to the harvest god, so that we should consider Eos a serious divinity. Apart from that, Zephyr rather than Bo- reas is mentioned in the context of  a pleasant summer picnic (verse 594). In addition, the swallow that initiates the first vignette and the beginning of  spring is called “daughter of  Pandion” (verse 568), alluding to the Gould, “On Making Sense of  Greek Religion,” in Greek Religion and Society, ed.

Many of  these works also cite treatments of  specialized aspects of  Homer’s deities. 42 Hesiod Works and Days 609–10: eu®t’ a ̇n d’ ∆WrÇwn kaμ SeÇrioÍ ejÍ mevson eßlq¬ / ou ̊ranovn, ÂrktouÅron d’ ejsÇd¬ rJododavktuloÍ ∆H∫Í. 43 Compare our Arktouron d’ esidei rhododaktulos Eos with Orion heleto rh.

In practice the sheer weight of  the concern to create poetry dealing with the here and now precludes an excess of  attention to Zeus per se in this part of  the poem, but this does not reduce him to a rain god. And the citations of  gods have been relatively high-minded. The pos- sibility of  late rain to assist the tardy plower is simply ascribed to Zeus, without telling us to employ magic by shouting “rain” in order to affect him or whatever else is felt to be the agency, after the manner of  the Eleu- sinian Mysteries; nor is Demeter to be coaxed by mixing a chopped-up dead pig with the seeds before planting, as with the Thesmophoria.47 However, the issue cited at the outset above remains. A fundamentally different religious mode comes into play toward the end of  the nominal sailing section. Prior to this juncture the sailing has invoked the Olympi- ans as responsible for the human lot (Zeus gives poverty [verse 638]) and for nature (Poseidon and Zeus cause storms at sea [verses 667–68]; Zeus causes autumn rain and the disruption of  the sea by the south wind Notus [verses 675–76]) and, above all, they are invoked in the poet’s autobio- graphical aside, where he says the Muses allow him to give the same “mind of  aegis-bearing Zeus” he had previously said was inscrutable (verses 661–62; cf. 483–84). In the process sailing has been treated in relatively positive terms for all its dangers. But another sailing for humans is in spring: Just at the point that first, about as large as a crow setting out makes a track, so large the leaves appear to a man at the top fig branch, then the sea is manageable: this is the spring sailing. I for my part not it praise, for it is not pleasing to my heart; 45 For details, see West on verse 568. 46 On the ill-suitedness, see West or Arrighetti, ed. (n. 31 above). In an article on Hesiod’s voiced creatures to appear elsewhere, I argue that his purpose here is to connote the mythical corpus accruing to the bird as such, not to the specific myth. If  this is correct the segment does not particularly contribute either to religion or to lack thereof  in the poem. 47 For these practices, see Robert L. Fowler, “Greek Magic, Greek Religion,” in Oxford Readings in Greek Religion, ed. Richard Buxton (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2000), pp. 317–43, at 323–24; cf. Burkert, pp. 276–304. </page> <page sequence="12"> 188 Theism and Mysticism it is snatched: With difficulty you may escape harm;  but now even such things as these people do in their ignorance of  mind.48 (The leaves, not the man, are at the top branch.) Nominally this is still about sailing, so that the passage is conventionally considered part of  a “sailing section” beginning at verse 618. In the process the comparison of  crow tracks and fig leaves has been taken at face value and relegated to the status of  a quaint saying.49 However, the crow is of  course a bad omen (we will be told later to avoid giving it a place to perch and caw),50 and the fig tree is also portentous. That the sea associated with the fig branch “is manageable” (ambatos esti ) recalls Andromache’s warning that the enemy could get into the city near the fig tree because there its wall “is scalable” (ambatos esti ).51 This landmark fig at Troy is associ- ated with Hector’s dire fate.52 Another marks the location of  the dread whirlpool Charybdis.53 Thus the totality plants plus animals seems omi- nous when specified here by fig and crow, unlike the combination thistle and cicada in the third agricultural section.54 Further literary nuances add to the impression that the poet here speaks of  an alternative reality, including an alternative experience of  religion. The “spring sailing,” prefaced by the crow, compares with the “spring” for (making sure we have finished) vinepruning, announced by the swal- low to begin the third agricultural section (verses 568–69). Indeed, it is 48 Hesiod Works and Days 678–85: aßlloÍ d’ e√arino;Í pevletai plovoÍ a ̊nqr∫poisin: h®moÍ dh; to; prΩton, o§son t’ ejpibaÅsa por∫nh ≥cnoÍ ejpoÇhsen, tovsson pevtal’ a ̊ndrμ fanhv¬ ejn kravd¬ a ̊krotavt¬, tovte d’ aßmbatovÍ ejsti qavlassa: e√arino;Í d’ ou•toÍ pevletai plovoÍ: ouß min eßgwge a≥nhm’, ou ̊ ga;r ejmåÅ qumåÅ kecarismevnoÍ ejstÇn: aÒrpaktovÍ: calepΩÍ ke fuvgoiÍ kakovn: a ̊llav nu kaμ ta; aßnqrwpoi rJevzousin a ̊¥dreÇ¬si novoio. 49 So, e.g., West on verse 681; Arrighetti on verses 488–89. 50 Verses 746–47. Thus Ralph M. Rosen (“Poetry and Sailing in Hesiod’s Works and Days,” Classical Antiquity 9 [1990]: 99–113, at 110–11), dissenting from literalism, views the crow as a metaphor for a bad poet. 51 Hom. Il. 6.433–34. 52 See Nicholas J. Richardson, The Iliad: A Commentary, gen. ed. G. S. Kirk, vol. 6, Books 21–24 (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1993), p. 123 (on Hom. Il. 22.145). 53 Hom. Od. 12.103. Of  course the fig is different in the Old Testament. Its leaf  symbolizes shame and inadequacy in the story of  the first humans, Gen. 3; see Claus Westermann, Gen- esis 1–11, trans. John J. Scullion (Minneapolis: Fortress, 1994), pp. 251–52. In later material the fig tree stands for prosperity; e.g., Mic. 4:4. 54 The merism of  thistle and cicada at verse 582 at least lacks eerie overtones, whatever one thinks of  the standard view that Hesiod sees the insect positively, like the later Greeks did. One Line Short </page> <page sequence="13"> History of Religions 189 possible that these birds were viewed as rivals.55 Or, if  sailing means poetry, as Ralph Rosen suggests,56 then “another sailing” is other poetry, about something different from the antecedent’s reference. Indeed, the assertion that people act “in their ignorance of  mind” (aidreieisi nooio) employs the exact phrase Homer uses to characterize how Oedipus’s mother behaves in marrying him, violating the primordial incest taboo.57 In such a context, the fact that the poet says that this so-called sailing is “snatched” (harpaktos, the participle of  a verb normally denoting theft by force), but does not say from whom or from what, must mean that it is stolen from the primordial order of  the world itself. Indeed, much of  the poem from this point up to the beginning of  the “Days” portion has the same mysterious aura about it and also suggests a primal order. The im- mediate sequel is a series of  relatively short thoughts on following “due measure” (not overloading a ship or wagon, not marrying a woman when you are too young or too old, or balanced gestures and speech toward others), which can be interpreted as the positive side of  remaining in touch with primal reality. But the negative side is never entirely absent, as with the suggestion that if  you marry wrongly you may get a woman who is “an ambusher-at-dinner: Even if  a man is strong she / roasts him without fire and gives him a raw old age.”58 Much has been built on the construal that the ambush at dinner here is of  the meal (reading deip- nolochés as “gluttonous”) rather than the husband eating his dinner, but it is actually a metaphor for a nagging wife. It is perhaps only clever, but the other figures, “roast without fire” and “raw old age,” suggest some- thing primal (note the Levi-Straussian juxtaposition of  raw and cooked). Then of  course the “due measure” theme evolves continuously into ad- vice of  a nature we now call superstitious, on the order of  not letting a twelve-year-old boy sit on a tomb lest his future virility be compromised. It does not seem that the religious sense embodied in this development has anything to do with the “Mysteries” of  Greek cult attested from later times with their stress on agriculture; rather, it is a survival of  something preagricultural. It is no accident that its surfacing in the poem begins with alternative “sailing,” that is, on water. Water is strongly featured in the negative parts of  the portion that is involved: Aside from disliking the sailing for mysterious reasons, the poet dictates rules with no immedi- 55 There is at least one fable hinting at this; see Ben Edwin Perry, ed. and trans., Babrius and Phaedrus (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 1984), p. 488. 56 Rosen, passim. 57 Hom.

The prayer is not to Zeus (who was covered a few lines earlier), but to the river god, or more probably to the water itself  you gaze at while making it. But as Eli- ade has told us, water is a primal symbol in tribally based cultures, the basis of  things and the purifier, with aspects of  death and rebirth.61 That is to say, particularly in this part of  the poem Hesiod gives illus- trations of  the awe of  water, as a symbol of  the mystical aspect of  reality. To be sure, the transition is not so sharp that Olympian religion is en- tirely absent (we are to wash our hands before sacrificing to Zeus [verses 724–25], albeit “or to other immortals” is added), nor is the inchoate na- ture of  the water symbol absent in the earlier part of  the poem. Pandora is to be made by “muddying” earth with water (verse 61).62 As Balla- briga observes, the winter section involves the interplay of  the basic en- tities of  air, earth, and water,63 and indeed “ever-flowing rivers” supply rain, which performs the contradictory functions of  fertilizing the earth and of  chilling the person caught outdoors (verses 547–56). And of  course the sea discussed in the first part of  the nominal sailing section is danger- ous to one who does not respect it. Still, it is here that the matter comes to a head. 59 Hesiod Works and Days 737–39: mhdev pot’ a ̊enavwn potamΩn kallÇrroon u§dwr / possμ peraÅn prÇn g’ eußx¬ √døn ejÍ kala; rJeveqra / ce∂raÍ niyavmenoÍ poluhravtå u§dati leukåÅ. To be sure, this lyricism is followed by a heavy-handed couplet (740–41), which spells out that doing what is thus forbidden will incur a penalty; one can sympathize with Aristarchus in ex- cising it, although his reasons are unknown. 60 For kallirroon hudor of  rivers, cf. also Hom. Il. 2.752, 12.33; for kala rheethra, e.g., Hom. Il. 21.238; Hom. Od. 11.240; for cheiras nipsamenos, Hom. Od. 2.261, 12.336. 61 Mircea Eliade, Patterns in Comparative Religion, trans. Rosemary Sheed (Lincoln: Uni- versity of  Nebraska Press, 1996), pp. 188–215. Thus I take it Hesiod gives precise rules for washing because it is ritual purification (whether or not he is aware of  functionalist anthro- pology’s observation that such activity constitutes early society’s way of  maintaining phys- iological health and other human requirements). 62 The verb phuro is usually simply rendered “mix” here, but it has a strong connotation of “stain” (with blood or tears) in Homer. 63 Alain Ballabriga, “L’équinoxe d’hiver (Hésiode, Les Travaux et les jours, vv. 493–563),” Annali della Scuola Normale Superiore di Pisa 11 (1981): 569–603, at 592–93. </page> <page sequence="15"> History of Religions 191 It is possible that Hesiod’s less than articulated (and possibly not artic- ulable) attitude toward water anticipates not the Mysteries, but the opin- ion attributed to the so-called philosopher Thales that water is the basis of  the world. There may have been a mystical element in the Milesian school’s opinions on the identity of  the arche, given parallels with the Upanishads.64 Giovanni Cerri has now compared the Presocratic frag- ments with the Indian texts to suggest that stress on the “four elements” fire, air, water, and earth is Indo-European in origin.65 Indeed, Françoise Bader argues from parallels in other languages that much of  the second half  of  our poem itself, including the section in question, reflects the vi- sion of  the Indo-European “Brilliant Seer.”66 That cannot be completely accepted, since the section includes content that was modern to Hesiod (e.g., agricultural tasks requiring iron tools), but much of  the material con- cerning basic elements could be more archaic, so that his poetry about water has ancient roots. Finally, the tension between citing a relatively straightforward numi- nous presence and sensing a mysterious variety in the main part of  the poem is reflected in the “Days” portion as well. André Lardinois points out that “Days” is a natural culmination of  the citations of  specific days in the earlier material as positive entities.67 Hamilton suggests that some structural features are preserved as well.68 But so is the bifurcated reli- gious tendency. To be sure, and notwithstanding a certain tradition hold- ing that “Days” merely continues the “superstitious” bent of  the preceding material, the opening at verse 765 tells us that at least some days are “from Zeus.” Indeed, that can be seen as refreshingly clear-cut after the obscurantism of  penalties for washing in the wrong water and the like just concluded.69 Then, after a short discussion of  certain days that are 64 In particular, Gargi Vacaknavi tells Yajñavalkya that “all this is woven on water, warp and woof ” (idam sarvam apsv otam ca protam ca [Brhadaranyaka Upanisad 3.6]), while Aristotle says the first philosophoi thought the material cause was the “element” and “prin- ciple” of  things (stoichoion, arche) and (on the basis of  presumably oral transmission over the intervening two centuries) that the “founder” (archegos) of  this type of  philosophy was Thales, who specified water (Metaph. 983b). 65 Giovanni Cerri, “L’ideologia dei quattro elementi da Omero ai presocratici,” Annali dell’Istituto Universitario Orientale di Napoli (sezione filologico-letteraria) 20 (1998): 5– 58, at 44–49 and 51–52, respectively. 66 Françoise Bader, La langue des dieux; ou, L’hermétisme des poètes indo-européens (Pisa: Giardini, 1989). She speaks of  verses 497–778. 67 Lardinois (n. 4 above), pp. 328–29, n. 28. Otherwise, the portion cements Hesiod’s ten- dency away from geographic localism, according to Gregory Nagy (“The Pan-Hellenization of the ‘Days’ in the Works and Days,” in Daidalikon: Studies in Memory of Raymond V. Scho- der, S.J., ed. Robert F. Sutton, Jr. [Wauconda, Ill.: Bolchazy-Carducci, 1989], pp. 273–77). 68 Hamilton (n. 2 above), p. 82. 69 Actually, after the “superstitions” there is a segment on avoiding pheme (either “repu- tation” or “rumor”), an entity that comes from humans rather than gods (verses 760–64). Still, it is mysterious as well. </page> <page sequence="16"> 192 Theism and Mysticism overtly holy (citing Apollo, possibly the second most important member of  the pantheon), the poet proceeds to allegations that some days are good for some activities and bad for others, without mention of  divinity (although one can think of  Zeus’s sponsorship as tacit). One can stress the lack of  discoverable rational basis for the poet’s actual choices (pos- sibly stemming from tradition), but that in itself  does not negate them as poetry.70 However, as Hamilton has discovered, a new section begins in the middle of  verse 797.71 To be sure, the latter part of  this second section consists of  more statements that some days are good for some activities, neither mentioning divinity nor denying that it still governs the matter, up to verse 822, when some lines of  a summary character begin. None- theless, the section in fact begins with mysterious matters, telling us that we had better check with the bird signs before marrying on the fourth of the month ([verse 800–801],72 even though it had been called a “holy” day at verse 770 in the previous section) and then citing Oath and the Fu- ries as noted at the outset of  this article. Of  course the Greeks were never entirely satisfied with the lofty reli- gion represented by the frieze at the Parthenon, as institutions like the Eleusinian Mysteries attest. Undoubtedly this is in part because, as the late archaic period philosopher Xenophanes held, “Homer and Hesiod” undermined the authority of  Zeus and the rest with anthropomorphic por- trayals, whereas Herodotus says it was the same combination that “gave the Greeks their gods.”73 “Homer” can perhaps be excused since neither the Iliad nor the Odyssey purports to be a theological tract, although “Hesiod’s” Theogony is another matter. But in any case a different prob- lem compromises the treatment in “his” Works and Days (whether or not both poems were by the same person or collective): the age-old human love of  the occult. One must recognize that in this poem of  continuously varying thematic form, the various sections will necessarily play differ- ent roles in the work, so that there is no particular reason to expect con- sistency among them at a metaphysical, including theological, level, only at the level required to make the piece cohere qua poetry. As to that, the author is presumably concerned to offer a broad account of  the human experience and feels the need to treat both realities: that which can be 70 Within the view that the poem constitutes wisdom literature, the maxims here at least provide definite recommendations rather than leaving the listener with no guidance as to what day an activity noted in the earlier part of  the work is to take place. Better, taking it to be ac- tual poetry, some of  the material seems to me to play the role of  implying that if  for some rea- son you cannot carry out a task on a given day, you can do something else. 71 Hamilton (n. 2 above), pp. 79–81. 72 Actually, the section begins at verses 797b–99, with a generality about avoiding trouble that cannot be interpreted precisely because it is uncertain whether verse 798 is spurious. 73 Xenophanes, fr.
