<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Empire of Masks: Pluralism and Monism in Politics and Architecture SAMIR YOUNES '...not the same is correct in politics as in poetry.' Aristotle'. Of all the opposing dualisms in cultural debates, pluralism and monism have particularly occupied our minds on account of their wrenchingly polarizing effects. Whereas there seems to be a general agreement regarding monism as a reductive mentality that holds that only one single and unique approach is valid for a particular subject, there is much disagreement and uncertainty regarding the meanings of pluralism. Indeed word-concepts like liberalism, eclecticism, rela- tivism, and subjectivism are sometimes confusedly used as vague synonyms to pluralism in contemporary journalistic and academic parlance. Following an assessment of the general cultural meanings of these word-concepts, this essay will discuss three other sets of issues which have now become inter-related. First is that most divisive of artistic issues, namely the association between political intentions and architectural character. It is the thesis of this essay that this association is spurious, that it derives from a monistic mentality which has caused insuperable obstacles in the teaching and practice of archi- tecture. Second is the distinctions and commonalties between political freedom and artistic freedom. Third, is the adverse effect of inappro- priate associations between political content and artistic form in gen- eral and, in particular, the perceptual impairment of the processes by which buildings come to be endowed with their suitable character. Six Words: their uses and abuses Epistemological monism2 asserts the belief in an enclosed and fixed system of thought, be it in politics or the arts, that excludes 1 Poetica 1460b 13n. 2 Epistemological monism is here distinguished from fundamentalism, because the word fundamentalism designates a theological current within American Protestantism in the early 20th century, taking its name from a 1909 brochure entitled 'The Fundamentals'. The followers of this current define Christianity by a certain number of essential beliefs such as biblical infallibil- ity, hence the literal and fixed meaning attached to their view of biblical texts. doi:10.1017/S0031819104000439 02004 The Royal Institute of Philosophy Philosophy 79 2004 5 33</page><page sequence="2">Samir Younes external influences or feed-back, rejecting all views but one view. Epistemological pluralism maintains that there are diverse tradi- tions, forms, -and their attributes in politics and in the arts. Pluralism accepts many opinions whose concurrence or competition will shed light on diverse aspects of the same phenomenon. However, pluralism does not necessarily mean the acceptance of any possible opinion. In other words, pluralism is distinguished from indiscrimi- nate permissiveness. Liberalism adopted the example of various political systems which committed themselves to the separation between church and state as a reasonable proposition upon which to base a societal rule of conduct that avoids past wars caused by religious and political intolerance. Liberalism operates based on keeping a certain neutrality vis-ai-vis the multiplicity of agreeing and contradictory political and artistic views. Liberalist thinkers intend to maintain an ever-expanding realm for personal freedom of expres- sion, politically and artistically, and immediately warn of the spectres of tyranny when the issue of limits to personal freedom arises. But as was mentioned in the case of pluralism, desirable though this intention may be, there are cases when a corrupted view of liberalism in politics and the arts takes hold. It is once our liberal views become extreme, e.g. indiscriminate neutrality, or once we become paralysed in our fear of being accused of tyranny, that we risk allowing certain views to destroy the very milieu where liberal- ism thrives. For example, though we may believe that convictions cannot be forced, that a diversity of opinions is of great value in the pursuit of ethical truths and artistic truths, that we are ready to admit that our strongly held convictions are fallible, and that all of this is preferable to conflict, we must not loose sight of the verity that tolerance is not a proposition of infinite expansion. The state cannot without contradiction to its raison d'etre maintain an unlimited toler- ance of its internal enemies. Analogically, the arts cannot without contradiction to their raisons d'etre maintain an unlimited tolerance of the artist's personal freedom when such a freedom aims to harm the very milieu where this art thrives. Eclecticism implies that subjective views are selected from many traditions and places, and, like liberalism, it leaves open-or unre- solved-the question as to whether these selections are to be synthesized within a coherent system. Relativism recognizes the role of varying socio-political forces in determining diverse individual or collective values of cultural phenomena. It maintains that a cultural phenomenon may or may not have value in itself; it is only signifi- cant for an individual or for a society. Such a view rejects cultural- or cross-cultural-universals in an a priori manner. But, relativism is 534</page><page sequence="3">Pluralism and Monism in Politics and Architecture an outcome of historical forces, not a political or an artistic principle that governs political or artistic practice. Confounding an outcome with a principle amounts to a confusion between effect and cause. Finally, subjectivism asserts that value is not a property of things in themselves, but rather that value resides in the observing subject. The ebbs and flows of public discourse have intertwined the meanings of these six terms and cast deep implications on cultural phenomena. We briefly examine some of these implications in order to demonstrate that although monism can be regarded as an extrem- ist phenomenon, there are forces opposite to monism which are just as extreme. If, on the one hand, one is to accept the idea that cultur- al phenomena are significant in themselves, one can be a relativist but not a subjectivist. On the other, if one is to reject the idea that cultural phenomena are significant in themselves, then one can be a relativist and a subjectivist at once. However, once scepticism enters, contradictions develop, especially in the unconstructive bent of mind that sees no closure to sweeping sceptical discourse. For exam- ple, if one sceptically rejects the very existence or validity of cultur- al universals and their applicability to the present, then one cannot without contradiction be a sceptic and a pluralist at once. Because a pluralist, whether in agreement or disagreement with the idea of cul- tural universals, stills holds the view that such ideas exist in a plu- ralist milieu. Radical scepticism can abuse pluralism, and the status of knowledge deteriorates when radical scepticism and relativism combine. For to be sceptical about the reliability of the truth content within a certain area of knowledge, and at the same time to hold the view that knowledge is completely relative, leads to a life without convictions, a life where doubt never comes to a closure. Note how this particular view has proliferated in education, and how in their pursuit of indiscriminate neutrality, educators teach relativism. Only, relativism itself is not neutral, and indiscriminate neutrality is not tolerance. Are all available choices equally fundamental, equally authoritative and justifiable? Taking such a corrupt view of neutral- ity, leads into the usual errors of relativists, in that they deny uni- versals absolutely and then claim absolute validity for their denials! In other words, how could relativists allow no authority to universals while claiming that relativism should be universally valid? It is for the same reason that modernism negates transcendent values while unquestionably accepting the notion of a pervading zeitgeist for example. In this sense, the socio-political desirability of encouraging pluralism should not blind us to the possible abuses of pluralism; and while pluralism thrives through private opinions (doxae), these in turn abuse democratic pluralism when individual meanings and 535</page><page sequence="4">Samir Younes expressions are used to exclude cultural universals. In such a way, the abuse of pluralism can lead to the proliferation of nominalisms (miniature monistic beliefs), and contribute to the collapse of art as a symbolic mediation between universally held traditions and indi- vidual views. Keeping the different meanings of these terms in mind, may prove useful when addressing cultural phenomena; for at their core lies the relationship between the rational autonomy of the individual (the culture of intellectual freedom); and the collective rationality of the group (the civilization of the sense-in-common). Each cannot exist independently from the other, that is if a society aims at main- taining a certain sense of equilibrium. An extremist (monistic) prac- tice of individualism consecrates separatist views, and leads to the tyranny of the private. An extremist (monistic) practice of collec- tivism enforces sameness, and leads to the tyranny of the public or the state. Accordingly, using politics or the arts to promote a complete rational autonomy to the individual citizen or architect to the exclusion of what may tie this individual to larger traditions, is as limiting and sectarian as the argument that says that individual views are to be subjugated by the views of the state. Both are monis- tic practices. The Face of Politics and its Architectural Masks Architecture has been beleaguered by two kinds of monism. One kind of monism manipulates architecture, or any art, for the ends of a political ideology, as if it were the only possible representation(s) of this ideology. The other, manipulates architecture, or any art, to serve the ends of those who build and teach a particular architectural ideology, with the belief that their architecture is the only valid or legitimate architecture. This happens when a political or an artistic ideology present themselves as the inevitable, and sole legitimate choice that excludes other choices, as was and is the case with modernism. The first kind of monism applies to those who abuse architecture by associating one of her traditions with their political ideologies or aims, with the intention of masking their pur- poses. Such was the Third Reich's abuse of one of the traditions of classical architecture-one deriving from the nineteenth century academic tradition. In this case, a civilized architectural mask was used to hide an otherwise horrific political face. Albert Speer, the major architectural figure of the Reich, clearly saw and used architecture as a representation of the Nazi state's political 536</page><page sequence="5">Pluralism and Monism in Politics and Architecture ideology. The Nazi propaganda's abuse of cultural forms also included symbolism, as well as all the visual and rhetorical arts, with the aim of convincing as many unsuspecting minds as possible that the collection of images (as masks) with which the Reich surrounded itself was a direct representation of its political ideology. The deceptive syllogism was: the more attractive the mask, the more appropriate the ideology! Fortunately, this extremism is a rarity in history. However, in so doing, Nazi propa- ganda subversively manipulated the mind's propensity at associative relations, even if there is no connection between a cul- tural form and the supposed political content forced into that form. In fact all the cultural forms used by the Reich emerged within different and earlier contexts, having no association to the Nazis' sinister purposes. This intervention effected a very deep schism between form and content, because if any form can be dissociated from its originating context and attached to any content, then signifier and signified have collapsed, and the symbolic nature of architecture or art has been rendered dysfunctional. However, did not Washington, New Delhi, Berlin, and the Soviet Union, concomitantly use similar forms of classical architecture to represent their different political ends? And are the different polit- ical meanings assigned to the same architecture not a proof of her political innocence? This was the core subject of a much misunder- stood and much maligned book on Albert Speer by Leon Krier3. This book showed that although the Reich used classical architec- ture as its most civilized mask, most of its buildings remained over- whelmingly industrial. And while modernist historians and archi- tects have singled out classical architecture because of its abuse by the Nazis, they remained curiously silent about the simultaneous use of classical architecture by other regimes, some of whom were considered democratic, e.g. the so-called federal presence in Washington. In fact much in contemporary architectural discourse, influenced by the writing of a modernist view of history, abound with statements that explain away architecture as a result of politi- cal aims. Such a mentality sees the planning of Baroque Rome as a representation of the supremacy of papal power; it portrays much in seventeenth century architecture from the angle of absolutism and bourgeois values; it asserts that the architecture of plantation homes in the Southern United States represented the dominance of a racist class; that the architecture of the British Raj was a representation of colonialism; that the architecture of Washington 3 Albert Speer, Architecture, 1932-1942; Archives d'architecture moderne, Bruxelles, 1985.

These architectures, as well as others, are consequently condemned and dismissed on account of the condemnable political circumstances that paralleled their use. This modernist discourse then commits two serious errors. First is the assertion that architecture and her history can only be inter- preted in one way: following the methods of modernist historiogra- phy. Second, is when modernist architects and historians compare a selection of some of the traditional buildings of the most oppressive regimes of the past, with a selection of modernist buildings from the most tolerant regimes of the present. However, an intellectually honest view of history shows otherwise. Modernists are ill at ease about admitting that the headquarters for the Fascist party in Como, the Casa del Fascio, was a modernist building designed by G. Terragni (1936); while of two of the extolled figures of the modernist architectural establishment, respectively, Mies Van der Rohe and Le Corbusier, the first had openly sought to work for the Nazis, while the second made overtures to work for the Vichy government in France, and produced plans (the Voisin Plan) that prefigured the evisceration of much of Paris in order to make space for his skyscrapers. One must also mention that while modernist historians and archi- tects acclaim the architecture of the modernist avant-garde in the Soviet Union', linking this architecture to an emancipatory and progressive ideology of labour, they remain silent again about the classical architecture that was practised in the Soviet Union well into the 1960s5. Moreover, the modernist embrace of futurism pre- sents a peculiar case. On the one hand modernism absorbed most of futurism's artistic beliefs such as the vehement break with tradition; the rejection of the continuity of space and time in representation in favour of immediacy and dynamism; the radical belief in the redemption of science and technology; and the cult-like apotheosis of modernity. On the other, after World War II, modernist architects and historians sought to separate the work of futurists from their exaltation of violence and their enthusiastic associations with the rise of Fascism in Italy, by simply remaining silent about these extremes. These examples show that monistic beliefs such as modernism, can associate or dissociate political or artistic content ' For example the work of I. Chernikov, V. Tatlin, V. Krinski, I. Leonidov. 5 For example the work of K. Alabian, V. Simbirtsev, A. Dushkin, A. Poliakov, A. Shchusev. 538</page><page sequence="7">Pluralism and Monism in Politics and Architecture depending on the most advantageous circumstances. Here, intellec- tual integrity is gravely compromised. But the situation is more severe because once a monistic belief becomes the establishment belief, it tends to dominate in a totalitarian manner. This brings us to the second kind of monism, the one practiced by those who write, teach and build an architecture that sees itself as the inevitable pinnacle of a historical development that dismisses all other architectures past or present, with an intolerant sleight of hand. Such was modernism's view of itself as the unquestionable, and irrevocable ideology that is sanctioned by the metaphysical cer- titude of an all-pervasive zeitgeist-a kind of unalterable historical determinism. Modernism's self-consideration as the sole cultural presence whose technologically determined forms represented the only form of modernity possible for a modern society, quickly became a kind of worship and heroic self-assessment that consid- ered its enemies as dangerous heretics to be destroyed with the zeal of the inquisition. Thus, the modernist establishment banned the teaching of any other tradition in academia6, and violently opposed the practice of any traditional architecture. For example, Joseph Hudnut's influence, and to some extent Walter Gropius', during their tenure at the Graduate School of Design at Harvard between the 1930s and 1950s, resulted in the elimination of the teaching of architectural history, which also included the destruction of plaster casts of classical sculptural and architectural models as well as a proscription on history books7. Equally monistic, was the application of this ideology to the arts and sciences regardless of their different intentionalities and values; and the hasty adoption of such conclusions, precipitated a major crisis of identity in the arts. For they became absorbed into a techno-scientific teleological realm which announced with high certainty, that it was leading the world toward a future perfection, even if such a contention remained to be proven, and despite spectacular failures. It is for this reason that the recent renewed calls for pluralism came largely as a revolt, a will to be emancipated from modernism's totalitarian control over cultural production. Monism 6 There are today over one hundred schools of architecture in the United States who teach various forms of modernism. Of these, only two schools have recently been able to emerge and teach traditional architec- ture and urbanism: The University of Notre Dame, and the University of Miami. 7 For a detailed account of this story see Jill Pearlman, 'Joseph Hudnut's Other Modernism at the Harvard Bauhaus', in Journal of the Society of Architectural Historians, 56:4, December 1997, pp. 452-77. 539</page><page sequence="8">Samir Younes has been a defining force in the teaching and practice of modernism, and the homogeneous application of its products, irrespective of regional and national characteristics. It is important to note that though politics and architecture are each justifiable according to its intrinsic set of criteria, the opposi- tion between warring architectural views nowadays, is one which is fought less on artistic grounds and more on political grounds; with the tacit and flawed understanding, that the position which has gained the upper hand politically, and claimed an exclusive ethical imperative, must necessarily have the better architectural position! It is also significant that while modernist architects denigrate tradi- tional architecture by falsely associating her with undemocratic regimes, they remain unable to define just exactly what is a 'demo- cratic architecture'. Of Two Freedoms: The Political and the Artistic The above considerations lead to the following questions. How does artistic freedom operate within a purportedly democratic milieu? And what of its relation to political freedom? Some hold the view that the distinctions between political freedom and artistic freedom are so fine that they are impalpable. Yet, as we shall see, that there are similarities does not necessarily imply that there is an equiva- lence between these two freedoms. We examine political freedom first. The American Declaration of Independence considered freedom to be an essential, causal constituent of human nature, a natural principle.' Freedom, was therefore not an effect which emerged from the circumstances of history, even though this freedom can only be experienced within the realm of historical circumstances.9 Natural law then, is a principle which precedes and engenders civil law and criminal law, which in turn guarantee freedom and the notion of duty that every individual recognizes toward others with- in a larger concept of the good. This good however, cannot be rele- gated to a matter of individual interest alone. For as such, the good would be pursued solely with respect to parameters which are relative to the individual. In this case, when interests conflict, x An opposite idea, is the Kantian view that freedom was not an innate quality, but rather a task that humanity poses for itself. This task is earned and maintained with difficulty. 9 See Westfall. C. W., 'Architecture as Ethics,' in Building Classical, R. Economakis, Ed. (London: Academy Editions, 1993). 540</page><page sequence="9">Pluralism and Monism in Politics and Architecture conflagration arises, because duty would be a matter based on the individual's self interest. Freedom here, is concomitant and proportional to that individual's power. Accordingly, the form of government that groups such individuals can be no more than an aggregation of private interests. Here, we are far removed from the concept of the common weal. Contrariwise, the moral principle spoken of above, suggests an authority of reason, within which individual duty and interest, and the larger idea of justice, come from a highly valued acceptance of the true and the good by a group of diverse individuals with different interests. This is so, because such a form of government guarantees equal freedom and justice to different individuals with divergent backgrounds and aspirations. The authority of reason, then, is a normative value which guarantees the cultivation of free- dom, while keeping power in check. This authority is given legiti- macy by virtue of it being agreed upon by all who see in it the just protection of their individual as well as their collective freedoms. Thus, a law has authority, because we know why it is just and what is the form of this justice, and because we willingly accept its authority over our actions. Consequently, the concept of freedom as an agent of reason, perceiving the true and the good,-e.g. in moral judgment-supposes a concept of duty. 'It is not the absence of motives that qualifies the individual's ethical freedom, but the char- acter of these motives that marks free action.' remarked Ernst Cassirer.'0 This duty derives from a general idea of the good, and is committed to realize this idea. Here, the attainment of justice is the aim of government, and the hope of its realization rests within the 'good life', of which the polis is a promise.'1 Reason and ethics are also the guides for power which cannot act as its own higher princi- ple. Hence the necessity for law, to regulate power, and uphold the true and the good by guaranteeing political freedom, and within it, artistic freedom. In such a perspective, political freedom is more encompassing than artistic freedom and is a pre-condition to artistic freedom.'2 Now, politics may encourage, discourage or prohibit various artistic traditions, and sometimes the very same 10 See The Myth of the State, (New Haven &amp; London: Yale University Press, 1946). Chapter XVIII, p. 287-288. 11 On the Aristotelian concept of the 'good life', see Westfall's 'Politics', in Van-Pelt, R. and Westfall, C. W. Architectural Principles in the Age of Historicism (New Haven and London: Yale University Press, 1991). Chapter Two. 12 This is not to suggest that political freedom is the only condition for artistic freedom. For art, is a phenomenon that is ontologically linked to the human character. 541</page><page sequence="10">Samir Younes artistic tradition finds itself identified with political regimes separated by diverse ideologies having little to do with the ideal state we described above. Political freedom and artistic freedom share a common aspect with respect to the concept of external authority. In this sense, a principle is held to have normative value, on account of its univer- sal applicability to a variety of individual contingencies which may or may not resemble each other. It gains its historical validity from having been the object of reflection of many minds from different provenances, and from the experience of centuries. Thus it is reason that principally validates the authority of a nation's laws, or an artistic principle. The withdrawal of the authority of reason will precipitate the collapse of that principle. Collapse will also occur, if the authority of an artistic principle or an art form is imposed through the exercise of political authority. However, an artistic principle remains in the domain of artistic truth even if a political entity has abused its authority by prohibiting it or by tyrannically applying it."3 In such situations, artistic freedom may be seen as a way of overcoming the constraints that might arise from political situations. Conversely, in a state where freedom thrives, the arts help to shape, satisfy, represent and inspire spiritual and intellectual pursuits, and lesser pleasures. Art can also be used as one means-among many-for a sought- after freedom; and the French Revolution's call: 'Aux armes! Aux arts!', poignantly attests to this effect. Freedom can be a means to attain an end such as the 'good life' or the true. Freedom however, becomes an end in itself only when it is threatened. But if the understanding of freedom is exclusively relegated to a sensus individuationis as opposed to a sensus communis, then the resulting political form is that aggregation of individual interests which we mentioned above. This can lead to the tyranny of the individual or of the group, or to what we called elsewhere: 'the tyranny of the private'.'4 Such a view, transforms the constitutional guarantee that secures the citizen's inalienable natural rights, to confer a higher value to an individual's will-interpreted as 'right'-over the collective. This position has serious implications over the concept of 13 Conversely, the fact that we live in a period where individual will and freedom is regarded as more important than the collective will, does not for example invalidate the truth, that the city's aim tends toward the better- ment of all. 14 See Younds, S.

Tagliaventi Ed., (Roma: Gangemi, 1994). 542</page><page sequence="11">Pluralism and Monism in Politics and Architecture freedom and its limits, because an individual will, if not animated by a larger concept of the common weal, will necessarily interpret an affirmation of the public interest as an imposition. There is a marked difference between merely accepting another individual's freedom and rights, and between understanding the individual's free-will within the shared purpose of a larger common weal which is represented by a government or a city.'5 The danger is that the first case leads to the 'whatever someone wants to do', simply because such a view of collective living seems to be defined by nothing else than the existence of a multitude of individual wills, never amounting to a larger view of the 'good life', save pragmatic matters of taxes, front yards, sewers and clean streets. From here arises the confusion between pluralism as the willful acceptance of various traditions, rules-political or artistic-and forms, which is a consequence of the tolerant humanism of a democracy, and an indiscriminate acceptance of any interpretation and opinion, which is done in the name of democracy, but is ultimately a kind of ran- dom permissiveness. Is it surprising, then, that contemporary artists who apply this view to artistic freedom produce work of a primarily private meaning-proudly calling it the self-referential sign-to the near exclusion of work and meaning destined for the public realm? Such a practice is of course protected in a democracy, even if some artists are bent on denying the sensus communis upon which a democracy is based. Therefore, the care that a democracy takes to protect self-expression extends even to those who give more prominence to their individual expressions and meanings, to their private doxa, while concomitantly excluding the larger symbols and meanings of their culture. Here, a democratic society pays a high price when the doxa as a tyranny of the private, turns against this very same society and assaults it on two fronts. First, by claiming that collective symbols and meaning no longer exist, and asserting that all we can really have are private doxae. This extension of an extremely sceptical view of the world, is characteristic of a bent of mind which is more disposed to reject than to affirm. This bent of mind would probably agree with Sartre's contention that 'hell is others', whereas 'hell' may very well be the estrangement and isolation from others, like Descartes' solitary man observing the world. Second, by implying that no points of view can be taken for fear of being interpreted as logocentric, or from an inane identifica- tion of the millennial search for collective meaning with tyrannical regimes of the right or the left. In this mentality, anything that side- 15 Westfall, Ibid. 543</page><page sequence="12">Samir Younes steps larger meanings is permissible, hence, the rabid proliferation of nominalisms. Here, the confusion between democratic tolerance and 'indiscriminate toleration't6, contributes to the collapse of art as a symbolic mediation between the universal and the particular, the enduring and the contingent. But the millennial traditions of art and architecture, tell a different story where collective and individual meanings and free- doms thrived in their mutual confirmations and tensions. Much of what art depends on for external meaning can be seen in its relations to views about nature, to a truth, and to a reality. And much of what art depends on for internal meaning can be evidenced for example, in its relations to a larger artistic tradition and the artist's intellectual freedom. Artistic freedom here, gains its value from the dialectical movement between these relations. Thus, there are various genres of artistic freedom. One genre is seen in the ways that art selects disparate beauties from nature, and composes them to produce objects which claim to surpass her creations. Hence, the notion of the ideal, seen for exam- ple in Zeuxis's painting of Helen, and Vasari's natura vinta dall'arte. Art then generalizes, in order to discover and reveal the essential. Painting, sculpture and architecture, all rely on anthropomorphism as a natural paradigm. Thus, conventions based on nature, are natural themselves. Art here, freely imitates a selection of aspects of nature which are held as artistic truths, and relates the fiction of its own artifice to that truth. This free imitation is perhaps best expressed in the Aristotelian view that art imitates things as they ought to be. Poetry states truth in a variety of allegories and helps access certain truths in ways different from the approaches of science. Far from being lies, poetic fictions freely allude to another order of truth: a verisimilitude which may or may not relate to a concrete experience. The more poetry departs from truth, the more perspectives and shades of meaning it provides. In this, we sometimes delight in the great departure from a truth, and sometimes we reject depicted actions which appear too improbable, even for poetry. For example, in Le Cid, Corneille, desiring to respect the Academy's rule that a play takes place in a fictive one day period, assembled the most unlikely sequence of events. Rodrigue, the hero, who was engaged to Chimene, proceeded in that one day, to avenge the honour of his father who was insulted by Chimene's 16 'Indiscriminate toleration' is a phrase coined by Demetri Porphyrios in Classicism is not a Style.

Afterwards, Rodrigue led an army to defend the city from the attacking Moors, whom he defeat- ed. Later still, he returned to the royal palace to receive honours from the king and reconcile with and marry Chimene! H. Greenhough's sculpture of Washington as a Caesar and A. Canova's Bonaparte as Mars, involve many fictions and parallels. The same can be said of Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres's Apotheosis of Homer, with its extraordinary gathering, featuring personifications of the Iliad and the Odyssey, as well as Pindar, Virgil, Dante, Longinus, Raphael, Racine and Moliere. By contrast, a depiction of a historical setting can rely on factual truth as in Canaletto's views of Venice and London, or depart drastically from factual truth while still appearing 'real'. Consider for example, Canaletto's capriccio where, three Palladian buildings: the Basilica, the Palazzo Chiericati, and a project for the Ponte Rialto, were brought together in a characteristically Venetian composition. In fact, his depiction appeared so true, that according to Francesco Algarotti, many Venetians asked about the location of such a area of the city which they had not seen before."7 John Soane's plan for the Bank of England, especially as painted by Joseph Gandy, alludes at once to a parallel to the Roman Forum, and to a culture so admir- ingly conscious of the inevitable passage of time, that it pre-figures the future state of its own architecture in ruins. Such capricci allude to another order of truth and a genre of artistic freedom. By con- trast, other conceptions of art reject allegory altogether, as in the realism of the Dutch group portrait. But what of the connection between the links and boundaries"8 which are proper to each art, and the artist's intellectual freedom? For instance, how is an architect to depict a naval victory in a mon- ument dedicated to it? And more precisely, how free is an architect to commemorate such an event within the limits of architecture? Comparatively, how could a painter or sculptor approach the same 17 A. Rossi discussed this 'analogous Venice' as a locus of pure architec- tural values. See his 'L' Architecture de la vi'lle.' (Paris: L'Equerre, 1981). pp. 218-20. 8A link connects at least two distinct entities, anchoring them to a place or a tradition, thereby assuring their identities, without excluding the possibility of their separation. A boundary guarantees identity through closure and containment in time and space, to at least two distinct entities, without excluding the possibility of their informing each other; thus guar- anteeing at once: passage and distinction. Such a dialectic allows various fields or arts to inform each other, without eroding the boundaries that assure for each its proper character, thereby maintaining intrinsic content (immanent meaning) and extrinsic significance (transcendent meaning). 545</page><page sequence="14">Samir Younes subject ? Both the painter and the sculptor can depict in a painting or a bas-relief the factual happenings, the number of ships, and the intensity of the combat. The painter and the sculptor can also use allegorical figures of war, pity, pain, magnanimity or ruthlessness. Their arts allow for this kind of analogy. But, such is not the case in architecture. The architect may have the rare luxury of choosing the location for the monument. The architect may also combine motifs which have historically been associated with victories and armies, such as the triumphal arch, or perhaps a temple front. Bas-reliefs and even allusions to a ship's prow in some details may be used. Still, to achieve this commemoration, the architect can only attenu- ate the boundaries of architecture to a certain extent, beyond which the limits of architecture will be eroded. For instance, it would be totally undecorous to erect a building in the shape of a ship. For buildings are not ships, and unlike ships, they are static objects. It was this clear understanding of the relationship between artis- tic freedom and the links and boundaries between the arts, between what an art can and should represent, that led A. C. Quatremdre de Quincy-prophetically-to caution against falling in two errors. The first 'consists in stepping beyond his own art to seek, in the resources of another, an increase of imitative resemblance"'. The second 'consists in seeking the truth short of the limits of every art, by a system of servile copy, which deprives the imitation of the image of that fictious part which constitutes at once its essence and its character"'. In the final analysis, artistic freedom can be said to be indissociable from the links and boundaries which are suitable to each art. Thus, a universal application of the axiom: ut pictura poe- sis, should be taken cum grano salis; for what is available to poetry's modes of fiction is not to painting or landscape, and there is less of it available still to architecture. Following this discussion, one may ask: if the artist or architect's intellectual freedom is indissociably linked to the boundaries of their art, then what are the inward parameters influencing this free- dom? First, as a thinker/maker, the artist or architect is free through reason and constrained by the causes and effects of the material world. For example, a pure aesthetic judgment is the more free in so far as it is less dependent on sensory perceptions. Second, the mind can be seen as having constructed and apprehended the phenomenal 19 Quatremdre de Quincy, A.C.

Thus, the confluence of the empirical experience of sensory perception, as well as the mind's own ordering systems, are then projected onto a part of the phenomenal world. Observe for instance how the a-priori unity and suitability with sensory material, are inherent in the mind while it reflects upon itself and while it connects present experiences with earlier ones, and with the material at hand. Similarly, the architect's intellectual freedom is influenced by the way the mind associates present and past ideas, perceptions, models and motifs in an ars combinatoria which includes collocation, composition, disposition and distribution. These words and others, infer that the architect reflects on three relationships at once. First, the building's internal order, the Vitruvian ordinatio, dispositio and distributio.2" Second is the aesthetic qualities of architecture, the Vitruvian symmetria, eurythmia and decor. Decor, here is seen in the agreement between the building's character and its destined purpose. Third, the build- ing's decor in the sense of external relationship with a tradition or with the cultural context at large. Decor, here addresses propriety according to custom, suitability to the subject and utility of pur- pose. Propriety in the aspectus or appearance of a building, is achieved through probatio or approval, and auctoritas, the authority of general acceptance. Thus, the architect works at once with the material of a tradition as well as within it. The scope of this freedom is evidenced in the distance between a type or a model, a tectonic allusion to a theory of origins, the faith- fulness or departure from propriety, the selectiveness and mastery of the composition of elements, experience, introspection and self- criticism, and of course, the architect's own genius. Freedom is in the art's ends, and less so its means, which have to conform to these ends. Similarly, the attainment of justice is the aim of a government and not its means. All of this proves that the freedom to relate the fictive to the true and the real in the arts, while protected-or not-by politics, is an evidence of another genre of freedom, than the one allowed by politics. So, while there is a genre of freedom in the thematic, compositional and allegori- cal methods of the arts in general, there is another order of free- dom still, which is proper to the essence, ends and means of each art. This propriety extends to national characteristics, social mores, climatic parameters, regional customs and tastes as well as individual taste. 21 Vitruvius, De Architectura, II, 1, 2 and II, 2, 1. 547</page><page sequence="16">Samir Younes Architectural Character Since the French Revolution's call: Aux armes! Aux arts! the use of cultural productions toward political ends, and the assumption that cultural productions have always aimed toward political ends, became a willful project; more specifically, a project of modernist historiography. Another parallel project from the 18th century: I'architecture parlante, or speaking architecture,-passing by the structuralist codes of the late 20th-began by announcing a metaphorical association between architectural character and social significance, which quickly became an association of equivalency. Since the confluence of these two projects beginning in the late 18th century, and most acutely in the 20th, the notion of artistic mean- ing came to be considered by many, as subservient to social and political determinants, especially in books that surveyed art and architectural history. In such way, many have assumed a causal relationship between political aims, ideologies and their changes, and the artist or architect who produces (re-presents) an artistic or architectural character based on a perception of the world-views represented by these ideologies. This particular view was pursued with relentless zeal by modernist historiography in the teaching and practice of art and architecture, and in the transformation of the museum institution accordingly22. However, even the most cursive examination of architecture dur- ing the American Revolution (1777-83) and the French Revolution (1789-99), for example, shows that in neither case, was there a revolutionary architectural character per se. The same architectural traditions were practiced before, during, and after these revolutions. Pierre-Charles L'Enfant, with the valuable advice of Thomas Jefferson, probably did not consider architectural character to be a representation of political ideology, for they would surely not have selected Versailles, Vaux-le-Vicomte, Fontainebleau, Rome, and Karslruhe as models for parts of the plan of Washington. An inscription on the lintel above the door of a Virginia Court House reads: 'Obey the Law'. But does this make this lintel democratic, as opposed to another lintel with no inscription? Or is the lintel not a tectonic element that holds a wall, and spans the distance between two vertical supports? 22 In fact, some modernist thinkers,-e.g. Andre Malraux in the late 1 960s-, applied the reverse aspect of this phenomenon in that they began to approach the study of political historical phenomena based on a discourse deriving from modernist artistic theory. 548</page><page sequence="17">Pluralism and Monism in Politics and Architecture With the exception of the transformation of the interior of Ste. Genevieve into the French Pantheon, the French Revolution did not produce its own architecture. A revolutionary pageant at Lyon appropriated as its symbol a folly-a Doric temple front-that had been built some years earlier, in the garden of a banker", for pur- poses having little to do with the aims of the Revolution. Moreover, if architectural character was indeed a reflection of political ideology, then one would expect the main sources that explain architectural intentions namely, the architectural treatise, to reveal this linkage. Yet, the extensive tradition of architectural treatises shows that their authors did not justify architectural character based on political ideology. Rather this justification was based on the suitability of architectural compositional elements (arcades, colonnades, fenestrations, walls, roofs, and their proportional relationships), with respect to a building's purpose (be it a public building: a church, a market, a court house; or a private building: a palace, a house) and that of its direct context (a street, a square, a hill, a valley). That architecture is influenced by socio-political factors is unde- niable, but to consider architectural character as symptomatic of social and political determinants, betrays a sadly common quandary: those who study architecture confuse their own method of analysis with the manifold ways in which architecture operates. Unfortunately, and recently, the above-mentioned confluence has merged with the dissociative force of political relativism masquerading as artistic pluralism. In other words, those who see architectural character as a representation of socio-political deter- minants, while asserting that these determinants are in a constant state of disagreement and change, surely assume that there is no possible agreement on architectural character, and condemn archi- tecture to a dissociative state of fragmentation. This is why the understanding of architectural character is severely impaired today. For the very idea of relativism excludes that most needed social contract (the sensus communis) upon which a culture(s) bases its artistic meanings; while modernism sought, achieved, and globally established a systematic proscription of the knowledge of traditional architectures, side by side with a rejection of architec- tural character that was not determined by modernist ideology. 23 See Robert Rosenblum, Transformations in Late Eighteenth Century Art, Princeton, 1967. The French revolutionaries also appropriated the Phrygian cap with its forward-curving peak, as a symbol of their revolutionary spirit; yet it still remains that the Phrygian cap was not made for that purpose. 549</page><page sequence="18">Samir Younes Consequently, after decades of modernist hegemony, those who make and use buildings today, are faced with a difficult comparison regarding the meaning of architectural forms. On the one hand, there is the abject symbolic poverty of much in contemporary archi- tecture; on the other, there is a millennial heritage of world archi- tecture(s) that abounds with corresponding or conflicting meanings about the same architectural forms. Today, because of the collapse of the symbolic function in architecture, we have a massive confusion between such clear architectural concepts as type, charac- ter and style. Thus, any rectification of this problem regards addressing the putative meanings with which the mind endows architectural forms, especially in relation to pluralistic and monistic forces. Architectural meaning and character (internal to the architect's mind, and external with respect to the receptions and conventions of society) are not an arbitrary matter. To briefly categorize this thinking, one may distinguish between two sets of architectural characters24: essential and distinctive. The first can be understood as the ways in which a building's volume(s); the elements of its com- position, exterior and interior; proportions, or the relations between its constitutive parts; the assembling of its materials which transcend mere construction; its colour(s), natural or painted; its decoration; render its purpose evident. Purpose here, refers to the expressive architectural characteristics that endow theatres, churches, libraries, markets, palaces, or houses with their own definite identities and hierarchies. The second, or distinctive char- acter, pertains to the relationship between the elements mentioned above, within different urban, cultural, and climatic contexts. This is understood clearly when a comparative examination of buildings reveals their commonalities, and their regional differences or specificitles. That the mind is able to willfully emphasize, omit, use or abuse meanings of architectural forms for political ends is true; although as we said earlier, architecture remains politically innocent of her abusers' aims. That a pluralist political milieu willfully embraces a multiplicity of meanings is equally true. But that these two factors are used to suspend, exclude and suppress the mind's propensity to endow architectural forms with meanings that derive from the very The issue of architectural character has been clearly elucidated by A. C. Quatrem&amp;re de Quincy. See Samir Youn6s, The True, the Fictive and the Real.

Such a monis- tic mentality puts architecture in a position of being a puppet to legitimizing forces having little to do with her nature and purpose as an art. For architecture results from a confluence between two traits which are ontologically linked to the human character: dwelling and making. And the architect dwells as a maker of form, building the city within nature, and architecture within the city, while poetically elevating mere construction to the level of art.
