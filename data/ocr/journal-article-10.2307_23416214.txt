<plain_text><page sequence="1">Dennis Hall Listomania: The List as Popular Culture Icon The word entered my mind, without my consciously having heard or read the expression before, a result of the work Susan Grove Hall and I are doing on book on American Icons. We became acutely aware of the power and resonance of lists as we struggled to develop a list of over a hundred icons to be included in this collection of short essays. People we discussed the list with quickly moved from the indicative to the imperative mode; our list invariably generated not only conversation but sometimes heated argument, revealing gender and generation differences, among many other cultural investments. While we talk about icons a great deal, we try to avoid discussing the list itself, now in the later stages of development, with our fellow iconomaniacs. But I suppose that deep down I knew "listomania" must have been circulating "out there" for a long time and not with punning allusion to the nineteenth-century popular passion for Franz Liszt or Ken Russell's 1975 flop on the same theme. You see, I still own and have often perused, if not exactly read, both editions of the immensely popular People's Almanac (1975, 1978), and the 24th chapter of each edition is devoted to lists. Moreover, I seemed to have forgotten that David Wallenchinsky, Irving Wallace, and Amy Wallace in both editions of the also very popular Book of Lists (1977,1980) freely use the terms "listomania" and "listomaniacs"</page><page sequence="2">50 Hall to describe the abiding interest, if not a consuming passion, that they share with all but the most passive of human kind. As H. Allen Smith (in Book of Lists xvii), Louis Menand, citing Aristotle or was it Parmenides? (in The New Yorker), and others have pointed out, the human being is less accurately defined as an animal capable of reason or able to use language or given to laughter than as a list-making animal, a creature apparently incapable of survival without making lists of one kind or another. Indeed, lists are everywhere to be found, not only in the many books of lists (David Wallechnisky is not alone in the economic exploitation of this human propensity) but also from the poetic catalogs of Walt Whitman to the comic routines of David Letterman's "Top Ten" lists (and its many predecessors and imitators) to the top ten lists that flood the press at New Year's to the "all time" top 25 and top 100 and top 1000 lists of movies, books, plays, record albums, celebrities, best and worst dressed people, children's names, roses, breeds of dogs, and the like which periodically feed a voracious popular press. Moreover, the World Wide Web has fueled this human passion for lists with an unprecedented technical lever age and democratic spirit. "Catalist," for example, is a website list of Listserv lists. One may find a several lists of phobias—hundreds from ablutophobia to zoophobia. The web has transformed the "who's who" phenomenon from a relatively narrow interest within distinct professional groups into what we now call "networking," with someone offering lists of people involved in every industry and occupation, diversion, and perversion known to humankind. Virtually every specialized periodical from Accounting Today to World Trade Magazine publishes a list of the 10 or 50 or 100 of the most powerful or most influential or "best" or "top" or "important" people in its realm of interest. At a recent PCA/ACA meeting, a session, heavily attended, focused on each speaker's list of the best A western movies ever, the best Β westerns, and the best TV westerns; the session generated more discussion and dissension than any other I attended at the meeting. Some of us are old enough to recall seeing on TV Joseph McCarthy holding up a piece of paper and declaring that he had in hand a list of known communists working in the government or to recall Richard Studies in Popular Culture</page><page sequence="3">The List as Popular Icon 51 Nixon's enemies list. I remember seeing (and exactly what it looked like is seared into my mind's eye) the National Legion of Decency's list of cur rent movies posted on the bulletin boards of my Catholic grade and high schools, with the list of "condemned" movies providing sure fire recom mendations. My desk and yours are crowded with lists of "things to do." Many, perhaps most of us, at least enter the grocery store with a list, make pack ing lists for trips, compile Christmas lists, maintain lists of birthdays and anniversaries to remember. Cathy Guisewite's comic strip-particularly its run up to Cathy's wedding-could not function without playing on lists and list making. Some of us, after the precedent of George Washington or Jay Gatsby or Mother Theresa, may even make lists of things we ought and ought not to do. Many of us suffer under the direction of such lists, while making others suffer under the direction of lists we impose. Nothing good or bad or important is without its list; nothing indifferent, however, war rants a list. No human activity or interest or fear or desire of any signifi cance is without its list in the household, the interest group, the workplace, the neighborhood, the political party, the country, or beyond. The entries for "list" in an unabridged dictionary (nine in Webster's Third International) provide better dictionary reading than do most words, and we make our way through such earlier but related senses of the word as to gratify and inclination, to pay attention, edge, and border, and field of competition before getting to such more familiar senses of the word as roster, index or catalog, to enumerate, to categorize or clas sify, or to declare to be. It may be objected, of course, that a list is not sufficiently visual to be a genuine "icon," that it remains too abstract, is not sufficiently concrete, is too much a verbal and mental construct to keep company with such hu man icons as George Armstrong Custer, Marilyn Monroe, Michael Jor dan, or Michael Jackson or with such anthropomorphic icons as Uncle Sam or Mickey Mouse or Rosie the Riveter—with which we are more familiar and comfortable—or even with such iconic things as the Empire State Building, the Coke bottle, the Hershey bar, or the Ford Mustang. 28.1 October 2005</page><page sequence="4">52 Hall But we all do know what a list looks like, recognize it as a visual object. We recognize its fundamentally vertical rather than horizontal char acter, its pattern reflecting a paradigmatic rather than syntagmatic con struct. The success of Microsoft's Power Point program, I am convinced, is owning in large measure to the ease with which it allows the visual presentation of a wide variety of "bulleted" lists and so legitimates the avoidance of syntactical structures. Clearly, all icons are not created equal; some are more powerful, more salient, doing more cultural work than others, and often doing a different kind of cultural work. But the list, qua list, for all of its individual variation, I want to argue, rises to the level of popular culture icon, stand ing many, if not all, such tests of popular iconography as: surviving change over time, stimulating use in ritual behavior, embracing contradictions, trig gering memory and nostalgia, reflecting generational differences, prompt ing disagreement about meaning, and—perhaps most importantly—ex hibiting rich metonymic resonance, that is, embodying associated ideas that allow a list, simply by virtue of its being a list, to deliver meanings into the contexts in which it appears, meanings beyond the simple utilitarian functions of a roster or an enumeration of items. The list delivers meaning quite apart from what it nominally contains. The list, of course, has a long history from the Code of Hamarabi and the Ten Commandments to the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, the genealo gies of royals and commoners to the lists of the celebrated and the damned, ancient and contemporary. There are significant pleasures in these simple texts. Lists mediate between the abstractions of law, history, family, and fame and the concrete particulars of adultery, Black Death, King Henry, and William Shakespeare or the names on the Vietnam memorial wall, and the names and faces on the playing cards that circulated among sol diers in Iraq. This play between the abstract and the concrete is reflected in some of the common associations, teaming with contradictions, that any list bears: authority, definition, hierarchy, description and prescription, order and direction among, I suspect, others. Studies in Popular Culture</page><page sequence="5">The List as Popular Icon 53 The list suggests authority. The makers of lists either legitimately possess the authority to do so or assume the authority to do so. Parents, for example, have the authority to make a list of prohibited behaviors for their small children, but a brother will view his sister's making such a list as a usurpation of power. And lists also confer authority, as when we make the honor roll or the promotion list or appear in the organizational chart. Or they deny it, as when we do not. Some lists, of course, specifically condemn, as do the annual tax delinquency rolls or the lists of America's most wanted criminals or the lists in fashion magazines (invariably photo illustrated) of notorious fashion victims. Not to make some lists can be both pleasure and achievement. Indeed, the resonance of authority in a list is sufficiently great that it tends to shift the burden of proof from the maker of the list to the challenger of the list itself or of an item on the list. The list of prohibited items of dress in a high school, for but one example, may set students to objecting to not being allowed to wear rags or baggy trousers or low rise jeans and so allowing the whole question of a school dress code to be begged. So too, a bulleted list of twelve outcomes measures for English majors-or neighborhood beautification or city recycling or air pollution control or responsible stock investment-very often inverts the axiom that they who assert must prove, shifting the burden to those who object. Hence the affection for lists among the powerful But this very authoritative quality includes, in good Denidian fashion I suppose, the very seeds of its own displacement. The number of elabo rate jokes that depend upon the rhetoric of the list, as is clear to readers of Jonathan Swift and of the humor pages on the Web, is legion. Undermin ing these associations of authority is in large part responsible for the suc cess of Letterman's Top Ten list routine. There is something subversive about presenting a list of ludicrous causes or effects or characteristics with such authoritative fanfare. The power and authority of the list is, at least in current practice, unstable; it is very often kept in play. Lists define far more effectively, if not more efficiently, than do ma nipulations of genus and specific difference and accounts of typical char acteristics. An enumerative definition seems to be the real thing, while a 28.1 October 2005</page><page sequence="6">54 Hall genus and species definition feels like an escape we make when we are overwhelmed by too many things to count. The gratifications of something solid and affirming in lists, no amount of abstract taxonomy can replace. I count the people in my tribe, my friends and enemies; I can only hope to define by characteristics the citizens of my nation, or those likely to be my friends or enemies. Richard Nixon found comfort in an enemies list, not in an understanding of the characteristics of his enemies. The primitive satis factions of lists defy philosophy, which may help to account for their ubiq uity in American popular culture. Such lists, of course, do not so much define realities as present alternative realities, and they expose many, per haps all of us, to the tender mercies of the growing profusion of lists. Related to this defining quality is the list's capacity to establish exist ence, the sense, as the Third Unabridged Dictionary puts it, of the list to declare to be, the list as creating word. "Let there be light" in Genesis is the first item in a not terribly long but crucial list. When people, places, and things have been listed, they and the categories to which they belong are culturally constructed. A place on the roster of the church or club or team or school or corporation or professional association goes a very long way toward establishing one's identity, one's reality. To have one's name stricken from the Book of Life is to cease to exist. But this central principle also motivates the profusion of lists; there is a list somewhere for everyone. They are like T-ball trophies or university service awards or entertainment industry honors; anyone can get on a list; some people get on them even as they try to avoid them. One's place within lists points to the nearly inescapable association of lists with hierarchies and values. Lists, a lot like modern dictionaries, are both descriptive and prescriptive constructs. Often a list purports only to describe what exists, to provide an enumeration of reality; but no sooner than it appears, the list is taken as prescription, used to construct reality and evaluate it. Hard upon the concern about even being on a list follows the anxiety about place on a list. Whether one is concerned about one's self or children or friends or one's favorite movie star or saint or cultivar or baseball team or brand of beer or college or university or contestant for Studies in Popular Culture</page><page sequence="7">The List as Popular Icon 55 Miss America or any of the innumerable possibilities, place on a list is important, a matter of value and, as a consequence, a matter of conten tion. The more arbitrary the criteria for placement on a list, it seems, the more intense the struggle for place. The less arbitrary the criteria, the greater the claims that they are capricious by the low or displaced. Lists seem to have an axiological imperative all their own. Indeed, so great is the power of a list to impose hierarchies of value that we explicitly go to extreme lengths to impose order of appearance or alphabetical order or some other principle of organization upon lists in order to avoid such judg ments. The effort is to no avail, for the Cole Porter Principle prevails: if "You're The Top," you are the best no matter what principle put you at the top. Here again, the proliferation of lists undercuts this association. If one does not like one' s place in a list, then one may with relative ease create a new list in a new category; the situation is like the characterization of bridges or mountains or buildings; everyone of them seems to be at or near the top of a list of longest or highest or biggest of its kind or circum stance: "This bridge is the second longest suspension structure east of the Mississippi, constructed of steel made of scrap iron." Lists can deliver order and direction, as many can attest who resort to lists of things to do in a particularly confusing week or use checklists to assure that important routines are met. A list can provide for one's self and for others a sense of an ending and a basis for evaluation. A list can be a powerful stimulus to dialogue and reflection, alone or in the company of others. And lists I think-at least those self-created ones-are predomi nantly a middle-class passion, for the very poor with little or no control over their environments and the very rich with a great deal if not total control, have relatively less need of lists, as of other kinds of assurance and insurance. The vast middle of America employs lists in an effort to control self and, to the degree possible, environment, and thus engages the list as an agent of self-definition, of identity formation. The penchant for lists is exhibited by Robinson Crusoe and Moll Flanders, by George Washington and Jay Gatsby and Bill Clinton in their youth, in the Boy 28.1 October 2005</page><page sequence="8">56 Hall Scout handbooks and in the whole range of self-help literature from Charles Atlas and Norman Vincent Peale to Alex Comfort and the latest accounts of the five, ten, fifteen, or twenty habits of successful people. These lists, however, tend to define what is valued more clearly than to explain how to achieve it; they have their eye more clearly focused on prizes than on processes, all their claims to the contrary notwithstanding. The American passion for instrumental knowledge, the sheer bulk of "how to" discourse, particularly in American popular culture, collapses enumerations of what counts for pleasure or success or happiness or in fluence or whatever end is desired into an undifferentiated mass. Too many lists often create disorder and misdirection, as those many people who spend more time on making lists of things to do than on getting things done can attest. All the paraphernalia that attends getting and being orga nized often enriches Office Depot and Staples at the expense of one's control of self and environment. And the resort to simplistic lists of steps in many, perhaps most, self-help books, is often a sign of indeterminacy, if not confusion. Lists, I submit, are a kind of intellectual comfort food. We enjoy lists because we associate them with agents of direction and environmental control, authority, definition, clear value, and the like dispositions that Americans continue to hold in high esteem. But lists provide the pleasures of taxonomy and axiology without many-in some cases any—of the de mands of rigorous analysis, whether we make and use our own lists or employ the lists of others, whether these lists attend to the trivial or the profound. Lists, particularly in their popular manifestations, are very often masks, convenient and satisfying substitutes for those very dispositions and disciplines we admire. Lists tend to oversimplify likeness and difference in an interesting way. Lists emphasize likeness and overlook difference within their own boundaries, and tend to overlook likeness and emphasize difference out side their boundaries. To be on a ten best (or worst) dressed list—or a list of the town's outstanding volunteer workers or the state's most wanted criminals, or a list of the top 100 albums of the decade or the 25 worst Studies in Popular Culture</page><page sequence="9">The List as Popular Icon 57 shows in the history of television or the university' s list of the ten best teachers or the student government association's list of the ten worst teachers—fore grounds quantitative likenesses and backgrounds, often even erases, qualita tive differences. Lists appear to fix the flux, and as a consequence are, in many respects, a modern rather than a postmodern tick, and I think the current passion for them is yet another in the long list of modernist responses to postmodernism. Ironically, however, a proliferation of lists contributes to the very insta bility of meaning that this impulse seeks to counteract, and so contributes to the condition of postmodemity. Lists traffic in associations of security that are in high demand in a climate of intellectual and political insecurity. To employ distinctions John Cawelti applies to popular artifacts in "The Concept of For mula in Popular Literature," lists are more formula than form, more conven tional than inventional, more reassuring that challenging. That said, their profu sion contributes to the climate of cultural insecurity. Function as a mediating device, is, I think, central to understanding all icons, and is the source of their resonance. Lists, as do all icons, perform their mediating function because they foreground the material; in this case that ty pographical, vertically formatted roster of nouns or phrases or sometimes even whole sentences. Moreover, lists, despite their being made up of words, perform much, perhaps most, of their work in a way more like the non-verbal functions of icons than the symbolic functions of language; that is, they attempt to forge relationships and understandings that cannot be expressed adequately in the conventions controlled by syntax. They seek a resonance of associa tion-inclusion or exclusion, degrees of proximity and remoteness, likeness within the category and difference without—that either cannot be expressed in the acts of predication that syntax demands or cannot as adroitly or effi ciently be expressed in syntax. This characteristic may account for the intense interest in icons in contemporaiy American culture, as it grows increasingly disaffected with niceties of conventional language, especially predication. The list, then, I take to be a cultural space for play and in play, a venue that is not entirely free of language and that does not fully engage language. To put the point in other terms, lists engage the uses and gratifications of lan 28.1 October 2005</page><page sequence="10">58 Hall guage in a sufficiently satisfying way, without entangling either the list maker or the list consumer in the complexities or personal, intellectual, or cultural de mands of a fuller exercise of language. The list is a cultural venue especially suited for the exploration, for the reaffirmation, and for the destruction of relationships. While differences in degree, of course, may be very great, lists are in kind paradigmatic in their function; that is, they put existing relationships, the realm of the syntagmatic, into play and present the maker of the list and the consumer of the list with a structure of possible relationships, the realm of the paradigmatic. The list allows, even compels, one to explore possible utter ances, possible stories, possible lives, possible identities, even multiple identi ties. And, any list, for all of its associations of authority and definition, is open to challenge by an alternative list, by the relatively simple and widely acces sible, means of inclusion and exclusion. Relatively simple, that is, compared to exercises of syntax. The list is a signally loose cultural artifact, despite all of its' 'modernist'' associations of determination, definition, and authority. By virtue of its profu sion, it helps to sustain "postmodernism." Once remarkably unified in its meanings and associations, the list has slipped into the very condition of postmodernity that many felt its use might resist. Moreover, the list has be come fragmented and contingent, pointing less to structures of actual meaning, to fixed relationships, or to determinations, than to structures of possible mean ings, to sets of contingencies, to indeterminations. Every person is now his or her own maker of lists, participant in the struggle for authority and determination in the culture. While this democratiza tion of list making is not the equivalent of the Gutenberg revolution, it is akin to it. The list, like so very many popular icons, materially signs the schizophrenia of the postmodern condition.
