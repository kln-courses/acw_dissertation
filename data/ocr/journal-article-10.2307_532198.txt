ISBN 0-521-44913-8. reviewed by Allan Chapman Wadham College, Oxford OX1 3PN, UK Professional historians of science approach their subject from a variety of standpoints, which are no doubt as diverse as those from which practising scientists approach theirs. One approach, or set of approaches, that has become especially prominent over the past 40 years is that of the philosophy and sociology of science, in which the motivations and cultural assumptions of the scientist are examined as a way of setting the business of scientific research within a broader social and intellectual context. One of these 'schools' is 'Constructivism', in which it is argued that science is not a pure activity that liberates 'truth' from its matrix of confusions in the same way that Michelangelo claimed to liberate his statues from their gross marble encrustations, but is itself a social process. For scientists, no less than politicians or clergymen, come to their careers from a variety of motives: the advancement of pure knowledge; its practical application to industry; altruism; a desire to defend intellectual territory, obtain a professor- ship, or attain Fellowship of The Royal Society. This willingness to look at the social and cultural motivations that lie behind scientific endeavour is sharply contrasted with what many modem scholars see as the more old-fashioned, progressive view of 'tell[ing] our Whiggish stories about how our ancestors gradually crawled up the mountain on whose (possibly false) summit we stand' (quote from Richard Rortly, p. 1). Therefore, instead of seeing science as a forever onwards and upwards ascent from primitive superstition to absolute understanding, the new histor- iography views science as an intellectual 'construct' that is 'invented' and 'rein- vented' both by its practitioners and by the perceptions of the intellectual public at large. Professor Jan Golinski's 'extended essay' is an attempt to examine and place within context the various schools or styles of constructivist history of science that are around at the present time. He does this by starting with a detailed Preface and Introduction to the topic itself that lay out the subject in a way that would be useful to an undergraduate or postgraduate student. He proceeds to discuss Constructivism's 'challenges to the classical view of science', which he identifies as the more traditional pro- gressive model. Six chapters then follow that trace Constructivism from the sociological and philosophical writings of Thomas Kuhn, through ideas of what constitutes a scientific discipline, method and discourse, to studies on the interpretations of scientific evidences. The 'truth' status of instrumental evidences is discussed, along with the problems of 404</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews interpreting such 'definitive' things as astronomical photographs or geological charts, and the book concludes with a look at how shifting cultural changes influence intellectual priorities within science. Professor Golinski admits that he is not equally sympathetic to all the schools under discussion, and that a critical awareness is always essential, especially when dealing with conflicts between the neatness of theory and the heterogeneous nature of primary historical evidence. I could not agree more with his caution, especially on the last point. Yet in spite of Professor Golinski's genuine scholarly concern to present, delineate and argue the Constructivist approach, I could not drive out of my mind the persistent question: 'What is it really all about, and what is it saying that is new?' For instance, the old-fashioned Whig history of Lord Thomas Macaulay or Sir Arthur Bryant, beautiful as it is to read, is no longer how academic historians write political, ecclesiastical or economic history. 'The Triumph of Pax Britannia' or 'The Triumph of Steam' are as dated as historical metaphors as 'The Triumph of Experiment over Superstition'. Just as other branches of historical scholarship have taken other cultural forces beyond specific 'triumphs' on board, so too have historians of science. Quite simply, the best history of science scholarship of the past few decades, be it in the study of the roles played by instruments, learned societies or technology, or in the field of scientific biography, has not been about heroizing; yet it has not by any means been about self-conscious 'Constructivism'. What I feel Professor Golinski does not really explore is the difference between historical scholarship on the one hand and the sociology or philosophy of history on the other, for I think the difference is a very important one. At the heart of this distinction is whether history is seen as a literary art grounded in the seasoned and experience-based evaluations of individual scholars, or whether it is perceived to be a social science, working within the parameters of a delineated 'methodology', a 'paradigm' or an 'epistemology', susceptible to 'modelling' and perhaps postfactum predictions. I would suggest that it is essentially from the sociological and philosophical branches of historical scholarship that concerns with 'Con- structivism' and its intellectual cognates spring. What I would most strenuously deny, however, is that this is the only type of contemporary history of science scholarship that is saying anything original or worthwhile, and that other approaches are either old-fashioned or Whiggish. For when reading (often with difficulty) much Constructivist, Deconstructionist, postmodem et al. studies in the history of science, I find the way to be persistently strewn with stumbling blocks. The first and most conspicuous of these stumbling blocks is a superfluity of jargon words, and the second is the profoundly 'in- house' character of the discourse itself. A third obstacle is the use of both the above techniques to state the seemingly obvious in ponderously constructed sentences, as though the reader were being presented with shafts of insight coming down from on high. I had to wrestle mightily, for instance, with the sentence 'The conflation of semiotics with ontology seems like a failure to distinguish between reinscribing the accounts of scientists themselves and giving a detached sociological analysis' (p. 41). I then showed it to an ecclesiastical historian, an English literature scholar and 405</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews novelist, and a Classical linguist, hoping to gain enlightenment. I received none! I suppose the heavy jargon of the 'new' history of science stems from its erstwhile claims to being a social science. Because historians practise an art, they feel that good, plain English, French, or whatever their language, is a sufficiently acute medium of analysis and communication to say all that their researches require them to say. Perhaps this derives from the historian's basic predilection for the peculiarly idiosyncratic character of human creativity rather than for underlying metaphysical tendencies. Yet because social scientists aspire to a systematic exactitude when it comes to unravelling the deliberations of mankind, they search for a nomenclature that parallels the exactitude of the equations of the physical sciences. It is this search for a precise nomenclature, I suspect, that leads them to the above-mentioned in- house style of writing, in which sociological jargon words and copious references to fellow scholars (many of whom are unknown to non-sociologists) not infrequently reduce their texts to a bewildering quagmire of words-to all but the cognoscenti. Of course, this style of discourse is not new in the history of science, and even as an undergraduate in the early 1970s I quickly got to know those scholars whose writings were as clear as starlight, in contradistinction to those whose words reminded me of the dark dust bands that blot out parts of the Milky Way. Modem students are also aware of similar contrasts when tackling their reading lists. Indeed, when reading such texts, I have always been reminded of the proclaimed intentions of the newly founded Royal Society 'not [to] regard the credit of Names, but Things'. To 'reject all the amplifications, digressions and swellings of style: to return back to the primitive purity, and shortness, when men deliver'd so many things, almost in an equal number of words. They have exacted from all their members [the original Fellows of The Royal Society] a close, naked, natural way of speaking: positive expressions; clear senses; a native easiness; bringing all things as near the Mathematical plainness as they can: and preferring the language of Artizans, Countrymen and Merchants before that of Wits and Scholars' (Thomas Sprat, 1667). This way of thinking was encapsulated in the Society's motto, Nullius in Verba. Is the history of science about the study of documentary evidences, surviving artefacts, and trying to come to an under- standing of, let us say, the peculiarities of circumstance, motivation and talent that led to a bookbinder's apprentice of the Regency period becoming one of the foremost physical scientists of his century? Or alternatively, is it about social tendencies and trying to divine the paths of those creative streams that run through whole cultures, demanding a convention of expression of its own? Indeed, it is both, though it is, in my view, incorrect and inadmissible for the sociologists and philosophers to presume to seize the intellectual high ground and dismiss other styles of thinking and expression as Whiggish or old-fashioned. What Professor Golinski does, however, is provide a guide through the often dense and prickly thickets of 'Constructivism', identifying the different approaches of scholars working in the field, and supplying a comprehensive bibliography. In spite of the differences of historical style, which I suspect exist 406</page><page sequence="4">Book Reviews between Jan Golinski and myself, I would very much agree with his essential premise that scholars should see science as a human cultural activity. On the other hand, we should be careful not to go too far down the path of relativizing science, for its activities have produced undeniable fruits in the real world-modern medicine, the hydrogen bomb and space exploration, to name but three-which demand a status as physical phenomena, and not just as sociological constructs.

McMenamin Department of Earth and Environment, Mount Holyoke College, South Hadley, MA 01075-6419, USA Crucible of Creation's narrative ranges through the Burgess Shale, a sedimentary deposit that has become a palaeontological purlieu for studies of evolution. Conway Morris describes the transformation of Cambrian animals by passage through a furnace of ecological conflict. Hungry Anomalocaris shadow-ing this book's cover exemplifies such pressures of ecological change. Crucible's main arguments have been raised before and are still convincing. Nevertheless, important questions remain. Conway Morris clings to a conventional view of the Ediacarans as ancestral to the Burgess Shale animals. Crucible's defence of the convention (pp. 27-30) seems unlikely to endure, as accumulating evidence favours Trevor Ford's algal (metacellular) interpretation of Ediacarans. If Ediacarans are to be removed from phylum Animalia, who then emerges alive from the crucible? True ancestors of the Cambrian phyla were humble forms known only by their fossilized tracks and trails. Crucible neglects a thorough discussion of the tracemakers who ultimately inherited the Earth. Conway Morris's imaginary expedition to the Cambrian seafloor affords him an opportunity to indulge in creative speculation. This type of thought experimentation is essential for generating fresh hypotheses, and Conway Morris should be thanked for setting a good example. Thus we learn that Thaumaptilon is able to retract into its stem for protection (p. 83; an idea hard to reconcile with a proposed link between Thaumaptilon and amyous Ediacarans) and that soft-shelled Aysheaia protects 407</page></plain_text>
