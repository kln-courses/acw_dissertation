<plain_text><page sequence="1">Sixty years ago, American Museum of Natural History anthropologist Clark Wissler began an important trea- tise on masks with the phrase quoted in this title.1 His goal was to inform the museum's general audience about a genre of artifact that in "our own civi- lization and time" might be seen as "something childish, something scarcely to be considered respectable," or "a frivolous object" of entertainment used by "infantile" and "benighted" "sav- ages" (1950:1-15). Wissler noted the broad spectrum of the world's peoples who have made and used masks over the ages. He urged his readers to recog- nize the donning of masks as a religious "impersonation" of "mythical human beings or their animal counterparts," and masked performance as a reenact- ment of the acquisition of critical ritual and technological information (1950:22- 23). Wissler's reference to masks as an "old trick" is not to a deception from a cultural insider's point of view, then, but to a truly felt if ironic event-that is, one of "deliberate contrast of apparent and intended meaning" (Morris 1969:692). More recently, anthropologists and art historians have reiterated, improved upon, and extended the discussion of masks to include data and theoretical positions unavailable to Wissler and other earlier writers. Herbert Cole and his colleagues organized the exhibition "African Arts of Transformation," for instance, for which they wrote of the way the person wearing a mask often "becomes an animated but hidden vehi- cle for meta-human, spiritual expres- sion" (Cole et al. 1970:8). They asserted that "a transforming 'costume' is much more than a mere covering-up or dis- guise. The masker, like his followers and his audience, forgets his human person- ality, ... [as] his character and behavior fuse with those of the spirit he creates, the spirit he becomes" (1970:24). Although Cole makes no reference to Wissler's work, Wissler's notion of impersonation lies at the heart of Cole's position concerning masks. The etymol- ogy of the word makes this clear: the prefix im- indicates "causative func- 1. TABWA BEADED MASK, ZAIRE/ZAMBIA BORDER AREA.

In the jargon of Western psychology, religion, and phi- losophy, the masked performer effects or experiences what might be called a catharsis, an epiphany, or an ontological shift. In so doing, the actor can be said to make tangible what is otherwise inef- fable, and to "express the inexpressible without betraying it" (Heinz Politzer in Crossan 1976:250). David Napier has recently written that "throughout the anthropological literature, masks appear in conjunction with categorical change" (1986:xxiii). Transformation occurs in a deliberately and dramatically created liminal period of ritual, when, as Victor Turner wrote (1970), performers are "betwixt and between" more ordinary states or cate- gories of being. The masked person "is and is not a human being. So trans- formed, the new being is saying: 'I am not myself"' (Cole 1985:16). In this curi- ous ambiguity, maskers are free to experiment with the definitions and constraints of their social life that they may take for grahted in more usual cir- cumstances (Turner 1970:105). Yet, as Napier observes (1986:xxiii), "the spe- cial efficacy of masks in transformation results, perhaps, not only from their ability to address the ambiguities of [particular, personal] point of view, but also from their capacity to elaborate what is paradoxical about appearances and perceptions in the context of a changing viewpoint" for society as a whole. It is paradox, "the acceptance of what empirically is not," that allows formulation of hypotheses and recogni- tion of change: "we are aware that something is no longer what it was" (Napier 1986:1,3). The contributions of Cole, Turner, Napier, and other writers aid our under- standing of masks as objects and of masked performance as social process, as will be demonstrated in this study of Tabwa masks. There is a dimension that is either missing or given insufficient attention in most of this literature, how- ever: the use of masks as "agents of ide- ology" (Layton 1981:43) during times of radical social change. The transforma- tions that masked performances assist people to undergo are not limited to those of individual actors' changes of state and their assumption of spiritual form. Rather, all of society may be expe- riencing radical transformation, and this dynamic process may be conceptualized, dramatized, and made more broadly accessible through the use of masks. As Cole has written, "Masquerades are probably Africa's most resilient art form, continually evolving to meet new needs" (1985:16). I would suggest that this is because the irony and the recognition of paradox in masking, "old tricks of the human race" that they are, are adaptive mechanisms of critical importance to coping with change. The use of masks for both personal and societal transformation will be illus- trated by this study of beaded masks of Tabwa and related peoples of south-cen- tral Africa. Tabwa masks appear to be few in number and have yet to be the direct subject of field study (see the cata- logue raisonne and entries of Roberts &amp; Maurer 1986). Tabwa living along the southwestern shores of Lake Tanganyika, among whom I conducted four years of predoctoral anthropological research in the 1970s, knew very little about masks and nothing about their current use by other Tabwa well to their own southwest.2 Still, with the archival and field data that are at hand, a plausible discussion of mask iconography and use can be presented, and the argument can be made that Tabwa masks are evolving in form and function as people seek to adapt to a changing political economy.3 When Evan Maurer and I conducted research in 1984 in preparation for our 1986 exhibition and catalogue, "The Rising of a New Moon: A Century of Tabwa Art," we found examples of three types of Tabwa mask. All were of wood. One type, known through only two examples, is a helmet form that depicts a human female (Fig. 3). Pierre Dartevelle was told when he collected one of these masks that it is the female counterpart to a "male" buffalo mask. Another type is an anthropomorphic face mask of indeterminate gender known through three examples, one of which is in the Stanley Collection at the University of Iowa (Fig. 4); another has been seen in the field (Fig. 5). Last is the buffalo mask (Fig. 8), of which we published a dozen examples in 1986. Yet a fourth type of Tabwa mask has come to our full atten- tion only in the last two years, but eight examples are already known. These are multicolored beaded facial masks. It is this last category that will be of primary interest here.4 In the spring of 1988, Mrs. Elizabeth Stanley offered a Tabwa beaded mask (Cover, Fig. 2) to the University of Iowa Museum of Art to commemorate the Fourth Stanley Conference on African Art.5 The mask was field-collected in the mid-1970s by Marc Felix in the area along the border between Zambia and Zaire, toward and perhaps slightly northeast of Lake Mweru. This is an area of intermingling for Tabwa, eastern Luba, eastern Lunda, Bemba, Shila, and 38</page><page sequence="4">several other ethnic groups that are closely related through history, lan- guage, culture, and the sharing of basic metaphors (Cunnison 1967; Werner 1971; Heusch 1982a). Felix was told only that the mask had been used in Mbudye society activities; we know nothing specifically about its manufacture or use. Still, we do know enough about the Mbudye society and about other Tabwa objects and contexts employing similar or related symbols that a tentative explanation of the beaded masks may be presented here. The face of the Stanley mask is com- posed of seven horizontal registers, ranging from the brow, where the bead- ing is surmounted by vertically standing jungle-fowl feathers and the pelt of a blue monkey, to the chin, where the beading tucks under to the throat, fol- lowing the contour of human physiog- nomy. Each of these registers is in turn composed of isosceles triangles. These triangles surround and define the eyes in the third register, the nose in the fourth and fifth, and the mouth between the fifth and sixth registers. Visually, the most dominant of the seven registers is the second one, extending across the forehead just above the bridge of the nose. Triangles of red and white stripes flank a white spiral at the center of the forehead. Yellow bead- ing around the spiral and yellow and white stripes between the triangles pro- vide a color contrast that seems to pro- ject the spiral and red triangles outward or inward.6 Alternation of red and white concentric stripes within the triangles enhances this effect. Isosceles triangles and spirals are common in Tabwa iconography, and allow one to situate this mask in a broader field of cosmo- logical representation. The decorative pattern of isosceles triangles, sometimes presented as hori- zontally divided rhombi, is called bal- amwezi in the Tabwa language, or "the rising of a new moon." This motif is so common in Tabwa art, both before colo- nial conquest and after it, that Evan Maurer and I chose it as the title for our 1986 exhibition.7 The balamwezi pattern was painted or incised as scarification on people's faces and bodies; plaited into coiffures; woven into mats, baskets, and hats; embroidered on barkcloth apparel; carved into wooden tool and weapon handles, drums, and musical instruments, ancestral or magical fig- ures, and many other wooden artifacts; and engraved into metal bracelets, hair- pins, and knife and axe blades (Weghsteen 1963; Roberts &amp; Maurer 1986; Van Geluwe 1986). More than any other representative device, balamwezi unifies Tabwa artistic expression. The rising of a new moon follows two or three moonless nights of utter darkness, when Tabwa feel that the forces of evil hold sway. The appearance of the new crescent and the possibility of perceiving and thus taking action against evil, then, are cause for celebra- tion. The contrast between darkness and light provides a ready metaphor for obscurity, ignorance, danger, and destruction versus perception, wisdom, safety, and hope. Yet the moon sub- sumes both terms in this opposition, and the resultant ambiguity helps peo- ple to understand and cope with the ultimate triumph of misfortune and death, despite their every attempt to live righteously. As Father Theuws has writ- ten with regard to related beliefs among neighboring Luba, "The moon is as ambiguous as life itself. ... To be and become, to live and to die are but two faces of the same reality" (1968:11).8 Wyatt MacGaffey recently suggested with regard to Kongo art that "meta- phorical elements [such as balamwezi tri- angles for Tabwa] earn their places in an assemblage on one or perhaps both of two principles, verbal and visual" (1988:192). The reason why an isosceles triangle should be chosen to represent the balamwezi concept is suggested in a number of narratives. For instance, refer- ence may be made to a male moon torn between his loyalties to his first wife, the Morning Star, or Venus rising in the east, and his second wife, the Evening Star, or Venus in the west. Such conjugal politics place the moon at an apex between the two cardinal directions (the basal points of the triangle) associated with begin- nings and birth (east) and endings and death (west). The vertical axis defined by the moon at this equidistanced apex falls directly upon ego, whoever she or he may be, as any individual strives to define and articulate his or her place in r .E both physical and social universes (Roberts 1980:103-13). MacGaffey's verbal principle is that of punning or rebus, "by which an ele- ment, by its name, is made to evoke a particular concept" (1988:192-93). The name balamzwezi is composed of an adverbial root bala-, from the verb mean- ing "to begin, to open, to appear, or to rise," and the noun mwezi, "moon." Kutentama is the verb used by Tabwa more frequently these days to refer to "the rising of a new moon" and related phenomena. Kutentama is the action of something rising and perching on top of something else, as the moon does as it ascends to the zenith. A noun derived from this same verb, for instance, refers to an epiphytic plant like an orchid or a fern that takes root high up in the branches of a tree. The same verb in both Tabwa and Luba languages is com- monly used to describe the event of spirit possession, when a spirit "mounts" to "take over" the head of a supplicant. It is this latter usage that is most pertinent to an understanding of the Stanley mask's iconography and probable use. My Tabwa informants living along the southwestern shores of Lake 7.

Those wearing such headdresses cover their faces with white chalk (mpemba), an act completing the mask-like transforma- tion. It is my hypothesis that Tabwa beaded masks serve the same purpose as, or one that is closely related to, that of nkaka headdresses of possession cult adepts. The beadwork of the nkaka head- dresses I have seen shows a great deal of variation. The configuration of an nkaka seen near Chief Zongwe's (Fig. 6), for instance, is strikingly similar to the sec- ond register of the Stanley mask: a spiral directly over the middle of the bearer's forehead is flanked by divided rhombi. A more complex headdress seen at Chief Mpala's (Fig. 7) has three registers of balamllvezi triangles, but the central motif looks something like a pinwheel rather than a tight spiral. Another nkaka from Mpala (Fig. 10) substitutes a house form for the central spiral. A third 1kaka from Mpala (Fig. 11) replaces the abstract cen- tral motif with what the owner explained was a human skull, which seems to have a long headdress. A bead- ed rooster stands to the left, facing the skull. A fourth headdress from Mpala, worn in Figure 12 by a Bulumbu medi- um, has five spirals across the forehead. Despite such differences, all these Bulumbu headdresses show a "con- strained diversity" or "semantic equivalence" (Layton 1981:28-29; cf. Roberts 1988a:72). That is, they are vari- ations on a basic theme or structure that follow some semantic or representation- al rules. Tabwa say that Bulumbu adepts can "read" and explain nkaka headdress- es. Use of the word "semantics" implies something else as well: "the study or sci- ence of meaning in language forms, par- ticularly with regard to its historical change" (Morris 1969:1177). The equiva- lence of the motifs found on nkaka head- dresses and, I would assert, on beaded masks, is a basic structure, a "visual vocabulary" (MacGaffey 1988), and a message that endures despite individual artistic interpretation, despite the need to convey particular messages in the beadwork of this or that individual's headdress or mask, and despite radical social change.9 The principal message of the head- dress lies in its central motif, which is most often in the form of a spiral framed, flanked, or set off by balamwezi triangles. Before explaining the particu- lar reference of this central motif on beaded headdresses and masks, I would like to present a more general discussion of the spiral as a "dominant symbol" (Turner 1970) for Tabwa. Precolonial Tabwa conceptualized time as a spiral, an idea they shared with other central Bantu peoples. MacGaffey suggests that nineteenth-cen- tury Kongo, for instance, conceived of the universe as having "a non-reversible time dimension and thus ... a spiral form" marked by "a sense of the dead as moving, by a series of transformation[s] in the after-life, through a hierarchy of increasingly remote but also more pow- erful and functionally less specific posi- tions in the other world" (1983:128-29). In a somewhat similar manner, Tabwa ori- gin myths tell of the first sentient beings emerging from a seemingly endless tun- nel in the earth, or from a deep pool of water. People moved outward from this point in concentric waves to populate the earth (Roberts 1980:35-68).10 The spiral temporal concept is given tangible form in Tabwa inheritance rit- ual when a close kinsperson is elected to "wear the belt" of a recently deceased loved one. The Tabwa word for "belt," kizinigo, is derived from a Bantu root meaning "circle" or "spiral" (Van Acker 1907:74, 94; Van Avermaet &amp; Mbuya 1954:828). These days the "belt" to be worn is usually the European-style clothing with which the dead person was identified. The succes- sor literally dons this clothing to assume the intimate details of the deceased's social being. The name of this event, however, remains as a reminder both of the earlier practice of wearing a loincloth on a belt (Roberts 1980:96-97), and of the underlying con- cept of the belt as encircling the waist at the navel, in turn the connection to one's mother and matrilineage. Furthermore, as a person "wears the belt" of a deceased kinsperson, she or he also "wears the belt" of those per- sons that the kinsperson succeeded. In this way, kinship can be thought of as a series of concentric circles or a spiral, leading from ego back through the gen- erations to earliest ancestors. Life is "eternal," then, in that the "belt" is always inherited, but periodic in that it has a beginning and end for any given individual (Roberts 1980:98). The conceptualization of spiraling kinship and time is recognized in sev- eral types of object and realized in sev- eral Tabwa art forms, including the beading of headdresses and masks. One such object is the disk cut from a cone shell (perhaps Conuis leopardus or Conus imperialis; see Safer &amp; Gill 1982:97-99). Tabwa and other central Bantu people call these shell disks mpande. Mpande were brought to Tabwa along the caravan routes from the east African coast. Only chiefs and their immediate kin possessed these disks, and they wore them on the belt, on the forehead, or on a thong around the neck (Jacques &amp; Storms 1886:26; Roberts 1986a:26). Mpande disks were rare and important "statement art" for Tabwa chiefs, representing in their spi- rals the succession of "belts" of the chiefs' lines of descent.1 The mpande disk, then, like a mandala, represents "a symbolic pantheon" (Eliade 1969:52) of past chiefs extending backward to an apical ancestor or ancestress.12 The mpande is also an image of time and space, as its spiral of "belts" traces the path backward through the generations to the first named humans who emerged from a hole in the earth or a deep pool of water, represented by the drilled center point of the shell. 8.

Analysis of a number of Tabwa myths permits one to place the mpande disk in a conceptual set or paradigm with other significant members. In the structure of one myth, an mpande shell and the moon are interchangeable (Roberts 1980:417-24). The moon itself is said to be "the eye of Kibawa" (Kalunga Mwela-Ubi, pers. com., 1986), the great chthonic spirit to be discussed shortly. In another myth, an mpande may be equated with a clan culture heroine's vagina and her "spi- ral" of descendance (Roberts 1980:377- 79).13 In still another, death originates at the center of a spiral-shaped build- ing. Such a building is analogous to both an mpande shell and to the cavern of Kibawa, the great chthonic spirit that is the keeper of Tabwa dead (1980:353-82). In this latter regard, Aylward Shorter has discussed the symbolism of cone shell disks among the Kimbu of central Tanzania, sug- gesting that "concentric circles and other circular designs signify the pene- tration of a labyrinth to its center" (1972:104). Reference to Kibawa's cav- ern brings us back to the particular use of spiral motifs in the beading of Tabwa headdresses and masks. Kibawa is an especially important ngulu, or earth spirit.14 Earth spirits, especially during precolonial times, were the focus of territorial or ecologi- cal cults organized to provide rationale and structure for the corporate exploita- tion of local natural resources (Binsbergen 1981:97; Roberts 1984). Tabwa living along Lake Tanganyika say that they first recognized Kibawa in the mid-1890s, through prophesy. This was a period of extreme duress, when politico-economic turmoil caused by slave-raiding and colonial conquest was exacerbated by natural disasters such as famine, flooding, epidemics, and plagues of locusts. Kibawa announced his desire to help Tabwa through an epi- zootic of rinderpest: the scores of dead animals that Tabwa found on the high moorlands of the Marungu Massif allowed them to survive the famine. Kibawa informed Tabwa through a prophet (kasesema) that he would con- tinue to assist them on condition that they desist from speaking Swahili, the newly introduced language of intrusive slavers, missionaries, and colonial offi- cials. Reverence paid to Kibawa, then, constituted nativistic resistance to change. The advent of Kibawa was more than just the discovery of another earth spirit. It marked an important ontologi- cal shift for the Tabwa, from a precolo- nial community focus for religious and politico-economic activities to a new individualistic strategy for coping with social change. With the introduction of colonial capitalism, the focus of Tabwa religion shifted from the community to individual initiative, reward, power, and success. As an invention of distressed and concerned Tabwa actors, Kibawa's role was to facilitate adaptation to the rigors of a new social universe by intro- ducing the highly personal, cathartic tri- umph of spirit possession. Here, as in other domains of capitalist social life, the individual, "irrespective of kinship and local background, . .. can gain ... a reputation as a medium far away from his home" (Binsbergen 1981:97-98). The spirit medium would become responsi- ble for his or her own salvation to an extent that would have been unthink- able in precolonial times. At the same time, as a medium, the possessed person would communicate about and com- ment upon society itself (Firth 1969:xi). At first, Kibawa was an oracle. People from far and wide, including Tabwa, eastern Luba, Zela, and many others, visited Kibawa's cavern hidden deep in a bamboo thicket in Chief Penge's lands, near the eastern bank of the Luvua River. A kitobo, or guide, would lead them through the tangle of bamboo to the cavern in a process that made metaphoric allusion to the suppli- cants' desire to solve perplexing prob- lems of their own (Roberts 1988c). Once at the mouth of the cavern, the kitobo would lead the supplicants deep into the dark recesses, where the gurgling of Kibawa's huge water pipe, the voices of recently departed kin, and other domes- tic sounds could be heard. The suppli- cants would be so comforted by these sounds, and especially by the proximity 41</page><page sequence="7">TOP. 10 TABWA BEADED HEADDRESS OF BULUMBU DIVINER SEEN IN 1975 AT MPALA, SOUTHEASTERN ZAIRE.

The kitobo would present the supplicant's problem to Kibawa, and advice or judgment would be rendered.15 Authors addressing the history of religious change among central African peoples have noted that "in times of stress when secular authority was being undermined, or when chiefdoms could not stand alone against invaders, then links within and between the spirit- realms were activated to provide a framework for political and, sometimes, military activity on a wide scale" (Garbett 1969:113; cf. Oger 1972:1). The best-studied and most celebrated case of this is the role assumed by Shona spirit mediums in the guerrilla movement of preindependence Zimbabwe (Lan 1985). For Tabwa, the 1930s were marked by intense social stress caused by the col- lapse of the colonial economy in the Great Depression and the politico-eco- nomic upheaval resulting from the introduction of a Belgian version of Indirect Rule.16 Tabwa shifted their reli- gious forms to accommodate such change by adopting a form of the Bulumbu possession cult from neigh- boring eastern Luba (cf. Werner 1971:21). In particular, Kibawa's cavern began to be seen as the source from which possessing spirits might emanate. These are ngulu earth spirits sent forth by recently deceased kin to afflict and so gain the attention of those surviving them, as indicated through divination. Adepts of the Bulumbu cult then assist supplicants to become possessed, so that the spirits may "rise up" and "take" the person to announce their identity and desires. Like "the rising of a new moon," this "enlightenment" (and Tabwa use the word metaphorically in the same way we do in English) allows supplicants to see things anew, and so to construct a happier future. Once recog- nition and reverence are offered to the spirit, it will continue to offer critical assistance to the person. Bulumbu adepts wear nkaka beaded headdresses during their performances (Fig. 12). The central beaded spiral is "the eye of Kibawa," and so represents the entire paradigm of the moon, contact with the ancestors, and fertility. The placement of this third "eye" over the center of the adept's forehead is signifi- cant. Tabwa practitioners of divination and magic are said to have "eyes," and whenever someone states this, she or he 4 e. _ v invariably taps the center of the fore- head with an index finger. "The face of the cross," a common scarification pat- tern of Tabwa in precolonial as well as present times, emphasizes this same central point with a vertical line of keloids or tattooing following the body midline intersected by a horizontal line across the forehead (or, sometimes, as on the Tabwa face mask in Fig. 4, from the temples across the eyes to meet at the bridge of the nose; see Roberts 1988b:46- 47). The "eye" at this central point allows the practitioner to "see" beyond that which can be known to ordinary people. The center of the forehead is deemed the seat of wisdom, prophesy, and dreams. The metaphors of the central spiral of beads on the nkaka are made instrumen- tal by sewing a magic bundle into the headdress, behind the spiral. The vizim- ba activating agents of such a bundle include tiny fragments of the following: nzima, the melanistic serval cat (Felis ser- val) that is "cool" and dark and renders the adept "invisible" to evil sorcerers; radii, or a piece of wood from a tree struck by lightning, which lends the power of lightning itself to the practi- tioner seeking to solve problems with- out evil interference; the head or brain of a domestic jungle fowl cock and of a kasebu, or honey guide bird (probably Indicator indicator), to lend the capacity to see what ordinary people cannot; the brain of a spotted hyena and a wild dog (Crocutta crocutta and Lycaon pictus), members of a small set of animals felt to have malosi, or an extraordinary vision allowing them to "see" and seek out prey or carrion at a great distance; mazombwe, the giant walking stick (Palophus leopoldii), to make the adept tremble and quake like this insect, as a sign of impending possession; and kichi- mankunka, a kind of woody fungus, which because of its pure white interior 42</page><page sequence="8">is considered an auspicious sign when it pops up out of the earth and is discov- ered while farming. These magical elements do two things: they protect the Bulumbu adept so that she or he can resolve a suppli- cant's misfortune without interference from the very sorcerers or other evil agents who may be the source of the problem; and they project the adept's vision beyond that of an ordinary mor- tal, enabling perception of a solution to an obscure and troubling difficulty and to provide a plan of action for resolu- tion. The third eye of the Bulumbu adept provides an ambivalent yet arrest- ing vision: it is both inwardly protective and outwardly aggressive (see Napier 1986 for a discussion of similar symbol- ism elsewhere in the world). As such, it is a dramatic reflection of the paradox of social life as recognized by Tabwa and their Luba neighbors. The "two faces" of their social reality, represented by the natural symbol of the moon, are a recog- nition that good and evil exist in the same persons and circumstances, as sit- uationally interpreted by the different parties in local-level politics. A final activating agent that some Bulumbu adepts place in their head- dresses is a scale of a pangolin (either the Cape, Manis temminicki, or the tree, M. tricuspis). Pangolin scales are burned by Tabwa and other people in central Africa to cause lions and other dangerous animals to flee. Tabwa say that "the king of beasts is not the lion" but the pangolin. Use of the pangolin as an activating agent for the magical bundle of a diviner's headdress keeps sorcerers at bay during a seance. There is more to the pangolin metaphor than this, however. The Tabwa word for "pangolin" is nkaka, the very name of the possession-cult adept's headdress.17 At a superficial level, this is probably due to the visual analogy between the balamwezi triangles of the headdress and a pangolin's roughly triangular, trilobed scales (G. Nagant, pers. com., 1977). Other associations are possible, drawing upon the taxonomic prepos- terousness of the pangolin, a generic equivalence between the scales of a pangolin and the shell of a tortoise, and other factors too complex to pre- sent here in detail (see Roberts 1980). What is clear is that when Tabwa call a beaded headdress "pangolin," they propose a rebus ("a riddle ... depicted by symbols or pictures that suggest ... the words or syllables they represent" [Morris 1969:1087]) or intellectual game of the sort from which Tabwa, like the Kongo people MacGaffey describes (1988:202), "derive pleasure and satisfaction." On many nkaka headdresses, two spi- rals, isosceles triangles, or other figures on either side of the central motif repre- sent the winds (pepo) from the cardinal directions. The word pepo refers both to "wind" and to "possessing spirits," which, "like the wind, [are] invisible, mysterious, [and] free to move from place to place." Reference is also made to "the suddenness of the happening" of possession; "'it is coming like the wind,' unseen, from nowhere, [like] a sudden gust 'creeping into a human being' ... like the wind penetrating a house" (Oger 1972:2). The four motifs are the eyes or doors of the most important spirits, the wives of Kibawa (Roberts 1980:366). The "pinwheel" within the central motif of the nkaka in Figure 7 was explained by a Tabwa informant to be the four triangular doors of these same spirits from which they emerge to pos- sess people. Two spirals appear on either side of Kibawa's spiral in the headdress seen in Figure 12. One on the left is said to rep- resent Katambalele, the spirit that opens a path through the bamboo thicket sur- rounding Kibawa's cavern so that a sup- plicant can find spiritual aid. The other is Mulenga, the spirit guide within Kibawa's cavern and a figure that is Kibawa's structural equivalent for southern Tabwa and Bemba. On the right are Kaliba, the spirit that possesses the particular adept wearing this head- dress, and Kisimba, a spirit associated with the legitimacy of certain Tabwa chiefs. Each of these four spirits has three more associated with it, making a total of thirteen major spirits when Kibawa himself is included. Thirteen is the number of lunar months in a year as well as the number of scutes, or large scales, on a tortoise's carapace. These associations are important to the discus- sion of beaded masks that may be used in Mbudye society performances. The Mbudye society exists among Luba, Luba-related, and Luba-influ- enced peoples. Mbudye has among its principal purposes the recounting of the mythical charter for sacred kingship and the glorification of the political status quo (Reefe 1981).18 While some say that Mbidi Kiluwe, the culture hero who established sacred royalty among the Luba (Heusch 1982a), also introduced the Mbudye society, others assert that it was "a certain Ngoi ya Nkongolo" (Ferber 1932). The same man, according to the Luba informants of W. F. P. Burton, originated the Butwa society found among Tabwa and other groups east and southeast of the Luba (Burton 1961:157).19 From a structuralist perspec- tive, this indicates that the two societies share basic metaphors. It appears, how- ever, that Mbudye and Butwa were "in competition" (Ferber 1934a) and did not exist in the same territories: Mbudye served and continues to serve the needs of people with a centralized, state politi- cal economy (or at least its remnants), while Butwa flourished among decen- tralized, stateless peoples like most Tabwa, but has been defunct since early this century because of the imposition of colonial capitalism (see Roberts 1980). Many Tabwa ancestral figures bear the V-shaped scarification emblem of Butwa initiation (Roberts 1988b), indicating the society's importance as a source of "help in sickness and need, with the prospects of a respectable funeral and worship after death" (Ferber 1934b:62-63), for precolonial people engaged in a com- munity-oriented political economy. That some northern and southwestern Tabwa have adopted the Mbudye society indi- cates their borrowing from a Luba idiom 12.

According to W.F.P. Burton, at least for turn-of-the-century Luba, the "pre- siding spirit" of Mbudye was Lolo Inang'ombe, who oversaw initiation into the society and punished any who might subvert its principles. "For the practical purposes of the society," Lolo Inang'ombe was represented as a land tortoise.20 Mbudye members were said to "show an extreme respect for" the tortoise, and "to know whether a person is well inclined to the 'Bumbudye,' a tor- toise is put into his hut." How the per- son reacted to the animal was taken as a sign of willingness and suitability for Mbudye membership (Burton 1961:159- 60, 164). The form of a tortoise was given to the lukasa mnemonic device recording the charter for Luba royalty and other lore. The back of the lukasa "bears a stylized tortoise shell design" of "striated triangles or squares," each of which "symbolizes an esoteric piece of information" (Reefe 1977:49). The lukasa, then, was "the Bible of the Bambudye, the dictionary of signs" that could be "read" by Mbudye members (Henroteaux 1945:104). Lolo Inang'ombe herself is said to have been the offspring of a woman and a buffalo, a woman married to a buffalo, or, as in an Mbudye wall painting Burton once saw, a dichotomous being that had the body of an animal (a buffa- lo?) and the torso and head of a woman (Burton 1961:159-60). Tabwa masks may portray this couple or at least refer to the same play of metaphors, for the wooden helmet mask field collected by Pierre Dartevelle (Fig. 3) was said to be female and paired with the male buffalo mask in the Stanley Collection (Fig. 8), which he also collected. The inset cowry-shell eyes that Tabwa anthropo- morphic masks possess or reflect in their carving are like those of Tabwa buffalo masks (Roberts &amp; Maurer 1986:252-53). The figure represented is said to be a clan ancestress named Musangwe (Dartevelle, pers. com., 1984). The root of this name is the verb kusangwa, "to be found, to desire," with a nuance of sex- ual promiscuity.21 Perhaps the mask was danced to dramatize the bestial excess of the earliest humans, who, like Lolo Inang'ombe, coupled with buf- faloes. As Burton suggested, "within the sect [of Mbudye] promiscuity is practiced" and there are "sensual dis- plays of dancing, where every sexual action and gesture is exploited to the full" (1961:163, 167), probably for the same symbolic purposes. Buffaloes (Syncerus caffer) are still found in Tabwa lands, although they are far less common than they were prior to the introduction of gun-hunting (IAAPB 1892:11). The strength and violent nature of the buffalo are played upon in Tabwa metaphor, ritual, and magic. Magical whisks made from buffalo tails are used to keep at bay smallpox, lion-men (visanguka), sorcerers, or other agents of destruction. The name of such a whisk, mpunga, derives from a verb meaning "to stay awake and vigilant all night" (Roberts &amp; Maurer 1986:176-77). These whisks are often made with sculpted 13.

HE WEARS A LARGE BEADED HEADDRESS ON HIS FOREHEAD AND A BLUE MONKEY PELT DOWN HIS BACK. wooden handles, some of which are inset with copper wire filigree; they are still used as signs of political status, as they were by earlier Tabwa chiefs (Giraud 1890:522). Eastern Luba found the same metaphors apposite. A boy leaving the initiation camp was greeted with the cry, "Here is the buffalo, here is the buf- falo!" (Colle 1913:275), while Mbidi Kiluwe, the Luba culture hero, was praised as being "shiningly black like the buffalo" (Womersley 1984:7). Dartevelle was told that a name for a Tabwa buffalo mask is Kiyunde; although the etymology of this term remains obscure, it may derive from a root that means "to heal" or that is asso- ciated with the smelting of iron,22 activi- ties associated with Mbidi Kiluwe and other culture heroes. It is quite possible, then, that buffalo masks used by Tabwa living close to and among eastern Luba were either associated with Mbudye practices glorifying Mbidi Kiluwe or were made to celebrate the same idiom that Mbidi personifies for Luba. This brings us back to beaded masks like that in the Stanley Collection, said to be associated with Mbudye. In the past, Mbudye spirit mediums and those known as Bulumbu were said to be one and the same. Mbudye members in the higher orders of their society were possessed by spirits and "allowed to wear the 'nkaka' or diamond-decorat- ed bead crown" (Burton 1961:50-52, 55, 154-67) (Fig. 9).23 These possessing spir- its are associated with Luba heroes whose "spirits are believed to have taken up their abode in springs, foun- tains, waterfalls, and damp caves, where the water oozes from the roof." Among the most important possessing spirits for Luba (like Tabwa) is Kibawa, and the person so possessed "may scratch wildly at the ground with his finger- and toe-nails" to dig a "cave" like Kibawa's (Burton 1961:50-52, 55, 154-67).24 A praise name for Mbidi Kiluwe is "Chief of Kibawa" (Colle 1913:357; Verhulpen 1936:95), and the "fetish" or magical investiture bundle as well as the principal mukishi (wood- en figure) of the Luba "king of the sacred blood (mulopwe)" was called "Kibawa" (Verbeke 1937:55-58). Mbudye and Bulumbu adepts among Luba show "reverence for the new moon" (Verbeke 1937:167) and in other ways share the basic metaphors made manifest in Tabwa beaded headdresses and the possession cult seances in which they are used. The beaded headresses of Luba and Tabwa possession cult medi- ums are often strikingly similar (Figs. 9,12), and are called nkaka in both lan- guages, a word they both use to refer to the pangolin as well (Burton 1961:166; Van Avermaet &amp; Mbuya 1954:216). It is likely that a conceptual association 44</page><page sequence="10">14. TABWA BEADED MASK, UNKNOWN PROVENANCE. GLASS BEADS, FEATHERS, LEATHER, COTTON THREAD. 30cm. PRIVATE COLLECTION, CALIFORNIA. exists among a pangolin's scales, a tor- toise's scutes (the emblem of Lolo Inang'ombe, "presiding spirit" of Mbudye), the triangular tortoise shell motif found on the back of lukasa mnemonic devices of Mbudye members, and the triangular beading of both Luba and Tabwa headdresses and masks. The signs of Mbudye initiation, painted on the walls of the society lodge and sculpted or represented as clusters of beads tacked to the top surface of the lukasa device, were "so rigorously exact throughout the whole of Lubaland [that they] were originally intended to per- petuate some symbolic teaching, or his- tory" (Burton 1961:163; cf. Reefe 1977). The messages encoded in the motifs of a spirit medium's headdress or mask can be read in a similar manner. Tabwa beaded masks show "con- strained diversity" of the same sort as do nkaka headdresses. All masks and most nkaka seen to date are surmounted by feathers, usually of domestic jungle fowl whose spectacular plumage makes the usual gloss, "chicken," seem wholly inadequate (cf. Davis-Roberts 1980:5). The metaphorical reference is the uncanny ability of the jungle fowl cock to discern and crow at dawn, even before people are aware that daybreak has come; occasionally the feathers of other birds or the stiff mane of a goat are used in a similar fashion, to make different but complementary metaphor- ical references. The Stanley mask has the pelt of a blue monkey attached in such a way that it hangs down over the back of the head and shoulders. Nkaka headdresses often have blue monkey pelts attached to them in this same manner (Figs. 10, 12; see also Roberts 1988c:fig. 6), and other beaded masks now in museum and private collections may have had such pelts removed. The blue monkey (Circopithecus mitis) is arboreal and rarely touches the ground. Tabwa see the animal's high acrobatics as analo- gous to the way that a possessing spirit will "perch upon" and "take over" a person's head and very being, as expressed in the verb for "to become possessed," kutentama, explained above. As shown in Figure 13, agile dancers can make the monkey pelt seem to leap onto or about the head, in imitation of the animal. The nkaka headdress in Figure 6 has the spotted pelt of a serval attached to it, whereas a beaded face mask in a field photograph by Marc Felix (Fig. 15) has the spotted skin of a genet (Genetta genetta). Spotted skins are (or were) worn in this way by certain high-rank- ing Mbudye members to "represent the heavens: the black spots stand for the stars" (Ferber 1932:17); or it may be that the "mottled coat (light and dark) readi- ly connotes the alternation of day and night" as subsumed in the powers and being of chiefs (Heusch 1982a:139-41). These same spotted skins are associated with chiefship by peoples throughout central Africa, and usually it is the pre- rogative of chiefs to own or wear them. The association here, especially for Luba, is between possessing spirits and the culture heroes who established sacred chiefship. The Stanley beaded mask has a spiral at the center of the forehead, just as most nkaka headdresses do. Other masks such as those in Figures 1 and 14 do not have this motif, but do have a similar register of isosceles triangles across the brow. On still others (Figs. 16,17) that are flat panels rather than contoured surfaces that fit the curves of the face, this register of triangles is missing and the spiral is placed over the mouth. Unfortunately, nothing whatsoever is known of these masks' provenance, other than that they are said and appear to be "Tabwa." Still, several reasons for placing a spiral motif over the mouth come to mind, based on Tabwa ethnog- 45</page><page sequence="11">raphy. An mpande disk was placed over the mouth of a precolonial Tabwa chief during funeral and succession proceed- ings. The death of a chief was hidden from ordinary people through a charade orchestrated by his grandchildren. A granddaughter would seclude herself with the moribund chief and, after he had died, cradle his cadaver, moaning as though she were the chief still alive and suffering. After four days, the corpse was placed in a great jar or bark recepta- cle, its knees tucked to its chest. It would be dressed in a "feathered head- dress" and an mpande disk would be placed over the mouth "to prevent rapid putrefaction." Decomposition was allowed to continue until the skull fell from the spine. Then the skull would be kept as a revered relic, while the skull of the preceding chief that had been kept in the same way would be placed in a deep pool of water or beneath a streambed with the body of the chief just deceased (Roberts 1980:494-98). Some time thereafter, the grandchil- dren would choose a successor from among the chief's sisters' sons. The suc- cessor was closed up in a house while the grandchildren circled it in dance. The new chief was then released from the house, given regalia, and an mpande disk was bound over his mouth. With the spiral disk sealing his lips, the chief was instructed to no longer commit "foolish acts," often a reference to adul- tery, but sometimes to other disruptive behavior as well (Roberts 1980:499-500). In both of these cases, the mpande disk sealed the mouth. The spiraled shell disk is of a cognitive set with the moon, the cavern of Kibawa, fertility, and the chief's genealogy. At death, a person's words and wisdom are said to go to the east, to appear as light; again the metaphor of "enlightenment" is the same as we would have it in English. Jungle fowl first perceive this light, and crow. Possessing spirits may emerge from Kibawa's cavern to the west of where most Tabwa live, but, somewhat paradoxically, they are said to come from the "place of beginnings" in the east when they possess people. In this they are like the new moon that is first noticed in the west but subsequently is seen to rise in the east. The enlighten- ment these spirits bring their suppli- cants is informed by the wisdom of chiefs, the "fathers of their people" who are of an idiom with Mbidi Kiluwe, the Luba hero and "Chief of Kibawa" who "came from the east" to conquer what would become the Luba heartland (Roberts, forthcoming A). The spiral of beads over the mouths of some masks is a reference to this richly complex cultur- al field: speech is to be controlled, care- fully uttered, and consistent with the teachings of the ancestors kept by Kibawa.25 A final use of beaded headdresses may be mentioned as an indication of how vitally important their messages and structure are, even in the context of the most stressful sorts of social change in contemporary central Africa. Mrs. Margret Carey, a guest curator at the Museum of Mankind in London, has been kind enough to send me pho- tographs she recently took at the Moto Moto Museum in northeastern Zambia of objects seized in the early 1960s from one or more followers of Alice Lenshina's nativistic Lumpa Church. These include beaded headdresses that are strikingly similar to the nkaka of Tabwa and Luba possession cult adepts: one has five tight spirals to be worn across the forehead; another, four spirals and a diamond of dizzying color combi- nations; and a third consists of triangles around a large central spiral (Fig. 18).26 In 1953, Alice Lenshina became very ill and "died" four times, but was called back to life each time by Jesus, who taught her instructive songs and gave her a book "in a strange language that only she could read" (Oger 1962:129).27 She began teaching these songs and writings and exhorting people to give up the sorcery that seemed to be con- doned by the colonial government, since the administration had condemned use of the poison oracle to identify and elim- inate evildoers. Lenshina baptized peo- ple and became alienated from local missionaries for doing so. She founded her own church, which by the late 1950s had a following of well over 100,000 among Bemba and Bemba-speaking people, including many southern Tabwa. Lenshina was thought to be pos- sessed by an ngulu earth spirit and "had her analogues among those to whom spirits revealed themselves through dreams and possession" (A.D. Roberts 1970:527).28 Father Louis Oger states that Lenshina was "'possessed' by the spirit of Christ" in a manner similar to, and explained using the vocabulary of, ngulu spirit possession (1962:132; 16.

BEADED HEADDRESS OF FOLLOWERS OF ALICE LENSHINA. GLASS BEADS, FEATHERS. LEATHER, COTTON CLOTH AND THREAD.18 x 18cm. MOTO MOTO MUSEUM, MBALA. NORTHEASTERN ZAMBIA. 1972:6). While "there does not seem to have been any ecstatic behavior or symptoms of spirit possession" during her church services (A.D. Roberts 1970:537), "Lenshina did nothing to dis- pel reports" of her connection with the ngulu spirit system (Werner 1971:23). Indeed, converts to the Lumpa Church said they were inspired to join through dreams and prophesy, during a time when ngulu spirit possession was dra- matically on the rise among people in northeastern Zambia (Oger 1972:1). Through the ngulu idiom, Lenshina offered redemption to sorcerers and pro- vided her own magical charms to pro- tect church members and assure them of successful harvests (A.D. Roberts 1970:531, 542). It is probable that the beaded headdresses seized by the colo- nial government and now in the Moto Moto Museum were used by Lenshina's converts, perhaps outside of her direct supervision but within the idiom of spirit possession that was her implicit vehicle. Lenshina made promises of the Millennium, saying Jesus would visit her followers when the Lumpa cathe- dral was completed. She herself "claimed to provide an answer to the troubles, not just of individuals, but of society at large" (A.D.Roberts 1970:543). "Lumpa," the name of her church, is derived from a Bemba verb meaning "to be the most important," this in reference to missionary churches in the same part of Zambia that Lenshina felt were led by "her enemies" (Oger 1962:133). The Lumpa church attracted many who were hostile to the colonial government (including the brother and mother of soon-to-be-president Kenneth Kaunda), and became a locus of nationalism dur- ing the tense years of the late 1950s and early 1960s, prior to Zambian indepen- dence. Lumpa became "more and more specifically a peasant movement," how- ever, which soon proved "quite incom- patible with the nationalist emphasis on wider incorporation and on the state" (Binsbergen 1981:290-91). Shortly before and for some time after Independence, a violent split between conservative, nativistic church members and many nationalists resulted in the deaths of as many as 1,500 Lenshina followers, as President Kaunda banned the move- ment and arrested Lenshina (Binsbergen 1981:266; A.D. Roberts 1970:553-62). Still, the symbols of Lenshina's move- ment, including reference to the ngulu earth-spirit idiom and use of beaded headbands such as those now in the Moto Moto Museum, served a critical function in allowing people to redefine their social outlook as dissatisfaction with colonial living conditions rose. For the last fifty or more years, beaded headdresses and masks have been used by possession cult adepts among Tabwa, eastern Luba, Bemba, and other closely related peoples of southeastern Zaire and northeastern Zambia. While the contexts for such use have varied, cer- tain key metaphors remain vitally appo- site across time and ethnic difference. The two most significant of these are prominently represented in the beading: balamwezi triangles, a motif called "the rising of a new moon," refer to enlight- enment, courage, and hope through spirit possession; and spirals of beading or cone-shell disks refer to the paradoxi- cal nature of time and the advance of human generations, fertility, promise, and contact with divinity. These and other motifs make beaded headdresses and masks "agents of ideol- ogy" for both performers and their audi- ences, as they reflect, make accessible, and inculcate values, social needs, and aspirations. Importantly though, while donning these masks "causes" the bear- er to become a spirit or to assume an otherwise ineffable state, such transfor- mation allows an audience to contem- plate change of other sorts. As Raymond Firth has written: "In many societies spirit possession and spirit medium cults offer a field for some degree of individual self-expression, maybe of a fantasy order, going well beyond the conventions of tradition. Spirit medi- umship may thus allow of flexibility in the conceptualization of the spirit uni- verse, and presumably thereby offer some possibilities of change in belief" (1969:xi-xii). As is evident in the case of beaded headdress use by Alice Lenshina's followers, coping with and taking full advantage of turbulent, even revolutionary, social conditions can be facilitated by use of masks. Yet there is irony and paradox in the wearing of a mask, for one is deliberate- ly contrasting apparent with intended meaning, what empirically is with what might be. That is, the masker and the audience know that this is only a perfor- mance, but they willingly suspend their disbelief in order to participate in the intended drama. They want to witness, think about, and participate in transfor- mation. They want to consider alterna- tives. They want to engage in "what-if" hypothesis. While this may sometimes be an entertaining process, maskers' impersonation of spirits, allowing the ineffable to become more accessible, can be a deadly serious business. Bulumbu and Mbudye adepts are possessed by spirits in a catharsis that brings insight, perception, and solutions to nagging dilemmas, sudden crises, and life-threat- ening circumstances. Lenshina's follow- ers used headdresses similar to those of possession cult adepts as a means of political empowerment, when they reacted to colonial oppression through references to the vitality of indigenous culture and its potential for adaptation and transformation. The ambiguities and paradoxes of wearing masks, then, continue to be "useful, if old, 'tricks of the human race.' " Notes, page 101 47 J:-</page><page sequence="13">Hoskins), Timor (David Hicks), and Tanim- bar (Susan McKinnon). A collection of this sort should have a coherence other than that provided by geog- raphy. Certain themes recur and are devel- oped, more or less successfully, in the articles. Artistic form, as represented here, is consis- tently related to cosmic order and to a com- plementary balance and harmony. In several traditions this has produced the image of a mythical being that supports this harmony and guards the community's well-being and fertility. This being appears as a serpent-like dragon on Nias, among the Batak, and on Borneo. Among the Toraja, the protective image, described in careful detail by Nooy- Palm, takes the form of the buffalo, the most important sacrificial animal. All these soci- eties also concentrate on the representation of ancestors, either in personal images (as among the Toraja), in a house dedicated to the founder of a lineage (on Nias), or in ritual buildings, as described by Erb for Flores. This link to the past is seen as essential to future well-being: it may also be expressed in an image that encompasses the entire communi- ty, as is the case with Tanimbar stone boats. By contrast, an artistic representation of social conflict is apparently not present in Tanimbar, although it may be enacted in the society in other forms, even those related to the stone boats. In her discussion of carved Tanimbar prows, McKinnon describes the hostile confrontation that is part of a confir- mation of interisland alliances. Several of the contributions emphasize social stratification. This subject is especially relevant to the discussions of Nias, Sumba, the Batak, and the Toraja. Nobility implies merit. It may be inherited, as in East Sumba or Nias. It may in addition need to be rein- forced by acquired status, through headhunt- ing and ceremonial feasting. Feldman and Barbier both concentrate on the theme of community leaders as mediators between the village and divinity, a role that is emphasized by their close iconographic link to a cosmic image. Hoskins interprets the presence of spiritual power in certain objects that com- bine female and male images: surprisingly, she is the only contributor to discuss the issue of gender in any detail. Although some individual articles are dis- appointing, the volume as a whole provides new information and interpretations. However, one point of criticism has to be raised. Although "Indigenous Styles of Southeast Asia" is the book's subtitle, there is virtually no stylistic definition or analysis in the papers contributed. The exceptions are Newton's introduction and McKinnon's per- ceptive and concise discussion of Tanimbar boat carvings. The social context of artistic production is, of course, essential, and all of the contributions try to tackle that issue. But in addition art is made by individuals in a specific way that is determined by their tradi- tion and by their personal creativity. Neither the question of the particularity of style nor that of individual creativity is addressed here. These issues are central to the subject of ethnographic art history. U notes ROBERTS: Notes, fron? page 47 1. Wissler's original article on masks was published in Natural History (128:28 [4], 339-52) as "The Lore of the Demon Mask. How Savages and Barbarians Make Use of False Faces in Their Weird Religious Ceremonies. Ancient and Modern Uses of These Strange Masks Among the Natives of America and Other Parts of the World." The title was changed (and happily so!) to "Masks," more pho- tographs were added, and the article was then published in the museum's Science Guide series (no. 96). This Guide was in its third (and apparently final) printing in 1950, when the issue I found in a Chicago used book store was published. The series is no longer published, although photocopies may be obtained from the American Museum of Natural History. My copy is signed by George Mills, whose own work in the 1950s on Navaho art and "qualitative anthropology" is still well known. It would be instructive to know how many peo- ple's enduring interest in masks and ethnographic arts was first piqued by the sort of museum publication that Wissler produced. 2. Four years of predoctoral anthropology fieldwork based at Mpala, Zaire (late 1973 to late 1977), were financed by the U.S. National Institute for Mental Health (grant in aid #I-FOI- MH-55251-01-CUAN); the Committee on African Studies and the Edson-Keith Fund of the University of Chicago; and Sigma Xi, the Scientific Research Society. During my years in Zaire, I was a research associate at the Center for Central African Political Studies (CEPAC) at the National University of Zaire, Lubumbashi. Sincere thanks are extended to Mrs. Elizabeth Stanley for her continued support of African art research at the University of Iowa, and for her generous donations in 1988 and 1989 of a Tabwa beaded mask and a Tabwa buffalo mask to the University of Iowa Museum of Art; to Mumba Marselina and other Tabwa friends who taught me about Bulumbu; to Margret Carey, Marc Felix, Jacques Hautelet, and William Dewey for sharing pho- tographs and information about beaded masks and head- dresses; to Robert Cancel, Kalunga Mwela-Ubi, Genevieve Nagant, and Louis Oger for sharing difficult-to-find but invaluable literature on Tabwa and Bemba; and to Jan Vansina, Mary Kujawski, and Christopher Roy for editorial and intellectual guidance. Despite the generosity of these agencies and colleagues, all responsibility for the present paper remains my own. For Seth, Avery, and Mame. 3. The following comments, then, may be considered specula- tive. This last word is often mistakenly lent a sense of that which is spurious, specious, or haphazard. In correct usage it refers to "contemplation of a profound nature" and "implies an orderly process of reasoning based upon inconclusive evi- dence" (Morris 1969:1241; see usage note pp. 281-82). It is hoped that field research can be undertaken in the next sev- eral years, to study Tabwa masks and related objects and practices in situ. 4. Marc Felix (1989:204-7, 218-19) has recently exhibited and published photographs of three more wooden masks from northern Tabwa (whom he calls "Holoholo" and "Tumbwe"; see Roberts 1986a for a discussion of these ethnic labels), one of which is of a different sort from others known to date. Felix and his agents appear to have field collected all three masks. One was used by "roving musicians and dancers at the funeral of a HOLOHOLO elder," another was "in a Bambudye-type ceremony along with beaded diadems worn by other dancers," and the third was "the property of an ini- tiatic male society." While this sketchy information allows few conclusions to be drawn, use of the first (Felix's fig. 52) and more certainly the second mask (fig. 53, pp. 204-7), which is decorated with isosceles triangles incised across the brow, the middle of the face, and the chin, seems consistent with the following discussion of beaded masks. The third mask, portraying a zoomorphic being with horns, has no other Tabwa counterpart; one is led to wonder if it was made by Lega or related people north of the Tabwa and used like the stylistically related Lega kaynamba mask Felix illustrates (pp. 90-91). 5. The theme of the Fourth Stanley Conference on African Art, held April 22-23, 1988, at the University of Iowa, was "Art and Initiation in Zaire." Conference papers will be pub- lished in lotwa Studies il African Art (forthcoming 1990). 6. European glass beads have long been available to people in southeastern Zaire in many colors besides the primary white/red/black triad of central symbolic significance to Tabwa and other Bantu peoples. When I asked why such sec- ondary colors as green, yellow, or blue were used in making the nkaka headdresses to be presented in this article, I was offered a pragmatic response: either beads of these colors were available and so were used, or they were felt to make the object more pleasing ("kwta miiapedezo til"). While color contrasts are used to achieve visual effects, the identity of particular colors seems insignificant, then, although this is usually not true when white, red, or black is used in other contexts. 7. Weghsteen (1963) identifies the pattern as "the rising of a new moon" and provides line drawings of many examples of its use. My informants at Chief Mpala's confirmed the name of this motif. It is curious, then, that Bemba living just to the south of the Tabwa and to whom Tabwa are so closely related linguistically, culturally, and historically should con- sider a similar zigzag motif as solar rather than lunar (Maxwell 1983:53). Indeed, their name for the motif, liyongolo (Richards 1956), refers to a serpent and is a cognate of the name of the Luba solar hero and "drunken king," Nkongolo (see Heusch 1982a). This may exemplify the structuralist principle of the inversion of symbols from one reference group to another (see Heusch 1982a, 1982b, and Levi-Strauss 1982). Maxwell's assertion (1983:42) that the Bemba "solar" zigzag schematically represents the movement of the sun along the ecliptic is based on Zahan's discussion of Bamana lore (1979) and remains conjecture to be proven through field research among the Bemba. 8. Tabwa dualistic philosophy, Tabwa perception of the moon as fundamentally ambiguous, and the ways and con- texts in which this ambiguity generates key metaphors are themes discussed in much of my writing. See, for instance, Roberts 1986b and Roberts forthcoming A. 9. "Semantic equivalence" is exemplified in Roberts 1988a and is best demonstrated by Dominique Zahan (1980) in his catalogue raisonnec and analysis of over 500 chi wara head- dresses. My own inspiration in this regard is drawn in part from Claude Levi-Strauss's The Way of the Masks, in which he asserts that "as in the case of myths, masks, too, cannot be interpreted in and by themselves as separate objects. Looked upon from the semantic point of view, a myth acquires sense only after it is returned to its transformation set. Similarly, one type of mask...echoes other types...while it assumes its own individuality" (1982:13-14). The structuralist writings of Luc de Heusch (1982a, 1982b) allow one to situate Tabwa masks in the "transformative set" of Bantu-speaking peo- ples, who share a common logic. Werner (1971:10) finds a "basic language correspondence" among Tabwa and their immediate Luba and Bemba neighbors of between 70 and 90 percent, for instance, which underscores the commonality of language, logic, and a "transformative set" implied through- out the present paper. 10. A spiral is a more active representation of the same con- cept of concentric circles, making the implication of evolu- tion over time more obvious. Thanks to Chris Roy for discussion of this point (pers. com., 1989). 11. Malcolm McLeod (1976:99) has proposed a useful distinc- tion between "statement" and "process" art that closely fol- lows Victor Turner's (1970:95) between ceremony and ritual, respectively. Statement art is confirmatory of some status quo, as exemplified in the regalia of royalty, while process art is goal oriented and transformative, and often entails the use of magic. On Tabwa statement and process art, see Roberts 1986a:10-16; for a survey of statement art objects among Zairian peoples(although not referred to as such), see Lema Gwete 1986. 12. Chiefs closely related to the Tabwa who live on the south- eastern shores of Lake Tanganyika cut these precious disks into balaimwelzi-like triangles called vinbangwa that were given to "direct descendants" (Hatchell 1928:28). A porcelain trade copy of a kinbangwa is affixed to the nkaka headdress seen in Figure 6. 13. A turn-of-the-century photograph of a Tabwa woman, reproduced in Roberts 1988b:43, shows a spiral motif "inscribed" in the scarification of the woman's shoulder blades. This, it is suggested, alludes to the same symbolism of a spiral denoting a person's descendance; but reference to one member of a paradigmatic set necessarily allows and makes potential metonymic allusion to all other members as well. See also Roberts 1986c. 14. Details of the advent and significance of Kibawa in the context of radical change in late-nineteenth-century political economy are presented in Roberts 1982, 1984, 1988c. On igiiul and related earth spirits among central Bantu peoples, see Werner 1971 and the essays in Schoffeleers 1979. 15. Kevin Maxwell discusses similar use of a cave near Kasama in northeastern Zambia by Bemba (and probably Bemba-speaking southern Tabwa). He suggests that "these places are sacred to the Bemba because their engulfing sounds create a panharmonic center, which can integrate and motivate the rest of their fragmented experience. The whole- ness makes them whole again" (1983:88). 101 _ --_ __ __I __ _ _._.__ .. L_._ ... _ I II LI</page><page sequence="14">16. Similarly, Louis Oger writes of the rise of spirit posses- sion "among the oppressed and downtrodden" Bemba in 1907, when the British implemented far-reaching agricultural and village consolidation reforms, thus disrupting social life; and again in about 1960 when "pre-independence years brought a certain amount of insecurity, uncertainty and changes to traditional society" (1972:1). 17. Nkaka is a proto-Bantu word that finds widespread use among western Bantu-speaking peoples. My thanks to Jan Vansina for discussion of this point (pers. com., 1989). As he suggests, "The mask is the pangolin." Mary Douglas (1975) has described how singular and "good to think" the pan- golin is for the Lele of Zaire, and I shall discuss somewhat similar Tabwa beliefs about this singular beast in a forthcom- ing book. The magical substances used in iknkn headdresses are discussed more fully in Roberts 1980:367-68 and in Davis-Roberts 1980. 18. It goes without saying that Mbudye has changed with the times, just as the Luba political economy has. These days, folklore troupes of Mbudye dancers perform nationally and even internationally, and ostensibly, it seems that entertain- ment has replaced many of the earlier sacred purposes of the society. Still, as is implied by Luba Bwana Vidye mediums (who may no longer be directly linked to Mbudye as their predecessors appear to have been) wearing "beaded diadems" andby the use of beaded masks by Luba-influ- enced Mbudye members among Tabwa and others living north of Lake Mweru, Mbudye seems a vital nexus of metaphors that still helps people to cope with their changing circumstances. Thanks to Bill Dewey for discussion of this point (pers. com., 1989). 19. According to another account, Nkongolo originated Mbudye shortly before his death at the hands of Mbidi Kiluwe's son, Kalala Ilunga, telling his people that the Mbudye dances would be a way to remember him and that they should oblige Kalala Ilunga to recognize this with gifts to the dancers (Kirschenbilder 1941). Furthermore, the dried genitals of Nkongolo "became the emblem of royal descent and royal authority," and Nkongolo, as a possessing spirit, "consecrated the instalment of the royal court by its spiritual support" (Theuws 1964:7). It may seem curious that Nkongolo should be considered the originator of Mbudye and consecrator of Luba royalty, since Nkongolo was over- thrown by Mbidi Kiluwe and his son, Kalala Ilunga, and it is they whom Reefe (1981) contends to be the heroes of Mbudye and the founders of Luba sacred kingship. This is an indication that too literal an interpretation of these mythi- cal figures may impose a "rational" dualistic structure (as defined in Western terms), when indeterminacy and mul- tireferentiality are being represented. Culture heroes may personify opposed qualities or open hypothesis itself. This is the case for central Bantu origin myths, in which heroes such as Mbidi Kiluwe are explicitly dichotomous, being half- human, half-wax, and so presenting opposition in their very anatomy; and in which the genre of anti-heroes that includes Nkongolo Mwamba personifies liminality itself. See Roberts forthcoming A and Roberts forthcoming B. 20. The association between Lolo Inang'ombe and the tor- toise reflects a more basic linguistic and conceptual set shared by Luba with other central Bantu peoples. Ryangombe is an important culture hero for Rwandan peo- ples, for instance (see Heusch 1982b). For Tabwa, a l1ang'om7be is a tortoise shell filled with powerful magical ingredients that allows sorcerers to fly through the night as they search for victims; they are seen by ordinary people as "shooting stars." Jan Vansina (my thanks for this personal communication, 1989) suggests instead that lyang'ombe may be "a borrowed 'chic' name for an older cluster of values/convictions," dating from the mid-nineteenth-centu- ry when Tabwa came in contact with Yeke invaders from east of Lake Tanganyika. Through them, Tabwa may have gained indirect information about significant intralacustrine heroes such as Ryangombe. These matters will be discussed further in future writing. 21. The dictionaries of Van Acker (1907:58), the White Fathers (1954:658), and Van Avermaet &amp; Mbuya (1954:575) offer explanations of this important verb in the closely relat- ed Tabwa, Bemba, and Luba languages, respectively. Other meanings and associations indicate that the verb points to the magical quality of "finding" or achieving what one "desires," and the manner in which ancestral spirits play a role in this process. 22. See Van Acker 1907:71, White Fathers 1954:821-22, and Van Avermaet &amp; Mbuya 1954:780-81. Iron-smelting and other cultural transformations associated with culture heroes are discussed in Roberts 1980. 23. While some of these Luba nkakn headdresses are striking- ly similar to their Tabwa counterparts (as is the one shown in Fig. 9), others have a different play of isosceles triangles. One of the two Luba nlkaka headdresses in the Stanley Collection at the University of Iowa (no. 1986.115) has four squares across the brow, each of which is divided into four triangles whose apexes meet at the center of the square; the other (no. 1986.81) has a large central triangle whose base extends across the entire brow, with an internal, concentric triangle of a different color as its central "eye." See the photos of other Luba nkakn in Burton 1961. 24. The same manifestation among Lakeside Tabwa would be said to be possession by Mtumbi, the anthropomorphic aardvark who is the hero of an important version of the Tabwa origin myth. In important ways, Mtumbi is the con- ceptual equivalent of the Luba hero Mbidi Kiluwe; aard- varks are also metaphorically linked to pangolins in Tabwa thought. See Roberts 1980: chap. 1, and Roberts forthcoming A. 25. Kevin Maxwell (1983) offers some interesting insights into the phenomenology of sound, speaking, and oral tradi- tions among Bemba that are relevant to the study of data such as these from neighboring Tabwa. His sections on "oral time" and "orality and power" are especially useful; but his static sense of Bemba religion and his willingness to dismiss Bemba spirit possession and other recent changes in reli- gious forms as "superstitious" (p. 132) are absurd. My thanks to Robert Cancel for bringing Maxwell's work to my attention. 26. My discussion of the Lenshina movement is based upon Andrew Roberts's long article (1970) and Wim van Binsbergen's "Religious Innovation and Political Conflict in Zambia:The Lumpa Rising" (1981:266-316). Both authors review the considerable literature on the Lumpa movement. No author consulted to date discusses the beaded headdress- es or other material culture associated with the Lenshina movement. Mrs. Carey's information on the object is limited to knowing that these were among objects seized from a woman associated with the Lenshina movement, probably in Kasama District. As she suggests, Father Corbeil, the founder of the Moto Moto Museum, "is a Hero of the Zambia Republic for his work for Zambian independence, and was thus in a good position to apply to acquire such politically sensitive things as these.... In 1971, he kept them in a box under his bed, but by 1980 they were on view" (my thanks for this personal communication, 1989). 27. Bemba believe that composers of songs are divinely inspired and are called ngulu, as was Alice Lenshina (Oger 1972:6). The "book" of Lenshina is a reference to the magical powers Tabwa and others in this part of Central Africa attribute to literacy. Lenshina's book could not be read by local missionaries or administrators, and even the Pope was unable to read it when the book was sent to him, some Bemba said (Oger 1962:129). Such a belief follows a mythical structure common to Bemba and Tabwa accounts of conflict between African and European religions and expressive idioms;see Roberts 1984 for a Tabwa example. 28. Douglas Werner discusses the cultural area in which Bemba, Tabwa, and other people in this part of central Africa share a belief in ngtulu earth spirits, and suggests that "belief in possession by ngulu spirits developed in response to the ritual needs of the Bemba people after the establishment of the Bemba royal cult," serving as "an alternative to the ritual system of the bena ngandu chiefs" as state formation pro- gressed (1971:21). It would be interesting to follow up on Werner's work by asking the ethnoarchaeologist's question, "When do ethnic units identify themselves in material cul- ture?" (Hodder 1982:1). In other words, would it be fruitful to consider use of beaded masks and headdresses as an index of membership in a particular social or ethnic refer- ence group?

I also wish to thank several people, not acknowl- edged in the text or notes, who read the manuscript and offered valuable suggestions: John Atherton (Portland State University), P.E.H. Hair (University of Liverpool), and M.D. McLeod (Museum of Mankind, London). Illustration captions are given with the following data, as known, listed in the order indicated here: Description. Attribution, country. Medium, dimension (height, unless indicated otherwise). Current collection, registration num- ber, acquisition date and immediate provenance; prior provenance. 1. The term "prehistory" is used loosely here to define the time, within any given cultural area, before the appearance of written documentation of any kind by first-hand observa- tion, i.e., roughly before the end of the fifteenth century in the area of the Sierra Leone Estuary, before the sixteenth cen- tury along the Sierra Leone coast in general, before the end of the nineteenth century in Eastern Province, etc. 2. Some of the ceramic heads have been dated by thermolu- minescence analysis, but the results are of little scientific use. TL is extremely unreliable, especially in isolation from an archaeological context. 3. Hill has expressed concern particularly about the variabili- ty of dating from diverse portions of the cross-section of a tree trunk or limb, and the time elapsed from cutting to carv- ing (pers. com., 1989). Regarding the first, it is my experience that Sierra Leone carvers today are careful to cut a piece of wood no larger than the size needed for the figure; thus little wood is wasted, and the figure would include the range from oldest to newest tissue. Small figures would comprise tree rings spanning a relatively short period of time. On the second issue, it is unlikely that significant time passes between cutting and carving in the rain-forested regions of Africa, where decay and erosion rapidly consume dead material, both animal and vegetal. 4.1 am indebted to William Hart for pointing me to this passage. 5. The emphasis is mine. Simon Ottenberg writes that the term kawono is known to one of his Limba informants as "a big tree with very hard wood, a tall tree that grows very old. It is not the cottonwood tree," and it is without fruits or nuts (pers. com., 1989). Ottenberg believes that, since "1" and "n" are interchangeable from one dialect of Limba to another, this may be the kuwolo ko wood listed in Clarke 1922:29: "hard, red wood tree, fine for building lumber, also used for mortars." Joseph Opala concurs that ku-wolo may be rele- vant, as the source of a rust-colored pigment used to dye hu- ronko shirts, and says it is called the "King of Trees" (pers. com., 1989). 6. The emphasis is mine. The implication here is only that the figures were in place before the nineteenth century, but how much earlier is anyone's guess. 7. Some figures are said to have been acquired in a particular locale, but we cannot be certain that they originated there. If they were, in fact, discovered there, were they made there? Can we assume that the style did not originate in areas where it is not discovered? With only negative evidence at hand, the answer, of course, is "no." 8. Twisted headbands or turbans occur in the inland style of stone figures (Figs. 14,15), leading Ditmer (1967) to suspect an influence from the Islamic north, and the presence of the Mande. This is conjecture, assuming.that the turban was a common Mande Islamic convention then, as it is not now. References cited Atherton, John H. 1980.

Sources for these photos include Timothy Garrard, the Barbier-Muellers, art historian Doran Ross, art dealers Rene and Denise David, Life photographer Eliot Elisofon, and the Basel Mission Archive. 2. The decision not to include full citations apparently was not Garrard's, for in his earlier publications he has been fas- tidious about citing sources. 3. Support for Garrard's dating of this piece is found in the recent publication by Martha Ehrlich (1989) of several gold beads, stylistically almost identical to the Barbier-Mueller example, that can positively be dated to the eighteenth century. 4. It was formerly in the collection of Sir Cecil Armitage, who participated in a British military campaign against the Asante in 1896. Armitage may have acquired the bracelet at that time as part of the booty taken from Asantehene (king of Asante) Prempeh, who was sent into exile by the British. 5. Garrard writes: "The gold resources of the south-east lie in the territories of a complex cluster of ethnic groups who, for want of a better name, may be termed Akan-related. These are peoples who share a common (though sometimes remote) linguistic ancestry with the Akan of Ghana. Some have argued that they should be termed Akan, citing a num- ber of shared cultural traits. But while they had some histori- cal contact with the Akan, the Ivoirian groups never used this name to describe themselves, and such cultural similari- ties as exist are outweighed by other marked divergences of language, material culture and social organization" (p. 86). 6. Throughout the chapter Garrard uses the term "Ebrie," the name commonly found in the literature for one of the peo- ples living in the Lagoons region. "Ebrie" is in fact a pejora- tive term used by their neighbors, the Abure, that means "people of the mud." This term should be permanently abandoned in favor of "Kyaman" or "Tshaman," which is what the Kyaman prefer to call themselves; it simply means "the people" (Monica Visona, pers. com., June 16,1989). 7. Garrard's discussion of this event and other uses of gold in the Lagoons region would have been enhanced by refer- ence to Monica Visona's Ph.D. dissertation (1983:55-62, 69), which deals, in part, with the use of gold among the Akye. 8. There are a few notable exceptions to this general lack of acquisition data: for instance, Garrard notes that the above- mentioned pair of earrings that were commissioned by Madame Barbier-Mueller were made by the Peul goldsmith Amadou Diallo, in Mopti, in 1986 (Fig. 2). 9. Examples of the publications the Barbier-Mueller Museum contributors HAROLD COURLANDER is a novelist and specialist in the oral traditions of African, Afro-American, and Native American cultures. He is the author of a number of books on Haitian life, including The Drum and the Hoe (1960) and The Bordeaux Narrative (forthcoming). FREDERICK LAMP is curator of the Arts of Africa, the Americas, and Oceania at the Baltimore Museum of Art and a consulting editor for African Arts. He has conducted field research in Sierra Leone and Guinea. ALLEN F. ROBERTS teaches anthropology and African-American world studies and is co-director (with Christopher D. Roy) of the Project for the Advanced Study of Art and Life in Africa (PASALA) at the University of Iowa. RAYMOND A. SILVERMAN is an assistant professor of art history and curator of the African art collections at Michigan State University. Since 1979 he has been conduct- ing research in central Ghana and eastern C6te d'lvoire on the impact of Islam on the aesthetic traditions of the Akan. 103</page></plain_text>
