The flow of his literalist translation is interrupted by two distinct features: sets of alternate renderings, which involve the provision of two or three translation equivalents in the target (Arabic) language, and interpolative additions, which consist of nuclear and non- nuclear complements, meant to clarify the meaning or the background of the biblical text. These features are found in parallel Karaite Bible translations, all of which emanate from a known circle of Karaite exegetes associated with the Karaite House of Study established in Jerusalem during the tenth century by Abiu Ya'qiub Yiusuf ben Nuh. This article summarizes two major features found in the Arabic translation of the Pentateuch prepared by the eleventh-century Karaite exegete Yeshucah ben Yehudah: alternate renderings and additions. These may also be considered characteristic of a general tendency in Karaite Bible translation. Their study is based on my doctoral research into linguistic and literary aspects of Karaite Bible translations written in Jerusalem during the tenth and elev- enth centuries.1 Jerusalem functioned as the major spiritual center of Karaism throughout the tenth century, when major trends in Karaite reli- gious ideology, biblical study, and linguistic investigation were being consolidated, and in the eleventh century, when such trends reached their fullest expression. The two major Karaite exegetes who are known to have translated the Bible into Arabic during this 1 Meira Polliack, The Karaite Translation Tradition of the Pentateuch into Ara- bic: A Linguistic Study of Karaite Translations of the Pentateuch from the Tenth to the Eleventh Centuries C.E.

The Karaite scholars engaged in this activity of Bible interpretation and translation are mostly associ- ated with a house of study (dar lil-'ilm) which was established in Jerusalem by a known Karaite contemporary of Yefet, Abil Ya'qiib Yuisuf ben Niuh. This Karaite academy is described in Ibn al-Hiltl's chronicle.4 The Arabic chronicle as well as other historical testi- monies seem to suggest that this academy functioned as a center for Karaite Bible study during the three consecutive generations between Yefet and Yeshu'ah. It is therefore possible to postulate that some of the translation methods used by Yeshu'ah (to be dis- cussed below) were developed in the wider context of a Karaite exegetical tradition. The underlying feature of Yeshu'ah's translation, which is also common to Karaite Bible translations in general, may best be defined as structural literalism. That is to say, Karaite translators exhibit a natural tendency to translate the Hebrew source text word for word into Arabic, often in clear imitation of Hebrew grammar and lexicon. They may thus have been motivated by the affect of sound-similarity in their choice of cognate roots and by the He- 2 For a survey of the extant manuscripts of Yefet's Arabic Bible translations and commentaries, see G.

However, the Karaite translators seem to deviate from this structural literal- ism when they are faced with an overpowering semantic gap be- tween the Hebrew source language and the Arabic target language. It is then that the imitative flow of their translation is disturbed and its pace interrupted by sets of alternate renderings at the lexical level or by interpolative additions at the syntactical and textual level. These interruptions demonstrate a process in which the translation ceases to strive for literalist imitation and begins to take upon itself the role of active interpretation of the biblical text. The following examples of additions and alternate renderings have been collated from Yeshucah ben Yehudah's shorter commen- tary on and translation of the Pentateuch on which he began to work in the summer of 1054, at the request of the Egyptian Karaite dig- nitary Abiui al-Hasan Da'uid ben clmran ben Levi who commissioned it for his son Abui Sacid. A testimony to this affect is provided by al-Hiti and more importantly by Yeshucah himself in the Introduc- tion to his shorter commentary on Genesis found in a manuscript of the second Firkovitch collection.5 The first half of Yeshucah's trans- lation of Genesis has partly survived in the Firkovitch manuscript, which is written in Hebrew characters.6 Other portions of his trans- lation of Genesis and of the rest of the Pentateuch have survived in very fine and early manuscripts written in Arabic script, such as Or. 2544-2546 of the British Library. In these, the entire Hebrew verse is often transcribed into Arabic letters and is followed by an Arabic translation, verse by verse.7 The commentary follows the transla- tion, at the end of the given biblical section. The examples of Yeshucah's translation presented in this article have been selected from these earlier manuscripts as well as from BL Or. 2560, which is also written in Arabic characters, and BL Or. 5 II Firkovitch Hebr.-Arab. 1/3204 in the Saltykov-Shchedrin State Public Li- brary, St. Petersburg. Parts of this Introduction were published by J. Mann, Texts and Studies, 2:34-35, and by H. Ben Shammai, Inn l nvW', pp. 6-7. 6 Folios are not marked in the Firkovitch manuscript, and some of its leaves are confused. It has been cited in this article according to a successive numbering of its individual folios as pages. 7 For the practice of the medieval Karaites to transcribe Hebrew into Arabic let- ters, see R.

They are representative of many other cases found throughout Yeshu'ah's translation of the Pentateuch. Parallel translations found in other Karaite works are cited, when relevant, from the commentaries of Yefet ben 'Eli (BL Or. 2462, 2463, 2465, and Paris [Zotenberg Catalogue] 283, in Hebrew script), David ben Bo'az (BL Or. 2403, in Arabic script), and from the work of 'Ali ben Suleiman, who, though active in the late elev- enth century, professes to have compiled his commentary on Num- bers (BL Or. 2563, in Arabic script) from the commentary of al- ra'is al-jalil Abiu Sa'id (probably David ben Bo'az) and from Abui al-Faraj Haruin's abridgement of the commentary of Abil Ya'qiib ibn Niuh-all members of what may be termed the Jerusalem circle of Karaite exegetes.8 Alternate Renderings A striking feature of Karaite translations is the lexical versatility and flexibility which they exhibit in dealing with the semantic gap between Hebrew and Arabic. In this respect Yeshu'ah ben Yehu- dah seems to have mastered the technique of alternate renderings, by which is meant the consecutive provision of sets of two or three translation equivalents in the Arabic in order to convey the sense of a single word in the Hebrew. It is possible to distinguish differ- ent degrees of semantic relationship between sets of alternatives. In certain cases, as in examples 1-5, the specialized Arabic lex- emes denote different possible meanings of the Hebrew source word and are clearly distinct from one another. It seems that the translator wished to give expression to the semantic range of the Hebrew origi- nal by providing its possible meanings: 1.

The re- construction is usually explained in the commentary that follows the translation. The translation itself offers interpretative semantic alternatives, based on the linguistic analysis or contextual reading of the rare word, as in examples 8 and 9: 8.

Yefet derives his third alternative: fawakih (=fruit) from 1nn (e.g., Song 4:13: otin tvo mv o)rnn-i vi).17 In gen- eral, Yefet introduces his alternate renderings by the term qila. Place names are also subject to alternate rendering. One of the ren- derings is usually more literal and provides the original Hebrew form or an Arabized form of the Hebrew word, while the other alternative is more concerned with identifying a recognizable geographic loca- tion or with supplying a translation of meaning. Yeshucah usually in- troduces such alternate renderings by the term yuqal rather than 'aw: In example 10 the first alternative provides a geographical iden- tification, while the second consists of an Arabized form of the word now: 10.

Yeshucah ben Yehudah tends to insert two kinds of additions into the translated text which may be defined as nuclear and non-nuclear additions. A. Nuclear additions are limited and usually consist of one or two words. Grammatically, they may be described as nuclear com- plements, that is, they are essential in clarifying the core meaning of a biblical sentence. These additions, appearing in the translated text, are clearly meant to fill in an apparent gap in the biblical wording. Examples 1 and 2 demonstrate Yeshucah's tendency to comple- ment a verb by adding its object (al-tacam, qabihan) into the trans- lated text: 1. Gen 24:33 ':)N5 1)305 ovt) Yeshucah (BL 2544 12b = F 3204 222) J?N CLa.lJI A W &lt; Then he set before him food to eat. 2.

The second and more prominent type of additions employed by Yeshucah in his translation are non-nuclear additions. In certain cases they may consist of single words or phrases, but normally they comprise lengthier clauses and even entire sentences. Gram- matically, they may be described as non-nuclear complements, since they are usually introduced into the translation in order to clarify the background of the biblical verse, rather than its essen- tial core meaning. This clarification may be predominantly textual,</page><page sequence="10">218 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW that is, concerned with the context of the biblical verse and with the restoration of a logical sequence in the narrative plot (ex- amples 3-10). It may also be extratextual, that is, additions may be inserted into the translation in order to serve as a response to theological difficulties which are found to exist in the original He- brew phrasing (examples 11-17). Textually interpretative additions which consist of one word are demonstrated in examples 3-5: 3. Gen 24:58 (BL 544 14a = F 3204 224) nm W 0m D tvfnn Yeshu'ah (BL 2544 14a) S kt&amp; JL.a,JI Li "1 Will you go with this man immediately? Yefet (BL 2465 31b) Or5N x ")i'nx x'm rv pvn l)vnx In this example Yeshu'ah and Yefet are concerned with a logical difficulty in the context of the biblical story. Their insistence on Rebekah departing immediately ('7jilan), or today (al-yawm), pro- vides a cohesive element lacking in the narrative plot. According to the biblical sequence it had already been agreed in principle that Rebekah should marry Isaac (Gen 24:50-51: iw2xD 1))rx I)' n-wvx llni nin; rnr, "let her be the wife of your master's son, as the Lord has spoken"). Therefore it logically follows that she may be asked of her opinion only concerning the immediacy of her departure. Yeshu'ah's tendency to add a construct noun into the translated text also fulfills an inner textual interpretative function: 4. Num 14:33 onot lnx))l Yeshu'ah (BL 2546 la): 4LJ o . And they will bear the harmful consequences of your excessive behaviour. Textually, it is difficult to actually "bear" a transgression. Theo- logically, the sons cannot be held actively responsible for their fa- thers' sin, yet may carry its results. A completion of the expression oDzl)i nflN ivxn is necessary, which logically clarifies its imagery and modifies the transference of guilt which it implies. Consider the similar addition of a construct in the following verse: 5. Num 14:34 fnlxn nfx onymtV Yeshu'ah (BL 2546 la) ____</page><page sequence="11">YESHUcAH BEN YEHUDAH'S TRANSLATION-POLLIACK 219 And you will know the reason why I have refrained from keeping [my word]. Another type of one word addition concerned with plot clarifica- tion is used by Yeshucah mostly in dialogue sequences or narrative sections dominated by verbs. The addition is meant to clarify the identity of the speaker or the protagonist. Such is the case in ex- ample 6, where the identification of Laban is necessary since it is not clear whether he or the servant ungirded the camels: 6.

Similarly, the same protagonist is identified as the speaker in the translation of the following verse: 7. Gen 24:33 rz m Yeshucah (BL 2544 12b) I ; J JLiU More extensive non-nuclear additions of clauses and sentences may also be motivated by the need to clarify the biblical sequence; in example 8 Yeshucah adds a relative clause in order to clarify the object of the verb -norp-: 8.

The narrative sequence contradicts the implication of this verse that such a communication may have actually taken place face to face, verbally. This would defeat the purpose of the entire story which tells of Israel's efforts to receive permission to pass through Edomite territory. The idea of a letter is therefore incorporated into the translation in order to clarify the narrative plot. Note also the unmistakable parallelism between the translations provided by Yeshu'ah and 'All ben Sulei- man, which suggests here, as in other cases, that they bear the mark of a common methodology or source of origin.

These ad- ditions often coincide with textual and linguistic difficulties, yet are distinct, at least in regard to their primary motivation. A common feature in Karaite translations is the insertion of a nominal referring to a mediating agent of God's will, as witnessed in examples 11-13: 11.

This is a relatively common procedure. Note that Yeshu'ah further modifies the anthropomor- phism by insisting that the angel came down at God's command.

Note that Yeshu'ah repeats and expands this theologically inter- pretative addition in his consistent rendering of the following verse: 14b. Gen 1:27 lnf N1: D)fl0'N o5S:' rn)m5:2 oItlThl nf D)fl0'N N-1:21 Yeshu'ah (F 3204 55) So God created men in the image he had chosen for them, that is, in the image of the angels. The principal reason for the additions inserted into the translation of Gen 1:26-27 is the avoidance of anthropomorphism. It is cer- tainly one of the most forceful extratextual concerns of the inter- preter, and as such it manages to impose itself onto the translation. Yet not only anthropomorphism serves as an extratextual incen- tive for an addition. Other religious motives may also underlie similar types of interpolation. In examples 15 and 16 Yeshu'ah transforms a declarative statement into a request which expresses a wish, by inserting an optative clause into the beginning of the translated sentence: 15.

The prophetic statement made by Abraham suggests that he may be endowed with special powers in predicting the future or even with the ability to command God to act on his behalf. In order to eliminate the theological difficulty implicit in this statement, Yeshu'ah employs this form of addition.</page><page sequence="15">YESHUcAH BEN YEHUDAH'S TRANSLATION-POLLIACK 223 16.

Here it is a religious concern with the possibility of divination on the part of the servant which has motivated the addition of an opta- tive clause (fa-'uridu 'an) that expresses the servant's wish rather than a possible act of sorcery on his part. In rabbinic literature the statement is considered a divination (GenR 60.3; bHul 95b).'8 The addition of a conditional clause may have been employed by Yeshu'ah for a similar purpose, as illustrated in example 17: 17.

By affixing a conditional clause onto the beginning of the trans- lation, Yeshu'ah transforms the syntax of the declarative sentence. The motivation is theological: he wishes to assert the omnipotence of the Lord. The builders will achieve their objective only if God "lets them." Conclusions It has been demonstrated that the phenomena of alternate ren- derings and additions occur in Yeshu'ah ben Yehudah's translation in response to the difficulties encountered by the translator in the process of transferring lexical and syntactical structures from He- brew into Arabic, and in dealing with the semantic gap between these source and target languages. 18 This rabbinic view is rejected by Yefet, Yeshu'ah, and 'Ali ben Suleiman in their commentaries on Gen 24:14; see S. L. Skoss, The Arabic Commentary of 'Ali ben Suleimdn the Karaite on the Book of Genesis, pp. 156-157.</page><page sequence="16">224 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW In regard to lexicon, where there is only partial correspondence of the semantic fields across the two languages, Yeshu'ah is pro- vided with the necessary space for maneuver in order to assert his creative ability. He does so, in practice, by suggesting alternate ren- derings. These renderings function as translation options and they allow the search for the most accurate translation equivalent to be conducted, most unusually, within the translated text itself. By re- cording these translation options, Yeshu'ah enables the reader of the translated text to realize the range of semantic variants implied in the source text and to partake in the search after its meaning. By leaving the choice between these options open, Yeshu'ah further in- vites the reader to apply his own interpretative reasoning, similar to that of the translator, in the selection process of the most appropri- ate translation equivalent. The act of translation deepens the commentator's sensitivity to- wards the indigenous qualities of the sOurce text as a self-contained literary unit, which must be understood within its context, and must be clarified accordingly in the Arabic rendering. The elliptical qualities of biblical narrative challenge Yeshu'ah's comprehension of syntactical and cohesive elements, primarily within the biblical source text itself, and consequently within the Arabic target text. Unlike the translation of lexemes, in conveying the sense of en- tire clauses, sentences, and narrative spans, it is imperative that the translator make an interpretative choice as to the meaning of a tex- tual unit. The use of variants on this level would render the trans- lated text largely incomprehensible. As witnessed in this selection of examples, the phenomenon of inner textual (nuclear and non- nuclear) additions reflects this interpretative function in Yeshu'ah ben Yehudah's translation. There are instances when his interpreta- tive choice is influenced by extratextual theological considerations. Nevertheless, as a rule, Yeshu'ah seems to be well attuned and beholden to the inner textual requirements of the biblical sequence itself. The phenomena of alternate renderings and additions is indica- tive of a general tendency found in a wide range of Karaite trans- lations. A thorough examination of various manuscript sources of these translations undertaken as part of my comprehensive study of Karaite Bible translations suggests that alternate renderings and ad- ditions form part of a distinct series of translation features. These features are clearly discernible and seem to indicate the existence</page><page sequence="17">YESHUcAH BEN YEHUDAH'S TRANSLATION-POLLIACK 225 of a separate and well-developed translation tradition which was shared by Karaite scholars in Jerusalem and may have evolved there during the tenth and eleventh centuries as an integral part of the varied and intensive forms of biblical study which characterize the Golden Age of Karaite exegesis. This tradition certainly exhib- its traits typical of Karaite pursuits at that time: a high degree of linguistic interest concerning the biblical lexicon as well as an un- mistakable textual orientation.19 19 In addition to Bible translations and commentaries, the surviving corpus of texts written by the Jerusalem Karaites includes key works on Hebrew lexicography and grammar by David ben Abraham al-FasI, Kitab Jami' al-'alfCz, ed.
