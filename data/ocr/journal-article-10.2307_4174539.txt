<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Wounded Earth in Paradise Lost by Richard J. DuRocher I T the critical moment in Paradise Lost, Milton introduces a puz- zling personification. The personification appears immediately after Eve eats the forbidden fruit: So saying, her rash hand in evil hour Forth reaching to the Fruit, she pluck'd, she eat: Earth felt the Wound, and Nature from her seat Sighing through all her Works gave signs of woe, That all was lost. (9.780-84)1 The personification, elaborated, reappears immediately after Adam eats the forbidden fruit: Earth trembl'd from her entrails, as again In pangs, and Nature gave a second groan, Sky low'r'd, and muttering Thunder, some sad drops Wept at completing of the mortal Sin Original. (9.1000-1004) I Editors of Paradise Lost have been more concerned with Milton's personification of the Earth than have critics. For example, the Romantic editor Henry John Todd noted of lines 782-84: "I need not observe to the reader with what conciseness and energy, with what beauty and judgement, Milton's sense of completing the mortal sin original [his italics] is drawn." Of the parallel passage at 9.1000, Todd, after noting the relevance of Book Four of the Aeneid, observed that the "sublimity and pathos" of Milton's passage are nonetheless unmatched in ancient and modern poetry. See The Poetical Works of John Milton, ed. Henry John Todd, six vols. (London, i826), 3:206. For assurance that the figure does amount to personification, see M. H. Abrams, A Glossary of Literary Terms, 5th ed. (New York: Holt, Rinehart, and Winston, 1988), 67, where Milton's lines are cited to define the term. 93 ? 1996 The University of North Carolina Press</page><page sequence="2">94 The Wounded Earth in Paradise Lost The fundamental question can be simply put: What is the personifica- tion of the Earth doing at this pivotal moment in Paradise Lost? For all its originality and importance, the significance of this figure has virtu- ally escaped critics' attention.2 At first glance, one might see this double personification essentially as rhetoric, as the Miltonic narrator's way of intensifying readers' re- sponse to a human tragedy. In other artworks by other artists, intensifi- cation would be precisely the purpose that such a device would serve. The rising strains of film soundtracks, for example, intensify audiences' reactions to important scenes. Certainly the moment in Milton's nar- rative is emotionally tense, for it is the climax of the tragic plot. In the opening proem of Book Nine, Milton explicitly identifies his presen- tation of the Fall as tragedy. In the present passage, terms associated with pathos ("[slighing," "woe") reinforce emotions proper to Aristo- telian tragedy. The timely appearance of the personified Earth, with a parallel per- sonification of Nature, does more, however, than intensify our experi- ence of a human tragedy. Essentially, I will argue, the figure extends the scope of the Fall from a human to a cosmological event. Toward elucidating this key personification, I aim in this essay to establish sev- eral closely connected propositions regarding it: 1. The scant scriptural background provided Milton with ample free- dom yet sufficient authority to include the figure. 2. Seen in the sequence of the Earth's personifications throughout the poem, this figure marks a turning point in Milton's argument. Through anthropomorphic imagery of childbirth, Milton shows that during the Fall the Earth reverses the process of Creation. 3. For this imagery, Milton adapted Stoic scientific and literary ac- counts of the Earth as a living organism. 4. Within the epic tradition, Milton's personification recalls both Lucretius's Epicurean account of the Earth as insensate and Virgil's depiction of Tellus as a nuptial deity in order to overgo them. By cre- ating a dynamic role for the Earth within God's plot, Milton restores the Earth's sentience while transforming her from pagan goddess to an agent of providence. 2 All quotations from Milton's poetry in my essay are reproduced from the edition by Merritt Y. Hughes, John Milton, Complete Poems and Major Prose (Indianapolis: Odyssey, 1957), hereafter cited as Hughes.</page><page sequence="3">Richard J. DuRocher 95 In all of these cases, Milton insists that the wounded Earth is a matter of cosmological fact. What is especially remarkable is that this entire cluster of implications is made possible by Milton's economical poetic utterance: "Earth felt the Wound." We might begin by recalling that no such personification appears in the scriptural account of the Fall.3 In Genesis 3.6 the biblical narrator describes Eve and Adam eating the fruit, then proceeds directly to this verse in the Authorized Version: And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they were naked; and they sewed fig leaves together, and made themselves aprons. With its notorious fig leaves indicating the sinners' shame, the Bible tells a story of human action and human consequences. The narrator of Genesis focuses exclusively on the change in human consciousness dur- ing the Fall. Milton's personification, in contrast, shifts the focus away from the immediate human drama to show that human sin somehow injures the natural world. While shifting attention away from Adam and Eve, personification by its nature indicates that injury in a way palpable to human beings. Scripture elsewhere, however, does depict a personified Earth. Matthew 27.51 describes how "the earth did quake" at the death of Jesus; Milton may have relied upon the principle of typology to con- nect Adam and Eve's fatal act with Christ's death. The fourth-century Christian apologist, Arnobius of Sicca, who was well versed in Epi- curean philosophy, makes the quasi-scientific observation on Matthew 27.51 that "all the elements of the universe were thrown into confu- sion."3 Arnobius thus demonstrates one way of mingling scriptural commentary and Roman science. Milton's inaugural poetic work, his paraphrase of Psalm 114 at age fifteen, contains a personification of the Earth which anticipates his approach to that mingling in Paradise Lost. In Milton's rendition of the psalm, the psalmist commands the Earth to recognize God's superior power: Shake earth, and at the presence be aghast Of him that ever was, and aye shall last, That glassy floods from rugged rocks can crush, And make soft rills from fiery flint-stones gush. 3 Arnobius, Adversus Gentes, trans. as The Case against the Pagans, two vols. (Westmin- ster, MD: Newman Press, 1949), 1:53. The comments of Arnobius on Lucretius are in- cluded in the edition of De rerum natura edited by Dionysius Lambinus (Frankfurt, 1583).</page><page sequence="4">96 The Wounded Earth in Paradise Lost The quaking and shaking Earth found living counterparts among Mil- ton's contemporaries, who followed the scriptural Earth's lead in thus responding to the divine presence. As biblical metaphors, the personi- fications from Psalms and Matthew provided Milton with scriptural authority for employing the device in Paradise Lost. Moreover, they may have suggested to the poet ways in which theology and natural history are inevitably intertwined. Like so much in Milton's great argument, the personification of the wounded Earth in Paradise Lost lays claim to universal significance. It insists that the Fall involves more than a human tragedy, and more than a shift in human consciousness. Our first conclusion, then, can be simply put: The Fall has a palpable effect on nature. In Milton's poem, we are shown immediately what Adam and Eve will only later be forced to realize: that the choices of human beings intimately affect the entire scale of being. Chiefly, yet still perhaps mysteriously, Adam and Eve's choice wounds the Earth. II In attempting to explain the Earth's appearance at the moment of the Fall, we need to examine the larger pattern of the Earth's role in Paradise Lost. A numerical analysis indicates that Earth's prominence at the climax matches her persistent appearance throughout the poem. Milton refers to the Earth by name in every book of Paradise Lost; the word "Earth" in its substantive form appears a total, according to the Ingram and Swaim concordance, of 204 times.' That number puts Earth in the same league-at least in terms of frequency-with "All," which William Empson isolated as the epic's preeminent "complex word."5 Surprisingly, Earth is named twice as often as other major characters including Adam (105), Death (ti8), and Eve (98). Laura Lockwood has analyzed the variety of meanings of the word "Earth" in five cate- gories: (C) soil; (2) the world in which we live; (3) regarded as planet or heavenly body; (4) the inhabitants of the planet; (5) one of the four elements. Among the second category, Lockwood describes a subset in which the Earth is "more or less clearly personified," and lists seven 4 A Concordance to Milton's English Poetry, eds.

DuRocher 97 passages from Paradise Lost: 1.687 ff.; 5.338 ff.; 7.453 ff.; 7.501 ff.; 9.782 ff.; 9.1000 ff.; 9.1041.6 Although one might arrive at a different total of personifications, Lockwood's list comprises what is unquestionably a meaningful, coherent sequence. Retracing that sequence goes a long way toward explaining the Earth's appearance during the Fall. The first example of the personified Earth in Paradise Lost appears in Book One, amid the scene of the devils building Pandaemonium. Re- flecting in miniature the epic's double plot, the passage recapitulates the spread of sin from demonic to human agents: Mammon led them on, Mammon, the least erected Spirit that fell From Heav'n, for ev'n in Heav'n his looks and thoughts Were always downward bent, admiring more The riches of Heav'n's pavement, trodd'n Gold, Then aught divine or holy else enjoy'd In vision beatific: by him first Men also, and by his suggestion taught, Ransack'd the Center, and with impious hands Rifl'd the bowels of thir mother Earth For Treasures better hid. Soon had his crew Op'n'd into the Hill a spacious wound And digg'd out ribs of Gold. (1.678-90) Carolyn Merchant has associated this passage with the late-sixteenth- and early-seventeenth-century debate over mining.7 Milton's poetic argument goes deeper, locating the ethics of mining in the long history of universal abuse of the Earth. Chronologically, of course, the devils' digging must precede that of human beings. Yet Milton complicates that expected order by interpolating human digging before completing 6 Laura Lockwood, A Lexicon to Milton's Poems (London: Macmillan, 1907). 7 See Merchant, The Death of Nature: Women, Ecology, and the Scientific Revolution (New York: Harper-Collins, 1990), 33-39. Merchant compares Milton's passage with Spenser's image of "sacrilegous" digging of the Earth in Faerie Queene 2.7.17, and she cites Wal- ter M. Kendrick's article, "Earth of Flesh, Flesh of Earth: Mother Earth in the Faerie Queene," RenQ 27 (1974): 533-48, for Spenser's association of lust with mining. In Ken- drick's analysis, however, Spenser's Mother Earth is a far different entity than Milton's, an emblem of "mindless fecundity.' The conclusion of Kendrick's essay emphasizes Spenser's Calvinist view: man's chief task, which is the central preoccupation of The Faerie Queene, is "to rule and vanquish the earth in his flesh before the earth reclaims it" (548). For Milton, the Earth is something larger than ourselves, something with which we are nevertheless intimately involved.</page><page sequence="6">98 The Wounded Earth in Paradise Lost his account of Mammon's digging. A further complication arises from Milton's deployment of a Janus-faced adverb "first," which may attach itself either to Mammon (taught by him first) or to the verbs (men first "Ransack'd," "Rifl'd"). The passage's account of ransacking some abstract "Center" seems at first to describe a simple case of burglary. As Milton's sentence goes on to specify "rifl[ing] the bowels of thir mother Earth," however, the crime is compounded. With the Earth cast as "thir mother," the im- pious men are, at least metaphorically, guilty of assault, and assault of a vicious and universally condemned kind. From the perspective of the Law, attacking mother Earth parodies the Mosaic command- ment to "Honor thy Father and Mother." Milton's graphic description of their assault makes it even more disgusting and damnable. The sin- ners "rifle" the bowels of Mother Earth: as the root sense of that verb, the Oxford English Dictionary gives "to scratch, to scrape." Transfered from that violent and violating act are the OED's other definitions of "to rifle" as "to plunder" and "to affect strongly or injuriously." This horrible scraping of mother Earth's "entrails," a term Milton later in the poem associates with the birth canal, amounts to a sickeningly palpable simulacrum of an abortion. Appropriately, anthropomorphic images conclude Milton's scene. The devils' opening of a "spacious wound" may recall the wound opened in Christ's side during the Crucifixion. Certainly the devils' plunder of "ribs of Gold" echoes the Yahwistic account of Eve's creation from Adam's rib. Either way, the passage af- firms a ringing ethical imperative: Violating the Earth amounts to a desecration of divine creation. As so often in Paradise Lost, Milton parallels that negative, demonic scene with a positive, ideal one. We first glimpse the personified Earth in its healthy, creative form as part of our introduction to Edenic life in Book Five. Upon the arrival of the archangel Raphael in Eden, Eve brings to their repast a comucopia of fruits and grains, "whatever Earth all-bearing Mother yields" (5.338). At first glance, this epithet may ap- pear merely decorative. On reflection, it is thematically crucial. It links the Earth's fecundity, already well known to Eve and Adam, with the angel's ontological analogy of the universe as a flowering, fruitful plant (5.469-503). That analogy makes possible Adam and Eve's understand- ing of the scale of being. The dialogue with the angel also shows Adam and Eve the power of their choice to affect their place in the created order-indeed to affect the created order itself. The positive picture of the Earth as life-bearing mother is developed</page><page sequence="7">Richard J. DuRocher 99 in great detail in Milton's rendition of the hexameral creation account. In Book Seven of Paradise Lost, the angel tells of the Earth's part in the creation of animals: The Sixt, and of Creation last arose With ev'ning Harps and Matin, when God said, Let th'Earth bring forth Soul living in her kind, Cattle and Creeping things, and Beasts of the Earth, Each in their kind. The Earth obey'd, and straight Op'ning her fertile Womb teem'd at a Birth Innumerous living Creatures, perfet forms, Limb'd and full grown. (7.449-56) Citing this passage, Stephen Fallon argues that Milton's animated imagery reflects his commitment to animist materialism, the belief that matter can possess the traits of mind.8 Indeed Milton depicts the Earth as both animate and mindful. In Milton's version, Day Six of the Hex- ameron results not simply in the creation of animals, but in their par- turition from the already living, personified Earth. Perhaps to account for that personification, Milton includes in his Creation narrative a de- scription of the Earth's formation as an embryo hidden in the womb of waters: The Earth was form'd, but in the Womb as yet Of Waters, Embryon immature involv'd, Appear'd not: (7.276-78) And before Milton's sentence ends, the Earth conceives and is first named "the great Mother": over all the face of Earth Main Ocean flow'd, not idle, but with warm Prolific humor soft'ning all her Globe, Fermented the great Mother to conceive, Satiate with genial moisture.

Fallon, Milton among the Philosophers: Poetry and Materialism in Seventeenth- Century England (Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press, 1991), 125; for Fallon's definition of animist materialism, see p. 1LL (hereafter cited as Fallon). Fallon regards the animism of Milton's Creation account as a counter-statement to Cartesian mechanism and dual- ism. My suggestion is that the animism implicit in Milton's poetic argument consistently supports an ecological ethic.</page><page sequence="8">100 The Wounded Earth in Paradise Lost In this stunning passage, Milton has mingled the cosmic waters said to surround the biblical firmament with the waters of life surrounding human childbirth. This is definitely a case of a positive cosmic womb image in Paradise Lost, associated as Mary Adams suggests with the created world.9 In discussing Milton's Creation account, Barbara Kiefer Lewalski has recently demonstrated Milton's emulation of Lucretius's description of various flora and fauna springing to life from the earth in De rerum natura 2.992-95 and 5.781-924.10 Lewalski points out that, in comparison with the Lucretian version, Milton's portrayal of the Earth is more vigorous, sensuous, and graphic. Milton's particular, detailed use of Lucretius will be discussed in the next section. The point I wish to emphasize here is the consistency of Milton's personifications of the Earth, their mutually coherent and logical development throughout his epic. As part of the sequence of passages personifying the Earth in Para- dise Lost, this one at Creation marks several major conceptual advances over the others. The anthropomorphic Earth is obedient to God's cre- ative Word, but Milton's emphatic focus on her compliance-"The Earth obey'd"-at least raises the question of whether the Earth can will to disobey God. Certainly this focus on the Earth's obedience heightens our awareness of human obedience, a process which has been underway since Adam's question in Book Five: "What meant that caution joined, 'If ye be found / Obedient'?" (513-14). As a counter to the sterile digging into the Earth's womb by Mammon and men, this passage shows what the fertile Earth properly brings forth. Comple- menting her amazing fecundity (she "teem'd at a birth" with "Innu- merous living Creatures"), the Earth is productive in an orderly man- ner, with creatures produced according to their kinds, in perfect forms, yet without the dangers of human childbirth and maturation ("limb'd and full grown"). Milton sums up this positive phase of the productive Earth by depicting her as happily wearing the living creatures she has brought forth: "Earth in her rich attire / Consummate lovely smil'd" (7.501-2). 9 Mary Adams, "Fallen Wombs: The Origins of Death in Miltonic Sexuality,' MiltonS 29 (1992): 165-179, especially 169. 10 For discussions of Lucretian epic as a generic frame for Milton's Creation account, see Barbara Kiefer Lewalski, "Paradise Lost" and the Rhetoric of Literary Forms (Prince- ton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1985), 133-35; and an expanded version in "Generic Multiplicity and Milton's Literary God," A Fine Tuning: Studies of the Religious Poetry of Herbert and Milton, ed. Mary A. Maleski (Binghamton, NY: Medieval &amp; Renaissance Texts &amp; Studies, 1989), 176-78. Lewalski also notes, as does Hughes, the resemblance of Milton's creation account to Ovid's in Metamorphoses 1.1-51.</page><page sequence="9">Richard J. DuRocher 101 In the context of Milton's sequence of passages developing the per- sonified Earth, the personifications during the Fall depict the Earth as a consciously changed being. Because Milton depicts the Earth as a sen- tient, responsive being, her suffering at the Fall would seem to be no mere reflection or extension of a human problem. The Earth herself is damaged by human sin, and she is moreover well aware of that injury: "Earth felt the wound." Because the injuries to the Earth by mining depicted in Book One have been shown to be abuses of the Earth's cre- ative force, Adam and Eve's sin likewise seems to involve a violation of Mother Earth's creative power. Earth's response to Adam's fall -"Earth trembl'd from her entrails, as again / In pangs"-specifically character- izes the Earth's response to the Fall as a perverse, forced reenactment of her part in Creation. In stark contrast to an Earth obedient to God's word, Adam and Even choose to forget their calling to obedience. In the last frame of Milton's sequence of scenes describing the per- sonified Earth in Paradise Lost, we are shown conclusively that the Earth's sufferings are no mere reflection or intensification of the human situation. The Earth is physically afflicted by the dual shifts of irregular solar movement and tilted axes, as God physically effects the plagues of extreme seasons and temperatures: The Sun Had first his precept so to move, so shine, As might affect the Earth with cold and heat Scarce tolerable, and from the North to call Decrepit Winter, from the South to bring Solstitial summer's heat.... Some say he bid his Angels turn askance The Poles of Earth twice ten degrees and more From the Sun's Axle; they with labor push'd Oblique the Centric Globe. (10.651-71) The physical repositioning of astronomical bodies shows that the injury to the Earth is neither whimsical nor a case of human emotion projected upon physical nature. Milton is not indulging in the poetic expedient of ascribing human emotions to natural forces, what Ruskin termed the pathetic fallacy. Here the Earth's suffering is uniquely its own; it has no correlative or "ultimate source" in human suffering. The lack of witnesses who can corroborate the angels' agency in this cataclysmic change prompts the uncertain pronouns: "Some say." One thing is cer- tain, however. The Fall has irreversibly damaged the living Earth.</page><page sequence="10">102 The Wounded Earth in Paradise Lost III Milton, as we have seen, presents the Earth in Paradise Lost as a living being, not a mere reflection of humankind, who brings life to all terres- trial creatures and who is injured by the Fall. In short, Milton describes the Earth as a living organism. His great precursors in this belief were the Roman Stoics." As Edward Phillips, the poet's nephew writes, Milton was reading and teaching their works during the 1640s, when as Phillips also re- called, Milton began to compose what would eventually become Para- dise Lost: And here by the way, I judge it not impertinent to mention the many authors both of the Latin and Greek, which through his excellent judgment and way of teaching, far above the pedantry of common public schools (where such au- thors are scarce ever heard of), were run over within no greater compass of time, than from ten to fifteen or sixteen years of age. Of the Latin, the four grand authors De Re Rustica, Cato, Varro, Columella and Palladius; Cornelius Celsus, an ancient physician of the Romans; a great part of Pliny's Natural 11 For an overview of the Stoic view of the cosmos, see Merchant 23-24; Gerard Ver- beke, 'Ethics and Logic in Stoicism,' Atoms, Pneuma, and Tranquility: Epicurean and Stoic Themes in European Thought, ed. Margaret J. Osler (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1991), 11-15. Roman Stoicism, like most Roman institutions, had roots in Greece. For the roots of the Roman stoics' belief in a living Earth, see Plato's Timaeus 30.B, where the KWu0/O is said to be a living creature; and especially the Life of Zeno in Diogenes Laertius, Lives of the Eminent Philosophers 7.142, where it is described as an animate substance endowed with sensation. Scholars have explored seventeenth-century scientific and philosophic works both as transmitters of ancient notions and as proponents of fresh ideas that may have in- fluenced Milton. Fallon discusses several of Milton's contemporaries, chiefly Gassendi, who revived Stoic and Epicurean theories of matter. Kester Svendsen, who in Milton and Science (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1956) traces Milton's scientific thought through contemporary encyclopedias and handbooks of science, nonetheless concludes, 3: 'It is the old science, rather than the new, which bulks the larger in Milton, despite his spectacular allusions to Galileo and his interest in some elements of the new cosmology." Likewise, William Kerrigan elegantly asserts in The Sacred Complex: On the Psychogenesis of "Paradise Lost" (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1983), 195, that Milton's universe is "unmistakably terracentric; we look through the telescope of Galileo (the only contem- porary named in the epic) at the universe of Ptolemy." I question, however, Kerrigan's facile equating of the poet's "darkened mind" with the productive womb of "mother" Earth (185). In The Theory of the Earth (London, 1684), Thomas Burnet, basing his argu- ments on Scripture and deductive reasoning, argues that the Earth's surface, swamped by waters from below, became in his term "Terraqueous' as a result of the Flood. Bur- net's work appeared too late to influence Milton. However, as Basil Willey suggests in his introduction to The Sacred Theory of the Earth (Carbondale, IL: Southern Ifinois University Press, 1965), 5, Burnet's physico-scriptural approach may owe something to the poet.</page><page sequence="11">Richard J. DuRocher 103 History; Vitruvius his Architecture; Frontinus his Stratagems; with the two egre- gious poets, Lucretius and Manilius. (Hughes, 1029) Six of those Latin authors, all of whom Milton recommends in his tract Of Education, made distinct contributions to the view of the Earth in Paradise Lost. As I will show, they provided Milton not with sources to follow but with precedents to authorize his distinctive personifi- cations.'2 I shall discuss these authors in the order indicated by both Phillips' life and Milton's tract: beginning with the agricultural writer, Columella; continuing with the three natural historians, Seneca, Cicero, and Pliny; and concluding with the two epic poets, Lucretius and Vergil. In the Georgics 4.147-48, Virgil had challenged his poetic successors to complete what he had left undone: a versified description of the cul- tivation of gardens. Lucas Junius Columella (d. A.D. 70) takes up that challenge in the Tenth Book of his De re rustica. In depicting a complete growing season in the garden, Columella presents an extended personi- fication of the Earth as Mother or Step-mother of all plants (10.94-214). Columella's personification begins with the Earth adorned with vari- ous flowers in Spring (94-101), moves to the Earth impregnated amid Spring revelry (102-254), then culminates in the Earth giving birth to a variety of crops at harvest (255-432). Columella's poem clearly antici- pates Milton's representation of the Earth as nurturing Mother: Flagitat ecce suos genetrix mitissima fetus, Et quos enixa est partus iam quaerit alendos, Privignasque rogat proles. Date nunc sua matri Pignora, tempus adest; viridi redimite parentem Progenie, tu cinge comam, tu dissere crines. [Lo! gentlest mother, Earth demands her young And longs to nurse the offspring she has borne And her step-children. to the mother give- The time is come-the pledges of her love; With her green progeny the parent crown, Bedeck her hair, in order set her locks.] (De re rustica 1o.161-65)13 12 Citing George Puttenham and Francis Meres, Jonathan Bate describes the Renais- sance mode of using antiquity as a paradigm or precedent to authorize current poetic practice in his fine chapter, "The Art of Precedent," in Shakespeare and Ovid (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1993), 83-117. 13 Columella, De re rustica, trans.

Heffner (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1955; rev. ed., 1979).</page><page sequence="12">104 The Wounded Earth in Paradise Lost Columella's inventive playfulness with the basic notion of Earth as Mother anticipates Milton's poetic elaboration of that image. Columella writes that the Earth may have stepchildren as well as children, a witty stroke comparable to Milton's doubling of womb images (7.276, 7.454). Columella's wit elicited the longest of Baptistus Pius's comments on Columella's Garden poem, a comment found in annotated Renaissance collections of De re rustica. Essentially, the commentator explains, a stepmother Earth could account for transplanting.'4 As a relative latecomer to Stoic theory concerning the Earth, Colu- mella depended heavily in his Garden poem upon the work of Stoic philosophers and natural historians. In Book Two of De natura deo- rum, Cicero had adduced arguments from both Greek philosophy and physics to demonstrate that the earth is sentient, animate, and rational. The logical argument derives from Zeno: "Nullius sensu carentis pars aliqua potest esse sentiens; mundi autem partes sentientes sunt; non igitur caret sensu mundus." Pergit idem et urget an- gustius: "Nihil," inquit "quod animi quodque rationis est expers, id generare ex se potest animantem conpotemque rationis; mundus autem generat animantis compotesque rationis; animans est igitur mundus composque rationis.' ["Nothing devoid of sensation can have a part of itself that is sentient; but the world has parts that are sentient; therefore the world is not devoid of sensa- tion." He (Zeno) also proceeds to press the argument more closely: "Nothing," he says, "that is inanimate and irrational can give birth to an animate and ratio- nal being; but the world gives birth to aniimate and rational beings; therefore the world is animate and rational."] (2.7.22)15 14See, for example, the Paris, 1533 edition of Libri de re rustica published by lehan Petit, which contains Baptistus Pius's comment on De re rustica i0.161-62: Privignasque rogat. Solet ambigi quidem quid in eo versiculo velit Columella quod ut intelligas scito privignum eum vorari qui filius est eius de matris, sed non patris. victricus maritus meae matris, sed non genitor meus. Sunt enim relativa victricus &amp; privignus. Herbae quae transferentur in aliam terram, dicuntur illius Privignae: quoniam tranferuntur ex sinu materno in terram novercam vel secundum Aesopi sententiam locutus est, qui dixit terram ese matrem herbarum quae sponte nascerentur: novercam vero earum quae seminarentur. cum igitur haec serantur habent terram loco novercae. [She calls for her stepchildren. Generally it is uncertain what Columella is concealing in this short line. For you would think he would be called a stepson who is of the same mother but not of the same father. For a husband may wed my mother, but not be my father. To be sure, a stepfather and a stepson are related. Herbs which are transplanted into another soil are called these "stepchildren" (my translation).l 5Cicero, De Natura Deorum: Academica, trans. H. Rackham (London: Heinemann, 1933).</page><page sequence="13">Richard J. DuRocher Milton's personified Earth is certainly depicted as animate; in its sym- pathetic response to the Fall it might reasonably be seen as both sen- tient and rational. Cicero's argument from physics is consistent with Zeno's logic. From a Christian perspective, however, this argument raises an extreme difficulty with the notion of a rational principle in nature. The conclusion of such an argument is that the world is god: Principatum autem id dico quod Graeci #iVEMOVLKo6v vocant, quo nih in quoque genere nec potest nec debet esse praestantius; ita necesse est illud etiam in quo sit totius naturae principatus esse omnium optimum omniumque rerum potestate dominatuque dignissimum. Videmus autem in partibus mundi (nihil est enim in omni mundo quod non pars universi sit) inesse sensum atque ratio- nem. In ea parte igitur in qua mundi inest principatus haec inesse necesse est, et acriora quidem atque maiora. Quocirca sapientem esse mundum necesse est, naturamque eam quae res omnes conplexa teneat perfectione rationis excellere, eoque deum esse mundum omnemque vim mundi natura divina contineri. [I use the term 'ruling principle' as the equivalent of the Greek hegemonikon, meaning that part of anything which must and ought to have supremacy in a thing of that sort. Thus it follows that the element which contains the ruling principle of the whole of nature must also be the most excellent of all things and the most deserving of authority and sovereignty over all things. Now we observe that the parts of the world (and nothing exists in all the world which is not a part of the whole world) possess sensation and reason. Therefore it follows that that part which contains the ruling-principle of the world must necessarily possess sensations and reason, and these in a more intense and higher form. Hence it follows that the world possesses wisdom, and that the element which holds all things in its embrace is pre-eminently and perfectly rational, and therefore that the world is god, and all the forces of the world are held together by the divine nature.] (2.11.29-31) We shall take up the problem of the Earth's imputed divinity shortly, when dealing with Lucretius. For present purposes, Cicero adds to Stoic theory of the Earth two crucial notions: its rationality, and its hegemony over all of nature. The former we have found to be implicit in Milton's lines during the Fall. The latter is implicit in the syntax of Milton's personification: "Earth felt the Wound, and Nature from her seat / Sighing through all her Works gave signs of woe / that all was lost." Earth responds to the Fall first, then Nature in general follows. Moreover, while the Earth acts or at least reacts, Nature's response is to signify. It may be, as Alastair Fowler suggests, quoting Romans 8.22 ("For we know that the whole creation groaneth and travaileth in pain</page><page sequence="14">1o6 The Wounded Earth in Paradise Lost together until now"), that Nature is indicating all the woe that will hap- pen in the future.'6 Certainly Milton's verse is arranged so that whereas Earth reacts to the Fall, Nature announces that dire event. In the generation after Cicero and before Columella, that is, roughly contemporary with Jesus, Seneca developed Stoic thought about the Earth along anthropomorphic lines. In his Natural Questions, Seneca ar- gues that the Earth has veins and arteries, much like the human body: Placet natura regi terram, et quidem ad nostrorum corporum exemplar, in qui- bus et venae sunt et arteriae, illae sanguinis, hae spiritus receptacula. In terra quoque sunt alia itinera per quae aqua, alia per quae spiritus currit; adeoque ad similitudinem illa humanorum corporum natura formativit ut maiores quo- que nostri aquarum appellaverint venas. [The idea appeals to me that the earth is governed by nature and is much like the system of our own bodies in which there are both veins (receptacles for blood) and arteries (receptacles for air). In the earth also there are some routes through which water runs, some through which air passes. And nature fash- ioned these routes so like human bodies that our ancestors even called them Aveins" of water.] (3.15.1-2)17 Seneca's notion that the Earth's "veins" are like those of human bcodies may reduce to an ancient commonplace, as the nod to "our ancestors" suggests. Nonetheless, that basic comparison underlies Milton's depic- tion of the abusive digging into the Earth's "bowels" in Book One, as we have seen. Seneca's comparison seems to have inspired Milton in another way as well. In addressing the dispute over the cause of earthquakes, Seneca relies on the analogy of the Earth as human body. He endorses the theory that the Earth possesses the breath of life: Etiamnunc dicendum est quo plerisque auctoribus placet et in quod fortasse fiet discessio. Non esse terram sine spiritu palam est, non tantum illo dico quo se tenet ac partes suid iungit, qui inest etiam saxis mortuis que corporibus, sed illo dico vitali et vegeto et alente omnia. Hunc nisi haberet, quomodo tot arbustis spiritum infunderet non aliunde viventibus et tot satis? Quaemodum tam diversas radicas aliter atque aliter in se mersas foveret, quasdam summa receptas parte, quasdam altius tractas, nisi multum haberet animae tam multa tam varia generantis et haustu atque alimento sui educantis? 16 Alastair Fowler, ed., Paradise Lost (London: Longman, 197 H1). 17Seneca, Natural Questions, trans.

DuRocher 107 [And now I must state a theory which many authorities favour and which will perhaps be voted for without dissent. It is obvious that the earth is not without air. I speak not only of the air by which it holds itself together and joins the parts of itself, which exists also in rocks and dead bodies, but I also speak of that air which is vital and active, nourishing all things. Unless the earth has this, how does the earth infuse air into the many trees and plants which de- rive life from no other source? How does the earth nurture the many different roots plunged into herself in various ways, some penetrating only the upper part of the earth, others sunk deeper, unless the earth had an abundance of the breath which generates so many and such varied growth and nourishes them with food and drink?] (6.16.1-2) Seneca's rhetorical questions not only support the fundamental Mil- tonic notion that the Earth is a living being, endowed with the breath of life. They also provide a physical explanation of what Milton describes as happening during the Fall. The Earth can feel a wound and "sigh" at the Fall, for the same reason that the Earth can nurture all things, that is, because of the Earth's abundant "breath" or spirit. For Milton, the Earth's vital air or breath derives from divine inspiration during the act of creation. In De Doctrina Christiana Milton articulates his anti- Trinitarian view that the scriptural terms "Spirit of God" and "Holy Spirit" mean "particularly that divine breath or influence by which every thing is created and nourished.""8 Seneca's organic account of the Earth's breath is perfectly consistent with Milton's insistence on the Spirit's material basis. Completed in A.D. 77, Pliny's Natural History presents a view of the Earth which sums up many of the points gleaned thus far-the image of Earth as Mother, the detailed anatomical analogy between the Earth and the human body, the underlying sense that the Earth is a living, breathing being: Sequitur terra, cui uni rerum naturae partium eximia propter merita cogno- men indidimus maternae venerationis. sic hominum illa ut caelum dei, quae nos nascentes excipit, natos alit, semelque editos sustinet semper, novissime conplexa gremio iam a reliqua natura abdicatos tum maxime ut mater operians, nullo nagis sacra merito quam quo nos quoque sacros facit, etiam moni- menta ac titulos gerens nomenque prorogans nostrum et memoriam extendens contra brevitatem aevi, cuius numen ultimum iam nullis precamur irati grave, tamquam nesciamus hanc esse solam quae numquam irascatur homini. 18 The Complete Prose Works of John Milton, 8 vols., ed.

She belongs to men as the sky belongs to God: she receives us at birth, and gives us nurture after birth, and when once brought forth she upholds us always, and at the last when we have now been disinherited by the rest of nature she embraces us in her bosom and at that very time gives us her maternal shelter; sanctified by no service more than that whereby she makes us also sacred, even bearing our monuments and epitaphs and prolonging our name and extending our mem- ory against the shortness of time; whose divinity is the last which in anger we invoke to lie heavy on those who are now no more, as though we did not know that she is the only element that is never wroth with man.] (2.63.154-55).'9 The encyclopedic nature of Pliny's project explains the accretive style of this and many other sections of the Natural History. Pliny is far more concerned with inclusive coverage than with originality. Throughout Pliny's entry about the Earth, nonetheless, one feature stands out: the unique sympathy, figured as maternal care, on the part of the Earth toward humankind. Logically, then, Pliny bristles with moral outrage over humankind's abuse of the Earth. Expanding Seneca's notion of the Earth's veins, Pliny particularly directs his anger at mining practices which invade the Earth's "entrails": ut tamen quae summa patitur atque extrema cute tolerabilia videantur, pene- tramus in viscera auri argentique venas et aeris ac plumbi metalla fodientes, gemmas etiam et quosdam pervolos quareimus lapides scrobibus in profun- dum actis, viscara eius extrahimus, ut digito gestetur gemma petitur. quot manus atteruntur ut unus niteat articulus! [Yet in order to make the sufferings inflicted on her surface and mere outer skin seem endurable, we probe her entrails (viscera), digging into her veins of gold and silver and mines of copper and lead; we actually drive shafts down into the depth to search for gems and certain tiny stones; we drag out her entrails, we seek a jewel merely to be worn upon a finger! How many knuckles are worn away with toil that a single knuckle may shine resplendent!] (2.63.158) Here Pliny mocks the perverse action of scraping away Mother Earth's entrails, and in the process scraping away the diggers' knuckles, all in order to adorn another human knuckle. As we have seen, Milton shares Pliny's righteous indignation over humankind's perverse mis- 19 Pliny, Natural History, io vols., H. Rackham, trans.

DuRocher log treatment of the beneficent EarthY' Moreover, Milton's language that at the Fall "Earth trembled from her entrails" echoes this Plinian passage. Pliny's irony reappears in oxymoronic form in the Miltonic narrator's comment on gold as "precious bane": Let none admire That riches grow in Hell; that soil may best Deserve the precious bane. (1.690-92) For Milton, humanity's abuse of the Earth is not merely perverse but ultimately self-destructive. Whereas the devils conclude the Council in Pandaemonium peacefully, men, alone among rational creatures, Milton remarks: Yet live in hatred, enmity, and strife Among themselves, and levy cruel wars, Wasting the Earth, each other to destroy. (2.500-502) IV Because Lucretius and Virgil shaped personifications of the Earth in their epics, Milton's poetic representation of the Earth in Paradise Lost is, one expects, chiefly concerned to stand comparison with those epic precursors. While Milton's treatment of the Earth does indeed echo both Lucretius and Virgil, the manner of Milton's imitation is sharply corrective. Milton practices what Thomas Greene has termed "heuris- tic imitation." In this process, Greene writes, the later writer insists upon qualifying the truth value of the precursor text.21 Milton emulates his epic precursors' accounts of the Earth in order to show that his poem refutes their mistaken arguments and overgoes their relatively inconsequential concerns. 20 In Milton's Literary Milieu (Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 1939; rpt. New York: Russell &amp; Russell, 1964), 92-93, George W. Whiting lucidly discusses Milton's indebtedness to Pliny for these vivid accounts of humankind's perversity in torturing the Earth. Whiting's primary concern, as his title suggests, is to document the contem- porary (seventeenth-century) literary culture upon which Milton drew. Thus Whiting discusses Philemon Holland's monumental translation of Pliny, under the title A Historie of the World (London, i6oo), along with Sir Walter Ralegh's Historie of the World. 21 Thomas M.

That epithet means "outstanding" in modem English, but its literal, and punning meaning, "away from the herd," is also apt.22 As the chief Roman exponent of Epicurean philosophy, Lucretius (99- 55? B.C.) stands apart from the herd of Stoics with their assertion of a living, sacred Earth. In his didactic epic, De rerum natura, Lucretius aims to dispel all such superstitious views of the gods, which serve ulti- mately in his view to trouble and degrade humanity. As an antidote to "turpi religione," or base superstition.' Lucretius articulates his poetic rendition of the Epicurean theory of the atoms underlying all things. Those lessons in atomic physics are the tenor or signified behind all Lucretian images. At the same time, Lucretius the poet depends to a great extent on fables, including fables about the Earth. Such dependence amid denial occurs in his discussion of the Earth in Book Two, 589-643. Lucretius asserts repeatedly that the Earth de- serves its honorific titles as magna mater (Great Mother) and mater fera- rum (Mother of Wild Beasts): quare magma deum mater materque ferarum et nostri genetrix haec dicta est corporis una. [Wherefore she is called great Mother of the gods, and Mother of the wild beast, and maker of our bodies, even she alone.] (2.598-99) Further, Lucretius meticulously records the Phrygian rituals celebrat- ing Mother Earth, including the armed group known as Curetes who escort the Great Mother, and thus prevent the curse of ancient legend: ne Saturnus eum malis mandaret adeptus aeternumque daret matri sub pectore volnus. [that Saturn might not catch him (Jupiter) and plant an everlasting wound in the mother's heart.] (2.637-39) Finally, however, Lucretius denies that such legends have any basis in truth-the truth, that is, of atomic physics: Quae bene et eximie quamvis disposta ferantur, longe sunt tamen a vera ratione repulsa. omnis enim per se divom natura necessest 22 See the Hughes edition, p. 1029.

[But well and excellently as all this is set forth and told, yet it is rejected far from true reasoning. For the very nature of divinity must necessarily enjoy immortal life in the deepest peace, far removed and separated from our troubles; for without any pain, without danger, itself mighty by its own resources, needing us not at all, it is neither propitiated with services nor touched by wrath. Here if anyone decides to call the sea Neptune, and corn Ceres, and to misapply the name of Bacchus rather than to use the title that is proper to that liquor, let us grant him to dub the round world Mother of the Gods, while he forbears in reality himself to infect his mind with base superstition. The earth indeed lacks true sensation at all times, and only because it receives into itself the first beginnings of many things does it bring forth many in many ways into the sun's light.] (2.644-60) Essentially, as Bailey explains, Lucretius insists that the Earth is not only devoid of divinity but also of sense, for it is a collection of atoms working by their own laws.24 Now Milton's account of the Earth in Paradise Lost stands as a de- nial of Lucretius's denials. In short, Milton reasserts the personifica- tion and mythic legends of the Earth that Lucretius tried to dismiss. Contra Lucretius, Milton's poem vigorously asserts three major points. First, the Deity is concerned about and responsive to human troubles. 24 Titi Lucreti Cari, De Rerum Natura Libri Sex, 3 vols., edited with an English transla- tion and commentary by Cyril Bailey (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1947), 2:898-99. Curi- ously, when Lucretius returns in DRN 5.783-836 to consider the age of the world, he not only characterizes the primal Earth as a fecund Mother (in contrast with her puta- tive present sterility), but offers several arguments to prove that the Earth generates as a mother does. For a useful analysis of that passage, see David A. West, "Two Notes on Lucretius," ClassQ n.s. 14 (1964): 98-102.</page><page sequence="20">112 The Wounded Earth in Paradise Lost Milton's Dialogue in Heaven is one sign of that concern; God's response to Adam and Eve's prayers at the end of Book Ten is a sign of divine pro- pitiation. In De Doctrina Christiana 1.2, Milton argues that God's will- ingness to be represented anthropomorphically in Scripture is the best reason to conceive of God in human terms (CPW6:133). Second, "Earth felt the Wound" (my emphasis). That is, the Earth indeed possesses the true power to sense spiritual truth, and to respond accordingly. By dis- playing the physical alterations to the Earth later, in Book Ten, Milton suggests that what we see in Book Nine is no such change in physical position. In other words, at the Fall Milton's Earth registers both sym- pathy with human suffering and sentience of its own injury. Thus it possesses a double capacity for sensation, in opposition to Lucretius's philosophy. Third, "Earth felt the wound" (my emphasis). Some kind of eternal injury, echoing Lucretius's rejected "aeternum volnos" from the Phrygian legend, actually befell the Earth. Thus, the ancient legend, however exaggerated, embodied an essential though dimly seen Judeo- Christian truth. This process, whereby Scripture realizes pagan poetry and legend, is elsewhere evident in Paradise Lost, most notably whereby pagan accounts of a perfect paradise gesture toward the true Eden. For Milton, pagan myths "may foreshadow the final truth, but no more."' Not surprisingly, it is the mightiest of Latin poets whom Milton most closely imitates in his treatment of the Earth. Of all the precedents we have examined, Virgil's moving portrayal of the Earth in Book Four of the Aeneid has the greatest affinities with Milton's. The Earth appears at the pivotal moment when Aeneas and Dido have lost their fellows in the hunting party and together have reached the fatal cave: prima et Teilus et pronuba Iuno dant signum; fulsere ignes et conscius Aether conubiis, summoque ulularunt vertice Nymphae. ile dies primus leti primusque malorum causa fuit. [Primal Earth and nuptial Juno give the sign; fires flashed in Heaven, the witness to their bridal, and on the mountain-top screamed the Nymphs. That day was the first day of death, that first the cause of woe.] (4.166-7o)26 The Earth appears as a sentient, sacred force, at a moment which is, like Milton's, described as the beginning of tragedy. Commenting on "dant signum," Servius the Grammarian noted that Earth and Juno gave 25Cleanth Brooks and J. E. Hardy, Poems of Mr. John Milton with Essays in Analysis (New York: Harcourt, Brace, 1957), 229. 26 Virgil, Aeneid, trans. H. R. Fairclough (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1937).</page><page sequence="21">Richard J. DuRocher 113 the sign "ut dei nuptiales," that is, as the proper nuptial goddesses. 7 R. D. Williams maintains that the goddesses conspire to produce "a parody of a wedding, a hallucination by which the unhappy Dido is deceived."'2 The role of Virgil's Earth as a nuptial goddess points to marital discord and deception for Adam and Eve. It is perfectly fit- ting that Milton's Earth should be represented in the same manner as Virgil's "prima Tellus," that is, as the oldest of divinities celebrated by the pagans. All Milton's celebrations of the Earth as the original mother point that way. It is also perfectly appropriate that Milton should link the intimate drama of Adam and Eve's Fall with the woeful personal losses Dido and Aeneas suffer. In both cases the domestic crisis points to global discord. In contrast with Milton's refutation of Lucretius, however, Milton's emulation of Virgil takes the form of displacement. In his presenta- tion of the Earth at the Fall, Milton quietly asserts that a much greater event than the Roman poet described has occurred. Virgil had bril- liantly telescoped the international tragedy of Rome's wars with Car- thage into the "cause of woe" (causa malorum) stemming from Aeneas's affair with Dido. The signs of woe given by Milton's Earth and Nature, however, far exceed Virgil's, in two crucial ways. First, they signal, as Milton simply put it, "That All was lost." To begin with, "All" refers to the immortal, innocent life Adam and Eve had previously enjoyed in paradise. At the moment of their Fall, Adam and Eve become mortal creatures, as all their descendants will be mortal. In contrast, Virgil's orotund assertion that "ille dies primus leti" [that day was first the cause of death] makes sense only in a limited, rhetorical way. That day in the cave was indeed the beginning of Dido's, and by extension Carthage's, tragedy. On the other hand, the day of the Fall was literally "first the cause of death" entering the world. Though lamentable, the suffering Virgil foresees is parochial by comparison. Second, Milton's Earth signals a woeful shift in human possibility. Through the visions and dreams of the future in Books Eleven and Twelve, Milton demonstrates to Adam and Eve that their disobedi- ence is the cause of "all" human suffering to come, including world- wide warfare, universal flood, and all but unrelenting suffering for all humankind. Their descendants remain responsible for their actions, of course, but Adam and Eve's Fall, as the angel explains, brings with it 27Servii Grammatici (Servius Honoratus Marcus), Qui Feruntur in Vergillii Carmina Commentarii, 4 vols., eds. George Thilo and Herman Hagen (Leipzig: Teubner, 188i- 1884), 2.493- 28 R. D. Williams, ed., Virgil, Aeneid 1-6 (London: Macmillan, '1972), 346.</page><page sequence="22">114 The Wounded Earth in Paradise Lost a deterioration in free will and right reason along with mortality. In short, the humanity of their descendants is permanently damaged by Adam and Eve's choice. Overall, Milton's emulation of Virgil insists that forces beyond hu- man beings are affected by the Fall. It might be seen as to Virgil's ad- vantage that primal Earth and Juno actively signal a wedding, whereas Milton's Earth reacts in response to Eve's sin. Upon closer inspection, however, one sees that Milton's work again implies the greater sigmfi- cance. In the Aeneid, Earth and Juno conduct business as usual, for the elemental powers of nature and the gods are essentially unchanged by Dido's impending tragedy. On the contrary, Milton's description of a reactive, wounded Earth indicates that natural forces are themselves permanently damaged by the human Fall. The "Wound" the Earth feels upon Eve's Fall is at first unlocalized, but as the depiction of the Earth after Adam's Fall indicates, it is felt in the vital, creative part of Mother Earth, her womb: Earth trembl'd from her entrails, as again In pangs. In her anguished response to the Fall, the Earth shows the bitter con- sequences of the act. Specifically, human sin damages the creative capacity of our "all-bearing Mother." Despite Lucretius's denial, the ancient Earth remains alive in Milton's poem. Though wounded, she remains vital, if only to give evidence of sin's power to reverse creation. v In discussing the "drift towards allegory" which he saw in post- Virgilian poetry, C. S. Lewis adduced the "strange borderline position" that a notion such as "Nature" occupies in modem usage: "It is some- thing more than a personification and less than a myth, and ready to be either or both as the stress of argument demands."9 Unlike alle- gory, Lewis insists, such a figure does not point to some other frame of reference (history, psychology) for its meaning; it is already significant by itself. Milton's treatment of the Earth in Paradise Lost occupies such a bor- der zone. Out of the quasi-scientific and legendary accounts by Stoic writers, Milton crafted a story of the Earth that complements and ex- " C. S.

DuRocher 115 tends the significance of the biblical Fall story. Cast in the traditional figure of the Mother, the Earth both brings forth living creatures and sustains them by her continuing bounty. As a mother, the Earth fits perfectly well with the elemental forces of productivity celebrated by Columella and the natural historians. Just as Milton's angels are sur- prisingly material?0 so too is Milton's Earth. In her cosmic awareness and association with marriage, Milton's Earth resembles the goddess Tellus-whom Lucretius shouted down, and Virgil regarded as lur- ing Dido into a fatal union with Aeneas. Milton, however, rejects the Earth's role as the scheming goddess of epic machinery; his Earth is an organism expressly obedient to God's will. Whereas Stoic writers had explored the moral implications of a personified Earth, Milton above all insists that the ancient legends had embodied an essential element of Judeo-Christian truth. What Milton preserves of the Stoic Earth in Paradise Lost is her fecundity, her sentience, and above all her capacity to signal a tragedy at once human and cosmic. Thus, Milton's portrayal of the Earth enlarges the significance of Paradise Lost's "great argument." The personification emphasizes what Milton's epic overall adumbrates: the devastating effect of the Fall on all Creation. From its opening line, Milton's epic had announced this double emphasis on human and natural history. The first half of Milton's epic theme-"Of Man's first disobedience" followed the epic pattern of describing the significant deeds of a single human hero. The latter half of Milton's epic argument-"and the fruit of that forbidden tree"-with its punning inclusion of the results of eating the forbidden fruit, now clearly includes ecological consequences. Milton's focus on the wounded Earth at the pivotal moment of the human drama shows how closely interconnected is the health of human and natural bodies. Accordingly, the original human sin is mortal not only to our nature but also to the Earth's creative power. The Fall opens a wound in cre- ation that remains unhealed, and will remain so: till fire purge all things new, Both Heav'n and Earth, wherein the just shall dwell.
