<plain_text><page sequence="1">Handsomely illustrated, authoritatively written.... English Naive Painting By JAMES AYRES, with a Preface by ANDRAS KALMAN. Whether they are called "naive," "primitive" "folk" or "vernacular," the author's painstaking research proves conclusively that these pictures do indeed belong to a distant tradition of painting. This handsome book, the first to deal with the English naive tradition from the 18th century to the dawn of the 20th, is illustrated with many of these marvelous pictures marked by pungent color and powerful form. 151 illustrations, 48 in color. $29.95 A Fable of Modern Art By DORE ASHTON. Dore Ashton's masterly analysis of modern art revolves around a number of themes, the most significant and persistent of which is provided by a little-known "philosophic" story by Balzac, The Un- known Masterpiece. Professor Ashton develops her graceful critical essay by examining the curious interre- lations of literature, music, and art. The result is a book of extreme originality which ranges so widely and of- fers such surprising insights that it forms an important contribution not only to the history of art and culture, but also the history of ideas. 48 illustrations. $17.95 What is a Masterpiece? By KENNETH CLARK. It is a cliche of modern criticism that masterpieces do not exist, that it is all a matter of fashion, social relevance, or personal taste. Lord Clark is not tempted by this cliche. Returning to some of the challenging issues that he treated in Civilization, he here points out artistic achievements that he believes to be real, permanent, and endlessly rewarding. 39 illustrations. $10.95 John Flaxman Edited by DAVID BINDMAN.
