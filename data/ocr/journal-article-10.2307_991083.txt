<plain_text><page sequence="1">Guarino Guarini's Invention of the Passion Capitals in the Chapel of the Holy Shroud, Turin JOHN BELDON SCOTT, University ofIowa M ost studies of Guarino Guarini's Chapel of the Holy Shroud in Turin (1657-94) have focused either on the circular plan, with its superimposed triangle, or on the unusual composition of the dome, with its structure of six nested, arched hexagons rising from a drum supported on three huge, tilted arches [Figures 1-3]. The plan constitutes an elegant resolution of preexisting problems Guarini encountered when he became the project's architect in 1667, ten years after the beginning of construction. Guarini fit his new design into the built masonry shell and its marble facing, which was already in place up to the level of the large cornice of the major-order pilasters [Figure 4], stacking on it, vertiginously, tier after tier with scarcely precedented engineering bravura and forming the openwork dome that has been the object of both marvel and indignation for three centuries. There has been little agreement among historians about the extent to which meaning can be imputed to the extraordinary geometry seen in the plan, structure, and black marble facing of the chapel. Some scholars have held that Guarini, motivated by radical and complex philosophical, astrological, alchemical, and even cabalistic speculations, incorporated into his build- ings, especially the Shroud Chapel, forms and meanings unique in Western architecture.2 A less extreme position, held by Rudolf Wittkower, emphasizes a traditional Trinitarian mean- ing in the consistent geometrical triadism of the building.3 Today, however, many scholars seem to concur with Giulio Carlo Argan, who stands on the other side of interpretive possibilities, reductively asserting that "no one more than Guarini has affirmed the non-symbolic, non-allegorical, non- metaphorical-on the contrary-strictly phenomenal, objec- tive or 'thing-in-itself character of architectural form."4 In his recent monograph on Guarini, H. A. Meek, for example, presents a Guarini little interested in symbolic content.5 These extremes of interpretation ignore the contextual requirements of patronage and decorum to which every seventeenth-century architect needed to be attentive. By focusing on Guarini's use of the classical orders, it may be possible to isolate his attitude toward content and meaning in architectural ornament. Analysis of Guarini's treatment of the orders will show his invention in the manipulation of classical forms for ideological content.6 This we can see especially well in the Shroud Chapel in the gilt-bronze, modified Corinthian capitals the architect employed for the eight major-order fluted pilasters and two freestanding columns around the perimeter of the chapel rotunda [Figures 4-5]. The design of these capitals, as often noted, comprises instruments of Christ's Passion. They penetrate the sepulchral gloom of the chapel, forming a prickly chiaroscuro pattern when occasionally struck by a ray of sunlight piercing the faceted dome high above [Figure 6].7 The transcendental effect of the capitals against the tenebrous setting must have been even more persuasive before the gilding became dull with age and dust. The choice of materials for the chapel, black marble and bronze, was made decades before Guarini's arrival on the scene.

Ducal patronage and the funereal dedica- tion of the chapel made the Corinthian capital appropriate, with its richness and necrological associations.9 To appreciate Guarini's ingenuity, we might first examine a conventional Corinthian capital, which is easy enough to do as one stands in the chapel, for the minor-order capitals in the same rotunda, designed by Guarini's predecessor for the project, Bernardino Quadri, are thoroughly orthodox [Figure 7].10 Acanthus leaves grow in three tiers from the inverted bell-shaped body of the capital, with spiral-form caulicoli emerging at the top. Uniting these shoots is the lip of the bell. At the top, in the center of the concave abacus, the flower or fleuron blossoms forth, representing the acanthus bud with a fishtail-like stigma (the botanical term for the pollen-receiving part of the flower's stamen) growing from its center. Guarini's Passion capital, as seen in a close-up detail taken from a scaffold, deviates considerably from the traditional type. He reduces the treatment of the foliage to two tiers and uses a plant form closer to olive than to acanthus [Figure 5].11 This modification makes room for the crown of thorns inserted between the helices. Three nails protrude from the fleuron above the center of the crown and, at the top, the titulus or inscription from the cross appears with the initials for IESUS NAZARENUS REXIUDAEORUM. Guarini's decision to modify the major-order Corinthian avoided the repetition of the same capital type in close proximity to the minor order below; but, as we shall see, the architect's design had behind it a weightier conviction than merely the desire for variety.12 INNOVATION IN THE DESIGN OF THE CLASSICAL ORDERS Most scholars have tacitly assumed Guarini's authorship of the Passion capitals, perhaps because of their fantasy of invention. His intervention in their design, however, has never been documented and, given that many of the chapel's capitals predate his involvement with the project, there is somejustifica- FIGURE 2: Section, Chapel of the Holy Shroud, 1657-94 tion for questioning it. Precisely because of his late assumption of design responsibility for the chapel, Guarini's role in the creation of the Passion capitals has recently even been denied.13 The production history of these variants of the Corinthian capital is complicated, and it will be important to establish Guarini's part in their design and creation. A chronological analysis of payments for all the chapel's capitals will help resolve this vexing issue. The appendix contains a narrative summary of the documentation, which demonstrates that the manufac- ture of four of the ten Passion capitals dates from the period Guarini was in charge of the design. Two of these are identified specifically as the capitals of the freestanding fluted columns of the transitional zone between chapel and cathedral [Figures 8-9]. Since eight major-order pilasters with Passion capitals articu- SCOTT: GUARINI'S PASSION CAPITALS 419</page><page sequence="3">FIGURE 3: View of pendentive zone, drum, and dome, Chapel of the Holy Shroud late the rotunda wall, two of these also (in addition to the two documented column capitals) must already have been mounted in place before the final campaign for the completion of all the capitals, which occurred after Guarini's death.'4 These, for want of Guarini's drawings or a full-scale preexisting wooden model, must have served as prototypes for the bronze founders who manufactured the remaining six, as sug- gested in an instruction issued in May 1688.15 The written record gives no certain indication about which two of the eight pilaster capitals were the ones completed under Guarini's supervision, but practical construction procedure would suggest they were the two conveniently adjacent to the columns. The documentary evidence therefore makes it virtually certain that all ten of the Passion capitals are products of Guarini's thinking, even though only four were executed in his lifetime. If we combine this knowledge with the generous number of imaginative capital variants Guarini illustrates in his treatise, Architettura civile [Figures 10-13], there can be little doubt about his authorship of the Passion capitals. Like most architect-treatise writers who preceded him, Guarini devoted a major portion of his theoretical discussion in the Architettura civile to the design and application of the classical orders.16 Unlike some of his Italian predecessors, however, Guarini seems to have been more interested in offering creative variants to the standard orders, particularly in the design of capitals, than in repeating definitive versions of the traditional types.17 Perhaps his most original proposal is for a spiral-form Solomonic order, in which not only the columns but almost all other components, including the entablature, undulate on both the vertical and horizontal planes [Figure 10].18 He provides three capitals each for the Doric, Ionic, and Corinthian-each also with three distinctive proportional sys- tems-and four variants for the Composite. The reader may easily infer from Guarini's text and illustrations that the num- ber of permutations need be limited only by the creative imagination of the designer.19 In addition to the twelve differ- ent capitals illustrated for the orders, many of them based on unusual plant or floral motifs [Figure 11], Guarini presents still other capitals for the reader's consideration [Figure 12].20 Among these we find fruit baskets, phoenixes, cornucopias, 420 JSAH / 54:4, DECEMBER 1995</page><page sequence="4">crowns, angels, feathers, and other elements implying symbolic meaning. In some instances Guarini explicates the significance of the imagery, as in the case of the capital with the stacked crowns [Figure 12, number 33], which he tells us he invented for a chapel dedicated to Louis IX of France.21 Here the pointed bands of the crowns substitute for the curling acanthus leaves. Since Louis was both king and saint, he merited two crowns. The Passion capitals in the Shroud Chapel derive from this regard for decorum and design logic combined with creative license. Sensitive to the visual effect of his new capitals, Guarini did not merely add the relics to the standard Corinthian com- ponents. Instead, he incorporated them harmoniously into the canonical parts of the capital-the titulus echoing the concavity of the abacus, the nails becoming the styles and stigmas of the fleuron, and the crown of thorns replacing the lip of the bell. Guarini created a variation on the standard capital type without violating the classical syntax of the composition.22 The positioning of the crown with its rich, coloristic effect transforms the capital into a quasi-Composite. When the Ionic volutes and echinus molding enriched with egg-and-dart com- FIGURE 4: View of rotunda with major-order fluted pilasters and portal to palace, Chapel of the Holy Shroud bine with the Corinthian abacus and acanthus, the Composite capital results, the most elaborate of all the orders, as seen, for example, on Bernini's Baldacchino in Saint Peter's [Figure 14]. Conceptually we should imagine the echinus, a crucial compo- nent of the Ionic, continuing around behind the volutes and thus forming a crown-like cushion or ring, which must be the generating source for Guarini's idea of inserting the crown of thorns in this position between the spiral tendrils of his capital.23 We do not see the entire crown but only its forward edge as it merges with the compositional structure of the capital. The sculptural effect of the thorns imitates the carved egg-and-dart molding it replaces. Guarini's reasoning, however, goes beyond the visual and FIGURE 5: Passion capital, gilt bronze, Chapel of the Holy Shroud FIGURE 6: Passion capital, Chapel of the Holy Shroud SCOTT: GUARINI'S PASSION CAPITALS 421</page><page sequence="5">formal elements. The placement of the crown of thorns fits logically with Vitruvius's anthropomorphic interpretation of the orders, with the capital representing the head (caput/capo) of a human figure.24 Furthermore, we see here a reprise of the inventive thinking behind the crown capitals for the chapel of Saint Louis. Guarini created a decorous variation on the traditional capital type without violating the compositional logic of its constituent parts. Like the Passion capitals, the capital variants illustrated in the Architettura civile are usually meaningful rather than arbi- trary.25 Guarini offers, for example, number 21 [Figure 11], where large irises substitute for acanthus. The broad, plastic leaves create a sculptural effect with a strong light-dark con- trast. This type is useful, Guarini says, when the capital can be observed only at great remove, like those on the second register of the facade of Santa Maria Annunziata in Messina and on the exterior drum of the Shroud Chapel [Figures 15-16].26 Under these conditions details of delicate carving would be lost and ineffective. Here the architect appears at first to give primacy to visual apperception. Guarini justifies his unorthodox application of the iris, which he calls the "blue lily," with reference to a competition for the invention of a uniquely French order initiated by Louis XIV's minister, Colbert.27 We can see the ultimate results of this endeavor in the symbol-laden pilaster capitals in the Hall of Mirrors at Versailles, where fleurs-de-lis sprout amid palms, Gallic roosters peer out between the caulicoli, laurel and lightning bolts form the bell of the capital, and the head of the Apollonian sun deity substitutes for the fleuron [Figure 17].28 FIGURE 7: Bernardino Quadri, minor-order Corinthian capital, gilt bronze, Chapel of the Holy Shroud But, if irises had any other meaning for Guarini, he made no mention of it in the text, and no one standing at ground level could be expected to identify the exact botanical forms on capitals at such high locations. Like the French minister's enterprise, which was more political than aesthetic, Guarini's FIGURE 8: Fluted column with Passion capital, viewed from cathedral choir, 1669-71 422 JSAH / 54:4, DECEMBER 1995</page><page sequence="6">FIGURE 9: Passion capital of fluted column, viewed from cathedral choir use of the iris cannot, however, have been without meaning, for the iris is a flower laden with Christian significance. Because of its commonplace association with both the Annunciation and the Passion, a seventeenth-century reader of Guarini's treatise would hardly have overlooked the architect's fitting choice of the flower for buildings dedicated to the Annunciation and to a major Passion relic.29 In his treatise Guarini may have empha- sized the optical virtues of the iris-form capital, but he was perhaps also sensitive to the symbolism and associative values of the imagery with which he worked, even when he did not explain the obvious. The overtly thematic category of capital variant employed by Guarini thus carries a comment on the function or dedica- tion of the building it adorns. We have already noted the special capitals with crowns Guarini created for his chapel dedicated to Saint Louis, although, in that case, too, he did not elaborate on his iconographic or architectural reasons for employing the crowns. Again in the Architettura civile, Guarini tells us that he invented a new type of Ionic capital for the lower register of the fa;ade for Santa Maria Annunziata in Messina [Figure 13, number 24], the church of his own Theatine congregation.30 The architect strung a necklace ofjewels between the eyes of the volutes, while pendant earrings and a ribbon hang beneath the spirals. Here Guarini did not avoid the punning superimposi- tion of the necklace over that part of the capital termed the collarino. This capital appears in the lower register of the facade as engraved in the treatise.31 In this case Guarini simply adorns FIGURE 10: Guarino Guarini, Corinthian columns, engraving, from Architettura civile (1737), treat. 3, pi. 4 the capital, leaving almost untouched the basic elements of the traditional type. This innovation is unapologetically gender based. Guarini says that the dedication of this church is to the Virgin and, since women are in the habit of adorning themselves withjewelry, the modified capital thus makes a suitable allusion to the dedica- tee.32 This usage would come under the heading of the rule of decorum as it was understood in the period-the application of imagery appropriate to the nature and status of the context into which it was to be placed. Vitruvius associated the Ionic order with his notion of female characteristics, stating that the proportions were like those of a fair maiden and the volutes like the curls of her hair.33 Guarini thus elaborated, wittily, on this venerable anthropomorphic interpretation as he loaded his design with meaning. We see here a Guarini who remains distant from the dark speculations imputed to him by some SCOTT: GUARINI'S PASSION CAPITALS 423</page><page sequence="7">writers. Instead we find a free-spirited designer who works well within the traditional meanings of the Christian imagery and architectural culture of his time. THE PASSION CAPITALS AND THEIR MEANING To appreciate the motivation behind Guarini's creation of the Passion capital, with its obtrusive display of the instruments of Christ's suffering, we must consider the object the chapel was intended to house. Antonio Bertola's Berninesque altar- reliquary (1685-1693), designed after Guarini's death, con- tains the celebrated relic [Figure 18].34 Casual visitors to the chapel could not see the Shroud itself. It belonged to the ruling house of Savoy and the dukes exhibited it only occasionally and even then forjust a few minutes, usually to solemnize important dynastic events such as baptisms and marriages.35 At all other times the object remained rolled up in its reliquary box [Figure 19] and locked behind the gilded iron grating seen in the rectangular mid-section of the altar superstructure. Details of the relic itself are important for our understanding of Guarini's capitals. The dimensions of the Shroud (4.36 by 1.10 meters) are extraordinary. When unfurled, it displays two faint, sepia-toned figures placed head to head, one frontal and one dorsal [Figure 20]. The sixteenth and seventeenth centuries gave issue to a vast literature on the Shroud of Turin.36 These works run the range from substantial scholarly studies exhibiting enormous erudi- tion to small practical manuals intended as guides in private devotion, but almost all focus particular attention on the details of the images.37 There could be no mistake that this was the true Shroud of Christ, as the treatise writers explain, because one could verify with one's own eyes the marks of his suffering on it.38 Thus we see the blood from the wounds made by the crown of thorns, the spear thrust, and the nails. Even the forearms display coagulated streams, the blood that dripped down the suspended arms as Christ hung on the cross. To emphasize the importance of these details, during the feast- day ritual of public exhibition of the relic-an elaborate court ceremony attended by the ruling family-the duke and the hereditary prince kissed the major wound marks as the Shroud lay extended on a specially prepared table near the altar.39 The court poet of Carlo Emanuele I, Giambattista Marino, sang of this heavenly gift to the house of Savoy and of the five major wounds impressed upon it, noting that Christ himself painted this image with nails as brushes and his own blood as pigment.40 Outside Piedmont, traditional pictorial enumerations of the instruments of the Passion rarely included the Shroud.41 But, since the marks of the other instruments could be read on the image on the cloth, promoters of the Savoy Shroud advocated the relic notjust as one among many but as a compendium of the major sacred objects by which Christ suffered.42 / g~~~ ~~~ I -- -I I 7 .L._ =_ FIGURE I I: Corinthian capitals, engraving, from Architettura civile (1737), treat. 3, pi. 5 FIGURE 12: Corinthian capital variants, engraving, from Architettura civile, detail (1737), treat. 3, pl. II 424 JSAH / 54:4, DECEMBER 1995 I</page><page sequence="8">FIGURE 13: Ionic capital variants, engraving, Architettura civile (1737), treat. 3, pi. 3, detail In the chapel this same imagery dominates, as with the gilded angels holding the instruments (cross, spear, column, sponge) at the comers of the reliquary housing.43 If early prints of the altar are reliable in their detail, the cherubim on the encircling balustrade, too, once held various instruments.44 The reliquary box itself has relief medallions with the same objects (see Figure 20).45 More readily visible is the carved pattern on the fascias of the tilted arches at pendentive level above the rotunda [Figure 21], where every other rib motif consists of two nails placed point to point against a central boss. Guarini's earliest idea for the chapel appears in an engraved section first published in 1682, reflecting the opened half of the large wooden model of 1667 [Figures 22-23].46 This design was subsequently modified, but in the engraving we can discern in the spandrels flanking the oval dome windows small represen- tations of the instruments of the Passion. Nails and dice, for example, appear next to the openings of the first tier. Heart- FIGURE 14: Gianlorenzo Bernini, Composite capital, Baldacchino, Saint Peter's, Rome, 1624-1633. FIGURE 15: Guarino Guarini, iris-petal Corinthian capitals of exterior drum, Chapel of the Holy Shroud, c. 1680 shaped ornaments and seraphim occupy the spaces beneath the windows, just as angels and the wounded heart of Christ often appear accompanying depictions of the instruments in devotional images, as in imaginative creations of Christ's coat of arms. This we see, for example, in a mid-sixteenth-century woodcut [Figure 24]. The print demonstratesjust how common and widespread was the notion of the Passion instruments as components of Christ's imaginary heraldry. The German artist has even placed the crown of thorns in the position of a crown above a royal shield, with the titulus above, anticipating Guari- ni's Passion capital. In the completed chapel the redesigned windows eliminated the spandrel fields and their imagery, but, in the triangular spaces beneath each window, instead of hearts and angels, Guarini added inverted pentagons-quite illogically, given the shape of the space [Figure 25]. If this obtrusive geometrical element has any significance, it would be as a traditional reference to Christ, as seen, for example, in an early seventeenth- SCOTF: GUARINI'S PASSION CAPITALS 425</page><page sequence="9">Revelation (1:8): "I am Alpha and Omega."49 The Theatine preacher, Eugenio Quarant'otto, quoting Valeriano, intro- duced the concept into the Shroud literature in 1624 with the publication of his sermons, calling the pentalpha "hieroglyph" and "knot" of the "Christ of the Passion, and of the five wounds....The Holy Shroud is therefore the standard on which the salubrious pentalpha is stamped in characters of blood...."50 Thus the pentagons of the chapel dome are germane to the Passion iconography of the instruments origi- nally planned for those same spaces. A geometric form alluding to the wounds replaced depictions of the objects that caused those same marks. Rather than repeating in the dome the sculpted nails of the arch fascias of the pendentive zone, Guarini more visibly and succinctly represented their traumatic consequences. Such ornamental abstractions need not carry precise mean- ing, but the pentagon is an awkward configuration for architec- ture, and, given the original programmatic context here, a neutral reading of such an obtrusive motif may not be justifi- able.51 In the completed project the suppressed Passion imag- ery of the original dome reemerged not only in emblematic form inside the cupola but also in literal form at the pinnacle of the external spire, where nails, crown of thorns, and cross with FIGURE 16: Chapel of the Holy Shroud, drum and dome century drawing for an incised and inscribed meditational plaque explicating the eucharistic significance of the name of Jesus [Figure 26]. Guarini's five-sided figure surely refers to the Devotion of the Five Sacred Wounds of Christ, a cult practiced in the veneration of the Shroud. The geometry itself is explained as a sacred emblem by G. P. Valeriano in the 1602 edition of his Hieroglyphica, where the inverted pentagon forms the matrix of five connected alphas (forming a five-pointed star called a pentalpha or pentagonum) inscribed with the Greek letters for salus or health [Figure 27; part A].47 The relation to spiritual well-being and the five wounds becomes clear in Valeriano's superimposition of the geometric form over the figure of a Christus patiens exhibiting the marks of the crucifixion [Figure 2 7; part B], which demonstrates why the apex of the pentagon is inverted.48 Although such symbolism may seem obscure, Valeriano's discussion of the pentalpha had wide currency in the seven- teenth century, especially among theologians and preachers. It appears, for example, in the published Bible commentaries of the Jesuit Cornelius a Lapide (1567-1637) in his gloss on FIGURE 17: Charles Lebrun, "French order" capital, Hall of Mirrors, Versailles, 1678 426 JSAH / 54:4, DECEMBER 1995</page><page sequence="10">FIGURE 18: Antonio Bertola, reliquary altar, Chapel of the Holy Shroud, 1685-93 the Savoy arms surmount a wrought-iron orbis terrarum [Figure 28].52 The liturgy of the Holy Shroud would have reinforced this lugubrious imagery: Let us honor in your name, Christ, your standard the victorious cross, your thorny crown, your holy shroud, your bloody red nails, and the lance thrust into your sacred side.53 We must understand the innovative design for the Shroud Chapel capitals in this context of well-established devotional imagery at Turin. Guarini may have taken more direct inspiration in his use of the instruments of the Passion from temporary installations made in the cathedral for the annual feast of the Holy Shroud, celebrated on 4 May throughout Savoy and Piedmont. For the feast day in 1670, for example, a special display model of the Crucifixion was placed in a chapel near the Shroud, which, at that time was kept in a reliquary-ciborium above the main altar.54 In addition to figures standing at the foot of the cross, FIGURE 19: Reliquary of the Holy Shroud, c. 1604, silver, precious stones, and relief plaques, 1.23 x .30 x .22 m.

I x 4.4 m the installation incorporated arabesques with crowns of thorns and placards with scourges, pliers, nails, and various other instruments.55 In one detail of the Passion capital Guarini's imagination was especially active-the bizarre fleuron with the nails [Figure 29]. Guarini was by no means the first to experiment with the floral component of the Corinthian and Composite capitals, as we can see in a capital Guarini would have known well from his years of study in Rome (1637-47). The sun fleuron on the FIGURE 21: Guarino Guarini, detail of arch fascia with sculpted nails, Chapel of the Holy Shroud capitals of Bernini's Baldacchino at Saint Peter's, where the petals become rays of the papal patron's family solar impresa [Figure 14], drew from a venerable tradition of manipulating the constituent parts of the orders for purposes of conveying meaning.56 Guarini must also have noticed a replacement SCENOGRAPHIA SD I S * REGLI SACRATISSIMIE SINDONI DIC- ATk' .

Lat. 9910, I r flowering vine-the passion vine, genus Passiflora, of which there are more than 400 species [Figure 31].58 Tradition holds that the delicate corona of this blossom represents the crown of thorns placed on Christ's head and the spreading styles and stigmas, at the top, the nails which held him to the cross.59 The passion vine is indigenous to the Western Hemisphere, and horticulturists identify the species here, Passiflora caerulea, which is especially common in Brazil, as the one introduced into Europe in the seventeenth century and the one associated with the passionflower legend.60 The earliest known mention of the passion vine and its fruit, the granadilla, is in Cieza de Leon's chronicle of Peru, published in 1553.61 The first refer- ence to the vine's blossom that recognizes the instruments of the Passion in its parts is in Nicolas Monardes's 1569 treatise on medicinal plants of the New World, where the author recom- mends the fruit as a stomach remedy, and observes that the flower has "figures which are things of the Passion of our lord... .62 Samuel Purchas's world geography of 1613 states, not without some circumspection, that it "hath in it the markes of the Passion, and that therein they [the missionaries who first identified it] note the nailes, pillar, whips, and crowne of thornes, and the wounds, wherein they are not altogether without reason, and yet to find out and observe these things, it requires some pietie to cause beleefe: but it is very exquisite and faire to the eye... ."63 The earliest indication of knowledge of the passionflower at Turin occurs in verses penned by Carlo Emanuele I's court 430 JSAH / 54:4, DECEMBER 1995</page><page sequence="14">political theorist and ducal tutor, the Jesuit Giovanni Botero, composed in 1607.64 The poem, dedicated to the duke, catalogues the instruments embodied in the flower of the granadilla-among them, the "sharp nails."65 If Guarini ever saw a living passionflower, he made no mention of it. We do, however, have record of one growing in Cardinal Odoardo Farnese's garden on the Palatine Hill in Rome in 1625, and this garden still flourished in the 1640s when Guarini was a novice at the local Theatine house.66Already by the 1630s the renowned Jesuit floriculturist, Giovanni Battista Ferrari, declared the passionflower commonplace, since it had been seen by "everyone" in Rome.67 The numerous references to botanicalworks in Guarini's discussion of architec- tural ornament, particularly in his treatment of floral motifs for capital variants, make it clear that he paid attention to such things.68 In any case, as reported the prefect of Cardinal Farnese's garden, Pietro Castelli, this flower was as famous as it was rare. The maracot, as he calls it, is "... the famous plant A B FIGURE 27: (A) Piero Valeriano, pentalpha, Hieroglyphica (Lyon, 1602); (B) Christo- logical pentalpha FIGURE 28: Guarino Guarini, finial with instruments of the Passion, wrought iron, 1682-83, Chapel of the Holy Shroud SCOTU: GUARINI'S PASSION CAPITALS 431</page><page sequence="15">FIGURE 29: Detail of Passion capital sung by poets and celebrated by orators, the plant reasoned about by philosophers with the utmost subtlety, praised by physicians for its marvelous virtues, sought for eagerly by the sick, wondered at by theologians, and venerated by all pious Christians."69 Interest in the passionflower was, however, not generated by its status as a botanical rarity alone. Already in 1609 Paul V had been presented with a specimen, as reports the Olivetan monk Antonio Canali, who produced a theological encomium in praise of the passionflower in that same year.70 Comparing the parts of the actual flower with Guarini's fleuron, however, we observe that most of the details do not appear. An exact reproduction perhaps could not be expected, since all the morphological intricacies would have been difficult to render in bronze and, moreover, would have been wasted on the observer standing in the dark chapel below. Instead, the architect chose to represent only the petals and the nail-like stigmas, with the difference that the latter project markedly from the center of the flower, whereas the stigmas of almost all Passiflora species spread and lie flat at the top, as in the example illustrated [Figure 31]. As we shall discover, this salient feature of Guarini's fleuron, the projection of the nails, has amplejustifica- tion. Guarini may not have seen a passionflower, but he probably had seen one of the earliest published illustrations of the plant. It appeared not in a botanical study, but in a religious tract on the nature of the true cross, authored and published by Giacomo Bosio in Rome in 1610 [Figure 32].71 Bosio's ex- tended discussion of the flower is the most exhaustive printed version of the passionflower legend with a gloss on its theologi- cal significance. He states that he has not seen the flower himself and finds it so fantastic that he would be unable to credit its reality were it not that many reliable people, i.e., missionaries from Mexico, with whom he had spoken and who supplied him with drawings, reported on the veracity of its existence. Precisely because of its inaccuracies, early Protestant bota- nists condemned Bosio's illustration of the passionflower as a Jesuitical lie invented by the devil. In his 1629 treatise on floriculture, the Englishman John Parkinson accused Bosio of distorting the features of the flower to make them look more like the instruments of the Passion.72 Bosio's version of the passionflower, according to Parkinson (who prefers to call it the Virginia climber), was the work of "superstitious brains" and about as plausible as that the sea should bur. What is important to note is that unlike the passionflower, but like Bosio's rendering of it, Guarini's fleuron has the three nail-like stigmas markedly projecting out from the flower rather than lying flat, as in nature. However exact their knowledge of the living plant may have been, both Bosio and Guarini chose to depict the exotic bloom in its moralized form, so as to empha- size the theological meaning. If Guarini happened to know Bosio's woodcut, we might suppose he paused to read the author's exegetical comment on its significance. The author states that Spaniards refer to the blossom as the "Flower of the Five Wounds," alluding to the five major wounds of Christ, the ones made by the nails and by the spear of Longinus (which is represented by the pointed leaves of the vine).73 The wounds themselves appear in the five anthers, which the print represents as five dots around the base of the inner part of the flower.74 Bosio elaborates a Christian moralized meaning of the passionflower, seeing it as a sign placed by God in the New World to enlighten, at his chosen 432 JSAH / 54:4, DECEMBER 1995</page><page sequence="16">to visualize mentally a series of images appropriate to the stimulation of pious feelings, with the aim of achieving the plane of contemplation and other spiritual benefits.75 In this practice the imagery operates as a mnemonic device to aid the worshiper. As Giovanni Pozzi has noted, this explains why devotional representations of the passionflower do not correspond more precisely with the actual bloom.76 The distor- tions indicate a moralized interpretation of the flower and, in that sense, are truly jesuitical lies. The arma Christi iconography widely diffused through print media [Figure 24] and devo- tional practices focusing on concrete images such as the Five Wounds exemplify this phenomenon. Guarini's idio- syncratic passionflower, too, fits securely into the tradition. Christian meaning takes precedence over botanical exac- titude. Whether or not Guarini took notice of Bosio's gloss, his architectural reference to the passionflower need not have depended on a single text or image.77 Moreover, he cannot have overlooked the obvious analogy between passionflower FIGURE 30: Capital with bee fleuron, Pantheon portico, Rome, c. 1640 and Passion relic. Curiosities of nature, such as exotic animals, FIGURE 3 1: Passifloro caerulea moment, the native peoples there about the salvation brought to humanity through Christ's Passion. Its existence is therefore no mere curiosity of nature, but at once a witness to God's presence throughout Creation and his providential ordering of human history. The seventeenth-century devotional literature on the pas- sionflower indicates a connection between a mystical inter- pretation of the instruments in the blossom and private prayer practices common at the time, such as that advocated by St. FIGURE 32: Giacomo Bosio, Possionflower engraving, from Lo gloriosa e trionfante Ignatius. In the Spiritual Exercises the author advises the reader croce (Rome, 1610), 164 SCOTT: GUARINI'S PASSION CAPITALS 433 I</page><page sequence="17">FIGURE 33: Vittorio Amedeo Barralis, Sacred Anatomy of the Image of Our Lord Christ Imprinted on the Holy Shroud, woodcut, 1685 FIGURE 34: Vittorio Amedeo Barralis, Sacred Crown to be Presented to the Christ of the Passion on the Holy Shroud, woodcut, 1685 strange seashells, oddly shaped stones, and pictures of rare flowers-the kinds of objects collected in princely Wunderkam- mern through the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries-were objects of moralized interpretation as much as scientific scru- tiny. They embodied signs placed by God in the world to illustrate his omnipotence.78 Bosio explicated the passion- flower in this way, and the treatise writers on the Shroud viewed that relic in much the same light-as a sign placed by God in the world to demonstrate his suffering and love for human- kind.79 Like the passionflower it displayed the five major wounds of Christ. The authors of devotional treatises of the period recommended to their readers that upon seeing or meditating on the relic itself they should take care to concen- trate their sight in particular on the five bloody spots corre- sponding to the major wounds inflicted on the Savior's body, just as the elite ducal owners of the relic took advantage of each opportunity to kiss ceremoniously those same marks.80 Guarini was probably acquainted with at least one such author. Vittorio Amedeo Barralis, a fellow Theatine at Turin, published his instructional manual on the veneration of the Shroud in Turin in 1685, two years after Guarini's death.81 The author mentions the architect in the text, and it is likely that the two Theatines lived together in their congregation's house in Turin, not far from the construction site of the Shroud Chapel.82 Since Guarini himself left no recorded comment on the Shroud, this is about as close as we are likely to get to his thinking on the relic. Barralis's tract does not, in any case, exceed widely held commonplaces about the history of the relic and the manner of veneration due it. In order to understand Guarini's design for the Shroud 434 JSAH / 54:4, DECEMBER 1995</page><page sequence="18">Chapel we must investigate not only his use of symbolism but also how the space functioned ceremonially and devotionally. The architect and his patrons surely wished the design to accommodate the ritual exhibition of the relic and the courtly display surrounding it, but the desire to reinforce the modes of private spirituality already practiced around the Shroud was also a significant factor in the thinking behind the new chapel and its ornamentation. Barralis's manual provides useful insight into this world of personal worship and its connection to the cult of the Sacred Wounds. The little book is entitled Anotomia per la novena della Santa Sindone con una corona composta d'efetti sopra li principali misterii dellapassione (Sacred anatomy for the novena of the Holy Shroud with a crown composed of expressions of sentiment on the principal mysteries of the Passion) and belongs to the same genre of devotional literature as the passionflower treatises of earlier in the century. Barralis provides a mnemonic device in the form of a fold-out engraved plate to aid the reader with visual stimuli in meditating on the otherworldly value of the image on the Shroud [Figure 33].83 We see the figure from the Shroud surrounded by an octagonal enframement. This Barra- lis calls a "Sacred Anatomy of the Image of Our Lord Christ Imprinted on the Holy Shroud," and he instructs the reader to meditate on the wounds on Christ's body made by the instru- ments depicted in the border, among them the visage of Christ crowned with thorns seen on Veronica's veil prominently positioned at the top center.84 The wounds, on the front and back of the figure, are lettered and keyed to the written list at the lower left and right (A and K indicate the nail wounds, F and G the marks of the crown of thorns). Through the instruments represented around the edge, the worshiper meditates on the wounds and ultimately achieves a deeper understanding of the Passion. A second engraving in Barralis's manual [Figure 34] carries the designation "Sacred Crown to Be Presented to the Christ of the Passion on the Holy Shroud."85 Here a lozenge-shaped frame divided into labeled blocks forms a corona around the Shroud figure. Thirty-three numbered sections, interspersed with five Aves, refer to scenes of the Passion beginning with the washing of the disciples' feet (number 1), passing through the crowning with thorns at the midway point at the bottom (number 17), and concluding with the spear wound in Christ's side (number 33). This "Corona Sacra," as Barralis calls it, reflects a private devotional practice associated with the Shroud and encouraged by successive Theatine preachers at the Savoy court long before the publication of his little manual.86 It consisted of the oral recitation of a rosary-like string of beads representing narrative events of the Passion.87 The instruments of the Passion seen in Guarini's capitals and in various other parts of the chapel evince this devotion, but one additional pictorial component of the program was never realized. The engraved section of Guarini's first model for the chapel shows that narrative paintings of scenes of the Passion were intended for placement above the four subsidiary altars in the spaces between the pilasters with the Passion capitals [Figure 22].88 Two of these scenes appear in the section-a Crucifixion and a Lamentation, corresponding respectively to meditation number 28 and the last of the five Aves.89 The Passion imagery incorporated into the capitals and other ornamental components of the chapel formed a kind of spatial "Corona Sacra" to advance the cult of the Shroud and assist the worshiper in gaining the maximum spiritual benefit from the relic, just as Barralis's visual aids with their depicted instruments and inscribed scenes did for the viewer outside the chapel. The authors of devotional tracts on the Shroud, of whom Barralis is typical, manifest a desire to explicate the relic as a direct witness of the Passion. The image impressed on the linen cloth is no mere abstraction but a God-given means for attaining unmediated experience of Christ's suffering and sacrifice. Since the figure on the Shroud consists of Christ's own blood, that object deserves the adulation due to God himself (latria), not just the lesser form of veneration due to the saints and their relics (dulia).90 Guarini's inclusion of the instruments of the Passion in the capitals of the chapel rotunda reflect these traditional beliefs about the Savoy relic. REGALIA AND RANK IN THE PASSION CAPITALS The function of the chapel as a theater of dynastic self- representation influenced Guarini's thinking about the space and its ambient imagery. As the inscription "Aedes Regiae" on the engraved section from the Theatrum sabaudiae designates, this was a royal chapel [Figure 22]. The principal actors on this stage were the ducal family and court, with whom the Theatines had close association.91 We can get an idea of the exalted audience at which Barralis aimed from the dedicatee of his book, Fabrizio Buniato, ducal counselor and general treasurer of Vittorio Amedeo II. The Theatines received signs of special favor from the Savoy, who frequently appointed one from among their number to preach the Lenten sermons at the cathedral in the presence of the entire court.92 A Theatine also often delivered the oration presented on the occasion of the relic's exhibition.93 The Savoy even paid for the construction of the new Theatine church and adjoining house, Guarini's San Lorenzo, and made it a ducal chapel to complement the more specialized reliquary-palatine Shroud Chapel.94 Both Guarini and Barralis would therefore have been familiar with the aulic modes of devotion practiced around the cult of the Shroud. The three instruments Guarini employed in the pilaster capitals betoken the actual objects employed in Christ's Pas- sion, relics whose locations were well known in the seventeenth century and whose regal connotations were appropriate to the SCOTT: GUARINI'S PASSION CAPITALS 435</page><page sequence="19">FIGURE 35: Guarino Guarini, portal to Chapel of the Holy Shroud, 1667-69, Palazzo Reale, Turin palatial setting of the Savoy chapel.95 The Roman church of Santa Croce in Gerusalemme contained not only nails and portions of the cross but also the titulus-all sacred remains collected by Saint Helena, mother of Constantine.96 Relics of the nails could be found in many other places, but the one venerated in the cathedral of Milan (given to Constantine by Helena) and especially promoted, together with the Savoy Shroud, by San Carlo Borromeo, was perhaps the most fa- mous.97 The crown of thorns, attractive to royalty, was the central treasure of the hoard of relics (including more nails) for FIGURE 36: Overdoor, portal to Chapel of the Holy Shroud. FIGURE 37: Annunciate capital, portal to Chapel of the Holy Shroud which Louis IX, Saint Louis, built the Sainte-Chapelle adjacent to his palace on the Ile-de-la-Cite in Paris-a model not lost on the pious Savoy possessors of the Shroud, whose own reliquary chapel was constructed in similar proximity to their palace.98 In his collecting of Passion relics the French royal saint served as a role model for the Savoy. Ducal ideologues found it useful to parallel the lives of the sanctified Capetian monarch and Duke Louis of Savoy, who acquired the Shroud for his dynasty, a relic of status comparable to that of the crown of thorns in Paris.99 Significantly, a spine from that relic was among the other sacred objects installed in the Shroud Chapel by the Savoy.'00 In the case of the nails and crown of thorns, not only were they, like the Shroud, major instruments of the Passion; their doleful marks were recorded on the cloth, as Barralis and every other treatise writer observed. As for the titulus, with its proclamation of Christ as King, none of the Passion relics, save the crown of thorns, could have a more regal connotation for the aristocratic worshipers in the Shroud Chapel. Noting that 436 JSAH / 54:4, DECEMBER 1995</page><page sequence="20">its constituent parts were the regalia of the King of Kings, the moralizers of the passionflower called it the "King of Flow- ers."101 Thus the three emblematic components of Guarini's Passion capital all reinforce the idea of royal rank so fundamen- tal to the political meaning of the ducal chapel. Guarini's task entailed the creation of imagery appropriate not only to the religious function of the chapel but also to the social and political status of the patrons who built it for their use. This he achieved through the incorporation of Christ's regalia, the arma Christi, into the major order of the chapel rotunda. The signification of rank through the classical orders has a long tradition, but, to understand how Guarini expressed this in the Shroud Chapel, we must return to the principal ceremonial entrance, which leads in from the palace gallery [Figures 35-36].102 Because this door is now kept closed, its exterior portal is seldom seen, but, from the gallery side, its dark imagery unambiguously conveys the somber but courtly purposes of the chapel.103 The projecting components of coat-of-arms, broken pediment, polygonal cartouche, fluted pilasters, and flanking funerary urns dominate the ample space of the gallery and assertively announce access to the Shroud Chapel. The gilded bronze capitals Guarini designed for the flank- ing pilasters here are unique among those he created for the FIGURE 38: Bernardo Giustinian, grand chain and pendant medallion of the Supreme Order of the Santissima Annunziata, engraving, from Historie cronologiche della vera origine di tutti gl'ordini militari e di tutte le religioni cavalleresche .. . (Venice, 1672) chapel and they appropriately conform to the exalted rank of the personages who frequented that portal [Figure 37]. They consist of a modified conflation of two examples illustrated in the Architettura civile [Figure 12]. As in Guarini's number 37, the acanthus spirals curl in the opposite direction of the canonical type, and, with this outward-sweeping movement, support the extended wings of the descending dove of the Holy Spirit, much as do the flames in the capital with the phoenix illus- trated in the treatise (number 36).104 The wings of the dove parallel the concavity of the abacus much as does the titulus of the Passion capitals. This new variant could appropriately be called the Annunci- ate capital, for no one at court would have failed to notice the allusion to the senior of the two chivalric orders patronized by the Savoy, the Supreme Order of the Santissima Annunziata, whose insignia consisted of a knotted golden chain with pen- dant medallion representing the Annunciation with the Holy Spirit alighting from above [Figure 38].105 The Savoy sovereign, as commander of the order, wore this chain, and we can see it surrounding his arms [Figure 39] and in mass-produced images of the Shroud.106 The twenty individuals decorated with this honor constituted an elite group among the knighted aristoc- FIGURE 39: FranSois Capre, Savoy coat of arms with grand chain and pendant medallion of the Supreme Order of the Santissima Annunziata, engraving, from Catalogue des chevaliers de I'ordre du collier de Savoye, dict de I'annonciade (Turin, 1645) SCOTT: GUARINI'S PASSION CAPITALS 437</page><page sequence="21">FIGURE 40: L. Gaultier, Saint-Louis, King of France, engraving from Jean de Joinville, Histoire de S. Loys IX (Paris, 1617) racy at the Savoy court, with the reigning duke as Grand Master.107 In this capacity they were principals in the ritual exhibitions of the Shroud when the relic would be removed from its housing and carried ceremoniously out of the chapel through the gallery portal [Figure 35] and adjoining royal apartments to the square in front of the palace for public ostension.108 At the summit of the portal, putti crown the large Savoy arms with an unusually prominent royal crown closed at the top. After decades of dispute, the dukes of Savoy had once again in 1660 republished their claim to the royal tite of king of Cyprus.109 This achievement constituted a major event for the dynasty, for it trumped the pretensions of their chief rivals in Italy, the grand dukes of Tuscany, who, as elevated dukes, were wont to claim precedence over the Savoy. In this political context, the inclusion of the titulus in the Passion capitals, with its declaration of Christ's kingly status, reiterates not only the courtly function of the chapel but also the recently acquired regal rank of the House of Savoy. Collecting relics of the Passion was the passion of kings and emperors long before the Savoy achieved political prominence. As we have already seen, for the francophone dukes the most admired example to follow in this pious and politically useful endeavor was Saint Louis, who knew well how to exploit the worldly power of the Passion relics in his possession. The equation between the emblems of Christ's sovereignty and those of the French king as perpetuated in widely disseminated imagery of Louis, as in the portrait of the royal saint that illustrated the 1617 edition ofJoinville's early biography of the king [Figure 40]. 10 The parallelism between Christ's crown and Louis's haloed diadem cannot be missed, nor the allusion to sacral kingship. Even the fleurs-de-lis on the king's tunic and surmounting his scepter recapitulate the tripartite configura- tion of the nails. Guarini's Passion capitals not only refer to the Savoy Passion relic; they embody in Christological form the most cherished social and political aspirations of its dynastic owners. Guarini's allusion to the newly reasserted title of the dukes of Savoy through the use of Christ's regalia would unquestionably have appeared logical to contemporaries. If the dukes gained their royal designation through their legal claim on the king- dom of Cyprus, they also held moral right to the Shroud through that same connection. The title to the Cypriot crown came from the marriage of Duke Louis of Savoy's son, Louis, Count of Geneva, to Charlotte de Lusignan, Queen of Cyprus, in 1459.11 As court historians noted, since the dukes of Lusig- nan also held title to the defunct Latin Kingdom ofJerusalem, it therefore was only proper that the Savoy held the Shroud, for that same relic had, after its removal from Constantinople, for a time been the revered possession of the Lusignan.112 Thus both Shroud and royal tide derived, at least in the thinking of the ideologues, from the Cyprus connection. For the court poets and treatise writers this concatenation of privileges was the handiwork of Divine Providence, which favored the Savoy above all other ruling houses of Christendom.113 No one, moreover, had to be reminded that the Savoy coat of arms itself consisted of the most important of all the Passion relics. The silver Greek cross against a red field appears in the family shield [Figure 39], and Guarini repeated the motif, literally ad infinitum, in the coffering of the chapel pendentives [Figures 41-42]. CONCLUSION The Passion capitals participated actively in the devotional and dynastic programs of the Shroud Chapel. They served as stimuli to courtly piety, but, more than that, the innovative incorporation of the instruments of the Passion into the capitals surrounding the altar-reliquary would have assisted the wor- shiper visually, for want of the Shroud itself, much as did Barralis's pious schematic illustrations. Just as the engraved wound-bearing figure of Christ appears encircled by instru- 438 JSAH / 54:4, DECEMBER 1995</page><page sequence="22">FIGURE 41: Guarino Guarini, pendentive coffering with Savoy cross, Chapel of the Holy Shroud ments of the Passion in the visual aid, so do Guarini's Passion capitals with their decorous imagery surround the central reliquary and encourage the viewer's recollection of the events that made the wound marks on the image-stained Shroud itself-narrative events that were originally to have been de- picted in the spaces between the pilasters. Guarini expanded the meaning of the Corinthian order without violating the nature or basic composition of the canoni- cal type. Within the sacred space around the Shroud, he eschewed the sometimes trivial and anecdotal punning of his predecessors and contemporaries by manipulating the compo- nents of the classical orders to convey thematic significance, making of them visual means of spiritual communication. Yet the content of Guarini's imagery, while fresh and creative, still rests well within the parameters of seventeenth-century Chris- tian iconography. We see in the design of the Passion capitals, as well as in the text and illustrations of the Architettura civile, an architect who, for all his searching curiosity and imaginative power, refuses to fit the molds created for him in the extremes of the scholarly literature. Examining his treatment of the classical orders, we find neither Guarini the occultist nor Guarini the moder formalist. Thus, whether advocating or disallowing a place for meaning in Guarini's works, we must first understand the architect fully in the context of seventeenth-century piety, patronage, and architectural culture. Appendix The documentation ofthe Passion capitals In the construction period before Guarini's assumption of project supervision, 1656-67, there were numerous expendi- tures related to the manufacture of the capitals (materials, SCOTT: GUARINI'S PASSION CAPITALS 439</page><page sequence="23">FIGURE 42: Guarino Guarini, detail of pendentive coffering with Savoy cross, Chapel of the Holy Shroud equipment, foundry space, transport, etc.) in addition to pay- ments made directly to the bronze founders Lorenzo Frugone and Simon Boucheron."' Many payments for gold and labor for the gilding by Giovanni Battista Perico and Francesco Buonpiede occurred in the same period, as did disburse- ments to the carpenter for cloth and wooden boxes to protect the newly gilded capitals as construction progressed. These documents indicate that some capitals were already in place by the end of the pre-Guarini period.l15 Although there can be no doubt that these were produced from Bernardino Quadri's design before Guarini's appearance on the scene, they were for the minor-order columns of the chapel rotunda and the small pilasters facing them [Figures 4 and 7].116 There is no mention in this early period of capitals for the major-order pilasters. The first payment for the new wooden model for the Shroud Chapel, based on Guarini's design, is dated 30 April 1667.ll7 During the initial six years of work under the Theatine priest's direction, the bronze work was primarily for the elaborate pilaster-flanked door on the palace gallery side of the entrance to the chapel seen at the top of the plan (at the apex of the triangle), which was the major ceremonial portal [Figures 4 and 35], and for the minor-order column capitals inside that same opening. 18 This period of work also produced the comparably sized capitals of the stair landing on the left leading in from the cathedral.119 For the remaining capitals of all minor-order columns inside the chapel Guarini followed Quadri's standard Corinthian rendering, as already in place on the columns of the stair landing on the right and on the minor-order columns in the four recesses in the upper half of the rotunda plan [Figures 4 and 7]. Payments to the sculptor-bronze founder Bernardo Falconi began on 3 October 1669 for the capitals of the two freestanding columns flanking the opening to the cathedral [Figures 8-9] and, possibly, also for two of the corresponding pilaster capitals of the rotunda.120 These four capitals reflect a new design. A payment of 15 July 1672 indicates that some three-sided capitals (as are those of the major-order pilasters seen in Figure 5) had been removed and sent back to Boucheron because they did not follow Guarini's instruction.121 This activ- ity records Guarini's intervention to enforce conformity to his model for the capitals in the chapel, but, surprisingly, no further payments for capitals occurred between that date and Guarini's death in 1683. The only Passion capitals we can be certain were executed and put in place under Guarini's supervi- sion are those of the two fluted columns facing the cathedral choir located between the flanking stairs [Figure 9]. By persisting in a chronological review of the payments, however, we learn the full production history of the Passion capitals. Documents of 10 and 26 May 1688 indicate that the casting of six of the eight pilaster capitals still remained to be accomplished at that late date.122 Awork order given to Falconi and signed by Guarini's successor, Antonio Bertola, who was in charge of completing the chapel and its furnishings, clarifies the issue.123 The six capitals to be cast for the chapel pilasters, the document tells us, were to be of the same "ornate" Corinthian as those already made (i.e., like Guarini's); the nails and crown of thorns should be well executed and rendered in high relief. The facture should not be of inferior quality and beauty to that of the bronze works already completed in the chapel.124 But the capitals were still not finished at Falconi's death, as we learn from the document of 3 December 1692 contracting another founder, Francesco Amonet, to complete the project.125 By 11 February 1694 the final six pilaster capitals were at last in place in the chapel, just three and one-half months prior to the installation of its relic on 1 June of that same year.126 ABBREVIATIONS ACT Archivio Capitolare, Turin AFMCT Archivio Fotografico dei Musei Civici, Turin APRMN Archives Photographiques de la Reunion des Musees Nationaux art. articolo ASTR Archivio di Stato di Torino, Riunite BAV Biblioteca Apostolica Vaticana BRT Biblioteca Reale, Turin CIST Centro Interazionale di Sindonologia, Turin DBI Dizionario biografico degli Italiani (Rome, 1960-) GFSGF Gabinetto Fotografico della Soprintendenza alle Gallerie, Florence GGIB Guarino Guarini e l'internazionalita del barocco, 2 vols.

Guarini's treatise was written in the late 1670s-1683. The plates illustrating the orders and their application, together with plans, elevations, and sections of Guarini's own buildings, were first published, without text, as Guarino Guarini, Dissegni d'architettura civile et ecclesiastica... (Turin, 1686), where the frontispiece states that the images were "invented and drawn" by Padre Guarini. The text was first published in 1787. The Dissegni is reprinted in Bernardi Ferrero, Disegni (see n. 1), 89-. Few of the original drawings have survived, but the plates seem to have been engraved before Guarini's death and subsequently left with his Thea- tine brothers in Turin, who undertook to have them published (ibid., 7). Inscriptions on many of the plates declare Guarini's authorship, and the dedications of individual engravings also seem to confirm the involvment of the architect. These dedication inscriptions were removed from the plates before the printing of the 1737 edition. On the authenticity of the en- gravings and the mediocrity of the engravers, see Aldo Bertini, "I1 disegno del Guarini e le incisioni del trattato di Architettura civile," in GGIB 1:597-610. 17Guarini may have been encouraged toward this liberal, open-ended attitude by the treatise of the Spanish Benedictine Juan Ricci Ramfrez, "Gua- rini," 175-85. 18 Guarini names this the "Third" or "Supreme" Corinthian order. Guarini, Architettura, 113-17, 123, and pl. 4; Ramirez, "Guarini," 175-85. 19 Ramirez (ibid., 177) holds instead that Guarini actually sought to stop the multipication of orders and limit them to a set, if expanded, number. The tone of Guarini's discussion and the large number of variations he presents in both text and illustrations seem to contradict such an intention. 20 Such as the Peruvian nasturtia he places at the angles of the capital of the "Third" Doric order. Guarini,Architettura, 93, pl. 3. 21 Ibid., 129. In Rome, about this same time, Borromini inserted saintly crowns and other symbolic elements into his design for the facade capitals of San Carlo alle Quattro Fontane. Smith, ClassicalArchitecture, 13-14. 22 These being the female reproductive parts of the flower's stamen. 23 In the Architettura civile, Guarini similarly positioned a laurel crown in the capital of his 'Third" Corinthian (Solomonic) order (Figure 10) and in a related Corinthian variant (Figure 11, number 22). Guarini, Architettura, pls. 3 and 5. 24 Vitruvius, 4.1.7-12. 23 Guarini, like many of his predecessors, starts from the premise that the orders carry meaning. On this tradition, see John Onians, Bearers of Meaning: The Classical Orders in Antiquity, the Middle Ages, and the Renaissance (Princeton, 1988), esp. 141-330. 26 Guarini, Architettura, 121-22. Franco Borsi, "Guarino Guarini a Messina," in GGIB 1:71-90, fig. 6, illustrates one of the damaged iris capitals salvaged from the destroyed church and now abandoned in the courtyard of the Museo Nazionale, Messina. 27 Guarini, Architettura, 122. On Colbert's competition, which took place in 1671, seeJean-Marie Perouse de Monclos, Histoire de l'architecturefranfaise de la Renaissance a la Revolution (Paris, 1989), 226-32. A century before Colbert's competition Philibert Delorme proposed an ideologically based order, the "French Column," but focused his invention on the shaft rather than the capital.

In separate plates Paleotti represented the nail-punctured soles of Christ's feet. He appar- ently examined the Shroud firsthand and with intense scrutiny. He seems to have been the first person to notice (but only in the first edition of 1598) that the nail wounds were located not in the hands, as tradition held, but in the wrists, as would have been necessary for support. On Paleotti and his book, see Mario Fanti, "Genesi e vicende del libro di Alfonso Paleotti sulla Sindone," in L. Coppini and F.

On his pilgrimage to see the Shroud in 1578, Carlo Borromeo and some members of his famiglia gained privileged access to the relic and kissed the wound marks on the side and feet. For the contemporary account left by Jesuit Francesco Adorno, a member of Borromeo's entourage, see Pietro Savio, "Pellegrinaggio di San Carlo Borromeo alla Sindone in Torino," Aevum 7 (1933): 423-54, esp. 448. 40 Giambattista Marino, II ritratto del Serenissimo Don Carlo Emanuello, Duca di Savoja, panegirico (Venice, 1628), 80 [Ist ed., Turin, 1608]: E fu legge fatal, forse da Dio Con caratteri d'or lassi scolpita, Che de le piaghe, onde in sanguigno rio Per cinque ampi canali usci la vita, La sacra stampa in bianco drappo impressa Non fusse in terra ad altra man commessa.

Even the scourge marks are visible on the back. 43The reliquary-altar assemblage, with its flanking angels and sunburst above, derives from Bernini's Cathedrapetri in Saint Peter's and from the sculpted Angels Holding the Instruments of the Passion on the Ponte Sant'Angelo, Rome (1667-1672). On Bernini's angels with the instruments, see Mark S. Weil, The History and Decoration of the Ponte S. Angelo (University Park, 1974), 31-88. 44 See, for example, Lione da Daudet, The Altar of the Holy Shroud, engraving on silk, 1737, 29 by 46 centimeters, illustrated in Carlo Lovera di Castiglione and Carlo Merlo, eds., L'ostensione della Santa Sindone (Turin, 1931), 60, cat. 54, pl.

See, for example, the pentagons in the pendentives of San Lorenzo as represented in the section in the Architettura civile. The geometry is less regular and apparent in the pendentives as executed in the Theatine church. The unexecuted project for San Gaetano, Nice, rose on a pentagonal plan. Guarini, Architettura, pls. 6, 12-13. Because the contexts are not as charged with Passion imagery, a Christological reading of these forms would be less obvious but still appropriate. 52 The payment of ?80 to the locksmith who fashioned it, Giovanni Pietro Farino, is dated 10 April 1683.

Monardes bases his understanding of the utility of plants on the Doctrine of Signatures, which holds that God, in his providence, placed flowers, fruits, and roots in the world for the benefit of humankind. In such plants God has left a sign to inform us of the medicinally beneficial properties of each, and those signs take the shape of the organ of the body for which it is palliative. Thus, for example, since the granadilla (passion fruit) somewhat resembles the human stomach, it therefore possesses healing potential for digestive disorders. 63 Samuel Purchas, Purchas: His Pilgrimes..., 4 vols.

(Venice, 1840-61) 17:193-200. Barralis's "Corona" is clearly derived from the rosary, which also consists of decades of Aves interspersed amid the fifteen mysteries, the middle five of which are "sorrowful," i.e., of the Passion: Agony in the Garden, Flagellation, Crowning with Thorns, Carrying of the Cross, and Crucifixion. Ibid., 59:150-51. 88 The papal nuncio in Turin described the chapel in some detail in his report on its consecration in 1694, indicating that the scenes of the "four mysteries" (of the Passion) had yet to be completed. There is no evidence that they were ever painted. Transcribed in Savio, Ricerche, 329. In the 1840s Carlo Alberto filled the spaces with dynastic tomb monuments. 89As explained in Barralis, Anotomia, 106-8, 117-19. Other scenes (a Resurrection and Angels Holding the Cross) were to appear just outside the chapel on the cathedral choir walls, as seen in the lower left of the Theatrum engraving (Figure 22). 90 Paleotti, Esplicatione, 50. 91 Like the medicant orders, the Theatines took vows of poverty, but, at the SCO7T: GUARINI'S PASSION CAPITALS 443</page><page sequence="27">same time, their rule forbade them to seek alms in public.

See the report of the papal nuncio dated 4 June 1694: the chapel "ha la sua porta maggiore nella galleria al piano dell'appartamento del palazzo nuovo del signor Duca...." As transcribed in Savio, Ricerche, 329. '04Guarini, Architettura, pl. 11. On the history and incidence of inverted volutes in Corinthian and Composite capitals, see Leo Steinberg, Borromini's San Carlo alle Quattro Fontane: A Study in Multiple Form and Architectural Symbolism (New York, 1977), 208-17. For Borromini's use of the motif, see ibid., 201-7, and Ingamaj Beck, "II capitello composito a volute invertite: saggio su una forma antica nella struttura borrominiana," Analecta Romana Instituti Danici 6 (1971): 225-34. 105 On the Supreme Order of the Santissima Annunziata, see Luigi Cibrario, Notizia storica dell'ordine supremo della Santissima Annunziata ... (Florence, 1869). The order was the Savoyard equivalent of the Habsburg Order of the Golden Fleece and especially the French Royal Order of the Saint-Esprit. The knots of the chain are devices of the Savoy. 106 Lovera di Castiglione and Merlo, Ostensione (see n. 44), 55, cat. 9, pl. 26. 107 The number of knights represented the fifteen Mysteries of the Virgin and the five Wounds of Christ.

(Turin, 1778-80), 1:97-98 [1st ed., Lyon, 1660]. The claim had been made by the Savoy much earlier, but the title was disputed, especially by Venice, and not universally recognized. Pierre Monod, Trattato del titolo regio dovuto alla serenis- sima casa di Savoia, insieme con un ristretto delle rivolutioni del reame di Cipri appartenente alla corona dell'altezza reale di Vittorio Amedeo ... (Turin, 1633); idem, Coelum allobrogicum, hoc est, Victoris Amedei, serenissimi Cypriorum regis, atque allobrogum ducis potentissimi, corona regia panegyricus (Lyon, 1634). The island realm had been under Turkish control since 1571, and remained so until the British obtained it in 1878, but for the Savoy the title was the substance of the claim.

As Marino put it, their possession of the Shroud demonstrated that the Savoy were "above every other house, beloved by heaven." See above, n. 40. 114 The earliest of these dates is 7 February 1659 (ASTR, Art. 195, m. 1, reg. 1, 16r) and the last 21 March 1667 (ASTR, Art. 197, reg. 12, 87r).

Also, Tamburini, Chiese di Torino, 224. 116 The documents in this early period refer only to capitals for columns and for the piers facing them. The payment of 7 February 1659 refers to "capitelli di bronzo che mancano alli grossi colonne..." (ASTR, Art. 195, reg. 1, 16r); another document records the completion of 14 pier capitals ("contracapitelli") between 24July and 22 December 1659 (ASTR, Art. 197, reg. 12, 24r); and a later payment of 1 December 1661 (Ibid., 39v) indicates "capitelli e basi di metallo che fa per le collonne di marmo alla capella..." 117 ASTR, Art. 179, m. 8, reg. 2, no. 8, as cited in Carboneri, "Vicenda," 106 and n. 38; also see ASTR, Art. 197, reg. 12, 87v. 118 The pilasters appear clearly on the plan, marking the entrance in the gallery connecting the chapel to the palace at piano nobile level. For capitals and other bronze work for the entrance from the palace (both inside the chapel and outside in the palace gallery), beginning 6 February 1668, see ASTR, Art. 179, m. 8, reg. 2 (1667-69), nos. 6, 8, 18, 31, 35, 37, 41; Art. 195, reg. 1 bis (1667-77), lv, 2r; and Art. 197, reg. 12 (1657-73), 96v, 97r-98r, 106r-v, 107v, 110r, 11 v-112r, 144r. 119 For the capitals of the left stair landing beginning on 12 June, 1669, see ASTR, Art. 197, reg. 12 (1657-73), 144v-145r. For capitals without specified location but because of document dates, probably to be associated with either the palace entry portal or the left stair landing, see ASTR, Art. 179, m. 8, reg. 2 (1667-69), nos. 2,12,15,27,28,33,36,40,42,44-45,54,64; Art. 195, reg. 1 bis (1667-77), lv, 5r; and Art. 195, reg. 12 (1657-73), 92v, 97r, 98r, 102v, 105r, 107r-108r, 109v, 110v, 112v, 113r-v, 114v, 115v-116r, 117r, 119r-120v, 121v-122r, 125r, 142v-143r. 120 Falconi received ?1080 for metal for the "gran capitelli delle due colonne 444 JSAH / 54:4, DECEMBER 1995</page><page sequence="28">grosse per la capella..." (ASTR, Art. 179, m. 8, reg. 2, no. 50), with similar payments on 5 October 1669, 12 February 1670, and 4 October 1670 (ASTR, Art. 197, reg. 12, 113v-114r, 115v, 120r). On 5 October 1669 he received another ?900 for "gran capitelli di metallo che fa fare per li pilastroni et grosse colonne per la capella..." (ASTR, Art. 179, m. 8, reg. 2, no. 49; see also ASTR, Art. 197, reg. 12, 113v, at same date), with similar payments on 15July 1672 and 6 April 1673 (ibid., 143r). The fully rounded capitals of the two fluted columns have the titulus. On Falconi, see Baudi di Vesme, Schede, 2:448-51. 121 "... Capitelli triangolari disfatti che non havuto potuto servire conforme al dissegno del Padre D. Guerini, e percio rimessili per reffondere ..." (ASTR, Art. 197, reg. 12, 143r). 122 The bronze founder received an advance of? 1500. ASTR, Art. 199, reg. 9, 3r-4r and 31v-36r; ASTR, Art. 193, 43r-52v. By 11 October 1688 Falconi had completed two of the capitals and finished the molds of the other four. ASTR, Art. 199, reg. 9, 88r-89r. 123 On Bertola, see Baudi di Vesme, Schede, 1:127-28; Brayda et al., Ingegneri (see n. 10), 16; Nino Carboneri, "Antonio Bertola," in DBI 9:562-63; and Millon, "Guarino Guarini," in Macmillan Encyclopedia ofArchitects, 1:265-79. 124 26 May 1688: "Instruzione da osservarsi nella constructtione delli capitelli. Li capitelli che si devono construere per li sei pilastroni nella Capella del Sant.mo Sudario sarano di quel med.mo ordine Corinto ornato conforme si vedono li gia fatti.... Che li fiori o chiodi, e corona di spine in luoro vece sii ricercato, e ben rillevato ... Che le foglie siino attacate alla campanna con viti o chiavi; et in tal maniera che facendo un homo forza con la mano non le possa staccare. Che ogni parte del resto de capitelli sudetti habbi li suoi angoli ben proffillati rillevati, limati, puliti, e lustri in modo che tutta la fattura de medesimi non sia inferiore alli piii belli; che si trovano in opera nella detta capella." ASTR, Art. 199, reg. 9, 31v-36r. The wording makes clear, as does close examination of the capitals them- selves, that they were not cast as a unit but are made up of many individual parts pieced together and held in place by pins and screws (Figure 29). 125 ASTR, Art. 199, reg. 10, 77v-85r. 126 Ibid., 186v-187r.
