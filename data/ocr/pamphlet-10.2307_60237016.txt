Abt. IV.— 1. Hugonis Grotii De Jure Belli et Pacis libri tres. Accompanied by an Abridged Translation. By William Whewell, D.D. 3 vols. Cambridge: 1859. 2. Commentaries upon International Law. By Robert Phillimoee, Doctor of Laws. 3 vols, published. 8vo. London: 1859. T^he British public are obliged to Dr. Whewell for givino- them occasion to refresh their acquaintance with the great mother work of International Law. The service is more¬ over opportune to the times. The system of alliances, whether Holy or otherwise, to which for a generation back we have been wont to look as the public law of Europe, is shaken and de¬ stroyed. The balance of the Powers trembles violently and variously. The policy of nations changes sides from day to day, with the moral indifference of pieces on a chess-board. Religion is arrayed against liberty and nationality, and the enormous armaments of almost all civilised nations prove that they are again compelled to rely on force rather than on law for the defence of their rights and the preservation of their independence. Amid this chaos of all landmarks whether sacred or social, one is tempted to ask, What is our boasted civilisation Where is that mental progress which we so loudly claim as the prero¬ gative of man and the legacy of history Have heroes lived, martyrs died, sages thought, sciences marched, but to leave us after all to the arbitrament of force, or of a policy as headless, as heartless, and still more fickle Where, then, are those laws of universal and changeless rectitude, which philosophers discourse of for two thousand years back, and whose seed, though it might fall for a time upon the rock, could not fail to find a soil wherein to strike its roots the deeper, in proportion as human reason was developed to receive them Is it the fact, and not a national incompetence of comprehension, that permitted anltalian jurisconsult,Lampredi, andafter him a Britishprofessor, Dugald Stewart, to say, with relation to Grotius and his subject, that ' the same ideas are constantly returning in an eternal ' circle while in the meantime the science of natural 'jurisprudence never advances a single step; but notwith- ' standing its recent birth, seems already sunk into a state of ' dotage ?' Is this noblest of the structures of social reason a child's cardhouse, to be overthrown with each whim or ebulli¬ tion of the several governments, and thus humanity be left the Sisyphus of justice as well as happiness</page><page sequence="3">1860. International Law. 387 To persons disposed to reflections of this tenor on the actual condition of European nations, the natural resort is the writers on the subject. Among these writers, Grotius may still be ranked the principal. Not of course for the selectnessor appli¬ cation of his doctrines; but for the sources and the discussions, which are more useful to general readers. This distinction is observable, whatsoever the subject. There is something in the founder which is never superseded by any reproduction or improvement of followers. Originality instructs us by its very defects. Beside the matter in hand, it presents a coun¬ ter-impress of the circumjacent mass from which the fragment was detached; whereas the fragment forms the whole stock in trade of the disciples. To these, the insulated essay is the sole object visible; and hence an inverse tendency to take it for the whole, or at least for the centre and soul of the subject. They fancy their own planet into the solar position. They raise the author to a god in hopes of passing for his high priests. They disguise through vanity, they darken by illustration, they dislocate by method, they weaken by improvement. These parasitical productions then, though practically the more useful, can never with the student or the careful reader replace the original. And this proportional importance is attested by nature; which for one creative intellect, spawns a thousand mediocrities, fully capable of commenting and even enlarging things once created. Who that comprehends, for instance, Aristotle's philosophy, can recognise the master in even the best of his expositors? Who can estimate the fragmentary Organon of Bacon, so well from all the glosses of Scotch professors and flippant essayists, as from the simple perusal of those profound yet precise apophthegms, which grasp and gather in the meaning with admirable prehensibility, and whicli stamp along the page a set of characters so significant, that, like the leaf-prints or the foot¬ prints in fossil deposits, they lure imagination back into the scenes of vanished worlds. Indeed Bacon is perhaps the best example in all history of the perpetual value of the original writer. He proposes to reform the world in the science of method, by a book which is itself without a semblance of any : and yet few readers will account him presumptuous or incom¬ petent. What he teaches you positively does not come to much, and most of even that is in substance not original; yet by his manner of selecting and expressing those detached thoughts, and especially of extracting them from the vitals of decayed learning, he seems as if exhibiting but mere samples of his treasures; he has the mystic air of an Oriental conjuror, supposed to hold the</page><page sequence="4">388 Grotius and the Sources of Oct. keys to so many caves of knowledge; he excites the imagination and through it amplifies the intellect, in the endeavour to explore the positive complement of his criticism. Some degree of this power of suggestion and solemnity of expression enhances likewise the work of Grotius on International Law. But this is not enough for the inquiries above supposed. It bears upon the accidents of author, age or work, more than on the proper essence of public jurisprudence. There is perhaps not a doctrine or opinion in Grotius that had not been presented by some anterior writer; the real innovation was the grand con¬ glomeration, or rather the new principle, that prompted and permitted it. Unless, then, we know the existence of this principle, and have besides some means by which to test its truth to nature, the book is practically of no use to us towards solving the perplexities or soothing the anxieties suggested in the opening paragraph. Without a scale there is no determining the juridical authority, the scientific character, or psychologic import. But with it, all those traits may be assigned, not alone to Grotius, but to all other writers on the subject. This criterion no commentator of the work of Grotius has hitherto supplied, or attempted to supply. Dr. Whew ell, who is the latest, does not even see the need of it. Pie praises and defends with the usual generalities, and afterwards confines himself to his ' selective' version. The selection consists in omitting the quotations, which form, it is known, a large proportion of the text, and here and there inserting explanatory phrases. The utility of this gutting of the Dutch plethora is doubtful, and so the execution is hardly worth examining. The version, however, as far as we have looked through it, does not appear remarkable for elegance, or even accuracy. For ex¬ ample, a maxim of Cicero is rendered, ' There are duties even ' against (adversus~) those who have injured us.' But more gravely reprehensible are the explanatory phrases, which sometimes make a systematic change in the meaning. This, however, of course through prepossessions of doctrine, not from any incom¬ pleteness of acquaintance with the Latin idiom. Dr. Whe- well's praises are also maladroit. ' Solid philosophic prin- ' ciples,' ' orderly distribution,' and even ' exact definition' are not the forte of Grotius; but an editor may be excused the license of his calling. Dr. Phillimore, in his still later and in¬ dependent publication, reiterates, without a like excuse, the vague eulogies, while he has not a syllable or even a surmise of characterisation, as will be seen hereafter. So that up to the latest date, the place and value of Grotius, as an authority in the Laiu of Nations, remains quite undetermined.</page><page sequence="5">1860. International Law. 389 Indeed, so undetermined that writers of distinction, such for instance as Dugald Stewart, and before him Jean Jacques Rousseau, have denied the work of Grotius all scientific value. Mr. Hallam, in his vindication from the diatribe of Stewart, is also driven to that last refuge of advocacy, known among logi¬ cians as the argument ad verecundiam. Instead of proving his client's merits, he preaches modesty to the accuser. With some consciousness of the weakness, he returns to the task, in a subsequent division of his work.* But here, too, the answer is still no other than a slight analysis of the treatise itself: ' So ' that the reader, having seen for himself what it is, may not ' stand in need of any arguments or testimony to refute those 'who have represented it as it is not.' This naive reply of course evaded the objections. The public may be brought to see that one thing is not another, and yet be no whit the wiser as to the essence of either ; but this essence was the veritable question at bottom. Still further was the answer from touching Stewart's criticisms; which, seeing nothing of this true ques¬ tion, turned mainly on the adjuncts of uncouthness of manner, and the lack of originality. The analysis of course excluded wholly the former, and only wrapt the latter in greater per¬ plexity. The inference must be, then, that even Mr. Hallam, with all his various learning and his critical experience, failed to discover and point out in the work of Grotius those qualities which most effectually vindicate its fame. Sir James Mackintosh had preceded him in a like strain. He is indeed not extravagant, but only rhetorical. What he says of the learning and virtue of Grotius was never called in question, and might therefore look like surplusage. The plea, that his citations are always made to support principles, is far from being fully true, and were it otherwise, would not excuse citation to excess. It would only aggravate it, on the contrary. For multiplied quotation, while a virtue in induction, where a principle or law is to be gathered from such cases, must, in the inverse process, be impertinent in argument, and weaken the law by multiplicity of illustration. Grotius, it is true, con¬ founds habitually the two procedures, we mean the illustration and the induction. But it is odd that the distinction or the existence of the latter element, on which in fact is based the main principle of his system, should not have been detected by men so anxious for his fame, and withal such adepts in the Baconian logic. Mackintosh, however, remarks of the quota¬ tions, that such sentiments as they contain ' are the materials * Lit. of Europe, vol. ii. p. 545, 4th ed.</page><page sequence="6">390 Grotius and the Sources of Oct. ' out of which the science of morality has been formed;' * but he does not say, by Grotius. And moreover, if this has been the natural order, what becomes of the defence with which the apology commenced, of first appealing to some principle to control the citations It may be owned that the vast popularity of Grotius was at the outset due, in fact, to adventitious circumstances. Chief among these appear to us to be the following: There was, first, a profusion and variety of classic learning, which had its highest attraction at this noon of the Revival. Then, the mul¬ titude were taken by the religious spirit, and the copious cita¬ tions from the Bible and the Fathers. Further, the universities in all the Reformed countries adopted the book of Grotius, from opposition to the Canonists. Another circumstance was his assertion of the prerogative of kings; a class who were in reality the chief agents of the Reformation, and so would favour an authority that sanctioned the autonomy which the great event alluded to had given to the minor Princes of Ger¬ many. But the universal element of academical success in the work was the casuistic character of both the argument and illustration. But these advantages, although they have buoyed up the work of Grotius, have never upheld this or any other, beyond the day. The persistence of that work, then —for it does, we see, persist, in spite of powerful assailants and seasons of oblivion—directs us for its cause to something deeper in the subject. And to this we now venture to address a few remarks, which, as they must be succinct, we shall seek to render me¬ thodical. In fact, to give the results some completeness and conclusive¬ ness, we must attempt a sketch of the history of the Law of Nations, as resolved into its principles, or as they say in France, raisonnee. If in the course of this inquiry the latent import of the work of Grotius, with the occasion of its defects and other characters, should be evolved, there is no sort of human evidence so satisfactory or even so popular. It is essentially of the nature of that by which a Leverrier, from the concert of two or three laws, or of one law in two or three positions, com¬ mands the instant and absolute assent of all mankind to the existence of a new planet, with all its elements of time, mass, distance. Nay, the chances of aberration in the simple subject of astronomy would be incalculably greater than in the system of social history. Int. Law of Nature and Nations, p. 25.</page><page sequence="7">1860. International Law. 391 This history, as that of all human operations, has taken its commencement from the agency of the gods. Men could mould their infant governments as they could measure their planet, but by looking away from the earth to the stars. As the father gave the law to the first community of the Family, so by an easy extension, the community of the State, or of an aggregate of states, continued long to derive it from a similarly abstract and thus a divine father. Accordingly the term Jus was de¬ rived by some of the ancients, rather fancifully than philologi- cally, from Zeus, meaning that the Supreme Deity was the fountain, and even the fact, of universal law. The pro¬ cession is repeated in the kindred term religion; which means bond, not of union, as is commonly pretended, but a mere in¬ dividual obligation — res ligans. The term obligation itself is quite synonymous. Both the notions are extensions of paternal dominion and of filial obedience from the family to the society. The father, whether natural or preternatural, was the master, from whom the children individually must receive law as they did life. He is thus a living rule by which their differences are adjusted, their conduct directed, their interests equalised. This was the primordial, and must still be the historical, con¬ ception of Jus, which means spontaneous or natural law. There was no notion of those ' rights,' by which the word is mis¬ translated, nor of even obligation directly between the citizens, but simply of a common concentration of obedience and a reci¬ procal irradiation of will and weal from the divinity. It is the primary plan of nature in all her stages of organisation, as in the ray-fishes, in the lichens, and back even to the crystals. Such was then the primary and positive law of justice within each single family, tribe, city, or nation; and such is also the reason why it must have been a religion. This character, in fact, remains in all the maxims of antique law. A Greek equivalent for the appellative of fellow-citizens was svcrirovSot, or people making vows or sacrifices to the same divinity. When- criminals were punished it was not for example, nor even for atonement, but as offerings to the gods; a sentiment explaining the famous usage of the ancient Gauls. It explains also an observation of Aristotle upon riper states, that they had no- criminal laws, but left the citizens to right themselves. For laws of this class suppose the notion of cross relations between the citizens, and refer also to exceptions, which are provided for hut later. The spontaneous, the regular, and religious juris¬ prudence lay in oracles and divination, declaring the divine will. It was a secret of the priests or the patricians, and thus sacred, and its forms were the acta legitima among the Romans. VOL. CXII. NO. CCXXVIII. BD</page><page sequence="8">392 Grotius and the Sources of Oct. Even in the rudimental international relations, first conceived by the Greek states, the religious character was paramount. These conventions were reducible to one or other of the three articles, of sepulture, sacrifice, or sanctuary ; and it is curious that, with a slight variation of designation, they concur with the foundations assigned by Vico to the Social state, although deduced by this Italian, not from Greek, but from Roman history. This philosopher has laid clown marriage instead of sanctuary or asylum. But the asylum was to the outcast what the family is to the young, and both of them were nurseries successively of the State. It was by means of asylums that cities were first founded, as witness the conspicuous example of Rome itself. The very council of the Amphictyons, the tribunal of the laws in ques¬ tion among the Greek communities, arose from an asylum. Its jurisdiction was accordingly almost entirely religious, extending but to cases of the categories specified. It viewed the leagued states but as votaries of Apollo; scarce at all as social bodies, political or federal. In fine, the philosophers themselves of the same nation, wherever they admitted the existence of a law of justice, continued to the last to connect itAvith theology, Aristotle being alone to hint the source of the ' common good.' The Romans, who succeeded, did but generalise the Deity, in proportion to the greater extent of their dominions. The phi¬ losophic Cicero was wont to say to Atticus, that he must decline arguing with him upon jurisprudence, unless he conceded the existence of a Providence. This premiss was his ' something ' eternal that rules the universe, a wisdom of commanding and of ' forbidding, peculiar to the immutable law of God.' So the often recited and eloquent description, preserved for this allusion by the piety of Lactantius, is based on the condition of a ' master ' and an emperor of all things, the Deity.' So, down to the greatest and the latest days of the Roman law, the Deity was its source, with the mere alias of the name nature. Thus the jus naturce has been defined by Ulpian to be ' that which ' Nature has taught to all animals' (omnia animalia) ; a modifi¬ cation imported from the Stoic philosophy, which contributed so much in all things to rationalise this jurisprudence. It was from the same source that the Roman jus gentium came like¬ wise to be viewed as the dictate of 'common reason'; thus ex¬ cluding recognition of all human enactment. For the Reason of the Stoics was not an attribute of personality, but a con¬ formity to Nature, and through nature to God. It may, how¬ ever, be remarked as a co-operative incident, that though the jus gentium began with Roman reason, or consisted in the uni¬ formity imposed on multifarious usages in practical adjudication</page><page sequence="9">1860. International Law. 393 between foreigners at Rome, yet that this passive and purely objective point of view of the arbiters had, of itself, a tendency to general equity, and largely, though spontaneously, reacted on the national laws, with which it came in this way to be finally embodied; thus submerging or ' ponding,' with the ex¬ panse of a noble lake, the rather crooked and covert rivulets in which it trickled from the Twelve Tables. This, in fact, is the true account of that preeminence of Roman law which is vul¬ garly ascribed to special qualities in the nation. It was a result of the place and of the part of this nation at a critical point in the career of social progress, as could be fully demon¬ strated were this the occasion. What we are here to note is, that the notion of this reason, as of that of the Stoic, in their identity with ideal justice, was founded, not in man or morality, but on nature; was a result of coincidence, not a bond of com¬ munity; was centripetal in obligation and positive in form ; was theological in source and territorial in circumscription. This, we say, was the progressive understanding of the law of nature throughout the ancient world, within the several social unions. But from union to union of family, city, nation, and even among the classes in the latter aggregations, there succeeded step by step another species of jus or law, disruptive of the former, centrifugal in tendency, — in short, the law of discord and contention termed Right. It is correlative and contrary to duty or obligation (which composed the law of nature) and is the germ of the Law of Nations. By observing this broad distinction we may dispense with the ' between,' about which writers have descanted as if it were some deep discovery. It was easier indeed to make the distinction in the name than to find it in the thing, which now discloses so well the reason. But yet this contrast between the Law of Nature and the Law of Nations left the source of both the systems to continue long the same; and the reason of this also is obvious from the premisses. For though the idea of rights was a reaction or revolt against the rule of physical nature represented by tradition, there could long have been imagined, to be substituted for the divine sanction, no new authority on the human side, as embracing the whole scheme of society. For paradoxical though it may seem, the march of rights as of liberty has been downwards from the state to the individuals, not the contrary. Thus the general divinity would have been slidden down from the presidence of nature to the patronage of each nation, without regard to or even con¬ sciousness of the self-contradictions in which they thus were placing him, both by their change and their diversity. This</page><page sequence="10">394 Grotius and the Sources of Oct. precisely is the sense in which the jus gentium was opposed by the Roman law to the jus naturale; a right belonging to nations, and not a right between them. For the individual nations could not think to back their rights by appealing to a sanction which was shared by the adversary. They could but oppose to it a counter divine right, adopting the old di¬ vinity, or inventing a new one, as their champion. And so it followed that the law of Nations, like that of Nature, was lon°- divine; a strife of gentilitial gods who absorbed each other gradually, till all were swept away by the advent of the Christian religion; which, as Tertullian said, made ' Romanity' a sort of synonym with Humanity. Let us briefly trace through history this secondary stratum of the ancient jurisprudence, in its mode and degree; for the degree is everything in these investigations, and the neglect of it the cause of most of the crudity on the subject. As in the primary jurisprudence all was settled by authority, the response of the god through the augur or the oracle, so in the extra-national or negative phase of justice, the arbiter at first must, of necessity, be force or war. The Deity there was Father, he is here an Avenger. Hence the continual warfare of these primitive communities, their reprisals, their duels vicariously for the Avhole army, of which the combat of the Horatii and Curiatii was an instance. For all this was considered as a sort of trial of justice, which must, for want of law, be decided by force. The law of nature was yet but religion even in the interior of each state, and the holy hatred of the hostile creeds suppressed all thought of it beyond. We saw that even among fellow-citizens, as testified by Aristotle, there were no laws in these communi¬ ties for the suppression of crime ; and for the reason that crime is an exceptional event, and thus a thing for which a regular provision was not conceivable; how much more natural was therefore such an absence among States For as the criminal department of the municipal law is in reality a species of war against the Avicked, so Avarfare was the criminal laAv among nations. This explains, for example, why the council of the Amphictyons looked on quietly while the confederates made Avar on one another, and could only interfere against a foreign in¬ vader. So in each of these Grecian cities, though united against an enemy, the oligarchies Avere accustomed, Ave are told by Aris¬ totle, to swear eternal hatred and hostility to the plebeians; for this arose from Avant of a common law of justice, made impos¬ sible by difference of religion, or gods and rites. Niebuhr compares the struggle of these classes at Rome to a warfare of ages between two distinct nations. It Avas, hoAvever, in this</page><page sequence="11">1860. International Laio. 395 highest or international expansion that the ancient law of nations took its primary character, as painted in the Avell-known formula of the pium purumque bellum. Thus hostility was at each step the first medium of inter¬ course between these several bodies, Avhether classes or com¬ munities. Hence in Latin the same Avord announced an enemy and a stranger. For the true reason Avas, that the things were identical; and not, as some explain, because the Romans were inhospitable, nor, as said by Cicero, because they Avere humane, and Avould mollify by metaphor the character of enemy. There was no derivation from either to the other; the name was given both of them simultaneously, because but one. Another inference is that Avarfare was a secondary state, and not the primordial, as imagined by Hobbes. The remark Avas made by Plato, Avho derived 7toXs/j,6s from iroXls, and concluded that the Avarfare Avas posterior to the city. But equally op¬ posed is the preceding exposition to those Avho speak of war as at all times ' unnatural.' It, on the contrary, Avas a natural because the necessary means of throAving together those primi¬ tive nuclei of social humanity. For the first tendency of all organic bodies Avhatever is to preserve their oavu integrity, and to this end repel each other; and as these tendencies are mutual, it Avas equally necessary that they came into collision and that force should decide. It is thus in fact that war Avas the basis of the Law of Nations, as Avas empirically noted by Hermogenianus (who by the way is quite misapprehended by Grotius), the rude substruction of right Avhich they still sink to in the last resort, until the progress of the edifice shall have submerged it for ever. The highest point to this effect which Avas attained by antiquity is found in the Jus Feciale of the Romans. And yet this institution has still the A'arious characters assigned to the incipient condition of the LaAV of Nations. It Avas religious in character, its functionaries being styled priests, their corporation a college, and itself, in short, a religion. In substance, it consisted not of principles or rules, but like the Avar it dealt with, in simple operation. With the usual fidelity of Latin etymology, this fact is represented in the name Feciale; Avhich, being from faciendo, meant a law that lies in action, in contradistinction from the passive law of Jus. An example is the mode in Avhich these functionaries declared war, by casting a spear into the enemy's territory. It may be further noted that, in this stage of Institution, the Law of Nations adhered to the parent state alone. The Jus Feciale Avas no more international than our oAvn Foreign Office might be termed European. The Fecial College, like the Foreign</page><page sequence="12">396 Grotius and the Sources of Oct. Office, Avas a place for transacting, not the common affairs of nations, but Roman business with relation to them. It sup¬ posed no reciprocity, Avhich alone constitutes a laAV-proper, and no such institution existed in fact elsewhere. In due con¬ formity to this condition, we shall find the Law of Nations advancing,'towards the close of the period in question, to a purer expression than the Roman Feciality; and doing so, like all beginnings, by occasion, not institution. But first, let us pass inwards to the strife of the classes, and note how far the law advanced within these narrower limits. Thus alone can we keep a due gauge of the progression. And this guidance is not only indispensable to steer us through the cleaA-age of those delicate historical laminations; it is also important as a proof and a pattern of Avhat we should expect to find repeated, on a larger scale, in the Christian or modern period, to which we come presently : for nature has but the same plan from first to last. In the more compact condition, then, of classes of the same community, this negative law of resistance, Right, and War took form earlier: for as the positive advances downwards from the whole to the parts, so the negate advances upAvards from the parts to the Avhole. It Avas embodied in a sort of Bill of Rights, consigned to language, of Avhich the Twelve Tables are a notable example. The divine legislator of the Hebrews employed also this expedient, in the venerable constitution now known as the Ten Commandments. Hence it is that most of the articles in both those charters were negative, that is to say inhibitive, belonging to criminal law. They were the famous EORMULiE actionis of 'the Romans, in opposition to their ACTA legitima of the religious laAV. But even as civic justice could be conceived at first but in the coarse material shape of those ceremonial acts, of Avhich the Fecial office too retained, Ave saAV, the character, so the advance before us went scarce beyond the words. There was no consideration, no conception of equity; the law was in the language, and in nothing beyond. Shylock is nowhere more a Hebrew of the Hebrews than when he in¬ sists upon the physical letter: ' I cannot see it; 'tis not in the ' bond.' A maxim of the Roman Jurisprudence to the last Avas, Dura lex, sed lex. It Avas a comment on the primitive laAV, the Twelve Tables, uti LINGUA nuncupassit ita jus esto. The rule Avas strictly adhered to in all the long interval. The qui cadit in literd, causa cadit, was never a dead letter in these ancient communities. At the noon of the Republic, all the eloquence of Crassus (the Demosthenes of Rome, as even Cicero could style him) was tasked to wrest the benefit of a law for the Plebeians, because this</page><page sequence="13">1860. International Law. 397 class Avas not contemplated in the ' form of action ;' and Cicero himself expended one of his greatest efforts in rescuing an estate from the flaw of a single letter. Though undermined progressively since the age of Cicero by the equity or judge- made laAV of the Prsetor, these formula? were fully and finally abolished but by a decree of the Emperor Constantine, Avho ordered, in the Christian spirit, that equity alone should rule. We beg attention to this fact, as decisive of the limits within which the LaAV of Nations was conceived in the Heathen period; as proving that it rested to the last on the ground of language, this semi-physical intermediary betAveen Nature and Humanity. This religio verborum, Avhich was thus the jurisprudence of classes disunited by the religion of common sacrifices, came in time to be extended to extra-national relations. It is the origin of treaties, by which regular Avar was terminated, and at Rome it fell of course into the Fecial jurisdiction. We must therefore look elseAvhere for the higher advance alluded to. This in fact is found in the incipient combinations of certain states of Greece, for the purpose of self-protection — thus advancing from the termination of war to its prevention. The notion is the dawn of a balance of powers, but was conceived in principle only by minds like Demosthenes. Moreover, at the best, it is still a state of warfare or tacit hostility, as the term Avell implies; a conflict of forces, not a concert of principles. Its office is to give the Law of Nations a rude skeleton, beneath Avhose shelter the civilising and subtler agencies of mind and commerce should promote the social intercourse and thus the equity of mankind. Hume, in his Essay on the Balance of Power, remarks it as strange that, notwithstanding the Greek commencements, the Romans had been suffered to conquer the world and Greece itself included, Avithout forming or encountering a single in¬ stance of these balances. But there, Avith his habitual facility, he leaves the difficulty. In truth, the fact is one of the most pregnant in history, and the course of these remarks conducts spontaneously to the cause. The Romans represented a third phase of public justice, which Avas destined to combine, to the end of harmonising, authority and liberty, obedience and rights, religion and Avarfare, the law of Nature and the law of Nations. Accordingly this statement characterises their Avhole history. It accounts for the confusion so much noted in their law of the jus naturale and the jus gentium, as for the rudimental view they had of both; their combination of patrician authority Avith democracy; their religious scrupulosity and their reckless inhu-</page><page sequence="14">398 Grotius and the Sources of Oct. manity; their perpetuity of warfare Avith their professions of peace. F\&gt;r it is known that with the Romans the end declared in all their conquests was the 'pacification' of the barbarian world. And such was undoubtedly their conscious intention. The Romans really Avarred to put down Avarfare. And as a consequence of this mission, they both avoided, themselves, the formation of balances Avhich by their strain keep up the spirit, and anticipated the resort to them by any of their enemies. And the expedient by Avhich they quite instinctively effected both, Avas the harmonising process of synthesis now explained, as the opposite of the antagonistic law of balances, and which is knoAvn familiarly as their system of alliances. But notAvithstanding the singularity of bestowing this sooth¬ ing title on the victims of conquest, and often of plunder and oppression, the Romans could but sketch this supreme form of the laAV of justice, Avhile a moiety of their own people was moreover kept in slavery. They thus were nearly destitute of the great element of humanity, and principally wrought on the co-factor of physical nature. Upon this basis, through the vast and varied expanse of their empire, their juridical inductions attained a noble generality. But they remained Avithout the spirit, the soul, the moral element, which it has been the glory of Christianity to introduce, and the advent of which forms a neAV epoch in our subject. This epoch consisted in the passage of the ground of laws from physical nature and divinity to spiritual nature and hu¬ manity, or investing the Divinity with human affections. The vieAV must here, in turn, be one-sided, like the former, against which it is in fact but the general revolt: for it is by oscillation between opposite excesses that the intellect as Avell as conduct are brought to settle toAvards the line of rectitude. Meanwhile, upon this human foundation of justice, there must also be a re¬ petition of the three stages above delineated, which are really but the modes of all methodical procedure. Their character in the neAV order, Avith relation to the source of justice, may therefore be respectively assigned in the corelatives of, Faith in¬ stead of sacrifice, Opinion instead of force, and the interests of Civilisation instead of mere ' pacification.' For the latter was but despotism, Avhile civilisation is peace with progress. The first of these periods, or that of Authority, was repre¬ sented by the Church of Rome. The priests were the Fathers, the patricians of the heathen epoch; but spiritual, like the obedience Avhich was paid them by the name of Faith. The Pope was the oracle inspired by the Divinity, the Conclave of</page><page sequence="15">1860. International Law. 399 Cardinals was but the Fecial College; the Councils, a mode of their Amphictyonic namesake, made itinerant to meet the vast extension of the jurisdiction; in fine, the Canon LaAV was the International jurisprudence. It is precisely what Bartolus, Avith a true Italian sympathy*-, distinguished as the Jus gentis fidelis. It threAV into neglect the Roman law proper, or left it but to draggle on its territorial ground. The Canon Law, or law of j^Faith, Avas the code of authority, not only between sovereigns, but even socially. It materially affected, if it did not embrace, all the relations of man, and may be said in one sense to have engendered the Feudal system itself. Accordingly, men finally revolted against it, and thus became the authors of a second jurisprudence, Avhich might be termed moral or human by pre-eminence. As in the former system all things descended from above, from the catholic summit of European society, so all, in the reaction, must spring from beloAV, from the individual conscience and its popular concurrence. This tendency of ages came at last to an issue in the grand democratic revolution of the Reformation. Democratic, that is, in the spiritual or moral sense; for politically, the effect was long confined to the sovereigns, of Avhom it liberated several hundreds from their homage to the German Empire — an empire also assuming to be Holy and Roman. Then ex¬ panded the conception of International Law, Avhich had been smothered in the aggregation of the previous despotism: for the Canon and the Civil Laws were as commixed in Christian Rome, as had been the Jus gentium and Jus natures in the Pagan. Another result of the liberation was the disorders, Avars, balances Avith all of which the reader has a sufficient acquaintance to perceive in them the primitive condition of the Greek com¬ munities, repeated on a vaster scale, and through the principle of Opinion. For this passage of the motive from plunder or con¬ quest to religious opinion was the character assigned the epoch. The ancients had never Avaged a Avar really religious, and could not have even conceived it: a proof is the fact of their pretended toleration, which sceptics have invidiously contrasted with the intolerance of Christians. What they called ' pious and holy' Avar Avas Avar conducted in due form, or according to the ritual of their acta legitima. On the contrary, in the modern religious wars, Avhat was sought was the triumph of a creed, an opinion: the force Avas a mere instrument, recurred to for Avant of a better, in aAvaiting the development of principles to back the sentiments. It is a body of such principles, the dictates of the common conscience,—not the dogmas of Theology nor the ab¬ stractions of Natural Justice,—that was to constitute the second</page><page sequence="16">400 Grotius and the Sources of Oct. Christian stage of public law, and which might perhaps be dis¬ tinguished as the Moral LaAV of Nations. In fine, as this Individual source of law or Right Avould, if left to run its course, end in destroying all society, just as the divine Rights of Kings and Clergy suppressed all liberty, there must arise a third system to harmonise the conflict, in some analogy to what was seen in the Alliance system of the Romans. The entrance on this form brings us up to the present times, and of Avhich we may return to say something before closing. For the moment we will but add what good readers must have anticipated, that even this stage cannot conduct the Law of Nations to perfection. This great subject, like all others, must proceed through a third circuit, intermediate to the opposite and extreme views of Man and Nature ; where, by excluding their excesses and combining their contributions, it Avill gain the universal and fully rational state called Science. This, however, we may leave to the care of the remote future, and merely note it to show in full the actual bearings of the subject. The Law, in this last period, Avould be Social or scientific—as it might, in the Christian society which Ave move in, be called Political, and in the primitive or Heathen, the national or Theocratic. Such is, through its Avhole career, the briefest sketch of the Law of Nations that seemed at all consistent Avith distinct characterisation. Let us now, with still more brevity, examine if the authors who have advanced the science, be conformable to this programme. They will thus have been defined by their mere place along the scale, until we come to meet with Grotius, the main object of inquiry. The first or Heathen period produced no writer on the Law of Nations, and for the best of reasons,— that no such law was known. The reason might scarce hold, indeed, of modern times, when people have the faculty of Avriting without know¬ ledge. But they do so through the past accumulation of materials, and a confusion that conceals ignorance from the public, and even themselves. The ancient situation Avas with both entirely opposite. There were comparatively few Avriters, and the readers Avere select, and the subjects must be drawn, not from the bookshelf, but from nature. There the subject sought the author, not the author the subject. But the merely pragmatical commencements of the LaAV of Nations which we nave, by the light of the later developments, been able to retrace through Grasco-Roman civilisation, Avere not yet prominent enough to press themselves upon contemporary intellect. Ac-</page><page sequence="17">1860. International Law. 401 cordingly Aristotle, who encyclopedized the epoch, never really attained to the idea of this law. The supposition that he had written on it rested on the verbal error of iro\\pxov for iroXsav — or wars for cities; in the title of his lost treatise on political constitutions. The work referred to was, in fact, the highest conception of the ancient world—a comparative anatomy of all the polities then known. But the point of contemplation was political or national. The various constitutions were con¬ ceived as organisms which might indeed concur, like fish and man in fin and hand, but had, no more than these two creatures, any objective law of community. Cicero, Avho aped him as a summist of Roman politics, could never even here transcend the same Greek limits; all his periods about natural and rational law or justice revolve on mere concurrence, and never reach connexion. And the reason of this curious mental impotence is now plain. It was above seen that the ancient point of view of social bodies was from Avithout inwards, or what Ave called centripetal. The effort was to Avin men from the Avild of barbarism, and shut them in from all communication Avith those beyond. Hence the City, which in those times meant Avhat is now named the State, was habitually commenced with the wall of enclosure: and so essential seemed this wall that it passed by synecdoche in both the classic languages, to signify the city. In our own day, in the wilds of Australia and America, the settlement commences Avith a surrounding fence; it is only long after that the individual settlements, or the villages they grow to, turn their attention outward, and think of making roads to join the different and distant groups. Yet the men in this predicament possess the idea of roads, Avhereas the primitive pioneers had to grope their way for ages of Avar and mutual plunder, till commerce taught the use of them: these roads give a rude image of International laws. In fine, the nature that Avorks in this form through primitive man, com¬ mences all her organisms on just the same plan. The embry¬ onic matter of the animal or plant is first enclosed by a membrane, as is familiar in the egg. Of this the use is not alone to protect from things external, but chiefly to supply to the internal fermentation a circumambient fulcrum to keep it in due position. Nay, the parts of this interior organism are formed separately ; they are seen to throw out gradually threads or filaments to each other, and, finally, cohere into the shape of the body natural, precisely as delineated in the embryo of the body social. This analogy explains, moreover, the absence of Criminal law in the ancient communities, while the Political was</page><page sequence="18">402 Grotius and the Sources of Oct. so elaborate. The latter is the mere shell and husk of society; the former interpenetrates the body of the organism; it supervenes on the constitution, as the protective complement that keeps the embryonic elements from mere congestion, and adjusts them to the flexibility which combines unity and freedom. And as the Law of Nations Avas shown to be the same, but elevated from the parts of a single state to a group of several, we may conceive hoAv fully normal is the' absence of ancient writers. The ancient statesmen and philosophers might therefore be contemplated as placed upon those insulated segments of the social embryo, each working tOAvards the centre of his own civic system, and brought in contact with other states but by the consequence of expansion. The writings of Plato are a study in this light, where he labours to envelope his model Republic Avith all the tortuous fences of mystic numbers and geometry, Avithout a thought of other States, unless to shut them off more surely. But eyes or intel¬ lects however powerful, cannot see Avhere they are not looking, and especially Avhen looking in the opposite direction. The Christian epoch, then, supplies the earliest Avriters on the LaAV of Nations. They were, in the first or theological di¬ vision, the Canonists and Casuists, of Avhich Aquinas Avas an example. These were succeeded by the great Italian Jurists, Avho rose Avith the universities of Bologna, Pisa, and Florence. Both revivals were a consequence of the establishment of the Free Cities, and the secularisation of the principles of government, recalling the Civil laAV into ascendance above the Canon. But the Roman laAV had little that was really International, and even that little Avas already quite amalgamated Avith the Civil. Accordingly, these rude Professors wrote nothing on the LaAV of Nations. As knowing any law in those days, they Avere chosen for ambassadors; which is, by the Avay, Avhat obtained them so much consequence: but the rules of their official conduct were from the Civil LaAV. And even in this, their immense treatises Avere utterly Avithout method. The Avriters, for the most part, Avere interpreters, or giossists. They Avere properly enough comprised in the class of artists—understanding by this term the useful, not the fine—in the cataloguing of the trades throughout the Italian cities : for the Italians, like their ances¬ tors, viewed all things as art or trade. The sole Italian Avriter of those times on the LaAV of Nations Avas Albericus Gentilis, Avho belongs as much to England; and Avho, moreover, when he passes from the precincts of the Roman laAV,Ogives but a mere ritual of Avhat his predecessors practised. His work might have been compiled from the records of the Fecial College; although Grotius, Avith some finesse, parades acknowledgments to his</page><page sequence="19">1860. International Law. 403 ' diligence,' Avhile he never mentions Suarez, from Avhom he derived something different. The lineal successors of the Canonists on International sub¬ jects, are the Spaniards Victoria, Vasquez, Soto, and others; and in the practical order, Balthazar Ayala, Avhose treatise led the Avay for the Italian just mentioned. In fact, Spain was the great conquering power of that epoch, and consequently the most merged in international relations; a concurrence which suggests the influence of history upon intellect. This priority of the Spaniards upon the LaAV of Nations is, Avith his usual candour, recognised by Mr. Hallam, Avho says that ' Spain ' appears to have been the country in which the subject Avas 'originally [first] discussed upon principles broader than pre- 'cedents:' he does not mean that 'precedents' are principles, hut only grounds from which they are evolved. These Spaniards, as a class, may be distinguished by the name Scholastic. Dialectics and construction are their features of originality. They show a tendency, by these bands, to com¬ bine the tAvo epochs of Heathen philosophy and of Christian legislation, the Jus natura of the Stoics, and the Jus canonicum of the Catholics. By this conjunction they transcend all prede¬ cessors of either order. Take, for instance, Dominic Soto's definition of Law, in his treatise entitled De Justitia et Jure: ' Law is a certain ordinance and prescription of reason, pro- • ' mulged for the common good, by the power that governs the ' State.' Lex est qvcedam rationis ordinatio et prceceptio in com¬ mune bonum, ab eo qui curam reipublicoz gerit, promulgata. Thus, then, here is an ' ordinance,' a systematical arrangement, and not a mere enactment, as commonly accounted. It is an ordinance of ' reason,' and not of volition. It is prescribed, not, as with Blackstone, by a ' superior to inferiors,' Avhich Avould scarcely include the Demos of Athens, Paris, or America, but by the power which governs, whatever that may be. And the law must, in fine, be for the ' common good.' And so fully and firmly was all this conceived, that the author expounds, in the true scholastic fashion, and to the purport indicated, every term of the definition with exhaustive completeness, yet a conciseness truly admirable. For instance, on the article of reason and will he has a special chapter, bearing this title:—Utrum lex intellectus sit, an voluntatis, actus Whether law be an act of intellect or of volition? The decision is triumphantly for intellect or reason. The will can originate, he shows, but single acts; whereas law is essentially a permanent relation, and in case of that of Nations, lying in nature itself. We may add, as a worthy practical comment on this noble doctrine, that this</page><page sequence="20">404 Grotius and the Sources of Oct. great ecclesiastic of the sixteenth century, all Spaniard though he was and monk to boot, declared against his own countrymen in favour of the Indians, and this on the ground of their international or natural equality. The Spanish school of Jurists attained its climax in a Jesuit, the admirable Suarez, in his treatise ' On Laws.' Nothing, for that age or any age upon the subject, can compare with the large and luminous arrangement of this work. It is a species of Alhambra in logical architecture. The fundamental prin¬ ciples are also still as noted. The Greek philosophers, and, far above them all, Aristotle, are constantly cited — not for testi¬ mony but authority -— side by side with the Canonists, the Fathers, the Gospel. God, indeed, is made the source and the sanction of all laAV. But yet the laAV of nature is independent of his will. He cannot alter it, because he cannot contradict himself. The author, however, adds a quibble, to save the miracles, for want of noting the distinction established by Soto between intellect and Avill, although he formally confirms it. For will cannot possibly be self-contradictory, as being com¬ posed of insulated incoherent acts, of which each is independent, and the latest always paramount. Self-contradiction implies reason, that is to say, a rule. Suarez, Avho subscribes to this, is guilty then of subterfuge. He reasserts the doctrine respecting the human conscience, which is also but a particular mode of volition. It can do nothing, he insists, to affect the Law of Nature (lib. ii. 9.), including, we must suppose, the moral department. Here is the conclusion philosophically logical, Avhich has made Spain the stronghold of the Holy Inquisition. For the right of will or conscience is the right of contradiction — contradiction of all authority, including its OAvn. This right of independence or individuality, in opposition to the right of collectivity or catholicity, is the Reform which found its issue and its organ in the German nations. It is the deeper moral side of the religious revolution. From religion the new principle advanced forthwith to Public law. Some two or three writers, clearly German, preluded in the subject, but, so feebly, as Avas natural, that they Avere soon forgotten. The move¬ ment found its Luther in Hugo de Groote; a citizen of a State Avhich commerce, industry, and liberty—and more than all, the influx of philosophic foreigners—had made at that time in¬ tellectual head of the German people. That this is the solution of that immense vogue of Grotius which his critics and disciples have sought so long and vainly, the former to explain aAvay, the others to justify, we now</page><page sequence="21">1860. ' International Law. 405 .proceed to fortify from the Avork itself. This detail is made necessary by the nature of the composition, and will, moreover, be a proper tribute to the failure of former labourers. The treatise of Grotius is quite devoid of frame, or Avhat we might describe as an osseous system. In all the soft and minor parts of flesh and floridity, the texture and the tone are very nearly unexceptionable: the terms are well chosen, the construction is natural, the expression clear, easy, even elegant, within each period. But when you contemplate the whole it darkens to a mere mass; sound, undoubtedly, and substan¬ tial, and Avith a garniture of classic literature, but still re¬ minding you of a Dutch burgomaster, all fat, furs, and frills. Quite the opposite in this also, as well as in the prin¬ ciple, to the gaunt yet not ungraceful organisation of the Avork of Suarez. But this defect itself is a mark of his mission, a consequence of the amalgamations of transition. Another source of the deformity is the procedure of analysis, which is the method proper to this personal point of view, and which works by dissolution, and not by construction. The confusion and procedure was well remarked by Mackintosh, who speaks of Grotius as ' examining original principles only occasionally 'and incidentally, as they grow out of the questions he is to ' decide.' This he styles ' a disorderly method, Avhich exhibits 'the elements of the science in the form of scattered discussions.' But the principles really 'original' of Grotius—those Avhich made his work an era and himself a man of genius — escaped the discernment of Mackintosh, as of the rest. The objective prin¬ ciples intended Avere all borroAved, or were treated by Grotius on the footing of mere precedents. And his ' disorderly method' proceeded precisely from the effort to conciliate those hetero¬ geneous principles with his own point of view, Avhich Avas the opposite and individual. The question is, then, to make this clear by illustration, and by examples detached from the main aspects of the treatise On War and Peace. And, first, as to the method. The innovation, of Avhich the blemishes of composition are marks, must have worked, as has been said, by the process of analysis. It thus moved backwards from the multitude of parts to the Avhole; or, in the terms of the case, from the individual Avill, to the general, presented by the Church as the will of God. But this pretension being re¬ jected, and its subversion the very object, some other generality must be procured to substitute it. Otherwise the innovator could not move a step, as without a goal to guide him, or even a rule of judgment; for nothing can be viewed as parts or proofs save with relation, the former to a whole, and the others</page><page sequence="22">406 Grotius and the Sources of Oct. to a principle. This principle or whole, therefore, Grotius must assume; and he could have found or fancied it but in the concourse of human wills. Hence the store which he sets by the incessant citation of writers of all sorts and sects, Avithout distinction: for him it was enough that they Avere human. Meanwhile, although the fallacy of this circular reasoning — or setting up a principle imagined from the cases, and citing then the cases in proof of the principle — be easily detected in a speculative argument, yet, when relating to a long and large tract of human history, it may escape for ages the most poAverful of comprehensions. This is the apology of all the failures above alluded to ; and, first of all, of Grotius's own in¬ congruities. In fact, the innovator always makes a fallacious compromise, to shield his new hypothesis by the sanction of the received doctrine. Thus, while Grotius passed the source of International Law from the dogmas of theology to the dictates of conscience, he keeps the Deity as common origin of the con¬ flicting sources. Again (lib. i. 2. § v.), he makes the jus natures —including human nature, at least elsewhere, if not also there— to resist the Divine will; and yet he accepts the same Avill as the source of both. For although the law in question proceeds naturally from man — ex principiis homini internis, these prin¬ ciples themselves had been implanted by God. In short, so wholly Avas the mind of Grotius controlled by these double measures, that they passed, as is known, into his practical life, in some attempts to reconcile the Reformation Avith the Church. Starting, then, from this hypothesis of a primordial law im¬ planted by the Deity in the minds of all mankind, our author opens his preliminaries by engaging Avith Carneades, who took the ancient and inductive vieAV of judging from the facts. These facts reported that the men of different countries, classes, ages, differed all from one another in their sentiments respecting justice, and as Avidely as the lower animals diverge in their special instincts; from which the sceptic concluded that there could be no fixed standard, and that their conduct was simply the dictate of utility. Grotius replies, with characteristic logic, that man is an animal peculiar in kind; that he is endowed Avith a social instinct (oiKsimais); that children are disposed to serve and pity suffering children. We can imagine the smile of something not remote from pity with which the dialectical athlete of antiquity would have, on hearing such an argument, regarded his kind antagonist. The thing is indeed both super¬ ficial and evasory. That the mere individual of the lowest human races does not differ disproportionately from the highest animals, is the evident conclusion of natural science. The</page><page sequence="23">1860. International Late. 407 disparity which strikes us in the case of civilised man is, in its positive character, a result of society, and then is negatively aggravated by the common oversight of the historic series that graduates the junction. Grotius carries back to this primitive or savage stage the attributes of justice acquired by hi3 own mind. Moreover, granting his assumption, it Avould not answer Carneades, Avhose position Avas founded chiefly on the human species socialised, and who alluded to the animals but as extension or illustration. Then again, the ' social instinct' is, per contra, found in brutes, and Grotius himself dilates upon the topic. From this blunder he escapes but by another assumption, to Avit, that the said instinct proceeds, in the brutes, ex principio aliquo intelligente extrinseco. In fine, the good or the pity shown by children to each other might more naturally be referred to the ab¬ sence of all reflection, and the tendency to lend their OAvn feelings to their like. That he who pities another thinks upon himself, has been asserted of a much less unsophisticated age. Do children ever incommode themselves to serve others So that Ave fear our kindly Dutchman could have made a poor resistance to the terrible polemic who astounded the stolid Romans. We regret also that Dr. Whewell, a commentator upon Bacon, instead of rectifying these blunders, commits an aggra¬ vation. He mistranslates Grotius' rendering of oikeiosis, by calling it ' the domestic instinct or feeling of kindred.' This is quite the contrary of even the verbal meaning, and what is still Avorse it goes counter to the argument. The Avord 'domestic' or private means the opposite to sociable; and the discerning comment of the text of Grotius—cum his qui sui sunt generis— does not relate to 'kindred,' but to kind, to mankind; in distinction from the animals of Avhich he Avas just speaking. Moreover, the Greek term should have cautioned the translator. Its termination is a metaphorical form denoting like. The literal rendering is therefore ' domestic-like'; or having a good Avill towards all mankind, like that Avhich is entertained towards one's family, and which is shared by the lower animals. But to return to Grotius, in Avhom it Avas no modesty to OAvn that he thus founded his doctrine rudi modo. He defines his theme of Justice in a manner scarce less clumsy, to consist in leaving, or in rendering, to others that Avhich is their OAvn; quce jam sunt alterius alteri permittantvr aut impleantur. The question Avas, By Avhat title it came to be ' their own ' Or hoAV the term property can have at all a meaning, Avithout a pre-existent law of justice to constitute it? This accordingly was tacitly assumed by the author, in the manner above stated to characterise his system. Civil rights he derives likewise from VOL. CXII. NO. CCXXVIII. E E</page><page sequence="24">408 Grotius and the Sources of Oct. this supposed mutual compact; and his sanction for the source is, that'some mode of obliging themselves Avas necessary among ' men, and no other could be found.' But Avhere was then the natural and innate laAV of justice And where, again, Avas the volitional virtue of the compact, if it has been in any Avay a result of' necessity' Much less immoral assuredly than this would be the principle of Utility Avhich Grotius so repudiates. He opposes to it human nature ' as the mother of Natural laAvs, and obligation by compact ' as the mother of Civil laws '; though he had just renounced or subordinated both these ' mothers.' The present statement is however right enough in itself, if considered from the special point of vieAV of the author; indeed it quite precisely delineates his innovation, Avhich lies in really founding all law on moral man. But this point of view is not exclusive of utility, Avhich rather indeed includes it as being opposite and general. The reason Avhy Grotius and the epoch he introduces are rhetorically so severe upon the test of utility, is simply that they saw it from the individual side. Here it certainly is ' vicious,' for each person seeks his OAvn. But then it is not utility, in a con¬ sistent sense, as the individuals all must judge it differently from each other. The term can be proper but in reference to wholes, as in the formula of Bentham, the greatest good of the greatest number ; and here it always coincides Avith the just and true as Avell as good. Thus it Avas the declared principle of Government with the ancients, Avhose conception of the State was collective, not partitive; in modern times, Avhen the society is considered through the multitude, or in its moral elements, the Avord utility comes to shock. Accordingly Grotius is, after all, obliged to recognise it as the source of International law (Prolog. 17.) He even admits that it may sanction all laws; but that Ave feel ourselves led to them ' by nature ' Avithout it. How, again, Avithout it, could even nature lead us But there is no rigorous reasoning Avith Grotius, and our object is, beside, not correction, but characterisation. To the same character belongs his habitual confusion of the ancient Jus Avith Jura or Rights in the modern sense. The former was a relation between subject and object. But rights are affected to subjects alone; they are held to exist independently of objects. In short, they are metaphysical or ' moral entities,' and have been so termed and treated by Puffen- dorf, who ran them out instructively to some of their absurdities. This consequence may also be exhibited directly in the case of Avhat Grotius calls the Rights of War. For Avar has no rights in the sense of Jus. Silent Jura inter arma. The rules imposed</page><page sequence="25">1860. International Law. 409 upon it are rules or rights against it, supervening from the positive order of justice. War is strictly the negation of this justice by appeal to force; a degradation from the social and the rational sphere, of Avhich alone the very idea of justice is predicable, to the brute contention of physical force. Here the subject and the object are clashed into collision, and, ipso facto, annihilate all social relation. Grotius himself repeats, after Aristotle, that war is alloAvable but on failure of justice. How then is Avar to retain rights after justice is gone The conclusion is that Grotius Avas too much absorbed in his own view of rights, to attend to the discrepancy. That vieAV is the personal or subject matter of the Jus; and its useful destination in nature or history is to batter down the opposite and despotic reign of Duties. These had previously their epoch of existence Avithout Rights; they so exist in Asia, generally, to this day; in America, with respect to the slave population; in Europe itself, as a Christian community: for none of us pretend to have rights against God, but only duties toAvards him. But betAveen these extreme views lies the ratio called Justice. Hence, again, it is that Grotius criticises Aristotle on the subject of his principle of ethics, the golden mean. Admitting it in most things, he opposes it in others. He takes exception to Boasting and Dissimulation being assigned as the extremes to Avhich Truth is the middle; they being, he alleges, not ' co- ' ordinate' with it. But he judges from the popular and super¬ ficial sentiment: the terms are co-ordinate, if properly inter preted, as meaning truth exaggerated and truth curtailed. The competency of Grotius as a critic upon Aristotle is further betrayed upon another conception, although a less com¬ plete one, of that sovereign intellect. We allude to the famous division of Justice into Commutative and Distributive. These the author illustrated by comparing them respectively Avith arith¬ metical and geometrical proportions ; the former proceeding by strict equality, the other by analogy or equality of relations: the one affected to the civil order, the other to the political. Grotius adopts both the principle and illustration, but, as usual, makes no scruple in finding exceptions; and in this Ave must allow that he is sanctioned by the translator, himself a volumi¬ nous Avriter on these subjects. ' If (objects Grotius) there be 'but one person fit for a political office, it is by commutative ' [not distributive] justice that it is given him.' Thus he imagines that a general principle may be set aside by his mere hypothetical ' if ; the hypothesis being here, moreover, effectu¬ ally absurd. For it scarcely could happen that only one person in a political community Avas fit for a normal office; and at all</page><page sequence="26">410 Grotius and the Sources of Oct. events the fitness must be of course relative, and thus in ana¬ logical proportion to the demand. Thus, the 'fitness' is em¬ ployed to disprove its own import. We do not say of the commutative or arithmetical justice, for example, a debt, that the payment is 'fit,' but absolutely that it is just: the com¬ parative ability of the debtor is not considered. On the other hand, the claimant of distributive justice Avould, hoAvever ex¬ clusively and eminently ' fit,' be never said to have a like title to the office. He Avould bo laughed at if he laid it before a court of justice — as he generally is indeed in even the court of politics. But Grotius, as usual, saw the person, not the pro¬ portion. And from this subjective point of vieAV the graduation disappears — as in the interval alluded to betAvecn the savage and the citizen — by an illusion to which half the errors of our philosophers are traceable. It may be proper to subjoin a Avord or two of explanation respecting the incompleteness of this doctrine, Avhich natu¬ rally escaped Grotius, while he quarrelled with Avhat is fault¬ less. The tAVO ' proportions' of Aristotle are contraries to one another: the first, the principle of order; the second, that of progress. By consequence, their tendency is to destroy each other; of which an illustration must be familiar to British readers in the theory of Malthus, which is an application of them. The conflict, however, produces a third form, to combine and conciliate them, Avhich is organisation; and Avhich Avill doubtless redeem us from the predictions of Malthus. It was indicated first by Bodin, in his Republic, and named Avith full propriety the ' Harmonic' proportion. He thus supplied the ' middle term' of Aristotle's oavii system, which the analytic bent of this philosopher often missed. In fine, a last criterion of the theory of Grotius, as moral, hypothetical, analytic, self-contradictory, is less unnoticed, because more obvious than the preceding, by the commentators. All have clamoured at his sanctioning slavery and despotism. By some, such as Rousseau, imrectives the most bitter have been poured upon a man of independence and deep humanity, for want of seeing the nature of his doctrine and its conse¬ quences. The right to rule absolutely being regarded as an entity inherent in the person of the ruler alone, and therefore transferable by him alone to a successor; what is more logical in the one case than passive obedience, and in the other, than the patrimonial sovereignties of Grotius So Avith slavery: it may be argued, that if every man be born Avith ' natural rights,' of Avhich of course the first must be that to his own person, you cannot deny him the right of self-forfeiture or alienation,</page><page sequence="27">1860. International Law. 411 and consequently the essential legitimacy _ of slavery, sup¬ posing the slave to have used his liberty of action to divest himself of liberty. The fault of Grotius in this instance — but one he rarely commits — is the rigorous adherence to the con¬ sequences of his principles. The sole escape from them is by setting them against one another. Thus, if man has a ' right' to dispose of his own person he has an equal ' right' to undo that disposition ; for both are acts of will, of Avhich this liberty is the essence. He cannot then bind himself to slavery. But he is equally poAverless Avith regard to all contracts. Hence the salvo of 'necessity' above brought in by Grotius to give some fixity of ground to the shifting sands of compact. And all for Avant of seeing that laws of all sorts and justice itself proceed, not from the individual, but directly from society, and are good or bad, right or wrong, not absolutely in themselves, but with relation to the character and civilisation of the nation. The great epochal revolution in international law, of Avhich the principle has thus been verified through the main features of the Avork of Grotius, has been noticed by several British Avriters, though but empirically. The second set of Stewart's objections was made to the hypothesis of a prassocial system of justice or compact. But had he seen that the method of Grotius Avas analytic, he might have recognised that the pro¬ cedure Avas legitimate, howeA'er erroneous the conception of its principle. The use of such a fiction as a fulcrum of explo¬ ration Avas not marred for the time by false belief in its reality. Hallam, who replies that Grotius did not hold it, Avas mistaken through a like misapprehension of him. He, however, seizes the positive aspect, in pronouncing that ' ethical speculations are in fact the real subject of the book, 'since it avowedly treats of obligations on the conscience of 'mankind and of their rulers.'* Mackintosh, Avith still more specific discernment, gives it the singular title of 'private ethics' f, meaning, no doubt, the ethics of the individual; and remarks that it resulted 'from classing o(in a manner Avhich seams 'peculiar to modern times) the duties of individuals with those ' of nations.' But whence this ' classing' came, or Avhither it tended, or Avhether Avrong or right, he does not say or see. Yet this has been the closest approach, perhaps, ever made to a precise distinction of the spirit of the Avork of Grotius. Except, however, the heretical sagacity of Rome, Avhich had long before placed it in the limbo of its Index. And in fine, * Lit. Eur., vol. ii. p. 586. T Dis. Law of Nat. and Nations, p. 4.</page><page sequence="28">412 Grotius and the Sources of Oct. lest an assertion so sweeping should seem presumptuous, Ave add the decision of the learned Von Ompteda, in his excellent survey of the writings on the Law of Nations: ' Indeed,' says he, ' it is almost inconceivable, but nevertheless true, that ' among the prodigious crowd of commentators and translators ' who have dissected, investigated, and illustrated his Avork, not ' a single writer has contemplated the subject in the precise ' point of view in Avhich Grotius conceived it, or judged cor- 'rectly of his design.' And this author's OAvn effort, though better far than most of them, may now be perceived not to escape the condemnation. We have thus, as far as possible within a few pages, sought to circumscribe the place and characterise the features, historical, moral, and internationally Jural, of the great Avork of Grotius in the march of the subject; and to that end have also sketched a general chart of the progression. The result has been to dis¬ cover that the revolution Avrought by him consisted in trans¬ ferring the chief ground of the Laws of Nations, from the ancient, theocratic, and territorial basis,—somewhat mitigated by the family humanity of Catholicity,—to the Protestant and personal ground of the human will. Hence the term jus gentium voluntarium, Avhich Grotius had been the first to introduce, and Avhich marks throughout his chaos of quotation and adoption, the neAV vein of inspiration that gave him value and vitality. The other titles sometimes classed Avith it, as the conventional and consuetudinal, are to be understood as but species of the voluntary. All these proceed, as has been noted by Wolff, from volition or consent in different forms; ' pre- ' sumed' in the volential, ' express' in the conventional, and ' tacit' in the consuetudinal. So that the explanation embraces the Avhole ground of what is sometimes designated as the modern LaAV of Nations. And so trenchantly does all this appertain to Grotius, that the gradual approaches Avhich led to the change, in the usual Avay of Nature Avho does nothing great abruptly, were by the Spanish Jurists&lt; immediately preceding him distin¬ guished by the name d?jus gentium secundarium. The volun¬ tarium could not, in fact, be used by the Spaniards, of whom the two ablest, Soto and Suarez, Avere seen to have con¬ tended, that the human will can furnish a foundation for nothing like laAV. The Avorking of this new vein Ave now proceed to indicate along to the present state; and this must also react in confirmation of the acquired results, Avhile completing the his¬ torical survey of the subject, and thereby directing its ulterior cultivation.</page><page sequence="29">1860. International Laic. -413 And here a fact presents itself which, as a strict consequence from what has been determined of the doctrine of Grotius, we feel tempted to call a still greater discovery. It is, that all the Avriters since Grotius, on the LaAV of Nations, and assuredly their ' name is legion,' have been, Avithout a single original ex¬ ception, either Germans or generally of the Teutonic race. How was this peculiarity to be hitherto conceived The Germans are a people of no foreign intercourse, and no domestic stimulus from politics or public life; and the diplomacy of their crowd of little courts amongst themselves is scarcely graver than that of the tribes of their ancestors: what then should lead their Avriters to agitate the 'LaAvs of Nations?' They agitate, it is quite true, most things upon earth, and in the heavens above, and in the waters under the earth. But then some other nations partake Avith them here. They are great metaphysicians, but so are the Scotch; the French also have metaphysicians, acute but superficial; the Hindoos are metaphy¬ sicians, if Ave credit their translators. But no nation outside of the Germanic family has yet produced an original Avriter on the Law of Nations. Is it then that this law, as now resolved to its true principles—a law of personality, resistance, Avill, and warfare — has anything peculiarly congenial to this people Committing this conclusion or question to the reader, Ave pass on to the principal successors of Grotius. The first of these successors in time and perhaps .mind, and therefore probably no debtor to the Hollander, Avas Hobbes. Grotius began Avith the rights of war: and this was in fact the right beginning of the Law of Nations, and the source, as we have shown, of his inspiration and originality. But the Aveight of his learning and the prestige of the authority from which he had but half escaped, forthwith reversed the order, and SAvayed him practically to give precedence to the rights of peace and nature, to which the warfare Avas exceptional and as a means to an end. Hobbes began in the same Avay, but kept consistently to the order. The international relations Avere but fear, force, Avarfare, and nations were identical in this respect to indivi¬ duals. Wherefore, the primitive and natural state was war. And force, by consequence, is the source of all authority, law, and right. Thus, by a logical sequence the most regular and ri¬ gorous, he annihilated all justice, nay, morality itself, by adher¬ ing to the individual jus of Grotius. For morality, as a rule, is not a property of individuals, whether personal or national, but really of society. The consistency of Hobbes — Avhich thus supplies the best of comments upon Avhat we have been hinting of the dangers of this principle — was, accordingly, too shocking</page><page sequence="30">414 Grotius and the Sources of Oct. to allow of his finding any speculative followers among his OAvn countrymen, The ' social compact' of Locke Avas a mild and municipal form of it. Puffendorf, proceeding avowedly upon Grotius, consolidated the perversion, but clouded it Avith ' moral entities.' He took the practical arrangement of the master for his guidance, be¬ ginning Avith the Law of Nature and passing to the Law of Nations. But instead of seeing the normal antagonism be¬ tween these sources, he made the latter but a simple extension of the former; or more really perhaps, the jus naturae of the ancients, a reflection of the jus gentium VOLUNTARIUM of Grotius. The result was a reinforcement of lawless volition, by the natural sanction of animal utility. Next succeeded, in the genuine or Germanic line, a reactive rec¬ tification, in the system of Wolff. This description may be proved by a single and a short extract. The author declares formally as motive to his work : OMNIUM fere animos occupavit perversa ilia opinio, quasi fons juris gentium sit UTILITAS propria ; inde contingit. id rOTENTLE COiEQUARl. Damnamus hoc in privatis, et in rectore civitatis. Wolff then detached the Law of Nature from that of Nations; and this, in turn, he dissevered from the law of individuals, with Avhich it Avas confounded by his predecessors since Hobbes and Grotius. The highest expression of this oscillation is to be found in Kant and his followers. Yet Dr. Whewell cites approvingly a late German Avriter, Avho sets the manner of these philosophers, in ' basing Rights upon the insulated existence of the individual,' in contrast Avith that of Grotius, who ' placed them on the social ' relations.'* Grotius professed indeed to base them on society; but his real basis was, as shoAvn, the socialised individuals. His main argument Avas draAvn from ' feelings' of bounty and pity; but feelings, even though facts, Avould still be far from ' rela- ' tions.' Fichte, then, himself, the ' extreme left' of this school of jurists avhose ' perpetual hammering on the innate freedom ' of the indiA'idual' is denounced by Dr. WheAvell Avith a credit¬ able instinct, is the quite natural development of the doctrine of Grotius, to which the Doctor yields his deliberate applause. Th,e succession brings us next to a Doctor of LaAvs, a fellow countrymen also, as Ave must be glad to claim him. But is the succession a progression It certainly is with regard to the Germans, at least if Ave may judge by the practical utility of their Avritings. The thinking may be slighter, the discussion less exhaustive, the arrangement as lax, and the * Pref. vi.</page><page sequence="31">1860. International Law. 415 learning not so genuine; but the principles are sounder and the purposes more practical. It is not easy to characterise the Avork of Dr. Phillimore, even Avith the new aid of the gauging scale avc have endeavoured to delineate. One can hardly say to Avhat school to refer it; whether it should be the modern, the mediasval, or even the an¬ cient ; but it is certain it does not form a school or scheme of its own. The best indication that perhaps can be given is the choice Avhich he makes among the principal sanctions, succes¬ sively assigned by mankind to the laws in question, as unfolded in the foregoing historical progression. In the most formal of his vague statements on this cardinal point, the author tells us, that ' states are governed partly by Divine and partly by Posi- ' tive laAV. The Divine is either that Avhich is Avritten by the 'finger* of God on the heart of man, when it is called Natural ' laAV ; or that which has been miraculously made known to him, ' when it is called revealed or Christian law. The primary ' source of International Jurisprudence then is Divine laAV.' (Vol. i. p. 15.) This, it is perceived, is far enough from Grotius, who made the prime source independent of God and Providence. It retrogrades beyond the Spanish Jesuit Suarez, and Avould have been accepted by the canonists of the tenth centuiy, or as a motto to the Extravagances of Pope John XXII. Yet our. author, moreover, at the same time dismisses the very Chosen people of this his Divine law, with merely the remark, that ' the peculiar dispensation under which the Jewish nation was ' placed, &amp;c, renders vain any attempt to trace in the history ' of that people the vestiges of International Jurisprudence.' Selden, however, found it bodily Avith that people. Again, morality as Avell as International law is transferred from the German and human basis to the Romish. ' Just' (says the author) ' as it is not morally competent to any indi- ' vidual state to make laAvs Avhich are at variance with the law ' of God, Avhether natural or revealed, so neither is it morally ' competent to any assemblage of states to make treaties or ' adopt customs which contravene that laAV.' (Vol. i. p. 26.) Very good But Avhat is that law or which of its interpre¬ tations? It Avas the maxim by which Hildebrand aspired to rule the globe. One is prompted irresistibly to ask the like questions, in reading Avhat Avas meant for a definition of the subject. ' The * A particularity of Anthropomorphism Avhich might have been dispensed Avith in a definition of science.</page><page sequence="32">416 Grotius and the Sources of Oct. ' Law of Nations is said to be founded upon justice, equity, ' convenience, and the reason of the thing.' Assuredly, if this be so, it cannot Avant supporters, though the number of legs ill marks the force of the animal. But what is justice, and what is equity, what is convenience, or reason Are not they, each, more problematical than the thing to be defined; not to speak of the confusion superadded by the multiplicity The first rule (we may be pardoned for reminding) of definition commands that the terms and the things so employed shall, if not completely determinate and familiar, at least be somewhat more so than the object to be designated. In the case before us, the rule is inverted. But perhaps, from the form of ex¬ pression, it Avas borrowed, if this be an excuse for the evasion of a better. The ' reason of the thing' has a Germanic look. There is reason indeed to think the author drew from that source too implicitly as Avell as largely, to the neglect of his better judgment. For example, he adopts, as he owns, from Savigny the folloAving curious doctrine respecting the State, and Avhich his English common sense would have surely re¬ jected. ' It has been said (says Dr. Phillimore), that states are capable of rights and liable to obligations; but it must be remembered that they can never be the subjects of criminal law. This laAV is concerned with a natural person; a being of thought, feeling, and will. A legal person is not a being of these attributes, though, through the medium of representation and government, the will of certain indi¬ viduals is considered as the will of the corporation; but only for certain purposes. There must be individual Avill to found the juris¬ diction of criminal law ; will by representation cannot found this jurisdiction. Nor is this proposition inconsistent with the Avill re¬ quired by rights and obligations. A legal as Avell as a natural person has this limited will; it is consistent with the idea and object of a legal person. But the attribute of this unlimited Avill requisite for the commission of crime is Avholly inconsistent with this idea and object.' (Vol. i. p. 5.) Excluding a little of what seemed to be surplusage, Ave retain the exact terms, and the tissue, and the italics. The passage Avill thus furnish incidentally a sample of the author's mode of managing a deductive argument. We feel entirely sure that he would have done it otherwise, to vindicate a client in Doctors' Commons or the Court of Admiralty ; that is to say, in a case which he had studied and mastered. In copying from the German, he seems to labour as if in vacuo, and the reasoning involves, among others, the folloAving consequences:—That there can be, against civil rights, no criminal Avrongs, since the things are incompatible with one another in the same subject; rih</page><page sequence="33">1860. International Laic. 417 that therefore criminal Avrongs must have criminal rights to answer to them; that governments, moreover, can represent the one, to the exclusion of the other of these close correlations ; and this, because a whole Avill is requisite to commit crime, whereas a fraction of volition is competent to acquire rights — as if volition Avas not Avhole in every act hoAvever limited, the limitation applying of course not to the essence, but to the objects; in fine, that the representative will, although limited, is capa¬ ble, within that limit, of exercising rights, Avhile it cannot re¬ present, nor even itself commit, a crime within similar limits, or unless licensed to commit all crime. We say nothing of the error of placing social crime in will; it pervades the Avhole jural philosophy Ave are discussing. Nor of the crudity of as¬ similating governments to corporations; which is as if an ex¬ crescence in the physical body Avere mistaken for an organ, or rather for an offspring. Nor of imagining societies to be less ' natural' than men. Nor of the fallacy of assuming that there is a fixed line, in the nature of things, between civil and criminal laws; as if it Avas forgotten that the murders of to-day were Avith our forefathers liquidated by the payment of a small fine, and that a damage, then civil, cannot therefore be now criminal. On the merits of the point, it is needless here to add, that International Law is just the Criminal Law among states; as the criminal law proper has been also shoAvn to be a like negative or penal code among felloAV citizens. The whole difference lies merely in the machinery of execution. And if there Avas, as there will one day undoubtedly be, an international tribunal of justice in Europe, the completeness of the analogy Avould be discerned by even the multitude. It Avas discerned long ago by the sagacious Hooker, Avho says: ' The necessity of Avar, and the laws relating to it, are a conse- ' quence of the depraved nature of societies ; just as the necessity ' of the criminal law of society is a consequence of the depraved ' nature of individuals.' And Avhat is curious is, that Dr. Phillimore cites approvingly this passage (vol. iii. p. 67.) But so, repeatedly throughout, the pro and con. Avith like non¬ chalance. Thus much for the principles of Dr. Phillimore. And now for a sample of his method of arrangement. The first that encounters us, on coming to his programme, is duly enough the article of ' foundations.' But these are distributed into 1. The laws of the subject matter; 2. The subjects of these laAvs; 3. The objects of the laws; 4. Certain subjects requiring particular consideration, &amp;c. Now, all this sounds rather orderly,</page><page sequence="34">418 Grotius and the Sources of Oct. and Avas evidently so regarded. It is, however, in good logic, a curious topsy-turvy. The laws should, on the one hand, not be classed Avith their own ' foundations ;' and, on the other, should not precede either their subjects or their objects. Consisting in relations between these two terms, they on the contrary should follow them, in treatment as they do in nature. So, moreover, Avith these terms themselves, in their turn, the category of 'objects' should have been treated first, and not the reverse as in the series of the author. The objects are the more fundamental and simple, and afford the philosophical clue to the ' subjects.' Accordingly Ave saAV that in the history of the laAV of nations, men Avere led by mere instinct, or rather impotence, to the objects first; that then the laAV both international and national Avas Avholly objective; and that the subjective factor, Avith its symbol of will and rights, is a development of Christian or still more modern date. This order Avould besides have spared the author the uncouthness of inserting the ' objects ' between tAvo sorts of ' subjects'; a re¬ currence Avhich might have admonished him of the error. In fine, it is after both objects and subjects — Avhich constitute the proper ' foundations' of the theme — that the laAvs should have been ranged as the resulting relations. But these are evi¬ dently matters on which the learned author has not bestowed elaborate or strenuous cogitation. As a consequence or consonance, there is also in the details much confusion of argument and even laxity of expression. The author treats, for example, as International rights, those of self-preservation, acquisition, possession; and not in any par¬ ticular special to the national subject, but as they are laid down in the municipal laAV, Avhich ought however to be pre¬ supposed in the treatment of the international. Then, if his subject be on this side overloaded Avith extraneous matter, he has elsewhere failed to seize it in the proper extension. For instance, in the preface, Avhere he gives a sketch historical of the progress of this subject from the earliest knoAvn times, and where some twenty-four pages are devoted to England, Avhile to all the Avorld beside is apportioned but ten, yet, throughout and Avith apparent inadvertence, the Civil Law is represented as convertible Avith International LaAV in England. It is but natural then that the ancients should not be sketched Avith great intelligence. Accordingly our author assures us that the Romans had a ' regular system of international relations,' [laAv] ; to Avit the Jus Feciale and the Recuperatores. What the former amounted to, we have explained already. The recuperatores were, not merely not international, but Avere no constitutional officers at all. They Avere only Avhat in English law is familiar</page><page sequence="35">1860. International Law. 419 as arbitrators, designated by the prsetor or by the parties them¬ selves, or by the general, Avhere the litigants Avere of the army and on service. Dabantur (says Livy) et ab imperatoribus conten- tione orta inter milites. If they had to do Avith foreigners, it Avas but at Rome, and in the same informal and municipal quality. Still more curious, if possible, our Doctor of Civil Law recites that Aristotle Avrote a treatise on the Law of Nations. He Avas not then aAvare of the blunder above alluded to, though Dr. Whewell mentions the correction in his Grotius, Avhich had been already for a year or tAvo before the public. The real A7alue of these volumes does not, as may be per¬ ceived, lie in accuracy of reasoning on the first principles of the science, but in the applications of them Avhich are here collected with considerable labour and research. And this may make good the title Commentaries, which implies no more than mere practical explanation. Had Dr. Phillimore but kept to this, in the shape of short introductions and occasional notes, to his col¬ lection of documents, and also curtailed the biographical eulo- giums Avhich he scatters Avith a kindly or forensic liberality, not merely across the Rhine but even beyond the Atlantic — had he done this, his work Avould merit well of the country. For nothing of the kind, or at least of equal completeness, has been hitherto presented to the British public. Nor ought he to have disdained a mode of treating the subject, originated by the great Leibnitz, and pursued by the industrious Moser. But to give it a mere frontispiece or rather facing of theory, Avas but to cast discredit on the honest edifice behind. In fine, for these and most of the other shortcomings alluded to, the Doctor's OAvn plea should be accepted in apology, namely, that he has been the first in the English language to make a systematic attempt on the subject. The fact is more flattering to himself than to a country which, of all, is the most merged in international relations, and in Avhich the study of International Law ought to be one of the most constant studies of philosophers and statesmen, instead of being the most neglected. We have indicated Avhat appear to us to be the defects of Dr. Phillimore's Avork; its good qualities are sure to be discerned by a shrewd public; for in all things the positive is more perceptible than the privative. The first of virtues in all books is the lucidus ordo: but, without it, a book of science is a detestable traA'esty, unfit for the intellect or eyes of gods or men; and Ave may add, Avith the satirist, unfit for even the sign-posts. Lucid expression will not do. Nothing can exceed, for instance, Grotius in this. His terms are so proper, his sentences so simple, the structure of his periods so natural and neat, that he constantly reminds</page><page sequence="36">420 Grotius and the Sources of Oct. one of the minute precision of the filigree and tracery of Gothic architecture. But if you lift the eyes from this microscopic gazing and try to look back through a few paragraphs, not to say chapters, the vision is confounded by a blurred and quaint chaos, which completes your reminiscence of a mediaeval cathe¬ dral. On the contrary, the work of Suarez is a Vatican of proportions, a ' vastness that groAVS, but grows to harmonise.'' Dr. Phillimore too had a species of plan, although the principles and texture are not, as Ave have seen, the soundest; and he has filled it up, as he indeed Avith modest truth expresses it himself, principally by historical and legal disquisitions (many of them of great interest), on the application of what is loosely termed the Law of Nations to the practical questions of public law. And this remark brings us to the third and final section of our design, which Avas to trace the LaAV of Nature and the Law of Nations progressively and distinctly from their respective sources to their final application to human affairs. Our limits warn us, however, that Ave can do no more than trace an out¬ line of this part of the subject. Perhaps the most compendious characterisation may be this: That, while the two preceding phases of universal jurisprudence bore, the first upon created nature, in guise of Duties to the Divinity; and the second upon human or moral nature, expressed by Rights — the final and future state takes the middle course of History, upon the ra¬ tional relations between Nature and Humanity. Excluding, therefore, on the one hand, the Law of Nature proper, and on the other the Civil, or individual law of men, the grand inter- lying region which belongs to the present subject might be designated systematically, in those three constituent aspects, as the Jus gentium, the Jura gentium, and the Lex gentium respectively; or the Duties, the Rights, the Laws of Nations. In the strict and proper sense of the term Law, it cannot be said that any binding obligation is imposed by authority on sovereign and independent states, other than the obligations Avhich they themselves recognise as essential conditions of their OAvn civilisation, determined partly by legal tradition and partly by the moral dictates of public opinion. Thus, to quote a familiar instance, England has endeavoured for half a century to induce all civilised states to rank the slave trade amongst offences against the Law of Nations committed on the high seas. Her success in this humane enterprise has been exactly proportioned to the morality and advancement of the nations Avith which she had to deal. Treaties, the decisions of maritime courts, the text Avriters on these subjects, and, in some feAV instances, the collective Declarations of the Great Powers, are</page><page sequence="37">1860. International Law. 421 the forms which these principles assume, and they constitute all that can strictly be called the written Law of International Relations. This Avritten law is the offspring of those principles which we have traced from the highest regions of religion and philosophy; and its progress is the progress of civilisation itself. Its application is more direct to occurrences and the dealings of men upon the high seas than upon land, because the sea lies beyond the range of municipal and territorial jurisdiction. Hence it is only by this species of international compact or recognition of common principles that life, property, and freedom can be protected on the sea as they are by each state Avithin the land boundaries of its OAvn dominions. But the principles them¬ selves, being those of eternal morality and justice, inseparable from the common interest of mankind, are of universal applica¬ tion ; and we doubt not, that Avith the progress of civilisation, the nations of the world will speedily proceed in this direction, from antagonism to organisation. In this sense the extension of the principles of free trade, and of those mechanical inventions which have so powerfully contributed in our OAvn times to unite in closer brotherhood the families of civilised Europe, are of an importance far exceeding their immediate and material results. The Declaration of the Congress of Paris in 1856, Avhich esta¬ blished the principle of trade by neutrals during Avar, subject to no restraint but that of actual blockades, and which abolished the lawless plunder of privateering, was another memorable step; and we trust it will at no distant time be followed by measures tending to secure to private property on the high seas that immunity Avhich has long been extended, even during Avar, to private property on land. The stricter application of the law of non-intervention, which means in other terms" the refusal to allow a foreign force to control the just and natural course of events in another country,—whether it be to restore dynas¬ ties which have fallen by their follies, or to uphold institutions which are crumbling to decay,—'is a further homage paid to the great principle of national independence, and to the right of men to establish amongst themselves a government of their choice. From all these examples, which could be indefinitely multi¬ plied, it is obvious that England is interested beyond all the other Powers of the world, in maintaining, promoting, and ex¬ tending the great principles of International Law. She is in¬ terested in the maintenance of peace betAveen all civilised na¬ tions, for she has long abandoned all schemes of conquest; and if her armies are summoned to the field it is in defence of the principles of International LaAV, Avhich more barbarous peoples</page><page sequence="38">422 Grotius and the Sources of International Law. Oct. have not yet learned to obey. She is interested in the spread of commerce and the fullest liberty of trade, both in peace and Avar, by land and sea, because it is evident that the nation Avhose produce and Avhose ships are most Avidely scattered over the globe, must be the first to suffer by restrictions placed upon commercial enterprise. She is interested in the growth of free institutions throughout the Avorld, because in the political faith and experience of England, international relations consist not in the alliances of despots for the mutual extinction of popular rights, but in the establishment of independent nations and govern¬ ments respecting the rights of others, and claiming the same respect for their own. The Avelfare of the Avorld depends on the maintenance of these principles, and although we acknow¬ ledge Avith gratitude the progress they have made in the last half-century, we cannot forget that a few months of general war—a few months given to passion instead of reason, and to force instead of laAV — Avould have the effect of a conflagration in the stateliest edifice Avhich has yet been raised by the genius of man. May Heaven avert the omen! and may the rulers who bear the personal responsibility of the conduct of public affairs in all the great States of Europe, remember that no glory or advantage is for a moment comparable to the preservation of those principles Avhich place the moral and material interests of mankind under the rcgis of public laAV. r~</page></plain_text>
