ALLAN MEGILL University of Iowa Life Histories and Psychobiography: Explorations in Theory and Method. By William McKinley lVunyan. Oxford and New York: Oxford University Press, 1984. Pp. xiii+288. $9.95. The Structure of Mind in History: Five Major Figures in Psychohistory. By Philip Pomper. New York: Columbia University Press, 1985. Pp. xvi + 192. $20.00. These two books, both excellent in their own ways, demonstrate the diversity of issues and methods encompassed by the term "psychohistory." Runyan's Life Histories and Psychobiography is rooted in the methodology of behavioral science and the concerns of individual case history as much as in life history. By contrast, Pomper's The Structure of Mind in History is a contribution to the philosophy of history from a psychohistorical perspective. Despite their clarity and balance, Runyan's essays on methodology in Life Histories and Psychobiography will be of less interest to the professional his- torian. Runyan's training is in academic psychology, and many of the topics of the book are more relevant to the clinician or the behavioral science re- searcher. However, Runyan's training enables him to approach the psycho- biography debate with an engaging and informed skepticism. He employs the perspectives and parameters of empirical science to clarify the welter of facts and hypotheses on which assertions in psychobiography are often based. Run- yan is at his best in his chapter "Why Did Van Gogh Cut off fIis Ear? The Problem of Alternative Explanations in Psychobiography," in which he eval- uates the divergent accounts of the artist's self-mutilating behavior. Even as he argues for a methodologically more rigorous approach to life history, he resists an empiricist reductionism that would eliminate the qualitative and speculative dimensions of traditional narrative biographies and more innovative psychobiographies. Unfortunately, Runyan's chapter on "The Psychobiogra- phy Debate" is little more than a methodological introduction to the subject. There is no in-depth discussion of current issues in psychobiography, no treat- ment of more contemporary psychoanalytic models, and no examination of the relation between the study of individual lives and that of groups. Runyan is a perceptive critic of the psychobiographical approach but has little to add to it. In contrast to Runyan's emphasis on life history, Philip Pomper focuses on psychohistory in the context of the nature of historical discourse. Taking his lead from Hayden White's Metahistory (Baltimore, 1973), Pomper examines the relevant works of Freud, Erikson, Marcuse, Brown, and Lifton in terms of five architectonics or "principles for structuring processes of development." In the case of psychohistory particularly, these architectonics are metaphors that reflect what Pomper terms an ''endopsychic anthropomorphism": mental constructs that have an imaginative appeal in so far as they draw on "attitudes,</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews 357 moods, wishes, and anxieties." The "genetic architectonic" most clearly char- acterizes Freud's approach. It is rooted in a belief in the power of origins, reflecting Freud's emphasis on phylogenetic inheritance and his deterministic conception of the relation between psychic structure and historical processes. The ;'epigenetic architectonic," identified with the approach of Erikson, softens the genetic metaphor by allowing for the introduction of exogenous as well as endogenous factors in development. Although both principles are, as Pomper points out, intrinsically conservative, the epigenetic model provides greater indeterminacy and more latitude for cultural influence. The i'systemic" or "cybernetic architectonic" refers to the complex unity of mutually interdependent parts of psychic or historical structures. Pomper employs it less to distinguish among these theorists than to identify a common underlying assumption. The exception here is Robert Lifton, whose ;'cata- strophic architectonic" is directed toward those radical disruptions of the his- torical process that undermine systemic organization at both the communal and individual levels and require adaptive and creative responses. By contrast, the "dialectic architectonic," embedded in the speculative psychohistories of Brown and Marcuse, incorporates conflict or radical change into another met- aphor of unfolding. Pomper shows how Brown and Marcuse-in opposition to the conservatism of the genetic and epigenetic metaphors, particularly as worked out in Freud-employ a dialectical stance to propose a visionary transformation of individual and social consciousness. Finally, through the notion of archi- tectonic nesting, he suggests that these structures are interrelated or even dependent on one another. Thus, for Pomper "dialectics nests within the epi- genetic architectonic or . . . is really a variant of it." For that matter, each of these historical metaphors is incorporated, to one degree or another, within the systemic architectonic. Just as Pomper deals flexibly with his structuring principles, the book itself is informed by a balance, openness, and spirit of inquiry that ultimately moves these essays beyond the schema set out for them. The studies of Erikson and Lifton are of particular interest because the previous literature on these figures is less exhaustive and because they are identified with the application of psy- chology to discrete historical problems as well as to its broader shape. Pomper's treatment of Erikson's Young Man Luther (New York, 1958) is particularly good, both in establishing the role of creative leadership in addressing the spiritual and social stagnation of late medieval Europe and in pointing out what he describes as the generic meaning of Protestantism as expressed in the ego strengths required to create ideologies and movements of liberation. Although Pomper is aware of the existential side of Erikson it might be argued that he does not pinpoint the generic meaning of Gandhi's Truth: On the Origins of Militant Nonviolence (New York, 1969) as effectively as he does that of Luther's. Pomper depicts Gandhi's Truth as another work that relates a religious leader's contribution to that of Freud and psychoanalysis. It would be equally valid to point out how the book suggests that both Gandhi's and Erikson's psychoanalytic and religious actualism transcends the introspective realism of Freud. In fact, it is in the contrast between Luther and Gandhi (and implicitly, between Freud and Erikson)-the first representative of a heavily masculine, introspective absolutism, the second embodying a more feminine, more activist relativism-that the teleological implications of Erikson's epi- genetic approach find their most concrete expression. This becomes an issue</page><page sequence="3">358 Book Reviews again in Pomper's essay on Lifton, where he contrasts Lifton's notion of continuous renewal and the formative paradigm as crystallized in Protean Man to Erikson's more static notion of identity. This is valid to a point, but Erikson may be credited with transcending the notion of identity himself in his portrayal of Gandhi and satyagraha. Just as Pomper points out that for Lifton "the psychohistorian, as creative survivor, advocate, and community therapist" becomes an active agent in the historical process, so does Erikson present himself and the psychoanalytic movement in Gandhi's Truth. Pomper's fine evocation of metaphor and symbolism in Lifton's approach (as in that of his other subjects) can orient the reader not only to the underlying structures of psychohistory but also to what the psychohistorical approach is particularly adept at drawing from historical data. With its sensitivity to the affective content of language and to the tendency to anthropomorphize the political and social world through individual and communal symbols, psy- chohistorical discourse can enhance our understanding of human experience in history without reducing that experience to any single meaning. LEWIS D. WURGAFT Harvard Medical School The Thirty Years' War. By Geoffrey Parker. London: Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul, 1984. Pp. xliii+340. $39.95. Fought by over a dozen belligerents, the conflicts of the Thirty Years' War are recorded in over ten languages, with documents deposited in scores of archives scattered across Europe. C. V. Wedgwood's study, The Thirty Years' War (Lon- don), first published in 1938, has long remained one of the most popular ac- counts of the war. Since 1945 numerous studies have appeared, but the major scholarly impetus has come from Czechoslovakia, where under the direction of Josef Polisensky and others, the Academy of Sciences is editing the mul- tivolume series Documenta Bohemica Bellum Tricennale illustrczntia. Polisen- sky himself is the author of two major books, The Thirty Years' War (English ed. trans. Robert Evans, Berkeley and Los Angeles, 1971) and War and Society in Europe, 1618-1648 (German original, Prague, 1971; English ed. trans. Poli- sensky with Frederick Snider, Cambridge, 1978), which depart from an em- phasis on military and diplomatic events to stress the socioeconomic structures associated with the war. Thorough in his investigation of Czech archives, Polisensky firmly anchors his accounts in Bohemia which furnished the origins of the war as well as its most well-known figure, Wallenstein but is somewhat negligent of the truly international dimensions of the conflict. There has yet to be a single volume that takes into account not only the enormous number of published archival sources that have appeared in the last twenty years but also the vast ocean of secondary literature, written in a multitude of languages. The Thirty Years' War was not only a German civil war but also a confluence of the dynastic struggles between the Hapsburgs and their various enemies. Superimposed on the pattern of international dynastic struggles is the complex matrix of German territorial politics, with at least a dozen actors pursuing independent foreign policies.
