<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> 2 A Colonial Wordsmith: George Isaacs in Adelaide,  1860-1870 Anne Black One hundred and fifty years ago, a popular author with the  mythological pseudonym 'A. Pendragon' walked the streets  of central Adelaide, but his significance and his story—a  complex drama of one man's efforts to establish himself as a  colonial writer—have been long forgotten. In 1858, George  Isaacs made his mark on Australian literature as the author  of the first novel published in South Australia, The Queen  of the South. Yet in terms of literary output, his most prolific  years were in Adelaide during the 1860s, when newspapers,  poems, stories and plays flowed from his pen. At the start of  that decade he had modestly declared: 'I believe there is a  vacant place in our colonial literature. It is my aim to fill it'  (Pendragon, Number One, 3). This chapter examines Isaacs's  efforts to achieve that goal in an unsupportive environment,  and the huge personal cost that it entailed. Born in London in 1825, Isaacs was the eldest son in  a prosperous Jewish family. During his youth he dabbled  in literature, hobnobbed with the titled, was a flâneur in  Paris, collected medieval antiques and, despite his tender  years, became a precocious antiquarian. This pleasant  </page> <page sequence="2"> 40 Anne Black existence ended suddenly with the pregnancy of Marion, his non-Jewish  partner, who was probably only 15 years old. Isaacs sold off his treasures,  farewelled his friends, indicated he was leaving for a healthier climate  and boarded the former convict ship, the Mountstuart Elphinstone. The  couple and their baby arrived in Port Adelaide in March 1851. Isaacs now faced the novel prospect of employment. Armed with  recommendations from prominent English authors plus examples of his  own poetry, he approached the editor of the South Australian Register,  John Taylor. No doubt Taylor had met many newly-arrived amateur scribes  hoping for a career in journalism, so it is not surprising that his polite  but tardy reply did not include the offer of a job. Forced to earn a living,  Isaacs opened a stationery business next to the Royal Exchange Hotel  in Hindley Street with Samuel Copland Allday, a fellow immigrant from  the Mountstuart Elphinstone.1 Shortly afterwards, Isaacs became the sole  operator of the business, but either it did not prosper or he was restless.  By 1852 he had settled in Gawler, north of Adelaide, where he again ran a  stationery shop, this time on behalf of Burnet Nathan, an Adelaide-based  merchant and importer. Following the discovery of gold in late 1851, a large proportion  of South Australia's adult male population was lured to the Victorian  goldfields. Isaacs joined the throng. Nothing is known of his success  there, but when he returned to Gawler in early 1856 he had only two  pounds. His experiences in Victoria, however, did provide the basis for  his novel, a tale of the goldfields. Back in Gawler, an abortive attempt to  found a reading room led Isaacs to insolvency and the Adelaide Gaol.  Eventually, with other clever young men, he became a prominent citizen  of the 'Colonial Athens' of Gawler, a vigorous promoter of its Institute  and a founder (and the 'Surprising Sham') of its once-famed anti- humbug fraternity, the Humbug Society. His first 10 years in the colony  1 No cargo on the Mountstuart Elphinstone was listed under Isaacs’s name, so it appears  that he did not bring stock with him from England. This suggests that the stationery  business venture was opportunistic rather than planned. </page> <page sequence="3"> George Isaacs in Adelaide 41 established his reputation as an independent, colourful character who  did not fit comfortably into conservative Adelaide society. The appearance  of his novel The Queen of the South and a few published poems marked his  first decade as a colonial writer. By 1860, the now 35-year-old Isaacs was determined to advance his  literary career. While toiling as a clerk, he wrote a letter to the South  Australian Advertiser that expressed his latent editorial ambitions: But if circumstances have placed us in a sphere uncongenial to  us, we are not to be restrained from our endeavor to emancipate  ourselves. Why should I, for instance, always be as I am? May I not,  like others, have my small ambition and desire to write myself M.P.  or Editor? (31 July 1860, 3) Isaacs's 'small ambition' was a conceit. He yearned for influence and for  recognition from his fellow citizens. From his diverse literary output over  the following decade, it is clear that he ached for publication, irrespective  of literary genre. He happily jumped from one literary form to another,  apparently on a whim or as circumstances prevailed. By nature, Isaacs was suited to the role of editor. He liked to collect,  arrange, inform—and to correct his fellows. In April 1861 he boldly  launched a monthly journal of prose and poetry, named Number One, in  Adelaide. This was his first attempt in Australia to publish his prose and  poetry, although ostensibly he was doing it not only for himself but for the  greater good of other aspiring writers. Number One's introduction stated  that its editor, A. Pendragon, hoped to 'provide a vehicle for imaginative  writing' (3), but, probably by necessity, Isaacs himself supplied most of  the contents. He also received minor support from his Gawler friend  Doctor George Nott, who contributed material under the pseudonyms  "G. N." and "Ignotus" (Latin for unknown). 'A. Pendragon' outlined the  journal's scope: 'Politics and News as generally understood, would have  no place in it, Wit, Humour, Agreeable narrative, History, Travel, Poesy,  the Arts and Sciences, the movements of the Philosophical, and other  literary associations—would.' (3) The booklet was a geographical hybrid,  </page> <page sequence="4"> 42 Anne Black compiled in Gawler, printed at the Northern Star office in Kapunda and  published by the bookseller W. C. Rigby at 53 Hindley Street in Adelaide. Number One was a hybrid in a different way too. It juxtaposed  European recollections with impressions of Australian colonial life.  Most of Isaacs's poems are permeated by nostalgia for his European  past, a universal concern of South Australian immigrants of the time.  Thus, in Number One he recalls European birds in the anthropomorphic  'The Owl and the Lark' (22) and English plants in his poem (and later  published song) 'The Myrtle' (31). This probably provided a comforting  and familiar context for his readers. However, the Register's reviewer was  more impressed by the journal's inclusion of Australian themes: One of the best things about this new production is that it is 'racy  of the soil'. In matter, tone, and spirit it is generally Australian. The  writers deal chiefly with subjects familiar to the reader, and this  of itself is so great an advantage that it will be readily excused if  a thought is sometimes crude, or if an idea here and there wants  'fencing in'. (16 May 1861, 2) The Advertiser also joined its daily rival in adding a mildly sanctimonious  rebuke to its review: 'We suggest, however, that certain expletives which  Police Court reporters usually indicate by an initial letter and a long dash,  might with advantage be omitted from a magazine which we presume is  intended for all circles' (18 May 1861, 2). Number One garnered supportive  reviews—'The number before us is really a good colonial shilling's- worth' (Advertiser, 18 May 1861, 2)—but despite an extensive nine-month  advertising campaign in the Adelaide press, Number One did not progress  to Number Two. In his introduction, A. Pendragon had stated that the  journal's fate 'rests with the public of South Australia'; their response  was apathy, as it was to most of the city's new magazines of that era. Isaacs's editorial ambitions were inflamed rather than dampened  by the demise of Number One. He could not resist the freedom and the  discipline of the editorial role for long. If overseeing the birth of Number  One had been satisfying for him, the prospect of becoming the editor of  </page> <page sequence="5"> George Isaacs in Adelaide 43 a weekly newspaper was irresistible. With supreme confidence he moved  again to the city and probably invested all his money in the new project.  Adelaide's inhabitants awoke on 4 October 1862 to find a new sixpenny  Saturday weekly, the Critic, edited by A. Pendragon. From his upstairs  office in Waterhouse's Buildings in King William Street, Isaacs provided  readers with an independent view of life in the colony. On the opening  page he stated that the Critic aimed: not to advance the opinions of any political party, but to comment,  in a candid and impartial spirit, on the Events of the Week, and on  the various sentiments initiated by the Daily Journals. SATIRE— generally recognized as one of the most effective correctives of folly  and abuses, will be by 'THE CRITIC' somewhat freely employed. (4  October 1862, 1) An inveterate critic, Isaacs was hardly impartial where political  parties were concerned. His paper promised 'Fun without coarseness/  Humour, free from vulgarity/ Wit devoid of bitterness, and/ Ridicule, clear  of personalities'. Its launch was noted by the Register: 'Its editor, long known  under the nom de plume of 'A. Pendragon,' is a man of undoubted ability,  and the first number of the new journal fully sustains his reputation'  (7 October 1862, 2). The same article also graciously added that 'there  is ample room in the colony for such a publication', even though the  first issue had chastised the established paper for suppressing negative  correspondence. Isaacs did not attempt to align himself with Adelaide's  literary establishment. Brave (or perhaps foolhardy), and politically astute  (but with few social inhibitions), he preferred an independent path. Isaacs ensured that his paper lived up to its name. The Critic held  local politicians to account and offered topical opinions on world affairs.  It reviewed new publications (such as John Gould's The Birds of Australia)  and was not afraid to address current scientific controversy (with a spirited  defence of Darwinism). For light relief it also included puzzles, gave news  from the local racetrack and theatre, and entertained its readers with  gossip, poems and stories. Isaacs's still-strong attachment to European  </page> <page sequence="6"> 44 Anne Black literary culture showed in his inclusion of extracts from the recent works  of European writers. Thus, a translated excerpt from Victor Hugo's latest  sensation Les Misérables, courtesy of Mr Rigby, appeared in the Critic  not long after the novel's debut in France. From a technical perspective  the Critic expected other papers to match its own high standards, and it  gleefully exposed examples of grammatical imperfection, typographical  errors and careless prose in the Adelaide press. Isaacs, at least as an  editor, was a perfectionist. He was also responsible for most of the Critic's content. It was a huge  task, but it did allow him to indulge himself extravagantly. He printed an  image of his own rebus (two eyes over an axe, eyes-axe = Isaacs), recalled  his early days in 'Twainbridge' (a thinly-disguised reference to Gawler) and  described an adventure he had experienced with his friend, the Adelaide  photographer 'Professor' Robert Hall. He also included, in two parts, the  full text of his own rather strange lecture, 'Ancient Superstitions'. On  cool evenings in August and September 1862, just prior to the Critic's  launch, Isaacs had delivered this hour-long speech to appreciative  audiences in several towns scattered around Adelaide. The dense subject  matter must have demanded the full attention of the colonists who sat in  those draughty local halls, and it illustrates the general thirst for novelty.  A reviewer captured the complexity of the talk, and also the depth of  Isaacs's knowledge in this rarefied field, writing that the speaker: commenced his subject by referring to the Jewish caballists as the  earliest teachers of magic science,—the science and mysteries of  numbers, judicial astrology, invocation of Saints, and the labours of  the alchymists, in their endeavours to transmute base metals into  gold, and the search after the philosopher's stone, were severally  touched upon. The lecturer then proceeded to give an account of  love phyltres, amulets, and charms, and of the universal belief in,  and horrors of, witchcraft in England up to the last century. The  celebrated Dr. Dee, and the pranks he played on Queen Elizabeth,  were referred to, and the lecture concluded with a brief notice of  </page> <page sequence="7"> George Isaacs in Adelaide 45 theomania of fairies, gnomes, and sprites. (Advertiser, 25 August  1862, 3) The lecture and its publication are indicative of the driving force behind  most of Isaacs's writing—he wished to entertain and inform his fellow  citizens. Yet despite his enthusiasm, erudition and effort, the paper  was soon in financial trouble. Debtors did not pay their bills, illness  intervened and there was a legal dispute with the printer, the Adelaide  publisher George Dehane. Isaacs's grand vision of founding and editing  his own paper collapsed within six months, after only twenty-one issues.  Undaunted, he co-founded and contributed his wit to the Humbug  Society's new satirical paper, the Bunyip. It would be six years before Isaacs was again the editor of an  Adelaide paper. This venture was the threepenny weekly, the Licensed  Victualler. Printed at the City Steam Press in Gawler Place, its purpose  was to advocate on behalf of the colony's publicans, who were then  facing onerous proposed legislation. Isaacs frequented hotels and hated  injustice, so he took up their cause with glee. The first issue appeared on  27 November 1869, and it opened appropriately with a two-page article  on defamation law. Then in a familiar Pendragon tone, but rather violent  language, the editor announced his aims: to ridicule, pretension—to hold up to scorn, cant and humbug— to denounce abuse and jobbery, and to seize with an unflinching  hand the public thief and oppressor, however he may deem himself  protected by the bristles of the law, and to gibbet him as an example  to evil doers in all times to come. (27 November 1869, 4) The Licensed Victualler's masthead was adorned with a typical  Isaacs's device—a grandiose motto. This particular example came from  the works of Francis Bacon, 'Magnanimity consisteth in contempt of peril,  in contempt of profit, and in meriting of the times wherein one liveth.'  It sounds an appropriate motto for Isaacs, but its relevance to publicans  is a bit vague. Isaacs used the paper to promote his own causes, as well  </page> <page sequence="8"> 46 Anne Black as those of the licensed victuallers. Not only were there articles on liquor  regulations, diatribes against the unjust treatment of the inebriated and  a footnote on the derivation of the word 'grog', but readers could also  enjoy a humorous article on the rival colony of Victoria or a comment on  South Australia's neglect of intellectual worth. Once again, Isaacs used  his paper as a platform from which to attack the relevance of the major  Adelaide newspapers. His audacity is apparent in this example from the  seventh issue: THE 'Register' and 'Advertiser' have had a grand controversy  regarding the respective right of each to claim to be at the head of  the Press. The question may not be considered by an indifferent  reader to be of any great moment to the public, but it is certainly as  instructive as most of the subjects presented in those journals, and,  without dispute, as amusing as the majority of reports given by them  of tea meeting[s], bazaars, good young men's associations, lectures,  and the various other sources of bewilderment and beguilement  presented by sanctimonious scavengers to their silly supporters. (8  January 1870, 3) The Licensed Victualler ran for thirteen issues and then disappeared, a  victim of Isaacs's poor health2 and financial difficulties. Elizabeth Webby, writing on literature in colonial Australia, has  noted that 'Few authors were able to make a living from writing and  these few depended heavily on journalism, supplemented in some cases  by the writing of serialised fiction or plays and pantomimes' (46). Isaacs  was typical in this regard: his first novel had initially been released in  parts, he dabbled in journalism and throughout the 1860s he wrote plays.  Life was difficult for a playwright, not only in Adelaide, but nationally. In  the absence of local copyright laws and royalties, many Australian theatre  managers chose to stage pirated (and therefore free) versions of English  2 Throughout his life Isaacs suffered from chronic asthma, and there are many references  to his illnesses (including typhoid in 1866) in letters to him, and in the press. His ill- health certainly had a negative impact on the production of his newspapers, which were  temporarily or permanently suspended during such bouts. </page> <page sequence="9"> George Isaacs in Adelaide 47 plays, in preference to paying local writers for new works. Isaacs railed  against this practice in print, especially when he was unable to stage  his burlesque of Frankenstein (an unperformed but printed play, now of  interest to science fiction buffs) during his time in Melbourne in 1864- 65.3 One of the two venues that hosted performances of Isaacs's  plays in Adelaide still exists. The Victoria Theatre (now known as the  Queen's Theatre building) remains on its original site in Gilles Arcade  in the CBD. The other theatre, White's Assembly Rooms in King William  Street, has not survived to the present. Following several reincarnations  (from White's, to the Majestic Theatre, then the Majestic Hotel) it was  demolished in 1981. A thorough review of Adelaide theatre advertisements in the 1860s  reveals that Isaacs's first play was That's Smith. According to the Register  it promised 'a great amount of amusing business and many laughable  situations such as generally secure the success of compositions of that  character' (22 July 1862, 2). The two act farce, which had been expressly  written for the Victoria Theatre, opened on the stormy evening of 22 July  1862: It was very successful with the audience, who imperatively demanded  the appearance of the author. He was, after some delay, led to the  front by Mr. Greville, the living picture of sweet bashfulness and  unsophisticated confusion. He bowed his acknowledgments, and  retired amid a storm of applause. (Register, 23 July 1862, 2) Despite this pleasing reception it seems that there were only two  performances of That's Smith. By June 1863 Isaacs had completed his  next play, Major Blaze, but he was unable to secure a backer or find a  3 Isaacs’s description of the difficulties he faced in staging the burlesque, plus the text  of the play, can be found in his book, Rhyme and Prose, and, a Burlesque and its History,  published in Melbourne in 1865. The play was new, but much of the other material in the  book had already been published in Adelaide in the South Australian Advertiser, Number  One, the Critic and in Isaacs’s occasional leaflet, Colonial Lyrics. </page> <page sequence="10"> 48 Anne Black venue for its production. The Advertiser, which was generally supportive  of his literary efforts, provided the following titbit to its readers: We understand that Mr. George Isaacs not having succeeded in  arranging for the production of his new comedy, 'Major Blaze,' in  Adelaide, and there being no local copyright law in South Australia  to protect his work, he has decided to enter it at Stationers' Hall,  according to the provisions of the Imperial Act. Before doing so,  however, he intends to give a private reading of the comedy to a few  literary friends. (20 June 1863, 2) A check of the records of Stationers' Hall,4 the London-based registry of  literary works, has found no evidence that Major Blaze was ever lodged  there, under Isaacs's name or under that of his pseudonym. Possibly  procrastination, frequent ill-health or his chronic poverty had prevented  its deposition. Perhaps the manuscript's details did not survive the long  sea voyage 'home'. Major Blaze disappeared without a trace. Isaacs's ephemeral entertaining comedies, performed competently  by well-known actors, were always well-received by Adelaide's audiences  and critics. In terms of longevity, his most successful play was Our Trip  to the Rhine. He wrote it and several other sketches at the request of the  visiting English entertainers Grace Egerton and her concertina-playing  husband and sidekick, George Case. Egerton was wildly popular in  Australia (amongst other things, a gold reef, a mining company and a  racehorse were named after her) and she was famous for her quick change  routines, her astonishing impersonations and her sweet singing voice.  Isaacs employed all her skills when he wrote Our Trip to the Rhine for her  in late 1864 during his stay in Melbourne. The play premiered there, but  by March 1865 it had opened in Adelaide at White's Assembly Rooms.  Its plot was a silly confection of improbable characters and situations  4 ‘Stationers’ Hall’, now the Worshipful Company of Stationers and Newspaper Makers,  is a London organisation that was founded in 1403, originally as a Guild of Stationers. In  Isaacs’s time, authors could enter their name and work in a Register, thereby establishing  an early form of copyright. </page> <page sequence="11"> George Isaacs in Adelaide 49 interspersed with popular songs and concertina solos, all staged against  a painted alpine backdrop. The critics were thrilled by Egerton's skills.  Isaacs received named credit for the play in advertisements during its  Melbourne run, but by the time it was staged in Adelaide, and from then  on, all trace of his authorship was erased. Over the next fifteen years Our  Trip was performed throughout Australia and around the world, from  Cooktown to Perth and from India to Nova Scotia. Although the sketch  probably evolved over time, its title was retained. Isaacs was almost  certainly unaware of his play's reincarnation overseas, and he received  neither much-needed money nor the recognition he craved from the  popular production. During the couple's next Australian tour, Egerton performed  Isaacs's latest play The Lost Party or the House Warming: Too Warm to be  Pleasant5 at White's Assembly Rooms. It had first appeared in Sydney in  September 1866 and reached Adelaide in April of the following year. The  Advertiser clarified its origins for its readers and once again offered subtle  support for its creator: We understand 'The Lost Party,' now being presented to the  public at White's Rooms, and the well-remembered 'Trip to the  Rhine,' and several minor pieces with which Mr. and Mrs. Case  have delighted Adelaide audiences, are from the pen of the popular  writer 'Pendragon' properly known as Mr. George Isaacs. (25 April  1867, 2) Isaacs's final known play, a brief farce called Our Uncle, appears  to have had only one performance, at the Victoria Theatre on 7 June  1867. It was included in the benefit night for the popular actor William  Hoskins, whom Isaacs had met a few years earlier in Melbourne. The  5 The Mitchell Library holds a ‘book of words’ of The Housewarming: Too Warm to be  Pleasant. It is undated and printed by Charles Troedel in Melbourne. A later version of  this play was advertised as having been revised by Edmund Yates, a friend of Dickens, so  it is possible that this is the version published. However, there are clear similarities in  content between newspaper reviews of the initial performances of the play, and the extant  copy. </page> <page sequence="12"> 50 Anne Black audience and the local papers gave the play an enthusiastic reception,  with one reviewer noting that 'its chief merit lay in the dialogue, which  was racy, and abounded in local allusions' (Register, 8 June 1867, 2). This  play was not published, but contemporary reviews provide a summary  of the implausible plot in which, thanks to a series of coincidences,  the impoverished lawyer Fluke eventually marries the heroine, Miss  Honeydew. As the 1860s advanced, Isaacs's own life became a drama. Following  the demise of the Critic he moved to Melbourne with his wife Marion and  seven children. He was optimistic that the city offered more scope for his  literary talents and for the production of his plays, but by early 1865 he  was dangerously impoverished. Demanding creditors, family illness, little  literary success and insufficient employment as a 'theatrical agent' led  to his second imprisonment for insolvency—this time in the Melbourne  Gaol. Following his release (and the birth of his eighth child) Isaacs  published a new compilation of his work, Rhyme and Prose, and, a  Burlesque and its History. Its timing and contents suggest that it may have  been prepared during his incarceration. Many of the poems and short  stories had already appeared in Adelaide, but Melbourne offered a new  audience. Then Isaacs fled the city, to reappear in Adelaide alone. Perhaps  his wife, worn down by years of strife and poverty, banished him from  the colony and her life, although how an unsupported woman survived  in that circumstance is difficult to imagine. Perhaps Isaacs was avoiding  creditors and intended to return once he was financially stable. Maybe,  exhausted and disillusioned, he simply deserted his family. Whatever the  catalyst for the separation, he never reunited with his wife and family. The ability to write was now Isaacs's only remaining asset, so  he offered his services to the Adelaide public. During August 1866 he  promoted his abilities in the South Australian Advertiser: 'TRADESMAN'S  BOOKS MADE UP. Letters for the press revised, lectures written,  advertisements and circulars drawn up, petitions prepared, &amp;c.' (4 August  </page> <page sequence="13"> George Isaacs in Adelaide 51 1866, 1). A journalist added wryly: 'Amongst his other offers, Mr. Isaacs  undertakes to revise letters intended for publication in the press; an  office for which there is, as we know by experience, abundant occasion'  (Advertiser, 31 July 1866, 2). Evidence suggests that Isaacs's advertisements  were successful. The State Library of South Australia holds a manuscript  in his handwriting, entitled 'The Origin, Rise and Progress of British  Song', along with affectionate notes from the celebrated English musician  George Loder to Isaacs. Much to the delight of musically inclined citizens,  Loder had recently settled in Adelaide. He delivered the lecture to an  appreciative audience at the Adelaide Town Hall in December 1866. Another example of A. Pendragon's writing from that year can be  found in the State Library of New South Wales, in the form of a charming  12-page advertising brochure entitled Twenty-four Hours' Adventures  of a New Arrival in South Australia. Isaacs created this fictional story to  promote the local Adelaide traders. In an amazing feat of stamina and  retail therapy, its protagonist Augustus Fastman traipses around the city  streets on his first day in the colony. Unable to resist the city's bountiful  offerings, Augustus purchases everything from cigars to wine, a haircut, a  piano, a saddle and a ticket to a performance by Lyster's Opera Company.  He even has time for a trip to the beachside suburb of Glenelg and for  jewellery repairs. (Isaacs was rather fond of beautiful jewellery.) At the  mention of each purchase, Isaacs carefully identifies and praises the  vendor. In addition to being a novel way to advertise goods, this little  work provided new immigrants, as well as twenty-first century readers,  with a comprehensive overview of the products, shops and services  available in Adelaide in 1866. Neither the lecture nor the advertising story  is a serious literary work, but they illustrate the versatility required by a  colonial writer. Unfortunately, these literary pursuits did not save Isaacs  from a third insolvency and imprisonment, just as he was struggling to  re-establish himself in Adelaide. Isaacs had an obvious affinity, and a lot of fun, with poetry. He  covered the gamut of its varieties—narrative, love ('Enough! That I have  </page> <page sequence="14"> 52 Anne Black loved as few can love' [Pendragon, Number One, 19]), satirical, historical,  nationalistic and autobiographical ('Evil the deeds that wall my life  about—That doom me to this cage' [Isaacs, Rhyme and Prose, 55]). These  poems reveal much about his nature. They popped up regularly in Adelaide  publications including the South Australian Register, the South Australian  Advertiser and Bell's Life in Adelaide, as well as in Isaacs's own Colonial  Lyrics and in his collections Number One and Rhyme and Prose. They were  consistently well-reviewed. In 1869 he launched a new collection of his  prose and poetry in the city, Not for Sale: A Selection of Imaginative Pieces.  Its title advertised his independence and its love poetry reflected his  happiness in a new relationship. Isaacs was shortly to marry.6 His passionate nature gave rise to brief, sentimental poems filled  with memories and regrets. 'The Orange Flower' is an example. Set  against the 'tideless sea' of the Mediterranean, it evokes his carefree  youth. The harsh realities of his life in Australia did not inspire him to  eulogise colonial scenery in a similar way: 'Twas by the blue and tideless sea, Calm as the Heaven that shone above; But what was Heaven or earth to me When I saw Dora, fairest dove, My only love? (Isaacs, Not for Sale, 30) Isaacs responded in rhyme to current events at home and abroad.  He had personally experienced revolutionary fervour in France in 1848,  and was inspired by the ongoing fight for Italian independence. He  rallied the Adelaide citizenry to this international cause with his poems  'Garibaldi: a Rhapsody' (which was first published on 1 September 1860  in the Register) and the rousing 'Viva L'Italia: a Voice from Australia',  which first appeared in his self-published Colonial Lyrics No. 2 in 1859: Awaken, Italia! The land of the glorious, The Cradle of Art, and the Fountain of Song! 6 Once again, Isaacs chose a much younger partner, 24-year-old Eliza Rice. </page> <page sequence="15"> George Isaacs in Adelaide 53 As your aim is impassioned, so be it victorious, To Italians may Italy ever belong! Irrespective of quality, his poems are heartfelt and responsive, none more  so than the Critic's poignant 'We all would do Better when we Grow  Grey' (11 October 1862, 12) in which he confronts his mortality: Grey! Grey! Am I getting grey? Yes, it is so, grey I am getting; Passions, like ravenous birds of prey, Have swooped on my heart, in its blood their beaks whetting: And have left on my temples the print of their feet, And have left the rush of their wings in my brain, And have left my soul sickened amidst my defeat— In the past no memorial, the future no gain. I used my youth as a thing to endure; I used my manhood as not to fade out; I played with my love as a thing secure, And I looked on all men as a rabble and rout, The whom I would bend and mould to my will, In the pride of my knowledge and force of my skill. But now I am grey; wearied and grey— And little I care for the things that were. I have squandered my morning, have wasted my day. Gave no thought to the night when the world was gay We all would do better when we grow grey. Isaacs's prose during the 1860s, like his poetry, is woven throughout  his previously-mentioned newspapers, the Critic (1862-63) and the Licensed  Victualler (1869-70), his journal Number One (1861), his books Rhyme and  Prose (1865) and Not for Sale (1869) and other colonial publications. His  short imaginative tales, with their oddly-named characters and happy  endings, are somewhat contrived, in contrast to the charm and insight  evident in his autobiographical stories such as 'Without a Passport' (Not  for Sale, 31) or 'How We Fared When Hard-up in Paris' (Number One, 11).  That description of the youthful misadventures of Isaacs and his friend  </page> <page sequence="16"> 54 Anne Black 'Harry R' (the illustrator W. Harry Rogers) in Paris provides a premonition  of Isaacs's later financial difficulties—and perhaps a reason for them.  He impulsively pursued his ambitions, whether tempted by desirable  antiques (as described in 'How we Fared') or, later, by the possibility of  literary fame. Strangely, following the publication of The Queen of the South in  the previous decade, Isaacs did not attempt another novel. Perhaps  during the 1860s he recognised his writing limitations, or more probably  he no longer had the freedom, means or stamina to attempt such a  lengthy and financially unrewarding exercise. He was also well aware of  the colonists' preference for European rather than Australian novels.  Instead, he concentrated on shorter prose. Isaacs's gift for writing  concisely is best appreciated in his contributions to his own and other  colonial newspapers. His rapidly composed editorials, incisive reviews,  commentaries on current events and prolific (and frequently aggrieved)  'letters to the editor' enlivened the Adelaide press. Isaacs made a determined effort to live as an independent writer  in Adelaide during the 1860s, but he was unable to support himself  or his family on the proceeds of this work.7 His newspapers, poetry,  stories and plays from that time display his versatility, but their irregular  appearances failed to produce a steady income. This led to insolvency  and imprisonment. Hampered by factors such as ill-health, a conservative  public and press, poor remuneration, a lack of copyright and the need for  other employment, Isaacs remained optimistic in his quest to entertain  and inform. Contemporary reviews make it clear that his status as a  littérateur was recognised and that his works were appreciated. But life  was clearly tough for a writer in colonial society. Despite these difficulties,  George Isaacs made a significant contribution to Adelaide's early literary  scene. 7 Of necessity, during this decade Isaacs was also a clerk, a theatrical agent and (most  unlikely for a man who had been jailed for insolvency on three occasions) an accountant.  None of these occupations appear to have provided him with financial stability. </page> <page sequence="17"> George Isaacs in Adelaide 55 WOrks CiTed Isaacs, George.
