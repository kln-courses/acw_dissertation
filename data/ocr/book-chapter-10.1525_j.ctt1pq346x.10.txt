<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> Part Two The Postcolonial Era </page> <page sequence="2">  </page> <page sequence="3"> 4Divergent Standards of Excellence The historiography of the postcolonial period in Sri Lanka overwhelmingly dis- cusses how the Sri Lankan government began to systematically espouse a vision  of a majority nation of Sinhala-speaking Buddhists after S. W. R. D. Bandaranaike  became the fourth prime minister in 1956.1 The vision of a Sinhalese Buddhist  nation reflected the very constituency who had mobilized to vote Bandaranaike  into power. The 1956 election was the first election in Sri Lanka determined by the  strength of a nearly unanimous vote by the Sinhalese Buddhist masses.2 Between  1956 and 1965 the Buddhist rural voter became, to a much greater extent, the arbi- ter of Sri Lankan politics.3 As if to reward his supporters, Bandaranaike established the Ministry of Cul- tural Affairs in 1956. The ministry offered state funds to assist in the revival of Sin- halese art, literature, and Buddhism. Two months after his victory Bandaranaike  assuaged the vociferous campaigns for “Sinhala Only” and enacted the Official  Language Act, which switched the state language from English to Sinhala. The act  stipulated how to change the language of the bureaucracy to Sinhala within four  years and six months.4 One fact often omitted from the historiography of this period is that the Of- ficial Language Act was passed only one year after Sri Lanka became a member  of the United Nations. The internal political and sociolinguistic transformation of  Sri Lanka in the late 1950s was not isolated from external forces, such as what Im- manuel Wallerstein describes as the “gravitational force” to join the world-system  of nation-states.5 For most countries, joining the United Nations was impetus to  maintain certain naturalized features of nation-states. Within the world-system,  for example, every nation would necessarily comprise a majority that possessed a  77 </page> <page sequence="4"> 78    The Postcolonial Era national culture, history, economy, territory, and language. In Sri Lanka’s case Ban- daranaike likely believed that elevating the language of the majority, Sinhala, to the  status of official language was as progressive a step as nationalizing the economy. Within the country Bandaranaike’s staunch support for Sinhalese Buddhist cul- ture appealed to a wide cross-section of the Sinhala-educated population, which  included Buddhist monks, Ayurvedic physicians, village headmen, teachers who  worked in Sinhala-language schools, landed peasants, and youth educated in the  Sinhala language, as well as Sinhalese journalists, minor officials, notaries, petition  writers, and small businessmen.6 The poets and songwriters discussed in part 2  hailed from these segments of the population, predominantly a Buddhist middle- class group. In English this demographic group is often referred to as the rural  elite, revivalist elite, or rural intelligentsia. Although it is well known within Sri Lankan studies how Bandaranaike’s   Sinhalese Buddhist nationalism favored the Sinhalese, discriminated against  Sri   Lanka’s minorities, and ignited ethnic conflict among the Sinhalese and  Sri Lankan  Tamils, Anglophone scholars have only begun to investigate Sinhala ra- dio song and poetry composed in the immediate aftermath of Bandaranaike’s vic- tory and enactment of the Official Language Act. Regarding song, Anne Sheeran  explores the “gradual dominance of Sinhala interest at Radio Ceylon” and argues  that a great deal of the discourses that the radio station produced about Sinhala  music in the 1950s focused on the idea that the Sinhalese lacked their own unique  style of music. Jim Sykes suggests that when the Sinhalese elites at the radio station  fashioned Sinhala music, they excluded not only minority communities but also  the music of the berava, the low caste of Sinhalese Buddhist ritual musicians who  performed a sophisticated form of music and dance. According to Sykes, elites at  the radio station tacitly discriminated against the berava and propagated the idea  that their music was a form of Sinhalese “culture,” but not a suitable source for  new Sinhalese “music.”7 Sykes’s and Sheeran’s studies are important because they  emphasize the discourses and practices of exclusion that accompanied the cre- ation of Sinhala radio music. Yet they are insufficient because they do not provide  translations of songs produced at this time. Lacking analyses of the texts of Sinhala  songs at a pivotal moment in the history of Sri Lanka is problematic for Sri Lankan  studies and scholars interested in the comparative study of cultural production in  twentieth-century South Asia. In this chapter I explore how the late 1950s witnessed the emergence of two  genres of Sinhala song and poetry that had no precedent in Sri Lanka: the radio  opera and free verse. The inventors’ new terms for these genres—gīta nāṭakaya  (radio opera) and nisaňdäs kāvya (free verse)—symbolized the originality of their  creations. Gīta nāṭakaya, a musical genre created specifically for radio broadcast,  marked a distinct break with nurthi and gramophone song, while nisaňdäs kāvya  announced a rupture with first- and second-generation Colombo poetry. </page> <page sequence="5"> Divergent Standards of Excellence    79 Gīta nāṭakaya and nisaňdäs kāvya were more elite than they were popular. The  men who composed the first radio operas and poems in free verse were not moti- vated to sell their works for commercial gain. They produced these forms of song  and poetry for the idealistic sake of “raising the standards” of Sinhala song and  poetry. The inventors of these genres were highly educated and award-winning  intellectuals, and the Sinhalese audience they wrote for was the educated constitu- ency. As will become clear in this chapter, the two genres were difficult to appreci- ate without training in (Sinhala and English) literature or (North Indian classical)  music. In what follows I juxtapose the lives and works of the pioneers of the r adio  opera, Chandrarathna Manawasinghe (1913–64) and Wimal Abeysundara  (1921–2008), with the life and work of the creator of Sinhala free verse, Siri   Gunasinghe (b. 1925). The chapter commences with an analysis of the aesthet- ics in Manawasinghe’s, Abeysundara’s, and Gunasinghe’s earliest works. I sub- sequently attempt to explain their aesthetic differences and similarities through  the lens of their education, institutional base, and criticisms of their predeces- sors’ song and poetry. Theoretically, the chapter is concerned with a process that Sheldon Pollock  terms “cosmopolitan vernacularism.” As discussed in the introduction, cosmopol- itan vernacularism describes how actors deploy a local language in new ways when  they localize literature that is “superposed” and “cosmopolitan.” “Cosmopolitan”  refers to an elite form of culture that travels outside its site of origin. “Superposed”  alludes to the process of “superposition,” when new local genres develop in reac- tion to dominating forms of preexistent literatures.8 In Pollock’s case study cosmopolitan vernacularism is a relatively uniform pro- cess: after the first millennium, regional poets throughout South Asia facilitated  the superposition of Sanskrit literary aesthetics and techniques onto their respec- tive regional language and thereby gave birth to new premodern vernacular lit- eratures in languages such as Kannada, Telugu, Marathi, Tamil, Gujarati, Newari,  Nepali, and Sinhala.9 The case of cosmopolitan vernacularism in the gīta nāṭakaya  and nisaňdäs kāvya is different because one finds in these genres attempt to follow  two divergent standards of excellence, which I label “neoclassical” and “modern- ist,” respectively. The neoclassical aesthetic measured itself against models of excellence from  North Indian medieval Sanskrit literature as well as North Indian art music. The  modernist aesthetic sought to be comparable with the English verse of poets like  T. S. Eliot and Robert Frost. Inspired by Ezra Pound’s credo to “make it new” mod- ernist Sinhala poets searched for value in undervalued areas of experience in Sri  Lanka.10 This chapter is therefore a clear example of the triadic model of influ- ence in which Sri Lankan songwriters and poets attempted to create works that  responded both to the West and to India. </page> <page sequence="6"> 80    The Postcolonial Era NEOCLASSICAL AESTHETICS IN THE RADIO OPERA Manawasinghe’s “Manōhāri” In the United States the adjective classical is often used to describe Greek and  Roman literature, as well as European art music. In Sri Lanka, however, educated  Sinhalese people often accord a similar status to Sanskrit literature and North   Indian Hindustani music. To describe the aesthetic Manawasinghe and Abeysun- dara championed in their radio operas—Sanskrit literature, Indian mythology,  and Hindustani music—I thus use the term neoclassical for the way that the radio  operas sought to mobilize such classical forms for the present. Sri Lanka’s national radio station, Radio Ceylon, aired the first radio opera  on December 8, 1955. Its author, Chandrarathna Manawasinghe (fig. 4), titled it  Manōhāri, the name he gave to the fictional princess character. The radio opera was Manawasinghe’s attempt to convey the feeling of a dēva  katā, mythological stories about Hindu gods found in Sanskrit literature.11 The  story of Manōhāri was mythological in the sense that each character in the radio  opera represented a natural force in the universe. Consider the opening scene: Narrator: Bestowing onto nature anthropomorphic forms,  Chandrarathna Manawasinghe has composed a dēva  katā in song. To facilitate understanding, we will first  present to you a list that explains what the characters  of this musical drama represent: Princess Manōhāri [represents] Universal Beauty King Jagatpati [represents] The Universe Sōma Kumaru [represents] The Moon Divāpati [represents] The Sun Soldier Beams [represents] The Rays of the Sun Manōhāri’s Servant Hēmantā [represents] The Misty Season12 On the left side are characters and their roles: Manōhāri is the princess, Jagatpati  the king, Sōma Kumaru is Manōhāri’s lover, and Divāpati is her groom-to-be in  an arranged marriage. On the right side, one finds the forces of nature that each  character represents. Manōhāri represents universal beauty. Jagatpati symbolizes  the universe. Sōma Kumaru signifies the moon. Divāpati personifies the sun. Because each character symbolized a force of nature, character interactions  further suggested such forces at play in nature. When Sōma Kumaru (the moon)  and Divāpati (the sun) fought over the hand of princess Manōhāri (the beauty of  the universe), their clash simultaneously appeared to represent the passage from  night to day. In this way, the radio opera contained elements of a poetic flight of  fancy that Sanskrit theorists referred to as utprekṣā, a literary device often involv- ing anthropomorphosis, in which one maintains a “dual” awareness to identify the  </page> <page sequence="7"> Divergent Standards of Excellence    81 Figure 4.

Hēmantā  A maidservant Holding a royal position, Consoled Manōhāri14 In the first stanza Manawasinghe described Manōhāri as the daughter of King   Jagatpati. At first glance the description seemed to explain that the King was the  princess’s father. Manōhāri, however, represented the beauty of the universe. Her  father Jagatpati was that universe. The concept of “father,” then, had more con- ceptual complexity: a father begets his daughter like the universe “begets” beauty.  An educated listener, familiar with such allusion in poetry, could experience these  dual meanings while listening to the radio opera. Further possible dual meanings can be read in the next scene. Here, Manawas- inghe may have meant for the rendezvous between Princess Manōhāri (universal  beauty) and her lover, Sōma Kumaru (the moon), on the castle verandah of King  Jagatpati (the universe) to symbolize, in a broad fashion, the aesthetic beauty of  the moon in our universe: Narrator: Manōhāri and Sōma Kumaru’s passionate rendezvous  on the verandah of Jagatpati’s castle. Sōma: My Manōhāri  Renowned daughter of Jagatpati,  In my eyes you shine  O Gandharva deity! Manōhāri: Dearest Sōma,  The birds silent in the night  Now rise singing song  In the morning light Sōma: Just a glimpse of your tender face  And flowers smile in bloom.  Who could alight from a pädda boat  Wade alone in the floret lagoon? Manōhāri: I will leave with you and depart from castle lands.  How can I possibly bear  To be alone when  My heart is in your hands?15 </page> <page sequence="9"> Divergent Standards of Excellence    83 When the Soldiers of Divāpati (rays of the sun) threatened to end the rendezvous  of Manōhāri (universal beauty) and Sōma Kumaru (the moon), one can imagine  at the same time that beauty and the moon must “separate” when the morning rays  of the sun come out: Sōma: Then let us not delay! As Divāpati Soldier Beams  Take post on the castle floor  Once the conch reaches our ears  We will not get out the door16 Behind Manawasinghe’s enjoyment of Sanskrit verse and Indian mythology— which found ample expression in Manōhāri—was also a belief that North I ndian  culture formed a foundation for Sinhalese literature. In a radio lecture he  delivered  circa 1957, Manawasinghe remarked, “The [Sinhala] poetic tradition has been  greatly influenced by Sanskrit literary culture. [Sanskrit literary characters such  as] the Brahmin, the cupid, and the goddess Saraswati are routinely found in   Sinhala verse.”17 Wimal Abeysundara’s “Niṣādī” Wimal Abeysundara, Manawasinghe’s successor at Radio Ceylon, also wrote  about the links between Sinhalese and Indian culture. He asserted that ancient  connections between music cultures of India and Sri Lanka could be parsed  out through study of Sri Lankan historical literature, such as the Pali-language  Mahāvaṃsa, written in the fifth century c.e.; and the Cūḷavaṃsa, composed in  the thirteenth century. Abeysundara wrote, “Culturally, one cannot separate Sri  Lanka from India. Studies have proven that our cultures have been connected  for more than 2500 years. It is not incorrect to say that musically, too, the same  applies. Sinhala sources like the Mahāvaṃsa and Cūḷavaṃsa, as well as classi- cal Sinhala literature, clearly illustrate ancient links between Sinhala music and   Indian classical music.”18 Abeysundara’s knowledge of Indian classical music was based on research he  conducted in North India in the late 1950s and early 1960s. His research culmi- nated in his 1963 publication of an encyclopedic five-volume tome, Sangīta Sanhitā  (Music compilations). The work covered ancient Indian music (sangīta purāṇa),  Indian song (gīta vēda), North and South Indian instrumental music (vādya  vēda), Indian dance (nṛtya vēda), and Indian aesthetics and modern Indian mu- sic (bharata bhāṣya). There were prior publications in Sinhala on Indian classical  music, such as M. G. Perera’s 1933 Gīta Śikṣaka. But nothing was comparable in  scope or breadth to this study, nearly two thousand pages long. Organizing his  bibliography according to language, he cited forty-four Sanskrit primary sources  and Pali texts such as the Mahāvaṃsa, as well as a plethora of modern sources in  Hindi, Sinhala, and English. </page> <page sequence="10"> 84    The Postcolonial Era Abeysundara channeled his interest in North Indian music into his first radio  opera, Niṣādī, which aired around 1958. As Abeysundara noted, the  thematic inspi- ration for the radio opera was the biographies of North Indian classical  musicians:  “I composed ‘Niṣādī’ with a strong love of Indian classical music. The libretto is  an original work of fiction. I read the ancient biographies of great Indian classical  musicians like Narada, Hanuman, Bharata, Kohala, Dattila, and M atanga, as well  as the biographies of later musicians like Jayadeva, Swami Haridas,  Tansen, Amir  Khusrou, Gopala Nayaka, Baiju Bawra, Vilas Khan, and Mira Bhai. The foun- dation for composing ‘Niṣādī’ is based on the influences I obtained from these  biographies.”19 Abeysundara’s readings ranged from the mythological stories of  Narada—the Vedic sage who was a master of the ancient Indian veena—to the  iconic thirteenth-century figure of Amir Khusrou, who, legends state, introduced  the sitar into North India. Abeysundara summarize the plot of Niṣādī in this way: There once lived an artistic young man named Manjula who desired to obtain train- ing in classical music. Although he went to various teachers, he felt unsatisfied. He  decided to travel to Brindavan to try to study music with the sage Tumbaru. Tum- baru of Brindavan had reached the brink of musical knowledge. He could even suc- cessfully perform miracles using music. Manjula is now traveling to Brindavan to  study with this sage. If he gets the opportunity to study with Tumbaru, he knows that  he too will become a master of music. While journeying in the jungle, Manjula comes to the bank of the river, and sees  seven “note princesses.” Mesmerized by their tonal beauty, he falls in love with the  youngest, Niṣādī. Madly in love with Niṣādī, he starts to sing a song. However, [be- cause he lacks serious musical training, his singing has a negative effect and] Niṣādī  immediately falls dead to the ground. Manjula and the other six princesses gather  around Niṣādī and start crying. Tumbaru hears the crying, comes to the riverbank,  and starts singing. In an instant Nishadi wakes up from death. At her request, Tum- baru accepts Manjula as a disciple. Nishadi and Manjula depart for Tumbaru’s her- mitage in Brindavan.20 In the radio opera’s opening song Abeysundara praised the attributes of Sarawasti,  through a fusion of Sanskrit literary motifs and Sinhala poetry. For instance, here  is the Sinhala lyric found in the chorus: hānsa vāhini gītadhāri vandanā svara gum gumāvī gīta mānasa rāja hansī oba soyā mama āmi āmī21 [Queen of Song alight upon the Hamsa swan! I search and search for your abode, where sound reverberates] An analysis of these lines of poetry reveals Abeysundara’s thorough knowledge of  Sanskrit and Sinhala literature. He glorified the goddess Saraswati, as she is clas- sically portrayed in Sanskrit literature. Abeysundara’s use of the word mānasa in  </page> <page sequence="11"> Divergent Standards of Excellence    85 the phrase gīta mānasa rāja hansī can be interpreted in at least two ways. Manas  can denote “mind.” Here Abeysundara may have meant to say that Saraswati pos- sesses the very mind of song (gīta mānasa). But he also could have used the word  in its other meaning, referring to the manas sarovar, a Sanskrit literary term con- noting the sacred Himalayan lake created by Brahma, which is the summer abode  of Saraswati’s vehicle, the swan. In that sense, the protagonist in Niṣādī would be  saying that he is searching for Saraswati’s abode. Such literary lexicon is not the only the reason I refer to the gīta nāṭakaya as a  “neoclassical” art form. The poetic meter and music are also factors. Abeysundara  composed the text of this song in a meter he described as being a “blend between  a Sanskrit poetic meter and a Sinhala poetic meter used to recite raban pada.”22  (Raban pada are verses customarily recited by women who simultaneously drum  on the large raban frame drum at Sinhalese New Year festivals in April.) Given the  fact that mastery of poetic meters was one important way in which Sanskrit poets  displayed their poetic prowess, it is not surprising that Abeysundara displayed his  own erudition through songs written in poetic meters that he created. The neoclassical aesthetics of the gīta nāṭakaya can also be studied in terms of  the North Indian art music featured in Manawasinghe’s and Abeysundara’s radio  operas. Composer P. Dunstan de Silva, for instance, set Manawasinghe’s songs in  Manōhāri to various North Indian rāgas. De Silva, a flutist, was the third Sinhalese  musician (after Lionel Edirisinghe and Sunil Santha) to receive a Sangeet Visha- rada degree from the Marris College of Music in Lucknow.23 Lionel Edirisinghe  composed the music for Abeysundara’s Niṣādī. Edirisinghe was the first musician  from Sri Lanka to obtain the Sangeet Visharada from Marris College. Edirisinghe  had also spent nearly thirteen years in North India, studying Hindustani classical  music under the guidance of sitarist Ravi Shankar’s well-known teacher, Allaudin  Khan.24 Concerning the musical setting for Niṣādī, Abeysundara explained, Because Niṣādī is based on a subject pertaining to classical music, I felt that the  songs should reflect the topic and be of the highest quality. Lionel Edirisinghe set  the libretto to music. I have named the main character Niṣādī, after the seventh  note of the Indian musical scale: sa, ri, ga, ma, pa, dha, ni. Therefore, those who  know [ Hindustani] music well can hear how Edirisinghe chose raga melodies that   emphasize this note. He has composed songs based on the ragas from all eight me- las [families of North Indian rāgas], i.e., Yaman, Bilawal, Khamaj, Bhairava, Purvi,  Marwa, Kafi, and Asavari.25 Abeysundara described how Lionel Edirisinghe created the music of Niṣādī by  exploiting the musical uniqueness found in the eight major families of Hindustani  rāgas. Abeysundara even named the heroine of the radio opera—Niṣādī—after the  seventh note of Indian music, ni. To symbolize this character, Edirisinghe com- posed music that emphasized this note. </page> <page sequence="12"> 86    The Postcolonial Era MODERNIST AESTHETICS IN SINHALA FREE VERSE I have demonstrated how the cosmopolitan vernacularism of Manawasinghe’s  Manōhāri and Abeysundara’s Niṣādī could be described as neoclassical because  of the manner in which they channeled into local song cosmopolitan forms like  Hindustani art music and literary devices and imagery from Sanskrit literature.  The cosmopolitan vernacularism in Siri Gunasinghe’s poetry was quite different  because Gunasinghe drew on the English-language verse of modernist poets from  England and the United States. In this section I analyze Gunasinghe’s first book  of poetry, Mas Lē Näti Äṭa, which literally means “Bloodless, Fleshless Bones.”26 Siri Gunasinghe was surprised when critics asked whether he modeled the five- part suite in Mas Lē Näti Äṭa after T. S. Eliot’s five-part structure in The Waste Land.  Gunasinghe admits that he found Eliot’s The Waste Land inspirational. However,  the fact that Mas Lē Näti Äṭa contained a suite of five poems like The Waste Land  was a coincidence. Be that as it may, Hemamali Gunasinghe wrote this to me about  her husband: “In the late 1930s and early 1940s when he [Siri Gunasinghe] was de- veloping his interest in creative writing, poetry, and criticism, Eliot was a colossus  in the literary world, stimulating and firing up writers and critics.”27 Gunasinghe designated the style of his free-verse poetry as nisaňdäs kāvya,  which literally means “poetry without meter.”28 Nisaňdäs kāvya was free from  not only poetic meters but also other defining features of Sinhala poetry, such as  quatrains and eli samaya (a like-phoneme at the end of each line of a quatrain).  Gunasinghe considered his poetry as a type of kāvya but his style contradicted  the very definition of the term kāvya, a definition that had never before been so  powerfully questioned in Sri Lanka. Kāvya was supposed to be an aesthetically  rich composition in poetic meters. Sagara Palansuriya had written even as late as  1951 that one defining feature of kāvya was gītavat bava (nature of song).29 What  Palansuriya meant was that kāvya was a form of expression articulated in poetic  meters, which created rhythms and imbued poetry with the nature of song. Gunasinghe’s free verse also had no parallel in Sinhala poetry with regard to  tone, syntax, lexicon, and even orthography. Gunasinghe sought to make literary  Sinhala more colloquial in orthography. He did not use the mūrdhaja letters in  Sinhala. The mūrdhaja nayanna (K) and layanna (&lt;) were used only in written  language and pronounced the same way as the dantaja nayanna (k) and layanna  (,). Gunasinghe used only the dantaja letters in an effort to reduce the difference  between spoken and written Sinhala. Gunasinghe’s nisaňdäs poetry was thus very controversial, especially the five- poem suite that opened Mas Lē Näti Äṭa. One reason was that his language had  close connections with Western “prior texts” at a time in which Sinhalese B uddhist  nationalism was at a high pitch. A. L. Becker designates “prior texts” as an “ aggregate  of remembered and half-remembered prior texts, which are there to be evoked.”30  Gunasinghe’s verse sparked heated debates because Sinhala intellectuals expected  poets to borrow or elaborate on prior texts in the form of well-known tropes of  </page> <page sequence="13"> Divergent Standards of Excellence    87 figurative language from Sinhala or Sanskrit poetry.31 Sinhala poets could intensify  the metaphors but never overthrow them. The situation, it appears, was similar to  the scenario of Sanskrit poetry that Yigal Bronner describes: “Even in the absence  of an explicit and thorough theory of what can be compared with what, Sanskrit  writers came up with a relatively closed set of subjects and standards of compari- son that could be paired. Informed by this shared notion of aesthetic and moral  decorum, readers could immediately tell an unsuitable combination, such as the  comparison of a faithful servant with a dog rather than with a friend, or a firefly  with the sun rather than with a lamp.”32 Gunasinghe was an avid reader of Sinhala verse, wrote his doctoral dissertation  about Sanskrit treatises, and taught Sanskrit literature at the University of Ceylon.  He thus intimately knew the tropes that the traditional literati expected poets to  employ. Instead, he introduced images undervalued in Sinhala literary culture.  Hemamali Gunasinghe, for instance, explores how Siri Gunasinghe worked with  the image of a cigarette at a time when no Sinhala poets had made any such at- tempt.33 In the poem “Kāntāraya” (The desert), for instance, a burning cigarette  symbolized burnt-out hope. In the poem “Noliyavena Kaviya” (The poem that de- fies writing, 1958), Gunasinghe compared whirling smoke rings from cigarettes  to the poetry that whirled in his mind. In the poem “Pilun Gaňda” (Stale odors),  Gunasinghe wrote, No amount of cigarette smoke Will ever halt that stench. Here, Gunasinghe criticized the “futile attempt (of phony pundits) to mask the  stale stench (of regurgitated learning) with cigarette smoke (a veneer of sophisti- cation).”34 Gunasinghe also subverted previously entrenched symbolic associations in tra- ditions of Sinhala and Sanskrit poetry. In the poem “Ambalama” (The wayfarer’s  rest, 1958) Gunasinghe used the “image of a wayfarers’ rest not to symbolize tran- sience as is done traditionally, but to signify poverty of thought.” In the poem  “Iňdul Vatura” (Dishwater, 1958) he wrote about education, but not to stress its  importance. He criticized people who worship mere fact finding: The human intellect is a kitchen, Its dishwater, Education. Groveling there, I lap it up.35 Most Sri Lankan readers’ first encounter with Sinhala free verse was with the first  poem in Bleached Bones, “The Invisible Light”: Shattering the darkness Just like yesterday Why haven’t you risen yet My diurnal eyesore?36 </page> <page sequence="14"> 88    The Postcolonial Era The unidentified narrator posed this question to the sun, calling it a “diurnal eyesore”  (magē dainika äs rudāva).37 This metaphor puzzled readers accustomed to Sinhala  poems that spoke of the sun to convey positive messages about the beautiful morn- ing. The sun had never been described in Sinhala poetry as a daily eyesore. Because  Gunasinghe’s metaphor did not evoke any Sinhala-language prior texts, one year  after Bleached Bones was published, novelist and scholar Martin Wickramasinghe  wrote, “When there exist many other synonyms for sun to choose from in the Sin- hala language, scholars would certainly agree that this is not an effective metaphor.”38 In the next lines, Gunasinghe created another idea that also had no precedent  in Sinhala literature. He likened the narrator to a helpless snail in a shell who must  avoid the painful sunlight: Letting the mosquito swarms drone on Swaddled in darkness As within a snail’s shell I lay waiting For the earth’s second day To come streaming down.39 Because Hemamali Gunasinghe has clearly translated these lines, readers of this  English translation can today accept as mere background information the fact that  the narrator lets the “mosquito swarms drone on.” The mosquitoes function as  a symbol of the cruel external world. But the ambiguous Sinhala-language word  order in these lines confused even the most adept readers, like Wickramasinghe,  who thought Gunasinghe was attempting to symbolize the darkness as a drone of  mosquitoes. Wickramasinghe even went as far as to suggest to Gunasinghe how to  rewrite this phrase for clarity.40 The narrator knows that darkness will soon give way to dawn. He waits in dread  because the sunlight will soon pain his eyes. The darkness, on the other hand,  comforts him. The light awakens terror, The glare torments the eye. No shape or beauty can I see In anything; Nothing has beauty or shape To see. To ward off the piercing light With my hand I shield My eyes.41 The darkness, though, is more than just comforting: the narrator desperately cries  out for its embrace: </page> <page sequence="15"> Divergent Standards of Excellence    89 Hold me, hold me Tenderly hold me, Darkness, my only love, Hold me tenderly.42 In a personal communication, Siri Gunasinghe contrasted the narrator’s desire for  escape in Bleached Bones to the character in Robert Frost’s “Stopping by Woods  on a Snowy Evening” (1923), who many readers interpreted as wanting to escape  death. The speaker in “The Unseen Light” [The Invisible Light] implores the darkness, his  only love/beloved (sondura)  .  .  . to engulf/embrace him, since “the light” terrifies  him. Like [Robert] Frost’s speaker in “On Stopping by Woods . . . ,” the speaker in this  excerpt too is seeking escape, but not necessarily death.43 Gunasinghe placed his poem in dialogue with the interpretation that Robert Frost’s  “On Stopping by Woods” is about a desire for death. Yet if the character wanted es- cape, yet not from death, as Gunasinghe wrote, what kind of escape did he desire?  It seems that the character sought to escape from the cruel outside world. Many  scholars of modern Sinhala literature have proposed various interpretations about  the character’s hatred of light but love for darkness. Wickramasinghe maintained  that the character’s predicament symbolized the victory of ignorance (darkness)  over wisdom (the sun). Dipachandi Abeysinghe argued that the sun represented  difficulties in life and thus Gunasinghe meant to draw attention to how people hate  to face their problems. Tissa Kariyavasam contended that the narrator could not  stand to face the harsh truth (the sun) of his past, present, and future. Piyasili Wi- jegunasinghe interpreted the scenario as a broad symbol of the tragic experience  of modern humans in the industrial age of capital.44 What we do know for a fact is that Gunasinghe’s narrator spoke in a coded  language filled with suggestions about the futility of life. Consider this later stanza: In the bitter cold of life, The whole body shivers, chattering, Like a cat slipped in a stream. The mouse has scuttled across.45 Gunasinghe illuminated the symbolism in this explanation: “The ‘wet cat’ image in  ‘The Unseen Light’ . . . is a familiar metaphor for someone in distress when out of  his/her element. As you know it is generally believed that cats don’t like water and  they are terrible swimmers. In the cat and mouse image in the poem the cat—cold  and wet—out of his element—has also lost its quarry; the mouse, stereotypically  the hapless victim, has successfully evaded its hunter. The metaphor is an attempt  to create the image of one beaten down and defeated by the (numbing) vagaries of  Life.”46 Because Gunasinghe’s poetry required this type of decoding, Gunasinghe’s  </page> <page sequence="16"> 90    The Postcolonial Era contemporary Gunadasa Amarasekera derogatorily designated his works as gūtha  tēravili (mysterious puzzles).47 In the final image Gunasinghe alluded to a quotation from the fifteenth-century  Lōväḍa Saňgarāwa (The world’s welfare) written by the Sinhala poet and Buddhist  monk Vidagama Maitreya, who sought to transmit the Pali-language scriptures  through Sinhala verse: “The dog gnaws at bleached bones And finds no satisfaction”48 But Gunasinghe subverted the message: “The dog gnaws at bleached bones” And finds satisfaction.49 I give Hemamali Gunasinghe the final word about this revision: The last two lines of the final part, “Rebirth,” quote the final couplet of the classical  [Pali-language] verse that inspired the title, creating a form of closure, but with a  twist. The original metaphor (for life and humanity) says “dogs gnaw at bleached  bones but find no satisfaction in it [no labannē].” Siri has changed it to read “find sat- isfaction”—[läba gannē]. You will see the absence of quotation marks around these  two words. This questions but does not reject the conventional view of the futility of  life, yet does not give up on life. There is still some sustenance there though meager;  the choices are not black and white.50 For what reasons and in what ways did the creators of Sinhala free verse and the  radio opera produce these divergent forms of cosmopolitan vernacularism? To an- swer this question I now attempt to account for their differences through a com- parison of their education, institutional base, and criticisms of their predecessors’  song and poetry. EDUCATION The issue of education explains, to a great extent, the reasons for Manawasinghe’s  and Abeysundara’s neoclassical tendency compared with Gunasinghe’s modern- ist aesthetic. The former had schooled in Buddhist institutions. Manawasinghe  studied at four Buddhist temples, and Abeysundara at one of the country’s major  Buddhist educational centers (piriveṇa) for monks and laymen. Gunasinghe, in  contrast, studied at one of the top English secondary schools in Sri Lanka. Manawasinghe was born in a village named Puwakdandawe, in southern Sri  Lanka. In 1924, at the age of eleven, he was ordained as a Buddhist novice monk at  one of the major temples in the village, the Panchathūpārāmaya Temple.51 While  residing at the temple, he nurtured his literary talents. He read medieval Sinhala  poetry composed by poets who lived between the fourteenth and seventeenth cen- </page> <page sequence="17"> Divergent Standards of Excellence    91 tury, such as Toṭagāmuve Śrī Rāhula, Vidagama Maitreya, Karatoṭa Dharmarāma,  Kirama Dhammānanda, and Alagiyavanna Mukaveti. Manawasinghe described  the temple as a hub for the study and discussion of Sinhala poetry.52 His formal ed- ucation was diverse, ranging from studies in the languages of Sanskrit and Pali to  Sinhala astrology to the composition of Sinhala poetry. His first teacher of Sinhala  poetry was the Venerable Saranankara, the head priest at the Varanagiri residence  for monks in Yatigala, in southern Sri Lanka. Manawasinghe would also visit the  second major Buddhist temple in the village, the Panthārāmaya Temple. Here, he  studied Sanskrit ślōka (verse) with Ven. Mulgirigala Nandarama. Manawasinghe’s appreciation of Sanskrit literature is reflected in an autobio- graphical vignette that details an encounter he had with a woman from Bengal  after he transferred from the Panchathūpārāmaya Temple to a temple nearby the  Kirivehera Temple in Kataragama. She sang Sanskrit verses, which had a spell- binding impact on Manawasinghe: Surrounding my temple, the large forest in Kataragama was a beautiful place. I  roamed along the banks of the river, under the shade of the Kubuk trees, in the  middle of the forest, far away from human contact. There was a small hermitage here  that some referred to as “little Kataragama,” although it was hardly a village or even  a house for that matter. There I had the opportunity to meet a young Bengali woman  who sat by the banks of the river playing the sitar with delicate fingers. She sang  Sanskrit verses from Jayadeva’s [twelfth-century] Gītagovinda (Govinda in song). I  closed my eyes and devoted my full attention to experiencing the rasa of the Sanskrit  verses she sang.53 Manawasinghe’s education was not, however, limited to poetry, Sanskrit, Pali, and  Buddhism. A facet of his sensitivity to letters and sounds chosen for radio operas  can be traced to the 1930s, when Manawasinghe was living at the Aňgurukāramulla  Temple in Negombo. At this time he was reading widely on Ayurvedic medicine  and the occult practices of Sinhala mantras and developed a reputation as a tal- ented writer of set kavi (verses intended to produce well-being) and vas kavi (verses  intended to curse or harm).54 Such poems are composed according to “occult theo- ries” of the Sinhala language. According to the twelfth-century Sidatsaňgarāva, for  example, letters could be grouped into three categories: those associated with hell,  the realm of humans, and the divine. Set kavi always begins with a letter from the  divine category.55 Many Sinhalese Buddhists in Sri Lanka patronized Manawasinghe  to write such poems. His patrons believed his verses took effect immediately after  being recited. For example, Manawasinghe wrote this vas kavi to curse a man named  Sumanatis: O Dadimunda, the god who blows fire, Strangle the throat of my enemy Sumanatis And leave him dying </page> <page sequence="18"> 92    The Postcolonial Era Manawasinghe created this set kavi to heal the sickness of a man named Somakirti: Please help Somakirti get well and give him a long life. For his mind and body, give him peace and banish all the  a strological defects. Please give him all the blessings and heal all of his pain56 Abeysundara, like Manawasinghe, had a traditional Sri Lankan Buddhist educa- tion. He was one of the top students at the Vidyodaya Pirivena. In 1959 Vidyo- daya Pirivena became the University of Sri Jayewardenepura, one of two Buddhist  universities created by an act of Parliament. While Abeysundara was a student  at Vidyodaya, the institution was a Buddhist center for higher education, where  monks and laity obtained what the British referred to as an “oriental” education,  an education with a curriculum traditionally focused primarily on Pali, Sanskrit,  and Sinhala grammar and reading and secondarily on topics such as śastric medi- cine, computation, and astrology.57 At Vidyodaya Abeysundara studied Sanskrit, Pali, and Sinhala, as well as Hindi.  He won an award of distinction and graduated with honors in 1948 at the age of  twenty-seven. Abeysundara also studied English at Ananda College, Aganuvara  Lawrence College, Olcott College, and Pembroke College. Abeysundara would  later complete a master’s degree at Vidyodaya’s competing Buddhist educational  center, Vidyalankara, and win an award for his high score on the notoriously dif- ficult Prāchīna Paṇḍita Vibhāgaya (Oriental Scholars Exam).58 Abeysundara’s and  Manawasinghe’s classical studies in Sanskrit, Pali, and Buddhism—and in Abey- sundara’s case, an interest in Hindi and north Indian culture—clearly shaped their  radio operas themes, lexicon, and even music. Gunasinghe, in contrast, studied at one of the most prestigious English second- ary schools in Sri Lanka: Mahinda College in Galle. He learned Sanskrit and  Pali, but English literature was also a major part of his education. Regarding  his study of Renaissance-era and contemporary English literature, Gunasinghe  remarked, “While I was a student at Mahinda College in Galle, I studied the  poetry collections, novels, and other writings of John Milton, William Shake- speare, T. S. Eliot, W. H. Auden, Stephen Spender, Louis MacNeice, D. H. Law- rence, and James Joyce.”59 Outside of school, Gunasinghe would regularly meet  with his friend Edwin Ariyadasa to read and converse about the modernist  works of Eliot, W. B. Yeats, Auden, and Ezra Pound.60 Note how the syllabus  had changed: whereas the second-generation poets (see chapter 3) had studied  the romantics and Victorians, Gunasinghe read in secondary school the works  of the modernists. Meanwhile, Gunasinghe was equally passionate about the works of second-  generation Sinhala poets. Before Gunasinghe sat for the advanced-level exam to  gain admission to the University of Ceylon (Sri Lanka’s only university at the time),  </page> <page sequence="19"> Divergent Standards of Excellence    93 he had already read the works of many second-generation Colombo poets, such as  P. B. Alwis Perera, Sagara Palansuriya, Mimana Premathilaka, John Rajadasa, and  Wimalaratna Kumaragama.61 Gunasinghe’s unique literary perspective appears to  have stemmed from his comparative perspective on Sinhala and English poetry,  as he stated in an interview: “Taken as a whole, what these [Sinhala-language]  works were about were descriptions of beautiful things like flowers, butterflies, the  moonlight, rainbows, waterfalls, flowing rivers, and women. OK, that’s fine. Yet  after reading English poetry I understood the qualities that [second-generation  Colombo] poetry did not possess.”62 In 1945 Gunasinghe gained admission to the University of Ceylon and con- tinued his study of Sanskrit language and literature. He graduated with first-class  honors in 1948 and was appointed as a lecturer in the Sanskrit Department in  1949. In 1951 Gunasinghe was awarded the University of Ceylon Arts Scholarship  and the government of Ceylon’s University Scholarship for postgraduate studies  abroad.63 He began studying at the School of Oriental Studies of the University of  London but was dissatisfied with his adviser and transferred to the Université de  Paris (the Sorbonne). He wrote his dissertation in French about Indian painting  techniques as explained in the Sanskrit-language śilpa (arts and crafts) manuals.  In France Gunasinghe was exposed to the latest European trends in the arts while  he was working on his dissertation between 1951 and 1955. When he returned to Sri Lanka from Paris in 1955, he resumed work at the Uni- versity of Ceylon, but this time at the new campus in Peradeniya. He described his  initial experience: “My first experience of Peradeniya was a full house of students  and dons behind the granite ornate doors of the Arts Theater. They were watch- ing a famous movie, a Kurosawa or a Satyajit Ray, I cannot remember. . . . It was  exciting. I thought that Peradeniya was avant-garde and not too far behind Paris  (at least as far as the cinema was concerned), which I had left only two weeks back  after five years.”64 That Gunasinghe felt Peradeniya to be as avant-garde as Paris  because of the availability of cosmopolitan films by Akira Kurosawa and Satyajit  Ray further highlights his modernist sensibility compared to his contemporaries’  neoclassical outlook. INSTITUTIONAL BASE Another factor that contributed to the neoclassicism or modernism of Manawas- inghe, Abeysundara, and Gunasinghe was the institutions at which they gave birth  to the Sinhala radio opera and Sinhala free verse, respectively. Manawasinghe and  Abeysundara worked for the government radio station, whereas Gunasinghe cre- ated his style of free verse as a lecturer in the Sanskrit at the University of Ceylon,  graduate student in Paris, and professor of Sanskrit at the Peradeniya campus. Let  </page> <page sequence="20"> 94    The Postcolonial Era us look more closely at the cultures of these institutions in the 1950s, beginning  with the radio station. The political climate of the 1950s that privileged the Sinhalese Buddhist rural  intelligentsia (and discriminated against non-Sinhalese Buddhists) set the stage  for Sinhala music reform at the state radio station, Radio Ceylon.65 Although di- rectors of the station since the 1930s had instituted various projects to improve the  quality of musical programming for the Sinhala-, Tamil-, and English-language  stations, it was in the 1950s when a new emphasis on developing Sinhala mu- sic came into being. It was the first time the directors of the radio station hired  Sinhalese producers, lyricists, composers, and vocalists to fashion Sinhala music  anew rather than Sri Lankan music.66 Such changes were far from insignificant: at  the time radio was quickly becoming the most widespread and powerful form of   media entertainment in the country.67 The new emphasis on developing Sinhala music commenced after M. J. Perera  was hired as the first Sinhalese director of Radio Ceylon in 1952. He launched a  project that aimed to nurture Sinhalese cultural heritage through radio program- ming. Perera wrote, “Those in charge of the development of music, drama, litera- ture, and poetry in a country like Ceylon, have a very serious responsibility at this  time. I am thinking in this context particularly of the Sinhalese section of the public  because that is the section, which is specially confined to this Island, and for whom  no standards can be set up by anybody from abroad.” Perera believed that the Sinha- lese lacked great traditions of music and drama: “We have no traditions in music or  drama. . . . Therefore, this broadcasting station, which can cater to this section of the  people, has a responsibility.”68 Perera arranged meetings to establish standard criteria  for “developing” Sinhalese music. In 1954, for instance, producers of the Sinhala- language division of Radio Ceylon, along with members of the Department of Radio  Broadcasting and the Department of Education, as well as representatives from the  State Arts Institution (Lalita Kalā Āyatanaya), and Lankan Arts Commission (Lankā  Kalā Manḍalaya), reached a unanimous decision that the musicians who should  be tasked to raise the standards of Sinhalese music would have to possess a strong  grounding in both North Indian classical and Sinhala folk music.69 In the thick of discussions about such reform of Sinhala music, Perera, along  with the director of the Sinhala station, Tewis “Meghaduta” Guruge; and the mu- sic director of the Sinhala station, P. Dunstan de Silva conceived in 1955 of a new  type of radio song. It would combine an operatic-type libretto with the music of  North Indian rāgas.70 Guruge called it a gīta nāṭakaya, which literally means “song  drama.” The term is often translated into English as “radio opera.” Guruge invited  Manawasinghe to write the libretto of the first radio opera, which would become  Manōhāri. Later Abeysundara was selected to follow in Manawasinghe’s footsteps. The university, however, was Gunasinghe’s institutional base. As early as 1949,  the year Gunasinghe was appointed as a lecturer in the Sanskrit Department, he  </page> <page sequence="21"> Divergent Standards of Excellence    95 published his first free-verse poem “Āpasuva” (The return, 1949) in Aruna, the  journal of the University Sinhala Society. Before he departed for the School of  Oriental Studies in 1951, he published his second free-verse poem “Īye Soňdura”  (Yesterday’s love) in Aruna.71 While Gunasinghe was abroad, the scholar and playwright E. R. Sarachchandra  was hired in 1952 at the University of Ceylon, Peradeniya. Due to Sarachchandra’s  leadership, the arts faculty became a center for Sinhala literary experimentation.  After commencing to work at Peradeniya, Gunasinghe sensed that the new works  of art that people like Sarachchandra were producing at the university was influ- encing not only the Sinhala-educated population but also the English-education  sectors of society: “[The new forms of art that came out of Peradeniya University]  made the Sinhalese intellectuals see their culture in newer and truer lights. But  equally importantly, if not more so, it made the English-only section of Sri Lankan  society take note of a [Sinhala Buddhist] culture, which many in that sanitized  environment did not know existed.”72 Gunasinghe designed the costumes of Sarachchandra’s groundbreaking drama,  Maname, which premiered in 1956. Maname is routinely cited as a landmark in  Sinhalese drama and, more generally, in Sinhalese arts of the twentieth century.  Reflecting on Gunasinghe’s Westernized friend’s reaction to Sarachchandra’s dra- ma, Gunasinghe made this revealing statement: “When we (I say we because origi- nally it was the Sinhalese Drama Circle of the University of Peradeniya, now for- gotten, that was involved) were doing Maname, a friend of mine belonging to the  English-only Colombo society asked me: ‘I say, what is this, I hear you all are doing  a thing called Maname,’ pronouncing the second ‘A’ as in father and the final ‘E’ si- lent as if Maname was a French word. That is how blissfully ignorant some of them  were.”73 Gunasinghe’s friend lacked knowledge in the Sinhala language and culture  to such an extent that he thought the final syllable in the word “Maname” was  pronounced with a silent “e” as it would be in French. Such assumptions proved  in Gunasinghe’s mind the ignorance of the English-speaking Sinhalese commu- nity in Sri Lanka. One senses that Gunasinghe’s friend had come to realize that  something unique was happening at the University of Peradeniya. The university  context, it appears, fostered a climate that encouraged Gunasinghe to experiment  in literature and ultimately spark a literary controversy in twentieth-century Sri  Lanka through his free verse. CRITICISMS OF PREDECESSORS In this chapter I have centered on how and why the aesthetic championed by   Gunasinghe was different from that of Manawasinghe’s and Abeysundara’s. Yet  one similarity must be emphasized before the chapter’s conclusion: all three men  desired to raise the standards of their respective art forms. </page> <page sequence="22"> 96    The Postcolonial Era Gunasinghe’s desire to raise the standards of Sinhala poetry can be traced to an  English article he wrote in 1950, titled “The New Note in Contemporary Sinhalese  Poetry.” The “new note” in Sinhala poetry, Gunasinghe argued, had been struck by P. B.  Alwis Perera’s The Sugarcane Arrow (see chapter 3). Gunasinghe praised Perera for cre- ating images that “have a compactness and a precision which make them adequately  evocative.” Yet Gunasinghe concluded that the The Sugarcane Arrow, like “most of the  contemporary [Sinhala-language] verse, displays no stamp of real experience, but de- tails out an idealized world, where the authors find inspiration and solace.”74 Gunasinghe likened the relationship between The Sugarcane Arrow and its  reading public to the relationship between a bright doll and a child. Perera, Gunas- inghe argued, cared only to construct a dreamscape with the aid of poetic devices  such as rhyme, assonance, and alliteration. In consequence, Perera had reduced  poetry “to mere verbal music and sentimental weeping.” Even worse, Perera had  shirked his duty to contemplate the modern world. Gunasinghe wrote, “Whenever  the facts of life stand up before him, he shrinks from them and wishes he were  born in a lotus-petal or on the lips of a woman.”75 Not only Perera but also most second-generation Colombo poets, Gunasinghe  suggested, suffered from a “common tendency . . . to escape from the worries of life  and seek solace in the most abstract ideas about nature and her mysterious ways.”  Gunasinghe wrote, Most of the contemporary poets live in an impossible dream world, where one finds  only moonlight, cool waters, flowers, music, and love. . . . For the last ten years, the  same metaphors and similes have been used in the same context, with a slight twist  here and there, and they have ceased to be lively for the reader, and are almost turned  barren. This is mainly due to the fact that the writers lack sincerity in their expression  for the most part. The poets could have very little sincerity as they have had to deal  with themes, which have had the least immediacy to their experience for they were  drawn from an idealized dream world.76 Gunasinghe claimed that second-generation poems lacked in “authenticity” be- cause they never dealt with experiential reality. Gunasinghe thus felt inclined to  turn away from romanticism towards a modernist poetic idiom, which he felt was  more meaningful.77 Manawasinghe and Abeysundara leveled comparable critiques against Sinhala  gramophone song. In 1957, in the preface to his collection of songs lyrics, Kōmala  Rēkhā (Lovely line of destiny), Manawasinghe criticized songwriters who com- posed Sinhala words to Indian film song melodies. He based his criticism on the  grounds that the lyrics were hackneyed, the tunes Indian imports, and the lyr- ics and tunes failed to even match properly. Manawasinghe likened such lyrics to  metal foil added to brass to make it shine: “A lyricist cannot create a powerful song  just by playing around with stock words like ‘gentle,’ ‘shiny,’ ‘moon,’ ‘sky,’ ‘beauti- ful,’ ‘fascinating,’ ‘lovely,’ ‘love,’ or ‘wonderful.’ Words like this are just decorative  </page> <page sequence="23"> Divergent Standards of Excellence    97 material like shiny metal foil. We import brass [the melodies from Indian film  songs] and apply our shiny foil [lyrics] to it.” The final product in Manawasinghe’s  humorous account was a style of music so detestable that it was like the loud noises  farmers produced to drive away animals that damaged their crops: “Such songs are  a nuisance to the ear like the scare-away clappers that drive birds out from lands  that farmers cultivate.  .  .  . Will anyone feel genuine love listening to songs with  words such as ‘My fresh love,’ ‘My sweetheart,’ or ‘Oh my baby’?”78 Further, in Manawasinghe’s judgment, the Sinhalese lyricists who carelessly set  words to Indian melodies had failed to select words and themes that matched the  emotion embedded in the melody’s rhythm and tempo: “Sinhalese lyricists do not  consider whether or not their lyrics have any connection with the tempo, melody,  or rhythm of the tune. In Indian songs we find that the rhythm mirrors the joyful  words. . . . However, Sinhalese lyricists put sad words to a happy melody. Or let’s  say a sad song was popular in India. Our musicians write a love song to that sad  melody.” Radio listeners were thus prevented from experiencing the true power of  song. Manawasinghe asked, “Will anyone truly feel devotion from hearing words  like ‘I’ll fall at your feet,’ ‘I’ll worship you until I achieve nirvana,’ or ‘I will loyally  serve you’?”79 In the 1950s it was still a common practice to compose new lyrics to Indian film  song melodies. The practice, as I mentioned in the introduction, was called vacana  dānavā (“to put words”). The term suggested that Sinhalese songwriters only had to  put words onto an Indian film song’s melody like an unskilled mason clumsily puts  one brick on top of another. Manawasinghe described the process like this: “vacana  dānavā was a term used to describe how lyricists would take the words of a Hindi- language song and replace them with Sinhala-language words that sounded some- what the same.”80 Sunil Ariyaratne explains that such lyrics functioned as a kind of  “lacquer” applied to the melodies of film songs.81 Abeysundara portrayed the emer- gence of the radio opera precisely as a response to the imitative trend in Sinhala ra- dio songs: “Until very recently our singers were accustomed to singing lyrics set to  a lready-composed melodies found in Hindi films. Composing original lyrics, or orig- inal music was a rare phenomenon. . . . Most of the singers were singing imitations of  Hindi film songs. Having their primary objective to create a song form with national  features, Radio Ceylon suspended the following of Hindi film songs and inaugurated  a new form of Sinhala music. The pioneering result was the Sinhala radio opera.”82 CONCLUSION In this chapter I explored divergent instances of cosmopolitan vernacularism in  Sri Lanka through the prism of two postcolonial aesthetic tendencies. One faced  North India. The other looked toward England and the United States. The creators  of the gīta nāṭakaya measured it against the standards of Sanskrit literature and  </page> <page sequence="24"> 98    The Postcolonial Era North Indian classical music. The creator of nisaňdäs kāvya sought to make his  poetry commensurate with English and American modernist verse. The role of  education and institutional bases cannot be overestimated as factors that influ- enced the contrasting styles. The next chapter chronicles the emergence of a creative practice akin to so- cial realism. I use the label “social realism” to characterize the works discussed in  chapter 5 because their creators argued that village culture was the authentic site of  the Sri Lankan nation. We shall see how social realists in the 1950s drew on the po- etic meters, lexicon, and grammar from village folklore or literary sources created  between the fourteenth and seventeenth centuries, and how they infused these  features with new semantic material in an attempt to create art for “the people.” </page> </plain_text>
