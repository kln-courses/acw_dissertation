<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE SAGA OF TRIBAL SCULPTURE &amp; ICONOGRAPHY IN NORTH EAST INDIA Girish Pd. Singh Sculpture, usually cultivated in India as an accessory to architec- ture, is an allied art conspicuous both for its conventional iconography and astonishing life quality. It is not until the second century B.C. that we are provided with a clear conception of the history and development of sculpture as a tradition. Actually after 300 A.D. Indian sculptured figures deserve to be reckoned as an art. The tribal sculptural style and features in the hill regions of North East India are akin to the East Indian tradition. The primitive style of utilitarian- cum-religio-magical value in the form of wood works, stone works, the early medieval sculptural style in the form of human figures and other non- iconic figures and the Eastern School of art of Bihar, Bengal and Orissa in the form of wood carving, image work of varying degree and etc. can be noticed in tribal art. The pivot of tribal sculptural art is their traditional beliefs and religious practices. We can divide tribal sculpture in various parts, viz. sculpture of human forms including Gods and Goddesses and sculpture of animal forms, sculpture of geometric, floral and symbolic designs and other sculptures found chiselled on stone slabs, rocks and terracotta plaques. The figures were executed in conformity with the canons laid down in the silpasastras. Icons, mostly chiselled on rocks and stones, belong to four major cults, i.e. Vaishnava, Saiva sakta and Surya. Besides, some other different deities and numerous images of Hindu and Buddhist pantheon have also been discovered in the North- East Hill region, having a marked affinity with the regional and other prominent schools of art, notably the pala- Sena School of Bengal (post Gupta period-9th century to 11th century). The late Medieval trends, the late pala style and indigenous style of 16th Century can also be observed in the tribal art of this region. Early literature, epigraphy, palaeography, meagre chronological data, the perishable character of the then used materials, help us very</page><page sequence="2">Ill little in tracing the general porgress of aboriginal art in North- East India. However we can safely depend on the various objects of artistic importance exumed as a result of archaeological explorations and excavations, discovery of some other ruins, recorded statements in both published and unpublished sources, etc. Ragionai variations in facial expression, appearance and treatment are noticeable to a great extent. The extensive remains scattered all over the regions speak eloquently of the prolific sculptural and iconographie activities of the hill tribes and of their progress in this branch of art. These testify to the synthesis of both Aryan and non-Aryan elements in their art and their aesthetic philosophy. Sculpture- In North-East Frontier region in Bhismaknagar area the discovery of carved block of sand stone and the sculptured face of the stone placed upon the brick terrace close to the Eastern wall containing the figure of Krishna was really a fine specimen of early sculptural art.1 In 1905 Dr.T. Bloch2 trekking along the outer wall of it made an archaeological exploration of the area and collected some tiles bearing carving of animals, birds, human figures, floral and geometric designs. Major S.F. Hannay3 refers to the elaborately carved stone gateway and the door of the copper Temple (Tamres- wari, lying 25 miles in dense forest to the North-East of Sadiya) with the lintel carved on the edge in the chain of lotus flowers as well as some ornamented pillars containing the figure of an elephant carved out of a block of porphyritic granite of a hardness in the old tradition. He also refers to the brick tiles having stamped upon them in high relief figures of some of the "Hindoo Avataras". The principal figures were the caparisoned horse, some with warriors in high conical cap, Hanooman, fighting peacock and one bird preying on the other, Nagasur in different forms etc. According to Dr.T. Bloch4 the walls and buildings of this temple contained various sculptured designs including humam figures, animals, birds, flowers and geome- trical pattern evidently without any symbolical meaning attached to them. The style was of semi-barbarian kind as in the carving at Dimapur and other places in Assam, various carved figures have close affinity with Medieval Indian Art. The carvings on tiles, 16 of them listed by Block, represent figures of lion, peacock, bearded man in dancing posture, pair of dancers with musical instruments, and vari-</page><page sequence="3">112 ous other designs in the shape of lotus flowers, etc. The ornamental patterns of the tiles bear close resemblance to that of "V" columns pillars of Dimapur. F.J. Needham5 also mentions that about two stones of the size 8x2 x Y were found standing at the entrance of the Temple having human figures cut in them. These relics of the Sadiya region, which show the mixture of the Aryan and non-Aryan elements, can be placed between 11th and 15th Centuies. Another piece of attractive stone carving has been traced in Malinithan Temple. The life-size lion figure in standing position on two elephants in crouching pose at each of the four corners of the Temple remind us of similar motifs in old temples in Orissa. Sevearal other stone carvings, representing the pair of lion, female figures and dancing girls have also been discovered. In this region various tribes used to carve out beautiful images and pictures of their beliefs and imaginat- ion on wood, rock and stone walls. The wood carvings of Khamptis, the Wanchos, the Noctes, the Monpas, the Sherdukpens, the Konyaks, and the Phom tribes connected with head hunting, decoration of Morung and funerary images erected for warriors are well known for their exquisite beauty and artistic value. The carved features in low relief are fairly realistic. The main pillars of the roof and great horiz- ontal beam running across the front of the Morung building are carved with fantastic variety of designs. The carving of Mithun heads, hornbill tails, elephants, warriors with guns, tigers, monkeys, dancing couples, frogs eating the moon, and human being on the pillars are fine examples of indigenous sculptural art. Some of the tablets of the stone Shrines of Sherdukpen tribes contain the figure of Buddha carved on them. In Kameng district stone sculpure of 9th- 10th centuries have also been noticed. The Khamtis wood carving of temple, musicians with instruments-guitar and drums in beating posture and ivory carving have gota special place in the hierarchy of North-East Frontier tribal art. Dalton8 specifically mentions about the Khamptis sculptural art. To quote him. "The Priests in their hours of relaxation amuse themselves by carving in wood, bone or ivory at which they are very expert with a creditable unity and gracefulness of design". In North Cachar Hill the most estonishing remains of sculptural art inside the old fort of Dimapur were the huge stone Monoliths,</page><page sequence="4">113 broken "V" shaped chessman pillars-all elaborately, elegantly and profusely carved with representation of birds, anima's, spearhead, etc.7 The ornamentation on the columns was generally very simple. The pillars were decorated with carvings of degenerated workmanship after theBrahama-Tezpur School. The style of carving on the pillars was probably more or less indigenous with some light touches of Indian Art existing till the Ahom invasion of Kachar in the 16th century. Regarding the carvings on pillars and stones we find similar features in Mathura-Gandhara School of Art (Ist to 3rd centuries A D.), Hoysala style of Art, (12th to 13th centuries), Pallava Art, (7th century) and other arts in the Asiatic tradition in general. On the basis of archaeological records8 we find evidence of other sculptural works near Maibong. Twenty carved stones representing variety of subjects like elephants, horses, flowers and women in base relief on them were discovered. The latter forms differ from the usual attempts of the Lushais, the Kukis and the Mikirs. Many carved statues of Goddesses, several carved bricks with animal figures and some crude stone carvings of men have also been found there. Another specimen of non-Aryan workmanship with Hindu influence is the carved emblem of Kasomari Monoliths. Bloch9 noticed a chessman pillar similar to those of Dimapur with a hemispheral capital containing the carvings of swords and daggers. The base had a horizontal band of ornamen- tation and the panel below it had some animal figures, elephants or lions carved upon it. Another attractive specimen is a Kachari Conch Shell bearing the caving of ten Avataras or incarnations of Krishna. It contains an inscription which proves that it was carved in Bir Darpa's (Hidimba Prince) reign in 1671 A.D. In the Khasi-Jaintia Hills also we find beautiful specimens of sculptural art. Major H. H. Godwin Austen's information10 that "The only instance of carving I know on Monoliths of Khasi Hills is the simple circle with petaliform pattern" is not an adequate observation. Archaeological sources11 testify to the presence of a statue of elephant carved out of solid rock. Their other carvings representing the sun and the moon, images of warrior, animals and other animate and inanimate objects, some in Pauranic tradition, bear testimony to the artistic perfection of the Khasi-Jaintia tribes in this branch of art. The most valuable information supplied by R. M.</page><page sequence="5">114 Nath12 shows that stone boundary pillar with the image of Kali engraved on it with an inscription in Bengali script installed at Jamunagaon, now in Nowgong Museum, is the manifestation of the victory of Jaintia Kings over the Mikirs as well as of their artistic grace. According to Dalton13 the most conspicuous example of the triumph of art amongst the Garos is provided by fantastically carved grotesque figures, ornamentations representing wooden images, animals, various kinds of fruits and vegetables on the post and beams of their larger Nokpantes and houses. In Naga Hills, Bloch14 found several points of similarities between "V" shaped pillars and memorials used by the Naga tribes to commemorate sacrifices. In the Sema Naga village he found large wooden shields cut out in the shape of the letter ' U" standing 7 or 8 feet high and covered with rough carvings, sympolising the sun, the moon and lightening. The Rengma Nagas also used rows of stones carved of gradually decreasing size. Another carved stone near Lozema by the Naga tribe was also found.15 Mr. A. Dabis16 (Asst. Commissioner of Kohima) found one curious stone in 1887 A.D. roughly carved with Peacock. According to Mr. R B. McCabe17 (D.C. Naga Hills), the front view of rich Angami Nagas's houses were carved in slight relief representing various conventional designs, execution of life size human figures, etc. Clay dolls well suspended over the door and some wooden dolls with considerable elaboration dressed up in miniature reproduction of Angami costume were also made. The original manufacture of these dolls seems to have been a case of "Art for Art's sake". The village gates of the Angami Nagas were also carved with human figures. The pillars of the Morungs of Naga tribes notably the Angamis, the Aos, the Semas, the Lothas and the Konyaks were elaborately carved with human heads, hornbills, tigers, elephants, some other natural objects, and so on. They were also skilful wood carvers as is clear from the carving on the round Kachari Megaliths at Dimapur. The paramount glory of the sculptural art of the Naga tribes lies in the techniques, symbolism and variation upon adopted themes. Iconography- The art of image making is as old as Hindu religion. Though the cults of different deities of the Hindu pantheon in the early centuries of Christian era can be seen from the ruins of temples</page><page sequence="6">115 and other isolated icons in the hill region of North-Eastern India, the artistic revival of the Gupta period ushered in a new era in this field of art. Icons mostly chiselled on rocks and stones belong to four major cults, i.e. Vaishnava, Saiva, Sakta and Surya. Besides, some images of Vedic gods and goddesses are also found. Numerous images of Buddhist pantheon have also been discovered in the North East Frontier region. The study of extant images shows the influence of anthropomorphism here. The art of iconography in the hill regions of North-East India developed along the lines framed by Ancient Indian Texts. In North Cachar Hills the Golden Image of the Goddess Durga, installed in a temple in Sonapur, the stone image of Vishnu, an image of Durga and a stone image of Ganesha on Dimapur can fairly be ascribed to the 15th century. The images of Ranchandi Durga and Vasudeva in the rock-cut temples of Maibong belong to the 16th century.83 Both architecture and sculpture were of the old Brahma Tezpur School. L.W. Shakespear'4 while corroborating this statements observes that most of the statues and ornamented stones looking like Goddess were excavated at Maibong in North Cachar Hills. G.H. Damant25 also refers to the brass image of Ramchandi in Cachar. Frank E.D.E.28 found Hindu Temples and two older images one representing Ganesa and other Hanuman on a hill bordering Cachar on the east known as Bholan Parbat, 3000 feet high. In the Khasi-Jaintia Hills, the art of image making was not very much popular. The Hindu Shrines of Nartiang temple were adorned with the images of Krishna, Durga, Kali, Mahadeo, Jaya, Bijaya and etc. The practice of Hindu religion has profoundly influenced their art. Archaeological record27 also confirms this traditional evidence. In Garo Hills some terracotta pieces containing the figures of Siva, seated on bull, Ganesa, Manasa, Kartikeya and other human figures have been collected by G. N. Bhuyan58 near a locality called Bhaitbari. The ruins of the city and temples belong to the 11th-12th centuries. These "Terracotta fragmentation bear close affinity with the late Pala and Sena artistic idiom. Bloch29 among his findings in Tamreswari Temple specifically refers to the lintel and jambes of its door bearing the two images of</page><page sequence="7">116 Siva and three statues, two of which represented the images of Surya and Kali dancing on Siva, while the other represented Saras- wati with an indistict object in her right hand, perhaps a musical instrument. This archaeological evidence has been further corro- borated by R.M. Nath,'0 who mentions the images of Surya and seven rampart horses below and stylistically datable to perhaps 7th- 8th centuries carved in Pala Sena idiom, Kali and Ganesa-all ruins of Tamreswari Temple in Sadiya region. Malinithan (situated in the lower region of the Siang Dist. of NEFA) has proved to be a store- house of historical ruins The archaeological excavations and explorations conducted by Shri L.N. Chakravarty (Research Deptt., Arunachal Pradesh) during 1970-71 have revealed over one hundred carved images of Gods and Goddesses of the Hindu pantheom, demi-Gods, Yaksas in dancing postures, figurines. Gaja, Ratha, animal motifs of bull, lion and elephants, sculptured panels, geometric and floral designs on stone used extensively for decorative purposes, carved panels, lintels, columns, and pillars etc. Among the impressive remains are the life size lion on elephant motif, also found in Dimapur and various parts of Orissa, the images of Kartikeya seated on Peacock like that of Pala- Sena School of art and the Orissa School of art (both in Indian Museum, Calcutta), Indra seated on his carrier, elephant (Airavata), Nandi-Bull in sitting posture, sun God- Surya- standing on a chariot with Aruna as charioteer, Ganesa with his carrier, mouse. Goddess Dasabhuja, a statue resembling Saraswati with Bina, and a number of erotic relief figures or sculptures signifying. "Tantricism of the fertility cult of the primitive tribal society upholding the mother principle as the procreative power of nature." The style is simple, representation fairly lively and the ornamentation resembling the Hoysala style. All these remains do not belong to the same age, for the relics differ from "crudity to excellence in artistic conception and accomplishments." These remains may tentatively be placed in between 6th century and 14th century A.D. The art of making the image of Buddha was very popular among the Buddhist tribes of NEFA. The wooden image of Lord Buddha carved by Khamti, "the large size images of Buddha cut out of solid pieces of amber and other glass images based on documentary evidence,81 the clay image of Buddha made by Memba Monk,</page><page sequence="8">117 wooden images of Buddha by Monpa artists, and some other bronze statues and another Buddha icons of sand stone discovered from various places, some of them on display at the Central Museum, Shillong, are well known for their elegance, grace, artistic beauty and great sculpural merit. These remains, ascribed to the 16th to 17th centuries, speak eloquently of attainment of perfection in this field of art. Some figures of Buddha with iconographie marks and attributes like those of Graceo-Roman pantheom are of identical character. R. Reid82 has brought this fact to the fore that in temple of Jadonang, a Kabui Naga of Manipur, the clay image of Mithun and various other figures of Naga men and women dressed in festival clothes were carved out. In Hill-Tipperah the life-size figure of some of the tutelary Gods and Goddesses like Siva, Durga Vishnu, Lakshmi, Saraswati, Kartik, Ganesha, Brahma, and others, ascribed to early centuries of the Christian era, all kept in the temple of old Agartala, were the objects of veneration by the Hill-Tribes till recently.83 According to W.W. Hunter84 other white stone-images representing the deity Mahadeo or Siva were kept in the temple of Udaipur. At Unakuti colossal figures representing Siva. Kal Bhairab, Hanuman, Ram-Lakshman and Ganapati carved into rocks date back to the early Buddhist and Hindu periods. REFERENCES 1. S. F. Hannary, Jš A. S. B. 1848, Vol. XVII, pp. 471 -72. 2.
