My words come from outside of me. I speak and what I say is not said by me. —Charlotte Delbo, Auschwitz and After In 1988, Steve Reich completed Different Trains, his magnum opus forstring quartet and tape in which he splices together spoken recollectionsby three Holocaust survivors to create a narrative of Jewish suffering  during World War II. As he explains in the program notes, the piece was  not merely a historical meditation but a personal response to his own Jewish heritage: The idea for the piece comes from my childhood. When I was one year old, my parents separated. [. . .] Since they arranged divided custody, I traveled back and forth by train frequently between New York and Los Angeles from 1939 to 1942, accompanied by my governess[, Virginia]. [. . .] I now look back and think that, if I had been in Europe during this period, as a Jew I would have had to ride on very different trains. With this in mind, I wanted to make a piece that would accurately reflect the whole situation. . . .The piece thus presents both a documentary and a musical reality, and begins a new musical direction.1 Portions of this article were presented as papers read at the annual meetings of the Association for Jewish Studies, December 2006; the American Academy of Religion, November 2007; and the Seventy-Third Annual Meeting of the American Musicological Society, Quebec City, November 2007. Archival research was made possible by a generous research grant from Dickinson College.

In the first, “America: Before the War,” the listener encounters the voices of Reich’s governess, Virginia, and of Mr. Davis, a retired Pullman porter; both describe a series of destinations designed to recall Reich’s youthful journeys across the country by rail. The second movement shifts the focus to “Europe: During the War” and features excerpts from the recorded testimonies of three Holocaust survivors—Paul, Rachel, and Rachella—who describe their traumatic experiences of prewar anti-Semitism and the genocide. The final movement, simply titled “After the War,” merges the voices of the first move- ment with those of the second, signifying the geographic relocation of the sur- vivors to America and the lingering memories that they carried with them. Within Reich’s corpus, Different Trains functions as the culmination of several composition projects he developed during a period of spiritual awaken- ing in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Encouraged by his partner Beryl Korot, who shared a similar interest in rediscovering her own Jewish past, Reich en- rolled in courses on Hebrew and the Torah, which led to private studies of cantillation at the Jewish Theological Seminary from 1976 to 1977.2 Reich put this new-found knowledge to work in his Octet (1979, revised in 1983 as Eight Lines), which showcased musical gestures derived from Hebraic decla- mation.3 In 1981, he turned to Old Testament texts in Tehillim, a Hebrew setting of selections from the Book of Psalms that marked Reich’s return to vocal compositions after a decade of producing only instrumental works.4 Reich adapted several of the choral techniques of Tehillim to his next work, The Desert Music (1984), which set fragments that Reich selected from several poems of William Carlos Williams.5 The Desert Music signified a return to overtly political composition for Reich, who admitted that Williams’s poetry had appealed to him on both personal and ideological levels: I have loved Dr. Williams’s poetry since I was sixteen years old . . . [and] have continued reading his work to the present. I find [his] best work to be his late poetry, written between 1954 and his death in 1963 at age 80. It is from this period in the poet’s work that I have selected the texts for The Desert Music—a period after the bombs were dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki.6 2.

See his “Eight Lines (1983),” 119. 4. Puca, “Steve Reich and Hebrew Cantillation,” 537, 545.

See also Reich, “Hebrew Cantillation and Its Influence on Composition (1982),” 105–18; and Dadson, “Steve Reich in Conversation with Philip Dadson.” 5. Reich remarks in the program notes that the textual “arrangement was my first composi- tional activity.” After organizing the texts into a large dramatic arch, Reich began musical compo- sition, working with polyrhythmic pulses that “grew out of the two- and three-beat groupings found in Tehillim.” See Reich, “The Desert Music (1984),” 120–24. 6. Ibid., 124. </page> <page sequence="3"> The Testimonial Aesthetics of Different Trains 101 As he intimated in a conversation with Jonathan Cott, Reich associated The Desert Music with a variety of ideas that would reemerge in Different Trains, including Jewish exile, trips “to and from California . . . through the Mojave,” and rumination on the horror of a nuclear holocaust, as represented by White Sands and Alamagordo in New Mexico.7 Antonella Puca argues that Reich’s reengagement with Judaism fundamen- tally changed his approach to text setting and the voice; instead of manipulat- ing sound objects to the point of distortion, as in the 1966 composition Come Out, “the rediscovery of his Jewish background in the mid-1970s oriented [Reich’s] approach . . . in a new direction, one that aims at preserving the in- tegrity of speech in terms both of its acoustic quality and of its semantic mean- ing.”8 This new method of text setting informed the composition of Different Trains, in which Reich digitally sampled excerpts from taped interviews and used them to create “speech melodies,” Reich’s term for a type of musical transcription that attempts to replicate the distinctive rhythm, intonation, and inflection of human speech.9 For example, the opening speech melody of  the piece derives from a description given by Reich’s governess of their  cross-country travels; Reich isolated a single phrase (“From Chicago to New York”), identified its musical characteristics, and then composed a motive that reflected his hearing of the musical qualities of the clip (see Ex. 1). By deliber- ately maintaining the acoustic integrity of the sound clips, Reich respected the semantic meaning of the testimonies and amplified them by using the speech melodies to generate musical motives for the live string quartet.10 The result is an interplay between the individual voices heard on the tape and the musical representations of those voices performed by the live instruments. The final performance therefore comprises six distinct layers of sound: the live string quartet; the prerecorded voice samples (tape); three tracks, each prerecorded by the string quartet, that generate the background of the piece by mimicking the constant motion of a train (tape); and a final track containing recorded samples of train whistles and air raid sirens.11 7. “There is another desert that is central to The Desert Music: White Sands and Alamagordo in New Mexico, where weapons of the most intense and sophisticated sort are constantly being developed and tested. Hidden away from the eyes of the rest of the world are these infernal ma- chines that could lead to the destruction of the planet—and it is to this possibility that the words of William Carlos Williams, which I set in the third movement, refer.” Reich, “The Desert Music— Steve Reich in Conversation with Jonathan Cott (1984),” 127–28. 8.

The first movement “establishes a counterpoint of crossing bells and American steam lo- comotives’ wonderfully evocative chime whistles.” In the second movement, the sampled sounds change to reflect the new context of wartime Europe. “This time, testimony is set against German locomotives’ shrill whistles and—increasingly—against wailing air-raid sirens. Whistles’ pitch sharpens subtly as this section approaches its climax.” Carter, “Train Music,” 290. </page> <page sequence="4"> 102 Journal of the American Musicological Society Example 1 Opening speech melody (“From Chicago to New York”), Different Trains, from Reich’s “Noteby theComposer” in the score; the passage appears inViola 1 in mvt. 1,mm. 45–46 Š −−−−− .0 Ł 1 Ł Ł Ł 3⁄4 4/ Ł Ł Ł  Ł   3⁄4 (from Chi - ca - go to New Yo - rk) The work was premiered in 1989 by the Kronos Quartet to great critical acclaim and has since enjoyed a healthy reception. New York Times reviewer Allan Kozinn immediately heralded it as “Reich’s most affecting, emotional work” and lauded the composer’s ability to use “interview snippets—usually only a date or a few words—[not only to form] the basis of his melodic and rhythmic material, but also to convey information about time, place, and mood.”12 Less than a decade later, Richard Taruskin affirmed the work’s canonical status with a veritable coronation in the New York Times, asserting that Different Trains “went the full distance and earned [Reich] his place among the great composers of the century.”13 Even more significantly for my study, Taruskin proclaimed that Reich had “solved the other problem. He has composed the only adequate musical response—one of the few adequate  artistic responses in any medium—to the Holocaust.”14 Taruskin argued that Reich’s compositional method escaped the traditional pitfalls of Holocaust representations, allowing Different Trains to transmit neither agendas nor au- thored texts but recordings, a decision that preserved the emotional aura and voices of the original speaking subjects, avoided textual manipulation, and, above all, rejected Hollywood-esque melodrama: There are no villains and no heroes. There is no role for a Ralph Fiennes or a Werner Klemperer to flatter your sense of moral superiority. And there is no ba- thetic glory to comfort you with a trumped-up “Triumph of the Human Spirit.” There is just the perception that while this happened here, that hap- pened there, and a stony invitation to reflect.15 According to this analysis, Different Trains succeeds less for its musical struc- ture or aesthetic advancements than for its singular moral victory, and it is on this basis that Taruskin nominates Reich as one of the few twentieth-century composers whose works will matter in the future. In recent years, Different Trains has been included in music history surveys and textbooks; outside of musicology, scholars have advocated its use in Jewish Studies courses as a means of teaching cultural issues surrounding the 12.

Reich appears to overcome the moral challenge imposed by the Holocaust and to defy mythology by presenting “things as they happened.” Reich himself has emphasized the absence of any emotional or narrative program in the work by stressing that he merely transcribed the survivors’ speech melodies. And yet even in his early writings, Reich admitted freely to the theatrical dimension of Different Trains, explaining that he set out to use archival materials in order to create a “theater . . . in the mind, since there is nothing visual beyond the musicians.”17 Indeed, the climax of Different Trains in movement two is highly theatrical: Reich uses excerpts that evoke suspense (“Quick, go! Don’t breathe!”), uncertainty (“into the cattle wagons for four days”), and terror (“it was smoking”). He also sets the sonic stage for the movement with prerecorded tracks laced with air-raid sirens. As the char- acters reach Auschwitz in the closing measures, the string quartet’s simulation of a train eases and finally comes to a halt, suggesting the arrival of the cattle wagons and the beginning of the selection process. Although Reich has pointedly described Different Trains as a “musical real- ity” that “accurately reflects the whole situation” of American and European Jews during the war, his emphasis on objectivity is problematic. To a certain extent, his language harkens back to the rhetoric of early minimalism, when composers sought forms that resisted cohesive narrative and attempted to fo- cus attention on the musical object through repetitive or gradual musical processes. Minimalism was not without its critics, however, who argued that such aesthetic arguments were misleading and directed attention away from the fact that minimalist art is staged with an audience in mind. In Different Trains, the dramatic use of survivor testimonies adds another layer to the dilemma by recasting fragments of very emotional testimonies as purportedly unmediated documentary. The kind of authority attributed to these sources has come under scrutiny in the field of Holocaust studies, with scholars debat- ing the consequences of transforming highly subjective survivor testimonies into a historical discourse in which their witness is lifted out of its emotional context and made to serve as fact rather than memory. Distrustful of this  practice, a new generation of scholars has refocused attention on the historiog- raphy of the Holocaust and the role of secondary witness—intellectual inter- pretations of survivor testimonies that are advanced without the author revealing his or her own subjective standpoint or scholarly agenda.18 16. For example, see Leibman, “Teaching the Holocaust Through Music.” 17. Reich, “Chamber Music—An Expanded View (1989),” 158.  18. Naomi Cumming, in “The Horrors of Identification: Reich’s Different Trains,” similarly questions the objectivity of Trains, arguing that “a bifurcation of ‘the music’ from ‘the listening subject’ is a mistake” (130). She notes that Reich’s use of repetition in Trains engenders the  </page> <page sequence="6"> 104 Journal of the American Musicological Society This study brings these debates to bear upon Different Trains, arguing that the piece functions as a form of secondary witness susceptible to the represen- tational dangers outlined above. In my analysis, I rely heavily on the primary source recordings, housed at the Fortunoff Video Archive for Holocaust Testimonies at Yale University and the Wiener Oral History Library at the New York Public Library, to ascertain the processes by which Reich made his selections from the original witness accounts of Paul, Rachel, and Rachella. Consultation of the source tapes reveals that as Reich worked with extracts from the testimonies, the original meaning and tone was often altered.19 Reich also misheard certain phrases, producing transcription errors that significantly reframe key moments by substituting his account of the Holocaust for that of the primary witness. Such revelations prompt reevaluation of the moral and political success that has been claimed for Different Trains, since—as study of the original recordings shows—the compositional process could never have been as objective and self-effacing as Reich and his critics suggest. Rather, Different Trains is itself a problematic secondary witness, one susceptible to the same fracture of subjectivity endemic to the accounts of primary witnesses, in which survivors struggle not only with the ruptures of memory caused by trauma, but also with the impossibility of translating those memories into  language and narrative. As a result, Different Trains is itself shaped by the aes- thetics and inaccurate nature of testimony: ultimately, it is Reich’s own Holo-  caust testimony, one crafted from the voices of witnesses other than himself. The Holocaust as Minimal Object Though seemingly unrelated, both minimalism and Holocaust criticism em- phasized the need to establish objective forms of discourse as a response to the highly ideological movements of the 1930s and 1940s. For their part, mini- malists espoused an objective approach to art as a corrective to what they con- sidered the ideological illusion of expressionist movements in both art and music. Central to the minimalist aesthetic was the principle of wholeness and the rejection of complex contrapuntal designs that allowed specific elements in an artwork to distinguish themselves as separate from the whole.20 As the audience’s emotional identification with the survivors: “Insofar as [the listeners] may share a re- sponse to a given rhythmic ‘feel,’ it may also be argued that they have some means of access to the emotional connotations of that ‘feel,’ as it may be experienced by others. A shared experience of motion does not, however, determine that emotional responses between listeners will be entirely commensurate with one another” (131). 19.

Wiener Oral History Library in several statements per- taining to Trains. I am grateful to Joanne Rudof for helping me to locate Rachella’s testimonial record. 20. Fried, “Art and Objecthood,” 118.  </page> <page sequence="7"> The Testimonial Aesthetics of Different Trains 105 sculptor Donald Judd remarked, an artist should have in mind “a definitive whole and maybe no parts, or very few,” in order to create, as nearly as possi- ble, “one thing, a single Specific Object.”21 He achieved this uniformity through the repetition of identical units that were simple in shape and argued that “anything that is not absolutely plain begins to have parts in some way.”22 The sculptor Robert Morris went further, arguing that minimalist works pro- duced “facts of space, light, and materials [that] have always functioned con- cretely and literally. . . . One sees and immediately ‘believes’ that the pattern within one’s mind corresponds to the existential fact of the object.”23 Morris also recognized that the establishment of this singular correspondence be- tween object and one’s perception of it required deliberate control of “the  entire situation,” including how the object was placed in its exhibition space.24 Like their artistic counterparts, minimalist composers also reacted against personal expression and narrative, focusing instead on the acoustic properties of an isolated musical phrase, which they often highlighted through repeti- tion.25 Just as Frank Stella rejected programmatic approaches to art, declaring his painting to be based “on the fact that only what can be seen there is there—it really is an object,” composers such as Philip Glass began to refer to minimalism as “intentionless music” that did not attempt “a calculated effect [or] paint a picture.”26 What set their aesthetic apart from the reductiveness of Webern’s serialism or the nonintention of Cage’s indeterminacy was the fact that it was, in Glass’s words, “non-narrative.”27 It avoided dramatic devices such as contrast, opposition, climax, patterns of tension and release, and large- scale form and development, instead treating musical sounds in a nonrela- tional way. Repetition in particular narrowed the focus to a singular musical cell, eschewing counterpoint and developmental tendencies in such a way as to reference only the musical object at hand. Reich embraced the movement’s self-referential impulse, arguing that  the subjection of recorded voices to external processes effaced the self, and 21. Donald Judd, cited in ibid., 117, 119. 22.

In his sculpture from the early 1960s, Morris stressed architecture, the body, and movement; only later did he refine his views, ridding his art of such allusions and finally arguing for a purely abstract, literal art.

As Nyman notes, minimalist pioneer La Monte Young took inspira- tion not only from his involvement in the early Fluxus movement, but also from Webern’s ten- dency to repeat pitches at the same octave positions throughout a section of a movement, thereby grounding the work in a foundation of repetition and stasis. </page> <page sequence="8"> 106 Journal of the American Musicological Society therefore emotionality, from his texted compositions. Early works like It’s Gonna Rain (1964) and Come Out (1966) presented the recorded voice of an individual without altering the sound source itself. Instead, Reich developed musical counterpoint through manipulative techniques external to the samples themselves such as phase shifting and tape looping, both of which create what Keith Potter describes as a “rich interaction of musical and semantic levels” that ultimately adds an “ ‘emotional layer’ provided by words and their cul- tural resonances.”28 As Reich explained in “Music as a Gradual Process,” this emotional layer lies outside of the work, since processes such as phasing liber- ate sound from any “intentions,” allowing sonic phenomena to “occur for their own acoustic reasons.”29 Focusing on the musical process made possible “that shift of attention away from he and she and you and me outward toward it.”30 The experience of the musical process becomes “impersonal; it just  goes its way.”31 Here Reich articulates his own form of “acoustic positivism,” a term developed by Jeremy Grimshaw to describe minimalism’s focus on sonic materiality rather than semantic meaning or musical context.32 It was perhaps this interest in musical objectivity that drew Reich to the idea of using survivor testimonies in Different Trains, especially given the  increasing value accorded to them as the foundation for a new type of Holocaust history, one based on the collection and dissemination of firsthand accounts. Directly after the war, historians mined a variety of sources as they tried to discover the course and extent of the European genocide, including official Nazi documents, physical evidence left at the sites of extermination, and the accounts of traumatized survivors. As Zoë Waxman observes, early histories of the Holocaust were highly concerned with maintaining an objec- tive tone, so as to avoid being dismissed as Jewish or Zionist propaganda.33 Consequently, most of the early accounts avoided citation of survivor testi- mony “in an attempt to infuse their work with objectivity.”34 The publication of several survivors’ diaries between 1945 and 1965, however, emphasized the importance of eye-witness accounts in reconstructing a broader picture of the 28.

Grimshaw’s theory of acoustic positivism emerges from his study of the music of La Monte Young, especially works like the String Trio (1958), in which Young deliberately suspended or slowed down musical development in order to intensify focus on the sound itself. As Grimshaw notes, “Young sought ways of describing and  organizing sounds with respect to what they were rather than what they might be made to do. Hearing a melody, Young surmised, entailed connecting dots; he was interested in the dots  themselves.” 33. Waxman, Writing the Holocaust: Identity, Testimony, Representation, 97. 34.

As literary critic Edouard Roditi prominently argued, the “stead- fastly objective eye-witness observations” of Holocaust diarists were valuable for their “selfless objectivity” as historical data.35 In making this assertion, Roditi shifted the claim of objectivity back to witness testimony, which could now be understood as a form of hard history rather than soft literary recon- struction.36 As a consequence, writers on the Holocaust began practicing what James E. Young characterizes as “an almost obsessive tendency . . . to rid their narrative of all signs of style in order to distinguish between factual and fic- tional works.”37 Reactions to these inclinations—to claim objectivity for both minimalist artworks and Holocaust narratives—intersected in 1967, when scholars began to critique such claims as little more than “rhetorical moves in their own right . . . a rhetoric of anti-rhetoric [designed] to convince the reader that such facts, now of a particular color and cast, had been established.”38 In “Historical Discourse,” Roland Barthes prominently challenged the “so-called ‘objective’ mode of historical discourse, in which the historian discards the hu- man persona and replaces it with an ‘objective’ one.”39 He argued that autho- rial self-effacement was a highly ideological technique, a “referential illusion, where the historian tries to give the impression that the referent is speaking for itself.”40 More importantly for this study, Barthes observes that the practice was not restricted to historical texts alone but had become an aesthetic, partic- ular to certain types of fiction and most notably realism, in which “novelists galore . . . considered themselves ‘objective’ because they had suppressed all traces of the ‘I’ in their text.”41 Later that year, the art critic Michael Fried took aim at minimalism’s pur- ported objectivity in his provocative essay, “Art and Objecthood,” which ap- peared in Artforum. Responding to the writings of Judd, Stella, and Morris, Fried countered that “the literalist espousal of objecthood amounts to noth- ing other than a plea for a new genre of theater.”42 Instead of focusing on it— the minimalist object—Fried insisted that the audience for minimalist art also be taken into account, contending that “the experience of literalist art is of an object in a situation—one that, virtually by definition, includes the beholder . . . belongs to the beholder—it is his situation.”43 When observed by a viewer, the object becomes staged, endowed with “a theatrical effect or quality—a 35.

And once he is in the room the work refuses, obstinately, to let him alone.”44 When art “demands that the beholder take it into account, that he take it seriously,” Fried contended, it is partly the result of the artist having staged the work so that the beholder “knows himself to stand in an indeterminate, open-ended—and unexacting—relation as subject to the impassive object on the wall or floor.”45 Moreover, by masking this staging, by hiding the work’s intent and anthropomorphism, the artist engages in further theatrics—those of smoke and mirrors—and ultimately threatens the integrity of his or her art, which degenerates the more closely it approaches the condi- tion of theater.46 The critiques of Fried and Barthes would later find common ground in The Minimal Self (1984) by the social critic and historian Christopher Lasch, in which he contended that minimalism’s siege on subjectivity reflected its own post-Holocaust anxiety. Arguing that the Holocaust had threatened the cre- ative imagination by its very extremity, Lasch concluded that minimalism had emerged as a survival tactic for artists, who managed to establish control over the Holocaust by narrowing their focus and conceiving of trauma as an artistic object. This strategy required the neutralization of the Holocaust’s emotional core, which minimalism achieved through reification and detachment: By turning horrible events into images, tearing these images out of context, re- arranging them in new combinations, and characterizing the viewer’s responses in the bland jargon of scientific neutrality . . . [minimalism] deadens the emo- tional impact of events, neutralizes criticism and commentary, and reduces even the “death of affect” to another catchword or cliché, one that reinforces the very condition it describes.47 Lasch argued that as an anti-art, minimalism “concerns itself with surfaces [and in doing so] not only denies the reality of inner experience but denies the reality of surrounding objects as well. It annihilates the subject and the object alike.”48 The result is a passive, voyeuristic attitude toward history that con- veys “the experience of unreality.”49 The minimal artist becomes, in a sense, akin to Holocaust survivors themselves—able to narrate plausible representa- tions of an event, but in terms ultimately disconnected from their inner experi- ence of trauma.50 Four years later, the Holocaust became Reich’s minimal object, a series of testimonial facts that he resituated into a narrative inhabited by numerous 44.

In light of the skepticism advanced by Barthes, Fried, and Lasch, it seems time to question how the processes used to compose Different Trains refocused the meanings of the recordings Reich sampled, ultimately producing yet another personal interpretation of the Holocaust. More crucially, as we better under- stand the psychological pressures that may have weighed on the compositional process, the moment seems ripe to reevaluate the moral approbation garnered by the work. The following analysis explores how Different Trains presents the multiple subjectivities and testimonial aesthetics of its secondary witnesses and considers the consequences of applying minimalist techniques to Holo-  caust testimony. Testimonial Aesthetics in Different Trains In 1982 Yale University established the Fortunoff Video Archive for Holocaust Testimonies in order to preserve the witness of Holocaust survivors for future generations. Citing an “increasingly media-centered era,” the archive collects interviews only on videotape, which supposedly facilitates an “open-ended, free-flowing interviewing process [that] discloses expressive de- tails about the day-to-day experience of the survivors” in ways that written or audiotaped testimonies cannot.51 Most of the recorded sessions (which range from thirty minutes to four hours) consist of questions being posed by inter- viewers to a Holocaust witness, who generally appears alone before the cam- era. As Lawrence L. Langer notes, “all the witnesses . . . volunteered for the interviews . . . [and the] two interviewers . . . practiced a mainly noninterven- tionist strategy [that] encourag[ed] the free flow of memory to recapture the interviewees’ thoughts and feelings about their experiences.”52 As Langer dis- covered in his study of the nearly 1,400 interviews archived at Yale by 1989, the testimonies not only document facets of the Holocaust firsthand, they also establish the problematic nature of traumatic memory itself. As the witnesses stumble through the “ruins of their memory,” they frequently encounter nar- rative gaps, inconsistencies, and contradictions created by psychological phe- nomena such as post-traumatic repression, blackouts, and humiliation. Just as often, they seem genuinely frustrated at their own inability to translate their Holocaust experience into words and images that the non-survivor would  understand.  This struggle to translate memory into narrative comes to the fore in an  interview with a survivor identified as Chaim E., a participant in the Sobibor uprising, who blames the disconnect not on his faulty memory but rather on 51. “Fortunoff Video Archive for Holocaust Testiomny: About the Archive—Our Concept,” http://www.library.yale.edu/testimonies/about/concept.html. 52.

The one that listens has to imagine something. So it has a different picture for me than for the one that imagines it. At least I think so, because sometimes I hear telling back a story that doesn’t sound at all the same what I was telling, you see; it doesn’t sound the same. It was horrified and horrible, and when you live once with this tension and horrification—if that is the right word—then you live differently.53 For Chaim E., the imagination of the listener converts the survivor’s memory into something incongruent with the primary remembrance, in this case re- moving some of the emotional terror from the original. This prompts him  to amplify the word “horror”—horrified . . . horrible . . . horrification—in an attempt to underscore the emotional scars of Sobibor and invest them with appropriate rhetorical weight for his audience. In the Fortunoff videorecordings, more serious cases of revision result from the intervention of the interviewers, who do not merely listen to the accounts but help to shape them through questions, interjections, clarifications, and even direct (although perhaps not intentional) censorship. Sometimes the words of the witness vie directly with those of the interviewers for supremacy, as both parties try to establish truth and meaning even as they end up “offer- ing a stunning instance of the near impossibility of achieving a purely objective oral text.”54 Langer recounts one exchange in particular, between two Fortunoff interviewers and Hanna F., who survived two deportations to Auschwitz: Interviewer: You were able to survive because you were so plucky. When you stepped back on the line . . . Hanna F.: No, dear, no dear, no . . . no, I had no . . . [meanwhile, the two interviewers are whispering audibly with each other off cam- era about this exchange, momentarily ignoring the witness, who wants to reply] Hanna F.: How shall I explain to you? I know that I had to survive. . . . espe- cially the second part, the second time, being back in Auschwitz. That time I had determined already to survive—and you know what? It wasn’t luck,  it was stupidity. [At this, the two interviewers laugh deprecatingly, overriding her voice with their own “explanation,” as one calls out, “You had a lot of guts!”] Hanna F.: No, no, no, no, there were no guts, there was just sheer stupidity. I just, you know . . . [more laughter from the interviewers, one of whom now stands up between camera and witness, blocking our vision, silencing her voice, ending the interview.Why?] 55 53. Chaim E.

The confrontation dramatizes the irreconcilable clash be- tween the differing value-spaces that the two points of view inhabit.”56 To deem these types of revision irresponsible or intentional would be to oversimplify the phenomenon, since in many cases the misunderstandings re- sult from “preconceived, culturally nourished moral expectations” about the Holocaust, its significance, and its primary tropes.57 Just as the survivor clings firmly to her memory of events, listeners attempt to posit these images in their own understanding of the Holocaust. The accounts are thus ripe with hermeneutical tension, contested memories, and a multiplicity of narratives that run from the initial remembrance of the primary witness to the retellings of secondary witnesses.  Perhaps because Reich spent a good deal of time at the Fortunoff Archives viewing the videotaped testimonies, Different Trains exhibits several striking parallels with the interviews themselves. Reich preserves the aesthetic tension between episodic flashbacks and progressive sequencing by alternating be- tween repetitive stasis, in which the survivors appear to be held captive by a re- curring memory, and harmonic modulation that leads the piece to a new topic. Such forward motion requires external intervention, and just as the in- terviewers attempted to direct the survivors’ episodic memories into a coher- ent narrative, Reich also steers their memories into chronological templates that benefit the staging of Different Trains. That Reich frames his archival se- lections is not surprising, given the work’s deep immersion in the original psy- chological content and technological format of the videotaped testimonies. As Oren Stier observes, the Fortunoff videos possess two internal frames—a nar- rative frame and a filmic frame—both of which “delineate a distinct layer of presentation, actively producing meaning or actively disrupting the transmis- sion of the witness’s experience, or both, because of varying degrees of struc- tural limitation.”58 In Different Trains, Reich appears to duplicate or augment the internal frames of the original interviews, suggesting that his experience  of their testimonial aesthetics definitively shaped his own secondary witnessing  of their accounts. 56. Ibid., 64. 57. Ibid., 64–65. 58. Stier, Committed to Memory: Cultural Mediations of the Holocaust, 77. Robert Kraft also makes the distinction between “core memory,” which constitutes the “representation of the orig- inal phenomenal experience in the form of perceptual, emotional, and physiological experience,” and “narrative memory, [which is] constructed from the images in core memory and shaped in accordance with narrative conventions, and conveyed primarily through language.” See Kraft, “Archival Memory: Representations of the Holocaust in Oral Testimony,” 316. </page> <page sequence="14"> 112 Journal of the American Musicological Society Most studies of trauma note that Holocaust survivors experience a feeling of simultaneity as they make their testimonies, during which they seem to be narrating not only for their audience but also for themselves what they are re- experiencing during the interviews. As psychologist Dori Laub notes, the Holocaust was an event that effectively obliterated an “independent frame of reference through which the event could be observed”: those who directly ex- perienced or observed its trauma were silenced either by death or a process of dehumanization that incapacitated their ability to remain a “fully lucid, unaf- fected witness.”59 As a result, survivors often carry with them dual frames of reference that surface in the narratological structure of their testimonies, which oscillates between continuity and fracture, past and present states of be- ing, and emotional possession and dispossession.60 Psychologists Bessel van der Kolk and Onno van der Hart explain that trauma ruptures one’s personal- ity, creating a dichotomous existence in which the freeze-frame of the trau- matic moment intrudes upon, or perhaps more accurately, grates against the continuity of lived experience in the present. “As the trauma is fixed at a cer- tain moment in a person’s life, people live out their existences in two different stages of the life cycle, the traumatic past, and the bleached present. The trau- matized, fixated, inflexible part of the personality has stopped developing.”61 In his studies of the Fortunoff videotapes, Langer also observed this breach in temporality, describing it as a “permanent duality, not exactly a split or a dou- bling but a parallel existence. [The witness] switches from one to the other without synchronization because he is reporting not a sequence but a simul- taneity.”62 Thus a testimonial aesthetic begins to emerge, one of cohabitation of self, multiplicity of testimonial voices, and vacillation between paralysis and progression. In many regards, Different Trains preserves the testimonial aesthetic of co- referential frames via musical decisions Reich made at both the melodic and harmonic levels of the work. The melodic doubling of the textual excerpts, rendered in speech melody by the string quartet, creates a dualistic presenta- tion of them that allows the listeners to experience both simultaneously. When we hear these melodies without accompanying text, we experience them as conveying specific textual content; they move beyond simple mimesis to the level of linguistic communication, constituting a multivoiced expression of tes- 59. Laub, “Truth and Testimony: The Process and the Struggle,” 66.  60. In light of this division of self, Hayden White has proposed the need for a new mode of expression called the “middle voice,” which would allow a different subject position in relation to the event—one that is neither active nor passive but that situates the agent inside the action. As Ernst van Alphen describes, “the agent takes part in, is affected by, the action or event without  being either subject or object of it.” See Alphen, Caught by History: Holocaust Effects in Con-  temporary Art, Literature, and Theory, 47. 61.

As Holocaust scholar Robert N. Kraft contends, the “primary unit of remembering is the episode . . . [which] is usu- ally a narrative—although it can be impressionistic. . . . Typically, survivors re- call individual episodes one at a time, proceeding from one episode to the next.”64 This episodic quality emerges in Different Trains as Reich’s repetitive treatment of the sound clips undermines the smoother-flowing chronicles of experience. The narrative remains mired in repetition until an excerpt has ex- hausted its musical potential, at which point the piece modulates to a new key area associated with a new sound clip. The result is a modular approach to  testimonial narration in which musical progression signifies narratological  advance while repetition denotes a sense of stasis similar to moments of emo- tional paralysis found in Holocaust testimonies. Overall, the Fortunoff interviewers prefer an “open interview” format that “gives as much autonomy as possible to the interviewees and does not take the initiative away from them.”65 As noted earlier, however, the testimonies are not completely unguided; two interviewers generally prompt the survivors, asking them to clarify details and steering them along a general course that be- gins with a description of their lives before the war, followed by their wartime experiences and stories of liberation, and closing with a description of their im- migration to America and reflection on their contemporary life in this coun- try.66 These general parameters create a dimension of artificiality, not in terms of the truthfulness of the memories, but in their having been directed from without (by the interviewers) rather than from within (by the witness). Indeed, as James Young notes, the simple, opening question—“Start at the beginning”—raises a host of questions for the witness: The survivor must determine where this beginning came. Was it when the fam- ily moved to Germany from Russia . . . or when they heard on the radio that Hitler was appointed chancellor, or was it Kristallnacht? . . . And where then does one’s testimony end? At liberation from the camps, or on one’s arrival in Israel? When the tape runs out, or when the interviewer grows tired? Can memory ever have closure? Depending on where the beginning and end of  63. Here, I suggest that the “speech melodies” of Different Trains work differently than Reich’s treatment of text in the early tape pieces from the 1960s, in which he manipulated speech samples in such a way that they “lost their original linguistic connotation.” Antonella Puca makes a similar point, arguing that Reich’s new method evolved from his studies of Hebrew cantillation in the 1970s: “[After the cantillation studies], the preservation of the semantic meaning of the words became for Reich a central concern, and sound aspects of spoken language, such as intona- tion, timbre, melodic cadences, and metric accentuation became the defining elements of musical structure.” See Puca, “Steve Reich and Hebrew Cantillation,” 537. 64.

Reich maintains the typical format of the Fortunoff interviews in Different Trains, which bears a three-movement structure moving from prewar memo- ries to postwar reflection. The work begins with discussion of events “Before the War,” as if Reich had been asked by an outside interviewer to “start at the beginning.” Not unlike Paul, Rachel, and Rachella, he selects an early child- hood moment as a starting point for the narrative and works it into a metaphor flexible enough to address the subjects of both personal and histori- cal tragedy without seeming mundane or trite. The phrase “from New York to Los Angeles” becomes his marker of an early childhood trauma—the divorce of his parents—and Mr. Davis’s mention of the “crack train from New York” provides the transition to the second movement, “Europe—During the War,” in which the “different trains” of the title finally appear. True to the format of the Fortunoff interviews, which generally leads their subjects to comment on their postwar American experience at the conclusion of the testimony, the piece ends with “After the War,” in which Reich reprises the voices of Virginia, Mr. Davis, Paul, and Rachella. At first, the inclusion of Rachella’s voice in this postwar movement appears to depart from the composition’s chronological ordering; she remembers an event that took place during the war at Ausch-  witz, not after the war as the other sound clips do. Consultation of the original source tapes reveals, however, that this memory appears at the conclusion of her testimony in response to a series of exit questions about the current state of postwar America.69 In preserving the position of Rachella’s memory, Reich maintains the integrity of her witness in Different Trains. Despite the conclu- sion of the war, Rachella’s traumatic memories persist as part of her contem- porary reality; past and present seem to know no definitive divide, either within her testimony or in the final postwar movement of Different Trains. A secondary frame also exists in the Fortunoff collection: the technical, filmic dimensionof the testimonies. How the witnesses appear on the screen— 67. Young,Writing and Rewriting the Holocaust, 159. 68. Stier, Committed to Memory, 76. 69. Unlike the Fortunoff interviews, at the conclusion of her interview, Rachella—whose tes- timony was recorded for preservation in the Weiner Oral History Library—is asked a series of fixed exit questions in order to gauge her current values and belief systems. They range from her opinion of the Vietnam War and postwar presidents to whether or not she still observes the Sabbath. </page> <page sequence="17"> The Testimonial Aesthetics of Different Trains 115 in tight focus, from a wider angle, with the interviewers off-screen—is perhaps the most obvious type of visual framing, one whose expressive ramifications have been well documented in the field of cinematic studies.70 In the Fortun - off videos, the camera technician essentially edits the visual experience, allow- ing us to view the testimony from the perspective of one of the interviewers. We see only what the videographer allows us to see, and in this sense the cam- era not only acts as subtle narrator of the testimonies but also affects the recep- tion of the witnessed account. As Stier contends: Without this frame there would be no testimony, no mediation, nothing for us to watch. But this frame is also somewhat deceptive—it gives the illusion (par- tially true) that the witness is speaking directly to us, the viewers. This illusion is beneficial, for it lends a sense of immediacy to the testimonial proceedings. In actuality, the witness is speaking to us through intermediaries.71 Moreover, because the prompting from the off-screen interviewers is limited, viewers tend to become subsumed in the emotional sincerity of the testi- monies and forget the other layers of mediation.72 Geoffrey Hartman warns of the power of this voyeurism, reminding us that the testimonies are not just “out there, complete, objectivated; [they are] also in a frame or with a dimen- sion which is that of reception and therefore interpretation.”73 Testimony requires transference, a transmission from the witness to the lis- tener, in which the narrative passes from one vessel to another, but at each stage—from recollection to utterance to receipt—the danger of misrepresen- tation arises. The listener plays, therefore, a central role in traumatic witness; indeed, Dori Laub argues that “by extension, the listener . . . comes to be a participant and a co-owner of the traumatic event: through his very listening, he comes to partially experience trauma in himself.”74 The testimony there- fore includes its hearer, who represents “the blank screen on which the event comes to be inscribed for the first time. . . . But such an auditor is hardly and rarely untainted, for she brings to her side of the television screen her own  interests and agenda and her own preconceptions of the Holocaust. She be- comes the coauthor of the testimony.”75 70. See Stier, Committed to Memory, 70–72. 71. Ibid., 74. 72. As Geoffrey Hartman observes, there is one significant advantage to the videotaped testi- mony, which is that “the immediacy of these first-person accounts burns through the ‘cold stor- age of history.’ It gives texture to memory or to images that otherwise would have only sentimental or informational impact. . . . In fact, these personal narratives, though less shocking and fixating than many photos, could overwhelm viewers or arouse inappropriate defenses.” See Hartman, The Longest Shadow: In the Aftermath of the Holocaust, 138. 73.

Stier, Committed to Memory, 92. </page> <page sequence="18"> 116 Journal of the American Musicological Society Similarly, Reich involves his listeners in Different Trains by conceiving of their imaginations as the stage for his documentary theater of the mind. This puts the representational onus on the audience, who are given short yet sug- gestive sound clips and expected to stitch together the fragmented memories extracted from the survivors’ fraught testimonies. The drama is, in a sense, ours to construct from his raw material, which we trust is faithful to the origi- nal sentiments and tone of the primary witness. And yet, as Stier astutely ar- gues, memory can never “make a ‘first’ impression here,” since the receiver’s mind is never a blank slate.76 In addition to revealing parallels between Different Trains and the struc- ture and aesthetics of the primary witness accounts, consultation of the source recordings also provides insight into the way minimalist techniques shaped Reich’s secondary witness. Different Trainswas the result of a three-step com- positional process in which Reich’s techniques of selection, suture, and substi- tution alienate the distinct accounts from the experiences of the survivors, assembling them as Reich’s own personalized remembrance. His psychologi- cal engagement with their traumatic stories is traceable in his editorial deci- sions, which reveal his involvement as a secondary witness. Far from a simple process of musical transcription, the piece illuminates the representational dangers inherent in secondary witness and uncovers the silent presence of more than a few different trains in the work. Identifying the Witnesses: Selection Reich’s chosen excerpts for Different Trains are scattered through nearly eight hours of prerecorded Holocaust testimony. In the years after the premiere, Reich remained cryptic about how he had selected the excerpts for the second movement, all of which derive from one of the three survivor accounts. When asked what drove his textual choices, Reich insisted that they were based on purely musical criteria, namely the rhythmic pulse and intonation patterns of the speech.77 Later, however, in an interview from 1994, he acknowledged that he had also selected excerpts partly according to content, admitting that “what [the survivors] say [was] chosen both for the meaning of the words and the speech melody simultaneously.”78 The intrusion of personal preference into supposedly unintentional compo- sitions was not unprecedented at the time. In 1988, John Cage wrote I–VI, his indeterminate composition for the Charles Eliot Norton lectures at Harvard University, using chance operations to select the textual material for the talks. As Jann Pasler revealed, Cage was not satisfied with the end result 76. Ibid. 77. Reich, “Questionnaire (1989),” 159. 78. Reich, “Answers to Questions about Different Trains (1994),” 181. </page> <page sequence="19"> The Testimonial Aesthetics of Different Trains 117 and therefore eliminated from the talks those words that he “didn’t want” in the composition, thereby heightening the political tone of the work: “He ad- mitted his [revised] lines were ‘highly suggestive’ and that he ‘wanted that suggestion to . . . be in a spirit [he] agreed with.’ . . . As he grew older, com- municating a message seemed to be more important, a message not only about music but also about the world and its future.”79 Reich similarly sug- gests that his selections were motivated by his desire to create a coherent and emblematic account of Jewish persecution in Europe—in short, a narrative that accorded with his own understanding of the Holocaust. Recovering the original context of these specific phrases exposes not only his aesthetic plans for the articulation, instrumentation, and repetition that would shape the piece, but also the emotional pull of his own experiences rid- ing trains. In several cases, the testimonies arguably appealed to Reich for rea- sons that were later obscured by his narrowing of the sonic frame to brief textual passages, which reinforced the impression that the music (and not the program) drove his decisions. The archival sources reveal, however, that many of the key phrases derive from survivor memories that revolve around train travel during the war. This revelation suggests an even deeper relationship be- tween the personal program for the work—the varied experiences of riding trains during World War II—and the vocal lines used in the wartime move- ment of Different Trains, most of which do not mention trains explicitly.  Paul Even before he begins to share his wartime memories, Paul’s nervousness is readily apparent to the viewer of his archival videotape. Beads of sweat stream down the sides of his face and stain his denim shirt. In Paul’s remembrance, the camps are not central images, since he often found means of escaping the various ghettos to which he was confined.80 There is also an intense, emo- tional schism in Paul’s testimony that is audible in his voice. As he remembers his relatives, his voice softens into a quiet baritone and a smile overtakes his face; often the interviewers have to prompt him to continue when he seems paralyzed, lost in reverie. At other times, he sounds angry and percussive, es- pecially when remembering humiliating moments of anti-Semitic discrimina- tion. One such instance, at the hands of his second-grade teacher, finds its way into Different Trains: He started to make a speech, and the speech began something like this. He said, “Black Crows invaded our country many years ago . . . and they were eating 79. Pasler, “Intention and Indeterminacy in John Cage’s I–VI,” 373. See also Pritchett, The Music of John Cage, 3. 80. Paul and his mother avoided deportation several times through a series of bribes, al- liances, and an extensive period of hiding in the forests of Hungary. He did spend time in the Kosice Ghetto, but smugglers later helped him escape before the liquidations. </page> <page sequence="20"> 118 Journal of the American Musicological Society away at the flesh and blood of our country. And these crows were the JEWS” and he pointed right at me. It was horrifying, and I was very scared and I was also very, very angry. I remember my anger.81 These anti-Semitic attacks confused the young Paul, who had never self- identified as a Jew except during a year when he lived with his grandparents, who were themselves religiously observant. As an adult, this early disconnect from his own Jewishness continued to manifest itself in a recurring nightmare in which God violently splits him in two, a total bifurcation and annihilation of self. His internal schism is no longer purely emotional or spiritual—it is physi- cal and destructive. Reich’s use of Paul’s testimony allowed for greater musical contrasts in Different Trains, a benefit that Reich himself noted in an interview in which he discussed the gendered manner in which he assigned the speech melodies to the string quartet: “In the finished piece, each time a woman speaks she is doubled by the viola, and each time a man speaks he is doubled by the cello.”82 These shifts in instrumentation not only involve the obvious parame- ter of timbre, but also impact the musical textures of Different Trains, since the short motives intoned by the lower instruments generally become sub- sumed by the dense soundscape of the full ensemble. Perhaps for this reason, Reich chose excerpts in which men articulate their narratives percussively,  often with marked emphasis on hard consonants, which allow their motives to emerge from the background (“The Crack Train” “Black Crows”). Even when the verbal excerpts are not distinctly articulated, Reich created motives from them that are rhythmically intense, a quality that causes Paul’s speech melodies to contrast with those of the women, to whom Reich ac- corded more lyrical and legato musical realizations. Paul’s final utterance in Different Trains—“and the war was over”—is one such case in point. Here, the speech melody precedes our hearing of Paul’s text, and its initial, isolated statement in the cello sparks a series of crisp, angular countermotives in the upper strings (see Exx. 2a and 2b). When Paul finally speaks in measure 28, we are conditioned to hear his text in this intense and dramatic manner, deliv- ered with a sense of urgency that seems to drive the words from his mouth. In the original testimony, however, Paul’s remembrance of the war’s end is anti-climactic, an afterthought sparked by the interviewer’s interruption of a more poignant memory of his mother: Paul: (smiling at a photo of his mother) The general in charge of the Hungarian army fell in love with my mother, and he kept courting her, and he got together a musical ensemble from this troop and serenaded her. It was nice. (Smiles and begins to laugh quietly) 81. Paul D. Holocaust Testimony (T-0048), Fortunoff Video Archive for Holocaust Testi - monies, Yale University Library.

Early in his testimony, Paul recalled the moment at which his family decided to smuggle him out of Slovakia, a mem- ory that persisted not because it contributed to his survival but because his  innocent anticipation of the train ride was so strong: A lot of the kids, the children from Slovakia who had the opportunity, were at this point being smuggled to Hungary—to safety. [. . .] I remember telling [my mother], trying to convince her that this would definitely be a safe place for me. But all along what I really wanted to do was have the adventure of a train ride, because I knew I would be going on a train. [. . .] I wanted the ad- venture. So, I didn’t think this would last for a very long time. It just felt like a fun thing to do. That I know. And so, when the train left, I was sitting on the train with the smuggler, a woman. I was being smuggled across as her son. I  remember I was really filled with excitement.84 Such youthful enthusiasm recalls Reich’s own memories of criss-crossing America on trains and riding the rails with his own adult female companion, a common moment of excitement and childlike eagerness. Rachel Rachel’s appearance in Different Trains is brief, perhaps because in her Holo-  caust story, she rarely rides trains. Instead, she walks. In 1941, soon after her seventh birthday, her family delivered her to a priest, who hid her from the Gestapo in a series of Catholic orphanages. Whenever the nuns feared that she would be discovered, they would shuttle her clandestinely from one safe haven to the next, always on foot and under the cover of darkness. During the next four years, Rachel remembered living in four convents and assuming at least three pseudonyms—Rosa La Fleur, Genevieve Le Brun, and Marie Rose DuPont—names that marked her experience of the various stages of the Holo caust. At the conclusion of the war, she was reunited with her mother, who survived three years in Auschwitz, but not with her father, who had died in the camp. Shortly after their reunion, the two women emigrated to America with Rachel’s new stepfather, whom her mother met in the line of a food-bank sponsored by the Red Cross. In Different Trains, Reich employs Rachel as a transitional figure, one who provides a short but necessary segue from Paul’s story to Rachella’s memories of Auschwitz. Although the specific details differ, Paul and Rachel share the experience of anti-Semitic taunting at school, and Reich capitalized upon this connection.85 After Paul’s excerpts, Reich spliced in Rachel’s remembrance of 84. Ibid. 85. It should be noted that Rachella speaks only briefly of her education in her testimony, mentioning only that she had to attend a segregated Jewish school after the Nazi invasion of Holland. </page> <page sequence="23"> The Testimonial Aesthetics of Different Trains 121 a note that she brought home from school one day: “No more school for your child. No more Jewish children in school.”86 This note plays an important role in Rachel’s testimony; it defines the moment when she first became aware  of anti-Semitism, the instance when the “whole thing really started.” A few weeks later, her father brought her to the local train station to meet the priest who took her into hiding. It was from this train that she last saw her father alive: The tramway was like a block away from the house where [. . .] we lived. And my mother could not take me to those people—my father took me. My mother was crying and crying so . . . my father took me to the tramway. [. . .] I remem- ber the tramway. I remember my father crying like a baby in the middle of the street while he was taking me to those people—to strangers. And he explained to me: “Don’t forget, you’re a Jewish little girl. We’re going to see you again. But you must do that. You must go away. And we are doing this for your best.” Because of course I couldn’t understand. [. . .] So I went on the tramway with those people.87 To the casual listener, Rachel’s two lines appear more functional than emotive, a means of moving the libretto from childhood memories of school (“no more school”) to the actual trains themselves (“you must go away”). In real- ity, these two lines reflect the most traumatic moment of Rachel’s life—the “beginning” of her Holocaust testimony and her final farewell to her father.  Reich’s musical treatment of Rachel’s lines imbues her fragile voice with a sense of foreboding not present in the original excerpts. While her second statement derives from a passage in which the adult Rachel is palpably over- whelmed (a passage that therefore required little dramatic framing), Reich’s truncation of her first line heightens its drama. In the original testimony, Rachel’s phrase, “No more school for your child” is delivered calmly and with a natural pacing. It swells in both dynamics and inflection, peaking at mid- sentence (“school”) and then subsiding. Reich’s cut occurs right at the highest point, which causes Rachel to sound full of trepidation (see Ex. 3). And be- cause the phrase has no close, the cut gives the musical realization a sense of forward motion and abrupt interruption.  Considering the small role that Rachel plays in Different Trains, it is fair to wonder why Reich included her testimony, which duplicates the instrumenta- tion of Rachella (viola) and contributes little significant material to the second movement. Why was her voice so important? It is possible that personal rea- sons were at play. At the conclusion of her testimony, Rachel recalls a recent visit of her mother to her home in Boca Raton: My mother came to visit me two months ago, [. . .] and I was careful while she was here.

Just as in Different Trains, his- tory and memory comingle here in the imaginations of artists like Reich and survivors like Rachel. 88. Rachel G. Holocaust Testimony. </page> <page sequence="25"> The Testimonial Aesthetics of Different Trains 123 Rachella Rachella’s testimony, which is preserved on audio tape at the Weiner Oral History Library, is isolated from any visual cues, yet the cassette mesmerizes the listener as she recounts her Holocaust experience with a certain emotional distance that allows her to speak calmly and clearly. The measured pacing of her account not only ensures the comprehensibility of her tale, which contains a cache of vivid images, poetic sentiments, and specific details, but also reduces the dangers of voyeurism—the listener’s need to witness a survivor’s suffering in order to feel satisfied or emotionally moved by the account. Rachella is a steadfast and earnest witness, and her colorful metaphors and conversational tone make her voice apt for translation into speech melodies. Indeed, her lyri- cal voice comprises the majority of the second movement, to which she con- tributes memories of the Nazi invasion of Holland and her journey to and internment in Auschwitz. Of the three survivors whose testimonies appear in Different Trains, Rachella is the only one to have experienced the camps di- rectly, and images from her narrative ground Different Trains in a common set of Holocaust tropes. Her descriptions ring familiar; we know them from other sources. As in the well-known story of Anne Frank, Rachella and her family hid in the attic of a friend’s business in Holland. Upon discovery, she and her family were deported, a degrading scene that unfolded as it did for many: “You had to secure yourself a little place in that [cattle] wagon to survive. And if you did not secure a place, you could be standing for weeks. Just standing, hanging because we were . . . there was room for thirty or forty people, and there were, like, eighty people in oneof those wagons.”89 What follows in her testimony— cattle cars, shaved heads, tattooed forearms—are the central images of Holocaust literature and art. Thus, by selecting Rachella’s testimony for Different Trains, Reich ensured that the memorial contours of his piece would resonate for his postwar audience, who would have encountered similar  portrayals of the Holocaust in media as diverse as Elie Wiesel’s novel Night and Meryl Streep’s films Holocaust and Sophie’s Choice.90 Perhaps not inconsequently, the pivotal moments of Rachella’s wartime narrative either take place on or involve trains, and Reich derives most of his speech samples in the second movement from the passages in which Rachella recalls them.91 In her first appearance, she intones the year “1940” and the 89. Rachella M. Holocaust Testimony, P, Oral Histories, Box 189, no. 1, Holocaust Survivors Project, William E. Wiener Oral History, tape 2, side A. 90. Streep starred in two Holocaust dramas credited with bringing awareness of the genocide to a mass public in both America and West Germany: the 1978 television mini-series Holocaust, and the 1982 feature film Sophie’s Choice. 91. In the second movement, Rachella’s phrase, “She said, ‘Quick! Go!’ And he said, ‘Don’t breathe,’ ” derive from her remembrance of a Nazi raid on the house where she and her family were hiding. The remainder of her excerpts all center around experiences involving trains or  deportation. </page> <page sequence="26"> 124 Journal of the American Musicological Society phrase, “The Germans walked in,” both from her account of the Nazi inva- sion of Holland. Here, the gravity of the situation becomes a reality for the young Rachella only after her father is unable to reach Rotterdam by train: It was his day to go. He used to travel to Rotterdam to see his clients, and the train ran on the railroad track up until that day they had blocked that city, and then you couldn’t see where you were. I remember he came home and cried, he was so upset. It was absolutely flat. There was nothing left of that city. And, in the night especially, the bombs were dropping, and we would go and sit in the house, and we would have everything black, dark shades down, and. . . . It was a terrible week, and thank God, it only lasted a week. It was so terrible. And, after five days, the Germans walked in.92 After the invasion, Rachella and her family went into hiding in Scheveningen, a small town on the coast. In 1944, after several months of hiding in the attic of a local store, she and her family were arrested and deported to Auschwitz. In one passage, from which Reich sampled the phrase “into cattle wagons for four days and four nights,” Rachella painfully tries to describe the loading process: This time we were all put into the cattle wagons. We went to the railroad and there they were. I don’t know how many of them. And half the camp was emp- tied out into the cattle wagons. There were quite a few of us. I don’t remember exactly how many. I would say maybe a few hundred. Also, the men were loaded into the cattle wagons. The men with the men, and the women with the women. We were into those cattle wagons for four days and four nights. Then they stopped and they would go on again.93 Detached from its original context, Rachella’s incorrect preposition in her sampled phrase (“we were into”) draws no attention; during the performance the listener can easily supply several possible constructions: “We were herded into” or “They placed us into.” Knowledge of the full quotation, however, al- lows us to see the linguistic process by which Rachella arrived at the quote sampled by Reich, a process in which the phrase “into the cattle wagons” be- comes something of a mantra in her account that punctuates her final state- ment: “We were into those cattle wagons for four days and four nights.” Given the minimalistic aesthetic of Reich’s earlier tape works, in which short samples are repeated and gradually transform themselves into new manifesta- tions, the mutation of Rachella’s refrain brings to mind Reich’s tape loops and presents an interesting aesthetic connection between her ways of remember- ing and Reich’s compositional processes. 92.

She remembers how she first heard that the war was nearing its close on one particular transport from Poland to Germany: We were put on a train again and brought to another camp. It was not very far away. I think maybe we spent a day on the railroad, stopping and going, stop- ping and going. [. . .] The war was closing in on them and they were losing.  [. . .] We had also heard rumors of that. As I said, there was a way that you did found [sic] out these things, that the war had . . . was coming to an end.94 In a passage that follows, Reich found his opening material for the third move- ment of Different Trains, which employs the phrases “Are you sure?” and “The war was over” from Rachella’s final transport: As we come [sic] into the Danish station, the German Wehrmacht left the train and the Danish Red Cross people jumped on the wagons in their blue uni- forms. And they said to us in German, “You are in Demark now. You are free.” And we said, “Are you sure, are you sure? Is it really true? It is not true. You are not telling us the truth.” And we touched them and we . . . they said, “It is true. You are free. You are in Denmark. [. . .] You are free. The war is over.”95 Like the cattle wagon passage, Rachella’s narrative is here full of repetition and restatement, in this case as a means of conveying her initial disbelief at the  report of liberation. Reich’s decision to draw many of Rachella’s excerpts from refrains in her speech ultimately connects his musical preference for repetition with her own testimonial reiterations. In Different Trains, these textual repeti- tions, whether explicit or hidden, find an appropriate backdrop in the music of the prerecorded string quartets and sampled train whistles, which provide the regular and persistent hum of the rails as accompaniment. Rewriting the Holocaust: Suture and Substitution That Reich selected these sound clips and removed them from their original contexts is part and parcel of his compositional process. Yet, greater interven- tion is apparent in several instances in which he appears to have rewritten the testimonies to some extent, largely by repositioning the isolated, decontextu- alized fragments. Here his “composing” ventures beyond mere editing, and, according to critics of the notion of historical realism, it constitutes an act  of writing. In the words of the literary scholar Robert Scholes, “all writing,  all composition, is construction. We do not imitate the world, we construct 94. Ibid., tape 3, side A. 95. Ibid. The excerpted phrases (designated by italics) appear in mvt. 3, mm. 66–100. </page> <page sequence="28"> 126 Journal of the American Musicological Society versions of it. There is no mimesis, only poiesis. No recording. Only construct- ing.”96 As for historical realism, Scholes argues that there are no “objective texts” but only relationships between texts that are subject to the poetics of the author. Within Holocaust studies, this view has been championed by James Young, who notes that “both [historical] events and their representa- tions are ultimately beholden to the forms, language, and critical methodology through which they are grasped” by the author; the resulting transcriptions are thus limited by the artist’s own impressions of the Holocaust.97 Such po- etic engagement with trauma merges the materials of life with the tropes of fiction; as Hayden White reminds us in Tropics of Discourse: “ ‘Poetizing’ is not an activity that hovers over, transcends, or otherwise remains alienated from life or reality, but which represents a mode of praxis which serves as the imme- diate base of all cultural activity.”98 In Different Trains, two layers of poetic translation contribute to the final form of the libretto. The first is the poetics of primary witness, as Holocaust survivors remember their experiences and attempt to articulate them in lan- guage (the challenge faced by the survivor Chaim E. cited earlier in this arti- cle). The second involves Reich’s compilation of these mediated excerpts into a master-narrative of the Holocaust (secondary witness). In the composition, Reich’s interpretations penetrate the primary accounts of Paul, Rachel, and Rachella and reshape their narratives according to a poetics of the Holocaust that involves small but not insignificant revisions to their testimony. In a few instances, these points of contact between Reich’s poem (the libretto of Different Trains) and those of the survivors (their testimonies) result in mal- formations and misprisions that deviate from the originals in both style and meaning.99 These constructions, whether intentional or not, remain hidden to listeners, whose only guide is Reich’s official transcript of the testimonies, pro- vided in the concert program or liner notes, and his assurance that what you are about to hear is a “musical reality.” Analysis of the source material reveals two primary methods of poetic con- struction, which I term suture and substitution. Suture denotes a merger of two distinct texts along shared textual or contextual lines with the goal of pre- serving situational or linguistic resonances between discrete testimonies. Substitution indicates those places where Reich replaces words in the original testimony based on his (mis)hearing of the narratives, effectively supplanting the survivor’s interpretation of the Holocaust with his own reading of its cul- tural and literary tropes.  As noted earlier, Reich uses musical repetition to create static episodes in Different Trains, with each harmonic block generated from a single speech 96.

See Bloom, A Map of Misreading, 20. </page> <page sequence="29"> The Testimonial Aesthetics of Different Trains 127 melody. And yet, with the exception of two phrases from the first movement— “from New York to Los Angeles” (Mr. Davis) and “one of the fastest trains” (Virginia)—none of the speech melodies appears twice in the piece.100 Reich says he intentionally tried to avoid textual repetition, especially in the second movement, in order to focus attention on the spoken speech melodies, stating “it seemed appropriate not to repeat what was said. If you don’t hear what one of the Holocaust survivors says, you miss it.”101 One of the means by which Reich edited textual redundancy out of Different Trains was through splicing together excerpts and omitting phrases that seemed duplicative. The result was a new Holocaust narrative generated by Reich’s interpretation of the connections between the discrete testimonies. His process is akin to that of filmic suture, a procedure theorized by film scholar Kaja Silverman. She argues that the directorial intention of film, including documentary, is “articulated and the viewing subject [revealed] by means of interlocking shots . . . which are the equivalent of syntactic ones in linguistic discourse, as the agency whereby meaning emerges and a subject-position is constructed for the viewer.”102 In her view, a filmic suture both structures absence and loss (with narratological fissure and fragmentation being enacted in the cuts) and reveals the invisible subject of any film—its editor-author. When one consults the full testimonies, it becomes clear that textual paral- lels and analogous historical contexts inclined Reich to hear excerpts as re- lated, regardless of their disparities. In many cases, Reich sutures together two phrases that contain nearly identical textual phrases, preserving and heighten- ing instances of shared vocabulary between the discrete testimonies. For ex- ample, Rachella’s account of the Nazi invasion of Holland (“the Germans walked into Holland”) precedes Paul’s announcement that “the Germans in- vaded Hungary” (see Table 1). Reich appears to have linked these two ex- cerpts not only because their subject matter is similar (both are descriptions of Nazi invasions) but also because they share a common phrase: “walked in.”103 It remains hidden from the listener, who hears only Rachella use it due to the truncation of Paul’s narrative. Reich’s editing probably aimed to avoid musical and textual redundancy, since bothof Paul’s testimonial phrases possess a simi- lar cadential structure. Had Reich included the second phrase, it would not have generated new musical material and therefore would have kept the piece from moving toward a new speech melody, typically the generator for new harmonic centers in the work. The historical context of these excerpts also appears to have influenced  the form of Different Trains, an insight that helps explain one of Reich’s most 100. Reich reprises these two speech melodies in the third movement, where they remind the listener of the earlier memories of the historic trains, thus prefacing Mr. Davis’s next speech melody, “but today, they’re all gone.” 101.

Reich’s Libretto On my birthday (Rachella) The Germans walked in (Rachella)  Walked into Holland (Rachella) Germans invaded Hungary (Paul) debated decisions. At the opening of movement three, Reich juxtaposes Paul’s remark (“And the war was over”) with Rachella’s question (“Are you sure?”), an exchange that some critics have interpreted as a political statement con- cerning the persistence of fascism and anti-Semitism.104 In 1994, when asked whether this moment constituted a potential moral for the work, Reich re- sponded that he “had no such question in mind. It is rather the tentative qual- ity of [Rachella’s] voice and [the] feeling that ‘Are you sure?’ gives, along with its purely musical content, that made me choose it.”105 Reich avers that his concerns were exclusively musical, but the archival recordings suggest that he might also have sutured along contextual lines (see Table 2). Both excerpts derive from passages in which the witness learns that the war had ended. In the case of Rachella, the Red Cross workers tell her that the war is over, she questions the statement, and then her rescuers confirm that the war is indeed over. Reich preserves her dramatization in Different Trains, in which he inter- polates Paul’s deep voice and juxtaposes it with Rachella’s, creating the same exchange between two characters. Such contextual considerations also explain why Rachel’s voice is absent in movement three, since her testimony does not contain a story about when she heard the war had ended. Thus, the source recordings suggest that Reich used silent sutures to preserve the historical and dramatic commonalities between Rachella’s and Paul’s accounts. 104. See Reich, “Answers to Questions about Different Trains (1994),” 182. Here, inter- viewer Wolfgang Gratzner asks Reich whether it was his intent in this section “to keep the quoted skeptical question in mind as a question about present forms of fascism.” 105.

As he insists, their “phrases cannot be played with in the same manner as those in the first movement.”107 His respect for the individual testimonies also boosts his claims of responsibility, which Reich considers paramount to his intent in  the work: “What makes this piece work is that it contains the voices of these 106. Reich, “Different Trains (1988),” 151. 107. Reich, “Answers to Questions about Different Trains (1994),” 182. One wonders why he excludes Virginia and Lawrence Davis from this discussion—why their voices can be “played with” without regard for the integrity of their stories. Considering that most Pullman porters working at the time of Reich’s travels were black, the notion that Mr. Davis’s comments are free for manipulation and distortion (unlike those of the Holocaust survivors) raises questions about racial representation and musical appropriation in Different Trains. While outside the scope of this study, a history of black suffering (and its omission from Different Trains) also seems to under- score Reich’s development of a narrative suited to his own interests, in this case, a focus on Jewish persecution. Since the premiere of Different Trains, Lawrence Davis’s recollections as a Pullman Porter have been published in two studies of oral history and his personal effects featured at the Smithsonian exhibition, “America on the Move,” at the National Museum of American History. See Isay and Wang, Holding On: Dreamers, Visionaries, Eccentrics, and Other American Heroes; Santino, Miles of Smiles, Years of Struggle: Stories of Black Pullman Porters; and the online program for the Smithsonian at http://americanhistory.si.edu/ONTHEMOVE/exhibition. </page> <page sequence="32"> 130 Journal of the American Musicological Society people recounting what happened to them, and I am simply transcribing their speech melody and composing from that musical starting point. The docu- mentary nature of the piece is essential to what it is.”108 Reich’s final assertion is problematic, however, in that his work is not just simple transcription of “what happened to them” but also a record of his own hearing of the testi- monies. Moreover, in some spots in Rachella’s testimony, Reich’s transcription substitutes alternative words or phrases (whether consciously or uncon- sciously). These substitutions complicate Reich’s statements—which consis- tently emphasize documentary, objectivity, and essence—and potentially affect the memorial experience of the work for the audience. Rachella’s testimony is pivotal, since hers is the one that provides the famil- iar narrative of Auschwitz. As movement two progresses, the other survivors are cited with less frequency, in part because their experiences are less reflective of the emblematic ways in which Americans imagine the Holocaust. When Rachella is finally deported to a concentration camp, she is sent to Auschwitz, which allows Reich to tap into a number of familiar icons that have come to signify the broader dehumanization of the Holocaust: being stripped of her hair, clothes, and name.109 Such symbolic images were important to Reich, as he admitted in an interview with Rebecca Kim from 2000: I copied [from the testimonies] what I felt were not only riveting stories but stories told in a musical tone of voice. Then I came back and went through all this material, stopping every time I got to something that seemed emblematic— “Nineteen forty-one”—emblematic in what it said, and emblematic in the speech melody of how it was said.110 Reich facilitates the staging of Different Trains in our minds by selecting fa- miliar images, making it possible for us to imagine the drama and bridge any narrative gaps in the libretto. I would hypothesize, however, that the cultural strength of these symbols affected Reich’s own imagining, leading him to  substitute or mishear partly because he expected to hear the usual tale of Auschwitz: deportations, selections, exterminations, and cremations. The first substitution occurs at the conclusion of movement two, in which Rachella (via Reich) describes her arrival at Auschwitz in 1944. Reich closes her account with the phrase, “Flames going up to the sky—It was smoking,” 108. Steve Reich in an interview with Rebecca Y. Kim, “From New York to Vermont: Conversation with Steve Reich (2000),” www.stevereich.com (accessed 4 July 2007). As James Young notes, “the ‘docu-novelists’ and ‘docu-dramatists’ of the Holocaust work as hard at manu- facturing their own testimonial authority as part of their fictional discourse.” See Young, “Holocaust Documentary Fiction,” in Literature of the Holocaust, ed. Harold Bloom (Phila del - phia: Chelsea House, 2004), 75. 109. It should be noted that some of these experiences, which have now become icons of the Holocaust writ large, were actually specific only to Auschwitz, such as the tattooing of identifica- tion numbers on the forearms of the inmates. Within memorial culture, they have come to func- tion as a visual metaphor for the greater genocide. 110. Kim, “From New York to Vermont.” </page> <page sequence="33"> The Testimonial Aesthetics of Different Trains 131 imagery that calls to mind the mass cremation of Jews. In this instance, Reich has revised Rachella’s testimony, since the account derives from an experience she had while being unloaded from her cattle car: Then it was our turn. They opened our cattle wagon doors and we went down on the platform. It was very dark and when I looked up to the sky, it was kind of like a red sky and kind of flames going up in the sky. It was smoky and I said to my—the girls around me. Look at that pretty sky, it’s red.111 In order to emphasize this moment, Reich uncharacteristically rearranged the chronology of Rachella’s account, placing this excerpt out of historical se- quence.112 In the original testimony, the excerpt appears before Rachella’s ac- count of being shaved and tattooed and refers to her arrival at Auschwitz. Reich’s repositioning of the line imbues the final image, as he heard it, with a greater impact, instilling it with rhetorical weight. Significantly, Reich’s substitution transforms Rachella’s memory of her  arrival at Auschwitz—and her description of the pretty red sky—into a grave realization of the murderous activities of Auschwitz, coloring the excerpt with historical retrospection. In her testimony, Rachella notes that the platform was “smoky,” not “smoking,” a subtle (and admittedly difficult) difference to hear, but one confirmed by the official transcript of the testimony, edited and ap- proved by Rachella herself.113 Reich’s mishearing, whether intentional or not, alters the meaning of this final statement and the audience’s hearing of it. As sirens fade in the distant soundscape, audience members call to their minds— the self-confessed stage for Reich’s drama—Jewish suffering and Nazi inhu- manity; but these imaginings are engendered by Reich’s hearing of her adjective as an active (and incriminating) verb with an implied source: it—the crematorium—was smoking.  A second substitution occurs at the conclusion of movement three, in which Rachella recalls an impromptu concert performed at the women’s camp by her friends. In her testimony, Rachella uses the story to illustrate how  humor helped her to weather the traumatic experience of Auschwitz: “[We made] jokes out of a tragic situation . . . I think so that we could survive to  be able to laugh at ourselves.”114 Unaware that some German guards were watching, the women in her tale are startled when their overseer begins to laugh at their comedic antics and calls for an encore, a moment whose irony was not lost on the teenage Rachella: “And she was laughing her head off. I remember and I couldn’t believe it. One day she would hit you black and blue and there she was, sitting and laughing with us.”115 111. Rachella M. Holocaust Testimony, P, tape 2, side A.

And when she stopped singing, they said “More, And when she stopped singing, More,” and they applauded. they said, “More, More,” andthey applauded. From this passage, Reich selected three excerpts for the conclusion of the work, but once again he misheard Rachella’s testimony (see Table 3). Rather than Rachella’s words, in which the Germans “laughed to listen to the singing,” Reich transcribes “and they loved to listen to the singing,” a substitu- tion that transforms the closing excerpt of Different Trains—“and when she stopped singing they said, ‘More! More!’ and they applauded”—from a scene of levity or even mockery to one of aesthetic appreciation.116 What impact does this small mistake have on the conclusion of Different Trains? I would argue a significant one. The Jewish girl, instead of provoking laughter with her entertaining renditions of English songs, now sings so  beautifully that she inspires “love” among her cold-hearted Nazi captors; from brutality and indifference, she moves them to applause. And, as they are moved, so is the audience listening to Different Trains, in part because Reich chooses this moment to introduce the work’s most lyrical speech melody, which contrasts with the more angular motives heard just before (see Ex. 4). Amidst this scene of human compassion and aesthetic beauty, Reich loops Rachella’s words, “More! More!” until the end of the quartet. After the final movement has receded into silence, the real memorial work of the piece be- gins. It is in this moment that the postwar audience plays an active role in Reich’s drama; they begin to applaud—for Reich, the performance, and the memory of the singing Jewish girl. Their applause collectively reclaims her from the gaze of her Nazi audience and provides the work with a redemptive ending that effectively revises the closing text. Instead of “They loved to listen to the singing, the Germans,” the audience’s ovation might assert “We loved to listen to the singing, the audience.” Here, at the close of the work, Reich provides the audience with a role to play, for our minds are the stage for this memorial play, and we are the site of remembrance itself.117 116.

In a lively discussion at the Seventy-Third Annual Meeting of the American Musico - logical Society in Quebec City, 2007, I was reminded by Richard Taruskin and Ralph Locke that the experience of hearing Different Trains varies greatly among audience members depending on whether the listener encountered the work live or via a recording. The reaction given in this paper reflects my own first experience of the work, which was at a live performance. </page> <page sequence="35"> The Testimonial Aesthetics of Different Trains 133 Example 4 Rachella’s speech melody (“And when she stopped singing they said ‘More more,’ and they applauded”), Different Trains, mvt. 3, mm. 596–601  $596 Vln.

He ex- plains: “You have to put something personal in every piece you ever do. [But if ] you mean in terms of the verbal material . . . Well, it isn’t really there. All that’s really there is what I tell you in the program notes, if you have the pro- gram notes.”118 Reich’s insistence that the recorded material of Different Trains lies outside of the personal realm reinforces his claims for the work as a musical documentary, and he resists the notion that his own editorial decisions encode the work with inherent subjectivity, whether personal or cultural. Such revisions are not fleeting; the authorized printed text for Different Trains— repeatedly reproduced in concert programs, printed in compact disc liner notes, and even included in Reich’s Writings on Music—preserves a record of Reich’s mishearing of the survivor narratives. While the “verbal material” might be spoken only once in performance, the texts witness Reich’s role as a transcriber and reveal him to be the central narrator of Different Trains—he dictates its loosely framed plot, emblematic images, and textual montage and, 118. Kim, “From New York to Vermont.” </page> <page sequence="37"> The Testimonial Aesthetics of Different Trains 135 at times, changes the story. While probably not intentional, Reich’s substitu- tions reveal that this is a personal rendering, one that reflects his imagination of the Holocaust, as well as his dramatic and aesthetic preferences. He is a wit- ness to their witnessing—a mediator of their media—and thus his Different Trains is susceptible to the limitations of his own hearing and imagination.  The Limits of Representation: The Artist as Secondary Witness Historians Terrence Des Pres, Lawrence Langer, and Geoffrey Hartman all characterize secondary, or intellectual, witnesses as adoptive narrators of the Holocaust, individuals who “make us feel like close and empathic observers” but who are not necessarily bound to “testify by a moral as well as an intellec- tual engagement.”119 Such artists and scholars are removed from the trauma of the genocide itself, and thus their “imaginative discourses of art and lan- guage” are, as Ernst von Alphen argues, “secondary; that is, they can only work upon the historical discourse, which is primary.”120 When Reich began working with tape in the 1960s, he believed that audio recordings would al- low him to capture the authenticity of speech in a musical composition.121 And yet much more is consequent from the use of Holocaust testimony in Different Trains, precisely because the survivor’s voice resists objectification;  it carries its subjectivity with it. Moreover, because it is impossible to work in- differently with materials as devastating as Holocaust testimony, secondary witness is no less susceptible to the difficulties and limitations of primary wit- ness, precisely because traumatic memory resists the full grasp of the intellect and external control. By making Holocaust memory the focus of Different Trains, Reich overlooked the potential dangers of traumatic memory: it shat- ters both self and object, forcing both to retreat into imagination as a means of survival, leaving the artist to stitch together that which is permanently severed. Witness, whether primary or secondary, therefore reveals itself as an aes- thetic act rather than a historical one. As Walter Kalaidjian notes, it attempts to recapture “what escapes cognitive mastery in the event” and thus comprises an “encounter with extremity’s unfinished business.”122 This aesthetic dimen- sion is not confined to secondary witness but also emerges in primary witness accounts, in which the survivors themselves select, suture, and substitute in or- der to make sense of their lives. Such practices do not argue against the real- ness of the Holocaust; rather, they communicate the emotional weight of 119. Hartman, “The Humanities of Testimony: An Introduction,” 260.

Dori Laub relays one such instance from his own research, in which an Auschwitz survivor inaccurately described four crematorium chimneys being destroyed in an uprising, when the histori- cal record notes that only one was toppled. Laub argues that the witness “knew” in a way that none of the historians did, explaining that “she had come to testify not to the empirical number of the chimneys, but to resistance, to the affirmation of survival, to the breakage of the frame of death.”123 Thus the aesthetics of witness “recognize human limitation” and “the difficulty of accommodating traumatic experience,” for, as Geoffrey Hartman notes, the inclusion of such inaccuracies is “less a form of denial than trying to get rid of the aesthetic dimension. . . . The testimonies do not belong only to [history]. They also belong, without making them literary in any way[,] . . . to aesthetic experience.”124 Indeed, as Holocaust survivor and author Aharon Appelfeld argued the year after the premiere of Different Trains, the Holocaust seems to defy objec- tification in part because it relies so heavily on memory: The Jewish experience in the Second World War was not “historical.” We came in[to] contact with archaic mythical forces, a kind of dark subconscious the meaning of which we did not know, nor do we know it to this day. This world appears to be rational (with trains, departure times, stations, and engineers), but in fact these were journeys of the imagination, lies and ruses, which only deep, irrational drives could have invented.125 Different Trains is another of these “journeys of the imagination,” with Reich as its memory artist, attempting to make sense of the rational even as he is haunted by the irrational. As a secondary witness, it is natural that he should have bifurcated the subject of Different Trains, presenting both the survivors’ testimonies and a rewriting of the primary witness in his own musical voice. As Dori Apel contends, “the reinscription of the stories . . . makes apparent [the artist’s] desire to preserve the legacy of Holocaust experience and pass on the stories, but [it] also asserts the present conditions in which they are told . . . a contingency that necessarily shapes the narratives.”126 Thus Holocaust testi- mony of any kind, whether secondary or primary, reveals itself to be an aes- thetic act in its erosion of the boundary between history and memory.127 The specific limitations and dangers of Holocaust documentary fiction have been well addressed by James Young, who notes that the interpolation  of testimony creates a “texture of fact [that suffuses] the surrounding text with 123. Felman and Laub, Testimony, 61, 62. 124. Ballengee, “Witnessing Video Testimony,” 231–32.  125. Appelfeld, quoted in Roth, “Walking the Way of the Survivor; A Talk with Aharon Appelfeld.” 126.

Patrick Hutton has written convincingly on this false dichotomy in History as an Art of Memory. </page> <page sequence="39"> The Testimonial Aesthetics of Different Trains 137 the privilege and authority of witness.”128 At the heart of Young’s critique is the notion of intentionality—especially as it bears upon evaluation and  reception of Holocaust art—and he identifies a range of motives for authors who turn to testimonial aesthetics, among them evoking an emotional re- sponse from the audience, demonstrating a work’s factual basis, or establishing an authentic link between writer, text, and event. As Young contends: If this “rhetoric of fact” is intended to provide an unusually compelling reading experience, merely to move the reader, then Adorno’s objections to “Holo - caust art” retain a certain validity. For, in this case, the authors would indeed be wringing pleasure from the naked pain of the victims. If, on the other hand, these works . . . want to refrain from conferring an essential fictionality on ac- tual historical events, then we might take into account both the legitimate im- pulse to document events and the manner in which “real past events” are inevitably fictionalized by any narrative that gives them form.129 That Reich deliberately avoids memorial terminology and dicta such as “Never Again” seems to absolve him of what Young considers cultural ex- ploitation of Holocaust memory. Instead, Different Trains seems to fall into the latter category of documentation, a desire to present “things as they were.”  Reich’s failure, however, arises in his blind devotion to the realness of the testimonies, as seen in his staunch defense of their objectivity throughout his public writings on the work. He seems unaware that testimony inherently straddles the boundary between the aesthetic and the true and that his fram- ing of primary witness creates a secondary one. As Different Trains courses along the journey of memory at two distinct levels, it transmits both the origi- nal aesthetics and inaccuracies of the survivors’ witness as well as Reich’s own hearing of their narratives, which itself is flawed by the limitations of his own artistic approach. In this regard, Taruskin’s assertion that Reich composed “the only adequate response to the Holocaust” bears merit in that Different Trains captures not only the difficulty of giving voice to traumatic memory— the limits of historical testimony and transmission—but also the crux of the representational crisis. If Adorno has shown us that “to write poetry after Auschwitz is barbaric,” then Reich demonstrates that to remember the Holocaust in any medium is an exercise in imagination and artistry. These problems recall Aharon Appelfeld’s assessment of his own Holocaust mem- oirs: “To write things as they happened means to enslave oneself to memory, which is only a minor element in the creative process. . . . To create means  to order, sort out and choose the words and the pace that fit the work. The materials are indeed materials from [a] life, but, ultimately, the creation is an independent creature.”130 128. Young, “Holocaust Documentary Fiction,” 85. 129. Ibid., 89. 130.

This article explores the consequences that arise when fragments from very emotional testimonies are recast as purportedly unmediated documen- tary. The authority attributed to this sort of historical narrative has come  under scrutiny in the field of Holocaust studies, in which it is called “sec- ondary witness”—an intellectual interpretation of survivor testimonies ad- vanced without the author revealing his or her own subjective standpoint or scholarly agenda. I argue that Reich’s use of the voices of the survivors, Paul, Rachel, and Rachella, constitutes a form of secondary witness. Analysis of the original sources reveals that as Reich worked with extracts from the testi- monies, in some cases his composition took on the aesthetics of the original testimonies, yet in other cases, he altered meaning and tone and even mis- heard certain phrases, producing transcription errors that reframed key mo- ments by substituting his account of the Holocaust for that of the primary witness. Such revelations prompt reevaluation of the moral and political suc- cess that has been claimed for Different Trains, since the compositional process could never have been as objective and self-effacing as Reich and his critics suggest.
