<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE 'SONG OF BAGAUDA': A HAUSA KING LIST AND HOMILY IN VERSE-III1 By M. HISKETT THE AUTHENTICITY OF THE 'SONG' It is argued that this work is a native Hausa tradition, and therefore a Hausa comment on history and the confrontation between Islam and paganism. This is important because our researches have hitherto been based almost entirely upon documents of the Fulani tradition, and Hausa comment has been scant. The fact that the song is -written in Hausa is not of itself evidence of native Hausa origin, for certain of the Fulani are known to have composed in Hausa as well as Arabic and Fula. It is to the content and the imagery that we must look for this evidence. The doxology and subsequent eulogy of the Prophet are presented with a simple anthropomorphism and theological naivety which is quite unlike the sophisticated theology of the Fulani 'ulamd'. The meeting between God and Muhammad is described in terms of African notions of rank, and court etiquette. Entirely typical of an encounter between a sarki and a famous malam are the lines : 'You are distant; come nearer' 2 and: ' Stand upon the carpet, for you are greater than all. With his sandals he stepped upon it ; he was not told to take them off !' 3 This is a direct reference to the African custom of removing the shoes in the presence of a superior. Furthermore, Gabriel and the angels are presented as courtiers who are peremptorily dismissed when the sarki is engaged in a tete-a-tete with his illustrious visitor.4 The treatment of the Prophet Muthammad is significant. He is 'cheerful and munificent' 5 and the poet urges his hearers to imitate the Prophet and 'help their brethren by giving wealth and clothing... '.6 They should 'cease being angry and impatient with their kindred ',7 and so on. In fact the Prophet is portrayed as an ideal head of the extended family, and this is a popular image not in the manner of the Fulani 'ulamd'. Further evidence of the Hausa origin of the WB is provided by the imagery which the poet uses. Invalid worship is likened to guinea-corn sown on dry ground, and he who performs it waits in vain for it to sprout while the moisture in the ground dries up and the farm becomes arid.s This is a peasant simile; these are not the words of a sedentary Fulani scholar, who would have nothing to do with such peasant notions. Likewise, the detail about the thriving of 1 For parts I-II see BSOAS, xxvii, 3, 1964, 540-67 ; xxvin, 1, 1965, 112-35. 2 A1/26. 3 A1/28-9. 4 A1/19. 5 A2/14. 6 A2/7. 7 A2/9. 8 A18/24-7.</page><page sequence="2">364 M. HISKETT guinea-corn and bulrush millet sown in newly-tilled bush, which surrounds the account of the coming of Bagauda 9-all this is imagery drawn from the Hausa peasant economy; it is not the work of a Fulani. The constant repetition of the plea to the malam not to become exasperated is also an authentic touch,10 for it is well known that the malams are apt to adopt an impatient attitude to the naive inquiries of the simple people. The reference to the greed of the hyena 11 repeats a constant theme of Hausa animal fables, and so also does the reference to the ' dirty food of the heron '.12 Finally, at A7/30 we have the following lines: 'From the beginning there was prosperity and no injustice, Princeling and slaves, and the palace servants, And those who crossed over into Kano, Sokoto people and others, Whoever robbed another, he was handed over to Tata, The younger brother of the Chief Warder of Kano, the wielder of the cudgel'. These lines, which involve an admission of oppressive practices by the followers of earlier Fulani leaders are clearly an ingenuous comment on the social con- ditions of the time, and are unlikely to have originated with a representative of the new Fulani aristocracy, which was actively concerned to brand the Habe with this kind of behaviour. THE DATE OF THE ' SONG The account of Hawwa is entirely reasonable, and there is no cause to think that she was passing on anything other than what she believed to be true. The word lebura 13 must have been introduced after the beginning of the European period, but this need mean no more than that a common English loan-word has displaced an earlier native word. It in no way invalidates Hawwa's statement that the trunk of the song is ancient. The section on fatawi is associated with the theological controversies of the Fulani period, but this also is consistent with Hawwa's account. The references to Abashe and Uthmanu, which give rise to variant readings in A, B, and H support Hawwa's statement that the song was added to on the death of each sarki. H speaks of Abashe as dead : 'We pray our Lord to have mercy on Abashe, And make easy (for him) the lying in the tomb '.14 A speaks of him as still alive : 'Let us pray to God that He will lengthen the life Of Abashe, and that his days may be numerous' 15 but then goes on to speak of Uthmanu, who succeeded Abashe in 1919; thus Abashe must have been dead at the time when the lines were written down. B also refers to Uthmanu : 9 A3/27 ff. 10 A11/31 and A15/31-4. 11 A9/17. a12 A15/21. 13 A10/1. 14 BSOAS, xxvIII, 1, 1965, p. 120, n. 84. 15 A8/13-14.</page><page sequence="3">THE 'SONG OF BAGAUDA': A HAUSA KING LIST AND HOMILY IN VERSE-III 365 'Uthmanu is now upon the throne; He has reigned eight years and eight months, no longer' 16 but omits the two anachronistic lines. It is clear that the scribe of A, or possibly the reciter from whom he copied down his recension, fell into a muddle and retained lines which should have been deleted on the death of Abashe. This very human error is of a sort to be expected in an oral tradition, and need not alarm us. Clearly both A and B must have been written down after 1919, the date of Uthmanu's accession, and almost certainly before 1926, since unlike H neither makes any mention of Abdullahi Bayero who succeeded Uthmanu in this year. Unfortunately we have no way of knowing whether the song was committed to writing in earlier times, and my searches failed to reveal any MSS older than B which from its appearance might be taken to be somewhat senior to A. THE ACCOUNT OF HISTORY The king lists of the WB and of the Kano Chronicle are given for comparison. The dates attributed to the chiefs listed under WB have been calculated according to the length of reign, taking the known date of Abashe's installation by the British (April 1903/Muharram 1321) as a starting-point. The months of the Christian year are those in which the Muslim year begins.

For the latter we have at least one external control-the established dates of Muhammad b. 'Abd al-Karim al-Maghili. This Muslim revivalist is known to have corresponded with Muhamman Rumfa,'7 and he died in 1504.18 The dates given by KCh. for the reign of Muhamman Rumfa-867-904/Sept. 1462-Aug. 1498-are therefore plausible. The dates of the WB-635-65/Aug. 1237-Aug. 1266-involve a discrepancy of over 200 years, and are impossible. A comparison between the chronology of the WB and that of the KCh. shows that the two sources agree to within a year (an inevitable margin of error when one does not know the months of the Muslim years in which events occurred) back as far as the reign of Alwali who was driven out by Sulaimanu in 1807.19 Before that they become increasingly divergent, until, when we arrive at Sharifa the discrepancy extends to 87 years. Before Sharifa they diverge so considerably that comparison becomes fruitless. For the earlier kings there appears, in general, to be a discrepancy of two and a half centuries. 17 Bivar and Hiskett, BSOAS, xxv, 1, 1962, 107. 18 GAL, Suppl., II, 363; Nayl al-ibtihdj bi-tatriz al-dibaj, 330. 19 Hogben, The Muhammadan emirates of Nigeria, Oxford, 1930, 76, following KCh. Bello, however, gives 1805 for this event (Arnett, Rise of the Sokoto Fulani, Kano, 1922, 23). The WB is therefore closer to Bello's date.</page><page sequence="6">368 M. HISKETT Although the chronology is divergent, the order of succession agrees from Muhammad Bello back to SoyaIli (KCh. 1062/Dec. 1651; WB 908-58/July 1502-Jan. 1551), with the exception of Muhamman Kubari of WB, who may, however, be the same person as Alhaji Kabe son of Kumbari, of the KCh. Prior to Soyali, however, and as far back as Muhamman Rumfa the two accounts differ so greatly both in names and chronology, that comparison seems out of the question. For the earlier kings the picture is clearer. Warsa, Ajimasu, Guguwa, Bagaji, Kunajiji, and D)an Maganarku of the WB are easily identified with Warisi, Gijimasu, Gugua, Bugaya, Kanajeji, and Yaji son of Tsamia (whose mother was Maganarku) of the KCh. Makankari, Wada, and Gakin-Gakuma, who appear in all three recensions of WB, are not listed in KCh. On the other hand the following appear in KCh., and are not mentioned in WB: Yusa or Tsaraki, son of Gijimasu 530-90/Oct. 1135-Dec. 1193 Naguji 590-654/Dec. 1193-Jan. 1256 Tsamia 706-43/July 1306-June 1342 Osumanu Zamnagawa 743-50/June 1342-Mar. 1349 Dakauta1856/Jan. 1452 Atuma.I Muhamman Nazaki 1027-32/Dec. 1617-Nov. 1622 Alhaji Kabe 1156-66/Feb. 1743-Nov. 1752 The account of the early history of Kano given by the WB differs signi- ficantly from that of the KCh. It ignores the pagan priest-king Barbushe, whose prophecy figures so largely in the KCh., and commences with the famous Bagauda. The only indication of the existence of the paganism of the Dalla stock is the brief observation : ' It was then uninhabited jungle; A vast forest with nothing save idols, Waterbuck, buffalo and elephant '.20 This, however, may be accounted for by the fact that the poet is concerned only with the Hausa chiefs, and therefore is not interested in extending his list beyond Bagauda, the legendary founder of the Hausa people. What is much more significant is the account given by the WB of the arrival of Bagauda. The KCh. describes in detail the hunting economy of the Dalla stock, but tells us nothing about the arrival of the Bagauda people, except to observe that they arrived and settled in the land. The WB on the other hand first presents the Bagauda people as mighty hunters-a possible confusion with the Barbushe legend--but then goes on to describe them as agriculturalists. Bagauda and his followers came to Kano, apparently as the vanguard of a migration set off by famine, 'foraging in the dry season ',21 and subsequently settled: 20 A2/32-4. 21 A3/1.</page><page sequence="7">THE 'SONG OF BAGAUDA': A HAUSA KING LIST AND HOMILY IN VERSE-III 369 'These farmers, when they first came They cut down the forest and chopped it up. Then the rain of the hot season came down, And they sowed their seed and it sprouted and did not dry up '.22 Following this initial cultivation of the bush, the WB describes a further influx of people, driven in by famine from as far away as Asben. The Bagauda people, already established, were able to impose their rule on these newcomers, thus founding the dynasty of Habe kings which continued down to Alwali. There is no external evidence to confirm or to date such a famine in Hausa- land, but over the broader field we have ample evidence of the encroachment of the Sahara into the grass savannah. It is, of course, conjectural but certainly not fanciful to suggest that the story told by the WB is a dramatized and much abridged account of this slow southwards creep of the desert, reducing fertility in the more northerly areas such as Asben and forcing agricultural communities to migrate southwards. The tradition of immigration across the southern periphery of the desert into the grasslands of the western Sudan is well estab- lished in the folk-history not only of Kano, but of Katsina and Bornu, and there has been much speculation as to the forces which set it off. The WB is, as far as I know, the first indigenous account, however tantalizingly incomplete, to attribute a specific cause to this movement. In its account of the advent of Islam the WB is much more abrupt than the KCh. The KCh. tells of the arrival of the missionaries from Mali during the reign of Yaji (750-87/Mar. 1349-Feb. 1385), but is vague as to the precise point at which Islam was adopted by the kings. No doubt this accurately reflects the slow process by which Islam became established in the face of paganism. The WB, on the other hand, attributes the establishment of Islam squarely to Umaru (812-24/May 1409-Jan. 1421 by the KCh. dating), and refers to his predecessors as 'the pagan Hausa '.23 This is perhaps due to a natural tendency in popular tradition to simplify. Further historical information is scant, since the WVB confines itself to a recital of the length of reigns, and occasional brief comments on these reigns. The mention of a plague during the reign of Sheshe (KCh. Mohamma Shashere? 980-90/May 1572-Jan. 1582) is interesting.24 This brief mention cannot be adduced to support a chronology since outbreaks of epidemic disease riddle the history of North Africa and the Middle East. It is worthy of note, however, that in A.D. 1575 a new outbreak of the plague in Europe is recorded,25 and this is said to have originated in Constantinople. Rather less than half a century later, in 1603, there occurred the Great Plague of Egypt, in which 1,000,000 are said to have perished.26 The words of the poet, Akai loba, mutane na zubewa 'There was a plague, and the people were dropping dead', and the mere fact that in an area where epidemic disease is such a common occurrence popular 22 A3/23-6. 23 A5/14. 24 A5/35-6. 25 Encyclopaedia Britannica, s.v. ' Plague'. 26 ibid.</page><page sequence="8">370 M. HISKETT memory has recorded the incident, suggest an outbreak of exceptional propor- tions. It is therefore reasonable to suppose that this West African disaster may have been part of the pandemic pattern of plague during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. FORM AND PROSODY The WB conforms to the pattern of the Classical Arabic qas~da, to the extent that it opens with the nasib or amatory prelude. This nas7b is charac- teristic of the pre-Islamic qasida, and became conventionalized in the Islamic period. In later compositions it often took the form of an eulogy on the Prophet MuIhammad, and the opening section of the WB is clearly such a stylized nashb. Similarly, like the Classical qas.da, the poem falls into separate 'movements', although the themes which the Hausa poet chooses are remote from the Classical themes. Nevertheless, there is no doubt that this form of long Hausa poem with its introductory eulogy derives from the Classical qas~da form. The metre is wafir, a metre commonly used in the qasida, and the song rhymes in wd. As Greenberg has pointed out, this final syllable may be preceded either by an open or by a closed syllable."7 Moreover, in adopting j1 (wdw) as his rawi the Hausa poet would appear to be disregarding the strict Classical convention.28 According to the Classical authorities, the basic foot of wafir .--- may only change as follows: -.--; ---. ; and -..--. The Hausa poet, however, permits himself more latitude, and the following variations have been noted: (1) The addition of one short syllable in either of the first two feet. This is of frequent occurrence, and it therefore seems probable that we should regard it as a received variant in Hausa poetry. Some examples are: A6/1 1T sheme Shi/sh- Yakibil yat/lckannsa A6/17 Y6 mretJ kdc mo/d6 Knkiicnd 29 yad/talt15n A6/33 Kl sdn Mlhdmmdn/Klbdri dd yo/sdra-ut5 A8/3 Muihimman Bel/16 sha d'dy5 shek/dra ta and passim. 27 ' Hausa verse prosody', JAOS, LXIX, 3, 1949, 127. 28 Wright, A grammar of the Arabic language. Third edition, reissued, Cambridge, 1962, 11, 352. 29 The final syllable of Hausa names is normally pronounced short, at any rate in modern spoken Hausa. Moreover, a short syllable here would correct the metre. Nevertheless the ajami unmistakably shows a long syllable. Similarly dCaya at A8/3 below, which has a short second syllable in normal speech, but is here written with a long vowel. Such apparent anomalies are discussed more fully below.</page><page sequence="9">THE 'SONG OF BAGAUDA': A HAUSA KING LIST AND HOMILY IN VERSE-III 371 Sometimes an extra syllable is added to each of the first two feet, as at: A1/15 Sikas aslrsn/sl sA biy4 bd/nd fki A16/23 Izin kima siin/yl addit'J sun/kad /kre and exceptionally in the last foot, as at: A6/28 Da sdrki nj/tsaydyyge ma/tsawdtarw5 (2) The substitution of two short syllables for a long syllable other than the second long syllable of the first and second foot (, - -/ ~k- -/- -) which is the only position in which this variation is permitted to appear by the Classical authorities.

The imla, , '~, is usually used to represent long j, although the diacritical point is often omitted. Final and medial forms of 4 appear to be used indiscriminately, and I and L are used indifferently to represent the long vowel 5. There are, however, many inconsistencies with regard to length, for where syllables are required to be short for the metre, and are pronounced short in normal speech, they are often written with a long vowel, and indeed there is frequent disagreement between A and B on this score.

THE ' SONG OF BAGAUDA' AND THE ISLAMIC TRADITION IN HAUSA LITERATURE There are three main traditions in Hiausa literature. Firstly, the traditional folk-literature, which includes animal tales and much of which is closely related to the spirit world of African religion and culture. Secondly, the Islamic</page><page sequence="17">THE 'SONG OF BAGAUDA': A HAUSA KING LIST AND HOMILY IN VERSE-III 379 tradition, of which the homiletic writings of the malams are an important part. Finally, the Western tradition which is associated with the emergence of a printed literature in Hausa. It is the second of these traditions which concerns us in our examination of the WB, although there are occasions, as for example the references to the hyena and the heron, when the poet's familiarity with the African tradition is apparent. Characteristic of the Islamic tradition is homily on the frailties of this world, and the perils which attend pride and arrogance. These homilies are deeply informed by the eschatology of the Qur'In, and there appears to be a conventional stock of images common to all the poets who write in this tradition. The following lines taken from other examples of the homiletic literature repeat the familiar themes of the WB. The sin of pride and arrogance is contrasted with the condign punishment of the Last Day: 33 'Thou who art puffed up with pride because of thy relations, thy kingdom, or thy property, on the day when thou meetest the angels, thou shalt be confounded'; 34 'Leave off arrogance, flee from him who practises it; Whoever practises it will not obtain salvation, hearken to this'; 35 'Repent, leave off seeking after thine own greatness; let thy greatness fear Him who is all-powerful' ; 36 'Men praise thee therefore, in order that thou mayest give them some- thing; they say of thee, This man excels all. Thou swellest up with pride, thou fool; this world deceiveth.... Wilt thou then give heed to my warning ? Fear the meeting with Him who has power over all '.37 The world is an old man who drops his load: 38 'The world, thou knowest, is old; an old man cannot carry a load without leaving much behind' ; 39 'They read (of what was to come) but refused the choice of the next world, though the world is old, and like unto an old man who drops his load '; 40 'The world is old, he who places it in front of his forehead is the wife of an ass '.41 The world deceives and causes disease: 42 'Look carefully, behold this earth, it is deceitful, it will not continue for ever. It is a house in which there is no relaxation or rest; there is no health in it, nothing but sickness' ; 43 33 A10/22 ff.; A18/3 ff. 34 C. H.

' 70 These ideas stem originally from the Qur'an. Some of the imagery used to present them is also Qur'anic, as for instance is the fine apocalyptic ranting of the line 'By their injustice they are stuffing their bellies with hell-fire '.71 Most, however, is not direct borrowing from the Qur'an, but has been drawn from the indigenous background. The metaphor of the dun ass attempting to cover the she-ass; 72 the dog and bitch; 73 the feeble attempts of an old man to carry a load; frequent references to painful and disabling diseases, all are images familiar in the daily lives of African peasant people. But the formally ascetic attitude to the world which the poet uses these images to convey is certainly not African, for the immanent world of the ancestral spirits which is central to African religious belief is far removed from the Muslim-and Christian--doctrine of eternal punishment and reward which gives rise to this asceticism. It is, however, characteristic of the Muslim mystic, and is of very early origin in Hausaland. Umaru, who is credited with the introduction of Islam by the WB, reigned, according to the chronology of the KCh. from A.D. 1410 to 1421, and the KCh. records this about him: 'The fourteenth Sarki was Umaru.

HISKETT was a malam earnest in prayer. He was a pupil of Dan Gurdamus Ibrahimu, and a friend of Abubakar. When he became Sarkin Kano his friend upbraided him, and left him and went to Bornu, where he remained eleven years. On his return to Kano finding Umaru still Sarkin Kano, he said to him: " 0 Umaru, you still like the fickle dame who has played you false, with whom better reflection refuses to be troubled. In time you will be disgusted, and get over your liking for her. Then regret will be futile even if you do regret ". He preached to him about the next world and its pains and punishments. He reviled this world and everything in it. Umaru said, " I accept your admonition ". He called together the Kanawa; and said to them : " This high estate is a trap for the erring: I wash my hands of it ". Then he resigned, and went away with his friend. He spent the rest of his life in regret for his actions while he had been Sarki '.74 It seems probable that we have here an early example of Sufist teaching, for Sufism is known to have entered Hausaland as early as the latter half of the fifteenth century, and it is unlikely that it was entirely unknown prior to its first recorded appearance. Certainly the Sufist view of life has taken hold of the imagination of Hausa Muslims, although it has remained for the most part, a literary convention rather than a practical ideal of life. THE CONFRONTATION BETWEEN ISLAM AND PAGANISM The WB demonstrates that there are three aspects of social behaviour in which the confrontation is particularly apparent. They are: the eating of food; sickness, death, and burial; worship. The observance of Muslim food prohibitions is particularly difficult for Africans, whose food customs and taboos are very different from those insisted upon by Islam, and it is probable that this is as much an obstacle to the African convert to Islam as is monogamy in the case of conversion to Christianity. Conversely, understanding of this complex and technical aspect of Islamic observance is the mark of the malam, and willingness to observe the prohibitions is crucial in defining the degree of a man's allegiance to Islam. Thus the homiletic literature is full of exhortations on this issue, and the power of the malams, who profess to give guidance on it, is great. The WB truly reflects their influence and position in Hausa society. Sickness, death, and burial present a further temptation to the Hausa Muslim. As Greenberg has pointed out, if he believes that the bori practitioners can cure him, he will, in the last resort, always consult them.75 Death and burial are so closely associated with ancestor worship and the spirit world that it will cause no surprise when indigenous customs assert themselves in the face of Islamic disapproval. It is noteworthy that the Muslim moralist raises no objection to anointing the corpse with henna and to certain other practices, 74 H. R. Palmer, 'The Kano Chronicle', Sudanese memoirs, Lagos, 1928, III, 108. 75 The influence of Islam on a Sudanese religion, New York, 1946, 68.</page><page sequence="21">THE 'SONG OF BAGAUDA': A HAUSA KING LIST AND HOMILY IN VERSE-III 383 but does emphatically condemn the shaving of the head and paring of the nails. Tremearne gives ample evidence of the association between the bori and shavings from the head, and nail parings.7" Such debris from the living, if it falls into the hands of an enemy, gives him the power to harm, while hair clippings and nail parings are ingredients in certain magical potions. Certain parts of the human corpse are used to concoct gruesome bori medicines," and no doubt these gleanings from the dead could be used for the same purpose. Tremearne notes furthermore, that the head is the most sacred part of the pagan anatomy.78 The use of millet gruel as sadaka 9 is a survival of a pagan custom of remote origins. Greenberg mentions a libation of gumba made to Kura and Inna, and notes that a similar custom prevails among the Mossi.80 The pouring off of water in which grain has been washed may also originate in a libation. The slaughter of a goat or fowl, concerning which the poet inquires hotly 'Where did they find mention of slaughtering chicken in the sunna of the Sharif of the Arabians ?' is also a pre-Islamic survival, for Greenberg notes numerous instances of the sacrifice of these creatures to the bori.81 The conflict between Islam and paganism always tends to resolve into an identification between orthodox Muslim practice and parallel custom from African religion. This is particularly noticeable in worship. Thus in the peculiarly Hausa custom of shaking hands after communal prayer it appears likely that the Muslim concept of baraka has become involved with an African notion of group sanctity after sacrifice. Similarly, it seems clear that the deputy imam who repeats the prayer of the imam in a loud voice is the Hausa bakin sarki. In these instances, and in the identification of pagan sacrifice and libation with the Muslim sadaka we are concerned no longer with a direct conflict between Islam and paganism, but with the process of synthesis out of which, as Greenberg has observed, a new cult will tend to emerge.82 THE ROLE OF THE HAUSA MALAMS The tussle between Islam and pre-existing paganism is one which has, as I have shown elsewhere, bedevilled Sudanese Islam since the days of al-Maghill.83 In his day he was concerned with the activities of a class of persons described in the texts as 'ulama' al-si'i 84-the venal malams who corrupted the sources and mixed paganism with Islam. In his discussion of the role of the Hausa malams Greenberg has this to say: 'In the subsequent 76 Tremearne, The ban of the Bori, London, 1914, 57, 129, 162. 77 The Honourable Abubakar Tafawa Balewa, O.B.E., M.H.R., Shaihu Umar, Zaria, 1955, 23.

HISKETT Mohammedanization of the people, actual contact with Moslem folk played a minor role as compared to that of a native class of learned men, known as Malams. These constituted in effect the acculturating element, passing on what they found in the literary sources at their disposal to the population at large '.85 The attribution of this role to ' a native class of learned men, known as Malams ' involves an oversimplification. It is true that Islam in Hausaland was not propagated in the main by direct contact with Arabs. It was propagated from the fifteenth to the nineteenth century by the Fulani, and it was certainly the Fulani who had command of the literary sources to which Greenberg refers. Indeed, they are recorded in the KCh. as having brought this literature into Hausaland during the fifteenth century,86 and the level of learning which they subsequently achieved has been examined elsewhere.87 There can be no doubt as to their missionary role. But they cannot properly be termed 'a native class of learned men'. They were immigrants who, according to 'Abdullah b. Muhammad, began to enter Hausaland in the mid-fifteenth century under Miisd Jukulla,88 and who continued to be at least partially peripatetic until the nineteenth century when their success in the Fulani jihd enabled them to overthrow the Habe and establish permanent dynasties. They have always maintained their ethnic apartness from the surrounding Hausa population, and this apartness has been reinforced by cultural and religious differences. A pointed indication of this is given in the WB, where the poet refers to Malam Baklo, who 'holds fast to the practice of Shehu Uban Rufa'i '.89 The word bado means 'stranger' and here it implies ' non-Hausa '. The implication is that this authority on the works of the Fodiawa is a Fulani-a high-minded stranger among the corrupt pseudo-malams of the popular cult. According to all our evidence the Fulani have not only propagated Islam, but, since embarking on their mission, have constantly challenged and sought to arrest the process of synthesis which we have discussed. The WB which, as I have argued, is a Hausa and not a Fulani source, abundantly confirms this. A distinction must therefore be drawn between these non-Hausa 'ulamd', whose scholarship is of a high order, and whose Islam is both orthodox and metropolitan, and the malams of the native tradition of accommodation. The WB makes it clear that these malams of the village, with their satchels full of cockroaches, and their apparatus of charms and fetishes, are Hausa. In fact the poet at one point uses the contemptuous term kad'o.90 Such malams are certainly not familiar with the literary sources of Islam. They are in fact the latter-day equivalents of the 'ulamS' al-sil'i who so plagued Muhammad Askia and called down the censure of al-Maghill.
