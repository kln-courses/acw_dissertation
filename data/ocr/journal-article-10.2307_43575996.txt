XII</page><page sequence="11">INTRODUCTION The archaeological project of the excavations in the City of David was initiated in 1978, on behalf of "The City of David Society - for the Excavation, Preservation and Restoration of the City of David in Jerusalem". Several factors stimulated the Society to organize proper excavations in this region: the desire to remove the mounds of earth from earlier excavations, which over the years have caused several fatal accidents in the Silwan village; arrangement for tourism at the ancient remains previously uncovered; fencing and marking of the areas under government ownership on the eastern slope of the City of David; release of part of the area for development of the road, drainage and sewage networks, on behalf of the Jerusalem Municipality in and around Silwan village. This inherently involved and called for renewed archaeological study of the City of David. The present project joins the other current archaeological efforts presently being carried out by the Institute of Archaeology of the Hebrew University in Jerusalem and the Israel Exploration Society since 1967, under the direction of B. Mazar (adjacent to the Temple Mount) and N. Avigad (in the Jewish Quarter). The City of David Society has set as a goal to excavate, preserve and restore the archaeological remains on government lands on the hill of the City of David - the earliest site of ancient Jerusalem. The Society was founded by the Institute of Archaeology of the Hebrew University in Jerusalem, the Israel Exploration Society, the Jerusalem Foundation and a group of South African sponsors, headed by Mr. Mendel Kaplan of Johannesburg - the principal initiator of the Society and of the excavations. The president of the Society is Mr. Teddy Kollek, Mayor of Jerusalem. Significant financial assistance is regularly received from the Ambassador International Cultural Foundation, and from "Yad Avi Hayishuv" (Rothschild Foundation). The Jerusalem Municipality assists in the removal of the earth which has accumulated in dumps in the City of David over the last hundred years of excavations. The archaeological project is being directed by Yigal Shiloh, of the Institute of Archaeology of the Hebrew University in Jerusalem. The permanent senior staff includes the area supervisors and technical staff as follows: Donald T. Ariel, Alon de Groot, David Tarler, Eilat Mazar, Jane Cahill, Yair Shoham and Don Glick, assisted by Tali Ziv, Yonatan Nadelman, Rafi Greenberg and students of the Institute of Archaeology of the Hebrew University in Jerusalem. Surveying and mapping were carried out by Giora Solar (1978-81), Wolf Schleicher (1981-82) and Gary Lipovitch (1982); photography, by Hanan Shafir (1978), Yitzhak Harari (1979-82), Zeev Radovan; drawing of objects, by Shifra Eisenstein and Sarah Halbreich; drawing of the bullae, by Ada Yardeni (1982); plans, by Yael Danieli (1979-80) and Ellen Lefrak (1982); pottery restoration, by Miri Cook (1978-80), Eva Osterman (1980-82) and Phyllis Amburn (1981-82); laboratory work, by the late Yigal Val (1979-82) and Orna Cohen; registration of finds, by Rivka Gonen (1978) and Dafna Boss (1979); administration, by Sari Gilon (1978-79), Yigal Val (1980), and Elimelech Ben-Meir (1981-82); organization of volunteers, by Jane Cahill. Special thanks are extended to my wife, Tamar, who helped as director of the expedition camp and in registration of the finds during all five seasons (1978-82). In preparing the material for publication, various persons have been involved: the senior expedition staff have been responsible for their respective areas and the associated pottery. The epigraphic material has been treated by Joseph Naveh, assisted by Yair Shoham. The small finds and stamped jar-handles (local and Rhodian) bones, glass and coins, by Donald T. Ariel; seals, scarabs and tridacnae, by Baruch Brandl; stone weights, by Avraham Eran; 1</page><page sequence="12">flint implements, by Steve Rosen; botanical finds, by Nili Lifschitz and Yoav Weisel; human and faunai bones, by Eitan Tchernov, Pat Smith and Liora Horwitz; metallographic analysis, by Colin Brewer; gemstones, by Ann Swersky; pollen examinations, by Aharon Horwitz; geological survey, by Dan Gil; Byzantine pottery, by Dennis Groh. During the five years, work was carried on utilizing groups of volunteers and hundreds of individual volunteers from Israel and abroad. To these volunteers, to the Mendel Kaplan group of South Africa and the Jerusalem Foundation and its director, Ruth Cheshin - the senior staff of the archaeological project in the City of David expresses its deepest gratitude. Further thanks are extended to the staff of the Institute of Archaeology of the Hebrew University in Jerusalem, and its director, J. Aviram, and to the Department of Antiquities and Museums, and its director, A. Eitan. So far, five seasons of excavations have been carried out in the City of David, since the summer of 1978. Much material has been accumulated in this period, and several brief preliminary reports have been published, making public the major findings and certain conclusions. The expedition staff, as so often occurs in such cases, is somewhat hesitant concerning the manner of publishing so much material. Like other excavators, we are divided between the wish to see a rapid publication and the need for deeper study of the numerous problems being investigated during the excavations. There would appear to be no other site in Israel quite like the City of David and the rest of Jerusalem - for its complexity and for the intensity of research over the past century and more. Despite the considerable time which has passed since the beginning of this research, the student of Jerusalem cannot ignore the results and conclusions of earlier excavators, for a large proportion of the remains they uncovered were either covered over again and are not presently available for examination, or they have simply disappeared. The lengthy list of the senior staff and the technical staff treating the variegated finds from the City of David excavations is witness to the complexity and variety of material from various periods - which must be treated in an inter- disciplinary manner. The present publication of the conclusions and major results of the five seasons of excavations represents a victory of the urge for rapid publication of the initial findings of our investigations, even if in a rather general and summary manner. The general description, though quite extensive, will be supplemented in future by detailed discussions of each topic. It can be assumed that the final publication will modify certain of the data presented here, in some of the technical details and levels appearing in the plans, and possibly even in the preliminary table of the strata. We are well aware of the fact that the professional reader will wish to know more of the facts, and see more of the pottery, plans and detailed sections - all desirable for a greater understanding of the material and for the proof of many of our interpretations. We have preferred to expose ourselves to this anticipated criticism, and to publish whatever we can at this stage; - and thus avoid a viscious circle into which some archaeological excavations have fallen, by holding off publication of the basic findings until all the material was studied to the full. In the present study, we shall thus first present the main findings in each of the several excavation areas, in the light of our conclusions and in the light of the relationship between them and the conclusions of earlier excavators in the City of David. Since this interim report is intended to present the principal findings in each area, we have described very few of the various finds in detail. According to this same principle, we have prepared and selected plans and photographs specifically for this publication. It should be noted that the expedition's notes, hundreds of photographs, plans, sections, and the finds themselves, are available to outside scholars interested in them, at the expedition's offices in the Institute of Archaeology of the Hebrew University in Jerusalem. The author is grateful to R. Grafman, who translated the English portion of this report, and to A. Pladot, who has seen the volume through the press. This report was completed on the eve of the sixth season of excavations, in May 1983, and it is correct to that date. Yigal Shiloh 2</page><page sequence="13">GENERAL DESCRIPTION The archaeological activities of the City of David Expedition are spread over the entire south-eastern hill of Jerusalem, south of the Temple Mount (Fig. 1; Pl. I).1 This spur is of elongated triangular shape, with its base on the north at the site of the excavations adjacent to the Temple Mount and its southern wall, and flanked on the east by the Kedron Valley and on the west by the Central or Tyropoeon Valley, which separates it from modern Mount Zion. The area of the City of David, including the Temple Mount area of the 10th-8th centuries BCE, is estimated at ca. 160 dunams of which about 100 dunams are associated with the Temple Mount, 49 dunams are on the spur itself and about 1 1 dunams on the eastern slopes. The settled area of the hill, not including the Temple Mount, was thus about 60 dunams in extent. With the addition of the western hill and its inclusion within the line of fortifications in the days of Hezekiah, the fortified area of the city increased by about 460 dunams.2 During the five seasons of excavations, some 2930 sq. m. have been cleared in eleven excavation areas, all on state lands (16 dunams overall; Fig. 2; Pis. 2:1, 3:1).3 Areas Al and A2 are located at the apex of the TABLE l Preliminary Scheme of Strata - City of David (1978-82) Stratum Period Date Remarks 1 Medieval and later 14th-20th centuries 2 Islamic - Ayyubid 7th- 13th centuries 3A Byzantine 6th-7th centuries 3B Byzantine 4th-6th centuries 4 Late Roman lst-4th centuries After 70 CE; few finds 5 Early Roman 1st century CE Destruction rubble - up to 70 CE 6 Early Roman 37 BCE-70 CE Mostly 1st century CE 7A Hellenistic (Hasmonean) 1st century BCE Up to 37 BCE 7B Hellenistic (Hasmonean) 2nd half of 2nd century BCE 8 Early Hellenistic 4th-2nd centuries 9 Persian 6th-4th centuries 10A Iron Age II 6th century Mainly destruction debris - to 586 BCE 10B/C Iron Age II 2nd half of 7th century - Subdivision B/C only in Area G till 586 BCE 1 1 Iron Age II 7th century Mainly mid-7th century 12 Iron Age II 8th century Mainly reign of Hezekiah 13 Iron Age II 9th century 14 Iron Age II 10th century 1 5 Iron Age I 1 2th- 1 1 th centuries 1 6 Late Bronze Age II 1 4th- 1 3th centuries 17 Middle Bronze Age II A-B 18th century 18A Middle Bronze Age II A-B 18th century 18B Middle Bronze Age II A-B 18th century 19 Early Bronze Age II 29th century (?) 20 Early Bronze Age I 3 1st century 21 Chalcolithic period 2nd half of 4th millennium 3</page><page sequence="14">^ērioē īsi.

This spot has previously been investigated by Bliss and Dickie (1894-97) and Weill (1923-24) (Fig. 3).4 Area B is located at the base of the eastern slope, close to the Kedron Valley. Area D1 continues Area B on the slope above, to its top. These two areas together form a continuous section some 45 m long from the base of the slope up to its top. On the south and west these areas are contiguous with Weill's earlier excavations (1913-14). Area D2 links Area D1 with Area E2 to the north. The main area on the eastern slope is Area E, which is divided into three sub-areas: Area E 2 is mainly a section made outside the line of fortifications and traced the bedrock on the lower half of the eastern slope. Area El is the main area of excavations here, and includes the city- wall, the structures and supporting walls between the wall and the rock scarp at the top of the slope. Area E 3 is the northern portion of Area E. Area G is the northernmost area of the present excavations, and spreads over the upper part of the slope, adjacent to the city- wall of the Second Temple period. This area links up with the excavations of Macalister and Duncan (1923-25) and Kenyon (1961-67). Area J includes the clearance of Warren's Shaft and the subterranean water installations - the Siloam Channel and Hezekiah's Tunnel, associated with the Gihon Spring. These remains have been investigated in the past by Warren (1867) and Parker (1909-11). Area H is the only excavation area beyond the confines of the City of David, and lies near the Siloam Pool, west of the Central Valley at the base of the eastern slope of Mount Zion. The findings in this area relate to earlier conclusions stemming from the excavations of Bliss and Dickie, Crowfoot and Fitzgerald (1927-28), carried out higher up the Central Valley, and those of Kenyon, to the east. The preliminary enumeration of the strata in the City of David, correct to 1982, is presented in Table l.5 Table 2 summarizes the continuity of the strata in the various excavation areas.6 Area Al (Figs. 4-5; Pis. 3:2-6:2) Area Supervisors: David Cohen and Arza Caspi (1978-79) Excavations in this area began as a salvage operation, following the digging of a wide trench for a new municipal sewer. The trench uncovered 4</page><page sequence="15">various remains of the fortifications and dam-walls, previously discovered here by Bliss and Dickie.7 During our investigations, it was found that the entire area was disturbed by Bliss and Dickie's tunnelling, branching out in several directions (PL 4:1),8 as well as by Weill's excavations9 and by a water pipeline laid here sometime prior to 1967. An area of about 100 sq. m. was cleared between the new drainage channel and the rock scarp of the City of David (Pis. 4:2-5:1). On the rock surface, a few remains of the Iron Age II were discovered (L.22 and minor wall W.17). In Square G 7, the end of the overflow channel (Channel IV), coming from the Siloam Pool, was discovered, here, it utilizes the southern end of the Siloam Channel (Channel II), the bottom of which had been deepened by 3.3 m. in order to reverse the direction of flow (PL 5:2).10 The end of Channel IV, continuing the rock-hewn tunnel, is well built in rough headers-and-stretchers masonry (W.14; see Fig. 5). From this corner, Channel IVa continues northward.11 During Second Temple times, widespread building activities took place here, connected mainly with the dam-walls of the reservoirs (Birket el-Hamra) and the fortification of the mouth of the Central Valley (Figs. 3-4; PL 5:1). These fortifications were part of the "First Wall" of Jerusalem in the Hellenistic-Roman periods (Strata 7-6) and continued in use even into the Byzantine period (Stratum 3). Our excavations touched the north-eastern corner of this fortification system and uncovered the northern leg of the "Buttress Wall" uncovered by Bliss and Dickie (W.l-2) and the parallel wall (W.ll) built some 4 m. to the north (Figs. 4-5). These thick walls were often preserved to a height of about 3 m. They made much secondary use of stones apparently taken from earlier structures of the Hellenistic period in Jerusalem. Thus, it appears to us that this building fragment belongs mainly to Stratum 6, of the 1st century CE, though it can be assumed that the basic framework of this System belongs already to Stratum 7. The area between these two massive walls (L.17, 20) was full of destruction debris from Stratum 6. L.l, north of Wall W.8, was filled with debris some 4 m. thick, from the top of the wall down to its base, on bedrock. In the light of analysis of the numerous finds within this debris, it appears that it contained over 3,500 vessels, mainly cooking-pots (ca. 2,600), 12 glass vessels, Jerusalem stoneware and 31 coins from the days of the Procurator Ambibulus (11 CE) down to the second year of the Great Revolt (67 CE). The character of the finds here, and the manner of their deposit, clearly indicate that this area had been exposed down to bedrock prior to Stratum 6, during which the refuse debris accumulated (PL 6:1). Above the destruction layers of the Second Temple period, there were traces of reorganization of this area, in the course of Stratum 2 (Figs. 4-5; PL 6:2; L.4, 8 and walls W.7, 9, 10). This activity may have commenced in part already in Stratum 3. On a stone pavement (L.4) and adjacent to it, Islamic lamps were found, along with two Ayyubid coins13 (Reg. Nos. A.80 and A. 144), indicating the use of this structure during Stratum 2, more precisely, during the 12th- 13th centuries C.E. The excavations in Area A 1 yielded a representative sampling of the pottery corpus and coins of Stratum 6, Jerusalem stoneware and a bone flute (Reg. No. A.636, from L.17), which has been published briefly elsewhere (PL 6: 3). 14 Area A2 (Fig. 6; Pis. 3:2, 7:1) Area Supervisor : Don Glick (1982) This long and narrow area stretches mainly over Squares H-I 11-15, located at the top of the southern rock scarp of the City of David, some 10 m. above the area of Birket el-Hamra {ca. 60 sq.m.). Prior to our excavations here, remains of a supporting wall or city-wall could be seen within the debris, and it was these remains which in the past had led to the suggestion that this was the ancient line of the city fortifications.15 During the 1982 season of excavations, about 20 m. of the course of wall W.25 were cleared, and it became evident that this was the battered supporting wall of the southernmost terrace of the City of David. It is preserved to a height of 2-3 m., and it displays at least three phases: (a) the earliest phase, of one or two courses of large stones laid directly on bedrock; (b)the main phase, in which most of the wall was rebuilt using smaller fieldstones; and (c)a later addition, rather poorly built. The main phase of the wall was built over a plastered channel, hewn into the rock (Square H 13-L.32); this channel is of no later date than Stratum 6 (Fig. 6) and was found filled by the destruction debris of Strata 6-5, indicating that it functioned during Second Temple times. Whereas the 5</page><page sequence="16">period of the earliest phase of the wall is not clear, it can be assumed that the main phase is later than Stratum 6, and apparently it should be ascribed to Stratum 3, of the Byzantine period. The various additions and repairs indicate its continued use in Strata 2-1, in medieval times. From the short sections made, we learn that the wall served as a support for the fill of the southernmost terrace of the City of David. Though it was anticipated, quite reasonably, that we would find the ancient line of fortifications of the Bronze and Iron Ages, nothing of these periods came to light here in our excavations, which were rather limited in scope and time. Area H (Fig. 7; PL 7:2) Area Supervisor : Dan Michaeli (1979) Excavation of this area commenced as a salvage operation, necessitated by the paving of the road descending from Mount Zion to the Kedron Valley. An area of about 100 sq.m. was cleared. The uppermost layer, Stratum 3 of the Byzantine period, was preserved only in the southern, upper half of the area, which had not been damaged by the road building. On a low rock terrace in Squares F 5-6, at the south-eastern corner of Area H, a part of a building was uncovered, with a floor and a fill (L.1045, 1051, 1053), the pottery in which ascribes it to Stratum 7, of the Hasmonean period. This structure was slightly damaged during the preparations for the foundations of the system of buildings in Stratum 6. In this stratum, four architectural elements can be discerned here: the northern building (L.1017), the eastern building (L.1030), the southern building (L.1024) and the narrow street (L.1031) passing between the other elements. On the basis of the manner of its construction on the bedrock, and the traces of thick plaster covering its walls, it can be assumed that the eastern building served as a reseroir, divided into two units. The northern building was the eastern wing of a larger structure of Stratum 6, the continuation of which was not excavated. In its floor, a large plastered cistern was found (L.1025). All four elements from Stratum 6 were found covered by the destruction debris of that stratum. In the northern building, the debris was preserved to a height of about 2 m. Within the destruction debris was pottery typical of Stratum 6, of the 1st century CE, and coins - the latest of which was of the Great Revolt (68 CE - Reg. No. H.5079). Area H was the only one of our excavation areas in which a few sherds of Stratum 4, of the Late Roman period, were found.16 During Stratum 3, very massive building activities took place here. They may have been related to the series of public buildings constructed around the Siloam church beginning in the 5th century CE17 (Fig. 7). Stratigraphically, Stratum 3 divides into two phases: 3A and 3B.18 Stratum 3B is the earlier, main building phase, during which the main structure was built and a part of which (L.1007 and two walls, W.402 and 403) was preserved to a height of about 3 m. The structure was plastered within, in a thick plaster painted red. A gray plaster covered the floor. Simple structures and various installations were built alongside this building, to the north and south. In the second phase, Stratum 3A, further simple units were built above those of Stratum 3B. Analysis of the pottery of the two phases of Stratum 3 shows it to suit and support the stratigraphie sub-division. The main building in Stratum 3B seems to have been built in the 5th century CE, and served throughout that and the following century. The second phase, Stratum 3A, is secondary in character, in comparison to the first phase, and belong to the end of the Byzantine period - the late 6th and early 7th centuries CE. With the destruction of Byzantine Jerusalem, these structures at the southern end of the Central Valley also came to an end. In Area H, no finds later than this period came to light. Area B (Fig. 8; Pis. 8:1-9:1) Area Supervisors : Yeshayahu Lander (1978), Donald T. Ariel (1982) In this area, as in Area D 1, we had first of all to clear away thousands of cubic metres of earth from the dumps left by Weill.19 It was of primary importance to locate the limits of the earlier excavations, and the spot where Weill descended to bedrock or to the base of the walls of the Hellenistic stratum. After making several stratigraphie sections through the dumps, defining their extent and depth, a part of them was cleared away by mechanical means. Squares K-N 4-5, in the upper part of Area B, were recleared down to bedrock. On the rock scarp 6</page><page sequence="17">in Squares L-N 5, the three openings 'Of the Iron Age II Siloam Channel were located, opened and cleaned for a length of 80 m. along the tunnel.20 In the lower part of Area B, in Squares L-M 6-7, two broad rock-terraces were cleared, the level of the lower one (in Square M 7) lying some 28 m. lower than the top of the eastern slope in Area D 1 (Pl. 8:1). This is the lowest spot in the City of David excavations, and the closest to the bed of the Kedron Valley. On the middle terrace, alongside the rock scarp in which the Siloam Channel is hewn, an elongated rectangular structure was found (L.130), measuring 3 X 8.5 m., with its floor paved with flagstones (Pis. 9:1-2). This structure is located outside the line of the city- wall; the Strata 12-1 1 (?) pottery points to its belonging towards the end of the Iron Age. Its eastern wall (W.52) was built on the rock scarp descending to the level of the lower terrace. On this terrace, a plastered water channel was uncovered, hewn into the bedrock (L.133). It was in use during Strata 7(?)-6, in the Second Temple period, and went out of use with the destruction of Stratum 6. The entire slope here in Area B was covered with the collapsed debris of Stratum 5, 21 the contents of which are no later than 70 CE. The round tower (W.52, excavated by Weill),22 was again exposed, though no additional data concerning its ascription to the Hellenistic- Roman period could be gleaned. At the edge of Square M 7, beyond the eastern wall of the Israelite structure (W.63), several layers of fill which had accumulated along the scarp were excavated. Below the sparse occupational level of Stratum 14 (10th century BCE), near bedrock, layers of fill came to light containing mixed pottery of Strata 21-20. A similar mix of Chalcolithic and Early Bronze Age sherds was also found in the fill of the rock-hewn pits in Area El.23 In this area, one locus (L.136) was discovered containing sherds of Stratum 21, solely of the Chalcolithic period. Area D 1 (Fig. 9; Pis. 8:1,9:2-12:1) Area Supervisors : Hannah Frankenberg (1978), Neta Savir (1979), Donald T. Ariel (1980-82) Area D1 divides topographically into two areas: (l)the upper part (Squares D-G 3-4), on a rock surface at the top of the eastern slope, most of which was excavated previously by Weill (PI. 15));24 and (2) the area some 10 m. lower down, the main part of Area Dl. The latter was excavated by the City of David Expedition after Weill's dumps were cleared away (Squares B-G 7-8). It lay outside the walled area of Second Temple times, and apparently of the Bronze and Iron Ages as well. A total area of about 500 sq.m. was thus excavated or cleared in Area Dl (Pis. 9:2, 11:1). In a relatively restricted area, alongside the rock scarp in Square B 7 (L.433), several layers were found containing Stratum 15 pottery, of the 12th- 1 1th centuries BCE. Above these layers was a further layer containing large quantities of animal bones and Stratum 14 pottery, of the 10th century BCE (PI. 11:2). In Stratum 12, a change took place in the occupational panorama of Area Dl. Throughout the squares of the lower area here (D-G 8), small rooms and small structures were found, built directly on bedrock. Some of the walls served to support the shallow fill used to level the sloping bedrock. On the basis of the quality of construction, these walls appear not to have been of great height. In several instances, secondary additions to the main plan could be discerned, indicating primary and secondary phases. These structures seem to have been abandoned at the end of Stratum 12, and the pottery shows that they had remained in use only during the 8th century BCE.25 Only in one spot (Square B-C 7, L.468) was a better built structure found, and containing finer quality pottery; it, too, was destroyed and abandoned at the end of Stratum 12 (Pis. 10:1, 11:1). At the edge of the upper terrace (Square E 5), in a large rock-hewn pit (L.317), a rich, large group of broken vessels came to light, showing the refuse pit to have continued in use mainly during Stratum 12 and somewhat in Stratum 1 1 (PI. 1 1 :2).26 In Stratum 9 (Persian period), many parts of the slope were covered, mainly those close to bedrock, by layers of chalky gravel - refuse frorti a quarry (Pis. 10:2-1 1 : 1). Though these layers were disturbed in several spots by debris from Strata 8-7, some of them could be defined, as far as pottery and stratigraphy were concerned, as belonging to Stratum 9, and they could be compared with the similar layers of gravel of that stratum in Area D2.27 This gravel dump apparently came into existence through the activities of a quarry which occupied most of the upper rock terrace in Area Dl, and which was cleared by Weill28 (Fig. 9; PI. 11:2). The 7</page><page sequence="18">fact that some of the traces of this quarry were found beneath the foundations of the Strata 7-6 city-wall (W. 15 1-152) fits in with the dating of the gravel, on the one hand, and shows, on the other hand, that at least part of the quarry was in use prior to the Hellenistic period, apparently in Persian times. This conclusion is in contrast to Weill's and Kenyon's ascription of the entire quarry to' the Late Roman and Byzantine periods.29 A radical change in the topography of the eastern slope came about in Areas D and E, east of the line of the fortifications, during the course of Stratum 7 (Fig. 10; Pis. 8:1, 9:2). On the rock scarp at the top of the eastern slope, a new city-wall (W.151-152) was built, serving both Strata 7 and 6 (Pl. 1 1 :2). On the slope below, a network of massive supporting walls was built, resting upon fills up to several metres thick (Pis. 9:2-10:1). These latter walls (e.g. W.163 and 168) formed terraces each about 5-8 m. wide. The entire terraced area was enclosed in the south by wall W.157 (Weill's wall B),30 which ran from the city- wall (W.152) down the slope, for a length of about 27 m. The difference in height, within Stratum 7, between the surface north of wall W.157 and the surface south of it is some 5 m. The series of supporting walls and terraces survived also into Stratum 6, going out of use only with the destruction of the city at the end of that stratum. The line of the city-wall was again cleared at the top of Area Dl, in Squares C-G 3-4 (walls W.151, 152, 153; Fig. 9; Pis. 8:1, 9:2, 11:2). The wall, here built of two stout, tangent walls, is about 3.5 m. thick and rises to about 3 m. in height; the exposed part is about 18 m. long. It is founded directly upon bedrock and on the remains of the quarry of Stratum 9. The fact that the face of the inner wall (W.15 1) has not survived - it resembles the inner surface of a terrace wall - would indicate that it, too, had an earth fill on its inner side (which was removed down to bedrock by Weill). At the northern end of this wall segment (Square G 4), the outer wall apparently forms a corner turning westward (W.15 3). After clearing the northern end of this segment (L.314), there appeared a sort of opening blocked by large stones, between walls W.161 and W.151 (PL 12:1). Upon removal of these stones, a series of stepped courses of stone was exposed. This might be a narrow (1.5 m.) postern in the city-wall, with a stairway in it leading up to the assumed occupation level of the area within the wall in Strata 7-6. During removal of the blockage, little pottery, of Stratum 6, was found. If this was indeed an intentional blocking of the opening, it was surely done at the end of the stratum, on the eve of its destruction. It is logical to assume that this part of the wall represents a segment of the "First Wall" at the top of the eastern slope of the City of David (see Fig. 3). We thus ascribe the building of this wall to Stratum 7B, and its continued use to Stratum 6 up to the destruction of the city at the end of that stratum, in 70 CE.31 As in Areas B, D2 and E, in Area Dl, too, there are clear signs of the destruction of Stratum 6, in the continuous rubble of the supporting walls which collapsed down the slope. During the time after the destruction, various remains from the destruction layer were carried down the slope. This debris covered the surface of the slope in layers containing a mixture of much gravel, pottery, stoneware, glass, fragments of clay installations and coins from Strata 7-6. There was nothing in all these debris layers dating from later than the 1st century CE - more precisely, from later than 70 CE. This tumbled debris has been distinguished by us as a separate stratum - Stratum 5. This layer - often reaching a thickness of 5 m. and more - was a constant stratigraphie feature in most of the areas on the eastern slope, covering and sealing the tops of the supporting walls and building debris of Strata 7-6. Over this debris we found debris of the last few centuries - supplemented in Area D 1 by the dumps tipped from Weill's excavations (1913-14). Area D2 (Fig. 11; Pis. 12:2-13:2) Area Supervisor : Yair Shoham (1983) The excavations in Area D2 commenced in the 1982 season, the areas to the north (Area E2) and south (Area Dl) having previously been excavated. During this season about 150 sq.m. here were cleared. In its stratigraphy, this area resembles Area Dl. The network of supporting walls in Stratum 7, described above (Area Dl), continues in Area D2 as well, forming a similar pattern of three Hellenistic terraces. Only at the northern end do the fills diminish and sparse remains of Stratum 7 begin to appear, built on bedrock, which was still exposed in that period, as in Area E2. Work in the 1982 season in Area D2 concentrated on the upper terrace (Squares G-L 5-6). Immediately above bedrock, a 6 m. segment of 8</page><page sequence="19">wall W.806 was found, continuing the line of the Stratum 12 city-wall. It was well built and preserved to a height of about 1.5 m. Its inner face is located beyond the western limits of the excavated area. The outer face of the wall, in Squares I-J 5-6, abuts L.1839, mainly comprising a small stone and pebble pavement levelling off the rock surface and forming a sort of paved space, defined on the east by wall W.807, running parallel to the city-wall. This space is ca. 2.2 m. wide and so far about 6 m. of its length have been uncovered. The pottery from L.1839 would ascribe it to Strata 12-10(?). The function of this space will be examined in the summer of 1983. 32 In Squares G-I 5, as in Area Dl,33 thick layers of white gravel from a quarry were found, most of the associated pottery belonging to Stratum 9. During the deposit of this gravel, inner supporting wall W.804 was built, preserved to a height of about 1.5 m. and uncovered for a length of some 10 m. (Fig. 11). The gravel debris was deposited on the base of the wall and on the inner and outer faces (PL 13:1). The stratigraphie relationship of these elements, above the debris and the walls of Stratum 10, and beneath the fill and the supporting walls of Strata 8-7 - as well as the associated pottery - ascribe them to Stratum 9, of the Persian period. In Stratum 7B, of the Hasmonean period, a new series of walls was built in Area D2, integrating (as noted) with the similar series found in Areas D 1 and E (Figs. 10-11; Pis. 13:1-12:2). We also founçl the continuation of Hellenistic terrace wall W.201, built to a width of ca. 1.20 m. on the eastern edge of the Israelite city-wall. It continues southward for a length of ca . 18 m. till Square J 5, where it meets with wall W.801, which turns westward. The eastern edge of the upper terrace was formed by supporting wall W.163; its outer face was uncovered in Area D2 for a length of ca. 25 m. Wall W.163, like the other supporting walls of Stratum 7B, had only an outer face and abutted the fill of Stratum 7B (L.1802, 1810, 1811). Wall W.163 was built east of the line of the Israelite city- wall and wall W.201 above it, and served to enclose the fill between it and wall W.201. Over this fill, a stairway (L.1807) was built, ca. 1.70 m. wide (PI. 13:2), leading up from north to south toward a built opening through which it was possiblè to turn and continue westward (L.1814) alongside wall W.801. This stairway was part of a construction which could have served in one of two manners: (l)as part of a route connecting the two terraces; or (2) as part of a route ascending southward, reaching the blocked postern (L.314) in Area Dl, in the Strata 7-6 city- wall (Fig. 9).34 With the abandonment of the series of terraces and the stairway, at the end of Stratum 6, the walls were gradually destroyed and the entire area became covered by Stratum 5 debris tumbling down from above. Area E2 (Figs. 12 and 15; Pis. 14:1-15:2) Area Supervisors : Alon de Groot (1978-79), Yair Shoham (1980-82) Area E2 includes the series of Squares G-L 4, 1-K 5-7 and I 8-9, in the southern part of Area E. The excavations, and accordingly, our present discussion, divides into two parts: (1) the two rock terraces in the section east of the city-wall; and (2) the area within the city-wall (Squares H-L 4). In Area E2, a total of ca. 375 sq.m. was excavated. 1. The Section Outside the City-Wall. In excavating this section, ca. 28 m. long and of varying width, from 2 m. to 15 m., it was our intention to gather data on the profile of the slope and of the natural rock surface outside the fortified area, and on the archaeological remains overlying it. It was considered important to determine whether there were further defensive lines lower down the slope, below the line of the city-wall uncovered above. This investigation revealed that, as in Areas B and D, here, too, there were no further fortifications (Pis. 14:2-15:1). The rock surface descends here in two steep terraces, the first about 6 m. from the base of the city-wall, and the second a further 9 m., till the spot where our 1980 excavations broke off. On the bedrock above the upper terrace (Squares I-K 5-7), a number of natural pits were found which had filled in during Strata 21-20 (L.549, 555, 561, 564, 599, 600, 604, 605, 612). These pits resemble - in their character and in the pottery which had accumulated in them - the pits found to the north, in Area El (PI. 15: l).35 During the Iron Age II, the rock surface on the upper terrace was exposed. In contrast, in the narrow section on the lower terrace (Squares H-I 8-9), a series of walls, fills and floors of Stratum 12 came to light (PI. 14:2). Like the series found in Area D 1, the 9</page><page sequence="20">structures here represent dwellings and other buildings constructed outside the fortified city of this period, and abandoned toward the end of the 8th century BCE. After Stratum 12, this lower terrace was never again utilized, and it was covered by debris in Strata 8-5. The bedrock on the upper terrace remained exposed till Stratum 7, when walls for a shallow terrace were built on it, along with stretches of pavement (walls W.200, 205, 430, 436). In the squares adjacent to the city- wall, Squares H-K 5, much stone debris was found, originating in the collapse of supporting wall W.201, which was built over the city-wall (W.219) and served in Strata 7-6.36 This debris was formed with the destruction of Stratum 6, and was covered over by tumbled debris and gravel from Strata 5, the latter debris occasionally reaching 3-4 m. in thickness (PI. 15:2). 2. The Area Within the City-Wall . The limit of this sub-area on the east is the line of the Iron Age fortifications (W.219) and the Hellenistic supporting wall (W.201), the construction of which atop the city-wall caused a clear stratigraphie disturbance of the series of earlier strata in these squares (H-L 4). During Stratum 12, in the area south of Area El (walls W.229-236), a large structure was built, the eastern parts of which rested upon the inner fill of the city-wall (PI. 16:1). The enclosing wall of this series of rooms on the east was wall W.215, an especially thick wall (i ca . 1.50 m.) traced for a length of ca. 12 m. till a corner formed with wall W.714, the southern wall of the series. A number of internal walls (e.g. W.209-211, 214, 242, 703-704), fills and pavements also belong to this phase. On the northern side of this complex, a series of steps was uncovered, ascending to L.1325 from the lower level overlying the city-wall within wall W.215. This series of rooms, walls and floors served with minor modifications during Strata 12-10. The main change occurred - Stratum 10, on the eve of its destruction, when part of the walls no longer existed and the stairway was blocked by wall W.228. The principal unit uncovered within this complex in which we can see the repeated use of three monoliths, preserved its general outline, with the floor levels rising in the three strata (Squares K-L 4, L. 1 706 - Figs. 12, 15). With the destruction of the series of terraces and structures on the eastern slope, at the end of Stratum 10, this part of Area E2 was also covered over by the destruction debris, part of which accumulated over the ruins on the slope in the phase soon after the destruction, and have thus been defined as Stratum 10A. During Stratum 7B, wall W.201 was built over the eastern edge of the city-wall, running the length of the slope from Area E3 to Area E2 (Fig. 10).37 It is ca. 1.00-1.50 m. thick and built as a supporting wall in a rather loose manner (often tending to fall apart upon clearance). This wall abutted the layers of fill on its inner face; the fill contained pottery associated mainly with Stratum 7 (L.1731 and 679). Here, too, the wall remained in use during Stratum 6, and several repairs may have been made to it in that stratum. The entire area, including wall W.201, was covered over by Stratum 5 debris (PI. 15:2). Area E3 (Fig. 13; Pis. 16:1-17:1) Area Supervisors: M. Flitman (1980), Eilat Mazar (1981-82) In this area, located at the northern part of Area E, so far some 110 sq.m. have been excavated (Squares U 4 and V-W 4-5). The surface was especially steep, impeding work until the upper debris had been removed. At several spots there were natural clefts in the rock, found to contain Strata 21-20 sherds and mixed pottery of Strata 18-16. Most of the Iron Age II finds were structures of Strata 12-10, linking up with the series of structures extensively uncovered in Area El.38 This complex was built in Area E3 partly on the bedrock, between the city-wall on the east and the rising rock scarp at the top of the slope. The surface had been levelled and fills beneath the floors were supported by the walls of the buildings themselves.39 Three main structural units were discerned, described below from north to south: The northern one (Squares W 4-5); the "columbarium" (V-W 4); and the southern one (Square U 4; Pl. 16:1). The northern structure was badly damaged by the supporting walls of Strata 7-6, the foundations of which penetrated into it (PI. 31). Even so, it can be delimited by means of walls W.497 and 862-863; its beginning can definitely be ascribed to Stratum 12, on the basis of a pottery group found in locus L.1901 (Square W 5). Adjacent to it, in narrow cell L.1912 (0.80 X 1.00 m.), there was a stone installation apparently used as a toilet. This installation is 10</page><page sequence="21">identical in most details with one in locus L.789, in Area G (PL 16:2).40 In the southern unit, only the northern edge of a large structure has been cleared. Walls W.494 and 859 are about 1.00 m. thick, with doorposts built of small ashlars (W.493), indicative of the finer character of this building, which was apparently used in Strata 12-10. The building denoted a "columbarium" (L.1558; walls W.484-485 and 487) was constructed later than the original building phase of the other structures, in Stratum 12 - i.e. no earlier, apparently, than Stratum 10. The stratigraphie position of the walls of this building, in relation to the later walls above them (Strata 7-6) shows that the structure belongs to the end of the Iron Age II. On the inner side of walls W.484-485, six rows of narrow niches (25 X 25 cm.) were discovered, reminiscent in form, and possibly also in use, of the niched "columbaria" found scattered throughout Hellenistic Judea (Pl. 17:1). In Area E3, it was possible to discern the total destruction of these structures, at the end of Stratum 10. Some of their walls served as the base or lower part of the supporting walls built the length of the eastern slope during Stratum 7B. Especially noted was the wall of the main terrace on the western edge of Area E3, uncovered for a length of some 17 m. (W.481 + 483 + 488; Pis. 16:1, 17:2). It is preserved to a height of 2-3 m. and its inner side abuts the contemporaneous fill. This fill also covered most of the area of the slope before the wall, occasionally supported by thinner walls (e.g. W.401 in Square U 4). In Area E3, a well-built corner of the Stratum 6 supporting walls was discovered (PI. 16:1). Wall W.472 was preserved for a length of 10 m. and to a height of 3-4 m. Wall W.471 was preserved to a similar height and, together with W.472, formed a massive corner. These walls supported and abutted the levelled fill, the associated pottery of which shows that the walls were built in Stratum 6, prior to the destruction of 70 CE. Two other small walls, W.473 and W.480, as well as their associated fills, are also of Stratum 6. These elements of the 1st century CE are unique to Area E3, and they too were covered over by the tumbled debris of Stratum 5, as on the entire eastern slope. Area El (Figs. 14-15; Pis. 17:2-25:1) Area Supervisors : Alon de Groot (1978-82), assisted by Tali Ziv and Rafi Greenberg Area El has been worked extensively and continuously since the first season of excavations; so far some 675 sq.m. have been cleared, mostly down to bedrock.41 After the 1979 season, Area E was divided into three units (El, E2 and E3). Area El covers Squares M 20, M-P 1-2 and L-R 3-6. In order to reach the ancient levels, it was first necessary to remove thousands of cubic metres of modern refuse and debris which had accumulated on the slope since 70 CE (Pis. 18:1-2). The rock scarp at the top of the slope (Square M 20), the western limit of Area El, is about 32 m. higher than the base of the slope. Some 30 m. out from the scarp, mid-way down the slope, runs the outer line of the fortifications. The difference in height between the top of the rock surface, at the base of the upper scarp, and the base of the city-wall is about 1 1 m. In the 1978 season, a large area outside the wall was excavated, revealing rock-hewn steps steeply descending a further 4 m. down to the limit of the excavated area, in Square N 6. Area El is divided into the following sub-areas: the area east of and outside the city-wall (Squares L-P 6); the main, stepped area to the west, within the fortifications; and the upper Sectional trench which reaches the upper scarp (Squares M 1-2, 20; Pl. 17:2). Strata 21-20 : So far, most of the evidence for the earliest occupation in the City of David has been found in Area El. Numerous sherds, found with brown terra rosa soil, percolated into numerous clefts and karst pits in the bedrock, within and beyond the line of fortifications. A few of the sherds are from Stratum 21, but almost all are from Stratum 20, and a few examples might even be ascribed to Stratum 19. It can be assumed that the rock pits became filled and sealed already in this early phase of settlement. In Square R 5, remains of a rectangular structure (L.1693, walls W.646 and 648-649, and adjacent bench W.647; see Fig. 14; PI. 19:2) came to light in the 1982 season. This structure was built directly on bedrock and its eastern end extends beneath the Stratum 18 city- wall. A similar situation came to 11</page><page sequence="22">light in Squares N-O 4-5 (L.1400), which included fill with sherds and also extended beneath the Stratum 18 city- wall there. Even though a decided majority of the pottery in L.1693 is of Stratum 20 (Early Bronze Age I), the final date of this structure can be determined only with the continuation of excavations, because of the general paucity of pottery finds here - those found being mainly of bowls and burnished trays, which could also be ascribed to Stratum 19 - of the Early Bronze Age II. Strata 18-17 (Fig. 14): The excavators were surprised here by the discovery of Middle Bronze Age II remains, in Strata 18-17. During the first season, it appeared as if the building activities of the Iron Age II, directly on bedrock, had obliterated all earlier remains. It now appeared that in several depressions in the rock remains of earlier strata survived. Most of these finds were concentrated in Squares N-R 4-5, within the fortifications line. Already during the clearance of the outer face of the city-wall, during the 1980 season, we discerned that the northern segment of the wall in Area El was built with especially large cyclopean stones - in contrast to the rest of the wall to the south (PI. 20: 1). During the 1981-82 seasons, special efforts were made to examine those squares within the city-wall, in order to obtain the maximum of information on the stratigraphie relationship between Strata 18-17 and the base of the city- wall (PI. 20:2). There was found to exist here a bi- or tri-strata series, 18A-B-17, relating to the early line of city fortifications. Of the earliest phase, Stratum 18 B, a stretch of some 20 m. of the wall was uncovered, some 3 m. thick (L.1390, walls W.605, 611, 613), and their accompanying fills, belong to this phase. In the second phase, stratum 18 A, the series of fills continues to abut the wall, which was thickened in one part (Squares P-Q 5) by the addition of W.285, a sort of narrow buttress added to the inner face, resting on fill and on the edges of the walls of Stratum 18B. A floor bearing several storejars (L.1631) also belonged to this phase (Pis. 20:3-21:1). In Stratum 17, wall W.629 was built, its foundations penetrating and damaging the two earlier phases, Strata 18A and B. In Square O 5, thin supporting wall W.286 - supporting a further fill - was constructed in Stratum 18 A. A few remains from Strata 18-17 were discovered in Square M 20, in the upper sectional trench, and in a narrow niche within the rock scarp in Square M 2. Study of the pottery from the floor of the structures and the fills is still under way, and only where it is completed will it be possible to date Strata 18-17 precisely. Already, we may note that the pottery here is very similar in all three phases. The corpora include pottery types from the end of the Middle Bronze Age IIA and the beginning of the Middle Bronze Age IIB. Thus, we may suggest that construction of the wall and the adjacent series of structures in Area El can be dated around 1800 BCE; the date of Strata 18-17 should, for the time being, be placed in the 18th century BCE.42 Strata 16-14 : In the upper sectional trench (Square M 20), a sparse layer of earth and small stones was uncovered in Stratum 16. Two poor phases, comprising thin walls and floor levels bearing sherds from Strata 15-14, were revealed in nearby Square M 1 (Pl. 23:1). Similar layers in Stratum 14, of the 10th century BCE, were found in Square P 3, with several clay installations, bricks and small stones, built in a broad depression in the rock. These latter contained two complete chalices (Reg. Nos. El. 10193 and El. 10194; PI. 21:2), and the lower half of a cultic stand (Reg. No. El. 14386). Though among the pottery vessels there were types which could be ascribed to Stratum 15, the sparse structures there have been ascribed, on the basis of the latest types, to Stratum 14. Stratum 12 (Fig. 15; Pis. 17:2, 19:1): The main series of Iron Age II remains preserved and revealed in Area El is ascribed to Strata 12-10. The building complexes of these strata are founded, in most cases, directly on the bedrock, damaging the earlier remains below. In contrast, the rubble of the structures of Stratum 10, of the end of the Iron Age II, remained in situ . These structures yielded significant data on the new urban arrangement in the city in the 8th-6th centuries BCE. Because of the steepness of the rocky slope between the city-wall and the upper rock scarp at the top of the slope, this area was divided into four structural terraces, held in place by supporting walls. The city -wall (W.219) in Stratum 12 underwent a process of renovation and thickening. At its core was the solid construction of the Middle Bronze Age II city-wall (Strata 18-17). In Squares L-N 5, it can be seen that in Stratum 12 the wall was especially thickened, to a total of about 5 m., and it is preserved to a height of some 2-3 m. It should be remembered 12</page><page sequence="23">that the wall itself was built here intentionally at the top of the rock scarp, which drops steeply down the slope (PI. 18:2). The wall, like the other supporting walls, had only an outer face. The inner part was a dense fill of stones, varying in thickness in accord with the rock surface. The walls of the buildings adjacent to the city-wall form a back to it and are integrated with the inner fill, or are built over it, thus dating the construction of this phase of the Stratum 12 city-wall (PI. 22:1). This shows that the city-wall served as a line of defence and as a principal supporting belt for the series of constructed terraces and for the buildings abutting it.43 On the slope above the wall, along Squares M 1-5, 20, four or so more built terraces of Stratum 12 can be discerned, each supported by walls which also served as the backs of the various buildings there (e.g. walls W.233, 238, 240, 270, 612; PL 19:1). This building activity would have necessitated closely coordinated public planning concerning the construction of this quarter and others elements in it, such as drainage channels and stepped alleyways, to connect the buildings. Such a stepped alley was found in Squares L 3-4 (L.1325), as described above (Area E2). A well-built drainage channel (L.618) was uncovered for a length of some 11m. in Squares N 3-5 (PI. 17:2). The base of the channel rested on the natural rock surface, and it continued in a well- built line as a channel covered with flagstones, even through the city-wall. At its lower end, within the fill of the wall, the floor of the channel was lined with limestone slabs, hewn in a U-shape. The walls of the channel, preserved to a height of 1-2 m., were covered with a white plaster. In accord with its stratigraphie relationship with the buildings around it, its beginning can be ascribed to Stratum 12. It went out of use in Stratum 10. In Area El there are six building complexes (Fig. 15). the principal structure, the "Ashlar House" (L.1269), served from Stratum 11 and will be discussed below. Two complexes are located north of the drainage channel. One structure (L.1322) abuts the northern wall of the channel, wall W.250 and the city-wall. The walls of the second complex spread over an extensive area in Squares P-R 3-4 (L.1604), and it can be assumed that wall W.625 was the eastern limit of the structure, most of those walls were preserved beneath the Hellenistic supporting wall at the western edge of the excavations (walls W.601, 617-619, 622). The thickness of the walls, and their preserved height on this side, are indicative of the massive character of the building. Between walls W.617-618 there is a fill which contained fragments of some 58 ceramic fertility and anthropomorphic figurines. The building had suffered from stone robbers and considerable erosion, damaging most of its eastern part. The most complete structure of Stratum 12, the "Lower Terrace House", was excavated in Area El - L.1275 (8 X 8 m.), in Squares L-M 3-4 (Pis. 17:2, 22:1). The Hebrew designation for this building, the "MHMM House", is based on the name that appeared on a Hebrew inscription incised on a storejar (Reg. No. E1.5973) from L.631 in Stratum 1 1. The building has three parallel spaces on its north-south axis, each built on a successively higher level, following the rise of the bedrock. The eastern edge of the structure (walls W.230, 232, 268) abuts on the inner face of the city- wall (W.219) and is integrated with it. It can be assumed that from the south-eastern corner of the building, west of wall W.268, it had been possible to turn toward the flat top of the city- wall and enter the eastern space of the house, L.1241, or to ascend the steps, L.1325, and enter the central space, L.1334, or the western space, L.665, some 3 m. higher.44 The "Lower Terrace House" is one of the most important units on the eastern slope for the understanding of the relative stratigraphy of Strata 12-10. This building, with minor changes, served three strata, with clear evidence of raising the floor level in each phase. In room L.1275 there was a difference in height between the floor of the earliest phase and that of the uppermost phase, of about 1.5 m. These floors were relatively rich in complete pottery objects, presenting a variegated pottery sample for the phases in the 8th-6th centuries BCE. Our division accords with the other parts in Area E and the other areas in the City of David where these strata are represented (Areas B, D1 and G; PL 22 :2).45 In the upper sectional trench, parts of two other buildings were excavated, spreading over two terraces: L.1292 in Square M 2, and the higher unit, L.1608, in square M 1 (Fig. 15). Stratum 11 : This stratum - though well defined in several instances, mainly stratigraphically, between Stratum 12, the stratum of the construction of the buildings, and Stratum 10, the destruction stratum of these buildings - like many intermediate strata, was represented by relatively sparse finds, architectural 13</page><page sequence="24">or ceramic. In the "Lower Terrace House", clear changes took place in this stratum, but they were secondary in importance. Several interior walls went out of use and in the two lower spaces, the floors were raised considerably.46 In L.1275 there was a difference of about 94 cm. between the Stratum 12 floor and that of Stratum 11. The major change in Area El is connected with the construction of a new unit, building L.1269, denoted the "Ashlar House", in Squares N-P 1-2, 20 (Pis. 17:1-2, 23:1-2). The building spread over the two upper terraces, from the rock scarp on the west to wall W.608, which is mostly covered by the terrace wall of Stratum 7. This building is of impressive dimensions (12 X 13 m.); its walls are built of especially large stones, some roughly dressed, found in the upper debris on the terrace below, in Squares N-O 3. The walls are about 80 cm. thick and the floors are of well-tamped crushed limestone, a typical feature of ashlar construction.47 The strong construction here could be seen in the preservation of the walls to a considerable height, up to some 3 m. (W.235). The plan of the building, the quality of its construction - much finer than that of the other structures in Area El - its topographical situation, raised above its surroundings to the east and south - all would seem to indicate that this was some public building. On the basis of its plan, it could be assumed that it is of the "Four-room house" type, which served for dwellings and public buildings in this period.48 The floor of the eastern space (L.1300) was lower by about 2.8 m. than the floor levels in the central space (L.1269) and in the hind space (L.1320), and apparently served as a lower storey or basement to the structure above (PL 23:2). This building was totally destroyed at the end of Stratum 10. The buildings of Stratum 12 in Squares M 1-2, 20, went out of use in this stratum, and the area to the south of wall W.235 was levelled off by means of fills supported by walls W.612 and 270 (?) Stratum 10 , the clear-cut destruction level - the total destruction of the series of buildings in Area El - was accompanied by traces of fire and destruction. In the "Lower Terrace House" (L.1275), a series of floors, of Stratum 10, was discerned. Wall W.233, of Strata 12-1 1, was now covered over by a beaten clay floor stretching between W.238 and W.268, backing on the city-wall. This floor is about 57 cm. higher than that of Stratum 1 1 (Fig. 15). In the "Ashlar House", the changes were more limited, but the picture of destruction was more complete. In the back space (L.1320), the floor was raised by 24 cm. above that of Stratum 1 1. The area of the upper sectional trench to the south of the building (Squares M 1-2) continued to be open. Supporting walls W.270(?) and W.612 still separated the two terraces. On the upper rock scarp, a natural cave was utilized (L.1201), and the remains of a tabun ("oven") of this period have been found there. Up to this phase the cave was fairly high above the surface to the east, and thus it was not utilized. The destruction of Stratum 10 was, as noted, quite clear everywhere. Floors with concentrations of pottery typical of the end of this stratum were found, e.g., in L.1275 and L.1300 (PL 24:1). When this quarter was destroyed, and the supporting walls were no longer maintained, the above noted structures collapsed and were covered entirely by the debris. The larger the building, the more impressive the debris, e.g. the debris of rough ashlars from the "Ashlar House" (L.1269) and the debris in the area of the "Lower Terrace House" (L.665, 1275). A similar fate befell the city-wall for its entire length, but since its eastern edge was utilized as a base for supporting wall W.201 in Stratum 7, it was better preserved. The debris which accumulated in this area after the destruction of the principal phase of Stratum 10 was defined as the final phase of the Iron Age II, Stratum 10A.49 In many cases this phase was disturbed by the robbing of stones by the builders of the Strata 7-6 supporting walls. Erosion often also affected Stratum 10A, leading to the penetration of pottery from Strata 9-6. Stratum 9: After the destruction of Area El at the end of Stratum 10, the entire slope was covered by debris and dumps. At the edge of the upper rock scarp, and nearby, in the relatively limited area at the top of the upper sectional trench (Square M 20), there were dumps of earth and layers of white gravel from Stratum 9Š A thin supporting wall (W.237), built parallel to the rock scarp, also belongs to this stratum. Strata 8-6 (Fig. 10): The remains of the Hellenistic period, Strata 8-7, are divided into three units: the area outside the line of the Israelite city-wall; the supporting walls within the line of the walls; and Square M 20 at the top of the upper sectional trench. Square M 20 is the only spot in the City of David in 14</page><page sequence="25">which a full section of all the strata are preserved, from Stratum 18 to Stratum 1 (PI. 24:2). Above Stratum 9, there were found here two building phases of the Hellenistic period. To Stratum 8 we can ascribe a structure abutting the rock scarp in this square. The structure was destroyed by a conflagration, and on its floors we found a rich corpus of pottery dating from the beginning of the Hellenistic period, the 3rd century BCE. This corpus is, so far, the only one from the City of David found in situ , and it represents this early phase in the history of the Hellenistic, pre-Hasmonean city. The building's eastern continuation had tumbled down the slope. The even more fragmentary second building phase belongs to Stratum 7. The debris of Stratum 5 here too sealed the surface of the slope after 70 CE (Pl. 24:2). In the course of Stratum 7B, the principal area between the upper rock scarp and the old line of Iron Age fortifications saw the construction of two main supporting walls, comprising W.201, 606 and 241 + 261, the continuation of which is located in Areas D2 and E3 (Figs. 10-13). Part of the main framework walls of Strata 12-10 showed through amongst the heaps of rubble, and in Stratum 7B they were again utilized as foundations for the new supporting walls. The upper terrace wall was built in segments, often utilizing earlier fragments (e.g. W.608). They are typical supporting walls, lacking an inner face and abutting the layers of fill of Stratum 7B, and even those of the earlier Stratum 8 (PL 20:1). An especial- ly interesting find from this layer is a fragment of an ivory plaque (Reg. No. E.3814), ornamented in relief with a depiction of Zeus in the image of an eagle carrying Ganymede aloft (PL 25 :1).50 In many cases we found, alongside the walls in the layers of fill, pottery vessels in better condition, from Stratum 7, like those from Squares N-P 2-3. Wall W.201 was built atop the city -wall (W.219). In contrast to the other supporting walls of Stratum 7B, this wall has an inner face; it was about 1.40 m. thick and was preserved, in Area El, for a length of about 20 m. and to a height of ca. 1.30 m. Despite its dimensions and location atop the old city-wall, it was of poor quality construction. Wall W.201 had a double function - supporting and stabilizing the part of the slope above it, and preventing debris and erosion from tumbling down and damaging the open area on the natural rock surface outside the city-wall, an area utilized in this period as well (Pis. 14:1, 18:2). This open area was examined in Area E2, as well as in several squares along the outer face of the city- wall in Area El (L-R 5-6). It turned out that the rock surface was exposed in part till Stratum 7B, during which several walls and other installations were constructed there, utilizing the surface and the steep scarp for various purposes (walls W.205-206). Only in the course of Stratum 7 did the rock surface begin to be covered with the fills of Strata 7B and 7A and, above them, in several spots, with more fills of Stratum 6 (Pis. 15:1-2). After 70 CE, the entire slope of Area El became covered with the thick, tumbled debris of Stratum 5. The slope below the line of the old fortifications and wall W.201 were covered over by the thick stone debris of these walls, and by large quantities of material from the top of the slope. Among the other numerous finds there, not found in situ , there was a monumental Hebrew inscription (Reg. No. E.1816),51 found in the debris of Stratum 5, in Square N 6. From the palaeographic standpoint, it can be assumed that the inscription originally belonged to Stratum 12. Area G (Figs. 16-24; Pis. 25:2-36:1) Area Supervisors : David Tarier (1978-1982); Keren Seger (1978); Jane Cahill (1980-82) The location of Area G, at the top of the eastern slope, at the spot closest to the upper part of the hill of the City of David, imbues it with special significance (Pis. 2:2, 25:2). Under the conditions prevailing in Jerusalem, and in the City of David, this was the most convenient location of excavations, where chances were best for reaching the early strata of the Bronze and Iron Ages, close to the location of the acropolis of the early city. For this reason it was selected for excavation by several previous investigators here, such as Macalister, Crowfoot and Kenyon.52 These excavations contributed much to the understanding of the early remains of the city, but they also limited the areas available to the present expedition, and covered further areas with their dumps. Our excavations were thus planned in Squares A-E 2-6, in which we assumed that there were chances of reaching undisturbed strata (PL 26: l).53 Work began close to the base of the city-wall and spread, during the several seasons, eastward and northward. All in all here, so far about 475 sq.m. 15</page><page sequence="26">have been cleared. The excavations, starting at the 1978 surface, thus encountered several strata at one and the same time. The more northward we worked, the more we encountered later strata which had not been touched by our predecessors (Pis. 26:2-27: 1). Stratum 16 (Figs. 18 and 16), of the Late Bronze Age II, was found to contain remains spreading over an area of ca. 200 sq.m. On the basis of photographs from the Kenyon expedition, which excavated the southern half of Area G, it could be learned that the bedrock fell there rather steeply, not only eastward toward the Kedron Valley but also southward.54 This topographical situation forced the builders of Stratum 16 to resort to complicated architectural solutions, and explains the complex nature of the massive substructures built there during Stratum 16. This substructure is comprised of a framework oriented north-south along the slope and east-west across it, forming "boxes" containing a dry stone fill, often with layers of earth levelling its surface above (Pis. 26:2-28:2). This system is divided between two terraces: the lower one, between walls W.323, 333, 338 and 775 (Squares A-C 3-4 and D 4; Pis. 27:2-28:1) and the upper one, from the line of wall W.323, 333 of Stratum 10 (apparently built on the early line of Stratum 16) westward to beneath the remains of the Strata 7-6 city-wall and to the rock scarp and walls W.370, 373, 741, 743 and 748 (Squares A-B 2-3; PI. 28:2). The best example of this building technique is in Squares A-B 2-4. Walls W.338, 362, 756, 775, form the eastern limit of the substructure and are integrated with walls W.351, 354 and 359, facing west (Pis. 26:2, 27:2, 29:1). These walls were built as supporting walls abutting the stone fill of Stratum 16 (L.863-864). The supporting walls were preserved to a height of 3-5 m. For technical reasons, we were able to clear little of the stone fill, mainly in Square B 4, and it was found that the fill was at least about 5 m. deep (PI. 28: 1). Further parts of the stone fill and the supporting walls were found at the southern end of the excavated area (Squares A 2-3, walls W.370, 743, 747, 758 and 779) and at its northern end (Square D 4, W.745A). Stratigraphically, this system is covered in its northern part by the stepped stone structure of Stratum 14 (Pis. 28:2-29:1), and in its southern part by components of Stratum 10 (PI. 27:2). Upon understanding this feature, we turned to the higher terrace, in Squares A-B 2-3 (Pis. 27:1, 28:2), and narrow sections were cut, wall faces were cleaned and the filling material between them was examined. Here, too, it was found that the series of supporting walls, preserved to a height of 5-6 m., was built in a manner similar to those on the lower terrace, and were integrated with the stone and earth fill. Here, then, we have encountered an impressive substructure within our excavations. Its dimensions, as known so far, are 12 X 20 m., and the difference in height from the top of the walls and the fill on the west down to their base on the east is about 10 m.55 It should be emphasized that the data on heights on the east are based on the final stages of our work in the 1982 season, and not on the original base of the walls of the structure. Especially impressive is the profile of the structure, seen in the general section from north to south along the lower terrace (Fig. 18). In the northern Square E 4, the top of the fill and supporting wall W.745A approach the level of the bedrock there. It is possible that a part of the structure of this stratum (W.770; Figs. 18, 16) was built up against it. To the south there is a considerable drop in height. The supporting walls and the fills were cleared there by Kenyon and ascribed by her to the 14th- 13th centuries BCE.56 The series of terraces was preserved to a height of 7-8 m., and this is indicative of the steepness of the substructure to the south as well.57 All this together points to a very massive substructure in Stratum 16, which went eastward beyond the natural, topographical line of the hill, and enabled the expansion of the construction area for the important buildings in this area, the highest part of the Canaanite city. In the light of this body of data, based on local topography and on the accompanying archaeological remains, we assume that the substructure uncovered here was part of the acropolis of Jerusalem in the Late Bronze Age. The preserved height of the walls of the substructure and the steepness of the slopes below certainly contributed to the impressive picture of this quarter of Canaanite Jerusalem. Our study of the pottery from the stone fills of the substructure, which was rather limited in quantity, is still in progress, but already it can be determined that this building cannot be assigned to a period earlier than Stratum 16, and it is possible that it was built only ca . the 13th century BCE.58 Stratum 14 (Figs. 16, 17, 19): a decided change in Area G took place with the building of the stepped 16</page><page sequence="27">stone structure (walls W.302, 331) spreading over Squares C 4-5 and C-D 2-3. We have not yet reached the base of this structure, but its impressive dimensions speak for themselves: the maximal width of the preserved portion is about 13 m., and its height, 16.5 m., and so far 55 steps have been uncovered (Pis. 26:2-27:1). The 15 lowest steps (W.331) were built of stones averaging 30 X 30/40 cm. (PI. 29: 1), whereas the 40 upper steps are built of particularly large limestone blocks (30/50 X 50 cm.). In the sectional trench cut through Macalister's dumps, in Squares C 1-2, the levelled top of the structure was again encountered (PI. 26 :2).59 The base of the structure was reinforced in Square E 3 by a jutting buttress, W.350, about 4.90 m. high, it too built over Stratum 16 remains (W.745A). Macalister and Duncan already found that the entire structure had been disturbed for its entire length on the south.60 It can be assumed that part of this disturbance was possibly caused by the building of the city-wall (W.309) and a tower (W.310) in Second Temple times. But the southern part of the structure was apparently damaged already prior to the building of the structures of Stratum 10, which were founded on it and on the tops of the Stratum 16 walls (PI. 27:1). Concerning the date of the stepped stone structure, Macalister, Avigad and Kenyon dealt with this matter, which has proved most controversial.61 It would seem today, for the first time, that we can determine its date in an orderly manner, in the light of its stratigraphie and ceramic context, and thus correct the mistakes of our predecessors, who possessed insufficient evidence. The entire structure lies upon the remains of two large, built terraces of the large substructure of Stratum 16. Though it seems that during its construction at several spots, mainly on the lower terrace (Squares B-C 5) it was integrated with the monumental remains of Stratum 16, from the other parts it is clear that it lies over them and covers them entirely. Below we shall see that the foundations of the new buildings of the end of the Iron Age, of Stratum 10, and possibly already in Stratum 11, were built over the lower half of the terraced structure (Figs. 19, 22). Their construction led to serious disturbances throughout the remains near and above the stepped stone structure. Considerable effort was spent in this area in locating undisturbed layers and fragments of fill directly related to the stepped stone structure. Several such patches were indeed located and the associated pottery included clear examples from Stratum 14, of the 10th century BCE (L.800, 949, 978). We assume that the stepped stone structure served as a huge supporting wall, holding up the slope at this spot, to contain the earlier remains and to serve as a substructure for the upper structure of the citadel of the City of David, built there over the remains of the Jebusite citadel.62 Among the objects discovered in this stratum, especially noteworthy are the fragments of a cultic stand and the fist of a bronze statuette. The fragments of the square cultic stand (Reg. No. G.5689) were found scattered in Square C 5, 63 mostly together with Stratum 14 pottery (Fig. 23; PI. 29:2). Similar cultic stands have been found at 10th century BCE Taanach,64 and in Strata VA-IVB at Megiddo.65 The various fragments joined to the upper part of a nude male figure with pointed beard and especially long hair.66 At the centre of the body there is an additional pair of hands(?). The figure may have carried some animal on its shoulders, with its feet dangling below, or the hands may have belonged to other figures which held the main one (a captive ?) from either side. A similar depiction of the shape of the head, the hair and the beard is typical of the figures of the "Sea Peoples" from Enkomi in Cyprus.67 But there are also possible parallels for this nude figure in the depiction of two prisoners being led in a procession before a king (of Megiddo ?), on an "ivory dagger" from Megiddo (13th- 12th centuries BCE).68 The bronze fist (Reg. No. G. 11201) is part of a bronze figurine (Fig. 24; PI. 29:3). Similar figurines are known from the Syro-Palestinian-Cypriot sphere, and from various sites in the Eastern Mediterranean basin, from the Late Bronze Age till the 10th century BCE.69 The fist is from the right hand of the statuette. The socket at the base of the palm facilitated its attachment to the arm of the figure. Generally, such a joint was made at the shoulder, rather than at the hand.70 The perforation passing through the palm enabled the attachment of a sceptre, a weapon or some similar object. On the basis of the proportions of the fist, which is ca. 4 cm. long, it is possible to reconstruct the full size of the figure, and it appears to have been one of the largest of its type - about 38 cm. high (twice the average size of such figurines).71 Stratum 10 (Figs. 16, 20-22, 25): Most of Area G, during the 10th-7th centuries BCE, was apparently 17</page><page sequence="28">not built-up, except for the stepped stone structure, which covered most of it. Toward the end of the Iron Age, a further change took place in the urban planning in this part of the City of David. This mainly comprised the construction of a strip of buildings, the walls of which were founded on the remains of the Canaanite substructure in the south, and on the lower half of the stepped structure in the central and northern parts of the area. In order to obtain convenient surfaces for these buildings, two terraces were constructed, abutting the massive supporting walls - e.g. the lower terrace, W.753 on the east, which utilized and thickened the earlier supporting walls of Stratum 16 (Pis. 26:2, 29:2) (W.323-325, 333). The terraces were filled with earth, mainly on the eastern side, and levelled to the height of the floors of the new buildings. The structures of the upper terrace surround the stepped stone structure on the east and north, cutting into it or utilizing it as a back wall (Squares C-D 3-4). Three main units have been discerned from south to north: The "house of Ahiel", the "Burnt Room" and the "House of the Bullae" (Fig. 25). The southern half of Area G, occupied by a large "Four- room house",72 denoted the "House of Ahiel" (L. 790, in Squares A-C 3-4; W.315, 323-325, 327, 335-336, 342; Pis. 27:1, 28:1, 30:1). It measures ca. 8 X 12 m. and is of better construction than most of the buildings in Area El. The quoins and doorways were built of dressed limestone. On one of these ashlars, 40 cm. long, was discovered in the debris of the building, and bore an incised Hebrew inscription (Reg. No. G.4809) giving two names: 73 In the side rooms, the ceiling had been supported by two monoliths on the west and two built piers on the east. The "House of Ahiel" had three service rooms adjoining on the north (L.789, 818; PL 29:1). In L.818, thirty-seven (!) storejars were discovered, most of them of the type bearing rosette impressions on their handles, from the end of the Iron Age (PL 30:2). On one of them, two such impressions were found on two of the four handles (Reg. No. G.4885). A similar rosette impression was discovered on the handle of a jug(!) from this stratum. L.789 - a small cell (1.40 X 1.40 m.) - had an especially thick plaster floor, and in one corner there was a stone installation which may have served as a toilet, like that found in Area E3 (PL 31 :1).74 The installation was sunken into the floor and was located above a "cesspit" ca . 2.60 m. deep. Between the service rooms and the base of the terraced building in Square D 4, there remained an open space which served as an inner court for the above complex. Wall W.329 ran along its entire northern side, setting it off from another building, L.868, which was covered by thick debris (some 2-3 m. deep), from the end of the Iron Age. There were stone stairs abutting wall W.329, apparently leading westward and then northward (?) to a further terrace with buildings, at the top of the slope. In Squares D-E 5, we excavated the southern part of another building - the "Burnt Room" (L.977; Pis. 31:1-32:2). This structure, too, was preserved to the height of its second storey. The stairs W.343, found alongside wall W.340, led to this upper floor (Figs. 20-25). Carbonized remains of the wooden beams from the ceiling were found in situ , resting on a shelf high along the western wall (W.368); the monolith integrated at the centre of wall W.765 had served to support these beams as well. The entire building has a thick coat of white plaster. On the low terrace (Squares B-C 5-6, L.967), we began clearing another structure, only a narrow strip (ca. 1X8 m.) of which has been revealed. It is now denoted the "House of the Bullae", for fifty-one clay bullae were found in its northern corner (PL 29:1). As noted, all this new building activity is ascribed to Stratum 10. In most of the structures, it has been possible to discern a secondary phase, finding expression mainly in the slight raising of floor levels and in slight changes in some walls, without any modification to the basic framework of the strip of buildings. Thus, we have denoted these two phases as Strata 10B and 10C. The process of destruction of Stratum 10B also had two phases: the main phase involved the physical destruction of the buildings. Closely following upon this, but after the city had been razed, the structures and supporting walls began to collapse, and the debris began tumbling down the slope. This accumulation, the thickness of which occasionally reaches several metres, has been denoted Stratum 10A. There is no essential distinction in the pottery of the several phases of Stratum 10. The picture of the destruction of Stratum 10 in Area G is uniform and clear-cut. The destruction of the buildings was total. Prior to this there was a conflagration. The charred remains of wooden beams were found above the floors, as in L.997. During the process of destruction, some of the walls of the upper storeys collapsed, filling up the space of the lower floors (PL 32:1). This initial debris and the 18</page><page sequence="29">subsequent debris which accumulated over it, stemming from the tumbling of remains from the upper terraces shortly after the destruction (Stratum 10A), served to preserve the walls which had not yet collapsed, mainly the western and northern walls, and all the rich finds found there (Pis. 31:2, 33:1). Most of these finds have thus been ascribed to the destruction layer - Stratum 10B. These include tens of pottery vessels of all types, typical of the latest pottery phase of the Iron Age II in Judah (PL 30:2).75 The pottery finds are accompanied by scores of bronze and iron arrowheads, found mainly in the "Burnt Room" and in the "House of the Bullae", and which are indicative of the "war atmosphere" in Jerusalem on the eve of its destruction (PL 33:2). There were also iron implements, such as mason's hammers and adzes, various stoneware, and standard stone weights of all the known shekel multiples.76 Particularly interesting are two Hebrew ostraca, mentioning, among other names, that of "Ahiel" (Reg. Nos. G.4599, G.4849), which lent its name to the large, "Four-room house" in Area G.77 The script on the Stratum 10 ostraca is typical of the latest phase of the Iron Age II.78 Two sherds of local ware are especially noteworthy (Reg. Nos. G.4738 and G.5793), as well as a third sherd, from Area El (Reg. No. E.3305), all of which bears grafitti made after firing, giving south Arabian names in South Arabian script.79 The discovery of such objects, in the Jerusalem of the eve of its destruction, is of particular importance in connection with the cultural ties between Judah and the Red Sea and South Arabia in this period. Two Tridacna shells incised with floral motifs (Reg. Nos. G.2063 and G.2227), which also must originally have come from the Red Sea, also point to similar connections.80 The "Burnt Room" was so denoted because of the numerous lumps of carbonized wood and ash found on its floors. In part, the charred wood came from the wooden beams and ceiling (PL 32:1). We assumed that a large part of them belonged to the wooden decoration and furniture which was burned here, and this was confirmed during our examination of the charred wood in our laboratory.81 It turned out that several of the pieces of charred wood, the largest of which was ca. 6 m. long, were carved in a manner and with motifs generally known from the ornamental ivories of the Iron Age, such as the palmette motif (Reg. No. G. 15226; PL 34 :1).82 Some of the more crudely worked pieces were identified as of Pistacia Atlantica , a local tree, found in Israel. The fine worked pieces are of boxwood, a tree not found locally. They may have been imported only from northern Syria or southern Anatolia. Pieces of bone and ivory inlay were also found here. Group of bullae , L.967, Stratum 10B: The fifty-one bullae discovered in the "House of the Bullae" (L.967) formed the highlight of the finds from Stratum 10B in Area G. The main bulk of the finds in this locus were concentrated in the northern corner, on the plastered floor; the plaster also covered the western wall (W.753) of the building, which also served as a base for the supporting wall of the upper terrace (Figs. 20, 22, 25; PL 29:1). Inter alia, there were a number of pottery vessels, small bowls and jugs typical of Stratum 10B, and four limestone stands (cultic stands?) measuring 11-13 X 13 cm. and ca . 20 cm. high (Reg. Nos. G. 11 594-5, G. 11674, G.11699; Pis. 34:2-35:1). The bullae were found concentrated in this corner, scattered on the floor along with much ash. The conflagration of the destruction had baked the clay bullae, and thus they are hard and well preserved. Study of the bullae, as with the other palaeographical material, is being carried out in cooperation with J. Naveh. Of the 51 bullae, 41 are legible, and 4 bear depictions but are uninscribed. The readings of four bullae are partial or doubtful. There are also two small fragments of additional bullae. The average size of the oval bullae is 11/16-13/19 mm., with the oval seal-impressions being about 7/11-9/13 mm. The formula of the inscriptions is uniform throughout, as usual on Hebrew seals in Judah in the 7th century BCE: "Belonging to X son of Y" - e.g. "Belonging to Elnathan son of Bilgai", "Belonging to Benayahu son of Hosha'yahu" (PL 35:2), or "Belonging to 'Azaryahu son of Hilkiyahu" (Fig. 26). In several instances, the word for "son" is omitted - e.g. "Belonging to 'Efroah (or 'Efrah) (son of) 'Ahiyahu". All in all there are some 82 legible names, though some of them appear several times; in other words, there are 51 different names involved. Of these, 38 appear only once, while the others appear twice or even three times. A high percentage of the names, but not all, have the theophoric suffix -yahu. A decided majority of the names themselves are known from the Bible, from stone seals, seal-impressions, other bullae and the Elephantine Papyri.83 The bullae bearing depictions are uninscribed; the motifs depicted are a bird, a balance and an altar (?). 19</page><page sequence="30">The date of the bullae, which are from the destruction stratum in Area G, Stratum 10B, of the late 7th-early 6th centuries BCE, is certain in the light of the stratigraphie, pottery and palaeographic evidence. The fact that one of the bullae (Reg. No. G. 11601) bears the name "Gemaryahu son of Shaphan" adds historical-biblical weight to this dating (PL 35:3). Despite the quantity of seals, seal- impressions and bullae found in Judah in the Iron Age II,84 it has not proved possible until recently, to make any positive identification between name of any (non-royal) personage mentioned in the Bible with any name appearing on a seal or seal- impression. Recently, however, Avigad published three new proposals concerning "Serayahu son of Neriyahu "Berachyahu son of Neriyahu" the scribe and poss- ibly even "Jerahmeel son of the King",85 with bibli- cal identifications. "Germaryahu son of Shaphan" the scribe, mentioned on one of the bullae from the City of David, is a known figure active at the court of Jehoiakim, King of Judah (608-597 BCE), and mentioned several times by Jeremiah (36:10-12, 25). With all caution due in such instances, we assume that the identity proposed here - between the name on the bulla and that of the biblical personage - is very probable. The fact that the names identified by Avigad are also mentioned in this period in the book of Jeremiah is of more than passing interest. The origin of our bullae is known and well documented in our controlled excavations, and thus their primary significance. The papyri which they had once sealed have not survived, whether because of the fire or because of subsequent moisture, and so their contents are unknown. It is still possible to discern the impression of the papyrus on the reverses of the bullae, as well as of the string which had tied them and had been sealed by the bullae. The fact that the names do not overly repeat themselves, as would be expected in a private or family archive, and the appearance of the name of a known official in the royal court (Jeremiah 36:13), would indicate that this find may represent a public archive, located in some bureau close to the administrative centre in the City of David. Stratum 9 (Figs. 17, 27): In Squares D-E 3-5, we located oblique layers of earth lying between the top of the debris of Stratum 10A and the sloped base of Stratum 7. Along with these layers were walls and supporting walls which have been ascribed stratigraphically to Stratum 9, mainly in Squares D-E 4-5 (PL 33:1). Some of the walls (e.g. W.746, 754) served to support the stone debris of the buildings of Stratum 10, stabilizing them and levelling them off. Other walls (W.303, 307) served as a sort of support for the layers of fill and for the accumulàtion of Stratum 9 (L.718, 744, 756, 788, 950), and together with more massive walls (W. 311, 314) and layers of stone (L.763, 806), formed a stratigraphically well-defined layer, though it was unclear as to its occupational character.86 The rich repertory of the pottery groups is typical of the Persian period, and is accompanied by a plethora of "yhd", "phw"' and various animal seal-impres- sions;87 all these, together fix the stratigraphi- cal and the chronological ascription of Stratum 9 in the Persian period.88 Stratum 7 (Figs. 27-29): The latest building activity in Area G took place during Stratum 7, in the Hellenistic-Hasmonean period. On the surface of the rock scarp at the top of the eastern slope, the "First Wall" was built; that is, the city-wall of the Has- monean period (W. 309).89 This wall incorporated into it older segments such as the top of the stepped stone structure (W.302) and parts of Nehemiah's wall(?), adding new parts, such as the large tower (W.310) and the northern tower excavated by Macalister and Kenyon (Pis. 26: 1-27: l).90 The slope below the base of this city-wall was covered by various accumulations, mainly the stone debris of Strata 10 and 9. It seems that there was a need to seal the surface of the slope, to prevent further slides and collapses. For this purpose, during Stratum 7B, a sort of thick earth glacis was built here, clear fragments of which are preserved in Squares A-E 5 and E-L 4 (Pis. 26:1, 36:1-2). This glacis was made up of layers of earth, chalky earth, and gravel and cobbles, tipped one over the other alternately (L.706, 710, 721, 732, 762, 919, 965, 968 and 980; see Figs. 27 and 29). The earth layers were well tamped and they could be "peeled ofF' in an orderly manner, one after the other. In several spots within the glacis, small stone walls were found, intended to stabilize the mass (W.305, 312-313, 316, 318, 764). In a few fragments, the outermost surface of the glacis was preserved, more or less faced with flat stone slabs. The overall thickness of the glacis varied between 3 and 4 m. On the basis of the gradient of the layers within the glacis, it can be assumed that in its upper part it rests upon the surviving stepped stone 20</page><page sequence="31">structure, rose over the remains of Strata 10 and 9 and reached to the base of the city-wall (Fig. 28; PL 26:1). The layers of the glacis contained much Iron Age II and Hellenistic pottery. The latest representative groups among the pottery were the sherds typifying Stratum 7B, of the Hellenistic period down to ca. 100 BCE. We thus assume that there is a direct connection between the support of the slope at this spot and the general construction of the "First Wall" under the Hasmoneans. We may assume that it served here as an architectural-defensive element down to the destruction of Jerusalem at the end of Stratum 6. The line of fortifications of the "First Wall", located at the top of the eastern slope of the City of David, from then on served as the permanent limit of the settled area atop the hill (Fig. 3). The upper strata of the eastern slope in Area G were mostly excavated by Macalister and Kenyon. During our excavations we also uncovered much debris heaped up outside the wall and over the remains of the Strata 7-6 glacis, and which contained various small finds from Strata 7-3. Considerable accumulations of stone and earth debris, apparently dumped there from within the city, accumulated on the slope during the course of Stratum 3, of the Byzantine period. Area J (Figs. 30-32; Pis. 37:1-40:2) Area Supervisor : Don Glick (1980-82) The Gihon Spring at the base of the eastern slope of the City of David has served the inhabitants of Jerusalem since its foundation at the beginning of the Early Bronze Age (PL 3). The water systems stemming from this spring include: "Warren's Shaft", the "Siloam Channel" and "Hezekiah's Tunnel" (Fig. 30). The expedition dealt mainly with Warren's Shaft and the Siloam Channel. Area J basically included the various parts of Warren's Shaft. Parts of the other water systems were found in the lower part of Area J (the Siloam Channel), in Area B and Area Al (the Siloam Channel and Hezekiah's TunneO.91 Warren's Shaft : This system was discovered by Charles Warren in 18 76.92 It was examined in detail by the Parker expedition, the results of which were published by Vincent.93 Since 1979, archaeological excavations have been conducted here by the City of David Expedition94 and a hydro-geological survey has been carried out by Dan Gil.95 The system contains several components: (l)an entrance area (L.1062); (2) a stepped tunnel (L.1069); (3) a horizontal tunnel (L.1068); (4) a vertical shaft (L.1065); (5) a connecting tunnel (L.1067); (6) the spring (see Figs. 31-32; Pis. 37:1-38:2). The entrance is hewn into the rock at the head of the stepped tunnel, which descends to a depth of about 8 m. to the beginning of the horizontal tunnel.96 The latter, some 28 m. long, is slightly oblique, descending to the head of the vertical shaft. This shaft, oval in section, descends 12.30 m. down to the level at which water is met, coming from the spring some 22 m. away through the connecting tunnel. Other secondary features include the following: in the upper entrance area, a later building phase is evident - the "vaulted chamber" protecting the entrance from silting and debris from the eastern slope. An entry tunnel was built within it, connecting this later phase with the surface (L.1060; PL 39:1), and the opening of the blocked cave at the lower end of the horizontal tunnel (L.1070). The additional shaft - the "trial shaft" (L.1064) - can now be understood in the light of the hydro-geological survey: it transpires that the additional shaft, the cave and the vertical shaft, as well as the lower part of the horizontal tunnel, are all natural karst clefts tunnels and shafts, utilized , and integrated into the water system. This fact serves to explain the anomaly and irregularity of the plan and dimensions of some of these components, in comparison with other water systems (see Table 3).97 It was found, inter alia, that the bottom of Warren's Shaft in its natural form continues to a depth of some 3 m. more beneath the known level of the spring, of the floor of Hezekiah's Tunnel and of the bottom of the vertical shaft known to date (Fig. 32). The water flowed from the spring through the connecting tunnel to the base of the vertical shaft, whence it could be drawn, as in a well, by anyone having come down the upper tunnels to the head of the shaft. Here we see a unique exploitation of a series of natural tunnels and shafts, which were integrated to form a continuous water system. Its planners utilized the natural vertical shaft and the steep step, 2.7 m. high, which separate the horizontal tunnel from the stepped tunnel, as a means of 21</page><page sequence="32">breaking direct access between the external spring and the interior of the city, and hence ready penetration into the city. This integration of artificial and natural components, as we have noted, serves to explain the peculiar form of this system, and supersedes all previous explanations.98 The discovery of the line of the city-wall in Area E, and by Kenyon in her sectional trench A," indicates that the entrance area known to us today was indeed within the fortifications at a spot apparently adjacent to the "Water Gate". The continuation of this system should possibly be sought higher up, near the additional gate discovered by Parker in 1909, at the top of the slope above the spring (PL 25 :2).100 The Siloam Channel /Tunnel (Pis. 2:2, 3:1, 5:2, 39:2-40:2): Various segments of this water system have been investigated by Meistermann, Schick, Bliss and Dickie, and Shiloh.101 The City of David Expedition has uncovered three segments in the lower part of Area J, in Area B and in Area Al, totalling a length of some 120 m. (out of an overall length of about 400 m.). It differs basically from the other water systems of this period in that it served to carry water partly in a rock-hewn and stone-covered channel (PL 40:2) and partly in a rock-hewn tunnel (Pis. 5:2, 39:2-40:1). Its use was threefold: (1) for conducting the waters of the Gihon spring along the Kedron Valley to the region of reservoirs at the lower end of the Central Valley, at the south-western tip of the City of David; (2) in the eastern wall of the channel, facing the valley in Area B, there are window-like apertures through which the flow of water could be diverted for irrigation of agricultural plots in the valley (Fig. 8; L. 106-4, 106-5, 106-6; and (3) the upper openings along the channel could be utilized for gathering the runoff from the rock surface outside the city-walls on the slope above, thus diverting them to the above noted reservoirs (PL 8: 1). The major disadvantage of this system was its vulnerability, its entire course being outside the fortified area of the city. Thus, it was necessarily a peace-time system. The inauguration of Hezekiah's Tunnel actually affected only the first of the three functions of this channel. The new tunnel superseded the Siloam Channel (Channel II) in its function (1), but the southern end of the channel, in Area AI, was miA HEIGHT m 35-1 30- S3 25 10 Q 0 ^ no 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 m •pom pmn HORIZONTAL DISTANCE Table 3: Comparative table of the slopes of the tunnels in Iron Age water systems: 1-3, Warren's Shaft; 4-5, Gibeon, "Pool"; 6, Gezer; 7-8, Gibeon, "Stepped Tunnel"; 9, Megiddo; 10, Hazor 22</page><page sequence="33">integrated into the new system as an overflow channel of the Siloam Pool (Channel IV and I Va; Fig. 4); by lowering its floor level, the direction of flow in this segment was reversed, it now flowing from west to east (Pis. 4:2, 5:2). Hezekiah's Tunnel : This tunnel has occupied the attention of various scholars since the very beginning of modern archaeological research in Jerusalem.102 This water system solved the special problems of water supply in the City of David in a sophisticated though simple manner. Its components are (l)the spring; (2) the tunnel; (3) the Siloam Pool; and (4) an overflow channel. From the spring, the tunnel continues some 533 m. under the spur of the City of David till it reaches the Siloam Pool. The survey of the current archaeological expedition revealed that - in contrast to all that has previously been published - the difference in height between the beginning of the channel at the spring and at the end of the tunnel is only about 30 cm. (a gradient of only 0.6°/ooę, see Fig. 32). The average height of the tunnel is around 2 m. At its southern end the height reaches 5 m. The remains of the reservoirs and parts of the fortifications which were uncovered at the bottom of the Central Valley by Guthe, Bliss, Weill and Shiloh are no earlier than Second Temple times.103 The reservoirs of First Temple times should, most probably, be restored on the same site, originally fed by the Siloam Channel. We should also restore here the beginning of the new line of defences from the days of Hezekiah, ascending westward and encompassing the Western Hill.104 According to this view, the site of the main reservoir is not to be sought beyond the line of the dam to the east, in the Kedron Valley.105 The overflow channel of the Siloam Pool, which utilized the southern-most part of the Siloam Channel, led the surplus water into the Kedron stream-bed in a controlled manner. Here, too, the water could be gathered in additional reservoirs, though these could be of value only in times of peace, their location being far outside the line of fortifications. The overflow channel was blocked up by a stone wall (W.15) in Second Temple times (Fig. 4). 106 Function and Dating of the Three Jerusalem Water Systems : There is general agreement amongst scholars as to the relative chronology of these three water systems: Warren's Shaft is certainly the oldest; the Siloam Channel is contemporaneous with it or slightly later, while Hezekiah's Tunnel is the latest of the three, built at the end of the 8th century BCE. The ascription of the hewing of Hezekiah's Tunnel to the reign of that king, late in the 8th century BCE, is based on specific evidence in the Bible (2 Kings 20:20; 2 Chronicles 32:30) and the Apocrypha (Ben Sira 48:17), as well as on palaeographic analysis of the Siloam Inscription, discovered near the southern terminus of the tunnel in 1880. At its upper end, Hezekiah's Tunnel utilizes the connecting tunnel running between the spring and the bottom of Warren's Shaft. The southern end of the Siloam Channel became pärt of the overflow channel of the Hezekiah's Tunnel system and the replanned Siloam Pool. For these reasons, we advance the date of the Siloam Channel107 and Warren's Shaft to the 10th-9th centuries BCE, prior to the date of Hezekiah's Tunnel (8th century BCE). After the discovery of Warren's Shaft, Birch (1878)108 followed by Vincent,109 suggested identifying it with the sinnor mentioned in the ac- count of David's conquest of Jebus and the exploits of Joab ben Zeruiah (2 Samuel 6:6-9; 1 Chronicles 11 :4-t).1 10 This has been rejected, on various grounds - and rightly so - by such scholars as Dalman, Albright, Yadin, Mazar, Aharoni and Braslavi.111 If such an ascription were accepted, this water system in Jerusalem would have been built already by the Canaanites - and would thus comprise a basic precedent, typologically and chronologically.112 In Jerusalem, thus, a complex picture of the water system emerges. The source of water in this city - the Gihon - is a cyclic or pulsating spring quite different in hydrological character from the ordinary sources on other sites, which generally are fed by regular springs or by the water table. In order to utilize efficiently the great quantities of water gushing forth from the Gihon spring, they must necessarily be gathered in reservoirs. The most suitable location for such pools, as far as both topography and planning were concerned, was at the foot of the Central Valley. The gathering of the waters at this spot, whether via the Siloam Channel or through Hezekiah's Tunnel, enabled the full, controlled exploitation of almost the entire yield of water (Pis. 1, 3:2). The Siloam Channel was the initial means of conveying the waters of the Gihon to reservoirs to the south; at the same time, it also enabled utilization 23</page><page sequence="34">of the waters for irrigation in the Kedron Valley. The major disadvantage of this early system was that, as noted, all its components - spring, channel and pool - were situated outside the walls of the city. Hezekiah's Tunnel provided a sophisticated remedy in the days of King Hezekiah (Stratum 12): not only was the entire conduit concealed beneath the rock surface, but the area of the reservoirs was now brought into the fortified area of the city, the walls having been extended to include the Western Hill, as discovered in the Jewish Quarter excavations.113 The Siloam Channel could have continued to function in Strata 11-10, as an aqueduct for the fields along the Kedron Valley. Warren's Shaft was built according to the usual formula for underground water systems at royal centres in the 10th-9th centuries BCE. It connected the northern part of the City of David (and perhaps even its citadel) with the water source. In the late 8th-6th centuries BCE (Strata 12-10), the three systems could have functioned simultaneously, all fed from the single source, and the flow of water through them could have been controlled. Hezekiah's Tunnel has continuously conveyed water to the Siloam Pool ever since. Water could also reach the base of Warren's Shaft, from whence it could be drawn for use in the city directly above. The late phase in the entrance chamber of Warren's Shaft - the vault and the entrance tunnel - indicate that in the 1st century BCE this installation was still being maintained, whether as a water system per se or for some other use of the extensive subterranean chambers in its upper parts.114 The Siloam Channel went out of use as the main conduit of water at the time of the construction of Hezekiah's Tunnel, which cut the channel off from direct contact with the area of the pool. But the channel could have continued in use, till the end of the First Temple period, as a regular means of distributing irrigation water in the Upper Kedron Valley, and for feeding various reservoirs there. We still lack all data on the supply of water to the uppermost and most important parts of Jerusalem in this period - the Temple Mount and the adjacent palace complex. 24</page><page sequence="35">SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS In the present section, we present an overall picture of the results of our work in all excavational areas to date, period by period (Fig. 34). It must be remembered that we have encountered here on the hill of the City of David a unique phenomenon stemming from the local conditions for building, from the extent of the destruction and from the mode of excavation on such a steep, rocky slope.115 The continuity of accumulation of the strata in the various excavational areas was not uniform. The builders in each stratum sought to found their structures directly on bedrock, and thus often they damaged earlier strata, which occasionally were even destroyed altogether. For this reason, Strata 12-10 were especially preserved, for they are the last major construction strata on the eastern slope. The ancient city-wall was maintained for hundreds of years at the same level and on the same line, and at certain spots we repeatedly find wall segments of one period reutilized and refurbished in a later period. Thus, the fact that archaeological evidence of a given period is lacking in a particular area does not necessarily prove that that period was not represented on that site.116 With each new season of excavations, and with the expansion of the area exposed down to bedrock, the stratigraphical-occupational series of the City of David becomes more complete. At present, the cumulative material from all our excavational areas provides a series covering most of the historical periods on this site, from the Chalcolithic period down to medieval times (Fig. 3; Table 2). Stratum 21: Some pottery from the Chalcolithic period was found in clefts and natural pits in the bedrock. Only in Area B did we locate a pure ceramic layer solely of this period. In Areas El and E2, this material was found mixed with pottery of Stratum 20. The sparsity of finds from this stratum - which includes fragments of chalices, churns, bowls and kraters - does not enable, for the time being, a more precise definition within the Chalcolithic period. Stratum 20 (mainly Early Bronze Age I): In the first four seasons of excavations, evidence of this stratum was found only in clefts and natural pits in the bedrock, mainly in Area E2, outside the line of the city-wall (Fig. 12). Similar items were found in pits in Areas B, Dl, El and E3. On the basis of the conditions of their discovery, it is assumed that they were carried into their find-spots along with the earth which accumulated there, together with Stratum 21 pottery, till the pits and clefts became filled. In Area El, we found that one segment of the Stratum 18 city-wall was built over a thick earth layer which contained mixed pottery, mostly of Stratum 20 and some of Stratum 21. At one spot in Area El, we found on the bedrock a part of a rectangular structure with a bench/shelf abutting its southern wall. This plan is typical of dwellings of the Early Bronze Age I- II, as found at Arad, Tell Far'ah (N), Aphek, Jericho and other sites.117 In this period, apparently, the settlement here was not walled: the eastern part of the house was located beneath the Stratum 18 city-wall. The pottery finds from the pits were mixed with some Chalcolithic sherds, and all of it bore patterns typical of the Early Bronze Age I pottery groups - such as the red painted, burnished and plain wares. The pottery from the rectangular house, in contrast, included a few items, mainly fragments of bowls and burnished trays with sharply angled rims, which enable a slightly later dating for this stratum - to the end of the Early Bronze Age I, and possibly even to the beginning of the Early Bronze Age II. Similar finds were made by Macalister and Parker. At the top of the eastern slope, adjacent to our Area G, Parker cleared several tombs which contained mainly vessel groups of red painted ware from the Early Bronze Age I.118 25</page><page sequence="36">Strata 18-17 - Middle Bronze Age IIA-B (Fig. 14): Most of the finds representing this period are from Area El. The sherds from this period are from other areas as well, but were not found in situ , rather having been transported to spots down to bedrock, where we found them, e.g. in Areas B, D1 and E3. The major component in Stratum 18 was the city- wall, the foundations of which were laid on the bedrock, and on few remains of Strata 21-20. In Stratum 18A we found that the city-wall was thickened in a particular segment. The city-wall in Area El can actually be ascribed to three phases of this period, which included fills, pavements and walls. The pottery found in these three phases was similar and belongs to the brief transition period from the end of the Middle Bronze Age IIA to the start of the Middle Bronze Age IIB. We have ascribed the foundation of the city-wall to about 1800 BCE. A similar date was determined by Kenyon for another segment of this wall, uncovered by her farther to the north, in her trench A119 (Fig. 3). As noted, was have not to date found in this area any pottery items which would clearly represent the bulk of the Middle Bronze Age IIB. Further remains of this period, including mainly evidence of a structure and occupational layers close to the bedrock, were found at the western end of the upper sectional trench in Area El, near the upper rock scarp. The findings from the City of David Excavations today conjure a clear picture of a fortified city during the 18th century BCE. A little pottery of this period was also found in pockets in the bedrock cleared south of the Temple Mount. The line of the solid, massive city-wall of this period, midway down the eastern slope, as found by Kenyon and the present expedition, determined the line of fortifications of the City of David on this flank down to its total destruction in Stratum 10, in the 6th century BCE.120 The major difficulty in identifying the early phase of the city-wall, in Strata 18-17, stems primarily from the repeated utilization of this selfsame line, and in the early nucleus of the wall itself, which continued in use in the successive phases. The main contribution of our present efforts till now, concerning this problem, has been the determination of the location of the city-wall within a clear stratigraphie series including the strata which preceded it, and the occupation levels and contemporaneous structures from Stratum 18 till Stratum 10, and the later layers of debris and terraces, from Stratum 9 (Persian period) on. Stratum 16: Most of the archaeological evidence for the settlement of Jerusalem in the Late Bronze Age II - representing the Jerusalem of the El-Amarna Archive - has been discovered so far in the burial- caves on the hills around the City of David, such as those at "Dominus Flevit"121 or in Nahlat Ahim.122 On the hill of the City of David, too, sherds of this stratum have been found, scattered in the various debris. In Area El, close to the rock scarp and above the layers of Strata 18-17, we discovered a levelled layer of earth and gravel of this stratum. This stratum appeared in full strength in Area G. Kenyon already ascribed the series of stepped terraces located at the top of her trench A to the 14th- 13th centuries BCE. Our excavations in Area G revealed that this series of terraces does not continue southward along the slope but is limited to the region of Area G. The terraces were built facing southward and eastward, hugging the slope and the bedrock to the north and west, and thus forming a massive substructure rising in two main terraces to a height of over 10 m., providing an impressive artificial surface. Only the south-eastern corner of this stepped podium, added to the top of the hill, has been excavated by us. This immense sub-structure added an area of about 200 sq.m. to the top of the hill. In contrast to a normal series of terraces - like that in Area E, built on the eastern slope in order to form dwelling surfaces in Strata 12-10 - the terraces of Stratum 16 do not conform to the gradient of the slope but rather rise very sharply. This impressive structure of supporting walls and fills, found in the area at the top of the City of David, and possibly also in the northernmost part of the city in this period, apparently belonged to the podium of the citadel of the Canaanite-Jebusite city. The main structures of this citadel should be preserved on the bedrock at the top of the slope, beyond the area which can be excavated at present.123 Thus, we can determine that the site of the acropolis in the City of David was fixed, architecturally, in Stratum 16, and this site served not only the Canaanite city but also the "Citadel of David" in the Iron Age II. Stratum 15: Few remains of this stratum were found, in two areas: D1 and El. In Area El architectural remains came to light; in Area Dl, clear layers containing pottery of this period were discerned, laying directly upon bedrock on the upper part of the eastern slope. This is actually the only ceramic- stratigraphic evidence, for the time, for the final 26</page><page sequence="37">phase of the Jebusite city of the 1 2th- 1 1th centuries BCE, prior to its conquest by David. Most of the pottery of this stratum is of the 1 1th century BCE. Stratum 14: The main architectural evidence for the renewed construction of Jerusalem in the 10th century BCE, after its conquest by David, i.e. its rebuilding as the capital of the Israelite kingdom during this century by Solomon (2 Samuel 5:7, 9; 1 Kings 3:1; 9:24; 11:27) was found in Area G. In Area Dl, we found earth layers containing pottery of this stratum. In Area El, on bedrock, among the various stone and clay installations, at one spot two pottery chalices were discovered, and closeby, the fragments of a cultic stand. It is reasonable to assume, on the basis of this concentration of vessels, that during the 10th century BCE there was a cultic corner here.124 The stepped stone structure in Area G is today one of the most impressive surviving monuments of the Iron Age in Israel, based on its size and state of preservation. We assume that it served as a sort of huge supporting wall for a superstructure rising at the top of the eastern slope, at the northern end of the hill of the City of David. It is also reasonable to assume that the planners of the Israelite city, in the 10th century BCE, utilized the area of the Canaanite citadel for a similar structure. Instead of rebuilding the supporting walls of Stratum 16, they covered the surface of the slope with a stepped stone structure, only the northern part of which has survived. Similar architectural segments, somewhat to the south within Area G, discovered by Macalister and by Kenyon,125 may also have belonged to this same structure. Looking at the city from the east, the viewer would have seen an impressive picture of the acropolis - the "Citadel of David" - rising at the top of the eastern slope, standing over the lower hill of the City of David, which was surrounded by the fortifications of the lower wall at the middle of the slope. Farther to the north, in the region of today's Temple Mount, the Temple and the palace were built, as related in the Bible (Stratum 14). Kenyon's excavations revealed two finds which support the public-royal interpretation of the Iron Age II structures here, close to and above the stepped structure. In her area H, she found a segment of a casemate wall which she ascribed to the 10th century BCE.126 In her square XVIII, at the north-western corner of our Area G, fallen debris of small ashlars was found, like those found by us at the northern edge of Area G, and a single Palmette ("Proto- Aeolic") capital.127 Ashlar masonry and this type of capital are the outstanding characteristics of royal architecture at Israelite centres.128 The location of this area, at the top of the lower city of the City of David, south of the limits of the Temple Mount, matches the location of the Ophel in Jerusalem (Isaiah 32:14; Micah 4:8; Nehemiah 3:26-27; 11:21; 2 Chronicles 27:3, 33:14). Though this question cannot be discussed here, it should be noted that "Ophel" is not a name particular to Jerusalem; this is an urban architectural term denoting the outstanding site of the citadel or acropolis, e.g. the "Ophel" mentioned at Samaria (2 Kings 5:24), or that built by Mesha, King of Moab, at Dibon. Though the Jerusalem "Ophel" is mentioned in the Bible only from the days of Jotham (mid-8th century BCE) on (2 Chronicles 27:3), it can reasonably be assumed that the urban planning of Jerusalem, as at other royal centres, was fixed already in the 10th century BCE, at which time the framework for the city was determined.129 The hill of the City of David at that time was divided into three main units, from north to south: the precincts of the Temple Mount and the royal palace; the "Ophel", where the citadel may have been located; and the lower city. The main royal area - the Temple and palace precinct - presently located outside the area of the City of David Excavations, was at that time an entirely new area for construction, an area added to the City of David on the north during the 10th century BCE. The spot where the acropolis may have laid in the Canaanite city, small though outstanding in its form, was reutilized by the Israelite builders. The lower city continued to serve as the residential quarter of the city. In our estimate, in Jerusalem as at other royal centres,130 the first water system of the city was built in this period - "Warren's Shaft". This shaft may not originally have been entered at the "vaulted chamber", as today, but may have continued to a point closer to the "Ophel" area, at the edge of the upper city of the City of David. For the time, we have no means for dating precisely the Siloam Channel, which pre-dates Hezekiah's Tunnel (of Stratum 12), and thus it too may already have served the city in Stratum 14. Stratum 13: So far, few remains of this stratum have come to light, including a layer with pottery of the 9th century BCE, found only in Area El. 27</page><page sequence="38">Strata 12-10 (Fig. 33): Stratum 12, of the 8th century BCE, is notable for its widespread building activity, discovered mainly in Area E on the eastern slope. Historically, this stratum could be ascribed to the building activities of Hezekiah in Jerusalem, well documented in the Bible (Isaiah 22:9-11; 2 Chronicles 32:3-5, 30). Along the eastern slope, at its middle, the final phase of the city-wall of Strata 12-10 has been uncovered. The wall has been exposed by the present expedition for a length of 90 m., and some 20 m. more were revealed by Kenyon131 - yielding a total of about 110 m. exposed length. Only after four seasons of excavations were we able to prove that the builders in the Iron Age II utilized parts of the older line of fortifications, first built on this line in Stratum 18. If indeed the hill of the City of David was fortified from the Middle Bronze Age II on, as can reasonably be assumed, then the line of fortifications should have passed through this spot in subsequent periods as well.132 This location was suitable mainly form the topographical aspect of the bedrock, which forms a rock scarp here, at the middle of the slope - and the wall was built atop it. The northernmost segment of this wall was located in Kenyon's trench A.133 The southernmost part of the line of fortifications in Strata 12-10 is located in Area D2 (Fig. 11), since no evidence for any other defensive line has been found in Areas B and Dl, and we assume that the continuation of this line southward should be restored at the top of the rock scarp in Area Dl (Fig. 9), at the spot where a segment of the Hasmonean "First Wall" is located. At the southern end of the City of David, this wall may have reutilized the line of the older wall there. Thus, our conclusions concerning the City of David supplement those of Avigad in the Jewish Quarter, concerning the relationship and existing between the line of fortifications of the expanded Israelite city, from the days of Hezekiah on, and the Hasmonean line of fortifications surrounding the "Upper City",134 as well as Josephus's descriptions.135 The inclusion of the Western Hill within the fortified Israelite city, during Strata 12-10, opened up new possibilities for reorganizing the city's water supply.136 The region of the mouth of the Central Valley was now situated within the fortified perimeter, and the series of reservoirs there was fed by a new subterranean squeduct - Hezekiah's Tunnel (2 Chronicles 32:3-4, 30; 2 Kings 20:20). At the same time, the two older water systems - Warren's Shaft and the Siloam Channel - continued to serve the City of David, each in its own specific manner.137 Contemporaneous with the renewed construction of the city-wall, and in conjunction with it, in Stratum 12 a residential quarter was rebuilt - uncovered by us in Area E. The natural rock surface served as the base for a series of terraces and supporting walls for the dwellings rising upon them. The external walls of the buildings were integrated with the system of supporting walls, and with the inner side of the city-wall which, besides its defensive capacities, also served as the main supporting belt for the series of terraces above it. Several internal alleyways, some of them stepped, were built between the houses, and in one instance an associated drainage channel has been found, leading runoff from among the houses through the city-wall to outside the city. This series of structures served Strata 12-10. During Strata 11-10, secondary changes took place in most of the buidings. These modifications find expression in the addition or removal of inner walls in various buildings, and the raising of floor-levels, in accord with the several phases. The main changes in the series of Stratum 12 structures occurred in Stratum 11, on the upper terrace in Area El, on which the "Ashlar House" (L.1269) was built - an imposing structure in both size and quality of construction. A phenomenon peculiar to Stratum 12 is the construction of poor, simple dwellings on the rock terrace east of the city-wall, outside the fortified city. These buildings, similar in construction and in their sparse 8th century BCE pottery, were found in Areas Dl and E2. It can reasonably be assumed that the series of buildings discovered by Kenyon at the bottom of her trench A, and one of which was (incorrectly) interpreted as a "cultic structure",138 also belong to this phase. There is no doubt that this special phenomenon, of construction outside the city- wall, was a side-effect of the overall process of the expansion of Jerusalem during the 8th century BCE, most probably toward the end of that century - with the destruction of the northern Kingdom of Israel and the influx of numerous refugees into Judah and its capital.139 The major outcome of this development in Jerusalem was the addition of the Western Hill to the area of the city, and the construction of the "Broad Wall", as brought to light in Avigad's excavations in the Jewish Quarter.140 But 28</page><page sequence="39">whereas this new part of the city, on the Western Hill, continued to develop during Strata 11-10 - down to the Babylonian destruction of the city - structures outside the walls on the eastern slope of the City of David were abandoned at the end of Stratum 12, apparently at the time of Sennacherib's siege of Jerusalem, in 701 BCE. The stepped stone structure was the major construction located in Area G during Strata 14-11. In Stratum 10, during the second half of the 7th century BCE, a turnabout occurred here in the urban planning. The planners of this region no longer found the need to preserve the stepped stone structure and its vicinity in the manner it had served till then. In this area, widespread building activities were taking place, preparing two new terraces on which new buildings arose, such as the "House of Ahiel" and the "Burnt Room" (on the upper terrace) and the "House of the Bullae" (on the lower terrace) (Fig. 25). The structures on the upper terrace were densely built and of a better quality than the dwellings in Area E. These findings in Area G may be evidence of the necessity of expanding the residential area of the city in Stratum 10, during the 7th century BCE, similar to the need which arose during Stratum 12, in the 8th century BCE. This expansion found expression in a complicated engineering feat - the addition of a strip of dwellings in Area G. The unique discovery here, in this stratum, of traces of an archive with bullae would point to the public (official ?) nature of these structures, located in close proximity to the acropolis. The destruction layer of Stratum 10 - the destruction of the entire city by Nebuchadnezzar in 586 BCE - was of similar intensity throughout all the excavational areas in which this stratum was found (Areas D2, E 1-3, G). The evidence in the Bible (2 Kings 25:8-10; Jeremiah 39:18; 2 Chroni- cles 36:18-19) is complemented by the clear-cut archaeological evidence: the total destruction of the various structures, and a conflagration which consumed the various wooden parts of the houses. The pottery of the destruction stratum in all areas is identical with the corpus of pottery typifying the other sites in Judah of the very end of the Iron Age, such as at Lachish stratum II, En-Gedi stratum V, Arad stratum VI and Ramat Rahel stratum V. The contents of the buildings - pottery, stoneware, metal and traces of wooden furniture - were discovered trapped within this layer. The atmosphere of the eve of war and destruction is emphasized by the quantity of weapons found scattered within the various buildings - mainly in Area G. Interestingly, no human remains were found trapped in the ruins. The final collapse of the structures on the eastern slope came about within a short time, probably during the first winter following the fall of the city, when nature's fury would have been most active with no one present to resist it. The supporting walls, part of buildings and segments of the city-wall collapsed and tumbled down the slope, covering it with a thick layer of stone and earth rubble (Stratum 10A). Stratum 9: The condition of destruction in Stratum 10A, and the general state of the City of David and the eastern slope, are dramatically described in the narrative of Nehemiah's night walk around the remains of the city, in the 5th century BCE (Nehemiah 2:13-15). The pottery of Stratum 9 was found scattered throughout most of the excavational areas. In several instances, we succeeded in isolating clear layers of this stratum, in a clear stratigraphie relationship - above the destruction of Stratum 10A and below the fills and supporting walls of Strata 8-7, of the Hellenistic period. The supporting walls and layers of fill of this stratum were discovered in Areas El and G. Gravel dumps - waste from a quarry, apparently at the top of Area D 1, which served in this period for the reconstruction of the city (and of the Temple Mount ?) - and the supporting walls of this debris, were found in Areas D 1 and D2. It is presently impossible to define more precisely the nature of this stratum, located on the eastern slope of the City of David, outside the new line of fortifications - which in the accepted opinion, was built in this period on the bedrock at the top of the eastern slope.141 Strata 8-7 (Fig. 10): During the Hellenistic period, certainly during the 4th-3rd centuries BCE, the hill of the City of David and the Temple Mount at its head, comprised the most important part of the city. During the course of Stratum 7, Jerusalem became the capital of the Hasmonean kingdom, and the urban centre shifted to the Western Hill - the "Upper City". The hill of the City of David was now the main part of the "Lower City" of Jerusalem. More than 350 handles of Hellenistic amphorae, bearing Rhodian seal-impressions, were found in our excavations, in addition to the hundreds of similar handles found in earlier excavations in the City of David, by Macalister, Crowfoot and Kenyon.142 Such 29</page><page sequence="40">a large quantity is especially outstanding in the light of the sparsity of such finds in the widespread excavations adjacent to the Temple Mount and in the "Upper City"143 - in excavations in the Jewish and Armenian Quarters and in the Jerusalem Citadel near Jaffa Gate.144 This statistical datum provides further evidence for the main concentration of the Hellenistic settlement in Jerusalem in the region of the City of David, at least up to the outbreak of the Hasmonean Revolt. In Area H, at the foot of Mount Zion, outside the City of David, we discovered a part of a building in Stratum 7, built on the bed- rock - evidence of the spread of the city west- ward - toward the "Upper City" - already in this phase.145 The bulk of the architectural finds of the Hellenistic period came to light in Stratum 7B. We assume that they are to be ascribed to the building activities of the Hasmoneans on the eastern slope and at its top, mainly in connection with the construction of the "First Wall", at the end of the 2nd century BCE. Segments of this city-wall were uncovered in the City of David by Clermont- Ganneau, Guthe, Macalister, Crowfoot, Weill and Kenyon (Fig. 3).146 In Areas Al and Dl, our expedition encountered further segments of this wall. In parallel to this activity at the top of the slope, a series of supporting walls and levelled terraces was built at the middle of the eastern slope. Parts of this system were uncovered in our Areas D and E. The backbone of the system was, the Canaanite-Israelite city-wall, on top of which, for its entire length, a narrow wall was built in Stratum 7B. Above and below this line, further walls were built partly utilizing Iron Age walls and structures, especially on the upper half of the slope. In Area G, quite different activities were taking place. There, the line of the "First Wall" and its towers integrated the top of the stepped stone structure, and possibly even parts of Nehemiah's wall. In order to secure the base of this fortification system - which in part, such as the square tower, was built over the Iron Age ruins of Stratum 10A, and the layers of fill of Stratum 9 - a thick glacis of earth and gravel was laid down here, sealing the surface of the slope and the remains on it. The builders were aided by short supporting walls built within the fill in order to stabilize it. This glacis seems to have entirely sealed the base of the fortifications and covered up most of the stepped structure, which still stood to a considerable height. Strata 6-5 : The line of fortifications and the supporting walls on the slope continued to serve the "Lower City" down till the end of the Great Revolt against the Romans in 70 CE. In Area E3, two massive supporting walls were added, to support a levelled terrace above them. In Area A 1 the impressive supporting walls of the fortifications were bolstered, as were the damming-walls at the mouth of the Central Valley where they meet at the southern end of the City of David. Hundreds of vessels thrown out here, outside the city, enriched our collection with a varied corpus of pottery, Jerusalem stoneware and coins of this period. In Area H, a well-built building fragment of the 1st century CE was cleared, and it was found to include three structures with a street between them. In this region, adjacent to the Siloam Pool, there was much evidence in the City of David of the harsh destruction of 70 CE, finding expression in the total ruin and conflagration of these structures. These finds comprise impressive archaeological confirma- tion of Josephus's description of the destruction of the "Lower City" and the vicinity of the Siloam Pool after the capture and burning of the Temple to the north.147 With the destruction of Jerusalem, at the end of Stratum 6, the hill of the City of David was neglected. The structures of the "Lower City" on its ridge, and the supporting walls on its slopes, collapsed and tumbled down. The eastern slope for its entire length became covered with a layer of debris several metres thick. This debris included many finds from Stratum 6, carried down from the buildings at the top of the slope. They have been defined by us as a separate stratum, Stratum 5, which also contains almost nothing later than 70 CE. Stratum 3 : Evidence of structures of the Byzantine period was found in our excavations only in the region of the Central Valley. Some pottery was discovered in the upper levels in area Al and in the upper debris in Area G. Thick supporting walls, and possibly also a part of the southern fortifications of the City of David above the Siloam Pool, were found in Area A2. The corner of an impressively large structure, with massive walls, was discovered in Area H. In the poorer buildings abutting this main structure, two phases of this stratum were discerned. Though the fortifications of the City of David in Stratum 3 was not a subject of investigation in our excavations, it is reasonable to assume that the line 30</page><page sequence="41">of the "First Wall" of Strata 7-6 in the City of David was again utilized by "Eudócia' s Wall" of the 5th century CE. The main building activity in this period, as shown in the excavations of Crowfoot148 and Mazar,149 was in the upper parts of the Central Valley and at the top of the hill of the City of David, south of the Temple Mount. Strata 2-1 : The only activity relating to the Early Arab period, mainly to the Ayyubid period in Jerusalem, came to light in Area Al, at a spot where, close to the surface, above earlier remains, several walls and a stone pavement were built, connected with the use of the water installations in the region of the pools and the outlet of the tunnel. These remains served the inhabitants of the medieval quarter excavated by Crowfoot higher up the Central Valley.150 31</page><page sequence="42">NOTES 1. For brief reports on the City of David, see Shiloh, 1979a, 1980a, 1981a, 1981b. 2. These area estimates are very generalized, not taking into account the gradient typifying the eastern slope of the City of David. The estimate of the area of the Temple Mount in First Temple times is made solely on the basis of the assumed topography of that site. 3. All the excavations are being conducted in block 30125, parcels 7, 50, 52-55 and 61. The expedition has assisted the Jerusalem Municipality, where needed, in checking the public lands prior to development activities, as in the case of the paving of roads and construction of terrace walls and drainage channels. We must express our gratitude for the cooperation of the heads of the various municipal departments, such as Eli Sagui, Ninette Abramowitz and Menahem Darwish, and to the Mayor, Teddy Kollek. 4. For an outline of the major findings of the previous excavators, see Simons, 1952; Kenyon, 1974, pp. 1-35; Y. Shiloh, "Past and Present in Archaeological Research in the City of David", in H. Shanks, ed., Recent Archaeology in the Land of Israel , Washington, 1984, pp. 149-157. 5. Study of the data and a comparative analysis of the strata in all the areas is still in progress. Thus, we have compiled Table 1 provisorily, especially for the present publication. The enumeration of the strata, using Arabic numerals, is also provisory, till final determination of the stratigraphic- chronological system. 6. We present the architectural finds from the various areas in plans of several types, some detailed and some schematic, in accord with the needs of this interim publication. Technical and surveying problems evolving from the distance from one area to the next, and the gradient of the slopes, have forced us initially to use several grids and points of reference for heights. The final publication will present these in a uniform manner, and various minor changes may very well occur in some of the absolute heights appearing in some of the plans. These changes will have no effect on the relative heights within each individual area. 7. Bliss, 1898, pp. 83-131. 8. Cf. Kenyon's similar description of the numerous tunnels of "B and D": Kenyon, 1974, p. 22. 9. Weill, 1947. 10. See below, pp. 22-23. 1 1. The numeration of the channels used here is that of Weill, 1947. 12. Of the huge accumulation of sherds here, estimated at many hundreds of kilograms, several tens of vessels could be restored partially or fully. Of the other vessels, all typifying sherds were collected. On the basis of the number of handles, an estimate could be reached - which, in our opinion, is quite low - of the number of vessels which accumulated during the 1st century BCE in these refuse dumps. 13. The Islamic material in Area Al has been studied by Mahmoud Hawari. Besides the two Ayyubid coins, identified by Ariel Berman, there were two ornamented oil- lamps (Reg. Nos. A.44 and A.128) of the 12th-13th centuries CE. 14. Shiloh, 1980a, p. 16. The flute has been studied by Dr. Batya Bayer, "The Finds That Could Not Be," BAR 8/1 (1982), pp. 26-27, 36-37. 15. Cf. Weül, 1947, Pl. I. 16. The lack of any Strata 4-2 finds on the eastern slope must be emphasized. A sparse representation of strata 3-2, and an even slighter representation of stratum 4, are found at the lower end of the Central Valley, in Areas Al, A2 and H. The sparse material from Stratum 4 in Area H had been carried down from the slopes of the "Upper City" - modern Mount Zion. 17. Bliss, 1898, pp. 178-210. 18.

Ťhe stone-paved area abutting the city-wall continues southward parallel to the wall. They both must terminate some 8 m. farther south, where they would meet with the 32</page><page sequence="43">rock scarp in Square G 4, in Area Dl. This area is being investigated in the 1983 season. 33. See above, pp. 7-8; and below, p. 29. 34. See above, p. 8. 35. See below, pp. 11-12. 36. For the nature of W.201, see below, p. 15. 37. Ibid. 38. See below, pp. 12-14. 39. In Area E3, for the meantime we present the series of walls of Strata 12-10 as a single unit. These strata in Area E3 were excavated only in the 1982 season, and their stratigraphic-ceramic interpretation has not been completed. 40. See below, p. 18. 41. In Area El, in practice, we applied a technique appearing to us as the most suited to such a difficult slope as the eastern one here. We are clearing here continuous sectional trenches which are divided into squares of 5 X 5 m., from the top of the slope down to midway, till the city-wall. These , trenches, which together form an extensive unit, complement one another as far as stratigraphie- architectural data are concerned. From our accumulated experience, we have learned that conclusions drawn from a single square or section are partial and inexact. 42. Similar to Kenyon's conclusions (Kenyon, 1974, pp. 81-84). 43. A similar situation was found by Kenyon in her "Section A", below our Area G, as we were able to see in her photo archive at the Institute of Archaeology, University of London. 44. For the tie between this complex of structures and the one adjacent to the south, in Area E2, see above, p. 10. 45. Analysis of the pottery from Strata 12-10 in Area El, and its preparation for publication, is being undertaken by Alon de Groot. 46. This rule was not always kept. In several instances, where the rock surface was higher than its surroundings, it served all the phases. 47. Y.

The subdivision of Stratum 10 into two phases, 10B and 10C, was based solely on the situation in Area G. In Area E no such subdivision of this stratum could be discerned. 50. In the preliminary analysis, it appeared that the fragment of ornamented ivory might have been from a Stratum 8 fill; for further details, see Shiloh, 1980a, pp. 12-13. 51. Shiloh, 1979a, p. 170. The inscription is presently on display at the Israel Museum. 52. Macalister, 1926; Crowfoot, 1929; Kenyon, 1974. 53. Besides the archaeological activities here, there have been building activities as well - preservation and reconstruction work by the mandatory Department of Antiquities. These latter were not properly recorded, however, and thus must be taken into account when analysing the remains extant in Area G at the start of the present excavations. 54. Kenyon, 1974, Pis. 27-28, 31-32. Our schematic Fig. 18 was completed on the south by means of these photos. 55. It should be remembered that these measurements are minimal, in accord with the present stage of excavations, and are not the complete dimensions of the entire building, which has not yet been revealed down to its foundations. 56.

The last previous excavator, Kathleen Kenyon, also hesitated to define clearly a more precise date here than the 14th- 13th centuries (see above, n. 56), because of the sparsity of pottery. 59. On the basis of our predecessors' reports, it is impossible to know whether indeed this was the original condition of the top of the stepped structure. We hope to extend our excavations and the clearing of the top of this structure during 1983, and then, possibly, further facts may come to light. 60. Macalister, 1926, Fig. 47, Plan facing p. 49. The reader must be warned that the addition to the corner of Tower 310, as seen in Kenyon's photograph (Kenyon, 1974, Pis. 18, 81) was not part of the stepped structure, as suggested also by Kenyon, but rather a late addition, apparently part of modern attempts by the Department of Antiquities to strengthen the structure. 61.

The stone bearing the inscription, which was slightly better dressed than the other stones, may have been fixed in one of the walls of the structure. 74. And see a similar installation in Area E3. A similar stone can be seen in Kenyon's photographs, which show the debris of the Israelite building in Square A XXIV, northeast of Area G. Cf. K.M. Kenyon, "Excavations in Jeruslem, 1966", PEQ 99 (1967), Pl. XIIIB. We wish to thank Mr. Dorrell of the Institute of Archaeology of the University of London, for permission to see Kenyon's photo archive. A close-up of this detail seems to show that this stone installation is identical in workmanship (and function) to the two installations in Areas G and E3. Thus, this is evidence of a third privy (?) of this type in the City of David from the Iron Age 1 1. 75. See below, p. 29. 76. The stone weights are being prepared for publication by A. Eran. 77.

Examination and identification of the carbonized wood is being carried out by A. Fahn of the Hebrew University in Jerusalem. It appears that some items are of local Pistacia atlantica.

Several parts of the system have not been examined completely, and thus there may still occur certain minor changes in some of the measurements given here. 97. An up-to-date discussion of the Iron Age water systems can be found in Y. Shiloh, "Underground Water Systems in the Iron Age in Eretz-Israel", in Archaeology and Biblical Interpretation (Glenn Rose Memorial Volume), Phillips University, Oklahoma (in press). 98. And see the various opinions in the literature cited above, n. 91. For an initial attempt to present the possibility that some of the elements of the water system are natural clefts, see A. Issar, IEJ 26 (1976), pp. 131-133. But some of these definitions, and mainly the conclusions concerning Warren's Shaft and the so-called "Trial Shaft" (at the top of the stepped tunnel of Warren's Shaft) have been negated by the results of the hydrogeological survey of the City of David expedition (see above, n. 95). 99. Kenyon, 1974, pp. 144-151. 100. Though this gate, in the light of its location at the top of the slope, may be from Second Temple times; Cf. Vincent, 1911, p. 29, Pl. VI. 101.

In the description of the capture of the City of Jebus in 1 Chronicles 11, no. mention is made for the sinnor , already in antiquity the difficulty of substantiating this was felt. 111. W.F. Albright, JPOS 2 (1922), pp. 286-290; Mazar, 1975, pp. 168-169; Y. Yadin, The Art of Warfare in Biblical Lands , New York, 1963, pp. 267-270; Y. Aharoni, The Archaeology of the Land of Israel , Philadelphia, 1982, pp. 234-235; and see the extensive bibliography in J. Braslavi, Beth Miqra' 14/39 (1970), pp. 3-16 (Hebrew). 112. And see Shiloh, above, n. 97. 113. This suits the excavations results in the Jewish Quarter (above, n. 104), but is in contrast with the various opinions noted above, n. 105. It is difficult to assume that Hezekiah's Tunnel would have been executed only in order to bring water to a new reservoir, which in that opinion, too, was located outside the new line of city defences. 114. The connection between the parts of these systems from Second Temple times and the line of the "First Wall" of that same period and located at the top of the eastern slope, 34</page><page sequence="45">is still not clear. There is no certitude that there had even existed such a connection, which might, however, be supported with the assistance of the gate discovered by Parker (see above, n. 100). 115. The conditions appeared so difficult that Simons rejected all possibility of finding an orderly stratigraphy on the hill: "For this reason the possibility must be ruled out of ever establishing a stratigraphie sequence of occupations and cultures on this hill, otherwise than by the hazardous combination of scattered finds, each representing at its own place one or more periods" (Simons, 1952, p. 73). 116. This rule should enable us to understand why some of Kenyon's significant conclusions concerning the dating of several of the important buildings in the City of David and adjacent to the Temple Mount, as well as her general concept of the limits of the settled area of the city in First and Second Temple times, have recently been proved mistaken. In the light of her successful experience at Jericho, she built part of her conclusions concerning Jerusalem on the basis of minor and limited sectional trenches, assuming that they truly reflected not only the relative stratigraphical sequence on the site, but even the absolute stratigraphy of the hill at those spots. And see also above, n. 41; and Avigad's conclusions, successfully dealing with these matters (Avigad, 1980, p. 30). 117. A. Ben Tor, "The Plans of the Dwellings and Temples of the Early Bronze Age in Eretz-Israel", Eretz-Israel 11 (1973), pp. 92-98 (Hebrew). 1 18. See, e.g., Vincent, 1911, Pis. VII-XII. 1 19. This is based on sherds of this period found in a foundation trench on the inner side of the wall (Kenyon, 1974, p. 83). 120. The early phase of the Middle Bronze Age II material at the base of Kenyon's sectional trench A is built slightly forward and below the later, Iron Age II line of fortifications. In Kenyon's opinion, which seems reasonable, this divergence came about because of the tower for the "Water Gate", which must have existed at this spot, above the Gihon spring. See ibid., p. 83. 121.

Most of this area had been excavated by Macalister, but his reports on the finds there contribute nothing to our understanding of this problem. See Macalister, 1926. 124. Y. Shiloh, "Iron Age Sanctuaries and Cult Elements in • •Palestine", in F.M. Cross Jr., ed., Symposia , Cambridge (Mass.), 1979, pp. 149-152. 125. Kenyon, 1974, p. 103, Pis. 33-34. 126.

Kenyon, 1974, pp. 144-147. 132. The fact that no other line of fortifications, of any period, was found in the sectional trenches outside and below the existing line, in Areas B, D1 and E2, bolsters this conclusion. 133. For the meanwhile there is no physical possibility of linking the excavations within the City of David proper with the Temple Mount and its vicinity. At the south-eastern corner of his excavations, Mazar discovered the remains of an extensive Israelite house which flourished up to the eve of the destruction of the city, in parallel to our Stratum 10; and see M. Ben-Dov, The Dig at the Temple Mount , Jerusalem, 1982, pp. 45-55 (Hebrew). 134. Avigad, 1980, pp. 59, 70-71. 135. Josephus Flavius, Wars V, 4, 2. 136. Shiloh, above, p. 00; Avigad, 1980, p. 60. 137.

The large quantity of these handles has enabled a well-based chronological- statistical sampling concerning the ties between Judea and Rhodes and neighbouring centres in the 3rd-2nd centuries BCE, and concerning the influence of the decline of these ties upon the Hasmonean Revolt. 145. This find, along with the finds from the Jewish Quarter Excavations, bolsters the prevalent opinion concerning the spread of settlement from the City of David to the "Western Hill" during the Hasmonean period (Avigad, 1980, pp. 72-75). 146.
