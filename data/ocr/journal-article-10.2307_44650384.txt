ABSTRACT The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)'s analysis of commuter aircraft accidents and ongoing research has indicated that the crashworthiness capabilities of smaller aircraft may be questionable. The small size of these aircraft results in a stiff structure and consequently higher impact loads experienced by the occupants. In 1993, the FAA issued a Notice of Proposed Rule Making (NPRM) 93-71 to increase the deceleration pulse amplitude of the sled tests under the Test-1 conditions (60-degree test) to 32G for the commuter type aircraft. To meet this condition, the seat design must exploit the energy absorption potential for its structural components. Energy absorbing components may include the seat legs, seat pan, and seat cushion. The intent is to design the seat so that it strikes well beyond the elastic limit to absorb the energy of the impact. To date, no seat has yet been able to pass the proposed criteria with an acceptable limit on the lumbar load (1500 pounds). At the National Institute for Aviation Research (NIAR), alternative seat legs have been designed and analyzed to meet the 32G requirement. Two types of energy absorbing seat legs, S-shape and Y-shape seat legs, are presented in this paper. Nonlinear finite element models for the seat legs were first constructed using the MARC code to study the effect of static loading on the seat leg designs. The MADYMO code was then utilized to model the Hybrid II anthropomorphic test dummy (ATD), restraint system (lap belt), seat back, seat pan, and seat legs (finite element model). The alternative energy absorbing seat leg designs resulted in the peak lumbar load of 1300 and 1370 pounds respectively for the S-shape and the Y- shape seat legs as compared to 1 850 pounds obtained for a straight leg seat design. In order to consider the response of a wide range of occupants seated on these new designs, a small 5th percentile female ATD and a large 95th percentile male ATD were also studied. The resulting lumbar loads from the crash analysis showed that the peak lumbar load decreased for the small subject and increased for the large subject, yet all fell below the 1 500 pounds for the S-shape seat leg design, although no definitive injury criteria yet exists for the limit lumbar loads on different size ATD's. The analysis has shown that the energy-absorbing seat leg designs could reduce the lumbar load as mush as 40 percent compared to the seats with straight legs. Further research in this area is necessary in analyzing the stability of these structures as they undergo large plastic deformations. Further sled and drop tests also need to be conducted on these alternative energy-absorbing seat leg designs to support the analytical results. INTRODUCTION In 1993, the Federal Aviation Administration issued a Notice of Proposed Rule Making ("NPRM"), which would increase the peak value of the sled deceleration pulse from 15 g's to 32 G's for Part-23 commuter aircraft [1]. No commuter seat has yet been able to meet this criteria under the Test-1 configuration shown in Figure 1 with an accepted limit on the lumbar load of 1500 pounds. The proposed test condition results in the most severe spinal injury among all other vertical tests due to the very high amplitude of the deceleration pulse (see Figure 2). This paper aims to determine whether a proposed 32 G seat can be designed that complies with the requirement. Two types of crashworthy seat legs were designed and analyzed. The seat leg structures were designed to experience plastic deformation under a small amount of stroke to minimize spring-back effect. The non-linear finite element code MARC was used to determine the loading behavior of the seat legs. A crash victim simulation code MADYMO was used to model the seat legs, seat pan, seat back, lap belt, and the occupant. In order to consider the response of a wide range of occupant sizes on the designed seat, the seat legs were then analyzed for three sizes of occupants including the 5h percentile female, 50lh percentile male, and 95th percentile male anthropomorphic dummies (ATD's). 97</page><page sequence="2">impact ļ direction ^ J~ ^ / ' Peak tcct h / ' acceleration 60* tcct h 1 ^ ļ I- - time range - -I Figure 1 : Test-1 configuration and corresponding pulse. 35 - - Ą - - - PART 23 with proposed 32 Q 30 / ' PART 23 (passenger) with 15 Q / ' PART 25 with 14 G 25-- , x / ' 2° , N / ' 15 ' V 1° / 0 0.02 0.04 0.06 0.08 0.1 0.12 0.14 0.16 Figure 2 : Sled deceleration pulses for FAR Test-1 condition [2,3]. SEAT LEG DESIGNS The seat elements which could be exploited for energy absorption in order to improve the crashworthiness properties of the seat include the seat pan, the seat cushion, and the seat legs. This paper focuses on the aircraft crashworthy seat leg since the seat legs provide the easiest and largest form of energy absorption. Among the selected seat legs are S-shaped seat legs and Y-shaped seat legs. The seat leg structures were designed to experience plastic deformation under a small amount of stroke to minimize the spring-back effect. Seat legs were analyzed with a finite element analysis (FEA) code MARC to examine the correlation of seat leg's loading behavior and the lumbar load. Figure 3 : S-shaped seat legs. Dynamic analysis Iterations of the designs were carried for a standard 50th percentile Hybrid II male ATD until the lumbar load fell below the tolerance limit of 1 ,500 pounds. The S-shaped seat leg design has four identical S-shaped Al 2024-T351 seat legs (see Figure 3). Each of the S-shaped seat legs has two rotational joints (or pin joints) at both of its ends to avoid bend-over fracture during impact. A diagonal linkage is modeled for the purpose of holding the seat legs in position and guiding a circular motion during seat legs deformation. In order to distribute impact energy equally to all four seat legs, pre- simulations have been done by repositioning the seat back-and-forth. A final seat position was found in which the seat could maintain a constant level of deformation. Once an appropriate seat position was determined, "fine- tune" process began to find an appropriate seat leg stiffness. Figure 4 : Analytical setup for S-shape seat leg. Figure 4 shows an illustration of the S-shaped seat leg design generated by MADYMO code. The S- shaped seat designed provides a maximum stroke of 7 inches in the vertical direction before the seat pan and the floor come in contact. 98</page><page sequence="3">Figure 5 : Y-shaped seat leg design. Another design of the seat leg is the Y-shaped seat leg (see Figure 5). The Y-shaped seat leg has two sections. The upper section is an u-shaped structure formed from Al 2024-T351 sheet. The edges of upper seat leg section are welded to the seat pan structure. The bottom section of the seat leg is a rigid I-beam. During impact, the U-shaped seat leg is capable of deforming as much as 5 inches from the vertical stroke before the seat pan structure makes contact with the I- beam structure. Figure 6 shows an illustration of the Y- shaped seat leg design generated by MADYMO. The seat leg structure as appeared in CAD drawing are coincided with the seat leg position in MADYMO drawing. Figure 6 : Superimposed view of the Y-shaped seat design. OCCUPANT MODELS Three type of ATD models were used for the analysis including the £&gt;h percentile female, the 50th percentile male, and the 95m percentile male, as shown in Figure 7. The weights and heights of these ATD models are tabulated in Table 1 . Figure 7 : Three types of ATD's. Table 1 : Specifications for the ATD's. ATD Model Weight Height 5,h %tile Female 1 08 Pounds 5 Feet 50lh %tile Male 163 Pounds 5 Feet 9 Inches Oó"1 %tile Male 227 Pounds 6 Feet 2 Inches Human with different size and strength of lumbar vertebrae will have different limit towards lumbar injury. The lumbar load injury criteria for a standard 5(f percentile male ATD is 1500 pounds. No specific lumbar load criteria has yet been defined for other occupant sizes. Scaling factor based on the size and the stiffness of the spine can be applied to scale the lumbar load injury criteria for different sizes of ATD's. Lumbar load tolerance limit for the 5th percentile female ATD and the 95th percentile male ATD can be approximated based on the sizes of the ATD [4], According to this method, the lumbar vertebrae for all sizes of occupants is assumed to be geometrically similar and the lumbar load tolerance limits based on the scaling method are shown in Table 2.

During deformation, localized plastic strains propagates from the curvatures sections to the neighboring areas. These seat legs require only a small amount of load to deform the seat legs, yet they could maintain a stable stiffness behavior. Load-deflection curves for these seat legs are shown in Figures 10 and 11. Figure 8 : Deformation pattern of a S-shaped seat leg.

Three types of seat legs were analyzed based on the FAA's proposed 32 G. They were straight leg, S- shaped seat leg and Y-shaped seat leg. Straight seat legs Lumbar load for the straight leg seat found in the 5th percentile female, the 50th percentile male and the 95lh percentile male ATD's all exceeded their injury limits by more than 450 pounds. S-shaped seat legs Designs iterations were carried out to find a suitable thickness of S-shaped seat legs that passed the proposed 32 G vertical test condition. A soft seat leg would easily "bend-over", which results both of its ends to meet together. In such a case, the seat pan stops immediately and results in a high impact load. A stiff leg on the other hand, will result in high lumbar load due to little amount of stroke. Figure 12 shows three lumbar load history curves of a 50th percentile male ATD based on three seat legs. Straight leg design resulted in the highest value of lumbar load among the seat leg designs. The S-shaped seat leg designs with 0.12 inches thickness of the legs resulted in a higher lumbar load value than the S-shaped seat leg with 0.10 inches. 100</page><page sequence="5">Figure 12 : Lumbar load history curves for 5tfh percentile male ATD. Improved S-shaped Seat Legs - S-shaped seat leg with constant sectional thickness tends to show different performance for different size of occupants. An S-shaped seat leg with two thickness sections was developed to alleviate the problem of weight differences. This type of S-shaped seat leg has a soft structure at the upper section and a stiff structure at the lower section. During impact, a small occupant will benefit energy- absorbing from upper section of the seat leg and a large occupant will benefit energy-absorption from both section of the S-shaped seat leg. Figurei 3 shows the lumbar load history curves for the 5th percentile female, the 50th percentile male and the 95,h percentile male on the S- shaped seat leg design with two section thickness. The 50th percentile male and the 95th percentile male show two peaks in their lumbar load history curves. The first peak in the lumbar load occurs when the upper section of the seat leg deforms. The second peak is resulted from the deformation of the second section of the seat leg. Figure 14 shows the dynamic response of the 5(f percentile male ATD on the S-shaped seat leg design with two thickness section. Figure 13 : Lumbar load history curves for three ATD's on S-shaped seat leg with two thickness sections. Figure 14 : Simulation result for 50,h percentile male ATD on S-shaped seat leg design with two thickness sections. Y-shaped seat leg Y-shaped seat leg has a different design configuration from S-shaped seat leg. Seat stability can be altered by changing the thickness of the front and the rear section of Y-shaped seat legs. The wall thickness for the first analysis was a constant 0.05 inches and the second design was a combination of 0.07 inches at the front section and 0.05 inches at the rear section. During impact, the seat with constant thickness (0.05 inches) tilted to the front and made contact with the lower section of the seat leg structure (I-beams), which resulted in a sudden stop to the seat pan displacement. In such a case, the Y-shaped seat leg design with constant leg thickness was not utilized because the rear portion of the seat leg was not deformed during impact. In the second Y-shaped seat leg design, the seat pan was able to remain at a constant level throughout the impact duration due to the fact that stiffer frontal structure. Figure 15 shows the lumbar load history curves for the 50th percentile male on the Y-shaped seat leg designs with 0.05 inches and combination of 0.05 and 0.07 inches. Analytical results show that Y-shaped seat leg design with combination thickness was able to keep the lumbar load of a 50,h percentile male below 1 ,500 pounds. However, the Y-shaped seat leg design does not provided as much energy-absorbing as the S- shaped seat leg. 101</page><page sequence="6">Figure 15 : Lumbar load history for the 50th percentile male ATD on the Y-shaped seat leg design with constant and variable wall thickness. Better performaning Y-shaped seat leg was also analyzed on the 5th percentile female and the 95th percentile male ATD's. The analytical results show that this seat legs were too soft for the 95th percentile male ATD. Figurei 6 shows that the seat pan had made multiple contacts with the lower seat leg structure. This gave the lumbar load history curve multiple peaks. The highest peak for the 95,h percentile male ATD was a lumbar load of 1929 pounds. The lumbar load for 9Öh percentile male ATD exceeded the tolerance limit. However, the lumbar load result still shows an improvement of 1 1 % compared to the straight seat leg. The lumbar load for the 5,h percentile female did not meet its tolerance limit. Figure 16 :Lumbar load history for three of the ATD's on Y-shaped seat leg with variable wall thickness. SUMMARY OF THE RESULTS AND DESIGN RECOMMENDATIONS elastic deformation ļ ( plastic deformation ( deflection Figure 17 : Load-deflection curve for the crashworthy seat legs design. load constant stiffness deflection Figure 18 : Load-deflection curve for the ideal seat legs design. In general, there are two peaks that occurred in the lumbar load history for both crashworthy seat leg designs. The first peak in lumbar load occurred during the initial deformation, when the stiffness of the seat legs reached a maximum at point B in Figure 17. Once the deformation exceeds point B, major plastic deformation has occurred. Down sloping stiffness promotes deformation as the loading continue, and sometimes results in the seat legs reaching their limit of deformation. A sudden stop in the seat displacement results in a second lumbar load peak. An ideal energy- absorbing seat leg would be able to begin plastic deformation for a small amount of stroke and would able to maintain a zero stiffness for further deformation (see Figure 18). In the case when there is a limited amount of stroke available, the seat leg with increasing stiffness (in the plastic region) is considered to be better to avoid "bend-over" effect. This explains why the S-shaped seat leg with two thickness sections performed better that the S-shaped leg with constant thickness. Based on the analytical results, the minimum amount of distance required by the lower torso of a 50th percentile male to travel is at 6 inches, and for 9E&gt;h percentile male is at 9 inches. Analytical results for the 5h percentile female occupant was not conclusive because the lumbar load result exceeded its tolerance limit of 1 ,1 10 pounds. 102</page><page sequence="7">Figure 19 summarized all the lumbar load results for the analysis conducted. Figure 19 : Summary of the analytical results on lumbar load. The analytic results show that the S-shaped seat leg performs better that the Y-shaped seat leg. However, the Y-shaped seat leg can be developed further to improve its performance. For example, one could vary the thickness of the seat leg, or increase the radius of the Y-shaped seat leg to improve the stiffness of the seat leg and the amount of crush distance. The Y- shaped seat leg with a uniform thickness did not perform as well as the S-shaped structure. This was because the Y-shaped seat leg has less crash distance than the S- shaped seat leg, and because the loading behavior of the Y-shaped seat leg was not as good as the S-shaped seat leg with two different thickness sections. One could develop the Y-shaped seat leg further by stiffening the structure along the center to distribute the plastic deformation to the side and by increasing the radius of the upper section of Y-shaped seat leg. A Y-shaped seat leg model with the modified thickness is shown in Figure 20. The load-deflection curve for the modified thickness Y-shaped seat leg shows improvement over the constant thickness seat leg (see Figure 21). The radius of the Y- shaped seat leg is one other factor that could change the stiffness and the plastic deformation pattern. Three Y- shaped seat legs with different radii but with similar constant thickness were modeled using the non-linear finite element code under static loading. Figure 22 shows the seat leg with larger radius has a higher stiffness in the plastic region compared to the seat leg with smaller radius.

The performance of a seat leg design can be further improved by increasing the stroke. Figure 23 shows a different seat leg design which utilized Y-shaped seat leg design. However, further tests on the seat leg thickness have to be done to optimize the seat leg design. This type of seat leg design is expected to perform better than either the Y-shaped seat leg design or the S-shaped seat leg design under the FAR horizontal test (Test 2 condition), because the seat is able to undergo large plastic deformation in the longitudinal direction as well. Figure 23 : Suggested crashworthy seat leg design. Computer simulations have shown the improved crashworthy performance of the these seat designs. Further study and testing concerning stability of these designs are needed before they are could be used. CONCLUSION This paper attempted to explore alternative designs of energy absorbing seat legs in order to meet the 32G proposed requirement for the commuter aircraft seats. Analytic studies including non-linear finite element analysis MARC and occupant models of MADYMO showed that practical seat can be designed which could keep the lumbar load of the 50,h percentile male below 1500 pounds under the FAR proposed 32 G test conditions for commuter aricraft. Studies of the 5th percentile female and the 95lh percentile male indicate that allowable lumbar load decreases for the smaller (£&gt;h percentile) subject, and increases for the larger (9£&gt;h percentile) subject. Dynamic analysis of 5h percentile and 95th percentile subjects with a seat designed for the 50th percentile show that the 5,h percentile lumbar load exceeds the allowable. For the 95h percentile subject, the lumbar load is below the allowable threshold. This study showed that energy-absorbing seat legs could reduce the lumbar load as much as 40% compared to straight legs. Also, the S-shaped seat legs perform better under the dynamic test condition than Y-shaped seat legs. However, the Y-shaped seat leg design can further be improved. It is recommended that additional design studies be conducted to develop a single design which will accommodate 5th, 50lh and 95th percentile subjects without exceeding the allowable lumbar load. Side effects such as occupant legs impacting the seat pan in front of the occupant require further study. Impact sled tests and cost studies should also be conducted to further evaluate the design concepts proposed here. REFERENCES [1] Hooper, S. J., Holmes, M.
