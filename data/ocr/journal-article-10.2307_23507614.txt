<plain_text><page sequence="1">Moses Ibn Ezra and Judah Halevi: Their Philosophies in Response to Exile* JAN D. KATZEW Port Washington, N.Y. The writings of Moses Ibn Ezra and Judah Halevi epitomize the literary achievements attained by Jews in the medieval period. Both men lived in Spain at the turn of the twelfth century, though Ibn Ezra and Halevi differed on essential issues that faced Medieval Spanish Jewry. Both lived in exile. It is the character of their perceptions of exile that receives treatment in this essay. A crucial issue on which these two masterful poets diverged was the doc trine of Arabiyya, or Arab superiority. Halevi's yearning for Zion stood in con tradistinction to Ibn Ezra's profound appreciation of Arabic culture. Their thoughts on exile were inextricably bound up with their philosophical approaches in general and with their attitudes toward the land of Israel in particular. Whatever sense of exile from the land of Israel Ibn Ezra possessed was connected to the eschaton, whereas Halevi demonstrated, by word and deed, the immediacy of his longing for a return to his "home" in the land of milk and honey. Nevertheless, Moses Ibn Ezra and Judah Halevi represented two foci of a debate that has yet to be resolved. Neither Moses Ibn Ezra nor Judah Halevi was a philosopher.1 Ibn Ezra's Dr. Ezra Spicehandler provided immense assistance in the composition of this (*) essay. I am very grateful to Dr. Martin Rozenberg who kindly read the manuscript and offered constructive suggestions which I sought to incorporate into its final form, (t) That Halevi was not a philosopher needs amplification because he does both com bat and advance philosophical concepts in the Kuzari. That fact notwithstanding, the fol "סידאט, קולס. הגות־הפילוסופית כימי הביניים, כתר, ירושלים 1975 .lowing sources substantiate this claim השם ,עזרא לדת המושפלת' מתאים ליצירה זו, שהיתה, ועודנה גם היום, אחת היצירות התשובות ביותר של התיאולוגיה והאפולוגטיקה היהודית. אמרנו תיאולוגיה, ולא פילוסופיה, שכן יהודה הלוי נלחם בפילוסופיה ומנסה להראות מה מוגבל היקפו של הניסיון הפילוסופי. האמנם מותר לומר, כי הוא רצה להרוס את הפילוסופיהז להלן נראה, כי ". ..יהודה הלוי דחה את השיטה האריספוטלית Guttmann,Guttmann, Julius, Philosophies of Judaism, Schocken Books, New York, 1976, pp. 136 ff. "The singular figure of Judah Halevi belongs to no philosophic school. Only the fact that strands of his thought link him with the Neoplatonic tradition justify discussing him in this context. Basic to Halevi's own teaching is his criticism of philosophic knowledge of mathematics and logic, and the pseudo-knowledge of philosophers. He denies the possibil ity of rational certainty in the metaphysical sphere. . . . The precise determination of the relationship between God and the world is beyond philosophic knowledge. . . . "The yearning for communion with God is innate in man, and all men strive to attain it. Philosophy does, in its own way, what the various religions try to do. All of them seek to attain communion with God, but as long as they endeavor to discover the means thereto by 179</page><page sequence="2">180 JAN D. KATZEW [2] most enduring work was done in the discipline of poetics; Halevi reached the summit of Hebrew poetry. Nevertheless, both men had more than a casual interest in philosophy which manifested itself in other aspects of their lives. Halevi's Kuzari has been characterized as, in great part, "a frontal attack on philosophy."2 Ibn Ezra's foray into the field of philosophy has not stood up to the test of time.3 Although Halevi and Ibn Ezra may not have originated philosophical insights, their place ment in Jewish history forced them into a cultural context deeply affected by philosophical undercurrents. Halevi and Ibn Ezra did react to the prevailing philosophical climate that was dominated by the Arabs. Rather than focus on the Neoplatonism espoused by Ibn Ezra or on Halevi's anti-philosophical tract, we shall instead ask, "How did Halevi and Ibn Ezra respond to ArabiyyaT the doctrine that propagated Arab supremacy. When medieval Arabs conquered a territory they did more than arro gate the captured land to themselves. They aimed at imposing Islamic religious ideals, as well as cultural, moral, linguistic and literary values upon the conquered peoples. Included among the axioms that informed and justified the program of Arabiyya are the following:4 themselves, they can never get beyond the illusion of such a communion. Only a God-given revelation can show man how to reach his goal. Judah Halevi is enabled to place philosophy as mere knowledge of God, in fundamen tal opposition to religion, which is life with God." Husik, Isaac, A History of Medieval Jewish Philosophy, Atheneum, New York, 1976, p. 159. "Revelation alone can make us wise as to certain aspects of God's nature and as to cer tain details of human conduct; and in these philosophy must fail because as philosophy it has no revelation. With all due respect therefore to the philosophers, who are the most reliable guides in matters not conflicting with revelation, we must leave them if we wish to learn the truth concerning those matters in which they are incompetent to judge. What God is must be understood not by means of rational proofs, but by prophetic and spiritual insight." This leads me to conclude that Halevi was not a philosopher, but a Jew who perceived philosophy as limited and prophecy as superior to it. (2) Cf. Leo Strauss, Persecution and the Art of Writing, The Free Press (Glencoe; 1952), p. 98. "The book is devoted to the defense of the Jewish religion against its most important adversaries in general, and the philosophers in particular. Since it is directed against the philosophers, the Muslims, and so on, it is as impossible to call it a philosophic book, as it is to call it an Islamic book, provided one is not willing to use the term "philosophic" in a sense totally alien to the thought of the author, i.e., to transgress one of the most elemen tary rules of historical exactness." (3) Isaac Husik, op. cit., p. 184. All that is accessible of Moses Ibn Ezra's philosophical treatise is a Hebrew translation of extracts under the title ערוגת הבושם. "If we may judge the rest of the work by these Hebrew fragments, we should say that philosophy was not Ibn Ezra's forte."

The Arab peninsula is the best of all countries since it lies in the best clime, viz., the fourth; there being seven in all, it forms the fourth, and therefore is the most temperate. 2. The Arabs are the best of all nations, since the Arabian penin sula lies in the best clime. 3. The best of all Arab tribes is that of the Qurayish, since the Apos tie of God sprang from it. 4. The best individual among the Qurayish is Muhammad, the Apostle of God, he being the last and greatest of the prophets. 5. The best of all scriptures ever sent down from heaven is the Qur'ân.Qur'ân.Qui3an. 6. The best of all languages is the Arabic language, in which God spoke to His people. 7. The best poetry is Arabic poetry, in which the angels render praise to God in heaven. For a Jew to accept all these premises would have been blasphemous. But in Ibn Ezra's ספר העיונים והדיונים, some of them were tacitly or other wise supported. "The superiority of the Arabs comes to them on account of the nature of their climate, the air of their country and their exiguous water supply (which was believed to have had a salutary effect on the intellect).5" Ibn Ezra acknowledged more than the excellence of Arabic poetry and poetics. He assented to an essential tenet of Arabiyya, the ameliorative effect of the Arab climate on the Arab intellect. He went so far as to compare Tiberias with the Arabian peninsula. Even though the city of Tiberias is of the land of Syria, yet its air and its lake, from which gifted men drink, have a special virtue in regard to eloquent speech and polished, classical language and rhetoric.6 Subtly, Ibn Ezra portrayed the Jews as faithful imitators of Arab creativity. Judah Halevi also subscribed to the intimate relation of climate to intellect, and to prophecy as well. But he accorded ארץ ישראל center stage. (5) Ibid., p. 21. Cf. Halkin, ספר העיונים והדיונים על השירה העברית, p. 33• Halper, שירת ישראל p. 49. The text continues with a quotation attributed to Galen, "if you examine that matter you will usually find that there is a correlation between the physical characteristics of a people, their character and their customs on the one hand, and the nature of the country in which they live on the other."

KATZEW [4] Abraham was the elect of Shem, who was the "treasure" of Noah — since he inherited the lands of temperate climate, in the middle of which is found the lovely land, the land of Canaan, which is the land of prophecy.7 A foundation of Halevi's method was the concept that the lands and their inhabitants were differentiated by climatic influence.8 Halevi's per ception vis à vis the effects of geography upon the intellect were appar ently distilled from the writings of Hippocrates.9 The doctrine positing a correlation between climate and intelligence received widespread acclaim in the Medieval period. What made Halevi's version of this theory unique was his conclusion that ארץ ישראל lay at the optimum loca tion for climate, intellect and prophecy.10 Halevi made prophecy dependent upon geography. Whoever prophesied only did so in ארץ ישראל or on account of it. In this manner, Abraham merited his first prophecy when he was commanded to go to this land; and Ezekiel and Daniel prophesied on account of it. Indeed, the two of them yet saw the First Temple and the glory of the Divine Indwelling, through which, as long as it was resting in that Temple, everyone who was prepared for it from the perspective of election, attained prophecy.11 Halevi restricted prophecy to the people of Israel in the land of Israel.12 This move lay at the very core of Halevi's person. The climate of Israel, just like the people of Israel, was the chosen of God, and, therefore, a priori,priori, the finest on earth. Rightly then, יהיה is called the God of Israel, because this vision was not given to any other people. And indeed, He is also called God of (7) Translated from Even Shemuel, ספר הכוזרי לרבי יהודה הלוי, p. 32. Cf. S.

Ibn Ezra harbored a profound admiration for Arabic culture in general, and philosophy was no excep tion. His thoughts and his actions appear to have been predicated upon his feelings of exile from Moslem Spain. Halevi also demonstrated remarkable consistency in his philosophical perspective. He believed wholeheartedly in the superiority of all aspects of ארץ ישראל, thereby emphasizing that it was from Israel, and Israel alone, that he felt exiled. The climate Ibn Ezra sought was a Jewish version of the Arabian penin sula. Halevi sought the climate of the walled city of Jerusalem. Neither man lived in his ideal climate because both dwelled in גלות. Ibn Ezra countered the claims of Arabiyya when he had recourse to rabbinic literature, even though he retained a literary reverence for the Qur'ân.Qur'ân. "The more recent descendants of these tribes (viz. the Ishmael ites and the Qahtanids) speak the pure language of the Qur'ân, which is unrivalled in the purity of its language, even the most celebrated of their masters of rhetoric being unable to imitate it.14" But, in ספר העיונים והדיונים he included a vignette about an encounter with an Arab master rhetorician. Once in the days of my youth, in the country where I was born, one of the great Moslem sages, well versed in their laws, a good friend of mine, asked me to read him the Ten Commandments in Arabic. I realized that it was his intention to disparage their eloquence, so I asked him to read me the first Sura of the Qur'ân in Latin. (He could speak this language, and knew its elements.) But when he tried to translate it into the tongue, he started to speak incoher ently and inelegantly. Then he understood what I meant, and did not repeat his request.15 03) Ibid., 4:17, p. 175.

His loyalty to the Jewish people and Judaism was beyond question. Our holy people lacks nothing . . . because its Divine principles and knowledge derive from the Torah and the prophets, as it is written, "There is no augury in Jacob."16 That is to say, it needs no augury or magic, rather all its knowledge comes to the people through exalted Divine revelation mediated through the prophets who make known what will transpire before it happens, as it is written at the end of the same verse, "Jacob is told at once, Yea Israel, what God has planned."17 . . . and when, on account of the multitude of our sins, we were scattered among the nations . . . He strengthened us by means of His servants who handed down the Torah and the words of the prophets from generation to generation, and from whom we received our religion and its statutes.18 He also made explicit his intentions concerning the twenty canons of poetic embellishments and that he chose to include examples from Hebrew Scripture to demonstrate its poetic legitimacy. In each axiom derived from Arabic canons, I will cite one example from Arabic verse and I will set up opposite it what I find from the superior Scriptures as a statement, lest those that exist in Arabic are thought to be unparalleled, and it be said also that we are com pletely incapable in this area and that the Arabic language is unique in these linguistic adornments and it is totally different from others and that our language is devoid of them.19 Ibn Ezra's defense of the Hebrew language was vehement and unyielding, but it was a defense, a secondary movement in response to the acknowledged virtues of Arabic. He stopped far short of Halevi's primary assertion that Hebrew, the language of God and Israel, was in a class by itself. Ibn Ezra's characterization of the Arabs conceded to them an unmatched literary aptitude. As for the Ishmaelite tribes, God has not favored them with wis dom other than the knowledge of rhetoric, nor did He make them by nature suited to occupy themselves with any branch of learning (16) Numbers 23:23.

They have not excelled other nations and tribes except in the superiority of their language and in their various poetic compositions.20 Such an encomium could only come from someone who deferred to Arab authority in matters of poetics. Ibn Ezra's concept of Judaism accommodated a limited form of Arab supremacy. For God has favored them with a rich language and rhetorical superiority, and they have the capacity to prove anything as well as its opposite, to make what is ugly seem beautiful and the beautiful seem ugly . . . because they are so gifted in rhetoric.21 In his excursus on poetic embellishments, Ibn Ezra praised unstintingly the virtues of Arabic poetry, quoting from the Qur'ân and later Arab lit erary works with facility and conviction. Ibn Ezra had to have been aware of the political factors that aided the development of Arabic. For centuries, the Arabs had been an imperialist power, swallowing territory and cultures as a giant fish would devour plankton. But, he tended to disregard the causes and concentrated on the effect, i.e., the richness of the Arabic language. And because these tribes surpassed all other peoples in their elo quence and their way of speech, they overcame (the speakers of) many other languages and conquered many other peoples, compelling them to accept their dominion . . . Their borders grew ever wider, and their cities and provinces were filled with wisdom. They translated all the ancient and modern works of learning, and, having mastered them, added their own explanations and com mentaries. Everything that has been written or translated in all branches of knowledge has been written or translated into Arabic, because God has favored the Arabs with a rich language and with superior eloquence.22 By linking the Arab's linguistic acumen with Divine providence, Moses Ibn Ezra ascribed to the Arab people a hallowed status, one which he appreciated, and perhaps even envied. He divorced his personal reli gious beliefs from his perceptions of superior poetry. He saw no incon (20) Allony, "The Reaction of Moses Ibn Ezra," p. 27, from Halper, שירת ישראל, pp. 47-48. Ibn Ezra went on to quote a remark falsely attributed by the Arabs to Aristotle in support of Arab linguistic preeminence. The coup de grace, however, comes with Ibn Ezra's use of a quotation from an Arab source. "The Arabic tongue is among tongues even as the season of spring is among the seasons."

KATZEW [8] sistency in ascribing limited preeminence to a people other than the Jew ish people, and that alone constituted an irreconcilable difference from Judah Halevi's beliefs. I believe that is why, in part, when Moses Ibn Ezra lived among Arabs his concept of exile from the land of Israel lacked the impassioned yearning felt palpably by Halevi, for whom any life in Spain constituted exilic life. Moses Ibn Ezra accepted the prevailing medieval definition of poetry as having two sine qua non attributes: rhyme and meter. This left him high and dry when he felt compelled to speak about biblical poetry, or lack thereof. We have nothing (in Scripture) that is not prose other than the three books of Psalms, Job and Proverbs; and even these books, as one may see, have neither rhyme nor meter in the manner of the Arabs. In their external form they somewhat resemble verses of poems in the Arabic meter of rajaz.23 RajazRajazRajaz represented incipient poetry, verse in its lowest form. Indeed, one who composed a piece in the rajaz form was not con sidered a poet who really understood the art of poetry, since even magicians and sorcerers employed for their utterances either rhymed prose or the rajaz meter.24 (23) Ibid., from Halper, שירת ישראל, p. 57. (24) Ibid., p. 30. Dictionary of Oriental Literatures, v. 3, ed. Jiri Becka, Basic Books: N.Y., 1974, pp. 154-155. "Qasida" — "an Arabic ode with a regular rhyme scheme aa ba ca in the hemistichs, and a single meter based on quantity. In ancient (pre-Islamic) poetry the term QasidaQasida was connected with qasie, meaning verse written as an art form with highly devel oped metrical schemes compared with the more or less occasional verses of the rajaz meter. The introduction of the qasida is traditionally ascribed to al-Muhalhil, or to Imru'al Qays (qu) in the sixth century, but this is no more than legend. The basic themes of the qasida were apparently: love, description and panegyric. The poet took one theme which he developed to a greater or lesser degree; the themes were not causally linked, a feature developed from Ancient Arabian verse; this aimed at concision of thought and rejected transition both in form and content." Princeton Princeton Encyclopedia of Poetry and Poetics, ed. Alex Preminger, Princeton University Press, Princeton, N.J., 1974, pp. 42-46. "The qasida may extend to upward of a hundred couplets, all upon the same rhyme. It has been proposed that the earliest meters in Arabic poetry are the rajaz (( ^ —). The complete verse is composed of a couplet, often rhyming. Older rajaz poems are often so composed that each has the common rhyme of the whole poem as if complete in itself." Nicholson, R.A., A Literary History of the Arabs. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, England, 1969, pp. 74 ff. "The most ancient of the Arabian metres is rajaz. It is an irregular iambic meter consisting of 'two or three' feet to the line. It is a peculiarity of rajaz that all the lines rhyme with each other. It should be uttered extempore, a few verses at a time." With respect to meter the poet may choose any but the rajaz, which is deemed beneath the dignity of the ode (qasida).</page><page sequence="9">[9] MOSES IBN EZRA AND JUDAH HALEVI 187 He found no evidence in the Bible of qasidas, or poetry classified at the pinnacle of medieval form. He confessed his ignorance with respect to the origin of Hebrew poetry.25 That notwithstanding, Ibn Ezra remarked that the ancestors of the Spanish Jews had come from Jerusalem, and that they possessed outstanding literary talent.26 He traced the history of Hebrew poetry and mentioned with pride the Jews' ability to emulate the Arabs.27 Ibn Ezra and Halevi agreed that the Hebrew language had become impoverished since the biblical era, but they accounted for that fact differently. Ibn Ezra subscribed to the school headed by Saadia Gaon in this matter, attributing the dégénéra tion of the Hebrew language to its disuse. Halevi sought to explain the decline of Hebrew as a concomitant to "mingling with the Gentiles," which resulted from exile.28 It was only in reference to the Arabic language that Ibn Ezra held the Arabs in high esteem. He omitted the Arabs in his cataloging of peoples that had made significant contributions to culture. Know that the famous peoples and illustrious nations that have devoted themselves to the acquisition of knowledge and have directed their energies to the sciences, such as the Hindus, the Persians, the Greeks, the Turks and the Copts . . . (The Arabs do not belong to the groups that have devoted themselves to learning or to the sciences, nor has God favored them with understand ing.)29 The Arabs' deficiency in the sciences, according to Ibn Ezra, did not detract from their linguistic preeminence. Allony brings up a trenchant point with respect to Ibn Ezra's poetry. "Moses Ibn Ezra's voluminous poetical output (there are approximately two thousand pieces) contain but few references to biblical place names. Their paucity is the more striking if we compare the frequency of occur rence of such names in the poetry of Ibn Gabirol, Samuel Hanagid and Judah Halevi."30 This phenomenon supports the contention that Halevi (25) Cf. Halkin, ספר העיונים והדיונים, p. 47• Dunash ben Labrat is currently thought to have been the first to introduce nonliturgical, Arabic modeled poetry into Spain. (26) Cf. Halkin, ספר העיונים והדיונים, p. 55. (27) Allony, "The Reaction of Moses Ibn Ezra," p. 31. (28) Ibid., p. 32. (With respect to Moses Ibn Ezra) "It therefore emerges that in the work here being considered, when it comes to language and literature we encounter apolo getics rather than any spirit of combativeness, and a submissive acceptance rather than any embittered sense of resentment." (29) Ibid., p. 33. Halper, שירת ישראל, p. 47. Allony here mentions this piece of informa tion in the context of shu'ubiyya, the doctrine espoused by those who wished to establish parity between the conquered Arab peoples and the natives of the Arabian peninsula.

Ibn Ezra was not preoccu pied with the landscape of ארץ ישראל because he did not realistically con template being in ארץ ישראל. But, about Granada, Moses Ibn Ezra sang praises. Ibn Ezra's attitude towards Arabiyya received rebuttal in later genera tions.31 Jewish poets feared that Hebrew poetry would be subsumed under an Arabic umbrella. Judah Halevi entered the polemic on the side opposite the one represented by his friend, Moses Ibn Ezra. "We know that the great Judah Halevi repeated the assertions of Menahem Ibn Saruq's followers. It, therefore, appears that the initial controversy con tinued to rumble through the Jewish culture of Spain during the two hundred years that separate Halevi from his predecessors in this respect, and that it went on right to the end of the Spanish period of Hebrew poetry."32 Arabiyya, then, was a plaguing issue for Medieval Spanish Jewry, one that was important enough to have caused two life long friends to disagree strenuously. "Moses Ibn Ezra's enthusiasm for Arabiyya Arabiyya provoked a vigorous reaction in the Kuzari even though Judah Halevi was a close friend of Moses Ibn Ezra throughout their joint lives (sic!)."33 Although Ibn Ezra assented to an essential tenet of Arabiyya, the unsurpassed excellence of the Arabic language, we know of no poem that he composed in Arabic. If he venerated a language, why did he not use it to express his own verse?34 Undoubtedly, his personal piety con tributed to his choice of a linguistic vehicle. In theory, Ibn Ezra appreci ated Arabic, but in practice, he believed only in Hebrew. The Bible, according to Ibn Ezra, contained unpolished diamonds, in a literary sense, gems which encased all the types of rhetoric and poetry manifest in Arabic poetics. He endeavored to act as a link in the chain of tradi tional Hebrew poetry, but he sought to bring Hebrew poetry to the level attained by Arabic verse. Another factor which contributed to Ibn Ezra's perspective on Arabiyya was intimately related to his state of exile. "The circumstance of his residence in a land felt by him to be alien, and his leaving his own birthplace to reside, as an exile, far from the center of (31) Ibid., pp. 35-38. "Indeed, an anû-Arabiyya motif had characterized Spanish Hebrew poetry from its very beginning. A major component of the controversy between Menahem Ibn Saruq's disciples and Dunash ben Labrat involved not only the introduction of Arabic meters into Hebrew poetry but the importance to Menahem's school of prosecuting the war against Arabiyya." (32) Ibid., p. 36. (33) Ibid.

For Halevi, descent was not enough, ascent, עליה, was necessary. In ספר הכוזרי the Khazar king invited a Christian scholar and a Moslem sage to his court before he entered into a dialogue with the חבר. He went to all three in search of a solution to a recurring dream that had puzzled him. "Your intention pleases the Lord, but your deed is not pleasing."37 Being a pious man, the king sought to rectify the revealed inconsistency of his thought and action. Figuring that the solution had to reside among those who claimed to possess the truth, he confronted a philosopher, a Christian and a Moslem in turn. He ended up rejecting all three, but for different reasons.38 His dialogue with the Islamic rep resentative sheds some light on the advantages Halevi saw in Judaism over Islam. The Khazar king called to one of the wise sages of Islam and asked him about his teaching and his observance. The Moslem sage said: We believe in the unity and eternity of God, in the creation of the universe, and in the relation of all peo pie to Adam and to Noah. However, we reject an anthropomorphic God totally, and if a word of it is found in the language of the Qur'àn,Qur'àn, we interpret it and say that it is allegorical in order to be close to human understanding. Aside from this, we claim that our scripture is the word of God: This book is a miraculous thing, (35) Allony, "The Reaction of Moses Ibn Ezra," p. 39. (36) Cf. note 26. (37) Even Shemuel, trans., 1:1 ,ספר הכוזרי לרבי יהודה הלוי, p. 1. (38) Ibid., 1:2 p. 4• The Khazar king is a religious man, a believer in search of religious behavior. The philosopher, then, does not really have a chance to respond to the Khazar king's quest; hence, "Your words are cogent but do not correspond to what I am seeking." 1:5, p. 7. The Khazar king requires logical consistency, so he rejects the Christian scholar as deficient. "This faith does not allow a place for logic. Indeed, logic makes remote much of what you say." The Khazar king refines his own thinking in dialogue with the Moslem Sage. He sets up criteria for demonstrative proof of God speaking to a human: namely irrefutable public acts with linguistic comprehensibility which one sensed distinctly, and which can be repeated. It is the Sage who indirectly brings up the Jews by his mention of Moses and the Children of Israel as part of his tradition. The Khazar king is actually led to his rejection of Islam by the Moslem Sage, who adduces events in Jewish history in response to the Khazar king's request for proof of God's intercourse with people. "Indeed I see that I must ask the Jews, who are the remnant of the children of Israel. I understand that they constituted demonstrative proof concerning the matter that there exists divine instruction on earth." 2:10, p. 9.</page><page sequence="12">igo JAN D. KATZEW [12] which compels us to accept it by its very essence, because no one in the universe can compose a book like it, not even one of its verses. Our prophet is the seal of the prophets, and he abrogates every teaching that preceded him, and he calls upon all peoples to accept Islam. The reward of the believer — the return of his spirit to his body in the Garden of Eden, where he will be sated with pleasantries, lacking nothing for food, drink and bodily delights, to the extent of his desire; and the punishment of the heretic — his descent to an unextinguishable fire, his sufferings will never cease. The Khazar king: Whoever wants to be guided towards faith in the Divine Word, and to verify for himself that God speaks to man, though he considers it remote, must prove it via well established facts that are incontrovertible, and even then it would be very diffi cult for him to verify that, indeed, God spoke to man. Even though your book may be a miracle, it is written in Arabic, so a foreigner like me cannot know to distinguish this book as being miraculous and unique, and even if you were to read it to me, I would not know to differentiate it from another book in the Arabic lan 39 guage.guage. The Khazar king's rationale, claiming that since he could not under stand Arabic, the miraculous character of the Qufan was inaccessible to him, seems curious. Would not the same argument apply to Hebrew? It would if the Khazar king were simply an objective inquirer into the essence of the religious practice. He was anything but impartial in the Kuzari.Kuzari. Here is one case in which Halevi could not have identified with the חבר, who was not yet part of the dialogue, but rather with the Khazar king. Halevi was the motivating force behind the Khazar's expressed opinion on Arabic. Halevi did not accept any notion of Arabic qua holy language. He reserved that title for Hebrew alone. More than a logical argument, the Khazar's confessed ignorance of Arabic was a nicely couched attack on Arabiyya. Not only was the Khazar king ignorant of Arabic, he claimed that he would be unable to detect its miraculous nature even if it were read to him. The doctrine of Arabiyya propounded the sui generis linguistic character of the Qur'ân in maintaining that no other Arabic could imitate even one of the Qur'ânic verses! The Khazar king was not an illiterate boor; he just did not understand Arabic. Halevi wanted a reader to accept the notion that to an objective eye, Arabic pos sesses no inherent linguistic superiority. Arabic, to the Khazar king, was just like any other language, and so it (39) Even Shemuel, 1:5-6 ,ספר הכוזרי לרבי יהודה הלוי, pp. 78־•</page><page sequence="13">[13] MOSES IBN EZRA AND JUDAH HALEVI 1g1 was to Judah Halevi. The Khazar king became the mouthpiece for Judah Halevi to express his opposition to the claims of Arabiyya. The Khazar king never questioned the חבר about the Hebrew language. He only asked the חבר to explain its beauty. This subtlety was not really very subtle at all. Halevi rejected Arabiyya out of hand just as he accepted the holiness of Hebrew a priori. What was masterful in the Kuzari was the way in which, through both the חבר and the Khazar king, he countered the tenets of Arabiyya. The king rejected the Qur°ân on the basis that its sanctity was indeterminate. He approached the חבר and eventually came to accept the Tor ah as a reliable transmission of revelation even though it was written in Hebrew! All this, of course, took place in the Arabic text of the Kuzari. On Halevi's agenda in his defense of a despised religion, was a vehement attack on Arabiyya and an equally forceful advocacy of Jewish superiority. The Khazar king did eventually touch on the linguistic aspect of the Torah,Torah, but only after carefully listening to and responding to the experi ential line of reasoning by the חבר. Any inquiry by the Khazar king into the Hebrew language was an afterthought. He had already come over to the side of the חבר when the Khazar king showed an interest in the liter ary character of the Torah. The Khazar king: The mind can certainly and without reservation accept commandments such as these. For a prophet came to subju gated and oppressed slaves and promised them that they would go out from their slavery — and they went out by a way that he designed for them and at the appointed time which he fixed with out delay; and this prophet guided them to the land of Canaan, which was then in the hands of seven nations, each one of which was more powerful than they, and he assigned to each one of their tribes its inheritance in that land before he brought them there, and all this in a short time with signs and miracles, and through this the exalted status of the Sender was verified as well as the greatness of the Messenger, and also the importance of the congre gation to whom alone he was sent. If that prophet had said: I was sent to lead the whole world, and his word only reached half of it, then his mission would be in doubt, since the Divine Intent would not have been fulfilled by it. And among the things that prevent this fulfillment was that the Holy Book which the prophet brought with him was written in Hebrew and the nations of Sheba, India and Khazar would find it difficult to understand this book and to do what was written in it. And indeed, their acceptance of his faith</page><page sequence="14">192 JAN D. KATZEW [14] could only happen after centuries, or be imposed upon them by their defeat in a war with practitioners of the religion, or by consent through an alliance without them actually having seen that prophet himself or even another prophet who would testify to the integrity of the first and shed light on his teaching. The חבר: Moses called only his people to his teaching (Torah), people of his language, and God promised his people to return and command them about His Torah at fixed times through proph ets. He fulfilled His word as long as He favored the children and caused His presence to dwell among them.40 The Khazar king acknowledged the truth of the Hebrew Scriptures and then asked about Hebrew. The process occurred in the reverse fash ion in his earlier dialogue with the Moslem sage. In that case, he first claimed that being a non-Arab, he could not perceive the miraculous . But, with respect to the Torah, the Khazar king was willing to accept the contents of the book without being able to comprehend its language. What made the criteria apply differently? The Khazar king functions here as the instrumentality of Halevi's position vis à vis Arabiyya. Arabic not being the supreme language in Halevi's view, he asserts the sanctity of Hebrew. The Khazar king was persuaded to accept Judaism because of the nature of its "provable theophany" and then was willing to con sider the linguistic merits of the Hebrew language. Unlike Moses Ibn Ezra, Halevi did not concede to Arabiyya even on one point, namely the linguistic preeminence of Arabic. According to Halevi, Hebrew, as the language of biblical transmission, was as holy as the transmission itself. To have conceded to Arabic linguistic superiority would have seemed to Halevi as vitiating the language of Torah, and by extension, acquiescing to claims of the Moslems' religious superiority. The חבר took pride in the particularity of the Jewish people and the Hebrew language. It was to the Jews and the Jews alone that God gave His Torah Torah through His prophet, Moses. Subsequently, the Jews bore the responsibility of transmitting the Torah to the other nations. The חבר did precisely that by sharing the Torah with the Khazar king and, in turn, with the readers of the Kuzari. Part of the literary excellence Halevi demon strated in the Kuzari inhered in the harmony he was able to achieve between its medium and message.41 Ultimately, however, the literary ele gance of the Kuzari ought to be considered secondary to its author's attempt to live what he wrote. Halevi composed the Kuzari not only as a (40) ספר הכחרי, Even Shemuel, trans., 1:100-101, p. 38. (41) Strauss makes this point cogently in Persecution and the Art of Writing, pp. 98-112.</page><page sequence="15">[15] MOSES IBN EZRA AND JUDAH HALEVI 193 defense for his people, but as a personal statement of faith fulfilled only by his action, his עליה. The dream attributed to the Khazar king, which set him out to find religious truth, claimed that "His intent was pleasing to the Lord, but his deed was not pleasing." Maybe this was the dream of Halevi himself who, after reflecting upon his people's experience, realized that the only way to bring his deed into harmony with his intent was to go to ישראל ארץ. In the course of arriving at that conclusion, Halevi confronted Arabiyya,Arabiyya, and summarily dismissed it as folly. Just as political factors influenced the spread of Arabiyya, Halevi had to account for the servile role the Jews played in the Medieval world. The Arabs could seek to justify Arabiyya on the basis of its increasing power. How could the Jews, whose influence had been on the wane since the destruction of the Temple in 70 c.e., lay claim to ultimate truth? The Khazar king asked the חבר to account for Jewish political subservience. The חבר: For Israel among the nations is as the heart among the organs; it is sicker than all of them, yet healthier than all of them. The Khazar king: Please add an explanation to your words. The חבר: Many are the pains that afflict the heart frequently alternating. Are they not: worries, sorrows, grudges, love, hate, and fears; the quality of the heart's temperament changes constantly, even inhaling and exhaling, how much the more so because of poor food or inferior drink. All movements act upon it: types of exertion, and wakefulness and sleep — even if the other organs are unafflicted from all of them. The Khazar king: You clarified for me then that the heart is sicker than the other organs, but in what manner is it also healthier than they? The חבר: Is it possible that an abcess would dwell in the heart, which would cause inflammation, or cancer, or atrophy, or injury, or paralysis, or flaccidity when they occur in the rest of the organs? The Khazar king: Something like this is impossible, because from less than this, death would result. And also this: the heart, because of its clear sensibility, brought about by the purity of its blood and the increased air in it, senses the slightest thing that could afflict it and expels it as long as its ability to do so remains. Every other organ lacks the heart's sensibility, and therefore an abcess can dwell in it until the sickness becomes a reality. The חבר: If so, the sensibilities of the heart cause it many ills, but yet they are the cause of their expulsion from their very penetration, before they take root.</page><page sequence="16">194 JAN D. KATZEW [16] The Khazar king: Yes, indeed. The חבר: The Divine presence to us is as the relation of the soul to the heart. . . Just as the heart is afflicted by the ills that develop in the rest of the organs, i.e., the lusts of the liver and the stomach on account of the evil disposition of the testicles, so does Israel develop the ills on account of their imitation of the nations. As it is said: "They mingled among the nations and learned their ways." (Ps. 106:35) 42 Israel, being the heart of the nations according to the חבר, has fallen prey to the disease of the other organs. That accounted for its humbled status. If Israel had responded more to the Divine influence and less to the Gentile influence, then presumably, Israel would have been the healthiest of the nations on earth. The חבר did not suggest that the Jews lacked responsibility for their degeneration, yet he accused the nations of fostering a disease that led to Jewish subjugation. The verbal sword of the חבר cut both ways, but it cut the gentiles deeper than it did the Jews. The significance of this dialogue is magnified in light of Halevi's percep don of exile. He claimed to have been alienated not only from Christian and Moslem Spain but from the Jews who lived there and accepted the prevailing values. Halevi had contempt for Arabiyya regardless of its pro ponent. He empathized with the heart that was susceptible to the disease of the other organs, but he longed for the heart that responded more to the soul, to the Divine influence, than to the body. Halevi understood the reasons why Jews stayed in Spain, but he did not agree with their decision. He knew about perils of travel by sea, but he was willing to accept the risk, because he was like a heart searching for a soul. Halevi believed that for the people of Israel to regain its rightful status, it had to live in ארץ ישראל. In seeking to convey his feelings regarding the land of Israel, Halevi, through the חבר, cites the unfulfilled mission of Moses to enter the "Promised Land." Ironically, history has shown Halevi's own dream to have been unrealized. Nevertheless, the depth of Halevi's passion for Zion, like that ascribed to Moses, remains paradigmatic. The חבר: After these things this is what they said: Everyone ascends to ארץ ישראל, and no one descends (Ketubot 13:11). Concerning this they decided: A woman who does not want to go to ארץ ישראל with her husband forfeits her marriage contract and is divorced. On the other hand, if the husband does not want to accompany his (42) Even Shemuel, trans., 2:39-44 ,ספר הכוזרי, pp. 71-73.</page><page sequence="17">[17] MOSES IBN EZRA AND JUDAH HALEVI 195 wife to ארץ ישראל, he must divorce her and pay her according to the marriage contract (Ketubot 110b). Moreover, they said, it is better to dwell in ארץ ישראל in a city whose inhabitants are mostly gentiles than to dwell outside the land of Israel in a city whose inhabitants are mostly Jewish, for he who lives in ארץ ישראל resembles him who has a God, while he who lives outside the land is likened to him who has no God (Ketubot 110b). . . . They also said: Burial in ארץ ישראל is like being buried beneath the altar (Ketubot 111a).43 Halevi had no sympathy for Arabiyya, and in the Kuzari, he made it a point to deny one of its premises, to wit: "The air in ארץ ישראל makes one wise.44" Ibn Ezra offered a limited endorsement of Arabiyya in this thought. This difference of opinion highlighted another facet of the gulf that separated Halevi from Ibn Ezra. The two men shared a com mon experience, that of exile. The theme of גלות cut across every aspect of their lives. In the Kuzari, Judah Halevi, most often through the חבר, sought to convince others as he had become convinced, that the only real state of exile for a Jew was from ארץ ישראל. Halevi and Ibn Ezra may not have confronted one another's exile directly, but through their lives, their poetry, their poetics and their philosophical attitudes, two venerable stories emerge. Moses Ibn Ezra found a home in his youth, the city of Granada, that offered him the intellectual inspiration he sought so desperately in his exile. The course he charted in his poetry and in ספר העיונים והדיונים strove to bring him back to the "loveliest of places," Granada, or to the "city of poetry," Seville. Judah Halevi in his poetry and in the Kuzari outlined his response to exile. He felt exiled from the "land of milk and honey," ארץ ישראל, and from the "city of David," Jerusalem. What united Halevi and Ibn Ezra in their exiles was a bond of friendship. What divided them in exile was a difference in their perceived ability to master their fate and return home. Moses Ibn Ezra was exiled from his intellectual home, which he thought awaited him in Granada. Judah Halevi was exiled from his spiritual home, which he believed awaited him in Jerusalem. Ironically, their perceptions of exile account for both their personal affinity and their physical separation. Their exile united them in yearning to be home, but separated them because they did not agree where home was located. Moses Ibn Ezra and Judah Halevi lived as they wrote, saddened by their exile and buoyed by different visions of return. (43) Ibid., 2:22, ספר הכוזרי, pp. 61-62.
