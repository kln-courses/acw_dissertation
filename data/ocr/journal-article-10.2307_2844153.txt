<plain_text><page sequence="1">Musicology in Uganda* K. P. WACHSMANN Uganda Museum, Kampala FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF THE MUSICOLOGIST, ethno-musicology can be approached in several ways. It can, for instance, be approached from 'outside' the music - through the consideration of musical material on an historical basis, or of the nature of musical sound, or of musical sound in relation to musical experience. The external approach, however, has its dangers, of which the 'cent' system of measurement (Lloyd 1951, p. 149) is a good example. Is it logical to apply a measuring norm, based on the equal temperament of the chromatic scale, to exotic musical phenomena such as the heptatonic tuning of the Konjo xylophone, in which even the conception of octaves is not taken for granted? Is the interval of one cent, which is imperceptible to the human ear, too small for practical use? How much importance should be attached to measure- ments in cents made by techniques known to be inaccurate? External inquiry leads towards classification and makes it possible to relate any given performance to our knowledge of music elsewhere. The music can also be approached from 'within'. Its laws and conventions may be studied, but the study must be, as far as possible, from the standpoint of the people for whom the music has meaning and not from that of modern science. Ihe outcome should be an understanding of the range of values that the musician and his listeners have applied. It might be thought that the difficulty of understanding is entirely Western in origin, but it probably arises whenever an educated observer studies the phenomena of folk-music, especially if he undertakes the study on the basis of a set of traditions not immediately his own. I have an educated Muganda assistant who is quite unable to grasp music other than that of his own tribe, and requires musicological technique just as much as a European who might be studying West African drum- ming or the pan-pipes of Samoa. We are dealing here with musical appreciation, as we would say in Western terminology. From my experience in Uganda, I know how difficult it is to arrive at a true scale of values and to avoid being deceived into drawing conclusions based on my own musical background. For example, Uganda music is full of repetitions. Are the repetitions meaningless and a failure in dramatic development, or are they part of some musical scheme which demands repetition rather than change and development? The laws and conventions of performance, and the extent of permissible deviation, have never been static; under modern conditions they are liable to such remarkable alterations that their study should really be thought of as a third, and separate, problem. We have, then, three of the possible lines of investigation along which ethno-musicology might proceed: one is an attempt to assign to a musical culture its proper place in relation to other musical cultures, another is an attempt to understand any given piece of music from within the horizon of its own conception, and the last is the study of changes occurring as the result of present-day conditions. I shall deal with these three lines in turn. Beginning with problems of history, the musicologist looks with envy at the recitations of tradition and the genealogies of the historian proper and at the finds and strata of the archaeologist. *The transcription of a lecture given at the Royal Antlhropological Institute on 6 August 1953.

It is clear, for instance, that in Uganda one must be content with a study of the distribution of musical instru- ments, in the hope that parallels and comparisons may at least suggest certain conclusions. Even this approach is greatly hampered by thle lack of information. If we had at our disposal surveys of sound instruments from every part of Africa, and from other continents as well, of the kind made in recent years in the north-east of the Congo (Costermans 1947) and in Uganda (Trowell &amp; Wachsmann 1953), distribution maps would be far more instructive. As it is, comparisons can only be made on random information that has been gathered by observers whose chief interest was not inusical. One particular theory has been persistently stated: that the African xylophones and the Indonesian xylophones and metallophones are relatives (Haddon 1952). There is a family resemblance, but points of detail cause much trouble. Even fundamentals are uncertain. Never- theless, it might be useful to inspect more closely what I have just called the family resemblance. The comparison with Indonesian instruments is likely to be profitable because in Uganda there are seven xylophonie types (Trowell &amp; Wachsmann 1953, p. 390) varying not only in construction but in playing techniques. tuning, and tribal usage. The Uganda instruments are all of the 'free key' type and thus belong to the types found in Boone's (1936, P1. XIII) northern area of distribution. These types occupy a narrow and disjointed strip running along the east coast of Africa towards the Bantu Line and then from Lake Victoria across to the west coast. Outside this area and far to the north of the Bantu Line Jensen (1936, p. 83) has reported an instrument among the Sidamo, near Lake Abaya, which is not recorded by Boone. It has affinities with the instruments found south of Lake Kyoga and with those of the Shambala in Tanganyika, but we do not know what sort of music is played on it nor do we know how it is tuned. Until recently this has been the sum' of our knowledge of xylophones in East Africa. On the subject of Indonesian instruments a great deal has been written and, more especially, we have Kunst's (1949) detailed studies of these. Recordings are available and gamelan orchestras have often played in Europe. How far is a comparative study possible at this moment? All Uganda instruments correspond to the Javanese saron group; nothing of the gender type occurs in Uganda. Nearly all Uganda xylophones are multi-octave instruments, but in Java such instruments belong to types of an earlier period, of which the only living representative is the gambang gangsa (Kunst 1949, p. 171). Its three octaves are referred to by special names, a practice also known in Uganda, but I must add that I have never been able to relate the divisions to any musical scheme. Another point is the custom of the Bantu along the southern shore of Lake Kyoga of keeping a reserve key of high pitch with their instrument. I do not know the musical significance of this key; I have seen it many times, but I have never seen it in use. The practice of using supple- mentary keys for quick modifications of tuning is of course typical of Indonesia, as Kunst (1949, p. 187) shows for instruments of the gender type. The instruments found to the south of Lake Kyoga have carved bosses on the upper surface of two or three of the sixteen keys. The bosses are called amakundi, a word which means 'navels', but which is applicable because of a common local anatomical peculiarity: owing to umbilical hernia, the navel is often a protuberance instead of a depression. No explanation of the bosses can be given. They are not, as the word 'navel' might suggest, anthropomorphic, and I can only point out that they are curiously like the bosses of the saron (Kunst 1949, p. 164). Some odd linguistic parallels also occur. Kunst (1949, p. ioi) reports that 'the intervals of a single step is indicated in Java by the word wilah', which one would be tempted to compare with the South African word mbila. Mbila is unknown in Uganda. In Uganda every xylophone, at one time or another, is called endaara or entaala. For this Kunst</page><page sequence="3">52 K. P. WACHSMANN (1949, p. 64) provides another parallel in the word antara. Has the term for a slendro scale from West Java, madenda (Kunst 1949, p. 64), any real association with the Luganda word for xylophone, amadinda, or is it merely phonetic accident? There are other technical details concerning shape, suspension, and tuning notches which would reward study on comparative lines, but I will now turn to more specifically musical parallels such as those of tuning patterns and musical form. It is necessary to begin with some definitions. I think the word 'tuning' should be reserved for the practical arrangement of musical intervals to suit the musical purposes of the musician, and 'scale' should be used only with reference to a sequence of intervals capable of unambiguous definition. The word 'equidistant' should be employed only if the execution of the tuning can be described and obviously aims at equidistant intervals. The Gwere, who live east of the Mpologoma River, tune the xylophone in wide intervals, using a tetratonic pattern which also occurs in their harp tunings. The patterns are unique in Uganda, but according to Kunst (1940, pp. 22 ff.), they can be found in the doli-doli xylophone of Nias. TIhe Ganda and the Soga use equidistant pentatonic tunings and the tuning of the Konjo xylophone is approximately heptatonic. The slendro and pelog tunings of Indo- nesia are pentatonic and heptatonic respectively, but it is questionable whether they are in fact comparable to the Uganda tunings; they serve music that may be essentially different from Uganda music. The Uganda tunings are not features which can be detached from the whole body of Uganda musical culture: they are not only instrumental but also part and parcel of vocal music. To sav that the heptatonic tuning pattern of the Konjo xylophone is the parallel of an Indonesian pattern, or even of Indonesian origin, is almost to say that Konjo music is parallel to, or determined by, an Indonesian sense of tonal pattern, which is surely going too far. We know, by the way, that in any one tribal area in Uganda there is never more than one tuning: in Indonesia the distribution is not ethnologically limited (Kunst 1949, pp. 22-3). Kunst (1949, p. 178) and other investigators have measured hundreds of museum specimens and found that African and Indonesian tunings are identical, even to points of fine detail. It is necessary to postpone conclusions - at least with regard to Uganda tunings - until the controversy regarding the theory of blown fifths (Kunst 1948) has been settled and until every step has been supported by acoustic, musical, and ethnographical evidence. In Uganda an interpretation of tunings through the theory of blown fifths appears strangely remote. There is no tradition of the origin of such a process, nor of any measuring norm. Tuning practice is explained music- ally far more readily by Hornbostel's series of semi-fourths, and psychologically by Stumpf's (1922, pp. 142, 146) view that equidistant intervals give rise to specific sensations. The discussion of the migration of tunes, musical styles, and techniques greatly attracts the musicologist. It is hoped that within the next few years enough precise material will become available to enable an opinion to be formed on genuine parallels. Whether the parallels will prove identity of musical culture is another matter. The material should make valuable the investigation of such techniques as the amakonezi of the Ganda amnadinda. The amakonezi style is, in a musical sense, so highly specialized that its occurrence in another civilization is hardly credible unless we assume that there has been contact. I have briefly referred to this problem in my section of Tribal Crafts of Uganda (Trowell 8c Wachsmann 1953, p. 319). Gamelan music on the whole is characterized by periods clearly marked by commas, semicolons, and full stops. Some akadinda music may be built on a similar conception (cf. Uganda Museum recording No. 49.o8 in), but its patterns might be akin to something quite different - the speech periods of Ganda vocalists. Another historical problem, of rather a different nature, is presented by the side-blown trumpet sets which are part of the Court regalia in several Uganda kingdoms. I have rarely been told stories about the migrations of xylophones in tJganda, btut it is typical of the trumpet sets,</page><page sequence="4">Musicology in Uganda 53 perhaps because they are regalia, that they are often associated with legends of their coming. In Bantu Uganda trumpet sets seem to have spread along two routes, one leading from Nyoro into Gwere and Soga and thence to Ganda, and another from Nyoro to Kooki and thence to Nkole. The individual names of the instruments in the set (Trowell &amp; Wachsmann 1953, p. 357) have the appearance of Bantu words but it is likely that they are 'Bantuized' Nilotic cattle names or praise-names.' Their uniformity suggests a common origin. There is a strong association between the sets and cattle, and the dance movements executed in their accompani- ment at ceremonies before the Omukama also bear witness to the association. I have myself seen the excitement engendered in a herd of cows which happened to stray near when a trumpet set was playing; to my astonishment they rose on their hindlegs and pretended to fight. Herd- boys make a popular sport of hiding in some convenient place, usually behind an anthill, and imitating with their voices the sound of the trumpets, to make the cows dance. The trumpet sets consist entirely of short truinpets, with the exception of the Alur agwara, which is a set of tall instruments played on ordinary occasions; there are other Alur sets of short trumpets which are part of the Sultan's regalia. The vernacular names of the tall sets bear no resemblance to those of the regalia sets elsewhere. Outside Uganda the only other tall sct I know is that of the Sidamo in the neighbourhood of Lake Abaya in Southern Abyssinia; it is called dinke (Barblan 1941, p. 74). Tall trumpets in pairs, and found in association either with kettle-drums in pairs or with drums and flutes, have been the subject of historical study. Schaeffner (1959) states that the tall trumpet certainly existed in Egypt and Morocco in the Middle Ages and that, although it still occurs in Morocco, it cannot be found anywhere else north of Lake Chad. He believes that these trumpets, which did not penetrate more to the south than the furthest Sultanate of the Cameroons, were acquired by the Negro populations at the same time as they accepted Islam. Tall trumpets, blown singly or in pairs, are found in Uganda among the Madi. In Nyoro there is a curious tradition that two 'long' trumpets were brought by the Babiito when they succeeded the Bachwezi dynasty ('K.W.' 1937, p. 295). Today, because of their history, these trumpets occupy a rather more exalted position than the multiple amakondere set. No informa- tion or recordings are available regarding the dinke set. It would be of great interest to be able to compare the music played on all these sets, and it would also be valuable to know in what relationship the short Alur set stands to the Nyoro trumpets on the one hand and to the tall Alur instruments on the other. The short Alur set, being part of the regalia, is very rarely played, but the Uganda Museum is trying to obtain recordings of it. The Alur sets, both short and long, differ from the other sets in various ways, for instance in the form of the embouchure, which is raised. Trumpets are invariably found in the company of flutes and kettle-drums, and in this respect the regalia trumpets of Uganda conform to the pattern which Schaeffner assumed had spread to Africa through Islam. In many other respects, however, they differ from the Islamic prototype, and it is impossible to state whether the differences represent an unrelated, independent trumpet type or whether they are merely local variations. One of the deviations from the Islamic pattern is the lateral position of the embouchure, but this feature cannot be treated as an ultimate mark of distinction because even in Uganda and further west amongst the Logo in the Belgian Congo (Costermans 1947, p. 634) there can be found evidence for both side- and end-blown instruments. It is also possible that in Negro Africa the side-blown animal horn trumpet has influenced the trumpet sets. For instance, in Gwere horn and gourd trumpets are used side by side in the same set. To a certain extent the 1Crazzolara (1951, p. 141) gives dhjang, cow, as a Shilluk praise-name. Compare this with tlle trumpet names rudyangi (Lunyoro) and dyangi (Lutoro).</page><page sequence="5">54 K. P. WACHSMANN effect of the lateral position of the embouchure on the manipulation of the trumpet during the performance can be modified by the musician, and it is therefore often impossible to decide from an illustration whether the instrument is side-blown or end-blown. Often the position adopted by the musician changes during a performance; the agwara of the Alur are held in several different ways during the agwara dance, and at least one of the ways is very unusual for a side-blown trumpet. There appears to be a wide range of transitional features between the Islamic pair of end- blown metal trumpets and the multiple sets of the Uganda Courts, a range so wide that it is inmpossible to draw a line of demarcation. Musically, one might be tempted to distinguish between the ensembles with only two trumpets and those with many trumpets. The performance of the Madi pair of trumpets mentioned above cannot be mistaken for the music of the multiple sets.' Generally one might say that the multiple sets are concentrated in the south of the trumpet area of distribution, in Negro Africa rather than in the Islamic regions, but there is a notable parallel to the multiple use of the trumpets and the other instruments associated with them on European soil, namely the Janissary bands of the Ottoman Empire. According to Panoff (1938, p. 636), Janissary bands were called 'nine-member-musical-bands' because they were composed of nine trumpets, nine oboes, nine pairs of kettle-drums, nine big side-drums, and nine Turkish crescents. One of Panoff's illustrations is of special interest in that it shows a set of small kettle-drums arranged in couples and beaten by thin beaters bent upwards, the curvature touching the skin of the drum.2 This style of drumming is characteristic of the ntenga set of the Kabaka's Court which are also mounted in couples. Sir Apolo Kagwa (1949, p. 5) speaks of two Court officials in charge of the regalia drums, each being responsible for nine enjawuzi drums, nine enkonyi drums, and ninety enjiijii drums. We all know that linguistic evidence is often doubtful, but it is hardly possible to disregard the word tabl - one of the two Arabic terms for kettle-drum - as a likely source for the Luganda word timba, which is the name of the most important royal drum in Buganda. In Buganda the timba is not a kettle-drum and the word is alleged to mean 'python'; be that as it may, the drum certainly has a snake carved on its surface. Similar words are ntimbo and atimo in western and northern Uganda. In French tabl becomes timbale. The other Arabic term, naqquara, or, as it is called in Abyssinia, naggarit, might conceivably have been responsible for the Luganda word engalabi. According to Schaeffner (1952, p. 1476), the word tabi is commonly used in Africa west of Lake Chad and the word naqquara to the east of the Lake. Finally, before leaving the problem of trumpet history, I should like to draw attention to the peculiar cone-flute nshegu, associated with the trumpet sets at the Courts of Nyoro, Toro, and Nkole, because it raises yet another musicological problem. It looks like a common cone-flute (see Trowell &amp; Wachsmann 1953, P1. 80E) and is blown like one, but its sound has a reedy character and its construction is very remarkable. Two wooden troughs, pressed rim to rim, form a narrow channel and are kept in position by a cover fitted like the finger of a glove; the cover is often the trachea of a cow. The instrument functions like a large double reed, but more will have to be known about its acoustic properties before a final opinion can be given. There is no comparative material which might help in this. 'UNDERSTANDING FROM WITHIN' Questions of history and comparison do not enter into the musician's experience of a musical performance. One would like to know all the forces that shape that experience, but the forces are not to be thought of as separate from the musician's scale of values. Before going on to 'The performances can be compared in Uganda Museum recordings Nos. 50.139 (Madi) and 50.022 (Alur). 2The illustration probably depicts a scene in Constantinople in 1825.</page><page sequence="6">Musicology in Uganda 55 consider the approach to music 'from within' I should like to describe a piece of music from the Iru of Ankole which will provide some useful examples (Uganda Museum recording No. 50.4859A). The music is so rich in musical form that it may be best to deal first with its formal elements. Basically, there are alternations between vocal solo and flute solo which introduce move- ment in an horizontal direction; there is also movement and tension in a vertical sense provided by the male chorus of low voices. The terms 'horizontal' and 'vertical' are of course borrowed from Western music and however descriptive they are to us, they may be very remote from the experience of the Iru. I propose to concentrate on the performers rather than on aesthetic principles and shall simply state that the musical structure of the piece depends on the two leaders who clothe speech in melody, first vocally and then instrumentally, and on the group actions of several men. My point is that thinking of the relationship between leader and group leads us closer to the character of the performance than thinking in terms of analysis of musical form. There are long low notes sung by the chorus that represent noises made by cattle, and excited rapid recitation by the soloist of the kind often sung in praise of cows; both features emphasize the social setting of the music. It is not suggested that there is any element of conscious imitation, but the listener is given a kind of parallel of an every-day experience. The flute and flowery speech melody, whether produced by a singer or a flautist, provides a striking contrast to the halting and spare bass of the chorus. The one is free, as speech would be normally, and the other is rigid in its conception of the time pattern. So far, the relationship between soloists and chorus has been placed in the foreground of the mental picture, but the ensemble includes drums and rattles whose part must also be discussed. There are two small Uganda drums and two beer-pots tapped on the mouth with fibre pads; the rattles are flat reed-box rattles. It is obvious that the battery of drums and rattles introduces a third element into the performance, that of percussion set against melody. It represents the translation into sound of the physical experience of motion. The coeval existence of currents of speech and physical rhythm is common to music everywhere. In some musical cultures the two currents merge and integration of speech and rhythm seems to be their main purpose: it is commonly held that this has been so in Western music for several centuries. The same aim seems to be pursued in some non-European music, for instance in the gamelan music mentioned previously, but there are other cultures in which the sole purpose of performance seems to be the maintenance of the two currents in uncompromising duality. In central Uganda the duality of speech-conceived melody and physically experienced rhythm is certainly stressed, but I should not expect to find the same emphasis in every part of the African continent. I have said that the musical form of the Iru piece was explicable in terms of the performers and their functions. The duality of speech and rhythm is also realized in the typical African 'call and response' pattern, in which the soloist, as leader, takes the part of melody, and the rest of the group, as chorus, take the part of rhythm. I have been present at a Nyole performance when the same pattern was repeated in the dance formation in which the participants arranged themselves (Uganda Museum recording No. 50.419). The choruses, men on one side, women on the other, lined up facing each other, and the soloist-leader stood between them. The soloist remained static, but the chorus groups moved and danced, and I had a strong impression of two forces setting up some vital tension between them. In Uganda music, as in much other music, form is the by-product of several processes which include the participation of single persons and groups, the dance formations adopted by these persons and groups, and the application of commas, semicolons, and full stops in speech when word groups, phrases, and paragraphs are shaped. Genuine solo performances, in which either</page><page sequence="7">56 K. P. WACHSMANN speech or physical rhythm are realized alone, do not exist. Neither the iiother singing a lullaby nor the solo harpist really gives a solo performance. The mother accompanies the lullaby with the gentle scraping of a twig along the child's basket and the harpist realizes the physical experience of rhythm through his management of his harp, which may be fitted with special devices to help him. The rattling rings on Ganda harps are for that purpose; they initroduce the necessary element of duality. In Konjo the duality is achieved in a different way. The harp is allowed to keep its sensuous and melodious character but is played only in the presence of a percussion beam. Even in the music of the dances of the Jopadhola, which at first seems to be based entirely on rhythmical elements without any melody whatsoever, closer inspection reveals that at the centre of the battery of drums there is a harpist. His playing is, of course, inaudible except to those next to him, the players of the percussion beam or perhaps of one or two of the drums. The harpist stimulates these players, and they follow him. Phrasing is achieved by alterations of the pitch of the voice and by changes of voice register. In Ganda it is common for skilled musicians to transpose a phrase from one frame interval or register to another, and to add passages of humming and short instrumental interludes, all on an equal footing with the vocal phrase. As I have already published an analysis of the trans- positions in one particular song remarkable for the wealth of its frames (Wachsmann 1939), I shall say no more about them here. Transposition is an important factor in Uganda music. In the Iru piece the simple theme of the chorus is transposed a fifth upwards, approximately half way through the performance. If improvised speech and the ways in which persons participate really are significant forces in traditional music, it follows that the coming of literacy and the change of circumstances of performance will have some effect in Uganda music, and this leads to my third and last point, that the musicologist will have to study the effects of change. THE STUDY OF CHANGE Contacts between tribes, in peace and in war, must always have brought about changes. In Uganda, it is sometimes possible to trace the routes along which changes have travelled, although the changes themselves can be defined musically in only a few cases. The bowl-lyre was probably acquired by the Soga from the Gwe about eight generations ago. The Gwe prefer a gentle clear note and accordingly use a bridge to give the strings sufficient clearance. The Soga and the Ganda both prefer a buzzing jingling sound and therefore have discarded the bridge and allowed the strings to rattle and vibrate against the tight lizard-skin of the sotund-bowl. As a general observa- tion, one can say that in Uganda there has been a tendency for some time to discard melodious quality in favour of rhythmical percussion; it is the harps, the musical bows, and the xylophones which are falling into disuse. In Gwere the xylophone miruli is almost completely superseded by the set of tuned drums namaddu. The melodious trumpet sets have hardly enough players today in Ganda but the drumming style of baakisimba is found all over the country and has even spread to neighbouring tribes. The xylophones of the most eastern part of Soga have now disappeared. The sansa with its tuned keys, after a most successful invasion from the West Nile District in the wake of migrating labour, is probably now on the decrease. It is unlikely that these develop- ments have anything to do with the arrival of education and the influence of European adminis- tration; there are too many indications of a fluid and continuous state of transition, the tendencies of which can still be observed. Western influence is bringing about change of a much deeper kind than the increasing emphasis on percussion, which would not of itself cause traditional music to lose its identity. A matter of greater importance is whether traditional music can survive at all in the climate of new social and intellectual circumstances. Deliberate attempts at preservation could only</page><page sequence="8">Musicology in Uganda 57 produce survival in an artificial antiquarian form. The alternative, which may be thought equally distasteful, seems to be the introduction of Western popular music, which has already proved that it can satisfy the urbanized African. Judging from occasional remarks in the vernacular press in Uganda (Anonymous 1953), there is at present a desire amongst the educated African sections of the community to build a culture which is their own, not in defiance of the West, but to enable them to play their part more adequately in culture as in much else. I am not trying to bring politics into music, but merely want to point out that the scene is set for a period of experiment. The methods and the material of the new music of this culture are unknown, but the need for it is clearly felt. Experimental periods are well known in musical history. They are often marked by a dearth of creative power in composition, all effort being spent in the exploration of new techniques. Music composed in their time is accordingly forgotten by posterity, but the experiments never- theless mark a turning-point in musical development. The subject of the experiments in Uganda is the employment in modern circumstances of the traditional treatment of the participation of persons, of speech, of rhythms, and therefore of form. A recent example is the Te Deum com- posed by Mr Solomon Katana and performed during this year's Coronation celebrations in Kampala. It is the result of experiments in the influence of speech on melody and the use of the 'call and response' patterns. In other words, Mr Katana treated two elements of traditional music as if they were artistically significant and capable of existence apart from improvisation. Much more is involved than the substitution of one social background for another, an exchange which might have no effect on music. It seems that musical form is no longer a by-product of the function of the participants, but is gradually assuming significance as self-conscious artistry. REFERENCES ANONYMOUS 1953.
