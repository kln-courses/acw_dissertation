<plain_text><page sequence="1">Book Reviews 369 showed that children in families with a transsexual parent are not appreciably different from other children (especial- ly concerning their sexuality and gender identity), but White and Ettner look instead at children's adaptation to a parent's transition. Ithey come away with sets of both pro- tective and risk factors that will be useful not only in clin- ical settings, but perhaps in legal contexts (as Green's pre- vious work has been). The volume does not shy away from controversial mate- rial, as evidenced by Anne Lawrence's "Autogynephilia: A Paraphilic Model of Gender Identity Disorder." Lawrences chapter offers an overview of Ray Blanchard's controver- sial concept of autogynephilia, which she defines (using Blanchard's words) as "a male's propensity to be sexually aroused by the thought or image of himself as a female" (p. 71). Lawrence, who has published in this area, provides a detailed and much-needed overview of the literature, con- cluding that the concept "provides a powerful model for understanding the phenomenology of male-to-female trans- sexualism' (p. 84). Her discussion productively compli- cates the relationship between gender, gender identity, and sexuality. To Lawrence's credit, she also includes a section that addresses the controversies surrounding autogynephil- ia; however, she characterizes these critiques in overly nar- row terms. Lawrence's reading of the critiques is that some transsexuals feel misrepresented by the concept of autogy- nephilia. This is certalnly one aspect of the critiques, but it does not tap into ffieir full scope. Lawrence ends her section on controversies with rec- ommendations to clinicians about how to help their patients see beyond the critiques to the value of the con- cept of autogynephilia. However, she might have also included some discussion of the concept's possible pitfalls for clinicians. For example, at a recent conference for pro- fessionals who specialize in Gender Identity Disorder, I was talking with some young psychologists at a reception. Mid-conversation, one of them pointed to a transsexual woman looking at herself in a mirror adjusting her make- up, and said, "Look at that! And some people don't think autogynephilia is real." Although anecdotal and outside of a clinical context, this points to the ways in which con- cepts like autogynephilia can take on a life of their own becoming both reductive and reified, and may be too easi- ly applied. This is a danger that comes in part from expla- nations wherein there are a limited number of transgen- der/transsexual ;'types" and part of the clinician's task is to determine which type applies in a given case. The overriding tenor of this volume stays generally within a transpositive epistemological framework yet there are other pockets of potentially pathologizing work. For example, Seil's chapter delineating four subgroups of transgendered patients felt especially out of place. Without making the basis for his assertions clear, he argues "GID varies little in substance from one person to another within each subgroup of patients" (p. 102) some- thing with which many transgendered people (and I sus- pect some experienced clinicians) might take issue. He also sometimes relies on simplistic and pathologizing explanations for aspects of his patients' behaviors and identities; for example, he explains drug and alcohol use with vague references to sClifestyle." And while the edi- tors and some of the authors mention the social pressures and hostile culture within which transgender/transsexual people live (see especially Rosario's concluding remarks, p. 96), more attention was needed to the effects of these factors on this population's mental health presentations and therapeutic needs. Even with the shortcomings that I have mentioned, taken as a whole Transgender Subyectivities can be placed among the ranks of a new breed of clinical handbooks that avoid pathology models of gender variance. The volume introduces the reader to a signif1cant range of transgender subjects, using a wide array of data, from several com- pelling perspectives. The "snapshots" that it shows us will be useful for both the seasoned clinician and for the less experienced reader. REFERENCES Ettner, R. (1999).

BEDBUG SPERM WARS The Story of V: A Natural History of Female Sexuality. By Catherine Blackledge. New Brunswick, NJ: Rutgers University Press 2004, 322 pages. Cloth, $24.95.

In my gynecologist's office there is a framed cartoon on the wall: several grinning sperm in hot pursuit of a fleeing, unhappy egg Such omnipresent and anthropomorphic mythology about males as sexually "active" and females as sexually "passive," especially with regard to genitalia and reproduction, must have driven Blackledge to prove them wrong. She writes, '4I wasn't satisfied with my perception of female genitalia, what I knew about the vagina" (p. 2). Why did having a vagina make her life different, even to the extent of being treated as a second-class citizen, from some- one without one? Why were female genitalia so understud- ied? Why so little research into female reproduchlon and so many contradictory scientific opinions? The publisher's press release about this book states: In the past, medicine may have misrepresented female anatomy, reducing its remarkable complexities to the notion of a passive vessel, but as The Story of V shows science is at last beginning to</page><page sequence="2">370 Book Reviews reveal the true structure and function of female genitalia and the dynamic nature of the vagina's role in both sexual pleasure and reproduction. Blackledge herself writes, For centuries, the notion of female genitalia as a passive vessel.... in part, explains why so little time and money has been expended in the past on Elguring out the actual structure and function of female genitalia. Yet the idea of the vagina as a passive vessel is possibly one of the greatest scientiE1c misconceptions of all (p. 3). Research has shown, she describes, how female choice is widespread at the vaginal/reproductive level: "Females store sperm, they eject sperm, they destroy sperm and they care- fully and precisely select the most genetically compatible sperm for them[selves] with their amazing genitalia" (p. 3). Blackledge, a science writer with a Ph.D. in chemistry, takes readers on a grand tour through prehistoric art, ancient history, linguistics, mythology and folklore, evolu- tionary theory, reproductive biology, and medicine. Chapters cover the history of vaginal representation across cultures; the history of descriptions, definitions, and terms for female genitalia; a cross-species look at feminine reproductive selection as manifested at the sperm/egg level; the clitoris; the vagina; connections between the genitalia and the nose/scent; and orgasm. Blackledge aims to show how history and culture have represented and misrepresented female genitalia, and how female organisms at all levels of the taxonomic tree are active rather than passive in the sexual/reproduction process. These are compelling goals, certainly relevant to the interests of many JSR readers, and her range of schol- arship, research, and factoids is impressive. Researchers into female sexuality may find the book a fascinating resource to check their own knowledge as well as a gold mine of examples to use for writing and teaching. For example, we learn that female mites and ticks require extensive oral stimulation from the male's mouthparts so that the female's vaginal opening swells sufficiently to accept the male's sperm packet (pp. 103-104). However, The Story of V has serious drawbacks both for professionals and for the interested public. First, Blackledge chooses specific themes (e.g., vaginal dis- play, impregnation, the clitoris, the vagina, female orgasm) and then for each one follows a dizzying sweep through history, cultures, and phyla, factoid piled on fac- toid, laundry list following laundry list. It's like a smor- gasbord of casseroles and tossed salads: everything's a mixture, and there are so many ingredients that I lost sight of all but her main point, that the female is active not passive. Things went by so quickly that I could nei- ther remember or understand, nor appreciate (or believe!), everything I read. Fewer but lengthier exam- ples would have been much more entertaining and under- standable, and less tedious. Furthermore, many of her descriptions are difficult to follow even with the illustra- tions, which unfortunately give only tantalizing snap- shots with little or no context. In her presentation, all context was left out to grant space for her agenda: the female is active. But her agenda would shine more pow- erfully if we could see context. Roadmaps to the argu- ment would help also, like more and better subheadings, some sidebars, and better introductory and concluding sections. A second primary problem is that Blackledge attributes agency and intent anthropomorphically to everything. Here's a typical bit of her prose: In order to weed out the unsuitable fertilisation candidates, the female's vagina presents a series of genitalic hurdles in the shape of her oviductal obstacle course. Only the sperm that can over- come all of these will have a chance of fusing with her egg.... [T]he vagina is an extremely hostile acidic arena, which easily destroys newcomers. It has to be if it wants to be selective (pp 109-1 10). This is her style throughout. Unfortunately, Blackledge buys into the cliches she deplores by using the same anthropomorphic framework to disprove them. But pas- sive vaginas aren't incorrect simply because vaginas are in fact active. Passive vaginas and female genitalia are factu- ally and logically incorrect, just as are active penises and male genitalia, because organs and body parts don't have psychology or intent or agency. What organs do is simply not describable in terms of human psychological states. And moreover, no organ system or body part "just lies there" in real life. This is a matter of style, not content. Many of her exam- ples are fascinating and do show that natural complexity trumps historical and cultural cliches of active vs. passive. But that is the point. She would have a far stronger case by disproving the active vs. passive framework rather than simply taking the opposite side of the argument. Third, she provides no way to check her statements and examples. There is a "Further Reading" bibliography at the end, with major books by chapter, but that doesn't help the reader who might want to find the original reference for a specific claim. This makes the book intensely frus- trating for the professional who might want to use her examples or explore them further. Although this book is subtitled a "natural history" and published by a university press, it is not what one would expect from good science writing. Science aims for understanding, not (only) pushing an agenda. It doesn't attribute intent to organs and body parts, and only cau- tiously to subhumans like bedbugs, and everything is ref- erenced. But perhaps The Story of V is pitched more to the intelligent public than to professionals in sexology. Blackledge could get away with this approach if the book was about 150 pages long and a "cool facts about female sexuality" sort of thing from a trade press, or a series of articles somewhere in a feminist journal or magazine. However, the complex and technical discussion, cascades of detailed examples, and sparse roadmaps through the narrative would likely discourage all but the most persis- tent and fascinated fans of femalia. This is not a book to give to young, sound-bite-habituated women needing a self-esteem boost.</page></plain_text>
