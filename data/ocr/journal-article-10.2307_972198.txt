<plain_text><page sequence="1">Proponents of many comparative models of craft specialization explain variability in the organization of production according to the nature of elite interest and economic demand. To this end, many propose a basic dichotomy between independent and attached specialization, whereby valued goods are produced for elites in controlled, nondomestic workshops. I examine new evidence for craft production in the prehispanic Andean polity of Tiwanaku (A.D. 500-1150). I outline expectations for these two forms of specialization and, based on ethnohistorical research in the Tiwanaku region, propose a thirdform, termed embed- ded specialization. I appraise primary evidence for the production of ceramic vessels at the site of Tiwanaku and the produc- tion of musical instruments at the nearby regional site of Lukurmata. Weighing expectations against evidence, I argue that in Tiwanaku centers many goods were produced by kin-based groups residing in large residential compounds. Skilled production served the overarching political economy and the demands of nonspecialists, but it was neither strictly independent of nor directly attached to elite interests. Craft was rooted in segmentary principles of sociopolitical order, and so was local but not wholly autonomous. On a comparative scale, I suggest that embedded production characterized some states emphasizing cor- porate strategies of political integration. La variabilidad en la organizacion de la produccion especializada de artesanias ha sido explicada mediante varios modelos com- parativos, los cuales se basan en la naturaleza de los intereses de la e'lite y las demandas de tipo economico. Para este tipo de interpretacion, muchos han propuesto la existencia de una dicotomia entre una especializacion de tipo "independiente" y otra "sujetada, " por medio de las cuales las artesanias de valor son producidas para las e'lites en talleres no dome'sticos controlados por ellos. En el presente trabajo se examina nueva evidencia para la produccion de artesanias en la unidad politica Andina pre- hispanica de Tiwanaku (500 d. C.-1150 d. C.). Tambien se propone que cada una de estas dos fo7mas de especializacion se expre- san en patrones arqueologicos, por lo que con base en investigaciones etnohisto'ricas en la region de Tiwanaku, se propone una tercera, que ha sido llamada "especializacion inclusiva." Se evalu'a entonces la evidencia directa para la produccion de vasijas cera'micas en el sitio de Tiwanaku, y la produccio'n de instrumentos musicales en el sitio cercano de Lukurmata. Comparando la hipo'tesis inicial con la evidencia, se argumenta que en los centros Tiwanaku, bastantes artesanias fueron producidas por grupos de pa rentesco que res idie ron en complejos residenciales de g ran tamano. Esta producc ion te'cn ica s irvio a la politica economica de la unidad politica en general y a las demandas de la poblacion no especializada, pero no fue estrictamente independiente ni directamente sudeta a los intereses de la e'lite. Por lo tanto, la produccion artesanal estuvo arraigada en principios segmentarios de orden sociopolitico, siendo local pero no totalmente autonoma. En una escala comparativa, se sugiere que la produccio'n de tipo "inclusiva" caracterizo a los estados que enfatizaron estrategias corporativas de integracio'n politica. John W.

This ongoing research is firmly laying to rest past assumptions while raising a whole new spectrum of questions, of which the nature of craft production is one of the most imme- diate and intriguing. Archaeologists for years have hypothesized that specialized craft production was an important dimension of Tiwanaku social and economic life (Browman 1978, 1981; Ponce 1981, 1991).

SOO initiated a dynamic phase of social and cultural transformation in the southern Lake Titicaca Basin of the south-central Andes (Figure 1). A recent surge of research in Tiwanaku's heartland is just beginning to clarify its ecological underpinnings, social organizations, religious systems, and political structures (Albar- racin-Jordan 1992,1996; Alconini 1995; Bermann 1990, 1994; Janusek 1994; Kolata 1991, 1993; Manzanilla 1992; Mathews 1992; Rivera 1994; - -</page><page sequence="2">108 LATIN AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 10, No. 2, 1999 A" ' .

Fol- lowing current models of craft production, archaeologists have considered the significance of specialized production as either manifestly mer- cantile or political. Browman (1978, 1981) argues that the city of Tiwanaku was a politically unde- veloped but economically successful "industrial hub" that housed "guilds of craftsmen." Ponce Sangines (1981, 1991), however, argues that Tiwanaku was a major political center at the head of a centralized, military state. Following Childe (1936, 1950), he believes that an emergent middle class of artisans manufactured elaborate goods and designed monumental buildings that directly sup- ported the power and authority of ruling elites. Because no primary evidence had been uncovered, however, the true nature of Tiwanaku craft pro- duction has remained a mystery. This paper presents primary evidence for craft production in the Tiwanaku polity. I examine spe- cialization in two major prehispanic urban centers of the southern Lake Titicaca Basin, Tiwanaku and Lukurmata, and I focus on the middle phases of Tiwanaku hegemony, the Late IV and Early V periods (A.D. 700-1000). I address key assump- tions that are embedded in many comparative models of specialized production. First, I address the typical assumption that valued goods were pro- duced by full-time specialists working in nondo- mestic workshops. Second, I address the assumption that valued goods were crafted by spe- cialists directly attached to ruling elites. In paral- lel with a host of ongoing research (Ames 1995; Costin 1998; Feinman and Nicholas 1995), I argue that in Tiwanaku such assumptions do not apply in all cases. I discuss specific limitations in apply- ing current comparative models to Tiwanaku and suggest that a model of embedded specialization, rooted in enduring Andean principles of social and economic order, best explains at least some spe- cialized activities here.</page><page sequence="3">Janusek] CRAFT AND LOCAL POWER: EMBEDDED SPECIALIZATION IN TIWANAKU CITIES 109 Craft and Complex Society in the Andes Browman's and Ponce's ideas about craft special- ization in Tiwanaku share a focus that developed early in the history of social thought. Ever since Durkheim (1933[1893]) correlated the rise of civi- lization with the division of labor, and Marx (1964 { 1953]) thedevelopmentofadvancedmodes of pro- duction with craft manufacture, anthropologists and archaeologists have linked occupational specializa- tion with emerging sociopolitical complexity (Adams 1966; Boas 1940; Childe 1936,1950; Red- man 1978; Rice 1981). Building on this long tradi- tion, most current archaeological research on specialization emphasizes "political models" (Brum- fiel 1987; BrumEiel and Earle 1987; D'Altroy and Earle 1985; Earle 1987; Heims 1979, 1993), grounded in the observation that rulers and their sup- porting institutions were frequently the principal ben- eficiaries of (because they often controlled) specialized production and redistribution. In these models, ruling elites both sponsor skilled craftspeo- ple and strategically distribute valued goods to enhance their own power. Essential to ruling author- ity are finely crafted and exotic goods (Brumfiel 1987; DeMarrais et al. 1996), especially sumptuary objects embodying divine power or distance (Helms 1979, 1993). In political models, archaeologists explain vari- ability in the organization of craft specialization by the nature of external demand and the degree of elite sponsorship. To this end, many posit a fundamental dichotomy between independent and attached spe- cialization (BrumEiel and Earle 1987:5; Clark and Parry 1990:298; Costin 1991 :7; Costin and Hagstrum 1995: 620; Earle 1981; Hagstrum 1985: 68, 1988: 127). Costin (1991) and Clark and Parry (1990) outline more complex typologies, but these still fol- low a primary dichotomy of independent and attached production (see Costin l991:Table 1.1; Clark and Parry l990:Table 1). Independent spe- cialists "produce goods or services for an unspeci- fied demand crowd," while attached specialists "produce goods [for] or provide services to a patron, typically either a social elite or a governing institu- tion" (BrumEiel and Earle 1987:5; based on Earle 1981; cf. Clark and Parry 1990). Independent spe- cialization serves broad demand, attached special- ization elite interests. So independent specialists tend to produce utilitarian goods that "serve basic house- hold needs," and attached specialists sumptuary goods, appropriate for social display. Utilitarian goods tend to be produced in dispersed households, sumptuary goods in special workshops (BrumEiel 1987; Clark and Parry 1990:302; Costin 1991:5; Costin and Hagstrum 1995 :620; Hagstrum 1988:127; Sinopoli 1988). In the end, the organiza- tion of production and the types of goods produced largely follow from the nature of someone else's needs and interests. Such models are directly relevant to interpreta- tions of craft production in the Tiwanaku polity. Some archaeologists have claimed that Tiwanaku developed primarily as a central hub and depot for entrepreneurial trade networks crisscrossing the alti- plano (Browman 1978, 1981; Nunez and Dillehay 1979). They focus attention on the vast economic net- works converging on Tiwanaku and the cardinal role played by camelids as pack animals in the altiplano. Following these ideas, dominance over trade net- works and a prestigious religious cult (Browman 1978; Torres 1985) were keys to Tiwanaku expan- sion and influence. Substantial archaeological research increasingly supports the idea that Tiwanaku was the first politically centralized state in the south- centralAndes (Janusek 1994; Kolata 1986; Mathews 1992; Ponce 1981; Stanish 1994). Tiwanaku and its core regional settlements, if centers of trade and reli- gious inspiration, also were densely populated cen- ters of ruling power and elite ritual. In applying political models to Tiwanaku, in par- ticular Ponce's hypothesis, we expect that artisans producing highly valued goods would have been directly attached to ruling elites (Kolata 1993: 169-172; Ponce 1991). Production would have been organized as nucleated workshop industries (Costin 1991) that should demonstrate archaeolog- ically visible linkages to elite groups. The crafted objects would have been relatively elaborate, dis- tributed almost exclusively to high-status contexts. The finished goods themselves, because produced by restricted and controlled groups of specialists, should be relatively standard (see Feinman et al.1984; Rice 1987:201-204). We expect that specialists producing goods strictly for household use, on the other hand, would have worked independently of elites or state control. Production would have been autonomous, the domain of dispersed workshops or individual house- holds. We expect that production was for open</page><page sequence="4">LATIN AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 10, No. 2,1999 110 because they travel to foreign lands to acquire mate- rials and promote their wares. Further, through the practice of skilled crafting, artisans come to be iden- tified with their livelihood and the things they make and use (Costin 1998; Csikszentmihalyi and Rochberg-Halton 1981:1). Artisans in a real sense forge their social identity. A wealth of ethnohistorical documents and ethnographic studies in the high southern Andes, the homeland of the Tiwanaku polity, sets the foun- dation for an approach to prehispanic crafting that stresses social context as well as demand. At the time of European contact, the altiplano supported loosely coalescing segmentary polities, in which economic organization and social power were dis- tributed among constituent, mutually nested ayl- lus (Figure 2) (e.g., Abercrombie 1986:24-101; Izko 1992:75-80; Parssinen 1992:351-362; Platt 1982:50,1987; Rasnake 1987:49-64; Rivera Cusi- canqui 1992:102-22; Salomon 1991:21-23).Ayllu, the basic principle of social structure, referred to a corporate group composed of kin by blood or fab- rication which shared common resources and ancestors. In practice, though, ayllu was a slippery term referring to any of several levels of nested grouping, each with its own contexts for social identity, and each with unique functions and orga- nizational characteristics. An encompassing macro-ayllu, much like an ethnic group, shared a common ancestor and social identity, but gathered largely during political confrontations and major rituals (Izko 1992). Minor ayllus and their con- stituent communities, at the base of an embedded social order, more effectively acted as corporate groups to the extent that, in addition, each shared and distributed certain basic responsibilities and productive resources. A minor ayllu's role in the ecologically diverse Andes, where markets in gen- eral were insignificant (see Earle 1985; Murra 1980), was preeminently the corporate ownership, production, and redistribution of resources. It was such a corporate organization, represented by an elected local leader, that specialized in the pro- duction of a specific good, such as ceramic ves- sels, textiles, or metals (e.g., Mercado de Penalosa 1965:56[1593]). Because nesting, segmentation, and local leadership were basic principles of social organization, most specialized ayllus were neither directly attached to ruling elites nor engaged in open market exchange. o * o = Micro-ayllus, estancias, or communities Figure 2: Schematic model of Andean ayllu organization. demand7 so crafted goods would have been relatively well distributed across different residential contexts. The finished goods themselves, because production involved many different groups and was not cen- trally controlled, should vary significantly. Political models have fostered a comparative understanding about important differences in the nature of specialized production. Many ethnographic studies, nevertheless, caution against condensing social activity, even activity as manifestly economic as consumption or specialized production, into a reflex of economic demand and political interest (see Appadurai 1986; DeBoer 1984; Douglas and Isher- wood 1979; Fernandez 1982; Helms 1993; Mintz 1985; Sahlins 1981). Interwoven with the demands and interests motivating craft production are the var- ious social networks and identities maintained by the specialists themselves, and the artistic qualities and symbolic codes embodied in their crafted goods. Any craft, whether woven mantles in Peru or blues in a Chicago pub, is important in ways that intertwine with, and go far beyond, strictly economic and polit- ical concerns. Helms (1993) demonstrates through cross-cultural comparison that skilled crafting, while clearly an economic activity that often supports dom- inant political factions, is fundamentally a creative activity with deep social and cosmological dimen- sions (Helms 1993). Craftspeople often enjoy spe- cial status because they create significant things, or</page><page sequence="5">Janusek] CRAFT AND LOCAL POWER: EMBEDDED SPECIALIZATION IN TIWANAKU CITIES lll 0 1 km Figure 3: Plan of Tiwanaku showing the relative location of some excavated residential areas: Putuni (I), Akapana East 1M (II), Akapana East 1 (III), Akapana East 2 (IV), and Chtiji Jawira (V). (Contour map courtesy of Alan Kolata) Archaeological research into patterns of rural (Albarracin-Jordan 1992, 1996) and urban settle- ment (Janusek 1994) hints that such an organiza- tion had already developed by the IV and V periods in Tiwanaku. This type of social order, if it char- acterized craft production in the Tiwanaku polity, should have left highly detectable clues. First, skilled crafting of most valued objects appropriate for display would have been under the authority of local leaders, and so outside of direct elite control. In many regions of the later Inka state only the most elaborate sumptuary goods, such as royal cumpi tunics, were directly controlled by central authori- ties (see Costin et al. 1989; Murra 1980). At the same time, because individual households formed larger corporate groups within a nonmarket econ- omy, the production of very few goods would have been truly independent of suprahousehold control or demand. Still, production would have been con- ducted by groups of households alongside other domestic activities. Second, each group of specialists would have maintained an assemblage of material goods distin- guished from others in style. Later in the southern Andes, an ayllu at any level established its identity in relation to others by employing distinct styles of language, woven clothing, serving vessels, or even cranial deformation (Abercrombie 1986; Blom et al. 1998; Cereceda et al. 1993; Gisbert et al. 1992; Hoshower et al. 1995). Stylistic differences thrived within a broader field of commonly accepted stylis- tic patterns. The key vehicles for expressing style were items on public display, such as the human body, and goods used in feasts and social gatherings (see also Hebdige 1979; Hodder 1982; Pollock 1983:364; Smith 1987; Wiessner 1983, 1990). In Tiwanaku, we can hypothesize, feasts would have been times when style actively helped group mem- bers mark their identities (see DeBoer 1990; DeBoer and Moore 1982) or promote their prestige (see Smith 1987:312-314) relative to others. We should expect to find, perhaps within more broadly shared</page><page sequence="6">LATIN AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 10, No. 2, 1999 112 and other valued goods with display value, and com- pare each assemblage with others. The primary evi- dence, from two separate locations, allows us at last to approach the organization of production in Tiwanaku and to question key assumptions embed- ded in current models of specialization in general. Residential Patterns in Tiwanaku Urban Centers The Tiwanaku polity flourished between the IV (A.D. 500-800) and V (A.D. 800-1150) periods. Regional studies indicate that Tiwanaku rulers estab- lished political hegemony in the Lake Titicaca Basin by incorporating existing organizations and creating new institutions of state power (Bermann 1994; Janusek 1994; Kolata 1991; Stanish 1994; but cf. Ericksonl988,1993;Isbelll995),especiallyinthe Tiwanaku (Albarracin-Jordan 1992; Mathews 1992) and KatariValleys (Binford et al.1997; Janusek and Kolata 1999; Kolata 1986, 1991; Ortloff and Kolata 1989; Seddon 1994). The ruins of the principal cen- ter, the site of Tiwanaku, cover more than 6 km2 in the southeastern Lake TiticacaBasin (Figure 3). Thir- teen kilometers to the north is Lukurmata, an ancient lake shore settlement that was gradually incorpo- rated into the expanding polity (Bermann 1994), and eventually covered 2 km2. Both settlements expanded into extensive urban and ceremonial centers after A.D. 600 (Janusek 1994). Broad excavations in eight areas of Tiwanaku, and three in Lukurmata, consistently exposed sections of spatially bounded residential sectors (Janusek 1994). Architectural and artifact patterns indicated that walled compounds or barrios formed the most salient unit of social differentiation in each site. On the ground, each compound consisted of a large perime- ter wall enclosing one or more domestic structures and various activity areas, as exemplified in theAka- pana East 1 sector of Tiwanaku (Figure 4). Such compound units, it appears, incorporated several minimal households, a fundamental activity unit rep- resented by a dwelling and its associated ancillary structures, activity areas, and middens. Compounds differed greatly in size, spatial organization, and activities, suggesting that the nature of resident social groups varied accordingly. Overall uniformity in material culture empha- sized the pervasive order and overarching political community that linked spatially segregated urban landscapes. First, all excavated urban architecture, Structure 2 Structure 1 N7852 E535 j /Compound Wall I N I , 4 6 8 M I = Intrusive Pit Figure 4: Excavated area in Akapana East 1M, Tiwanaku. patterns of style, significant stylistic differences between the assemblages of display goods used by craft specialists and others. To test comparative and ethnohistorical models, it will be important to determine the organization of craft production by examining its in situ manifesta- tion. Fortunately, recent excavations have exposed two centers with evidence for craft production, one in Tiwanaku, the other in Lukurmata. I discuss the key characteristics of each center: its relative location, whether near monumental/elite complexes or in set- tlement peripheries; its degree of concentration, whether nucleated or dispersed; its composition, whether household or workshop; and its social con- text and role in the broader political economy, whether independent, attached, orotherwise (see Costin 1991; Peacock 1982; Sinopoli 1988; van der Leeuw 1977). I also examine the goods both made and used by craft specialists. First, it is important to determine their purpose and social value, whether sumptuary or util- itarian, and whether for public or strictly domestic contexts. Second, I compare the style and composi- tion of goods used by specialists. In particular, I exam- ine the stylistic patterns of ceramic serving vessels</page><page sequence="7">cffi sW - 8 ok sv C D - JRcros T C Es Vasips RcBowls _ w BW R_veds C D@ b I__ IllconwHo *ccguved Bowt Walw Rctrao Ssh§r Janusek] CRAFT AND LOCAL POWER: EMBEDDED SPECIALIZATION IN TIWANAKU CITIES 113 ceremonial and domestic, followed a common direc- tional orientation roughly ten degrees east of north (see Figure 4 and plans in Janusek 1994). Second, objects displaying an elaborate style, most visibly elegant serving vessels such as chalices (keros) and bowls (tazones) (Figure 5),l were widely distributed throughout both urban centers (Alconini 1995; JanusekandAlconini 1994,1999).Theiconographic motifs painted on the red-slipped vessel surfaces, while varying in detail, adhered to certain canons of decoration during each time period, defining a uni- form style. Third, all known households, elite and commoner, shared a composite of practices, from weaving to burying fetal camelid offerings under floors, that describe a shared Tiwanaku domestic life (Bermann 1994; Janusek 1994). Tiwanaku cities, from the perspective of these patterns, appear to have been highly ordered and characterized by conformity. Inhabiting them were peoples who with elaborate material items advertised the ambitious state culture promoted by ruling elites, in part through a well-defined ceramic and icono- graphic style. However, closer observation reveals intricate details of differentiation alongside these patterns of conformity. These details, when consid- ered from the perspective of urban craft production, challenge traditional ideas about Tiwanaku social and economic organization. Ceramic Production and Social Diversity in Tiwanaku Ceramic Production in Ch'iji Jawira Recent excavations and analyses revealed direct evi- dence for craft production in the Ch'iji Jawira sec- tor of the Tiwanaku capital, an area most thoroughly researched by Claudia Rivera (Rivera 1994; also Alconini 1995:190-204; Franke 1995; Janusek and Alconini 1994; Kolata 1993:170-172).2 The area, a low mound of 1.2 ha at the far eastern edge of the site, and more than 1.5 km east of the monumental core (Figure 3), yielded an extremely high surface density of ceramic sherds and partially baked amor- phous clay nodules. Ch'iji Jawira was occupied throughout the Late IV and Early V periods (A.D. 700-1000) (Rivera 1994). Excavations yielded several adobe structure foun- dations oriented about eight degrees east of north, following the monumental edifices in the center, and these were associated with storage pits, refuse mid- Figure 5: Chart showing major classes, types, and variants of Tiwanaku-style ceramic vessels. dens, burials, and ceramic offerings (Rivera 1994:Figure 8.12). Becausetheareawas severelydis- turbed by postdepositional adobe quarrying and dumping, however, the precise character and num- ber of domestic units remain unknown. Still, undis- turbed contexts yielded high densities of cooking and storage vessel sherds (75 percent of assem- blages), weaving tools, lithic flakes and cores, and ground stone tools to prepare food, indicating the importance of domestic activity (Franke 1995:117-118; Rivera 1994:208). Implements and by-products of ceramic manu- facture, absent in every other excavated sector of the site, appeared throughout the excavated mound (Rivera 1994). Three fragments of plaster molds, all for modelled zoomorphic heads applied to keros and incensarios, accompanied numerous worn burnish- ing and polishing implements of ceramic and stone, many of which were still covered with clay residue. Yellow, red, and green-based pigments were found in clumps and caked to vessel bases, each hue, as tests revealed,3 a purified mixture of various miner-</page><page sequence="8"> X :S :SS Figure 6: Slumped tazon decorated with a collared llama - (photo by Wolfgang Schuler). LATIN AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 10, No. 2,1999 114 Figure 7: View of baked surface (outlined) in Ch'iji Jawira (photo by Wolfgang Schuler). The evidence for relatively informal firing tech- nologies is not surprising, as a great deal of recent research indicates. Ceramic specialists today in the Andes typically fire vessels in temporary enclosures, a practice that leaves burnt floors very much like the baked floor in Ch'iji Jawira (e.g., Mohr-Chavez 1984-1985:171, 1992:Figure 3.8; Ravines 1978:45S457; Sillar 1988). Few permanent kilns have been reported (but see Rice 1987:159), and fewer still from archaeological contexts (e.g., Rus- sell 1994). Recent research into prehispanic Mesoamerican ceramic firing practices (Balkansky et al. 1997) strongly suggests that archaeologists, in the search for permanent kilns, have overlooked evi- dence for informal firing, which may have been most common in the past. Such firing may leave only a conjunction of patterns that, individually, would be nondiagnostic: firepits and associated middens filled with ash, carbon, high quantities of sherds, wasters, and clay nodules, as found in Tiwanaku. The addi- tional presence of tools and molds in Tiwanaku makes a strong case for production via informal fir- ing technologies. Ch'iji Jawira was inhabited by a group that per- formed both domestic and craft activities. Situated in the far outskirts of Tiwanaku, it was ideally located for ceramic production, near a semipermanent water supply and down site from the prevailing northwest winds. Architectural alignment and domestic activ- ities repeated those found elsewhere in Tiwanaku. However, nowhere else in Tiwanaku has surface reconnaissance (Sutherland 1991) or excavation recovered evidence for ceramic production. The neg- ative evidence indicates that ceramic production was specialized and that the goods produced by special-  als. Misfired wasters and slumped serving vessels (Figure 6), which were simply absent in other exca- vated residential areas, represented approximately 8 per cent of all vessel sherds. Excavations revealed that vessels were fired in open enclosures and small pit kilns (Franke 1995; Rivera 1994). An extensive baked orange floor 2.3 m in diameter was covered and surrounded by immense quantities of ash, baked adobe, carbonized dung, and ceramic artifacts (Figure 7) (Rivera 1994:Figure 8.27). Eighty percent of the ceramic artifacts in these deposits represented wasters and partially baked clay lumps (Rivera 1994:96). No other residential context revealed a burnt area so extensive, or any production by-product. Several shallow pits with evidence for burning, and filled or covered with ash, dung, sherds, and wasters, were located throughout the mound (Franke 1995). These are reminiscent of the shallow firing pits described in the prehistoric U.S. Southwest (Sulli- van 1988) and the pit kilns described in prehispanic Mesoamerica (Balkansky et al. 1997; Sheehy 1992). Archaeobotanical analysis revealed that camelid dung and hardy grasses, the fuels preferred by ceramic producers in many Andean communi- ties today (e.g., Mohr-Chavez 1992; Winterhalder et al. 1974), were far denser in Ch'iji Jawira mid- dens than anywhere else in Tiwanaku (Wright et al. 1999).</page><page sequence="9">Janusek] CRAFT AND LOCAL POWER: EMBEDDED SPECIALIZATION IN TIWANAKU CITIES 115 ized groups were distnbuted to at least some non- specialists. SpatiaZ Segregation and Ceramic Diversity in Tiwanaku A conjunction of spatial and artifactual patterns indi- cated that the residents of Ch'iji Jawira also formed a group that maintained its own social identity in the urban center. A canal 10 m wide and a large com- pound wall separated Ch'iji Jawira from the rest of the site (Rivera 1994:95). Evidence for production, in molds, wasters, and slumped vessels, indicates that the residents crafted at least two serving types, tazones and keros with modelled figures (Figures 6, 8a, and 8b). The wares both produced and used here were collectively unique vis-a-vis assemblages in other residential areas. Llama motifs were common on tazones and ceremonial vessels from local offer- ings, and even appear on slumped vessels (Rivera 1994: 163; alsoAlconini 1995: 198-199; Janusek and Alconini 1994). These representations were appar- ent on approximately 20 percent of vessels without geometric iconography, and were extremely uncom- mon-composing far less than 1 percent of such ves- sels in any other residential or ceremonial context (Janusek and Alconini 1994). In addition, residents of Ch'iji Jawira obtained and used vessels associated with contemporaneous, little-known cultures in the valleys southeast of the altiplano. These included serving wares in the so-called "derived" (Bennett 1936:402) or"expansive" style (Ponce 1981) char- acteristic of Tiwanaku-related vessels from the warm Cochabamba valleys (Figure 8c) (Ryden 1959).4 These composed approximately 18 percent of the serving wares, far higher than any other excavated residential context (Janusek and Alconini 1994). The ceramic assemblages of Ch'iji Jawira were distinct from those of other areas. Assemblages from any other residential or ceremonial area in Tiwanaku displayed, in turn, their own characteristics (Janusek and Alconini 1994). Style differed most notably among serving wares, those frequently on display. Serving wares from domestic contexts in Akapana East 1M, in the urban core, differed collectively in style from those in Ch'iji Jawira. Only one of the tazon sherds encountered here portrayed a camelid image, and derived style never composed more than a few sherds in any occupation phase (see Alconini 1995:Figures 83-89; Janusek 1994:Figures 7.11-7.13). Further, in Akapana East 72 percent of A  B 0 5 cm c Figure 8: Serving wares from Ch'iji Jawira: ceremonial vessel with a mythical camelid (a), tazon with collared camelid (b), and derived-style tazones (c) (adapted from Alconini 1995:Figure 74; Rivera 1994:Figures 12.1 and 12.2). serving vessel sherds (n = 1366) had red slip, the hall- mark of Tiwanaku style. By contrast, in Ch'iji Jawira only 23 percent of such sherds (n = 5003) had red slip. Specialized analyses of other material patterns corroborate the ceramic evidence for diversity in Tiwanaku. Archaeobotanical analysis indicated that Ch'iji Jawira differed significantly from other exca- vated residential compounds in the frequency and distribution of tubers, maize, and chenopodium seeds (Wright et al. 1999). The residents of this compound, like other groups, maintained a distinct diet and dif- ferential access to food resources. Further, ongoing bioarchaeological research is determining that each residential sector, including Ch'iji Jawira, differed significantly from others in the styles of cranial defor- mation and the suites of genetic traits that charac- terized humans buried near its house floors (Blom et al. 1997). Ch'iji Jawira residents, therefore, were spatially, stylistically, and even biologically distinct from other residential sectors in Tiwanaku. In addition to pro- ducing ceramics, they used a suite of serving wares collectively distinct from others in Tiwanaku. Such C--S-) r . mo. , wsiN,2 Int.

Although specula- tive, the consistent presence of these vessels points to the possibility that, via llama caravans, the spe- cialists interacted with and were perhaps affiliated with groups near Cochabamba. Panpipe Production and Social Identity in Lukurmata Residential Workshop Occupations in Misiton The best direct evidence for craft production in the Tiwanaku heartland comes from Lukurmata (Fig- ure 9). Lukurmata, an extensive site with a long his- tory of occupation, was incorporated by A.D. 600 into the growing sphere of Tiwanaku hegemony. Tiwanaku period occupations were marked by the building of a monumental complex, essentially a reduced version of Tiwanaku's monumental core (Bennett 1936; Rivera 1989), surrounded by ceme- teries, ritual places, and spatially segregated resi- dential areas all overwhelmingly affiliated with Tiwanaku-style objects and activities (Bermann 1994; Janusek 1994; Janusek and Earnest 1990; Wise 1993).

Excavations in Misiton exposed a long-occupied household workshop in which Andean panpipes, or sikus, were crafted. A deep test unit revealed six superimposed occupation floors, the earliest one on sterile subsoil (see Janusek 1993). A charcoal frag- ment on the first floor provided a corrected, calibrated radiocarbon date of 1290 + 100 B.P. (Beta-55490; A.D. 737 + 112, Stuiver and Pearson 1993) center- ing in the IV period. Extensive excavations in the last two occupations revealed a complex of structures and activity areas that exhibited increasing spatial seg- regation through time (see Figures 10 and 11). The complex was oriented about 12 degrees east of the cardinal directions, just slightly steeper than the ori- entation of other architectural complexes in ,^. . . T . , . llwanaKu ancl LuKurmata. racn occupatlon con-. sisted of a thin.trampled surface of compact sandy clay, and cobble foundations supporting adobe struc- tures. The large outer wall foundations, three to four courses high, clearly defined the north and west sides of a compound. The penultimate occupation of the compound consisted of two patios and three structures (Figure 10). The wall dividing the patios was absent in the preceding occupation, so this division was relatively late. Patio 1 abutted a large structure (Structure 1) with foundations of yellow clay at the south edge of the patio dividing wall. The structure rested on a sub- stantial foundation and included a hearth and asso- ciated domestic artifacts, indicating that it was a dwelling. The shift to the final occupation in the compound was marked by new surfaces and increasing spatial segmentation (Figure 1 1). The construction of a new rectangular structure (Structure 4) and several smaller wall segments divided old Patio 1 into four distinct spaces. Charcoal from above Patio 1 yielded a corrected, calibrated radiocarbon date of 1110 + 200 BP (Beta-55487; A.D. 967 + 238, Stuiver and Pearson 1993), with a huge standard deviation. Sev- eral meters west of the compound, past an outdoor refuse midden, was another domestic structure (Janusek 1994:Figure 8.13). The Misiton complex became more segmented over time, most notably in the addition of a wall that divided one open patio into two separate patio groups. Structure 4 and Structure 2, one in each patio,</page><page sequence="12"> I | L  r 5== 118 LATIN AMERICAN ANTIQUITY lVol. 10, No. 2, 1999 A B c o  4  m Figure 12: Ad hoo implements for crafting bone flutes: lithic knives (a), polishing pebbles and sherds (b), a camelid- pelvis cutting surface (c), and camelid rib tools (d). were comparable in size, form, and probably func- tion. The dividing wall may have marked the fis- sioning of an early group into two separate household patio groups. Across cultures, the increasing segre- gation of domestic space is often associated with growing pressure for space in urban environments (Kent 1990). Misiton may have housed an increas- ing number of households over time. Throughout the entire sequence, artifacts across the compound, and particularly in the patios, repre- sented a great variety of domestic activities, includ- ing food preparation, consumption, and weaving. Alongside these artifacts were artifacts associated with a specific type of craft production; severed camelid long bones and long bone ends, quartzite knives, worn pebbles, and polished camelid ribs (Fig- l  - I .,0 tS at 1s XU Wt !v f_ tU J q / - - - D</page><page sequence="13">Janusek] CRAFT AND LOCAL POWER: EMBEDDED SPECIALIZATION IN TIWANAKU CITIES 119 - l F t A ix -e r,c; C, '-, 6..'' / ^ lF , ,[' I X f I hl; L' I {. _, Figure 13: Bone flutes from the structure-four cache graded by size. ure 12). The patterns were repeated in the nearby domestic structure, indicating that craft production was an important activity for a small neighborhood of households in Lukurmata's urban periphery. Panpipe Specialists in Lukurmata The household groups residing in Misiton engaged in the production of Andean panpipes (Janusek 1993, 1994, 1996). Several artifact clusters in the final occupation hinted at the nature of the craft. In Patio 1, we located a group of seven bone tubes ranging from 7.3 to 12.7 cm long, near severed long bone ends and a camelid-rib tool. In Structure 2, we located seven bone tubes, some long bone ends, quartzite knives, polishing pebbles, and short lengths of bone severed at both ends ("tuning lengths," described below). Between Structure 4 and the west compound wall we located, side by side, a cutting platform crafted out of a camelid pelvis and a complete bone tube (Figure 12c). We also located a group of 25 bone tubes, ranging from 7.8 to 19.5 cm in length (Figure 13), in the north side of Structure 4, alongside sev- eral tuning lengths and long bone ends. Clearly, camelid bones were being cut and cleaned to form hollow tubes. The bone tubes apparently were used as musical instruments. Each group of tubes was characterized by a graded variation in length that corresponded to tone variation; tone variation emphasized the notes of E, A, B, and C-sharp (see Janusek 1993:Table 1). In addition, when tube ends were polished, as they were in many cases, the polished end was always the smaller opening. The smaller end always produced the best tone and was the easiest to play. In other types of Tiwanaku bone tubes, the larger end was polished (see Janusek 1994:Fig. 10.18). Further, the tubes were all within the size range of known contempo- rary and prehispanic panpipes, and all that were intact produced a clear musical tone. The tubes, along with their severed ends and shafts, often displayed straight, deep cut marks near their ends, oriented perpendicular to the lengths of the bones (see Figures 13 and 14). These highly pat- terned cut marks differed from the hatched butcher- gi</page><page sequence="14">[Vol. 10, No. 2, 1999 120 LATIN AMERICAN ANTIQUITY _DD. - - - t;U A  ,/=3 ing marks commonly found on faunal remains (Web- ster 1993:22S336). Substantial forethought pre- ceded the final creation of a tube length, in an apparent effort to achieve a particular length and tone. Similar notches are cut on cane and wood tubes by instrument specialists in the contemporary Aymara community of Walata, located in the Oma- suyos highlands on the east side of Lake Titicaca (Gutierrez 1991:150). The notches, based on set mea- surements, mark where orifices will be placed in a quena or pinkillu flute, or where lengths of cane will be cut to form panpipes. Production by-products composed a substantial proportion of the artifacts found in and around the compounds (Figure 14; Table 1). Severed long bone ends from all classes of camelid limb bones were most common, followed by broken sections of the flutes themselves. A particularly significant type of by-product consisted of short segments of bone sev- ered at both ends. The ubiquity of these artifacts inside the compound and in nearby middens illus- trates the importance given to specific tube lengths. These short "tuning lengths," absent in other resi- dential areas, are difficult to explain if the crafts- people were making snuff tubes, containers, handles, or any other type of tube in which exact lengths are srl _L r.s  B 0 5 Figure 14: Craft production by-product (desecho): severed long bone ends (a), and tuning lengths severed at both ends (b).</page><page sequence="15">Table 1: Frequencies of worked faunal bones from Misiton and Akapana East.

They are most parsimoniously explained as the material consequence of creating specific, desired tones through trial and error. Various tools consistently accompanied the flute clusters (Figure 12). Worn camelid ribs, uncommon in other residential contexts, probably served to clean the interiors of the tubes. Quickly retouched cobble flakes, generally of quartzite or chert, served as knives to perform the actual cutting, and pebbles and ceramic sherds were employed as implements to bur- nish the "mouthpieces" of the instruments. The pro- portion of chipped stone cutting and polishing tools relative to other stone artifacts was highly significant relative to the proportion in Akapana East (Table 2; chi-square = 65.91109, df = 1, p=.OOOOO). Further, the proportion of total worked bone related to flute production, relative to other types of worked bone, was highly significant when compared to the worked bone found in Akapana East (Table 1; chi-square = 55.62532, df = 1, p=.OOOOO). Andean panpipes are known from prehispanic contexts throughout the south-central Andes, but they are generally made of ceramic, stone, or cane (e.g., Bolanos 1988; Haeberli 1979; Iribarren 1969). Cane panpipes are especially common in Tiwanaku-affil- iated burials from the dry regions of northern Chile and northwestern Argentina, correlating with the dis- tribution of the ritually charged "hallucinogenic com- plex" (e.g., Grebe 1974:43-44; Nunez 1963:155-156).

Spatial Segregation and Ceramic Diversity in Lukurmata The Misiton area, at the edge of urban settlement like Ch'iji Jawira, was residence and workshop for spe- cialists residing in architecturally bounded household compounds. Excavations revealed segments of two distinct, architecturally segregated domestic work- shop units. These occupied the north edge of a shal- low terrace that continued another 90 m to the west and 100 m to the east. Although verification must await further research, the extent of the terrace sug- gests that the households formed part of a larger neighborhood of resident specialists. As in Ch'iji Jawira, the intensity of production is unclear, and it may be that only certain members of a household were directly engaged in flute manufacture. Various types of finished bone flutes, including panpipe tubes, have been found in other residential contexts atTiwanakuandLukurmata(Janusek 1993:21).The inhabitants of Misiton, the only context that yielded evidence for flute production, were apparently not the only people who played them. Still, bone flutes have not been encountered in elite or monumental contexts at Tiwanaku or Lukurmata. Ceramic style and technology, in addition to archi- tecture and urban space, distinguished the Misiton inhabitants as a compound group with its own social identity and economic resources. At a broad level, Janusekl CRAFT AND LOCAL POWER: EMBEDDED SPECIALIZATION IN TIWANAKU CITIES 121</page><page sequence="16">LATIN AMERICAN ANTIQUITY A F B C D G 0 5 cm E H I Figure 15: Serving ware variants from Misiton I, Lukurmata: tanware kero (a), tanware tazon with continuous volute (b), redware tazon with continuous volute (c), decorated cuencos showing nonlocal influence (d and e), nonlocal wares (f, g, and h), and a "hybrid" jar with classic Tiwanaku-style neck and Yampara-style effigy body (i). Tiwanaku style predominated throughout Lukur- mata. Tiwanaku-style iconography in feline, avian, and anthropomorphic themes were displayed on serving and ceremonial vessels, and most Tiwanaku ceramic forms were represented in the assemblages. By continually acquiring and using such vessels, res- idents of Lukurmata created and affirmed their affil- iation with Tiwanaku, the dominant political and cultural force for several hundred years. Neverthe- less, the specialists employed a varied ceramic inven- tory that helped establish themselves as a distinct group in relation to other corporate groups in Lukur- mata, while they shared common elements of a "Lukurmata style" with other groups that distin- guished the entire urban community from Tiwanaku. The inhabitants of Lukurmata collectively employed a unique range of serving vessels, con- sisting of subtle twists on Tiwanaku style. Distinc- tive attributes include tanware vessels (Bermann 1990:250-252; Janusek 1994:191), often decorated with delicate volute motifs on a highly polished, unslipped beige paste (Figure 15a and 15b); serving wares decorated with continuous volute motifs (Fig- ure 15b and 15c); modelled puma incensarios, com- mon in Lukurmata burials and offerings (Bermann 1994; Janusek and Earnest 1990); elaborate cuencos (Figure 15d and 15e); and carinated basins. Lukurmata-style serving vessel sherds accounted for 35 percent of the Misiton assemblages. Relative to conventional Tiwanaku sherds, their occurrence is extremely significant when compared to their min- imal presence in Akapana East (Table 3; chi-square Table 3: Frequencies of certain ceramic variants in Misiton and Akapana East.

Bioarchaeology, once again, corroborates ceramic differentiation between Lukurmata andTiwanaku. Blom's (1997 et al.) analysis of cranial deformation indicates that Lukurmata's inhabitants employed a single style of deformation, an annular type, that differed from most of the varied styles found throughout Tiwanaku. Serving assemblages also varied significantly between sectors of Lukurmata. Late IV occupations on the ridge (Bermann 1994), in Misiton II (Janusek 1994), and in K'atupata (Janusek and Eamest 1990) provide comparisons (see Figure 9). In Misiton II, Lukurmata types accounted for only 18 percent of vessels, and in K'atupata middens over 80 percent. Tanware decorative variants on the ridge top occu- pations often included star and "feline-spot" motifs (see Bermann 1994: 170) that were absent elsewhere. Redware tazones in the last two occupations of Misi- ton, meanwhile, included a small (7 percent of dec- orated tazones) but well-distributed sample decorated with a snarling feline (Janusek 1994:262) that is absent elsewhere. Ceremonial and special serving forms also varied in frequency; for example, cari- nated basins were infrequent (far less than 1 percent of serving wares) in Misiton but composed over 10 percent of serving ware sherds in K'atupata. Misiton inhabitants, and those on the ridge, also obtained and used small but consistent proportions of non-Tiwanaku serving vessels both from and inspired by eastern valley cultures (Figure l5f, l5g, and l5h). The proportion (4 percent of serving wares; 6 percent of combined tazones, vasijas, and cuen- cos) of such vessels in Misiton was significant rela- tive to their presence in Akapana East (chi square = 53.51237, df = 1, p = .00000), and they were well distributed throughout the compound and its middens (49 percent of excavated contexts). Nonlocal vessels were not found in K'atupata. One vessel from Misi- ton (Figure 15i) combined a gourd or fruit effigy body, typical of the Yampara style in southern Bolivia, and a vessel neck decorated by a classic Tiwanaku avian motif on deep red slip. The Misiton specialists may have maintained some interaction, however indirect, with nonlocal populations. Attributes of vessel composition varied with styl- istic diversity. Paste analysis indicated that, while many serving and storage wares from Misiton incor- porated compact orange pastes like those from Tiwanaku, high proportions (about 34 percent) were made in a soft tan paste (7.5YR 5/4) with dark sand inclusions (Janusek and Alconini 1994). I^his is the fine paste displayed on Lukurmata tanwares. Also, the pastes of many larger vessels, such as tinajas and basins, incorporated fiber inclusions. Fiber temper had been common since the Middle Formative period (800-200 B.C.) among lakeshore sites (Bermann 1990:66; Browman 1981); although it continued to be employed in Lukurmata well after A.D. 600, it was rare at Tiwanaku. The red pigment slipped on serving vessels in Lukurmata was light (1 OR 5/8) and closer to orange than the red slip of Tiwanaku ves- sels. Clearly, even though many vessels may have been brought from Tiwanaku, a great deal of pro- duction was local. Local Production in the Tiwanaku State Tiwanaku Craft Production and Comparative Models Craft production was significant in the prehispanic Tiwanaku polity, as previously suggested by Brow- man and Ponce Sangines. As Tiwanaku authority became entrenched in the Titicaca Basin around A.D. 600, expanding social, ritual, and economic activity in the increasingly extensive and prestigious urban centers fostered the emergence of or attracted a num- ber of crafts. lwhe evidence has direct bearing on spe- cific expectations of both Tiwanaku and craft production models. It confirms, I believe, that a great deal of craft production in the Tiwanaku polity was managed and conducted by suprahousehold groups settled in major urban centers. The crafts discussed here are not exclusively sumptuary or utilitarian goods. Although the crafts served more than basic household needs, they were nonsumptuary relative to other Tiwanaku-style objects. Serving wares produced in Ch'iji Jawira were not destined for groups residing in Tiwanaku's urban core. Nor have we located bone instruments, which are found in some nonspecialized domestic sectors (Janusek and Kolata 1999), in elite or in many residential contexts. Still, each compound group crafted goods with high social visibility, for contexts that crossed everyday social boundaries; that is, for lively local ceremonies and festivals. Panpipe play- ers and serving vessels filled with food and drink would have animated such feasts, and an array of dec- orated wares could have communicated important messages about group affiliations. In contrast to the expectations of political models,</page><page sequence="18">LATIN AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 10, No. 2,1999 124 the goods examined here were not produced by spe- cialists directly attached to ruling elites. First, craft production was not nucleated in the core of either cen- ter. Nor was it the major emphasis of the capital city, as may have been the case in prehispanic Chan Chan on theAndean North Coast (Topic 1990). Craft work- shops were situated in the urban peripheries of Tiwanaku and Lukurmata, far from the focus of elites. Second, crafting was not conducted in large-scale, nondomestic workshop industries. Nonelite ceram- ics and bone panpipes were crafted in residential workshop contexts organized as suprahousehold compounds and barrios. All available evidence, including negative evidence affirming that craft pro- duction was restricted to specific groups, suggests that production served some external demand. Whether production was full or part time, it was organized and executed by corporate units composed of households whose members, or some of whose members, also went about day to day domestic activ- ities. The research dovetails with several other cur- rent archaeological studies (e.g., Ames 1995; Costin 1998; Feinman and Nicholas 1995; Trubitt 1997) in questioning the tendency to separate craft special- ization from household production. In Tiwanaku, at least in the range of goods examined here, craft spe- cialization was household production. Although spe- cialists also consumed (or played) some of the goods they produced, some were distributed to nonspe- cialized groups. Third, the two crafts examined were conducted by semiautonomous groups, each of which main- tained group identity and a distinct network of social afElliations. Such patterns of differentiation charac- terized specialist groups within their larger urban contexts, as well as the relation between Tiwanaku and Lukurmata as entire urban communities. Social differentiation and some degree of autonomy at each level, however restricted, is firmly corroborated by ongoing archaeobotanical and bioarchaeological . . . nvestlgatlons . It is nonetheless likely that attached specializa- tion did characterize the production of many goods, even though in situ loci have not yet been found. Highly standardized and elaborate vessels that were ritually consumed in one massive offering on the Akapana terraces is one likely example (see Alconini 1995; Manzanilla 1992). High levels of skill, labor investment, and standardization also characterized the crafting of lithic arrow points, which were well distributed throughout the urban centers, prompting Giesso (1995) to argue that these were crafted by attached specialists for redistribu- tion by state authorities. Following current models of craft production, we are left with the alternative, that the crafts discussed here were conducted by independent specialists for laissez faire consumption. Although specialized groups were semiautonomous, there are several prob- lems with this alternative. First, specialized produc- tion was not entirely dispersed. Crafts were produced in discrete, extensive, and specialized compounds. Second, predominant evidence strongly suggests that the producing groups were not altogether inde- pendent. Each residential workshop compound con- tinually demonstrated material patterns stressing conformity. Residential compounds were con- structed and reconstructed according to a uniform alignment and spatial principle that linked each urban compound with the monumental core, and each set- tlement with Tiwanaku. Meanwhile, inhabitants obtained and used items incorporating elements of Tiwanaku style in form, design, and symbols of power. Crafted goods themselves shared some of these elements. Bone flutes were crafted of camelids, a backbone of state economy and religious ideals (Kolata 1993; Webster 1993), and Ch'iji Jawira ceramic assemblages incorporated formal and icono- graphic patterns characteristic of Tiwanaku style. The recurrence of common material patterns throughout urban space and society, which undoubt- edly helped provide legitimacy to Tiwanaku author- ity, indicates that resident craft specialists acceded to the ideology of values and practices disseminated by ruling elites. Therefore, craft specialization thrived within a political and cultural hegemony. Strong conformity in material patterns indicates that they accepted much of it, undoubtedly to varying degrees, through common everyday practices and by employing goods bearing Tiwanaku-style form and iconography. Third, neither the demand for nor the distribution of locally crafted products was very broad within either settlement. The relatively rigid adherence in most serving vessels to homogeneous patterns of Tiwanaku style suggests that production was regu- lated by some restrictive mechanisms. Local ceramic diversity was significant, but it was subdominant rel- ative to the production of, distribution of, and demand forTiwanaku-stylegoods morebroadly defined. One</page><page sequence="19">Janusek] CRAFT AND LOCAL POWER: EMBEDDED SPECIALIZATION IN TIWANAKU CITIES 125 condition restricting demand and distribution, as pointed out above, was the relative insignificance in the prehispanic Andean highlands of formal markets and completely open exchange (e.g., Murra 1980; Stanish 1992:15). Horizontal open exchange undoubtedly occurred, as it did in many regions incorporated into the Inka state (e.g., Rostworowski 1975; Salomon 1986), but as in Tawantinsuyu and in post-Tiwanaku confederations of the south Andes, the state and embedded sociopolitical communities rather than open markets coordinated most redistri- bution. Tiwanaku Crafting as Embedded Production If much craft production in Tiwanaku was neither directly attached nor completely independent, how can we best characterize its organization? We might begin by examining the social context and signifi- cance of crafting in addition to its external political and economic dimensions. Sinopoli (1988) argues that in prehistoric Vijayanagara, India, textile craft- ing was indirectly administered by the state, as a mode between administered (attached) and inde- pendent production, while fundamental principles of caste organization ultimately framed all special- ized production, as well as social order, ritual prac- tice, and other economic activity. The segmentation characteristic of altiplano poli- ties at the time of European contact provides a solid foundation for a more flexible and contextualized model of Tiwanaku craft production, especially con- sidering the historical linkage between Tiwanaku collapse and the emergence of these later formations. The segmentation and diversity of Tiwanaku urban centers (Janusek 1994, 1995) and rural settlement patterns (Albarracin-Jordan 1992,1996) point to an organization similar in essential principles, at least, to later embedded ayllu organizations but in the con- text of a more powerful, centralized state. Spatially bounded compounds formed the most salient unit of social differentiation. Such groups coordinated spe- cialized economic activities and were mutually dis- tinguished via spatial boundaries, distinct ceramic assemblages, and even distinct diets and differential access to resources. Distinct ceramic assemblages also distinguished the two urban communities, both in locally produced types and in Tiwanaku-style ves- sels with specific, subtle twists. All evidence to date from Lukurmata, however, suggests that skilled pro- duction was organized not by the entire urban com- munity but by smaller groups incorporated within it. For example, while the inhabitants of Misiton crafted panpipes in the foothills, a residential sector on the lake edge yielded huge quantities of fish bone, sug- gesting that inhabitants here specialized in fishing (Wise 1993). As in later Andean segmentary poli- ties, most corporate functions were the province of lower-level groups. Key among both compounds or urban communities would have been differences in the "best china" brought out during special feasts and ceremonial contexts, and in that sense with greatest display value (Smith 1987:312-314: Wobst 1977:328-330). Serving wares would have helped in local festivals to establish the identity and promote the prestige of group members at many sociopoliti- cal levels, whether domestic compound or entire urban community. I argue that urban craft specialists in Tiwanaku and Lukurmata were corporate groups resembling segments of minimal ayllus or estancias, and that skilled production was coordinated by local author- ities who ultimately answered to state rulers. Valued nonsumptuary goods were produced by semiau- tonomous groups embedded in larger socioeconomic and state organizations, and production was tied to the social affiliations of these mutually differentiat- ing groups. To some extent, crafting strengthened the social rifts dividing corporate and ethnic groups. The production of specific goods, and the goods them- selves, formed important aspects of a group's iden- tity, as did fishing for the ethnohistoric Uru (Wachtel 1986) or weaving for specialized ayllus making ele- gant cumpi cloth in the Inka state (Murra 1980:66-67). If crafted things shaped the identities of their users, they defined the identities of their mak- ers, for people "often define themselves through the skills they acquire" (Lucie-Smith 1981:11, cited in Helms 1993:58). An aspect of identity for members of groups who produced bone flutes or tanwares was that they produced flutes of bone rather than cane, or elegant ceramics with tan rather than red surfaces. Such a trade confirmed the uniqueness of a group in Tiwanaku, which was enforced by spatial segmen- tation and unique constellations of visible style. Through crafting, in part, a group forged its identity in Tiwanaku society. Some specialized groups in Tiwanaku and Lukur- mata interacted with and perhaps were closely asso- ciated with nonlocal regions. Many were undoubtedly mobile "specialists in distance" (Helms</page><page sequence="20">LATIN AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 10, No. 2, 1999 126 power, rooted in the production of valued goods, drew upon both objective resources and symbolic ele- ments of culture. Specialization prospered in a poten- tially volatile dialectic between centralizing state sociopolitics and salient local interests. Conclusions Current evidence for the organization of craft pro- duction in the Tiwanaku heartland supports a model of skilled crafting that parallels ethnohistorically documented forms of Andean social and economic order. The two types of production discussed here were not attached to elites or state institutions; their material patterns do not follow directly from the cen- ter-oriented hypotheses prevailing in much Andean research. Shared Tiwanaku style and other patterns of conformity are evident throughout the urban cen- ters, but at least as important as elites and shifting political economies in determining the organization of urban craft production was the social matrix in which crafting prospered. This underlying matrix was, at least in part, a fundamental segmentary orga- nization that developed from the bottom up and was grounded in slowly changing cultural principles. The types of craft production discussed in this paper do not support the dichotomy of attached and independent specialization commonly invoked in craft production models. Available evidence for Tiwanaku specialization points to a form of socially embedded household production, and it supports a model that shifts emphasis from external demand and political interest to the total social context of spe- cialized production and distribution. The footing for such a model is provided by recent ethnographic research (e.g., DeBoer 1984; Helms 1993; Platt 1987) that prompts us to focus also on the social orga- nization of and significance attached to skilled craft- ing. Tiwanaku appears to have emerged out of a social environment that shared certain principles of organization with those still vibrant 500 years after its disintegration. These conclusions point to the need for a more intricate comparative framework to understand forms of craft production not strictly independent or attached, and involving goods not strictly utlitarian or sumptuary. The model of socially embedded craft production supported here is strikingly similar to patterns of specialization found in Teotihuacan in central Mexico. Teotihuacan during its apogee (A.D. 200-650) incorporated thousands of walled resi- 1993:39), traveling great distances to acquire raw materials or exchange their wares, as Andean ceramic specialists (Mohr-Chavez 1992), instrument makers (Gutierrez 1991), and healers (see Bastien 1987; Girault 1987) do today. Although the idea demands more research, a specialized group such as Ch'iji Jawira may have settled in Tiwanaku as a colony of a political community in the far eastern valleys, as a distinct ethnic group colonizing the state core, anal- ogous to the settlement of the Oaxaca barrio in Teoti- huacan (Paddock 1983; Rattray 1987). Local artisans may have enjoyed special status as skilled creators with knowledge of faraway lands, but their locations at the edges of urban life, far from the sacred mon- umental cores, underscore their position of relative liminality in the Tiwanaku sociopolitical hierarchy. The embedded position of any craft group and its authorities determined, to some extent, its channels of distribution and interaction. Nevertheless, just as today (Mohr-Chavez 1992), annual fairs and local fes- tivals were undoubtedly important for craft special- ists. The Tiwanaku center, in particular, appears to have developed into a center of social and ceremo- nial convergence (Janusek 1995). Majorsocial events and calendrical ceremonies in the cosmopolitan city would have provided dynamic contexts in which craft specialists could promote their wares and exchange them for necessary or desired goods. Tiwanaku on such occasions would have transformed into a bustling center not only of social gathering and cer- emony, but also of economic interaction. The vigorous local social and economic life apparent in Tiwanaku and Lukurmata prompts us to question what type of state, if at all, was Tiwanaku. So far, skilled crafting in core urban centers reveals more about local social groups than it does about rul- ing elites, and it fails to fit the dichotomy of politi- cally controlled and laissez faire modes of production. Nevertheless, notable patterns of con- formity in urban material patterns, coupled with regional settlement hierarchies and the organization of extensive agricultural systems (Janusek and Kolata 1999; Kolata 1986, 1991; Mathews 1992; Seddon 1994; Stanish 1994), indicate that Tiwanaku rulers established a type of state hegemony. The noncen- tralized organization of much craft production indi- cates that they emphasized a corporate political strategy (Blanton et al.1996), leaving a great deal of economic management, and therefore power over production, in the hands of local groups.

Curtis dential compounds, each probably inhabited by a semiautonomous kin-based group (Headrick 1996; Manzanilla 1997), many of which produced a spe- cific range of goods (Spence 1981). A great deal of evidence indicates that state rulers emphasized a cor- porate political strategy in integrating local craft spe- cialists and other groups (Blanton et al. 1996:9-10; Cowgill 1997). Socially embedded production may be one characteristic of states emphasizing corpo- rate strategies of integration. I submit that embedded production is a distinct expression of specialization, located between inde- pendent and attached forms. This is not to suggest that such forms are completely exclusive. Attached production can be conducted by corporate kin groups, a characteristic of specialization in the Inka state (Murra 1980). Nor is it to suggest that one form would be the only expression of production in a given society; many forms of craft production could exist side by side. For example, attached production prob- ably characterized the production of some sumptu- ary goods in Tiwanaku. However, in states emphasizing other political strategies, such as exclu- sionaIy orpatrimonial power (Blanton et al.1996:2; Weber 1947:34S358), attached production might characterize a wider range of valued goods. Future archaeological research into craft specialization will undoubtedly shed more light on these and other issues. A great deal of recent research in the New World, of which this paper is a small part, is encouraging the construction of more flexible and intricate frame- works to understand craft production in all its vari- ety. Key to extending knowledge in this direction will be detailed research that combines both pnmary (pro- duction contexts) and secondary (crafted goods) manifestations of production. Both are required to approach the larger social contexts of production, from the organization of specialists themselves to the character of the larger political economy. Traditional models and categories have served us well, but it is time to account more thoroughly for the variety in social and productive organization that is becoming apparent from one prehispanic society to the next.

(in press). Notes l Our ongoing ceramic analyses (see Alconini 1995; Janusek 1994; Janusek and Alconini 1994; Sutherland 1991) break down Tiwanaku-style vessels into four functional classes of cooking, storage, serving, and ceremonial uses (Figure 5) Each class consists of several formal types (e.g., kero, tazon, escudilla), and each type in turn ramifies into diverse formal and decorative variants. 2 For a detailed examination of excavation results in Ch'iji Jawira, I refer the reader to Rivera 1994. The evidence for craft production that I present summarizes this research and combines results of ceramic analyses conducted by Janusek and Alconini ( 1994). 3 Tests of X-ray diffraction and fluorescence were conducted by Mario Blanco at the Instituto de Geologia in the Universidad Mayor de San Andres, La Paz (Rivera 1994:143) 4 Derived-style forms include small ellipsoid cuencos and kero-like challadores with narrow bases, while iconography emphasizes unique configurations of crosses, diamonds, stars, J- and S-shaped motifs, and unusual mythical figures (see Ryden 1959) Instead of red slip, brown, orange, and cream slips are common.
