The ugly truth nestled at the heart of this joke is that the discipline and cultivated narrowness required to master a body of scholarship often comes at the cost of exclusively fixating on one's own language game. That is to say, academics can be exceptionally poor conversation partners, and the really bad ones typically come in one of two varieties. There are the blowhards, the folks so fascinated with their inch of turf that they refuse to "find a way to talk about matters of common con cern with people who are not accustomed to playing [their] own pre ferred game" (Rorty 2000, 106). Then there are the anthropophobes, academics who, like Laurence Clements in Nabokov's Pnin, arrive at a party and start reading the first book they can find. However, if you go to enough dinners or academic receptions you occasionally meet someone like Daniel Dennett, whose curiosity and sense of humor are matched by the pavonian splendor of intelligence. Bo Dahlbom charac terizes Dennett's philosophical enterprise this way: "If you are bored and frustrated by the rather childish extravagances that philosophers seem so fond of, if you are not interested in card house construction projects, then you have a friend in Dennett" (Dahlbom 1993, 10). In honor of this refreshing quality, I would like to offer a mildly unortho dox review of Dennett's work in the philosophy of mind that is specifically geared toward those who may not travel in contemporary cognitive cir cles but who may nevertheless learn something useful from him. More specifically, I want to illustrate how Dennett's idiosyncratic brand of philosophical naturalism could be put to immediate good use in the academic study of religion. A few years back Tim Fitzgerald ignited a minor cause célèbre within the field by arguing that religion "cannot reasonably be taken to be a valid analytical category since it does not pick out any distinctive cross-cultural © Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden, 2006 Method &amp; Theory in the Study of Religion Also available online - www.brill.nl 18, 189-195</page><page sequence="2">190 MATTHEW DAY aspect of human life" (Fitzgerald 2000, 4). Rather than identifying a ubiquitous feature of human societies, Fitzgerald argued that religion is instead an ideological construction so saturated with theological and ideological associations that it distorts everything it touches. In other words, religion isn't a universal sociocultural phenomenon to be examined but a linguistic product of the historically specific discourses of European Christianity and western imperialism to be deconstructed. However, where most analytic categories may be purged of their deplorable genealogical baggage and thereby preserved for future use, Fitzgerald proposed that religion was too far gone for any such reclamation project: it is time to junk the category altogether. As one might expect, this sweeping recommendation turned heads. For example, Ivan Strenski indicted Fitzgerald's work as "an exercise in naïveté, bad faith, or igno rant mischief, or indeed all of the above" (Strenski 1998, 118). By his lights, the idea that religion is uniquely saddled with these kinds of atavis tic associations, while categories like literature and politics are not, is just stupid. Not only may the academic study of religion redefine religion as it sees fit, it may also continue to assume that the category has "some sort of referent, however loosely we might now demarcate that class of referents according to contents that shift with different contexts of time and space" (Strenski 1998, 123). In other words, Strenski believed that religion really does refer to a distinctive type of cross-cultural, but his torically contingent, social reality within human communities. As much fun as intellectual food-fights can be, much of the theo retical throat clearing about the religion category strikes me as the sort of dead-end academic conversation that could kill a dinner party. This is where Dennett can help. At first glance, suggesting that his reflections on designing minds might have something to do with this in-house affair looks like a stretch. For example, how could clarifying the prac tical requirements of a conscious robot possibly help us determine if there is any gas left in religion's tank? A nice way of introducing Dennett's philosophical relevance for the academic study of religion is to pose the following question: As an "analytic category," is religion more like qualia or belief ? In the philosophy of mind, the category of qualia is used to isolate the personal, subjective and metaphysically distinct phenomenological properties of a person's conscious experience. As Ned Block explains the term, qualia "include the ways it feels to see, hear and smell, the way it feels to have a pain; more generally, what it's like to have a mental state" (Block 1994, 514). The way an early fall sunset in New England looks or the way a cold beer at Fenway Park tastes are quaint,</page><page sequence="3">REVIEW OF DANIEL DENNETT'S BRAINCHILDREN 191 homespun examples of precious qualia. The traditional philosophical assumption regarding these qualitative characteristics of sensory experience is that they are ineffable, intrinsic, private and directly accessible to subjective consciousness. Qualia thus make up the irreducibly subjective way the world feels, looks, smells, sounds and tastes to each of us. However, Dennett provocatively argues that this illustrious concept is nothing more than a curio of a pre-scientific age, the artifact of a pro foundly misguided and mistaken theoretical vocabulary (141-52; Dennett 1997). In Dennett's judgment the dispositional properties of the brain's dispositional states suffice to explain all the effects of perception, "any additional 'qualitative' properties or qualia would thus have no role to play in any explanations" (143). The source concept of qualia is so fan tastically incoherent and scientifically bankrupt that he recommends philosophers simply give up the ghost and place it on the Shelf of Obsolete Ideas next to élan vital. "When your kite string gets snarled up, in principle it can be unsnarled," Dennett advises in Consciousness Explained, "but there's a point beyond which principle lapses and prac ticality triumphs. Some snarls should just be abandoned . . . That's how it is, in my opinion, with the philosophical topic of qualia" (Dennett 1991, 369). The same sort of eliminative materialism that motivates Dennett to scrap qualia has convinced others that the folk psychological category of belief-—more technically, the class of information-bearing states called propositional attitudes—should also be abandoned. For this group, the sen tential model of cognitive processing that folk psychology yields is an empirical dead-end and folk psychology as a whole is "a stagnant research program doomed to frustrating ineptitude by its conceptual framework—by its misconceptions" (Churchland 1982, 1045). Not sur prisingly, another army of philosophers thinks this kind of wholesale theoretical elimination would be a grievous mistake given the real-world "facticity" of propositional attitudes (See Fodor 1990). But as Dennett parses the issue, both the eliminative materialists and the realists over shoot the target by clinging to "gratuitously strong forms of material ism" (120). The underlying problem is that while the two parties disagree on the ontological status of beliefs, each side treats them as if they were discrete things inside our heads that we either have or don't have like tonsils or allergies. They are, to invoke a sturdy metaphor, two sides of the same philosophical coin. Instead of outright theoretical elimination Dennett advocates substituting what he reluctantly calls "a mild and intermediate sort of realism" for this misplaced concreteness about propositional attitudes (97). Drawing on Hans Reichenbach's celebrated</page><page sequence="4">1 92 MATTHEW DAY distinction between illata and abstracta, he argues that beliefs "are best viewed as abstracta—more like centers of gravity or vectors than as indi vidualizable concrete states of a mechanism" (85). People have beliefs, Dennett likes to say, the same way the earth has an equator, and any one who sets out in search of these kinds of purely abstract objects betrays a childlike naïveté about the world. Why preserve belief when qualia was unceremoniously dumped? Part of the answer is that while the idea of "ineffable phenomenological properties" is empirically useless, the practice of ascribing informational states to an object is a powerful tool for predicting, manipulating and explaining its behavior. More to the point, by treating something as a rational agent which, given its lot in life, ought to have particular beliefs we are able predict the ways this agent should act to further its goals given these beliefs (311). If our assumptions fail to pan out—and they often will, given that agents only approximate this ideal of rationality— we return to the drawing board, revise the set of relevant beliefs attrib uted to the object and let further trials refine our behavioral predictions. Dennett famously calls this tactical use of folk psychology's "mentalistic" idiom adopting the intentional stance, and observes that once "we decide to interpret an entity from the intentional stance, it is as if we put our selves in the role of its guardian, asking ourselves in effect, 'If / were in this organism's predicament, what would I do?"' (Dennett 1996, 33). When seen in this light, the intentional stance is an anthropomorphic patch of high-risk, high-yield reasoning which allows us to anticipate an object's behavior by treating it as if it were one of us and tem porarily ignoring the complex (and often unknown) physiological specifications of how it processes input. It is this strategic indifference towards the nitty-gritty details about cognitive hardware which allows Dennett to suggest that anything whose behavior can be successfully predicted from the intentional stance is by definition an intentional sys tem and a true believer. "What it is to be a true believer is to be an intentional system," he writes in The Intentional Stance, "a system whose behavior is reliably and voluminously predictable via the intentional strategy" (Dennett 1987, 15). On this "maximally permissive under standing" of belief, the Class of True Believers includes humans, chess playing computers, raccoons and, notoriously, the average household thermostat (321-31). Dennett believes we can afford to be generous with the objects we treat as intentional systems because, by trading in "lower-level" con cerns about the micro-behaviors of neurons and circuits for "higher level" interests in the macro-behaviors of a system as a whole, the</page><page sequence="5">REVIEW OF DANIEL DENNETT'S BRAINCHILDREN 193 intentional stance reveals exploitable behavioral patterns that we would otherwise miss. Painted in broad strokes, his proposal is based on the algorithmic information theory that at least one predictive pattern exists for a set of data if the embedded information can be compressed into a more compact version (101; Chaitin 1975). However, the business of pattern-hunting invariably means that in the name of computational tractability we adjust our demands for accuracy downward by increas ing the amount of "noise" we are willing to tolerate (104). The philo sophical lesson Dennett draws from this observation is the familiar Quinean one that two people, depending on their situated interests and constraints, could adopt the intentional stance and arrive at different yet equally predictive profiles for the same entity. That is, the principle of indeterminacy of translation means there could be two nontrivially distinct systems of belief attribution "and yet no deeper fact of the matter could establish that one was a description of the individual's real beliefs and the other not. In other words, there could be two different, but equally real, patterns discernible in the noisy world" (118). The general rule of thumb is that if you can get rich betting on a predictive pattern, even if the pattern is an anthropocentric crutch, you have ipso facto discovered a real causal power, "a difference in the world that makes a subsequent difference testable by standard empirical methods" (112; Dennett 2000, 360). It is time to export these observations about qualia and belief to the scuffle over religion. Given the field's traditional proclivity for the ineffable and private, the obvious temptation is to treat religion like qualia and dismiss it as an artifact of a compromised theoretical vocabulary which refers to absolutely nothing. However, doing so would mean endorsing the misplaced concreteness about religion that makes the seemingly intractable dispute between figures like Fitzgerald and Strenski possible in the first place. It is not enough to argue that religion presumes the reality of a peculiar referential class of social formation that does (Strenski) or does not (Fitzgerald) actually exist in the world; what must be demon strated is that this linguistic tag ought to—and no one has done a par ticularly good job of that. My proposal is that we endorse Dennett's "mild and intermediate sort of realism" and start treating religion—for now, pick your favorite non-confessional, non-question begging descrip tion and run with it—as a relative of the folk psychological category of belief That is to say, instead of scrubbing our theoretical vocabularies clean of religion's contamination, we should view religion as a theorist's fiction, a purely abstract theoretical object that allows us to reliably iso late a handful of predictive patterns in human behavior.</page><page sequence="6">194 MATTHEW DAY At first blush, this conclusion may seem oddly familiar. Jonathan Z. Smith sounds a similar note in Imagining Religion when he concludes that: "Religion is solely the creation of the scholar's study. It is created for the scholar's analytic purposes by his imaginative acts of comparison and generalization." Yet, there is a distinct advantage of following Dennett rather than Smith in this matter. When we treat religion as no more or less imaginary than other abstracta, we restrain ourselves from making the confused and idealizing inference that "Religion has no independent existence apart from the academy" (Smith 1982, xi). If reli gion isolates cohesive patterns of human behavior, as Smith concedes, then it also reveals a real causal power in the world and not just in cloistered halls of the academy. The day might one day come, of course, when we invent another category that reveals a behavioral pattern so clearly superior to the noisy and imperfect pattern of religion that any sane person would gladly exchange the former for the latter. But until then, we would be better off taking a page from Dennett's playbook and making the question "But are there really religions?" seem as naïve and pointless as asking "But is there really an equator?"
