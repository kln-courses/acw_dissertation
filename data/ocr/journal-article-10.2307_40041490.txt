At times, the enabling legislation has lapsed only to be cobbled back together by interim legislation or by Executive Order.6 The result is a legal regime where "it can be difficult to find and piece together applicable law."7 The criteria for determining sanctions for violations of export controls have been similarly vague. Consider, for example, the determination of sanctions for violations of the export controls for dual-use technologies - technologies and products that "can be used both in military and other stra- tegic uses . . . and commercial applications" - set forth in the Export Administration Regulations (EAR). Enforcement of those controls falls to the Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) at the Department of Commerce.9 In the event of a suspected violation, BIS has three options. At the extremes, it may either refer the case to the Department of Justice for criminal prose- cution or issue a letter of warning. In the middle, it may pursue an administrative enforcement case.10 If the case is severe enough to merit criminal prosecution, the United States Sentencing Guidelines provide some guidance on the determination of penalties.11 There has been little guidance on appropriate punishment in cases that are not severe enough to merit criminal prosecution - those cases where administrative penalties are appro- priate. Until recently, the extent of published guidance has been the maximum administrative sanctions found in the EAR, with no explanation of intermediate levels of sanctions falling short of the maximum.12 The Department of Commerce has recently acted to provide clearer pen- alty guidance. On September 17, 2003, BIS proposed amendments to the EAR in order to provide guidance on "how BIS makes penalty determina- tions when settling administrative enforcement cases" for violation of the EAR.13 BIS then incorporated that proposed rule into a final ruling on Feb- ruary 20, 2004. 14 As a result, the EAR now include a supplement at 15 C.F.R. § 766 that, for the first time, provides government criteria for setting 5. The three most significant agencies are the Department of Commerce (dual-use tech- nologies), the State Department (military weapons), and the Treasury Department (financial exports and broad-based embargoes that cover more than exported goods).

The penalty guidance is largely advisory. In fact, in publishing its penalty guidance, BIS included a disclaimer that the guidance was not binding on any party - even itself.16 Nevertheless, the guidance is significant for three reasons. First, it is the only published scheme for determining an administrative punishment for EAR violations, and therefore it likely would be persuasive to an adminis- trative law judge presiding over an administrative enforcement action. Second, since many administrative cases are settled with BIS, it will repre- sent the de facto penalty determination method in many such cases.17 Third, the guidance is informative since it reflects BIS's institutional experience about what factors have been relevant to determining penalties in the past. The new penalty guidance sets out six "general factors" for determining appropriate sanctions, then lists eight aggravating factors and nine mitigat- ing factors.18 The general factors BIS will consider are: degree of willfulness, the destination involved, the commission of related violations, the commission of multiple unrelated violations, the timing of the settle- ment, and any related criminal or civil violations.19 Of the eight listed aggravating factors, three are to be given "great weight": making a deliber- ate effort to conceal the violation, demonstrating a serious disregard for compliance responsibilities, and "the sensitivity of the items involved and/or the reason for controlling them to the destination in question."20 Of the nine listed mitigating factors, two are to be given "great weight": voluntary self- disclosure of the violation and the company's having an effective export compliance culture.21 15.

The other aggravating factors are: likelihood of the type of harm the EAR are designed to prevent, the quantity or value of the exports, the presence of other violations of law that do not fall under the purview of BIS, prior bad acts by the exporter, and the extent that exports com- prise the business of the firm in question. Id. 21. Id. The other mitigating factors are: whether the violation was a single episode of good- faith misinterpretation, whether BIS likely would have approved the action anyway, absence of prior similar acts, cooperation in the investigation, cooperating in the investigation of other parties, ab- sence of likely harm of the type that the EAR are supposed to prevent, and general inexperience with export licensing.

Instead of first considering what BIS describes as the general factors and then mitigat- ing for the presence of an effective compliance program, the degree of culpability should be determined through examining the culture of compli- ance, tempered by considering the other general factors. Part I argues that the nature of export control enforcement requires extensive self-governing behavior on the part of exporters and that enforcement should be directed toward that end. Part II examines several possible justifications for penaliz- ing a business entity and concludes that deterrence and rehabilitation through education are the most viable, particularly in a self-regulating in- dustry. Part III argues that examining the export compliance program is actually a necessary prerequisite to determining the general culpability re- quired under the general factors, and on that basis alone cannot be relegated to a mitigating factor. Part IV argues that an emphasis on corporate compli- ance programs in punishment is the most effective route to deterrence and rehabilitation. Finally, Part V argues that findings from the field of corporate social responsibility indicate that the creation of a culture of compliance focused on executive accountability is most likely to result in effective con- trols. I. Self-Regulating Requirements of Export Controls This Part argues that export controls rely largely, in fact almost entirely, on self-regulatory behavior by exporters. This is a result of the export regu- lations themselves, as well as the enforcement resources available to BIS and the small percentage of exports that require a license. Although BIS provides some level of after-the-fact enforcement, the primary effort is to prevent violations through education and guidance. Only a small fraction of total United States industrial exports - four per- cent by one estimate - require a BIS export license.22 Given then that ninety- six percent of exports do not require licensing, and that BIS, like any gov- ernment agency, must economize the use of its enforcement resources, the Department of Commerce cannot reasonably be expected to place an agent at the site of every export transaction to watch over the shoulder of industry and ensure perfect compliance. Industrial exports can now occur at almost any location in the United States, yet BIS export enforcement field offices are located at only nine lo- cations, with each field office providing enforcement supervision over a developed by BIS as a model of a corporate compliance program. The EMS will be considered more fully in Part V. 22.

Although these field offices provide on-site enforcement abilities, there are significant export hubs that are not serviced by an on-site enforcement team, including Seattle, San Diego, and New Orleans. And while the chosen enforcement locations are sensible, any small firm could hypothetically commit an illegal unlicensed export by placing handcuffs in a padded envelope and mailing them to Turkey.24 The complicated nature of the export license process itself makes dili- gent efforts at self-regulation all the more necessary. When contemplating an export, it falls to the exporter to determine whether an item is restricted and what steps to take thereafter. In fact, the EAR confront an exporter with a total of at least twenty-nine steps that must be taken to determine how to comply.25 If, in just the very first step, the exporter incorrectly determines whether this is an item "subject to" the EAR, the exporter might ignore the rest of the process and the export will proceed unless some outside force intervenes.26 The licensing process itself is triggered only upon an applica- tion by the exporter, which comes at step twenty-six of the process.27 An error in the preceding twenty-five steps, or the failure to comply with step twenty-six, could effectively remove the Department of Commerce from the equation. Of concern to both BIS and industry, the definition of the term "export" has expanded to include many activities that do not fit the traditional de- scription, making it even harder to predict when and where controlled exports will occur and to dispatch a government regulator to oversee the process. The so-called "deemed export" rule provides that the release to a foreign national of technology or software source code that would otherwise be subject to the EAR is deemed to be an export of the technology in ques- tion to the country of origin of the foreign national.28 For example, by this standard it would be deemed an export to China to allow a Chinese profes- sor visiting at a research university hundreds of miles from the nearest border to "visually inspect" technology that is covered by the EAR - including the object itself, plans, blueprints, schematics, or specification 23. See BIS Program Offices, http://www.bis.doc.gov/about/programoffices.htm (last visited Mar. 26, 2006). The field offices are located in Boston, New York, Washington, Miami, Chicago, Dallas, San Jose, Los Angeles, and Houston. 24. See 15 C.F.R. § 774 supp. 1 (2005) (Commerce Control List Category 0A982). Restraint devices, a crime-control controlled export listed under Category 0A982, require a license for export to any country other than Canada "[i]n support of U.S. foreign policy to promote the observance of human rights throughout the world ..."

For an explanation of how nuanced that first question can be, see Hunt, supra note 22, § 3(d). For example, an item can be subject to the EAR even if it is located outside the United States and is being reexported by foreign nationals if there is U.S. content exceeding a de minimis thresh- old of either ten percent or twenty-five percent by value.

The point is that requiring on-site, prior inspection of every export is simply impossible. BIS recognizes this self-regulating nature of export controls in its ap- proach to business. Beginning in 1991, BIS initiated the Business Executive Enforcement Team town-hall meetings. BIS engages in dozens of preventa- tive training sessions annually,30 with the stated purpose of increasing export control compliance through education.31 BIS attributed a twenty percent in- crease in the number of deemed-export license applications in fiscal year 2003 to improved education and outreach on its part - not to increased numbers of deemed-exports.32 The bureau also attributed an identical twenty percent increase in deemed-export license applications in fiscal year 2004 to outreach.33 The logical inference is that some significant fraction of the deemed-exports in fiscal years 2002 and earlier were unlicensed simply be- cause nobody ever applied for a license, perhaps out of ignorance. Finally, there is empirical evidence that erratic fluctuations in export li- censes in recent years reflect the hit-or-miss nature of enforcement. In fiscal 29. For a flavor of the reception that this rule receives, see the following public comment posted to BIS by University of Florida professor Guido Mueller: The consequences of this new rule on our research will be disastrous ....

See Export Enforcement Program, http://www.bis.doc.gov/Enforcement/eeprogrm.htm (last visited May 14, 2006). The significance is that BIS does not attribute these outreach programs as being designed to prevent businesses from getting caught - which would be the goal if the export enforcement mechanism were not self-governing - but as designed to prevent damage to national security through preventing exports. This is a tacit recognition of the fact that BIS cannot enforce the regulations reactivelv and that the onus falls to industry to prevent most. violations. 32. Bureau of Indus. &amp; Sec, Ann. Rep.

Similarly, BIS recently began recording statistics on preventive enforcement activities. In fiscal year 2003, the bureau com- pleted thirty-four administrative enforcement settlements for export control violations,yet through aggressive preventative measures, the bureau thwarted an additional 136 potential violations before they could occur.36 This is a noteworthy success for the bureau, but it also underscores the sus- picion that self-regulation is necessary: postviolation enforcement is catching only a fraction of the potential violations. In summary, the nature of the regulations and the evidence from BIS en- forcement efforts lead to the conclusion that export controls rely largely, in fact almost entirely, on self-regulatory behavior by exporters. Most exports are unlicensed, and even the licensed exports would overburden the en- forcement teams if every export had to be individually precleared. Thus the burden is on the exporter to learn the regulations, to ensure compliance, and to report appropriately. The burden therefore falls to the exporters to develop a corporate compliance program. Part II considers the relationship between corporate compliance and culpability. II. Justifications for Administrative Penalties for Export Control Violations Corporate punishment could potentially serve a number of objectives, including deterring violations, condemning, imposing retribution for moral blameworthiness, reforming the offending firm, or incapacitating the wrongdoer from causing further harm.37 In this Part, these competing justifi- cations for penalties are considered in light of the unusual nature of exporting firms, first by considering the stated goals of BIS enforcement efforts, then by considering in turn the nature of deterrence, rehabilitation, incapacitation, and retribution as they apply specifically to export controls. This Part argues that deterrence and rehabilitation, the stated goals of BIS, are well suited to the nature of export control violations, but that incapacita- tion and retribution should not be entirely dismissed as motives for tailoring enforcement actions to the compliance culture of the firm. 34.

On the Record: Stated Goals of BIS Before considering the possible theoretical justifications for imposing penalties on offending firms, it is probably best to first consider the stated objectives of the BIS enforcement division. The published goals of the De- partment of Commerce indicate that prevention and education of potential violators are their objectives. In enforcing export control violations, "[t]he primary roles of BIS's Export Enforcement program are to prevent the ille- gal export of dual-use items before they occur; investigate and assist in the prosecution of violators of the [EAR] . . . and inform and educate exporters, freight forwarders, and manufacturers of their enforcement responsibilities under the EAR . . . ,"38 Leaving aside the second objective, which as a ge- neric commitment to prosecuting violations could be viewed as a commitment to any of the justifications for punishment, the other two stated objectives of BIS are to prevent and to educate, with prevention noticeably listed first.It is noteworthy that BIS does not make a distinction between prevention by means of deterrence, by means of rehabilitation, or by means of incapacitation.39 It is also reasonable to infer from the commitment to education and information that BIS seeks to rehabilitate offending, or poten- tially offending, firms. These goals, along with other possible goals of administrative penalties, will be considered in the sections that follow. B. The Goal and Challenge of Deterrence One likely justification for imposing administrative penalties on errant organizations is to deter.40 The term deterrence as applied to a business en- tity is, to some extent, a paradox, since it implies a potential that cannot be ascribed to a "fictional legal entity . . . [that] cannot itself be 'deterred.' "4I At the very most, assigning culpability to an organization can deter those individuals who comprise the organization or who act as its agents.42 In fact, the existence of corporate liability can be supported in some cases on the grounds that only by punishing the corporate actor can the true social costs of transgression be internalized.43 Individual actors within the business en- tity are often "judgment-proof in that they are unable to absorb the large penalties that must be levied in order to make the deterrence effectively more painful than the gain that would otherwise be realized by the organiza- 38. Bureau of Indus. &amp; Sec, Export Enforcement, http://www.bis.doc.gov/ complianceandenforcement/index.htm (last visited Mar. 26, 2006). 39. For clarity, in this Note the term deterrence will apply to intents to prevent behavior through a fear of penalties, the term rehabilitation will refer to reforming offenders so that there is no future desire to misbehave, and incapacitation will refer to efforts to make future offenses impos- sible.

For example, the fines involved in administrative sanctions can range up to hundreds of thousands of dollars, perhaps even millions if multiple national security violations are committed.45 Most individuals are unable to absorb the costs of such sanctions, so marginally increasing the sanction in order to adjust deterrence has little effect, if any, on that actor. A simple ex- ample suffices: if the fine imposed for speeding were one million dollars, the marginal deterrent effect on an individual of raising the fine to two mil- lion dollars would be minimal at best. The individual is said to be judgment- proof since either fine, one million or two million, is equally destructive; the individual cannot internalize the cost of either fine. But the same marginal increase in costs to a corporate entity that can internalize the cost makes a difference to the entity in making compliance decisions.46 Yet there is an alternative hypothesis. If we abandon the vision of the corporation as a rational actor and replace it with a vision of the corporation as a conglomeration of individual actors, then mathematical calculations about corporate deterrence start to lose their appeal.47Regardless of how well the deterrent sanction is tailored to internalize the total social costs, the de- cisions that lead to violations still reside in managers and other agents who might bring their own external costs and benefits to the decision-making process.48 Executives do not always confine their decisions to the costs and benefits that will accrue to the corporation's shareholders or other stake- holders.49 Given that deterrence is a stated goal of administrative sanctions, there is a dilemma in applying those sanctions - at least to the extent of finding the appropriate target of deterrence. If deterrence is aimed at the individual de- cisionmaker, the risk is that there is no way to set the sanction high enough to offset the total social cost and still be appropriate to individuals without making them judgment-proof. If deterrence is aimed at the corporation as a whole, the alternative risk is that the individual decisionmaker brings exter- nal costs and benefits to the decision that are not accounted for in setting sanctions in relation to benefits, social costs, and expected probability of punishment. Part V will return to this apparent tension between deterrence of corporations and individuals and will argue that by focusing deterrent efforts on particular key leadership positions, the tension can be resolved. 44.

Goals in Conflict: Rehabilitation and Incapacitation There is an inherent conflict in the tasks assigned to the Department of Commerce that highlights the value of rehabilitation as a goal of corporate punishment, as well as the danger of incapacitation. The Department of Commerce wants exporters to thrive and grow, but only to the extent that they are complying with controls on which technologies go to which desti- nation countries. In other contexts, punishment can be justified as a means of incapacitating, or preventing the offender from committing further harm.50 For example, an incarcerated individual is no longer able to continue committing crimes even if the individual is not reformed and not deterred by the threat of future penalties. At least in theory, a company that has demon- strated a failure to adequately guard against the export of controlled dangerous technology could be prevented from exporting. For example, the firm could be denied any license to export controlled items for a period of years.51 In a more extreme example, an administrative penalty that drives the firm to insolvency would effectively amount to capital punishment of the corporate actor, preventing future violations.52 There are two basic problems with carrying this rationale too far. First, as discussed in Part I, the government's ability to actually prevent most vio- lations of export controls is questionable.53 The volume of exports and the relative scarcity of enforcement agents prevent the government from being certain that every item leaving the United States is properly licensed. We could certainly imagine a firm that, once denied export licenses, simply con- tinued to export in the shadow of an over-tasked enforcement regime. A persistent and determined exporter - or even a merely inattentive one - could circumvent such a system since the system relies so heavily on pre- ventive actions of the exporter. This situation is significantly distinct from the case of criminal incapacitation by imprisoning a dangerous felon. In the case of an individual, the problem is reduced to separating one offender from the remainder of society - a task that the modern penal system seems capable of performing. Even assuming a regime that could effectively inca- pacitate the corporate actor, individuals live on even after the firm dies. When XYZ, Inc. becomes insolvent, the chief executive and the export manager are likely to find their way into PDQ, Inc., and the problem has shifted, not disappeared. The second problem with relying too heavily on an incapacitation ra- tionale for export controls is that the underlying behavior in question is often something that we want to encourage. The export of U.S. goods and technology is generally considered good for U.S. industry and the U.S. 50. LaFave, supra note 39, § 1 .5. 51. 15 C.F.R. §§ 764.3(a)(2), 766.25 (2005). 52.

The Department of Commerce is in a conflicted position, charged with both generally encouraging exports and yet specifically pre- venting unlicensed exports.55 This leaves the incapacitation argument with limited appeal. In some cases a denial of export privileges could serve the interests of preventing harm without significant costs to the economy, and it is easy to understand the inclusion of denial orders as one tool of administrative sanc- tions in such cases.56 But widespread use of incapacitation as a justification for punishment could eventually cause results that conflict with other goals of the Department of Commerce, and of the United States as a whole.57 These other goals place the Department of Commerce in the role of encour- aging and facilitating exports generally, making a case for corporate rehabilitation as an objective of any punishment regime. Leaving aside so- cial science arguments that accompany such a discussion in the case of individuals,58 it is at least possible that offending companies can be rehabili- tated.

Combined with penalties whose magnitudes make individuals judgment-proof, the ability of an organization to respond effectively to such failures and to seek out solutions provides at least one argument in favor of punishing the corporation (rather than the individual agent) in the first place.62 D. The Odd Case for Retribution There is even a potential value in adjusting punishment in order to im- pose retribution on the offending firm or to express condemnation. Granted, punishing business entities for purposes of retribution faces some significant criticism.63 The argument goes that the corporation - despite our desires to vilify the institution - is a mindless entity composed of no more than the sum of the actions of its components and agents. To punish such an entity, in the sense of attaching moral blameworthiness to it, is to misunderstand its nature. To ascribe moral deficiency to the corporation is not only to engage in anthropomorphism but to ignore that the processes inherent in the corpo- ration stem from human decisions.64 In one eloquent description of this dilemma, the problem is that business entities have "no soul to be damned, and no body to be kicked!".]"65 But we like to kick the corpses and damn the souls of firms that appear to us to be particularly morally blameworthy. Contrast, for example, the news coverage of the failure of Enron with the bankruptcy of Delphi. De- spite the fact that both represent corporate failures on a similar scope, one was vilified and the other has so far been treated as any other (albeit disas- trously large) bankruptcy.66 After all, there are elements of similarity between decision-making processes in humans and internal corporate deci- sionmaking that make the desire to express outrage or condemn particularly bad behavior understandable. Although there is certainly a retributive argu- ment for singling out particular acts of individual agents of the corporation 61. See infra PartV. 62. See Khanna, supra note 44, at 1245. 63.

In this sense, attaching a label of moral significance to a blameworthy firm allows sorting behavior in the market: other market actors can avoid interac- tion with particularly offensive players or a firm can be punished for the company it keeps.68 For example, the harm to Arthur Andersen's reputation from its role in the Enron failure led to a hemorrhage of clients and its even- tual demise.69 Although there is a risk that such retributivist labeling might be used irrationally, there is at least the possibility that ascribing moral blameworthiness to an amoral entity provides valuable information to other actors. III. Compliance Culture as a Factor in Primary Liability This Part begins with a deceptively simple question: how do you deter- mine the culpability of an organization? While the concept of organizational culpability or liability is by no means novel, there has been a flourishing interest in the topic in the wake of a number of highly publicized corporate failures in the last several years.70 The first barrier to finding a simple defini- tion of corporate culpability lies in the layers of meaning that adhere to the term "culpability" itself.71 This Part argues that considering internal compli- ance regimes cannot be relegated to a mere aggravating or mitigating circumstance, but actually is a necessary component of considering the ma- jor factor of "degree of willfulness." The penalty guidance that has now been added to the EAR includes as a primary determining factor "the degree of willfulness" of the offense.72 The penalty guidance indicates that for cases where export violations occur due to simple negligence or carelessness, a civil penalty or letter of warning will 67. See Albert W. Alschuler, Ancient Law and the Punishment of Corporations: Of Frank- pledge and Deodand, 71 B.U. L. Rev. 307, 311-13 (1991); Khanna, supra note 40, at 1494 n.91 ("[T]he notion that society has a retributive need so great that it must punish nonhuman entities and label them criminal, however, requires empirical support and seems implausible."). 68.

Assuming a case where there is no clear evidence of intent - for example no mission statement that discusses how best to violate export laws or a "smoking memo" that shows a knowing violation - one way to make those fine distinctions between simple negligence and gross negligence is to examine the internal procedures, or lack thereof, that led to the inadvertent violation. It is logically incoherent to try to consider the willfulness of such an act without considering the policies, procedures, and leadership failures that made the violation possible. An exporter might hope for guidance from BIS on how culpability will be determined, but the penalty guidance itself acknowledges the difficulty of defining the corporate state of mind. The best that a confused exporter can get from the penalty guidance is the conclusory and circular logic that "BIS may regard a violation of any provision of the EAR as knowing or willful if the facts and circumstances of the case support that conclusion."75 BIS says that ignoring the so-called "red flags"76 or "the nature and result of any in- quiry made by the party"77 indicate willful or knowing behavior. But these may be isolated cases and provide little guidance to the exporter or the judge. These two positions are in some tension. On the one hand, lack of a req- uisite mental state does not preclude liability for the underlying strict liability violation. But the penalty guidance, assuming a violation has oc- curred, places culpability at the forefront of the considerations for sanctions. This administrative regime contrasts with criminal prosecution for such vio- lations, where there must be some intent. For example, the EAR specifically limit criminal enforcement to cases of knowing or willful violation.78 Pun- ishment by administrative proceeding does not, on the surface, require such culpability. For example, administrative enforcement proceedings are begun with a formal charging letter that must, among other things, state that there is reason to believe that a violation of the EAR has occurred, set out the es- sential facts of the alleged violation, give notice of sanctions available, and explain the remedies available to the party charged with a violation.79 After 73.

Normally the acts of an employee or other agent are attributable to the corporation if they are performed within the scope of employment even if the acts are prohibited by company policy*2 By that logic, export failures on the part of an employee contrary to stated company policy would still be attributable to the company. But this need not be the case. Consider, for example, employer vicarious liability for sexual harassment committed by its agents in the wake of Burlington Industries, Inc. v. Ellerth™ While not reversing the long-standing rule of agency law noted above, the Court held out a theory of employer liability that allows a company to disavow actions of subordinates provided that those actions were clearly contrary to well- stated and formulated policies: in the context of sexual harassment "a de- fending employer may raise an affirmative defense to liability or damages, subject to proof by a preponderance of the evidence."84 That defense consists of showing two elements: the employer exercised reasonable care to prevent and correct the behavior, and the employee unreasonably failed to take pre- ventative or corrective opportunities provided by the employer.85 Applying the logic of Burlington v. Ellerth to export violations invites two significant objections. First, the Court explicitly limited the decision to cases where there was no tangible detriment to the plaintiff. When an agent takes tangible employment action, the employer cannot escape liability by noting a well-drafted and thorough company policy.86 Therefore the Burling- ton logic might not perfectly stretch to include export actions that clearly are imputed to the company despite contrary policies. Second, Burlington's reach might also be limited by the Court's reliance on the fact that one in- tended benefit of Title VII was to encourage companies to create grievance procedures and reporting methods.87 On the other hand, BIS has stated a 80. Id. §766.17. 81. There is at least some support for a requirement of intent in the revised penalty guidance found at 69 Fed. Reg. 7867.

The absence of discussion of appropriate sanctions for violations that do not even rise to the level of negligence might be interpreted to mean that such violations are not punishable.

Despite the apparent relevance of corporate compliance to liability, the use of company policies in this context is the exception rather than the rule.89 This need not be the case. There are several reasons that allowing corporate compliance culture as a defense to liability would be favorable. As corporations are coming to be viewed more frequently as rational actors that respond to deterrence and other costs and benefits,90 use of compliance to disprove mens rea fits within traditional notions of criminal defense.91 Fur- ther, encouraging corporate compliance programs will increase self- regulation, encourage good corporate citizenship, and is a cost effective method of regulation not only for the corporation but also for enforcement agencies.92 Corporate compliance programs provide a particularly relevant method of investigating the extent to which a corporation is culpable. Although such a program could be viewed as an outright defense to liability, the value of considering the program even after a determination of liability clearly has merits. Even if we assume that export controls are strict liability offenses, the stated priority of BIS in considering the "degree of willfulness" of the business entity cannot be easily divorced from the requirement to consider the ways that the corporation has attempted to prevent such violations. Unless we are to assume that the penalty guidance regarding "the facts and circumstances of the case"93 is a purely arbitrary and standardless invitation to the enforcement agency, there must be some method to determine corpo- rate willfulness. Even in that light, compliance regimes cannot be relegated to the role of aggravating or mitigating factors - they must inform the proc- ess of making the primary decision on culpability. IV. The Role of Corporate Culture in Achieving the Goals of Punishment There is a second reason why compliance programs ought to be consid- ered early in the penalty phase. The history of such programs indicates that they are particularly well-suited to the role of deterrence in self-regulating industries. While the specifics of export industries might seem unique in 88.

Comparing exporting with these other industries shows that the same concerns and requirements that led to the widespread use of corporate cul- ture programs in those industries are persuasive for exporters. Current reliance on corporate compliance programs can be traced to a series of corporate governance failures during the second half of the twenti- eth century.94 Some of the earliest, and still most widespread, uses of corporate compliance codes have been in the field of antitrust,95 but subse- quent scandals have led companies to expand these codes of conduct to include foreign corrupt practices, insider trading, racketeering, defense con- tracting, and even participation in clinical medical trials.96 The trend did not end at the conclusion of the twentieth century. In the wake of several corporate financial scandals, corporate governance attention has been refocused on financial improprieties.97 The problem, of course, is not new. In their preface to the best practices report for Hughes Electron- ics,98 Senator Nunn and Ambassador Wolfowitz noted the influence of such ideas in the mid-1990s as reflected in In re Caremark International Inc. De- rivative Litigation?9 In the wake of Enron, WorldCom, and Global Crossing, corporate practices in financial statements have simply received new scru- tiny. The provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act suggest that this will not be a passing trend.100 Although the scope of this Note is limited to administrative enforcement actions, it is also noteworthy that the United States Sentencing Commission has made effective compliance programs a relevant factor for criminal sentencing of organizations as well.101 The common element in these scandals and the reactions to them has been the recurrent return to corporate compliance methods in order to fix the 94.

Consider, for example, General Electric's ("GE") defense of price fixing charges in the 1950s. In the face of evidence of widespread willful antitrust behavior, GE considered relying on its antitrust corporate compliance pro- gram as a defense. Although GE ultimately chose not to raise that defense and paid significant fines, the industry scrambled to implement similar pro- grams.103 Significantly, empirical evidence suggests but does not prove that these programs are effective at preventing antitrust violations. Just as sexual harassment compliance programs are now recognized as having a deterrent effect in that field,104 antitrust compliance has been increased through corpo- rate governance programs that reward competitive behavior and establish internal and external reporting procedures.105 Corporate compliance is used to deter violations across a disparate array of regulations from sexual harassment to antitrust and corporate financial impropriety. Far more significant than the differences are the similarities among these areas of corporate behavior.106 For example, as with sexual har- assment and honesty in accounting, we want companies to be largely self- regulating. The burden falls to the company, whether it is trying to prevent agents from committing harassment or from falsifying financial records. As with sexual harassment and price fixing, the activities involved are not eas- ily exposed without positive steps from either the corporation itself or from an individual empowered to bring impropriety to light. Many of the activi- ties present a company with competing interests that tug at compliance from several directions. In some cases a failure to comply opens up potential profit for the company; in others failure to comply will have an effect on the security or reputation of the United States; and in some cases failure to comply will result in harm to third party interests. In these respects, all of these areas of the law share at least some characteristics with export control compliance. V.

There are several areas of tension in the foregoing observations, and it is these areas of tension that this Part will address. Specifically, the role of senior leadership - managers and boards of directors - in creating a culture of compliance provides a fo- cal point for matching the goals of the administrative penalty and the nature of export control failures. This Part argues that the role of senior leadership bridges the gap between the judgment-proof individual and the corporate actor and merits the closest scrutiny in considering whether compliance is adequate. Simply advocating a strong reliance on corporate compliance runs into several areas where there are tensions between theoretical considerations and how we might expect industry to behave. The first such tension was touched upon, briefly, in Part II. There is an unresolved question of whether the corporation is best viewed as a rational actor or as a collection of human actors who act sometimes rationally and sometimes irrationally. IO9A deter- rence theory that considers one and not the other will at best be only partially effective. A second tension comes out of the distinction, found in Burlington, among other sources, between the view of the company as a principal, accountable for the conduct of its employee-agents, and the view of the company as standing (at least in some cases) above the employees and able to divest itself of responsibility for their actions.110 Another tension, related to the first two, arises from strict liability violations where some level of culpability is considered in determining a penalty. If export control regulations require a significant measure of self- regulating behavior, and if the goals of enforcement activities must include deterrence among the justifications, if not as the primary justification, then how do we structure the penalty? It is one thing to say, as in Part III, that we should make the corporate compliance culture the starting point for looking at culpability. It is another to say how that translates into applying the law to a hypothetical violator. It is the senior executives and the board of directors, from whom corporate compliance stems and to whom accountability is as- signed, who can best help resolve some of the tensions identified above. The role of the leadership, as a component of a failure to comply with regulations, is twofold: first, the executive is accountable for maximizing corporate performance; second, the executive is responsible for balancing the needs of competing stakeholders in the company.111 Under one view of export control failures, we could view the executive as the manager who 107.

The focus then would be how to tailor en- forcement so as to maximize executive involvement and accountability for that system. Assuming that most managers want to obey the law,112 and that the compliance regimes discussed in Parts III and IV are in place, evaluating corporate noncompliance can be viewed in a way similar to many other management failures. This "defect" in performance can be traced to one or more of several po- tential causes within the organization. Individuals within management might direct employees toward illegal activity, management might fail to educate or motivate employees about lawful conduct, management responses to vio- lations might not correct known problems, or the violation could have been an unforeseen by-product of legitimate corporate behavior.113 In all of these cases, the violation raises the question of what procedures were in place to prevent such lapses, and how diligent group leaders were in appropriately applying the procedures. The first of these failures represents an extreme case. Self-regulation breaks down in such cases, where management intentionally directs subor- dinates to violate export controls. These cases are well-suited for criminal prosecution.114 The other three failure modes cannot be addressed without directly inquiring into the role that management plays within the compliance structure. For example, if the failure lies in failing to motivate employees to obey the law, the cause and remedy cannot be judged purely on the basis of whether there is a stated policy of control compliance. To borrow from re- cent financial scandals, the document shredding at Enron and Arthur Andersen violated written policies in both companies, yet it was encour- aged - if not demanded - by executives.115 Likewise, if the failure of the company stems from a management failure to respond to a known problem, the existence of informal reporting procedures is not an adequate defense.116 Such a view of export control violations as a manageable defect of an executive's performance can help resolve some of the tensions that exist 112. Gruner, supra note 37, § 1.10.1. Admittedly, this view would not provide guidance in rare circumstances where a sizeable portion of the senior leadership of the business entity intention- ally encourage, or cause, violations to occur. In such cases, the value of considering the deterrence effect of administrative sanctions under the EAR becomes less significant, and the facts would more likely indicate criminal prosecution. 113.

Compare such a case with the logic of Burlington Industries Inc. v. Ellerth: the two- prong test for a company to escape liability requires that the company has reporting procedures in place and that the plaintiff exhausted those procedures.

But it does not account for the fact that the business can be making a rational export decision that simply fails to comply. A second view of corporate ethics failures can re- solve some of the other tensions. An export offense might appear to be a purely rational decision. After all, the benefits of compliance with export controls accrue to society as a whole, while the costs of noncompliance are not fully internalized to the firm.117 Here the failure to comply can be seen as a failure to account for stakeholders whose daily influence is not felt in the corporation.118 In some ways, the export controls in the EAR are a way of internalizing the needs of particular discrete non-shareholder stakeholders - the United States government and society at large - into the decision-making process. Indeed, the influence and values of external stakeholders - those who have a vested interest in the activities of the corporation that transcends revenue, balance sheets, and profit - are a valid constraint on the performance of the company. The view of corporate violation as a failure to internalize the ex- ternal stakeholders provides a counterpoint to the view of the offense as a failure to maximize performance. The common aspect of both, however, is the key role that the senior leadership plays in assembling the competing goals, creating the process that will turn goals into accomplishments, creat- ing the institutional channels for feedback, and monitoring the system. Compare, for example, the role that non-shareholder stakeholders play in Shlensky v. Wrigley. U9 The plaintiff, a stockholder in the defendant base- ball club, made a series of allegations in a shareholder derivative suit. Mr. Wrigley, despite shocking financial losses that were unrivalled in all of Ma- jor League Baseball, believed that "baseball is a 'daytime sport' and that the installation of lights and night baseball games [would] have a deteriorating effect upon the surrounding neighborhood."120 The complaint alleged that the failure to install lights in Wrigley Field was causing financial ruin. The evi- dence, as pleaded by the plaintiff, painted a bleak picture indeed for the Cubbies. Although White Sox attendance was the same for games during the weekend, White Sox attendance far exceeded Cubs attendance during the week, when the Cubs played during the day and the Sox played at night.121 The beleaguered Cubs even had to endure the fact that attendance at Cubs games on the road outpaced attendance at home.122 The solution, from a 1 17. Compare Khanna, supra note 44, with Gruner, supra note 109. 118. To clarify the distinction: a shareholder is a legal person who owns some fraction of the firm in question. By contrast, a stakeholder is any entity that has a significant interest in the actions of the firm. So although all shareholders can be presumed to be stakeholders, the latter category is significantly more expansive. Among the latter would be the government, the neighbors of the firm in question, customers, vendors, employees, alliances, and perhaps even competitor firms.

And the court, in finding for the defendant, held that the obligation of the director to ensure financial returns for the shareholders was only one of many obligations: the obligation to the surrounding neighborhood might equally be in the interests of the corporation.124 To reconcile the views of corporate culture, as expressed by BIS in its model Export Management System (EMS), with the views of corporate cul- ture as a viable evaluation of culpability for the purposes of deterring export violations would require a renewed emphasis on leadership accountability. As noted above, the apparent tension between the corporation as rational actor and the corporation as a collection of potentially irrational individuals center around the leadership and accountability of executives. It is only through active involvement of senior leaders in preventing violations that a system of compliance as a defense to liability makes sense.125 The distinction between a compliance program and a compliance culture resurfaces time and again, from Burlington to Caremark and at points in between. These distinctions are made clear in contrasting the view of execu- tive leadership found in the EMS guidelines that BIS has published and the view of executive leadership found in the Nunn-Wolfowitz report. While both sources speak to the value, in fact the necessity, of leadership account- ability, it is Nunn-Wolfowitz that suggests that the compliance committee report directly to the board of directors.126 Not only does this approach speak to the concerns found in Caremark, but it also helps to bring into focus the obligations to stakeholders outside of the company.127 Other distinctions between Nunn-Wolfowitz and EMS are subtle, but present. EMS stresses that managers should make a policy statement, pref- erably in writing.128 The management should reiterate to employees, at least on an annual basis, that they are committed to export control compliance.129 Contrast this with the language from Nunn-Wolfowitz: "[sjenior manage- ment must . . . place constant emphasis on ... compliance and take every reasonably available opportunity to reiterate" this commitment.130 123. Id. 124. Id. at 780-81. 125. By analogy: Burlington v. Ellerth does not stand for the proposition that any compliance system is a bar to liability, but that employers must show, as part of an affirmative defense, that they "exercised reasonable care to prevent and correct promptly" the offending behavior. 524 U.S. 742, 765 (1998). 126.

EMS recommends that the firm conduct export control training for all em- ployees who will be involved in export-related functions.131 But Nunn- Wolfowitz goes further, encouraging a best practice that provides initial training and periodic reinforcement of the message to all employees, and then focuses the message on those employees involved in exporting.132 The best practices also go above and beyond the EMS with respect to the breadth and scope of desired training. Nunn-Wolfowitz makes the point of emphasiz- ing periodic training even for the board of directors, including for a compliance committee thereof.133 No parallel provision appears in the EMS.134 What lessons are to be drawn from this quick survey of the role of the executive? One would be that Hughes Electronics, and their best practices task force, appear to have learned the lessons that were hard-learned by the other industries that came before. From sexual harassment and antitrust to accounting improprieties and social responsibility beyond the shareholder, corporate performance is maximized and violations minimized not merely when a compliance program is created, but also when a compliance culture is created. The executive embodies the point where the tension between the corporation as a legal person and the absence of traditional mens rea is fo- cused. Although the executive has proven to occasionally be the source of violations, there are equally compelling examples where the executive built the necessary culture that prevented inadvertent violations of standards. Conclusion Export controls are complex rules that span multiple government agen- cies, have various competing objectives, and are found in numerous sources. Successfully navigating these regulations is made all the more difficult by the fact that companies are under an obligation to self-regulate. Fundamen- tally, it is the leadership that is responsible for creating a culture of compliance and ensuring that violations do not occur. When violations do happen, BIS is faced with the need to use postviolation enforcement to try to deter future offenses while still encouraging legitimate exports to fuel the U.S. economy. The EAR enforcement provisions allow BIS to consider corporate com- pliance as an aggravating or mitigating factor once culpability is determined. In many respects, this is backwards. Understanding the role of corporate compliance culture is in fact a necessary prerequisite for deter- mining the corporate "degree of willfulness." Even if this were not so, 131.

The answer cannot stop at considering the existence and effectiveness of compliance programs. These complex questions of how and why companies act as they do cannot be reduced to such a simple model. But by bringing the individual into the equation, in the form of executive buy-in and culpa- bility, BIS could start to resolve these tensions. The methods are effective in other areas of regulatory compliance, and could be applied in export con- trols as well.</page></plain_text>
