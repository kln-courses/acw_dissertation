<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE ELM AND THE VINE: NOTES TOWARD THE HISTORY OF A MARRIAGE TOPOS By Peter Demetz Unde autem potius incipiamus quam . . . a vitibus? ?Plin. Hist. Nat. xiv.ii.8 ERNST R. CURTIUS (1886-1956) was the first modern scholar who discussed the tradi? tional rhetorics of the pastoral landscape with both critical insight and an astonishing historical erudition. In Chapter x (pp. 191-209) of his Europdische Literatur und lateinisches Mittelalter (Ist ed. Bern, 1949) Curtius suggests an instruc- tive list of topographical and botanical "stage props" ("inszenierende Staffage") traditionally employed to describe the happy rural environ? ment of amorous shepherds and pastoral lovers. It is, of course, hardly surprising that in the intri- cate process of literary transmission, as outlined by Curtius, Vergil fulfills a central task: by his sophisticated use of elements from both Homer and Theocritus, Vergil unfolds, in his Bucolics as well as in the Georgics, the characteristic "pleas? ant landscape" ("locus amoenus") which is later reverently systematized in handbooks of medi? eval rhetoric, eruditely echoed in the Renais? sance, and elegantly alluded to in classicist poetry. But there exist, I believe, certain rhetorical elements of this "botanical" type which develop outside the Vergilian sphere. In the following paper I should like to deal with the traditional motif of the elm and the vine (suggesting the true union of husband and wife) as a distinct topos present in Western literature from the first cen? tury b.c. to modern times. As we shall see, the topos of elm and vine hardly ever changes its essentially marital meaning from Catullus (87- 58 b.c.) to Heinrich von Kleist (1777-1811). Al? though it is occasionally combined with parallel motifs of a related meaning and acquires particu? lar connotations in early Christian theological treatises as well as in Renaissance emblem books, it constantly suggests, to writers of many ages, an idea as well as an ideal of marriage, and aptly illustrates the fundamental fact that, in the liter? ature of the Western world, it is the rhetorical "commonplace" that is truly aere perennius. Origins Though the vine, as a sign of exuberant fertil- ity, is charmingly present in the Homeric land? scape, and the leafy elm adorns the brilliant glens of Theocritan Sicily, it was Catullus who first suggested the intimate union of marital elm and bridal vine as a poetic image of blissful mar? riage. In his Carmen lxii, the so-called "Greek" epithalamium, a group of village maidens and youths alternately deplore and praise the gains and losses of marriage. As long as a virgin, like a flower in an enclosed garden, retains her pure and untouched beauty, the girls sing, she will be a joy to her friends; as soon, however, as she loses her bloom and follows her chosen man, youths and maidens will turn away from her withering charms: Ut flos in saeptis secretus nascitur hortis, Ignotus pecori, nullo convolsus aratro, Quem mulcent aurae, flrmat sol, educat imber . . . . . . Multi illum pueri, multae optavere puellae: Idem cum tenui carptus defloruit ungui, Nulli illum pueri, nullae optavere puellae: Sie virgo, dum intacta manet, dum cara suis est; Cum castum amisit polluto corpore florem, Nec pueris iocunda manet, nec cara puellis. (39-47) To this near-elegy on the inevitable ravages of marriage, the cocky village youths answer with a spirited mock argument which not only refutes the distaff point of view but also suggests?by pointing to the embrace of elm and vine?that fruitful glory of marriage for which even the sad maidens may secretly long: Ut vidua in nudo vitis quae nascitur arvo Numquam se extollit, numquam mitem educat uvam, Sed tenerum prono deflectens pondere corpus Iam iam contingit summum radice nagellum; Hanc nulli agricolae, nulli coluere bubulci: At si forte eademst ulmo coniuncta marito, Multi illam agricolae, multi coluere bubulci: Sie virgo, dum intacta manet, dum inculta senescit; Cum par conubium maturo tempore adeptast, Cara viro magis et minus est invisa parenti. (49-58) These "rustic" stanzas of Carmen lxii are or? ganized in a highly effective rhetorical pattern. It consists of a formal vituperation and a praise of marriage and corresponds intimately to the forensic precision of argument and counterargu- ment (reprobatio). Catullus skillfully stresses the correspondence of both arguments by employing the keywords nascere and educare on both sides and by mockingly echoing the "multi nulli pueri" 521</page><page sequence="2">522 Elm and Vine ?"multae nullae puellae" of the girls in the cursus velox of the "nulli multi agricolae"? "nulli multi bubulci," as formulated by the male chorus. Likewise, the main argument of the maid- ens ("Sie virgo, dum intacta manet, dum cara suis") is mockingly imitated, if not aped, by the youths, who rather elegantly employ the same syntactical structure to define their widely differing opinion. But, of course, the correspond? ence of argument and counterargument is com? bined with the bold antithesis of the central im? ages: while the maidens praise the hidden but sterile flower, the youths praise the exuberant vine which, attached to the elm, will bring forth precious grapes. The question whether or not Catullus' "Greek" epithalamium (Carmen lxii) depends on Greek antecedents and, in particular, upon Sappho's poetry, is not without specific relevance to the history of the elm-and-vine motif. Wolfgang Schadewaldt seems rather inclined to believe that Catullus?at least in Carmen lxii?remains a slavish imitator of Sappho: even the essential image of elm and vine, to Schadewaldt's mind, is derived from one of Sappho's poems?a poem, to be sure, no longer extant. Unfortunately, Schadewaldt's argument (apt to prolong the his? tory of our topos into the seventh century b.c.) combines a good deal of wishful thinking with rather tenuous evidence.1 A. L. Wheeler, in his Catullus and the Traditions of Ancient Poetry (Berkeley, 1934), pp 194-195, 216-217, dis- cusses the question with much more scepticism. To Wheeler, this motif literally grows from Italian soil: Catullus describes a specifically Italian way of training the vine and interprets a vinicultural technique as suggestive of human relationships. That Catullus added to his indubitable imita? tion of Sappho a strikingly autochthonous Italian motif may be confirmed, I believe, by the paral? lel allusions to the "marriage" of the elm and vine in Horace, Vergil, and Quintilian; and, further- more, by a glance at the technical language of ancient Italian viniculture. It is this latter aspect of the matter which may point to the fact that Catullus actually raised a technical term of Roman agriculture, if not a subliterary rustic idiom, to poetic brilliancy while unfolding its in? herent pictorial possibilities. Indeed it is fascinating to see the poets of the Augustan age stress as well as play upon the marital meaning of the elm-and-vine motif. In Horace's defense of the serene bliss of Augustus' reign (Ode iv.v) the Catullian echo is distinctly audible : Condit quisque diem collibus in suis Et vitem viduas ducit ad arbores (29-30) Here, the "viduas arbores" recall Catullus' "vi- dua vitis" (lxii.49), and reinforce the nuptial con? notation by the use of adducere, which points to the agricultural technique as well as to the ceremony of marriage. But on the whole, both Vergil and Horace prefer the subtle allusion. Vergil's well-known phrase in the Georgics (i.2), "ulmis [que] adiungere vites," plays upon the connubial meaning by employing adiungere, which the poet himself uses for 'to wed' in the Aeneid (vn.57). Quintilian, for his part, resounds a Horatian passage (Ode n.xv.4-5) in his In- stitutio Oratoria (vni.iii.8) when contrasting the "barren plane" ("platanus sterilis") with the "elm that weds the vine" ("ulmus marita"). Perhaps the suspicion is not entirely unjusti- fied that these allusions, as well as Catullus' im? age itself, echo a technical term of the expert farmer, and possibly even a rustic idiom. Though the Roman peasant knew a number of different techniques in training the vine and variously em? ployed "yokes" (juga), stakes (pedamenta), and the trellis (compluvium), it seems that the method of attaching the vine to a tree, and par? ticularly to the elm, was widely cherished in the central part of Italy. Marcus Terentius Varro (116-27 b.c.) contrasts this Italian tree technique 1 Sappho: Welt und Dichtung (Potsdam, 1950), pp. 47-48: "Doch ist da noch ein Anker, der das Bild Catulls als solches sicher [sie!] im Grund des Sapphischen Hochzeitsliedes ver- festigt: das Zeugnis eines altgriechischen Worterbuches, nach dem auch Sappho mit einem besonderen Ausdruck einmal von der 'dem Pfahl verbundenen Rebe' gesprochen hat. . . . Ein abgeteilter Halbchor hat schon bei ihr der geknickten Blume die sorgsam am Stock [sie!] emporgezogene Rebe ent- gegengestellt; ja, wir durfen glauben, dafi Sappho eben es war, der dieses Bild der Vermahlung einer fruchtbringenden schwachen Pflanze mit der starken Pflanze wesentlich er- schienen ist." Schadewaldt bases his rather fanciful reconstruction of the lost J7r-poem upon the word &amp;jj.ana%vs ("a vine trained upon a pole") as preserved in its plural form anana?v8es in the Etymologicum Magnum (150 Bgk.). Edgar Lobel, in his 2AII&lt;S&gt;0T2 MEAH (Oxford, 1925), p. 61, insists that the Sapphic use of &amp;fiajj.a^vs is highly doubtful. But even if this term appeared in Sappho's poetry, it does not suggest the marital union of vine and elm but merely the technique of training the vine on wooden poles. Schadewaldt, furthermore, blurs the issue by speaking of the pole (Pfahl, or Stab) and then, rather surprisingly, identifying it with a tree ("die starke Pflanze")?this is quite a difference. As far as I can see, the motif of the vine and the supporting pole appears in G. B. Marino's "Venere Pronuba" in Epithalami del cavalier Ma- rino (Venice, 1620), p. &amp;&amp;: "Con quanti al palo amato / La vite s'incatena"; and in one of Christian E. von Kleist's poems on the ravages of the Seven Years War (Berlin, 1756), p. 204: "Der gefrafiige Krieg reifit Stab und Rebe zu Boden / entziindet Dorfer und Walder zur Lust." Interest- ingly enough, it is also reflected?as my discussion will show ?in Natalie's speech in Heinrich von Kleist's Prinz Fried? rich von Homburg (n.vi): "Und jetzt sinkt mir die letzte Stiitze nieder, die meines Gluckes Rebe aufrecht hielt." Cf. n. 24, below.</page><page sequence="3">Peter Demetz 523 with the Asian and Spanish way, which permits the vine to creep along the ground (Rerum Rusti- carum i.viii.6); two generations later, Junius Moderatus Columella, in his De Arboribus (iv.l), speaks of the "exotic" method of the Carthagin- ians, who raise the vine standing by itself like a tree ("more arbore in se consistens"); Pliny the Elder (c. 23-79 a.d.), surveying the opinions of his learned predecessors in his Historia Naturalis, admits that tradition itself ("tam longo aevo . . . iudicetur," xvn.199) recommends the tree tech? nique ("ratio arbusti," xvn.199) since "a high- class vine can only be produced from vines on trees, and . . . the choicest vines are made from the grapes at the top of the trees" (xlvii.200). These technical details of ancient Italian vini- culture would hardly be relevant to the analysis of a literary motif, were it not for the fact that the technical language of the expert f armer antici? pates (by almost a century) the poetic image as it appears in Catullus' Carmen lxii. As is well known, the oldest extant piece of coherent Latin prose is a textbook on agriculture which contains a number of important chapters on vinicultural questions. Marcus Porcius Cato's (234-147 b.c.) De Agri Cultura cannot be suspected of any po? etic intent or of imaginative use of language. Cato strictly concentrates on communicating his ac- cumulated experience and spares his advice in the stark and unadorned language of the country squire who is equally interested in the sale of senile slaves, in turnips , and manure. In describ- ing the proper way of attaching the vine to the tree, Cato uses, in the second century b.c, the following terms: Vites bene nodentur; per omnes ramos diligenter caveto ne vitem praecipites et ne nimium praestringas. Arbores facito uti bene maritae sint [sie!] vitesque uti satis multae adserantur et, sicubi opus erit, de arbore deiciantur, uti in terram deprimantur, et biennio post praecidito veteres.2 (xxxn.2) If Cato employs, without any further explication, the term maritare ('to wed') for attaching the vine to the tree, he can scarcely be accused of trying to introduce a fancy metaphor of his own making: it is far more probable that he is using a phrase generally current among the peasants and among those interested in viniculture?a phrase which, in its anthropomorphic connota? tion, may betray something of archaic Italian lore and perhaps dimly reflects a rustic view of a vegetative universe. This term maritare remains in constant technical use after Cato. Columella uses the identical phrase but, writing in the polished form of a literary dialogue, feels it neces? sary to explain the technical aspect of the matter, which may cause trouble to his city readers. "Maritabis hic modo," he instructs the reader in his De Arboribus (xvi.3-4), and immediately adds a longish paragraph which remains the most de- tailed explication of what Cato, and the Roman farmer in general, may have considered the proper technique of "wedding the vine to the elm."3 Pliny the Elder follows both Cato and Columella when using maritare in the identical meaning (Hist. Nat. xvn.203); at times, to avoid awkward repetition, he alternates maritare with nubere if he is forced by his subject matter to re? fer to the tree technique twice within the same line (xiv. 10). The borderline between the technical language of the agricultural expert and the poetic image, as it emerges in Catullus' Carmen lxii and is alluded to by Horace, Vergil, and Quintilian, appears to be extremely fluid. Perhaps it is not merely an unjustified hypothesis to believe that a subliterary rustic idiom maritare of "attaching the vine to the elm" and the use of this phrase by the expert agricultural writer by at least a cen? tury preceded its appearance in written poetry. It is, of course, quite impossible to say why Catullus decided to seize upon this idiomatic and technical phrase. He may have been attracted by its naive vigor and its emblematical possibilities, or perhaps he simply did not want to neglect the advice of important rhetoricians like Menander, who had recommended the use of the mytholog? ical motif of wedded trees as an apt turn in Mar? riage Songs.4 Be that as it may, with Catullus' "Greek" epithalamium (lxii) the marital image 2 "The vines should be well knotted; and be especially care? ful not to bend them downward along any of the branches and not to tie them too tightly. See that the trees are well 'wedded' and that a sufiicient number of vines are planted to them; and wherever it is necessary let these be detached from the trees and buried in the ground, and two years later cut them off from the old stock'' (trans. W. D. Hooper and H. B. Ash, Loeb Classical Lib., p. 49). 3 "Leave a space of one foot from the base of the tree, then, having made a furrow four feet long and three feet deep, you will allow it to be buffeted by the weather for at least two months. Then about March 1st take from the nursery a vine not less than ten feet long and spread it out flat and prop it up and attach it to the tree ["arborique iungito"]. In the fol? lowing year do not prune it, but in the third year reduce it to a single rod and leave only a few 'eyes,' so it may not creep up to a great height before it has gained strength. Then when it has attained ample growth, distribute the firm-wood shoots over every 'story* of the tree, in such a way, however, as not to burden the vine, but so as to allow the shoots which are reliable and very strong to grow freely. You must be just as careful in binding up a vine which is supported by a tree as in pruning it; for it is on this that the strength of the fruit chiefly depends, and a vine which has been attached to a tree with firm ties and in suitable places lasts longer" (trans. E. S. Forster and Edward H. Heffner, Loeb Classical Lib., p. 383). 4 A. L. Wheeler, Catullus and the Traditions of Ancient Poetry, p. 217, n. 19.</page><page sequence="4">524 Elm and Vine of elm and vine makes its first appearance in Western imaginative literature and radiates its brilliant light far into the following centuries. The Topos as a Theological Type The motif of elm and vine was in its further development inevitably bound to clash as well as to coalesce with an entire constellation of early Christian symbols related to vine and grape. Non-Christian and Christian images of this kind are by no means mutually exclusive: on the con? trary, they both are later filiations of archaic, if not archetypical, symbols common to the peoples of the Mediterranean region from Judaea to Attica. As P. Corrado Leonardi, S.J., has suc- cinctly shown in his Ampelos: LI simbolo della vite nelV arte pagana et paleochristiana (Rome, 1947), early Christian ikons as well as theological literature made extensive use of the vine and grape motifs which they had found in Asia Minor, Greece, and Italy. In a certain sense, as Pater Leonardi frankly admits, the early Church? quasi inconsciamente (p. 226)?absorbed a central symbol of the Dionysian mysteries, making it expressive of its own view of the universe. In the centuries before the advent of Christianity, the vine and the grape symbolized fertility, and with fertility an afterlife sustained by vegetative per- manence; early Christian art and literature made grape and vine refer to a transcendental and spiritual kind of immortality. Early Christians found the literary cues for the interpretations of the pre-Christian images mainly in two passages of the Scripture: first, in Psalm 128, in which (not unlike in Catullus' Carmen lxii) a good wife was likened to a fruitful vine, and secondly, in the Gospel of John xv.l, in which the vine appears as the image of Christ himself: 'Ey&amp; e?/u rj &lt;Jt/x7re\os i) dXrjdivrjy koll 6 Tarijp piou 6 ye&amp;pyos ecTiv. In the early development of Christian art and theology, the pre-Christian image of the vine (as signifying fertility) and its mystical interpreta? tion by the evangelist John were, of course, vari- ously combined: the vine was to mean Christ, Mary, or the Church; or, in view of the many berries in the sweet xluster, it would foreshadow the immortality of the individual soul in Christ. However, the marital meaning of the elm-and- vine motif was so vividly present to the Italian mind that it found its way, at least within the confines of the Imperium Romanum, into early Christian painting and writing, where it was combined with scriptural typology. Such a fu? sion of the Latin elm-and-vine motif and the mystical vine image of John xv.l appears, for instance, on a third-century wall painting in the catacombs of St. Gennaro dei Poveri in Naples, the most important proto-Christian cemetery in Southern Italy. This picture, which unfortu- tunately has been restored only in part, dis- tinctly shows the figure of a farmer who is look? ing intently at a tree on which a vine seeks its way to the top.5 Though the figure of the farmer (yeapyos) and the vine (fyxraXos) are directly re? lated to John xv. 1 (as types of God, the father, who loves Christ, his son), the added tree clearly suggests the homespun ideas of the indigenous artist. Another interesting example of the Chris? tian use of the Roman elm-and-vine motif is to be found on a sepulchral inscription in one of the Roman catacombs of the late fourth century: this sepulchral emblem (a.d. 398), too, shows the pliant vine "wedded" to the strong tree.6 Roller explains this sign (p. 89), with reference to John xv. 1, as an image of Christ (vitis), mystically wedded to the Church (ulmus); but, stressing the continuity of the pre-Christian meaning, one could as well interpret this ikon as suggestive of the dead mystically wedded to the tree of Christ, thus achieving immortality: Christ steps in where Dionysos and Bacchus have left long ago. It is interesting to see this fourth-century sepul? chral image reappear in the Renaissance emblem books of the sixteenth century. (See illustration, below.)

Hermas' Book of the Shepherd8 consists of a series of visions shown to the writer by the Church (appearing both as an old woman and a young girl)9 and of a series of parables, presented to Hermas by an Angel appearing in the form of a shepherd. In the Second Parable of this book, the Angel-Shepherd suggests to Hermas that the union of elm and vine, which Hermas had just admired in the vineyards, is offered as a sym- bolical image (rfaros) to the servants of God: *H apirehos, &lt;j&gt;y&lt;rLv, wbrri napirbv &lt;t&gt;kp?i&gt; r\ di irrekea i-vkov &amp;tcapir6v kcrrw d\X' ij &amp;[jlt?\os aftrrj kav ju?) avafiy ewl tt\v wrekkav, ov Bwarai Kapwo&lt;j&gt;oprj(rai, woXb eppcfifievT} xalJLa'h Kai &amp;v &lt;t&gt;^Pa xapirbvy crearjwoTa &lt;t&gt;epei fiif Kpefiafikprf ewl rijs wreXkas . . . ffXkweis dbv, orc /eat r\ wreKka woXbv napwbv bidwo'Wy ovk kXaaarova rrjs afiwekovy fiaXKov di Kal wXeiova.1? As Hermas wonders about the miraculous fer? tility of vine and elm, the Angel proceeds with his explanation and describes the union of elm and vine as suggestive of the pious relationship of rich and poor in a Christian society in which there should be mutual support and charitable help: avrrj ovv ff wapajhXri els rovs boiikovs rov deov Keiraty ek ttwxov koX w\ovo~lov . . . irapa rois avdpwwois dbv r\ wrekka 8oicel Kapwov urj &lt;f&gt;ep?LVy kclI ovtc ottaaiv ovbt voowiv, oriy 6rav a$po%La ykvr]TCuy rj wreXea vbcap txovca rp'efai rfiv afxweKov kclI i) &amp;p,we\os ahakeiwrov exovaa rb vbcap hwhovv rbv Kapwov awoblbco&lt;ny ical vwkp iavTijs kclI vwep rrjs wrekkas. ovrm ical oi wkvr\rts vwep t&amp;v wXovcriwv kvTvyx^V0VTe^ ^Pos T?v Kvptov wXrjpofopovo-i rov wXovtov avrcovy kclI wakiv oi wXovaiot, x?Priyo^VT^ r0LS ircvrjat ra beovra wXrjpofo- povac tcls 4tvx&amp;$ avroov,11 This parable is, at least in one important point, curiously reminiscent of Catullus' Carmen lxii. Both the Roman poet and the early Christian theologian contrast the fecundity of the trained vine embracing the supporting elm with the de- plorable failure of the untrained, the "unwedded" plant. But there is contrast too: Catullus suggests that the creeping vine remains sterile, while the theologian, perhaps to achieve a more massive effect, describes the creeping vine as bearing "rotten" fruit?as is quite appropriate in the context of an apocalyptic vision which relies on strong colors. Whether or not Hermas has fol? lowed Catullus (or perhaps Quintilian), he in? deed succeeds in making the old motif come to life with new energy. He proceeds far beyond the marital meaning and widely expands the sphere of reference: the marital relation of the individ- uals is unfolded into a theory of social behavior at large.12 What Hermas actually offers is an image of pro to-Christian communism by charity. Christian society, as Hermas suggests, is not based on bleak uniformity, but on a mystical wedding of elm and vine, of rich and poor: the 7 Die Katakomben, p. 56. 8 Reprinted in Patres Apostolici, ed. F. X. Funk (Tiibingen, 1901), i, 414-639. 9 This in itself is a popular topos. Cf. Curtius, Europdische Literatur, pp. 112-115. 10 "This vine," he said, "brings forth fruit, but the elm is a barren tree. But if the vine does not seek its way up the elm it cannot bear much fruit, for then it must creep on the ground, and the fruit that it then bears is rotten, because it cannot cling to the elm. But if the vine winds its way up to the elm, it brings forth fruit out of itself and also out of the elm. . . . Thus you see that the elm bears much fruit; not, as it might seem, less than the vine, but rather more." 11 "This parable pertains to the servants of God, the poor and the rich. .. . In the eyes of men the elm appears to be barren, since they neither know nor understand that in time of drought, the elm nourishes the vine with its own sap, and that the vine, being constantly supplied with moisture, bears doubly rich fruit for itself and for the elm. Thus the poor, by praying to the Lord for the rich, abet the wealth of the latter; and the rich, who offer what is needed to the poor, bring aid to their souls " 12 Martin Dibelius, Der Hirt des Hermas (Tiibingen, 1923), pp. 555-556.</page><page sequence="6">526 Elm and Vine first, voluntarily offering the riches God has granted them to sustain the spiritually stronger yet materially weaker; the latter, voluntarily sac- rificing the energy of their prayers to sustain the materially more privileged yet spiritually less gifted group of the Christian community. This social interpretation of the pre-Christian elm-and-vine motif, as presented by Hermas' Book of the Shepherd, seems to have been particu? larly popular with early Christian writers and theologians of Eastern origin. Joannes Chrysos- tomus (c. fourth century a.d.), aiming his Homi- lies at the rich, almost literally reiterates Hermas' parable;13 likewise, the Syrian poet Commodianus (fifth century a.d.) directs his didactic, if some? what crude Institutiones at the rich Christians of his own age and exhorts them in Hermas' terms: "Estote comes numinis, dum tempus habetis/ Sicut ulmus amat vitem, sie ipsi pusillos."14 Tertullian, Irenaeus, Origen, and Clemens of Alexandria still agreed in considering Hermas' Book of the Shepherd part of the Scripture. It would be pleasing though futile to ponder what would have happened had Hermas' Shepherd in? deed remained part of the scriptural text. But it did not: during the fourth century, theological opposition against Hermas mounted, and his parables, including that of elm and vine, dis- appeared from the scriptural canon and from the theological tradition of Christianity at large.15 The Rebirth oe the Marriage Song It is difficult to define the specific reasons why the nuptial motif of elm and vine lost its re- splendent vitality during the centuries between Commodianus (c. 450 a.d.) and the Neo-Latin poet Jovannus Pontanus (1426-1503). Whether the serious Christian writer hesitated to take his clues from Catullus or preferred Ovidian material if he approached erotica at all; whether the ex? clusion of Hermas' Book of the Shepherd from the scriptural canon (c. 300-400 a.d.) made the para? ble of elm and vine less attractive to the theo? logical mind; whether the Biblical symbolism of the vine as a good wife (Psalm 128), and as the mystical figura of Christ (John xv.l), swept aside all other typological possibilities?from the fifth to the fifteenth century there is little of the motif of elm and vine that would require concentrated literary analysis. Though at times there lives a dim memory of the motif, as, for instance, in a curious passage of the Roman de la rose16 (thir- teenth century), it is not until the Neo-Latin epithalamium and its vernacular versions that our motif makes its swift comeback into Euro- pean literature: humanist writing, once again, transfers one of the inherited ancient topoi into the variety of vernacular literatures. This return of the elm-and-vine topos is as brilliant as it is sudden: as if a spectacular courtly fire work (which the age cherished so much) had exploded its starry ornaments over the sky, the marriage topos appears in splendid colors all over the literary horizon of Europe. At this moment, how? ever, a chronicle of its appearances would inevi? tably turn into a dull catalogue: as the motif, by now, is rapidly becoming a true commonplace and coexists in the realm of literature as well as in the corresponding sphere of the emblem books,17 its essential attraction lies, more and more, in the individual nuance and in the signifi? cant way in which it is incorporated into the poetic texture by the individual writer. Since the age favors ingenious antithesis, a new trend dis- tinctly emerges: though the marriage topos (as related to Catullus' Carmen lxii) lives on, it ap? pears often combined and contrasted with the motif of the ivy, clinging to its tree in an amorous embrace of intense sexual connotations. In these combinations, the sexual element finally prevails: Goethe, an heir to the Renaissance combination of topoi, later unhesitatingly uses the image of ivy and tree (as contrasted with the marital em? brace of elm and vine) to connote unnerving and sterile sex. The marital motif of elm and vine reappears18 in Jovannus Pontanus' (1426-1503) De Amore 13 "Tuae res proficiant ad illius sustentationem in hoc saeculo, ut et illius sanctitas proficiat ad tuam sustentationem in illo: sicut ulmus infructuosa dat humorem viti, et vitis pro se et pro ulmo profert fructum" (Migne, Patrologia Graeca, lvi, 701), 14 Migne, Patrologia Latina, v, 225. 15 The social and political interpretation of the elm-and- vine motif reappears, surprisingly enough, in the liberal poetry of Germany before 1848. Cf.

Two hundred and seventy years later, the same emblem can be found in Iconologie fiir Dichter, Kunstler und Kunstliebhaber (Wien, 1801), p. 217, with the following interpretation: "die diirre Ulme, die einer traubenreichen Rebe zur Stutze dient, ist ein Zeichen, dafi im Gliick und Ungluck die wahren Freunde immer die namlichen sind." 18 The following paragraphs owe much to the researches of my friend and colleague Thomas McLernon Greene and his as yet unpublished dissertation "The Epithalamion in the Renaissance" (Yale, 1954).

It is perhaps important to know that Puttenham's Arte of Poesie (1589) recommended Joannes Secundus, "the young noble man of Germanie" (Ch. xxxvi), side by side with Catullus himself, as the master of the formal epithalamium. In England, Spenser (c. 1522-99) adorns his pastoral landscape with "the vine-propt elme" (Faerie Queene i.i.8); and Sidney (1554-86), in his Arcadia (1593), praises the bride and bridegroom "whose loves may ever bide/ Like to the elm and vine/ With mutual embracements them to twine" (Dicus: Epi? thalamium, St. 2). In Italy, Ariosto, Torquato Tasso, as well as Marino,20 rely on the motif in eclogues and epithalamia, combining it often with the countertopos of ivy and tree (see n.23, below). But it is Ben Jonson, among these bril? liant writers, who uses the inherent dramatic pos? sibilities of the motif most succinctly in his Hy- menaei, or, the Solemnilies of Masque and Barriers at a Marriage (1606). Going back directly to Catullus' "Greek" epithalamium, Jonson unfolds Catullus' argument and counterargument in scenic fasion: instead of the chorus of maidens and youths, however, Jonson employs two alle? gorical figures of highly decorative impact, which he calls Opinion and Truth. As the scene opens, Truth and Opinion emerge from "a mist of per? fume"21 while, in the best Elizabethan manner, "a battle is sounded under the stage" (pp. 80-81) to suggest, to the audience, the fundamental con? flict. In the verbal battle, Opinion then almost literally presents the near-elegy on marriage that Catullus had ascribed to the chorus of the village maidens: Look, how a flower that close in closes grows, Hid from rude cattle, bruised with no ploughs, Which th' air doth stroke, sun strengthen, showers shoot higher, It many youths, and many maids desire; The same, when cropt by cruel hand 'tis wither'd, No youth at all, no maidens have desired: So a virgin, while untouch'd she doth remain, Is dear to hers; but when with body's stain Her chaster flower is lost, she leaves to appear Or sweet to young men, or to maidens dear. (p. 86) To this, Truth answers with the Catullian argu? ment of the village youths: For as a lone vine, in a naked field, Never extols her branches, never bears Ripe grapes, but with a headlong heaviness wears Her tender body, and her highest sprout Is quickly levell'd with her fading root; By whom no husbandman, no youths will dwell; But if by fortune, she be married well To the elm her husband, many husbandmen And many youths inhabit by her, then: So whilst a virgin doth, untouch'd, abide, All unmanur'd, she grows old with her pride; But when to equal wedlock, in fit time, Her fortune, and endeavour lets her clime, Dear to her love, and parents she is held. (pp. 86-87) The author of a courtly masque, however, can? not remain content with a verbal argument alone. Ben Jonson proceeds to arrange a certamen in theatrical terms and summons forth two groups of knights who first "fight singly," and then "in threes" (p. 88), until an Angel appears and pro- claims that Truth, with her argument concerning the elm and the vine, has won the contest and has confirmed that she is Truth indeed. Giflord once remarked that Ben Jonson atoned for "the wont of grace" by the "closeness" (p. 85, n.) of his rendering; perhaps one could add that he made graceful amends for his version of Catullus by the elaborate effects of the masque, which in? evitably tends to prefer the spectacular to the nicer virtues of the subtle allusion. That does not mean, however, that the in? herited nuptial topos is incapable of carrying more complex connotations. In Paradise Lost which is, among other things, the story of a stormy marriage, Milton brilliantly succeeds in making use of the cliche to his own highly allu- sive ends. In Canto v Adam and Eve set out, after they have said their morning prayer, to do their "rural" work?surprisingly enough, it is among their first chores to "marry" the vine to the elm: they led the Vine To wed her Elm; she spous'd about him twines Her marriagable arms, and with her brings Her dow'r th' adopted Clusters, to adorn His barren leaves. (215-219) 19 His iuveni succensus amor formamque secutus et facilem cantum, quo capis ipsa deos, tecum inter salices, sub amicta vitibus ulmo, in molli iunxit candida membra toro, inter et amplexus lassi iacuistis uterque et repetita venus dulce peregit opus.

At the very moment when evil lurks nearer than ever, they are, under God's supervision, busy arranging the "marriage" of the plants?a marriage which embodies the true marital hierarchy dear to Milton's mind: as the pliant, beautiful, and fertile vine gladly submits to the strong and dominating elm, a good wife, to his mind, should remain subordinated to her husband. But not much longer, and Adam and Eve will find themselves on the brink of pervert- ing this hierarchical order of marriage: Adam, the elm, will submit, in all too pliant love, to Eve as if he were the vine; and Eve, in a moment of black despair, will think of renouncing fertility, as if she ever possibly could turn into a barren tree. Adam and Eve are reminded by elm and vine of the marital order which should remain unharmed, and they are shown by emblematical reality itself how to avoid the approaching dis? aster. In the course of the sixteenth century the mari? tal topos of elm and vine appears frequently com? bined and contrasted with the motif of ivy and tree, which suggests an intensely sexual relation? ship. Strictly speaking, the combination of vine and ivy has little to do with the marital message of Catullus' Carmen lxii. It is related rather to another of Catullus' poems (lxi), the so-called "koman" epithalamium in which the poet stresses the sexual aspects of marriage and de? scribes the bride as a clinging ivy ("tenax hedera") which, full of desire ("domina cupida"), embraces her husband just as the vine embraces the nearby trees ("vitis implicat arbores . . . adsitas"). With the rejuvenation of the epi? thalamium in Neo-Latin literature the parallel of ivy and tree reappears in the highly popular Basia (1539) of Joannes Secundus (1511-36) and radiates from here into the vernacular literatures: Vicina quantum vitis lascivit in ulmo, Et tortiles per ilicem Brachia proceram stringunt immensa corymbi; Tantum, Neaera, si queas In mea nexilibus proserpere colla lacertis . . .^ In the vernacular Marriage Songs this parallel of ivy and tree appears in a number of variations: either it is employed in a strict and almost me? chanical symmetry, as in Pierre de Ronsard's "Epithalame d'Antoine de Bourbon et Janne de Navarre" (1549): Afin que le neu blanc De foy loyale assemble De Navarre le sang Et de Bourbon ensemble, Plus etroit que ne serre La vigne les ormeaux, Ou l'importun lyerre Les apuyans rameaux.23 or it is unfolded in a highly elaborate stanza of richly allusive inversions, as in Torquato Tasso's "Amortu vedi" (1562): Ecco la bella donna, in cui sol trova Sostegno il core, or, come vite suole Che per se stessa caggia, altrui s'attiene: Qual edera negletta or la mia speme Giacer vedrassi, s'egli pur non lice Che s'appoggi a colei ch' un tronco abbraccia. Ma tu, ne le cui braccia Cresce vite si bella, arbor felice, Poggia pur, ne ti spiaccia Ch' augel canoro intorno a' vostri rami, L'ombra sol goda e piu non speri o brami. (Le rime, n.46) Benjamin Neukirch's important collection of late seventeenth-century German verse (1697) in? cludes an interesting poem, "Der Einsamkeit verhafite Plage," in which the traditional paral? lel sustains a highly ingenious play at substitu? tion. N.[athanael] S.[chlot?] (1666-1703), the author of the poem,24 inserts for the expected "ivy" element the image of the magnet and the compass needle, and relates this image to the commonplace of elm and vine. But of course the two have little in common, and precisely because the reader has to exert his imagination to dis? cover the tenuous relation between "riist-baum" 22 Basia, ed. M.

Ainsi faut mollement s'estendre Tout a. plat, sur sa bouche tendre, En pressant ces freres bessons, Puis s'entrelacer et se ioindre En mille gentilles facons. 24 This identification has been kindly suggested to me by Professor Curt von Faber du Faur of Yale Univ.</page><page sequence="9">Peter Demetz 529 (elm) and "wunder-stein" (magnet), the parallel is strained into a striking conceit: Den riist-baum liebt der Wein Und pflegt manch schones blat um dessen stamm zu winden. Das eisen zeucht der edle wunder-stein Der uns gelehrt den weg durch wilde fluth zu finden. Vom lieben ist nicht holtz und stein befreyt.25 Side by side with the parallel of amorous vine and ivy, however, there appears the antitheticai combination of the motifs. In this antithesis elm and vine as signs of marital bliss and fertility (suggested by Catullus' Carmen lxii) are con? trasted with the sexual relationship of the ivy clinging to its tree (as in Carmen lxi) . In Shake? speare's Comedy of Errors (n.ii) faithful Adriana seeks her husband, Antipholus of Ephesus, in the streets of the city and, encountering a man who precisely resembles her absent spouse, tries to persuade him to return home by contrasting marital fidelity with the dangerous "ivy" of mari? tal betrayal: Come, I will fasten on this sleeve of thine: Thou art an elm, my husband, I a vine, Whose weakness, married to a stronger state, Makes me with thy strength to communicate: If aught possess thee from me, it is dross, Usurping ivy, brier, or idle moss; Who, all for want of pruning, with intrusion Infect thy sap, and live on thy confusion. (174-181) In this admonition the rightful union of husband and wife is suggested by the essential communi? cation of the weak vine and strong elm, which need each other to bear fruit; the "usurping ivy," however, implies that disloyalty which seeks the selfish and sterile ("idle") pleasures of sex. The ivy, like a vampire, "lives on" the tree and, un- checked by social decorum ("pruning"), drains away his life and infects his sap with carnal pas? sion, if not with foul disease. Unfortunately Adri? ana addresses this skillful contrast, which is ac- centuated by its syntactical structure, not to her real husband but to his twin brother Antipholus of Syracuse?this is indeed a comedy of errors. In Goethe's poem "Amyntas" (1796),26 which is also built upon the implied contrast between sterile ivy and fruitful vine, the mood has become dark and pensive. Though the trappings are Theocritan, this poem amounts, as Hermann J. Weigand insists, to a highly personal confession of Goethe's own marital problems. What the poem offers is but the sequel to a dialogue be? tween Amyntas and his friend, the physician Nikias, who evidently suggested to Amyntas that he separate from his love if he wanted to rescue his creative energy. But in Amyntas' eyes this is too cruel a remedy: in refraining from following his friend's advice, Amyntas tells a parable of an apple tree and ivy. For the apple tree in his own garden seems to labor under a similar predica? ment : once full of sweet fruit, it now almost suffo- cates under an exuberant growth of ivy. When Amyntas wanted to cut off the ivy from the ailing plant, the apple tree itself uttered in a languishing voice a parabolic warning: O verletze mich nicht! Den treuen Gartengenossen, Dem du als Knabe, so fruh, manche Geniisse verdankt. 0 verletze mich nicht! du reifiest mit diesem Ge- flechte, Das du gewaltig zerstorst, grausam das Leben mir aus. Hab' ich nicht selbst sie genahrt, und sanft sie herauf mir erzogen? . . . Soil ich nicht lieben die Pflanze, die, meiner einzig bediirftig, Still, mit begieriger Kraft, mir um die Seite sich schlingt? Tausend Ranken wurzelten an, mit tausend und tausend Fasern senket sie fest mir in das Leben sich ein. Nahrung nimmt sie von mir; was ich bediirfte, ge- niefit sie, Und so saugt sie das Mark, sauget die Seele mir aus. (21-25; 27-32). In the long growth of passion, the ivy has become part of the tree itself: though it deprives him of his sap and soul, it cannot be cut off without kill- ing the tree to which it passionately clings. There is no remedy: even if it should mean certain death to the apple tree it cannot abandon the "deadly ornament": Ja, die Verraterin ist's! Sie schmeichelt mir Leben und Giiter, 26 Herrn von Hofmannswaldau und anderer Deutscher auser- lesene und Usher ungedruckte Gedichte, ed. B. Neukirch (Leip? zig, 1697), m, 167. In Germany the parallel of ivy and vine reappears with new vigor in the later 18th century; cf. G. A. Biirger, "Die Umarmung," Gedichte, ed. G. Reinhard (Got- tingen, 1796), i, 199: Wie um ihren Stab die Rebe Brunstig ihre Ranke strickt, Wie der Efeu sein Gewebe An der Ulme Busen driickt . . . Diirft* ich so Dich rund umfangen! Diirftest Du, Geliebte, mich!? Diirften so zusammen hangen Unsre Lippen ewiglich. 26 Reprinted in Werke (Hamburg, 1948), I, 196-197.</page><page sequence="10">530 Elm and Vine Schmeichelt die strebende Kraft, schmeichelt die Hoffnung mir ab. Sie nur fuhP ich, nur sie, die umschlingende, freue der Fesseln, Freue des totenden Schmuckes fremder Umlaubung mich nur. (39-42) If this parable of apple tree and ivy has personal meaning, it is indeed a burning confession of love and the despair of love. His personal ivy, Goethe suggests, was no fruitful vine: in the long years of his marital union with Christiane Vulpius, the "ivy" falsely assumed the role of the sweet vine for which he may have secretly longed: "... Der gefahrliche Gast, der geliebteste, maftet be- hende/ Unterwegs die Kraft herbstlicher Friichte sich an" (11. 35-36). Perhaps there is no better way to hide this most personal pain than to de? scribe it with the inherited and entirely imper- sonal commonplace.27 It provides the poet with a chance to speak about himself without destroy- ing the decorum; and yet, behind the cool grace of the ancient topos, there still rages the volcano of Goethe's insatiate heart. The Topos as Theater Because of its inherent dynamic quality? which, as we shall see, is capable of being trans? lated into pure pantomime?the topos of elm and vine seems to have a certain attraction for the practicing playwright. Ben Jonson's masque (1608) somewhat superficially rehearses the cer- tamen which forms the underlying rhetorical pat? tern of Catullus' Carmen lxii; Shakespeare's use of the motif, in his Comedy of Errors, relies too on the rhetorical antithesis of topos and counter- topos rather than on the inner dramatic element of the image itself. In Germany Shakespeare's way is imitated by Christian Felix Weisse (1726? 1804), a prolific if somewhat pedestrian play? wright, in a German version of an age-old anec? dote. In Weisse's Die Matrone von Ephesus (1744) the heroine wants to die in order to be united with her deceased spouse; yet her servant Dorias, who belongs to the type of the down-to-earth confidant, makes fun of such sublime love of death: Dorias: Ah! der Vereinigung der Herzen muG ich lachen! Was wollen Sie denn todt mit ihrem Todten machen? Todt liegt das diirre Reis, so nahe man sich's bringt, Da schnell den frischen Ulm die junge Reb' umschlingt !28 Of course, this image merely confirms the wid- ow's pain since she feels that it admirably ex? presses her deplorable situation: Antiphola: Ach, war er nicht mein Ulm? War ich nicht seine Rebe? (i, 385) While in Shakespeare and Weisse the topos ap? pears in the conversational middle style of com? edy, in Prinz von Homburg (1809) it is seized upon by the heated imagination of Heinrich von Kleist and elevated to the high style of a Schau- spiel which constantly moves along the brink of tragedy.29 Within the plot of this play the use of the topos is extremely well timed. After the bat? tle of Fehrbellin, in which the ruler of Branden- burg is said to have died in action, the Princess Natalie of Orange, a Dutch orphan who had been kindly received at the Brandenburg court, finds herself in a deplorable plight believing that she has lost her fatherly protector. However, she is comforted by the Prince of Homburg, who has loved her for a long time and now sees approach- ing the moment when he can offer her his protec- tion and marital love. At the beginning of the de- cisive dialogue Princess Natalie formulates her predicament and her encouragement to the Prince in the following highly allusive manner: Ja, was soll ich, nach diesem Wetterschlag, Der unter mir den Grund zerreifit, beginnen? Mir ruht der Vater, mir die teure Mutter Im Grab zu Amsterdam . . . Und jetzt sinkt mir die letzte Stiitze nieder, Die meines Gliickes Rebe auf recht hielt. Ich ward zum zweiten Male heut' verwaist! Well aware of the image she touches upon, the Prince of Homburg answers the implied question 27 The notes of the Hamburg edition (i, 504) relate Goethe's "Amyntas" to Herder's "Der erstorbene Ulmbaum" (Werke, ed. B. Suphan, Berlin, 1877-1913, xxvn, 41). Actually, Goethe's and Herder's poems are part of two different strains of the topological development. Goethe's poem reflects the popular Renaissance antithesis of ivy and vine; Herder mere? ly translates the well-known epigram from the Greek Anthol- ogy (ix, 231) which had become the source of Alciati's em- blematical representation of the motif (see n. 17, above) as early as in the 16th century. In Herder's poem both the ivy and the antithetical tension are entirely absent. 28 Lustspiele (Leipzig, 1783), i, 385. 29 F. G. Klopstock used the motif before Kleist in his Der Tod Adams: Ein Trauerspiel (1757), i.vi. Adam [speaking to his grandchild, alluding to a planned marriage]. Du hast den Weinstock noch nicht so hoch an den Ulm hinaufgebunden, als Du mir sagtest, dafl du tun wolltest. Du bist meine geliebte Selima. Geh hin, und sei ruhig. Du weifit, ich liebe diesen Ulmbaum (Heman) vor alien unseren nachbarlichen Baumen (Sdmmtliche Werke, Leipzig, 1839, vi, 8).</page><page sequence="11">Peter Demetz 531 and expresses his feelings within the confines of the image which the Princess suggests; Natalie, for her part, takes her clue from his answer and appears equally willing to employ the veiling topos in order to express the ineffable: Der Prinz. . . . Schlingt Eure Zweige hier um diese Brust, Um sie, die schon seit Jahren, einsam bluhend, Nach Eurer Glocken holdem Duft sich sehnt! Natalie. Mein lieber, guter Vetter! Der Prinz. ?Wollt Ihr? Wollt Ihr? Natalie. ?Wenn ich ins inn're Mark ihr wachsen darf? (Sie legt sich an seine Brust) Der Prinz. Wie? Was war das? Natalie. Hinweg! Der Prinz. (halt sie) In ihren Kern! In ihres Herzens Kern, Natalie! (Er kuftt sie; sie reifit sich los) 0 Gott, war' er jetzt da, den wir be- weinen, Um diesen Bund zu schauen, konnten wir Zu ihm aufstammeln: Vater, segne uns! This passage is fascinating for a number of rea? sons. Kleist's use of the topos appears in full keeping with the structure of his characters: the loving Natalie, in wanting to confirm her trust, actually probes the Prince's deepest feelings. Though she modestly interprets her metaphor as a sign of enduring loyalty, the central marital meaning of her image is overwhelmingly present too and is eagerly seized upon by the Prince. Both lovers use the topos as a convenient means in their highly restrained wooing: communicat- ing to each other step by step the secret truth of their hearts, they try to veil their confessions in the figurative language of the topos, so as not to violate the high decorum of the court. Thus, the topos hides and reveals at the same time. Yet after the lovers have realized the full truth about each other and have confirmed their betrothal by kiss and embrace, the topological "mask" is boldly discarded. But if this is a scene of wooing and betrothal, as the topos indeed suggests, much of the Princess' subsequent attitude be? comes clearer. It ceases to be astonishing that she continues to believe paradoxically in the Prince's courage although he crawls cravenly at her feet?it is her husband-to-be, her ulmus marita, for whom she fights. Kleist's use of the topos reveals much of his individual sensibility. He enriches the cliche by his suggestion of the flowering of both tree and vine ("einsam bluhend," "der Glocken holder Duft") which implies the bloom of feeling and its sudden revelation. The characteristic Kleistean tension, however, is not missing: the poet highly strains the inherited motif by a striking extension or, rather, intensification, in "das innere Mark" and "des Herzens Kern." Finally, the topos is transformed by the instincts of the playwright into pure theatrical effect and leads up to what early nineteenth-century stage technique con? siders a tableau. On the wooden quadrangle of the stage the Prince is transformed, as it were, into an elm by putting one of his arms around the Princess' body like a supporting branch ("Er schlagt einen Arm um ihren Leib"); and Natalie, for her part, fully aware of this essentially con- nubial gesture, clings like the vine to his breast: "Sie legt sich an seine Brust." At this intense moment, the literary topos has abruptly been changed into pure pantomime, which speaks through ritual gestures rather than with mere words. This discussion of the topos in Kleist's Prinz Friedrich von Homburg has shown, I hope, cer? tain of the difficulties under which any attempt of topological research has to labor. The history of any topos turns out to be, in the end, of little importance if it does not contribute to a future ontology of topoi by grasping something of their ever-changing mode of existence as well as of their paradoxical tendency to transcend the boundaries of the linguistic construct. In the case of the elm-and-vine motif, we discovered as its source the technical, if not the rustic, idiom maritare, which was unfolded by Catullus in Carmen lxii; we also traced its further echoes in Augustan poetry and rhetoric and followed its migration, in the shape of a social parable, into the then scriptural Book of the Shepherd (c. 140 a.d.). After the topos had been excluded from the scriptural canon and had been swept aside by the christological symbolism of the mystical vine, it lay "subterraneously" dormant (to use Auer? bach's term) for more than nine centuries until it reappeared with the fifteenth-century rejuvc- nation of the epithalamium and its vernacular versions: from here it radiated into the courtly masque (Ben Jonson), Elizabethan comedy (Shakespeare), and the high epic (Milton). In? creasingly often combined with the countertopos of ivy and tree (Joannes Secundus, Ronsard, Tasso, Goethe), it nevertheless proved still susceptible of being transformed into pure the? atrical effect. Heinrich von Kleist once more re-</page><page sequence="12">532 Elm and Vine stored the motif to the lofty style of his grand theater before it, as if completing the circle, sank again into the subliterary sphere of the Stamm- buch cliche and the popular novel.30 But we should remain aware of the relative value of such a descriptive, and often unasham- edly antiquarian, survey. If it suggests anything of literary relevance, it is the curious fact that the topos seems to live a splendid life of its own which but rarely coincides with the calendar of the established literary periods and styles. Liter? ary history is but the stage on which the topos? almost as a Phanomen des Menschengeistes in the Goethean sense?unfolds its mockingly Protean movements: unrestrained by genre and levels of style it may appear as a literary metaphor here, as an emblematic representation there, as pure pantomime yonder. In its radiant ubiquity, the topos incites the artist to create?in gesture, word, and hue?that indelible image in which tradition and the individual sensibility are mys? tically wedded to each other "comme la vigne et les ormeaux" (Ronsard). Yale University New Haven, Conn. 30 Cf. A. G. Barrili, Volmo et Vedera (1877). In spite of the title it is the "vine" which prevails in the (happy) end.</page></plain_text>
