This monograph is a revision of the author's doctoral dissertation, submitted to New York University (2004). It is devoted to an examination of the "Hš theophany" (p. 1 and passim), a reference to what Hamori asserts to be the anthropomorphic manifestation of Yhwh/God to Abraham (and Sarah) in Gen 18:1-15 and to Jacob at the Jabbok River in Gen 32:23-33. Arguing that Jacob's opponent is indeed God, H. observes that it is only on these two occasions in the Hebrew Bible that the deity is called 3îs (a "man") and that "these iden- tifications of God as an tfš are accompanied by graphic human description" (p. 1). H. refers to this as "concrete anthropomorphism" (p. 3 and passim) and contends that these appear- ances display "anthropomorphic realism" (p. 4 and passim). She defines the former term as "tangible, physical human form, not in a metaphor, or in a vision, or in a dream, but in a body" (p. 3), and the latter as "realistic human presentation and action throughout the appearance in human form" (p. 4). In the first chapter (the introduction), H. highlights how commentators have been somewhat evasive regarding the precise identity of the tfš in Gen 18:1-15 and 32:23-33. She argues that in Gen 18: 1-15, the narrator clearly intends one of the Dānāšīm of v. 2 to be Yhwh, although Abraham apparently does not realize this immediately (pp. 5-13). With respect to Gen 32:23-33, she discounts the possibility that the being whom Jacob confronts is intended to be a river demon or an angel (pp. 13-25). She also rejects the view that the two passages have multiple sources (pp. 6-7, 13). In chap. 2, H. provides a taxonomy of what she considers to be the different types of physical divine anthropomorphism in the Hebrew Bible, distinguishing concrete anthropo- morphism from "envisioned anthropomorphism" (no physical presence of God on earth), "immanent anthropomorphism" (no explicit depiction of God as physically embodied), "transcendent anthropomorphism" (God depicted anthropomorphically but located in the</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 861 heavens), and "figurative anthropomorphism" (the symbolic imagery of God's being said to have, e.g., an eye or a nose). In chap. 3, she begins with a discussion of the theological and philosophical opposition to the concept of divine anthropomorphism in the Hebrew Bible (pp. 35-46). She rejects the underlying concern of this opposition that "a literal inter- pretation of human theophany carries the risk of showing us a God too much like ourselves" (p. 62). Rather, she concludes that "the very notion of a God one can address is anthropo- morphic" (p. 47) and that "concretely anthropomorphic theophanies express God's free- dom" (p. 64). H. stumbles, however, when she asserts that the corollary to the second assertion is that "[cļoncrete anthropomorphism does not carry an implied limitation to God's knowledge or power" (p. 64). In Gen 32:23-33, God cannot defeat Jacob - surely one can- not maintain that in appearing here in human form God has not limited his physical power! (Additionally, it should not be a desideratum of biblical scholarship to assuage concerns regarding the potential limitation of God's power in the 3īš theophanies; H. appears to believe that it is, which may strike nontheological readers as uncalled-for in this study.) In chap. 4, H. provides her own translation and commentary for Gen 18:1-15 and 32:23-33 (pp. 65-77). Notably, she asserts that the two passages are preexilic (p. 77). She also examines the view that the tfš theophanies bespeak a "Canaanite" context, concluding that "[t]he phenomenon of the Dīš theophany is . . . authentically Israelite" (p. 96). Given that some commentators have interpreted the 3îs theophanies as angelic visitations, H. examines in chap. 5 first the forms and functions of maVâkîm (pp. 104-17), and then expands her scope to bring in other supernatural beings attested in the Hebrew Bible (e.g., the běné 3 èlõhím , the šērāpīm, the rēpāHm) (pp. 1 1 8-28). She concludes that "[n]o other appearance of a divine being shares the anthropomorphic realism of the two tfš theophanies" (p. 126). In chap. 6, H. surveys divine anthropomorphism in the ancient Near East as a whole (Mesopo-tamian, Ugaritic, Egyptian, and Hittite texts). Although she detects "a larger strain of Levantine depiction of divine anthropomorphism in divine-human relations," H. argues that "[t]he phenomenon of anthropomorphically realistic theophany as a mode of divine- human communication" (p. 149) is essentially unique to the Israelites. In the conclusion, determinations made throughout the monograph are cogently summed up and H. suggests that the 3īš theophanies show that it is part of the essence of God to be communicative and relational with humankind. Overall, the observations and determinations that H. makes are well reasoned and compelling. At times, the writing is somewhat repetitive, and there are a few editorial errors and omissions (e.g., n. 33 on p. 12 cites an article by Jean-Louis Ska ["Jean Luis" in the note] that is not in the bibliography). These stylistic and editorial matters do not, however, overly hinder the reader's progress through the pages of what is, in the final analysis, a solid piece of scholarship. Daniel R.
