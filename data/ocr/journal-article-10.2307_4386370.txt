<plain_text><page sequence="1">RELIGION AND MORALITY IN HIGH SCHOOL LATIN Of the many articles dealing with the religious and moral influences of the schools two, read at the Boston convention of the Religious Educational Association in i905, are noteworthy because of their contradictory character. One calls attention, in a somewhat feeble way, to a few particular points around which may be gathered moral suggestions in reading the Latin authors of the high school course. The other asks questions like the following: How far are morals affected by the story of the campaigns of a Roman general told with an eye single to his own glory, a story in which bulldog tenacity and organized brute force succeed in wrest- ing freedom and territorial independence from a liberty loving people, a story which teaches a boy if he is a bully to be a bully till he beats and if he is not a bully not to resist a bully for he will be beaten if he does? How are morals affected by' six or seven speeches of a smug, egotistical lawyer and iora- tor in which the right triumphs and the moral teach- ing is obviously correct, in which with Cicero we admire Archias and the power of verse, or detest Verres and the power of provincial graft? But the mlloral teaching of the Catilinarian orations is weak- enied by the display of sophistry by which the prose- cuitor prevails upoIn the seinate to violate the consti- tutional riglhts of his fellow citizens and by the nause- ating egotism of the self-righteous orator who leaves with us the impression that he was not half the man the traitor Catiline was. Thne vriter of this second paper thinks, however, that 'o.hen onie considers the infinite pains which 'upils take to mnake translations absolutely void of sensec and the homeopathic doses of the text at rather lonig intervals and with only a slight apprehension of the conniiection the ethical effect of the content is hlardly of a measurable quantity". But most of the speakers at the Convention re- ferred to above seemed to agree in believing that the subject matter is 'of some account. Manual and in- dustrial training, for example, upon which so much stress is now being laid, they conclude, has moral and disciplinary value; but the child requires a more direct emotional and moral education. If this be true, the classical teacher must infuse into his teaching a spirit that shall stir the emotions. Latin teachers should always bear in mind that it was a Romain world in which Christianity began. The study of all things Roman, especially of the period covered by the usual high school authors, can- not be without interest to the intelligent student. In fact it is difficult to realize that it should be hard to interest any boy or girl in the high school by point- ing out that the world seems to have been provideni- tially prepared for the coming of the Saviour. Not a few thinkers of no mean ability have called atten- tion to evidences of design in history. The unique location and the natural peculiarities of the Holy Land, the spread of the Greek language and of Greek thought over the East by the conquest of Alexander and over the West by economic forces, particularly the importation of slaves from the East to Italy, the migration of Jews to nearly all parts *of the then civilized world and the establishment everywhere of the pax Romnana-considerations suggested by topics such as these should interest any boy or girl who is of the high school age. For the period of life from the age of twelve to the age of eighteen, psychologists tell uis, is the time of adjustment. The individual comes into his racial inheritance and becomes con- scious that he is a part of a social whole which is necessary to complete his well being. The gang, the club, the fellows, the girls, are subjects of maj or importance. Society rather than self is the center of interest. To the objection that the teacher has within the limits -of the all too brief recitation period little, if any, time for this widening process may be made this answer: Writers on pedagogical psychology, in treat- ing the matter of attention in secondary schools, emphasize the educating of attention by a fostering of wider intercsts. The teacher should cherish "the longing of youth to explore the world without and the world within". In beginning the study of Latin the boy or girl should be shown, by the earnest words of his teacher, glimpses 'of the new world of thought opened up to him by his entering into the spirit of that people which has so greatly influenced the world. A few minutes devoted to such a purpose at the be- ginning of the recitation period, after the pupil has overcome the first difficulties of the new study, have been found by the writer himself to be time well spent. In the first year's efforts most attention should be given to impressing upon the class the character of the early Romans and its correspondence with the language. The early legends, which whether true or not, affected the Romans as though they were true, can quickly be recited. The char'acter of the first patriots can easily be portrayed. The reading of Macaulay's Lays of Ancient Rome and of the author's own preface would at. least give the teacher inspira- tion even if he should find there nothing to present to the class. Of Plutarch's Life of Cato a more practical use can be made. A good service would be done if the boys and the girls of the class were only introduced to this writer, whose book is one of the world's best books of practical ethics. Next in order reference can be made to the significance of Rome's contact with foreign powers. Especially interesting should be a comparison of the conflict between Rome</page><page sequence="2">THE CLASSICAL WEEKLY I39 and Carthage with the struggle between the Israelites and the people whom they were bidden to extirpate. The religious and moral importance of the struggle can hardly be overestimated. Such an outline presentation made during the first year may fittingly be closed by calling attention to the general effects of Rome's contact with other peoples. The change in Italian economic conditions, which followed upon Hannibal's long occupation of the peninsula, should not be overlooked. A few sugges- tions of the effects exerted upon Rome's religion and morals by the expansion of her political power and of her trade will eagerly be siezed by the pupil. And then the teacher is ready to show from what stand- point are to be estimated the three or four or five authors whose writings are to compose the remainder of the high school course. In judging these men one should note at the out- set that practically all moral influences were against them and that they received no help from religion. As the historian Froude says in his sketch of Caesar, "while morality was assailed on one side by extra- ordinary temptations the religious sanction of it was undermined on the other. The Romans ceased to be- lieve and in losing their faith they became as steel that is demagnetized; the spiritual quality was gone out of them and the high society of Rome itself be- came a society of powerful animals with an enormous appetite for pleasure". In order therefore that the conditions which pre- vailed may be more fully understood it may not be amiss to give space to a general outline of Roman religion up to the reign of Augustus. As the sources of the study are late and confused it is difficult to separate the real Roman religion from its foreign elements. But some of its characteristics are certain. There was.no dogma. The list of gods therefore was never closed. There was a lack of sensitiveness and of fertile imagination such as the Greeks possessed. There were no epics. According to Ihne the Roman religion was designed for practi- cal purposes and according to Mommsen the gods were instruments for practical ends. Ritual and magic were used to compel the gods to do the will of the worshiper. Accordingly the exact observance of the ritual became the important feature of the relig- ion. There was originally no worship of natural forces and no anthropomorphism. Each god was localized. There were no marriages of gods and no genealogies. Animals like the bird for Juno and a snake for the genius were not attendants of gods of human form but signs of the dieties' presence. In fact the nature of all Roman gods is to us very hazy when they are stripped of all their Hel- lenic trappings. There were even no abstractions like Iustitia such as were found later. To the first Romans Ianus was the threshold. Vesta was never anthropomorphic but was the hearth-fire to the last. It was a demoniacal stage. It was a stage of numina not dei. For one hundred and fifty years, we are told, there was no statue. The sphere of each numen was strictly limited. Every act and every obj ect had its own numen and the invention of the gods went on at a rate more rapid even than that of the making of later Italian saints. To invoke a par- ticular god there had to be used a precise formula and the list of these indigitameenta, as they were called, must have been appalling. Such formalism naturally resulted in a decadent spirituality. The very intensity of formalism so long maintained implies, however, a firm belief in the existen,ce of the gods. It contributed also towards strengthening the rela- tionship of the individual to the family and the state1. Religion is a most conservative force. But the Roman religion was so mightily assailed by outside forces that its intense formalism, though ingrained in a formal and sternly practical people, was not able to resist. According to Professor Carter, in his book The Religion of Numa and Other Essays, Roman re- ligion divides inito five periods, each of which is mark- ed by the entrance of certain new ideals into the religious consciousness: (i) The Period of the Tar- quins; (2) The later kingdom, beginning with the reforms of Servius; (3) The first three centuries of the republic, beginning with the coming of the Sibyl; (4) The closing centuries of the republic, beginning with the decline of faith; (5) The early empire, be- ginning with the Augustan renaissance. The old gods, imperfectly conceived though they were, held their own fairly well till the time of the Second Punic War. The real decadence began in the year 217 when the Great Mother Cybele and her orgiastic rights were brought from Asia Minor. Ways of introducing new gods, additional to the methods implied in the preceding paragraph, were four in number-trade and immigration, the rite of invocatio, new circumstances causing the invention of a deity, and personification of abstractions. By invocatio is meant the transference to Rome by ap- peal -of the deity of a conquered city. The effects of these changes were many and im- portant. New festivals furnished entertainment for the plebs and the new people. Many temples were built, some of them by guilds of workmen. Festivals with more emotional forms of expression took the place of the old Roman sacra. Now by the side of a Roman priest praying with his head covered with a toga might be seen a Greek priest who, with head bared and face upturned and with a laurel branch in his hand, addressed a visible representation of the god. The weakness of the Roman religion can be in- ferred from what has already been said. It is shown most plainly by the Second Punic War when the 1 Some indebtedness to Professor Clifford Herschel Moore of Har- vard University is acknowledged.</page><page sequence="3">140 THE CLASSICAL WEEKLY authorities felt themselves to be so helpless that they had recourse to importing the great Rhea, already referred to. Largely because of there being no appeal to the emotions respect for the old religion was rap- idly disappearing. In point is the instance of Flamin- ius's despising the gods, vividly recorded in Livy 2I. 63. This chapter and the preceding one, by the way, throw a great deal of light upon the subject of Roman religion and morality in general. The teacher would do well to read them often as also the additional in- formation given by the notes on them in the various school editions. From literature, art and philosophy also came un- dermining influences. Ennius translated the work of Euhemerus on the origin of the gods and showed his fellowcountrymen how it was possible that their divinities were but the deifications of great men. The comedies of Plautus diffused pictures of the lowest practical morals throughout Roman society. In i86 B. C. occurred the Bacchanalian scandal; several thousand men had bound themselves by oath to be loyal to the cult even if this should sacrifice loyalty to the state. The driving out of oriental astrologers shows further what the conditions were coming to be. Etruscan soothsayers were gaining favor. In the same year as the one in which the devotees of Bac- chus created such a furore the so-called books of Numa were found. These were full of subverting Pythagorean doctrines. The senate ordered them burnt. Cato, who was the embodiment of the old Roman character exaggerated, was instrumental in driving out Greek sophists. They had so much lack of moral sense that they one day proved certain weighty points of morality and on the next day over- threw all their former arguments. They did serious harm by entertaining the Roman youths with their blatant skeptical discourses, especially through a refu- tation of the current arguments for political justice and the implied vindication of all of Rome's con- quests. Epicureanism early became known. Its chief Roman apostle Lucretius used all his great genius to ease his fellow countrymen's consciences by endeavor- ing to abolish their belief in their own gods. Stoical philosophy appealed to the practical Romans; but philosophy is hostile to polytheism. Varro attempted to bolster religion by explaining the gods upon a physical basis. With regard to the immorality that prevailed in the last century before the Christian era the barest refer- ences would suffice. Such references should give the student renewed interest in the book of Romans. Considered in the light of all this the wonder is that Caesar, Cicero and Ovid were what they were. But of course the teacher of any of these authors is not obliged to defend him against all charges of im- perfection. Every boy and girl will realize this. It makes a pathological study, to be sure; but one learns best by contrasts and it is not to be feared that in the case of any of these authors vice will be made so attractive that the young student will "first endure, then pity, then embrace". Above all should it be remembered that vice is more often recorded than virtue. A profitable comparison can be made of Pliny's letters with Juvenal's satires. It is for our purpose a happy arrangement which puts Caesar first in the course, Cicero next and then Vergil and Ovid. The energetic action of the great general appeals most strongly to the younger student. In the following year he is better able to comprehend the economic and political conditions revealed by the orations of the more philosophic Cicero. Finally he comes to consideration of the character portrayal of the emotional and religious Vergil and of the grace- ful and artistic Ovid. To enumerate here the different moral and religious questions found in these writers and to attempt to discuss any of them would be useless as well as tire- some. They must be left to the disposition of the individual teacher. He would do well to read widely with the religious and moral object in view. The re- cently published Ethics by Dewey and Tufts is an excellent handbook. For the different authors there are works like Froude's Caesar and Forsythe's Cicero. The larger histories of Rome give no little help which may be found by aid of the indices. All the modern school editions contain in their intro- ductions and commentaries much valuable material which the teacher as well as the pupil is too apt to overlook. So too do the various books on Roman private life like Johnston's and Friedlaender's (now at last translated into English). The classical dic- tionaries give information about particular matters and usually direct one to the original or broader sources. In German there are Wissowa's work on Roman religion in the Iwan Muiller Handbuch series, Pauly-Wissowa's Realencyclopaedie, and Roscher's lexicon of religion and mythology. But questions of morality never change in essentials and the wide- awake reader finds continuous discussion of them in books and periodicals of all sorts. For Caesar the opening and closing chapters of Froude can not be recommended too highly. Es- pecially to be noticed is his elaboration of the theme of the great man's coming into the world at a special time for a special object. With Caesar religion was a state affair. This explains many apparent incon- sistencies in his character. In considering his mo- rality emphasis should be placed upon his self-con- trol and his ability to subordinate all means to his ends. Note his dealings with men of all classes, deal- ings always so generous that he attached men to his cause and so assisted his own advancement, his temperateness, his acquired powers of wonderful en- durance and of speed. His wars show that he knew that in military operations the so-called fortunes of war count for little and moral preparation is almost everything. In ethical matters among other peoples he is genuinely interested, as is shown time after time</page><page sequence="4">tHE CLASSICAL WEEKLY by the pages of his Gallic War. What he says about the Druids, for example, stimulates one to make additions to one's knowledge of this strange order by recourse to the encyclopedias, if no better authorities are available. He is interested most in customs that serve practical ends. But he always commends self- sacrifice for the good of others and he seems to realize that man is man most truly and serves himself best when he serves others. As to his weaknesses we may believe that what Plutarch says about his super- stitiousness is not altogether without foundation. Against Cicero's character not much can be said; nor yet can much be said for it. Some of his letters, however, especially those that relate to his daughter, reveal a tenderness of affection that in a man of his times is quite gratifying. But he had little genuine anid personal religion. He believed in a personal god and in his Tusculan Discussions and elsewhere in his philosophical writings he strenuously maintains that the soul is immaterial and immortal. And yet that same work, the Tusculan Discussions, composed as it was after the death of his beloved daughter, shows that his opinions had almost no practical force and value. His correspondence with Servius Sul- picius at this time shows that neither he nor his intimate friends, when they try to console him, think of the truths upon which he has so eloquently des- canted. His De Deorunt Natura exhibits religion as merely a pleasant subject for investigation. The only satisfaction that one can receive from such an investigation comnes from learning how empty of hope was the mind of the world during the period with which we are dealing. In this connection much might be said about the mental and spiritual preparation of the minds of men for the coming of the One who brought life and immortality to light. The mention of portents in the speeches naturally reminds the teacher of what he has read about the same subject in Livy. The class would profitably enjoy translations of such passages as 2I. 62, 22. I and g (second half), 57 (first half), 24. IO, 25. I2 and 29. IO (second half). The prevalence of superstition, of which there are traces in the orations, is an en- trancing topic for investigation. The article Super- stitio in the classical dictionary, with the cross refer- ences, should first be read. To make a deeper study one would consult the books on private life already referred to and such books as Professor Dill's on Roman society. Most fruitful of original sources are the two works on agriculture by Cato and Varro, Ovid's Fasti, Pliny the Elder's Natural History and the Noctes Atticae of Gellius. Practices that survive in modern Italy, such as belief in the efficacy of the 'evil eye', are illuminative. But in Cicero there are moral topics that are closely related to economics and to politics also. Especially interesting in these days, when so much is heard about graft, are some orations that are not often studied in the secondary school, notably those against Verres. The contents of these speeches are presented in a very entertaining way by Professor Church in his story called Roman Life in the Days of Cicero. Vergil is a rich mine of religious and moral lore. He tempts the iteacher, who is so disposed, to devote too much time in the class-room to the subject. But certainly the Aeneid should receive its proper set- ting in order to be appreciated. The introductions in most of the modern school editions are satisfactory in this regard, especially when several are used to supplement one another. Yet additions may well be made in the form of spirited translations of some of the Odes of Horace and of the fourth Eclogue of Vergil himself. The Carmen Saeculare and its story, with illustrations of the Ara Pacis, may be made to contribute to the end in view. In other words the stu- dent should be helped to grasp the great purpose of the poem. At the outset he should make an eftort to comprehend Vergil's conception of Fate and of the gods' control over human affairs. Brief debates on the moral effects of such beliefs the class would par- ticipate in with eagerness. The study would help the class to reconcile the hero's epithet pius with his desertion of most -excellent Dido. It would result also in a better understanding of the position that patriotism occupied in ancient codes of ethics. The athletic contests described in the fifth book invite comparison with those of today. But of course the teacher will not allow the acute boys of the class to argue that things athletic are today beyond reproach because they are better than they were yesterday!' The Sibyl and many other 'matters in the sixth book form attractive subjects. The articles on the Sibyl in the classical dictionary and in the encyclopedias might well be worked over by the members of the class themselves. During this period of the course the teacher might often' himself translate the lesson text in the class and devote the remainder of the recitation period to a presentation of what he regards as the best portions apropos of works like Glover's Studies in Vergil, Tunison's Master Vergil and Comparetti's Vergil in the Middle Ages. The telling of such a legend as the one which purports to give St. Paul's opinion of the great poet would be profitable in more ways than one. This paper, which was by no means intended to be at all exhaustive, is brought to a close with a hope that it may stimulate some teachers in the secondary schools to enter upon, or more earnestly to pursue, a line of thought that shall help them more com- pletely to co6rdinate their work with those other por- tioIns of the cuirriculum that belong to history, in the broad sense of that term, and to do their part in the great work of not only instructing the intellectual faculties but also of developing right characters in thieir boys and girls.
