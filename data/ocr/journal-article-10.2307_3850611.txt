<plain_text><page sequence="1">FREDRIC JAMESON Wyndham Lewis as Futurist 1 Sound and image sullenly mate; but the denser name doubly impending bears down the simulacrum. -The Childermass TO FACE THE SENTENCES OF WYNDHAM LEWIS is to find oneself in the presence of a principle of immense mechanical energy. Flaubert, Ulysses, are composed; the voices of a James or of a Faulkner develop their resources through some patient blind groping exploration of their personal idiosyncrasies from work to work. The style of Lewis, however, equally unmistakable, blasts through the tissues of his novels like a steam whistle, breaking them to its will. For the machine-like, the artificial, knows a peculiar exalta- tion all its own: "a motor-car roaring at full speed, as though bearing down upon the machine-gun itself, is more beautiful than the Victory of Samothrace," cried Marinetti in words that echoed around the world like the pulsing telegraph waves upon the emblematic globe of the old newsreels, words that seem to furnish the program for the scene-a-faire of Lewis' greatest novel. But for Lewis, as for so many others, Marinetti's Futurism has the liberating effect of an external and static symbol merely, a pro- phetic caricature of what the new twentieth-century linguistic ap- paratus will be able to register. For Lewis himself, indeed, there can be no question of opposing nature, or the organic, to the machine: "Every living form is a miraculous mechanism ..., and every sanguinary, vicious and twisted need produces in Nature's workshop a series of mechanical arrangements extremely sug- gestive and interesting for the engineer, and almost invariably beautiful or interesting for the artist." Nature itself as machine: such is the force of the preeminently typical opening page of one of Lewis' first great narratives, the (then) scandalous Cantleman's Spring Mate of 1917:</page><page sequence="2">THE HUDSON REVIEW Cantleman walked in the strenuous fields, steam rising from them as though from an exertion, dissecting the daisies specked in the small wood, the primroses on the banks, the marshy lakes, and all God's creatures. The heat of a heavy premature Summer was cooking the little narrow belt of earth-air, causing everything in- nocently to burst its skin, bask abjectly and profoundly. Every- thing was enchanted with itself and with everything else. The horses considered the mares immensely appetizing masses of quiv- ering shiny flesh: was there not something of 'je ne sais quoi' about a mare, that no other beast's better-half possessed? So also for the sexual stimulation of birds, of sows and hogs, in- deed of man himself, the primordial sensual awakening of spring proving on closer inspection to be nothing but the effect of some terrific atmospheric pressure-cookery. Yet this alarming demystification of the organic is conveyed in a paradoxical way: nothing is more characteristic of Lewis than the peculiar rotation of our inferential system around the adjec- tive "strenuous," the peculiar slippage of the properties thus named from their official referent in the sentence. The fields, we tell ourselves, can in no case themselves really be thought of as strenuous: what is "strenuous" is at best the walk through them, or Cantleman's own exertions. Anthropomorphic projection seems an inadequate term for this shift, to which classical rhetoric gave the name "hypallage," and in which the attributes of actor or act are transferred onto the dead scenery. It is indeed a kind of contamination of the axis of contiguity, offering a glimpse of a world in which the old-fashioned substances, like marbles in a box, are rattled so furiously together that their "properties" come loose and stick to the wrong places-a very delirium of metonymy of which Lewis' subsequent writings provide some stunning examples. Yet at this point something quite unexpected happens, and it is as though beneath this initial figural sense a new and far more literal meaning inserted itself. Cantleman was just a blind: now the fields really are "strenuous" after all in their own right, as overworked agents, throwing themselves enthusiastically into the business of giving off steam, perspiring from the effort of sum- mer's thermal preparations. So what was on the story's literal level a figure (the fields as the place for Cantleman's strenuous walk) is now, on the figural level of what the fields in spring 296</page><page sequence="3">FREDRIC JAMESON are like, taken all too literally; nor does the process stop there, for the metaphorical steam from Nature's kitchen then just as un- expectedly becomes the steamy sweating surface of the flanks of real mares. And so forth: a veritable self-generating image- and sentence-producing machine can be glimpsed here at work behind the dextrous and imperceptible substitution of literal and figura- tive levels for each other. Looked at from a different angle, from that of the structure of these figures themselves, we have here evidently to do with what in Roman Jakobson's influential distinction would be described as the substitution of a metaphor for a metonymy; with a metony- mic figure subsequently transformed as though by sleight of hand into the complicated metaphor of nature as a vast machine. Better still, since the spell of the initial metonymic gesture is never really fully overcome, we have to do with a metaphoric process concealed behind the external trappings of metonymic transfer, with a metaphor which can apparently come into being only disguised as metonymy, or, contrariwise, with an analytical, additive, mechanistic, essentially metonyrmic surface movement which is secretly powered by the natural energy of metaphoric creation. What is achieved by this peculiar linguistic substitution is thus first and foremost a demystification of the process of creation it- self, an implicit repudiation of that valorization of metaphor, from Aristotle to Proust, as the "hallmark of genius," and of the es- sentially organic ideology for which the very essence of the poetic process is the perception, or indeed the invention, of analogies. And no doubt the primacy of metaphor is a projection of a liter- ary hierarchy in which poetry and poetic inspiration are felt to be somehow more lofty and more valuable than the humdrum referential production of prose: as Jakobson has shown, indeed, the basic mechanism of realistic prose is metonymy rather than metaphor: Following the path of contiguous relationships, the realistic author metonymically digresses from the plot to the atmosphere and from the characters to the setting in space and time. He is fond of synecdochic (letails. In the scene of Anna Karenina's suicide Tolstoy's artistic attention is focussed on the heroine's handbag; and in War and Peace the synecdoches "Hair on the upper lip" or "bare shoulders" are used by the same writer to stand for the female characters to whom these features belong. 297</page><page sequence="4">THE HUDSON REVIEW In Lewis, however, metonymy is a sign of the devaluation of inspiration itself, and of the art-sentence as a composed, sub- jectively ripe melodic unit in its own right. For the aesthetic of in- spiration is essentially a transcendental one, presupposing a chosen few who are the vessels of the sacred frenzy, and claiming for ar- tistic practice the status of some esoteric mystery which is closed to all but the initiated, the priesthood of "genius." The religious bias of such a concept of art is less noticeable in earlier, hierarchi- cal societies in which art and the artist have a well-defined social function; but in our own levelled and post-feudal world, the defense of aesthetic privilege and of the sacred character of met- aphor necessarily becomes an implicit political stance as well. Lewis' futurism is thus a profoundly anti-transcendental, demo- cratic gesture: the machine as against the luxury furnishings of the great estates, the production of sentences as against the creation of beauty or the masterpiece. Lewis was of course himself an elit- ist in politics and an adherent of the genius or great-man theory of history: all I want to suggest at the present is that his artistic practice, on the level of its smallest intelligible units, the sen- tences and the images themselves, has a quite different inner logic about it, and one which contradicts the spirit of his ideology. Not that Lewis' work is poor in metaphor either, on the contrary! Yet, as we have shown, that figural richness, not given to every- body, is instinctively restructured into metonymic forms and sur- faces which anyone could make up for himself, and nowhere is this clearer than in those idling passages where the voice of metaphor is silent and where metonymy functions on its own, motor wide-open, in a kind of additive sentence-production as ac- cessible to the common man as carpentry or literacy itself. Here we have, for example, the painstaking anatomy of the external world and of gesture; a kind of tireless visual inventory which reminds us of some of the more famous bravura or anti- bravura pieces in Tristram Shandy, and with which, given some initial object, page upon page might conveniently be filled: Don Alvaro could not have moved more slowly off the table had he been demonstrating the exercise to a slow-witted beginner in gymnastics: first he uncrossed his legs with a languorous slow- ness that suspended the leg he was thus translating for an ap- preciable accretion of seconds in mid-air; and he dropped it down beside the other with as much deliberation-as much inch by 298</page><page sequence="5">FREDRIC JAMESON inch-as if the floor which was to receive it had been a hot brick, or an uncomfortable icicle. In a passage of this kind the strong but perfunctory metaphors merely serve to reinforce, to sketch in, the step-by-step dismantling of the body's gestural machine. What such a style implies is that reality is infinitely divisible, that it can be rendered in sentences of any length, the most momentous upheavals dismissed in a single phrase, the tiniest atomic units of experience subdivided still further, towards some unimaginable infinitesimality; or else, what amounts to the same thing, that you can express a given phe- nomenon over and over again in a host of different, yet ultimately identical formulations. And like the body, the mind is a mechanism also, one which at its worst can be rendered in much the same additive fashion: "Pulley has been most terribly helpful and kind there's no use excusing himself Pulley has been most terribly helpful and kind- most terribly helpful and he's been kind. He's been most terribly kind and helpful, there are two things, he's been most kind he's been terribly helpful, he's kind he can't help being-he's terribly." This mindless babble is designed to represent what Lewis thought of as the gertrude "steining" of the modern child cult; yet it proceeds along the same fundamental aesthetic presuppositions as the external anatomies examined above and projects a notion of reality as something external and infinitely subdivisible, be- fore which the writer places himself like a draughtsman, pre- pared to blacken "tireless" quantities of pages in the represen- tation of any object set before him. The Apes of God (1932) is indeed a monument to this illimitable sentence-producing ca- pacity which is itself but a figure of man's productive power in the industrial age. This is not to imply that such production is always good or interesting in the old sense: on the contrary, immense arid stretches of Lewis' often hastily composed works are as much a deliberate insult to the reader's intelligence as they are a chal- lenge to the older ritualistic cult of Beauty or of fine writing. Yet paradoxically this is itself the source of the immensely liberat- ing energy of Lewis' style, for in it the principle of sheer sentence- production is somehow independent of all the individual sen- tences which it leaves strewn behind it, and of few writers can it be said in the same way that the verbal flaw, the bad or sloppy 299</page><page sequence="6">THE HUDSON REVIEW or mechanical writing, fails to damage the work itself. Joyce as a high priest had an obligation to invest every sentence with a kind of sacred character: for Lewis, on the contrary, it is the occasional lapse and verbal misfunction which stands as a sign and a confirmation of his mechanistic enterprise. For Lewis himself, there was no doubt a strong scientific bias at work in the systematic analysis and disjunction over which the metonymic pole presides: "burying Euclid deep in the living flesh," his characterization of the central impulse of his paint- ing, might also have served as a motto for the sentences them- selves. Yet in the present day and age, which has come to under- stand scientific research as essentially a question of model-build- ing, we are perhaps less intimidated by the prestige of science as absolute truth; more inclined, in the present context, to view the scientific component in Lewis' style as simply one vocabulary- field or terminological stock among a number of other, equally distinctive sub-languages: as for instance the deliberately flour- ished anglicisms and British colloquialisms such as "fuss" or "toddle," "beastly" and "strapping"; or again the explicitly "painterly" and technical characteristics of certain descriptive passages, as though carefully blocked off by the expert's thumb, extended to full distance. These word groups do not become assimilated to some larger unity of tone: on the contrary, their very function is to interfere with each other, to clash visibly within the sentence itself in such a way that no surface homo- geneity can reform, that the words, unable to go together prop- erly, project the warring planes and angles of a cubist painting. The sentence is thus an amalgam of heterogeneous forces which must not be allowed to congeal: hence the ultimate and inedu- cable unruliness of the Lewis style, half-baked by design, and structurally too scandalous for even the most accommodating Pantheon, as, emblematically, in his famous description of the Trolls: "hairy, surgical, and yet invisible." That the composition of such sentences is a visual process, a juxtaposition and collage of word-objects felt to possess visible and wellnigh tangible shapes, may be judged from the effects of Lewis' blindness; for unlike Joyce, the Lewis of the last years, able only to think or hear his language, reverts to an almost eighteenth-century sobriety, the fireworks of the earlier style passing over now into the content of the narratives. 3oo</page><page sequence="7">FREDRIC JAMESON 2 I have described the nature of my own humour-how, as I said, it went over into everything, making a drama of mock-violence of every social relationship. Why should it be so violent-so mock-violent-you may at the time have been disposed to enquire? Everywhere it has seemed to be compelled to go into some frame that was always a simulacrum of mortal combat. -The Wild Body This apparently indeterminable capacity of the sentence-pro- ducing mechanism, the seemingly random spreading measure- ments of the metonymic impulse, are however not permitted to operate unchecked: for it is clear that, proliferating according to their own internal logic, the sentence patterns we have de- scribed would result in nothing but vast sheets of surface decora- tion, vast additive descriptions of necessity static even when detailing the most violent external agitations, something like the excesses of early Beckett. The mode of Lewis' language is however narrative rather than lyrical, which means that its energies, diverted to the service of a succession of acts in time, are henceforth governed by the rigid inner structural limits of the story-line. Thus on the sentences is conferred an orientation in time and the thrust of movement directed: yet paradoxically it is out of the initially static situation of the artist-writer before his model that this narrative dynamism awakens, and the dominant, controlling form of action in Lewis is generated out of that seemingly con- templative stance of the detached observer which characterizes the narrator of The Wild Body and the title figure of Tarr, not to speak of Wyndham Lewis the painter himself. For no one is better placed than the draughtsman to understand the exchange of forces set up between the observing point of view and the thing contemplated, between the object and the eye that takes inventory of it: not some disembodied union of knower and known, but rather two mechanisms squaring off against each other, each quasi-automatically readjusting itself to the automatic movements of the other, as in the scene in The Childermass in which the zombie-like longshoreman poles his boat over against the figure (Pullman) observing him from the bank: "A stone's- throw out he stops, faces the shore, studying sombrely in per- spective the man-sparrow, who multiplies precise movements, an 301</page><page sequence="8">THE HUDSON REVIEW organism which in place of speech has evolved a peripatetic system of response to a dead environment. It has wandered be- side this Styx, a lost automaton rather than a lost soul. . .." Man-machine responding to environment, automata reacting to each other: the primal form, the archetypal organizational event, in Lewis is thus this reciprocal interaction of tics and twitches ordered into an obligatory circuit-this reflex of vasomotor ac- tion and reaction which may be described as a ceaseless perpetual exchange of sparks between any two existents felt as contrary or opposing poles. The privileged dramatic form of such an exchange is thus evidently dialogue itself: hence the exemplary reaction of the Bailiff to the intervention of his primal adversary Hyperides: "electrified at the impact of the new voice . .. he lights up all over. The sounds stagger his senses like a salvo from a gong an- nouncing battle from the positions of a legendary enemy. It is a hail from the contrary pole, it opens for him by magic the uni- verse that lies between which before the voice came was shut and dead." This is the very element of Lewis' novelistic world, this combative, exasperated yet jaunty stance of monads in collision, a kind of buoyant truculence in which matched and abrasive consciousnesses slowly rub into life against each other. It is, in- deed, as though for Lewis, who saw his privileged role as the essentially non-social one of artist or pure eye, the most desirable condition for human life remained that of solitude: thus the doomed lovers of the Revenge for Love wish for nothing better than to be left alone by their insistent contemporaries; while the ageing Lewis himself, longing for a world freed from parties and from the primacy of the political, just as in centuries gone by the secular mind yearned for release from the tyranny of the older religious absolutes, conceived some ultimate image of the peace of angelic and divine indifference. So one is tempted to think of the opening scene of Tarr as somehow symptomatic, as a kind of emblematic hesitation and reluctance against the unpropitious background of which all the later dramatic contacts in Lewis will take place: Hobson and Tarr met in the Boulevard du Paradis.-They met in a gingerly, shuffling fashion: they had so many good reasons for not slowing down when they met, numbers of antecedent meetings when it would have been better if they had kept on, all 302</page><page sequence="9">FREDRIC JAMESON pointing to why they should crush their hats over their eyes and hurry forward, so that it was a defeat and insanitary to have their bodies shuffling and gesticulating there. Under such circumstances all human relations are bound to have something vaguely ominous about them, and the more heightened moments of scandal or violence prove to be nothing but the convulsive effort to free oneself from one's interlocutor, or-as with the fearful Kreisler-to obliterate him in an ex- plosion of rage and black bile. Lewis thus takes his place in one of the most distinctive sub- traditions of the modern novel, in which it is sheer interpersonal- ity or intersubjectivity which comes to be seen as the essential and indeed the only genuine object of narrative representation. Such a sub-tradition, of course, emerges from the more general situ- ation of all modern literature, and as such reflects the universal disappearance of that older naive or "natural," unselfconscious, "realistic" storytelling, for which a kind of common sense reality exists, and the very categories of experience and the event have not yet become problematical. With the eclipse of this older belief in reality, the novelist comes to know a new hesitancy be- fore the raw materials of life, one which frees him for the most ruthless stylization: thus what, after Bakhtin, we may call the dialogical novel shares with the other sub-varieties of the mod- ern a kind of abstracting and generalizing tendency, a kind of con- structivistic and model-building freedom, weakening the hold of actuality itself and of the empirical situations of everyday life, which are no longer felt to be meaningful in all their concrete uniqueness, as events with settings and dates, as situations em- bedded in the very limits, inescapable, of history itself. Now on the contrary these concrete material determinations in which the human fact finds itself imprisoned have become so alienated and dehumanized as to feel utterly contingent, so that the writer's stylization-whatever form it may take-stands as an attempt to free private life from the nightmare of public and external his- tory. Such new forms are thus realistic and utopian all at once: for they clearly reflect the increasing subjectivization of individ- ual existence, the fear and revulsion of intellectuals before the new and ever more systematized external class conditions of in- dustrial society, the atomization and disintegration of the older and more traditional collective groups and social modes; at the 3o3</page><page sequence="10">THE HUDSON REVIEW same time that they incarnate a will to overcome the commodity reification of late nineteenth-century capitalism, to substitute for the mouldering and overstuffed bazaar of late Victorian life the mystique and the promise of some more intense and height- ened, more genuine existence. To take inventory of the various symbolic reactions to this historical situation would amount to an anatomy of modernism in general, in its most varied and contradictory forms, in which all the extremes of stylization are present, from the attempt to eliminate consciousness and logic, as hostages of a degraded culture or reality-principle, to efforts to extirpate matter as such and to fix in language some concentrated and liberated principle of pure spirit. No doubt the most influential form of such styl- ization, as far as the novel is concerned, is that represented, as by its insignia, by the "discovery" of the monologue interieur, and characterized by the exploration, from the inside, of the individ- ual consciousness and preconscious, of the very inner reality of the monad itself. It is from such an essentially subjectivistic and indeed often solipsistic type of form that we must learn to distinguish the interactional or dialogical model of life which Lewis' novels practice. The ill-assorted representatives of such a new sub-variety would doubtless number such works as those of Lewis' contemporary D. H. Lawrence; as those passionate in- termonadic dialogues in which Russian novelists from Dostoy- evsky to Olesha struggle to overcome that characteristic inner sense of grotesqueness, that endemic ego-deficiency or identity failure which, virtually a Russian literary tradition, resulted from the backwardness of the Russian bourgeoisie; as those French novels of our own time which, under the galvanic shock of Sartre's description of the Look and of our alienation by the Other, have sought to project their new vision of this dimension of life in the varying modes of Simone de Beauvoir's L'Invitee, of the elliptical and ritualistic communions of Marguerite Duras, of Nathalie Sarraute with her feeling for human relations as the virtually instinctual stirrings of organic tropisms. It is indeed Nathalie Sarraute who with her concept of the "sub-conversation" has perhaps best defined, long after the fact, the structure of the kind of novel we are here considering: for the term designates and presupposes a situation in which the ap- parent, surface conversation is no longer the real one; in which 304</page><page sequence="11">FREDRIC JAMESON beneath the routine and insignificant spoken exchange there comes into view some more fundamental human drama, some deeper wordless groping struggle or interaction. It is as though the old ordinary language of everyday life had ceased to be an adequate vehicle for individual expression or communication: brittle with clich6, great surfaces of it corroded by publicity and received ideas, that commercialized and conventionalized lan- guage begins to break apart, leaving deserts of silence visible be- tween the cracks. Here genuine human life continues to exist, but as it were underground, beneath the dead surface of social routine and convention, and the task of the novelist becomes that of recuperating that deeper reality and of inventing a new language in which its preverbal or nonverbal events and inci- dents can be somehow adequately rendered. The narrative of the interpersonal novel will therefore be a split-level one in its very structure, for it presupposes the con- tinuing existence of that banal surface reality which it aims to undermine. By the same token, it is characterized by a relentless expansion and distortion of that everyday situation itself, a dila- tion of daily life into the transparent immobility of the eternal afternoons, the eternal teas and Sunday morning strolls of Prous- tian narrative, its deceleration into that strange slow-motion sleepwalking tempo in which the audible reply hangs and holds fire and echoes for long pages during which the realer, swarming, tacit interactions take place, those of the "pregnant" or "mean- ingful" silences of a Henry James, of the breathless stillness of Faulknerian evocation, or again, of that charged and menacing silence of Wyndham Lewis' characters, a silence of repressed vi- olence "of such a quality that if it continued but a very little longer, spontaneous combustion must occur in response to it." The differences between these various practitioners of the di- alogical novel can of course be expected to emerge from the way in which each conceives of the nature of that underlying, pre- verbal reality, that more fundamental but sublinguistic sign system, as well as in the mode in which each attempts to bring it to new speech. At one extreme the novelist can simply explain the deeper significance of the insignificant words and gestures of his characters, taking their banal and realistic, desultory con- versations apart, as it were from above, painstakingly, with tweezers, and carefully expounding the new pattern of clues 305</page><page sequence="12">THE HUDSON REVIEW concealed in an indifferent reality. The originality of Henry James, indeed, was to have projected this analytical activity back into his characters themselves, who thus become virtual spe- cialists trained in an adept and hyperconscious conversational linguistics, possessing their own specialized terminology and their own analytical methods, their reflections constituting a virtual metalanguage with respect to the conversational material upon which they work ("the 'everything' clearly struck him, to the point even of determining his reply," "there were moreover the other facts of the selection and decision that this demonstration of her own had required," etc.). At the other extreme, we find a novelist like Nathalie Sar- raute herself attempting to characterize the quality of such inter- action globally, and as it were from the outside, in the form of an image or metaphor, most frequently that obsessive organic imagery which inspires the narrator of Martereau to feel that other people "irresistibly secrete on contact with me a sub- stance like the liquid which certain species give off to blind their prey." For the most part, however, the reduplicated vertical struc- ture of such a narrative is articulated by the simple substitution of a new and vigorous language for the old, outworn one which the characters speak but which no longer expresses anything: for if it is so that with the decay of speech, hitherto inanimate and speechless objects and realities begin to speak with a language of their own, then the novelist has only to give them voice, to lend them his own voice as it were by proxy for the silence to be filled at once by an intelligible babel of messages of all kinds. Thus Bertha's room itself emits its own characteristic note, "cheap and dead, but rich with the same lifelessness as the trees with- out" (Tarr): while later on "the abject little room seemed to be thrust forward to awaken his memories and ask for pity. An in- tense atmosphere of teutonic suicide permeated everything; he could not move an eyelid or a muscle without wounding or slighting something: it was like being in a dark kitchen at night, where you know at every step you will put your foot upon a beetle . . ." Such an entity as this room is clearly a living being, a character, an agent of the heroine herself, something on the order of the more ignoble Racinian confidentes. Other such objects, indeed, (and there can be no doubt that 306</page><page sequence="13">FREDRIC JAMESON in some deep Bachelardian fashion Lewis was fascinated his whole life long by rooms and houses, by dwellings of all kinds) live the momentary life of a minor character, or bit parts of auxil- iary "cameo" appearances, as in the following biographical sketch in which, as in trick cinematography, a whole organic life- process is visible, speeded up before our eyes: The Restaurant Vallet, like many of its neighbours, had been originally a clean tranquil little creamery, consisting of a small shop a few feet either way. Then one after another its customers had lost their reserve: they had asked, in addition to their daily glass of milk, for c6tes de pre sale and similar massive nourish- ment, which the decent little business at first supplied with timid protest. But perpetual scenes of unbridled voracity, semesters of compliance with the most brutal appetities of man, gradually brought about a change in its character; it became frankly a place where the most full-blooded palate might be satisfied. As trade grew the small business had burrowed backwards into the ram- shackle house: bursting through walls and partitions, flinging down doors, it discovered many dingy rooms in the interior that it hurriedly packed with serried cohorts of eaters. It had driven out terrified families, had hemmed the apoplectic concierge in her 'loge,' it had broken out on to the court at the back in shed- like structures: and in the musty bowels of the house it had es- tablished a broiling luridly lighted roaring den, inhabited by a fierce band of slatternly savages. At the same time, if inanimate objects develop character and begin to function as actors in the drama, the animate them- selves, the "real people" equally well tend to fragment into a host of smaller units, and the gestural organs of the body, perhaps be- cause they are more closely associated with the older common sense view of human reality and because they are customarily supposed to "express" thoughts and feelings, become if anything less articulate than the surrounding landscape: The over flesh-coloured face (as if violently pretending to be flesh and blood at all costs) with the preposterous false bottom to it gazed at the portrait. It gazed and gazed with a cowlike, cud- chewing concentration. All the irritability of the last fortnight or more of suspense smouldered in the capacious false bottom of this fauxbonhomme's headpiece-with its leaden secretions it weighed down this impossibly innocent chin. For it could be a receptacle on occasion for dissatisfaction, as well as for bluff "kindliness." The complete gamut of hatred felt by its owner for this disaffected craftsman expressed itself in the expression- 307</page><page sequence="14">THE HUDSON REVIEW less eyes, as their vacuity deepened from blankness to abysses of utter blankness, from a bland blankness to a brutish blankness, from Pickwick or Pecksniff to the orang-outang: till nature's dark abhorrence of a vacuum-of such a vacuum!-became so intol- erable as to be really malignant. In this world of fragmented and then restructured and re- charged objects and forces we are now plunged up to the eyes: now reality is so close up against us as to be blurred and un- recognizable: "'Oh dis-m'aimes-tu? Dis que tu m'aimes!' A blurt- ing, hurrying personality rushed right up into his face. He was very familiar with it. It was like the sightless clammy charging of a bat. Humbug had tempestuously departed: their hot-house was suffering a blast of outside air. He stared at her face groping up as though it scented mammals in his face: it pushed to right, then to left, and rocked itself." Such stifling involvement in reality, and particularly in a reality thus defamiliarized, amounts to a kind of ascesis, for both writer and reader: it offers a descent into a situation without any perspectives, any breathing space, without the mental relief of the overview or of relativizing judge- ment. This event, this text, is now for the moment everything, and we must live our entire life, for the time, within its narrow confines. At the same time we have here to do with a profound trans- formation in the substances with which narrative works, with the basic tokens of storytelling, the characters and settings, the actors, the very fundamental categories and building blocks from which plot is constructed. The older novel with its recognizable "characters" was still under the domination of what the Struc- turalists would call the humanistic paradigm: still dependent, in other words, on a received notion of a preexisting human nature and on an illusion of the autonomy of individual life and individual consciousness. It is precisely the disintegration of such categories which D. H. Lawrence evokes in a famous letter in which he reflects on the deeper mission of Futurism: What is interesting in the laugh of the woman is the same as the binding of the molecules of steel or their action in heat; it is the inhuman will, call it physiology, or like Marinetti -physiology of matter, that fascinates me. I don't so much care about what the woman feels-in the ordinary usage of the word. That presumes an ego to feel with .... You mustn't look in my novel for the old 3o8</page><page sequence="15">FREDRIC JAMESON stable ego-of the character. There is another ego, according to whose action the individual is unrecognisable, and passes through, as it were, allotropic states which it needs a deeper sense than any we've been used to exercise, to discover are states of the same radically unchanged element. (Like as diamond and coal are the same pure single element of carbon. The ordinary novel would trace the history of the diamond-but I say, "Diamond, whatl This is carbon." And my diamond might be coal or soot, and my theme is carbon.) So Lawrence proposes a total overhaul of the very raw ma- terials of narrative construction: and in this he is very close in- deed to Lewis himself, with the latter's idiosyncratic notion of art as satire, which he understood to be a non-ethical, purely ex- ternal mode of representation, cubist-caricatural, its objective and materialistic techniques fundamentally set against all the shape- less warm organic flux of inner monologue and psychology- oriented subjectivism. For both writers, therefore, the attack on the older subjective literary categories amounts to what the Russian and Czech Formalists would have described as an at- tempt to shatter the numb habituation of routine daily life, with its common sense assurances of individual reality, and to replace it with some other, more forbidding, less human and familiar one which, by sapping the mystifications of private and personal consciousness, allows a glimpse of the larger suprapersonal forces at work in what we call human life. Paradoxically, however, this profound internal modification of the raw materials of plot does not so much subvert the latter as rather ultimately cause it to be reinvented afresh, as it were ab ovo, in a return to the most primitive anecdotal techniques and forms of storytelling from out of which the later, highly so- phisticated structures of the nineteenth-century novel ultimately developed. For half a century of stylized abstraction in all the media, Freud's revelation of the inner logic of dreams, the nar- rative models of Propp and Greimas, have all in their various ways shown us that narrative is a pure temporal form the content of which is relatively indifferent: it is not the substance and in- trinsic interest of the actors which make up the story, but rather, quite the opposite, the narrative structure which creates the actors themselves. For the dreaming mind, indeed, an intelligible "plot" can be instinctively fashioned out of the most heterogeneous odds and ends, the contents of a bathroom cupboard, say, which little 309</page><page sequence="16">THE HUDSON REVIEW by little, in their interaction, come to be invested with something of the meaning and "personality" of pieces on a chess-board. So, for Tarr, Bertha's room, the bust of Beethoven, but also his own thoughts, some of them stale and obsessive, others with the un- recognizable insolence of some insistent advertisement, words that float across consciousness with a mysterious life of their own like unfamiliar but evidently powerful new characters, half- looks that draw unpleasant attention to themselves, drumming fingers which repeat some urgent yet incomprehensible message, faces like ominous buildings in which a whole host of enemies lies in dangerous ambush. Yet this implicit reinvention of storytelling in modern litera- ture lacks all the stark monumentality, all the grim gestural simplicity, of the emergent anecdotal forms of the time of Dante and Giotto, of Boccaccio: for it is no longer with the freshness of origins in a void and in an untouched language that literature it- self can here be reinvented. Rather, the renewal must be ef- fectuated within the confines of dead storytelling conventions which remain massively in place, in a world already overin- fected with culture and with dead forms and a stifling weight of dead ideas. In this new situation, therefore, the novelist is not so much a creative, as rather a performing, artist: his "book" or "scenario" is handed him from the outset, in the form of the banal situations of a degraded everyday life, gossipy women, impecunious Bohemia, a dreary love-spat: his "composition" of these scenes is in reality an interpretation of them, and he gives them new life in much the same way that an actor's voice re- stores vitality to an exhausted text. So at this late hour in Western culture the novelist must intervene in his very situations themselves, speaking on behalf of the gestures of his characters, which are henceforth too commonplace to discharge any intrin- sic meaning of their own. For the mediocre lovers' quarrel, for Tarr's clumsy gesture of affection which solves nothing, must be substituted some new and as it were alternative story-line, a bus- tling and lively second-degree narrative which comes into being behind the initial, inert and static one: Docilely she covered him with her inertia. He was supposed to be performing a miracle of bringing the dead to life. Gone about too crudely, the willing mountebank, Death, had been offended: it is not thus that great spirits are prevailed upon to flee. Her "indif- 310</page><page sequence="17">FREDRIC JAMESON ference"-the great, simulated and traditional-would not be ousted by an upstart and younger relative. By Tarr himself, grown repentant, yes. But not by another "indifference." Such a passage is something more than mere extended meta- phor: it amounts to the virtual replacement of the older "real" event by a complete new narrative in miniature, one in which the older psychological "attributes" of the "characters"-indif- ference, reluctance, a pang of wounded pride-are transformed into actors and characters in their own right, with their own allegorical story to tell. At the same time, however, this actantial enrichment only serves to link the two actors ever more closely together in their common enterprise: the latter has lost its conventional unity and name ("a lovers' quarrel") while becoming the concrete em- bodiment of interaction in general. Social life thus becomes a contest of every instant, in which one can make the right or the wrong move: Bertha planning the proper explanation for her public embrace by Kreisler decides that "as long a time as possible must be allowed to elapse before she referred to it directly. It must almost seem as though she were going to say nothing; im- pressive silence-nothing. Their minds, accustomed to her si- lence, would, when it came, find the explanation all the more im- pressive." So, in such a struggle, all of one's gestures, even one's silences, are mobilized and take on the value of signs, organized by larger strategic concepts. Unfortunately, however, one can also be trumped or outflanked by one's principal opponent: thus Fraulein Liepman, in a shrewd and instinctive countermove, dismisses Kreisler as unworthy of any further comment what- soever. Bertha's story had come uncomfortably and difficultly to flower. No one seemed to want to hear it. She wished she had not waited so long. But, the matter put in the light given it by Fraulein Liepman, she must not delay: she was, there was no question about it, in some sense responsible for Kreisler. It was her duty to explain him: but now Fraulein Liepman had put an embargo on explanations: there were to be no more explanations. The sub- ject was drawing perilously near the point where it would be dropped ... In such a universe, official scandal is merely the explosion into actuality of what is everywhere latent, or, if you prefer, the un- 311</page><page sequence="18">THE HUDSON REVIEW expected coincidence of the two levels, the eruption of the ma- terials of the sub-conversation as though for the first time into the explicit language and overt acts of the conventional dia- logue itself. In the long run, however, the dialogical model comes to dis- place the dramatic "scene" as a narrative form, and to tie the raw materials of the situation together in a new and closer kind of systematization. So Kreisler's relationship to his friend Ernst Vokt has all the biological intimacy of borrower to borrowee: "He was now in a position analogous to that of a man who had been separated for some months from his wife: he was in a lux- urious hurry once more to see the colour of Vokt's gold." Now all of the dealings between the two are drawn together in a single overall dramatic image of which the various episodes are but ongoing developments. For something has changed: "it was only gradually that he realized of how much more value Vokt's money now was, and what before was an unorganized mass of specie, in which the professional borrower could wallow, was now a sound and suitably conducted business." So what in more tradi- tional works were simply figures and metaphorical characteri- zations of a concrete situation here take on the value of form in their own right, become new events of which the older "real" episodes are but the support and secondary enrichment: "it was [Soltyk] who had superseded Kreisler in the position of in- fluence as regards Vokt's purse. But Soltyk did not borrow a hundred marks: his system was far more up to date. Ernst had experienced an unpleasant shock in coming into contact with Kreisler's clumsy and slovenly money habits again." Thus or- ganized, such an "event" is prepared and preformed to bear new kinds of meanings, both instinctual and political-national, par- ticularly in such a passage as the one we have just quoted, where Kreisler's "method" collides with Soltyk's in tones reminis- cent of the shock between lower and higher cultures. In so many ways, the novelist "edits" his footage and like a movie-maker transforms the givens of his initial story into a fin- ished montage, as into purely cinematographic events which live a temporal life of their own on their own terms. In so doing, he would appear to have reversed the priorities of Coleridge's dis- tinction between fancy and imagination: for what is operative today is the essentially decorative work of fancy itself as it trans- 312</page><page sequence="19">FREDRIC JAMESON forms the bare structure of the facts, of the basic situation or scenario, with its bare dialogue and sparse scenic and gestural indications, into a complicated series of sub-events, swarming with microscopic agitation. As for imagination, the primal shap- ing power of the mind, the very source of plot-formation in its most august Aristotelian sense, it has lived: and its dead monu- ments are what oppress creative spontaneity, its forms appro- priated and trivialized by the commodity culture. If to anyone, it is perhaps more to the reader than to the writer himself that some- thing of the older function of imagination still falls: for after the essentially analytic and nominalistic work of the novelist in frag- menting his initial situation into the more vivid incidents of his sub-conversations, it is the reader who is called upon to re- invent that external form itself, once more to plot the vast, slow curve of the dialogue, and to restore to the newly minted present of the novelist's language that absent whole of which its moments are the parts. 3 Such is what might be called the vertical composition of the type of narrative under examination here, its multilevel com- plexity permitted to develop to the full by the stable and es- sentially simple framework of the dialogue-struggle or agon be- tween two characters within which, in such works as Tarr (1918) or The Revenge for Love (1937), it takes place. Yet the horizontal dimension of Lewis' works, that which marks them off as interactional or dialogical narratives in the sense indicated above, is perhaps most clearly visible to the naked eye there where it is most abstract, and in that work of Lewis which would least seem to merit the qualification. In The Childermass (1928), indeed, the very preconditions for the sub-event or the sub-conversation would seem to be abol- ished: for there is no longer any surface reality lined with some fundamental one, the very existence of reality itself is called in question, according to the generic rules of theological science fiction all the inner resistance of matter is annulled by definition, so that we find ourselves before the most delirious and bewil- dering succession of transformations, not merely of individual com- ponents, but of the entire world-structure as a whole. With this immense overcrowding of the shores of the dead by the fear- 313</page><page sequence="20">ful "slaughter of the innocents" of World War I, the reader has indeed come as close as language can bring him to a pure and uncontrolled experience of sheer sense perception, to that virtual obliteration of the external common sense world by the nominalistic chaos of sensation which seethed beneath the surface of the split-narrative described above. The adventures of its heroes Pullman and Satterthwaite among the treacherous and shifting "time-flats" mark a kind of outside limit of hallucinatory narration, one no longer representational, no longer viewed through the "fourth wall" of some stable observer, but where indeed the observer himself (and with him the reader) is sucked into the ceaseless whirling flux of perpetual change, shedding his identity along with that of his object. The Childermass thus constitutes a supreme object for linguistic analysis, whatever its excesses as a novel, and stands as a kind of monument to the outer limits of certain expressive capacities of language itself. It is precisely under such conditions that we are able to articu- late the vast formal and structural differences between the es- sentially narrative mode of Lewis' fantasmagoria, and the lyri- cal one of the shapeless, daydreaming, solipsistic "poetic prose" of many of his contemporaries: in The Childermass the actual words themselves are a secondary reflex of the events unfold- ing according to their determinate structure, while the language of the latter (we may think, for example, of Lewis' bete noire Virginia Woolf), in its haste to isolate the pure impression from the things themselves, ends up as hollow and as insubstantial as the aimless reveries which are its object. The world of the monad, in short, lacks that inner resistance without which nar- rative sentences cannot come into being; and the equally rich subjective material of dialogical narrative is distinguished from that of such impressionism above all by the presence of another consciousness, another pole, an Other: these inner dramas composed of attacks, triumphs, recoils, de- feats, caresses, bites, rapes, murders, generous renunciations or humble submissions, all have one thing in common: they cannot do without a partner . . . he is preeminently the catalyzer, the stimulant, thanks to whom these movements are set in motion, the obstacle that gives them cohesion, that keeps them from grow- ing soft from ease and gratuitousness, or from going round and round in circles in the monotonous indigence of ruminating on one thing. He is the threat, the real danger as well as the prey THE HUDSON REVIEW 314</page><page sequence="21">FREDRIC JAMESON that brings out their alertness and their suppleness, the mysteri- ous element whose unforeseeable reactions, by making them con- tinually start up again and evolve toward an unknown goal, ac- centuate their dramatic nature (Nathalie Sarraute, The Age of Suspicion). When we turn now to The Childermass, it becomes clear that this inner principle of stability and of resistance and density as well, which in the realistic novels took the form of dramatic strug- gle, is here hypostasized in the very existence of the couple itself. The team of Pullman and his old school chum, the imbecilic Sat- ters, thus takes its place among the great tandems of literary history, from Don Quixote and Sancho, to Bouvard and Pecuchet and Vladimir and Estragon, fulfilling much the same function. For the isolated, monadic consciousness, indeed, there can be no way of distinguishing some inner hallucinatory fantasy from the objective metamorphoses of this precarious and unstable after- world; nor can there remain any means of maintaining the unity of the personality in time through its ceaseless transmigra- tions. Whereas in Lewis' scheme, whatever Pulley or Satters turn into, their relationship to each other remains the same and per- mits continuing identification. Thus Satters becomes a baby, an old man, a navvy, a cockney soldier, a vamp and a public school boy in rapid succession: yet Pullman, changing age and temperament to follow suit, continues to perceive him as "the same." No doubt some of these metamorphoses may be thought of as simple figures of speech, intended to dramatize mere pass- ing attitudes and characteristics: thus Pullman's protective and bossy behavior towards his wayward charge earns him the per- sona of Nurse Pullman, "distant and strong-minded, not-sniffing, not-offended, a tart smart tight little governess." Yet where the world of the "time-flats" meets the deepest impulses of Lewis' ex- pressionism, the very distinction between the literal and the fig- urative is abolished, since reality as such is suspended and what was hitherto metaphoric now takes place "for real." In another sense, it can be said that the personalities of Pull- man and Satters are somehow less real than what happens to them: they are themselves functions of their situation, mechan- ically adapting to its fate. Thus character in the older sense (what the most fundamental identity of Pullman must be, the literal referent of the metaphoric characterization) proves to be 315</page><page sequence="22">THE HUDSON REVIEW itself subordinate to the interpersonal relationship of which it is but a pole: the old, hitherto introspectively explored subjective qualities of the autonomous monad now take second place to the structural network in which it finds definition and on whose disposition its own is closely dependent. "The time- and class- scales in which they hang in reciprocal action are oscillating violently, as they rush up and down through neighbouring di- mensions they sight each other only imperfectly." Such is the ultimate source of what is perhaps the most char- acteristic feature of Lewis' storytelling on the stylistic level: that shaping power of apposition or epithet which comes to the sur- face as an omnipresent device in The Childermass. "Ka Pull- man," "Bill-Sikes-Satters," "big burning Gretchen," "the Styx- side sheikh"-such qualifications announce transformations in course and foretell the "metaphorical" content of the events about to be witnessed, the dramatic code, in short, in which the situation will now momentarily be staged, the costumes appro- priate to this particular episode. The very syntactical rhythm of apposition itself, dangling before the fact, and drawn up taut by the sentence that reels it in, signals the changing of slides on the machine, emits the click with which a new image, full-blown, emerges onto the screen of perception: "A hieratic huge-headed bat, with raised arms the Bailiff protests in a thick patter of ex- postulation." The wing-like draperies hanging from the waving arms, the head poised as though in flight, the whole ominous image is flattened like a silhouette against the backdrop of space; it has nothing of the piecemeal life in time of normal perception, in which random scraps and fragments are gradually unified into manageable perspectives. It is indeed the very opposite of that impressionistic procedure which Proust characterized as a fidelity to perceptual experience itself, a presentation "of things in the order of our perceptions, rather than by first accounting for them by their causes." Here, on the contrary, the Gestalt comes first: it is the nameable phenomenon in its totality which then governs the subsequent emergence of its different parts and components. And as on the level of the image, so also on the larger scene of dramatic interaction: it is the overall characteri- zation which dictates the very terms of the event's unfolding as well as the latest transformations of the characters involved: "The ox is felled: Satters as Keystone giant receives the crack 316</page><page sequence="23">FREDRIC JAMESON 317 exactly in the right spot, he sags forward in obedient overthrow, true to type -as though after a hundred rehearsals, true to a second-and crashes to earth as expected, rolling up a glazed eyeball galore, the correct classical Keystone corpse of Jack-the- Giantkiller comedy." The very use of preexisting conventional- ized roles (Keystone comedy, Jack the Giantkiller) is inscribed in the sentences themselves as a slavish and comic "obedience" of reality to its archetypes: so the atomic elements of perception race to fill their appropriate stations in the Gestalt. Such striking and almost hypertrophied overdevelopment of the appositional or epithet-forming function of language is fur- ther assisted, and at the same time depersonalized, it seems to me, by the curious indifference of this style for the events which take place within it: "A veteran rat trotting in an aerial gutter, [Pullman] catches a glimpse of glittering chasms but averts his eyes." The unpleasant overtones of the new avatar remain some- how unrecorded by the medium, which seems to transcend both pejorative and sympathetic at once. It is as though the whole mechanism of empathy or indeed of ethical judgement were switched off at the source, and this is so even in those works where Lewis is most deeply and autobiographically engaged: thus "Can- tleman shook noisily in the wicker chair like a dog or a fly-blown old gentleman." This is not Lewis judging himself from the out- side; rather an almost pathological depersonalization releases the personality itself from all favoritism, and prepares it to un- dergo a ceaseless mutability in its narrative qualifications. The apposition is thus not unlike the actor's stage directions, which govern the new scenery, makeup, and physical attitudiniz- ing in which the characters will anew reappear; and Lewis' prac- tice in The Childermass inevitably recalls that paradoxical struc- ture of the reading play of which we have spoken elsewhere and of which the Nighttown scene in Ulysses is a particularly striking example. Yet the metamorphoses in Ulysses seem to me to be the end-results of quite a different process than that at work in Lewis: they ratify the completion of pastiche, the climax of an essentially stylistic evocation ("And they beheld Him even Him, ben Bloom Elijah, amid clouds of angels ascend to the glory of the brightness at an angle of forty-five degrees over Donohoe's in Little Green Street like a shot off a shovel"), or else they rep- resent unexpected dramatizations of private thoughts of Bloom</page><page sequence="24">THE HUDSON REVIEW throughout the day, implicit commentaries on the consequences of his fantasies as they intersect the coordinates of external re- ality and the social conditions of Dublin: Under an arch of triumph Bloom appears bareheaded, in a crim- son velvet mantle trimmed with ermine, bearing Saint Edward's staff. . . . Bloom with asses' ears seats himself in the pillory with crossed arms, his feet protruding. ... A charming soubrette with dauby cheeks, mustard hair and large male hands and nose, leering mouth. . . . Pigeonbreasted, bottleshouldered, padded, in non- descript juvenile grey and black striped suit, too small for him, white tennis shoes, bordered stockings with turnover tops, and a red school cap with badge.... The raw material of these transformations is thus not unlike that used by Lewis, but it is here mediated through Bloom's subjectivity and is read in correlation with Bloom's inner rev- eries earlier in the day or with events in his past life, the whole unified by the stylistic tone in which all contradictions are ironically resolved as well as by the overall unity of Mr. Bloom's personality. Whereas in Lewis it is not the unification but rather the disper- sal of subjectivity which is aimed at; and as we have already seen, homogeneity of tone is neither desired nor achieved. If Joyce composes by tone (such might be essentially the definition of pastiche), Lewis composes by phrase, by larger word-units drawn from various sources which are never completely subdued and mastered by the overall form of the sentence itself. And as with these various ready-made and free-floating bits of speech, so also the content of the various transformations themselves derives, not from some previously prepared symbolism developed in the course of the work, but rather from a more general and external supraindividual cultural storehouse. Tying their chokers, trotting clowns hurrying at the crack of the magisterial circus-whip, the six scuttle and trip, but never fall, the ground rising in pustules at their feet to mock them, the wind clipping them on the ear, or pushing them upon the ob- structions arranged for them to amuse the idiot-universe. They skip and dance on the bulky treacherous surface of the earth, stoic beneath nature's elemental hot-fisted cuffs, tumblers or Shakespearean clowns, punchballs got up as Pierrot. The shifting appositions (circus clowns, Shakespearean clowns, Pierrot) program the events of the sentences in progress, and, as 318</page><page sequence="25">FREDRIC JAMESON received images, are reflected in the outer form of the language itself by the constant play with received idioms (i.e., "hot-fisted cuffs" as a portmanteau of the expression "hot tempered" and the word "fisticuffs," the whole refashioned on the model of "tight- fisted"). The great sentences of Lewis therefore have little enough in common with that Flaubertian esthetic of the mot juste of which Joyce with his strategically placed adverbs and his Paterian unc- tion represents the most characteristic modern realization: the conviction that sense perception can ultimately be fully rendered in sentences, that a parole pleine is possible, that the world re- ally does exist to end up in a Book which will replace it and in which the glint of sunlight on a pond, the stir of wind upon the earth's surface, will thus forever gleam and mildly tremble in the eternal immobility of the printed page. At the same time, there can be no doubt that Lewis fulfills an- other and very different tendency at work in the style of Flaubert, that namely of the sottisier and the dictionary of "received ideas." For insofar as Lewis' raw material is drawn directly from the warehouse of cultural cliche, the junk materials of a mass indus- trial society with its degraded art products and mechanical asso- ciations and mental representations, its force depends on the degree to which these commonplaces are already known to us: "Satters fully dressed is propped within, his lush bulk pitched against the jamb, occupying the breach in beefy sinuosity, his curled head bent somewhat to clear the lintel, his eyes cast archly up. The smile of Leonardo's St. John, appropriated to the fea- tures of a germanic ploughboy, sustains an expression of heavy mischief." I am tempted to say that where in Joyce such cul- tural and advertising archetypes are somehow reinvented, or at least suffused with Mr. Bloom's own subjectivity, adopted by him to the point where they are transformed into a kind of genuine inner and private symbolism, in Lewis they preserve their own autonomy, and the prestige of the no longer adequately vis- ualizable masterpiece of Leonardo, diffused through Sunday rotogravures and banalized by art appreciation, shoots forth a dis- tant and degraded ray to strike this passage with a spurious glow as the sign that this new face of Satters has been certified as visualizable by experts in some absent precinct of an official cul- ture. 319</page><page sequence="26">THE HUDSON REVIEW The collage-composition practiced by Lewis is thus a reflec- tion of the increasing and inescapable influence of mass culture in modern times, of what the Structuralists would call the Sym- bolic Order: that systematized network of cultural code and representation which preexists the individual and which speaks and invents him just as surely as language itself. In such a situa- tion, indeed, there no longer exists anything like a personal or individualized speech, like a private thought: we merely practice conventionalized formulae whose form dictates its own content. Nor do we know any genuine experience any longer, for the degraded culture intervenes between us and our objects as well, substituting for them, with imperceptible sleight-of-hand, some standardized snapshot. Yet those who in such a situation continue to believe in a natural language, in the possibility of some genuinely expressive and immediate speech, fall most surely victim to the whole illusionistic structure reared around them and of whose existence they prefer to remain unaware. Lewis' method is on the contrary to use the clich6 against it- self; or rather to pit clich6s on the level of gestural images against the verbal cliches with which the actual sentences themselves are corroded. So a kind of perceptual freshness is reinvented in the following account of Pullman's movements as he offers to help Satters to his feet: "Stalking and stretching tense-legged, in a succession of classical art-poses suggestive of shadow-archery, he approaches Satters. He relaxes like the collapse of a little house of cards, extends a friendly lackadaisical hand, and sings out: 'Up again, come jump to it!'" The visual cliche is here broken into its component parts and verbalized in segments of verbal commonplace, so that the latter are not able to discharge their automatic meaning-effect, but, neutralized against each other's resistance, remain as imperatives to visualize the central gesture. Yet we must already know what that gesture is, otherwise the words cannot convey it to us: "Pullman several times is parted from one of his slippers, having to stop to reinsert his foot and prise it up with humped toes." The knowledge of the musuclar operation thus lends the sentence the force of a recall. "He sat upon a cushion, leoninely slumped back against the panelling, as if luxuriating in a technical knockout." The sentence thus hangs midway between two received images, that of sprawling against 320</page><page sequence="27">FREDRIC JAMESON a sofa, and that other newsreel image of the boxer leaning seated against the ropes: oddly enough the metaphor does not serve to intensify the literal term, but rather to bear it off along with it into conventionality, at the same time leaving us with some unspeci- fied sense of the intensity of their twin object or referent, the "real" and absolutely unique Victor sprawling against that unique sofa in an unrepeatable moment of time. So it is that over the great moments in Lewis there hangs a strange and nagging sense of dejd-vu. The very appearance of the Bailiff, for instance, strikes you as being somehow as vivid as a car- toon character, or a creature out of fairy tales, as archetypal as all great character-creation, yet as familiar as the household bo- geyman: Tapping on the flags of the court with a heavy stick, his neck works in and out as though from a socket, with the darting reptilian rhythm of a chicken. His profile is balanced, as he advances, be- hind and before by a hump and paunch. He wears a long and sombre caftan. His wide sandalled feet splay outwards as he walks at the angle and in the manner of a frog. No neck is visible, the chin appearing to issue from and return into the swelling gallinace- ous chest.... He is all grinning vulpine teeth, puckered eyes, formidable declination of the ant-eating nose, rubicond cheeks, eyes of phosphor. The goatee waggles on the glazed bulbous chin; it is the diabolics of the most ancient mask in the world exulting in its appropriate setting. We almost seem to remember such a figure, and are astonished that he needed to wait as long as for Lewis to be invented for the first time. Yet Falstaff and Quasimodo are products of genuine mythopoetic creation: their silhouettes dramatize the originality and the unity of their inner concepts; whereas Lewis' Bailiff is intense because he is put together out of the most vivid bits and pieces which lend him their own borrowed intensity: the chicken-walk, the hump, the caftan, the devil's mask, all are pieced together in a collage, and Lewis' evocation of the Bailiff is thus as dishonest and as artificial as the Bailiff himself. Yet if Lewis' style thereby seems to renounce what the novelist has customarily been supposed to achieve-some sense of the wellnigh physiological uniqueness of landscape and feature, of event, a visionary conviction as to the unforeseeable presence of his scenes in time-his sentence creation proves to have affinities 321</page><page sequence="28">THE HUDSON REVIEW with a different type of narrative construction altogether. "Milton in the language of Swift": the force of Hugh Kenner's characteri- zation of The Human Age springs no doubt from the unexpected reversal, in which the former is implicitly distinguished, not for his rhetorical and metrical construction, but rather as a maker of plots and a storyteller; and there can be no doubt that we return to Paradise Lost with new eyes when, after having read The Hu- man Age, we see the older epic as a precursor of science fiction. Yet there are other, deeper affinities as well. For artificial epic, from Vergil to that last and ripest of the Ro- mantic narratives, the Pan Tadeusz of Mickiewicz, is an eclectic structure which combines elements of both poetic and narrative modes. Unlike genuine epic, with its formulaic basis, artificial epic emerges into a world in which prose narrative already exists and to which it therefore stands as a formal alternative: unlike prose narrative, however, it takes as its object of representation not the events and actions themselves but rather the describing of them, the process whereby such raw materials are seized and im- mobilized in the heightened and embellished speech of verse. There is thus already present in such a genre a basic and constitutive rift between form and content, between the words and their ob- jects-a rift which both prose narrative and lyric seek to abolish in their various fashions, but upon maintaining which the vitality of artificial epic depends. The heroic simile is one of the principal agencies of this separa- tion and operates as a sign that some degraded and contingent empirical reality (the dreary anxiety of warfare, the privations of long journeys, persistent hard luck and the cheapness of hu- man life) has been transmuted into monumental flourish or ara- besque, that from the chaos of ordinary experience the eternal geometry of epic decoration has been disengaged: Poi si rivolse, e parve di coloro che corrono a Verona il drappo verde per la campagna; e parve di costoro quelli che vince, non colui che perde. From a purely visual point of view, we see neither Messire Bruno as he hurries to rejoin his companions, nor the race at Verona; rather, the first action is narrated for us by Dante, and the second 322</page><page sequence="29">FREDRIC JAMESON we remember. The contemporary allusion jogs a storehouse within the mind of what ought not too rapidly to be thought of as Pla- tonic ideas or Jungian archetypes: some fund of memory-traces in which there persevere images of quintessential forms and move- ments, idealized gestures, that "formidable erosion of contours" of which Gide, after Nietzsche, liked to speak, a kind of stark simpli- fication of the empirical. From such a source there rises, not the stricken face and trembling ribcage of some flesh and blood Olympic runner in a newsreel, but rather the eternal runner himself, shoulders flung back, billowed about by draperies, slowly letting off as the ribbon flutters slackly to the ground about his feet. It is in this sense that Mnemosyne presides over the epic, for the latter does not, like the novel, give us to see as though for the first time, but rather restimulates this older preexisting gestural repertoire. In this way it can be said that the poet of artificial epic does not immediately compose with words but rather works, as with his most fundamental raw materials and building blocks, with just such perceptual and gestural archetypes, juxtaposing them, unifying them into the sensuous continuity of his narrative. The narrative, indeed, may be thought of as a pretext for the align- ment and quasi-spatial exploitation of such physical perceptions as bodies in flight or ships at sea: Satan with less toil, and now with ease, Wafts on the calmer wave with dubious light, And, like a weather-beaten vessel, holds Gladly the port, though shrouds and tackle torn; Or in the emptier waste, resembling air, Weighs his spread wings... waves in a storm: Hi summo in fluctu pendent, his unda dehiscens terram inter fluctus aperit; furit aestus haerenis. the slow rotation of the heavenly bodies, but also the gesture of the sower: et Ruth se demandait, Immobile, ouvrant l'oeil a moitie sous ses voiles, Quel dieu, quel moissonneur de l'eternel ete, 323</page><page sequence="30">THE HUDSON REVIEW Avait, en s'en allant, negligemment jete Cette faucille d'or dans le champ des etoiles. The external form of the language (whether strophic composition, terza rima, or the hexameter itself) then seals and imitates this inner composition by gestural or perceptual unities: its metrical units serving as it were as the outer emblems or symbols of the substitution, for the flux of daily experience, of these new es- sences; as the imitation in the language itself of this unification and solidification of the disparate and the contingent. It is no accident that alongside what we have called the satire- collage in Lewis, we find examples, as also in the Flaubert of the epic prose works, of Salammbo and Herodias, of just such pas- sages of epic decoration in the sense outlined above: Two birds, one immediately above the other, appear to be ap- proaching the heavenly city. As however their bodies get suffi- ciently near, they are seen to be not two birds but one. What seemed like two is a large bird of unusual size holding something in its beak. Crossing the highroad at the further extremity of the camp, it describes a wide arc that takes it southward and to the rear of the Bailiff's court. Thence, flying with unhesitating precision, it sweeps towards the watching crowd. Skimming the summit of the official box, neck outstretched, its face seems, as it rushes overhead, like that of an ecstatic runner. It flies directly to a basalt slab situated between the Bailiff's enclosure and the ferry station. As it touches the heavenly soil a roar of faint trumpets comes from the city. At the same time a mirage rises from the further edge of the water, having the consistency and tint of the wall of a cheese, but cut into terraces full of drowsy movement which are reflected in the stream. If, indeed, the aesthetic both of Flaubert and of Lewis allow for such shifting of gears between the satiric and the epic mode, this can only portend some fundamental similarity between the two structures, some essential analogy between their respective raw materials. The truth is that what we have called gestural arche- types are in reality nothing but cliches also: only they are, as it were, cliches before the fall, the received ideas of an older and socially more vital culture, of the pre-industrial city state with its festivals and armies, its personalized quasi-feudal power rela- tionships, its sophisticated spectacles and its proximity to the life of the fields which surround it (and in this sense the life of the 324</page><page sequence="31">FREDRIC JAMESON Bailiff's camp is a pre-industrial one also). In such a society, which has overcome what Marx and Engels call the "rural idiocy" of more primitive agrarian cultures, but which has not yet been systematized out of all proportion to the dimensions of human life by the development of capitalism, cliche and re- ceived idea are nothing more than the form taken by collective intelligence itself: they are the shared experience, gathered into images, of social life and of the Gemeinschaft. So it is that the basic difference between artificial epic and what we have here called satire-collage, between the high style of Salammbo or of the above passage and the low style of Tarr or Bouvard et Pecuchet, is not in reality a structural difference be- tween two types of language and two literary genres, but rather a socio-economic difference between two cultures or two moments of history. The satire-collage is the form taken by artificial epic in the degraded world of commodity production and of the mass media: it is artificial epic whose raw materials have become spur- ious and inauthentic, monumental gesture replaced by the cul- tural junk of industrial capitalism. So it is that the most authentic realization of the epic voice in modern times-an ideal of many centuries of Western culture-yields not some decorative and beautified pastiche, but rather the most jarring and energetic mi- mesis of the mechanical, and breathes a passionate revulsion for the standardized manipulations of contemporary existence. 4 There remains the problem of the ultimate motivation of such a stylistic practice, of the intent and the passion which energizes so many false sentences, tirelessly producing amalgams of words whose function is no longer to re-produce the real, but rather, as it were, to testify to our powerlessness to do so and to the inescap- able contamination of the collective mind and of language itself. To articulate such a motivation and such an intent would be to reveal the whole epistemological dimension of Lewis' work. All great art, however, at least in modern times, can be said to spring from a privation rather than a plenitude of being: its re- doubled energies do not represent the tapping of sources of power unavailable to the writers of an earlier tradition, but rather re- flect the massive and wellnigh impenetrable obstacles which 325</page><page sequence="32">THE HUDSON REVIEW literary production must overcome in the consumer age; and these obstacles may be articulated in any number of different ways: in the domain of literary history, as the exhaustion of inherited form; on the social plane, as the increasing unjustifiability of the artist himself, his loss of social status and function; on the sociological level, as the split between public institutions and private experience, and as the decay of the older forms of social life; psychologically, as the monadization and subjectification of individual existence, its degradation to statistical anonymity, or to the status of mere case history. In such a situation, the prodigious energy with which Wyndham Lewis propagates his bristling mechanical sentences and trans- forms the reified world into a forbiddingly cubist surface may be thought of as a kind of coopting of the machine, a kind of expropriation of its alienated dynamism. For Lewis, indeed, the machine seems to have absorbed all the vitality of the human beings who are now dependent on it: After a brief disturbance within, there came a mighty purr from its recesses, then an outsize and very handsome dove-grey road- ster emerged. Its blunt imposing head appeared unexpectedly quickly for such an important accouchement, riding with drowsy power over the obstructions of the uneven soil. Victor was at the wheel. This monster, as it moved across the yard was gathering speed; it melted ponderously through the ungated entrance at the side of the hotel, bellowing like a pole-axed bullock. A hand waved to it, unnoticed, from an upper window, the words 'Good Luckl' accompanied the flutter of the flesh, with salutation and godspeed. Next moment it had sunk away, with velvet self-ef- facement, rolling upon a carpet of rich dust, which changed into a low-lying fog upon the road, sucked in at the gateway for some time after the great car had departed. Such an apparition, at the very climax of the Revenge for Love, stands as the very archetype of what Sartre has called the prac- tico-inert, that anti-freedom, that malignant destiny, which men create for themselves by the very investment of their own labor in its products, labor power which then returns against them in the hostile and unrecognizable form of a mechanical and inhuman destiny. At the same time, the motor-car is the very locus of metonymic fission, which as it is transmitted to ever more distant circles of objects ends by drawing life itself (the organic death of 326</page><page sequence="33">FREDRIC JAMESON the bullock, the "flutter of flesh" waving goodbye) into its me- chanical primacy. It is thus not so much a substance, not so much a thing, as ra- ther a center, a field of force: so it seems to bear Victor and Margot forward of its own will upon their fatal journey: for Mar- got it stands for an uncontrollable destiny which nonetheless requires our own collusion and complicity as well: "To devour miles and eat up minutes, in gulp after gulp, use must be made of her organs, so it seemed, as well as its own. Under her feet she had a time-eating and space-guzzling automaton, rather than a hackneyed means of transport, however horridly high-powered. It was her time, too, it was gobbling up-under great pressure, in big passionate draughts." So paradoxically monadic isolation is overcome, but as though by a grisly misunderstanding, through some blind alienation from without, which cannot be understood but merely felt, like the wrenching away, in wind and flood, of some windowless dwelling. Yet this painful dislocation of consciousness, battered from without by the meteoric storm of history, now at last provides material for narration and can be expressed: it is, no doubt, still a highly subjectivized expression, for the monad still only sees the shadows on its own wall, and what is so vivid for it is still only its private experience of some ultimate Ding-an-sich which it will never be in any position to see directly. Yet reality is present, if only as the absent cause of what are very real subjective effects: Meanwhile trees, rocks, and telegraph-poles stood up dizzily be- fore her and crashed down behind. They were held up stiffly in front of her astonished eyes, then snatched savagely out of the picture. Like a card-world, clacked cinematographically through its static permutations by the ill-bred fingers of a powerful con- jurer, everything stood on end and then fell flat. He showed you a tree-a cardboard tree. Fix your eye upon thisl he said. Then with a crash it vanished. Similarly with a segment of cliff. Sim- ilarly with a telegraph-pole. Her head ached with the crash of images. Every time a telegraph-pole fell down she felt the shock of its collapse in the picture-house of the senses. The instinctive greatness of Lewis was, I think, to have under- stood that even where the real is ultimately inaccessible we are not for all that necessarily reduced to silence. The impression- istic way is to keep faith with the illusions of subjectivity, lovingly 327</page><page sequence="34">THE HUDSON REVIEW to reproduce them in the detail of their appearance: Lewis' expres- sionism, on the other hand, marks those illusions with the stamp of the illusory, keeping the place of the real warm by deforming its caricatural substitutes in the realm of phenomena. So it is that Margot comes face to face with the most indi- gestible fact of external reality itself, that which cannot be in- teriorized for it spells the very obliteration of the monad itself, namely death, in the person of the guardia civil looming a moment in the roadster's path. The dead guard, who unites for the lovers the guilt of killing with the certainty of their own death sentence, represents some ultimate reality too scandalous to pen- etrate the mind, a reality that blows upon us in fitful, inter- mittent snatches, like a word on the tip of our tongue or an un- derstanding we cannot quite recapture. So for Margot this ulti- mate glimpse of what defeats man, of that by which love itself is annihilated: Far worse than that, she discovered herself at last watching against her will the floodlit stretch of rust-red road. Plumes of dust were spurting up; but their car (it had left her behind) was rapidly disappearing and had already grown quite small, in diminishing perspective; while in the foreground she was staring down at a disagreeable flattened object. Sprawling in the centre of the road, it was incredibly two-dimensional and, in short, unreal. It might have just been painted upon the earth. But it looked more like a big untidy pattern, cut out of black paper, except for what was the face. That was flat, as well-as flat as a pancake, but as pale as a sheet, with a blue smear where the chin was. It was the chin of Prussian-blue. The flat black headgear of a Civil Guard, likewise no thicker than cardboard, lay a foot away from the head. So the trick is turned, and the impossible picture seen in all its impossibility! This astonishing passage is of course Margot's attempt to visualize the guard's corpse; and there can be no doubt that in some regressive and prelogical corner of our minds, it is our most spontaneous first thought, that a man run over by a car is as flat as a pancake (as well as pale as a sheet). Unlike Mar- got, however, on her childish and naive level, unlike Lewis, on his sophisticated one, we ourselves repress the first thought, and the reality principle demands of us some more adult and scientific adequation. Yet we emerge from that earlier, naive vision empty- 328</page><page sequence="35">FREDRIC JAMESON handed, into a linguistic or perceptual void in which we no longer quite know what to say about the body: bloodied, bruised, broken in strange places like a doll-all of these are a whistling in the dark, they fail to convey any real vision, instead they are themselves attempts to stimulate artificially such a vision, which is not forthcoming. Yet Lewis' is not a child-art; unlike, say, a Faulkner, he does not attempt to do justice to the existential limits of the child's prera- tional consciousness. On the contrary, his is a critique of Mar- got's immaturity and of the cultural forces which have left her thus defenseless; and the child-vision is here, as it were in Hege- lian fashion, cancelled and assimilated to a higher form in which it is preserved even while being denied on its own terms. It is as though language overcame some initial muteness before the in- commensurability of experience (Mallarm6's sterility, the silences of modern literature and modern music, of modern philosophy) by finally concluding, in a "bustling" and energetic gesture, that since it cannot tell us what to see, it will tell us what we would have seen had we been able to do so. Since there exists no adequate language for "rendering" the object, all that is left to the writer is to tell us how he would have rendered it had he had the means to do so. There thus comes into being a language beyond lan- guage, shot through with the jerry-built quality of modern industrial civilization, brittle and impermanent, yet full of a me- chanic's enthusiasm. Lewis' style is thus an exemplary and vio- lent figure for the birth of all living speech: for there is a sense in which all speaking is a second-best, a substitute for the pleni- tude of some primary language. Yet the very notion of such a plenitude is a mirage; and all speech must settle its accounts with the optical illusion of a natural language if it is to be delivered from a terrorized reduction to silence. So Lewis' style, the only true English futurism, an immense hangar in which we may still learn to tap the almost extinct sources of verbal production, does not in the clattering, deafening noise of its own mechanical emergence seek to be preserved as an object for contemplation but rather consents to abolish itself in time, freeing us in turn from the fetishistic spell of style itself. 329</page></plain_text>
