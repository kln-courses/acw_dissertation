Martinus Nijhoff Publishers, Dordrecht - Printed in the Netherlands SCIENTIFIC PSYCHOLOGY AND HERMENEUTICAL PSYCHOLOGY: CAUSAL EXPLANATION AND THE MEANING OF HUMAN ACTION JOHN D. GREENWOOD Department of Philosophy, University of North Carolina at Greensboro, Greensboro, NC 27412 About 20 years ago it was fashionable to recognise that explanations of hu? man action in terms of agent's reasons, purposes, values etc. were of a dif? ferent logical order from causal explanations. Nowadays the fashion seems to be to recognise that they are bona fide examples of causal explanation. The debate about 'reasons and causes' has been around for centuries, at least since Kant and probably since Aristotle, although it has perhaps generated more confusion than illumination. It has alternatively been dis? missed as a purely verbal dispute, or treated as the most fundamental ques? tion of the philosophy of the human sciences. The present contribution to this debate is offered because most of the discussions of this question (at least since Kant) are vitiated by the presup? position of an inadequate philosophy of science. It is also offered because the question is not of mere philosophical interest: it has rather profound implications for the practise of social psychological sciences. Indeed the confusions of this debate have had a very definite and detrimental impact upon the practise of scientific social psychology. The issue is of course too large to encompass in the scope of a single ar? ticle. In the present article I hope to show that none of the arguments which purport to demonstrate that explanations of human action are non-causal in fact establish this, although they do illustrate important truths about the subject matter of psychological and social sciences. In a future article (Greenwood, 1986) I hope to explicate the sense(s) in which explanations of human action are causal. In these articles the primary concern is with a putative science of social psychology, insofar as this may be held to be closely co-ordinated with a science of human action: the implications apply</page><page sequence="2">172 to any discipline concerned with the explanation of human action. Those who argue that explanations of human action are causal in nature are clas? sified as scientific psychologists; those who argue that such explanations are explications of meaning are classified as hermeneutical psychologists. 1. Scientific psychology and hermeneutical psychology Psychologists are fond of saying that psychology became a truly scientific discipline when it developed as a discipline independent of philosophy, and modelled itself upon the natural sciences. In fact of course psychology did nothing of the kind, and from the earliest days modelled itself upon an es? sentially empiricist philosophy of science. In 1866 John Stuart Mill com? plained that the 'moral sciences' were a 'blot on the face of science'; Mill argued that the situation could only be remedied by applying the empiricist methods of his 'System of Logic' (1843) to the study of human behaviour. The b?te noire in the history of psychology is the British empiricist phi? losopher David Hume (1739; 1748); much of the confusion and misunder? standing about the causal explanation of human action can be related to Hume's account of causality. Hume analysed causality as nothing more or less than the observed 'constant conjunction' of events in experience1; there were no mysterious or occult 'forces' or 'necessary connections' over and above observed 'constant conjunctions'. Because Hume felt there was no philosophical justification for our admitted belief in such 'necessary connections' or 'causal powers', he provided an essentially psychological account of our belief in causal connections. The 'necessary connection' of causality is essentially a 'connection ... which we feel in the mind'. Events observed to be conjoined in past experience are mentally associated via 'habit' and 'custom'; the observation of past instances leads us to antici? pate future instances of conjunction. Hume also argued that our degree of belief in a causal connection was a direct function of the number of ob? served instances of event conjunction. Thus, to use Hume's own example, to say that the motion of one billiard ball colliding with another causes the motion of the other is essentially to say that the first type of motion is con? stantly conjoined in experience with the second: there is no additional 'power' or 'force' to be observed in any of the instances of conjunction. Our past experience of the one type of motion followed by the other leads us to anticipate future conjunctions of the two motions. The more instan</page><page sequence="3">173 ces of the conjunction we observe, the stronger is our belief that the former motion causes the second. When Wundt made the symbolic move to the laboratory in 1879, he car? ried with him the intellectual baggage of 19th-century philosophical empi? ricism. The attempt by introspective psychologists to identify and correlate mental 'elements' was a direct descendent of the 'laws' of association of 'impressions' and 'ideas' postulated by Locke, Berkeley and Hume. When Watson rejected this self-defeating mode of enquiry he simply replaced 'private' mental data with 'public' observable stimuli and responses, but re? tained the empiricist analysis of causal explanations as contingent descrip? tions of observational correlations: In effect they have given to us as the primary analytical concepts for the most ambitious science ever conceived a mildly camouflaged para? digm for Hume's analysis of causality. (Koch, 1964) Despite Watson's frequent avowals to the contrary, behaviourism and sci? entific psychology were founded upon an explicitly philosophical and em? piricist philosophy of science: In pursuit of these ends, psychology did not go directly to physics but turned instead for its directives to middlemen. These were, for the most part, philosophers of science (mainly logical positivists) and a number of physical science methodologists who had been codifying a synoptic view of the nature of science and who, by the early thirties, were active? ly exporting that view from their specialities to the scholarly communi? ty at large. (Koch, 1964) Notwithstanding the rise and fall (and resurrection) of behaviourism, many contemporary psychologists present these empiricist principles of scientific psychological practice as if they were principles of any science. Basic to this conception of a scientific psychology is the regularity ac? count of causality, which is essentially a modern formalisation of Hume's account. Causal propositions or laws are held to describe empirical invari? ance or regular correlation: to say that event A is the cause of event B is to say that A and B are observable and constantly conjoined or regularly correlated (Braithwaite, 1953; Mackie, 1974). Thus for example to say that watching violence on television causes aggressive behaviour in children is to say that these events are regularly correlated. Practising psychologists</page><page sequence="4">174 (like Hume) do of course recognise the problem of 'accidental correla? tions'; regular correlation is treated as a necessary but not a sufficient requirement for a causal relationship. Closely associated with this view is the instance statistics account of con firmation. Again this is a formalisation of Hume's psychological account of our belief in causal connections. This account states that causal proposi? tions describing the regular correlation of observables A and B are con? firmed by observed instances of A followed by B (and falsified by observed instances of A which are not followed by B), and that the degree of confir? mation or probability of a putative causal law is proportional to the num? ber of such observed 'positive instances' (Carnap, 1966; Nagel, 1974). Thus for example a postulated causal relation between television violence and ag? gression in children is held to be more probable according to the observed degree of correlation between the two phenomena. A natural development of these accounts of causality and confirmation is the deductive-nomological account of scientific explanation. On this view, singular events are explained by the deduction of a description of the event from one or more 'covering laws' and a description of the initial con? ditions (Hempel and Oppenheim, 1948; Popper, 1957). Thus the aggressive behaviour of the child is explained by reference to the fact that the child was a regular viewer of violent television, and the covering law relating vio? lent television and aggression. Because causal explanation and scientific prediction are held to be symmetrical with respect to their logical form, pre? dictive success is taken as the acid criterion for the adequacy of a causal explanation. Thus an adequate causal explanation of aggression must en? able us to predict instances of aggression. The final thesis of this inter-related quartet is the instrumentalist concep? tion of theory. On this view the function of theory is to 'integrate and syn thesise' descriptions of observable correlations (causal laws) and predict new correlations. The meaning of 'theoretical principles' or 'theoretical constructs' is specified via 'correspondence rules' or 'operational defini? tions' relating theory and observation terms. Thus observational laws are themselves explained and predicted by deduction from theoretical prin? ciples and correspondence rules (Hempel, 1965). The important implica? tion of this conception of theory for psychology is that cognitive-affective 'constructs' or 'intervening variables' are held to be justified only insofar and inasmuch as they function as sentential instruments which facilitate (via operational definitions) the explanation, prediction, and control of human behaviour:</page><page sequence="5">175 The relationship between the observables mediated by the mental pro? cess must be operationally defined, this relationship must be tested with controlled experiments, and the mental concept thus defined must increase our ability to predict and control behaviour, or else its use is not justified. (Ledwidge, 1978) This last feature is worth stressing, for despite the so-called 'cognitive revo? lution' in cognitive, social and clinical psychology, cognitive-affective theo? retical concepts continue to be construed in a purely instrumental fashion. Of course few now follow Watson in rejecting such constructs as non? existent and non-scientific: rather such theoretical constructs are held to re? fer to (as yet unspecified) neurophysiological states whose existence and operation can be confirmed by predictions of behavioural variance derived from the theory (Fodor, 1975). Thus despite some optimistic calls for a re? appraisal of the role of introspection in psychology (Radford, 1974; Rakover, 1983), and recommendations that psychologists attend to agents' own explanatory accounts of their behaviour (Allport, 1937; Harr? and Secord, 1972), many practising psychologists remain wholly unconvinced and sceptical. Indeed in the last decade there has been a strong reaction to such suggestions, particularly by critics who cite empirical studies which appear to show that the 'lay scientist' is regularly mistaken in the identifi? cation of his cognitive-affective states and estimation of their causal role in action (Evans and Wason, 1976; Nisbett and Wilson, 1977; Nisbett and Ross, 1980). These four fundamental empiricist doctrines support the contemporary conception of the goal of psychology as the explanation, prediction and control of human behaviour, via the identification of its causal determi? nants. The laboratory experiment in psychology is thus often represented as the sine qua non of causal science. It is also precisely this conception of a scientific psychology which supports the 'social engineering' conception of psychological therapy (Brehm, 1976). Such a characterisation of psychology as a causal science has been the object of sustained criticism for a number of decades, and general objec? tions to the assimilation of the natural and human sciences have been pro? pounded for centuries. The essential claim of hermeneutical critics (Taylor, 1971; Gault and Shotter, 1977) is that the explanation of human action is essentially hermeneutic in nature: the explanation of human action is es? sentially the explication of the meaning of human action in terms of the agent's reasons, purposes, goals etc.</page><page sequence="6">176 This critical perspective has a long history, deriving from the 18th-cen? tury humanism of Vico and Herder, and developed in the sociological and historical tradition by theorists such as Simmel (1908), Dilthey (1937) and Collingwood (1946). In an important sense it represents a post-Kantian ar? ticulation of the distinction between the natural world of science (governed by causal laws) and the 'intelligible' world of human freedom and morality (governed by human reason and purpose). The development of this hermeneutical tradition in the philosophy of psychology derives from post-Wittgensteinian analyses of agency and reason explanations. Central to this position is the claim that explanations in the natural and human sciences are radically different. In the human sci? ences the causal explanation of action is held to be inappropriate, with the possible exception of exceptional cases (e.g. nervous spasms, automatic re? flexes, etc.): ... if we are in fact confronted with a case of genuine action ... then causal explanations are ipso facto inappropriate ... (Peters, 1958) The explanation of human action is held to be non-causal because it is es entially the interpretation of the meaning of human action in terms of shared human reasons, values, purposes etc. As this type of explanation may be characterised as the critical explication of the meaning of shared concepts, it is often held to be closely akin to the philosophical enterprise, at least in the analytic tradition (cf. Winch, 1958). This claim is supported by a whole battery of arguments which attempt to demonstrate that reason and purpose explanations and causal explana? tions are of a different logical order, based upon putative contrasts between causal explanations in natural science and explanations in terms of reasons and purposes. Such arguments have been presented in the sociological sphere by critics such as Winch (1958), Von Wright (1971) and Louch (1967), and in the psychological sphere by philosophers and psychologists such as Peters (1958), Melden (1961), Maclntyre (1958), Taylor (1964), Shotter (1975) and Bruner (1976). This fundamental distinction between explanations in the natural and human sciences is held to have quite radical consequences: But we cannot hide from ourselves how greatly this option breaks with commonly held notions about our scientific traditions. We cannot</page><page sequence="7">177 measure such sciences (moral and hermeneutical ones) against the re? quirements of a science of verification: we cannot judge them by their predictive capacity. (Taylor, 1971) One important consequence is the view that experimental techniques in psychology, which aim to investigate causal relationships between vari? ables, are not merely presently inadequate but wholly inappropriate. In their place the hermeneutical psychologist recommends a renewed empha? sis on interpretative field work, based on agents' own explanatory com? mentaries on their actions. It is hardly surprising that these hermeneutical criticisms have made little real impact upon psychological practice. For practising psychologists, who are committed to a causal enquiry, see these claims as tantamount to the rejection of a psychological science (Wetherick, 1973). Alternatively they reject hermeneutical investigation by accepting it as a legitimate form of psychology, but one which has no place in a scientific psychology: So I am suggesting that there are two types of psychology. One is with? in the broad scientific tradition which studies behaviour and when and where it occurs, and which is not clearly demarcated from physiology. The other is within the tradition of the humanities and studies private states, mental phenomena, verbal reports, agency, meanings, feelings, intentions and the like. I want to advance the thesis that there are, from a logical point of view, two types of psychology. One lies within the broad tradition of science, the other does not but can be a valid and useful exercise if there is a proper awareness of its nature .... (Richer, 1975) But both these positions are vitiated (along with much contemporary debate about the nature of psychology and other social sciences) because they are both based upon a fundamentally inadequate empiricist phi? losophy of science. The standard scientific psychological account is a direct mapping of empiricist accounts of science onto the psychological domain. The arguments of the critical hermeneutical psychologist are based not on real contrasts with causal explanation in natural science, but on putative contrasts between the explanation of human action and empiricist ac? counts of causal explanation in science. In the following section some of these inadequacies are discussed, and an alternative realist perspective de? scribed.2 This will provide a sounder basis for an evaluation of the argu? ments of the hermeneutical psychologist.</page><page sequence="8">178 2. Realism The most basic problem with the empiricist account is that it treats the nat? ural world as comprised of invariant sequences of events; causal explana? tions are held to describe the constant or regular conjunction of indepen? dent and observable events. But the real world of natural science consists of enduring physical structures with causal powers in interaction (Bhaskar, 1975; Harr? and Madden, 1975): causal explanations make reference to the causal powers and natures of physical structures. On this latter realist con? ception, which is common to most practising natural scientists, causality cannot be equated with constant or regular correlation. Because of mecha? nisms of prevention and interference (other physical structures with causal powers), there are precious few invariant sequences outside of artificially closed laboratory systems or specially constructed technological systems. Female Anopheles mosquito bites and increased current have the (causal) power to generate malaria in men and increased voltage in an electric cir? cuit; but prophylactics can prevent malaria and increased temperature pre? vents increased current. Mercifully (at present) Plutonium 238 rarely mani? fests its power to cause tissue damage in humans because of lead screening; bodies only fall with constant vertical acceleration in artificially construct? ed vacuum experiments. One could search for generations without finding any naturally occurring examples of the Compton or Zeeman effect, or electrical systems which obeyed Ohm's law. That is, constant or regular cor? relation of events is not even necessary for the existence of a causal power (Geach, 1975). Nor is observed constant or regular correlation necessary for the objec? tive attribution of causal powers to natural agents. The instance-statistics model of confirmation is inadequate because it fails to square with the fact that causal powers in natural science are regularly identified on the basis of relatively few closed experiments (Toulmin, 1953), in which alternative hypothetical mechanisms of generation and interference are eliminated (Bhaskar, 1975). Of course such experiments must be repeated, but the logic of this practice is not simply the accumulation of further 'positive in? stances'. Repetition of the experiment is a test of the experiment itself; if the experiment is not successfully repeated the experiment is rejected as a failure to achieve experimental closure (Musgrave, 1973). If under such conditions (Jf closure an isolated structure S manifests an effect e, then the scientist has established that S has the power to generate e: for example if</page><page sequence="9">179 tin at a very low temperature and in the absence of a local magnetic field exhibits superconductivity when a potential difference is applied, then it has been established that tin has the power to act as a superconductor. Causal explanations in natural science proceed by reference to the intrinsic structure and composition (nature) of physical entities, the extrinsic en? abling and stimulus conditions for the manifestation of causal powers, and the absence of mechanisms of prevention and interference. Thus for exam? ple the superconductivity of tin is explained by reference to long-range elec? tron coupling (nature), given a very low temperature and application of a potential difference (extrinsic enabling and stimulus conditions), and the absence of a local magnetic field (interference condition). Thus in general the only 'constant' correlations relevant to the evaluation of causal explanations are those artificially created by the scientist in the closed experiment. In open systems (not isolated from alternative mecha? nisms of generation and interference) outside of the scientific laboratory there is only a tenuous link between causality and correlation. The frequen? cy with which a physical structure will manifest its power in open systems depends upon the purely contingent circumstance of how often mechan? isms of interference are co-present. This may vary from never to always: for example plutonium 238 rarely manifests its power to generate tissue dam? age in humans (because of lead screening), but regrettably (at present) the rabies virus regularly generates nervous system destruction and death. Thus the observed degree of correlation in open systems cannot be taken as the measure of the probability of a causal relationship. One consequence of these features is that the adequacy criteria for a causal explanation are not identical to the criteria for a successful predic? tion. Causal explanatory powers of physical structures can be identified in closed experiments long before the scientist is in a position to identify and anticipate mechanisms of generation and interference in open systems: for example he can identify the micro-organism cause of a disease long before he can anticipate contact and resistance. Indeed a purely descriptive and non-explanatory characterisation of de facto correlations in open systems may often be a better predictor of events than an explanatory characterisa? tion of causal powers: for example a disease syndrome may be a better pre? dictor of instances of the disease than a micro-organism causal account. Nevertheless instances of the disease in open systems are explained by refer? ence to antecedent contact with the generative micro-organism. While this means that standard empiricist characterisations of psychol</page><page sequence="10">180 ogy as a scientific discipline are misguided and inaccurate, it also means that fairly standard hermeneutical and critical objections to a putative causal science of action are misdirected. It is regularly objected for example that there simply are no de facto constant or regular correlations in the hu? man sciences, and that psychological explanations are poor predictors of human behaviour: If you consider the truly prodigious expenditure of man hours that psychology has involved over the last 50 years, the output in terms of socially useful insights or techniques is disappointing. We have set our? selves to bring human behaviour under predictive control and our suc? cess - in our own terms - has been less than marked. (Hudson, 1970) But both these objections simply amount to the claim that psychology does not measure up to familiar scientific empiricist requirements. These objec? tions are misdirected because degree of correlation is not a measure of cau? sality, nor predictive success simpliciter a criterion for the adequacy of a causal explanation. There is no reason in principle why psychology should not fit the realist schema of closed experimentation and causal explanatory inference (to open systems) sketched above. If, for example, instances of 'violent stimuli' and 'powerful and credible sources' can be isolated from their normal and potential concomitances in closed experiments (and this is a big if) and re? peatedly correlated with 'aggressive behaviour' and 'persuasive communic? ations', then the causal power of 'violent stimuli' to generate 'aggressive be? haviour' (Berkowitz and LePage, 1967) and the causal power of 'powerful and credible sources' to facilitate 'persuasive communications' can be es? tablished (Secord and Backman, 1974). Given these established powers, in? stances of 'aggressive behaviour' and 'persuasive communications' in 'real world' open systems can be causally explained by reference to antecedent instances of 'violent stimuli' and 'powerful and credible sources'. This does not of course mean that these phenomena are constantly or regularly corre? lated in 'real world' open systems: for aggressive behaviour can be prevent? ed by social inhibition, and persuasive communications diffused and resist? ed via contrary norms derived from local reference groups. Nor of course does it mean that instances of these phenomena in 'real world' open systems can be predicted with a high degree of success, because instances and combinations of mechanisms of generation and interference</page><page sequence="11">181 may be difficult to anticipate. Prediction in open systems is an unrealist goal for any science. It is as inappropriate to blame the psychologist for his failure to predict instances of psychological disorder and violence as it is to blame the geologist or the physician for their failure to predict instances of earthquake and disease (or indeed the physicist for his failure to predict the trajectory of the proverbial leaf falling from the tree on a windy day). In none of these cases does predictive failure in open systems cast doubt upon the causal explanations provided by the scientist; certainly it casts no doubt at all on the causal status of such explanations. This does not mean that a realist science of psychology can simply be achieved by the direct mapping of realist principles onto the psychological domain. For there are significant differences between the phenomena of psychological and natural science which are revealed by the realist perspec? tive. Some of these are discussed in the following sections of this article; others will be discussed in another article (Greenwood, 1986). It is in virtue of these differences that it is worth discussing some of the more sophisticated arguments of the hermeneutical critic in a little more detail. None of these arguments establish that explanations of human ac? tion are non-causal, but they do indirectly illustrate important truths about social and psychological phenomena. For the most damaging consequence of these often confused debates about the explanation of human action is that the practising psychologist, in rejecting the arguments of the herme? neutical psychologist, tends to neglect or ignore these important truths. 3. Causality and contingency A much more subtle complaint by the hermeneutical critic (and one that is ultimately more illuminative of the real problems of a scientific psychol? ogy) is to the effect that explanations of human action in terms of rules, reasons, purposes, values etc. cannot be causal because they are not contin? gent. It is claimed that there are conceptual or logical connections between the explanans and the explanandum in such explanations of human action: for this reason such arguments are often characterised as the 'conceptual connection' or 'logical connection' argument (Stoutland, 1970). Unfortu? nately once again this argument is not based upon a real contrast between explanations of human action and causal explanations in natural science. It simply points out that such explanations do not seem to satisfy certain</page><page sequence="12">182 requirements of the Humean account of causality and the 'deductive nomological' account of causal explanation. To fully appreciate this argument of the hermeneutical psychologist it is perhaps useful to characterise his positive account of the explanation of human action in a little more detail. The hermeneutical psychologist lays great emphasis on what is often called the 'semantic dimension' of human action, and its symbolic and expressive aspects. The aim of the hermeneuti? cal psychologist is to investigate and determine the meaning that a particu? lar action has for an agent in terms of his reasons and purposes, and intelli? gibly relate this to the meaningful rules governing a particular form of social life. This is clearly articulated, for example, in Maclntyre's character? isation of Winch's fairly representative position: ... one can set out Winch's view of understanding and explanations in the social sciences in terms of a two-stage model. An action is first made intelligible as the outcome of motives, reasons and decisions; and is then made further intelligible by these motives, reasons and de? cisions being set in the context of the rules of a given form of social life. (Maclntyre, 1971) Now these two forms of understanding, the understanding of the meaning of human action, and the understanding of its relation to social rules and practices, are not discrete. The general form of social life shared by human agents is not a molecular product of independent and atomic action types. Rather it is the case that human action is meaningful in virtue of its relation to other human actions and social practices: for example the act of wage payment is meaningful in virtue of its relation to employment and financial practices in a given form of social life. The dominant analogy here is with the understanding of language, and many contemporary hermeneutical critics lean heavily upon the later Witt? genstein's (1953) account (anticipated by von Humbolt (1836) and Saussure (1916)) of linguistic meaning in terms of rule-governed social action. The meaning of a linguistic item is to be found in its relation to the 'language game' in which it occurs, and the 'form of life' in which such 'language games' occur. Many hermeneutical accounts are in effect the application of this relational account of linguistic meaning to the analysis of the mean? ing of human action: the meaning of human action is to be found in its rela? tion to other meaningful social practices in a given form of life. This is the point of the regular emphasis on the 'rule-governed' or 'rule-following' na? ture of human action (Peters, 1958; Winch, 1958).</page><page sequence="13">183 It is then argued that explanations of action cannot be causal because of the meaning relations between descriptions of social psychological phe? nomena. As there are meaning (or conceptual) connections between social psychological descriptions, explanations of human action cannot be causal because they are not contingent. Such explanations violate this critical re? quirement of Humean and scientific empiricist accounts of causality and causal explanation. Thus for example it is argued that there is a close con? ceptual connection between 'commands' and 'acts of obedience': An event's character as an act of obedience is intrinsic to it in a way which is not true of an event's character as a clap of thunder, and this is in general true of human acts as opposed to natural events-An act of obedience itself contains, as an essential element, a recognition of what went before as an order. But it would of course be senseless to suppose that a clap of thunder contained any recognition of what went before as an electrical storm_(Winch, 1958) Or it is argued that the concept of intending to do X implies that agents generally fulfill that intention: This is part of what we mean by 'intending X', that, in the absence of interfering factors, it is followed by doing X. I could not be said to in? tend X if, even with no obstacles or other countervailing factors, I still didn't do it. Thus my intention is not a causal antecedent of my beha? viour. (Taylor, 1964) It is not claimed that putative explanations relating authoritative com? mands and obedience, or intentions and actions, are analytic truths, or at least not on the level of individual commands or intentions. Both may be interfered with in ordinary ways to prevent obedience or action: I may dis? obey an order from a work superior because it goes against a moral prin? ciple, and my intention to purchase a residential property may be thwarted by a sudden increase in interest rates beyond my financial means. But although such propositions are less than analytic truths, it is argued that such conceptual connections are close enough to establish that explan? ations of human action are non-contingent. It is held to be absurd and un? intelligible to suppose that such phenomena might not have been regularly correlated. The meaning connections between 'criminal action' and 'pun? ishment', 'authoritarian commands' and 'obedience', and 'desire to harm</page><page sequence="14">184 another' and 'aggression', for example, are such that it is absurd or unintel? ligible to suppose things might have been otherwise. For there could not be (logically) criminal acts without legal and penal systems legitimising pun? ishment for rule-violations, commands without effective authoritarian sys? tems, or intentions to harm without recognition of the personal power to cause harm. Part of the meaning of 'criminal acts' is that they are regularly punished; part of the meaning of 'commands' is that they are regularly obeyed; and part of the meaning of 'intention to harm' is that such intentions are suc? cessfully executed. For the hermeneutical psychologist explanations relat? ing these phenomena simply explicate the meaning of concepts such as 'criminal action', 'obedience' or 'aggression'. The task of the hermeneutical psychologist is to provide a more detailed and integrated account of human action by relating such concepts to the wider context of rule-governed and meaningful social practices in a particular form of human life. However all the hermeneutical critic points out is that the meaning of so? cial psychological concepts is essentially relational in nature: the meaning of a social psychological description such as 'command' derives from its relation to associated descriptions such as 'request', 'supplication', 'authority', 'superior', 'obedience', 'refusal', 'co-operation' etc., via inter? related meaning rules that characterise particular forms of social interac? tion. But there is no contrast here with the language of science: the meaning of natural scientific concepts derives from their definitional inter-relations with other concepts in theoretical systems (Scrivens, 1958; Putnam, 1975; Suppe, 1977). Natural phenomena are defined in terms of their causal pow? ers, including their interactions with other particulars (nominal definition), and their composition and structure (real definition) (Harr? and Madden, 1975; Bhaskar, 1975). Thus it is a conceptual truth in natural science that acids are corrosive and proton-donors, and that sulphur burns in oxygen and has atomic number 16. Thus in whatever sense it is true to say that there is a conceptual link be? tween 'criminal acts' and 'punishment' such that it would be absurd or un? intelligible to suppose that there might have been criminal acts without acts of punishment, it is equally true to say that there is a conceptual link be? tween 'protons' and 'electrons' such that it would be absurd or unintelli? gible to suppose that there might have been protons (positively charged particles) without electrons (negatively charged particles). The mere fact that it is part of the meaning of 'authoritarian commands' that they are</page><page sequence="15">185 usually or regularly obeyed does not entail that Milgram's (1974) studies of destructive obedience are non-causal, any more than the fact that it is part of the meaning of 'acids' that they react with alkalis to form salts entails that the manifestation of this power is not a bona fide causal sequence. This does not of course mean that scientific propositions are true by defi? nition in an objectionable fashion. Such developing classifications (nomi? nal definitions) and theoretical definitions (real definitions) are the result of careful observations in natural and experimental closures to determine the real powers and structures of natural phenomena. What is contingent about scientific truths is that there are natural phenomena with such na? tures and powers, not that such phenomena have these constitutive powers and natures. For example, it is a contingent fact that there are acids and the element sulphur; it is not a contingent fact that acids are corrosive and pro? ton donors, or that sulphur burns in oxygen and has atomic number 16. Nor of course is such scientific knowlege gained in an objectionable a priori manner. Although there is a sense in which one can know a priori that acids are corrosive (a student may be taught this as part of the meaning of 'acid') or proton donors (this may be forwarded as a theoretical defini? tion), it is not known a priori that there are any acids which satisfy such definitions. Such conceptual truths are not true by definition in any objec? tionable way because they are r?visable in principle. However they are not r?visable in the sense that it might be discovered that a natural phenomenon does not have such constitutive powers and nature: rather it may be dis? covered that there are no such phenomena with these powers and nature. For example, consider the case of Gallium, an element whose powers and nature were predicted by Mendeleev from the periodic table. It is not logi? cally possible that scientists might have found a sample of Gallium with different powers or nature: for any element that did not have these powers or nature would not count as an instance of Gallium. This is because such powers and nature are definitive and constitutive properties which provide criteria for the identification of Gallium. But of course it is perfectly possi? ble that scientists might have concluded that there were no naturally occur? ring instances of the element Gallium. Analogously, it is not logically pos? sible that scientists might have discovered the tubercule bacillus but deter? mined that it played no causal role in the generation of the disease, al? though it is perfectly possible that they might have concluded that there was no tubercule bacillus (it might have been a viral or hereditary disease). Of course one might equally well only recognise such contingent facts</page><page sequence="16">186 about the non-existence of postulated natural phenomena in retrospect after mistaken experimental work which suggested their existence. For ex? ample it was eventually concluded that there was no phlogiston substance given off in combustion, or N-rays which could be polarised and refracted through a quartz prism, despite originally promising 'confirmations'. That is, scientific propositions are essentially contingent only in the sense that their existential claims are contingent and conceptual definitions r?visable to generate new existential claims. Of course precisely the same is true of social psychological concepts and phenomena. It is not a purely contingent fact that criminal acts are regular? ly followed by punishment, authoritarian commands regularly followed by obedience, or intentions to harm regularly followed by aggressive beha? viour. But it is a purely contingent fact that there are phenomena such as criminal acts and punishment, authoritarian commands and obedience, and intentions to harm and aggression in any particular form of human life; there is no contradiction or absurdity in supposing that these phenom? ena might not have existed. Indeed this is more clearly revealed with respect to the conceptual truths of social psychology. For some social psychologi? cal phenomena in one form of human life (such as voting or witchcraft) are in fact not manifested in other forms of human life, and some presently cherished social psychological phenomena such as marriage or private property might no longer exist in possible future forms of human life (in an extreme form of totalitarian communism, for example). That is, the fact that social psychological (folk and theoretical) and natu? ral scientific concepts form a relational system, comprised of inter-related meaning rules, has no ontological implications for the types of interactions which can take place between entities designated by such concepts: it does not preclude the possibility of causal relationships between such entities. Nor of course does it preclude in any way the investigation of quantitative relationships between entities whose causal relationship is expressed in con? ceptual truths. The conceptual truth relating acids and corrosion says noth? ing about the degree of concentration required for specific degrees of cor? rosion: the conceptual truth relating authoritarian commands and obe? dience says nothing about the relation between physical proximity of authority and degree of obedience.</page><page sequence="17">187 4. Rules and relations However there is an important residue of truth in the arguments of the her? meneutical critic, and it is unfortunate that at precisely this point a rather crucial baby tends to be thrown out with the hermeneutical bath water. None of the arguments noted above rule out the possibility of a causal sci? ence of human action. Nevertheless there is an important sense in which some of these arguments do have a significant ontological implication. This implication is at least implicit in the following argument presented by P. Winch: Mill's view is that understanding a social institution consists in observ? ing regularities in the behaviour of its participants and expressing these regularities in the form of generalizations. Now if the position of the sociological investigator (in a broad sense) can be regarded as comparable, in its main logical outlines, with that of the natural scien? tist, the following must be the case. The concepts and criteria accord? ing to which the sociologist judges that, in two situations, the same thing has happened, or the same action performed, must be under? stood in relation to the rules governing sociological investigation. But here we run against a difficulty: for whereas in the case of the natural scientist we have to deal with only one set of rules, namely those gov? erning the scientist's investigation itself, here what the sociologist is studying, as well as his study of it, is a human activity and is therefore carried on according to rules. And it is these rules, rather than those which govern the sociologist's investigation, which specify what is to count as 'doing the same kind of thing' in relation to that kind of ac? tivity. (Winch, 1958) This passage seems to make a rather crucial point about the classification of social psychological phenomena: the criteria for their identification and re-identification must be those employed by the participants in a given form of social life. Thus an act of killing oneself is a case of suicide if and only if it is recognised as such by participants in a form of social life ac? cording to their own definition. To get clear on the significance of this claim it may be useful to introduce the distinction between constitutive and regulative rules (first introduced by Kant, 1781; and developed by Black, 1962; Schwayder, 1965; and Searle, 1970). The differences between the two types of rules may be described in the fashion below (following Collett, 1977).</page><page sequence="18">188 A constitutive rule defines or constitutes a practice: it provides a defini? tion of what counts as a particular action or social practice. The constitu? tive rule for a 'try' in the game of rugby, for example, specifies that the grounding of the ball in the opponents' in-goal area is what counts as a try in rugby. Such rules confer meaning on actions and situations that satisfy such constitutive definitions, but such meaning is not derived in isolation. The meaning of a particular action such as a try derives from the relevant constitutive rule being related to other constitutive and regulative rules which together constitute the game of rugby. A regulative rule prescribes or prohibits a course of action relating to situations and actions etc. de? fined by constitutive rules. Regulative rules relating to tries in the game of rugby would prescribe strategies for players to achieve tries for their own team and prevent those of their opponents. Reference to a real-life social practice should make the differences clear? er. Consider the constitutive and regulative rules involved in the social prac? tice of trial by jury. The constitutive rules would include something like the following: trial = Df 'the examination of evidence by a body of persons com? prising a judge, jurors, learned counsel, defendant, and officers of the crown and court, and the determination by the jury of the guilt or innocence of the defendant ac? cused of some civil or criminal offence.' juror = Df 'a member of a body of twelve men or women who com? prise a jury in a court of law, who take an oath to render a decision on a judicial question.' judge = Df 'a public officer appointed by the crown to hear and try cases in a court of law.' The regulative rules for a trial by jury might include something like the following: 'Jurors should not let their own prejudices influence their judgement.' 'Counsel should not make emotional appeals to the jury! 'Judges should not intimidate witnesses.'</page><page sequence="19">189 The constitutive rules for a trial by jury specify conditions for a social action to count as a verdict; an individual to fulfil the role of a juror; or a social organisation to constitute a court of law. Anyone who tried to specify such rules would quickly become convinced of their relational na? ture: a trial by jury is defined by its relation to legal, judicial and penal sys? tems, and their legislative, bureaucratic and executive agencies; a juror is defined by his relation to the judge, defendant and other jurors within the institutional setting. Further, to fully understand what it is to be juror, for example, one must understand how this role relates to the practice of trials by jury, and the relation of this practice to wider institutional contexts. Such constitutive rules confer meaning on the social psychological phe? nomenon of trial by jury, and provide criteria for the identification and re identification of such phenomena in our own and other forms of human life. Thus social psychological phenomena which do not satisfy the rela? tional definition of a trial would not constitute or count as a real trial: we classify social phenomena which only bear a superficial resemblance to trials but fail to satisfy such relational requirements as 'ritual humiliations' (as in Nazi and Soviet 'mock trials') or 'lynchings' etc. Regulative rules do not define or constitute social psychological phe? nomena, but rather regulate actions and situations etc. defined by constitu? tive rules. The constitutive rule relating to the social role of 'juror' specifies relational criteria that must be satisfied for an individual to occupy the role of juror. The regulative rule 'Jurors should not allow their personal preju? dices to influence their judgement' prohibits a course of action for an indi? vidual who occupies the role of juror in an organisational setting constitut? ed as a court of law (where individual and setting satisfy the constitutive rules). One most significant difference between constitutive and regulative rules is that social psychological phenomena retain their identity under regulative rule violation, but not constitutive rule violation. For example, if the constitutive criteria for a juror are not satisfied, an individual does not quality as a juror: one who satisfies such constitutive criteria remains a juror even if the violates the regulative rules governing the role of juror (e.g. he is only a bad juror if he lets his prejudices influence his judgement). There has been some debate about whether this distinction is relative or absolute (Black, 1972; Gumb, 1972). One point however is quite apparent. Within the Humean causal framework in which these questions are dis? cussed, it is only regulative rules that are candidates for inclusion in a causal account of action, at least insofar as these may be 'internalised' by</page><page sequence="20">190 agents. Constitutive rules are definitional rules for classifying and identify? ing social psychological phenomena, and as such are not even plausible candidates for inclusion in a Humean causal story.3 However it should be clear from the above that the arguments of the hermeneutical psychologist essentially relate to constitutive rules. It is of course true that the understanding of constitutive rules in the so? cial psychological sphere is not an identification of causal relations; but this is equally true of the understanding of constitutive rules in natural science. This is because both types of understanding are the understanding of the semantics and logic of classificatory descriptions of social psycho? logical and natural scientific phenomena. The folk and theoretical social psychologist's understanding of social psychological phenomena is not on a logical par with the natural scientist's identification of causal powers. But it is on a logical par with the natural scientist's understanding of the classi? ficatory rules recognised by members of the scientific community in which he practises. That is, both types of understanding are the understanding of descriptive language, which is quite clearly not equivalent to the identification of caus? al powers. Of course both the natural scientist and the folk and theoretical social psychologist learn o/the causal powers of natural and social psycho? logical phenomena when they come to understand such systems of classifi? catory descriptions. The natural scientist learns that acids are corrosive and turn litmus paper red, and that tin resists corrosion and is superconductive at very low temperatures. The folk and theoretical social psychologist learn that insults cause offence; that aggression brings retaliation; and that warn? ings have the power to alert others to some danger. But at this point a very important qualification must be made. It has al? ready been noted that the meaning of classificatory descriptions in natural science and social psychology is relational in nature: their meaning is de? rived (inter alia) from their relation to other classificatory descriptions via systems of inter-related meaning rules. Constitutive rules in natural science in general make reference to the causal powers of the natural phenomena defined, as in the case of acids and tin. As noted above, this is true to some degree with respect to constitutive rules in the social psychological sphere, as in the case of insults, aggression, and warnings. However most of the constitutive rules for social psychological phenomena define such phenom? ena by their relation to other social psychological phenomena in wider social and institutional contexts.</page><page sequence="21">191 The reason for this is quite straightforward, but quite independent of the point about the relational nature of meaningful descriptions in natural or human science. Social psychological phenomena are themselves relational in nature. It is true that some of the relations constitutive of social psycho? logical phenomena are causal, but equally critical are relations of group membership, domination, co-operation, employment, government, mar? riage, authorisation, legitimation, punishment, treatment etc. Judges and jurors are judges and jurors in virtue of their relation to the social practice of trial by jury: a trial by jury is a trial by jury in virtue of its relation to legal and penal institutions. Anyone who did not satisfy these relations would not be a judge or juror: anything which did not satisfy these rela? tions would not be a trial by jury. The nature and identity of social psycho? logical phenomena is determined by their relation to other social psycho? logical phenomena within the wider social contexts of a form of human life. Two points are worth stressing at this stage to avoid confusion. The first is that the relational nature of social psychological phenomena does not follow from and is quite independent of the relational nature of linguistic meaning. The meanings of natural scientific classificatory descriptions are relational in nature, but many natural scientific phenomena retain their na? tures and identity quite independently of the existence of other natural phe? nomena to which they may be causally related. An acid remains an acid even when it is not reacting with an alkali to form an acid; a sample of tin remains tin even when it is not conducting (or superconducting) electricity. But an individual is not a juror in the absence of constitutive relations to the social practice of trial by jury; an organisational setting is not a trial by jury in the absence of legitimising relations to judicial and penal institu? tions. Of course there are some natural scientific phenomena which are re? lational in nature, such as quarks and magnets: again this neither follows from the relational nature of the meaning of classificatory descriptions, nor does it preclude the existence or investigation of the causal powers of quarks and magnetic fields. The second point is that it is of course true that in one sense most natural phenomena are relational in nature, but this is quite different from the sense in which social psychological phenomena are relational in nature. The nature and identity of many natural scientific phenomena is deter? mined by their internal composition and structure, and these intrinsic rela? tions (or structures) are described by theoretical classifications in the form</page><page sequence="22">192 of real definitions. But the nature and identity of social psychological phe? nomena is determined by extrinsic relations to other social psychological phenomena, whose individual natures and identities are determined by their relational location within wider social practices in a form of human life. Some examples may make this distinction between intrinsic and extrinsic constitutive relations clearer. The nature and identity of tin and sulphur is determined by their causal powers and internal composition and structure (intrinsic relations): the nature and identity of a magnetic field is deter? mined by its directional forces (extrinsic relations). The nature and identity of a particular example of the biological species homo sapiens is deter? mined by its anatomical and bio-chemical composition and structure (in? trinsic relations); the nature and identity of the prime minister of the Unit? ed Kingdom is determined by his or her relation to other key members of the executive and legislature (extrinsic relations). A natural or social psychological phenomenon retains its identity if such intrinsic or extrinsic relations are satisfied. The nature and identity of most natural scientific phenomena is determined by intrinsic relations; the nature and identity of most social psychological phenomena is determined by extrinsic relations. The difference is also marked by a difference in the development of theoretical explanations. Explanations of (the causal powers of) natural phenomena such as tin, sulphur and plutonium proceed by more detailed specifications of their structural composition (e.g. mo? lecular structure, atomic structure etc.). Explanations of social psychologi? cal phenomena proceed by more detailed accounts of the relation of phe? nomena such as trials or interviews to wider social practices in a form of life, or of the relation of particular actions such as marriage and betrayal to the agent's wider goals and life-projects. One crucial relation that is partially constitutive of many social psycho? logical phenomena is participants' cognitive representations of their past, present and (possible) future actions in relation to past, present and (pos? sible) future social contexts. This marks another real and critical difference between constitutive rules in natural and human sciences. For although acids, tin, sulphur, quarks, magnetic fields etc. can exist independently of the natural scientist's representation of them according to theoretical clas? sifications, social psychological phenomena such as criminal acts or oaths do not exist independently of social representations of criminal acts as criminal acts, or agent representations of oaths as oaths. (A social represen</page><page sequence="23">193 tation is a representation of a class of actions, roles, situations etc. shared by participants in a form of human life; an agent representation is the agent's representation of a particular action in a particular relational context.) It is of course in this sense that the hermeneutical critic may legitimately claim that the theoretical classifications of the scientific social psychologist must 'presuppose' those of the lay observer (Winch, 1958): for many social psychological phenomena are partially constituted by the critical relation of social and agent representation. However one must be very careful about this, for an overstatement of this point leads to the implausible and conten? tious conclusion that the task of the human scientist is restricted to the mere articulation and clarification of agent accounts of human action. There may very well be relational social psychological phenomena for which social representation is a non-constitutive relation: for example cer? tain forms of dominance relations may exist quite independently of any so? cial representation of such relations. Certainly many relational social psy? chological phenomena are constituted quite independently of agent repre? sentations: ignorance is no defence in a court of law when one is charged with a criminal action, and social incompetents and unwary anthropolo? gists may quite unintentionally insult their colleagues or marry their native informants. 5. Relations and representation A clearer perspective on this issue may be gained by considering a final ar? gument of the hermeneutical psychologist. It might be conceded by the her? meneutical critic that many causal explanations relating natural phenom? ena and their (constitutive) causal powers and natures are conceptual truths, but objected that such conceptual truths are set up and established a posteriori, as a result of observed correlations between natural phenom? ena and their manifested powers. We discover by observational correlation that effects a, b, c are manifested by natural phenomenon N, and conse? quently define natural phenomenon N in terms of some of these effects (nominal definition). That is, such conceptual truths relating natural phe? nomena and their powers and natures (nominal and real definitions) are set up as a result of genuine scientific discoveries, and are subject to modifica? tion and revision as theory and experimental technology develops.</page><page sequence="24">194 Thus Lavoisier discovered that some acids (substances defined as sour tasting, corrosive, having the power to change the colour of plant dyes, etc.) contained the newly discovered element oxygen, and built this into his defi? nition of an 'acid'. When Davy discovered that oxymuriatic acid (the old name for hydrochloric acid) displayed all the original powers and proper? ties of an acid (sour-tasting, corrosive etc.) but did not contain oxygen, and that Lavoisier's 'acids' (sulphuric and nitric) and oxymuriatic acid con? tained hydrogen, he defined 'acid' as (inter alia) a substance containing hy? drogen. And so on up to the present-day definition in terms of proton do? nation. But it is argued that our understanding of the conceptual truths of social psychology is not like this at all. Our understanding of the meaning of action via constitutive (and regulative) rules cannot be based on a poste? riori observational discoveries, because there are no observational phe? nomena independent of our concepts of them: There existed electrical storms and thunder long before there were hu? man beings to form concepts of them or establish that there was any connection between them. But it does not make sense to say that hu? man beings might have been issuing commands and obeying them be? fore they came to form the concept of command and obedience. (Winch, 1958) But the conceptual truths which describe the relational natures of social psychological phenomena are a posteriori. There were relational social psy? chological phenomena such as aggression, dominance and mother offspring bonds before there were humans with cognitive and linguistic abilities to represent these phenomena in thought and language (according to constitutive rules). When primitive man developed symbolic systems which enabled him to cognitively represent such shared human relations, he would have represented (natural and) social psychological phenomena which predated his representations: The origins of the human family and of kinship should then be consid? ered as being in the symbolic definition and generalization of statuses ... already present_The variety of extant kinship systems would then be interpreted as the results of millenia of cultural elaboration ... of ... the kinship system or systems that first appeared when our apish forefathers began to find their own behaviour suitable material for symbol-making. (Sade, 1965)</page><page sequence="25">195 Indeed some critical social psychological relations such as the mother-child bond were probably necessary conditions for the development of such sym? bolic systems (Bruner, 1975). But of course such existing social psychological phenomena were trans? formed by the new relation of cognitive representation by agents: for ex? ample the mother-offspring relation was transformed by representations of this relation as the mother-child relation. Regulative rules prescribing ap? propriate actions in relation to phenomena partially constituted by repre? sentations (in accord with constitutive rules), were a development that led to further transformations of the original phenomena: for example regula? tive rules obligating the baptism of children of mothers related to fathers by holy wedlock. Such phenomena were further transformed and new phe? nomena created (and further transformed) as a result of changing represen? tations of developing social psychological phenomena: novel actions such as baptism and novel relations such as marriage resulted in changing con? cepts of developing mother-child relations. In this fashion the human ani? mal transformed and partially recreated his social psychological world in representational reactions to developing social structures, as he progressed through the stages of hunter-gatherer, agricultural, industrial and post industrial man. The developing constitutive rules of the folk and theoreti? cal social psychologist describe in a posteriori conceptual truths the devel? oping relational natures of social psychological phenomena. Thus it is not anthropomorphic to talk of aggression in rats, dominance among apes, or mother-offspring bonds between chimpanzees; although it is anthropomorphic to talk about wars, servants and wives, which are the product of developing human representations of actions in the social world. Furthermore phenomena such as aggression, dominance and mother-offspring relations appear in more varied and extended forms in human forms of life, because of their transformation by developing rela? tions, including novel social and agent representations. Thus such constitutive and regulative rules are not mere 'labelling de? vices for things which would have happened anyway' (Fox, 1977). For transformed representations of developing human relations may constitute and delineate a different range of phenomena from the original. Human regulative rules such as the 'incest taboo' (L?vi-Strauss, 1960) prohibit ac? tions in relation to persons represented according to constitutive rules. The original constitutive rules for 'mother' and 'sister', for example, which re? ferred solely to biological mothers and sisters, may be developed in some</page><page sequence="26">196 forms of life to include biological aunts and nieces in extended families; 'mothers' and 'sisters' in religious communities; 'sisters' in radical feminist political groups; the stepmother of the adult son; the fianc? of the psychot? ic patient. Participants in such forms of life follow regulative rules prohib? iting sexual intercourse with respect to persons represented as 'mothers' and 'sisters' according to the constitutive rules of that form of life. This is not of course to deny that developing social relations within ex? tended families or religious groups are directly or indirectly parasitic upon biologically inherited behaviour patterns, or that these phylogenic re? straints circumscribe the limits of the development of novel social psycho? logical transformations and creations (Reynolds, 1976). Indeed the fact of such biological explanations of some behaviours is worthy of note. The meanings of the descriptions 'mother', 'sister', 'son' etc. are relational in nature, and the social psychological phenomena thus described are them? selves relational in nature; but the explanation of the avoidance of sexual relations between biological mothers, sisters, and sons etc. may very well be biological in nature, for example in terms of inherited 'evolutionary stable strategies' (Dawkins, 1976). Certainly such causal explanations are not ruled out by the relational nature of the meaning of descriptions of so? cial psychological phenomena, or the relational nature of the phenomena themselves. But it certainly does not mean that all actions in accord with the incest taboo can be explained in this way. The explanation of the avoid? ance of sexual relations with non-biological mothers and sisters (e.g. in ex? tended families or religious communities) is to be explained in terms of the agent following the regulative rule prohibiting sexual relations with persons represented as mothers and sisters according to the constitutive rules of that form of life. However these remarks return us to another real difference between rep? resentations of social psychological phenomena and natural scientific phe? nomena. One of the critical goals for a scientific social psychology is an understanding of how agents who act and interact with imperfect represen? tations of social reality manage to reproduce and maintain the social order (Rommetveit, 1978; Harr?, 1979) (such a hypothetical mechanism of repro? duction is also of course a potential mechanism for transformation and change). This huge question is not considered here; however it does have a significant implication for the causal issue. Agents have not only imperfect but may also have more or less inade? quate representations of the constitutive and regulative rules partially con</page><page sequence="27">197 stitutive of the social order; or they may be simply mistaken with respect to individual representations, because of inattention to relevant details of the situation. Thus an agent may misrepresent a quite justified critical re? mark as a malicious insult, or suppose he is threatening someone simply by speaking in a loud voice. The same is of course true in a sense of the natural scientist: he may misidentify an alkali as an acid because he treats corrosive power alone as indicative of an acid (because of an inadequate representation of classification principles or inattention to detail). How? ever with respect to agent representations in social psychology there is a sig? nificant difference: even if the agent's representation is inaccurate or inade? quate because of inattention or misunderstanding of the constitutive rule, or abnormal or inappropriate because of idiosyncratic interpretations of the constitutive rule, such a representation still plays a potential role in the causal explanation of human action. Agents who represent situations as 'threatening' may act in accord with such a representation, even if this is in fact inaccurate or inappropriate; agents who believe they have the power to make friends and influence people may act in accord with this belief, even if this belief is patently false to the external observer. This feature can perhaps be clarified by noting that classifications of social psychological phenomena in accord with constitutive rules form a continuum according to the degree of constitution by social and agent representations. There are relational phenomena such as aggression, dominance and mother-offspring bonds which may exist independently of social and agent representations. However when these are the object of social and agent rep? resentations, such representations play a potential role in the causal explan? ation of human action: for example in the explanation of baptism and the moral education of children. There are relational phenomena which are partially constituted by social representations, but not by agent representations. There are no dishonest acts, insults or debts in forms of life in which no class of actions or relations are represented as dishonest, insulting, or debts. In forms of life where there are such products of social representations (in conjunction with other relations), an agent may be dishonest, insulting or in debt, even if he does not represent his actions or position as such: for example he is in debt if he receives some chargeable goods or service without payment, irrespective of how he represents the situation. But of course his representation of his actions and position may very well play a role in the causal explanation of his actions: he may act differently according to whether he represents his</page><page sequence="28">198 action as dishonest or not, or his present position as in debt or not. Finally there are phenomena which are partially or wholly constituted by agent representations, such as oaths, challenges, prayer, and risk-taking. A situation is not a personal challenge unless the agent represents it as a chal? lenge; a verbal utterance is not an oath unless it is represented as an oath; a behaviour is not an example of risk-taking unless it is represented as a risk. At this level part of the explanans and the explanandum meet: because such phenomena are constituted by agent representations, such representa? tions play an automatic (albeit partial) role in the causal explanation of re? lated actions. Any explanation of oath-taking must include an (at least im? plicit) reference to the agent's representation of his activity as oath-taking; any explanation of an agent's response to a challenge must include an (at least implicit) reference to his representation of the situation as a personal challenge. Included in this last category are psychological phenomena such as emo? tion and motivation. Explanatory references to emotional and motiva? tional states are not references to mysterious inner states or entities (pheno menological or physiological) which are the object of direct introspection or indirect inference for agents or observers. They are essentially references to evaluative representations of (actual and possible; past, present and fu? ture) social reality which provide reasons for action (Greenwood, 1984): the agent is ashamed just if he represents his position as disgraceful and humil? iating; the agent's purpose is to embarrass a colleague just if this is the rep? resented objective of his action. Of course there is no clear cut or absolute distinction between agent rep? resentations which are partially constitutive of social reality, and represen? tations which are wholly constitutive of emotion and motivation. This is because social representations regularly provide personal reasons for ac? tion (either directly or via personal transformations): he retaliated because he represented the other's action as insulting; he intervened because he rep? resented the situation as an emergency; he said nothing because he had tak? en an oath. No doubt this partially explains why emotion and motivation are regu? larly a matter of public display in ordinary action and discourse (Harr? and Secord, 1972; Coulter, 1979). Nevertheless personal meaning representa? tions are not always so transparent. They present a special problem when we are dealing with difficult and ambiguous phenomena: specifically they present a problem when we are dealing with alien or deviant social groups</page><page sequence="29">199 (the drug takers and soccer hooligans) or individuals (the neurotic and psy? chotic and inspired genius), and subjects in artificially created laboratory experiments in social psychology. 6. Conclusion Contemporary scientific psychology is based upon an inadequate empiri? cist philosophy of science, ultimately derived from Hume's account of cau? sality. Hermeneutical psychology does not appear to provide a viable alter? native, because of its commitment to the thesis that explanations of human action are non-causal. The arguments of the hermeneutical psychologist in support of this thesis are vitiated because they are based upon the same in? adequate empiricist account of science. However it is unfortunate that the practising psychologist rejects the hermeneutical position tout courte: for these arguments indirectly illustrate the relational nature of social psycho? logical phenomena, and the critical relation of (partial) constitution by so? cial and agent representations. In this sense the arguments of the hermeneutical psychologist do have an ontological implication, insofar as these representations play a constitu? tive role; but this implication does not rule out the causal explanation of human actions in social situations constituted in this way. That is, these ar? guments embody important truths about the explanando of social psychol? ogy; they do not establish the non-causal nature of the explanans. Ironi? cally in fact they suggest precisely the opposite: representations of social reality play an important role in the causal explanation of human action insofar as they provide reasons for action. A detailed discussion of the sense in which such representations play a role in the causal explanation of action is beyond the scope of this paper. This question will be dealt with in a future article. The basic implications of the above discussion may be expressed by con? sidering the fundamental inadequacy of (empiricist) instrumentalist con? ceptions of theory in psychology. It is hard to understand how theories which merely serve to 'organise and synthesise' observational correlations could develop (in a non-arbitrary fashion) to generate novel and successful predictions, unless such theoretical constructs are given a realist interpreta? tion (Hesse, 1976). In actual fact psychological theories have been inter? preted more or less realistically (despite the official rhetoric to the con</page><page sequence="30">200 trary); otherwise the historical progress and development of psychological theory is scarcely intelligible. But the significance of a realist interpretation of theory in a psychological science is often missed because its major and immediate impact is upon the observational rather than the theoretical lev? el of description. It is now almost an axiom of contemporary philosophy of science that all observations in science are more or less theory-informed (Hanson, 1958; Kuhn, 1970; Feyerabend, 1975): there is no theory-independent level of ob? servation. But observations in a psychological science are theory-informed in a deeper and dualistic sense. For if references to cognitive-affective states are interpreted realistically, then a human science must concern itself with both the scientist's and his subjects' theories about the social world. Thus it should be recognised that there are two levels of theory in a psy? chological science: the most primitive and logically prior is the subject's own theories about his actions in the social world, which must be presup? posed by the psychologist's theories about the causal determinants of his behaviour. An environmental contingency or depth psychological explana? tion of prayer, for example, presupposes that the subject represented his ac? tivity as prayer; and although a subject may be faced with an emergency without representing it as such, it cannot be presumed that his consequent actions will be the same whether he does or not. This of course in no way precludes the psychologist from introducing and operationally specifying theories of human interaction couched in concepts unavailable to participants (e.g. sublimation, cognitive dissonance, role distance, desensitization etc.). It does however require that such projected theories retain conceptual links with common conceptual definitions of the phenomena investigated and explained, and that such common conceptual definitions are reproduced in laboratory experiments and established in field studies that serve as the testing ground of such theories. For example, instances of human aggression may usefully be analysed in terms of their antecedents or consequents, or higher-order in? teraction variables. But unless such theoretical analyses continue to presup? pose common conceptual definitions such as 'the deliberate injury of an? other' (Berkowitz and Donnerstein, 1982), and unless such subject defini? tions are reproduced in laboratory experiments and established in field studies, theories based upon such observations will not furnish adequate explanations of human aggression. I have argued elsewhere (Greenwood, 1982) that the present inadequacies</page><page sequence="31">201 of the laboratory experiment in social psychology are directly traceable to the practising psychologist's failure to appreciate the relational nature of social psychological phenomena, and the critical relation of constitution by social and agent representations. Attempts to isolate social psychologi? cal phenomena in laboratory experiments regularly alter their relational nature, and transform participant representations in indeterminate and un? predictable ways. But of course the basic problem is more general than this: the identification and re-identification of social psychological phenomena in any observational setting requires a clear appreciation of their relational nature. It is essentially for this reason that agent accounts of their own be? haviour are of central and critical importance to a scientific social psychol? ogy. It is of course true that agent accounts may sometimes be inaccurate or dishonest; but it is scarcely intelligible to suppose that they are regularly mistaken (Greenwood, 1987), and certainly self-defeating for a scientific social psychology. The agent normally knows what he is doing and his rea? sons for doing it because such representations provide the point and pur? pose of his co-operative and co-ordinated actions and interactions in the social world. As such standard or (more or less) transformed representa? tions are partially constitutive of the social order, the general accuracy of the agent's representations is manifested by his ability to act and interact in the social world. The present inaccuracies and inadequacies represent a straightforward challenge that must be overcome in the development of a scientific psychology. To deny agent accounts a critical and foundational place in social psychology is to deny access to the very phenomena of social psychology: it is to preclude rather than advance a scientific social psychol? ogy. NOTES 1. Of course Hume's analysis of causality also included the elements of spatial contiguity and tempor? al succession. These are not considered here because they play no major role in discussions of the causal nature of explanations of human action. In fact it is doubtful if these elements are essential to Hume's philosophical position: the element of spatial contiguity included in the Treatise (1739) was dropped in the Enquiry (1748), and Hume expressed serious doubts about his own justification for including temporal succession. 2. Only a logical sketch of these arguments is presented here. More detailed accounts can be found in Harr? and Madden (1975), Bhaskar (1975) and Greenwood (1982), from which the discussion of the following section is drawn.</page><page sequence="32">202 3. In a future article (Greenwood, 1986) I intend to argue that both constitutive and regulative rules play a causal role in the explanation of human action. In fact this is suggested by the following discussion. REFERENCES Allport, G.W. (1937). Personality: a psychological interpretation. New York: Holt. Berkowitz, L., and Donnerstein, E. (1982).
