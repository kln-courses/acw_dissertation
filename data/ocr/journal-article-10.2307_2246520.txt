THE term Illusion is in science generally confined to errors of sense-perception. On the other hand in popular discourse it is extended to a number of other errors. Thus we speak of an illusion of memory, of an illusory idea respecting one's own character, and so on. If we try to discover what these errors have in common we appear to find that they are all semblances of imnmediate knowledge, by which I mean any variety of cogni- tion which is not consciously based ona some other cognition and which appears self'evident. The term illusion is thus opposed to fallacy which simulates the form of a conscious process of inference. Although psychology undoubtedly tends to assimilate all intellectual processes and to identify immediate and mediate knowledge, or, to use Lewes's expression, the logic of feeling and the logic of signs, as forms of one process, there appear to be certain advantages in marking off for separate treatment those errors which simulate the form of irresistible intuitions not obtained by any possibly precarious operation of reasoning. If for no other reason, these popularly recognised illusions may afford a specially valuable subject of investigation as presenting the forces which underlie all error in their higchest intensity, in other words as constituting prerogative instances of these forces. If we adopt the above definition of Illusion, we may roughLly 1</page><page sequence="2">2 Illtsions of Introspection. mark off four possible varieties, namely, illusions (1) of (external) perception, (2) of introspection or internal perception, (3) of memory, and (4) of belief, the latter covering those erroneous 'self-evident' cognitions which are not included under any of the other head-s and which resolve themselves into anticipations, definite or indefinite, and wider errors respecting the world, self, or human nature in general. Each of these varieties can, I conceive, be dealt with most effectively by taking the first class, that is to say, the well-recog- nised class of sense-illusions as our type. An illusion of sense may be defined as a misinterpretation of a sense-impression resulting in a percept which is afterwards found not to corres- pond to the object actually present to sense. By. interpretation must here be meant not only the taking up of the sense-impres- sion into a percept by a synthesis of presentative and representa- tive elements, but also the, definition of the sense-impression itself so far as this depends on processes of discrimination, comparison and classification. Illusions of sense or perception fall into two roughly distin- guishable classes, Passive or a posteriori illusions, and Active or a priori illusions. The former owe their force to somethina in the sense-impression of the moment, to a powerful suggestion of a mental image by this, in relation to which the mind is com- paratively passive. The latter owe their cogency rather to some pre-existing activity of the mind, to some preconception or form of expectation, which in relation to this resulting percept may, to adopt the useful expression of Dr. J. lIughlings Jackson, be called a process of pre-perception. As an illustration of each class I may take the alleged experiences of ghost-seers. A man may imagine that he sees a ghost either because he happens in the dark to see an object which acGidentally bears a curious resemblance to an apparition as usually described, or because he is in a room which he knows bears the reputation of being haunted, and where consequently his imagination is busy shaping the representation of the object. In most illusions of perception both the elements of suggestion and preconception cooperate. Yet we may have a pure illusion of suggestion, and in a centrally originating hallucination we have clearly a pure illusion of pre- conception. 1 Let us now pass to our special subject-Illusions of Intro- spection. By Introspection I mean here the mind's immediate reflective cognition of its own states as such. In one sense, of course, everything we know is a mental state, actual or imagined. Thus a ps-jmression is known txactlv as any other feeling I I have worked out a scheme of Sense-illusion in an article headed " Illusions of Perception " in the New Quarterly Magazine of April last.</page><page sequence="3">Illusions of Introspection. 3 of the mind, as a mental modification. Yet we do not speak of introspectively recognising a sensation. Our sense-impressions are marked off from all other feelings by having an objective aspect, so that in attending to one of them our minds pass away from themselves in what Professor Bain calls the attitude of objective regard. Introspection is confined to feelings which want this objective aspect, and includes sensation only so far as it is viewed apart from external objects on its subjective side, as a feeling of the mind, a process which is next to impossible where the sensation has little emotional colour, as an ordinary sensation of sight or of, articulate sound. This being so, an illusion of introspection will in the main be sufficiently distinguished from one of perception. Even a hal- lucination of sense, whether setting out from a subjective sensa- tion or not, always contains the semblance of such a sensation, and so would not be correctly classed with errors of introspection. One or two doubtful cases inter-mediate between the two groups will be touched on presently. Just as illusions of introspection must be marked off fromii those of perception, so must they be distiniguished from those of memory. It may be contended with some show of reason that, strictly speaking, all introspection is retrospection, since even in attenlding to a persistent feeling the mind is reflectively repre- senting to itself the immediately preceding moinentary experience of that feeling. In other words, to have a feeling and to know that we have it are not precisely the same mental conditions, the second being the immediate consequence of the first and constituting a more fully developed intellectual state. Yet sup- posing this view to be correct it does not hinder a broad distinction between acts of introspection and acts of memory. Introspection must be regarded as confined to immediately ante- cedent mental states with reference to which no error of memory can be supposed to arise. It would follow that illusions connect- ed with the consciousness of personal identity would fall rather under the class of mnemonic than that of introspective error. Once more, an illusion of introspection must be distin- guished from one of belief. An error of the latter sort may have its origrin in one of the former: thus a man's illusory opinion of himself may involve errors of introspection. By the latter as distinguished froin the former I propose to mean only such errors as are connected with single acts of introspection. In relation to these such an illusion of belief would be viewed as a compound. Finally, it is to be observed that our definition of an illusion of introspection serves to mark it off from a fallacy of introspec- tion by the absence of anything like a conscious process</page><page sequence="4">4 Illitsions of Introspection. inference. Thus if we suppose the derivation by Descartes of the fact of the existence of God from his possession of the idea to be erroneous, such a consciously perforined act of reason- ing would constitute a fallacy Irather than an illusion of introspection. Thus far we have been concerned with settling the definition or determining the notion of an illusion of introspection: we have not yet inquired whether there answer to this ideal scheme any actual contents. We have now to pass to this ques- tion, namely, whether in observing and interpreting other mental feelings besides sense-impressions and their counterfeits, sub- jective sensations, anything analogous to sense-illusion ever happens. If we define an illusion of perception as an erroneous projec- tion of subjective ideas into the region of inmmediately present objective existence, we shall at once see that the idea of such an illusioni may be extended to misinterpretations of the -immediate subjective accompaniments of sense-impressions. Such illusions would form a connecting link between those of perception properly' so-called, and illusions of introspection in a stricter seiise supposing sueli to exist. As our first example of such an error we may take the wrong attribution of beauty to external objects. I do not here raise the question whether there is any external quality independent of our minds answering to our sentinlent of the beautiful, or whether in every case our projection of this sentimnent into the region of objective existence is illusory: this is a philosophical rather than a psychological question. I may assume here tllat there are certain aspects of external things, certain relations of form, colour, together with certain associations, which are com- monly recognised as the causes of the feeling of beauty, and popularly recognised as the embodiments of the quality. Accord- ilig to this view, illusioll arises whenever an individual errolne- ously passes from a present feeling to the external object arid calls this beautiful, thereby regarding it as a cause of a common aestlhetic pI%asure. Now this error is very common. Our aesthetic impressioiis though agreeinga up to a certain poiut do not agree throughout. Pernmaiient differences of natural sensibility, of experienlce and of association make one thing highly interesting to one man while it is wholly uninteresting to another; and temporary fluctuations of mental conditions will make a thing seem beau- tiful to the samne mnan at one time and not at another. Yet the deeply-rooted habit of taking an individual feeling as the repre- sentation of a common feeling, a habit wlhich, as I have elsewhere observed,-is no doubt connected with the strong,est social instincts</page><page sequence="5">Illusions of Introspection. 5 of our nature, leads us invariably to give objective validity to our private and personal aesthetic preferences. It is to be remarked that these errors roughly fall into the two classes of passive and active illusions. That is to say, the wrong ascription of a common aesthetic value to an object may arise either through a peculiar effect of the sense-impression or through the cooperation of an antecedent subjective disposition. The former class would be illustrated by the common attribution of objective beauty to things which delight us mainly through special-individual suggestions, as when for examiple a inan pre- dicates a special beauty of his home scenery, or a mother of her favourite boy. Illustrations of the active variety would be found in those judgments which depend on a pre-existing condition of mnind. Our enjoyment of nature or art is conditioned in part by our temporary mood or mental tone. There are momients of excep- tional emotional exhilaration when even a commonplacelandscape will excite an appreciable thrill of admiration; and in such a case we irresistibly tend to assign a corresponding degree of objective value to the scene. The error exactly corresponds to those illusions of sense which arise from overlooking the rela- tivity of our sensations to the organic conditions of the moment. It may be said to be an illusion due to a temporary hyperaesthesis of the eriotional organs. What applies to the sense of beauty will, it is clear, apply to all other feelings excited by external objects. Nor is the error confined to those cases in which the object is fitted to touch a number of minds, such as the awful, the grotesque, the hideous and so on, but sometimes arises even in the instance of a dis- tinctly personal feeling. Thus the fond mother instinctively attributes the many feelings of pleasure excited in her mind by the sight of her child in the form of certain lovable qualities to their exciting cause. In the very act of loving it she regards it as objectively lovable. The other group of illusions standing between those of per- ception proper and those of introspection are errors connected with reading the external inanifestations of the feelings of others, and generally with the interpretation of signs so far as it is immiediate and not the result of a process of conscious reasoning. To interpret the look or word of another is clearly a mental process very analogous to sense-perception. There is first of all a recognised sense-impression: and secondly the interpretation of this impression by help of a representative image; and both processes appear to be equally immediate or 'intuitive'. On the other hand there is a well-marked difference: for while perception proper is an imaginative reconstruction of external experiences, such as muscular and tactual feelings, interpretation</page><page sequence="6">6 Illusions of Introspection0. of signs properly so called takes place by a representation of subjective feelings. And further, and this is the chief point, in the latter case there is a distinct recoanition of the fact that the feelings so represented are not our own, but belong to ano- ther consciousness.1 The errors incident to this process of immediate intuition of others' feelings or thoughts are familiar enough. Here again we may conveniently distinguish between a passive and an active form of the illusion. A passive illusion arises whenever through the force of an inseparable association a given external mark calls up a wrong interpretative image. In the reading of emno- tional expression the signal instance of this error is histrionic illusion. The assumption of the characteristic bodily attitude, gesture and tone of a passion, as anger, by a first-rate actor is powerfully delusive, since the fact is, according to the best autho- rities, that the actor cannot venture to give himself up to the particular emotion which he simulates. Another example of this illusion is inot uncommon in everyday life. A man has some peculiarity of features, such as unusually elevated eye-brows, or a drawn corner of the mouth which irresistibly calls up some par- ticular shade of feeling. Even when we grow accustomed to the peculiarity, such is the force of the impulse to project the sug- gested feeling that we continually tend to lapse into the silly error. A similar error often happens with respect to the interpreta- tion of language when this is used in an unfamiliar way. The often ludicrous oddity of a foreign language to one who visits the country in which it is spoken consists in the calling up of wrong meanings, namely such as have become associated with similar sounds in one's own language. The Englishman who visits Germany cannot for a long time hear a lady use the expression 'Mein Mainn' without a half-belief that the person is specially dwelling on the fact of her husband's mascuilinity, and the function of support and protectioin attributed to the sex. The more active errors connected with a wrong reading of feelings into other minds would furnish us with material for a long chapter. I can only just touch on one or two striking examples. It'is a subject of common remark that a highly sympathetic nature, eager for the response of another mind, is predisposed to ascribe to those wThom it meets utterly wrong sentiments. The extreme case of this error is of course that of 1 We seem to want some scientific term to express this act of interpreting the meintal states of others. The word 'read' is not precise enough. It is sometimes said that this interpretation is compounded of perception proper aind introspection: but this does niot seem to me to be an adequ ate account of the process. However this is, the reader will see my reasons for dealing with it before introspection proper.</page><page sequence="7">Illusions of Introsvection. 7 the deluded lover who gazing into the eyes of a quite common- place mistress 'intuites' by a fine spiritual sense a perfect reflection of his favourite aspirations and aims. Again, the interpretation of nature by the anthropomorphic and the poetic fancy is clearly an example of an illusory pro- jection of individual feeling. Sometimes this is due to some very remarkable degree of resemblance between the object and the human form: but in most cases the force of the illusion is due to a strong emotional predisposition in the spectator's mind. The lonely communer with nature, though he has turned his back on human sympathisers, tends to spread his deepest feel- ings over his inanimate surroundings. His longing, his sadness, his.momentary delights seem to flash back upon him from the face of nature as from a mirror. And it is this strong emotional craving for sympathy which so often underlies those quaint poetic transformations of natural objects into living forms on which I had occasion to dwell when speaking of illusions of sense. Finally it may be noted that this erroneous reading of indi- vAdual feelings into other minds is exemplified in a good deal of current criticism of art. Thus a reader who feels in a particular way when reading a poem instinctively tends to project the feeling into the work and to regard it as the direct outcome of the author's mind. He recognises it, he will tell you, by an 'intuitive faculty'. Unfortunately it not unfrequently happens that two natures are affected differently by one and the same pQem, just because they come to the reading of it with very different emotional predispositions and anticipations; and then there is the obvious difficulty of ascribing incompatible feelings to one and the same mind. A student of the ' higher criticism,' as it is called, may amuse himself by discovering instances of such contradictory emotional intuitions. And the same thing shows itself in the current modes of talking about music. It is a commonplace that the same music is felt very differently by different persons according to their emotional susceptibilities and dispositions. Starting from this well-ascertained fact, Mr. Gurney has recently argued with considerable ingenuity that much of the common reading of certain sentiments into musical composi- tion as though they were in the composer's mind and consciously expressed themselves in his musical utterances is altogether illusory-' In all these cases the illusion will of course have more of the active character if in addition to the pre-existinig force of per- manent habits of feeling there is some temporary concrete I The Power of Sound, pp. 345 ff.</page><page sequence="8">8 Illusions of Introspection. emotional impulse at work. Thus a man will more readily find sadness in a piece of music if he goes to listen to it in a sad mood. Precisely the same thing shows itself in the more intellectual kind of interpretation, that of words. Our misapprehensions of others' thoughts are due in part to our permanent intellectual habits, in part to our temporary intellectual condition. To give an illustration of this last, the Section "On Language" in the fifth volume of Lewes's Problems of Li,fe and Miind begins thus: " The great Lagrange," {&amp;c. Having the image of 'language' in my mind I read again and again "The great Language," puzzling over the sense, before I recognised my error. It follows from what has just been said that when an external impression is one which suggests the existence of a particular feeling in another mind, and this is- instantly recognised as a cause of some different feeling in our mind, the tendency to give objective reality to this- cause will be exceptionally powerful, being compounded of the two forces just considered. And accordingly it is in this class of feelings, as gratitude, anger, contempt, &amp;c., that we find some of the most coercive forms of illusion. The action of another that seems to be an intentional injury will often produce for a moment the faint illusion that we have been wronged even when evidence has completely satisfied our judgment that no injury was intended. The con- trasting illusion is illustrated in those cases in which vain people tend to take as compliments words and actions which the slightest cool inspection would show to be quite innocent of any such intention. It is obvious that temperament and pre-existiilg habits of feeling, together with temporary conditions of mind, will greatly determine the character and force of these illusions in different cases. It may be added that the powerful tendency of the anthropo- morphic fancy to vivify and personify nature, which as we have seen rests mainly on the second of the two impulses just con- sidered, is aided by the first as well. It is a familiar fact that when a man accidentally hits- his foot against a stone or other obstacle he feels for the moment an irresistible impulse to be angry with the innocent offender, that is to say to vaguely repre- sent the object as intending to injure him. And in quite a similar way our calmer emotions tend to construct causes for themselves in the shape of vaguely represented emotional dis- positions and intentions i'n nature towards ourselves. Thus the deep pleasure which a beautiful natural scene imparts easily passes into the form of a sentiment of gratitude towards somne friendly spirit of Nature. But the reader may think that all this time we have been</page><page sequence="9">Illusions of Introspection. 9 dwelling on the confines of illusions- of perception and have not touched as yet any errors of introspection properly so called. Allowing the force of this remark I will now pass to onr proper inquiry, namely, whether there are any errors connected with the interpretation of subjective states of mind which do not arise as concomitants of the direct effects of external agencies, but appear as isolated subjective phenomena. Now a mere glance at our everyday modes of describing internal states proper will show that there is something like a slight constant error in the ordinary process of introspection. Abstract reflection on subjective feelings is- an art learned with considerable difficulty, and presupposes a fairly high degree of intellectual culture. Where this is wanting there is a manifest disposition to translate internal feelings into terms of external impressions. Not that the process approaches to one of halluci- nation; but onlly that the internal feelings are intuited as having a cause or origin analogous to that of sense-impressions. Thus to the uncultivated mind a sudden thought seems like an anrkouncement froln without. The superstitious man talks of being led by some good or evil spirit when new ideas arise in his mind or new resolutions shape themselves. To the simple intelligence of the boor every thought presents itself as an ana- logue of an audible voice, and he commonly describes his rough musings as saying this and that to himself. And this mode of viewing the matter is reflected even in the language of cultivated persons. Thus we say ' The idea struck me,' or 'was borne in on me,' ' I was promnpted to do so and so,' and so on, and in this manner tend to assimilate internal to external mental phe-, nomena. Much the same thing shows itself in our customary modes of describing our internal feelings of pleasure and pain. When a man in a state of mental depression speaks of having 'a load' on his mind it is evident that he is interpreting a mental by help of an analogy with a bodily feeling. Similarly when we talk of the mind being torn by doubt or worn by anxiety. lt would seem as though we instinctively translated mental plea- sures and pains into the language of bodily sensations. The explanation of this deeply rooted tendency to a slightly illusory view of our mental states is, I think, an easy one. For one thing it follows from the relation of the mental image to the sense impression that we should tend to assimilate the former to the latter as to its nature and origin. This would account for the common habit of regarding thoughts, which are of course accompanied by representatives of their verbal symbols, as internal voices, a habit which is probably especially characteristic of the child and the uncivilised man, as it is also characteristic of the insane.</page><page sequence="10">10 Illusions of Introspection. Another reason, however, must be sought for the habit of assimilating internal feelings to external sensations. If lan- guage has been evolved as an incident of social life, at once its effect and its cause, it would seem to follow that it must have first shaped itself to the needs of expressing those commnon objective experiences which we receive by way of our senses. Our habitual modes of thought, limited as they are by language, retain traces of this origin. We cannot conceive any mental process except by some vague analogy to a physical process. In other words, we can even now only think with perfect clearness when. we are concerned with some object of common cognition. Thus the sphere of external sensation and of physical agencies furnishes us with the one norm or standard, and we instinctively view subjective mental states as analogues of these.' Still it may be said that these slight nascent errors are hardly worth naming, and the question would still appear to recur whether there are other fully developed errors deserving to rank along with illusions of sense. An examination of these last shows that in many cases the error involves not only a misinterpretation of a present impres- sion but a misapprehension of the impression itself.' Thus some of the illusions known as colour-contrast, the illusion of the stereoscope, and so on, may be said to rest on an inability to distinctly attend to and recognise the elements of sense- impression actually present. Now to this variety of sense- illusion there corresponds a number of errors of introspection. In point of fact, an illusion of introspection proper may ini general be defined as a misapprehension of the contents of consciousness. At first sight no doubt it looks as if the knowledge of a present feeling is absolutely certain. Yet a little consideration of the errors to which we are liable in detecting the quality of a present sense-impression may prepare us to find that the mind's internal eye is sometimes deceived. Introspection, so long as we confine our attention to a single well-defined and 1 The reader will remark that this habit of giving an external material origin to subjective states is in a sense complementary to that instinctive tendency to attribute life alnd consciousness to inanimate objects of which I have already spoken. In an essay on " Poetic Imagination and Primftive Conception," published in the Cornhill Magazine, I have tried to show that both impulses have their explanation in the fact that our first knowledge was naturally of human beings (ourselves and others) with their two- sided nature bodily and mental, anid that we make this our type or norm in regarding all forms of existence, material and mental alike. It would seem to follow from this that the representation of any mental state must at least be accompanied by a vagtue representation of one material object, namely our bodily organism, as a support for the particular feeling.</page><page sequence="11">Illusions of Introspection. it fairly intense feeling which can be supposed to remain constant for a short duration, is of course above suspicion. If I am suffering from intense mental depression a mere glance inwards will suffice to guarantee the existence of the feeling; and no stronger certainty is attainable than that thus reached. Yet the problem of introspective cognition is rarely as simple as this. Let us compare the process of self-observation with that of external p-erception. First of all, it is noteworthy that a state of consciousness at any one moment is an exceedingly complex thing. It is made up of a mass of feelings and active impulses which often combine and blend in a most inextricable way. External sensations come in groups, too, but as a rule they do not fuse in apparently simple wholes as our internal feelings often do. The very possibility of perception depends on a clear discrimination of sense-ele- ments, for example, the several sensations of colour obtained by the stimulation of different parts of' the retina.' But no such clearly defined mosaic of feelings presents itself in the internal region: one element overlaps and partly loses itself in another, and subjective analysis is often an exceedingly difficult matter. Our consciousness is thus a closely woven texture in which the eye fails to trace the sevieral threads or strands. Moreover there is the fact that many of these ingredients are exceedingly shadowy, belonging to that obscure region of subconsciousness which it is so hard to penetrate with the light of discriminative attention. This remark applies with particular force to that mass of organic feelings which constitutes what is known as coenesthesis or vital sense. While, to speak figuiratively, the minute anatomy of con- sciousness is thus difficutt with respect to longitudinal sections of the mental column, it is no less difficult with respect to transverse sections. Under ordinary circumstances external impressions persist so that they can be transfixed by a deliberate act of attention, and objects rarely flit over the external scene so rapidly as to allow us no time for a careful recognition of the impression. Not so in the case of the internal region of mind. The composite states of consciousness just described never remain perfectly uniform for the shortest conceivable duration. They chainge continually, just as the contents of the kaleido- scope vary with every shake of the instrument. Thus one shade of feeling runs into another in such a way that it is often impossible to detect. its exact quality; and even whenl the character of the feeling does not change, its intensity is under- going alterations so that an accurate observation of its quantity 1 I need hardly observe that physiology shows that there is no separa- tion of different elementary colour-sensations which are locally identicaL</page><page sequence="12">12 Illusions of Introspection. is impracticable. Also, in this unstable shifting internal scene features miay appear for a duration too short to allow of close recognition. In this way it happens that we cannot sharply divide the feeling of the moment from its antecedents and its consequents. The full import of these considerations can only be seen when we reflect on what is involved in a process of recognition, ex- ternal and internal alike. It clearly involves first of all an act of attention, anid this requires time, since it takes place by mneans of a process of focussing(, or adaptation, discrirninative or selective. But aoain, this process of adaptation involves the bringing, of the particular feeling under the proper representa- tionl; for even an internal feeliing is intellectually cognised by means of a fusion of the represeiltation of a feelingr with the feeling itself. Now it is to be remembered that, when iii the attitude of attendinig and framino the necessary represeiltation, we neces- sarily pass out of this particular state of feeling which we were in before the process of recognition began. In other words, as observers of wlhat is going onl within us, we cannot be in the sam-ne meental condition as when not obserVing; there is a slight miodification of the contents of consciousiness whenever there is the direction of a deliberate attention to these contents. Frolmi all of wlhich follows that it must be very easy to overlook, colnfuse and transform, both as to quality anld as to quantity, the actual ingredients of our mental conidition. Hence there spring a number of small errors of introspection which, to distingruish thein fronm others to be spoken of presently, m-ay be called passive. These would include all errors in de- tectino what is in consciousness due to the intricacies of the phenomena, and not aided by any strong bias. For example, a melntal state may fail to disclose its component parts to intro- spective attelntion. In the chemistry of nmind results are often so blended as to become no longer distinguishable. Thus a motive miay enter into our action which is so entangled witlh other feelingrs as to escape attentioil. The fainter the feeling the greater the difficulty of detcching it and inspecting it ili isolation. Ag,ain, an error of introspection may have its groun(d in the fugitive character of a feeling. If, for example, a man is asked whetlher a rapid action was a voluntary one, he mnay easily in retrospection iimiagine that it was not so, when as a matter of fact the action was preceded by a momentary volition. Suclh tralnsitory feelings which cannot at the moment be seized by aln act of attention are pretty certain to disappear at once, leaving not eveni a tem-lporary trace in consciousness. It is to be observed tllat tllis confusing of elemiients of coIn- sciousness involves a species of error closely analogous to an</page><page sequence="13">illusions of Introspection. 13 illusion of perception which depends on a misinterpretation of a sense-impression. This is illustrated in the case in which a feeling or emotion is confounded with some inferenc,e based on it. In the more vulgar form of this error, there is an ' intui- tioIl' of something supposed to be immediately given in the feeling itself. For instance, a man whose mind is thrilled by the pulsation of a new joy exclaims 'This is the happiest moment of my life,' and this assurance seems to be contained in the very intensity of the feeling itself. Of course cool reflection will tell him that what he affirms is merely a belief the accuracy of which presupposes processes of recollection and judgment, but to the man's mind at the moment the supremacy of this particular joy is immediately intuited. And so with the assurance that the present feeling, for example of love, is undying, that it is equal to the most severe trials, and so on. A man is said to feel at the moment that it is so, though as the facts believed 1iave reference to absent circumstances and events it is plain that the knowledge i5 by no means intuitive. In this way our emotions in the moments of their greatest intensity carry away our intellects with them, and throw into confusion the region of truth and certainty and of pure imagina- tion, and even the narrow domain of the present and the vast domain of the past and future. At such moments differences of present and future may be said to disappear and the energy of the emotion to constitute an immediate assurance of its exist- ence absolutely.' We will niow pass to the consideration of other illusions of initrospection mnore analogous to the active illusions of perception. In an examination of these we find that a pure representationi nmay iinder certain circumstances simuLlate the appearance of a presentation, that a mental image may approximate to a sense- impression. In the case of the internal feelings this liability shows itself in a still more striking forn. The higher feelings or emotions are distinguished from the simple sense-feelings in being largely represenitative. Thus a feeling of contentment at any momefit, though no doubt conditioned by the bodily state and the character of the organic-sensations or ccenoesthesis, commonly depends for the most part on intellectual representa- tions of external circumstances or relations, and may be called an ideal foretaste of actual satisfactions, such as the pleasures of success, of companionship, and so on. This being so, it is easy for imagination to call up a semblance of these higher feelings. Since they depend largely on representation, a mere act of It is evident that when -the mind wrongly passes from a present feeling to something, remote in tinme, the error approaches to the class of illusions of belief.</page><page sequence="14">14 Illusions of Introspection. representation may suffice to excite a degree of this feeling hardly distinguishable from the aetual one. Thus to imagine myself as contented is really to see myself at the moment as actually contented. We should expect from all this that in the act of itntrospection the mind is apt, within certain limits, to find what it is prepared to find. And since there is in these acts often a distinct wish to find some particular feelinc, we can see how easy it must be for a man throurh bias anid a wrong focussing of his attention to deceive himself up to a certain point with respect to the actual contents of his mind. Let us look at one of these active illusions. It would at first sight seem to be a perfectly simple thing to determine at any given moment whether we are enjoying ourselves, whether our emotional condition rises above the pleasure-threshold or point of indifference and takes on a positive hue of the agreeable or pleasurable. Yet there is good reason for supposing that people not unfrequently deceive themselves on this matter. It is perhaps hardly an exaggeration to say that most of us are capable of imagining that we are havinc enjoyment when we conform to the temporary fashion of social amusement. It has been cynically observed that people go into society less in order to be happy than to seem so, and one may add that in this semblance of enjoyment they may, provided they are not blase's, deceive themselves as well as others. The expectation of enjoyment, the knowledge that the occasion is intended to bring about this result, the recognition of the external signs of elnjoy- ment in otlhers, all this may serve to blind a man in the earlier stages of social amusement to his actual mental condition. If we look closely into this variety of illusion, we shall see that it is very similar in its structure and origin to that kind of erroneous perception which arises from inattention to the actual impressioni of the moment under the influence of a strong expectation of something different. The representation of our- selves as entertained dislodges from our internal field of vision our actual condition, releg,ating this to the reg,ion of obscure consciousness. The essence of self-deception may be said to be the holding of a representation in the upper region of clear consciousness so as to cover from view something below it. Could we for a moment get rid of this representation and look at the real feelings of the tiiie, we should become awvare of our error; and it is possible that the process of becomingt blase' involves a waking up to a good deal of illusion of the kind. Just as we can thus deceive ourselves within certain limits as to our emotional condition so we Call mistake the real nature of our intellectual condition. Thus when an idea is particularly grateful to our minlds we may easily imagine that we believe it</page><page sequence="15">Illusions of Introspection. 1 5 when in point of fact all the time there is a subconscious process of criticism going on, which if we attended to it for a moment would amount to a distinct act of disbelief. The rationale of flattery, which is not ineffective even with really in- tellectual men, seems to be that it disposes the flattered person to indulge the pleasant half-illusion that the words are true, even when careful reflection must show that they are an ex- aggeration. That is to say, the flatterer's assertion calls up a vivid representation which for the moment simulates the form of a belief. It is plain that the external conditions of life impose on the individual certain habits of feeling, which often colnflict with his personal propensities. As a member of society he has a power- ful motive to attribute certain feeling,s to himself, and this motive acts as a bias in disturbing his vision of what is actually in his mind. While this holds good of lig,hter matters as that of enjoyment just referred to, it applies still more to graver matters. Thus, for example, a man may easily deceive himself that he feels a proper sentiment of indignation against a perpe- trator of some mean or cruel act, when as a matter of fact his feeling is much more the personal one of compassion for the previously-liked offender. In this way we impose on ourselves, disguising our real sentiments by a thin veil of make-believe. The great region of this kind of illusion is that of theX moral and religious life. With respect to our real motives, our domi- nant aspirations, and our highest emotional experiences, we are liable to deceive ourselves. The moralist and the theologian have clearly recogniised the possibilities of self-deception in matters of feeling, and impulse. To them it is no mystery that the human heart should mistake the fictitious for the real, the momentary and evanescent for the abiding. And they have recognised, too, the double source of these errors, in the powerful disposition to exaggerate a present feeling on the onle hand, and on the other hand to take a mere wish to feel in a particular way for the actual possession of the feeling,. Men of deep reli- gious natures and given to introspection and self-scrutiniy have again and again confessed to their weakness in separating the wlheat of sincere impulse from the tares of spurious sentiment. And the morbid melancholy to. which this habit of self-anatomy when indulged in to excess often leads sufficiently illustrates the uncertainties which characterise the process of moral self- anatomny. The opinion of theologians respecting the nature of moral introspection presents a singular contrast to that entertained by some pbilosophers as to the nature of self-consciou-ssness. It is supposed by many of these that in interrogating, their</page><page sequence="16">16 Illutsions of Introspection. internal c,onsciousness they are lifted above all risk of error. The 'deliverance of consciousness' is to them something bearing the seal of a supreme authority and must not be called in question. And so they make an appeal to individual con- sciousness a final resort in all matters of philosophical dispute. Now on the face of it, it does not seem probable that this operation should have an immunity from all liability to error. For the matters respecting which we are directed to introspect ourselves are the most subtle and complex things of our intel- lectual and emotional life. And some of these philosophers even go so far as to affirm that the plain man is quite e'qual to the niceties of this process. It has been brought as a charge against some of these same philosophers that they have based certain of their doctrines on errors of introspection. This charge must of course be received with some sort of suspicion here, since it has been brought for- ward by avowed disciples of another philosophic school. Never- theless as there is from our present disinterested and purely scientific point of view a presumption that philosophers like other men are fallible, and since it is certain that philosophical introspection does not materially differ from other kinds, it seems permissible just to glance at some of these alleged illusions in relation to other and more vulgar forms. These so-called philosophical illusions will be found like the vulgar ones just spokeii of to illustrate the distinction drawn ,between Passive and Active illusions. That is to say, the alleged mnisreading of individual consciousness would result now from a confusion of distinct elements, including wrong suggestion, now from a powerful predisposition to read something into the phenomena. A kind of illusion in which the passive element seems most conspicuous would be the error into which the interrogator of individual consciousness is said to fall respecting simple unana- lysable states of mind. On the face of it, it is not likely that a mere inward glance at the tangle of conscious states should suffice to determine what is such a perfectly simple mental phenomenon. A study of the limits of discrimination with respect to simultaneous sensations would lead us to expect-that the feelings and ideas which enter consciousness together must tend to blend inseparably in apparently simple states. Accord- ingly, -when a writer declares that an act of introspection demonstrates the simple inanalysable character of such a feeling, as the sentiment of beauty or that of moral approval, the opponent of this view clearly has some show of argument for saying that this simplicity may be altogether illusory. Similarly when it is said that the idea of space contains nio</page><page sequence="17">WVlhts'ons ofliospection. 17 rpresentations of mnuscular sensation, the sta,tement may clearly arise from an inability to analyse the idea.1 In most cases of these alleged philosophical errors, however, the active and passive factors seem to combine. There are cer- tain intricacies in the mental phenomenon itself favouring the chances of error,- and. there are independent predispositions leading the mind to look at the phenomenon in a wrong way. This seems to apply to the f-amous declaration of a certain school of thinkers that by an act of introspection we can intuite the fact of liberty, that is to say, a power of spontaneous determina- tion of action superior to and regulative of the influence of motives. It may be plausibly contended, that this idea arises partly from a mixing up of facts of present consciousness with v inferences from them, and partly from a natural predisposition of the mind to invest itself with this supreme power of absolute origination.2 In a similar way it might be contended that other famous philosophic dicta are founded on a process of erroneous introspec- tion of subjective mental states. In some cases indeed it seems- a plausible explanation to regard these illusions as mere survivals in attenuated shadowy form of grosser popular illusions. But space forbids my entering on these, which, moreover, hardly fall perhaps under our definition of an illusion of introspection. In drawing up this rough sketch of the Illusions of Introspec- .tion I have had. no practical object in -view. I have Fried to look at the facts as they are apart from any conclusions to be drawn from them. The question how far the liability to error in any region of inquiry vitiates the whole process is a difficult one; and the question whether the illusions to which we are subject in introspection materially affect the value of the introspective method in psychology, as many affirm, is too subtle a one to be treated now. It must suffice to say that I do not think it does any more than the risk of sense-ilsion can be said materially to affect the value of external observation. The obvious differ- ence is that in the latter we are face to face with a common object of inspection, whereas in introspection we are attending to what is individual and private. For -this reason individual 1 I find that after practice I recognise this ingredient much better than 'I did at first. And this exactly answers to Helmholtz's contention that elementary sensations as partial tones can be detected after practice. Such separate recognition involves correct representation. On tha. other hand it must be allowed that the intuitionist may say that the empiricist is here reading something into the idea which does not belong to it. 2 Imay as well be frank ancd say-that I myself, assuming free-will to be an illusion, have tried to trace the various threads of influence which have -ontributed to its remarkable vitality.

This is the characteristic difficulty of the introspec- tion method. Yet even our subjective experiences are found within certain limits to agree one with another, and in the mul- titude of observers there is an approach to objective certainty. And though it cannot be said that introspection has yet become a very perfect scientific instrument, it is to be remembered that it is a comparatively new acquirement of the race, which may be expected to gain in precision as evolution advances.
