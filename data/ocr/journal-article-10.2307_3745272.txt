<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE MARRIAGE OF UNIVERSALS (I) G. R. G. MURE, M.A. I ? i. The purpose of this paper is to inquire what distinction can~or should be drawn between logic on the one hand and on the other psy? chology, so far as psychology concerns itself specifically with the problem of knowledge.1 The suggestions I have to make are very pro? visional, and are based mainly on a criticism of the late Mr. Bradley's views of the nature and scope of logic and psychology. For this reason I have for my title adapted from Bradley's article on ' 'Association and Thought" a famous phrase which seems to me to illustrate fairly well the meeting-point of these two sciences in his thinking. At the same time this very criticism is itself chiefly founded upon philo? sophical considerations with which Bradley at least as much as any other writer has taught me to sympathize. In short, I assume some sort of Absolute Idealism; and my excuse must be the further assumption?which I hope the reader will more readily tolerate? that the proper criticism of any theory is that which it can be shown to pass upon itself in the course of its own development.2 ? 2. Yet before I venture to attack, or even to expound, Bradley, I propose to sketch briefly a far older theory of knowledge and reality; and my reason for so doing is that such absolutism as Bradley's, if it is not the inevitable outcome of this theory, at least rests largely in its debt. Plato and Aristotle held it, and perhaps no subsequent philosopher who confessed their influence upon his thought has denied in toto its truth. According to this theory, if you are seeking to know what anything really is, then, despite the seeming imper- fection of this poor world we live in, you will succeed so far only as you are able to define it in terms of its own perfection. To set this doctrine in a clearer light I will select one passage from Plato. When Socrates in the Republic is pressed to say whether the ideal state is possible, he hesitates to give an answer. And he hesitates because he realizes that the question is twofold. Glaucon burns to be assured that the ideal state can be actualized in practice, and is not a mere illusory day-dream, and, as we all know, he gets his answer. But 1 For a suggestion as to the ultimate value of this qualification, see ? 40 ff. * I am besides greatly indebted to Professor H. H. Joachim, who most kindly read this paper in manuscript, and made me valuable suggestions, and also to two articles by him which appeared in Mind, one on "Psychical Process" in 1909 and another on "Personal Identity" in 1914. 313</page><page sequence="2">JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHICAL STUDIES he does not get it until he has assented to a question which unlocks the whole philosophical significance of Plato's Republic Mp* olov ri rt Trpaxdrjval c&amp;s A c'yercu, ?) &lt;f&gt;vcrw ey^i upa^iv Xi^etos rjrrov aXrjOelas i(/)d7TT?a0ai, ko\v el \xjt] toj So/cet.1 Glaucon is next made to agree that Socrates need show the possi? bility in practice only of such a reformed state as will still be a mere approximation to the aXrjOeia of Xegis just because it will still be merely actual; and when Socrates proposes next to show "what is that chief fault in states which is the cause of their present mal- administration, and what is the least change which will enable a state to pass into the truer form," he is in fact answering a second and deeper meaning of Glaucon's question scarce realized by its author. In the passage I have quoted Socrates is not so much con? trasting the finitude of human effort with the ideal which inspires it: he is rather introducing Glaucon to the notion that the function of political philosophy is to analyse the structure of actual states by the light of that el8os or Form of state which alone gives them what reality they possess?that d8os which they are so far as they are real at all. In other words, he is telling Glaucon that in this sense the ideal state is not merely possible but real, and that if he wishes to win insight into the true nature of actual Greek civilization, then, even if his purpose is to reform it, he must yet first strive to define it in terms of its own perfection; for that is what it really is. ? 3. This theory is, of course, the germ of Aristotle's doctrine of the four causes. It is common to call it teleological, with the implication that it is an attempt to explain Reality in terms of purpose. It is urged that this attempt is metaphysically inadequate because Reality must be more than the fulfilling of a purpose, and that when employed as by Aristotle in the sphere of natural science, it is an erroneous anthropomorphic reading of final cause, even of conscious purpose, into the world of inanimate nature. But despite Aristotle's dictum that Nature makes nothing in vain, in Physics B. the function of the final cause in the development of natural sub? stances is not described in terms of conscious purpose. Generally speaking, the purposive or teleological aspect of this theory becomes prominent only so far as emphasis is laid on the actual imperfection of things, and for Aristotle himself things have a final cause only so far as they are ovvoXa, composites that fall short of real unity because they exhibit a moment of mere potentiality. He teaches that it is just so far as its formal and final cause fail to coalesce that a thing is unreal and undefinable. Thus, as held by Aristotle at any rate, the theory is primarily one of formal causes; for the formal cause is the logical prius of the final, or in other words Reality is the presupposi? tion of its own apparent diremption into a formal and a final cause 1 Republic, 473a. 314</page><page sequence="3">THE MARRIAGE OF UNIVERSALS which do not coalesce. And if Plato held a different view, it is strange that he is even criticized by Aristotle in the First Book of the Metaphysics for neglecting altogether the final cause. ?4. Hence we may avoid any question whether the discrepancy between something actually imperfect and that thing's own real nature need be expressed in every sphere in terms of unfulfilled purpose, and so far, perhaps, the theory has not been shown meta- physically unsound; but it still remains to discuss how far it can be applied within the abstract special sciences, among which Bradley numbers both psychology and logic. Bradley himself says of the special or limited sciences, "A limited science is not in principle made what it is by having a compartment to itself, but by studying whatever it studies with a limited end and in a limited way. If you ask, for instance, unconditionally what are matter and force, that is a question for metaphysics. It becomes a question for physics if you ask what they are for a certain limited purpose and in a certain limited sense."1 This means, I take it, that one limited science differs from another according to the degree and kind of abstraction characterizing the category it employs. Our problem then is, "Does the abstraction which delimits it render inapplicable in any or every special science definition in terms of perfection as this was explained above?" Mathematics we may ignore lest we be tempted to prove too much, and it is to psychology that we shall have shortly to apply our results. We will confine ourselves therefore to the unequivocally physical sciences. ? 5. Now I have no desire to preach any a priori hierarchy of the special sciences, but it is yet true that a special science uses an abstract category only because it cannot systematize its facts in terms of one more concrete?or rather, wherever a special science comes to be, one cause of its genesis is the failure to express reality in more concrete terms. The barer your scheme of identity in difference the more easily, because the more loosely, it will fit the facts. And some system to fit the facts you must find. Of course you must pay in loss of truth the price of your abstraction, and if you afterwards forget that you have made it, you will pay doubly; but if you refuse alto? gether to make it you will have no facts left at all. On the other hand, your conclusions will inevitably be identical in kind with your premisses. If as a physicist you go for help to mathematics to explain the energy of your ions, mathematics will have only an equation to offer you. If to supplement the failure of your physio? logical insight you appeal to the chemist, he will display to you the interaction of a peculiar group of chemical compounds: that this has any relation to that higher organic type of unity which is your special business is a fact of which he can take no account, for the category A Defence of Phenomenalism in Psychology, p. 33; Mind, 1890. 315</page><page sequence="4">JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHICAL STUDIES he employs has turned the object of that investigation which he is undertaking on your behalf from an organism into a purely chemical compound. ? 6. At this point I have an obvious objection to meet. "How, then," it will be said, "do you account for the many conspicuous suc? cesses which special science has won by precisely this appeal to a more abstract category? How could an astronomer predict the advent of a comet without recourse to algebra? What use could the doctor make of drugs if he had been taught a physiology pure of any chemical knowledge ?" I reply that so far as the success referred to is practical, prediction of its behaviour is not necessarily based on knowledge of the true nature of the subject of prophecy. As Plato long ago dis? covered, the heavenly body is to the mathematical astronomer no more than the perceptible triangle is to the geometer. The laws of that chemical compound which we may at will substitute for the organism are for practical purposes a highly useful object of study; but they do not teil us what an organism is, for an organism is?pre? cisely not a chemical compound. And that brings me to the second part of my reply. If the success meant is success in knowing, if it is meant that a physiologist becomes a better physiologist as the result of his attempt to work out his problem in chemical terms, then I answer that I am misunderstood if I am taken to hold that the categories which delimit the several special sciences have a merely negative relation to one another. The higher category neces? sarily contains the lower as a moment transcended within it. The physiologist must know what a chemical compound is or fail to grasp the nature of an organism; but if he interpolate chemical explanations in his physiological theory of the organism, let him remember that these serve only to mark agap; and if he successfully predict phenomena on the basis of his chemical knowledge, let him not forget that the phenomena which answer his prediction, like all other phenomena, are so far only as they are intelligible, and that they are consequently just what the chemical premisses of his infer? ence have made them, namely, the chemical effects of chemical causes. To say that they are phenomena exhibited by an organism adds nothing but a bare fact, a statement of the problem yet to solve. Give me enough arsenic and I shall die; give me a drug when I am sick and I may recover; but of health, disease, and death, so far as these belong to the essential nature of an organism, you will not for that have learnt one whit the more. ? 7. Bosanquet, whose close kinship with Bradley's thought makes quotation from him apt, writes1: "An impartial science dealing with very general forms of behaviour?we might take chemistry as an example?will give a more complete account of objects in which those * "The Relation of Sociology to Philosophy," Mind, 1897. 316</page><page sequence="5">THE MARRIAGE OF UNIVERSALS forms of behaviour are presented per se than of those in which they assume complications subservient to some further type of unity. Chemistry can say something of all material substances; but it can say less, in proportion, of those which have biological significance." Bosanquet would seem to admit as much and even more than that for which I have contended. ? 8. From what may seem a digression let us return to our question of definition by perfection. It is clear now that if any special science employs any such standard and criterion, this criterion will be one that falls within the abstraction that delimits the science. Does the physiologist employ such a criterion? I think it is clear that he does. The body, alive or dead, concerns him only so far as it exhibits approximation to the perfectly healthy human organism. It is this which at once guides his analysis and is revealed by it. Health is the criterion alike of itself and of ill health and disease. ? 9. If we turn to consider the more abstract special sciences we shall expect by now to find that they make of their object a barer, more merely schematic, unity of differences. And accordingly we find those learned in them talking of phenomena, the laws of their coexist? ence and sequence. They may even tell us that the function of science is to describe and not to explain. Evidently to them Reality exhibits but a shadow of itself; their reach is wide; as they abstract more and more, perhaps wide as the world at its widest. But their grip is loose, and they hold in their hands an abstract moment, a pale wraith of the real. Have they then a criterion of perfection ? Clearly not one to be expressed in terms of purpose or function, nothing with any trace of self-subsistent value, but yet I think a faint re? flection, or, better perhaps, a dim anticipation of these. The chemist does not suggest that one instance of a chemical compound approxi- mates more nearly to an ideal than another; and the physicist has never seen one solar system of ions to compare it with another. In fact, in physics the pretence of substantial existence, already mori- bund in chemistry, has given way to the systematic connection of universal and hypothetical characters within a reality which is to the physicist a mere postulate. Yet this mere postulate is not nothing. Though the physicist be one of those men of science who suppose themselves merely to describe phenomena, still he would never frame a working hypothesis if he had no criterion to apply. Some sort of ordered system he must assume before there are facts for him to analyse, and his analysis can yield him nothing that can have any meaning to him save the revelation of an ordered system. And facts, even shorn of their awkward angularities as his initial abstraction has sheared them, have not yet met the physicist's demand in full. If they had there would be no more physics. ? 10. It would be interesting to pursue the argument into mathe- 317</page><page sequence="6">JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHICAL STUDIES matics, but it is time we approached nearer to the centre of our sub? ject. For the same reason I have avoided any discussion of the negative aspect of the theory I have upheld. I will only remark before I turn directly to Bradley, that just as in the more concrete realms of Ethics, Logic, and iEsthetic we find evil and error and ugliness at once essential and hardly reconcilable factors in our problem, so this same negative element, at once the curse and the mainspring of all that is, lurks inevitably in the most abstract spheres of science; and if its presence gives little trouble to those that dwell in them, that is because it is but a shadow among shadows, because it finds so little there to make or mar. II ? ii. Bradley's psychology is to the philosophical public far less familiar than his logic and his metaphysics. Yet it was a subject in which he took great interest. Though he was not a great accumulator of books, yet at his death, if I recollect aright, a good half of those he possessed consisted of psychological works. Certainly in the more modern portion of his library there was a large preponderance of psychological literature. He did not, however, republish in book form the numerous psychological articles, mainly written for Mind, which embody his views. Because of their comparative unfamiliarity, therefore, I shall quote at some length from his psychological writings, but assume that his logic and metaphysics are well known to us all. ? 12. Bradley throughout his life held that logic and psychology are special sciences, and always he is concerned to prevent either from invading the other's territories, and both from encroaching upon metaphysics. It is the value of those distinctions that I propose now to discuss. ? 13. The method and assumptions by which Bradley would charac? terize psychology may be briefly set down as follows. In "_4 Defence of Phenomenalism in Psychology," Mind, 1890, he writes: "That phenomenalism is the one rational attitude in psychology I am as convinced as I am convinced that in metaphysics it is senseless. And phenomenalism I may here provisionally define as the confine? ment of one's attention to events with their laws of coexistence and sequence. It involves the complete abjuration of any attempt to ask in psychology for ultimate truth or consistency, and it involves the adoption as relative truth of whatever serves best to explain the detailed course of facts or those particular ways in which things happen." Three years before, in Association and Thought he had said: "The facts immediately experienced within a single organism l 1 But see Appearance and Reality, p. 299, footnote. 318</page><page sequence="7">THE MARRIAGE OF UNIVERSALS or soul, and those facts regarded merely as events which happen, make the object of psychology." A definition of soul given here in a footnote he restates in Appearance and Reality1 thus: "The soul is a finite centre of immediate experience, possessed of a certain temporal continuity of existence, and again of a certain identity in character" {i.e., ashe explains in Association and Thought, neither a mere series of states nor something outside phenomena). "And," he continues, "the word 'immediate' is emphatic. The soul is a par? ticular group of psychical events, so far as these events are taken merely as happening in time. It excludes consideration of their content, so far as this content (whether in thought or volition or feeling) qualifies something beyond the serial existence of these events." ? 14. Now it is the status of content as thought with which we are concerned, and it is on the basis of a distinction between two senses of the term 'idea' that Bradley divides logic from psychology. His original distinction in the first edition of the Logic (1883) was between idea as psychical fact, further defined as mental image, and idea as meaning, as universal content referred to Reality, i.e., predicated in judgment as qualifying Reality. Idea as meaning was a part of the mental image cut off (somehow universalized by mutilation), and was related to the mental image as symbolized to symbol. ? 15. I need not dwell on the obvious objections to this theory. It appears to imply that fact and meaning, symbol and symbolized, both go to constitute the content of judgment. And that view is only plausible if we forget that once an image as psychical fact enters into the content of judgment it becomes eo ipso a part of the object of judgment; it is no longer the symbol, but has become the sym? bolized; it requires in order to be known a further psychical image, and so, I suppose, ad infinitum. In Mind, 1908, Bradley modified this doctrine, but with some impatience and rather as one striving to make his theory fool-proof than radically altering it. He there admits that though every idea has its own existence as a fact, yet it is essential for the logician to ignore or discount this side of 'idea/ and the recognized individual existence of the idea as sign may be absent in judgment. 'May be absent' is not very reassuring, for it seems to imply that its presence or absence makes no difference in principle; but it must be remembered that to say that image as psychical fact may enter into the content of judgment is not the same as to say that the psychologist, judging for himself, is entitled to treat knowledge as a process of psychical events. It is the latter and not the former contention upon which Bradley's psychology depends for its status, and if he sometimes blurs the distinction, we can treat the confusion as irrelevant to his main position. Whether * P. 298. 319</page><page sequence="8">JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHICAL STUDIES thought can be profitably treated as in any sense psychical process we have yet to decide, and we may now proceed to examine further what Bradley has to say of idea as psychical fact for the psychologist. ? 16. We learn from Association and Thought that though Bradley agrees with "the English school at its best,"1 yet Atomism as a view of the nature of psychical elements must go wholly. "We must get rid," he says, "of the idea that our mind is a train of perishing existences, that so long as they exist have separable being, and, so to speak, are coupled up by another sort of thing which we call relations. If we turn to what is given this is not what we find, but rather a continuous mass of presentation in which the separation of a single element from all context is never observed, and where, if I may use the expression, no one ever saw a carriage, and still less a coupling, divided from the train. . . . Hence the Atomism must go wholly, and the 'associative links' must be connections of con? tent, not conjunctions of existences; in other words, Association marries only universals." This passage might seem hardly consonant with Bradley's statement at the beginning of the article that the soul is a totality of immediate experience, and that the term 'imme? diate' excludes phenomena so far as their content is used beyond their existence. Perhaps with this seeming contradiction in view Bradley proceeds: "I do not, of course, mean that bare universals are psychical facts. These connections in strictness are not facts at all, although at times it may be convenient to call them so. An actual fact works so or so because of such or such a connection when its content has one of the features connected; and it is then a case or instance of the law." ? 17. The account in this last passage of how the marriage of uni? versals is psychologically significant I find obscure, but a quotation from the Defence of Phenomenalism'2' may illuminate it: "To say that ideas and judgements do not happen at a certain time, and that in this sense they fail to be occurrences, seems clearly contrary to fact. And again, it would surely be once more contrary to fact to say that, when they happen (since they do happen) they are not also felt to happen in the soul and are not experienced as my states. But so far clearly they are events. The reality to which the ideal content is referred, that ideal content and its reference? everything in short is present in my feeling. Everything is thus so far an event which has a place in my history and is predicable of me. That which is not so predicable is the mere connection of the 1 English empirical philosophy has never clearly distinguished logic from psychology, and it is ominous that Bradley should adopt as adequately characterizing thought at one level of explanation some of the main features of a theory whereby two levels are perpetually confounded. a P. 30. 320</page><page sequence="9">THE MARRIAGE OF UNIVERSALS ideal content with the reality, so far as that connection is taken by itself, and so far as abstraction is made of any other aspect." "Certainly," he continues, "I agree that, so far as this abstraction is maintained, we have not to do with an event in my soul, but I add also that we have to do with something which falls outside of psychology"?falls presumably within logic. And later on he says: "The Deity is not a mere event, of course, and of course the Deity is really present in the mind that makes it an object, and it is really present not as an event, and it really exercises in this non-temporal character psychological influence. This is all true, and yet it does not prevent something else from also being true. The presence in the soul of what is more than an event is certainly an event in that soul, and it is just because it is more than an event that in this case it is also more of an event in the history of that soul. And it is from this side of event that psychology has to do with the matter in its origin, and in its content so far as that qualifies the soul and also influences its future history."1 Here perhaps some light is shed on the dark passage above. The bare universals and their reference to reality taken in isolation fall within the province of logic. Yet these connections determine the working of psychical facts, and they are able to do so because the facts possess in their content one of the features connected. When the facts thus determined work, then their working is an instance of the law of association, i.e., then universals celebrate their wedding. ? 18. The upshot of this seems to be that the process of psychical events threatens to become nothing but the family history of universals. We were told that psychical fact is experienced imme? diately, without divorce of content from existence; yet now it seems that only so far as married universals mediate it can anything at all be said about it. The same position is retained in Appearance and Reality, p. 302: "The soul is not the contents which appear in its states, but, on the other hand, without them it would not be itself. For it is qualified essentially by the presence of these con? tents. Thus a man, we may say, is not what he thinks of; and yet he is the man he is, because of what he thinks of. And the ideal processes of the content have necessarily an aspect of psychical change. These connections, which have nothing which is personal 1 Cp., however, Principles of Logic, Ed. II, p. 613, where Bradley seems to confine psychology more strictly: "If we take as an instance the phenomena of the religious consciousness, the psychologist must not neglect them. But he studies their nature taken merely as a kind of occurrence in the soul, with their influence on the course of psychical events. And as to the reality other? wise and as to the worth [italics mine] of these phenomena psychology is silent. With the question whether, and how far really, its mental fact is also the vital presence of an eternal God, it can have no concern." If this is not neglect of the religious consciousness, what is ? 331</page><page sequence="10">JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHICAL STUDIES to myself, cause a sequence of my states when they happen within me." We need not pause to inquire how the changing states of the soul can be both an aspect and an effect of an ideal process of content, or whether two terms related as cause and effect can be treated respectively by separate special sciences, but we are, I think, entitled to ask what is, or what has, the soul over and above these contents as they appear in its states ? And the answer seems to be, nothing. ? 19. To enforce this conclusion let me quote a passage from Asso? ciation and Thoughtx which seems to illustrate particularly well the straits to which a phenomenalist psychology may be reduced in the effort to conceal the cloven hoof of logical content. "Association," writes Bradley, "can be reduced to the struggle of each element towards an independent totality by means of sameness in content, and . . . this principle works by coalescence where the conditions are given, and, again, by redintegration made through the establishment of connections superior to time." And then, as if in fear lest this admission of timeless connections of content might seem a violation by logic of the psychological sanctum, he draws a distinction which appears to be an open juera/tacri? els a'AAo yevos. "And if we like to call the movement an ideal process, this may distinguish it from what is by comparison mechanical, the basis upon which alone it exists and to which it has to suit itself." He goes on to speak of 'this machinery' (the machinery of the comparatively mechanical process) as the incoming of fresh and the disappearance of old sensations, and he says: "We see here the conditions of another kind of struggle, a struggle for existence among actual facts, alongside of the former struggle through identity, but crossing it at times and blending with it inextricably. In this more mechanical conflict what favours individuals? We must mention first habit, aptitudes produced by repetition, or got by heredity, or again in some way not known. Elements suited to these . . . tend to dominate. Where those aptitudes depend on ideal connections they are instances of association" {i.e., I suppose, they belong to the ideal process), "but where or so far as there is no psychical revival, this is not the case. I think that psychology must accept this fact as an ultimate. ..." I cannot myself interpret this "inextricably blending" ideal process as anything but the scarce disguised entry of logic upon the scene, nor can I think that, if psychology must accept the fact as ultimate, it must do so for any other reason than to save a scandal. ? 20. So far we have seen psychical process of events vanish into development of logical content, but there is a factor in the problem which I have hitherto ignored. Bradley tends to use the terms 'fact* and 'event' without discrimination, but in defining the soul he speaks 1 P. 361. 322</page><page sequence="11">THE MARRIAGE OF UNIVERSALS of those facts which comprise it as immediately experienced, and for Bradley immediate experience means feeling. Now I am not con? vinced that the identification of fact and event is legitimate, and I would suggest that Bradley has 'inextricably blended' a fresh differentia of the subject of psychology with his definition of it as process of psychical events?that if you press his identification of fact with feeling, the distinction between psychology and logic turns out to be that for the former experience is sheerly immediate, whereas for the latter it is mere mediation. But clearly no science, whether called psychology or not, could deal with experience as sheerly immediate: sheerly immediate experience, if it is anything at all, is simply ineffable. What really happens, I think, is that Bradley admits mediation, and then, to prevent psychology from turning into logic, calls mediation phenomenal process. If I am right, Bradley's psychology proves to be an account of experience as the mediation of immediate feeling. But I would add that, though we shall find later some difficulty in answering the question whether Bradley consistently confines logic to mere mediation, yet so far as he does so the converse emphasis which he lays in psychology upon immediacy seems to mark a contrast not between two logically complementary moments?immediacy and mediation?but one between (a) experience as the adjective of a single individual mind or soul (something felt and personal), and (b) experience as a body of, as it were, public truth, a whole of universal and necessary con? nections would have nothing that is personal to a self. ? 21. I have as yet ventured no suggestion as to what psychology ought to be, but to avoid confusing criticism and construction I will first try to deal very briefly with Bradley's logic, and in order to make my treatment of it clearer I will prophesy that we shall find Bradley struggling to confine logic to merely mediate impersonal knowledge, but failing to do so. We shall find the excluded moment of imme? diacy refusing to be expelled, and even the ghost of psychical process will return again to haunt us. (To be continued.) 323</page></plain_text>
