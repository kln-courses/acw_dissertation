Motion and Recipe-guided Action IN the same article in which Richard Gale purports to lay once more to rest the ghost of Zeno's Racecourse, he curiously states in passing the very principle which, we shall see, makes Zeno's conclusion as to the impossibility of motion inescapable : "what? ever occurs requires a finite time in which to occur."1 Gale assumes that any defense of the Racecourse argument against motion imposes on the runner (or any stand-in, animate or in animate) the absurdity of a finite-stepped "recipe-guided action" of an infinite number of steps. His objection to the Racecourse is that the runner can move over a finite distance, and thus over an infinity of ever decreasing (e.g. halved) subdistances, without having to perform the absurdly infinite-stepped recipe-guided action of, in the first step, moving through half the distance, in the second step traversing half the remaining distance, and so on to infinity. We may rather allow the runner to perform a/&amp;Hte-stepped recipe-guided action : e.g. first he puts his leg forward, second the left leg, then the right again until after a finite number of steps the distance is crossed. And, as far as the motion of an inanimate object is concerned, if we are not misled into modeling it anthropomorphically on any sort of recipe-guided human performance, even the illusion of an infinite-stepped task cannot arise. It is of course true that the classical version of Zeno's argument formulates the task of motion as an infinite-stepped and thus non-completable recipe guided action. But that formulation, it seems to me, has more to do with the mystical envelopment of the argument than with its rational kernel. It is perhaps high time to demythologize Zeno. The challenge of the Racecourse, I shall argue, ultimately has nothing to do with the problem of an infinite series of acts of successively halving a finite distance, but only with the fact that there is an infinite number of positions occupied by the continously moving object between the points of departure and of arrival. It is frequently objected by Zeno's critics that his insistence that motion between two points requires the performance of an infinite number of submotions rests on an ambiguity. Zeno's argument succeeds only if the requirement that the object moving from A to B first move half the distance, which in turn requires motion over an eighth the distance and so on to infinity, is understood to mean that each of the infinitely numerous motions is, in the language of Gregory Vlastos, "physically individuated."2 Each motion through one of the infinitely numerous intervals between A and B might be physically individuated by a break or pause. If this is what is meant then, Zeno's critics admit, motion would be truly impossible. As Russell notes, continuing motion between A and B would indeed be impossible if the moving object has to count or otherwise signal each achievement of having attained half the distance still remaining to the goal.3 But Zeno's critics reject this interpretation of the requirement. If continuous motion depends on the accomplishment of an infinite number of submotions, this accomplishment must not be modeled on recipe-guided, finite stepped human action. It may be supposed, Zeno's critics maintain, that the infinite submotions into which any motion can be broken down are not physically individuated in this way. What is physically individuated are rather, Gale points out, the finitely numerous steps of first putting one's right leg forward, then one's left leg, and so on. II. Impossibility of Instantaneous Events I wish to reply to the critics on Zeno's behalf that, although continuous motion does not require an anthropomorphic view of the moving object as a human performer of recipe-guided tasks, there is another compelling reason why motion between any two points requires an infinitely extended and thus uncompletable duration of time. Continuous motion is impossible not merely if it breaks down into an 131 1 Richard Gale, "Has the Present Any Duration?," Nous, vol. 5 (1971), p. 39. 2 Gregory Vlastos, "Zeno of Elea," Encylopaedia of Philosophy, vol.

My defense of Zeno rests on the fundamental claim that a necessary condition of the possibility of any entity being in some state or other is that the entity pause at least momentarily in that state. What I am claiming here is, stated otherwise, that there is a self-contradic? tion in the supposition that an entity might be in a state and yet be in it only instantaneously, where an "instant" is distinguished from a "moment" in that it is a durationless limit of a duration. Just as a mathematical point limits a line segment but itself has no length, so an instant limits a duration without itself having any duration. Thus it is an instant, not a moment, which separates AM and PM in any given night. What I am saying is that it cannot possibly be true, for example, that you were happy yesterday but that this happy state obtained merely for an instant. For to say that you were happy but for an instant, let say between AM and PM, amounts to saying that you were not happy at all. For analogous reasons, it is a contradiction to hold that a body existed at a certain place and yet existed at that place for no more than an instant. For to say that the body existed at a place for only an instant is to say that it did not exist there at all. For a body ever to be in a place it must pause at least momentarily in the occupation of that place. It is clear how this assumption is destructive of the possibility of continuous motion. Between any two points A and B there is an infinite number of positions in which a moving object must at different instants be if its motion between the two points is to be possible. But if it is at any of those positions, it must be there for some finite duration, however brief. However, an infinite number of equal finite durations, be those durations ever so brief, is an infinite and thus uncompletable duration. It might be objected, however, that the contradic? tion between continuous motion and the moving object's pausing at each position along the line of motion could be interpreted as a reduction to the absurd of the moving object's momentary pause at each position, seeing that the assumption of such a pause leads to the absurdity of denying continuous motion. The contradiction between continuous mo? tion and an assumed pause of the moving object at each position thus would serve to establish the possibility and indeed necessity of instantaneous events, e.g. of the moving object being at the position without existing there for any duration. If I wish to refute the possibility of continuous motion, I must therefore show the impossibility of instantaneous events. To say that to have been on Mars merely for an instant, e.g. between PM and AM one night, is not to have been there at all certainly follows from and illustrates the principle that instantaneous events are impossible, but it does not prove it. Or, rather, it is no proof unless I wish to build an inductive argument for the principle. But that there are no instantaneous events to me to be a necessary truth. The impossibility of an instantaneous event or state is, I suggest, a consequence of the very meaning of an "event." If an individual says he was on the moon, we feel entitled to ask him "for how long?" Was it a month, a day, an hour? If the reply is that he was on the moon for no time at all, we feel we are entitled by the usual concept of what it is to be in a place to reply that he was not on the moon at all. It is part of the meaning of "being in a place" that whatever is in a place is there for some duration. The possibility of instantaneous occupation of a place contradicts our concept of what it is to be in a place. It follows that, if continuous motion requires instantaneous occupa? tion of any place, the possibility of such motion is excluded by our concept of being in a place. The contradiction between the occurrence of continuous motion and the supposition of a pause made by moving objects at each point along the line of motion thus cannot be interpreted as a reduction to the absurd of such a pause. To be at a place merely for an instant is a contradiction in terms and thus is indeed absurd, while there is nothing contradictory about the non-occurrence of continuous motion. At this point a critic might try challenging my assumption that between any two points there is an infinity of positions in which a moving body must successively be if motion is possible. It may be objected that a moving object passes through a series of infinitely numerous positions without ever, in so doing, being in any of those positions, i.e. without the event of being-at-a-place-along-the-line-of-motion ever occurring. But this objection would depend on the general possibility of an entity passing through a state without ever being in the state at all. Can one's skin pass through the state of being tanned to a particular degree without ever being tanned precisely to that degree? Can a driver go through a red light without, in so doing, ever being anywhere in relation to the light ? Can a runner cross the finish line without his point of furthest advance ever touching the finish line's most forward extremity? We have seen that if motion requires a body to occupy in succession infinitely numerous positions, it is impossible. But I think we can also see that, if motion requires the body to go through a series of infinitely numerous positions</page><page sequence="3">MOTION AND OBJECTIVE CONTRADICTIONS 133 without ever being in any of the positions, it is equally impossible. To pass through infinitely numerous states without ever being in any of those states is no more possible than to pass through them pausing momen? tarily in the exhibition of each state. III. Russell on the Arrow It may be seen that our basic claim is as destructive of Russell's refutation of Zeno's Arrow as it is of refutations of the Racecourse. Russell was in the habit of defining motion as being in different places at different times.4 He introduced the definition to circumvent Zero's Arrow. At any given instant in the course of alleged motion the arrow is at only one place. In order to avoid the inference that, since the arrow is at no instant in more than one place, it is never in a "state" of motion, Russell suggested that motion depended not merely on where the arrow was at a single instant, but also on where it was at other instants. If the arrow is in different places at different instants, it moves even if, indeed precisely because, it is merely in the place it is at any one instant. But Russell's definition of motion can be shown, on the basis of the fundamental claim already mentioned, to make continuous motion as impossible as Zeno could have wished. For if motion is occupation of different places at different instants, and if a moving object cannot occupy a place for a mere instant on pain of not occupying that place at all, the object cannot be in a given place at a given instant unless it is also in that place at other instants. And from this it follows that the moving object self-contradictorally is non moving on Russell's own definitions. Russell defines rest as remaining in the same place at different times (instants), i.e., through a duration. Because the moving object to be at any point must be there for some finite duration, the object in motion is at once not in motion. IV. Impossibility of Continuous Change Yet it must be granted that the same fundamental claim which permits us to conclude to the impossibility of motion equally leads to the conclusion that all continuous change is impossible. Consider, for ex? ample, the supposed continuous change of the sky and dusk from light to darkness. If the change is continuous, there is an infinity of actual shades of relative light or darkness through which the sky must pass between noon and midnight. But if the visual sky must enjoy a shade of lightness or darkness at least momentarily to enjoy it at all, there will not be enough time between noon and midnight for it to enjoy at different times infinitely numerous different shades, and thus not enough time for the continuous qualitative change we are considering to occur. The fundamental claim might be rephrased thus: merely instantaneous instantiation is logically impos? sible whenever the instance is an individual entity. The instant dividing AM and PM can instantiate this defining property only because it is an abstract, non individual entity. It is not an empirically individuated concrete event. It is only a concrete individual, such as the visual sky or physical body, which must pause momentarily, i.e., for some finite duration, in the possession of whatever property it has. V. The Theoretical Cost of Salvaging Motion Aristotle thought that motion was possible despite Zeno because just as a finite distance is divided into infinitely numerous points so a finite duration is similarly divisible into infinitely numerous instants, so that for every point of a moving object's furthest progress along a line there is a corresponding instant in which the object may reach that point of furthest progress.5 But the negative bearing of the fundamen? tal claim of the present paper on this objection is clear. The idea of a one-to-one correspondence between the different points of furthest progress and instants in the period of motion is inadmissable. The claim is that the instants in this period must rather stand in relation of many-to-one correspondence with the points of furthest progress. But the critic might give a slightly novel twist to his objection by noting, not that a finite duration contains infinitely numerous instants, but rather that it embraces infinitely numerous subdurations. Thus an hour contains within it a half hour, a quarter hour, an eighth of an hour, and so on to infinity. And it might be objected that, although no two-way one to-one correspondence can be established between points of furthest advance along a line and instants within a duration, such correspondence might be established between the infinitely numerous points of furthest advance and the equally numerous subdur? ations within the total duration of the motion. And then the moving object might be supposed to pause for some subduration at each point of furthest advance. 4 Bertrand Russell, Mysticism and Logic (London, 1918), pp. 79-80. 5 Aristotle, Physics, Bk. VI, Ch. 2 (233a &amp; b).</page><page sequence="4">134 AMERICAN PHILOSOPHICAL QUARTERLY What we mean, however, in attributing an infinite number of subdurations to any total duration is that, no matter how great the finite number of subdurations specified within the total duration, it is logically possible to specify yet another such subduration. Each subduration is finite. We do not mean to say that there is any infinitely small subduration. The reason why there is no infinitely small subduration is analogous to the reason why there is no natural number which is infinite even though the number of natural numbers is infinite. Just as natural numbers are each finite although their number is not, so every subduration within the series of subdurations con? tained in a given total duration is finitely small though the series of such subdurations is infinite. Thus if we set up a one-to-one correspondence between points of furthest progress along the line of motion and the infinitely numerous subdurations within a finite duration of motion, each subduration to which a unique point is set in correspondence will be a finite duration. Now if an infinite number of finite durations were always an infinite duration of time, the observation that a duration contains infinitely numerous subdur? ations would be of little help to Zeno's critics. But if a finite duration contains infinitely numerous subdur? ations, it is simply false that an infinite number of finite durations is always an infinite duration of time. Any rule for dividing a finite duration into an infinite number of subdurations will, it seems, provide for a series of ever smaller finite subdurations. Usually, an infinite number of finite quantities yields, through the summation of all those quantities, an infinite quantity. But the sum of infinitely numerous finite quantities arranged in an ever decreasing series poses an exception to this rule. For the following summation is finite : * + * + * + ... This means that it is possible to put the infinitely numerous positions along the line of motion in one to-one correspondence with the infinitely numerous but ever decreasing subdurations in the total duration of the motion, so that each position of the moving object is associated with a single finitely small subduration, and so that the sum of the infinitely numerous subdurations is finite. The fact that each position is associated with a single finitely small subduration permits the moving object actually at some time to be in that position, and the fact that the sum of the infinitely numerous subdurations is finite permits the total motion to be completed in a finite duration of time. Thus reflection on the fact that not every sum of infinitely numerous finite quantities yields an infinite quantity may be thought to provide a means of escape from the argument against the possibility of motion. It should be clear that, in pointing out the possiblity of one-to-one correspondence between positions on the line of motion and decreasing subdurations in the total duration of the motion, what I am saying is essentially different from the Aristotelean point, made in support of continuous motion, that the duration of motion between two points is as infinitely divisible as the segment between those points, so that the moving object has half the duration to travel half the segment, a quarter the duration to travel a quarter the segment, and so on. Aristotle tried to refute Zeno by noting that time is as infinitely divisible as space. The problem with this Aristotelean defense of continuous motion, however, is, as Pierre Bayle points out,6 that in a quarter of the distance there is an infinite number of positions for the moving object successively to occupy. Since to be in all those positions it must be in each for some finite duration, it is clear that the distance cannot be traversed. For an infinite number of the same finite duration, however small, is an infinite amount of time. The only case where an infinite number of finite durations is not an infinite duration is if the series of finite durations is convergent. Each member of the conver? gent series could then specify not, as in Aristotle's refutation of Zeno, the time required for the object to move a fraction of the total distance, but rather the time during which the object would occupy a given place along the line of motion. The Aristotlean reply to Bayle is of course that he erroneously assumes an actual as opposed to merely potential infinity of points along the line of motion. For Aristotle the line is infinitely divisible, but never infinitely divided. No matter how many times a line segment has been bisected it can always be bisected again, but even so there will never be an actually infinite number of dissections. And if points along the segment are each a mental construct constituted by a more or less great number of dissections, it is clear that the line never contains more than a finite number of points. A point would thus be understood as a limit of an actually defined or abstracted segment or subsegment. In this sense it becomes possible to speak of "the next point" after a given point. But the Cantorian method of defining an actual infinity of 6 Pierre Bayle, Historical and Critical Dictionary : Selections, trans, and introduced by Richard Popkin (Indianapolis, 1965), pp. 354-357.</page><page sequence="5">MOTION AND OBJECTIVE CONTRADICTIONS I35 points without having to enumerate each point consists precisely in the denial that given any point there is a next point. Cantor's vindication of actual infinity gives new life to Bayle's defense of Zeno against Aristotle : " ... motion has the same property as division. It touches one part of space without touching the other and touches them all one after the other. Is this not actually to divide them?"7 The moving object, merely by being successively in an infinite number of positions divides the total distance into an actual infinity of subsegments without any anthropomorphic assumption that the object is performing an infinite series of physically individ? uated actions of division. But because to be in a position is to pause at least momentarily in that position, the actual infinity of positions which any moving object must occupy spells the actual impos? sibility of motion. What this means is that the only way to preserve continous motion is to assign unequal subdurations each to a different position of the moving object. We may assume, for example, that the subduration during which the moving object is half the distance to the goal is twice the subduration during which the object is three-fourths the distance. The only way we can get infinitely numerous subdurations within a finite total duration is if the subdurations are arrangeable in an ever-decreasing series. If we then place the infinitely numerous points of furthest progress along the line of motion in a one-to-one correspondence with our infinitely numerous subdurations, the subduration for which the object is at one point of furthest progress cannot equal the subduration for which it is at all other points of furthest progress. If the subdurations during each of which the object occupies a different point of furthest progress are all equal the infinity of points of furthest progress will spell the impossibility of a finite duration in which the total motion can be accomplished, since the number attained by adding i + i + i ... is not a finite number. The question now is to decide whether there is any reason to suppose that the moving object spends any more time at one position than it does at another. The assumption that the subdurations corresponding to the different positions can be arranged in a decreasing series seems to have as its only ground the fact that it permits us to salvage continuous motion. The as? sumption that the subdurations can be arranged in some such series is contradicted by the fact that motion sometimes appears to be of constant velocity unless we introduce some such complication as the assumption that the moving object passes a given subduration at a point one quarter the distance, half that duration at a point three-fourths the distance, an eighth the original subduration at a point one eighth the distance, one sixteenth the duration at a point seven eighths the distance, and so on. But such systematically erratic variations in the durations for which the moving object is in different places advancing along the line of motion, constituting a theoretical complication introduced merely to save the possibility of continuous motion at constant velocity, multiply the variety of durations corre? sponding to positions wildly beyond necessity. Since there are no grounds for such a complication independent of the desire not to forsake continuous motion, we are better advised to simplify our assumptions by serious entertaining impossibility of continuous motion. VI. Hegel and Objective Contradications I wish, however, to disclaim Parmenidean inten? tions. The strategy for doing so after having assented to Zeno's basic claim was indicated by Hegel : Zeno was right as to the self-contradictoriness of motion, but what follows is not the Parmenidean belief that nothing moves but rather the Heraclitean one that there are objective contradictions.8 To be sure Hegel's reasons for holding the assumption of continuous motion to issue in contra? diction are not those which I have developed above. Indeed, he expressly repudiates the Racecourse argument on the ground that it falls into the error of conceiving a line segment as an actual infinity of points.9 He employs a pre-Cantorian concept of continuity. To the now-standard view that an infinity 7 Ibid., 356. 8 In the first place, contradiction is usually kept aloof from things, from the sphere of being and of truth generally.. ..

He agrees with Aristotle that a line segment is infinitely divisible but never infinitely divided. If he nonetheless agrees with Zeno that motion is self-contradictory, it is because he defines the moving object, albeit somewhat obscurely, to both be and not be restricted to a single point of furthest advance : since within the aggregate of points on a segment each point is identical with every other one, the point which the moving object has reached is identical with all other points which, accordingly, the moving object has also reached. The identity of points is one of units each of which is identical with the others precisely through being for itself to the exclusion of the others.10 The moving object falsely restricted to merely one point to the exclusion of the others is, by virtue of the identity of points, at once not restricted to merely one point. Motion requires the object both to be merely in a given position and not be merely in that position. Alternately the contradiction is that if all points along the segment are truly identical, the object must be at all points if it is at any of them, which makes motion towards a point not yet attained impossible. Although Hegel does not hold that the moving object must be at an actual infinity of points in the course of motion, he does hold that it must be and yet not be at merely one point at a time. His definition is based on Zeno's Arrow, which does not assume an actual infinity, rather than on the Racecourse reconstructed in the present paper.11 If Zeno con? cludes that motion is impossible because the arrow is only at one place at a time, Hegel infers that to be in motion is contradictorily to be and yet not be merely in one place at a time. But what is interesting in Hegel's position is not so much how he establishes the thesis that motion is contradictory as what he infers from this thesis once established. For, instead of falling into the Eleatic denial of motion, he continues to maintain that it is as obvious that there are moving things as that there are elephants.12 The discovery of contradiction in motion does not seem to shake his confidence in his senses. His agreement with Aristotle's refutation of the Race? course does not alter the fact that he ultimately agrees with Zeno that motion is contradictory and, even more scandalously, with Heraclitus that an object can both be and not be in the same place at the same time. Indeed, it is because he did not stop before such formulations that he widely presumed to have done what he said he did, namely to have denied the law of non-contradiction. Yet, however cavalier his attitude towards the law of non-contradiction may have been?and he lived in a time which it was permitted to be cavalier towards formal logic generally?, he did not really deny that law ontologically interpreted in the Aristotelean manner. The Hegelian affirmation of existing, objective contradictions must be put along side Hegel's equal insistence that because motion is contradictory it lacks "true being."13 We always had a clear idea of motion, to speak with Descartes, but it is only after our encounter with Zeno that we achieve a distinct concept of a moving body as a self contradictory and hence self-abrogating, self-cancelling existent. Motion is asserted to exist only insofar as a contradictory concept is falsely attributed to a sensory datum. But what induces us to falsely ascribe a self-contradictory state of affairs to the sensory datum is not merely a confusion arising from the limited capacity of sensory discrimination, which makes us run together a series of static sensory slides. For even partisans of the epochal theory of time14 or cinematographic theory of motion?theo? ries which explain away motion by modeling the sensory world on analogy with a vast motion picture screen, with motionless slides in such rapid succession that a sensory blur creates the illusion of motion? continue to ascribe motion to objects. The proposition that things move may abrogate itself upon conceptual analysis, but it continues to be intersubjectively posited as a condition of the very possibility of the fundamental social institutions of property and moral responsibility. Without the common assumption of the possibility of continuous motion and of continuous change generally, the identity of persons and things through time?which is to say in continuous motion relative to celestial objects?would be impossible, and with this impossibility the institutions of moral responsibility and property fall to the ground. For property ownership means that the thing which 10 Ibid., p. 268. 11 G. W. F. Hegel, Philosophy of Nature, trans. A. V. Miller (London, 1970), pp. 42-43. 12 History of Philosophy, vol. I, p. 266. 13 Ibid., p. 266. 14 William James, Some Problems of Philosophy (New York, 1948), pp. 154-186; Alfred North Whitehead, Process and Reality (New York, 1929K P-53&gt;PP- 105-106.</page><page sequence="7">MOTION AND OBJECTIVE CONTRADICTIONS 137 yesterday was last rightfully appropriated by an individual and never abandoned is the same thing which today is not open to rightful appropriation by another while moral responsibility means that the person who is now answerable for an action is the same person who previously performed the action.15 What makes a contradiction objective is precisely that it is a false, cognitively indefensible assumption whose public, intersubjective acceptance is nonethe? less indispensible to existing social institutions or practices. It is clear from the meaning of "objective spirit" in the Philosophy of Right that "objective" can mean "intersubjective" for Hegel. A public assump? tion is something objective for the individual because, even if he drops it on cognitive or theoretical grounds, it remains as a stubborn social fact independent of his will. An objective contradiction is a socially institu? tionalized contradiction insofar as its common ac? ceptance is a necessary condition of an institution's existence. Some objective contradictions, such as on Hegel's analysis the absolutization of the humanity of the slave owner apart from that of the slave, can be overcome by reform or revolution, but there are other institutionalized contradictions which would seem indispensible to the existence of any society whatso ever. Motion, I submit, is such a contradiction. Zeno shows that it is contradictory, but Hegel opens up the possibility of its analysis as a socially necessary contradiction. For my theoretically justified but subjective denial that things move due to the contradictoriness of motion leaves untouched the intersubjective acceptance of the proposition prag? matically justified as a condition of the possibility of all common life. If a Kantian postulate of practical reason is a true presupposition of our infallible knowledge of moral obligation, a Hegelian objective contradiction may be construed as a presupposition of practical reason in the sense of a false assumption intersubjectively adopted in order to make common acceptance of some institutional obligations, whether justifiable or not, logically possible. The doctrine of real or objective contradictions has long been a stumbling block for Hegel's interpreters. A. Sarlemijn has even tried to preserve Hegel from denial of the law of non-contradiction by supposing that real extra-linguistic contradictions may occur without any contradiction in the realm of discourse, to which realm, it is alleged, the law of non? contradiction is restricted.16 Less perversely but still unsatisfactorily, Jon Elster argues that a real contra 15 "Bodily continuity" is widely considered a necessary if not sufficient condition of personal identity. See, for example, John Hospers, An Introduction to Philosophical Analysis (Englewood Cliffs, 1967) pp. 410-419. Hospers holds that one test of personal identity would be to record the movements of a human body on film and thus establish that the body before us is identical with one previously seen by assuring ourselves that the body then seen either has continuously occupied or continuously moved into the position occupied by the body now before us. But since bodily continuity perceived on a motion picture screen is in fact illusory, the test Hospers proposes of the continuous existence of any actual human body is inconclusive. For it is always theoretically possible that the body which appears to move continuously in the filmed record in fact does not even exist as a continuant, i.e. that all that really exists is a finite number of discontinous, differently placed static body-events each registered on a single frame in the film strip. If Zeno is correct, bodily continuity never occurs, since even apparently stationary bodies move relative to celestial objects, and since such motion, like all motion, has been proven impossible. It may be objected that ordinary language does not use the same concept of continuity as is presupposed by Zeno's Racecourse. Even if there is no bodily continuity in the sense of a mathematical continuity requiring the body to occupy an actual infinity of different positions, we still ordinarily distinguish between the visible bodily continuity of, say, a moving car and the visible discontinuity of a film screened in such slow motion that, suddenly, the very illusion of motion disappears. However, if the disappearance of visible bodily continuity can be effected by decreasing the number of frames per minute, it might also be effected by increasing the level of visual acuity. Visual bodily continuity is termed illusory whenever it turns into visual discontinuity given either a sufficient slowing down of the rush of events or heightening of visual acuity. Perceived bodily continuity is non-illusory only when it would not change into perceived discontinuity no matter how acute vision became or how much the rush of events slowed down. But this means that perceived bodily continuity, when it is non-illusory, is bodily continuity in the mathematical sense of "Continuity". For only if a body occupies an actual infinity of positions (relative to selected celestial coordinate) will any arbitrarily great slowdown of events or increase of perceptual acuity leave the perception of bodily continuity unaltered. Thus the mathematical concept of continuity does not lead to any judgments which disagree as to bodily continuity with judgments invoking the ordinary concept of non-illusory perceived continuity. But the important conclusion here is that it can never be demonstrated that visual continuity is not illusory, for there can be no arbitrary limit set either to the increase of visual acuity or slowdown of a succession of events underlying the perception of bodily continuity. Perceived bodily continuity may thus in every case be illusory, which however it could not be for personal identity to be established by it. It follows that personal identity cannot in fact be conclusively demonstrated by the perception of bodily continuity. Indeed, if Zeno is right as I have argued, the bodily continuity test of personal identity is conclusively negative. And since the only other test, namely memory, is today widely agreed to be inconclusive in the absence of proven bodily continuity we conclude from the cognitive point of view that our refutation of motion is a refutation of personal identity. But if the assumption of personal identity is nonetheless socially indispensible, it is as much an objective contradiction as the presupposition of continuous motion which it entails. (Analagous considerations would indicate that the assumption of property rights is equally an objective contradiction.) 16 "One can approve of the principle of non-contradiction as formulated by Aristotle without adopting his views of being, according to which given reality, too, is free from contradication....

But the problem of the master and his contradictions may be only a figment of the imagination and thus lack real objective existence unless there is an actual, historical society in which the contradictions are insitutionally realized and thus rendered public, much as the assumption of our common rationality is institution? ally realized and made public in a democratic society, and as motion in any imaginable society. VII. Objective Contradictions and Postulates of Practical Reason Hegel's doctrine of objective contradictions emerged in his own development from a Kantian starting point. In 1795 in Bern Hegel was won over by Schelling to a Kantian-Fictean doctrine of postulates of practical reason. Although he had already seen in his T?bingen seminary days that this doctrine could be misused in the defense of theological orthodoxy, he believed for a while in Bern that by its proper use a romanticized Spinozistic metaphysics, which had already appealed to him since T?bingen, could be reconstructed consistent with the strictures of the first Kantian critique. The presupposition of the self's identity with the cosmic substance seemed to condition the possibility and hence obligatoriness of freedom as self-realization, i.e. as the infinite realiza? tion of the self in the world. From H?lderlin in Frankfurt (1797), however, Hegel learned that it is in vain that practical reason issues edicts to the world regarding what must be. The presuppositions of practical reason need not be true, for practical beliefs may be rational, i.e. well-tested, without being true. If it is (not : ought be) the case that something ought be, then any proposition entailed by the proposition that it ought be of course is (not : ought be) true. But it should also be recalled that "cannot" implies "ought not," that it is sometimes easier to know the limits of capability than the reach of obligation, and that the presuppositions of dubious moral beliefs are also dubious. Yet Fichtean postulates are not merely presuppositions of practical reason, for they are not merely true but are by a kind of fiat made true. H?lderlin's and Hegel's point against Fichte is that even if the presupposition of the selfs identity with the world were true merely by virtue of its postulation, the self would thereby be master of the world and thus, since mastery is an irreflexive relation, would be incapable of identity with it.18 In his early critical essays in Jena (1801-02), Hegel saw clearly that the doctrine of practical presupposi? tions could, depending on what practical or normative beliefs are adopted, be used to defend common sense (e.g. the belief in motion) as much as a non commonsensical Spinozistic metaphysics. Contradic? tory presuppositions of different practical beliefs cannot all be true. But even if the uncovering of practical presuppositions was no sure avenue to truth, it was still essential to the elucidation of practical reason, i.e. of practical beliefs and their institution alizations. The standpoint from which truth is discov? ered in the mature Hegel is neither that of one-sidedly theoretical nor one-sidedly practical reason. The truth is grasped in "love" (H?lderlin), more exactly in "absolute spirit" (Hegel), i.e. in an identity of willing and knowing in which what is willed is solely the being of what is known to be. Love thus perfected by knowledge is absolute self-knowing spirit. Yet absolute spirit not only transcends but also preserves the sphere of one-sidedly practical reason. Although the practical determination of the not-self by the self establishes a mastery over the not-self which precludes the more unlimited freedom possible only on the level of absolute spirit, it is under the dominance of practical reason that most of us spend most of our time. Yet for Hegel the true form of practical reason is not the subjective spirit of Kantian morality (Moralit?t), but objective spirit, institutional ontological laws and rules of thought. .. . The demonstration of contradictory facts itself is to be given in a non-contradictory way." A. Sarlemijn, Hegel3s Dialectic (Dordrecht, 1975), pp. 93-95. 17 Jon Elster, Logic and Society : Contradictions and Possible Worlds (New York, 1978), pp. 67-70. 18 Dieter Henrichs is largely responsible for focusing attention on Hegel's debt to H?lderlin. Hegel im Kontext (Frankfurt, 1967), pp. 9 40. This discovery helps eliminate the historically most potent objection to Hegelianism, namely that Hegel evinces a will-to-power in his absolutization of the system of categories and consequent negation of individual existence. This objection has roots in Schelling's view of Hegelianism as "negative philosophy," and has been restated drawing on the Nietzschean category of the will-to-power by Heidegger. It has been recently popularized by New Philosopher Andre Glucksmann's Les Maures Philosophes (Paris, 1977) ; another version occurs in my G. W. F. Hegel (Bostoni977), pp. 174-175. The reply is that domination by the will-to-power may characterize the early Fichte, but not Hegel after his conversion to aesthetic idealism by H?lderlin.</page><page sequence="9">MOTION AND OBJECTIVE CONTRADICTIONS I39 life (Sittlichkeit). That the ordinary mobile thing, which is common-sensical because it is commonly presupposed by practical qua objective spirit, is discovered to have been defined contradictorily moves thought beyond objective spirit, for thought cannot rest with a contradiction. But if the contradic? tion is objective in the sense defined in this paper, thought cannot abolish it either ; it can only compre? hend it critically. The doctrine of objective contra? dictions is what the Kantian doctrine of practical postulates becomes in HegeFs hands when (i) practical reason is reconstructed as objective spirit, (2) when the standpoint of one-sidedly practical reason is overcome, and (3) when theoretically in? adequate categories, however pragmatically neces? sary or persistently intrusive in the understanding of institutions, are dialectically construed as contradictory. VIII. A Concluding Refutation of Process and Reality The present paper has argued that Zeno's basic claim on motion is correct, but that Parmenidean conclusions need not follow. Much of the resistence to Zeno historically has of course been resistance to Parmenides. It has become clear in the work of Whitehead, however, that the denial of motion can be reconstructed on the radically pluralistic basis of an event ontology. Yet a Whiteheadian-type event ontology is as non-commonsensical in its own way as Parmenidean monism. The advantage of the theory of objective contradictions is that it points to how the common-sensical belief in motion can be pragmati? cally justified consistent with the theoretically (cog nitively) justified denial of motion. Event ontology and the theory of objective contradictions together point to an interesting alternative to the traditional view of Zeno's arguments as either sophistical or demonstrative of the impotence of reason. They have the potential for reducing the force of the historically dominant compulsion to refute demonstrations of the impossibility of motion like the one presented earlier in this paper. Without them such a demonstration is unlikely to lose the appearance of being a tour deforce. In evoking the name of Whitehead, however, it must not be overlooked that the present refutation of motion excludes any continuous process. Hegel notes that continuity will never be understood as long as we seek to construct it out of a sequence of discontinuous immobilities. But if it is not so construed it cannot be understood either, since a continuous process in which no state is exhibited more than for a punctal instant is in fact a process that does not occur. My own position on Zeno, which has a basis in Whitehead himself (see footnote 14), in fact leads not so much to the system of Process and Reality as to a theory of Reality without Process.19 For process implies a succession (not change) of states. But no state can obtain which endures not at all. Whitehead's system of process and reality is a contradiction in terms, for logically we either have process without reality or reality without process. Whitehead wants to subscribe to James' "all-or-nothing" principle. He maintains that either an actual occasion is all there or not there at all. But the same argument which forces us to explain away continuous process (e.g. motion) on the macro level in favor of a series of static events or actual occasions forces us to explain away any continuous process of concresence internal to an actual occasion in the same way, i.e. in favor of even more ultimate events devoid of process. The events either each exclude all process or ultimately lack ontological status. It may be readily admitted that the choppy, staccato cosmic symphony intimated as the alternative to Parmenides grates with its harsh? ness. The music of the spheres it is not. Continuity whether of process or change is more aesthetic. But philosophy is not art. The question is precisely whether, once aesthetic criticism is bracketed, Whitehead's system of process and reality, insofar as it implies the reality of continuous process?whether of concrescence or motion makes little difference? can survive logical criticism.
