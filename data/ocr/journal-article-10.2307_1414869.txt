The reader of this book is taken through a large part of the domain of animal psychology, including its history, its major problems (especially instinctive be- havior), and a part of its experimental achievements. The book is richly but carelessly documented with references drawn for the most part from French authors, most of the research done in America being left out of account. Kohler comes in for several pages but other references to German researches are scanty. Some of the older studies of Watson, Thorndike, Morgan, Yerkes and a few other papers by Hunter, Lashley, Jennings, and Loeb are listed in a poorly selected bibliography; but no use has been made of some of these references in the text. Such citations as the "Britisch Journ. of Psych.," R. S. Lashley, J. B. Wahson, and W. M. Weeler, numerous omissions of dates, the meager number of references to studies published after 1915, and dozens of typographical errors do not increase the confidence of a reader in the scholarly quality of the book. The author is a veterinarian, and has written more in the temper and with the empirical outlook of Romanes than of Washburn or Hempelman. Descriptions of animal behavior from the Atlantic Monthly or from Mercure de France stand side by side with data from Hunter, Watson, and Thorndike and not a little space is given to Jack London and James Oliver Curwood. The whole account is enriched by the author's experiences from his professional career and by literature from fellow veterinarians. The author's early statement of program consists of a pointed self-instruction against undue anthropomorphism and of a vote in favor of Lloyd Morgan's canon; but almost with the same sweep of the pen the author argues for a liberal interpretation of animal behavior in terms of human experience; and as soon as the review of the literature gets under way, it is the last injunction rather than the others that becomes dominant. The first chapter is devoted to a history of animal psychology in which a recital is made of the opinions of ancient and medieval authors. It is followed by a study of the methods that ought to be employed in animal psychology. It is here more than in any other chapter that the author tries to place himself inside of American research; but the attempt is not impressive. Four chapters, totaling 134 pages, are devoted to tropisms, reflexes, and instinct, one chapter being given to the instinctive behavior of the social insects. The dis- cussion of tropism is hardly more than a review of Loeb and is fair enough in its treatment. Reflexes are considered primarily in their r6le as the foundation of instinct and intelligence. Instincts are described as having a double origin. They represent complex and stabilized reflexes which can be transmitted by hered- ity, and are descended from acts which were originally reflective and conscious and have become unconscious through repetition. These, too, are said to be heritable. Thus the nature of the descent from intelligence to instinct is indicated; but we are not told how the ascent from instinct to intelligence was accomplished. There is throughout the book the implication that the genetic history of mind is to be read in terms of a progression through tropisms, reflexes, and instincts to in- telligence; but this is an assumption that is seriously in need of critical study and possible revision. The chapter on emotions (26 pages) draws much of its material from K6hler, Romanes, and Darwin, on the one hand, and from general experience, mostly</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 407 veterinary, on the other. It does more to set a problem and to throw light upon lacunae in research on animals than it does to indicate progress in understanding this part of animal psychology. The chapter on the intelligence of animals begins with a lengthy account of animal tricks and genius drawn from the tales of sports- men, veterinarians, and trainers, and it ends with the usual remarks about "clever Hans," the Elberfeld horses, and Kbhler on chimpanzees. There is, here, as in most of the other parts of the book, nothing more than a recital of facts and observations with hardly a critical remark on what has been reviewed. The book closes with a short chapter on language, which contributes almost nothing, and a brief rdsum6 of the mental life of the higher animals as compared with man. The general conclusions do not represent a summary of the significance and general bearing of the researches mentioned but only a diffuse and somewhat philosophical statement of the beliefs and opinions, not to say prejudices, of the author.
