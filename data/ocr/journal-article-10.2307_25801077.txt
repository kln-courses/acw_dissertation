Hiebert34 Recent research by Chinese archaeologists has identified many late prehistoric (2000-400 B.C.) oases, pastoral settlements, and cemeteries in eastern Central Asia (Xinjiang province of China). The synthesis presented here organizes the data into 10 archaeological cultures, defined on the basis of ceramics, burials, small finds, and architecture. The archaeological cultures reveal two periods, corresponding to the Bronze Age and the Iron Age. The oases cultures formed a core area before the Chinese Han period and maintained close contacts with nearby highland pastoralists in Siberia and western Central Asia. The evidence for interaction between Xinjiang and the complex cultures in China and western Central Asia is evaluated with regard to the origins of the early Xinjiang cultures. KEY WORDS: Xinjiang; Central Asia; China; oases; pastoralists; Bronze Age; Iron Age; chro nology. INTRODUCTION This paper reviews the origins of the desert oasis cultures of Chinese Central Asia (1750-400 B.C.). Until recently, Xinjiang ("New Territories") (Fig. 1) has been terra incognita between the contemporary indigenous Bronze Age worlds of the greater Near East to the west and the Shang/Zhou civilizations of China to the east. Scholars writing in Western languages (e.g., Debaine-Francfort, 1988, 1989; Mu, 1992; An, 1992; Ma institute of History &amp; Philology, Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan, R.O.C. 2Present address: Department of Anthropology, Peabody Museum, Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts 02138. 3Peabody Museum, Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts 02138. *To whom correspondence should be addressed. 243 0892-7537/95/0600-0243S07.50/0 ? 1995 Plenum Publishing Corporation</page><page sequence="2">ft n ar Kazakhstan \ R US SiA ..Js L.

The Bronze Age of Xinjiang can no longer be relegated to the pe riphery of these better-known Bronze Age cultures or simply considered as a transit area, such as a Bronze Age variant of the Silk Route. The early desert cultures of Xinjiang are best known from burials, which were extraordinarily well preserved through processes of natural des iccation (IAX, 1985b; Mair, 1993, 1995). Most excavations have focused on these burials, with limited concern for settlements of the oasis areas in which they are located. This paper reviews the available literature concern ing prehistoric Xinjiang in order to organize different cultural phases into a temporal-spatial framework. As a result, we can now discuss and evaluate evidence for the interaction of archaeological cultures of Chinese Central Asia with the Near East and Shang/Zhou China. We contrast the apparent isolation of Chinese Central Asia from other Bronze Age cultures with the close relationship the oases peoples had with pastoralists in the surrounding Tianshan and Altai mountains. The Oasis Model Eastern and Western Central Asian desert basins are environmentally similar, characterized by strongly seasonal continental climates with sparse rainfall and strong dusty winds. Perhaps the most distinctive features of Central Asian deserts are the river deltas, which fan out into desert basins, forming marshy and reedy environments. This natural oasis ecology has been documented in river deltas of western Central Asia (Kirsta, 1980) and in Chinese Central Asia (Hsieh, 1973) (Fig. 2). When natural river deltas were modified by irrigation canals and fields, the resulting new mi croclimate had less severe temperature variation and, in some cases, in creased rainfall (Suslov, 1961). These man-made Central Asian oases allow an intensive sedentary occupation in areas which are otherwise unable to support agriculture. Extensive archaeological research by Soviet archaeolo gists suggests that pioneer inhabitants created the first agricultural oases over 4000 years ago in western Central Asia (Hiebert, 1994). The earliest sedentary cultures in Xinjiang are located in what were similar deltaic areas in the desert environments. Nowhere in the desert areas of Xinjiang does rainfall allow for dry agriculture (Wang, 1983b). All agriculture in these areas must be based upon the exploitation of waters from small mountain streams which flood the deltas in the late spring (Hsieh, 1973; Tregear, 1965), in a pattern similar to that of the oasis cul</page><page sequence="4">os O sr n s &amp;? 9 a X n' a* &lt;* 3.

[See Olsen (1987) and Zhao and Xing (1984) concerning environmental change through time.] Desert Basins of Xinjiang The ancient oases of Xinjiang are located in the desert parts of the inland drainage systems of the Talimu (Tarim) and Zhunge'er (Dzungaria) Basins. (This paper adopts the standard Pinyin system for place names. Common names are listed in parentheses. See also the Appendix.) These basins contain two types of deserts: sandy deserts with huge mobile dunes and gravel pavements of exposed ancient bedrock. The gravel deserts are a distinctive feature of eastern Central Asia and owe their origin to the long-term erosional pattern and heat shattering since the late Cretaceous period (Zhao and Xing, 1984). The western part of the Talimu Basin contains the Takelamagan (Takla Makan) Desert, one of the most desolate and inhospitable deserts in the world. A particularly important feature of the Takelamagan Desert is the belt of gravel desert ringing the sandy desert, often isolating the foothills from the sandy desert. Along the southern edge of the Takelamagan, small streams from the Kunlun and A'erjinshan (Altyn Tag) mountains flow through the gravel zone. In places, this water disappears beneath the gravels and reappear out in sands of the desert, forming isolated deltaic fans where oases have been created by irrigation canals cut into the delta. Beyond the oases, the desert is nearly devoid of plant cover, and high dunes (some more than 100 m high) inhibit movement between oases. The Takelamagan Desert therefore is a formidable barrier to regional interaction. The southern series of oases was historically used as the trade route, during the time when oasis stations were maintained by central China in order to inhibit alliances between pastoral groups in Tibet and Xinjiang (Barfield, 1989, p. 54). Just outside the area of these oases, some of the earliest discoveries of "mummies" in Xinjiang had been made. Found by Stein at Niya (Stein, 1928, Vol. 1) and by Bergman in the Lobubo (Lop Nor) region (Bergman, 1939), these desiccated bodies from the Han period (second century B.C.) cemeteries were preserved by the desert conditions. Along the northern rim of the Takelamagan Desert, rivers from the Tianshan mountains fan out in valleys before encountering the gravels. The ancient cultures in the oasis sites from along the northern rim of the Takelamagan formed a separate group from those along the southern rim. The northern groups are more closely related to the Tianshan highland cultures than those from the other oasis areas of the Takelamagan.</page><page sequence="6">248 Chen and Hiebert The eastern part of the Talimu Basin consists of gravel deserts with low eroded mountains. From the Bogedashan (Bogdo Ula) and Kuluke (Kurlik) mountains small seasonal streams emerge, which form a mosaic of small isolated deltaic fans in eastern Xinjiang. The Talimu Basin extends to the east out of the political bounds of Xinjiang, where the basin opens to the Gansu corridor just to the south of the Gobi desert. Here, just be yond Anxi, at Yumen (the Jade Gates) are the westernmost extension of the Chinese Great Wall and the easternmost extent of Xinjiang oases. By the first millennium A.D., the eastern oases were often mentioned in Chi nese historical texts as linked with outside regions: to Gansu and the central Chinese region in the east and to the Zhunge'er Basin and the highlands to the north (Di Cosmo, 1994). Most of the Zhunge'er is an inland drainage basin, bounded on the north by the Altai mountains and on the south by the Tianshan range. The largest river, Er'erjisihe (Kara Irtish), flows northwest through a deep wide valley draining into Lake Zayzan on the steppes of Kazakstan. Here, mas sive mountains interspersed with depressed valleys form natural passages between China and former Soviet Union and permit moist air from the western reaches of Asia to penetrate northern Xinjiang (Hsieh, 1973). Like the Talimu Basin, many small streams flow into Zhunge'er. Natural oasis areas of reeds and thicket exist here, similar to the situation in the Talimu Basin. Ecologically, northern Zhunge'er is similar to Siberia (Suslov, 1961, pp. 572-575) and is cooler than the Talimu Basin. The region today is a vast rich pasture area, and in terms of human ecology, vertical transhu mance (typical of the Siberian Altai) is more characteristic of the northern edge of Xinjiang than of the the other oasis areas of Xinjiang. Highlands The Pamir and Hindu Kush mountains divide the large desert basins in eastern Central Asia from the desert and steppelands of western Central Asia. Although many passes allow for communication between these two areas, the mountains create a different environment in eastern Central Asia. The mountains surrounding the western portion of the Talimu Basin are composed of parts of the Tianshan, the Pamirs, and the Kara/Kunlun ranges. These ranges contain high, wide valleys carved by ancient glaciers and rich soils forming pasturage. From the southern highlands, passes lead into the basins of Xinjiang, west along the Keshige'er (Kashghar) River from the Ferghana valley and western Central Asia, to Yarkand through the Kunlun at Tashikuergan and the Karakunlun (Karakoram) passes. The</page><page sequence="7">The Late Prehistory of Xinjiang 249 Tianshan mountains stretch from the high Yili (Hi) basin and descend east ward toward the lowland cities of Ku'erle (Korla) and Ulumuqi (Urumchi). From the highland Yili basin, the Yili River flows west into the Balkhash Lake in Kazakhstan. The upper valley has abundant rainfall and is a fertile area for agriculture and pastoralism. The northern rim of the Yili Valley is formed by the Dzungarian (Zhunge'er) Alatau mountains, the north ernmost extent of Asian flora. From eastern Kazakhstan and Semirechye to the northern oasis areas of eastern Central Asia, there are wide passes such as the Zhunge'er Gates and passes through the Altai mountians of eastern Mongolia and southern Siberia. In southern Siberia and the Altai region, archaeological research indicates that agricultural settlements asso ciated with the early pastoral cultures of the mountains existed in these passes (Okladnikov, 1959; Hiebert, 1992). The archaeological remains of the early highland pastoralists are sim ple and sparse yet extensively distributed. The earliest manifestation, the Afanasiev culture (third/second millennium B.C.), is found throughout the steppe area of eastern Kazakhstan and southwestern Siberia, while the sub sequent Andronovo culture is found from the Caspian Sea to Mongolia (Kuz'mina, 1994). Of particular importance, the Alakul'-Fedorovo variant of the early Andronovo is distributed in the highlands to the north and between the oases of eastern and western Central Asia. These steppes and mountains were loci for seasonal migrations at the end of the third mil lennium and early second millennium B.C. by herders of sheep and goat and cattle, in a similar pattern in both eastern (P'yankova, 1994) and west ern (Moore et al, 1994) Central Asia. In the mountains of the Dzungarian Alatau, gold mines have been located (Chernykhov, 1949), which were ap parently worked as early as the second millennium B.C. (Akishev, 1983). It seems likely that because of the distictive resources available there, these mountains were exploited by both western and eastern Central Asian cul tures and may have been a location for their interaction. Research Framework The periods considered here span from the first appearance of artifacts associated with agriculturalists (including the earliest bronze artifacts) and the development of the painted pottery tradition (characteristic of the early oases) through the middle of the first millennium B.C. The archaeological evidence for the penetration of Han Chinese and their cultural influence into the eastern frontier of Xinjiang during the second century B.C., and the archaeological remains of the Wusun people, presumably resettled in Xinjiang by Han Chinese military activities, are not treated in this paper.</page><page sequence="8">250 Chen and Hiebert The prehistoric cultures of Xinjiang are determined on the basis of the identification of archaeological complexes, including burial practices, typology of pottery, appearance and type of metal objects, and other fea tures taken together. The cultures are distributed across this huge territory, with the cultural adaptations and their archaeological correlates often strongly reflecting the extreme environments of the Central Asian deserts and mountains. There are five major areas of settlement in Xinjiang considered in this paper: (1) the southern oases of the Takelamagan desert in the Talimu Ba sin; (2) the oases of Eastern Xinjiang, (3) the river valley regions on the northern rim of the Takelamagan desert, (4) the settlements at the base of the Altai mountains in the Zhunge'er Basin, and (5) the valley of the Yili river in its upper reaches in the Tianshan mountains. In these five regions, 10 "cultures" can be identified, which date from the second to the early first millennium B.C. (Fig. 3). On the basis of cali brated radiocarbon dates, six of the archaeological complexes?Gumugou, Yanbulake, Aidinghu, Xintala, Haladun, and Ke'ermuqi?date to the sec ond millennium B.C. Four assemblages belong to the early first millennium B.C.: Sidaogou, Chawuhugoukou, Qunbake, and the mountain "Saka" cul ture. This is a preliminary analytical structure for these sites since many excavations are in progress, especially along the southern rim of the Takelamagan, and many areas (especially highland areas) are yet unsur veyed. EARLY PERIOD (CA. 2000-1000 B.C.) The Southern Takelamagan Sites: Gumugou Culture In 1979, a cemetery dated to the second millennium B.C. was found at Gumugou in the lower reaches of Kongquehe (Peacock River, or Qum Darya) in the Lobubo region. Six of eight radiocarbon dates (all radiocar bon dates are calibrated) cluster at 2000-1550 B.C. (IAC, 1991). The ceme tery at Gumugou included 42 burials, and two types of tombs have been identified and preliminarily described by the excavator, Wang Binghua (1982, 1983a). The Lobubo region is located at the eastern edge of the Takelamagan desert in the middle of the Talimu Basin (Fig. 4). The major feature of the region is a large shallow salt lake fed by the Talimu River system from the north and the Che'erchen (Charchan) River to the south. The vast salt lake is isolated from the foothills by gravel pavement and surrounded by</page><page sequence="9">H ar ft ft &amp; 55" ? o X ?! 5' 3 era K&gt; in ??i ad 1000 - I 1 1 I I I I I 1 1 D ._o-?ft_-DD -_ 2000BCC[] -Q-LA D _L_ 3000 bc i - s 1 Gumugou Yanbulake .? | ?

Environmentally, the region is best described as part of the southern Takelamagan oasis zone. Gumugou type I burials are shaft pit graves made in sandy ground and are well preserved due to the desert environment (Fig. 5). Wooden poles were placed at the east and west ends of some graves. Coffins made of small wooden boards contain single burials. The bodies were extended, typically with their heads to the east, and were buried wrapped with wool weavings, fastened with bone pins. Felt hats were placed on the head, and in several instances, small parcels containing twigs of Ephedra sp. were found on the chest of the bodies. The Gumugou burial assemblage included bone, antler, chipped stone and ground stone artifacts, basketry, and wood artifacts. No pottery was found in any of these burials. Small amounts of wheat grains, cattle and sheep/goat horns, bracelets and necklaces made of bird bone, awls made of antler, and wood basins and bowls were recovered. Six anthropomorphic figurines were found, with five made of wood and one of bone. Nephrite beads and fragments of copper (or bronze) were found in the burials (Wang, 1982, 1983a, 1984). Metric analysis of the skulls suggest that the Gumugou I population was similar to the Afanasiev highland populations in southern Siberia and Central Asia (Han, 1986). Han (1986), who examined these materials, goes further, to speculate that the Gumugou people were pastoral migrants from the highlands area. However, the burial practices of these groups are all very different from each other, and unlike the highland pastoral burials, no pottery was found at Gumugou cemetery. The Gumugou I archaeologi cal culture apparently extends to other oases areas of the southern rim, although no other second millennium sites have been excavated in this re gion yet. Six burials (Gumugou II) are stratigraphically later than Gumugou I. Tombs of Gumugou II are characterized by an elaborate arrangement of poles above the ground (Fig. 6). The arrangement of the poles forms seven concentric circles around the tomb chamber, 5 to 6 m in total diameter. The poles of outer circles are thicker than those of the inner ones. This arrangement is considered to be a type of symbol for the solar cult tradi tions of ancient northwestern nomadic peoples as documented in Chinese literature (Wang, 1983a, 1984). It is also similar to the burial traditions of the Andronovo culture of marking tombs with large circles of stones (Gaul, 1943). Like the earlier Gumugou I graves, the tombs are also shaft pit form. The six individuals are all male, interred on their back in stretched position, with their heads to the east. Wood coffins were used but were very poorly preserved. Few grave goods were found, although cop per/bronze fragments were noted (Wang, 1982, 1983a). On the basis of his</page><page sequence="12">254 Chen and Hiebert Fig. 5.

An almost-identical assemblage excavated at the nearby Lobubo burial site of Tiebanhe has a radiocarbon date (from a sheep/goat skin) of 968 661 B.C. (IAC, 1991, p. 305). [A further radiocarbon date, 3880 B.P. ? 70 years (Wang, 1982), is not included in IAC 1991 (the comprehensive ra diocarbon data set for Chinese archaeology). It is from a goatskin blanket of a supposed Tiebanhe mummy. Wang (1994) and Mair (1993) include this earlier date for Tiebanhe.] Similarly well-preserved burials from this area were found at the Loulan site dating to the Han period, recorded by Stein (tomb L.F.4) in 1928 and by Bergman (1939, pp. 70-73). At cemetery 5 (Ordek's necropolis), eight graves were found on a smoothly rounded hill where erected poles were randomly scattered. As at the Gumugou I burials, wooden vessels and baskets were used instead of pottery. Twigs of Ephedra were also present. Recently, in Yinban (Weili County) near Lobubo, similar burial practices have also been recorded from a much later period. Like the earlier Gumugou burials, each burial had a large amount of wooden vessels and textiles (with a total absence of ceramic vessels) and the chambers were surrounded by standing wooden poles. On the basis of distinctive silk textiles embroidered with gold threads, cotton, and the oc currence of particular types of iron artifacts, these burials have been dated to the Han and Jin dynasties, that is, third century B.C. to A.D. fifth century (Yang, 1991). The earliest tombs (second millennium B.C.) contain tantalizing evi dence for early copper (bronze) and a farming and herding economy similar to that of western Central Asia. The radiocarbon dates for earliest burials and the date of those burials found at Loulan and at Yinban suggest long continuity of a local tradition for this region, extending from the Lobubo area west along the southern belt of the Takelamagan. Eastern Xinjiang Oases The mosaic of oases which surround the low ridges of the Bogedashan and Kuluke mountains in Eastern Xinjiang forms a geographical setting for human exploitation separate from the rest of the Talimu basin. The natural oases of the eastern Xinjiang region are near the modern cities of Tulufan, Shanshan, Hami, Ulumuqi, and Qitai. Early archaeological remains from this region provide some of the most interesting new information on the emerging picture of Xinjiang in relationship to its neighbors (Debaine-Francfort, 1988, 1989). The earliest remains are microlithic assemblages at Chaiwobao (IAX, 1989), Qijiaojing</page><page sequence="16">ul 0~ *1 Type 1 Type 2 Type 3 Fig. 7. Tomb typology from Yanbulake (from CROX and STC, 1989).</page><page sequence="17">The Late Prehistory of Xinjiang 259 (Teilhard de Chardin and Young, 1932), and others near Ulumuqi, Mulei, and Qitai (Wang, 1985a). These may relate to a true Neolithic hunting ad aptation which predates the sedentary occupation of the oases. Similar mi croliths have been found on the surface associated with painted pottery at Yi'erkabake, Mulei County, with plain red pottery at Xinge'er, Tulufan County, suggesting a continuity of traditions in this area during the devel opment of sedentary oasis adaptations, though their associations are not clear (Wang, 1985a). The earliest sedentary oasis assemblages in the eastern oases are de fined on the basis of pottery and burial types into three cultures, described below from east to west: Yanbulake, Aidinghu, and Xintala. The Xinjiang painted pottery tradition first appears in this region around 1750 B.C., and while there is some evidence for antecedents of the local populations in the Neolithic, the origins of the ceramic technology and the early oasis cultures remain unknown. Yanbulake Culture Yanbulake, the easternmost oasis assemblage, is found in the Hami area, distributed in two long narrow oases bands. The materials of the Yan bulake Culture were first excavated and described by Huang (1983, pp. 1-9) in 1958 at a small habitation site and cemetery, west of Yanbulake Village, Hami County. Originally 14 tombs and a walled compound were found. The Yanbulake cemetery was further excavated in 1986 and 76 tombs were exposed, providing a good corpus of ceramics for typology and a series of radiocarbon dates which clearly cluster in the second millennium B.C. when calibrated (see Fig. 3). This is earlier than previously reported (Debaine-Francfort, 1988, p. 18). Similar cultural remains have been found at Lafuqiaoke (ET, 1984), Yamansukuang (Chang, 1989; HM, 1990), and Haladun (Li, 1959) in Hami County. From the excavations of similar types of burials in the Wubaoshuiku area, millet, and ching-ke grains (barley?) have been reported (MX and IAX, 1979). The Yanbulake culture is characterized by its mortuary practice and the artifact assemblage from the burials. The burials are not marked on the surface (although they may have been disturbed by modern activities) and the pits are very shallow. Most of the burial chambers are built of mud bricks, without the use of separate coffins. Secondary burials are re corded but at least some of them were disturbed by ancient looters. In contrast to burials in the southern oases such as at Gumugou, these burials were placed in a flexed position. Three types of tombs (Fig. 7) are distin guished on the basis of the slight differences in the tomb structure, mostly</page><page sequence="18">Chen and Hiebert Fig. 8.

The excavators suggest that the typology of tombs indicates chronological change, and in one case a type 2 tomb (M33) is stratigraphically above a type 1 tomb. However, the artifact assemblage is similar in the three types, and the ra diocarbon data suggest a bimodal distribution. Eight dates cluster at about 1750-1300 B.C. and another three at 750-550 B.C., with one outlier (IAC, 1991). While the typology of tombs is clear, the variation in tomb contents probably reflects factors other than chronology, such as social or economic status. A similar cemetery in the eastern oasis area, Kezi'erquejia, exca vated by Wang Binghua, dates to 1350-1000 B.C. (Debaine-Francfort, 1988). The long duration of the funerary traditions suggests that Yanbulake fol lows the pattern of the other desert oases of having very little change in material culture, once established. The pottery from the tombs of different types at Yanbulake forms a uniform assemblage, despite the considerable time depth and variation in mortuary practices (Fig. 8). Yanbulake pottery is a handmade, sandy, painted red ware. Some ceramic shapes are similar in form to those to the east from Xindian Culture in Gansu, in particular, the footed bowl form with a single strap handle (dou) (Fig. 8, types 4-6) and the long-neck jar with two handles (Fig. 8, types 8-12). Painted pottery comprises one-third of the entire ceramic assemblage and is mainly black-on-red. Painted pat terns are predominantly waves, zigzags, hanging triangles, and S shapes. The motifs on the painted pottery are different from Xindian and, rather, are similar to the painted pottery of the later Chust culture and early Iron Age of Western Central Asia (Zadneprovskii, 1978). Paintings on the in terior side of the pottery are common, especially for the dou vessels. Some painted cups and bowls are perforated and at the center of the bottom, suggesting some kind of specific (although unknown) function. A small amount of gray- or black-colored pottery is found, some of which is similar to pastoral highland Afanasiev and early Andronovo (Alakul'-Fedorovo type) ceramics. The small finds inventory from these tombs is rich and diverse. More than 100 bronze artifacts have been found at these sites. The inventory includes knives, arrowheads, plates, plain mirrors, finger rings, earrings, buckles, tubes, beads, imitations of sheep/goat astragali; and other orna ments. A few iron objects were exclusively from the first type of tombs (M31, 72, and 75) and include knives, a sword (?), and finger rings. Stone implements include mortars, pestles, grinding stones, and digging stones.</page><page sequence="21">The Late Prehistory of Xinjiang 263 Other finds include a gold ear pendant with an agate bead, a silver hairpin, cowry shells, wooden human figurines and vessels, wool weavings, and sheep/goat astragali (CROX and STC, 1989). The common occurrence of leather punches, awls, needles, and spindle whorls suggests that the textiles and leather clothing typically found on the desiccated bodies have been made locally, and this has recently been confirmed by the analysis of some of the textile materials (Good, 1995). The variety and richness of mortuary remains reflect the success of the early oasis adaptation in the Hami region. The habitation site at Yanbulake was surrounded by a large rectangular exterior wall (50 x 60 m) with a corner tower and several rooms just outside of the wall. The exterior wall, constructed of pakhsa (tamped earth) and mudbrick, is 3 m thick at the base. This wall shows signs of having been rebuilt many times, in places preserved up to 5 m in height. Test exacava tions inside of the massive walled structure indicate three levels of occu pation, with the lowest level materials corresponding to the nearby Yanbulake tombs. It is not clear if the exterior wall was related to the Bronze Age Yanbulake settlement, although the brick construction of the massive walls is similar to that of the early tombs. The excavations of the lowest levels revealed remains of reeds and woody materials and small curved mudbrick walls on the original yellowish brown ground level. This indicates that the early oasis houses were aboveground structures with mud brick walls, possibly with poles and thatched roofs (Huang, 1983, p. 3). Physical anthropological study of the Yanbulake skeletons carried out by Han Kangxin (1990) can be placed in the context of his study of the other cranial series from Xinjiang (Han, 1993). The Yanbulake skulls in dicate a demographic structure dominated by "Mongoloid" stock (21 of 29 samples) with a "Europoid" component as well (8 of 29 samples). The "Mongoloid stock" resembles the skull characteristics of the modern East Tibet population, and the "Europoid" stock is similar to the early An dronovo and Gumugou populations (Han, 1990). This wider biological vari ation in the Yanbulake population is consistent with the archaeological data, which suggest that Yanbulake oases were a crossroads of sorts. The construction of the massive walled structure at Yanbulake and the similar mud-brick construction of the tombs are particularly interesting. Such tombs and walled complexes are characteristic of the oasis architec ture of the contemporary Oxus civilization in western Central Asia (Hie bert, 1994). Further, the features of the Yanbulake burials (i.e., flexed body position and numerous ceramic vessels, metals, beads, and tools) are more typical of the Oxus civilization from Bactria (Askarov, 1973) and Margiana (Sarianidi, 1990) than of any other of Xinjiang's neighbors. However, the types of ceramics and small finds are not typical of the Oxus civilization, nor are there imported objects from western Central Asia. Such a pattern</page><page sequence="22">264 Chen and Hiebert (Oxus-type burials containing local funerary goods) is one of the burial forms seen in the expansion from the oases of western Central Asia to other regions at about 1900-1700 B.C. (Hiebert and Lamberg-Karlovsky, 1992). If there is any place in eastern Central Asia that may have had direct contact with the oases of the Oxus civilization, it is at Yanbulake, yet the Yanbulake wooden figurines and painted pottery are clearly part of a local archaeological culture, with ties to the Xinjiang Gumugou culture and to the Chinese culture of Xindian to the east. One possible route of contact between eastern and western Central Asia is through the connections main tained by the early Andronovo (Alakur-Fedorovo type) pastoralists with the oases regions of both the Oxus civilization and Xinjiang, noted below. However, it seems that the architectural styles of western Central Asia may have come to the Yanbulake culture through direct contact with oasis peo ples to the west. Aidinghu Culture The eastern oasis region includes the distinctive Tulufan (Turfan or Turpan) depression, south of the Bogedashan (Bogdo Ula) mountain. Streams from the Bogedashan mountains provide water for surface irriga tion on the northern edges of the central Tulufan depression. In historical times, the salt marshes of the central depression have been irrigated, em ploying a Near Eastern type irrigation system of subterranean canals called "kanerjing" (qanats in Persian). The earliest remains in this oasis are burial groups at Aidinghu (MX and CPAMX 1982). The archaeological materials form a separate group from the other eastern oasis cultures and are probably slightly later than that of the earliest oases to the east and to the west. The distribution of this material is presently limited to the northern part of the Tulufan oasis area, from burial sites at Subashi (CPAMT, 1984, 1988; IAX, 1993), Bei yugou (Wang, 1988), Kageqiake (CPAMX 1987), Yingyayilake (CPAMT, 1985), and western Tulufan area as indicated by surface materials collected by Bergman in the 1930s. About 40 semisubterranean houses were identi fied in the vicinity of the Kageqiake cemetery site (CPAMT, 1987), but their date and relation with the cemetery are not presently known. The Aidinghu have rectangular shaft pit tombs without the use of mud bricks. The excavated tombs exhibit a fair degree of variation: at Subashi and Yingyayilake, some tombs were covered with a stone pile, forming a cairn or small kurgan. Wooden beds for the bodies were found in the buri als at Subashi, and burials with two individuals also occur. Some of the</page><page sequence="23">The Late Prehistory of Xinjiang 265 tomb chambers (e.g., Yingyayilake and Kageqiake) were covered by wood beams and reed mats and then stone and soil. In all cases, the bodies were interred on their back in an extended position, facing west. Several distinctive designs on the pottery distinguish the assemblage from that of Yanbulake pottery. Like the Yanbulake pottery, most of the Aidinghu ceramics are handmade, with black-on-red painting on a red body. The exclusively Aidinghu motifs are wide vertical stripes with net-like decoration, whirls, vertical line motifs which extend from the mouth to the base, triangles with parallel lines inside, and sharp solid saw-like painting on the interior rim. A small amount of (possibly highland-type) gray wares was also found. The funerary materials included few nonceramic artifacts, but these provide some indication of cultural contact and continuity: small wood hu man figurines similar to those from both Gumugou and Yanbulake. Bronze objects were rare but similar to those from Yanbulake, although many pre sented in the literature do not come from secure contexts and cannot be assigned exactly to this culture. The date of the Aidinghu culture (around 1400-700 B.C.) of the Tu lufan region is later than that of the other early eastern Xinjiang oases, including Yanbulake to the east and Xintala to the west, based upon a radiocarbon date from Kageqiake, 2640 ? 65 (CPAMT, 1987), and from Subashi, 3145 ? 175 (IAC, 1991, p. 332). While earlier materials may be found, Aidinghu may reflect the spread of the early oasis adaptation into the Tulufan oasis area from other areas. Xintala Culture The river valley around the modern city of Yanqi (Kara Shahr) opens out from the eastern Tianshan mountains toward the oases around Tulufan and Hami, forming the easternmost edge of the east Xinjiang oasis area. This area is unlike the other oases in that the river flows into a salt lake rather than a marsh or thicket. Geographically and culturally, the area has been an important connection between the desert oases and the highlands. The type site, Xintala, located on a terrace of the Kaidu River valley, is where a jade ax was first found. Preliminary investigation indicates that the site includes both habitation and burials, although no intact burials have been excavated (IAX, 1988b). The Xintala finds are characterized by a di verse corpus of stone tools and a distinctive type of pottery. The distribu tion of this culture seems as limited as Yanbulake (see Fig. 4), with Xintala type artifacts found at Aisentuoleha [Zhang and Wang, 1989 (although re ferred to as "Xintala" in their report)] and Quhui (Zhang and Wang, 1989).</page><page sequence="24">266 Chen and Hiebert Fig. 9. Haladun ceramics (from Huang, 1983).</page><page sequence="25">The Late Prehistory of Xinjiang 267 A few disturbed skeletons are found in Quhui but the tomb structures are not known. Domestic structures constructed of mud brick were recognized at Xintala, but there is no further information about them. Two calibrated radiocarbon assays indicate an occupation contemporary with that of Yan bulake and Gumugou. One date on charcoal is about 1700-1470 B.C. The other, a decayed millet sample, is calibrated and corrected for a C4-type plant to 1680-1490 B.C. (cf. IAC, 1991, p. 331). Xintala sites have two types of local ceramics and black-on-red ceram ics. The painted pottery is handmade or slow wheel thrown white slipped redware, painted with purplish-brown muddy designs (IAX, 1988). The forms include jars with either one or two small strap handles, bowls, cups with single strap handles, and jug forms. The motifs are divided by vertical lines into panels, resembling the patterns from Xindian Culture in Gansu Qinghai provinces. Geometric designs such as triangles, lozenge, and T shapes dominate. Zigzag, lattice motifs, wavy lines, and irregular motifs are less common. The other ceramic type is unpainted black or dark brown pottery with incised, stamped, or pricked decoration on the mouth or neck area. Most of these are sandy, with coarser sand used in larger vessels. Agricultural implements and tools such as stone hammers, mortars and pestles, grinding stones, and perforated hoe-like tools indicate a domestic economy similar to other oases areas in Xinjiang. Other objects indicate the access that this area had to other resource areas such as the highlands: a stone mold for bronze casting and a nephrite ax. Bronze objects (primarily surface finds) include an elaborately fabricated corrugated-socketed celt, arrowheads, an awl, and a knife. Clearly, the oasis economy of the Xintala people was differentiated from the oases to the east by its access to re sources in the highlands. Northern Takelamagan Rim: Haladun Culture To the west of the oases of eastern Xinjiang, agricultural regions are found nestled along the foothills of the Tianshan mountains. Here the en vironment is less arid than in the deserts of the Takelamagan or of eastern Xinjiang, and thus there is less spectacular preservation of burials. Histori cally, the lower valleys played a part in the Silk Route, since they provided a gentler route around the Takelamagan desert than in the south. Prehis torically, this area is also of particular interest due to the proximity of hab itable lowland areas to areas of highland pastoralists. However, little survey has been conducted in the Chinese Tianshan, which may have had a popu lation similar to what is known from the Tianshan in eastern Kazakhstan (Bernshtam, 1952).</page><page sequence="26">268 Chen and Hiebert The earliest materials are found in the lower valleys along the southern edge of the Tianshan, north of the gravel pavement which separates them from the Takelamagan desert. Evidence of occupation contemporary with the early eastern oasis cultures is documented at the habitation site of Ha ladun near Kuqa (Kucha). Excavations revealed a distinctive ceramic and stone tool assemblage stylistically distinct from Xintala (Huang, 1983). Similar materials have been reported from the sites located in the valleys the entire length of the northern rim of the Takelamagan from Akebulake in the east to near Shufu in the west. Haladun is a small mound excavated by Huang Wenbi in 1958 (Huang, 1983). Excavations of the lowest levels of this multiperiod site revealed posthole remains from wooden houses. This contrasts with the mud brick and pakhsa construction found in the oasis areas. The Haladun ceramic corpus consists of handmade fine paste red wares with both surface decorated types and painted types. The painted pottery has a distinctive white slip with red and purple decoration (no black paint). The painted designs (Fig. 9) include triangles, wavy lines, and stipples, and all of the rims of the painted wares are painted red. The surface decoration on unpainted pottery includes cord marking, incised lines, and applied ridge lines and horseshoe lugs. Over 100 bone artifacts were found in the excavations at Haladun including ar rowheads, awls, hairpins, and needles. Carbonized millet grains were also recovered and stone sickles are characteristic finds. Other stone artifacts include hoes, grinding stones, mortars and pestles, small stone tools, and ornaments. In contrast to the funerary assemblages which typify the oases areas, no metal artifacts were found at Haladun (Huang, 1983, pp. 105 114). This is probably due to the difference between mortuary assemblages and domestic assemblages rather than to any cultural or technological dif ferences between these regions. While almost no other Haladun culture sites have been excavated, a considerable number of surface finds have been made along the northern rim. Distinctive Haladun assemblages including stone sickles, ground stone tools, and unpainted pottery were found along the northern rim in the 1930s (Teilhard de Chardin and Young, 1932; An, 1948) and termed the 'Akesu Culture" or "Pebble Culture" (Wu, 1962). Haladun-type ceramics have been identified at other sites near Haladun at Dalikumu, Hajimake, Kalamakeqin, and Zhaoguote and as far east as Akebulake. Similar ground stone tools have been found to the east of Haladun at Keyiukeqing and Akereke (both in Luntai County) and Bogedaqing (in Yanqi County). Simi lar stone tools and unpainted ceramics have been found as far west as Shufu in the western end of the TMimu Basin (Zhang and Chen, 1991). lb the west at Akesu and Aketala, bronze artifacts including knives and rings were found (ATM, 1977), but no painted pottery and only a few bone artifacts were recovered.</page><page sequence="27">The Late Prehistory of Xinjiang 269 Despite the limited information on northern rim sites, there are im portant connections between the Haladun culture and the neighboring highland cultures. For example, a similar assemblage of groundstone tools, pottery, and bone tools is found to the west in the Ferghana valley Chust Culture (Askarov, 1992). Another similar assemblage is found in the high lands to the southwest of Xinjiang near Gufkral, Kashmir, where similar painted pottery and stone tools are found in the Tagisken burials (Sharma, 1982, 1982/1983). Zhunge'er Basin: Ke'ermuqi Culture The foothill plain around the rim of the Zhunge'er Basin has an en vironment similar to but less severely arid than the Talimu Basin. Marshy deltas in steppe lands surround the desert in the lowlands. Culturally, these lowlands are part of the economy of the mountains, rather than a continuity with the oases to the south. The earliest evidence of sedentary life in this area is from burials found along the northern foothill plain of the basin and are best documented from excavations at the site of Ke'ermuqi (see Fig. 4). Ke'ermuqi burials are marked by a rectangular arrangement (circular in a few cases) of Flat-lying stones (a "stone fence") and large upright stone markers (babas or balbals) surrounding a quadratic slab cist burial chamber. Some Ke'ermuqi type tombs are covered by stone or soil kurgans. Tombs without stone cists were also found at the Ke'ermuqi site but are later in date according to their grave goods (IAX, 1981a). The balbals are large stone slabs placed alone or in rows of several stones in relationship to a kurgan. Balbals are often carved with faces and depictions of clothing and gear, although many examples are without carving (Kubarev, 1984). Similar burials are found in the Siberian Altai, the Minusinsk region, the Trans-Baikal region, and highland Mongolia (Vinogradova and Kuz'mina, 1986; Litvinskii, 1988). The Ke'ermuqi Culture is of particular importance to southern Siberian prehistory based on many plundered tombs. The rich materials from southern Siberia often have only a gener alized relationship with the chronological typology of tomb forms. Intact Ke'ermuqi burials provide the direct association of these tombs with the local materials. The early Ke'ermuqi tombs have one or more stone cist chambers within a single surrounding stone fence. The bodies in the chambers are flexed and some are decapitated, apparently representing sacrifices (as many as 20 decapitated skeletons have been recovered from one cist). This pattern of burial treatment is similar to the Okunev Culture (Afanasiev</page><page sequence="28">O O ar n 3 9 CL n' o* ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^C Sid"0g'0 /-'J^ ^"X/^X ' SfDAOGOU: 33 Sidaogou, 34 Banjicgou, 35 Hungqijijicchang, v_\,-'??^36 Astuana, 37 Shircnzi. 38 Ka'crsan, 39 Lanzhouwanzi, 40 Kuisu, ,v\ /-.- ^-CHAWUHUGOUKOU: 41 Chawuhugoukou, 42 Alagou, 43 Narenkc, "&gt;w^ x-x' 44 Halamodun; OUNBAKE: 45 Qunbakc; SAKA: 46 Xiangbabai. 47 Heishanlou, 48 Ticmulike, 49 Zhongyangchang, 50 Yimuchang, 51 Tielisgaishan. 52 Nulasai, 53 Yuanloushan. 54 Dacaotan. Fig. 10. Early oasis and pastoral cultures of Xinjiang (Period 2).</page><page sequence="29">The Late Prehistory of Xinjiang 271 period) burials of Siberia (Gryaznov, 1969, pp. 51-66). Human figurines made of stone are similar to those found in south Siberia. In one tomb, a cache of sheep/goat astragali was recovered (IAX, 1981a), paralleling the bone offerings found in large tombs of the Afanasiev Culture (Gaul, 1943, p. 150). Ke'ermuqi ceramics are predominantly handmade incised greenish gray wares. The majority of vessels is round-bottomed or olive-shaped jars, which are hallmarks of the Afanasiev culture of the nearby highlands. The same tomb assemblages, however, also contain shouldered and vertical walled flat bottomed jars, which recall early Andronovo ceramics (Kuz'mina, 1986). A single-handled jug and one dou vessel have also been found in an early tomb at Ke'ermuqi, indicating at least some interaction with the eastern Xinjiang oases. Bronze artifacts are relatively few in comparison with the Siberian ma terials and consist mainly of tools such as knives, awls, spearheads, and arrowheads. However, stone molds for bronze casting suggest an economic focus on metal production, unexpected on the basis of the tomb inventory. These include composite molds for spades and an open mold for knifes and awls (IAX, 1981a). The artifact assemblage from Ke'ermuqi burials is also distinguished from the highland assemblages by its emphasis on stone objects: jars, bowls, cups with single handles (including one cow-headed handle), mortars and pestles, stone lamps, and arrowheads. While this culture is known primarily from the excavations at Ke'er muqi, many such burials are known in the Altai foothills, for example, in the counties of Habahe, Jimunai, and Bu'erqin (IAX, 1981a) and new ex cavations have been initiated in this region. The distribution of Ke'ermuqi type burials indicates that they are widespread along the foothills of the Zhunge'er Basin but are not found across the Tianshan Mountains. In west ern Zhunge'er, Ke'ermuqi type tombs have been identified at the site of A'erkate in the Yili Valley (Li Yuchun, 1962) and at the sites of Adongquelu and Aershate near Wenquan (Li, 1988). The Ke'ermuqi culture extended to the southern parts of the Zhunge'er Basin with burials found near Ulu muqi (Wang Mingzhe, 1984; IAX, 1985b, pi. 148) and near Mulei (Huang and Dai, 1986). Also, a Ke'ermuqi-style gray incised round-bottomed jar was found at Kan'erzi, in Qitai County (CCQ, 1982), in the region of the Yanbulake eastern Xinjiang oasis cultures. No radiocarbon data was available for the Ke'ermuqi Culture. Tradi tionally in the Chinese literature, burials with balbals were considered to be Turkic in culture (7th-10th century A.D.) (Chen, 1990). Recently, Mu and Wang (1985) suggested that the Ke'ermuqi burials with their balbals relate to early first-millennium Karasuk Culture of Minusinsk basin in the Yenisei Valley in Siberia [see Vasil'ev and Semenov (1993) for a recent</page><page sequence="30">272 Chen and Hiebert overview of the Upper Yenisei cultures]. But as suggested above, the Ke'er muqi Culture also has a close affinity to the early Andronovo Culture and may date as early as the early to mid-second millennium B.C. based on calibrated radiocarbon dates for the eastern Kazakhstan early Andronovo Culture (Kuz'mina, 1994). LATE PERIOD (CA. 1000-400 B.C.) Eastern Xinjiang Oasis Area: Sidaogou Culture By the beginning of the first millennium B.C., the oasis cultures of eastern Xinjiang became integrated into the Sidaogou Culture, incorporat ing the earlier, Yanbulake and Aidinghu cultures. The Sidaogou culture stretched from the Hami region beyond the Tulufan oasis to the north side of the Bogedashan mountains (Fig. 10). Sidaogou sites are characteristically small mounds, 20 to 50 m meters in diameter and 1 to 4 m tall. Such small mounds are widely distributed in Balikun and Yiwu Counties and are called geda ("boil" or "wart of earth") by local people (Wang, 1986; Wang et al., 1985). The best known of these sites are Sidaogou in Mulei (CROX, 1982), Banjiegou (ATM, 1981) and Hungqijijiechang (CCQ, 1982) in Qitai, Asi tana in Tulufan, Ka'ersan in Yiwu (Wu, 1964), and Shirenzi near Balikun (Li, 1959; Wu, 1964). At Shirenzi (sites A and B), walls were constructed with boulders and mud-brick; also, wooden beams and daub were recorded, suggesting that these were oasis habitation sites (Huang, 1983, p. 13; Wu, 1964). A house excavated at the site of Sidaogou is a large circular struc ture, with stone foundations, well-preserved wooden posts, and four in terior hearths (CROX, 1982). Several Sidaogou-type tombs placed in the upper levels of the structure are similar to Yanbulake type 2 tombs in form and construction, although they often hold multiple burials with the bodies in extended, prone position. Multiple burials are a common fea ture of the late period, found throughout the eastern Xinjiang oases and the other cemeteries along the northern rim of the Talimu Basin, de scribed below. Compared with the Yanbulake sites, pottery is relatively scarce and not very distinctive. The vessels are primarily handmade sandy red wares. Both round- and flat-bottomed vessels are found, which have a range of forms including jars with strap handles, bowls, basins, cups, and cooking vessels. Occasionally, the rims and shoulders of the vessels are perforated.</page><page sequence="31">The Late Prehistory of Xinjiang 273 Unpainted ceramics occasionally have comb-incised or cord-stamped decoration, and a few vessels have an applied clay band around the neck. Some gray pottery has also been found: a boat-shaped vessel from Shirenzi (Li, 1959) has a form which is similar to Neolithic (fifth millennium B.C.) pottery from Sanxi Province, which creates some confusion in attempting to use individual types to draw ceramic parallels. Painted pottery is a small part of the ceramic assemblage. This painted pottery tradition is described as the Nanwan group (Debaine-Francfort, 1988, p. 19-23; Mu, 1992, p. 202). The painted ware is red slipped and has red-and-black painted motifs which include curved and dentate designs, stippled solid triangles, and net-like designs. This culture is characterized by its varied stone tool assemblage. The inventory includes grinding stones, mortars and pestles, agricultural tools, drills, rings, spindle whorls, and bowls, as well as some microliths. A stone phallus suggested to the excavators a patriarchal aspect of the Sidaogou society (Mu and Wang, 1985). The small find assemblage suggests a con tinuity between periods of the economic and agricultural base of the oases. Carbonized wheat grains were found associated with a painted Sidaogou type jar excavated at Shirenzi (Wu, 1964). Bone artifacts include arrow heads, needles, spindles, combs, awls, "toys" made of cattle astragali, and ornaments. Bronze materials include knife blades, rings, hairpins, and or naments; a mold for casting knife blades indicates some local metallurgical production. One exceptional find was a pair of bronze earrings with tur quoise inlay from a burial at site B of Shirenzi (Huang, 1983). The Sidao gou Culture shares many features with the earlier Xintala Culture near the base of the Tianshan, particularly in the pottery decoration, stone tool types, and bronze tool types such as socketed bronze celts (Wang, 1986a). One site, Lanzhouwanzi, may be a regional center given its large size, unusually rich artifact assemblage, and large tomb. Here, a stone mound (probably with its soil either eroded out or removed for modern construction) was excavated in 1984, revealing a large semisubterranean, two-room stone structure (200 m2) (Wang et al., 1985). The walls were constructed of boulders with a dressed interior surface and are 3 m thick. Postholes with wood remains inside suggest that the structure was roofed. Three occupation layers were identified, each with several floors, hearths, and many artifacts. Many large grinding stones (averaging 1 m long), en igmatic stone balls, and distinctive ceramics such as painted wares and jars with two strap handles were found. Bones of horse, sheep/goat, and deer, and wheat grains were also recovered. In the upper layers, there was a Scythian-type cauldron. Within the structure, a multiple burial (more than 17 individuals) included an elderly woman, 2 adult men, and children/infants. At Sidaogou, a similar but much smaller stone structure</page><page sequence="32">274 Chen and Hiebert was found which included the remains of one elderly female and two children. Craniometric analysis of 17 individuals characterizes them as "Mongoloid." There appear to be two phases to the Sidaogou culture. The earlier phase is dated by radiocarbon to about 1000-650 B.C. from the lower layer (L4, 5) of the Sidaogou site (LAC, 1991, p. 314), from Kuisu, Balikun, and from an unspecified Sidaogou-type ge-da (IAC, 1991, p. 317). The upper levels of some Sidaogou sites and the Lanzhouwanzi site are later in date, although their artifact assemblage is difficult to differentiate from the ear lier assemblage, aside from rare artifacts. One radiocarbon date from basal layer at Lanzhouwanzi is 3285 B.P. ? 75 years (Wang et al, 1985). The distinctive cauldron can be compared with a fifth- to second-century B.C. example from former Suiyuan Province (today part of Inner Mongolia) and is similar to examples from the highland Saka culture (Zhang, 1985; Wang, 1987). This type of cauldron has a wide distribution over the steppes, ex tending as far as the Black Sea region, where a similar object was found from a Sarmatian tomb from along the Don River Valley (Maksimenko et al., 1987). Based on the radiocarbon dates and the stylistic parallels of the cauldron, it is possible to assign the later strata of Lanzhouwanzi site to approximately the seventh to second century B.C. Throughout the Yanbulake and Sidaogou periods, features such as the painted pottery tradition, indications of an agricultural and herding econ omy, and the placement of dwellings and burials in the oases indicate a continuity of the oasis adaptation in this area, although the continuity of the loGal cultures is unclear. Chawuhugoukou Culture The oasis culture at the eastern end of the Tianshan mountains re mained distinct from the other eastern oasis areas and was not incorporated into the Sidaogou Culture. The first-millennium B.C. Chawuhugoukou cul ture has some features which demonstrate cultural continuity with the ear lier Xintala culture, while its distinctiveness appears to have been due to its proximity to the highlands (see Fig. 10). The assemblage is "nomadic" oriented, although tools for agricultural activities and products are present. Unlike Xintala, which has practically no excavated burials, more than 1000 Chawuhugoukou tombs have been recorded and many excavated. The dis tribution of these sites is slightly wider than the Xintala sites, extending beyond Kara Shahr (Yanqi) oasis to Ulumuqi on the north of the Bo gedashan mountains.</page><page sequence="33">The Late Prehistory of Xinjiang 275 The burial sites are composed of fields of kurgans, with each kurgan having a surrounding stone ring wall. Such kurgans are found at Chawuhu goukou, cemeteries 1 and 2 (XAT and CPAMB, 1990) and cemetery 4 (Lu, 1988; 1989), and Halamodun (Sun, 1984). Some of the tombs are aligned in rows, such as at Narenke near Heshuo (Sun and Chen, 1985a) and at the slightly later Alagou cemetery near Ulumuqi (Zhang, 1987). The shaft pit tombs are lined with stones. Some chambers are covered by large cap stones (XAT and CPAMB, 1988). The bodies were interred face up with flexed legs on a layer of wood logs or grass and wood bark. Most of the remains are secondary burials of up to 30 individuals. Around major graves, subsidiary infant/child burials are found in shallow pits. Other pits contain remains of offerings of herd animals (horse, cattle, sheep, and goat) in a pattern similar to highland pastoralist rituals, such as at Issyk Kul (Akishev, 1978) or Pazyryk (Rudenko, 1970). Nineteen radiocarbon dates from Chawuhugoukou cemeteries 1 and 2 date this culture to about 1000 to 400 B.C. (IAC, 1991, pp. 327-329). There is a direct continuity between Chawuhugoukou and the early Xintala material culture. The ceramic assemblage is composed primarily of handmade red wares, as well as a few undecorated gray ware ceramics. Painted pottery (black-on-red) is common in the tombs at the Alagou site but is less common from those Chawuhugoukou. The designs are elaborate and painted primarily on the upper part of the vessels. Other designs in clude vertical bands which resemble the earlier Aidinghu ceramic motif. Indeed, these two assemblages are often grouped together on the basis of this single similarity. The metal assemblage indicates a major difference in the economy of the Chawuhugoukou Culture compared to the earlier periods: the general appearance of iron objects and of horse riding gear. The rich metal assem blage is composed of bronze weapons (knives, including some circular headed knives, arrowheads, spearheads); bronze and iron tools (needles, and awls); bronze, iron and gold jewelery (rings and hair pins); and horse gear such as bronze snaffle bits, bird-headed harness pieces (?), and bone cheek-strap pieces (psalia). Similar to burials found elsewhere in the Talimu Basin area, the dry environment preserved textiles, bone objects (such as arrowheads, spindle whorls, tubes, and beads), and wooden artifacts (in cluding basins, handled cups, spindle whorls, and a bow with arrows). Zoo morphic "animal-style" motifs on some perishable objects had been only hinted at on the more durable artifacts typically preserved of this time pe riod. The few stone objects are small grinding stones (about 10 cm long), small mortars, awls, spindles, and beads. The Chawuhugoukou site, the largest grouping of burials, may have been the regional center, at least in terms of the burial rituals. At Chawuhu</page><page sequence="34">276 Chen and Hiebert Fig. 11.

Qunbake small finds (XAT and CPAMB, 1987).</page><page sequence="36">278 Chen and Hiebert goukou cemetery 1, a very rare bronze bowl was found (Lu, 1989, p. 276). In one area (in cemetery 4), 10 small stone mounds (without any burials) were found with white, red, yellow, and black stones on them, apparently marking ceremonial or ritual loci (Lu, 1988). The Alagou cemetery, near Ulumuqi, occupies an intermediate posi tion between the eastern oases and the Zhunge'er basin steppe. Radiocar bon dates from Alagou are around 800-300 B.C. (IAC, 1991, pp. 306-308). These burials are typical of the Chawuhugoukou type, and have similar ceramics, although no agricultural implements were found. The many horse, cattle, sheep, and goat remains suggest a greater focus on pastoral activities. The physical anthropology suggests diversity in the population with "Pamir-Ferghana" types, so-called "Mediterranean" Central Asian types, and a few "Mongolian" individuals (Han, 1988). Northern Takelamagan Rim: Qunbake Culture Cemeteries and kurgans of the Qunbake culture follow the Haladun culture, north of the Takelamagan desert at the base of the Tianshan moun tains (see Fig. 10). The Qunbake archaeological assemblage is similar to the Chawuhugoukou, and the cultures are differentiated primarily in terms of the form of the burial structure and ceramic styles. The Qunbake as semblage, with evidence of horse pastoralism and of iron technology, is quite different from the earlier Haladun farming settlement assemblages and represents a potentially important shift in economy. The Qunbake cemetery site, the only excavated site of this archae ological culture, is composed of three fields of kurgans (XAT and CPAMB, 1987; Sun and Chen, 1985b, 1986; Cong, 1987, 1988). There are three size groups of kurgans: the largest kurgans reach 30-40 m in diameter and 1-2 m in height. The medium and small kurgans are 5-10 m in diameter and 20-30 cm in height. The construction of the kurgans is consistent, with a large shaft-pit chamber dug beneath the mound in each case. In the largest tombs a circle of erect wood poles forms a circle inside the chamber, re calling the wooden pole arrangement from the southern Takelamagan rim sites. Medium-sized kurgans sometimes have a circle of stone instead of wood (Cong, 1987). Some have wooden beams forming a chamber extend ing aboveground, for example, at Qunbake cemetery 2 (Cong, 1988). Small kurgans have simple shaft-pit chambers. The tops of the chambers are cov ered by wooden logs of irregular length, reed or grass mats (some burned), and then a soil and stone covering. The construction of these kurgans thus differs from the Chawuhugoukou type, which uses stone for the chambers</page><page sequence="37">The Late Prehistory of Xinjiang 279 Fig. 13. Burial types from the Saka of the Yili valley (a) Tiemulike M4 (IAX 1988a, Fig. 3), (b) Tiemulike Mil (IAX 1988a, Fig. 6). and walls. These differences may simply reflect access to different construc tion materials. Similar to Chawuhugoukou, a large portion of the tombs at Qunbake is reused and includes multiple burials, with as many as 42 individuals. Pri mary burials are found with the dead in a flexed position. Many tombs have subsidiary infant burials, and surrounding pits contain offerings of horse heads, camel heads, and sheep, goat, or dog remains. The bulk of the ceramic inventory is composed of plain, handmade sandy red wares (Fig. 11). Painted pottery has black and red designs on a yellowish-white slip. The designs include hanging triangles filled with par allel lines and a net-like decoration. Spouted wares with one handle and handled jars are common. A few gray wares are also found. The painted slipped ceramics permit the differentiation of the Qunbake materials from the materials from sites farther east. The burials frequently contain a wide variety of small objects (Fig. 12) that reflect an agricultural/pastoral economy: small grinding stones, bone</page><page sequence="38">00 o O 3T a 3 a ffl &lt;?' cr &lt;* ^^^^^^^^^^^^ ^^^^^^^ ^^^^^^^^^^^^ 2 3 ^^^^^^^^^^^^ ^^^^ IIHiiHHlHH^HH 4 Fig. 14.

The bod ies were interred with bronze buckles, bronze earrings, plain and handled bronze mirrors, bone hairpins, and beads made of bone, agate, and rock crystal. Sheep/goat astragali are commonly associated with child burials. Weapons include bronze and iron knives, daggers, and arrowheads (Cong, 1987, 1988). Wooden bowls, cups, and spindle whorls have also been found. The iron knives are usually found in wooden basins and associated with a string of sheep/goat vertebraes. Wheat has been recovered from the backfill of the tombs. Eleven of the 14 radiocarbon dates from these cemeteries cluster from 800 to 400 B.C., with two younger and one older (IAC, 1991, pp. 332-334). This culture has a close affinity with the Chawuhugoukou culture, with simi lar ceramic and stone tool assemblages. Both have multiple burials, with surrounding pits containing child burials and animal offerings around the major chambers. Although many Chinese archaeologists lump this culture into the Chawuhugoukou culture (Chen, 1993), the similarities in tomb or ganization to some of the southern rim tomb types, such as Gumugou II, suggests that these sites should be considered separately from those of the eastern oasis Chawuhugoukou Culture. Mountain Areas: Saka Culture "Saka," an ancient Persian name for the people who lived in Central Asia, is employed in contemporary Russian literature to indicate the horse riding highland pastoral groups of the Tianshan and Alatau mountain val leys. Their territory in Xinjiang before the third century B.C. extended to the Pamir mountain valleys and south to the Tashiku'ergan valley (Wang Binghua, 1985; Wang Mingzhe, 1985). Three types of Saka peoples are identified by ancient Persian texts, and many Saka "states" located around the Chinese west borderlands are recorded in Han (second-century B.C.) documents (Di Cosmo, 1994). Although these groups were all highland pas toralists, different groups of Saka people may not have had similar material correlates. Thus, describing any particular archaeological complex as "Saka remains" involves a historical interpretation. Chinese archaeologists make this assignment according to the suggested historical distribution of Saka peoples in a particular region (e.g., the Yili Valley) in a definite period (before Wusun people arrived at the Yili Valley, perhaps before 200 B.C.) (see Fig. 10). In the Yili Valley, and along the northern slopes of the Tianshan, cemeteries with round stone or soil mounds without a circle of stones mark ing the mounds are designated "Saka" tombs. The graves typically have a</page><page sequence="40">282 Chen and Hiebert shallow shaft-pit form with only one chamber, in contrast to those from the lowlands. The Saka tombs were sometimes reused and divided by stone structures into two or three chambers (Mu and Wang, 1985). Saka tombs are distributed in the highlands as far to the south as the Tashiku'ergan pass of the Kunlun mountains, at the site of Xiangbabai (IAX, 1981b). The Saka burials resemble those in the lowlands, in particular those of Alagou site, Chawuhugoukou, and the structure of tomb chamber and stone/soil mounds of the Sidaogou Culture. A radiocarbon date from a Saka-type kurgan from Tiemulike (770-430 B.C.) agrees with the suggested dating of these Saka burials with the lowland cultures. There is considerable variation in the construction of Saka kurgans from the Yili Valley. At the Zhongyangchang and Heishantou sites, round shaft-pit burial chambers are covered with stone slabs under the soil kur gan. At the site of Tiemulike, several kurgan types are found together (IAX, 1988a). These include tombs which are stone-lined on one side and have the bodies placed on the other side. In two graves, the stones are carefully deposited directly on the bodies (Fig. 13, b). A third type of burial at Tie mulike is composed of a shaft-pit chamber with an interior platform around the chamber (Fig. 13, a). This one, however, is later in date than the others (IAC, 1991, p. 305). The kurgans from the south, at Xiangbabai, are constructed of stone with a shaft-pit chamber lined with wooden beams. These are very similar in form to the Tianshan (both highland and lowland) burials, have a similar material culture, and have been radiocarbon dated to 900-400 B.C. (IAX, 1981b). The pottery from Saka graves is commonly plain, sandy, handmade redware. Painted pottery (Fig. 14) is also present but is rare. Mu and Wang (1985) claim that the painted pottery precedes plainwares, however, there is plain ware pottery from the early Saka tombs at Xiangbabai (IAX, 1981b, Fig. 11). The painted pottery motifs (net-like motifs, multiple parallel lines, spiral lines, and inverted solid triangles) are generally similar to those from the lowland sites of Xinjiang and closest to those from the Sidaogou cul ture. Unpainted pottery sometimes has incised lunate bands, and the plain wares from the Yili Valley have characteristic handles. In comparison to the lowland kurgans, the Saka tombs have a wealth of precious objects and metals. Gold, bronze, and iron objects have been found in the tombs in the Yili Valley at Zhongyangchang (IAX, 1985a) and in the south highlands at Xiangbabai. Agate beads were recovered both at Xiangbabai and from the Yili Valley site of Tiemulike. Bronze objects are particularly numerous and important in the Saka assemblages. Stylistically distinctive bronze objects from the kurgans include mirrors, ornamented hairpins, and animal-style objects, such as a needle with</page><page sequence="41">The Late Prehistory of Xinjiang 283 standing ibex finial. Many other bronze artifacts, including large caul drons, ritual tables, and statues, have been found in the Yili Valley and are considered to be Saka remains (Wang Binghua, 1985; Zhang, 1985). In the Saka region of the northern Tianshan mountains, two ancient cop per mining sites have been investigated. The sites of Nulasai and Yuan taoshan contain shafts, tunnels, and wood structures. Two radiocarbon assays suggest a time frame of 900-400 B.C. (IAC, 1991, p. 305). A smelt ing site has been found near Nulasai, with Saka type ceramics, slag fields, and pieces of large round convex copper ingots (IAX, 1985b; Wang Binghua, 1985). CONCLUSIONS The archaeology of the early oases indicates long-term cultural conti nuity in Xinjiang of agriculturalists and pastoralists, beginning as early as the second millennium B.C. The evidence of shared stylistic and techno logical elements, similar burial patterns, and similar types of local econo mies reveals a Xinjiang tradition, distinct from its neighbors. The close similarity of the Gumugou and Yanbulake human figurines suggests a "core" area for the Xinjiang oasis areas, which continued through to his toric times along the southern sites of the Talimu Basin. Most of the various cultures utilized wheat, barley, and millet, with assemblages of stone agri cultural tools suggesting its local production in the oases. In each of the regions, and in both the first and the second periods, burials are marked above the ground by means of stone or soil mounds, stone fences, circles, or wooden structures. A feature found in all of the burials, even in the oases, is the offerings of herd animals. This tradition indicates a relationship with the surrounding highlands and their pastoral resources. The design and technology of the ceramics found on the sites of the eastern Xinjiang oasis, the northern rim sites, and the foothills of the Altai are very similar. Exchange between the oasis areas and the sites of the nearby highlands in every region of Xinjiang is documented by the distri bution of local ceramic types. For example, pedestal footed bowls (dou) are found in the Altai foothills at Ke'ermuqi, in the eastern oases of Yan bulake, and at the Chawuhugoukou Culture site of Yu'ergou. Nephrite (jade) products from the Xintala and Gumugou sites indicates some degree of interaction around the rim of the Takelamagan Desert. Bronze artifacts are found in all of the cultures of the early oases of Xinjiang, and bronze working was conducted on the Xinjiang oasis and highland sites them selves.

Distribution of ceramic types in the early oases of Xinjiang.</page><page sequence="43">The Late Prehistory of Xinjiang 285 Chawuhugoukou sites. The proximity of the Yanbulake and the Chawuhu goukou sites to the foothills and mountains allowed access to a wider exchange network than other Xinjiang oasis areas. Thus, differences between the Xin jiang culture areas may be due to differential access to resources. The archaeology of the early oases Xinjiang suggests that the shift from the early period (second millennium) to the later period (first millennium B.C.) involved important transitions in technology and agricultural economy, namely, the dawn of the Iron Age and the introduction of horse nomadism. Continuity between the early and the later cultures is apparent in some cases, although it is not clear how these developments took place, and in many cases the relationship between the earlier and the later cultures is not known. In the eastern oasis area, cultural trends suggest a development from the oases at the base of the Tianshan mountains (Xintala Culture) in the formation of the later Sidaogou Culture (Fig. 15). The connection between the earlier Yanbulake Culture and the Sidaogou Cultures in the eastern oasis area is unclear. Similarly, along the northern rim of the Takelamagan the first-millennium B.C. site of Qunbake is closer to the traditions of the nearby eastern oasis Chawuhugoukou burials than the traditions of the ear lier Haladun culture. In this case, one could suggest a spread of influence from the eastern oases toward the west. Highland Interaction with Xinjiang While very few highland pastoral sites have been investigated in the Tianshan or Altai mountains of Xinjiang, archaeological research conducted by former Soviet archaeologists has located nomadic sites of all periods across the border from Xinjiang in southern Siberia and the Central Asia republics. The earliest Xinjiang oasis areas were ringed by contemporary highland pas toral sites in the Altai and Irtysh region, in the Lake Balkhash and Semire chye area, around Issyk Kul, and in the eastern Pamir and Tianshan ranges. The former Soviet and Russian archaeologists traditionally date Andronovo pastoral sites to the late second millennium B.C. on stylistic grounds (Litvin skii, 1988) supported by uncalibrated radiocarbon dates (Kuz'mina, 1994). Calibration of the Soviet radiocarbon dates places the Andronovo Culture into the early to mid-second millennium B.C. (Hiebert, 1995). As first proposed on the basis of the physical anthropological studies conducted by Han (1986, 1990), the Gumugou and Yanbulake cultures may have originated from the highland Andronovo pastoralists of southern Si beria and the Pamirs. While the proposed ethnic and genetic connections are not supported by other anthropological data, the archaeological evi dence tends to support Han's hypothesis. Tomb form and contents from</page><page sequence="44">286 Chen and Hiebert Gumugou are most similar to burials from Bes-Oba, near Karkaralinsk (Si beria), where burials include a round platform surrounded by stone slabs placed like rays (Okladnikov, 1959, p. 24). The Gumugou wooden vessels with attachable feet are very similar to the traditions of the pastoral cultures of the Altai region. In the Gumugou graves, commonly, handfuls of wheat were placed in a grass basket placed near the head of the burial (Wang, 1982, 1983a). This is parallel to a funerary ritual at Andronovo sites, such as at Alekseevka in Siberia, where presumed ritual pits with wheat were discovered (Okladnikov, 1959, p. 24). Since wheat is not native in China (wild wheat still grows in Xinjiang today but is probably a feral domesti cate), the wheat must have been part of their cultural tradition before Gu mugou people settled in the Lobubo region. The Gumugou culture appears to have a close relation to steppe cultures, but without excavations of set tlements, it is still unclear what the relationship is. By the mid-first millennium B.C., the pattern of oasis-highland inter action shifted from the southern Siberian and Pamir connections to the Tianshan range and eastern Kazakhstan. The pastoral adaptation in the steppes and mountain valleys of the Tianshan and neighboring highlands was transformed by the appearance of horse-riding pastoralists. The interaction of "Saka" cultural groups with the Sidaogou culture is particularly strong. Evidence for interaction between the highlands and the oasis includes similar motifs on the Sidaogou pottery with the Saka ceramics from the Yili Valley. Further, Sidaogou unpainted pottery was recovered from a Saka burial in the Yili Valley (Dacaotan, Miquan County) (IAX, 1986). Saka-type bronzes from Lanzhouwanzi and a Saka-type pendent mirror from the late period of the Aidinghu site in Tulufan are identical to those from the Yili Valley. Bone arrowheads found in Sidaogou sites are very similar in shape to those from Saka remains and it is likely that they are intrusive ar tifacts. In both the early period and the later period, there was interaction between oasis farmers and the highland settlements, but the emphasis in interaction shifted toward the highlands in the later period. In the early period, the richest and most diverse burial assemblages were in the oasis settlements, indicating the importance of agriculture. In the later period, the richest assemblages were in the sites closer to the highlands, indicating a shift in importance to highland resources. Western Central Asian Interaction with Xinjiang A key to understanding the origins of the oases in Xinjiang is the identification of the contacts with wheat cultivators in western Central</page><page sequence="45">The Late Prehistory of Xinjiang 287 Asia. Wheat has been found in all of the early Xinjiang oases and the farming technology would have been the same as in the western lowland oases. During the late third/early second millennium B.C., irrigation based oasis settlements first developed in the oases of Bactria and Mar giana of western Central Asia (Hiebert, 1994). Both the western oasis and the eastern oasis agriculturalists had close interactions with the Alakur-Fedorovo type Andronovo pastoralist of the steppe and high lands between the oasis areas. Evidence suggests that the original set tlement of the Xinjiang oases followed a Central Asian pattern of adaptation and subsistence pattern including the location of settlements in deltaic fans and the development of a farming economy. However, the early oasis culture of western Central Asia, characterized by a dis tinctive artifact assemblage, fine pottery manufacture, and large archi tectural complexes, has not been definitely identified at any of the contemporary oasis settlements in Xinjiang. Further, in the early second millennium B.C., there is no evidence of Xinjiang painted pottery or Xinjiang oasis-type burial practices in the western Central Asian oasis cultures. The closest similarities with western Central Asia are found in some aspects of Yanbulake, as noted above. Once established, however, the earliest oases in Xinjiang develop entirely separately from the oasis cultures of western Central Asia. By the mid-second millennium B.C., the nature of interaction between the oases of western Central Asia and the new oasis cultures of Xinjiang appears to have changed, with the material culture of the oasis cultures of Xinjiang appearing on the steppes to the west. In particular, the Chust culture in the Ferghana valley developed a similar material assemblage to that of the Haladun Culture of west Xinjiang. This includes pottery, stone sickles, and stone knives. Other stone artifacts from the Haladun Culture, such as grain grinding stones, picks, and hoes, are common to the Chust Culture. The meander pattern of Chust painted pottery (Askarov, 1992, Fig. 3) is simi lar to those from Haladun and Yanbulake. Furthermore, many bone tools of Chust Culture also recall the Haladun inventory. Two radiocar bon data for the Chust Culture (Zhang and Chen, 1991), 3050 B.P. ? 120 years and 2720 B.P. ? 120 years, suggest that Chust is slightly later than Haladun. The technology and decoration of early Iron Age painted pottery from western Central Asia [dated to 1500-900 B.C. by Hiebert (1993)] are simi lar to ceramics from Xintala, Yanbulake, and Haladun. The similarities be tween the Xinjiang painted pottery traditions and those of the later western Central Asian Iron Age painted pottery may indicate ties to a new type of pastoralism which originated in Xinjiang and has yet to be clarified in west ern Central Asia.</page><page sequence="46">288 Chen and Hiebert Gansu-Qinghai Interaction with Xinjiang Xinjiang is ideally situated for examination of the hypothesis of ancient diffusion of pottery traditions, either the eastward or the westward, as pro posed by Andersson (1943, 1973) on the basis of the collected painted pot tery. Today, it is clear that the painted pottery found in Xinjiang is not contemporary with the apparently similar painted pottery tradition of cen tral China (Chen, 1982; Wang, 1986b). Painted pottery appeared in Xinjiang after the beginning of the second millennium B.C., and these ceramics are very different in form and decoration from the ceramics of the fourth mil lennium B.C. in Gansu or Qinghai Provinces. The local Neolithic painted pottery culture in Gansu-Qinghai is the Majiayao Culture (sometimes called the Gansu Yangshao Culture), dated to about 3300-2500 B.C. The decoration and form of its painted pottery are not similar to those from Xinjiang. Pottery from the later phases, Ban shan and Machang, dated to 2800-2000 and 2450-1900 B.C., respectively, also has little connection with the west. The same relationship is found with the Qijia Culture, dated to about 2300-1900 B.C. (Chang, 1986; De baine-Francfort, 1995). While the origins of the pottery tradition in the eastern oasis area of Xinjiang are likely to be related to the agricultural and pastoral com plex brought in from the surrounding highland populations, there are cer tain ceramic forms in the earliest Xinjiang pottery which are similar to those in Gansu-Qinghai. In the eastern Xinjiang oases, high-stemmed footed bowls (dou vessels) with single handles and long-neck jars with two handles from Yanbulake are identical in form to those from the Xin dian culture (Tangwang Phase). The spiral patterns of Yanbulake pottery are also similar to those at Tangwang. While the similarity is quite clear, the date of Xindian/Tangwang is about 1400-900 B.C. (IAC, 1991), thus, later than the Yanbulake Culture. It is possible that both cultures ac quired these kinds of vessel forms and decoration from a common origin. Footed bowls with and without handles are already found earlier in Gansu in the Machang Phase, and double-handled footed bowls are pre sent in the Majiayao Culture. A stronger relationship is seen when the designs of painted pottery from Xintala are compared with those from the later Xindian Cultures of Gansu. They are similar in decorative ele ments and in the structures of the patterns, and both styles divide the background into several fields with multiple straight lines. The painted pottery of Bronze Age Gansu-Qinghai has a much simpler decorative pat tern than previous phases, which is usually considered to be a degradation of the local traditions. It is, however, likelier that the designs of Xinjiang</page><page sequence="47">The Late Prehistory of Xinjiang 289 Xintala pottery influenced the designs of pottery in the post-Machang painted vessels. Several bronze objects from Gansu are comparable to objects from the eastern oases of Xinjiang. A round bronze ornament with spiral spokes from Shajing cemetery recalls a similar item from the Yanbulake cemetery. Ornaments with bird heads at each end found at the same cemetery of Shajing are identical to the bird-head ornament from the Chawuhugoukou cemetery. In Xinjiang, there are some ceramic types, burial features, and appar ent rituals that are similar to those from the eastern margins of central China. The parallels, however, are fragmented, sparse, and isolated. As far as the current information indicates, Xinjiang acquires little from the neigh boring provinces to the east in late prehistoric times. Xinjiang, in fact, may have influenced aspects of the ceramic styles to the east at a slightly later time. Only after the expansion of the Han empire at the second century B.C. did central Chinese cultural influence penetrate to the Talimu and Zhunge'er Basins. Xinjiang then entered the historic period. Directions for Further Research The Xinjiang region connects traditions of Eurasia through oasis and mountain sites, in an adaptation typical of Central Asia. We suggest that the earliest sedentary groups in Xinjiang subsisted on irrigation agricul ture?a model derived from the similar early oasis settlements in western Central Asia. Support for this model can be had only through further in vestigation of the organization and economy of the earliest settlements themselves. However, settlements in the desert areas of Xinjiang have been neglected primarily because of the disproportionate emphasis on the re covery of burials. This is clearly a consequence of the excellent preservation of the desert burials and their prominent marking by poles, rocks, and mounds (kurgans). The earliest sedentary populations in Xinjiang may have been pioneer settlers, rather than emerging from an existing "Neolithic" population. "Neolithic" remains are found in some regions of Xinjiang, however, sug gesting that a local population of hunters and gatherers may have also ex isted. We look forward to results of ongoing research on the relationship between the possible local populations and the early settlements. Two areas show particular promise: the southern rim of the Talimu basin (including the Lububo region) and the foothill and oasis region of eastern Xinjiang (Yanbulake, for example).</page><page sequence="48">290 Chen and Hiebert One major unresolved question is the relationship between Period 1 (Bronze Age) and Period 2 (Iron Age) in Xinjiang. Key issues in this shift are the rise of horse nomadism in the highlands and its effect on the low lands. Linguists (e.g., Mair and Skjaerv0, 1991; Parpola, 1995) suggest that the second period represents the introduction into Xinjiang of a new lan guage group?related to Saka languages?pushing older Indo-European speakers into isolated regions of Eastern Central Asia (Parpola, 1995). While there is evidence of long-term continuity of settlement in the oases, research on stratified sites will be able to address questions of continuity or discontinuity of the local cultures in the oases. It is not yet possible to evaluate the degree of interaction between the various oasis cultures, or between the oasis settlements and the less well-known highland pastoral sites. A distinctive characteristic of the sedentary cultures of Xinjiang is the handmade painted pottery. This feature develops in eastern Central Asia and can be found throughout the steppes of Kazakhstan to western Central Asia. This pottery may signal the impact of the eastern Central Asian cul tures on the distant cultures to the west. Whether this correlates with a specific adaptive or economic system is not clear. The evidence suggests that interaction between Xinjiang and its neigh bors is not directly with other sedentary centers of Eurasia but, rather, is with the highland pastoral populations which ring the Talimu and Zhunge'er basins. The prehistory of Xinjiang clearly holds considerable po tential for understanding Eurasian cultural interaction.
