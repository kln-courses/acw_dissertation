<plain_text><page sequence="1">Giacomo Leopardi's Art and Science of Emotion in Memory and Anticipation* John Alcorn I. Introduction Emotion in memory and anticipation is a crux of Giacomo Leopardi's work, in two complementary ways: (i) It is a central subject of his art and science, notably several fine poems in the Canti' and many fasci- nating notebook entries in the Zibaldone di pensieri.2 (ii) It is a central element in his understanding of his art, for he considers it a necessary cause of artistic creativity: "per l'invenzione [...] ci vuole [...] un in- flusso dell'entusiasmo passato o futuro o abituale, piuttosto che la sua presenza, e possiamo dire il suo crepuscolo, piuttosto che il mezzo- giorno" (Z 257-59, 3.X.1820). This article surveys Leopardi's repre- sentations of, and reflections upon, emotion in memory and antici- pation, and offers an interpretation of "Le ricordanze" (C 435-60), where the intertemporal dimensions of emotion are most relentlessly explored. * This article is for young Luca, who first got me thinking about the joys and pitfalls of anticipation. I have benefited from many discussions with Dario Del Puppo. Jon Elster generously commented on a draft of the manuscript; what errors remain are of course mine alone.

Elster explains this in the case of literature: "II grande vantaggio della let- teratura e che pu6 essere piu completa di qualsiasi descrizione fat- tuale, in quanto ci mostra il funzionamento interiore dei meccanismi emotivi, e non solo le loro apparenze esteriori" (p. 19). In this light, Leopardi's work is of special interest, for it closely integrates all the re- sources which combine realism and insight: the intuitions of the moralist, the independent plausibility of great literature, and pro- found introspection. True, as Elster notes, some works of literature are more useful than others in the study of emotions, and introspection is subject to specific kinds of distortion (pp. 12 and 20). I shall consider whether and how these notes of caution bear on the cognitive value of Leopardi's work in my concluding remarks. Juirgen Habermas's work suggests another reason why literature is an indispensable tool in the study of emotions. Language is often poorer than the world, and this is especially true of the vocabulary of the emotions. Authenticity can fail us, despite our sincerity: So long as we are dealing [...] with beliefs or intentions, that is, with cogni- tive acts, the question of whether someone says what he means is clearly a question of [...] sincerity. With desires and feelings this is not always the case. In situations in which accuracy of expression is important, it is some- times difficult to separate questions of sincerity from those of authenticity. Often we lack the words to say what we feel; and this in turn places the feel- ings themselves in a questionable light.5 Artists have special powers of imagination and description, enabling them to achieve authenticity in the expression and representation of emotions. 3 For a concise discussion of the several ways in which this claim might be taken, see Paisley Livingston, "Literature and Knowledge," in A Companion to Epistemology, ed. Jonathan Dancy and Ernest Sosa (Oxford: Blackwell, 1992), 255-58. 4 Piu tristi ma piu saggi? Razionalita ed emozioni, trans.

It, and indeed the Canti as a whole, are auto- biography in the form of poetry. Baroness Warnock explains what au- tobiography requires, and why it can be of special value: What [autobiography] needs is the search for truth, through memory and the interpreting imagination. For an individual truthfully explored [...] is more than just an individual. Because human beings are bound together by sympathy, the reflection in the glass is necessarily not of one person only. The common, the shared, and the general is to be found in the particular, if that particular is truthfully described, and with imagination. To discover such a common truth is an intrinsic good.6 The worry, then, is that the artist-autobiographer, who has special pow- ers of description and imagination, can achieve authenticity without sincerity. Is Leopardi's autobiographical poetry a search for truth, through memory and the interpreting imagination? Or does stylized presentation of self overstep sincerity and issue in distortion? I shall look for clues to Leopardi's sincerity by comparing his descriptions of particular autobiographical experiences in notebook entries and in "Le ricordanze." Further, is the reflection in the glass of Leopardi alone, or is it the discovery of a common truth?7 I shall discuss the ten- sion between the idiosyncrasy of Leopardi's self-portrait and our com- mon experience in my concluding remarks. The article is structured as follows. Section II mines the Zibaldone and the Canti for descriptions of psychological mechanisms8 which cluster and interact to shape emotion in memory and anticipation. 6 Mary Warnock, Imagination and Time (Cambridge, Mass.: Blackwell, 1994), p. 144; see also her article, "Memory: The Triumph over Time," MLN 109 (1994), 938-58. 7 For the notion of presentation of self (a species of dramaturgical action), see Haber- mas, Theory of Communicative Action, I, p. 86, and Erving Goffman, Presentation of Self in Everyday Life (New York, 1959). For a more general discussion of presentation of self in Leopardi, and of how Leopardi integrates presentation of self with discovery of a com- mon truth (what Habermas calls communicative action), see the companion piece to the present article: John Alcorn and Dario Del Puppo, "Giacomo Leopardi's 'La gine- stra' as Social Art," Modern Language Review 89:4 (October 1994), 865-88. 8 A particular causal pattern in experience or in behavior may properly be called a mechanism (or an effect) if and only if (i) it is plausible and (ii) one can cite several dif- ferent instances of it. "Explanation by mechanisms works when and because we can iden- tify a particular causal pattern that we can recognize across situations and that provides an intelligible answer to the question, 'Why did he do that?.'" (Jon Elster, "A Plea for Mechanisms" [unpublished manuscript], 5-6) The Leopardian mechanisms (or effects) identified in this article satisfy the requirement of plausibility (or so I think), but some of them are identified on the basis of an insufficient number of different instances. These are tentative identifications of mechanisms; I hope that further instances of them can be cited by others. 91</page><page sequence="4">JOHN ALCORN This Section follows Leopardi's method: "E da queste osservazioni si conferma quanto la fabbrica intellettuale dell'uomo sia semplice in natura, cioe composta di pochissimi elementi, che diversamente mo- dificati e combinati, producono infiniti e svariatissimi effetti" (Z 1,736- 37, 19.IX.1821). An effort is made to construct a precise and exhaus- tive taxonomy of these elements and mechanisms, and to place them in a general framework suggested by two of David Hume's metaphors of the mind (as theater and as republic) and by Elster's recent work on the emotions. Section III marshalls these resources and another of Hume's metaphors of the mind (as stringed instrument) to illuminate the emotions in "Le ricordanze." (The bare bones of the taxonomy constructed in Section II and of the Leopardian emotions identified in Sections II and III are listed in Table 1.) Section IV sets out some conclusions, and seeks to define and judge Leopardi as an artist. Along the way comparisons are drawn with Marcel Proust, Alfred Tennyson, Stendhal, Socrates, and William Wordsworth. II. Some Nuts and Bolts of Emotion in Memory and Anticipation A few general remarks about the emotions will be useful. Emotions have four characteristic features: The most striking feature of the emotions is their component of arousal. [...] Emotional experiences have three further properties. First, they have different qualitative, phenomenological properties. Second, they are in- herently positive or negative [... ].9 Third, [...] they are about something. Be- cause of the presence of arousal, qualitative feel, and inherent pleasantness or unpleasantness, the state of 'emoting that p' differs from other inten- tional states, such as the state of 'desiring that p' or 'believing that p.'10 Within the sphere of the emotions three criss-crossing distinctions will be useful: (i) Emotional dispositions differ from occurrent emo- tions. (I need not be envious or irascible to experience envy or anger.) Leopardi recognizes this distinction, and calls emotional dispositions "abituali" and occurrent emotions "attuali" (Z 4,489, 14.IV.1829). (ii) One can draw a distinction between core and non-core emotions: 9 Leopardi often describes emotions in terms which connote a broad distinction be- tween positive and negative emotions: he employs the adjective "dolce" to describe pos- itive emotions, and the adjective "acerbo" and "mi si stringe il core," "sento serrarmi il cor," and like expressions to describe negative emotions. 10Jon Elster, "Rationality, Emotions, and Social Norms," Synthese98 (1994) 21-49, 25- 26. Many emotions have a fifth characteristic feature: they involve "action tendencies." 92</page><page sequence="5">MLN 93 Table 1.

They derive from my experiences, not from those of other people. More- over, they relate to my current experiences, not to my past or future ones. Fi- nally, they derive from my actual experiences, not from those I may have or could have had. [...] The [non-core] emotions are in various ways parasitic on the core emotions. They arise from the contemplation of earlier, future or possible occasions for the core emotions, from the loss or lack of such occasions or from the experiences of other people.l1 Examples of core emotions are love, hate, delight, disgust, pride, and shame; examples of non-core emotions are hope, dread, nostalgia, re- gret, relief, disappointment, sympathy, envy, pity, and spite. (iii) One can draw a distinction between primary (or first-order) and higher-or- der emotions.12 (When I feel shame at feeling envy, I experience a sec- ond-order emotion about a primary emotion.) The Representational Self. Memory and anticipation raise the philo- sophical and psychological problem of personal identity. Hume employs a useful framework comprising two conceptions of the self, one repre- sentational, the other genetic. In the former, "The mind is a kind of the- atre, where several perceptions successively make their appearance; pass, re-pass, glide away, and mingle in an infinite variety of postures and sit- uations. There is properly no simplicity in it at one time, nor identity in dif- ferent."1'3 The person is then a sequence of selves; the present self relates to past and future selves by representing them. These representations cause occurrent emotions: "almost every kind of idea is attended with some emotion, [...] much more those of such objects as are esteem'd of consequence in life, and fix our attention" (II.II.X, 393). What follow are some kinds of mechanisms, and their specific Leopardian forms, which cement the representational self in memory and anticipation. Sympathy Hume suggests an analogy to mechanisms in social psychology: sym- pathy and self-centered comparison are basic mechanisms in social l Jon Elster, Nuts and Bolts for the Social Sciences (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1989), 62. 12 Elster, Piu tristi ma piu saggi? 30. 13 A Treatise of Human Nature, ed.

Further refer- ences to this edition appear in parentheses in the text. 94</page><page sequence="7">M LN psychology; similarly, sympathy and contrast with one's past and future selves are mechanisms shaping emotion in memory and anticipation (II.II.VIII, 376). Leopardi's description of "la dolcezza dell'aspettativa" illustrates the workings of sympathy in anticipation: "l'uomo va im- maginando e contemplando seco stesso a parte a parte il godimento ch'egli attende o spera, e prova diletto nel considerare e rappresen- tarsi il modo in che egli ne godra, e le sue qualita e condizioni e cir- costanze, anticipando ed anzi assaporando effettivam. colla immagi- nazione mille volte il piacer futuro" (Z 3,504, 23.IX.1823). The fact that emotions are inherently positive or negative in their qualitative feel suggests a broad definition of sympathy, in which the present emo- tion is merely of the same sign as the remembered or anticipated emo- tion which triggers it. There are thus four sympathy effects: positive sympathy in memory; negative sympathy in memory; positive sympa- thy in anticipation (foresavoring or hope); and negative sympathy in anticipation (dread or apprehension). Leopardian magnification in sympathy. Leopardi finds that sympathy involves a particular kind of distortion, non-core magnification of the core experience: "Come nella speranza o in qualunque altra dispo- sizione dell'animo nostro, il bene lontano e sempre maggiore del pre- sente, cosi per l'ordinario nel timore &amp; piui terribile il male" (Z 105, 26.III.1820). He elaborates upon magnification in positive sympathy: La rimembranza del piacere, si puo paragonare alla speranza, e produce ap- presso a poco gli stessi effetti. Come la speranza, ella piace piu del piacere; &amp; assai piu dolce il ricordarsi del bene (non mai provato, ma che in lon- tananza sembra di aver provato) che il goderne, come &amp; piu dolce lo sperarlo, perch6 in lontananza sembra di poterlo gustare. La lontananza giova egualmente all'uomo nell'una e nell'altra situazione; e si puo conchiu- dere che il peggior tempo della vita &amp; quello del piacere, o del godimento. (Z 1,044, 13.V.1821) The paradox is rhetorical, for he notes in the previous quotation that magnification also occurs in dread, making the non-core experience worse than the core one. In any case, much of his work celebrates pure positive sympathy in memory and anticipation, laments its elusiveness, and explores the mechanisms which undermine it. Contrast Contrast effects are opposed in sign to the remembered or anticipated emotions which trigger them: "Thus the prospect of past pain is agree- 95</page><page sequence="8">JOHN ALCORN able, when we are satisfy'd with our present condition; as on the other hand our past pleasures gives us uneasiness, when we enjoy nothing at present equal to them" (Hume, II.II.VIII, 376). Like sympathy, contrast can be either positive or negative and can occur in memory or antici- pation.'4 Leopardi describes his (altogether unexuberant) disposition to experience positive contrast in anticipation: l'imminenza del male, accresce il piacere del presente, [...] come in alcuni tempi ch'io aspettava un male imminente, e diceva a me stesso; ti resta tanto a godere e non piu, e mi rannicchiava in me stesso, cacciando tutti gli altri pen- sieri, e soprattutto di quel male, per pensare solamente a godere, non ostante la mia indole malinconica in tutti gli altri tempi, e riflessivissima. Anzi forse questa accresceva allora l'intensita del godimento, o della risoluzione di godere. (Z 299, 23.X.1820) He describes negative contrast in memory in "A Silvia" and "Le ricor- danze" (see below). Reverberation Hume notes the phenomenon of reverberation in social interaction: "the minds of men are mirrors to one another, not only because they reflect each others emotions, but also because those rays of passions, sentiments and opinions may be often reverberated, and may decay away by insensible degrees" (II.II.V, 365). Similarly, emotions can re- verberate in memory and anticipation, causing higher-order emo- tions.15 We find this in "A Silvia" (C 423-33), where Leopardi expresses a complex negative emotion in memory of anticipation. The emotion also involves negative contrast in memory (11. 28-35): Che pensieri soavi, Che speranze, che cori, o Silvia mia! Quale allor ci apparia La vita umana e il fato! Quando sowiemmi di cotanta speme, Un affetto mi preme Acerbo e sconsolato, E tornami a doler di mia sventura. Reverberation can contribute to a synoptic vision of one's stream of 14 For a systematic extension of Hume's framework, see Jon Elster and George Loewenstein, "Utility from Memory and Anticipation," in Choice Over Time, ed.

We shall see that the particular structures of reverbera- tion which characterize Leopardi's sensibility reveal a radically decen- tered self. Mixed Mechanisms Hume notes that sometimes emotions, "especially reflective ones, [...] like colours, may be blended so perfectly together, that each of them may lose itself, and contribute only to vary that uniform impression, which arises from the whole" (II.II.VI, 366). He also notes, however, that contrasting emotions form a heterogeneous mix rather than a blend: "If the relation be more imperfect, and consists in the con- tradictory views of the same object, the passions are like oil and vine- gar, which, however mingled, never perfectly unite and incorporate" (II.III.IX, 443).16 Unblended emotions are the stuff of Leopardi's poetry of memory and anticipation. Several are identified in the Zibal- done. Dual effects. Sympathy and contrast can occur jointly, producing an ambiguous emotion, a "dual effect."17 Positive sympathy can combine with negative contrast, negative sympathy can combine with positive contrast, and each combination can occur in memory or anticipation. A particular dual effect, positive sympathy and negative contrast in memory, which can be called the bittersweet effect in memory, is a cen- tral subject in "Le ricordanze" (see below, Section III). Decentered dual effects. These are caused by the joint occurrence of a mechanism in memory and a mechanism of contrary sign in anticipa- tion. We find one at work in "Alla luna" (C 287-92,11. 10-16): [...] E pur mi giova La ricordanza, e il noverar l'etate Del mio dolore. Oh come grato occorre Nel tempo giovanil, quando ancor lungo La speme e breve ha la memoria il corso, I1 rimembrar delle passate cose, Ancor che triste, e che l'affanno duri! 16 Elster writes: "E difficile dire se questi siano insiemi o miscugli. Almeno la nostal- gia, per6, sembra possedere una certa qualita agrodolce che suggerisce che si tratti di un'emozione vera e propria, e non semplicemente del simultaneo accadere delle emozioni che la compongono" (Elster, Piu tristi ma pit saggi? 32). 17 See Amos Tversky and Dale Griffin, "Endowment and Contrast in Judgments of Well-Being," in Strategy and Choice, ed. RichardJ. Zeckhauser (Cambridge, Mass.: MIT Press, 1991), 297-318, 298. 97</page><page sequence="10">JOHN ALCORN Here foresavoring overmatches negative sympathy in memory, pro- ducing a mixed emotion which can be called hopeful enjoyment of painful memory. The emotion is decentered, for contrast occurs by comparing a past self to a desired and expected future self. (Another decentered dual effect, in which negative contrast in memory over- matches hope, is discussed below.) Saturation of the imagination. Leopardi describes two mechanisms, the vividness effect and the flooding effect, which tinge occurrent emotions with positive feelings of saturation of the imagination. Each occurs in memory. Leopardi describes how the vividness effect bright- ens negative sympathy in memory: Siccome le impressioni, cosi le ricordanze della fanciullezza in qualunque eta, sono piut vive che quelle di qualunque altra eta. E son piacevoli per la loro vivezza, anche le ricordanze d'immagini e di cose che nella fanciullezza ci erano dolorose, o spaventose ec. E per la stessa ragione ci e piacevole nella vita anche la ricordanza dolorosa, e quando bene la cagion del dolore non sia passata, e quando pure la ricordanza lo cagioni o l'accresca, come nella morte de' nostri cari, il ricordarsi del passato ec. (Z 1,987-88, 25.X.1821) In the flooding effect, association produces a pleasurable flood of memories: "Quello che ci desta una folla di rimembranze dove il pen- siero si confonda, e sempre piacevole" (Z 1,777, 23.IX.1821). This mechanism explains the importance of shared memories in discover- ing a common truth in art: il fanciullo il quale per necessita ha poche rimembranze [...] deve trovar poco dilettevoli e belle molte bellissime parti delle piu grandi poesie. Cosi dico delle diverse professioni, abitudini ec. le quali diversificando le rimem- branze secondo gl'individui, diversificano ancora l'effetto delle diverse poe- sie ec. e delle loro parti, e quindi anche il giudizio che gl'individui ne pro- nunziano. (Z 1,799, 28.IX.1821) Subjunctive Emotions Memory and anticipation often produce subjunctive emotions,18 which integrate the representational self by comparing the actual world to an imagined world suggested by present beliefs and desires. Illusioni. What Leopardi calls "illusioni" can be classed among the subjunctive emotions. Leopardi makes several arguments to the effect that negative illusioni have a greater place in emotional life than do positive illusioni (see, for example, Z 458, Z 3,433-34, and Z 4,123). My 18 Elster and Loewenstein, 219. 98</page><page sequence="11">M LN favorite is a notebook entry in which he explains that fearing the worst is a stronger mechanism than wishful thinking: Se tu hai un nemico mortale nella tal citta e vedi che v'e sopra un tempo- rale, ti passa pur per la mente la speranza ch'egli ne possa restare ucciso? Or come dunque ti spaventi se quel temporale viene sopra di te, quando la probabilita ch'egli uccida 6 tanto piccola che tu non ci sai neppur fondare quella cosa che ha pur bisogno di si poco fondamento per sorgere in noi, dico la speranza? [...] I1 timore e dunque piui fecondo d'illusioni che la spe- ranza. (Z 66; see also Z 1,303-4.) Leopardian impatience. Leopardi explains that uncertainty and desire can interact in anticipation to cause negative emotions of impatience and angustia, emotions different from those caused by foresavoring and contrast, and worse than resignation: Non e forse cosa che tanto promuova l'attivita e l'impazienza di ottenere il fine che si desidera, quanto l'incertezza di ottenerlo, quando per6 questo vi prema, e l'idea di non ottenerlo vi attristi. [...] tu spasimi di liberarti dal- l'angustia che ti deriva dal dubbio di non riuscire ad un fine che tu desideri grandemente. Angustia alla quale forse preferirai la certezza di non poterlo conseguire. (Z 369-70, 1.XII.1820; see also Z 76). There is also a (more complicated and indirect) chain linking cer- tainty in anticipation to impatience (see below). Impatience in turn can cause excess action, thwarting one's goals; Leopardi suffers this ef- fect in the process of artistic creativity: "E cosi la stessa mia impazienza poteva pregiudicare al fine, togliendomi il riposo necessario ec. Cosi nel comporre ec." (Z 370, 1.XII.1820). Counterfactual emotions. Another class of subjunctive emotions in- volves counterfactual thinking of one kind or another. Basic counter- factual emotions are: rejoicing and regret, triggered by comparing what is and what might have been; surprise and disappointment, trig- gered by comparing what is and what was anticipated; and nostalgia, in Leopardi the wistful desire for [...] quel dolce E irrevocabil tempo, allor che s'apre Al guardo giovanil questa infelice Scena del mondo, e gli sorride in vista Di paradiso. [...] ("La vita solitaria," C 315-35, 11. 44-48) Leopardi depicts regret as a most painful emotion, especially so in the case of remorse: "Nessun dolore cagionato da nessuna sventura, e paragonabile a quello che cagiona una disgrazia grave e irremediabile, 99</page><page sequence="12">JOHN ALCORN 100 la quale sentiamo ch'e venuta da noi, e che potevamo schivarla, in somma al pentimento vivo e vero" (Z 188, 28.VII.1820). In "II passero solitario" (C 267-69) Leopardi anticipates a negative counterfactual emotion in memory, intimating dread of remorse (11. 58-59): Ahi pentirommi, e spesso, Ma sconsolato, volgerommi indietro. Elsewhere he describes his peculiar, deliberately inward manner of rejoicing, rooted in the belief that the expression of joy undermines the emotion: "Quelle rare volte ch'io ho incontrato qualche piccola fortuna, o motivo di allegrezza, in luogo di mostrarla al di fuori, io mi dava naturalmente alia malinconia, quanto all'esterno, sebbene l'in- terno fosse contento. Ma quel contento placido e riposto, io temeva di turbarlo, alterarlo, guastarlo, e perderlo col dargli vento" (Z 460, 27.XII.1820). His manner of rejoicing entails a radical division of pri- vate and public self, and extends the close connection of melancholy and stylized presentation of self from poetry to life. It might also in- volve hyperrationality; I shall consider this possibility in Section IV. Leopardian sense offinality. In childhood, Leopardi formed and cul- tivated an idiosyncratic disposition to experience a keen sense of fi- nality. He remembers it coloring his cognitive appraisal of acquain- tances' departures: Io dunque da fanciullo aveva questo costume. Vedendo partire una per- sona, quantunque a me indifferentissima, considerava se era possibile o probabile ch'io la rivedessi mai. Se io giudicava di no, me le poneva intorno a riguardarla, ascoltarla, e simili cose, e la seguiva o cogli occhi o cogli orec- chi quanto piui poteva, rivolgendo sempre fra me stesso, e addentrandomi nell'animo, e sviluppandomi alia mente questo pensiero: ecco l'ultima volta, non lo vedro mai piut, o, forse mai piui. (Z 644-45, 11.II.1821 ) He generalizes this to a gripping sense of caducitd in "La sera del di di festa" (C 275-85,11.24-33): [...] Ahi, per la via Odo non lunge il solitario canto Dell'artigian, che riede a tarda notte, Dopo i sollazzi, al suo povero ostello; E fieramente mi si stringe il core, A pensar come tutto al mondo passa, E quasi orma non lascia. Ecco e fuggito I1 di festivo, ed al festivo il giorno Volgar succede, e se ne porta il tempo Ogni umano accidente. [...]</page><page sequence="13">M LN The sense of finality causes a painful shadow emotion in memory: "La ricordanza del passato, di uno stato, di un metodo di vita, di un sog- giorno qualunque, anche noiosiss., abbandonato, e dolorosa, quando esso e considerato come passato, finito, che non e, non sara piu, fait" (Z 4,492, 21.IV.1829; see also Z 4,278 and Z 4,282). The Genetic Self. One's past emotions can also shape one's present emotions without being represented in the mind, if there is a causal chain linking them to the present. By contrast, future emotions can- not shape present emotions, only representations of future emotions can. This asymmetry suggests a genetic self. Hume writes: "memory does not so much produce as discover personal identity, by shewing us the relation of cause and effect among our different perceptions" (I.IV.VI, 262). He captures the genetic self in another metaphor, liken- ing the mind to a republic rather than a theater: As the same individual republic may not only change its members, but also its laws and constitutions; in like manner the same person may vary his char- acter and disposition, as well as his impressions and ideas, without losing his identity. Whatever changes he endures, his several parts are still connected by the relation of causation. And in this view our identity with regard to the passions serves to corroborate that with regard to the imagination, by the making our distant perceptions influence each other, and by giving us a pre- sent concern for our past or future pains or pleasures. (I.IV.VI, 261) What follow are three kinds of mechanisms, and their specific Leo- pardian forms, which cement the genetic self over time. Engraining An experience (or set of experiences) can change one's emotional dis- positions. Consider the difference between a mechanism cementing the representational self, for example sympathy, and engraining: If I shudder when I remember a painful failure, I experience negative sympathy in memory; if a painful failure takes the zest out of life, I ex- perience negative engraining in my emotional dispositions. We shall see in Section III how the dashing of Leopardi's youthful hopes, es- pecially the frustration of his yearning for love, had massive engrain- ing effects, radically changing the emotions he experienced in mem- ory an(1 anticipation. In "Al conte Carlo Pepoli" (C 377-98) Leopardi expresses disillu- 101</page><page sequence="14">JOHN ALCORN sioned nostalgia, and predicts that memory of youthful illusions will always occasion this emotion. He thus seems to intimate a reverbera- tive emotion, dread of nostalgia for illusioni (11. 121-26): [...] Io tutti Della prima stagione i dolci inganni Mancar gia sento, e dileguar dagli occhi Le dilettose immagini, che tanto Amai, che sempre infino all'ora estrema Mi fieno, a ricordar, bramate e piante. Elsewhere he notes that the bittersweet effect in memory contributes to melancholy, a complex emotion with a subjunctive thrust and sub- stantial implications for poetry: "Certo e pero che tali lontane rimem- branze, quanto dolci, tanto separate dalla nostra vita presente, e di genere contrario a quello delle nostre sensazioni abituali, ispirando della poesia ec. non ponno ispirare che poesia malinconica, come e naturale, trattandosi di ci6 che si e perduto [...]" (Z 1,861, 7.X.1821). (The vividness of youthful experiences makes them a privileged sub- ject, further engraining the tendency to a melancholy poetics.) Coupling Mechanisms Leopardi is also fascinated by chains or couplings of emotions which he discovers in introspection. Some of these chains link particular emotions at particular moments, and can thus be termed local. Oth- ers link emotional dispositions over the course of a life, and can thus be termed global. What follow are some couplings identified by Leo- pardi. The opponent process.19 In this mechanism negative emotions are fol- lowed by positive emotions, and vice versa, in a process of physiologi- cal equilibration. A strong form is described in "La quiete dopo la tem- pesta" (C 483-91, 11. 32-36): Piacer figlio d'affanno Gioia vana, ch'e frutto Del passato timore, onde si scosse E pavent6 la morte Chi la vita aborria; 19 See notably R. L. Solomon and J. Corbit, 'The Opponent-Process Theory of Ac- quired Motivation: The Costs of Pleasure and the Benefits of Pain," American Psychologist 35 (1980), 691-712; and Elster and Loewenstein, 222-23. 102</page><page sequence="15">M LN Apprehension followed by relief is a local opponent process, which leaves one's emotional dispositions unchanged. In "I1 risorgimento" (C 399-421) Leopardi describes a global opponent process, involving changes in his emotional dispositions which define whole periods in his life, with massive engraining effects. He describes a sequence of hopeful wistfulness (11. 1-8); frustration (11. 9-32); despair (11. 33-36); a conjunction of blanket insensibility, absence of desire, and serenity (11. 34-80) ;20 and reawakening of wistfulness and sensibility, now shorn of hope (11. 81-160).21 Leopardi identifies two local aftereffects of irrational hope. (i) The excess hope effect. In this chain Leopardian magnification in sympathy causes excess foresavoring, followed by disappointment and remorse: Osservate ancora che dolor cupo e vivo sperimentavamo noi da fanciulli, terminato un divertimento, passata una giornata di festa ec. [...] il nostro dolore [...] era inconsolabile, non tanto perche il piacere fosse passato, quanto perche non avea corrisposto alla speranza. Dal che seguiva talvolta una specie di rimorso o pentimento, come se non avessimo goduto per no- stra colpa. (Z 529-30, 20.1.1821) (ii) The naive hope effect. In this chain failure to anticipate anticipation causes naive foresavoring, followed by noia and dread. I look forward to tomorrow as a pure day (today is brightened by tomorrow's imag- ined light), but when it comes I find myself already in the shadow of the next day. This staggered mismatch of expectation and experience is described in "I1 sabato del villaggio" (C 493-501), where Leopardi at- tributes naive hope not only to youth but to putatively unreflective peasants and artisans (11. 38-42): Questo di sette e il piui gradito giorno, Pien di speme e di gioia: Diman tristezza e noia Recheran l'ore, ed al travaglio usato Ciascuno in suo pensier fara ritorno. 20 This period of Leopardi's life was thus characterized by a lack of emotion. Elster writes: "Creatures without emotions would have no reason for living, nor, for that mat- ter, for committing suicide" (Nuts and Bolts for the Social Sciences, 61); Leopardi appears to have approximated this condition for a period. 21 In a notebook entry he gives a different account of the resultant relationship be- tween hope and desire: "La privazione di ogni speranza, succeduta al mio primo in- gresso nel mondo, appoco appoco fu causa di spegnere in me quasi ogni desiderio. Ora, per le circostanze mutate, risorta la speranza, io mi trovo nella strana situazione di aver molta piu speranza che desiderio, e piu speranze che desiderii ec." (Z 4,301, 19.1.1828). "Il risorgimento" was composed shortly thereafter, 7-13 April 1828. 103</page><page sequence="16">JOHN ALCORN Learning Emotions may be shaped, for better and for worse, by one's growth in knowledge. It will be useful to distinguish between non-reflexive and reflexive learning effects. In the former, knowledge of X has a spillover effect on Y. We find this in "I1 risorgimento," where Leopardi explains that his disposition to hope is blocked by knowledge of "l'infausta ve- rita" (1. 116). The knowledge he describes is of things other than his emotional dispositions; it is of Nature's indifference to human well- being, of humankind's lack of pity, and of his historical isolation (11. 119-32). In reflexive learning, knowledge of X has a feedback ef- fect on X itself. What follow are some Leopardian reflexive learning effects, in which his knowledge of particular mechanisms shaping emotion in memory and anticipation has feedback effects on his emo- tional dispositions. Leopardi explains that knowledge of the excess hope effect has two reflexive effects, one positive, one negative: (i) Prospective resignation. Knowledge of the excess hope effect can neutralize it, by inducing prospective resignation: "Giacch&amp; l'esperienza non ci aveva ancora istruiti a sperar poco, preparati a veder la speranza delusa, assuefatti a consolarci facilmente di tali e maggiori perdite ec." (Z 529-30, 20.1.1821). (ii) Reflexive impatience. The same knowledge can have a negative reflexive effect; knowledge of a negative effect of foresavor- ing can have a negative effect on foresavoring. Leopardi reports that knowledge of the excess hope effect tinges foresavoring with impa- tience: "Sovente ho desiderato con impazienza di possedere e gustare un bene gia sicuro, non per avidita di esso bene, ma per solo timore di concepirne troppa speranza, e guastarlo coll'aspettativa" (Z 319, 11.XI.1820; see also Z 76 and Z 369-70). Notice that he distinguishes excess emotion in anticipation from excess desire. The reflexive mech- anism he describes substitutes impatience (a negative emotion in an- ticipation) for excess hope (a positive emotion in anticipation which causes negative emotional aftereffects). He wonders whether this re- flexive mechanism has become engrained in his dispositions: E questa tale impazienza [...] veniva da riflessione, ma naturalmente, nel tempo ch'io andava fantasticando e congetturando sopra quel bene o diletto. E cosi anche naturalmente proccurava di distrarmi da quel pen- siero. Se per6 l'abito generale di riflettere, o vero l'esperienza e la rifles- sione che mi aveano gia precedentemente resa naturale la cognizione della vanita dei piaceri, e la diffidenza dell'aspettativa, non operavano allora in me senz'awedermene, e non mi parvero natura. (Z 319, 1 I.X. 1820; see also Z79) 104</page><page sequence="17">M LN Disillusioned nostalgia. Engraining and learning both contribute to a fundamental Leopardian emotion, disillusioned nostalgia. Experi- ence mutes hope, which thus finds itself overmatched by negative con- trast in memory (a decentered dual effect). Awareness of the limits to hope causes Leopardian nostalgia: Ma provata quella felicita che ho detto, e perduta, le speranze non bastano piu a contentarci, e la infelicita dell'uomo e stabilita. Oltre che le speranze dopo la trista esperienza fatta sono assai piui difficili, ma in ogni modo la vivezza della felicita provata, non pu6 essere compensata dalle lusinghe e dai diletti limitati della speranza, e l'uomo in comparazione di questa piange sempre quello che ha perduto e che ben difficilmente pu6 tornare, perche il tempo delle grandi illusioni &amp; finito. (Z 85) Praecarpe diem. In "II sabato del villaggio" Leopardi, having described the workings of naive hope, suggests that ignorance is bliss, and im- plies that knowledge of the naive hope effect destroys foresavoring (11. 43-51): Garzoncello scherzoso, Cotesta eta fiorita E come un giorno d'allegrezza pieno, Giorno chiaro, sereno, Che precorre alla festa di tua vita. Godi, fanciullo mio; stato soave, Stagion lieta &amp; cotesta. Altro dirti non vo'; ma la tua festa Ch'anco tardi a venir non ti sia grave. After knowledge there is no carpe diem, there is only a weary "seize the day before." III. "Le ricordanze" "Le ricordanze" has long been appreciated as one of the finest pieces of Italian blank verse; in Giosue Carducci's words, it is "favellato e sospirato melodicamente; proprio, novo, moderno; lo sciolto, in somma, del Leopardi."22 What has not been noticed by critics is the poem's interest as Leopardi's fullest and most integrated expression of, and reflection upon, emotion in memory and anticipation. The 22 "Degli spiriti e delle forme nella poesia di Giacomo Leopardi. Considerazioni" [1898], in Opere di Giosue Carducci, 22 vols. (Bologna: Nicola Zanichelli, 1920-29), XVI, 261-360, 346. 105</page><page sequence="18">JOHN ALCORN poem was composed between 26 August and 12 September 1829. It comprises 173 verses in the meter of endecasillabi sciolti, and is divided into seven sections according to shifts in Leopardi's addressee, in nar- rative time and grammatical tense, and in subject matter. The setting is Palazzo Leopardi in Recanati, where the poet looks upon the night from his bedroom window and ruminates. The imagery principally in- volves vivid description of perceptions, experiences, attitudes, and emotions. There is minimal use of metaphor, with a crucial exception: Nerina in the final section of the poem. The poem is largely a stylized presentation of self, supported by altercasting a series of addressees and enlarged at points to include on-stage outcasting. Leopardi's ad- dressees are all anthropomorphic, except for Nerina. The artist who explores memory and anticipation owes the reader an account of what occasions (spontaneous) memory and anticipation in the first place. Why are some past or future experiences rather than others represented in the theater of the mind by the present self? Leopardi employs the image of the spring of memory: "molte volte accade che una leggerissima circostanza, quasi movendo una molla della nostra memoria, ci richiami idee e ricordanze anche lontanis- sime, senza nessuno intervento della volonta [...]" (Z 184, 24.VI.1820; see also Z 1,454-55). Hume remarks: "The thinking on any object read- ily transports the mind to what is contiguous; but 'tis only the actual presence of an object, that transports it with a superior vivacity" (I.III.VIII, 100). Marcel Proust describes a mechanism involving both "una leggeris- sima circostanza" and "the actual presence of an object." He tells how a chance reacquaintance with an object of experience saturated with childhood associations (the tasting of little cakes known as Petites Madeleines with tea) raises "l'6difice immense du souvenir."23 In the exordium of "Le ricordanze" Leopardi describes such a mechanism, 23 A la recherche du temps perdu, ed. Jean-Yves Tadie, 3 vols. (Paris: Editions Gallimard, 1987), I, 46. Though Leopardi and Proust give remarkably similar explanations of spon- taneous memory and descriptions of the flooding effect, they differ greatly in their larger interpretations of and responses to these experiences. Unlike Leopardi (whose interpretation and response are explored in this Section), Proust infers that the self ex- ists outside of time, a belief which brings him joy and serenity: "Cela expliquait que mes inquietudes au sujet de ma mort eussent cess6 au moment of j'avais reconnu incon- sciemment le gofit de la petite madeleine puisqu'a ce moment-la l'etre que j'avais ete etait un etre extra-temporel, par consequent insoucieux des vicissitudes de l'avenir." (ibid., IV, 450). For a concise exposition and criticism of Proust's philosophy of the self, see Jonathan Dancy, "New Truths in Proust?" Modern Language Review 90:1 (January 1995), 18-28, 26. 106</page><page sequence="19">M LN locating the spring of memory in an unanticipated renewal of a child- hood experience (11. 1-6): Vaghe stelle dell'Orsa, io non credea Tornare ancor per uso a contemplarvi Sul paterno giardino scintillanti, E ragionar con voi dalle finestre Di questo albergo ove abitai fanciullo, E delle gioie mie vidi la fine. With sureness of touch, Leopardi shows us-he does not tell us-that memory is occasioned by a conjunction of three feelings in tension with one another: a sense of familiarity, a sense of surprise, and a sense of (existential) difference. The vividness and solitude of the setting contribute to the effect, making Leopardi's beholding of the stars a catalyst to memory as suggestive as Proust's tasting of the Petites Madeleines. The adjective "vaghe" immediately connotes his life-cycle theory of perception and memory: Da fanciulli, se una veduta, una campagna, una pittura, un suono ec. un rac- conto, una descrizione, una favola, un'immagine poetica, un sogno, ci pia- ce e diletta, quel piacere e quel diletto e sempre vago e indefinito [...]. La massima parte della immagini e sensazioni indefinite che noi proviamo pure dopo la fanciullezza [...] non sono altro che una rimembranza della fanciullezza [...] (Z 514-15, 16.I.1821) The unanticipated renewal of a childhood experience triggers the flooding effect, calling forth a memory world of everyday, solitary plea- sures and intoxicating horizons. Employing the past tenses, he depicts an anthropomorphic world and describes a feeling for Nature which embraces a sense of mystery, immensity, and fantasy; a feeling which eludes the conventional distinction between the beautiful and the sub- lime. Leopardi's memories quickly take on complex structures. In 11. 19-24 he shifts to memory of foresavoring and wistfulness: [...] E che pensieri immensi, Che dolci sogni mi spir6 la vista Di quel lontano mar, quei monti azzurri, Che di qua scopro, e che varcare un giorno Io mi pensava, arcani mondi, arcana Felicita fingendo al viver mio! Suddenly he juxtaposes a memory of the blackest subjunctive emotion (11. 25-27): 107</page><page sequence="20">JOHN ALCORN Ignaro del mio fato, e quante volte Questa mia vita dolorosa e nuda Volentier con la morte avrei cangiato. In these sets of verses he remembers his experience of non-core emo- tions, but does not describe the present emotions he feels at these memories. Alone, yet at home and confident in the world, suspecting neither the finality of his joys nor his deep despair to come: this is the mature Leopardi's memory of innocence. The second section (11. 2849) shifts to the present narrative time and tense. An intimate contrast is drawn to the first section: solitude becomes social isolation, and community with home and Nature becomes alienation from a cramping provincial backwater, souring Leopardi's emotional dispositions (see also Z 4,489, 14.IV.1829). He enlarges the structure of dramaturgical action by outcasting the towns- people of Recanati. Unedifying emotions (contempt, spite, hatred, vanity, and pride) real and imagined shape a vicious dialectic between him and the towspeople (11. 28-43; see also Z 273-74, 14.X.1820, where Leopardi tells how the townspeople of Recanati in their ignorance sys- tematically misjudge his worth as artist and philosopher): Ne mi diceva il cor che l'eta verde Sarei dannato a consumare in questo Natio borgo selvaggio, intra una gente Zotica, vil; cui nomi strani, e spesso Argomento di riso e di trastullo, Son dottrina e saper; che m'odia e fugge, Per invidia non gia, che non mi tiene Maggior di se, ma perch6 tale estima Ch'io mi tenga in cor mio, sebben di fuori A persona giammai non ne fo segno. Qui passo gli anni, abbandonato, occulto, Senz'amor, senza vita; ed aspro a forza Tra lo stuol de' malevoli divengo: Qui di pieta mi spoglio e di virtudi, E sprezzator degli uomini mi rendo, Per la greggia ch'ho appresso [...] There are two processes of perverse social interaction intertwined in Leopardi's picture: (i) The townspeople's initially mistaken beliefs (about Leopardi's beliefs about them) finally become self-fulfilling. (ii) The townspeople's failure to reciprocate his hypocrisy corrodes his character. The implication seems to be that the townspeople are to blame for his isolation and for his social emotions. Comparison with 108</page><page sequence="21">M LN the Zibaldone, however, casts doubt on the reliability of (at least aspect (i) of) his picture. In a brilliant notebook entry about the limits of dis- simulation and strategic action he writes: "la finzione tende a nascon- der la natura, ma questa trapela ad ogni momento, in dispetto d'ogni massima, d'ogni volonta, d'ogni disciplina." (Z 4,195-96, Bologna 3.IX.1826) In the same entry he also describes cracks in his mask: "ve- dutomi poi per le circostanze, uguale a molti e superiore ad alcuni; da principio benignissimo ed umile cogl'inferiori, sono poi divenuto verso loro un poco esigente, un poco intollerante." It therefore seems more plausible that the townspeople saw through his mask from the beginning, and that their emotions towards him always rested in part on true beliefs about his beliefs about them. Why does he give a dis- torted picture in "Le ricordanze"? One explanation is intentional: Leopardi, wishing not only to express his social emotions, but to jus- tify them, too, engages in deliberate misrepresentation. Another is psy- chological: "A crucial fact about the emotions is that they have the ca- pacity to alter and distort the cognitive appraisal that triggered them in the first place. The object of an emotion is the emotionally distorted picture of its cause."24 Which is closer to the truth, I hesitate to say. There is, however, a consideration which supports the intentional explanation: it is doubtful that Leopardi would compose a poem without keeping in mind relevant entries from the Zibaldone. His social isolation causes a "lack of self": "chi si vede disprezzato da' conoscenti e da tutti coloro che lo circondano, e quindi necessaria- mente e privo della stima di se medesimo, non puo provar godimento alcuno, non pu6 vivere, a dir proprio: perche questo tale veramente manca di se medesimo nella vita" (Z 4,438-39, 17.1.1829). I conjecture that Leopardi's disposition to experience decentered emotions in memory and anticipation was due in part to the socially caused lack of self. Leopardi concludes this section by addressing youth as she slips away, "O dell'arida vita unico fiore" (11. 43-49). (A similar metaphor is the unifying image in "La ginestra o il fiore del deserto," where it re- sembles the noble life and poetry rather than youth.)25 In the third section (11. 50-76) Leopardi ruminates with no definite addressee. The section opens with a temporal elision, as the wind- borne clang of the town clock calls forth a memory of childhood night 24 Elster, "Rationality, Emotions, and Social Norms," 27. 25 See Alcorn and Del Puppo, "Giacomo Leopardi's 'La ginestra' as Social Art," Sec- tion VI. 109</page><page sequence="22">JOHN ALCORN terrors (11. 50-55). (Here Leopardi revisits a memory described in an early notebook entry: Z 36.) Now he takes the Leopardian step, pass- ing from description of remembered emotion to description of pre- sent emotion in memory. He describes a mixed emotion (11. 55-60): [...] Qui non e cosa Ch'io vegga o senta, onde un'immagin dentro Non torni, e un dolce rimembrar non sorga. Dolce per se; ma con dolor sottentra 11 pensier del presente, un van desio Del passato, ancor tristo, e il dire: io fui. This emotion has several elements: a dual effect involving positive sym- pathy ("dolce per se") and negative contrast in memory ("con dolor sottentra il pensier del presente"); painful nostalgia ("un van desio del passato, ancor tristo"); and an extreme form of Leopardian sense of finality ("io fui"). Insofar as some of the memories are of painful child- hood experiences, "dolce per se" might also refer to the vividness ef- fect which brightens such memories. The emotion is bittersweet: the memory is sweet, the aftertaste bit- ter. The flow and friction of this sequence of positive sympathy and negative contrast in memory exemplify another of Hume's metaphors for the mind: Now if we consider the human mind, we shall find, that with regard to the passions, 'tis not of the nature of a wind instrument of music, which in run- ning over all the notes immediately loses the sound after the breath ceases; but rather resembles a string instrument, where after each stroke the vi- brations still retain some sound, which gradually and insensibly decays. The imagination is extreme quick and agile; but the passions are slow and restive: For which reason, when any object is presented, that affords a vari- ety of views to the one, and emotions to the other, tho' the fancy may change its views with great celerity; each stroke will not produce a clear and distinct note of passion, but the one passion will always be mixt and confounded with the other. (II.III.IX, 44041) Leopardi then complements the outdoor pleasures remembered in the exordium with warm memories of an array of solitary indoor plea- sures. He remembers how echoes and reflections and representations of Nature in human artifacts were sensuous, if indirect, stimuli to his imagination; whereas in the exordium he remembers how Nature her- self and the voices of life were direct stimuli. He remembers the ubiq- uity of potent illusion in the emotional tonality of his youthful experi- ences (11. 65-67): 110</page><page sequence="23">M LN [...] allor che al fianco M'era, parlando, il mio possente errore Sempre, ov'io fossi. [...] The section ends with an evocation of innocence, likening youth's great expectations to those of an inexperienced lover (a mask for him- self), foreshadowing the theme of the concluding section. In section four (11. 77-103) Leopardi turns to address hope, ac- knowledging an obsessional memory of this emotion (11. 77-81): O speranze, speranze; ameni inganni Della mia prima eta! sempre, parlando, Ritorno a voi; che per andar di tempo, Per variar d'affetti e di pensieri, Obbliarvi non so. [...] The themes of this section are the association of hope and youth; the illusory, insubstantial nature of honor, glory, and objects of desire; the poet's present despair; and his ambivalent attitude towards death. The narrative time begins in the present, as Leopardi expresses sub- junctive emotions of disappointment and lingering frustration, emo- tions caused by negative contrast in memory and by comparing what he anticipated to what is and to what little he now anticipates (11. 87-94): [...] Ahi, ma qualvolta A voi ripenso, o mie speranze antiche, Ed a quel caro immaginar mio primo; Indi riguardo il viver mio si vile E si dolente, e che la morte e quello Che di cotanta speme oggi m'avanza; Sento serrarmi il cor, sento ch'al tutto Consolarmi non so del mio destino. The narrative time then shifts to the future. One might have expected Leopardi to turn and describe emotion in anticipation. Instead, leap- ing to a vantage point beyond anticipation, he describes a striking, dis- turbing emotion which, he predicts, he will experience in memory on the threshold of death (11. 95-103): E quando per questa invocata morte Sarammi allato, e sara giunto il fine Della sventura mia; quando la terra Mi fia straniera valle, e dal mio sguardo Fuggira l'awenir; di voi per certo Risowerrammi; e quell'imago ancora Sospirar mi fara, farammi acerbo 111</page><page sequence="24">JOHN ALCORN L'esser vissuto indarno, e la dolcezza Del di fatal temperera d'affanno. Though the text describes a future emotion, it may be understood, I think, to connote an implicit element of (present) emotion in antici- pation. If this be granted, then the composite emotion involves rever- beration and reflexiveness, as Leopardi intimates mixed emotions in anticipation of mixed emotions in memory (and in anticipation of the end of anticipation ("dal mio sguardo fuggira l'awenir")). He predicts the same bittersweet emotion the present experience of which he de- scribes in 11. 55-60. He also predictsjoint experience of wish-fulfillment ("questa invocata morte sarammi allato") and wish-frustration (frus- tration of his desire for love), and an attendant emotion of bitter re- gret ("farammi acerbo l'esser vissuto indarno"). (Implicit) emotion in anticipation is marred by a negative reflexive effect in which knowl- edge of the bittersweet effect in memory adds an element of dread to what would otherwise be foresavoring. This peculiarly complex Leo- pardian emotion can be called foresavoring of deliverance, tempered by dread of regret. It introduces an extreme form of decentering, in- volving a subtle but important shift from anticipation to pure predic- tion of self. In section five (11. 104-18) the poet returns to the narrative time of memory and to the past tense, addressing no one. Reworking the myth of Narcissus, he tells how he longed to be done with the inner turmoil of contrasting emotions by drowning himself in a well (11. 104-9): E gia nel primo giovanil tumulto Di contenti, d'angosce e di desio, Morte chiamai piu volte, e lungamente Mi sedetti cola su la fontana Pensoso di cessar dentro quell'acque La speme e il dolor mio. [...] In an early notebook entry, however, he gives a different picture of pre- sumably the same experience. There the memory is of a fantasy in an- ticipation, involving a deliberate brush with death as a means for in- ducing the euphoria of relief: lo era oltremodo annoiato della vita, sull'orlo della vasca del mio giardino, e guardando l'acqua e curvandomici sopra con un certo fremito, pensava: s'io mi gittassi qui dentro, immediatamente venuto a galla, mi arram- picherei sopra quest'orlo, e sforzatomi di uscir fuori dopo aver temuto as- sai di perdere questa vita, ritornato illeso, proverei qualche istante di con- tento per essermi salvato, e di affetto a questa vita che ora tanto disprezzo, e che allora mi parrebbe piu pregevole. (Z 82) 112</page><page sequence="25">MLN In the notebook entry Leopardi essentially remembers trying to engi- neer the strong form of opponent process he describes in 11. 32-36 of "La quiete dopo la tempesta" ("Piacer figlio d'affanno [...]," quoted above, Section II). It is doubtful that the euphoria of relief can be at- tained in this way; Leopardi's project of planning his stream of emo- tions is hyperrational, an early expression of the excess of reason which distorts and decenters his mature emotional life. I shall return to this idea in Section IV. In the remainder of section five he describes an ironic sequence of events, in which unactuated desire for physical death was followed by physically caused death of hope: he recalls the ruin of his health and the spiritual death it wrought. In an unsettling image, he describes the intimate connection between his awakening as a poet and the devel- opment of an emotional disposition anchored in radically non-core emotions: as he became a poet he sang himself a dirge (11. 113-18): [...] all'ore tarde, assiso Sul conscio letto, dolorosamente Alla fioca lucerna poetando, Lamentai co' silenzi e con la notte I1 fuggitivo spirto, ed a me stesso In sul languir cantai funereo canto. In section six (11. 119-35) he remains in the narrative time of mem- ory, but switches to the grammatical present, addressing a hymn to the flower of youth. He returns to the social dimension of section two, drawing an implicit, poignant contrast. Here he sketches the charms of good will reserved by all only for those in the flower of youth, when girls smile, envy holds her peace, and mistakes are forgiven-in retro- spect a fleeting moment. Striking a universal note, the poet then won- ders: Is the loss of youth not our common affliction? In evoking com- mon memory he integrates presentation of self and communicative action (discovery of a common truth); as noted above in Section II, he considers common experience a catalyst of vividness and flooding in memory, which are necessary conditions for appreciating a work of art (Z 1,799, 28.IX.1821). In the conclusion (11. 136-73) he speaks to the ghost of Nerina, a girl for whom he had experienced an innocent love, now a grim image of departed, unfulfilled youth. He begins by reproaching himself for the self-centeredness of his memories (11. 136-38): O Nerina! e di te forse non odo Questi luoghi parlar? caduta forse Dal mio pensier sei tu? [...] 113</page><page sequence="26">JOHN ALCORN Overcoming his self-absorption, he evokes Nerina's experiences and dwells on her death. The sense of finality is extended to include a sense of the finality of another person's experience, accentuating the non- core modality of this emotion (11. 166-69): Ogni giorno sereno, ogni fiorita Piaggia ch'io miro, ogni goder ch'io sento, Dico: Nerina or piui non gode; i campi, L'aria non mira. [...] In the final lines of the poem Leopardi comes full circle to a subject of the exordium, the causes of spontaneous memory, and identifies a trigger very different from the Proustian-Humean one described in the first lines of the poem. He predicts that henceforth broad kinds of imagination and emotion will trigger memory-memory accom- panied by negative emotion ("rimembranza acerba" (1. 173).) This shadow emotion may be called Leopardian grief. Awareness of the per- manence of his grief has a negative reflexive effect, implicitly tingeing anticipation with dread (11. 169-73): [...] Ahi tu passasti, eterno Sospiro mio: passasti: e fia compagna D'ogni mio vago immaginar, di tutti I miei teneri sensi, i tristi e cari Moti del cor, la rimembranza acerba. Leopardi thus closes the poem by returning to the extreme form of decentered emotion which he introduced in section four, pure pre- diction of self. The poem thus involves a synoptic point of view. It naturally invites comparison with Alfred Tennyson's verses ("In Memoriam A. H. H.," XXVII, 11. 13-16):26 I hold it true, whate'er befall; I feel it, when I sorrow most; 'Tis better to have loved and lost Than never to have loved at all. To rephrase Tennyson's thought in the idiom of this article, the expe- riences of love and of positive sympathy in memory of love, taken to- gether, outweigh the experience of negative contrast in memory of 26 The Poems of Tennyson, ed.

Though Leo- pardi vividly conjures the pleasures of youthful hope and innocent love and the "dolce per se" of recollecting them, he also dwells on a tangle of largely negative emotions and concludes the poem on a bleak note. What the net effect is, he does not say. Tennyson voices a con- viction, at once deep ("I hold it true, whate'er befall") and strong ("I feel it, when I sorrow most"), that the net effect is positive.28 I suspect that those elements of Leopardi's philosophy which Sebastiano Tim- panaro calls "pessimistic materialism" incline Leopardi in the opposite direction.29 Perhaps the common lesson of Tennyson's verse and of "Le ricor- danze" is simply that there are qualitative couplings between the emo- tions, whatever the quantitative balance. As Elster notes, to enjoy hope without courting disappointment, or love without suffering grief when a loved one dies, is not our nature.3? (Where Elster describes, Ten- nyson prescribes: "Let Love clasp Grief lest both be drowned" ["In Memoriam A. H. H.," I, 1. 9 (p. 319).]) I believe, however, that Leo- pardi wishes to draw our attention to another, less obvious coupling between emotions. Picture for a moment the relations between hope and disappointment and between love and grief as standard couplings, and set them side by side, parallel to each other. (See Figure 1.) With this picture in mind, the point of "Le ricordanze," I think, is to give ex- pression to a non-standard, "diagonal" coupling between hope and grief. Nerina is a complex figure, at once an object of love and a metaphor for the hopeful self of youth. Leopardi's grief for Nerina is thus also a metaphor for a larger grief, Leopardian grief, grief for ex- pired hope and for the irretrievable self of youth. The metaphor is es- tablished over several sections of the poem: sections one and three conjure Leopardi's lost self of youth, in the grip of"il possente errore"; 27 Elster and Loewenstein, 220. 28Jon Elster draws a related distinction between strong and deep convictions: "We may also differentiate between strong and deep convictions, where the former are char- acterized by their ability to shape action and the latter by their ability to remain stable in a turbulent environment."

Conclusions Leopardi Poet of Decentered Emotion. To conclude I wish to sug- gest three theses. The first is that Walter Binni's authoritative descrip- tion of Leopardi, "poeta delle generose illusioni e della eroica per- suasione,"32 though apt indeed as far as it goes, must be extended to include another dimension of comparable importance. For Leopardi is also poet of decentered emotion in memory and anticipation. His art and philosophy reveal and embrace a decentered self. We have seen that he identifies several decentering mechanisms; he also makes 31 A similar metaphor, with a different narrative structure, provides the basic elements of "A Silvia," a shorter poem written on 19-20 April 1828, sixteen months before "Le ri- cordanze." In "A Silvia," the representation of Silvia and of her death precedes the rep- resentation of the death of hope. In "Le ricordanze," the order of exposition is reversed. Moreover, in "A Silvia" love is represented as an object of hope for both Silvia and Leo- pardi. In "Le ricordanze," Nerina is represented as an object of love for Leopardi. 32 Walter Binni, "Leopardi poeta delle generose illusioni e della eroica persuasione," in Leopardi, Tutte le opere, ed.

One is reminded of the fable of the fox and the grapes, in which the fox comes to believe that the ripe grapes he cannot reach are sour.33 Leopardi goes further than the fox, however, and generalizes his adap- tive beliefs and preferences into a (pseudo-empirical) argument in philosophical anthropology. This is not to say that he is generally vul- nerable to the sour grapes mechanism. If this were so, then we would find him (unintentionally) devaluing the youthful hopes which are now beyond his reach, thus escaping the grip of Leopardian grief (which, we have seen, is caused by negative contrast in memory of the irretrievable, cherished hopes of youth). (Leopardi's predicament is that the sour grapes mechanism-devaluing the hopes of youth- would not necessarily improve his subjective well-being, for it would also undermine the positive component of the bittersweet effect, the "dolce per s6" caused by sympathy in memory of cherished hope.)34 Leopardian sour grapes is thus yet another decentering mechanism, for it only affects beliefs and preferences about the present, leaving memory and anticipation unaffected. Leopardi Poet of the Perverse Effects of Reason. The second thesis is that Leopardi, though a critic of reason, suffers from an excess of reason. He urges that the proper task of reason is to minimize reason: "II miglior uso ed effetto della ragione e della riflessione, e distruggere o minorare nell'uomo la ragione e la riflessione, e l'uso e gli effetti loro" (Z 1,162-63, 13.VI.1821). And he often remarks on the negative effects of reason; for example: "Quest'abito [l'attendere ed il riflet- tere] &amp; la principal fonte della miseria si del mondo, per le verita ch'esso scuopre, si dell'individuo" (Z 1,434, 1.VIII.1821; see also Z 183) and "Ecco il bello effetto della riflessione: impedir l'azione; la 33 SeeJon Elster, Sour Grapes: Studies in the Subversion of Rationality (Cambridge: Cam- bridge University Press, 1983), ch. 3. 34 These and other interactions among sympathy, contrast, and sour grapes are iden- tified and sharply illustrated by the jilted lover's predicament in Elster, "A Plea for Mech- anisms," 10. Leopardi's elision of hope and love and his coupling of hope and grief make his predicament much like the jilted lover's. 117</page><page sequence="30">JOHN ALCORN confidenza; l'uso di se stesso, e delle sue forze; tanta parte di vita" (Z 1,063-64, 19.V.1821; see also Z 1,998-99). He makes a number of re- marks about rationality and the emotions. Under the rubric "Supe- riorita della natura sulla ragione, dell'assuefazione (ch'e seconda natura) sulla riflessione" he describes how he overcame an irration- al fear of sounds of firings by means of chance habituation rather than rational cultivation of his emotional dispositions; he concludes: "Quello che non pu6 in niun modo la riflessione, pu6 e fa l'irrifles- sione" (Z 3,518-20, 13.IX.1823). Other remarks on the effects of ratio- nal appraisal of negative emotions present a more complex picture. He tells how, when in the grip of some negative emotion, he was able to diminish it by carefully considering the pointlessness of the suffer- ing it caused him (Z 4,201-2 and 4,225, Bologna 21 and 29.IX.1826). Yet he also explains that rational appraisal of regret (a particular neg- ative emotion) has a perverse effect, compounding the emotion: "noi ci consoliamo e ci diamo pace quando ci persuadiamo che quel bene non era in nostra balia d'ottenerlo, ne quel male di schivarlo, e per6 cerchiamo di persuadercene, e non potendo, siamo disperati, quan- tunque il male in tutti i modi si rimanga lo stesso" (Z 65). Despite his critique of reason he cannot escape a specific mani- festation of reason, negative reflexive learning effects in emotion. Socrates propounded the remarkable and influential belief that the unexamined life is not worth living. Against this must be set the fact that Leopardi, having lived the examined life, acquiring deep self- knowledge, thought the examined life not worth living. It is true that there is some room and much need for rational cultivation of the emo- tions, in order that our emotions be appropriate and help us flourish; but this is an elusive goal, and one more readily accomplished in edu- cation than in autonomous adult character planning.35 What is per- haps less recognized, despite our occasional judgment that ignorance is bliss, is that the examined life may be fraught with perverse effects, producing dispositions to inappropriate emotions and personal mis- ery. Leopardi's Canti, particularly "Le ricordanze," illustrate this well, for they eloquently represent what can be called negative Socratic ef- fects in emotion in memory and anticipation. In a notebook entry expressing remorse at the life he led, Leo- 35 For excellent short discussions of rationality and the emotions, see C.

[...] Chi tende p. natura all'amore del metodo, della solitudine, della quiete, fugga queste cose piui che gli altri, o attenda a temperarle co' lor contrarii, se vuol poter veramente esser quieto. Al che lo aiutera poi il giudicare e pensar filosoficamente delle cose e dei casi umani. (Z 4,259-60, 24.III.1827) In his remorse Leopardi has insight. Serenity, self-respect, and spon- taneity elude those who strive for them, but with luck may befall those who direct their projects towards the world rather than towards the self. They are "states that are essentially by-products."36 (Religious be- lief can also help secure at least some of these goods; but a discussion of Leopardi and religious belief is beyond the scope of this article.) There is a danger of overdrawing the perverse effects of reason in Leopardi's predicament. Part of the story must be constitutive luck. His early emotional dispositions and powers of imagination made him prone to unusually intense and abstract hopes and loves, which, given the couplings which exist between emotions, placed him in the way of correspondingly intense feelings of disappointment, frustration, noia, and remorse. Insight into these couplings did not so much improve his dispositions as complicate them, making him prone to impatience, disillusioned nostalgia, and grief. Constitutive emotional dispositions, experience, reason, and imagination interacted to produce a vicious spiral of decentered emotion-and the raw material of brilliant auto- biographical poetry. Leopardi and Obsessional Art. The final thesis is a response to the question, What is the cognitive value of Leopardi's art and science of emotion in memory and anticipation? Elster notes a number of possi- ble limits to the value of literature and introspection in the study of emotions. Some authors are more reliable than others: Tra i romanzieri, per esempio, non solo Walter Scott e Eugene Sue, ma persino Balzac e Dickens sono troppo ossessionati dal pittoresco e dal melo- drammatico per offrire dei ritratti di personaggi degni di fede. Invece di usare i loro scritti come fonte di ispirazione e per correggere le idee che ab- biamo sulla vita emotiva, dobbiamo utilizzare delle idee che abbiamo svilup- 36 See Elster, Sour Grapes, ch. 2. 119</page><page sequence="32">JOHN ALCORN pato indipendentemente da essi per accertare la plausibilita dei loro per- sonaggi. (Piu tristi ma piu saggi? 12). Are the depictions of emotional life in the Canti plausible? Many are stylized presentations of self; Leopardi is by far the most developed character in the Canti. The plausibility of the depictions of emotional life is therefore largely a matter of the authenticity of Leopardi's presentation of self. The ring of authenticity is surely a reason why many poems in the Canti command wide and enduring appreciation. Nonetheless, an author can only illumine those emotions which he or she knows intimately.37 It would be wrong to look to Leopardi for deep insights into emotions of which he had limited experience; for exam- ple, envy and anything more than innocent and abstract love. He was thoroughly familiar, however, with backward- and forward-looking emotions, emotions about loss and lack, delight, and sympathy; these emotions are the stuff of much of what is most fascinating and moving in the Zibaldone and the Canti. Another worry is that introspection is subject to distortion. One cause of distortion is the component of arousal which is part and par- cel of emotional experience; accurate introspection is difficult when one is in the grip of an emotion.38 Perhaps higher-order emotions in memory and in anticipation of primary emotions usually involve less arousal, and hence less distortion in introspection, than do primary emotions. Leopardi's remark, quoted above in Section I, that creativ- ity requires the twilight of emotion rather than its meridian, supports this intuition. I am not entirely confident of this intuition, however, for some higher-order emotions may well involve a strong component of arousal. Another cause of distortion can be called the bias of artifice in memory. As Stendhal notes: "I1 est tres difficile de peindre ce qui a et6 naturelen vous, de memoire; on peint mieux lefactice, le joue, parce que l'effort qu'il a fallu faire pour jouer l'a grave dans la memoire."39 I confess that I find it hard to judge how deeply the bias of artifice in memory distorts Leopardi's introspection. However that may be, there are subtle, but clearly identifiable elements of yet another kind of dis- tortion, which sometimes occurs when Leopardi passes from the Zi- baldone to the Canti. Comparison of notebook entries and "Le ri- cordanze" indicates that Leopardi reworks and changes some experi- 37 Elster, Piu tristi ma piu saggi? 20. 38 Elster, Pitt tristi ma piu saggi? 20. 39 Oeuvres Intimes, ed. V. Del Litto (Paris: Gallimard, 1981), 2 vols., I, 267 (cited after Elster, Piu tristi ma piu saggi? 20.) 120</page><page sequence="33">M LN ences; in particular, his interaction with the townspeople of Recanati (Z 4,195-96 and 11. 28-43) and his childhood fantasy about almost drowning himself (Z 82 and 11. 104-9). Is this self-deception or artistic licence? Perhaps it is more than a coincidence that these are rework- ings of experiences which, as we find them described in the Zibaldone, plainly involve lefactice and lejoue; perhaps there is a causal connection of some kind between the bias of artifice in memory and the distor- tion of self-deception or artistic licence. We can now come full circle to Baroness Warnock's account of the requirements and value of autobiography. With respect to the re- quirement of sincerity, the upshot of my discussion of distortion is that, in ways which we can specify but not entirely sort out, Leopardi's au- tobiographical poetry is in some measure less (and therefore also more) than a search for truth, through memory and the interpreting imagination. With respect to the intrinsic good of discovering a com- mon truth in the individual reflection in the glass, who will doubt the value of Leopardi's autobiographical poetry? Even so, we must give the shared and the particular, and the tension between them, each their due. It is perhaps useful to note that Sebastiano Timpanaro, the au- thor who has most deeply explored the cognitive value of Leopardi's art, asks this kind of question about another of Leopardi's central sub- jects, the human condition in Nature. Leopardi's treatment of this sub- ject, like his poetry of memory and anticipation, is rooted in individ- ual experience; but it is in large part less explicitly autobiographical. Timpanaro emphasizes the moment of common truth: [...] l'esperienza della deformita e della malattia non rimase affatto nel Leopardi un motivo di lamento individuale, un fatto privato e meramente biografico, e nemmeno un puro tema di poesia intimistica, ma divenne un formidabile strumento conoscitivo. Partendo da quell'esperienza sogget- tiva il Leopardi arriv6 a una rappresentazione del rapporto uomo-natura [...] che, per il fatto di essere personalmente sofferta e artisticamente trasfigurata, non perde nulla della sua 'scientificita'. ("Alcune osservazioni sul pensiero del Leopardi," 158) Where should the emphasis fall on the subject of the present article? Elster's work offers concepts that can help us get the balance right. When all is said and done there are two kinds of cognitive value in Leopardi's art and science of emotion in memory and anticipation. On the one hand, Leopardi identifies mechanisms which we can rec- ognize in our emotions, too. Elster writes: "One way in which art acquires value is by concentrating and isolating patterns of emotional experience that, although diffusely present in our life, require the 121</page><page sequence="34">JOHN ALCORN maieutic functions of art to come to our full attention."40 On the other hand, Leopardi reveals the idiosyncrasy of his emotional dispositions: "Le ricordanze" and several other poems in the Canti are obsessional works of art. Obsessional works of art [...], like Alexander Zinoviev's The Yawning Heights, Joseph Heller's Catch 22, or the paintings of Hieronymus Bosch and Fran- cis Bacon, are not in any way vitiated by their one-sidedness. On the con- trary, we appreciate these works (perhaps reluctantly) because they isolate and purify strands of experience that we usually fail (or do not want) to ac- knowledge.41 "Le ricordanze" isolates and purifies a peculiar strand of experience, made of complex, mixed, often decentered emotions in memory and anticipation of potent non-core emotions. To paraphrase William Wordsworth, art is also obsessional emotion in memory and anticipa- tion, recollected and anticipated in tranquillity.42 Trinity College, Hartford, Connecticut 40 "Fullness and Parsimony: Notes on Creativity in the Arts," in Explanation and Value in the Arts, ed. Salim Kemal and Ivan Gaskell (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1993), 146-72, 150. 41 "Fullness and Parsimony," 166. Elster makes a parallel argument about the cogni- tive value of the writings of the classical moralists: "Non leggiamo i moralisti per trarne delle informazioni sul comportamento umano medio ma per la loro comprensione delle reazioni emotive che spesso ci sfuggono perche non vogliamo vederle: sono troppo vicine a noi" (Elster, Piu tristi ma piiu saggi? 10). 42 "Poetry [...] takes its origin from emotion recollected in tranquillity: the emotion is contemplated till by a species of reaction the tranquillity gradually disappears, and an emotion similar to that which was before the subject of contemplation, is gradually pro- duced, and does itself actually exist in the mind. In this mood successful composition generally begins, and in a mood similar to this it is carried on [...]."
