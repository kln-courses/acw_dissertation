Once a poem of his has been published, later printings rarely exhibit that tinkering that has tempted so many of Kunitz's contempo- raries. Kunitz even claims not to have shown unfinished work to Theo- dore Roethke, doubtless the closest friend he has had among his fellow ♦Review of Stanley Kunitz, Next-to-Last-Things: New Poems and Essays (Boston: Atlan- tic Monthly P, 1985), hereafter NLT; and Gregory Orr, Stanley Kunitz: An Introduction to the Poetry (New York: Columbia UP, 1985). Work by Kunitz not in Next-to-Last- Things is cited from his collected editions, of poems: The Poems of Stanley Kunitz 1928- 1978 (Boston: Atlantic-Little, Brown, 1979): or of prose: A Kind of Order, A King of Folly: Essays and Conversations (Boston: Atlantic-Little, Brown, 1975), hereafter KOKF. I also draw on interviews with Kunitz by Robert Boyers, Contemporary Poetry in America: Essays and Interviews (New York: Schocken, 1974); Richard Jackson, Acts of Mind: Conversations with Contemporary Poets (U of Alabama P, 1983); and Seiden Rodman, Tongues of Fallen Angels (New York: New Directions, 1974).</page><page sequence="2">156 TERENCE DIGGORY poets. In 1975, however, Kunitz issued a collection of his prose, A Kind of Order, a Kind of Folly, protesting in the preface that "in the medium of prose a poet walks more naked than in his verse," but conceding that "he may as well own up" to the forces at work "behind the scenes of his performance." Readers of the collection were taken furthest behind the scenes in the concluding section, "Seedcorn and Windfall," which included passages from Kunitz's notebooks. One of these, evidently a "seedcorn," reappears in Kunitz's latest volume, Next-to-Last-Things, along with the poem that sprang from it, the vol- ume's centerpiece, entitled "The Wellfleet Whale." Comparison of the notebook entry with the poem affords a rare glimpse of Kunitz in the act of composition. In doing so, it also illuminates the problem most frequently cited to account for Kunitz's limited reputation: his rela- tively sparse production over a long career. Here is the notebook entry: A few summers ago, on Cape Cod, a whale foundered on the beach, a sixty-three-foot finback whale. When the tide went out, I approached him. He was lying there, in monstrous des- olation, making the most terrifying noises- rumbling- groaning. I put my hands on his flanks and I could feel the life inside him. And while I was standing there, suddenly he opened his eye. It was a big, red, cold eye, and it was staring directly at me. A shudder of recognition passed between us. Then the red eye closed forever. I've been thinking about whales ever since. Later I will offer evidence that Kunitz had in fact been "thinking about whales" from the beginning of his career, but we can date this stage of his thinking to about 1972. In The Testing-Tree, he had just published what is now one of his best-known poems, "King of the River," in which "you have looked into the eyes/ of your creature self," there in the form of a salmon. Then, in 1972, when Kunitz told Robert Boyers, "Right now I'm deep in whales," he discovered a like concern in the poetry of Robert Hass, which "is permeated," Kunitz explained, "with the awareness of his creature self, his affinity with the animal and vegetable kingdoms, with the whole chain of being" (KOKF). Kunitz honored Hass's achievement by selecting Field Guide for the Yale Younger Poets series. In his introduction to that volume, Kunitz</page><page sequence="3">Stanley Kunitz 's Braid of Creation 157 gave special attention to "On the Coast Near Sausalito," where a fish- erman stares into the eyes of "his squirming catch, that 'spiny monster' held in his hands," as Kunitz describes it (KOKF). Although "The Wellfleet Whale" shares similar aims, it lacks the focussed particularity of incident that comes through so strongly in Kunitz's description of Hass's poem. Especially in his poem's conclud- ing section, Kunitz expands his scope as far as the chain of being will stretch: Voyager, chief of the pelagic world, you brought with you the myth of another country, dimly remembered, where flying reptiles lumbered over the steaming marshes and trumpeting thunder lizards wallowed in the reeds. Despite the scale of the bodies this passage depicts, they produce little impression of physical force. What is lacking can be measured in com- parison with Robert Lowell's whale poem, "The Quaker Graveyard in Nantucket": Atlantic, where your bell-trap guts its spoil You could cut the brackish winds with a knife Here in Nantucket, and cast up the time When the Lord God formed man from the sea's slime And breathed into his face the breath of life, And blue-lung'd combers lumbered to the kill.1 The similarities in diction between this and Kunitz's passage indi- cate that diction alone will not explain the greater power of Lowell's lines. No doubt the greater anthropomorphism of the myth that Lowell employs, the longer line, the heavy, spondaic rhythm and the clotted assonance- all contribute to that power. But what most clearly distin- guishes Lowell from Kunitz in this instance is their different approach to the common device of apostrophe or invocation: to the whale, in Kunitz's case; to the ocean, in Lowell's. Each passage relies on the 'Robert Lowell, Selected Poems, rev. ed. (New York: Farrar, Straus, 1977), p. 10.</page><page sequence="4">158 TERENCE DIGGORY presence of the figure invoked to make present the more "mythic" object that stands behind it. Lowell's image of the winds proverbially thick enough to cut with a knife is itself an image of how tangibly present he makes his invoked figure. But Kunitz relies on mere abstract epithets; we do not feel the whale, hence we cannot feel its predeces- sors. In the case of a craftsman of such proven ability as Kunitz, this failure cannot be dismissed as merely accidental. Kunitz is fully aware, as he explained to Richard Jackson, that "one has to guard against letting the apostrophe become a merely rhetorical trick," a fair diagno- sis of the problem that seems to have arisen in "The Wellfleet Whale." Ironically, the suspicion with which Kunitz regards this rhetorical de- vice may so distance him from it that, when he uses it, it produces the very effects that he wishes to guard against. "The Wellfleet Whale" involves another problem, on a deeper level than the problem of style but related to it, as I hope eventually to make clear. It appears, in this case, that Kunitz is out of touch not only with his rhetoric, but with the sense of touch itself. Comparison of "The Wellfleet Whale" with the notebook passage from which it arose demonstrates how literally it can be said that Kunitz refuses the sense of touch, and how central that refusal is to the entire poem, not merely to a single passage lifted out of context. Of the three senses, hearing ("terrifying noises"), touch ("my hands on his flanks"), and sight ("staring directly at me"), with which the notebook passage records the encounter with the whale, the poem removes the most immediate sense, touch. Sight, too, is blurred, not only by describing the whale as blind, but by generalizing the human viewpoint to a vague "we," so that even if the whale can be felt to stare, that stare will not seem to be aimed "directly at me." Instead, the dramatic climax of the poem takes the following form: Toward dawn we shared with you your hour of desolation, the huge lingering passion of your unearthly outcry, as you swung your blind head toward us and laboriously opened a bloodshot, glistening eye, in which we swam with terror and recognition.</page><page sequence="5">Stanley Kunitz 's Braid of Creation 159 Although these lines emphasize pity rather than terror, a brief ob- servation made earlier in the poem suggests that, if the former emotion is based on identification with what the whale suffers, the latter emo- tion is based on identification with what causes the suffering: "Some- body had carved his initials/ in your flank." Evidently, this is what has become of the notebook's act of touch, "my hands on his flanks." Along with its attendant terror, that act has been deflected from the poem's climax. Moreover, it has been made anonymous, and deprived of some of its original immediacy by being transposed into the medium of writing, of which the act of carving is here, as elsewhere in Kunitz, a disturbing image. Further pursuit of Kunitz 's ambivalence toward touch should, then, further probe the ambivalence toward writing that may well be the underlying cause of Kunitz 's sparse production. We do not know, of course, how many poems Kunitz actually writes and judges to be un- worthy of publication. My point is that a more fundamental type of exclusion operates for Kunitz from the very beginning of the creative act. It gives a distinctive shape to what I would judge to be the best among the poems he has published. "River Road," for instance, de- clares its subject to be the failure of a marriage "on the eve of war," but it conveys the feeling of those traumatic events all the more powerfully by saying nothing more explicitly about them. And the culminating image of the creative act in this poem is not the planting of trees that occupies the middle section, but the return, years later, to "the woods I made," in defiance of a "No Trespass" sign. Insofar as the image of touch is an image of the creative act for Kunitz, it may appear as trespass, as in "The Wellfleet Whale," or as permission, as in "The Lincoln Relics," where Kunitz pictures him- self, searching for the prairie star, westward scanning the horizon for its eloquent and magnanimous light, yearning to be touched by its fire. The involvement of Lincoln in the poem and the style of this passage in particular point unmistakably to the poet of "Blind loving wrestling touch," Walt Whitman. That identification suggests in turn what Kunitz intends in other poems where a similar style performs less ironically,</page><page sequence="6">160 TERENCE DIGGORY not as an object of yearning but as a presumed achievement. He is attempting to write in the prophetic style of Whitman, one of whose hallmarks is elaborate invocation, as represented in the address to "touch" just quoted from "Song of Myself." The passage of invocation quoted earlier from "The Wellfleet Whale" is tied even more closely to Whitman through the grand parade of participles ("flying," "steam- ing," "trumpeting"), which marches also through the lines just quoted from "The Lincoln Relics" ("searching," "scanning," "yearning"). A related phenomenon, posing similar problems to Kunitz, is the piling up of adjectives exemplified in these lines from "The Magic Curtain": the precious rose-enameled box that held those chestnut-colored curls clipped from my sorrowing head when I was four. "Precious" and "sorrowing" seem unnecessary, especially in the con- text of the poem's narrative; the color epithets seem, both in form and placement, formulaic, mechanical. Similarly, in the opening section of "The Testing-Tree," despite the nearly mock-heroic turn here given to the grand style, the repeated use of an adjective as the penultimate word in the line gives the sense that the poet is merely filling in the blanks, and the repeated choice of two-syllable adjectives makes for rhythmical as well as syntactic monotony: hunting for perfect stones rolled out of glacial time into my pitcher's hand. Something in Kunitz will not permit him to commit himself to this style with the single-minded devotion with which Whitman, at his best, sus- tains its momentum. When Kunitz writes in this style, he is rarely at his best. In a recent essay on Whitman, reprinted in Next-to-Last-Things, Kunitz admits that the American bard once appeared "windy" in com- parison with the metaphysical poets under whose influence Kunitz wrote the poems of his first volume, Intellectual Things (1930). Those poems are characterized by a very different use of adjectives, often in unexpected combinations or unusual positions: "the tall revolving</page><page sequence="7">Stanley Kuniîz 's Braid of Creation 161 night" ("Change"); "I, tawny, wait" ("Twilight"). Such phrases avoid the dull mechanism I have just complained of, but their liveliness can appear nonetheless artificial, perhaps an attractive quality, to some tastes, but one that Kunitz decisively rejected in the remarkable trans- formation of style that is already apparent in some of the poems of his second volume, Passport to the War (1944). The artificiality of such phrases as I have quoted from the early work is a function not only of grammar but also of meaning. They swerve from the "straight" sense, as if to conceal it. The great shift in Kunitz 's style moves toward a greater directness of statement. The poems that benefit most from this shift, however, do not rely on the plenitude of statement that is the basic tenet of faith in Whit- man's grand style. Such brilliant lyrics as "The Portrait," "The Knot," or, from the latest volume, "The Snakes of September," are distin- guished by their brevity, and, as in the early verse, a reliance on what is not said. A devotion to silence thus points to a continuity of inspira- tion underlying the more superficial transformation of style, though the differences in style remain important. In the later poems, silence ap- pears not as a consequence of the concealment of meaning, but as the most adequate means for its expression under the threat of punishment for trespass. Just how adequate such expression could be is vividly portrayed in "The Portrait," which prohibits trespass in a double form that recalls the connection in "The Wellfleet Whale" between verbal expression and touch. No other work by Kunitz refers to the peculiar circum- stances of his upbringing in such specific detail as does "The Portrait." It describes the young Kunitz 's discovery of a portrait of his father, who committed suicide six weeks before Kunitz was born, in 1905. The poem parallels the concealment of the portrait by Kunitz 's mother with the locking away of the father's name "in her deepest cabinet." In response to the father's suicide, as Kunitz explained to Seiden Rodman, his mother "made the subject taboo. Not even his name could be men- tioned." Thus, the relationship between mother and son was formed partly on the basis of what they could not say to each other, but there was a further taboo that must surely share the same origin. His mother "was not one to demonstrate affection physically," Kunitz told Chris Busa; "in fact, I don't recall ever being kissed by her during my child- hood" (NLT). That prohibition reverberates throughout Kunitz 's po- etry, from the early poem "So Intricately Is This World</page><page sequence="8">162 TERENCE DIGGORY Resolved"- "Dare not to cover/ Her mouth with kisses"- to "The Game" that concludes The Testing-Tree- "No I don't want to be kissed." "Noli me tangerei is what/ 1 used to cry in Latin once," Kunitz recalls in "Journal for My Daughter," the poem that introduces the same volume. In "The Portrait," the taboo against physical contact breaks down under the pressure of maintaining the taboo against naming. When the son shows his mother the portrait he has retrieved from the attic, she ripped it into shreds without a single word and slapped me hard. The spareness of these lines indicates that the mother's lesson in com- munication "without a single word" was not lost on her son. Her very lack of expression constituted a form of expression, Kunitz came to realize. Despite her taboo against the touch of affection, he told Chris Busa, "I never doubted her fierce love for me." When that taboo was violated, as it is in the action "The Portrait" narrates, the touch thus released would seem especially fierce, though no less a sign of love. Similarly, the words that break through the corresponding taboo on naming to form the poem itself carry something of the force that had previously held them in check. To the child, perhaps, the mother's slap was felt as a punishment. But the sixty-four year old poet, who records in the poem's final lines, "I can feel my cheek/ still burning," is burn- ing with the fire that failed, in "The Lincoln Relics," to travel the distance from Whitman's prairie star. In his commentary on Kunitz 's collected poems, Gregory Orr makes "the quest for identity" central to his exposition. Accordingly, his reading of "The Portrait," which he deems "perhaps the pivotal poem in Kunitz's oeuvre," Orr credits the inspiration the poem cele- brates to the identification between father and son, for which the mother, elsewhere an obstacle, here becomes a vehicle, through her similar treatment of their faces. In itself, that treatment is the means by which the mother "reveals herself as the source of destructiveness, just as the father has always been the parental source of love," Orr con- tends. My disagreement with the contention should be evident from the alternative reading of the poem that I have just offered. Although Orr may be excused for his neglect of the important discussion of Kunitz's</page><page sequence="9">Stanley Kunitz 's Braid of Creation 163 mother in the Busa interview, first published while Orr's book was in preparation, one might have expected Orr, as a poet himself, to be more sympathetic to the principle that Kunitz elaborated as far back as 1962: that for poets, "the quest that gives their lives shape and mean- ing" is not the "quest for identity," but "the search for a style" (KOKF). Orr's neglect of that principle accounts for the relatively mi- nor status accorded to matters of style in his commentary. It accounts, also, for his undervaluation of the mother's role in that quest for iden- tity with which Orr is chiefly concerned. Orr's book abounds in illuminating observation. He focuses sharply on the detail of particular images, and responds to them sensi- tively. Frequently, however, he fails to reconcile his observations with the schema, based on the quest for identity, through which he attempts to provide a coherent account of the creative impulse that informs Kunitz's work overall. After a two-page excursus on "the theme of name and power" in Kunitz's poetry, for instance, Orr returns to "The Portrait" to marvel, "If the magic that gives the father's name physi- cal, vital being is powerful, then the mother's negating and confining power is even stronger." Orr makes no attempt to explain why that greater strength is not correspondingly more vital. The implied expla- nation is that, being negation, the mother's power cannot be "being," a rather metaphysical point that does not account for the intensely physi- cal experience of negation in the form of the mother's slap. In "The Knot," whose title, as Orr aptly observes, puns on "not," negation takes the form of castration, "the trauma/ of its lopping-off," surely a physical experience, although Orr, as if to distinguish it from the physical, calls it specifically "psychic." Given the negative role of the mother in "The Portrait," Orr has no trouble in tracing the castra- tion in "The Knot" to her agency. However, a more literal reading of that poem's title opens the possibility of a more positive role. The sap oozing through the knot-hole in a lintel post returns Kunitz's thought to the tree that was cut for the lumber, and inspires him to raise the tree through his imagination back into life, and himself into the tree. "I shake my wings and fly/ into its boughs," the poem concludes. After observing that "the final image of the self held within the boughs of the phallic tree of life has an earlier analogue in the image of the self 'curled' fetus-like in its web," Orr goes on to hypothesize: "In each the self is contained within a larger principle and we could almost say that they represent both feminine and masculine creative principles, though</page><page sequence="10">164 TERENCE DIGGORY as always in Kunitz, the masculine is most emphasized." Once again, Orr's system arbitrarily limits the feminine contribution to Kunitz's creativity, although Orr here makes greater allowance for the possibil- ity of such contribution than he did in discussing "The Portrait." Orr does not explain why the feminine power to "contain" might be posi- tive in "The Knot," while it appears as negative "confinement" in "The Portrait." Nor does he explain why "The Knot" opens with the identification ofthat power as the poet's own: "I've tried to seal it in." In "The Testing-Tree," the manner in which Kunitz presents what Orr calls "the phallic tree of life" would seem to offer more convincing support for Orr's contention that the creative principle in Kunitz's work is distinctively male. Orr points especially to a passage that describes the tree through a series of patriarchal images: the inexhaustible oak, tyrant and target, Jehovah of acorns, watchtower of the thunders, that locked King Philip's War in its annulated core under the cut of my name. Male potency, however, can hardly be ascribed unambiguously to King Philip, the Indian leader whose war against the early American colo- nists eventually led to his decapitation. In fact, as Orr observes, "King Philip's War is 'locked' in the tree just as the mother of The Portrait' iocked' Kunitz's father's 'name' in her deepest closet and would not let 'him' out." To follow through on the analogy, in "the Testing-Tree" the tree would appear maternal by functioning as a container, just as it did in "The Knot." And if, in "The Knot," the poet himself makes an attempt at containment, would not a further exercise in analogy suggest that he makes a similar attempt in "The Testing-Tree" by carving his name on the tree that locks in King Philip? Alternatively, if we insist, with Orr, on the phallic nature of the tree, would not the carving appear as a threat of castration, and thus identify the carver with the mother through another of the functions assigned to her in Orr's reading of "The Knot"? Either interpretation offers a plausible explanation for the</page><page sequence="11">Stanley Kunitz 's Braid of Creation 165 sense of trespass conveyed by the analogous carving of initials in "The Wellfleet Whale." At some points in his reading of "The Testing-Tree," though not consistently, Orr attempts to deal with the problem posed by King Philip by applying a distinction that is crucial to Orr's schema of the quest for identity. He aligns King Philip with the biological (self- destructive) or psychological (castrated) image of the father, in contra- distinction to a spiritual, transpersonal, or metaphysical father, who triumphantly embodies the male creative principle. Kunitz's task, ac- cording to Orr, is to avoid the fate of the former, and to identify with the latter. Although Orr sometimes presents this task as a move beyond psychology, when he discusses his sources it appears rather as a move from the psychology of Freud to that of Jung. "Kunitz is perhaps the first poet in the twentieth century," Orr boldly claims, "concisely to link the quest for identity to the insights (at first Freudian, later Jung- ian) of twentieth-century depth psychology." As a claim in literary history, Orr's statement seems mined with enough qualifiers to self-destruct upon close examination: how much weight must we give to "perhaps"? to "concisely"? Nevertheless, it is undeniable that Kunitz has participated in the process he himself de- scribes as poetry's "gradually forging a link with the new science of psychoanalysis" (NLT). The presence in his verse of "clinical themes and neurotic imagery," in the phrase of one reviewer, may have been a further impediment to the growth of Kunitz's reputation.2 For Orr, how- ever, the susceptibility of Kunitz's work specifically to Jungian analysis is evidence of psychological growth. By arguing, against Freud, that God is our father, Jung sought to introduce a spiritual alternative to the biological father who, in Freud's theory, seemed to command a perpet- ual re-enactment of the family romance. As Orr explains: "Jung, in his essay ' Freud and Jung- Contrasts,' criticizes Freud for his overempha- sis on the child's relation to the parents; he sees it finally as an entan- gling, sterile relationship from which Freud offers no means of escape, no avenue for growth." However, the assumption that the childhood condition is one from which escape is desirable does not seem to be shared by Kunitz. Compare his statement on Jung in a 1975 lecture, elided by Orr when he quotes from the passage: "Carl Jung has ob- served that 'no one can free himself from his childhood without first 2A.J.M. Smith, "Language of the Wound," Poetry 64 (1944): 166.</page><page sequence="12">166 TERENCE DIGGORY generously occupying himself with it,' but my own feeling is that the object is not so much to cut oneself off from one's past as to learn how to live with the child you were" (NLT). The family romance formed a very special configuration for the child Kunitz was. The father, including a step-father who died when Kunitz was fourteen, was conspicuous through absence. He could thus be identified all the more readily with Spirit, Orr conjectures. The Oedipal trap "normally" formed by the father-mother pair was thus left to the mother alone, and the Jungian goal of escaping that trap could be refocused as the need to escape the mother. Father images, Orr de- duces, will be "perceived as being actual or potential allies in Kunitz's quest for identity and his related effort to break free of the power of the maternal". This theoretical formulation accounts for Orr's reluctance to grant any positive influence to maternal power, even when his close observation of the poems uncovers evidence of such influence. In one instance, Orr's theory leads him to observe what is not there. In the one poem in which Kunitz deals explicitly with the legend of Oedipus, "The Approach to Thebes," Orr puzzles over the absence of any mention of Oedipus's father. The biographical circumstances just considered suggest the simple explanation that the father was absent when the young Kunitz was at the Oedipal stage; his mother did not remarry until he was eight. But Orr will not permit Oedipus to encoun- ter the terrors of the maternal without his spiritual ally, so he reassures us, "We know the father's death is one of the central mysteries even without its being mentioned." He then tentatively suggests an indirect allusion to the father in an image of phallic potency, "the color of my thrust," employed in Oedipus's sexualized encounter with the Sphinx. I do not know the full textual history of the poem, but I find it at least symbolic of the willfulness of Orr's reading that, in place of his "color," my edition of The Poems of Stanley Kunitz has the much more ambivalent "dolor." Denial of ambivalence is the key operation informing the structure of Orr's theoretical schema, which everywhere opposes pairs, rather than combining them: physical versus metaphysical, physical versus psychic, biological versus spiritual, female versus male. Acceptance of ambivalence, on the other hand, is the key to the structure of imagery in "The Approach to Thebes," particularly the image of the mother, who, unlike the father, is explicitly present in the poem. In keeping with Orr's reading of the mother throughout Kunitz's work, she ap-</page><page sequence="13">Stanley Kunitz 's Braid of Creation 167 pears here as the source of a castration threat. In a regressi vely infan- tile vision of intercourse with the mother, Oedipus sees himself as the slaughtered innocent, the virgin whose blood is ritually displayed on the conjugal sheets: Hail to the King of Thebes!- my self, ordained To satisfy the impulse of the worm, Bemummied in those famous incestuous sheets, The bloodiest flags of nations of the curse, To be hung from the balcony outside the room Where I encounter my most flagrant source. If the image of the sheets hung outside the room seems to blend with the image of Jocasta's hanging after the discovery of her incestuous union, it is because, in the guise of Oedipus, Kunitz has identified with the mother, as victim as well as aggressor, lover as well as Sphinx. Moreover, as the organ of aggression, the phallus belongs as much to the mother as it does to Oedipus. "The impulse of the worm" applies to one member of this pair no more exclusively than does the image of the sheets. The possibility of assigning the phallus to the mother neatly re- solves the complications that entangle Orr in his reading of the tree image in Kunitz's work. The image may well be phallic, and an em- blem of creative potency, but it need not be exclusively male. What lies at the root, quite literally, of Kunitz's tree image is revealed in "The War Against the Trees," in which trees threatened by suburban develop- ment are, while they stand, rather conventionally portrayed as "the great-grandfathers of the town." But to evoke the horror of a tree's uprooting, Kunitz shifts his imagery from the folksy to the mythic, from male to female, from grandfather to gorgon: Ripped from the craters much too big for hearts The club-roots bared their amputated coils, Raw gorgons matter blind, whose pocks and scars Cried Moon! on a corner lot One witness-moment, caught In the rear- view mirrors of the passing cars.</page><page sequence="14">168 TERENCE DIGGORY The rear-view mirror retains just enough resemblance to the shield of Perseus to confirm that the vision it captures is specifically that of the gorgon Medusa, whose power Freud traced to the image of the phallic mother. In her monstrosity she recalls the Sphinx of "The Ap- proach to Thebes," but when "the moon squanders its uranian gold," as the latter poem describes a condition glimpsed more quickly in "The War Against the Trees," the monster is also the object of desire. In the last line of "The Approach to Thebes," Oedipus boasts, "I made the monster me." Both "The Approach to Thebes" and "The War Against the Trees" appeared in the section of new work in the pivotal volume of Kunitz's career, the Pulitzer Prize- winning Selected Poems (1958), published in the year of Kunitz's third and, apparently, happiest marriage, six years after the death of his mother. Kunitz apparently felt free to examine the maternal source of his creative power more openly in that volume than he had done before, but the imagery thus exposed points once again to that continuity of inspiration, noted earlier in connection with Kunitz's style, that allows his earliest and his latest work to cohere as a single oeuvre. In his first volume, the poem "Prophecy on Lethe" produces something very like the image of Medusa in "The War Against the Trees," though in the earlier case it arises from submarine rather than subterranean depths: Anonymous sweet carrion, Blind mammal floating on the stream Of depthless sound, completely one In the cinnamon-dark of no dream - A pod of silence, bursting when the sun Clings to the forehead, will surprise The gasping turtle and the leech With your strange brain blooming as it lies Abandoned to the bipeds on the beach; Your jelly-mouth and, crushed, your polyp eyes. Staring into the eyes of this "blind mammal" exiled from its ocean home, and recalling Kunitz's latest volume, surely we recognize "The Wellfleet Whale," whose "desolation" is explicitly termed "mon- strous" in Kunitz's notebook. In the repulsive viscosity of the eyes,</page><page sequence="15">Stanley Kunitz 's Braid of Creation 169 along with the "jelly-mouth," in "Prophecy on Lethe," we can also recognize the prohibition against touch that influenced the evolution of "The Wellfleet Whale" from notebook to poem. In connection with "The Testing-Tree," I suggested that prohibition was reflected in the sense of trespass associated with the image of writing as carving, a version of the castration threat issuing from the mother. It would now appear that that threat issues from her because it is first directed at her; it is her "lack" that Kunitz's psyche needs most urgently to defend against, and that would be betrayed most decisively by the evidence of touch. In the configuration that links touch, carving, and castration to the act of writing, the mother informs not only the act itself but also the material written on, the victim as well as the aggressor, the sufferer as well as the cause of suffering. She is the tree, the whale, the page that contains the words but is overshadowed by them, unless we deliberately turn from the words to see the white space, to hear the silence that intervenes. In Next-to-Last-Things, Kunitz openly declares his ambition to speak for his mother by printing among his own essays an autobio- graphical piece, "My Mother's Story," which his mother composed at Kunitz's suggestion. Characteristically, she broke off her narrative at the point at which Kunitz's father entered her life. From the beginning of his career, Kunitz's poems have attempted to continue his mother's story while at the same time preserving her language, that is, her si- lence. The passage already quoted from "Prophecy on Lethe" provides an image of what was wanted: like the "anonymous" beast of that poem, the poem itself must eschew naming, must float like "a pod of silence," yet its very floating must attest to "the stream/ Of depthless sound" that it floats upon. Another poem from the same period, "Am- bergris," actually attempts to speak for the whale, yet the function it recognizes is more defensive than expressive: to Bathe every pulse in such an acid wit, That from my mammoth, cold, and featureless Event of age, my enemies will flee, Whereas my friends will stay and pillage me. This program helps to account for the "metaphysical" style of Kunitz's early poetry, which seems to deploy words as barriers around the cen- tral meaning they protect, but it does not offer a satisfactory version of</page><page sequence="16">170 TERENCE DIGGORY the silent language of the mother. Although words deployed in this style may defend silence, they constitute in themselves a form of naming, as Kunitz acknowledged. "Now the visor of my name is up," he boasted in "Vita Nuova," the concluding poem of Intellectual Tilings. In the succeeding volume, Passport to the War, the much-discussed poem "Father and Son" marks Kunitz's turn toward the later style that speaks for the mother more directly. Because Kunitz has continually returned to the style of naming, however, the juxtaposition of two styles in "Father and Son" offers a microcosm of the poet's career. In the nine lines of the son's address to the father, the style of naming is epitomized in the device of invocation, familiar from our examination of "The Wellfleet Whale." In "Father and Son," the invocation is less embellished, and thus rings more sincerely: " 'Father!' I cried, 'Re- turn!' " Nevertheless, Kunitz's ambivalence toward invocation registers even more clearly in the structure of "Father and Son" than it does in "The Wellfleet Whale." Although the son might seem to be speaking the father's language by employing the style of naming, the father him- self employs a very different language. He counters the son's rhetoric with silence, "spoken" in the poem's concluding lines, just before he disappears into a pond on whose shore the son has halted: "Among the turtles and the lilies he turned to me/ The white ignorant hollow of his face." Since this is the father's silence, we should not be too hasty in assimilating it to the silent language of the mother. Upon careful exami- nation, however, the poem appears to achieve just such an assimilation, subtly yet unmistakably. Kunitz's own commentary on the poem directs us to the importance of its silences: "With an intimate poem so much of the power is stored in the silences- those spacings between words and lines and thoughts- where the secret battle is being fought" (KOKF). Before the silence culminates in the vision of the father's face, its gradual accumulation is signalled in the son's remark on "The silence unrolling before me as I came." Thus, silence belongs not to the father alone, but to the entire setting of the son's encounter with the father, and we can recognize in that setting elements that are typical of the encounter with the mother. At a significant threshold, here marked by the pond's shoreline, the poem's persona encounters a figure who belongs to the other side of the threshold: this figure is the Medusa of "The War Against the Trees," the "blind mammal" of "Prophecy on Lethe," the whale of</page><page sequence="17">Stanley Kunitz 's Braid of Creation 1 7 1 "The Wellfleet Whale." Aptly echoing a phrase from Herman Melville, the "shudder of recognition" recorded in Kunitz's account of the whale in his notebook (NLT) corresponds to "the shock of recogni- tion" that Kunitz attributes to the final vision in "Father and Son" (KOKF). In the case of "Prophecy on Lethe," although the direction differs- the "mammal" moving out of, the father into the water- the scene corresponds to that of "Father and Son" down to such small details as that of the attendant turtle: A pod of silence, bursting when the sun Clings to the forehead, will surprise The gasping turtle and the leech With your strange brain blooming. . . . The description of the sun clinging to the forehead points to a further correspondence between "Prophecy on Lethe" and the most controversial line in "Father and Son," "The night nailed like an or- ange to my brow." Kunitz has explained this line as an attempt to render the vivid presence of the moon in this nighttime scene (KOKF). That presence is another typical feature of the encounter with the mother, for instance in "The Approach to Thebes" and "The War Against the Trees." If we accept the feminine associations of the moon, which of course has roots in a tradition much older than Kunitz's work, and if we contrast those associations with the masculine "sperm of sun" in "Very Tree," we can trace the grotesqueness of the vision in both "Father and Son" and "Prophecy on Lethe" to its origin. Not only does the object of vision belong to an alien realm, but that object is seen in a light that is alien to it: the mother in the masculine light of the sun, in "Prophecy on Lethe"; the father in the feminine light of the moon, in "Father and Son." If, in the former poem, the solar light bursts the mother's "pod of silence," in the latter poem the lunar light wraps the father in a pod of silence, just as his name was contained in the mother's cabinet in "The Portrait" or in the maternal oak of "The Testing-Tree." In "Father and Son," the container is less obvious be-</page><page sequence="18">172 TERENCE DIGGORY cause its material is transparent. "Throughout the poem," Kunitz ex- plains, "the moon, though never named, is fiercely burning" (KOKF). In choosing not to name the moon, Kunitz has modelled the silence of his poem on the transparency of the moon's light. Ironically, the poet's adoption of the silent language of the mother provides all that the poem's persona so noisily requests from the father. Although commentators have quite naturally assumed that the son's goal is to establish some relationship to his father, his speech to the father demonstrates that that is not his ultimate desire. "For I would be a child to those who mourn," he explains, and the mourner is unques- tionably the mother, in Kunitz 's life as in his poetry, where, for in- stance, she wears "a mourning bonnet" in "Quinnapoxet." Mistakenly, the son assumes that the relationship he desires to establish with the mother is something that the father might "teach" him. Teaching, how- ever, involves in Kunitz 's poetry the double prohibition against naming and touch. "Teach me my reasons, I would know their names," the son beseeches the father in "The Guilty Man," where the phrase "Teach me" is deliberately set parallel to the plea "Touch me." Although the silence that responds to the son's plea in "Father and Son" refuses to teach, it offers touch from an unexpected quarter. If Kunitz could inter- pret his mother's prohibition against touch as evidence of "her fierce love," as he told Chris Busa, he was in some sense touched through the prohibition. In "Father and Son," it is the moon that is "fiercely burn- ing," and its seemingly intangible light is made fiercely tangible when it is "nailed like an orange to my brow." The issues that I have here applied to Kunitz frequently arise in contemporary discussion of poetry as criteria for distinguishing male and female traditions. Kunitz 's unusual position with regard to those issues would ally him to the female tradition rather than the male, a result that does not seem surprising in the light of the prominent role of the mother in his poetic genesis. Such an allegiance has occasionally disappointed male critics, however, and thus points to yet another fac- tor tending to limit Kunitz 's reputation. Reviewing Passport to the War, Horace Gregory accounted for what he judged to be the "minor strain" in which Kunitz wrote by tracing it to "feminine literary influence." More recently, Harold Bloom has dismissed Kunitz for his failure to engage in the struggle between poetic fathers and sons that, in Bloom's view, develops the "voice" that characterizes all "strong" poetry. Fem- inist critics, on the other hand, have found an alternative source of</page><page sequence="19">Stanley Kunitz 's Braid of Creation 173 strength in the strategy of silence that is also an alternative to what is usually valued as "voice."3 This revaluation confers special meaning on Kunitz's praise of individual women poets: of Marianne Moore, for instance, "who does not pretend to be a bard" (KOKF); or of Louise Bogan, two of whose best poems, in Kunitz's estimation, were "Me- dusa" and "The Sleeping Fury" (KOKF). But to read such praise as confirmation of Kunitz's allegiance to a characteristically feminine tradition threatens to repeat Allen Tate's condescension to Bogan as a "woman poet," against which Kunitz protested (KOKF). Although Kunitz's poetry may derive from the mother, it derives, we must remember, from a very special image of the mother that resists analysis in terms of a male/female polarity. Among specifically literary influences, the qualities that stand out in Kunitz's praise of female writers in this country are also prominent in his com- ments on those Russian writers, male and female, who provided a new impetus to Kunitz's stylistic development during the 1960's, for in- stance, Mandelstam and Akhmatova. Remembering that Kunitz's mother herself endured the prohibitions she imposed on her son, we can conjecture that the stylistic direction she helped to determine may be typical not of one sex but of any person who has been denied "voice," and who discovers in that denial an opportunity. Kunitz's mother, then, would furnish the image not of Woman but of "that Other who is also you" (Jackson). However attractive the Other may appear, Kunitz recognizes the self-destructive tendencies that contribute to that attraction. Such rec- ognition, Kunitz explains, brings the son to a halt on the shore of the pond in "Father and Son" (KOKF). It also brings Kunitz, as a self- conscious craftsman, to a halt at the edge of language. "The words of a poem," he explains, "are full of subterranean electric feelings, pent-up music, sleeping gestures. A poem trembles on the verge of lapsing into music, of breaking into dance: but its virtue lies in resisting the temptation- in remaining language" (KOKF). He realizes that to push too far toward music or dance would be to abandon the art of poetry 3See, for example, Jeanne Kammer, "The Art of Silence and the Forms of Women's Poetry," Shakespeare's Sisters: Feminist Essays on Women Poets, ed.

Yet gesture can appear as a kind of language in its own right. "Gestural language antedates verbal lan- guages, and some symbolic gestures link us with the animal kingdom," he observes (NLT). Thus, at the opening of "The Wellfleet Whale," Kunitz acknowl- edges, "You have your language too," in which the whale expresses "a sorrow without name, both more,/ and less than human." Being "anon- ymous," "a pod of silence," yet being also a "mammal," the whale- figure in "Prophecy on Lethe" in fact comes to represent the liminal human position with regard to the "depthless sound" of more primitive life forms, represented by "the gasping turtle and the leech" in that poem, "the turtles and the lilies" in "Father and Son," and "the plank- ton and protozoa" in the following passage: The frontier where man must defend his life, the principle of life itself, is at the very edge of creation, where existence and non-existence are scarcely distinguishable, where we confront the anonymous and minimal, among the plankton and proto- zoa. Man will perish unless he learns that the web of the universe is a continuous tissue. Touch it at any point, and the whole web shudders. (KOKF) The web that registers this "shudder of recognition" is suspended between two extremes: the "self-strangeness" felt in "The Science of the Night" when "I touch you cold," and the self-intimacy that makes Whitman's touch, for Harold Bloom, "a Sublime yet quite literal mas- turbation."4 To the latter image of "voice," which Bloom takes it to be, Kunitz offers an alternative that is not a monodie "speaking" but a triadic weaving of hearing, sight and touch. In part because Kunitz was attempting a poem in the more traditional mode, as he persists in do- ing, only one of these senses, hearing, made it into "The Wellfleet Whale" uncensored. The full triad, however, operates in "The Snakes of September," the poem that stands at the head oiNext-to-Last-Things, and that represents much better than "The Wellfleet Whale" the dis- tinctive contributions that Kunitz has to make to the present possibili- 4"To the Tally of My Soul: Whitman's Image of Voice," Bennington Review 10 (April 1981): 13.</page><page sequence="21">Stanley Kunitz 's Braid of Creation 175 ties of poetry. "The Snakes of September" also shows Kunitz turning a prose passage toward poetry, rather than away from it, as in the case of "The Wellfleet Whale." His starting point is the passage quoted at the end of the previous paragraph. The poem that emerges, however, is not felt as a general statement about man's place in the web of creation, but as a particular encounter between an individual man and two snakes. "All summer I heard them," the poem begins, but now, in Septem- ber, he sees them, "dangling head-down, entwined/ in a brazen love- knot," a less traumatic instance of "The Knot" that stands at the head of the collected poems, weaving the "web" noted by Gregory Orr. Unlike the ambiguous image of intercourse in "the Approach to Thebes," the "love-knot" in "The Snakes of September" is made both more definite and, strangely, more decorous by the assignment of the phallus, in the form of the serpent, to both participants; there is not one phallus that must somehow be shared. On the other hand, there are two participants; this is copulation, not masturbation, and it is only after that condition is established that Kunitz introduces the sense of touch, in the poem's concluding lines: I put out my hand and stroke the fine, dry grit of their skins. After all, we are partners in this land, co-signers of a covenant. At my touch the wild braid of creation trembles. Among the artful silences of these lines, surely we hear Ovid's account of Tiresias's striking of two copulating snakes, ultimately the ground of his gift of prophecy. Kunitz has replaced the striking with a gentle stroking, because he is after covenant, not prophecy, which "Prophecy on Lethe" ironically casts upon the waters of forgetfulness. The image of covenant includes the writing of names, but here, unlike in "The Wellfleet Whale," the writing does not appear as a transgressive cut- ting. Rather, it enters into the "braid of creation" as a form of weaving, just as the "Girl with Sampler," in Kunitz 's "Words for the Unknown Makers," "embroidered her name into her dowry." As Gregory Orr points out, the needlework that Kunitz celebrates throughout "Words for the Unknown Makers" is the trade by which</page><page sequence="22">176 TERENCE DIGGORY Kunitz's mother supported her family. Because that poem is a recent one, appearing in the section of new work in the 1979 collected edi- tion, Orr speculates that Kunitz has lately revised his image of his mother, so that she no longer appears merely as an obstacle in the quest for identity. But the identity at issue in "Words for the Unknown Makers" is identity as maker, and in that guise, I would argue, Kunitz's mother never was an obstacle. Insofar as his image of his mother changes during his career, it changes from the image of a goal viewed from a distance, to that of a goal close enough to touch. "We held each other at a distance," Kunitz explained to Chris Busa. "She was the most competent woman I have ever known- I respected that. But it took years- after her death at eighty-six- for me to be touched by the beauty and bravery of her spirit" (NLT). In the poems, we still feel that touch only indirectly, yet vividly, much as Kunitz, studying the girl's sampler, senses the presence of a watchful eye hovering over the work, causing the girl to sit with "lips pursed" in silent concentration: " 'Do it right, child!' said her mother." Guided by Kunitz's attentive- ness to the words of others, we can also sense, in Kunitz's poems, what Osip Mandelstam remarked in observing the pursed lips of Anna Akhmatova in the act of composing a poem: "looking at these lips you could hear her voice" (KOKF).</page></plain_text>
