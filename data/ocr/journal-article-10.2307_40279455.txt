<plain_text><page sequence="1">DJELAL KADIR America's Exceptional Comparabilities : An Instance of World Literature COMPARE THE LITERATURES of America inevitably means to partake of a "quantum irony": our comparative activity is carried out against the grain, an activity which is itself, inexorably, "in the American grain," as the American poet and pediatrician William Carlos Williams diagnosed it early in the twenti- eth century. A trans-American hybrid himself, son of a Puerto Rican mother and an English immigrant father, in our own time he might have called himself a Latino writer from Rutherford, New Jersey, whose life-long protestation was aimed at the English influence in American poetry. It is this "quantum irony"1 that I wish to pursue here, as the title of this essay should imply. A presumptive persuasion drives most comparative endeavors. It consists of the supposition that certain objects are indeed comparable, an assumption that ren- ders all subsequent questions about the validity of the undertaking disingenuous, if not outright instances of petitio principii. In theoretical/critical terms, as long as "to compare" is deployed as a transitive verb, comparatism generally entails a strong move. In the case of American cultures, literary and hemispheric, such a move has to possess even greater vigor since the objects of comparison qua Amer- ican historically have been, and continue to be, resistant to the possibility of com- parison and are constitutionally self-defined as unique and incomparable. Self- conceived as singular and as unprecedented in human history, the American project, even before 1492, is marked by exception. Exceptionalism, however, may well be the greatest commonality among cultures in the history of the human spe- cies. America, by which we are to understand the entirety of the Western Hemi- sphere, then, is no exception in its exceptionalism, which is not to say that it is free of specificity, idiosyncrasy, or historically differentiated cultural characteristics. Like most human societies, America's cultures are also inclined to narrate their origins in terms of autogenesis, their historical specificity cloaked in parthe- nogenic myths, creations that issue from an anthropomorphic virginal nature 1 The coinage of the phrase belongs to Horace Gregory, who wrote the Introduction to the 1956 edition of Williams's In the American Grain.

These range from the cosmogonie narratives of Native Peoples, to the providentialist and eschatological discourses of the first Europeans in the "New World," to the first "scientific" explanations of this "New World" phenomenon through the herme- neutically encyclical language of Natural Histories peculiar to the long tradition of Europe's natural philosophies, whose most salient characteristic was its self- naturalizing interpretive circularity. The primal text of this naturalizing impulse is Gonzalo Fernandez de Oviedo's Historia general y natural de las Indias, islas y Tierra firme del Mar Oceano (1535), a work that is echoed in the equally foundational vir- ginal fantasies of Captain John Smith's A True Relation of such occurrences and acci- dents ofnoate as hath hapned in Virginia since the first planting ofthat colony (1608). Fernandez de Oviedo was Emperor Charles V's official court chronicler. Captain John Smith was a shareholder in a holding company whose venture-capital enter- prise was seeking a return in the New World. Whatever either deemed to be natu- ral, they were far from disinterested in doing so. In this sense, Fernandez de Oviedo and Captain Smith are paradigmatic fig- ures in the "natural history" narratives of America. They serve as primal exam- ples of Europe's naturalization of a world not as it might have been prior to Euro- pean intervention, but as the colonizers' intrusive and appropriative technologies of language and ideology chose to construct it. Lest we miss the impact of their discursive construction of a New World, Oviedo's calls itself Historia general y natural and Smith's A True Relation. None of the modifiers in either title is pos- sessed of any logical necessity. Their truth or naturalness resides in the force of the declarative assertion, which tends to be the privilege of the conqueror over the field of conquest. The time lag between Oviedo's 1535 "natural history" and Smith's 1608 "true relation" is only a function of imperial readiness for colo- nial expansion - Spain's and England's. The imperial processes are analogous, though the earlier might be deemed the deployment of a monarchia - a worldly governance - and the latter entrepreneurial, or regimental mercantilism. Discur- sive appropriation as concomitant of colonial exploitation sustained imperial reign in both instances. Especially in the case of America, then, the comparatist's project translates fore- most into a task of comparative exceptionalisms, no matter the cultures or cul- tural phenomena that the discipline's practitioners take as objects of comparison. Such is also the case in the self-privileging "chosenness" of American cultures even before America was "America," as, for example, in the originary cosmogonies of the Andean Tahuantinsuyu - literally the geographical "four districts" in the Quechua language - a geography that was given its topographic prosopopoeia or generative embodiment as the great body that extends from its head in Qmto&gt; Ecuador, through its navel (literally, "Cuzco") in Peru and its genital parts in Lake Titicaca in Bolivia. We have come to know of this genesiac corpus from both Inca Garcilaso de la Vega's Comentarios reales de los incas (1609) and the protestations against that topographical body's ravaging by the swineherd Pizarro and his heirs. The most eloquent of these protestations came in the form of a plea for good gov- ernance to the court of Philip III of Spain from the mestizo Guaman Poma de Ayala,</page><page sequence="3">AMERICA'S EXCEPTIONAL COMPARABILITIES / 211 a more than thousand-page appeal entitled El primer nueva corànica [sic] y buen gobi- erno (1600-1615) and written in a Quechua- and Aymara-inflected broken Spanish that only enhances its rhetorical force. In its own claim to uniqueness, the Mesoamerican counterpart of the Andean Tahuantinsuyu, the Aztec capital of Tenochtitlân, is also a sacred "omphalos" to its founders and inhabitants. Tenochtitlân is a convergent culmination of a diver- sity of cultures that range from the eastern and chronologically earliest Olmecs to the southern Maya-Quiche, whose most noted legacy to the Aztecs is the cosmog- onie Popol vuh. Like the Incaic narratives of Tahuantinsuyu, this graphic intersec- tion of textuality and world traces the genesis of human history as a history tanta- mount to their own particular genealogy interrupted by alien intruders who came from the ocean to the east of their sacred geography. To the north, a similar cos- mogonie explanation emanates from Sipapuni, literally "Place of Emergence" in Hopi, which is the originary locus of the Hopi, as well as the Anasazi, the Zuni and other Pueblo peoples, the Athapaskan Navajo, and the Apache. We learn of this sacred history through the creation cycles narrated in the Navajo Dine bahane, the northern analogue of the Popol vuh. All of these cosmogonies share the unique- ness of the genealogy they narrate and the special nature of the people and their history engendered through those narratives. This, of course, is also the case with the no-less self-deifying European cul- tures whose transatlantic errand was considered part of a providential history that conferred a divinely elect role on the chosen people in the founding of a New World for an imminently anticipated apocalyptic end-time. These providentialist/ eschatological discourses date as far back as Christopher Columbus's 1501 Libro de profecias, a compendium of biblical and cosmographie prognostications that Colum- bus took as foretelling the inevitability of his 1492 achievement and an apocalyptic ledger whose reckoning put the End and the Second Coming with expectant pre- cision in the year 1655. In 1639, the venerable Puritan John Cotton recalculated Columbus's figures with even greater impatience in his Exposition upon the Thir- teenth Chapter of the Revelation, coming up with one year earlier. Indeed, Gordon Brotherston's far-ranging Book of the Fourth World: Reading the Native Americas through Their Literatures and my own more modest Columbus and the Ends of the Earth: Europe s Prophetic Rhetoric as Conquering Ideology, two comparative studies from the five- hundredth anniversary of America's annus mirabilis of 1492, provide unequivo- cal evidence that any comparative focus trained on America inevitably reveals the impulse of cultural particularity to universalize itself into natural, not to say cosmic, principle. This, if nothing else, is a drive common to America's cultures, pre- and post-Colombian, a fact that renders our comparative efforts in America a project that must deal with what I refer to in the title of this essay as exceptional comparabilities. These exceptionalisms are comparable by differentials of degree, if not always of kind. While an ideology of supernal uniqueness might inform the chthonic indigenous cultures of America as well as the transcendental or other- worldly cultures of European provenance, the asymmetrical nature of these cul- tures' encounters render the exceptionalisms of European origin overwhelming. Having come literally from another world, the conquering cultures are driven by and toward an otherworldly teleology. The invaded and colonized geography becomes an intermediate way station for the corroboration of the driving impetus for the enterprise in the event of success. Should it prove otherwise, as misadventure</page><page sequence="4">COMPARATIVE LITERATURE / 212 was not uncommon during the early era of exploration, the experience is taken as a test of the worthiness of the mission and its providential agents, a test which stiff- ens not only the determination of the elect, but also their self-perceived exception- alism in the face of adversity. Failure in this kind of exceptionalism, in other words, is no option, and success is merely self-confirmation. Far from singular, then, the historical phenomenon that goes by the name America is paradoxically plural. If singularity is susceptible to being compared to its own perpetually morphing self, plurality is certainly subject to comparison in all its similitudes, permutations, and differentials. And to say that America is unde- niably plural is to assert that America is inevitably comparative and comparable. Many writers have dramatized this aspect of America, not least among them the incidental American Italo Calvino, who was born in Cuba in 1923 when his Italian botanist parents happened to be on that island on a scientific mission. Finding himself part of that intricate accidental tradition of America's historia naturalis, Calvino, also an Argentine by marriage and thoroughly informed of this tradi- tion's genealogical peculiarities, places the primal scene of writing in America. He does so with knowing alacrity and not without characteristic irony at the mid-point (chapter six of twelve) of his novel Se una notte d'inverno un viagiattore (1979; If on a Winter's Night a Traveler, 1981) . This work is comprised of a series of novelistic rehearsals, whose aggregate of interrupted first chapters and their aborted incip- its constitute Calvino's novel. In its iterative genèses, Calvino's work can also be called peculiarly American. One of the ten would-be novels that become his novel is entitled "In a Network of Lines that Enlace," a title that echoes, in spectral rever- sal, the title of a well-known story by his Argentine master Jorge Luis Borges - "El jardin de senderos que se bifurcan" (1941; "Garden of the Forking Paths") - a work in which lines fork as frequently as they enlace. At the haunted core of his narrative, Calvino identifies, not without a quotient of anarchic irony worthy of the fabled American Indian Trickster, the originary source of all tales. He locates the fountainhead of all literature by citing an epistolary report dispatched from the mysterious "Cerro Negro," "a remote village in South America" (116). The dis- patcher of that report is the aptly named roving "translator" Ermes Marana, self- described as "the representative of the 'Mercury and the Muses' agency, specializ- ing in the advertising and exploitation of literary and philosophical works" (120). From that Hermetic labyrinth (marana is "maze" in Spanish) we learn of a local American legend: [I] t tells of an old Indian known as the Father of Stories, a man of immemorial age, blind and illit- erate, who uninterruptedly tells stories that take place in countries and in times completely unknown to him. The phenomenon has brought expeditions of anthropologists and parapsycholo- gists; it has been determined that many novels published by famous authors had been recited word for word by the wheezing voice of the Father of Stories several years before their appearance. The old Indian, according to some, is the universal source of narrative material, the primordial magma from which the individual manifestations of each writer develop; according to others, a seer who, thanks to his consumption of hallucinatory mushrooms, manages to establish communication with the inner world of the strongest visionary temperaments and pick up their psychic waves; according to still others, he is the reincarnation of Homer, of the storyteller of the Arabian Nights, of the author of the Popol Vuh, as well as of Alexandre Dumas and James Joyce; but there are those who reply that Homer has no need of metempsychosis, since he never died and has continued through the millennia living and composing, the author, besides the couple of poems usually attributed to him, also of many of the most famous narratives known to man.

That existence, according to Calvino's parodie amplifica- tion of American uniqueness, perforce has contaminated the reality, actual and virtual, of the rest of the world, its history, and its stories. In fact, Borges would say in his 1940 short story "Tlön, Uqbar, Orbis, Tertius" that this self-engendered ontology is the world, its American genesis traced to "a secret benevolent soci- ety" whose mission was "to invent a country" (Collected Fictions 78). In the trans- migration of this enterprise from Tlön to the New World, the under-ambitious nature of such an undertaking becomes contemptible. Thus, Borges's narrator states, "in America it was nonsense to invent a country - what they ought to do was invent a planet" (79). And they did, the undertaking having come to light through the contents of a mysterious envelope, no doubt dispatched by some earlier ava- tar of Calvino's Ermes Marana and "postmarked Ouro Preto" (79). In Calvino's rendition, the Brazilian baroque-laced gold-rush town of Ouro Preto (Black Gold) invoked by Borges becomes the mysterious Cerro Negro (Black Hill), the origi- nary source of all literature. The American mastermind of this enterprise, a cer- tain Ezra Buckley from Memphis, Tennessee, "suggested a systematic encyclope- dia of the illusory planet. He would bequeath to [those volumes] his gold-veined mountains, his navigable rivers, his prairies thundering with bulls and buffalo, his Negroes, his brothels, and his dollars, he said, under one condition: The work shall make no pact with the impostor Jesus Christ.' Buckley did not believe in God, yet he wanted to prove to the nonexistent God that mortals could conceive and shape a world" (79). In the ironically spectral ambition of Borges's and Calvino's American geneal- ogy, one recognizes their obverse ontogenetic precursors in the foundational texts that American history considers its no less ambitious and no less encyclo- pedic originary projects. Two of the most salient of these would have to be the Franciscan Fray Juan de Torquemada's Los veintey un libros rituales y monarquia Indiana, con el origen y guerras de los yndios occidentals, de sus poblaciones, descubrim- ientos, conquista, conversion y otras cosas maravillosas (The Twenty-one Ritual Books and Indian Monarchy, with the Origin of Wars of the West Indians, of Their Populations, Discoveries, Conquest, Conversion and Other Marvels) , commonly referred to as the Monarquia indiana (1615), and the Puritan Cotton Mather's no less compendious Magnolia Christi Americana (1702). Torquemada's and Mather's respective Amer- ican projects serve analogous aims in the articulation of a constructed New World with its meticulously recorded graphic or textual reality. As such, the work of both "divines" constitutes civilizational mythographies grafted onto a geo- graphical hemisphere whose ontological coherence and epistemic cogency can no longer be founded anywhere except in these mythologies. Thus, these are com- prehensive works that aspire to offer cosmic explanations of history as necessary, as inevitable, as universal, and as fully determined by divine will and defined by a supernal plan. In other words, the ideological underpinnings of Europe's "enter- prise of the Indies," as Columbus was wont to refer to it, and the Puritans' "errand into the wilderness," as the New England divines characterized their New World endeavor, find their discursive recapitulation as providential history in the mon- umental compendia that appear roughly a century after the institutionalization of</page><page sequence="6">COMPARATIVE LITERATURE / 214 Spain's and England's respective colonial projects in New Spain and New England. As "centurial" works, their impulse dilates toward millennial reach and uchronic, or timeless, justification. Between these world-making originary narratives and their ironic parody in Borges and Calvino extends a long tradition of prose and lyrical prosody that dramatizes the pursuit of those providential designs, or, alternately, seeks to thwart the threatening inevitability of their realization. The "holy grail" of such proj- ects as the Latin American Baroque (since the seventeenth century) and Anglo America's "American Renaissance" (since the mid-nineteenth) does both simul- taneously, at once pursuing and negating such exhaustive totalization in intricate and often self-contradictory ways. The most compendious and critically insight- ful treatment of this Latin American Baroque to date is Lois Parkinson Zamora's The Inordinate Eye: New World Baroque and Latin American Fiction (2006) . F. O. Mat- thiessen's eponymous work remains the locus classicus of the "American Renais- sance." The spectral comparabilities of the New World Baroque and the Ameri- can Renaissance have yet to receive sustained comparative study.2 The New World Baroque and the American Renaissance trade in self-directed defiance, the Baroque simultaneously denying and acquiring its singularity through oversaturated plenitude, the American Renaissance grounding its parthenogen- esis on a rejection of its own genealogy; the former finding its dematerialization through overwrought materiality, the latter dematerializing its historical genesis for the sake of its exceptional self-materialization. Two key terms might prove ser- viceable in characterizing, if not fully understanding, the paradoxical formation of these two projects: desmesura for the New World Baroque, incommensurability for the American Renaissance. Here, the act of comparison itself slides onto para- doxical ground, however, since to compare is to take the measure of what deems itself immeasurable: desmesurado and incommensurability both literally mean beyond comparable measurement. Desmesura paradoxically comprises the pullulating excess of what cannot be comprised, the encompassing of what cannot be compassed - paradoxical connotations that entail salient defining characteristics of the Baroque. Incommensurability tends toward the tendentious and untenable transgression of normative genealogy, exemplified most pointedly by the exemplary figures in the subtitle of F. O. Matthiessen's book, American Renaissance: Art and Expression in the Age of Emerson and Whitman. As the paradigmatic figure of New England Transcen- dentalism, Emerson is the embodiment of what would transcend the norm and the most resonant voice of an American originality that denies precedent and is most pointedly expressed in "The American Scholar" (1837). Whitman sings in serial stentorian echo his plurality and multiple contradictions, self-defined as an indomitable subject beyond any measure or containment. The task of comparison, and specifically of comparative literature, then, entails the paradoxical project of diagnosing and juxtaposing the cultural formations of America as self-contradictions - formations that, in essence, essentialize them- 2 Any such critical/theoretical treatment is likely to pivot on a point of self-directed exceptional- ity or contrariety common, mutatis mutandis, to both traditions. I lanced the discursive bubble of this convergent point some twenty years ago, a demonstration that has remained largely illegible to Anglo-Americanists, Latin Americanists, and to most comparatists among them, since the textual self-exemptions carried out at such a critical intersection inexorably interpellate scholars of Amer- ican literary cultures into their symptomatic exceptionality. See Kadir, Questing Fictions.</page><page sequence="7">AMERICA'S EXCEPTIONAL COMPARABILITIES / 215 selves as non-essentializable; formations whose salient attribute of identity consists in their denial of self-equivalence, much less equivalence to any alterity outside of themselves. The slippery epistemology to be negotiated by comparative literature on these problematic grounds was suggestively adumbrated by James Clifford at a 1990 conference in Champaign-Urbana, Illinois, in remarks that were subsequently redacted into a 1992 essay entitled "Traveling Cultures," which in turn became the lead chapter in his 1997 book Routes. "My aim," says Clifford, "initially, is to open up the question of how cultural analysis constitutes its objects - societies, tradi- tions, communities, identities - in spatial terms and through specific spatial prac- tices of research" (19); and toward the end of his piece, he declares: "I'll conclude with a series of exhortations" (36). The first of these hortatory injunctions reads: "We need to think comparatively" (36). What does Clifford mean by "think [ing] comparatively," and how does this relate to our own culture of comparatists engaged in comparative studies? In the space between his declaration regarding the "spatial practices of research" and his exhortation for comparativi ty, Clifford demonstrates in his own practice what we are to understand by "think [ing] com- paratively," and his illustration of the process is of utmost relevance to us as practi- tioners of comparative literature whose focus happens to be trained on America. Clifford demonstrates foremost the significance of disciplinary self-reflection at a historical moment when the modus operandi of his own discipline of anthropol- ogy had come into question - when, in other words, anthropology was compelled to anthropologize itself, its practices, and its practitioners. In effect, "to think comparatively" comes to mean re-thinking contrastively anthropology's analytical procedures and the epistemic tenets that underwrite those procedures. It means remapping the field and the locus from which it is surveyed. The operative term for Clifford is travel, a term he equates with translation, in the dual Latin sense of movement from here to there and interpretation or hermeneutic decoding - in short, what Clifford calls the "specific spatial practices of research" (19). 3 The his- toric predicament of anthropology as a discipline that by the latter part of the twentieth century could no longer assume a position of mastery over its field or an empyrean perspective in its disciplinary practice parallels the resistance of com- parative literature's field objects to a presumed commensurability that makes them comparable. It parallels as well the perennial self-consciousness and self- critique that is endemic to comparative literature, a discipline for which a state of crisis figures as a chronic - some might say congenital - characteristic. This might explain the discursive relevance of Clifford's disciplinary diagnosis and caveats for comparatists, especially since he considers comparatism an integral part of the anthropologist's modus operandi and identifies the arena of "spatial practices" as the space of comparison.4 This is the space of nomadic itinerancy, which he calls, after Mikhail Bakhtin, a "spatial chronotope" or "a chronotope of culture" (25) - that is, a discursive site whose negotiation and traversal become constitutive of culture characterized as " [c] onstructed and disputed historicities, sites of displace- ment, interference, and interaction" (25). And in an hortatory injunction that has 3 My own itinerary in tracking the "errancy" of America's "questing fictions" is not unrelated to Clif- ford's exhortations on "travel" as the coefficient of scholarly/critical "spatial practices." See note 2. 4 For the most recent resonance of Clifford's essay in comparative literature's self-diagnosis see Melas, especially "Grounds for Comparison" (1-43).</page><page sequence="8">COMPARATIVE LITERATURE / 216 always characterized the practices of comparative literature as a discipline, Clifford notes: "A comparative cultural studies needs to work, self-critically, with compro- mised, historically encumbered tools" (39). For literary and cultural comparatists whose operative field is America, these historical encumbrances are an integral part of the subject as well as of the cultural performance of comparative studies. I believe the density of what Clifford calls "constructed and disputed historicities" ought to be pressed by a comparative assessment of historical self-constructions that constitute the field and disciplinary formations that now adjudicate, now com- pound, the density of those "disputed historicities." When the "spatial practices" that frame and define our comparative and critical praxes come upon "localizing strategies" (19) such as the American cultural histories I have alluded to as non- essentialist self-essentializations and as exceptional phenomena that would uni- versalize their uniqueness, we must reach for some degree of limning or discrimi- nation that attempts to comprehend the nuances of a number of Clifford's key questions, to wit, "[w]ho determines where (and when) a community draws its lines, names its insiders and outsiders?" (19). The query is as crucial for the target culture of investigation as it is for the critical culture of the investigators. At the heart of this question lie the cultural politics, academic and otherwise, in the Unites States of America and, as a direct consequence, in the rest of the American Hemisphere in the last two decades of the twentieth century. Those cultural poli- tics had their contestatory agon hushed into quiescence because of more porten- tous imperial politics of transnational and cross-cultural aggression before that politics of cultural contention reached any resolution.5 With the new century, "localizing strategies" forge their constructs through the hegemonic puissance of a Realpolitik and its attendant Kulturkampf, sustained and projected by predatory global capital and its communications networks, a puissance that renders irrele- vant all disputes in "disputed historicities" with peremptory efficiency and raw power. Those who possess and deploy the power to forge cultural localizations simply define their parameters and maintain or expediently shift them with over- whelming assertiveness, at home and abroad. For comparatists working in/on America, the implications of this cultural Macht- politik are grave. At issue is no longer the degree of interpellation, as Althuser would have it, of critical agency into the object of critique. One can get a sense of the par- lous state of this predicament and the perils for intellectual integrity and scholarly or pedagogical independence when one considers the institutional integration of the university into the instruments of capital and of the state apparatuses that safeguard those strategically defined and tactically maintained localizations. It is no secret that the foremost institutions of higher education and research depend for an overwhelming portion of their operating resources on government contracts and on private underwriting, with university management behaving, perforce, as franchise holders serving as interface between the Machtpolitik to which they are beholden and to which they minister, on the one hand, and the Machtkultur 5 The life-world issues of those cultural politics were, in fact, displaced or re-located into an abstracted discourse whose rhetorical schematics screen out the political urgency of the historical moment. See, in this regard, Bhabha: "It is that Third Space, though unrepresentable in itself, which constitutes the discursive conditions of enunciation that ensure that the meaning and sym- bols of culture have no primordial unity or fixity; that even the same signs can be appropriated, translated, rehistoricized and read anew" (37).</page><page sequence="9">AMERICA'S EXCEPTIONAL COMPARABILITIES / 217 they foster and administer in the university, on the other. The unprecedented surge of the security state in the first decade of the twenty-first century and the instru- mentalization of all institutions, especially research universities, into the service of such securitization, now unequivocally answers the additional questions Clif- ford posed at the beginning of the last decade of the twentieth century: "How is significant difference politically articulated, and challenged?" (19). Significant difference as such is an endangered species, lest it be the self-differentiation of the exceptional as exempted from conventions and protocols of international commonweal. This is a strong form of "localization" that moots all alternatives to the hegemonic locus and normalizes all border crossings - discursive, cultural, or topographic - in accordance with the interests of those empowered to police bor- ders, monitor potential breaches of frontiers, and superintend trans-border forms of hybridity. The theoretical status attained by the "border" as transcultural cross- ing point, whether within national pluri-culturalism and multidisciplinary praxis or across the frontier shared by the U.S. and Mexico, has been voided or walled in by what is now known as the "tortilla curtain" of mortar and of discourse, and the frontier itself is now subjected to full-spectrum surveillance by the combined vigi- lantism of the "Minutemen" and the real-time virtual panopticon of the state. Insti- tutional formations such as universities and the corporate media have seen to the disciplining of disciplines into a consensus that does not brook the breach of any border, much less dissidence, or that only tactically tolerates such crossings as a programmatic component of institutional command and control structures. And, as for any challenge to the ideological orthodoxy and political consensus, institu- tional management of any would-be difference, coupled with a calculated quotient of self-censorship, ensures the neutralization of all questioning that might pose a significant challenge to the manufactured consensus. How poignantly innocent do Clifford's other questions now seem, then, as his terms take on connotations he could not have anticipated in 1990: "What does it take to define and defend a home- land? What are the political stakes in claiming (or sometimes being relegated to) a 'home'?" (36). There is a "quantum irony," to return to our opening trope, in this squalid quandary and imperial Realpolitik, whose diagnostic distillation one of the more insightful comparatists working today, Natalie Melas, finds "depressingly encap- sulated" (235 n.52) in the latest ten-year report of the American Comparative Literature Association on the state of the discipline.6 Depressing as the modes of "localization," to extend Clifford's term to our institutional formations and the intersection of world and disciplinary praxes, might be for some, however, there is no reason for despair. In fact, historical precedent, in America and elsewhere, teaches us that even under dire conditions literature and critical discourse find ways to countermand the most hegemonic and tyrannical regimes. Mikhail Bakh- tin formulated the diagnostic tools of "chronotope" and "dialogism" so crucial to James Clifford and our own critical discourses under Stalin. In America, The Age of Emerson and Whitman, to use Mattheissen's subtitle for The American Renaissance, is 6 Melas does not indicate whether the diagnosed historical phenomenon itself might have any- thing depressing about it. Her remark is directed, in particular, at my contribution to the ACLA volume, which has no qualms, calculated or otherwise, about laying bare the "disputed historicities" in Clifford's terms, in which the current professional practices of comparative literature are embed- ded.

The core of Jorge Luis Borges's narrative corpus was written between 1939 and the mid 1940s, an era of Fascism in Europe and Argen- tina that ushered in one of the darkest chapters of Europe's twentieth-century history. The so-called Boom of the Latin American novel coincided with one of the most baleful epochs of dictatorial rule and "dirty wars" in the American Hemi- sphere. It is difficult for us to ascertain what might sediment into our history's pos- terity from current cultural production that is contemporaneous with yet another imperial era, this time of global rather than merely hemispheric reach. This is not, by any means, to counterbalance the prédations of imperial Realpolitik at "home" or "abroad" - terms that cybernetic technologies have rendered problematic, just as they have added complexity to such theoretical and discursive notions as locale, "localization," "travel," and "border," to adhere to the lexical horizon that defined Clifford and the "routes" he willed to us as his conceptual legacy. If this represented the slippery ground of comparative studies in literature and culture at the end of the last century,7 our current "grounds for comparison" - to invoke Harry Levin and those who, like Melas, echo this view - are virtual just as often as they might be actual, as are the landscapes and cultural "chronotopes" in which we carry out what Clifford called our "spatial practices of research." And the "quantum ironies" of counter-self-directed essentialisms, strategic or other- wise, are now just as common in their exceptionality as they are exceptional in their self-projection as the paralogical unique-universal that projects itself with might and main simultaneously as the exception and the rule. All the difference in the world, to echo Melas, makes no difference to that willful projection that assimilates, discriminates, simulates, differentiates, and subsumes with expedi- ency its target to purpose. This is the untenable "terrain," if it can be called that, on which comparative practice must discern the discrepant identities, cognate par- ticularities, incommensurable integers, and "disputed historicities' for the articu- lation of difference to difference, of translational source to target, of language to world, and of world to textuality. How comparable the comparatist practices of this "chronotopic location" might be to the comparative literature of other times and of other places than America is no less compelling than the volatile exceptional- ity of the hemisphere's "quantum ironies." As comparable as U.S. America's excep- tionalism, in particular, might be to all human cultures' penchant for exception- ality, we have learned from theorists such as Carl Schmitt and Giorgio Agamben that at any given historical moment it is the privilege of the sovereign to declare the exception. Like its apocalyptic Puritan founders, and unlike the sovereigns of the Spanish empire in the New World, U.S. America has historically spectral- ized that pattern by deeming itself the exception, thereby preemptively submit- ting all others to the rule, including the rule of exceptionality.
