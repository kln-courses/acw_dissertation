<plain_text><page sequence="1">PAUL G. BOURCIER "IN EXCELLENT ORDER": THE GENTLEMAN FARMER VIEWS HIS FENCES, 1790- 1860 During the early nineteenth century, a small but important segment of America's rural society believed that farm fences were far more than a practical necessity to the art of husbandry. For gentleman farmers of the period, the fence served "as a vehicle of communication conveying sta- tus, ideas, values, feeling and meaning.''l Artificial divisions of the farm demonstrated the agriculturalist's notions of farm management, rural landscape, and agrarian society.2 The farm fence became a significant subject of documentation during an era of agricultural reform. Leading the movement for farm improve- ment during the period from 1790 to 1860 was a group of gentleman farmers, or agriculturalists, who experimented with improved techniques of farm management and communicated their discoveries in agricultural periodicals, farm books, addresses, and other published media.3 During PAUL G. BOURCIER received his M.A. in American history through the Hagley Graduate Program at the University of Delaware. He is currently Assistant Curator at The Adirondack Museum in Blue Mountain Lake, New York. lThis notion of artifact as vehicle of communication comes from E. McClung Fleming, "Artifact Study: A Proposed Model," WinterthurPortfolio 9 (1974): 153. 2Few secondary treatments of the farm fence have considered anything but the fence's manifest purpose. These treatments have been either simple, descriptive histories of the popularity of various fence types, or economic discussions of the enclosure in terms of "the fencing problem," the scarcity of fencing materials, and the high cost of labor as they existed in the nineteenth century. sThe terms "gentleman farmer" and "agriculturalist" are synonymous in this paper. Both terms refer to wealthy, educated, prominent, and prosperous landholders, veterans of other professions (medicine, manufacturing, etc.), who were financially able to experi- ment with untested agricultural practices. They organized agricultural societies, puS lished speeches and essays, and supported agricultural journals.

During the early 1800s, the region encompassing New Castle County, Delaware, and adjacent southeastern Pennsylvania witnessed the first significant enthusiasm for hedging in America.4 Local gentleman farmers promoted the adoption of Virginia thorn (Crataegus Cordata) and New Castle, or Delaware, thorn (Crataegus Crus-Galli) hedges as via- ble alternatives to the established method of enclosing fields with post- and-rail fence. Hedge enthusiasts publicized their support for the living fence in essays and discourses that reveal to the modern historian many facets of the writers' ideology as they relate to enclosure in rural Amer- ica.5 It is certainly true that significant portions of the monographs of hedge advocates throughout the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries were devoted to a defense of the hedge as an expedient solution to the problem of enclosing fields, given the scarcity and expense of wood for traditional post-and-rail fences.6 The importance of cost effectiveness, however, did not constitute the total of the gentleman farmer's ideas about rural enclosure. After all, the well-to-do agriculturalists who pub- lished in the leading journals of the day were not dependent upon the eSicient management of a farm for a living. To common farmers per- haps, the fence was nothing more than a necessary expense to protect their fields from intrusion, but to the gentleman farmer the hedge and other viable forms of enclosure were symbols representing various facets of his conceptions of land, nature, and society. One of these facets was the notion of gentility. For the gentleman farmer, the hedge connoted wealth, status, and notoriety. This particu- lar symbolic meaning related directly to the origin of hedging in north- ern Delaware. During the late eighteenth century, the enthusiasm for and technical familiarity with the hedge emigrated to Delaware from 4Clarence Danhof mentioned briefly the notoriety of New Castle County hedge exper- imentation in "The Fencing Problem in the Eighteen-Fifties," Agricultural History 18 (Oc- tober 1944): 180. The second significant enthusiasm for hedging in America, the promo- tion of the Osage orange hedge in the midwestern states during the 1850s and 1860s has been, unlike the subject of this study, a more cultivated theme for historical research. 5 Ideology is defined in this essay as a systematic body of ideas or concepts reflecting the social philosophies of an individual, group, or culture 6A number of essays circulated in the Delaware area addressed the shortage of timber and the promise of the hedge to alleviate the expense of building enclosures.

Throughout the late 1700s and early 1800s, transplanted English yeomen, seeking to adapt the management of their new farms to practices they had come to appreciate in their native country, experimented with indigenous American thorns to find hedge plants suitable to the soil and climate of northern Delaware. These foreigners acted as sources for the dissemination of knowledge of the living fence throughout New Castle County. In 1798 the English- man John Spurrier of Brandywine Hundred became the first in that county to publicize information regarding the hedge in a nationally dis- tributed book that dealt with many aspects of farm management.8 An- other Englishman, William Armor, one of the twenty-four New Castle County subscribers to Spurrier's book, himself became a major expo- nent of the living fence by instructing his neighbors on the planting, raising, and care of Newcastle thorn hedges.9 The role of English precedent in the promotion of hedges in north- ern Delaware indicates that the living fence was a symbol of gentility. By the late eighteenth century, the ornamentation of rural hedges had be- come a sign of status and good taste on English estates. British, and subsequently American, agriculturalists attached great importance, therefore, not only to the utility of a farm fence, but to the beauty of the enclosure as well.l° In 1853, AndrewJackson Downing reflected upon the American adoption of hedging and emphasized the role of English esthetes: " Hundreds of emigrants from Great Britain, familiar all their lives with hawthorn hedges and their treatment, and deploring the un- sightliness of 'posts and rails' in America, have made hedges of their 7The duc de la Rochefoucauld-Liancourt noted the settlement of English farmers in New Castle County in 1797 and remarked that "they will doubtless make considerable improvements in agriculture" (Francois-Alexandre-Frederic, duc de la Rochefoucauld- Liancourt, Travels Through the United States of North America . . . [London, 1800], 511-12).

To these gentleman farmers, a well-trimmed hedge contributed to the rural charm which greeted the eye of the traveler. The many travelers who passed through northern Delaware in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries provide in their travel accounts ample evidence of the esthetic role of the rural hedge. These travelers, most of whom were Englishmen, extolled the beauty of New Castle County hedges. A Frenchman, Mederic-Louis-Emile Moreau de Saint-Mery, noted in 1794, . . . what gives the eye greatest pleasure in the eight or nine miles before reach- ing Newcastle [a town in northern Delaware] are the living hedges peculiar to . . t zls sectlon. They are formed of white thorn, whose flower is beautiful at this moment by the charms which the month of May seems to give to all Nature. In order to judge the keen pleasure caused by these hedges, one must be acquainted with the United States and their fences or dry hedges, of which one never ceases to have a boring view. 12 Moreau de Saint-Mery's opinions about the beauty and charm of the rural hedge set the stage for a series of approbations by travelers through Delaware over the next fifty years. These travelers employed words such as "luxuriant," "fresh," "verdant," "handsome," "beautiful," "pleasant," and "neatly trimmed" to describe the living fences of the area and noted that the adoption of the English mode of surrounding fields with hedges resulted in a vast improvement in the appearance of the rural landscape.ls Travel accounts of this nature furthered the cause of the living fence. They greatly increased the renown of New Castle County among those agriculturalists who had developed an esthetic sense and their rhetoric AndrewJackson Downing, RuralEssays (New York, 1853), 360.

One such writer, the English- man Thomas Main of Washington, D.C., whose essays were reprinted in the agriculturaljournals of early nineteenth-century Delaware, described the perfected hedge in 1804 as "an elegant, compact and evenly fence appearing like a verdant walk around the field ...."15 In a similar vein, a gentleman farmer from the Delaware border town of Chester, Pennsylva- nia, wrote over a quarter of a century later, "I know of no greater dress for . . . a farm than a goodly portion of clean, luxuriant sward, enclosed by substantial fences, or well-trimmed hedges''l6 Statements such as these connoted not the relative cost effectiveness or practicality of the hedge, but rather those genteel trappings associated with fashion and good taste, trappings inherited from eighteenth-century English country gentlemen. The role of the fence as an esthetic feature of the rural landscape was such a persuasive one that champions of forms of enclosure other than the hedge adopted the argument of appearance in order to promote one type of fence or another.l7 The hedge, however, was the form most highly touted for its ornamental qualities. Caleb Kirk was one New Castle County gentleman farmer for whom neatness of appearance was an essential quality for an enclosure. Kirk, a Quaker manufacturer and agriculturalist who owned land in Brandy- wine and Christiana Hundreds, became over the course of the first quarter of the nineteenth century the nation's leading authority on the planting and raising of hedges. One advocate of the living fence in Mas- sachusetts wrote in 1831 that Kirk "possesses and has communicated more information on hedges than any man in this or perhaps any other l4The notoriety of the large-scale use of the thorn hedge in Delaware was mentioned in such accounts as "Thorn Hedge," Agricultural Museum 2 (May 1812): 340 (originally writ- ten in 1803 by a farmer from Montgomery County, Pennsylvania); Robert Sutcliffe, Tra- vels in Some Parts of North America . . .

"18 Kirk carried on considerable correspondence with the re- nowned agriculturalist Jesse Buel and advised Sir John Sinclair, Presi- dent of the Board of Agriculture in Great Britain, on the cultivation of the Virginia and Newcastle (Cockspur) thorn for hedges.'9 Kirk's essays on hedging were published in some of the country's leading agricultural periodicals and were reprinted and cited in many of the day's noted farm books, dictionaries, and encyclopedias.20 Inspired by the work of William Armor and other English hedgers in northern Delaware, Kirk began to experiment with the living fence at about the turn of the century. Like other contemporary gentleman farmers, Kirk concerned himself with the discovery of a form of enclo- sure that was leastexpensive and most durable.2l The appearance of the hedge, however, was the quality he believed to be the most attractive to those who had not yet adopted the living fence as a mode of enclosure. Although British agriculturalists had been experimenting with hedging in Delaware for at least a decade before 1800, Kirk had not seen an example of a perfected hedge grown to maturity at the time he started to attempt the cultivation of one.22 Kirk claimed that at this time he relied upon an imaginary view of the perfect hedge "without having advantage of ocular demonstration, and without any idea of the com- parative expense, or even attempting any calculation on the subject"23 He came to a full realization of the ornamental appearance of the hedge l8Benjamin Shurtleff, "Observations on Post and Rail Fences, Stone Walls, and Living Fences," NewEngland Farmer9 (4 February 1831): 228. t9Harry J.

Itwasnot until Kirk had to prepare a defense for the hedging he was experimenting with that he inquired into the relative cost of live fencing. This shows that Kirk's esthetic sense domi- nated his sense for cost effectiveness. It also shows that Kirk's constituency, other gentle- man farmers, was concerned with qualities of durability and economy as well as appear- ance.

Kirk was convinced that the admiration of gentleman farmers at the "vigorous appearance" of neatly trimmed hedges inspired the widespread adoption of the living fence in his neighborhood.26 According to Kirk, "a farm well hedged, and carefully trimmed annually in each district of the country, in public situations, would spread the propagation of hedging abundantly more than all that I shall say on paper...."27 Despite the statement by agriculturalist C. R. Overman in 1858 that "a man of taste will make a beautiful thing of [the hedge],' the living fence was more than an inherited symbol of wealth, status, and enlighten- ment.28 Caleb Kirk and other gentleman farmers firmly believed that the appearance of a farm fence indicated the virtue of the farmer who constructed it. The notion of virtue was an important concept in the agrarian ideology of the gentleman farmer who believed in the moral and spiritual superiority of agriculture. The American agriculturalist of the early nineteenth century considered properly conducted farming to be the most ancient, innocent, pleasing, noble, honorable, healthy, and irldependent activity of man. Farmers, since they alone were in di- rect contact with Godss nature, were hailed as the chosen people of GodS the repositories of the virtues of honor, manliness, wisdom, patience, self-reliance, providence, intelligence, industry, courage, vigilance, fru- gality, fortitude, benevolence, moral integrity, dignity, and hospitality. This body of ideas, referred to by historians as "agrarianism,' was an essential element of the social philosophy of the gentleman farmer.29 24Kirk "On Hedging. . .

Although the hedge served as a symbol of status and notoriety, the gentleman farmer considered a lavishly adorned en- closure to be undesirable.3l Extravagance was the antithesis of agrarian virtue in that it connoted self-indulgence in idle luxury.32 The beauty of the ideal enclosure derived not from excessive adornment but rather from the simple agrarian character of the farmer who built the fence. The estheticism of the gentleman farmer resulted from an ideology that assigned a high value to the agrarian virtue of industry. The agri- culturalist regarded as beautiful a rural landscape which exhibited the product of the labor of the virtuous yeoman. The thorn hedges advo- cated by Caleb Kirk and English farmers in Delaware required a great deal of care and attention if they were to present as beautiful an appear- ance as Kirk portrayed. The attractiveness of the perfected hedge, therefore, indicated the industry, vigilance, patience, and skill of the farmer who erected the enclosure.33 If neglected, on the other hand, the teenth and Eighteenth Centuries," American Literature 21 (1949): 165; A.

Caleb Kirk adamantly refused to call the wild state of the thorn enclosure a ''hedge,l preferring "hedge row,' something without any sort of regular order. Kirk insisted that the hedge row brought the idea of hedging into disrepute among those who advocated other methods of enclosure.38 The discouraging appearance of the neglected hedge did indeed pro- vide other gentleman farmers possessing Kirk's estheticism with an ar- gument against the cultivation of the living fence. Opponents of the hedge merely pointed to the neglected hedges of Kirk's own neighbor- hood to prove their point. One agriculturalist, assuming the Latin ap- pellation "Cui Bono,' noted in 1823 from his observations of Delaware hedges that only one in twenty-one living fences was properly culti- which supposedly separated him from the common farmer, who viewed physical labor as degrading.

One Delaware newspaper in 1824 defined the very word "virtue" as "the foundation of honour and esteem and the source of all beauty order and happiness in nature"42 The same tabloid noted the following year that '4it is observed at once by every one who passes through a country productive and neatly cultivated, that contentment, morals, and exemplary submission to law and good governmentS are strikingly conspicuous"43 Some years later, the eminent landscape archi- tect, ArldrewJackson Downing, applied this ideology specifically to the hedge when he declared that the planting of live fences connoted wis- dom, patience, and good management.44 Downingss statement summa- rizes over forty years of observations by agriculturalists of Delaware and surrounding areas that the cultivation of hedges was the work of provi- dent, patient, intelligent, and practical yeomen.45 The Delaware Register asserted in 1829 that such a farmer, 4'who keeps his land and his stock in excellent order, need not be ashamed even were Solomon himself pass- ing by.

To Caleb Kirk, the unattended hedge manifested an unthrifty, thoughtless, careless, and unobservant farmer, unwilling to deviate from a conservative reliance on impractical tradition.47 An- other writer looked upon the neglected fence as a sign of a lack of"that intelligence or ambition that makes a farmer independent"48 Closely related to agrarianism in the intellectual climate of the young American republic was the freehold concept, a value system which re- jected productivity and celebrated a pride, security, and self-sufficiency attainable only in a rural setting.49 The freehold concept celebrated the dignity, self-reliance, and autonomy of the yeoman farmer. The posses- sion of land affirmed the independence and liberty of the farmer and proprietorship encouraged the agrarian virtues of frugality, sobriety, industry, and dependability. The autonomy afforded by the ownership of freehold land formed the foundation of the republican thought of the era.50 The farm fence marked the gentleman farmer's delight and pride in landed possessions.5 1 The early nineteenth-century agriculturalist viewed the enclosure as a means of preserving the independence of the virtuous yeoman, for"without a secure and permanent fence, no man can be complete 'lord of his own soil."'52 The enclosure did indeed serve to separate a farmer's cropland from his pasture land, but the fence received most of its attention as a spatial boundary dividing the fields of one farmer from those of another. In serving this purpose, the fence 47Kirk, "On Hedging-No. 6," 403; "Hedging," 5; and"On Thorn Hedges," 186.

Lockean philosophy formed the basis for the gentleman farmer's notion of pri- vate property, the right of a person to exclude others from the use or benefit of a resource. The fence was a physical manifestation of the exploitation of that right. The enclosure provided security from intru- sion for the fruits of the farmer's labor in a society where a high pre- mium was placed on the ownership and control of property.53 Caleb Kirk advocated the hedge partly because he believed it to be an effec- tive enclosure "for the safekeeping of all the valuable and most delicate productions of his [the farmer's] labours of the field"54 James Worth, although he disagreed with Kirk about the utility of the hedge, re- garded fences to be "indispensable to the husbandman as they are the only sure protection to his crops"55 The early nineteenth-century agriculturalist believed that the fence protected the products of a farmer's virtuous toil and allowed the yeo- man to maintain his economic independence. In serving such a noble purpose, the enclosure was viewed by the gentleman farmer as the laudable defender of the inviolable natural right to private property. Anything that violated the sanctity of the fence was dishonorable. Agri- culturalists in the Delaware area during the early nineteenth century constantly described with scorn cattle and other livestock that left pas- ture land and broke through division boundaries to get to croplands. The anthropomorphic rhetoric of these gentleman farmers, referring to " mischievous,' " ungovernable,' "evil,' " molesting,' "breachy,' "depre- datory,' "prowling,'"intruding,' and"craving" livestock, implied that animal transgressions upon enclosed property were threats to the fer- tile field, which was a sign of the virtue of the cultivator.56 Dogs were the most urgent menace to enclosed property in Delaware during the early nineteenth century. Canines were more successful than any other animal in breaching enclosures.

The agricultural press of the area featured numerous petitions to recompense the farmer for losses sustained from the canine molestation of sheep until the state of Delaware finally enacted a dog law in 1839.58 The real antagonists to fencing proponents were not encroaching an- imals, but rather the owners of such animals, who, by their unmindful keeping, allowed their livestock to roam onto the property of other farmers. The negligent husbandman was in this fashion a threat to the freehold concept and to the contemporary principle of private prop- erty. The gentleman farmers of Delaware upheld the concept of English common law, which made the thoughtless keeper of livestock liable for damages done by his animals on the lands of other farmers. Dr. Joseph Muse of Cambridge, Maryland, an advocate of private property and a proponent of English common law, observed in 1824 that every man's land should be "in the eye of the law enclosed and set apart from his neighbour's . . . and every breach of a man's close, carries along with it some damage or other; even the treading down, and bruising the herb- age is damage, and a legal cause of action."59 By the 1 830s, such thought was being recorded in the court books of Delaware, as the case of Thomas Richardson v. John Carr testifies: "The Court charged the jury that if a cow be found trespassing on another's property, the owner of the property may impound her, or sue for damages, or drive her out.... 60 The greatest perceived threat to the freehold concept and to the no- 57The threat of dogs to sheep was a national phenomenon during the nineteenth cen- tury.

Fencing advocates of the early nineteenth century described these individuals as straggling, depredatory felons, obvious antagonists to the virtuous citizen who constructed enclosures to pro- tect the fruits of his dutiful labor.6l The fence maintained an important position in the rural landscape of a society whose landowners closely guarded the notion of private property. Delaware proprietors in 1831 endorsed a legislative measure that protected enclosures against those who stole fencing materials from the property of others.62 Because they were designed to delineate division boundaries and to prevent breaches of propriety, fences promoted good fellowship among neighbors and encouraged peace and civility among landholders.63 The idea that "good fences make good neighbors" contributed to the belief held by Caleb Kirk and his peers that the enclosure benefited society as a whole and that the farmer who erected a fence did so at least partly from a sense of public duty. As a notable suyect within the context of agricultural improvement, the topic of enclosures was seen by agrarians of the early nineteenth century as one of national concern. An article on hedging in one Delaware newspaper of the period elucidated, "What- ever regards the agricultural interest involves the good of the whole community not merely incidentally, or in a few unimportant points but directly and extensively.'s64 Fencing advocates of the early 1800s tried to convince farmers to adopt particular modes of enclosure by appealing to their sense of patri- otism. Gentleman farmers believed that every good citizen should erect an enclosllre not only for the sake of his own security, but also to demon- strate his love of country and sense of moral obligation. This austere devotion to the common good, dubbed "public virtue" by historians, was an essential element of republicanism, the contemporary belief that the foundation of a republic rested upon the shoulders of a virtuous and independent citizenry dedicated first and foremost to public service.65 6lKirk, "On Hedging-No. 6," 403; William Cobbett, "The American Gardener; or, A Treatise on the Situation, Soil, Fencing and Laying-Out of Gardens . . . ," American Farmer 4 (20 December 1822): 305; and Kirk, "On Thorn Hedges," 188. 62"A supplement to the act entitled 'An act providing for the punishment of certain crimes and misdemeanors,"' in Laws of the State of Delaware, from . . .

During the nineteenth century, social responsibility meant more than the preservation of a morally upstanding nation of virtuous, indepen- dent agrarians. The rise of capitalism was grafting a new meaning of public duty onto the beliefs of the classical republican agriculturalist. The traditional concept of public virtue, involving the Spartan subordi- nation of self-interest to the greater common good, was at this time as- suming a more contemporary definition that placed a high priority on the productivity of the enterprising citizen.66 The gentleman farmer of the period believed that the yeoman who wished to operate in behalf of the state strove to increase the economic output of his farm.67 The men who wrote essays on fencing in the contemporary agricultural press were part of an effort to introduce improvements in farm methods for the sake of increasing the productivity of their communities. One con- tributor wrote in a Delaware newspaper in 1828, ". . . it is the duty of the people of every village, town, or city . . . to promote . . . the general pros- perity of the place in which they reside...."68 Advocates of fencing in Delaware were seeking such prosperity for their region at a time when the impoverished soil of local farms was forcing residents to emigrate to more virgin lands to the west.69 One of these advocates, Samuel Black, Delaware's most outspoken champion of regional productivity during the early 1800s, wrote in 1820 that "it is obviously the interest of every man in these States, who possesses any thing, which attaches him to his natal soil, to join heartily in the effort of retrieving the credit, the pros- perity, and the wealth of his neighborhood."70 Black added that "there are many advantages possessed by these, over the western States, which ought, and which would, if the land was properly managed and im- proved, induce an emigration to, instead offrom them.''7l The proper Happiness, 26; Shalhope,John Taylor of Caroline, 3; and Wood, American Republic, 68. 66McCoy, The Elusive Republic, 77. 67Gordon Wood and John Kasson have asserted that republicanism in its true context was anticapitalistic. See Kasson, Civilizing thve Machine, 37, and Wood, American Republic, 418-19. In nineteenth-century America, however, the concept of public virtue came to include the primary goal of capitalism, the increase of economic produce available to society. 68Delaware Register and Farmers' Magazine, 8 November 1828.

The enclosure, as a defender of private property, not only preserved personal independence, but it also secured the value that the husbandman added to the earth's productive capacity.73 The fence assumed even more importance in the minds of Physiocratic agri- culturalists who believed that farming more than any other occupation was indispensible to the material productivity of a society.74 This perception of the fence on the part of the gentleman farmer invoked all except one of the sturdy character traits stressed by the free- hold concept. While the enclosure symbolized the independence of the landowner, the fence was never meant to insure the self-sufficiency of the yeoman. For the greater good of an emergent capitalist society, the cultivator had to be a commercial productive unit rather than a subsis- tence farmer. Although the old agrarian virtue of self-sufficiency had been abandoned, the acquisition of wealth itself came to take on a virtu- ous meaning. The agriculturalists of the early nineteenth century rea- soned that material well-being was a mark of God's grace and a natural consequence of those private virtues of frugality, industry, economy, 72"Farming," Delaware Free Press, 24 April 1830. 73Drew R.

Physiocratic doctrine as defined in this essay has been analyzed by historians in such studies as: Henry Higgs, The Physiocrats: Six Lectures on the French Economistes ot the Eighteenth Century (New York: Langland Press, 1972); Leo Marx, The Machine in the Garden: Technolozy and the Pastoral Ideal in America (London: Oxford University Press, 1964); Moore, "Majority and Minority," 356; Jacob Oser, The Evolution of Economic Thought (New York: Harcourt, Brace and World, 1970), 29; and Wayne C. Rohrer and Lewis H. Douglas, The Agrarian Tradition in America, Dualism and Change (Indianapolis, Ind.: Bobbs-Merrill, 1969). Caleb Kirk could not have been an extreme Physiocrat, since he involved himself in many industrial activities. Kirk and other Wilmington area businessmen (including the self-proclaimed Physiocrat, Eleuthere Irenee du Pont) formed in 1813 the Brandywine Mill Seat Company, which vested property rights to manufacturers in order to increase economic output. Kirk also owned and operated grist-, saw-, fulling-, and barley mills along the Brandywine River. He was also president of the Farmers and Manufacturers and Friends of the American System of Christiana Hundred ( 1828), chairman of the Man- ufacturers and Persons Friendly to the Protection of American Industry ( 182 8), and pres- ident of the Society for the Promotion of American Manufactures (1817).

One agriculturalist noted in 1812 that "public spirit appears to be nothing more than another name for the enterprise of individuals, whether in private or public life."76 Privatism, the association of an individual's mate- rial gain with social utility, justified private concerns where republican- ism had equated individualistic impulses with selfishness.77 Samuel Black confirmed the gentleman farmer's belief in privatism when he stated in 1820, "If every man who is in possession of land could be persuaded to arouse himself from this fatal lethargy, shake off his antiquated habits and modes of thinking on the subject of land, and do his duty as he ought, he could not fail to be amply compensated for his exertions."78 Believing that the farm fence was a reflection of the enlightened self- interest of the proprietor, enclosure advocates of the early nineteenth century appealed to the farmer's private interests as well as to his public virtue. Caleb Kirk himself, while believing that the practice of hedging benefited the greater good of society, admitted that "a venture must compensate one for the time and anxiety sacrificed-otherwise it would not be in one's private interest to embark on that venture."79 Ag- riculturalists like Kirk, affected by physiocratic and capitalist thought, regarded the enclosure as an essential requisite for the profitable keep- 75Historians have pointed to the Puritan ethic and to Montesquieu's notion of the "spirit of commerce" in their discussions of capitalistic virtues; see Giddens, The Protestant Ethic, 4- 5; Donald B Marti, To Improve the Soil and the Mind; Agricultural Societies, Journals, and Schools in the Northeastern States, 1791-1865 (Ann Arbor, Mich.: University Microfilms, 1979), 204-5; and McCoy, TheElusiveRepublic, 77. 76"Introductory Observations on the Origin, Design and Profitable Advantages of the Merino Society of the Middle States of North America," Constitution o) the Merino Society of NorthAmerica, PremiumsProposed For1812 and 18]3 (Philadelphia, 1811), 4. 77The term "privatism" was first developed by Sam Bass Warner in The Private City: Philadelphia in Three Periods of Growth (Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 1968), 3- 4.

According to the utilitarian value system, the perfected fence was an element of the landscape that made profit maximization possible.83 The pragmatism of the agriculturalist of- ten led him to promote one form of enclosure or to denounce another form. Thus James Worth was led to maintain that "the ground taken up by a hedge, with the exhaustion of the soil, would, in my opinion, render them an unprofitable gift; and I can attribute their introduction into this country, in its present state, only to the prejudice of foreigners [Englishmen] who have been accustomed to them by necessity."84 Although not quite as impractical as James Worth would have had farmers believe, the thorn hedges of the mid-Atlantic states fell into dis- repute during the 1 840s. Despite efforts by Caleb Kirk's successors in Del- aware,85 most local farmers abandoned the planting of live fences after 1847, the year that many hedges in the area were killed by the apple borer.86 The borer destroyed the notion that the thorn enclosures of the Delaware region were signs of enlightened self-interest, but the insect did not ruin the subsequent adoption of different forms of hedging in other parts of the country (particularly the Osage orange fences of the mid- century Midwest); nor did the borer eradicate the symbolism of the per- fected fence as it has been outlined in this paper.

The ideal enclosure was a demon- stration of the virtue of the yeoman farmer, for its beauty derived from the simple agrarian morality of the husbandman. The fence symbolized the agriculturalist's delight in landed possessions; it was a visual repre- sentation of the farmer's independence. The best enclosures were utili- tarian as well as esthetic, for they safeguarded the fruits of the yeoman's virtuous labor and defended the landowner's natural right to property. The perfect farm division indicated not only private virtue, but public virtue as well, for it promoted the general welfare of a young, capitalist, republican society whose goals were peace and prosperity. At the same time, the perfect enclosure ref lected the enlightened self-interest of the farmer concerned with making a profit. In playing these interrelated roles in the society of the gentleman farmer, the farm fence reflected the intricacies of the prominent social philosophies of the period and provided a medium for discussions of property, status, and virtue. 87John Ashton Warder, filedges and Evergreens . . .
