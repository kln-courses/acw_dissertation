Its vampiric features have led some ethnographers to assume European in- fluence upon this indigenous shape-shifter. A survey of  its ethnographic and linguistic documentation in Pre-Columbian, colonial, and modern sources delimits the creature’s distribution to Pacific Central America, Oaxaca, Central Mexico, and the Huasteca region of  Northern Mexico. The societies that feature the teyollohcuani are almost exclusively Oto-Manguean (OM) or of  Nahua communities that have had extensive contact with the former, so this essay proposes an Oto-Manguean origin for the teyollohcuani. Similar folklore in Europe includes the Latin strix, but the presence of  related creatures in various non-Western traditions sup- ports independent innovation for the teyollohcuani. Spanish witchcraft trials and treatises provide no evidence for this category aside from those written in Spanish American contexts, which refutes a Spanish origin. Spanish influences upon the teyollohcuani were introduced instead through Christian discourses on witchcraft, and contemporary African religious traditions influenced indigenous concepts of  the witch’s control over the shape-shifting alter ego. These influences are evident in ethnographic de- scriptions of  the teyollohcuani among the Nahua of  the Huasteca, where the impact of  national and global media upon accounts of  the superhuman creature must also be considered. Finally, the presence of  the bloodsucking witch in Mexican and international media attests to the modern dialectic between indigenous folklore and global media, which have maintained the teyollohcuani as a vital and distinct folk category in Mesoamerica. A creature that can transform into animal guises in order to play casual pranks, steal other’s food, bewitch personal enemies, or maintain social integrity, the nagual is one of  the most enduring, ubiquitous, and iconic figures of  Mesoamerican folklore, from indigenous tales to national media. Despite the nagual’s conceptual fluidity, however, Foster and others have recommended that ethnographers consider local categories for the animal alter ego among diverse communities, for the shape-shifting nagual is not always equivalent with an individual’s tonal companion spirit, even if  the two categories are related.1 Another species of  shape-shifter, the teyollohcuani, or “bloodsucking witch,” must likewise be distinguished from the nagual because the teyollohcuani, which typically converts into Flores Medina. I wholeheartedly thank the people who extended me their time, patience, and hospitality in Chicontepec and Ixhuatlán de Madero, especially the Nahua of  Tepecxitla, El Tordillo, and Tecomate, and the Otomí of  Cruz Blanca: tlawel tlaskamati and EmmE! khamádi. 1 George E.

Although vampirism in Mexican folklore is often assumed to be Euro- pean in origin, this essay will argue that the bloodsucking shape-shifter is essentially indigenous, and a survey of  indigenous Mesoamerican witch folklore more accurately locates an OM origin in Eastern and Central Mexico, with a Southern Uto-Aztecan (SUA) stratum of  illness beliefs associated with soul-consuming spectral avians. Even though European and African witchcraft practices did influence this concept since the colonial period, evidence of  vampire folklore is difficult to attribute to specifically Western European influence. Comparable versions of  the strix witch from different continents attest to its global distribution, which com- plicates a European origin. Moreover, references to bloodsucking witch- craft are absent in Spain until after the conquest of  Mexico, its subsequent upsurge possibly influenced by imports of  Mexican folklore. Modern discourses on vampirism in the Huasteca lowlands of  northern Veracruz, particularly through the Nahua teyollohcuani supernatural, represent a dynamic synthesis of  these multiple strands of  vampirism and witch- craft from Mesoamerican, Western European, African, and twentieth- century media. I must early on present a necessary caveat for my terminology: I use “vampire” in reference to the teyollohcuani only as the term is under- stood within contexts local to the Huasteca, for many of  my consultants readily translated the Nahuatl term to this. The most precise definition for “vampire” includes that the creature is undead, which is not a necessary condition for the teyollohcuani (nor for Romanian entities such as the strigoi, for that matter). Many comparative studies on vampires have focused on this undead quality, embodied in the vampire as blood- consuming “revenant,”2 which does not account for living blood drinkers such as the strigoi or the teyollohcuani. Similarly, I must differentiate the bloodsucking witch from the shape-shifting nagual because the latter does not specify whether blood consumption is a defining attribute of  the shape- shifter in question. In fact, many contemporary communities distinguish between these two supernatural categories; I will address this below. I will use teyollohcuani as a general term for the supernatural creature in question because it has the longest ethnographic documentation— from 1561 to the present day—and is the most etymologically transparent, meaning “customarily eats human hearts” in Mexica Nahuatl. My working 2 See, e.g., Alan Dundes, “The Vampire as Bloodthirsty Revenant: A Psychoanalytic Post Mortem,” in The Vampire: A Casebook, ed.

These defining criteria will thereby exclude creatures such as cannibalistic giants that cannot transform and shape- shifting beings such as the nagual unless locally recognized as an eater of  human blood or hearts.3 For the nagual and the teyollohcuani can coexist as distinct entities, and, although both entail a shape-shifting alter ego, often only the latter feeds on human blood.4 Table 1 compares the defining features of  the teyollohcuani with those of  several other super- natural beings addressed in this essay. the teyollohcuani and its distribution in contemporary mexico Although this essay presents a diachronic study of  the teyollohcuani in Mexico, an introduction to the creature would be soundest through its folk expressions in the twentieth- and twenty-first centuries, the period in which it has been most extensively documented and adequately described. De- spite the historical and geographic breadth of  the documentation, it has remained notably consistent. nahua sources Contemporary references to the teyollohcuani have been documented since the turn of  the twentieth century, for Eduard Seler cites it as the name for the fourteenth day-sign in the 260-day ritual calendar used among the Nahua of  Guatemala.5 Modern cognates of  teyollohcuani have been docu- mented from Eastern Huasteca Nahuatl6 speakers in the municipality of 3 I addressed the complications of  the nagual as an analytical term in Edgar Martín del Campo, “The Nagual Hiding in Shadows: Metamorphic Supernaturals, Contested Discourse, and the Complications of  Fieldwork in the Huasteca Veracruzana of  Northeast Mexico” (PhD diss., University at Albany, 2006), esp. 3–20, 273–78. 4 Among the Nahua of  Tlaxcala, see Hugo G.

The term tlauipuchin appears only on the Spanish side of  Molina’s Nahuatl- Spanish dictionary, where it is simply “another witch.” My translation is based on Carochi’s transcription of  the plural form tlahuìpochtin, which Carochi translates into bruxos or “witches”; Horacio Carochi, Grammar of the Mexican Language with an Explanation of Its Adverbs, trans. J. Lockhart ([1645]; repr., Stanford, CA: Stanford University Press, 2001). Carochi’s orthography is problematic because of  its morphological ambiguity. Karttunen suggests that the long /a/ is the “discrepancy” (Francis Karttunen, An Analytical Dictionary of Nahuatl [Austin: University of  Texas Press, 1983], 270), in which case the word would be derived from the root /tlahuih-/, “curse.” I propose that the discrepancy is actually the “saltillo” coda in the second syllable; without this, the /tlahu(i)-/ root would indicate “red ochre/firelight” (270). This would buttress the association of  the tlahuepoche with fiery flight and breath, which has been described since the Early Colonial period through authors such as </page> <page sequence="6"> 112 Mexican Vampires masaka(-t) or “deer serpent” in the Sierra Poblana;11 nagual/na:wal in the Sierra Poblana12 and the Balsas River valley of  Guerrero;13 chichime or “(blood)suckers” in Tetelcingo, Morelos;14 and tlaciqui/tlacique in the Milpa Alta.15 All of  these names ultimately describe the same figure, a shape-shifting witch whose alter ego becomes usually a turkey or vulture or other large bird in order to fly at night into children’s bedrooms and drink their blood—often lethally. The witch may also travel as a flying fireball visible at night.16 A similar type of  supernatural being is known in Nahuatl as the female mometzcopinqui, “she reproduces her own thighs,” by replacing her human legs with those of  a turkey upon transformation. This witch also substitutes woven mats for her arms, by which she is able to fly into house windows to suck on infants’ or children’s blood.17 The mometzcopinqui has early colonial documentation, for the Franciscan friar Bernardino de Sahagún related that such witches were born on the calendar day-sign of  One Wind.18 Modern Nahua folklore on the mometzcopinqui has been docu- Fray Juan Bautista, Juan de Torquemada, and the more skeptical author of  the Codex Carolina (Alfredo López Austin, “Cuarenta clases de magos del mundo náhuatl,” in Estudios de Cul- tura Náhuatl, vol. 7 [Mexico City: Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México, 1967], 93). 11 James M.

Several of  them are from regions where the Otomí have had extensive contact with the Nahua, a point that will be further considered below. It may have been the Sierra Otomí who also inspired the concept of  the parasitic shape-shifter among the Sierra Totonac, who refer to the ability as tapalaqni, “change form”; the wild pheasant is especially nefarious, for this guise is reputed to suck the souls of  sleeping children.24 The Otomí cases include the bloodsucking pIní/pÁni in the southern Huasteca region of  northern Veracruz and Hidalgo25 and, in the Sierra de Puebla, the nagual “witch” in Spanish26 or puSxwai in Otomí.27 The Otomí version of  the bloodsucking shape-shifter has also been described in the Mezquital Valley of  northern Hidalgo.28 19 Madsen, The Virgin’s Children, 202–3.

In a Chinantec folktale from northern Oaxaca, a shape-shifting Chinantec curandero or ritual healer transformed into a cat to suck blood; however, the blood is not an infant’s but from the person who had bewitched the healer’s infirmed client. The witch’s blood was surreptitiously drawn and fed to the patient to ensure his recovery.32 Linguistic cognates from several OM languages, especially from Oaxaca, suggest that the semantic relationship between witchcraft and (blood)sucking may originate in Proto-OM. Although several cognates mean either “witch” or “suck (blood),” the tï ? 2vï 2 root in the San Miguel and San Esteban Mixtec dialects means both. Rensch reconstructs the OM protoform **(H)we(n),33 its semantic elements of  blood consumption and witchcraft having diverged since. An OM protoform that entails both such elements well supports the present hypothesis that the bloodsucking witch originated within this language group. It therefore could have originated among the founders of  the Tehuacán tradition of  5000–2300 BP.34 The bloodsucking witch would then be one of  the demonstrably earliest super- natural categories in Mesoamerica. 29 Ordóñez Cabezas, Pames, 26.

The abundance of  Nahua, Oto-Manguean, and Oaxacan sources for the teyollohcuani is even more striking upon considering the number of  neighboring communities that do not feature such a being in their folklore. Other case studies from Oaxaca distinguish the shape-shifter concept from that of  the tonal companion spirit, but among these cases neither variety of  the animal alter ego relates to blood consumption. The distinc- tion is found among the Mixtec and Afro-Mexicans of  Jamiltepec and Jicaltepec,38 the Huave of  San Mateo del Mar,39 and the Chatino of Yaitepec.40 In Oaxaca only the Zapotec of  Mitla both distinguish be- tween the companion spirit and the shape-shifter and identify witches in the latter category that may additionally suck infant blood.41 the teyollohcuani’s absence elsewhere in mesoamerica The folklore of  indigenous Mesoamericans beyond the Sierra de Puebla, the Central Mexico Valley, and Oaxaca scarcely tell of  bloodsucking witches.

Roberto Williams García documented a variant of  this tale from the linguistically related Tepehua (Mitos tepehuas [Mexico City: SepSetentas, 1972], 112–14). 43 Benito Peralta 6, and Fernando Olmos Can$edo, Relatos Pai Pai: Kuriut’trab pai pai ([1994]; repr., Mexico City: Consejo Nacional Para 1a Cultura y las Artes, 2002), features an account of  the coyote, which used to eat human hearts, but its description satisfies neither of the criteria I have listed for the teyollohcuani as a witch. 44 Wonderly’s Zoque texts on the nagual in Copainalá, Chiapas, do include an account of  a woman who transformed into an eagle to bewitch her victims at night, but she did not consume blood (William L. Wonderly, “Textos en zoque sobre el concepto del nagual,” Tlalocan 2, no. 2 [1946]: 102–3). 45 Other sources on the Tlapanec have no mention of  the entity. Schultze-Jena’s descrip- tion of  the alter-ego concept does not entail blood consumption according to the Tlapanec of the southern Sierra Madre Occidental (Leonhard Schultze-Jena, Bei den Azteken, Mixteken und Tlapaneken der Sierra Madre del Sur von Mexiko, Indiana 3 [Jena: Gustav Fischer, 1938], 132–35, cited in Köhler,“Ethnographische Notizen zum Alter Ego-Glauben und Nagualismus in Mexiko,“ 31–32).

Beals does document Tarascan beliefs concerning witches that can transform into animals such as cats and dogs or birds such as owls and roosters, but they operate only to steal something from or leave a bewitching object with a victim at night. The Tarascan word for “witch” is sLkuájpiri (156–58).

In a dream state Rarámuri sorcerers may summon oromá or “familiar” avian alter egos to afflict their victims by stealing and consuming their souls.54 A child who has been so afflicted may live for only one or a few days afterward because of  their weak defenses against such attacks.55 As with the teyollohcuani, the oromá attack upon infants is lethal, but it extracts the infant’s vital energy in the soul rather than in the actual blood. An important contrast between the oromá and most variants of  the teyollohcuani is that the oromá is the sor- cerer’s animal companion, but the teyollohcuani physically transforms into its alter ego. The only exceptions to this physical transformation are de- scribed among the Nahua of  the Huasteca Veracruzana56 and the Huave of  San Mateo, Oaxaca,57 where the witch projects the psyche from his or her body; it is the projected psyche that undergoes metamorphosis, not 50 David Yetman, The Guarijíos of the Sierra Madre: Hidden People of Northwestern Mexico (Albuquerque: University of  New Mexico Press, 2002). 51 Mary Beck Moser and Stephen A.

The relationship between the crow and the lover was implied (197– 98). Although the heart’s integrity is the foundation to bodily health among the Mayo (191), whether the familiar crow directly attacked this organ is unclear from the Yaqui account. 53 For example, on the Mayo, N.

Nor is blood consumption, which characterizes the teyollohcuani, found among any of  the SUA cases aside from the Nahua.

Maya witches are able to transform into animals but never to consume human blood.63 In Maya folklore only the (vampire) bat sucks human blood,64 but it is not identi- fied as a transformed human.65 The Tzeltal of  Oxchuch, Chiapas believe that an agchamel, a person endowed with an especially powerful nagual alter ego, may direct it to eat the “soul” of  a community offender and cause him illness, thereby punishing the guilty party.66 However, the nagual of  the agchamel neither drinks blood nor attacks infants.

The witch K’olené of  Teenek mythology ate cooked children, but she did not transform into animals nor suck blood.73 The absence of  the teyollohcuani beyond Nahua, Oto-Manguean, and the occasional neighbor community sources delimits its original ethnic and geographic circulation in Eastern and Central Mexico and Oaxaca and perhaps even its origins in Pre-Columbian Mexican folklore. blood- and heart-consuming animals in pre-columbian mexican art blood sacrifice in mesoamerican religion Motifs of  human sacrifice are ubiquitous in Pre-Columbian Mesoamerican symbolism, and images of  blood and (human) hearts are prolific in lapidary and painted art alike. Underlying these symbolic expressions of  human sacrifice is a cosmological economy of  life energy contained in the blood that is exchanged between gods and humans. Sacrifice was a reciprocal activity between gods and humans, for in mythic time it was the creator deities’ autosacrificial bloodletting that animated the bones that would then form the first human beings.74 The vitality of  human blood, in turn, was 67 Evon Z.

Blood consumption therefore appears fre- quently in Mesoamerican art as performed by the gods. This fundamental concept in Mesoamerican religion contextualizes images of  blood and heart consumption by avian, feline, and skeletal creatures that together elucidate a complex of  symbols associated with the Pre-Columbian teyollohcuani. blood- and heart-consuming birds in mesoamerican pictorial  manuscripts The presence of  bloodsucking and heart-eating birds in the Pre-Columbian pictorial manuscripts of  Central Mexico demonstrates that even though they alone are not evidence of  shape-shifting, the combination of  blood and heart consumption with avian imagery already existed in Mesoamerica prior to European contact. Eagles are especially depicted as heart-eating birds, which could be best explained through their relation with the sun on its diurnal path and with the sacrifices to it. These relations are apparent on plate 1 of  the Codex Laud, in which an eagle in variegated plumage touches its beak to a ring of  blood circumscribing the solar disk, as well as on the upper center of  plate 45 of  the Codex Borgia, featuring a deity in the guise of  an eagle descending upon a striped human sacrifice to draw out his heart.75 On plate 7 of  the Codex Cospi, the third column of  the bottom border features an eagle with a heart and bejeweled blood in its mouth.76 Hummingbirds, already disposed to feed by sucking nectar from flowers, are easily converted into bloodsucking birds in Mesoamerican art, such as the four hummingbirds puncturing a bat-guised figure, whence issues a stream of  bejeweled blood, atop Codex Borgia 44.77 Other bird images include a corvine bird drinking blood from an opened coffer in the upper register of  Codex Laud 42 and a quail with what appears to be a heart in its mouth in plate 61 of  the Codex Vaticanus B.78 The abundance 75 Codex Laud, MS Laud Misc. 678/Bodleian Library Oxford, introduction by Cottie A.

Seler relies on the rounded, elongated heads of  the two felines on the left margin of  plate 15 in the Codex Fejérváry-Mayer to identify them as jaguars and furthermore as teyollohcuani as they face a human heart between them.79 Seler confirms the felines’ identification as jaguars and as teyollohcuani because both were associated with divina- tion and magic.80 The most explicit relation between the jaguar and the teyollohcuani is the Guatemalan Nahua use of  the latter name for the fourteenth of  the twenty day-signs in the ritual calendar. The Guatemalan Nahua substitution of  teyollohcuani for the jaguar in the Central Mexican calendar systems clarifies the presence of  the pustulated human skeleton within the register for the jaguar day-sign in plate 23 of  the Codex Borgia, wherein it drinks blood from one of  two human hearts held in its hands. Perhaps, then, the pairs of  skull-headed figures consuming human hearts in plates 3 and 5 of  the Codex Cospi are also teyollohcuani;81 the second of  the pair on Codex Cospi 3 additionally occurs in a set of  day-signs in- cluding the jaguar. Despite the significant amount of  evidence for bloodsucking animal and supernatural figures in the Central Mexican pictorial codices, the ultimate obstacle to identifying these definitively as teyollohcuani is that no written texts, not even by Spanish commentators, identify them as such. The earliest written accounts of  the teyollohcuani were produced by the Spanish after the conquest, albeit with Nahua collaborators, and it fre- quents the historical corpus of  New Spain. colonial mexican sources on the teyollohcuani witchcraft in colonial nahuatl texts Colonial chroniclers were enthralled with blood and heart consumption, given the extent of  their descriptions of  human sacrifice and ritual canni- balism—the epitome of  the exotic and cruel quality of  paganism in New 79 Codex Fejérváry-Mayer, 12014 M.

Despite the chroniclers’ fascina- tion with the latter, their accounts were inconsistent, which informed the consequent translations of  teyollohcuani in contemporary scholarship. Two principal meanings for teyollohcuani emerge from colonial sources, the arguably earliest and most literal being its definition ascribed in Alonso de Molina’s (1555–71) dictionary: bruxa que chupa la sangre, “blood- sucking witch.” The other earliest written reference to the teyollohcuani appears in Bernardino de Sahagún’s (1561) Primeros Memoriales, but it presents the alternate meaning, namely, “bewitcher of  people.”84 The most comprehensive definition for the teyollohcuani, and by extension the most resonant with modern discourses on the entity, would entail both mean- ings described in the colonial corpus: a human who afflicts illness upon others through witchcraft, specifically by drawing from the vital force contained in their victims’ hearts.85 That the attributes of  the teyollohcuani are uniformly counted within lists of  witchcraft abilities buttresses the Nahua relationship between witchcraft and blood and heart consumption. Other colonial sources re- main vague on the witch’s exact attributes, however. Hernando Ruiz de Alarcón’s (1629) first treatise in his Treatise on the Heathen Superstitions does not explicitly define the teyollohcuani but equates it with the texoxmi [sic] and the tetlachihuiani sorcerers.86 Additionally, in both the (1609) Crónica Mexicáyotl and the (1631?) Codex Chimalpáhin, the malevolent sorceress Malinalxochitl, sister to the Mexica Nahua patron deity Huitzilo- pochtli, is described through a list of  bewitching abilities, among them being a teyollohcuani.87 Whether the teyollohcuani had a Pre-Columbian 82 Serge Gruzinski, Painting the Conquest: The Mexican Indians and the European Re- naissance, trans.

The earliest reference to Nahua bloodsucking witchcraft appears in Andrés de Olmos’s (1553) Treatise on Sorceries and Spells, specifically in a chapter on the human sacrifices that the Nahua had performed to the devil before their conversion to Christianity—and the doom of  apostasy through reverting to such sacrificial murder in secret. Old women were of specific interest because it was they who as midwives assisted in child- birth delivery. Olmos warns, however, that the devil simply gave the elderly women an opportunity to suck newborns’ blood to maintain their diabolical rites of  sacrificial bloodletting.89 (Olmos translates this directly from paragraph IX of  Martín de Castañega’s [1529] Treatise on Super- stitions and Sorceries, to which I will return.) The Franciscan friar iden- tifies such elderly women as a bloodsucking type of  naguales, whom he had described generically as witches in service to the devil.90 Similarly, Sahagún’s (1577) General History of the Things of New Spain ascribes the sucking of  children’s blood to the nagual: “the nahualli is properly named ‘witch’ that at night scares men and sucks from children.”91 Although Sahagún’s General History does not identify the bloodsucking witch as teyollohcuani, it includes all of  its attributes, particularly possess- ing an alter ego that could assume animal forms.

This was the dominant discourse through which indigenous specialists’ activi- ties were interpreted, described, and finally redefined in New Spain.92 christian reevaluations of the teyollohcuani An inevitable question arises: Given that all of  the extant references to the teyollohcuani or the bloodsucking nagual were written by clergy or converts, to what extent did Spanish Christian discourses on witchcraft inform the description of  these supernatural beings? In other words, how much of  these descriptions was colored by European religion and folklore, either through writers’ bias or colonial acculturation? As the Dominican friar Diego Durán was documenting Nahua oral history for the (1576–79) Book of the Gods and Rites, he was cautious of  biblically redrawn accounts of  Pre-Columbian Mexico, such as a Nahua’s retelling of  the saga of  the Toltec priest Topiltzin as a parallel to Exodus.93 The condemnations of the bloodsucking witch’s “devilry” notwithstanding, I venture to argue that the sucking of  children’s blood was an actual Pre-Columbian practice, albeit a medical one. Furthermore, I have already described the extent of blood- and heart-consuming supernatural creatures in the pictorial codices of  Pre-Columbian central Mexico. Blood consumption was therefore a reality in both the social and the fantastic worlds of  central Mexico before European contact. Why, then, is it so readily assumed to have European origin? I now turn to the evolution of  bloodsucking shape-shifters in Pre- Renaissance folklore and the fallacies in assuming a Spanish source to their Mexican counterparts. strix and vampire in latin and later sources the strix The clearest rationale for attributing central Mexican bloodsucking witch- craft to a European influence is that a similar concept had emerged in the strix, a shape-shifting witch who, by rubbing a magical salve over her body, could transform into a bird, often an owl or other night bird, to disem- bowel and consume infants or to suck blood from sleeping humans.94 The 92 Martín del Campo, The Nagual Hiding in Shadows, 54–59, 133–34. 93 Diego Durán, Book of the Gods and Rites and the Ancient Calendar, trans.

That other contemporary societies did have laws against false accusations concerning the strix, such as the striga in the Germanic Lex Salica, suggests that the bloodsucking witch was feared as a real menace in popular thought, which held that such witches acted collectively. By the early eleventh century Burchard of Worms’s Corrector, sive Medicus would also address such popular “superstitions” concerning cannibalistic witches.98 These beliefs would prevail in central Europe for centuries. In 1427 Bernardino of  Siena wrote a sermon condemning a woman named Finicella, a witch who confessed to sucking the blood of  thirty infants in Rome.99 The late sixteenth- century Malleus Maleficarum would return to the problem of  child-eating witches in Question XI. In other European lands, the bloodsucking shape- shifter would locally adopt new features, such as no longer having to be alive to wander about and consume the vital fluids of  its human (and live- stock) prey. Thus rose the vampire. the vampire As a bloodsucking revenant, the vampire has been extensively documented from European folktales, especially in Eastern Europe, where it has taken an iconic position in both local and global lore, whose adaptations in modern media would uniquely influence teyollohcuani folklore in twenty-first- century Mexico. The vampire, too, shares semantic relations with the strix, as evinced from the Romanian strigoi, which may refer to an either living or dead bloodsucking witch—its precise meaning varying across local communities.100 Drawing from Brückner’s etymological notes,101 I pre- viously compared the convergent evolution of  the Eastern Huasteca Nahua for a Peruvian version eats human hearts, and a Chinese owl-witch sucks children’s brains (95–96). 95 Kirby Flower Smith, trans., The Elegies of Albius Tibullus ([1913]; repr., Darmstadt: Wissenschaftliche Buchgesellschaft, 1964), 302–3; cited in Scobie, “Strigiform Witches,” 79, 79 n. 26a). 96 Ovid, Fasti VI 131–68; cited in Cohn, Europe’s Inner Demons, 162. 97 Cohn, Europe’s Inner Demons. 98 Ibid., 163–66.

The presence of  the word “vampire” in Western Europe does not help, for it was not recorded there until in English in 1688, in French in 1693; and in Latin in 1749.105 If  a bloodsucking entity were to exist in Spain or else- where in Western Europe, it has to be sought with a name other than “vampire.” However it is named, the entity that could be most credibly related to Mexican concepts of  the teyollohcuani would have to be the European contemporary that shared the most elements with it, particularly the avian alter ego and the bloodsucking infanticide that both defined the strix. Finally, to attribute confidently a Spanish influence of  a bloodsuck- ing, avian (or other zoomorphic) alter ego upon the teyollohcuani, Spanish data on this concept must exist prior to the earliest documentation of blood- and heart-consuming supernaturals in New Spain. They do not. spanish cannibalistic witches the earliest spanish sources Written in Logroño in 1529, Martín de Castañega’s Treatise on Super- stitions and Sorceries is not only the “first independent book on witch- craft composed in a vernacular language to reach print,”106 but it also features the earliest mention of  bloodsucking witchcraft that I could find from a Spanish source.107 According to Paragraph IX, now that the pagan 102 “Nightjar” in German is Hexe, also meaning “witch.” Ginzburg compares this to the Tukana of  Colombia, who believe that the souls of  the dead transform into nightjars to suck human blood.

Olmos’s New Spain adoption of  Castañega’s account would imply a clearly Spanish origin for the purported practice but for the detail that Castañega had cited a New World context immediately prior: “Today [the devil’s] disciples do the same [sacrifice], as is recounted of the idolaters of  the New World; and where sacrifices can’t be done publicly the devil makes disciples kill children in the most subtle and secret ways possible.”108 I admit that this passage is pivotal to my argument. Given that no independent treatise had heretofore been written on witchcraft, we have no precedent in Spain with which to compare Castañega’s account. Other Spanish authors were aware of  the strix, however, which Bartolomé de las Casas described in chapter 92 of  the Apologética his- toria as having a Latin source.109 Las Casas began compiling information for the Apologética in 1527, two years prior to the publication of  Martín de Castañega’s Treatise on Superstitions, and it is significant that Las Casas was writing in Chiapas, Mexico—in other words, a Spanish American context, where strix witch beliefs are more common than anywhere else in the world.110 The fact that the two earliest Spanish texts on blood- sucking witchcraft invoke New World contexts complicates a European influence. We can, however, observe a European interpretation of  these New World instances, as evident from these earliest Spanish writings and from those written in New Spain. witchcraft trials in early modern spain The other complication with finding a Spanish source for the teyollohcuani is that trial documents on Spanish bloodsucking witchcraft are scarce and postdate several of  the New Spain documents cited above. Such testi- monials in Spain were based on the bloody wounds of  the deceased infant, evidence that a witch had snuck into the house to perforate it, often at several body parts whence it was found bleeding.

Maio and Pearson translate the passage as follows: “Other witches are called vampires, after a species of  bird which is accustomed to snatching away little children and sucking their blood” (25). These additions were composed for an edition of  Ciruelo’s Treatise published in 1628, almost a century after the original! 108 Translation in Darst, “Witchcraft in Spain,” 307. 109 Bartolomé de las Casas, Apologética historie sumaria, ed.

The rationale for the witches’ blood consumption was that the devil invited them to “suck and swallow that [blood] which is good for you.”114 Cannibalistic witchcraft is likewise rarely charged in sixteenth- and seventeenth-century Spain. In addition to the cannibalism accusations made at the trial for the auto at Zugarramurdi, I found only two other such trials. In 1534 at Navarro, Dominga Ferrer gave a forced confession to having grilled an infant’s entrails,115 and a trial at Fago from 1657–58 concerned a group of  witches accused of  devouring a girl who had been playing with a ball.116 Aside from the trial against Dominga Ferrer, which presents nothing on blood consumption, these trials on infant blood or flesh consumption postdate Molina’s and Sahagún’s writings on the teyollohcuani and Olmos’s and Sahagún’s works on the bloodsucking nagual. Finally, none of  the Spanish trials raise the charge of  animal transformation in order to consume human blood or flesh. Meta- morphosis into animals was certainly well-known across Europe as an act of  witchcraft, but in Western European cases it was principally related to travel to distant witch Sabbaths.117 the actual influences from spanish witchcraft What I have hopefully demonstrated so far is that the teyollohcuani, a supernatural being whose alter ego assumes animal forms to consume 111 Proceedings against Susana Dalmau, Peñarroya de Tastavins (Zaragoza), 1591, Ar- chivo Diocesano de Zaragoza, Cajón 74–30, fol. 56; cited in Tausiet Carlés, “Brujería y metáfora,” 82. 112 Proceedings against Isabel Garay, Cosuenda (Zaragoza), 1591, Archivo Diocesano de Zaragoza, Cajón 33–23, fols. 6, 78; cited in María Tausiet Carlés, “Brujería y metáfora: El infanticidio y sus traducciones en Aragón (S.

Modern attitudes toward the teyollohcuani and other witches in Mexico reflect a legacy of  Spanish discourses on and augmen- tations of  the indigenous supernatural world. The treatises by Olmos and Ruiz de Alarcón epitomized Spanish Christian evaluations of  indigenous religion in New Spain, namely, that it was a diabolical mockery of  the church and its sacraments and its specialists had acquired supernatural abilities such as shape-shifting because the devil bestowed it upon his witch servants. As many indigenous peoples were converting to Chris- tianity, the more dangerous supernatural fiends of  their social periphery remained intact, albeit redefined as diabolical agents.118 The powers of such beings, thus placed in opposition to the Christian God, would ulti- mately fail before God’s divine puissance. Christianity could promise its converts an absolute solution to their constant menace from the spirit world, as more recently illustrated through the modern Pentecostal evan- gelization of  Ghana.119 Other indigenes were internalizing the dominant Spanish discourses on witchcraft and the diabolical to gain (unsanctioned) power in the new colonial order.120 The indigenous cosmos was remade into a world of devils and witchcraft to which natives had privileged access, so that it was the indigene who could travel to the witches’ Sabbaths whose con- cept the Spanish had introduced—and even bring Spaniards to them.121 Modern indigenous texts on bloodsucking witches maintain the colonial discourses that had demonized them, so that a pictorial book written by an Otomí healer on a “nagual witch” can speak of  it as none other than a devil’s agent, introduced on the first page in the form of  a bird desiring a “Christian’s” blood.122 It would seem that, just as the teyollohcuani could ensure its survival through its uncanny mutability, so were folk beliefs on the figure maintained by transforming through their continual communi- cation with external discourses on witchcraft and vampirism—beginning 118 Louise M.

To continue with the evolution of  the teyollohcuani, I will address possible African influences upon the concept and complete its historical progression by considering the most recent impacts of global media. african influences on the teyollohcuani african-indigenous religious communication The Spanish introduction of  African slaves brought new currents of  accul- turation into New Spain, especially among the subaltern and indigenous societies of  the Gulf  and Pacific coasts. The period of  their strongest cul- tural influence coincided with the peak of  the slaves’ mass migration into New Spain from 1614 to 1630,123 and arguably in no aspect of  social life was African influence more visible than in religious performance—and its applications toward folk medicine.124 Cases of  the synthesis between African and indigenous religious systems well illustrate the extent of  their communication. Perhaps because of  both the Africans’ rapport with their fellow marginalized indigenes and their traditional affinities with animal alter egos, for example, they and their mixed-blood descendants were the only nonindigenous people in New Spain deemed able to assume the nagual, either as a spiritual counterpart or as an animal form into which to convert. Thus Ana the Pythoness, operating near Cuernavaca, Morelos, Mexico, could combine African “ventriloquism” with nagualism by creat- ing hissing sounds in her stomach and experiencing visions of  her many naguales, enabling her to divine the whereabouts of  her clients’ missing objects.125 The visionary quality of  Ana’s ritual experiences alludes to both the cen- trality of  revelation in African religion and its relevance among African communities in the Americas. African priesthoods stressed the dynamic continuity and immediacy of  revelation, often induced through altered states of  consciousness, to the present. Just as the colonial evangelization of  Africa depended on the coincidence of  Christian and local revelations and their interplay, African religious specialists in the New World relied upon revelations from the ecologies and divinities of  these new lands.

Accord- ing to an Inquisition document dated tentatively to 1629, Olola inspired an indigenous cult centered on his divinatory and sorcery-preventative abilities, which he exercised under possession trance by Mesoamerican deities.128 That he operated among the Huaxtec people of  Pánuco, Vera- cruz, is significant, in that the port city of  Veracruz was the gateway for slave import from the Gulf. Moreover, the Pánuco valley represents the northern end of  the Huasteca in Veracruz, where African features apparently modified local Nahua beliefs in the teyollohcuani. african influences upon the teyollohcuani in chicontepec, veracruz Unlike the general belief  that the teyollohcuani physically converts from human into animal forms, the Nahua of  Chicontepec, Veracruz, ascribe an alternative behavior to it: the witch possesses an internal psychic entity that may be voluntarily projected from his or her chest, and it is this entity that transforms to suck blood. The witch’s tonal, “spirit,” or yollo, “heart,” is the agent of  consumption,129 motivated by the witch’s own malice. The conscious projection of  this spiritual being from its owner’s physical body is unique within all of  the documentation on the teyollohcuani and further still of  the nagual in Mesoamerica.130 It is more widely documented 126 John Thornton, Africa and Africans in the Making of the Atlantic World, 1400–1800, 2nd ed.

This lord’s nagual appears as a spec- tral profile hovering above and before his head. The nagual ends in two tapering strands, one touching the ruler’s diadem. It may not be a projection, however, for the third and fourth lords in the column also feature emblematic caricatures before them. </page> <page sequence="26"> 132 Mexican Vampires in Africa, as for instance among the Azande, whose witch could send the spiritual component of  his internal “witchcraft” organ to consume the spiritual component of  his victim’s flesh.131 In West Africa witch souls are believed to leave the body during sleep to travel to meetings, and these souls may fly either by riding on birds or fireflies or by transforming into animals themselves.132 The internalization (and subsequent projec- tion) of  the African witch soul contrasts with the typical Mesoamerican concept of  the tonal as a companion animal (though occasionally other natural phenomena such as lightning) existing beyond the subject’s human body and yet in a sympathetic relationship with it.133 I therefore conclude that the voluntary emanation of  the teyollohcuani witch’s internal tonal/ yollo among the Chicontepec Nahua is an element derived from African concepts of  the witch soul. Given the mutual communication that charac- terized African indigenous relations in colonial Veracruz, an African in- fluence on the teyollohcuani as a zoomorphic psychic projection among the Chicontepec Nahua may be confidently assumed.134 That cannibalism and parasitism upon other humans’ flesh and/or energy were also ascribed to witchcraft (and by occasional extension kings) in seventeenth-century West Central Africa,135 a dominant region for transatlantic slave export, overlapped with Mexican concepts of  the teyollohcuani and facilitated the aforementioned African influences upon the latter in the Huasteca Veracruzana. 131 E.

West African witches may also suck infants’ blood or devour their victims’ souls, but this is not necessarily by means of  an animal alter ego. 133 For example, Villa Rojas, “Kinship and Nagualism”; Gary H. Gossen, “Animal Souls and Human Destiny in Chamula,” Man 10 (1975): 448–61; Galinier, N’yu $hu $: Les Indiens Otomis; Ruiz de Alarcón, Treatise on the Heathen Superstitions; and Timothy J. Knab, A War of Witches: A Journey into the Underworld of the Contemporary Aztecs (New York: HarperCollins, 1995). 134 As slaves were being imported from several African regions, their religious institutions were combined from various traditions, often without the benefit of  ritual knowledge from priests or other religious specialists (Herbert S. Klein, African Slavery in Latin America and the Caribbean [New York: Oxford University Press, 1986], 178–79). I therefore do not attempt to localize any particular African source for the psychic teyollohcuani in Chicontepec. My consideration below on West-Central African concepts of  witchcraft is intended as an exem- plary influence upon Chicontepec teyollohcuani beliefs, but not the sole one. 135 John Thornton, “Religious and Ceremonial Life in the Kongo and Mbundo Areas, 1500–1700,” in Central Africans and Cultural Transformations in the American Diaspora, ed. L. M. Heywood (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2002), 82–83. A similar discussion, with a particular focus on the symbolic role of  salt in West and Central African cannibalistic witchcraft, appears in Monica Schuler, “Liberated Central Africans in Nine- teenth-Century Guyana,” in Central Africans and Cultural Transformations in the American Diaspora, 348ff. One Line Short </page> <page sequence="27"> History of Religions 133 contemporary media and the supernatural folk categories in mexican media National media in Mexico represent a bewildering cacophony of  social voices, from public service announcements spoken in indigenous lan- guages to the ubiquitous telenovela soap operas that have become an inter- national phenomenon. Within the interplay between local and national levels of  media, indigenous folklore has taken new shape, one whose images of  indigenous folk characters and phenomena have been recon- textualized in national media. The bloodsucking witch is thereby described in the pulp horror magazine Zona Siniestra as an invisible, inimical villain, related through a victim’s first-person narrative. As the author lay in bed, she felt a heavy body press- ing down on her legs and piercing one of  them with a sharp bite, a beak barely visible in its center. When she called her father for help, he lit a kerosene lamp, upon whose ignition the witch flew out through an aperture in the bedroom ceiling, trailed by a shrill laugh and the sound of  beating wings.136 The description is conspicuously similar to the teyollohcuani as I have defined it for this essay, but the entity is called bruja or “witch” on the presupposition that Mexican readers should readily link blood consumption and avian metamorphosis with witchcraft—even if  named with the generic Spanish word rather than with any specific indigenous term. In addition, any reference to a specific location, ethnic group, or indigenous terminology is obviated so that the witch account may be situated anywhere in Mexico where the account could find an audience. National media have recontextualized ethnically specific folk characters alike, such as the Cihuateteo of  Mexica Nahua cosmology. Also known as the Cihuapipiltin “noblewomen,” these Pre-Columbian goddesses were deified women who had died upon first childbirth and harbored wrath against living children, whom they could afflict with palsy or other ill- nesses.137 In the trading card game Guerrero Jaguar, the Civatateo [sic] are similarly described as the specters of  women who died giving birth,138 and, just like the Cihuapipiltin described in Sahagún’s General History, they were perilous to living humans. The outstanding difference between Sahagún’s ethnographic description and the card game’s caption is that 136 Reyna Vega Almodóvar, “El ente mañoso,” Zona Siniestra 60 (2004): 28–29. The same issue features a brief  tale of  a nagual encounter in Cosamaloapan, Veracruz (Nasalit Tamariz Pérez, “El nahual,” Zona Siniestra 60 [2004]: 25), another instance of  an indigenous super- natural incorporated into national media—particularly in the horror genre. 137 Bernardino de Sahagún, Historia General de las Cosas de Nueva España, trans. and ed.

The card game embellishes these goddesses with these innovated behaviors, perhaps to sensationalize them by redrawing them closer to undead European vam- pires. Popular images of  the vampire, informed by global media, have been invoked to overlap with indigenous Mexican folk creatures, not only through nation-level publications such as Guerrero Jaguar but also in local indigenous discourse, which in its own manner has also drawn from the vampire of  modern media. mexican media in folk categories Indigenous folklore has received and adapted national media representa- tions in turn, especially among children whose discourses on the fauna of  the supernatural world are significantly influenced by television pro- grams.139 Especially for the subject of  bloodsucking witchcraft, inter- national vampire media also play a role in the communication of  folk concepts. National television stations broadcast imported series, such as the TV Azteca network’s broadcast of  Spanish-dubbed episodes of  the American series Buffy the Vampire Slayer and its spin-off  Angel; both series included vampire characters in their respective lead personae. Be- cause both the teyollohcuani and the media-based vampire are supernatural beings that transform into animals and survive on human blood, the two terms were interchangeable among the Chicontepec Nahua.140 Thus, an elder man commonly known in his rural village as El Histórico, the “his- toric man,” could be jokingly described as a “vampire” who depended on human blood to sustain his long life. The reference still hearkened to the common assumption that the teyollohcuani was a living elderly man or woman, not like the vampire who in modern media is depicted exclu- sively as a bloodsucking revenant. Interestingly, media references to the vampire have provided at least a preventative measure against blood- sucking fiends: to ornament one’s house with garlic to prevent its intrusion. This was the only instance of  a prescribed measure against the vampire/ teyollohcuani that I encountered in my fieldwork in the Huasteca Vera- 139 Martín del Campo, The Nagual Hiding in Shadows, 104–5, 109–14. 140 Although Slavic folklore tells of  deceased werewolves that could become vampires, bat transformation only became ascribed to European vampires after Spanish explorers brought news of  a bloodsucking bat discovered in the New World.

One of  them reasoned that the bat form would “make sense” (field notes taken in Chicontepec on May 12 and 18, 2005).

From Pre-Columbian codices to colonial documentation to modern ethnology, a survey of  its geographic and ethnic distribution elucidates that its most precise version has been most extensively docu- mented in the folklore of  the Nahua and Otomí in Central and Eastern Mexico. The locations in which it has been described outline an arc from east Oaxaca to the highlands of  west Puebla and a band running from the tierra caliente lowlands of  southern Morelos and northern Guerrero to the southern Huasteca and northern Sierra Poblana. It is significant that several of  the communities to feature the teyollohcuani had already been inhabited by the Otomí by the time of  the conquest, such as Pahuatlán, Puebla, and the Mezquital Valley in central Hidalgo.142 Other communities were by then cohabited between the Otomí and Nahua, as in central Tlaxcala and Huejotzingo, Puebla.143 Further contact in the north Sierra and southern Huasteca maintained the diffusion of  the teyollohcuani from Otomí into neighboring communities, thereby accounting for the origin of  the concept among the Eastern Huasteca Nahua and Sierra Totonac in that region. Isthmus Zapotec communities in eastern Oaxaca are likewise the most probable source for the presence of  the teyollohcuani among proximate communities such as the Isthmus Mixe. Based on the distribution of available folklore and linguistic data from Oto-Manguean communities, 141 Field notes taken in Chicontepec on January 27, 2005. The Mexica Nahua could deter intrusion from the tlahuipochtli or nagual by laying an obsidian blade in water near the house, at its courtyard, or behind the doorway so that the witch would encounter its reflection before invading the house (Florentine Codex, bk. 5, appendix, chap. 27). In modern contexts a knife or scissors may be set in such a manner (Tranfo, Vida y magia, 240; Scheffler, Magia y brujería, 85, 88; Parsons, “Folklore from Santa Ana Xalmimilulco,” 335). The Mixe of southeast Oaxaca share a similar custom of  placing a mirror in a washbowl beneath one’s bed to prevent a witch’s attack (Lipp, The Mixe of Oaxaca, 160). I did not document any such beliefs among the modern Nahua of  Chicontepec, but white crosses were commonly painted on interior walls to prevent evil from entering (Martín del Campo, The Nagual Hiding in Shadows, 129 n. 2). 142 Soustelle, La familia otomí-pame, map 5. 143 Ibid., 473. However, both Nahuatl and Otomí were dwindling languages there by 1934 and have since gone extinct. </page> <page sequence="30"> 136 Mexican Vampires I conclude that the teyollohcuani originated within this language group, whence it diffused principally into Nahua folklore. I now turn to explain how teyollohcuani folklore may have emerged. Theoretical explanations from modern ethnographic cases may offer some possibilities, but none are altogether satisfactory for addressing the Pre- Columbian condition. Nutini and Roberts describe the ecchymotic bruises found around the nose and mouth of  infants purportedly killed by blood- sucking witches, and the authors accredit these bruises to asphyxiation, suffocation, or choking, brought on by breast-feeding when the mother is either drunk or otherwise too somnambulant to recognize that she is press- ing her infant too tightly against her.144 A shape-shifting witch would be a convenient scapegoat. This relation between women’s alcohol consump- tion and weird infanticide was recognized in Spain since the sixteenth century, as in the 1572 trial against Pascuala García. To paraphrase: “When there is wine, the witches suffocate infants.”145 How extensive was this type of  infant mortality in Pre-Columbian Mexico, however? How often were mothers under narcotic influence, and why would this phenomenon be found only among OM and later Nahua and nearby com- munities? Nutini and Roberts’s thesis is tenable as per modern patterns of  alcohol consumption, but its applicability in Pre-Columbian contexts, and more restrictedly in OM and Nahua ones, is difficult. To originate the teyollohcuani in Pre-Columbian “shamanism” is like- wise problematic. The most immediate complication is that shamanism has been too vaguely and liberally used in Mesoamerican ethnology to denote a specific, consistent set of  defining criteria, be they concerning dreams, totems, healing, trances, or other modes of  spiritual communica- tion.146 If  we accept that shamanism may include the experience of  animal metamorphosis under an altered state of  consciousness, as Furst proposed of  the “were-jaguar” motif  in Formative Olmec sculpture,147 the principal difference between the nagual or were-jaguar and the teyollohcuani is that the former operates to maintain social cohesion148 whereas the latter disrupts it.149 Like the shaman, however, the teyollohcuani occupies the position of  the anomalous intermediate, mediating between the axes of 144 Nutini and Roberts, Bloodsucking Witchcraft, 234–46. 145 Tausiet Carlés, “Brujería y metáfora,” 76–77.

The teyollohcuani is one of  several types of  avian creatures documented worldwide, most commonly as owls,151 believed to suck children’s blood or other vital organs especially at night.152 The avian feature is not inherent in OM lexical items for witchcraft or suction, however. Avian terms are, on the other hand, roots for the soul-consuming supernaturals described among the SUA languages. I conclude, then, that the teyollohcuani’s earliest manifestation in Mesoamerican languages was defined as a witch who consumed humans’ vital energy from their blood. This concept was later fused with the soul-consuming avian, a supernatural being from SUA peoples such as the immigrant Nahua. Drawing from Mesoamerican nagualism, the witch then gained the ability to transform into the para- sitic avian. Among the OM cases, this fusion of  Mesoamerican shape- shifting naguals, OM bloodsucking witches, and SUA soul-eating birds became fully realized in the folklore of  Oto-Pamean and Mitla Zapotec communities. Because the avian alter ego and bloodsucking qualities of  the teyollo- hcuani resemble those of  the Latin strix, writers as early as Bartolomé de las Casas have compared the occurrence of  the former in Mexico to the latter in European antiquity. Although the strix influenced the develop- ment of  vampire folklore in Northern and Eastern Europe, similar beliefs would not be documented in Spain until the sixteenth century. The earliest Spanish descriptions of  bloodsucking witchcraft occur in American con- texts, and the first Spanish trial records on the subject date to 1591, thirty years after the earliest independent mention of  the teyollohcuani in New Spain. Furthermore, no Spanish trial record refers to a witch who assumed an animal form specifically to suck blood. Several ethnographers have assigned a European source to Mexican bloodsucking witchcraft,153 but the absence of  vampirism and the paucity of  bloodsucking witchcraft in early modern Spanish documentation suggest otherwise. Finally, Madsen concisely distinguishes the European witch’s motives from the Mexican’s: even though both possess the abilities of  flight and transformation, 150 Nutini and Roberts, Bloodsucking Witchcraft, 53, 72–73; Martín del Campo, The Nagual Hiding in Shadows,” 149–51. 151 Scobie, “Strigiform Witches.” 152 Nutini and Roberts draw a ratio of  1 : 12 for witchcraft attacks reported to have occurred, respectively, in day or night.

In early modern Europe animal shape-shifting and infan- ticide were widely associated with witchcraft, a system of  supernatural abilities acquired through the diabolical pact, which informed the early evangelists’ interpretation of  the supernatural abilities ascribed to the indigenous religious specialists in New Spain. The teyollohcuani did not need a relation with the devil to terrify a community, but a diabolical attribute enhanced its malevolence. Demonizing the indigenous super- naturals was the most profound impact of  European evangelization on them, and its consequences prevail to the present, so that shape-shifters and related sorcerers in Chicontepec are readily called diablos, “devils,” or demonios, “demons,” even by monolingual Nahua.155 Might the radical colonial changes themselves have enhanced the reality of  the teyollohcuani for the Nahua? Nahua etiology was often super- natural, the consequence of  divine or weird retribution for the violation of  moral precepts,156 and so were the devastating colonial epidemics upon the Nahua and other indigenous peoples.157 The pujamiento de sangre, one of  the three most extensive colonial epidemics, caused profuse nose bleeding,158 which was also one of  the fatal symptoms of  a teyollohcuani attack. Colonial sources refer to the epidemic in Nahuatl as cocoliztle, identified by both its absence of  cutaneous eruption and its prominence of nasal hemorraging, but its precise identification remains elusive.159 Perhaps bloodsucking witchcraft impressed upon the Nahua the proliferation of this epidemic, much as Pueblo peoples attributed witchcraft to smallpox and other epidemics that decimated the Tesuque Pueblo tribe.160 The Chicontepec Nahua have proven particularly relevant for the present discussion for several principal reasons. Foremost among these reasons is the extent of  my field research in their community, whence I have been able to explore the various contexts, social and discursive, in 154 Madsen, The Virgin’s Children, 207. 155 Martín del Campo, The Nagual Hiding in Shadows, 54–55. 156 Burkhart, The Slippery Earth, 170–83.

Second, their local terms teyolkwahketl and yoltekwahketl represent modern cognates for teyollo- hcuani. Third, the Chicontepec yoltekwahketl is unique within teyollo- hcuani folklore because it may exist within a witch’s body, unlike the tonal, which typically exists apart from the human subject. I have argued in this essay that this distinct nuance for the yoltekwahketl is derived from African concepts of  “witchcraft” as an internal psychic component that a witch can voluntarily expel. Finally, it was in Chicontepec that I most readily observed the effects of  contemporary Mexican and global media on indigenous folklore, which is not to discount the bottom-up communication of  folklore into national media that I have also described. At least in principle, the teyollohcuani is meant to be an insulated phenomenon. It was a dangerous subject for Chicontepec Nahua con- sultants to discuss with me—though children were more disposed to converse openly among each other on vampires and other supernatural creatures—because the teyollohcuani pertains to witchcraft, an inherently malevolent and destructive human activity. Some consultants refused to be interviewed on the matter, and my host in Tepecxitla informed me that yoltekwahketl was a term not only known principally among elders but also meant to be forgotten, so that its evil could no longer harm the com- munity’s people. The teyollohcuani was an internal crisis and not an issue intended for outsiders, certainly not for newcomers such as me who could be suspect of  pursuing the subject to apply such knowledge with malice.161 With all due respect to the Chicontepec Nahua, what I have attempted to demonstrate in this essay is that the teyollohcuani has been anything but insulated. If  it originated within the Oto-Manguean group, it diffused across Oaxaca, the Central Mexican highlands, and the northern Sierra Poblana, particularly among the Nahua who augmented the vocabulary for the concept and among the Pueblan artists who would depict blood- and heart-consuming supernaturals in Central Mexican codices such as the Borgia and the Cospi. Despite colonial campaigns to vilify the indig- enous supernatural world and its denizens, the teyollohcuani persisted as a newly demonized witch. Colonial slave religion could lend it new psychic attributes compatible with African witchcraft beliefs, but its es- sential behaviors remained. Global media in the vampire genre could pro- vide new words to name the teyollohcuani and new measures to deter it, but its tenebrous character has inspired new tales of  horror in turn. For centuries the teyollohcuani has captivated Mexican folk culture, and its appeal as a distinctly Mexican “vampire” now reaches an international audience. Shape-shifting vampires were linked to an ancient Mesoamerican 161 Field notes taken in Chicontepec on January 24 and 30, 2005. </page> <page sequence="34"> 140 Mexican Vampires temple162 in the 1996 film From Dusk till Dawn, and the tlacique, clearly borrowed from the Milpa Alta and Malinche Nahua, are listed as South American vampires in White Wolf’s World of Darkness role-playing game series.163 No longer merely a local patient of  influences from international discourses on witches, devils, and vampires, the teyollohcuani is an agent contributing its own influences upon national and global media. Even if  it is internationally received as a shape-shifting vampire, its distinct character is a reminder that it is a resolutely Mexican one.
