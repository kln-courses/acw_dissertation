<plain_text><page sequence="1">Sanity and the Myth of Honor: The Problem of Achilles PAUL FRIEDRICH INTRODUCTION The partly unorthodox hypothesis to be argued here is that Achilles, while headstrong, verbal, and arrogant, is responding in one of several predictable ways to an excruciating problem. The hypothesis derives from the relativistic position that sanity cannot be defined without reference to culture, the system of values and norms, symbols, and attitudes, in terms of which the individual guides his own behavior and interprets that of others.1 At the heart of the analysis is the concept of integrity or "sense of self" that grows in the individual during his maturation in a group (e.g., Hallowell 1954). To the degree that such integrity is intact the individual enjoys a sense of wholeness, unity, adequacy, well-formedness, and the like. Integrity is symbolized and projected PAUL FRIEDRICH is professor at the University of Chicago, where he teaches anthropology, linguistics, and Homeric greek. 1.

When those rules are breached the integrity of the individual is felt to be injured, shamed, muti- lated, polluted, and so forth.2 One of the sharpest ways to dishonor an Iliadic man is through his women-particularly a wife or concu- bine-and the sane response of a man so treated may range from an apt insult, to homicide, to withdrawal, to a ritual of reconciliation; all of these alternatives are illustrated below. The integrity at issue here is not to be confused with sociologi- cal theories of the self, nor with variants of the id-ego-superego schema. The integrity that I have in mind is an essentially cultural construct, and varies greatly in form and content from one culture to another. In Iliadic culture, for example, the main criteria, for a man, were the body (parts), certain kinds of inalienable property, certain places (e.g., one's household or region), some portion of the religious system (e.g., the relationship of Athena to Achilles, or Ulysses), certain ideas and images of the self, and last, certain cul- turally defined groups and relatives (including one's concubine). To a considerable extent integrity is defined in terms of the cate- gories to which one can apply the adjective philos. At another level, the sense of integrity is always trimodal and includes more or less external objects, categories, and relations between people, and an individual self-image. The hypothesis to be argued raises a whole series of problematic issues. What is the structure of honor, its rituals, and codes? What is the role of idiom in honor? And how do the rituals, idioms, and values of honor interact? How is honor related to other value com- plexes and how is the entire system of complexes related to sexu- ality? How and to what degree is honor a "myth," and how is it related to integrity?4 2. The term "pollution" is used by Douglas with the meaning of trans- gression of the sacred, the dangerously interstitial, and so forth. "Pollution" also strongly connotes the quite distinct patterns of Hinduism and of similar systems. Finally, pollution through association with a dead person is uni- versal, and quite distinct from the sorts of things referred to here. For these and other reasons "pollution" might be a sort of red herring in the present context, and has been eschewed (see Douglas 1970 for a valuable discussion). 3. Rosen (1967:12-41) has argued categorically that philos only applies to inalienable things, whereas Benveniste has argued with equal brilliance that the term also means "dear, beloved" in come contexts (Benveniste 1969:vol. 1, bk. 3, chap. 4). 4. The cultural-relativistic apology for Achilles that is partly argued be- low has been entertained for some time, but sporadically and unsystemati- cally. Gladstone, for example, has a clause "it is not so clear that the conduct</page><page sequence="3">SANITY AND THE MYTH OF HONOR * 283 ALTERNATIVE HYPOTHESES The culturally oriented hypothesis about sanity and sexual honor differs from several other interpretations of a more psychological character. Some psychoanalytically oriented scholars, for example, have analyzed Achilles' motivation in terms of his "homosexual" relation with Patroclus. This does raise fruitful questions about the role and idiom of homosexuality in "shame and honor" sys- tems, but the hypothesis must contend with the absence of behav- ioral evidence for such a relation in this case. And then there are the facts, crucial from a cultural point of view, that Achilles grew up with Patroclus, and addressed him with a quasi-kinship term for respected, older persons (etheios)-indeed, Achilles acts toward Patroclus as though the latter were a sort of structural elder brother.5 A second psychological and also twentieth-century view focuses on Achilles' isolation and alienations, on the chasm of bit- terness that separates him from his comrades. He becomes a meta- phor for the outstanding individual anywhere, and for his antagon- isms toward the arbitrariness and injustices of the society that en- capsulates him (Whitman 1958). But, here again, it is fallacious to compare directly two sets of behavioral alienation while ignoring the cultural systems in terms of which they are meaningful. By a third, Neo-Freudian hypothesis, Achilles is said to exemplify the narcissism that underlies Greek (here Iliadic) behavior-as in his vaunting, and his allegedly morbid preoccupation with his own honor. Narcissism is clearly at work, as are the Oedipus complex, sadism, and the castration complex, but, once again, the structure and content of such universal processes vary enormously from cul- ture to culture and cannot be induced without attention to the verbal code, to sets of patterned acts, and so forth. And interpreta- of Achilles after the mission of the Ninth Book is incapable of justification, according to the moral code of Greece," but then after a sentence goes on to say that "it must, however, undoubtedly remain amenable to severe censure on the score of excess" (Gladstone 1958:369-376, especially 377). 5. By an alternative hypothesis, the behavioral and verbal evidence is absent because of a strict stylistic taboo against such homosexual reference, along with the taboos against reference to flatulation, the female genitals, sexual foreplay, and other matters. The case is given cogency by (1) the verbal evidence that abounds in subsequent Attic literature, and (2) the cognates for the key terms in other ancient dialects such as Latin and San- skrit; (see Wackernagel 1916:224-229). In other words, since the "lexical gaps" in Homeric Greek are filled in later Greek (i.e., a later form of the same language), and in cognate early Indo-European languages, we may as- sume that the terms were present in eighth-century Greek but suppressed in Homer by a taboo on epic diction.</page><page sequence="4">284 ? ETHOS tion in such terms is invalidated to a significant degree by egregious ethnocentrism, as when Achilles is seriously described as a "gorilla" (Slater 1971:339). All three of these and yet other psychological hypotheses merit consideration, but none of them gets very close to honor in Iliadic culture, particularly its sexual aspects. A fourth hypothesis has sought to explain the wrath of Achilles and the later apology of Agamemnon, using a psychoanalytically based theory of "shame" as contrasted with "guilt" in a way that seems essentially sound (Dodds 1967), and on which this article partly builds.6 THE STRUCTURE OF (SEXUAL) HONOR Honor is a code for both interpretation and action; in other words, with both cognitive and pragmatic components. The second of these components includes acts that resolve or terminate con- flict, and these often have a clearly sexual character-as when Agamemnon has the shaven carcass of a young boar hurled into the sea to underscore symbolically his oath of abstinence. The prag- matic component also includes acts that precipitate or catalyze the normative, "honorable" behavior that is enjoined by the code. Such catalysis also often involves sexual matters, as is well illustrated by the defilement of Achilles' concubine. Both the catalytic and completive acts are organized in terms of categories, rules, and processes that are, to a significant degree, specific to a given culture, and this is notably the case with "public versus private," "intended versus unintended," and so forth. Honor also consists of a system of symbols, values, and definitions in terms of which phenomena are conceptualized and interpreted. To be specific in one way, the elements of a code of honor work in terms of two kinds of implication. By the first implication a given proposition presupposes other propositions, as when the "precedence" of birth and geneaIogy is said to imply or necessarily presuppose honor. By the second kind of implication, a given prop- osition may assert or enjoin a norm for behavior. To use a spatial and anthropomorphic metaphor, a given proposition may "look 6. For a different approach see also Gerhart Piers and Milton B. Singer (1953). I can no more than mention here some of the other theories. Students of myth compare him to Shiva, or see him as the archetype of the modern men who have conquered much of the world, often slaughtering and violat- ing. To a profound classcist such as Werner Jaeger, Achilles' deliberate choice of a great deed at the cost of his life proves that his significance was educational. Others see this choice as a metaphysical issue.</page><page sequence="5">SANITY AND THE MYTH OF HONOR * 285 back" at what it presupposes and "look ahead" at what it enjoins.7 In many cases the same value is both presupposed and enjoined; thus, honor presupposes a minimum of magnanimity-one cannot be honorable without it, but also enjoins acts of magnanimity. Other values imply each other, as when honor and kinship loyalty are said to presuppose each other. In yet other cases, the same value may be presupposed at a conceptual level, but enjoined at a be- havioral one. And occasionally the system implies contradictions; Agamemnon, as Homer often reminds us, is superior to Achilles in "precedence," but the latter has greater honor through courage and other kinds of prestige (such tensions obviously providing much of the force that moves the plot!). In a formal sense, to conclude, the code of honor is a network consisting of different kinds of unilateral and bilateral implications. This structure of implications corresponds to and is reflected by an overt "idiom" in the vague sense of numerous key words and expressions and ways of saying things-with which, however, it must not be confused. THE CATALYSIS OF HONOR Three catalyses of honor unleash much of the force that drives the epic. The first is the abduction or seizure of Helen, which pre- cipitated the Trojan War. The second involves the daughter of the priest of Apollo (a god of purity) whom Agamemnon has seized. When Homer says that the priest had been dishonored, he implies, as his audiences would have done, that the girl had been sleeping with "the king of men" who, indeed, prefers her form and way of thinking to those of his wife (i. 113-115).8 When the old priest comes to the Greek camp to beg for his daughter, he is arrogantly denied. His prayers to Apollo are then answered with a pestilence sent among the Greek host. The girl is eventually returned, Apollo desists, and it is then that, "Atreus' son told his people to wash off their defilement/And they washed it away and threw the defilings into the salt sea/then they accomplished perfect hecatombs to Apollo/of bulls and goats along the barren salt sea" (I. 313-316). 7. On presuppositions see the articles by C. Fillmore, G. Lakoff, the Kiparskys, and others in Semantics, D. D. Steinberg and L. A. Jakobovits, eds. (1974). 8. Homeric references are from The Iliad, unless otherwise identified; following traditional practice books of The Iliad are referred to with roman numerals.</page><page sequence="6">286 * ETHOS Agamemnon's status as a sexual polluter worsens his affront to Achilles. The third catalysis of honor is Agamemnon's seizure of Achilles' concubine as a compensation for the loss of his own. Such seizure of an inalienable possession would itself have justified the wrath. But in addition, Achilles' relation to her had become one of close kinship; at one point, Patroclus had said he would make her the wedded wife of Achilles, and "make a marriage feast among the Myrmidons" (xix. 295-299). Achilles and those around him per- ceived her as, at the least, a wife-to-be; as Lacey says in his impor- tant book (1968:42), "From this we must recognize that he could have made her his acknowledged wife by public recognition of the fact and proclaiming it before his own temple." But I would go further than this and claim that they perceived her as a wife; be- cause they used for her the term alokhos. There are also Achilles' specific feelings about his own integrity. "From me alone of the Achaeans he seized and keeps a wife, the darling of my heart; let him lie beside her and take his joy . . . Why has he gathered a host and led it hither, this son of Atreus? Was it not because of fair-haired Helen? Do the sons of Atreus alone of mortal men love their wives? Any man who is good and sound of mind, whosoever, loves and cares for his own, as I loved her from my heart, spear-captive though she was" (ix. 335-343). Given the cultural categories of possession and kinship, it would have been deviant in Achilles not to become wrathful. This is im- plied in his personal style of everexpanding imagery as he enlarges on a comparison, saying that he would not accept gifts of recom- pense even if they were equal to the wealth of Thebes, or even equal in number to the sands. And he spurns wedding the daughter of Agamemnon. To accept such payoffs would imply greater sub- ordination in terms of Iliadic kinship obligations and gift exchange (see e.g., Finley 1954). THE IDIOM OF HONOR AND SHAME As already noted, much of the overt stuff of honor is a matter of idiom, the selection of key words, the use of certain words in certain ways, the niceties of apology and of invective and of suppli- cation. More than economic life, social organization, kinship, or other familiar spheres and domains, honor is a matter of idiom, and an idiom, that in fact, crosscuts the other domains in many ways.</page><page sequence="7">SANITY AND THE MYTH OF HONOR * 287 Thus honor is in some ways a matter of style, and this is connected with its apparent superficiality (even "triviality" for many observ- ers) and its sensitive, albeit imperfect reticulation- with ways of speaking. In The Iliad many of the specific utterances include or are re- lated to uses of the root tim- in any one of its many derived forms, such as the verb timdo, "to honor." In other uses it involves any one of a large set of words directly or indirectly linked to honor and defilement; one of the most significant subsets of these involves dogs, as is illustrated below. To some extent, then, the meaning of sexual honor can be inferred by systematically following key verbal symbols and ways of speaking through representative sets of con- texts. About half the occurrences of tim- and related forms in The Iliad refer to a status that may be granted downwards by a greater authority or show upwards to a lesser one. Near the beginning of the first book, for example (i. 175), Agamemnon says that he is hon- ored by Zeus and the people. Later he rebukes Achilles for trying to rival a sceptered king such as himself (I. 278-279). During the ninth book, Diomedes draws an invidious distinction: honor is given to Agamemnon through his scepter, and not through his valor, "which is the greatest strength" (IX. 38-39). These and other instances show that honor was in part a political matter, but most of these "political matters" were entangled, of course, with sexually motivated honor. That the "king of men" selected Achilles' con- cubine to replace his own, and the latter's wrath, are part of a latent fabric of regicide and symbolic castration that informs much of the epic. In a second class of passages "honor" even less ambiguously in- volves sexuality. During the nocturnal embassy in book nine for example, Achilles remains adamant until the long speech by Phoenix, which begins with a family history. Phoenix's father had dishonored the former's mother by an affair with a concubine. The mother then besought Phoenix to make the old man hate this woman by himself sleeping with her. Phoenix did this, incurred his father's anger, and fled to the kingdom of Achillees' father. By these reminders of his own sexually shameful affair, Phoenix tries to create contact with Achilles. But the latter's answer is that he had been honored by the gods and does not want the material re- compense that Agamemnon is offering (ix. 607-608).</page><page sequence="8">288 ? ETHOS About a third of the Iliadic occurrences refer not only to sexual honor, but specifically to the sexual honor of Achilles. In the first book, for example, when speaking to his mother, he says that Agamemnon has dishonored him, and that Zeus should have given him honor (I. 333, 358-359), which his mother then later repeats to Zeus. In the second book he is described as dishonored (II. 239- 240) in a passage that is specially significant because the speaker, Thersites, is a man who tells the truth (for which he is later mu- tilated by the kings). In the ninth book, Achilles says that the Atreides brothers dishonored him like some "outcast" and uses the same strong word in the sixteenth book (xvi. 59) to describe his lot to Patroclus.9 Later in the same ninth book he complains that Agamemnon degraded him, using a rare adjective (asuphelos) that only occurs once elsewhere, when Helen, lamenting Hector, says that he never used such words to her (xxiv. 767). Further along in book nine Nestor contrasts the way Achilles has his honor from the gods with the way he has been dishonored by a mortal. The honor and dishonoring of Achilles is thus a recurrent theme. The idiom of sexual honor is almost as clear from what is said about Menelaus and Helen. In the first book, when Achilles grows furious at the suggestion that Agamemnon may seize his consort, he exclaims (i. 159-160), "But, great shameless one, we followed so that you might be glad, getting honor for Menelaus and yourself, dog-facel" In the third book, Agamemnon, when swearing the covenant, predicts that if Menelaus slays Paris in the forthcoming duel then such "honor as is appropriate will be paid back to the Greeks" (II. 286), and later promises (288-291) that, "If Priam and the sons of Priam do not want to pay me my honor when Paris falls, then I will fight on thereafter for recompense, remaining here until I find an end to the war." The two brothers, Agamemnon and Menelaus, need to have their loss of honor through sexual de- filement balanced by commensurately defiling their enemies through death, and the promised posthumous pollution of being devoured by carrion-eating dogs and birds. Some of the best evidence on the idiom of sexual dishonor ap- pears in passages involving Helen. She is the only person who refers 9. The Homeric Greek term in question, metandstes, probably refers here to an outcast who has not been assimilated, and so suggests the ambiguity of any stranger-who is a threat until assimilated, but also an opportunity for the demonstration of hospitality by the host who does take him in.</page><page sequence="9">SANITY AND THE MYTH OF HONOR * 289 to herself as a dog. To Priam she calls herself "bitch-eyed" and to Hector she says (6. 344), "[1] am a bitch, a contriver of mischief causing all to shudder." In her conclusion to the lament over Hec- tor, mentioned above (xxiv. 774-775), she wails, "for no longer have I anyone beside me in broad Troy that is gentle or kind, but all men shudder at me." It is Achilles who uses about her the hor- rible adjective, "shudder-giving" (hrigedanos; xIx. 325), which oc- curs nowhere else in the epic. Despite her de facto marriage she is a polluted being among the Trojans, a dangerous, liminal figure. Her self-abominations are linked to a general sense that she was the immediate cause of a national disaster that affected the integrity of each constituent individual. The foregoing passages should have suggested an illuminating key to the Iliadic idiom of honor, that of dogs. Dogs emerge in the fourth line of the epic and reappear at least once in all but five of the remaining twenty-three books, thirty-five times in connection with the eating of corpses, mainly in metaphors, invectives, and similes. Dogs come in pairs, and packs, devouring the myriad corpses on the battelfield, or even rushing in to gnaw the testicles of their dead master. To be somewhat more specific, the Trojans are a pack of dogs, the Myrmidons a pack of wolves, their jaws dripping with gore, a ferocious warrior is an eater of raw meat, and scorned women are "dog flies," or "bitches," or "bitch-eyed." Numerous threats and entreaties involve being thrown to the dogs, the worst form of defilement. In this sense of vicarious cannibalism, the Greeks came to Troy to eat the Trojans or be eaten by them. These various roles of dogs in the idiom of honor are based: on diverse metaphorical and metonymical relations. Dogs, like men, are carni: vores by preference, and dogs form part of human society. And just as the named horses are analogues of heroic men, so do the packs of dogs resemble masses of nameless troops. The highly figurative quality of idiom is illustrated by the fact that throwing enemies to the dogs and being so thrown are exclusively terrors of the mind, and are never actually depicted in epic narrative (see Pagliaro 1956, and Redfield 1975). Canine imagery in the idiom is particularly associated with the leading figures of Priam, Patroclus, and Hector, and above all with Achilles. Achilles is the most given to epithets such as "dog-face" and "dog-eyed," to the extent of doubly offending an enemy by both calling him a dog and threatening to throw him to the dogs. Achilles</page><page sequence="10">290 * ETHOS and Helen, moreover, are the only two characters who also liken themselves to dogs. Finally, to complete the circle, Achilles, after calling Hector a dog and threatening to throw him to the dogs, then himself takes over the canine role by saying he would like to devour his enemy raw, and by posthumously defiling through rend- ing and dragging (xxII. 335-336, 395, 401).10 Thus the canine imag- ery that permeates The Iliad is condensed in Achilles, as is congru- ent with the position being taken here that he has been maximally dishonored in a basically sexual way. The canine component in the Iliadic idiom illustrates important general points. For one thing, such idioms are often not universal, but specific in part to a given language-and-culture system. Among the Germanic tribes, for example, the symbolism of the dog and wolf is fundamentally albeit not diametrically different. Second, the idiom of honor often grows prodigiously, with certain clusters of symbols burgeoning at the expense of others. Last, canine imag- ery shows that the idiom of honor, despite its "superficiality" at one level, also symbolizes rather directly such universal concerns as liquidation of integrity. THE CODE Honor cultures, as noted above, are organized as systems of prop- ositions with two main kinds of implication: presupposition and enjoining. The structure of Iliadic honor can be stated in part as a larger network that includes propositions about honor and nine honor-linked values: power, wealth, magnanimity, personal loyalty, "precedence," sense of shame, fame or "reputation," courage, and excellence. Aside from the presupposition-enjoining relation, these complex values are loosely coordinate in that no one completely in- cludes or subsumes the other. But they are not strictly coordinate, first, because some are more comprehensive than others, and sec- ond, because they differ in their relation to honor itself. For the present let it suffice to sketch the network of semantic relations, particularly as it bears on or informs the problem of Achilles. The following discussion draws heavily on Jaeger (1945: chap. 1). Iliadic power is, perhaps above all, the ability to command men lo. Achilles is also likened to a dog by Hector's mother, who later recipro- cates by wishing she could eat his liver raw. The dog imagery is also im- portant in the Near Eastern Inanna-Ishtar figures (who contributed to the Aphrodite figure of which Helen is a faded variant).</page><page sequence="11">SANITY AND THE MYTH OF HONOR * 291 and to be in the social-structural position to do so. Achilles, as sole leader of the Myrmidons, has enough great power to make him dream of rivaling or even replacing "the king of men"-from one point of view, The Iliad is a sustained fantasy of regicide (and hence, implicitly, of parricide). But note that, in these terms, the main implication of power is the ability to take from others, par- ticularly property and women. That is what the texts constantly refer to, and, in this case especially, we must "listen to the natives." A similar and closely related value is that pf wealth. Wealth is defined in terms of household dwellings, livestock, land, works of metallurgy, and yet other items, to many of which may be applied the adjective for "inalienable possession" (philos). Wealth, in other words, consists of the material goods on which a man's mode of life depends and which place him somewhere along a scale that runs from the gods to destitute beggars. Important as the variable of wealth is in the network of honor, it is just as important that it not be given undue priority at the cost of more basic psychosexual lev- els. Achilles' great personal wealth, whether his inheritance or what he has acquired through war, brigandage, and theft, clearly is meant to enhance his honor. At several points his specifically sex- ual honor is balanced against wealth by him and found to be of less consequence.ll Both wealth and power presuppose honor, by the syllogism that since honor is shown to the powerful and wealthy, they must in some degree be honorable. And honor enjoins that one acquire power and wealth, the latter, in particular, to act generously and hospitably. Yet honor does not presuppose wealth or power, since one can be honorable without them. In this sense, also, honor cannot be said to consist in material goods. A third major value complex is magnanimity, particularly in the sense of generosity, hospitality, and mercy to suppliants: Achilles is notoriously magnanimous in all three senses. But while magnan- imity might strike many as altruistic it is, at least in The Iliad, pri- marily motivated by the hope of enlarging one's social status, and of a return with profit. Prisoners are spared because of ransom, as Lycaon tries to persuade Achilles. 11. See A. W. H. Adkins' sophisticated and level-headed discussion of this variable (1960 and 1972). Adkins operates in terms of (partly unstated) propositions such as: honor (time) consists in material goods that are gained and defended by courage, etc. While his logic resembles mine, I think he overlooks some presuppositions in the network as a whole.</page><page sequence="12">292 * ETHOS A fourth value is loyalty to one's friends and relatives, which presupposes and is presupposed by honor; and honor also strongly enjoins such loyalty. Kinship loyalty and magnanimity combine when one shows respect and consideration for the loyalties of others, as Achilles does to Priam in the last book. And Achilles is extremely sensitive about his own loyalty to his aged father, to his mentor Phoenix, and to Patroclus. Most such loyalty is related to the seizure or retention of things in terms of which others define their own integrity. So Achilles is joined with Patroclus to seize booty, par- ticularly women, and with his father to hold off avaricious neigh- bors. The most effective way to touch Achilles' filial loyalty is to remind him of how his father may be exposed to dangers. A fifth honor-linked value is "precedence," a complex of birth, parentage, and genealogy. Many Iliadic conversations consist in part of genealogies onto which the exploits of fathers and father's fathers are hung like decorations (while some genealogies run as far back as five or even seven generations, the usual upper limit is the grandfather-specifically the father's father). A hero is referred to as often by his patronymic as by his own name: Achilles is "the son of Peleus." And Achilles and those he deals with keenly appreciate what old Peleus would say about his doings. Descent in an aristo- cratic line sets off a man such as Achilles in a way that a commoner cannot challenge on the same terms. Divinely descended individuals are similarly distinguished from the ordinary run of aristocrat; as noted, Achilles often affirms that his honor is from Zeus. Precedence it part of getting honor through one's relatives, particularly one's children, if they continue one's line in an honorable way. But in the main the individual looks upward for honor. Precedence presupposes honor; high descent makes one honor- able by definition. But honor does not presuppose precedence, since someone can be honorable without it. Honor, however, en- joins precedence in the limited sense that one will seek desirable marriages for oneself and one's kin. This gives special force to Achilles' contemptuous rejection of the proposal that he take one of Agamemnon's daughters to wife; he exclaims that he would pre- fer his concubine, or such a girl as his father may select for him. In these terms precedence emerges as the primary way of legitimizing claims of power, wealth, and other values, and a means of aggran- dizement, particularly through the control of women.</page><page sequence="13">SANITY AND THE MYTH OF HONOR * 293 Honor is closely connected with the value referred to by the un- translatable term aidos, which, depending on context, can stand for respect or even reverence, and for "sensitiveness to the opinion of others, fear of what they may think or say" (Cunliffe 1963:10). Aid6s is felt before gods, elders, and similar persons, and could at times be glossed as "a sense of shame." In a vague but important sense it signifies the inner feelings of a person in the presence of someone, an audience that matters. A person utterly lacking aid6s cannot be honorable; yet possession of it enhances but does not guarantee one's honor. Achilles displays aid6s in some contexts, as when giving proper burial to Andromache's father, but at othet times is shameless. Honor is closely connected with the kudos that one wins in battles and similar contests. Kudos and honor do not presuppose each other; although one way of attaining honor is through kudos, and for this reason honor enjoins kuidos. Although usually trans- lated as "fame" or "glory," it has been argued with considerable cogency that the underlying meaning was some sort of Homeric mana (Benveniste 1969:vol. 2, bk. 1, chap. 6). Kuidos obviously re- sults from seizure, particularly the life or the women of another man and is, in this sense, part of the Iliadic glorification of ag- grandizement and aggression. Achilles is heavy with kudos from battle and other arenas, and toward the end of the epic does indeed seem invested with a literally supernatural power. The eighth major value is courage, and that is a fairly inclusive sense. While courage does not presuppose honor, the latter both presupposes and enjoins courage; courage is essential because one cannot be honorable without it. Achilles is of course essentially fearless, both at the level of facing enemies, including divine ones, and also at the more comprehensive one of accepting his youthful doom and its full implications. The courage in question consists, then, of the moral fiber necessary to face other men in the struggle over property, life, reputation, and other desirables, particularly women. Honor is inextricably reticulated with excellence, arete, perhaps most essentially in the twin activities of verbal power (as in debate) and, in contrast, war and similar forms of contest. This dyadic competence is a frequent point of reference, with some men possess- ing one and some the other, but very few possessing both to a high</page><page sequence="14">294 " ETHOS degree. Of those who are doubly excellent, two stand out: Ulysses and Achilles. The latter speaks eloquently and is a singer of verse; while not a bard, he has a poetic streak. But Achilles is also the fleetest runner, and his epithet of "swift-footed," like Ulysses' of "man of many wiles," is one of the few that is not only metrically convenient, but which refers to a unique and diagnostic trait. And he is physically strong, a value that is explicitly differentiated from "honor" in several passages where they are on "the same level of constrast." And he is the greatest hand-to-hand fighter in a culture where "the highest standard of manly character is the traditional ideal of warlike behavior" (Jaeger 1945) and where excellence or aret6 includes "the fighting ability necessary to protect a hero's family and possessions from would-be marauders, and perhaps also the ability to augment his possessions by plunder" (Lacey 1968:42). Achilles is physically and emotionally the most violent man in a society where one's vindication of honor often depends on violence and where debts of honor are often settled by self-help. He is the most forceful man in what has been called "the poem of force" (Weil 1965). Honor is also clearly connected with piety, with reverence for the gods. This may be expressed through prayer or appropriate actin, but, perhaps most decisively, through frequent and generous cult activities-sacrifice of animals, expensive ceremonies, the con- struction of altars and the like. During the bulk of The Iliad this basis of Achilles' honor is often in the background-although it provides the context for the insult by Agamemnon. Achilles' sen- sitivity to the honor of religious ritual emerges with force after the death of Patroclus and the funeral games. THE SEXUAL BASIS OF HONOR My cursory review of some honor-linked value complexes has revealed an elaborate structure of interlocked and crosscutting im- plications, both presuppositional, and of enjoinings. All of the nine values and, of course honor itself function somehow to legiti- mize, rationalize, or at least to conceptualize the seizure and posses- sion of material and social values, particularly rights over women and values involving women. All ten of the complex values under scrutiny thus contribute in some ideologically functional way to what I call the myth of honor.</page><page sequence="15">SANITY AND THE MYTH OF HONOR ? 295 Women do have honor by precedence, and they may win honor by good works, such as fine weaving, and by other analogues to the system described above, but the main concern of women is not with increasing or exulting in her honor but with keeping from losing it, with not dishonoring the men on whom she depends: Andro- mache puts this dependence very clearly in book six when she ex- plicitly defines herself in terms of blood relatives and tells Hector that he now synthesizes all the statuses in question. Honor in Iliadic culture and many similar cultures thus depends on depriv- ing women of honor, and the continuous semimonopolization of honor by men. The entire system is periodically revitalized, or re- minded of itself, so to speak, by dramatic struggles over women, such as that between Agamemnon and Achilles. In terms of my original question, the violence and extremity of Achilles' response is "sane" precisely because what he is responding to touches the taproot of his integrity, and the code by which he has learned to live and die, and by which he does in fact live and die. The most honorable, and with excellent defenses against dishonor, he is by the same logic uniquely open to being dishonored through a woman, and will have a predictable extreme response. Insulted in a blatantly sexual way in terms of a system based on sexuality, he responds with complete sanity-with invective, a homicidal im- pulse (checked by Athena), and then by withdrawal. THE SYMBOLISM OF THE VEIL For those positivists who might say that the above was "reading something into Homer," I would invite a brief return to an essen- tial element in such honor systems, namely idiom, and to the deeper levels of emotion that it sometimes symbolizes. For exam- ple, aspects of sexual honor and shame are consistently symbolized by Homer by the word kredemnon, which has the partly etymologi- cal sense of "head-binding," and the simple reference of "veil," as in the fixed formula, "holding the veil before her." In Iliadic and other Homeric passages the veil symbolizes the masking of sexual charm for the purpose of modesty. In other contexts kr6demnon symbolizes not only chastity, but all that is dear to a woman that, qua woman, she has lost or will lose irrevocably. In one such case the symbol serves "as a climax to one of the most poignant scenes in The Iliad: this is the frenzy of Andromache upon witnessing the</page><page sequence="16">296 * ETHOS dragging of Hector's body" by the vengeful Achilles (Nagler 1967: 300): "Far from her head she threw the shining bindings/the front- let and coif and woven band/and the veil that golden Aphrodite had given her/on the day when Hector of the shining helmet led her forth/from the house of Eetionos [her father], after he had brought bride gifts without counting" (xxII. 467-472). In this deeply moving passage the poet displays his full awareness of the in- herent meanings by literally spelling out for us the roots of the word in question: "head" (kdre) plus "bind" (demnein). As Nagler continues in his brilliant analysis (1967:301), "With this gesture Andromache . . . painfully predicts and enacts her cer- tain downfall in every sense, including the feeling of sexual viola- tion so cruelly developed in the plays of Euripedes." The semanti- cally related term for "headgear" (kaluptre) seems to be a metrical variant; just sixty lines before this scene of Andromache's grief, the mother of Hector "throws her shining headgear far away, and shrieked very loud on seeing her son" (xxii. 406-407). The killing of a woman's man implied her own dishonor, just as a man's honor was lost through his women. This transformational relation sug- gests that the "sexual honor" of man-killing Achilles ramifies far more widely than a superficial inspection would suggest. Yet another important reference of krEdemna is "battlements" and it is so applied to those of Troy (e.g., xvI. 100). As Nagler con- cludes, "the idea of rape for women followed naturally enough upon that of (the seizure of) a city; after all, it is partially the arti- fact of translation which separates kredemna 'battlement' from kredemna 'veil', and aidos 'pride of chastity' from aidos meaning roughly 'pride of status.'" The former aid6s is upheld by women wearing veils and bringing their attendants when they go into mixed company; the latter aid6s is upheld by men in battle. I would go further and say that at one level a woman and a city are allomorphs that symbolize the same underlying concept. Paris' defilement of Helen was balanced by tearing down the battlements of Troy. The Achilles who wins great honor by sacking cities is a transformation of the Achilles who is dishonored by the seizure of his concubine. Iliadic honor and honor-linked values such as power and precedence are part of a myth of honor that is rooted in a cul- turally specific sense of integrity that is, in turn, found on the ag- grandizement of honor by males at the expense of women or in terms of women.</page><page sequence="17">SANITY AND THE MYTH OF HONOR * 297 RITUALS OF RESOLUTION As was sketched-above, the pragmatic aspect of honor involves rituals of resolution, be they violent acts, or complicated and de- corous ceremonials involving the exchange of gifts and meals, solemn oaths, and sacrifices to the supernatural and, perhaps most crucially, a public apology. In some ways the public apology in a shame culture is an analogue to the public confessions in a guilt culture (e.g., some of nineteenth-century Russian Orthodox be- havior). Since Achilles has been sexually dishonored in a most pain- ful way, through seizure of his woman, the rituals of reconciliation require a correspondingly great amount of time and decorum to assuage his integrity, and much attention is paid to apology. Patroclus has been slain, and it is up to Achilles to rejoin the siege. In response to a request from his mother, he summons a great assembly and, standing up, begins to renounce his wrath. "Son of Atreus, was this then better for us two, for you and me, that we with grief at heart should rage for the sake of a girl?" (xix. 56-58). A woman, therefore, is said to be the fault, just as Helen was the cause of disaster. Achilles describes the loss of Greek lives and his desire to end his wrath and go forth against the enemy. To which Agamemnon, remaining seated, answers: "I am not at fault, but Zeus and Fate and the Furies that walk in darkness, who in the assembly cast wild blindness (cte) into my soul on the day when I myself took away the prize of Achilles" (xix. 86-88). He then tells a myth that shows that Zeus himself can be blinded just as he was. His speech is intended to persuade Achilles that he, Agamemnon, had not been in control of himself at the time of the insult. Gifts of reconciliation should be brought from the ship. Achilles answers briefly, repeating his desire to renew the fray as soon as possible. He is indifferent to the gifts, and will not eat or drink until he has had his revenge. These statements have been interpreted by most scholars to mean that Achilles is so eager to avenge Patroclus that he no longer cares about material recompense for his public humiliation. Consonant with the position of this article, Achilles' apparent in- difference to material recompense implies that his shame can only be undone by ritually annulling his sexual defilement (he had al- ready rejected a material settlement in book nine!). Until Agamem- non clears the girl's public purity, as it were, such material gifts are not only inadequate but actually an additional affront that Achilles</page><page sequence="18">298 ? ETHOS cannot even discuss." Homer's intuition that a public apology was in order must have been shared by his audiences. This is supported by the speech by Ulysses. "Let the king of men, Agamemnon, bring the gifts into the midst of the assembly so that all the Achaeans may behold them with their eyes" (xix. 172-174). Then comes the indispensable stipulation that Agamemnon must "swear an oath, standing up in the midst of the Achaeans, that he has never gone to bed with her, nor made love with her as is the way, O king, of men and women" (175-177). Ulysses' mention of this "natural" way refers, ironically, to what the Greek host (and Homer's audi- ences) assume: that Agamemnon has been publicly and intention- ally defiling Achilles. As a special nicety, Ulysses stipulates that Agamemnon must stand up when swearing, so symbolizing his equality with the other leaders. The final condition laid down by Ulysses is that the king of men must richly feast Achilles, after which the latter will surely be "more just, for in no way is it shame- ful for a king to appease a man, when the king was the first to be angry" (182-183). Agamemnon replies that he is ready for the oath and will not forswear the gods. The magnificent recompense is brought in and displayed for all to inspect: seven tripods, twenty cauldrons, twelve horses, ten talents of golds, and eight women, including Briseis. Then Agamemnon cuts the firstling hairs from the sacrificial boar and, looking up to heaven, swears his great and solemn oath (258- 265): "Let Zeus be my witness, highest of the gods and greatest/ and Earth, and the Sun, and the Furies, who underground/avenge dead men, when any man has sworn to a falsehood/that I never laid hand on the girl Briseis/on pretext to go to bed with her, or for any other/reason, but she remained, not singled out, undefiled, in my shelter./If any of this be falsely sworn, may the gods give me many/ griefs, all that they inflict on those who falsely swear before them." The boar's throat is cut and the body whirled about and flung into the sea as food for fishes. This entire section dramatizes the crucial role of the oath in such codes of honor, and the necessity of so establishing the sexual purity of the woman, not in some physical sense, which would be impossible in any case, but by means of a public posture by the adulterer. And it is the practical and sensitive Ulysses, wise, astute, and discerning, the man of many wiles, always ready with an ad- justment, who raises this whole issue of the sexual basis of the code of honor, and who suggests the only acceptable solution-matters</page><page sequence="19">SANITY AND THE MYTH OF HONOR * 299 about which the offended Achilles was honor-bound to remain silent. That the king of men was actually lying is strongly suggested by the facts of the case, and by Ulysses' references to go "the way of man and woman," and the ironic fact-keenly sensed by Homer's audiences-that the gods did punish him after his return home, when he was slaughtered by his wife and her lover-husband. The foregoing scene and its interpretation must depend heavily on the meanings of the term Ate. These meanings are central in Homeric ethnopsychology. Agamemnon, as we saw above, is quite explicit about Ate. His etiology is shared by Achilles, who cites Ate during their initial confrontation in book one, and later during book nine ["Let the son of Atreus go to his doom and not disturb me, for Zeus the counsellor took away his understanding" (ix. 378)]. And now, during the reconciliation, continues, "Father Zeus, great indeed are the dtai you give men. Else the son of Atreus would never have persisted in arousing the thumos in my breast, nor intractably taken the girl against my will" (xix. 270; thumds, "wind," spirit, source of motivation). Achilles and Agamemnon thus depend heavily on the ideology of ate while going through the ritual of apology. Rather than involving free will, punishment, or moral guilt, as in some later Greek works, Ate, as correctly defined by Cunliffe, Havers, and others, refers to a state of mind, specifically a stupor, clouding, perversion, or blinding, a possession, a partial or tem- porary insanity that "is ascribed not to physiological or psychologi- cal causes, but to an external 'daemonic' agency" (Havers 1910). Thus Ate is one variant of the more general phenomenon of "posses- sion" that is found in so many cultures. The external agencies, as Agamemnon says, are the Fates, the Furies, and Zeus himself, who is the father of the Atai. Ate labels the mysterious and nonritual forces in a theory of personality where behavior is generally explained by knowledge, where, as Dodds says, "unsystematized, non-rational impulses, and the acts resulting from them, tend to be excluded from the self and ascribed to an alien origin."l2 The theory of Ate enables men to transfer onto 12. Eric R. Dodds (1967). A famous crux is raised by book sixteen, where Achilles seems to leave out of account the earlier offer of restitution by Agamemnon, an offer that had included the promise of an oath of apology (ix. 275-80). I would agree with Eichholz that in book nine the conditions or presuppositions of the offer were still unsatisfactory, particularly because Achilles was expected first to relent. By book sixteen the balance has changed and Agamemnon has been brought to his knees; see David E. Eichholz (1953).</page><page sequence="20">300 * ETHOS an external object their feelings of shame (aid6s) in the face of public opinion. Ate resembles the allied symbol of menos, "life energy, life force," in being the objectification of a psychological state that has replaced the inner voice of one's spirit, one's thumos. In terms of the "myth of honor" being developed, here, the theory of ite provides those who breach the code with a ready-made ra- tionalization, a systematic basis for an apology. COMPARATIVE NOTES: SEXUAL HONOR AND THE SCHOLAR'S CULTURE The interpretations of Achilles as abnormal or deviant or a "gorilla," that ignore the system of sexual honor as an intervening variable, have largely stemmed from scholars in recent centuries and Western, urban cultures, particularly middle-class, academic cultures. Many misperceptions of what motivates Achilles consist of rather obvious taboos. Murray, for example, translates aidds (xxII. 75) as "nakedness," where it actually refers to the genitals- and to an audience that was well aware that animals, dogs in this case, go first for the innards and testicles of a cadaver. And Priam is described as rolling in euphemistic "filth," whereas the Homeric word here means "dung." Clearly, there is a filter of translation much thicker than Homer's own, considerable rules of verbal propriety. Would familiarity with the contemporary patterns of the Medi- terranean world free these scholars from their ethnic biases? There is no question about the many analogies between Iliadic and con- temporary Mediterranean cultures. For example, in southern Spain a man still primarily gets honor from his father, but shame from a mother (in case she is dishonored). Yet little is gained by this fashionable leap if it only means to exchange one ethnocentrism for another, to jump from some West- ern, middle-class world view into the (posited) one of a moder Cypriot peasant. The Iliadic system of honor actually differs from that of the contemporary eastern Mediterranean in many crucial ways. For one thing, there is the explicit concern, which seems al- most an obsession, not only to avenge through death, but to imagine a torturelike mutilation after death, and vaunt about feeding the corpse to vultures and pariah dogs. A second such diagnostic differ-</page><page sequence="21">SANITY AND THE MYTH OF HONOR * 301 ence is in the role of explicit or self-conscious intent on the part of the offender, "that the other should dare to affront one" (Pitt-Rivers 1966:26). Such a concept of freely exercised will only appear later in Greek literature (as has already been suggested by the foregoing discussion of Ate). A third major difference was the relative lack of concern with premarital chastity; the key term, pdrthenos, certainly referred, in some contexts, to a woman's virginity, but in others it had to do mainly with her status as unmarried. The essential Homeric con- cern, was not with physical virginity but with the seduced wife and the protection and control over these wives. Female promiscuity and the seducer are a threat, not so much because the woman is spoiled through illicit intercourse, but because her extramarital relations endanger a man's ego, the stability of his family, and in- volve the bride price or whatever else the woman cost him-they threaten his integrity in a diffuse and comprehensive sense. The adulterer or would-be adulterer in Homer, be it Paris, Agamemnon, or Aegisthus, threatens the values of male society, and is therefore contemptible. This contrasts with the dashing and virile Spanish Don Juan who is admired for humiliating a husband (which re- flects, in turn, the breakdown of loyalty between males-to the point where anyone is fair game). Finally, some of the codes of honor in today's Spain and Greece are based on a concept of romantic love and a medieval and chivalric image of female personality, whereas in The Iliad, as noted, the feelings of the offended male are moti- vated by the same sort of personal identification that one feels to- ward parts of one's body, primary relatives, one's household-more or less the set that can take the adjective philos. In a culture-histori- cal sense many of the differences between Iliadic and the modern, Mediterranean systems of honor result from the influence of Chris- tianity, and specifically the rather extreme forms it took in Catholic Spain and Byzantine Greece. Clearly, many "anthropological" in- sights can flow from comparing Iliadic honor with the roughly cognate Mediterranean ones, even from field work in a Greek vil- lage, and this serves as a salutary leaven to the sort of ethnocentrism that is almost caricaturized in psychoanalytically based studies, such as that by Slater. But the two distantly cognate systems must never be confused or identified. The Iliadic system has to be inferred</page><page sequence="22">302 m ETHOS almost entirely from the texts in terms of a perspective that com- bines comparative literature, the interdisciplinary, social scientific comparison of cultures, and the insights of philology and linguistics. CONCLUSIONS: THE MYTH OF HONOR The foregoing analysis should have clarified the "structure of honor" as having a pragmatic and a code component, the latter consisting of a large network of propositions and entailed injunc- tions, the former principally of a "catalyzing" and a "resolving" as- pect. The pragmatic dimension is complexly interconnected with the underlying code. Such systems of honor are loosely but consis- tently reticulated with a widely ramifying and subtle idiom, much of it specific to a given language-and-culture, or at least to an arena such as the Mediterranean. A specific value complex of honor was seen to be part of a larger network of honor that involved numerous other complexes such as wealth, magnanimity, and "excellence," these complexes being related to each other in diverse, logically distinct ways. It was argued that honor and the honor-linked complexes were mainly predicated on keeping women relatively deprived of honor, on competing for women as symbolic of honor, and ritualized con- flicts over women that intermittently revitalize the entire system of meanings. In these general and specific senses the system of honor is primarily rooted in sexuality and the relations between the sexes. And because the system was at once based on such sexual criteria but rationalized and legitimized in multifarious terms that were largely nonsexual (e.g., ite), it seemed appropriate to speak of "the myth of honor," with the intended implication that all systems of honor are myths that rationalize and idealize subjugation by force. Thus Simone Weil's famous title, "The Iliad or the Poem of Force," acquires a new and more realistic signification. The sexually based system of honor is ultimately motivated by virtue of being linked with the sense of integrity, whether of indi- viduals or groups-their desire to maintain integrity, their fear of losing it. Although the sense of integrity varies from one individual and group to another in its specific symbolization, the general phenomenon of integrity is universal, as is its role in motivating or "driving" emotional and cognitive systems. Although this is stated</page><page sequence="23">SANITY AND THE MYTH OF HONOR * 303 here as an assumption, the proposition has massive empirical sup- port in the evidence from individual psychology and the cross- cultural studies of anthropology. There is much direct and indirect evidence to be found in the large literature on "the sanctity" of the integrity of the individual and of social groups-their boundaries, defining names, diagnostic possessions, and so forth. The univer- sality of this feeling of integrity suggests that some analogue of honor operates at a deep level in all societies, including the many that lack the specific sorts of symbols that we find in The Iliad, or the Spain of Cervantes, or the Old Testament, or the contemporary Bedouins, or yet other variants of "Mediterranean culture." The sexual basis of honor, and the power of women to dishonor, make Achilles' wrath seem more intelligible. Possessed of the great- est quantum of honor in terms of the Iliadic code, he is by the same token the most vulnerable to dishonor through the sexual defile- ment of a women in terms of whom he defines his own integrity, and this is in fact the most damaging way he can be dishonored. Achilles' words and deeds seem normal in terms of what above were called the presuppositions and enjoinings of Iliadic culture. He moves in terms of exactly the same system that motivates the para- gon of pragmatic sanity, the astute Ulysses, to slaughter more than one hundred suitors, and lynch dozens of "disloyal" maidservants. The difference between the sanity of Achilles and that of Odysseus is to a considerable degree a matter of personal style and specific rules for behavior. Both are egregiously realistic, for exam- ple, but Achilles is poetic and rhetorical, and more arrogant in the specific sense of being given to invective and self-assertion-but al- ways within the bounds and in the terms of the code of honor that enjoins him to dishonor others, win it for himself, and save face.13 Thus the sanity of Achilles fits into the more general paradigm and is, in fact, a condensation of the system of honor, particularly the sexually based aspects that inform so many major and minor lines of The Iliad. 13. Paul Friedrich and James Redfield (1977). Certain social scientists are squeamish about "literary examples." Here, however, I could have used "real life examples" from contemporary Greece, or my own field work in Mexico, but the essential points about catalysis, idiom, and so forth, are illustrated from The Iliad-in a way that is more heuristic because most of the readers are already familiar with "the data."</page><page sequence="24">304 * ETHOS REFERENCES ADKINS, A.
