<plain_text><page sequence="1">L 67 J THEOPHANIES IN THE OLD TESTAMENT AND THE SECOND PERSON OF THE TRINITY. PIECE OF EARLY CHRISTIAN SPECULATION. Early Christian writers were, of course, always ready to find prophecies of Christ in the Old Testament, but there Is one piece of speculation to be found in several early writers which seems to have metaphysical and theological implications not possessed by the more usual "proof text" method of Old Testament interpretation. This is the opinion that wherever God or His angel is described in the Old Testament as appearing, or speaking, or doing anything which might seem to be too anthropomorphic, it is not God the Father who is so described, but God the Son—or, since sometimes theological language has not reached this point of precision, we may say more simply, Christ. I propose to outline how some of the early Fathers set forth this doctrine, and to suggest some of its implications. It should, however, be pointed out first that there are probably traces of this doctrine to be found in the New Testament itself. Note that the doctrine consists in some thing more than a belief in the pre-existence of Christ, or in an identification of Christ, for instance, with the Sophia of the Wisdom literature. It involves always a reference to some specific appearance or action of God in the Old Testament. I have noticed two such probable references : the first is from John xii, 41; here the author of the Fourth Gospel quotes Isaiah vi, 9-10, and adds the -comment: " These things said Isaiah because he saw his glory; and he spake of him." Bernard in his commentary suggests that the writer is thinking of Isaiah's vision, described in the opening verses of the chapter. This seems very likely, and, if it be true, the theophany here is certainly looked on as being in fact an appearaince of Christ. The</page><page sequence="2">68 THEOPHANIES IN OLD TESTAMENT AND second passage is from Revelation i, 13; this is a description of an appearance of the glorified Christ, and it is narrated in terms taken from Daniel x, 5 sq. In the Daniel passage the appearance is certainly that of an angel, but he is not specifically named (as, for example, the angel is in Dan. ix, 21), and it is possible that the author of the Apocalypse meant to identify him with Christ. The famous passage in I Corinthians x, 4 ("and that Rock was Christ") is not strictly relevant here, as it does not refer to 'something described in the Old Testament as an appearance of God or His angel. It is perhaps Justin who is the most conspicuous among the early Fathers for his emphasis on the doctrine that Christ is signified in all the theophanies of the Old Testament. But it is very interesting to observe the reason he gives for his belief. In 356 E of his Dialogue with Trypho, Justin says of God the Father: "The ineffable1 Father and Lord of all does not arrive anywhere, nor walk, nor sleep, nor rise up, but abides in His own, place, wherever that is, seeing clearly and hearing clearly, not with eyes or ears but by His irresistible power . . . He is not moved, but on the contrary is not contained by any place nor by the whole universe, since He was before the universe came into being." Justin then goes through many of the anthropomorphisms of the Old Testament saying that these must refer to Christ since God, the Unmoved, the Ineffable, could not be referred to thus. Earlier on (276 E) Justin, in arguing that one of the three angels who appeared to Abraham was Christ, says : " Otog erepog tariv (.SC. 6 ayyeXop) tov ra iravra noiriaavTog Otov, apiOfitf Xiyw aXX' ov yvwfiy." As we shall see when comparing what Irenaeus says, Justin's presentation of this doctrine is fraught with perilous metaphysical implications. Irenaeus held indeed the same doctrine; but, perhaps because he is not so much concerned in his extant writings with refuting the Jews as the heretics, it is not</page><page sequence="3">THE SECOND PERSON OF THE TRINITY. 69 so prominent in his works. In IV, 9, 1, of his Against all Heresies, he says: " Both testaments have been pro duced by one and the same householder, the Word of God, our Lord Jesus Christ, who conversed with Abraham and Moses, and restored to us our liberty in a new fashion, and multiplied the grace which proceeds from Him." Also, in III, 6, 1, we find : "Again the passage, 'And the Lord rained fire and sulphur from the Lord from heaven,' refers also to the Son who spoke to Abraham." (My quotations are from Dr. Montgomery Hitchcock's translation.) Plainly then Irenaeus, like Justin, is anxious to' explain the anthropomorphisms of the Old Testament by making them refer to the Son. But, while Irenaeus is one with Justin in his belief in this doctrine, the reasons for which he regards the Son as the Person referred to in the Old Testament theophanies are different to those which Justin gives. Apart from the common concern which they had to avoid anthropomorphism, Justin also objected to the idea of God appearing to men because his conception of God made such a thing difficult; as he says in reference to Jacob's "vision at Bethel: "Think not that the unbegotten God Himself came down or went up from anywhere." In Irenaeus such a conception of God is not nearly so prominent; Justin's reason for emphasising this doctrine, if logically followed out, would lead him to a denial of the possibility of any real incarnation. One gains the impression from his writings that Christ was almost a second best in the way of an incarnation, because such a thing was impossible for the High God. Irenaeus, how ever, gives no such impression; he makes it plain that Christ is the Word of God, that is to say, that He is God's method of revealing Himself; and if he believes that the divine theophanies in the Old Testament are in fact appearances of Christ, that is because Christ has always been God's way of revealing Himself, and not because God was unable to reveal His Very Self. One could</page><page sequence="4">70 THEOPHANIES IN OLD TESTAMENT AND quote many references to confirm this. Here are three : IV, 20, 4: " But since He who worketh all in all is God, although in His greatness and nature invisible and in describable for His own creatures, He is by no means unknown. For all His creatures learn through His Word that there is one God the Father who contains all things and gives them their existence." IV, 20, 7: " And therefore the Word was made the steward of paternal grace for the advantage of men, on whose account He made such great dispensations, revealing God to man and presenting men to God." V, 16, 1 : " For in times past it was said that man was made in the image of God, but it was not shewn. For the Word was still invisible in whose image man had been made . . . But when the Word of God became flesh He confirmed both. For . . . He firmly established the likeness, making man like the invisible God by the visible Word." So far, then, Irenaeus contrasts with Justin : Justin is afraid of theophanies, not only through a perfectly legitimate fear of anthropo morphism, but also because his conception of God makes it difficult to think of God appearing to man at all. Irenaeus has no such metaphysical difficulties, as his view of the relation between the Father and the Son proves. No doubt the reason why he accepted this doctrine of the Son's appearances in the Old Testament was because he wished to explain its more crude anthropomorphisms. There is, however, one passage in his writings where he seems to fall in with Justin's conception of God. In chapter 45 of his Etc inlStt^iv roil anoaToXiKov Kypvyfiaroe he says : "For it was not the Father of all, who is not seen by the world, the Master of all who said, 'Heaven is my throne and earth my footstool: what house will ye build me, or what is the place of my rest?' and who 'comprehendeth the earth with his hand, and with his span the heaven'—it was not He that came and stood in •a very small space and spake with Abraham, but the Word</page><page sequence="5">THE SECOND PERSON OF THE TRINITY. 71 of God who was ever with mankind and made known beforehand what should come to pass in the future, and taught men the things of God." This seems to be going distinctly too far in the direction of Justin's conception of God; but Armitage Robinson (whose translation I quote) points out that in this work Irenaeus is demonstrably more dependent on Justin's writings than in his treatise Against all Heresies, and the probability is that he unwittingly reproduced more of Justin's theology than was really consistent with his own views. In Tertullian we have something of a reversion to Justin's outlook : in chapter 15 of his Adversus Praxeam (Migne's ed. of the Pair. Lat.) he contends that wherever in the Old Testament men are represented as seeing God, in reality they saw God the Son, God the Father being invisible always, and in chapter 16 of the same work he says in effect that all anthropomorphisms in the Old Testament refer to God the Son. So far he has gone no farther than Irenaeus; but in Adv. Marcionem, Book II, chapter 27, he shews why he thinks this must be so: " Deum non potuisse humanos congressus inire nisi humanos et sensus et affectus suscepisset, per quos vim maiestatis suae, intolerabilem utique humanae mediocritati, humilitate temperaret, sibi quidem indigna, homini autem necessaria . . . Igitur quaecumque exigitis Deo digna,, habebuntur in Patre invisibili incongressibilique et placido et (ut ita dixerim) philosophorum deo. Quaecumque autem ut indigna repre henditis, deputabuntur in Filio, et viso, et audito, et congresso, et arbitrio Patris et ministro, miscente in semetipso et hominem et Deum." In Adv. MarcionCm Book VII, chapter 9, he goes even farther, and maintains that Christ was actually incarnate in the Old Testament. He is speaking of the three angels who appeared to Abraham, maintaining that one of them was God the Sop and he says: " Ideoque et ipse cum angelis tunc apud</page><page sequence="6">72 THEOPHANIES IN OLD TESTAMENT AND Abraham &lt;sc. apparebat&gt; in veritate quidem carnis, sed nondum natae." In conclusion, one may make a number of comments on this strange doctrine: one great objection to it is that, certainly in the form in which Tertullian proposed it, it impugns the uniqueness of the Incarnation. Even on Tertullian's assumptions, it was not necessary to assume that God was actually seen in the flesh by anyone in the Old Testament. But there is a second objection which goes deeper, which is concerned with metaphysics as much as with theology, and which strikes at the root of this doctrine in any form, even as presented in Irenaeus' more careful language. We may ask: What was the barrier that prevented the proper communion between God and man before the Incarnation? The answer, surely, is Sin, not createdness. The fact that man is created, visible, partly material, is not a barrier; God made the created, the material, and He can do what He wills with His own creation. Now when Tertullian, for example, says that God the Father is the god of the philosophers and could, of course, not be seen by man, he lays himself open to the danger of representing the barrier between God and man as being something metaphysical rather than moral. The Greek god is a god who by his very nature cannot make himself known to man. The Hebrew God is a God who can and does when He chooses, and refrains from doing so if He chooses. " Verily Thou art a God who hidest Thyself" has as its corollary the conception of a God who can also reveal Himself if He chooses. Tertullian and Justin (and to a smaller extent Irenaeus) are in danger of making God the Father a god who cannot reveal himself to man because of his metaphysical status. Christ, then, since He can reveal Himself, must be of a different (and therefore inferior) metaphysical 'status. It is all the difference between a moral and a metaphysical "cannot." Again, if we ask, "What was the barrier that the</page><page sequence="7">THE SECOND PERSON OF THE TRINITY. 73 Incarnation was intended to remove?" the answer must be, Sin. The process of removal involved, it is true, a becoming visible on the part of God, an appearance of the tiKtov tov aoparov Oeov, but it was not man's visibility, nor his materiality or corporeality, that needed to be removed. The Son must be in metaphysical status exactly the same as the Father, or else He has not revealed the Father. Therefore (pace I Timothy vi, 15-16) you cannot start from the Greek "unapproachable god." Unapproachable He cannot be by nature, though He may, of course, choose not to make Himself known; or His unapproachability may arise from His holiness, but not from His unity or His ovala. In short, this speculation of the early Church concerning the theophanies in the Old Testament leads to a metaphysical or epistemological, rather than to a moral and religious, mediator.
