<plain_text><page sequence="1">IRISH DISCOID GRAVEMARKERS George Thomson of Cumbria Institute of the Arts, explores an interesting form of stone sculptural funerary artefact, the circular or oval headstone, commonly found in the graveyards of counties Cavan, Fermanagh, Monaghan and Tyrone. Tombstones, gravestones, grave markers, graveyard memorials?call them what you will?are an important part of a nation's heritage. They record the lives of the country's past inhabitants and tell us a great deal about those who erected the monuments in their memory. Perhaps it is because they remind us of our mortality that the general attitude towards burial-grounds is of either total avoidance or fascination. Those who appreciate the unique atmosphere of a graveyard often end up becoming absorbed by an interest in the epitaphs, sculpturing, symbolism or genealogical associations of the memorials, a fascination that frequently develops into a lifetime pursuit. Considerable thought will often have been given by relatives or friends to the design of the memorials that will be seen by generations to come. On older gravestones, through the epitaphs and symbolic carvings, we see evidence of the level of respect in which the individuals were held and an appreciation of the contribution they made to the community. We find both morbidity and humour. Ireland is a treasure trove for anyone interested in this not-so grave affair. The wealth of high crosses in Ireland is a common focus for those interested in sculptural artefacts. Looking more closely, we see that the funerary memorials of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries are every bit as interesting and are, arguably, a much more valuable resource for the archaeologist, cultural historian or genealogist. The variety of different gravestone forms of this period in Ireland is rivalled only by that in Scotland. Nowhere else in Europe are there memorials of this period displaying such a plethora of shapes, sizes, sculptural iconography and lettering. The various styles of headstones, with their decoration, symbolism and inscriptions, reflect both the 1 o Archaeology Ireland Autumn 2006</page><page sequence="2">Left: A great variety of gravestone types in Aghalurcher old graveyard, Co.

Monaghan. tastes of the local community and the ingenuity of the masons by whom they were made, either by naive skill and enthusiasm or pure creative genius. The discoid form and decoration Many of the individual forms of gravemarkers could offer years of focused research material. Here we explore just one of them, the discoid headstones, circular or oval (discoid) stone sculptural funerary artefacts, usually formed of a round upper part mounted on a short shaft, in Ireland ranging from small markers only 45cm high to larger monuments rising to nearly 2m. This style of memorial dates from the classical Roman period or before and is found throughout Europe. There are many, possibly of a medieval date, in the Languedoc region of France and in Portugal, and others of the early modern period in the Basque lands of France and Spain. But the largest number of late seventeenth- and eighteenth-century discoids is to be found in the counties of Cavan, Fermanagh, Monaghan and Tyrone. The burial sites with this type of memorial extend from Scarvagherin, Co. Tyrone, in the north to Carrickaboy, Co. Cavan, in the south, and from Templenaffrin, Co. Fermanagh, in the west to Tydavnet, Co. Monaghan, in the east. Within this boundary more than 300 have been found, with the largest concentrations in south Fermanagh, the far north-east of that county and south-west Tyrone. The burial sites with the greatest number of discoid headstones are at Donagh and Aghalurcher in County Fermanagh. These graveyards have between them nearly 70, but there are also many at Killeevan, Co. Monaghan, and Kilskeery Old, Co. Tyrone.

There are three main groups. In north Fermanagh and south-west Tyrone the most common form incorporates raised Roman lettering (so-called 'false relief) carved within a cross, starting in the uppermost arm and sometimes continuing on the shaft. The inevitably very short lines on the upper and lower arms of the cross led to some very strange word breaks. The reverse is sometimes carved with a simple cross but is often plain. The most common form in the rest of Fermanagh, Cavan and Monaghan has no cross carved on the inscribed face. This is reduced to very short projections at the top and sides of the disk. Lettering is usually, but not always, incised. The reverse of this type is usually carved with mortality symbols. The most northerly discoids in Tyrone, and a few in the far north of Fermanagh, are true ringed crosses, with the cross and ring forming a single unit. The four counter-sections of the cross and ring are sometimes pierced. Lettering on this form is usually incised and cut on the ringed part of the memorial. The stones are frequently, though not invariably, carved on both sides, with lettering on the obverse face and mortality or other symbols, when present, on the reverse. The most common symbols are the skull (nearly always cut front-on), crossbones, coffin, bell and hourglass. Other carvings include tradesmen's tools, astronomical signs and quasi-heraldic symbols. Some early discoids, and many in north Fermanagh and Tyrone, have a cross on the reverse of the headstone, often crudely carved. Iconographie images never appear alongside the lettering, and lettering is not used with the mortality symbols. This is a quite different situation from the tradition in Scotland, where mortality symbols and lettering, often in the form 'MEMENTO MORI', are frequently on the same face. The origin and evolution of the Irish discoid gravemarker There are two main theories as to how the discoid forms originated. One is that they relate in some way to sun worship. The other is that both discoids and the high crosses have an anthropomorphic foundation, a development from the head and body of primitive stone monuments carved in human form, originating in east central Europe. The earliest inscribed discoid is at Magherculmoney, Co. Fermanagh, and is dated 1679, and the Irish discoid form may have originated in this area. From then on there appears to have been an evolutionary development as the use of the discoid form spread throughout west Ulster, initially eastwards into west Tyrone and then south to Fermanagh, by which time the simpler, larger form with mortality symbols became dominant. Meanwhile, in the north the early discoid headstone became a very short ringed cross. The most recent discoid gravemarker, excluding 'modern' revivals, is at Aghalurcher, Co. Fermanagh, dated 1797. Why this style of memorial arose and became so popular in this region of west Ulster is difficult to say. It would be easy to conclude that the ringed-cross shape of the discoid gravemarkers in north Fermanagh and Tyrone has its origins in the Celtic high cross, but this is far too simple a hypothesis. Although these memorials incorporate both a cross and a ring as a major element of the design, they are more discoid than cruciform in concept. There are several discoids in Fermanagh in which the cross is absent. The cross on discoids in south Fermanagh, Cavan and Monaghan is 12 Archaeology Ireland Autumn 2006</page><page sequence="4">GRAVEMARKERS reduced to short projections at the top and sides of the disc. Nor is it a continuation or revival of a discoid-making tradition. In the Basque lands of France and Spain the traditional use of discoid memorials was extended from medieval times through to the eighteenth century and was even revived in the 1970s by the Luberau Association in Bayonne. Nothing of this sort persisted in Ireland to any extent. Indeed, there is only one known truly discoid medieval stele in Ireland, on Devenish Island. Similar iconography in the form of mortality symbols was used on the reverse of many contemporary vertical slab headstones. It has been suggested that the use of the skull, crossbones, bell, hourglass and coffin was a consequence of Scottish influence. These same mortality symbols are certainly found on graveslabs of the seventeenth century in parts of Scotland. While this is indeed a possibility, however, an association is hard to substantiate as the same iconographie representation can be seen on post-medieval graveslabs in many parts of western Europe. Inscriptions and lettering By far the most common inscription begins 'HERE LYETH THE BODY OF . . .'. On some discoid stones in Monaghan and Cavan it starts with TRAY FOR THE SOUL OF . . .'. Other versions are rare but include 'ERECTED BY . . .' and THIS MONUMENT WAS ERECTED BY . . .'. The most pedantic inscription is at Killeevan, Co. Monaghan, and begins THIS STONE AND BURIAL PLACE BELONGETH TO . . .'. The initial letter of the inscription is often larger than the rest of the text but it is never flourished, as is the case with many contemporary Irish and British headstones. The use of the Anglo-Saxon character Y (thorn) for 'th' is sometimes seen on discoid stone inscriptions in Monaghan between 1728 and 1762 and on a stone at Drumully, Co. Fermanagh (1747). Mirrored letters, where the character is flipped left to right, are more common than on English headstones but less so than on Scottish memorials. They are restricted to the letter N, with the exception of one inscription at Aghavea, Co. Fermanagh (1723), where the capital D is mirrored throughout the text. The use of the IHS cipher is a distinctive feature in the south of the area but is rare in the north. When present, it often forms a very dominant part of the inscription, sometimes taking up the top half of the disc. The design invariably comprises the capitals I, H and S, with a cross arising from the horizontal bar of the H. This, in turn, is sometimes in the form of an inverted V, a convention that is not uncommon in the rest of Europe and the USA. The use of lettering in Roman capitals, with the frequent inclusion of the ligatures TH, HE and THE, is common to both discoids and vertical slab headstones. The ligature is an ancient device that can be traced back to the earliest literate civilisations and is found on post-medieval graveslabs and headstones in Britain, the rest of Europe and North America. The most common ligatures in English-language tombstone inscriptions are TH, HE, THE and NE. More than 65 letter combinations and some numeric ones have been identified. Perhaps surprisingly, combinations other than TH, HE and THE are extremely rare on Irish discoid headstones but include TE at Magheracross, AN at Galloon and NN at Magheraveely, Co. Fermanagh, NNE at both Galloon and Kilskeery, Co. Tyrone, and MB at Edergole and ME at Killeevan, Co. Monaghan. Ligatures are significantly more common on discoid headstones than on other forms of gravemarker. This could be because ligatures reduce line length, so that the inscription can better fit the area and shape available: discoid gravestones are usually smaller than most other headstones. This may not be the only reason for their increased use, however. There is evidence from Scottish studies that ligatures were used creatively rather than for functional purposes. s*Sfc? -ri ^ , "r-r*i.^_V^ "&lt;^y-^ ?m Archaeology Ireland Autumn 2006 13</page><page sequence="5">3 Left (top): Discoid headstone with raised archaic Roman lettering?Magheraculmoney, Co.

The circle?a recurring theme Whether it is related to sun worship, anthropomorphic form or some other association, the circular element of these gravemarkers appears to have been the consequence of a powerful inspiration that was manifest in the various discoid headstone types. The discoid gravemarker may not have been sustained as a memorial form throughout the nineteenth and twentieth centuries in Ireland but a vestige of the concept is a recurring theme in later memorials. When the large, vertical slab headstone became the norm as a gravemarker early in the nineteenth century, perhaps because it provided more space for longer inscriptions, the rectangular stone was often topped with a disc within which the IHS cipher was located. The significance of these west Ulster discoid headstones cannot be over-emphasised. They have an important place in the history of material culture and should not be obscured by the large number of high crosses and their popularity, or confused with them. Irish discoid gravemarkers constitute a group of headstones produced by masons as a distinct form within a discrete regional culture. They are a unique expression of an artefact form that spans centuries across much of western Europe and that flourished in west Ulster for over 100 years.
