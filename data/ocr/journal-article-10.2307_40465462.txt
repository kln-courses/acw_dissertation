Most are farmers growing princi- pally maize, and also groundnuts, manioc, sweet potatoes, and taro. Some have begun to raise cattle. They live on the northeastern outskirts of the Grassfields, a region which is famous for its variety of languages and high density of ethnic groups. The maintenance of a specific Wawa iden- tity is therefore a continuous challenge, which is made more difficult by the fact that the Wawa have converted to Islam and are "fulbeizing" - adopting aspects of Fulbe culture (Gausset 1997, 1999). Today, apart from their language, which is spoken less and less by the younger generation, it is difficult to differentiate the Wawa from their neighbours. They still have a tendency to live together in compact villages, next to neighbouring Fulbe villages, but the way of life found in both settlements does not differ much and a foreigner unaware of the distinction might easily mistake one for the other.1 Things used to be very different only a few generations ago. At that time, the Wawa were very famous in the region for their skills in iron smelting (although they did not practice much blacksmithing, unlike the neighbouring Torbi or Kila). People say that the hoes made from this excellent quality iron lasted five times as long as the cheap, industrially-produced hoes, whose Anthropos 96.2001 production after World War II caused the demise of traditional craftsmanship. Historically and po- litically, the Wawa also distinguished themselves from many of their neighbours by making an alliance with the Fulbe newcomers during the first half of the 19th century, and by participating in slaving raids on the Kwanja and Mambila popu- lations living further south (Gausset 1997, 1998; Hurault 1975; Mohammadou 1978, 1991). They played an important role in the management of the sultanate and had numerous influential dignitaries at the palace. Yet, the influence of the rural Wawa lessened dramatically, as the dignitaries and their descendants fulbeized and as a consequence of the European colonization, which undermined the previous alliance between the Fulbe and the local populations (Gausset 1998). The Wawa kinship system is based on patri- lineages, which were responsible for the orga- nization of the now defunct rituals and within which the political titles are still inherited.2 Com- plementary filiation, based on bilateral ties, plays an important role (all bilateral parents are respon- sible and have to help if one of their relatives is sick; witchcraft and diseases which are considered to be "hereditary" can be passed both through the mother and the father). People entertain very strong links with their maternal grandparents and are sometimes brought up by them. This strong link is also reflected in the practice of matrimonial alliances, which are not very different from those existing among the Yamba and Bamiléké (Gufler 1 Next to most Wawa villages there has been created a Fulbe village bearing the same name. One can thus distinguish between "Oumiari-Wawa" and "Oumiari-Fulbe," "Gandwa- Wawa" and "Gandwa-Fulbe," etc. This is a result of the tensions which still exist between the two populations, due to the difference in their statuses and their access to political and economic power (Gausset 1999). 2 Wawa political organization is quite loose, as among the neighbouring Mambila; there was no institutionalized chief before the arrival of the Fulbe in the first half of the 19th century (see. Gausset 1995, 1997; Zeitlyn 1993, 1994b).</page><page sequence="2">194 Berichte und Kommentare 1995; Brain 1972; Pradelles de Latour 1992). Traditionally, the Wawa could choose between a marriage by exchange of sisters or a marriage by matrimonial compensations. In the first case, the focus was on the equity of the transaction. Ideally, both women should give birth to the same number of children. If one marriage was sterile, the other one had to be broken and the children taken back to the woman's father. If both marriages were successful, the fathers kept the rights over their children and their offspring. In the case of a mar- riage by matrimonial compensation, the husband only acquired rights in uxorem (over his wife) but not in genetricem (over her children). The wife's father kept the custody on his daughter's children, and would collect the highest part of their matrimonial compensation (which consisted of 3 to 10 hoes). Things are now slowly changing under the influence of Fulbe culture; the focus on patriliny becomes more important and the Islamic rules of inheritance are increasingly followed. In fact, apart from their language, their re- nown in iron smelting, and their alliance with the Fulbe, one of the main differences between the Wawa and their neighbours was their specific religious practices, before they converted to Islam and abandoned them. They were characterized, on the one hand, by large annual or biennial ancestor cults which restored the fertility in the villages (described in Gausset 1995) and, on the other hand, by their masquerades, which I am going to analyze in this article. The contemporary study of masquerades has become problematic, as they are no longer prac- ticed after the mass-conversion to Islam at the end of the 1960s (Gausset 1999). After converting, the Wawa have then burned or buried their wooden masks and completely abandoned their rituals.3 Only the old people remember them, and their memories are the only remaining clues to the cosmological and ritual importance of the mas- querades. Yet, thirty years after the last ceremony was performed, it is striking to see how secret it still is. During my research, each time I touched upon the subject, the voice of the informant was lowered, and he glanced around to be sure that nobody was listening. Although the masks are now burnt or buried, their power is still greatly feared - the punishment for revealing their secret to a noninitiate (and especially a woman) used to be death. When I showed my informants some old pictures taken during the last funeral orga- nized in Oumiari,4 their excitement was intense. They explained which stage of the funeral was represented, the name and origin of the different masks, and even - the ultimate secret - who was dancing under the mask! In this way, through the interviews, I could reconstruct the major events, which took place during a masquerade, and get an idea of their importance for the Wawa. Of course, having never witnessed one myself, the description of the masquerade which follows cannot claim to be a detailed and accurate description of the ritual but, limited as it is, it still provides us with interesting information. On the one hand, when put in relation to the present beliefs and practices surrounding bush spirits, it helps us to understand the complexities of the symbolic cycle linking the world of the dead with that of the living. On the other hand, the description which follows is based on the memories of some 20 informants who have participated in masquerades and whose opinions about them give important insights on the importance which they had for Wawa identity. Wawa Masquerades Each Wawa patrilineage had one (and only one) wooden mask5 which was distinct from that of other patrilineages - with perhaps feathers, teeth, or a beard - and had a personal name, often associated with the name of the lineage. Although the Wawa did not distinguish between them on a morphological basis (all the masks were called sowei), it should be noted that some of the wooden masks were anthropomorphic, while most in some way resembled Mambila wooden masks, depicting a kind of "animal" with a big mouth and three "horns" (see Zeitlyn 1994a). There were different taboos associated with the wooden masks: people could not have sexual intercourse before touching them or dancing with them; one had to sacrifice a chicken before using them; they could not be soiled by rats, fire, or humidity; they could not be seen by women or children, etc. The wooden masks were treated with awe because it was be- lieved that those who did not "respect" them, or who transgressed the taboos associated with them, could be struck dead. 3 In order to distinguish between the event, the figure, and the headpiece I will use the terms masquerade, mask, and wooden mask. 4 The pictures were generously provided by Jean Hurault, to whom I am grateful. 5 The wooden masks were not made at each rimerai; each lineage kept its only mask as long as it remained undam- aged. It is to be noted that the village of Gandwa had no tradition of organized masquerades. Anthropos 96.2001</page><page sequence="3">Berichte und Kommentare 195 When a man died, masks appeared at each of the three stages of the funerary rituals.6 During the three first days following the death, the widows stayed in their houses. The houses were then swept and the ashes were scattered at a crossroad by the widows and close kin of the deceased. There, they cooked a chicken, ate it, broke the cooking pot, and returned to the village. A few days later, when there had been time to brew beer (which takes about ten days), a mask representing the spirit of the deceased man entered the village and danced in the compound while everyone mourned. The widow must not see it, and stayed inside her house. This first ceremony was called "the mask of the ashes." A few months later, the mask representing the deceased (i.e., the mask of the deceased's patri- lineage) came into the village again, this time with the masks of the other patrilineages of the village. People again displayed sadness and mourning dur- ing the dances. Thick porridge was prepared which was deliberately badly cooked, with roasted but almost raw and unsalted chickens. The masks took the food and went to a special place in the bush, called "Mbarai." The women could not approach this place because it was believed that they would become ill if they witnessed the violent movement of the masks during the dance performed there. Adolescents who "did not know the secret of the masks" did attend. They laid on the ground and were tickled and frightened by the masks. They were told to say nothing of what happened, and were chased back to the village. In Mbarai, the head of the deceased's lineage cursed any witches who might use their witchcraft during the ceremony. He also said: "If the death of X (the deceased) was natural, then it is fine, but if he has been killed by a witch, let that witch die within a few days." This pronouncement was punctuated by the sound of single bells, supposed to have magical powers against witchcraft, and by the movement of the masks which touched their lips to the ground. All this was believed 6 The fact that wooden masks represented only men's spirits does not mean that only these became ancestors. For example, ancestor cults were also practiced at the tombs of women, and they could address the spirits of dead women. The funerals of women did not involve masquerades. I heard that women of the village of Mbenguege - and only this village - organized semblances of masquerades (I have been told that they used calabashes instead of wooden masks), but I was unable to verify this information as I did not do my fieldwork in this village and as it is a secret which is well-kept by women (this "masquerade" was not a public event like those organized by men). to be powerful antiwitchcraft magic. If a partic- ular person was suspected of having killed the deceased, this person came, swore that he had done nothing wrong, and licked the wooden mask of the deceased. If he was guilty, he was supposed to die soon; if he was innocent, nothing would happen. The masks danced for some time, then returned to the sacred forest of their patrilineage, from whence they came. This second ceremony was called "the mask of the road." The last mourning ceremony was the biggest, and involved not only all the masks of the village but also the masks of other lineages whose mem- bers had married a spouse from the patrilineage of the deceased. This ceremony was called pupurbi, and took place during the dry season, between one and two years after the death. Once again, the masks came to the compound. This time, the widows painted their faces with ashes or white clay and danced around the crowd which danced close to the masks. The masks were again given almost raw and unsalted food, and went to Mbarai to eat it and to pronounce curses against witches. The boys who were terrorized during the previous ceremony attended again - except those who could not keep the secret and had told other children what had happened. This time, they were shown "the secret of the masks," namely that the masks were not spirits but human beings, who deceived women and children. They then swore to keep the secret. If the deceased was an old person, a small portion of his beard had been taken from the corpse before burial and preserved within a piece of elephant grass. During the pupurbi ceremony the masks brought this elephant grass to Mbarai and threw the beard into a calabash filled with palm wine. If the beard sank, the deceased's widows were supposed to have had sex since his death - which is strictly taboo. The ceremony was spoiled and proceeded no further. If it floated, it meant that the widows had mourned properly. The masks then returned happily to the village, and this time the dances were really joyful and animated. In the compound, the mask representing the deceased turned the basket, in which the deceased's clothes were kept, upside down. He took the deceased's spear and threw it away; the young people ran after it: whoever found it could keep it. The masks danced in the compound. In the evening, before leaving, the mask of the deceased shook the hand of each widow, all of whom wore a bag over their head to prevent them from seeing their "dead husband." The villagers danced all night. In the morning, the widows went to the river to wash themselves. Their heads were shaved, and the cord Anthropos 96.2001</page><page sequence="4">196 Berichte und Kommentare worn around the neck as a sign of mourning was cut. The mourning had officially come to an end, and the widows were then free to remarry. The Association between the Spirits of the Dead and the Spirits of the Bush It is clear from the above description that the masks represent the spirits of the dead, either of the deceased for whom the ceremony is organized, or of the other dead from the hereafter. Yet people also say that the wooden masks resemble the bush spirits although nobody has ever claimed to have seen one. When I asked about the specific form of the wooden masks, an informant told me the following story: A long time ago, humans lived peacefully with bush spirits. When someone died, they called a spirit to come and mourn the dead. After the mourning, the spirit ate huge quantities of food. One day, though, there was not enough food and the bush spirit ate a child. The men decided to get rid of him. They accustomed the spirit to catch the food which they threw to him. Then, instead of food, they threw a red hot stone and when he swallowed it, he died immediately. People made wooden masks in his image, and ever since, they are used to mourn the dead. However, the relationship between the spirits of the bush and the spirits of the dead is more than just a resemblance, or of bush spirits mourning the dead. They are also symbolically and cos- mologically equivalent. On one hand, the bush spirits are called ginaji, a Fulfulde term with the same etymological root as our "genie." They are also called cicangai, a Wawa term often translated by informants as "the winds" (these spirits are supposed to travel in the wind and streams), al- though the term "génies" or "bush spirits" seems more accurate. On the other hand, the spirit of a human being (living or dead) is called either hakilo (Fulfulde term) or foo (Wawa term meaning "wind"). Both bush spirits and those of the dead are supposed to travel in the wind. When there is a strong wind in the village, pregnant women stay indoors to protect their babies from the bad influence of the bush spirits. When bush spirits are hungry, they can devastate a field with a storm. The bush spirits are often associated with dis- order. They can possess someone and make him mad: he is then said to be "disturbed by the wind." They inflict diseases on anyone who steps on them while walking on a road. They can make pregnant women who go alone to the river miscarry. They can enter the womb of a woman who washes herself in a river after menstruation and give her amenorrhea (she is also said to be "disturbed by a wind"). They can also turn her baby into a "spirit child." Descriptions I have been given of "spirit children" suggest that they may have a genetic deficiency. Such a child is left alone on the bank of a river while people hide in the bush and observe it. If the child is really a spirit, it will soon transform itself into a huge snake, raise its head to the sky, and then fall into the river (some informants claim to have witnessed this). If it is a human child, it will just cry until its parents take it home. Not only bush spirits disturb humans; the spirits of the dead can also provoke disorder, especially for widows. They cannot run, dance, or speak loud, and it is said that if a widow has a sexual rela- tionship while she is mourning, then the "wind" (the spirit) of her husband, will render her insane. However, she can also be driven mad by sadness. If she cannot stop thinking about her husband, or if she dreams of him, it is a sign that her husband's spirit is still haunting her, and it can drive her mad. During the long mourning, she sleeps with magical medicines under her head to prevent her husband's spirit from visiting her - i.e., to avoid dreaming about him too much.7 Remembering and Forgetting The three mourning ceremonies can be analyzed as progressive attempts to chase away the spirit of the deceased, in other words, to make the widow forget him. Before the first ceremony, during the first three days of mourning, the deceased's spirit remains in the compound and the widow cannot leave her house. During and after the second ceremony, other spirits from the hereafter come to collect him, and take him "on the road" to the outer world. He has not yet arrived there, however, and still haunts the human world, especially the widow. During the third ceremony, the deceased's spirit departs forever after a last farewell to the widow. He will not return; the widow is supposed to have "forgotten" him and to stop mourning. If she does not do so, it means that the spirit of her husband is still there and is making her insane. The three ceremonies of mourning thus depict a 7 Widowers have to follow the same taboos as widows - and for the same reasons - but they are less strict when it concerns sex. If they are polygamists and have surviving wives, they are allowed to sleep with them after the first mortuary ritual, a few days after the death. Anthropos 96.2001</page><page sequence="5">Berichte und Kommentare 197 progressive removal of the deceased's spirit to the hereafter, which goes hand in hand with the human world gradually forgetting him. The aim of the funerals is dual: on the one hand, they gradually disaggregate individuals from the soci- ety (both symbolically and through a process of forgetting); on the other hand, they reestablish the society through the incorporation of the soul in the community of the dead and through reallocating the roles the deceased once occupied (Bloch and Parry 1982: 4). Just as reinstallation goes hand in hand with disaggregation, so is forgetting an accomplishment of remembering (see also Battaglia 1992: 12). The widows cannot help but remember their husband since the strict taboos that they have to follow prevent them from living a normal life and remind them constantly of their special status. Each one of the three ceremonies is a remembrance of the deceased, who comes back to the village for a short time, and the ceremony is followed by a loosening of the prohibitions accompanying the mourning. In other words, the spirits of the dead are more and more forgotten after each formal remembrance. The last ceremony frees the widows of all taboos, allows them to resume a normal life, and forces them to forget their grief. While they cannot help but remember their dead husband during the mourning period, they are compelled to forget him after this period ends. To continue mourning would be a sign of insanity caused by the "disturbance" of the spirit of the deceased caused, in turn, either by the unforgettable love that the woman nourishes for her husband, or by her spoil- ing of the mourning period through breaking the taboo on sex. In this case, the punishment for the women who forget too easily and too soon is madness and an eternal remembrance through possession by the spirit of the deceased. Women have to remember and mourn their dead husband until the last ceremony is finished in order to forget them, or they run the risk of never getting rid of their husband's memory and spirit. After the last mourning ceremony, one still remembers the deceased, but only during the organization of ancestors' cults. These cults are practiced around tombs, at crossroads, and deep places in rivers, where bush spirits are thought to reside. Whenever someone has a serious problem, he goes to the tomb of one of his close agnates, or to any crossroad, if the tomb is far away. He pours water mixed with maize flour on the ground, and spills some palm wine, while addressing the dead and asking for luck or for general help in his troubles. Similar rituals on a wider scale are also organized once a year by all the members of a patrilineage. They clear the tombs, pour water mixed with flour on it, spill palm wine, slaughter a chicken, and address the ancestors with prayers such as: "As we remember you and give you wine and chicken today; you should also remember us and give us plenty of children, abundant crops, and good luck in hunting." Moreover, every other year the whole village organizes a big ritual in which a goat is slaughtered on the collective tomb of the chiefs in order to cleanse the village of all sins and to bring fertility and abundance. Although this ritual might be analyzed as a scapegoat sacrifice linked to the dangerous aspects of the chief (see Gausset 1995), it can also be seen as the biggest ancestor cult organized by the village. After the offering on the tomb, everybody goes to wash in a deep pool in the river where rituals are conducted to cure women of fertility problems so that they may conceive children. The nature of ancestor cults is opposed to that of mourning ceremonies. While the purpose of the later is to remember the dead in order to forget them and to be forgotten (left in peace) by them, the aim of the ancestor cults is to remember the dead and give them offerings in order to be remembered and given fertility and good luck by them. The mourning ceremony reaffirms the distinction between the world of the living and that of the dead, and helps the soul of the deceased in its difficult transition between the two. On the contrary, the ancestor cults aim at bridging the dichotomy between the two worlds and are based on a logic of gift-giving and reciprocity. The Spiritual World and the Spirits of Newborn Babies People say that children "come from the water," and this statement refers both to "men's water" (their semen) and to the water of the river, where the spirits of the dead and bush spirits live, and from where the spirits of children come. Although everybody knows that children are produced by sexual relations, people also believe that concep- tion can only occur with help from the spirits living in the water. All living creatures have both a vital principal, yonki, and a spiritual principal, hakilo or foo. Life is provided to babies by the parents during sexual relations and during pregnancy, but the child's spirit is thought to come from the spirits who live in the water. It is unclear whether those spirits are in fact spirits of the dead (ancestors) or bush spirits, but Anthropos 96.2001</page><page sequence="6">198 Berichte und Kommentare these two kinds of spirits are almost interchange- able. For example, although the ritual of fertility which is conducted in deep water, is part of the ancestor cult, people believe that those places in rivers are especially inhabited by bush spirits. They also think that when humans address prayers to the ancestors in those places it is, in fact, the bush spirits who answer the prayers, and who are responsible for the fertility of women. It might be useful here to distinguish between the offerings made on tombs and those made in deep water. The former are made to the named ancestors (those buried on that spot) who are thereby remembered, while the latter are made to ancestors whose names have been forgotten. This distinction is important because some informants, when pressed by the anthropologist to explain the resemblance between human spirits and bush spirits, said that the latter are probably the spirits of the very ancient dead, whose names have been forgotten. In short, al- though bush spirits and ancestors are believed to be different entities, they are both described as wind, they are both represented by masks, they live in the same places, they are responsible for the same kind of disorders, and they have the same powers (both answer the prayers addressed to ancestors). They are thus very similar to one another, and the main difference between them may simply be a question of seniority, bush spirits being those ancestors whose names have been forgotten. A child's spirit is acquired slowly and fixed pro- gressively during childhood. To say that somebody has a spirit (hakilo or foo) may mean different things. First, it means that the person is conscious: when the spirit leaves the body, the person be- comes unconscious. Someone in a coma or dream- ing, for example, is unconscious because his/her spirit has left the body to meet other spirits (wheth- er of living humans, of dead persons, or of bush spirits). When a witch wants to kill somebody, his/her spirit leaves his/her body unconscious and travels to attack the victim. Secondly, the spirit can also be understood as reason or the senses, A mad person is often thought to be someone whose spirit has left his/her body. Those who are about to die, often mumble incoherent things, and claim to see things which are invisible to other people. It is said that although such people are still conscious, their spirit has already left their body and is talking to the spirits of the hereafter who have come to meet them. In the same way, somebody who is suddenly awakened from sleep does not immediately have all their wits about them; it takes a few seconds before their spirit "finds the way back to the body," i.e., before they recover their senses. Thirdly, the spirit can mean intelligence. Stupid people are like mad people: if they have no sense, they "have no spirit." These three aspects of the spirit - conscience, reason, and intelligence - are only slowly acquired by children; their spirit is said to be not truly fixed in their body. First, children are often asleep (unconscious), during which time their spirit is thought to wander around. Secondly, babies cannot talk properly and say incoherent things. When they are pointing to the sky, mumbling or crying, with no human nearby, they are thought to be "talking to spirits," either spirits of the dead or bush spirits. Thirdly, young children are ignorant; they do foolish things, have no memory, are shameless, etc. In short, the spirits of babies and young children are very volatile and not yet "fixed in the body." Only progressively, as they learn to talk, to recount their dreams and to behave in a socially acceptable way, do they stop communicating with invisible spirits and acquire their own spirit. The unfixed spirit of a young child is supposed to be wandering around in the spirit world. It is supposed to miss being a spirit of the bush, and to long to return to the spirit world from which it came. It is believed to be tempted to immerse itself in water and stay there instead of returning to the child's body. Special precautions are thus taken to prevent this. Neither a pregnant woman nor her husband may kill fish, snakes, frogs, or snails - all animals associated with water - because that might kill the spirit of the unborn child. The first time a mother crosses a river with her baby, she leaves a small offering (an egg, or some chicken feathers) on the riverbank, so that the spirits of the river do not try to keep the child's spirit with them. Moreover, after she has crossed a river, the mother always speaks to her child, saying something like: "Come, we are now going to visit this person." Her child's spirit is supposed to be playing with the spirits of the river, and would stay there if the mother did not call it to follow her. When a mother bathes her baby, she must be careful to pour the water gently out of the basin; if she threw it away violently, she would risk throwing the spirit of her child. If a child will not stop crying, a diviner is summoned who will look for "the water from which the child comes." Once he has found that specific river or lake, he will bathe the child in it and give it some of the water to drink. Twins are even more strongly associated with water spirits. When twins are born, their parents always seek the river which they come from so that they can drink its water and bathe in it. That stretch of water then belongs to them, and others must ask their Anthropos 96.2001</page><page sequence="7">Berichte und Kommentare 199 permission to fish in it. Clearly, the spirit of a child is believed to come from the water, and to originally have been a water spirit. The child's spirit is supposed to miss the time when it was in the water (maybe a metaphor for the uterus) and to wish to return to it and play with its friends. It is to prevent this that the parents take the precautions listed above. Although the Wawa do not actually believe in reincarnation (nobody really knows or speculates about who the spirit of a baby was before birth), a clear "life cycle" or "spirit cycle" is recognized, in which the spirits of humans pass after death into the hereafter, become gradually bush spirits as they are forgotten, and return to the human world when a baby is born. Among the Wawa as elsewhere, death is seen as a source of life; it implies rebirth. "The rebirth which occurs at death is not only the denial of individual extinction but also a reassertion of society and a renewal of life and creative power" (Bloch and Parry 1982: 5). The masquerades, celebrating the passage from life to death and from the human world to the hereafter, mark one of the most important stages in that cycle, and the symbolic equivalences between spirits of the dead and bush spirits explain why the masks representing the former are said to be made in the image of the latter. Modern Disillusion Today, the Wawa have converted to Islam and have abandoned their masquerades. Yet, they still con- tinue to practice discreet ancestor cults - although it is disapproved by Islam. They also continue to believe in bush spirits and to follow the taboo linked to them, but it is unclear whether they do this because this type of belief is more "private" and does not involve big rituals opposed to Islam, or because the Fulbe share many of these beliefs in bush spirits. The Muslim notion of paradise where the souls of the dead go is now mixed with the traditional spiritual world. Although the masquerades are no longer practiced, the fact that the spirits of children are still believed to come from bush or ancestor spirits indicates that the cycle described above is still valid. The belief in the symbolic cycle between the dead and the living has survived the surrender of masquerades, which were the most prominent public manifestation of this cycle. Yet, as the masquerade was one of the main markers of Wawa ethnicity, its surrender had serious and profound consequences on the negotiation of their identity. Anthropos 96.2001 It is especially the older generation which re- grets the loss of masquerades while the younger generation is uneasy about it. It is the young Wawa who began to convert to Islam in the 1960s. It is here important to know that the form of Islam in Adamawa comes from the Fulbe and originates from the Empire of Sokoto. It is the result of a movement of religious revivalism intent on creat- ing a purer Islam. It is therefore less tolerant or syncretic than in other parts of West Africa, and the Wawa converts refused to participate in the masquerades that their parents were organizing. Seeing this, the older generation began to fear that nobody would be left to organize their own funerals when the time came. They feared that nobody would take care of their corpse, as the Muslims of the area refuse to touch or bury dead non-Muslims. They felt compelled to follow their children's lead in order to secure a decent funeral. Even if they are often only nominally Muslim and continue to drink alcohol and eat wild pigs, their face is saved and they keep on good terms with their children. The younger generation, on its side, converted to Islam in order to acquire a respectable identity which was seen as "modern." They wanted to be considered on equal footing with the Fulbe, who dominate the politics and the economy of northern Cameroon (Gausset 1999). Yet, it is not sufficient to convert to Islam to acquire a respect- able identity. One will still be despised unless one succeeds in presenting oneself as a Fulbe. Conversion to Islam is, therefore, usually followed by a process of fulbeization. But this process can not be complete as long as people cannot claim a Fulbe ancestry. This can be achieved if one moves to a town where one is unknown, but this is very difficult for the Wawa, as they live close to Banyo town and cannot hide their origin (Gausset 1999). Since they abandoned their masquerades and became Muslims, the Wawa are balanced between the will to "remain Wawa" and the wish to get rid of this embarrassing identity which is associated with a lower, slave status, and with paganism. Their "pagan" past still taints their participation . in Islam, allowing the Fulbe to cast doubt on the purity of their faith. Although they abandoned their traditions to adopt Islam, they are caught between two identities, being neither pagan nor considered as true Muslims. The data for this article were collected during a total of 18-months' fieldwork among the Wawa and the Kwanja between 1992 and 1996.
