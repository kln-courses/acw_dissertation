Five essays by Ralph Barton Perry, August Charles Krey, Erwin Panofsky, Robert Lowry Calhoun, and Gil- bert Chinard. Edited with an Introduction by Theodore Meyer Greene. Princeton: Princeton University Press, I938. Pp. xxxix+I78. $2.50. Professor K6hler's book contains the third series of William James Lectures, delivered at Harvard during I934-35. The author clearly dis- tinguishes his purpose and his method from alternative procedures in contemporary thought. The fundamental issues of our civilization con- cern values of which we may feel convinced but which we do not under- stand scientifically. The modern scientific method does not comprehend values. Is philosophy, then, to part with science and interpret values on its own? Or shall it, with the positivists of our day, ignore the qualitative analysis of experience and concentrate on the scientifically polished con- cepts, thus gaining abstract definiteness of formulation but neglecting or quite ignoring significant or even essential aspects of nature and human nature? Professor Kbhler follows a third course, and the value of his book is in the outline of his proposed method. Science need not be so sterile, nor philosophy so unscientific in interpreting the values or, more broadly, the human factor in nature. Nature includes human nature; the complete science, knowledge of nature, must needs comprehend the scientist. It does, in fact, comprehend him somewhat in actual though not in avowed scientific procedure. The task of philosophy today is to probe these relations in natural process and in naturalistic procedure alike. Thus we may hope to find "the place of value in a world of facts." After a brilliant introductory report of the dissatisfaction of reflective but inexpert minds with the value-sterility of modern science, K6hler ex- amines in his second lecture alternative theories of value and then under- takes his own analysis. His probing of value explores several ideas basic in the scientific account of nature. The examination of "requiredness" leads him from Professor Perry's axiology to a very searching study of the phenomenological method. "It is not the subjective aspect of requiredness in human striving and interests which makes requiredness compatible with facts. Instead it is the observation that certain facts do not only happen or exist, but, issuing as vectors in parts of contexts, extend toward others with a quality of acceptance or rejection" (p. ioo). This is a typical passage, and its implications build up Professor K6hler's theory. In physical science he finds, both experimentally and theoretically, that basic entities are ultimately defined in reference to concrete perceptual</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 369 situations. "With respect to these traits the perceptual and the physical structures are isomorphic. If they were not, we could have no physics" (p. i62). In the psychological field, memory would seem to involve slight alteration by neural events of the tissue in which they occur. This is ad- vanced as a hypothesis in which the author puts considerable hope. Neural process yields certain predisposing and impending changes, aware- ness of which is memory and transcendence in mental process. Physiology seems to point in a similar general direction, as a critical discussion of the notion of "organic fitness" indicates. So again forces in nature are iso- morphic with demands. What is the further significance of this theoretical procedure? It can defend itself from the charge of unwarranted anthropomorphism. Man cannot be excluded from the process which yields physical science, nor need he be excluded. "If human experience and physical facts have some basic traits in common, then physics can use experiential or human terms, and still be an objective science" (p. 376). Thus recognizing man as in and of nature, we can treat man naturalistically but also nature humanistically as much as the facts of experience warrant. Values would then be human-but not "merely human"-merely subjective and unac- ceptable in science. They would have their place in a world of facts; and to investigate their physical and biological correlates is and must continue to be the task of science and of a really scientific philosophy. The five essays read at Princeton as Spencer Trask Lectures in I937-38 undertake a resolute defense of the humanities and of the liberal humane position in modern thought and modern life. Professor Perry opens the course with "A Definition of the Humanities." He defines them "to em- brace whatever influences conduce to freedom." By freedom he means enlightened choice; this he distinguishes from effective choice, for which he reserves the term "liberty." Enlightened choice demands learning and imagination, sympathy, and enlargement of our range of values. In this realization of freedom is the dignity of man; its outward expression is styled by Perry civility. Liberal culture has always been dedicated to this fivefold humanism. It is committed to integrity and interpretation rather than to specialized technique. This humane spirit may be maintained even in scientific work, but, naturally, it finds fuller expression in history, art, literature, and philosophy. The other four essays deal more particularly with the humanistic value of history, art, theology, and literature. Professor Krey, approach- ing his problem as a medieval historian, is openly suspicious of such terms as humanism and the Renaissance. He sees more continuity and less radi- cal reversal in the transition from medieval to modern thought than the</page><page sequence="3">370 ETHICS usual view allows. But he does point out the important shift in emphasis which marked the advent of the new age. The early modern historian owed a debt to the other humanities in better mastery of human motiva- tion in public affairs and more critical documentation and statement. The historian in our time is also learning the importance of humane interpre- tation of human life that steers between naturalistic or mere factual- statistical surveys and ideological-partisan exposition. Professor Panofsky's essay on "The History of Art as a Humanistic Discipline" contains an interesting discussion of the procedure and the significance of art-historical research as distinguished from naive love of art. He emphasizes the development of re-creative experience to conform with the results of investigation and the testing of archeological research by the evidence of re-creative experience. Art-history is not mere anti- quarian study. In exploring the past we reach beyond the present moment to grasp the human reality. The essay on "Theology and the Humanities" by Professor Calhoun is motivated by a keen sense of the dangers facing the liberal spirit today. Our humane thinking and living require the assurance "that we and the world have each some intrinsic order, and some essential congruence with each other" (p. I24). In concentrating on this cosmic view, theology manifests its humanistic importance. The theological approach is domi- nated by the theme "man saved by God." This is not complacent optimism, but a tragic prospect, yet a tragedy that can be faced with faith and hope. Religious faith may reach beyond the evidence at hand, but "authentic revelation has to keep its footing in authentic fact" (p. I46). The best defense of theology is in its humanistic worth: its "re- vealed truth" is shown to be relevant to perpetual human need. Professor Chinard in a briefer but spirited paper pleads for literature as a liberalizing humane study. The mere analysis of words reveals values that yield enjoyment of the highest order. But literature is not merely style, nor only expression of thoughts; it communicates sentiments, pas- sions, our total response to our world. Through it we can live richer and more various lives; only in imagination can we share the human destinies revealed by Sophocles or by Shakespeare. This more abundant living makes for sanity and balance. Literature is at the center of the humanities; hers are the classic treasures of human genius. Our education cannot neglect these treasures, lest, having lost tested standards and the compass of criticism, we "throw overboard the ballast of the ship and .... ride the wild waves in an empty hull" (p. I 70). In his carefully written Introduction Professor Greene undertakes to draw together the threads of discussion in the five essays, and also reaches</page><page sequence="4">BOOK REVIEWS 37I good conclusions of his own. He urges the humanistic importance of historico-philosophical synthesis. Philosophy may deal with timeless verities, but "a philosopher who divorces himself from history .... cuts himself off from his own cultural heritage and vitally impairs his own philosophical insights" (p. xxxvii).
