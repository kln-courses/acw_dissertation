<plain_text><page sequence="1">Mountain Research and Development, Vol. 3, No. 1, 1983, pp. 13-25 THE VISUAL LANDSCAPE OF THE INDIAN PEAKS AREA, COLORADO FRONT RANGE, U.S.A. ROLAND BAUMGARTNER Geographisches Institut Universitdt Bern 3012 Berne, Switzerland ABSTRACT This paper discusses mountain landscapes from a visual point of view, using the Indian Peaks section of the Colorado Front Range (Rocky Mountains, U.S.A.) as a type example. The accompanying coloured map, scale 1:50,000, represents in carto- graphic form the results of visual landscape mapping and analysis. This includes evaluation for diverse individual recreational uses in summer. It is one component of an environmental atlas, the purpose of which is to facilitate understanding of complex mountain terrain both for its own sake and to provide a basis for the development of sound management practices. Based on the landscape perception and assessment of visitors, this approach leads to the recognition of aspects of the visual landscape that constitute an essen- tial environmental resource in a scenic mountain region. Data selected from different fields of research are compiled in a single map with a combined legend. This enables the formal character of a landscape type to be compared directly with its degree of ecological stability or instability, and with its degree of attractiveness for wilderness recreational use. Thus visual conflicts, as could occur in highly attractive areas that are likely to experience a high degree of human impact, are clearly displayed. The need for especially careful landscape management is underscored. RtSUMt Le paysage visuel (avec une carte au 1:50, 000 d'un secteur des Rocky Mountains U.S.A.). L'aspect visuel du paysage constitue une ressource naturelle essentielle des regions montagneuses pittoresques. Le present travail fait partie d'un "Atlas de l'environnnement" destine a faire comprendre les conditions et les phenomenes naturels d'un ecosysteme montagneux ainsi que la necessite de le proteger et de l'utiliser rationnellement. On a inventorie et taxe tous les elements visuels naturels jouant un role pour un tourisme individuel estival de delassement varie dans le parc (Wilderness Area) des Indian Peaks du Colorado Front Range (Rocky Mountains). Ces donnees aideront les scientifiques, les planificateurs et les autorites responsables a determiner les possibilites et les limites du developpe- ment touristique d'une region attractive, mais delicate du point de vue ecologique, en tenant compte des elements esthetiques et visuels particulierement apprecies des visiteurs. En plus des facteurs du milieu qui influencent la stabilite ecologique et visuelle, on a analyse non seulement quelles sont la nature, la grandeur et la distribution des elements visuels du paysage, mais aussi dans quelle mesure ceux-ci contribuent a l'attrait de la region et au bien-etre des visiteurs. On a represente les elements etudies sur une carte (The Visual Landscape) de maniere a mettre en evidence les conflits existants et possibles entre l'utilisation touristique et la conservation du paysage avec son pouvoir d'attraction naturelle. On insiste sur 'importance de la protection du paysage et des mesures de planification necessaires a cet effet dans les regions de montagne en grande partie encore vierges, convenant pour le tourisme. Comme exemples d'application des resultats on discute certains travaux du Service forestier des U.S.A. ZUSAMMENFASSUNG Die visuelle Landschaft (mit cinem Kartenbeispiel aus den Rocky Mountains im Masstab 1: 50,000). In diesem Fachbereich steht der visuelle Aspekt der Landschaft als essentielle naturliche Ressource in einem landschaftlich reizvollen Berggebiet zur Diskussion. Die vorliegende Arbeit ist Teil eines "Umwelt-Atlas", dessen Ziel es ist, Verstandnis zu wecken fiir die natiirlichen Gegebenheiten und Vorgange in einem Gebirgsokosystem sowie dessen Schutz und Management. Die Naturgrundlagen-Daten aus dem visuellen Bereich und die Evaluation derselben fur einen vielseitigen Individual-Erholungstourismus im Sommer wurden in den "Indian Peaks" der Colorado Front Range (Rocky Mountains, U.S.A.) erhoben. Sie erleichtern es dem Wissenschafter, Planer und Entscheidungstrager, die Entwicklungsmoglichkeiten und Grenzen dieser spezifischen Art von Nutzung in einem 6kologisch empfindlichen, zugleich aber fuiir den Erholungssuchenden erlebnisreichen Gebiet aus visuell/aesthetischer, besucherorientierter Sicht zu beurteilen. Neben Art, Grosse und raumlicher Verteilung der visuellen Landschaftselemente und -komponenten wurden deshalb auch deren Stellenwert fuir die Attraktivitiit der gesamten Region, das damit verbundene aesthetische Wohlbefinden der Besucher und relevante okologische Beobachtungen (6kologische/visuelle Empfindlichkeit) in die Untersuchung miteinbezogen. Die Gegenuiiberstellung ausgewahlter Daten aus simtlicher dieser Untersuchungsbereiche in eincr Karte mit kombinierter Legende (vgl. beigelegte Karte "The Visual Landscape") zeigt Konflikte und Konfliktsmnoglichkeiten zwischen touristischer Nutzung und der natiirlichen landschaftlichen Szenerie klar auf. Es wird die Wichtigkeit des Landschaftsschutzes und eines entsprechenden Managements in mehrheitlich unberuihrten, fiir den Einzel- tourismus attraktiven Berggebieten unterstrichen. Als mogliche Anwendung der Resultate werden Arbeiten des U.S. Forest Service diskutiert. </page><page sequence="2">14 / MOUNTAIN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT INTRODUCTION During the last two decades North America in general, and the United States in particular, has experienced a growing concern over the use and management of wild lands, areas relatively untouched by human activities. This has been embodied in the concept of wilderness and the wilderness movement received formal definition by Congres- sional passage of the Wilderness Act on 3 September 1964. Under the terms of this Act wilderness is defined as . . . an area where the earth and its community of life are un- trammeled by man, where man himself is a visitor who does not remain." An area of wilderness is further defined to mean ". . . an area of undeveloped Federal land retain- ing its primeval character and influence, without perma- nent improvements or human habitation, which is pro- tected and managed so as to preserve its natural conditions and which (1) generally appears to have been affected pri- marily by the forces of nature, with the imprint of man's work substantially unnoticeable; (2) has outstanding oppor- tunities for solitude or a primitive and unconfined type of recreation; (3) has at least five thousand acres (about 20 km2) of land or is of sufficient size as to make practicable its preservation and use in an unimpaired condition; and (4) may also contain ecological, geological, or other fea- tures of scientific, educational, scenic or historical value." (U.S. Department of Agriculture, 1978). Since passage of the Wilderness Act many wilderness areas have been formally designated and much thought and energy has been expended in defining wilderness and developing management systems (Hendee, Stankey, and Lucas, 1978). It follows from the very nature of the Moun- tain West of the United States that this area especially would receive many such wilderness area designations. The very large proportion of the total area of the mountain states held under federal management has also influenced this development. However, designation of wilderness areas has frequently met with opposition, from mining and lum- bering interests, for instance, but also from recreational- ists who preferred to use mechanized equipment that is pro- hibited in formally defined wilderness. In addition, the very act of designating an area of scenic mountain land as wilderness will tend to attract the attention of the recrea- tionalist. From the ensuing increase in use the very stand- ards of wilderness, embodied in the concepts primeval, un- trammeled by man, pristine, are assailed. Thus management for preservation of those qualities that initially prompted wilderness designation becomes a matter of major concern and complexity. The Indian Peaks Wilderness of the Colorado Front Range was officially designated in October 1978, by Presi- dent Jimmy Carter, following a prolonged political strug- gle (Public Law 95-450). This area is of special interest since it occupies about 294 square kilometres (72,660 acres) astride the Continental Divide (Figure 1) and immediately south of Rocky Mountain National Park that is easily accessible to Denver (Capital of the State of Colorado) and to the so-called Front Range urban corridor (Rocky Mountain National Park Boundary Study, 1979). It has been described sarcastically as a Denver city park, the implication being that the existing intensive use and the prospect of rapidly increasing use, will result in a level of human impact such that over large areas the standards set for wilderness will not be maintained. The basis for development of an environmental atlas for the Indian Peaks Wilderness and adjacent lands has been discussed by Ives and Dow (1982). The present paper represents the second in this series of papers. It is intended to introduce the atlas plate showing The Visual Landscape (folded-in), to discuss the concepts of the term visual land- scape, to describe how the map was created, and to outline its usefulness as a management tool. THE VISUAL LANDSCAPE AS A CONCEPT Landscape is an old term that has been used in a variety of ways, both colloquially and within the scientific rubric. It must be assumed that all landscape has a visual compo- nent (Mitchell, 1973). However, the term visual landscape has come into vogue in recent years because of the need to stress the actual and perceived visual qualities of an area and to depict a qualitative experience in terms of a basic resource (Arthur and Boster, 1976). Accordingly, the visual landscape must be "treated as an essential part of and re- ceive equal consideration with the other basic resources of the land" (U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service Manual, 1980:2380.3). And since public demand for goods and services produced on much of the same mountain land has increased, it has become necessary to inventory the visual resource in order to provide measurable standards for its management (U.S. Department of Agriculture, 1973 and 1974). Only in this way can the aesthetics of landscape beauty be balanced against the capital returns from extrac- tion of minerals and forest and water resources, and other processes of using land for monetary profit. Any mountainous tract of land, such as the Indian Peaks area, possesses many different resources, such as minerals, water, wildlife, and timber. In this study a resource is defined as an available commodity that can be drawn upon when needed and that has monetary value or other importance for humans (such as the means of attaining or maintain- ing physical health and psychological well-being). All re- sources can be attributed to one of the five geographical spheres into which the total environment can be divided: 1. lithosphere (earth's crust, including its rocks, soils, and shape) 2. hydrosphere (all water on the earth's surface, includ- ing ice: flowing or static) 3. atmosphere (the gaseous envelope surrounding the lithosphere and hydrosphere) 4. biosphere (the totality of living things) 5. anthroposphere (the human population and its im- pact; often included in literature as an additional sphere).</page><page sequence="3">R. BAUMGARTNER / 15 FIGURE 1. The eastern part of the Indian Peaks research area from the air, looking west-southwest toward the Continental Divide. The core of this diverse landscape, shaped by tectonic uplift, glaciation, water, vegetation, and human activity, is the wilderness area managed by the United States Forest Service. As soon as an area becomes increasingly used by dif- ferent types of visitors, its integral value for recreation be- comes an important resource for the whole region. Studies in the United States and in Western Europe, and especially public surveys, such as those conducted by the United States Forest Service in the Indian Peaks area, have shown that attention should be directed primarily to the natural and semi-natural attributes which provide opportunities for dispersed recreation (Brown, Haas, and Manfredo, 1977). In this context the overall natural impression of landscape (scenery) appears to be one of the most impor- tant attributes influencing the choice of people in deciding where to spend leisure time (Hodgson and Thayer, 1979). Thus scenery must be considered as a resource. It should be regarded as a composite resource, as the sum of many different elements attributable to all five geographical spheres. Beginning in the mid-1960s, the functions and processes of natural landscape systems increasingly have become the objectives of scientific research. A new branch of environ- mental science has evolved under the term Landscape Ecology or Geoecology. Many of the studies have been designed to solve land management problems and the term carrying capacity has been adapted, not always successfully, from grassland management. Landscape experience has been identified as one of the primary commodities of natural re- source management. However, one problem has recurred in this specialized field of research: many studies have been restricted to consideration of only a few factors which, in the initial stage of the investigation, appear to be domi- nant. Such studies usually cannot characterize the land- scape as a whole; for example, vegetation, relief, or scenic quality are considered separately (Dasman, 1959, revised 1976; English and Mayfield, 1972; Netherlands Society for Landscape Ecology, 1982). In recent years there has been an increasing amount of research on how people perceive and evaluate the environ- ment, and how they behave toward it (Yi-Fu Tuan, 1974;</page><page sequence="4">16 / MOUNTAIN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT Colorado Department of Highways, 1978; U.S. Depart- ment of Agriculture, 1979a; Payot, 1981; Price, 1981). Re- search methods in psychology and other social sciences have become more and more sophisticated and have been progressively adopted by geographers. This in turn has led to researchers with a strong natural science background moving into behavioural fields. Environmentalists have found that human perception of a given location can have a profound influence on the decision-making process. In addition, elucidation of the relationship between human perception and behaviour has become a vital part of the environmental educational process (Saarinen, 1974). As indicated above, the Wilderness Act of 1964 considers scenery (visual landscape) as an important natural resource which enhances the quality of visitor experience. From this it follows that the visual landscape must be evaluated and protected as a wilderness resource. In order to achieve this goal several requirements must be met: (1) completion of an inventory of all visual wilderness elements; (2) compila- tion of a list of criteria, with justifications, for evaluation of specific visual resources in need of protection; and (3) determination of those elements, and combinations of ele- ments, that constitute high scenic value. In the National Forest Landscape Management the U.S. For- est Service has inventoried visual resources and has pro- vided measurable standards for their management (U.S. Department of Agriculture, 1973). The Visual Management System (U.S. Department of Agriculture, 1974) is a hand- book to guide planners in the production of Visual Quality Objectives maps. This work, however, leaves a major prob- lem unsolved because management decisions cannot be based upon a detailed analysis of landscape elements, although the study takes "variety classes" and "sensitivity levels" into consideration. It does not actually inventory the visual environment and does not indicate which elements or combinations of elements (components) create high recreational values and which do not. The planner is working with areas, not with landscape elements. Nevertheless, this U.S. Forest Service approach is very useful, applicable, and efficient for the assessment of for- est land by measurable standards. An example of the prac- tical application of the Visual Management System is the visual resource inventory of Alaska's National Forest lands (U.S. Department of Agriculture, 1979b). This involves a classifi- cation of scenic quality according to degree of variety. It is based upon the assumption that all landscape has some value, but those with the most diversity possess the great- est potential for high scenic quality. Thus the Visual Char- acter Types have been defined in great detail. The Scenic Beauty Estimation method (Daniel and Boster, 1976) provides quantitative measures of aesthetic prefer- ences for alternative wildland management systems. Exten- sive experimentation and testing with user, interest, and professional groups is undertaken to validate the measure- ments. It is stated that National Forests are a significant source of scenic beauty and that management must be responsive to the value of this resource. Meaningful indicators of public esthetic preferences are necessary to comprehensive, multi-use planning and management of public land. Objective measurement only can place scenic beauty as a resource on a more equal footing with other more tangible resources and would provide better justification for land use decisions. Thus, the major purpose of this second Forest Service approach is to develop a technique for measuring scenic beauty in terms of public perception and judgement only. In most approaches for assessing visual landscape, the evaluation of sites is undertaken without adequate scientific inventory and analysis of the natural and man-made resources. Very often a site is initially rated without con- sideration of its component parts. The importance of estab- lishing a quantitative approach to scenic beauty is not be- ing questioned here. However, it is also essential to pro- vide the planner and land manager with detailed base data in an unbiased form. It is postulated, therefore, that compilation of an integrated visual landscape inventory is necessary before management decisions related to the visual resource can be made (Baumgartner, 1977, 1979a). This postulate forms the primary justification for the visual land- scape map that accompanies this paper. PRELIMINARY LANDSCAPE INVENTORY (INDIAN PEAKS STUDY) The preliminary, or instrumental, landscape inventory was compiled to provide an integrated formal basis for use in subsequent interviews of area users (cf. section on "Visual Landscape Evaluation") as well as for the final map (cf. section on "The Visual Landscape Map"). Thus it was intended as an objective description of the visual landscape elements with genetic explanations. Attempts to analyse the visitor's perception, evaluation, and actual experiences constituted a second step. There are several possible approaches. A simple topo- graphic map, or a shaded relief map (Ives and Dow, 1982), a terrestrial photograph, or a true-colour air photo- graph, are all more or less objective landscape inventories. The qualification is in any case made because the objec- tives that motivate the photographer or map maker will influence the final product (Driscoll et al., 1978). For the preliminary visual landscape inventory U.S. Forest Serv- ice colour positive conventional air photographs, together with black and white prints at a smaller scale to provide an overall impression, were initially used, as well as all available scientific data in mapped form. A checklist of dif- ferent fields of research and three different geographic methods were observed constantly to ensure uniformity and replicability of the analysis. FIELDS OF RESEARCH The shaping factors of the visual landscape The overall appearance of every landscape is primarily influenced by its mode of formation. Different periods and types of crustal movement result in present-day differences</page><page sequence="5">R. BAUMGARTNER / 17 FIGURE 2. Geology, geomorphology, general relief, and vegeta- tion cover are dominant factors of the visual resource. This view of the area near Diamond Lake shows the interfingering of trees and meadows with rock features; the visual dominance changes from vegetation to abiotic elements. in elevation and in overall relief. Weathering, erosion, and deposition of materials have contributed to the existing meso- and micro-relief (Richmond, 1974). Thus the following geological/geomorphological/reliefcriteria (Baumgart- ner, 1977) were taken into consideration (Figures 2 and 3): a) b) c) d) e) main topographic characteristics meso- and micro-relief slope angles and composite slope geometry structure, form, and composition of the surface visually outstanding geologic or geomorphologic fea- tures. These characteristics were included only if they were visually conspicuous and not subdued by other factors. Hydrology: Hydrologic features, such as lakes, swamps, creeks, perennial snowbanks, and glaciers, that are of major importance to the assessment of scenic quality, were emphasized. Forest and other vegetation: In addition to the abiotic fea- tures, vegetation and other biotic factors are in most areas also critical to the visual interpretation of scenic landscape types. The most obvious vegetation feature, timberline, which in the Indian Peaks area generally lies at about 3,060 m (Hansen-Bristow, 1980), was accentuated strongly on the final map. The following visual vegetation character- FIGURE 3. The overall appearance of every landscape is primarily influenced by its mode of formation. In geomorphically active areas vegetation is of limited importance for the visitor's land- scape impression and experience. istics have been used to specify the landscape types (Figures 2 and 4): a) structure of forest (coniferous, deciduous) b) density of trees c) existence of shrub layer, understory; grass cover; wet spots in forested areas d) existence of alpine tundra vegetation e) sparse patches of alpine tundra vegetation in rock areas f) degree of moisture indicated by tundra vegetation or grass cover (e.g., bogs and fens). These criteria also were applied for the preliminary visual landscape inventory only if they were relevant aspects of a certain landscape unit; symbols were used to emphasize less dominent elements. Human activities as shapingfactors: In many regions of the world, particularly the European Alps, but also in some mountain areas of the United States, human land use has become as significant as geology/geomorphology/relief, hy- drology, and vegetation for landscape characterization. Not only have agriculture and forestry changed our environ- ment, but road construction, and, with increasing intensity, tourist installations, and impacts such as trampling of trails and alpine tundra, camp-fires, wood-cutting, and undis- posed trash, produce an evident, sometimes quite perva- sive, visual aspect of the environment (Ketchin, 1980).</page><page sequence="6">18 / MOUNTAIN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT FIGURE 4. Forest and other vegetation are critical to the visual interpretation below timberline, on wide valley floors, and on gentle ridges (see also Figure 1). Because human impact was at first glance not obvious in the Indian Peaks area (only relatively small, intermit- tent areas are dominated by man-made features), the iso- lated impacted areas were separately listed and indicated by supplementary mapping symbols, augmenting the infor- mation conveyed by abiotic and vegetation units. The fol- lowing were taken into consideration (Figure 5): a) logging (deforestation, selective logging, regeneration), including beetle-killed forest b) mining (tailings and spoil heaps, destruction of vege- tation) c) road cuts and construction areas d) settlements e) dams and reservoirs. For display on the map these phenomena were included either in the description and unit colours of abiotics or vege- tation, or were represented by the symbols mentioned. The three main geographical methods As is evident in any unit description, each landscape type has actually been elaborated in three ways; this allows the presentation of a certain unit from three different perspec- tives: formal, genetic/historical, and functional (Baumgartner, 1977). This mode of unit description originates with the three main approaches to geography: (1) Through the formal/descriptive approach landscape forms and structures are objectively characterized by measuring or simply enumerating observed fea- tures. Such cataloging of environmental elements portrays their actual appearance, but it does not interpret genetic or historical interrelations of the landscape. Conclusions generated by this approach are easily reproducible by other observers. (2) Through the genetic/historical approach an explanation is provided of the origins and historical develop- ment of landscape features which have resulted FIGURE 5.

The logged area shows some regeneration and has been mapped as "sparse forest" with symbol A (Anthropomorphic Fea- ture) to supplement other given infor- mation.</page><page sequence="7">R. BAUMGARTNER / 19 from a combination of active forces. This approach corresponds most appropriately to the mathema- tical term "function": any landscape unit is gene- tically the function (result) of a certain factor, or combination of several factors. The interrelations between shaping factors and today's landscape are indicated. (3) The functional approach provides a characterization of the use, or the usability of the landscape unit. This approach produces data such as actual land use, potential use, and possible human experiences. For this study such description covers the interrela- tions between today's visual landscape and its effects on and in humans. The functional approach is often defined as "looking forward" in compari- son to the "looking backwards" of the genetic approach. It describes facts or circumstances as a function of the actual landscape. For the Indian Peaks landscape all three approaches were employed in order to provide meaningful criteria for initial visual landscape unit delineation as well as for their descrip- tion in any legend. Although a genetic term such as "rock- glacier", for example, is by itself not the actual descriptive explanation of that specific visual phenomenon it is used initially for approach (1), because it is the most appropriate and shortest way to describe it formally. CHRONOLOGY OF PROCEDURE (PRELIMINARY LANDSCAPE INVENTORY) There were four major steps in the compilation of the preliminary landscape inventory and they are described in this section of the paper. Step I: delineation of visually uniform areas (mostly physiotopes) on air photographs The boundaries of visually uniform areas were drawn following classic photo-interpretation techniques using both true colour positives and black and white prints. No special interpretative knowledge or equipment, or special imagery, was needed for this step. The mapped units were numbered consecutively, but no definition or description was at- tempted initially. Different interpretors achieved such a remarkable degree of consistency in demarcating unit boundaries that this part of the process was restricted to a number of test areas. Only one fifth of the entire study area was mapped. The complete mapping, including the units elaborated here, was undertaken after the legend had been finalized (Step IV). Step II: description of the delineated landscape units In this step the uniform, but contentless mapping units were supplied with descriptive scientific data and identical units were summarized in a preliminary legend. All avail- able information was initially compiled for each map unit following the guidelines (fields of research) provided by the checklist. About 60 different legend units resulted from this step. For the purpose of reducing the number of mapping units and for definition of visual dominance it was neces- sary to employ a matrix system (next step). Step III: the matrix system This was a device to combine all existing criteria in one map with an integrating legend. The visual landscape im- pression is a combination of abiotic or dominant vegeta- tion aspects, or a combination of both, with additional information, such as man-made or man-influenced features included through the use of symbols. For every possible matrix combination a determination could be made as to whether it was rare, or non-existent, and which factor would be dominant and to what degree. It could also be determined whether or not the non-dominant elements needed to be recorded, and also which matrix units could be combined into a single legend unit. This step enabled the generation and compilation of com- bined dominant landscape types and their formulation into the preliminary legend; and this facilitated the areal mapping of landscape features, subsequently in colour. The supple- mentary symbols were proposed according to the check- list. All decisions concerning visual dominance and legend description were preliminary at this stage. These questions were again examined through public surveys. The preliminary legend is not discussed in full in this paper. It was used as a working tool only, for data compila- tion, for augmenting personal knowledge of the area, and for tackling the problem of visual landscape mapping. Step IV. mapping (preliminary landscape inventory) The preliminary legend was next used for mapping land- scape elements on air photographs, orthophotographs, and partly on topographic maps. In order to attain objective- ness and uniform map data it was necessary to use con- tinuously the same checklist and photo-interpretation equipment. The following base materials were used: (1) preliminary legend and descriptions (2) lists and descriptions of the fields of research -the shaping factors of the visual landscape -the three main geographical methods (3) additional information from Step I. The actual mapping of the entire research area (560 km2) proceeded as follows: U.S. Forest Service colour positive conventional air photographs (paper prints, 23 x 23 cm, approximate scale 1:15,000) were used in stereoscopic pairs for clear delineation. The actual interpretation was drawn on clear acetate film overlays to protect the photographs and to ensure comparison with other parts of the atlas project. Symbols were applied to supply supplementary in- formation or for areas that needed subsequent checking. Following this primary delineation each map unit was checked once again to make sure that it did in fact repre- sent the dominant visual aspect of a landscape unit. This proved necessary, especially to register modifications through the application of symbols. Finally, all the data were transferred to U.S. Forest Service orthophotographs, scale 1:24,000, and to air photograph enlargements at approximately the same scale. This transfer to the 1:24,000 scale completed the preliminary inventory; the orthophoto- graphs and enlargements were used later for field check- ing and for comparisons with other remote sensing tech- niques (including NASA Landsat colour infrared under- flight imagery), and for preparation of the interview phase</page><page sequence="8">20 / MOUNTAIN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT of the study. In addition, small map areas were transferred to the conventional 1:24,000 U.S. Geological Survey topo- graphic sheets and to the final 1:50,000 scale topographic map base to provide an impression of the final appearance, cartographic and scale limitations. EXAMINATION OF THE PRELIMINARY INVENTORY AND ITS DIRECT APPLICATION The main purpose of the preliminary inventory and legend was to facilitate completion of an exhaustive visual landscape register in map form and to provide a base for evaluation of the landscape units. The preliminary map (which has not been published) and its legend proved ex- tremely valuable during the public surveys. They enabled the formulation of questions about the visual resource, and people's perceptions of it. The map or the legend could be used on their own or together and in conjunction with photographs. The mapping process itself was also an important edu- cational experience for the author. From this the author was on at least the same level of experience as the person being interviewed. Thus, it facilitated the understanding of interviewees who had inadequate high country exper- ience and yet tried to describe their perceptions of it. Any researcher, beginning immediately with a survey of people's perception of landscape, is more susceptible to biased infor- mation than one who first undertakes a landscape inventory (Baumgartner, 1980, 1982). One of the early applications of the inventory involved collaboration with the Rocky Mountain National Park Boundary Study team. This was a joint National Park Service-U.S. Forest Service study team that had the task of preparing a basis for consideration of possible boundary revisions for the Park. Such could include, all, or part, of the Indian Peaks Wilderness and adjacent areas. The result of this work was a display of boundary adjustment alternatives, but not a recommendation of preferred boundaries. Rec- ommendations were made and justified as part of a separate process (Rocky Mountain National Park Boundary Study, 1979). The map of Landscape Types, which accompanied the chapter on Physiography in the study team's final report (Baumgartner, 1979b), was based on a summary of the pre- liminary landscape inventory. These data, and others pro- vided by all members of the Indian Peaks Environmental Atlas group, strongly reinforced identification of improved boundaries for the Wilderness Area. The changes, although minor in terms of area, have greatly facilitated boundary recognition by the public and by federal agency manage- ment personnel. VISUAL LANDSCAPE EVALUATION This part of the survey can be divided into two steps. First, the preliminary inventory required field checking and completion with the addition of ecological data. It was also necessary to compile representative landscape photographs as a basis for the following interview process. Second, a user survey (interview process) was needed to generate visi- tor response information to the landscape and its elements as depicted on the inventory. At the beginning of this stage of the survey the area's visual content was known, but no functional interrelation- ships had been determined, no data had been "checked" by the actual user, nor was it yet possible to evaluate the relative significance of the different landscape factors. In other words, the aesthetic quality of either individual land- scape units or the entire region could not yet be analysed. DATA CONTROL AND COMPLETION IN THE FIELD; LANDSCAPE PHOTOGRAPHS The preliminary landscape inventory mapped on 1:24,000 orthophotographs and air photograph enlarge- ments was field-checked during the summer of 1979. This process was intended to adjust systematic mistakes, incor- rect unit delineations, and inaccurate or incomplete legend descriptions. In addition, indicators of ecological stability or instability, such as wind-deformed trees in the forest- alpine tundra ecotone (Holtmeier, 1978; Hansen-Bristow, 1980), or beetle-killed areas in open conifer forest, were recorded for each landscape unit (see "Ecological Stability" on fold-in map and legend). This ecological data gather- ing was undertaken from a genetic/historical point of view so that areas especially sensitive to human impact that are moreover visually attractive could be emphasized in the compilation of the final map. Questions about visual sta- bility (harmony problems) were taken up as part of the inter- view process (second step in this part of the survey). During this fieldwork a series of representative photo- graphs was taken for use in the interview process. It was found that photographs taken from a low-flying aircraft, or from good terrestrial viewpoints, were of great assistance in pin-pointing specific localities that the interviewee re- lated to in terms of his statements about people's landscape experience. INTERVIEWS: LANDSCAPE PERCEPTION AND ASSESSMENT Interviews are usually directed to ascertain the motiva- tion of different groups of visitors and to assess their opinions about certain objects or events. In the Indian Peaks survey responses to the mountain scenery and land- scape elements were generated. These responses had to be related to the impressions visitors gained from the actual natural, and man-influenced environment. Direction of the planner's and manager's attention to those factors which are highlighted as most important to classify the region as an estimable living or recreation area, was the main pur- pose of this survey (Baumgartner, 1980). Results derived from this process were later incorporated into the final visual landscape legend. The experience values appended primarily to the dominent landscape types (see "Potential for Recreational Experience" on the fold-in map and legend) were produced in this manner. In prac- tice a summarizing interview system was developed. This involved interviewing not randomly selected visitors but</page><page sequence="9">R. BAUMGARTNER / 21 people who were aware of the experiences, landscape per- ceptions, and behaviour of others. Thus those selected for interviews were people who had visited the area over many years, U.S. Forest Service managers, inhabitants of the immediate area, and university students who had been in- volved in field research for at least one full summer. The interview approach was open-ended to ensure the acquisition of all possible visual impressions that individuals likely gain from the mountain environment. The person interviewed has repeatedly been asked to relate the exper- iences of others he had met in the field. A set of landscape photographs was presented to every interviewee systemati- cally. If the interview process evolved spontaneously no further formal questions were proposed. If, however, spon- taneity was absent, the person interviewed was assisted with a structured questionnaire. The interview form (checklist and form for the inter- viewer) included groups of questions relating to: category of visitor; preferred activities; type of scenic quality pre- ferred; importance of foreground versus background; views on environmental impairment; management; and others. The approach was designed to provoke positive responses as well as responses to observable environmental deteriora- tion of, or within, specific visual landscape units. Ques- tions on these topics were intended to probe individuals' perceptions of damage to an area (Ketchin, 1980), and to determine which elements or entire visual landscape units were regarded as fragile from the visitor's point of view. In addition, all landscape units were evaluated both as having an importance of their own as well as providing vistas onto other units. The importance of a unit was also assessed for its visual value as seen from a distance. Because an individual's response to landscape will always be coloured by his experience six different user categories were established: car drivers and passengers; car plus short walks; long hikes but no overnight stay in remote areas; remote camping without long hikes; remote camping with long hikes. These user categories were derived from the studies of Brown, Haas, and Manfredo (1977). There was no initial determination of the total number of interviews to be conducted. First it was decided to com- pare answers provided by the early contacts and to see how much data each person could provide about the different user categories. From this approach a total of 36 interviews were finally completed. Each interview took about two hours. Each person interviewed was able to draw on the experiences of twelve or more others; thus the sum of all interviews provided a composite experience from about 400 people. Every interview form was checked immediately follow- ing the interview and a short report was prepared for each. Finally a summarizing form was compiled for each land- scape picture (unit). The whole process provided detailed information on each landscape unit and on the relative im- portance of the different landscape elements in terms of their value for recreation use. Data were extracted from this for: (1) unit delineation control; (2) user-oriented formal description of the legend units; and (3) description of unit potential for individual recreational experience. This approach provides insights into wilderness area user motivation and demands from the visual point of view. Mo- tivation research justifies, modifies, or changes the selec- tion and descriptions of dominant landscape units in the final map. It also reinforces the identification of areas and elements that are especially sensitive, and those which must be protected if the scenic values of the mountain landscape are to be preserved in unmodified form. It is stipulated that a vigilant and sensitive management response to preserva- tion is the only way in which high value classification of the region will be retained into the future (Baumgartner, 1982). THE VISUAL LANDSCAPE MAP Using visual landscape data from different sources a con- clusive legend was compiled after nearly two years of experimentation, data collection, and preliminary map- ping. The final mapping procedure was based on the fol- lowing materials: - the preliminary legend (combined dominant landscape types, Step III, page 19) -the preliminary landscape inventory on the 1:24,000 scale orthophotographs and photographic enlargements, including corrections made later in the field -ecological stability data (visually relevant "damage") -main landscape type photographs -visitor perception-oriented interview data. In order to ensure uniform final mapping a sophisticated legend description was needed and, because the field of research is relatively new, it was decided to give extensive explanations on the actual map. The final legend is divided into three main sections: "Above Timberline", "Below Timberline", and "General Features." Above timberline rockwalls and glacially moulded terrain, bare ground, and debris on the one hand, and mainly quite sparse alpine tundra vegetation on the other, characterize the visual landscape of the high alpine and the alpine systems. Below timberline, however, forest (or its absence in places), forest density, and species com- position, are the dominant shaping factors. For a better visual separation on the map (together with ecological rea- sons, below) the upper boundary of the closed forest has been emphasized. The "General Features" include this transition area as an additional map unit as well as other linear and point features which occur above and below timberline, such as roads and trails, the Continental Divide, and anthropomorphic features. Many different environmental factors influence the visual appearance of a specific landscape. Using a matrix system (Step III, above) and with the help of compiled interview data, however, it was possible to designate uniform dominant landscape units. Most of the units from the preliminary landscape inventory (not the actual descriptions) were used directly on the final map. Some needed to be adjusted while others could be combined. A system of symbols was developed so that the final map</page><page sequence="10">22 / MOUNTAIN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT could contain a maximum amount of information while it retained an acceptable level of readability. Some of these symbols had been introduced during the preliminary in- ventory phase. They appear on the legend as "Site Details" to the right of the column giving the "Dominant Landscape Types". They have three functions: 1. to display a "mixture" of two landscape aspects; the one shown as a colour is the dominant type, while the symbol indicates a less important but still criti- cal site detail; 2. to indicate a small area Within a mapping unit that is different from its surroundings but too small to be differentiated by a colour; 3. to provide additional and specific information about a mapping unit. For example, unit number 10 is used for forest meadows/clearings: if the meadow or clearing is located in a depression and is there- fore wet, symbol n is applied. Or: symbol b is used to show residually weathered bedrock, usually on unit 1 or 5. With some symbols density of site details are indicated. During final cartography it was decided to print symbols in black (general), blue (hydrography), and red (anthropo- morphic or endangered) to ensure better separation and legibility on the map. Each dominant landscape type is additionally character- ized by three sections of legend text (also printed in three colours). The formal, descriptive part, printed in black, is based mainly on the preliminary legend, considering the different fields of research. In addition some interview data have been used here. This first block of text describes the appearance of the dominant landscape type from the visi- tor's point of view (without experience potential). The sec- ond text block, printed in blue, gives for each mapping unit some information about ecological stability. These data, that have been collected during fieldwork and interviewing or during other discussions, do not represent a full eco- logical report, but register visual damage caused by certain growth conditions or human impact. The final block, printed in red, indicates the main landscape experience based on the visual landscape interviews. Direct comparison of"Eco- logical Stability" and "Landscape Experience" enables the reader of the legend to trace immediately areas where con- flicts between the natural resources and human activity are likely to arise. For the "Site Details" ecological stability as well as landscape experience have only been mentioned if they differ from the dominant landscape type unit (or do not exist there). For the final mapping procedure, data were first trans- ferred onto 1:24,000 U.S. Geological Survey topographic sheets and then reduced to a 1:50,000 contour base that has itself been reduced and redrawn in metric (50 metres contour interval) from the 1:24,000 scale. Two manuscript originals have been produced for the cartographic compila- tion: one with all dominant landscape type units delineated and numbered, and the other with all symbols delineated and indicated by letters. Cartography was initially carried out by Vicki Dow (University of Colorado, Boulder) and then completed and corrected for printing by Andreas Brodbeck (Geographical sion was the final colour choice. There were different cri- teria to be taken into consideration. First, the colours have to characterize the mountain landscape in summer. This can be achieved by choosing: - a hypsographic colour scheme, showing the relief, espe- cially the differences in elevation -a colour combination taking the geomorphic appearance of the surface into consideration -a colour scheme based on the differences of vegetation (relatively dark forest, green meadows, yellow aspen, yellowish or red tundra). In the final map all three modes have been applied. Below timberline colours have been chosen merely in accordance with the appearance of the vegetation (the unit descrip- tions at this elevation give very little geomorphic indica- tions-see matrix system). Above timberline an attempt was made to capture the overall visual expression of a land- scape unit which for the high alpine areas is purely geo- morphic, and for the alpine is a mixture of vegetation and bare soil. In addition an attempt was made to convey ele- vational information of the study area by choosing differ- ent shades of colour intensity and darkness. During final preparation for printing the possibility of underlaying the Visual Landscape Map with a faint shaded relief tone was discussed extensively. This could have been accomplished through use of the existing Shaded Relief Map data (Ives and Dow, 1982). Despite a rather positive reaction from the printers it was decided not to attempt this. This decision related in part to concern for achieving uniformity of presentation within the Environmental Atlas as a whole and in part to the considerable complexity of the Visual Landscape Map itself- the prospect that a posi- tive decision could lead to an unacceptable degree of illegi- bility. In any event the two maps should be studied together. The problem of displaying the forest-alpine tundra eco- tone (fte) also required special attention. This elevational and climatic belt east and west of the Continental Divide should be represented ideally as a uniform and highly important landscape unit. The ecotone virtually contours all the major ridges and crosses the major valley floors. The interviews brought out clearly that around the major ridges it is perceived as a transition between closed forest and alpine meadow. Here it is assessed as a dominant land- scape type. Where it traverses the floors of the major val- leys, however, it is perceived as subordinate to the geo- morphic form-the glacially moulded U-shaped valley. In this setting the valley form becomes the dominant land- scape type and the scattered, partly wind-deformed, trees are perceived as site details. Here, therefore, the forest- alpine tundra ecotone is subordinated to the "Glacially Moulded Terrain." An attempt to preserve a sense of con- tinuity for this major vegetational transition has been made by superimposing a screen of red dots over the entire eco- tonal belt. Red was chosen to indicate ecological instability throughout this belt in part resulting from a combination of visual attractiveness and heavy recreational impact in certain places (Figure 6 and fold-in map).

The forest-alpine tundra eco- tone: the combination of information of visual landscape, ecological stability, and visitor perception and assessment data is clearly displayed on the Visual Landscape map; visual landscape units (in colour) and site details (symbols), as well as a specific red dot screen, have been used for the forest-alpine tundra ecotone to emphasize the ecological sen- sitivity in addition to its diverse scenic attraction. CONCLUSION The conception and completion of the Indian Peaks Visual Landscape study, and especially the compilation and printing of the final map, has required four years. During this time use of the Indian Peaks Wilderness Area has con- tinued to increase and impairment of several critical areas has accelerated. With the designation of the Indian Peaks Wilderness in 1978 it was believed that a respite had been won, or even that the area had been "protected" from ser- ious damage by the exclusion of many forms of use. Exper- ience has shown that increased non-mechanized use, per- haps encouraged by the very designation of wilderness, in the course of a few years, can significantly reduce the qual- ity of the landscape. This can proceed to such an extent that large parts of it could fail to qualify for retained wilder- ness status unless corrective measures were taken. The newly established (January 1982) Indian Peaks Wilderness Area Working Group, in close collaboration with the U.S. Forest Service, has begun work on this problem. It is be- lieved that the Visual Landscape Map, as well as other components of the Environmental Atlas, will provide a vital tool in this process. It is also believed that the collective experience derived from this specific undertaking in one mountain area will be readily applicable to others.
