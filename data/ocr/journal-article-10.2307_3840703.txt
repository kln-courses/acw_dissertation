<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Normal and the Pathological in Bergson David Lapoujade I would like to talk about the normal and the pathological in the work of Henri Bergson, but from a particular point of view. Readers of Bergson are familiar with a notion that appears in Matter and Memory and that then returns in a number of different articles. It is the notion of "attention to life" [attention a la vie]. It first appears in the third chapter of Matter and Memory, then in Laughter (1900), then in the texts about dreaming (1901), and, in reference to false recognition in "La fausse reconnaissance" (1908), in "L'ame et le corps" (1912), and in "Les fant6mes de vivants" (1913). We find this notion in every important text of Bergson. But, most importantly, in the foreword of Matter and Memory in 1911, Bergson insists on this concept and declares: ". . . notre vie psychologique peut se jouer a des hauteures differentes .... selon le degre de notre attention a la vie. La est une des idees directrices du present ouvrage, celle m&amp;me qui a servi de point de depart a notre travail."1 One can understand why this concept is so important for Bergson. He first uses it to give an account of our constant strain of adjustment, whether conscious or uncon- scious, to real situations. Attention to life is the operation through which we adapt ourselves to the exigencies of the outer world, through a kind of equilibrium. This is why Bergson can say that "attention to life" is the "sense of the real" [sens du reel]. But, above all, with this concept, one can draw a line in Bergson between the normal and the pathological that crosses the divide between the real and the unreal (dreams, deliriums, etc.). This explains why the concept is so important in those texts. MLN 120 (2005): 1146-1155 ? 2006 by TheJohns Hopkins University Press</page><page sequence="2">M L N This is, however, not precisely the notion I want to talk about, but rather a similar notion, and one that, at first sight, some commentar- ies have considered to be synonymous with "attention to life." It is a concept that appears only in The Two Sources of Morality and Religion: the concept of "attachment to life." One can even suppose that "attachment to life" plays as central a role in The Two Sources as "attention to life" does in Matter and Memory. One might even go so far as to say that the main problem of The Two Sources, the very core of the book, is the question of attachment to life. Why and how are we attached to life? Why can we not find any specific analysis of this notion? I think that this is primarily due to the fact that one only considers it as an extension, or a variation, of the concept of "attention to life." Yet is it not describing a new type of equilibrium, a new kind of vitality, and, therefore, a new type of pathology? What I would like to understand, then, is precisely how the passage from "attention" to "attachment" is the sign of a major shift in Bergson's thought, because it is obvious that such a shift implies that the boundary between the normal and the pathological (but also be- tween the real and the unreal) has been displaced. What I will try to understand is the reason for this transformation. So, if I consider the relation between the normal and the pathological, it is only from the perspective of this passage from attention to attachment. How does Bergson define "attention to life"? It is not a psychological attention, but a biological attention, which belongs to the human species. Generally speaking, one can define it as an encroachment of the present onto the future, essentially as an adaptive capacity of anticipation. "Attention to life" defines the situation of a balanced life [vie equilibree]. It is from the body-from the brain-that the intelli- gence receives the weight or ballast of its equilibrium and its capacity to adjust to the requirements of the material (or social) world. It is through the brain that the solidarity between our psychological life and our motor activity is established and maintained. More specifi- cally, "attention to life" requires a double movement of call and response: "D'un c6ot, l'etat sensori-moteur . . . oriente la memoire, dont il n'est au fond, que l'extr6mit6 actuelle et active; d'autre part cette memoire elle-meme, avec la totalite de notre passe, exerce une pouss6e en avant pour inserer dans l'action presente la plus grande partie d'elle-meme."2 The call comes from the present, from the present of our body. And this present calls out to a definite past, which is able to illuminate this very present. The response comes 1147</page><page sequence="3">DAVID LAPOUJADE from our memory, which, on its side, is always expecting the present to insert in it the biggest part of itself. What defines the encroach- ment mentioned earlier, or the intellectual equilibrium, is the accu- racy of the adjustment between the call and the response. There is a constant tension in us that provokes our interest in the outer world, and that forces us to answer its unceasing orders. It is as if the outer world (social, material) were constantly asking us: what is to be done now? Our intellectual equilibrium is entirely based on the structure of those sensori-motor apparati in so far as they "fix" our mind and force it to take interest in external life. This is why Bergson defines "attention to life" in terms of a "sense of reality." Inversely, any reduction of this tension will lose contact with reality, taking no further interest in life: "Relachez cette tension ou rompez cet 6quilibre: tout se passera comme si l'attention se d6tachait de la vie."3 It is from this point of view that Bergson describes the activity of dreaming. Moreover, Bergson sees in the loosening (or reduced tension) of dreaming an imitation of all mental pathologies: ". .. le reve imite de tout point l'alienation . . . tous les sympt6mes psychologiques de la folie se retrouvent dans le reve."4 Mental pathologies are defined, as in Janet, by a loss of the "sense of reality," as is the case in psychosis (I will not go into further analysis here concerning the distinction between mechanical and dynamic dis- eases). On this level, the pathological standard is psychosis, consid- ered as a loss of contact with reality. And what is opposed to psychosis is common sense [bon sens]-normality or the intellectual equilib- rium of common sense. With this explanation, Bergson offers a general framework that allows us to think relations between the normal and the pathological. The normal is the set of pathologies prevented, warded off, or counterbalanced by the bodily sensori- motor adaptation to the world. So it is to a large extent the body-as a system of habits-that prevents the danger of the mind going into a psychotic delirium. On this level, the normal is only the prevention of the pathological. What happens when Bergson introduces "attachment to life"? In order to live, adaptation is not enough; one needs to be "attached" to one's own life. Life has to give us a means to be attached to it. This means that the possibility does exist that man can be detached from life and not be interested in it anymore. One can understand how different the situation is now, especially if we remember that the notion of "attachment" is actually inseparable from what Bergson 1148</page><page sequence="4">M L N calls the "myth-making function." As a matter of fact, Bergson says: "La religion statique attache l'homme a la vie, et par consequent l'individu a la soci6te, en lui racontant des histoires comparables a celles dont on berce les enfants."5 What attaches us to life is our deliria [delires]. In order to live, we must render the world delirious [delirer le monde], project in it invisible and active powers, in short, invent religions [fabuler des religions]. On the one hand, attention to life prevents psychotic deliria; on the other, attachment to life makes them indispensable. The two claims are equally vital for man to be able to act in the outside world. But the point of view is now inverted. While, in the first case, the "sense of reality" was a way to prevent mental disequilibrium, in the second case, it is the representation of the real that provokes a vital disequilibrium. In other words, what is now pathological is not the loss of reality, but reality itself, when it becomes the only horizon. It is as if the "myth-making function" were a "sense of unreality" that counterbalances the excess of reality to which intelligence drives us. In other words, what is pathological now is what was defining the normal a moment ago: "the sense of reality" or adaptation. The pathology is no longer based on the standard of psychosis, but of neurosis. And if psychosis belongs to the psychiatric field (where one studies the psychotic process in individuals), neuro- sis, on the contrary, belongs to the field of morality and religion (and then one studies neurosis as a sickness of all mankind). So, what happens? Intelligence can detach us from life, not as sleep does, but rather as depression does. In The Two Sources, intelligence is defined less by its power of making than by its power of depressing. It possesses a depressive, discouraging, dissolving power. It disconnects us from others, from our vital impulses, from our power to act. Through its representations, intelligence "ralentit chez l'homme, le mouvement de la vie."6 Of course, Bergson is not talking about an individual or personal depression but about a biological depression that, like attention to life, concerns all mankind. It is not only that mankind has lost its instincts, but also that its representations of reality, as such, depress it. There is a kind of deficiency of vitality. What Bergson discovers is that man is a sick species. No equilibrium is destroyed, no will is suspended, no interest is lost. On the contrary, we can be very interested in ourselves: "La v6rit6 est que l'intelligence conseillera d'abord l'Fgoisme."7 The depression is located on another level. What is so depressing about the representation of reality? What is it that can be too much in reality if not reality itself? It is the thinking of an order that excludes us or contests the place that we 1149</page><page sequence="5">DAVID LAPOUJADE occupy: the inevitability of death, the unexpected, which undoes our projects. From this point of view, the highest form of intelligence would be the conception of determinism: a world in which no particular place could be said to belong to us. This is the first part of the neurosis. In other words, what becomes pathological now is the representation of reality as such (that very representation that was preventing pathologies in the intellectual equilibrium). Bergson's general question can be posed in the following way: what attaches individuals to their own life, since intelligence and memory or common sense cannot do it? One knows the solution for this depression, for this neurosis inherent to mankind. Under pressure of a virtual instinct, man starts to invent stories [fabuler]; but he doesn't make up stories just for fun-he invents stories in order to believe them. And to believe means to take them as real. In other words, one invents stories inasmuch as the stories can be regarded as perfectly real. They must have the same sensori-motor efficacy as the represen- tations of reality provided by our knowledge; otherwise, we remain on the level of mere conviction or opinion. It is only if man injects elements of personality into the real world, virtual presences on the basis of which he acts, that man can be attached to life. One can believe anything (and actually we do believe anything when we consider the absurdities of religions in History, says Bergson) as long as we go on believing. According to this general description, the first form of equilibrium is not in the least threatened. Religion or, if one prefers, the act of believing, is what helps man face reality, and withstand the excess of reality that pure intelligence would otherwise impose on us. Belief-the act of belief, of holding fictions as real-is a vital act. Besides attachment to life, what is its vital function? Nous devons toujours nous dire que le domaine de la vie est essentiellement celui de l'instinct, que sur une certaine ligne d'evolution, l'instinct a c6ed une partie de sa place a l'intelligence, qu'une perturbation de la vie peut s'ensuivre et que la nature n'a d'autre ressource alors que d'opposer l'intelligence a l'intelligence. La representation intellectuelle qui retablit l'equilibre est d'ordre religieux.8 Bergson goes on: "Nous posons une certaine activit6 instinctive; faisant surgir alors l'intelligence, nous cherchons si une perturbation dangereuse s'ensuit; dans ce cas, l'6quilibre sera vraisemblablement retabli par des representations que l'instinct suscitera au sein de l'intelligence perturbatrice: si de telles representations existent, ce 1150</page><page sequence="6">M L N sont des idees religieuses 6elmentaires."9 What is properly vital in belief (that is to say: the interpolation of an imaginary representation in a chain of "real" representations), is the restoration of an equilib- rium that is not intellectual, but natural. In other words, the general structure is totally different from the structure of "attention to life." On the one hand, intellectual equilibrium is produced by preventing deliria [delires]; on the other, natural equilibrium is produced by introducing deliria inside the intellectual plane to prevent a vital deficiency (or its threat). On one hand, it is the vital deficiency that threatens intelligence; on the other hand, it is the excess of intelli- gence that threatens the vital impulse. How, then, can we define this attachment to life? Bergson writes: "La religion est ce qui doit combler chez les etres dou6s de r6flexion, un d6ficit eventuel de l'attachement a la vie.... La religion statique attache l'homme a la vie, et par cons6quent l'individu a la socite6, en lui racontant des histoires comparables a celles dont on berce les enfants."'0 The question then becomes: how do those fictions [fabulations] attach us to life? We cannot be satisfied with an answer that would say: they give us hope, release our pain, etc., because such answers beg the question. Bergson first shows that fictions are projections. We project, behind the natural phenomena, meaningful intentions or purposes. In other words, we constitute a universe of human significations. Intelligence, Bergson says, under the pressure of instinct, gives a unity or an individuality to events that makes them human.1" One goes as far as one can with knowledge or with technics, but this knowledge is supplemented by our projections which give us confidence: "l'archer tend son arc et vise; mais sa pensee va plut6t a la cause extra- mecanique qui doit conduire la fliche ou il faut, parce que sa croyance en elle lui donnera ... la confiance en soi qui permet de mieux viser."'2 As this myth-making function develops, the elements of personality unfold proportionally, and form an entity (for ex- ample, the "spirits") that goes on to achieve divinity. There is only a difference in degree between the player who believes in his "luck" and the priest who lives according to the holy texts. This is a classical feature of religion: the myth-making function is anthropomorphic, but this statement is not made from a critical point of view since it is about grounding the religious in the vital (and considering the loss of religion as a depression of the vital impulse). There is, however, another aspect, one less visible perhaps, but also quite important. Bergson says that religion gives confidence, confidence 1151</page><page sequence="7">DAVID LAPOUJADE in oneself, confidence in the external world. We do believe in order to be confident. And confidence is synonymous with attachment to life. Lack of confidence comes from intelligent knowledge, knowl- edge of a possible order that threatens my existence. I know myself as a "lack of power." And, as Bergson says, "a defaut de puissance, nous avons besoin de confiance."13 How does man regain (or recreate) this confidence by projecting entities or personalities into the external world? It is because those projections give him a place: he is now observed, helped, involved; in short, he is acknowledged as occupying a place in the world. Why a place? This is because pure intelligence involves thinking the world with an order that excludes us. We just occupy a neutral, insignificant place among other places inside a world with necessary laws, blind to our destiny. What our beliefs give us is a privileged place. And what is a privileged place? It is the central one, the very center. Belief puts us in the very center of the world because the forces of the universe organize themselves for us. One passes from anthropomorphism to anthropocentrism. Here is the Bergson's description: Considerons, en effet, un animal autre que 1'homme. Il use de tout ce qui peut le servir. Croit-il precis6ment que le monde soit fait pour lui? Non, sans doute, car il ne se repr6sente pas le monde, et n'a d'ailleurs aucune envie de sp6culer. Mais ... il se comporte evidemment comme si tout etait combine dans la nature en vue de son bien et dans l'interet de son esp&amp;ce. Telle est sa conviction v6cue; elle le soutient, elle se confond avec son effort pour vivre. Faites maintenant surgir la reflexion: cette conviction vecue; elle le soutient, elle se confond avec son effort pour vivre. Faites maintenant surgir la r6flexion: cette conviction s'evanouira; l'homme va se percevoir et se penser comme un point dans l'immensite de l'univers. I1 se sentirait perdu, si l'effort pour vivre ne projetait aussit6t dans son intelligence, a la place meme que cette perception et cette pensee allaient prendre, l'image antagoniste d'une conversion des choses et des evenements vers l'homme : bienveillante ou malveillante, une intention de l'entourage le suit partout, comme la lune parait courir avec lui quand il court.'4 In other words, confidence here is the intellectual feeling through which the world reflects for man a central place, through which, says Bergson, he is taken into consideration. This is a kind of childish or neurotic confidence. So we can see here what defines the humanity of man. Man does not escape from his intelligence, does not leap beyond himself to reach an overhumanity. He does not leave his intelligence behind, it is rather that his vital instinct inserts itself into intelligence and 1152</page><page sequence="8">M L N interpolates its fictions into it. On the contrary, humanity expands, since it is projected all around man and reflected by him in his religions. It is like a sphere or a bubble of humanity. These are the closed societies. Bergson says that we cannot escape such enclosure, man's turning in on himself, in the same way that we escape from the depressive power of pure intelligence. With static religion, one does not escape from the sickness of mankind-one only makes it livable. This is because the means to get rid of the sickness still belong to the sphere of sickness. And, for Bergson as for Nietzsche, the real sickness is not to be sick, it is when the means of getting out of it still belong to it. This is the case for religion. It protects us from the representa- tions of pure intelligence but remains inside the closed society or neurosis. To be really free, one should escape from intelligence, that is to say, leap over our neurotic and childish humanity, to reach a kind of overhumanity. This means introducing a new kind of confidence, a new kind of attachment to life, in short: a new kind of health. This is what happens with mysticism, when Bergson says that mysticism aims at a more than human man. This is what Bergson says: ... pourquoi, des lors, l'homme ne retrouverait-il pas la confiance qui lui manque [because he looks for it outside of himself] ou que la reflexion a pu ebranler, en remontant, pour reprendre de l'elan, dans la direction oiu l'lan etait venu? Ce n'est pas par l'intelligence, ou en tous cas avec l'intelligence seule, qu'il pourrait le faire .... Son attachement a la vie serait d6sormais ... joie dans lajoie, amour de ce qui n'est qu'amour.... La confiance que la religion statique apportait a l'homme s'en trouverait transfiguree.... C'est maintenant d'un detachement de chaque chose que serait fait l'attachement a la vie.l5 In other words, attachment to life (confidence) has changed its nature with the leap out of intelligence. This leap is actually a conversion. But this remains very abstract if one doesn't describe the actual process by which the leap is performed. What is this leap? What is this new kind of confidence or attachment to life that Bergson calls a transfigured confidence? Bergson insists again on the question of the normal and the pathological (discussing at the same time with Janet) in connection with the mystic ecstasy. He says that there is something abnormal (but not pathological) in this process. I will quote the entire passage here, for it is essential: La verite est que ces etats anormaux, leur ressemblance et parfois sans doute aussi leur participation a des 6tats morbides, se comprendront sans 1153</page><page sequence="9">DAVID LAPOUJADE peine si l'on pense au bouleversement qu'est le passage du statique au dynamique, du clos a l'ouvert, de la vie habituelle a la vie mystique. Quand les profondeurs obscures de l'ame sont remuees, ce qui monte t la surface et arrive a la conscience y prend, si l'intensit6 est suffisante, la forme d'une image ou d'une emotion ... L'une et l'autre peuvent exprimer que le bouleversement est un rearrangement systematique en vue d'un equilibre superieur.... Ebranlee dans ses profondeurs par le courant qui l'entrainera, l'ame ne cesse de tourner sur elle-meme . . ., elle s'arrete, comme si elle 6coutait une voix qui l'appelle. Puis, elle se laisse porter, droit en avant.16 Bergson is rather allusive here. He refers to a new kind of equilib- rium. The balance is not intellectual (as in attention to life); it is neither natural (as in the case of attachment to life in its first form), it is vital. Only the mystical plane of life reaches the vital equilibrium. What is going to define this new kind of equilibrium? It is as if there were a moment when, as Bergson puts it, the relations between the conscious and the unconscious are disturbed. It is because we are passing from the superficial self to the profound self, a distinction made in Time and Free Will. It is about giving up the first self, giving up the social self, the mastery of intelligence (adaptation), to religious projections that used to help us to live. We have to give up the mastery of this self (still playing and dreaming of omnipotence). This is because, as Bergson puts it, the system is changing (there is a systematic rearrangement). We cast off the self that relied on the calls or appeals of the body (or of social, the material situations) to which memory answered. We remember that was the system of action that described attention to life. What's going on then? A reversal of this entire system: it is now the memory (or the spirit) that calls from the depth of itself (and becomes active when the sensibility allows). This is creative emotion, generatrice de pensee, says Bergson. Now, it is the depth of our past that operates in the manner of a vocation, passing completely into action, as a function of its own requirements and no longer because of material or social requirements; it is the moment when one can say: I was made for this, this very future. The present becomes a bridge between our deepest past and our most personal future. Life has totally changed: we do not construct ourselves according to the calls of the present; it is rather the present that answers the calls of our past (what Bergson calls "the voice"). The system is totally reorganized. So we see what confidence is made of. The leaps indicate it. It consists precisely in not controlling anymore, not mastering any- more, but abandoning oneself to the necessity to create one's own 1154</page><page sequence="10">M L N past, the emotion that one carries within oneself, untouched, through the present. Confidence is now a self-abandonment considered as a vital flux. Here we see the emergence, in Bergson, of the theme that states that what we have to escape from is the constitutive neurosis of the human milieu, and we can succeed in doing this by a kind of psychotic moment, something schizophrenic let us say, which gives access to a greater health and a "superior equilibrium." It is no longer individual pathologies that interest Bergson, but the universal neuro- sis of mankind from which few individuals escape in order to point the way to a new kind of health. It is not impossible that something of our modernity is at stake in this important shift, operated by Bergson, concerning the line that separates the normal from the pathological.
