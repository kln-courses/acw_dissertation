Several cave sites in the Ach Valley, such as Hohle Fels, Geißenklösterle, and Sirgenstein, and in the Lone Valley, such as Vogelherd, Hohlenstein-Stadel, and Bockstein-Törle, have yielded considerable stratigraphic sequences with both Middle and Upper Paleolithic deposits. While some of the Middle Paleolithic assemblages can be attributed to the Keilmessergruppe or Micoquian, most of them can only in general be classified as "Swabian Mousterian". The find density in most Middle Paleolithic sites of Swabia is low and indicates that Neandertals visited most caves only sporadically and for short stays. The Aurignacian of Swabia, which started fully developed more than 40,000 years ago, marks a clear break and a radical shift in material culture. A similar shift can be observed with regard to the occupation intensity, which increases strongly with the Aurignacian. New technologies and tool types, made of both lithic and organic raw materials, are characteristic for the Aurignacian assemblages, which are supposed to have been produced by anatomically modern humans. Of particular importance are a broad variety of personal ornaments carved from mammoth ivory, bone and ivory flutes, and, most spectacular, ivory figurines. With ages of down to 40,000 years, the art objects and the musical instruments from the Swabian Jura represent the oldest examples of their kinds known from the archaeological record and prove that the Swabian Jura was one key center of innovations in the early Upper Paleolithic.

This is in accordance with two models developed in THE SWABIAN MIDDLE PALEOLITHIC Tübingen in connection with the sites of the Swabian Jura: the Danube Corridor and Kulturpumpe models While Middle Paleolithic open-air sites are very rare (Conard 2002, Conard, Bolus 2003, Conard, Floss 2000). in the Swabian Jura (e.g., Börslingen: Floss et al. 2012, According to the former, anatomically modern humans see also Conard et al. 2012), several caves in both the rapidly entered the interior of Europe following the Ach and the Lone Valleys have yielded deposits with Danube Valley. The latter model presents competing Middle Paleolithic assemblages. Some of these, working hypotheses to explain the early advent of fully especially those from Bocksteinschmiede (Wetzel, modern behavior and the cultural innovations of the Bosinski 1969), can be attributed to the Aurignacian and Gravettian in the Swabian Jura.

Horse and reindeer were the most frequently hunted animal species. Woolly rhino is much less frequent but reaches higher percentages than in the Swabian Aurignacian. Cave bear is abundant in all Middle Paleolithic sites but although some cave bear bones show slight traces of anthropogenic modification, there is no clear indication that Neandertals hunted this animal (Conard, Münzel 2004, Conard et al. 2012, Kitagawa 2014, Krönneck 2012, Krönneck et al. 2004). The low find density in most Middle Paleolithic sites of Swabia indicates that Neandertals visited most caves only sporadically and for short stays. In contrast, the large number of cave bear bones shows that bears used the caves much more intensively than humans during the Middle Paleolithic (Conard et al. 2012). THE SWABIAN AURIGNACIAN The Swabian Jura is particularly well-known for its Aurignacian deposits, especially those from Geißenklösterle and Hohle Fels. Starting with the lowermost Aurignacian assemblages – Geißenklösterle AH III, Hohle Fels AH Vb, and Hohlenstein-Stadel AH A/1 – some 43–40,000 years ago, the material culture in Swabia changes dramatically. Abundant data from the Swabian sites show a wide spectrum of new artifact types, both lithic and organic, and a variety of personal ornaments as well as figurative art and musical instruments which are totally lacking in the local Middle Paleolithic assemblages (Conard, Bolus 2006) (see Figure 10). Evidence from the basal Aurignacian of AH Vb at Hohle Fels demonstrates that the Swabian Aurignacian was fully developed from the beginning and contained the whole "package" of early Upper Paleolithic innovations including symbolic artifacts. The lithic technology of the Swabian Aurignacian is FIGURE 5.

While instruments. To date, four caves – Hohle Fels, considerable skill is required to make a flute from a bird Geißenklösterle, Vogelherd, and Hohlenstein-Stadel – have yielded about 50 art objects which, while often fragmentary, represent the most impressive examples for symbolic artifacts within the Swabian Aurignacian and which have ages between 40,000 and 30,000 years (Floss 2007, Hahn 1986, Riek 1934). In most cases, animals are depicted: mammoths (Figures 9:5, 10a), felines, horses (Figure 9:3), bisons (Figure 9:4) and other, less frequently depicted species including a bear, a waterbird (Figure 9:1), and a fish (Conard 2003b, 2009b). Regularly, the figurines bear symbolic signs, the meaning of which is unknown (see, e.g., Figure 9:2–5). A special group is represented by therianthropic figurines which combine human with animal features. Two of them, one from Hohlenstein-Stadel with a length of about 30 cm and one from Hohle Fels with a length of less than 3 cm, are referred to as Löwenmenschen (Lion men), since they show a combination of characteristics of lions and humans (Conard 2003b, Ebinger-Rist et al. 2013, Schebesch 2013). A third object, a small ivory plate from Geißenklösterle (Figure 9:2), bears the half-relief of a figure with uplifted arms which might also represent a Lion man (Hahn 1986, Schebesch 2013).
