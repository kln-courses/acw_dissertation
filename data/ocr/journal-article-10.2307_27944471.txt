<plain_text><page sequence="1">Whitehead the Naturalist1 David Emory Conner / Wheat Ridge Congregation, United Church of Christ reetings. It is good to see all of you on such an auspicious actual VJ occasion. I cannot help but view my assignment this evening as an honor, albeit a daunting one. When Jennifer Jesse invited me to speak, I reminded her that many other persons have more impressive credentials than I. She answered that she had heard me speak before and was confident that I would do an acceptable job. Then she added, "Besides, I won't be there." Fortified by such unambiguous words of encouragement, I now stand before you. I. The Continuing Need for Process Thought The topic at hand is one that many of you have already examined, but I hope to clothe it in more up-to-date, interesting, and, possibly, more revealing attire. In brief, I propose that Whitehead can be read more accurately and more convincingly not through a rationalistic lens but through an empirical one. When one does this, the Whitehead who materializes out of the philosophical mists manifests a type of naturalism that, I venture to say, many who are present this evening might find both more congenial and more useful, in contrast to the renditions of Whitehead one usually encounters. In a moment I will state more carefully what I mean by naturalism, but in the meantime I want to say that this more naturalistic interpretation of Whitehead is a significant reason why we need not be cringing in the corner and wringing our hands?although, of course, some of you might be throwing a party?just because some of the scholars we know and love have proclaimed that process thought is dead, or at least noticeably moribund.2 1 This article reproduces, with minor adaptations, the annual lecture sponsored by the American Journal of Theology and Philosophy, which I presented at the meeting of the American Academy of Religion in Chicago, Illinois, November 2, 2008. 2 For example, William Wainwright comments, "One thing which does seem to me dead, and this may be regrettable, is process philosophy." Richard Amesburg and William Wainwright, "Rethinking Philosophy of Religion: A Dialogue," American Journal of Theology and Philosophy, 28 (May 2007), 230.</page><page sequence="2">Vol. 30, No. 2, May 2009 169 The philosophical questions and issues that Whitehead addressed are not, as lately claimed, outdated or obsolete. If anything, they are resurgent. For example, in a recent issue of the Journal of the American Academy of Religion, Edward Slingerland argues refreshingly that the intellectual consequences of postmodernism have been overstated and that our real contacts with the physical world can provide us with "a stable body of shared knowledge, verified by proofs based upon common perceptual access."3 This moves us in the direction of at least provisionally restoring respectability and usefulness to theories of reality, a.k.a. metaphysics.4 But unfortunately, in my view, Slingerland jumps abruptly to a na?ve endorsement of a purely deterministic, mechanistic physicalism. In his (freely formed?) opinion, human thoughts and emotions are mere brain states that are governed by "the deterministic laws that govern the interactions of physical objects."5 However odd, this thoroughly materialist view of the self must be grappled with because it is difficult to see what choice we have once we take the decisive step of giving up our belief in a Cartesian ghost in the machine?of believing, to put a finer point on it, in magic. . . . Unless we are to resort to metaphysical dualism, it is hard to see what "wants" or "beliefs" could be made of, if they are something other than particular states of neurons and other cells in our bodies.6 3 Edward Slingerland, "Who's Afraid of Reductionism? The Study of Religion in the Age of Cognitive Science," Journal of the American Academy of Religion, 76, (June 2008): 376-78. 4 Certainly I am not claiming that postmodernism and post-structuralism have run their course. Postmodernism remains especially valuable as an exposure of the innate limitations of language?a point which Whitehead anticipated repeatedly?and, in the hands of critics such as Luce Irigaray and Michel Foucault, as a way of revealing the elements of chauvinism, oppression, and power-mongering that are typically concealed in ordinary discourse. On the other hand, when postmodernism is left unrestrained?as perhaps by its very nature it is required to be, for what external or foundational principle could restrain it??it leaves us, as Slingerland says, "incapable of extracting ourselves from the social constructivist quagmire, where the only standard for debate appears to be winning the title of more social-constructivist-than-thou." Ibid., 377. 5 Ibid., 383. 6 Ibid., 383, 390. Italics original. Slingerland's assumption that, in order to be real, desires and beliefs must be "made of some sort of "stuff (a word that he in fact uses</page><page sequence="3">170 American Journal of Theology &amp; Philosophy The most disappointing thing is that Slingerland seems to adopt this determinism for no other reason than that he lacks familiarity with most of the major efforts within the past hundred years (such as Whitehead's) to reconcile contemporary science with mentality and freedom. I cite Slingerland as but one example of the many philosophers who broach topics that happen to have been addressed in depth by process philosophy, but without paying the slightest attention to Bergson or Whitehead, or even to James and Dewey. This is a sad state of affairs, for if these scholars would analyze ideas such as Whitehead's and then reject them, at least their reasons for doing so might be interesting for the rest of us.7 No doubt there are numerous reasons for this type of neglect or disregard for Whitehead,8 but this evening we have time to consider only one. II. A Theological Twist on Whitehead's Philosophy It is this. For the past fifty years Whitehead's philosophy has been analyzed and promoted not by philosophers or scientists but primarily in seminaries and religion departments where, not surprisingly, a distinctly theological spin has become grafted on to the pertinent ideas. Moreover, the "process theology"9 that has emerged has in this context, 390) directly contradicts Whitehead's position: "The process is itself the actuality, and requires no antecedent static cabinet." Alfred North Whitehead, Adventures of Ideas (New York: The Macmillan Company, 1933), 356. I am not claiming that Slingerland is wrong simply because he disagrees with Whitehead, but that he appears not even to be aware of any metaphysical options other than Cartesian dualism and a reductionistic materialism. 7 Richard Rorty, for example, not only demonstrates that he has pondered Whitehead's ideas at length but provides a thought-provoking critique of Whitehead's position. See Rorty, "The Subjectivist Principle and the Linguistic Turn," in Alfred North Whitehead: Essays on His Philosophy, ed. George L. Kline (Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice-Hall, Inc., 1963), 134-57. 8 One wonders. Is it that many scholars are simply unacquainted with process philosophy? Do they dismiss Whitehead's ideas summarily after only a cursory examination? Has postmodernism created an intellectual climate in which it is safe? and certainly easier?just to ignore thinkers such as Whitehead? It is tempting to paraphrase Chesterton and say that Whitehead's philosophy has not been tried and found wanting so much as it has been found difficult, and then not tried. 9 In this paper I use several terms with deliberate imprecision. Process theology refers to theological work that cites Whitehead or Hartshorne as a major influence. Orthodox process theology suggests the work of scholars who have sought to treat Whitehead's neologisms as "stabilized technicalities" (Whitehead, Process and Reality: An Essay in</page><page sequence="4">Vol. 30, No. 2, May 2009 171 gradually taken the form of a series of relatively simplified theological claims, to wit: (1) the state of God's being is described not by timeless perfection but by processive, emergent relationality. (2) God relates to the world not in terms of a sovereign hegemony but through persuasive lures that, within limits, creatures are free to accept or reject. (3) Therefore the future is genuinely open, and God may not be blamed, as a classically omnipotent God might be, for naturally occurring evil or for the failures of human beings. (4) Besides, despite the harsh reality of evil and tragedy, it is comforting that the goodness in the world that can be salvaged is saved eternally in God's "consequent nature." (5) These notions may most aptly be summarized in the terms of a panentheism that holds that, though God is wholly immanent in the world, God's being somehow contains and surpasses the world, much as the selfhood of a human being is more than a mere assemblage of body parts. The outcome of all this is that, by affirming God's value producing function, God's persuasive nature, and the genuine freedom of God's creatures, process theology gives us a philosophical way of agreeing with the New Testament assertion that "God is love." In other words, though not usually stated quite so baldly, process theology is made to serve ultimately as a philosophical underpinning for the conventional theology of, say, Wesleyan Arminianism.10 I submit that when Whitehead's philosophy becomes best known for its association with strangely heart-warming ideas such as these, it is not surprising that process thought loses most of any credibility or appeal it might have had among those philosophers, cosmologists, and scientists who have little or no professional interest Cosmology, Corrected Edition, ed. David Ray Griffin and Donald W. Sherburne [New York: The Free Press, 1978], 4; hereafter PR), ironically recalling Whitehead's own statement that "a learned orthodoxy suppresses adventure" (Whitehead, Adventures of Ideas [New York, The Macmillan Company, 1933], 358; hereafter AI). Harsthornian process theology signifies theology that adopts Hartshorne's panentheism and its attendant doctrines. Conventional process theology entails the five theses I am about to list, and hints at the typical articulations of seminarians who have had a relatively brief introduction to the subject. These classifications of process theology overlap and are necessarily blurry and inexact. I find the forms of process theology just mentioned somewhat rationalistic, and they are to be contrasted to the empirical, naturalistic process theology that I outline in what follows. 10 See for example Majori? Suchocki, "Coming Home: Wesley, Whitehead, and Women," The Drew Gateway, 57, no. 3 (1987).</page><page sequence="5">172 American Journal of Theology &amp; Philosophy in religion. But this is not my main reason for critiquing orthodox process theology. My main criticism is that the familiar themes of process theology, as I have attempted to encapsulate them above, are insufficiently nuanced, too cut-and-dried, and are not even especially faithful to the Whiteheadian philosophy from which they claim to be drawn. A less personalistic and more naturalistic interpretation of Whitehead is needed. Parenthetically, allow me to explain that, as the holder of two degrees from the Iliff School of Theology, it is natural for me to take a naturalistic view of Whitehead. Though I did spend one year in the Ph.D. program at the Claremont Graduate School, where I deeply appreciated the teaching of John Cobb and David Griffin, I gained my basic approach to Whitehead from Harvey Potthoff and Charles Milligan at Iliff. Potthoff had studied at Harvard with Whitehead himself, and Milligan wrote, in the late 1940s, one of the first Harvard dissertations on Whitehead's philosophy. Potthoff and Milligan's approach to Whitehead was in striking contrast to the Whitehead one encountered in Claremont. I still remember the day when I tentatively said to Potthoff that I thought Whitehead's philosophy was really a form of naturalism, and Potthoff responded that he had said as much in a paper submitted to Whitehead himself. "What did Whitehead say about that?" I asked. Potthoff answered, "Basically he said, 'You got it right.'" But of course Potthoff and Milligan did not encounter Whitehead de novo, as philosophical novices. Prior to their experiences at Harvard, both Milligan and Potthoff had been formatively influenced by Iliff professor William Henry Bernhardt,11 himself a student of Shailer Matthews, Shirley Jackson Case, et al., and a vigorous proponent of his own type of Chicago-style empirical theology. Though Iliff was not nationally prominent during the years of Bernhardt, Potthoff, and Milligan, the school did have a significant influence in the Midwest and the West through the clergy it produced. At the risk of sounding self-serving or at least impertinent, I would like to observe that if there were no actual practitioners of religion, the teaching of religion in institutions of higher learning would quickly degenerate into nothing more than an anachronistic academic diversion. But I digress. 11 Bernhardt's Chicago Ph.D. was granted in 1928.</page><page sequence="6">Vol. 30, No. 2, May 2009 173 Obviously a more empirical, naturalistic approach to Whitehead is not peculiar to Iliff. There are numerous scholarly works in which Whitehead is considered empirically. One thinks especially, perhaps, of The Future of Empirical Theology edited by Bernard Meland,12 Meland's Fallible Forms and Symbols,13* Bernard Loomer's The Size of God,14 William Dean's American Religious Empiricism,15 and Nancy Frankenberry's Religion and Radical Empiricism.16 I am surely neglecting numerous authors and texts that many of you would want to add.17 However, one contribution that we should not overlook is a short but memorable article by Bernard Lee entitled simply, "The Two Process Theologies."18 In this article Lee posited a division between two camps of process theologians that he labeled "rational" and "empirical." To the rationalists, Lee attributed the following traits: (1) a driving passion for the structural elements of Whitehead's thought, applied to theological topics; (2) a certain optimism about the possibility of conceptualizing an accurate ontology; (3) a passion for clarity; (4) a sense of spirituality oriented to a quest for perfection; (5) great attention to the details of the process of concrescence; (6) a confidence that Whitehead's ideas provide an easier transition from traditional, orthodox theology to contemporary worldviews; and (7) a greater interest in the ultimate nature of things than in specific ethical concerns. In distinction, Lee described the empiricists as having: (1) a 12 Bernard Meland, editor, The Future of Empirical Theology (Chicago: The University of Chicago Press, 1969). 13 Bernard Meland, Fallible Forms and Symbols: Discourses of Method in a Theology of Culture (Philadelphia: Fortress Press, 1976). 14 Bernard Loomer, The Size of God, ed. William Dean and Larry Axel (Macon, G A: Mercer University Press, 1987). 15 William Dean, American Religious Empiricism (Albany: State University of New York Press, 1986). 16 Nancy Frankenberry, Religion and Radical Empiricism (Albany: State University of New York Press, 1987). 17 I am tempted to add to this list Jerome Stone's The Minimalist Vision of Transcendence: A Naturalist Philosophy of Religion (Albany: State University of New York Press, 1992), but have not done so because Stone seems to find no similarity between his idea of God and Whitehead's. "It will be obvious that the minimalist approach departs totally from Whitehead's conception of God." (Jerome Stone, The Minimalist Vision of Transcendence, 51.) 18 Bernard Lee, S.M. "The Two Process Theologies," Theological Studies, 45, no. 2 (June 1984), 307-19.</page><page sequence="7">174 American Journal of Theology &amp; Philosophy keen sense of the limitations of reason and language; (2) less focus on the sure and certain, and more upon the probable and the ambiguous; (3) an affinity for the temporal and perhaps even the temporary; (4) a strong sensitivity to sin, evil, and the processes of resistance; (5) an abiding suspicion towards abstraction whenever its derivation cannot be traced to concrete experience; (6) a spirituality more akin to John Dewey's "meliorism"; and (7) a greater emphasis on relationality than on becoming.19 Even today Lee's listing of these differences remains instructive because, for one thing, it helps us to understand the directions that a number of major theologians have subsequently taken. But the larger value of Lee's article is that it reminds us of a significant debate that was never satisfactorily resolved and that, I believe, could have been more fruitfully pursued than, as things turned out, it was. III. Process Theology Revisited As a means of getting at the issues involved in this debate, let us revisit the brief catalog of process theology's main doctrines compiled above, adding to each statement, in the briefest possible way, such provisos, caveats, or objections as might arise within the more naturalistic reading of Whitehead that I am now proposing. Some of you will find the things I am about to say evident and even agreeable, while others of you will find them unwarranted and perhaps contentious. It is not feasible tonight to engage in a session of old fashioned Whiteheadian proof-texting, but I am glad to hold up my end of that kind of disputation in some more appropriate setting, if anyone is interested. But, to return to the assertions with which process theology is commonly identified: (1) "The state of God's being is described not by timeless perfection but by processive, emergent relationality. " The objection to this wording is that the nonchalant use of phrases like "the state of God's being" insinuates immediately that God is a unitary subject, though this is an idea not affirmed unequivocally by Whitehead himself and is, or should be, still an open question. Moreover, the attendant claim that God is "processive" and "relational" suggests that this presumed-to-be-unitary Deity endures through time, like what Whitehead called an enduring object or, as Hartshorne and others have 19 Ibid., 314-16.</page><page sequence="8">Vol. 30, No. 2, May 2009 175 said, as a personally-ordered society of occasions. But, with only rare waverings, Whitehead generally steers clear of any suggestion that God is an enduring being.20 Such a suggestion would be very difficult either to illustrate naturalistically or to defend empirically. It is much more characteristic of Whitehead to describe God as a "principle," a "factor," or as an "element" in the composition?the concrescence?of every occasion.21 For Whitehead God is not a being but a metaphysical function, operative in the first phase of each occasion?analogous to gravity or to electrostatic attraction and repulsion, which, though real and actual, are not beings but modes of operation and relation. (2) "God relates to the world not in the terms of a sovereign hegemony but through persuasive lures that, within limits, creatures are free to accept or reject. " The trouble with this statement is that it fails to recognize the obvious fact that, though God's function within each single Whiteheadian occasion may be persuasive rather than coercive, the cumulative effect of Whitehead's God upon the world is virtually compulsory, for the enduring patterns and structures of physical existence22 are not merely prominent in our experience but are in most circumstances absolutely controlling. My point is that cumulative action is just as responsible for outcomes as is isolated action?indeed, in some instances, more so. If a tribe of termites furtively sets up camp in your basement and dines on your floor joists until your house finally caves in, you do not, in bafflement, convene a philosophical conference to pore over the cause. You say it was the termites, even though no single bite by any single termite caused the collapse. But some process theologians seem so preoccupied with the notion of divine persuasiveness?and with that notion's attendant connotations of divine subjectivity, anthropomorphism, or personalism?that they fail to perceive the theological ramifications of the coercive aspects of Whitehead's God. Obviously I use the word coercive not to describe the 20 The notorious exception is found, of course, in Whitehead's discussion of the consequent nature of God in the final pages of his Gifford Lectures. Alfred North Whitehead, PR, 345-51.1 return to this issue in a moment. 21 The reader is referred to familiar passages in Alfred North Whitehead's Science and the Modern World (New York: Macmillan, 1925), 256-57; Adventures of Ideas (New York: Macmillan, 1933), 256, 362; and Modes of Thought (New York: The Free Press, 1968), 94, 102-3. 22 See, for example, Whitehead's discussion of God as "that actuality in the world, in virtue of which there is physical iaw.'"

(3) "Therefore the future is genuinely open, and God may not be blamed, as a classically omnipotent God might be, for naturally occurring evil or for the failures of human beings. " It is true that Whitehead's God may not be blamed for evil in the same way that the God of classical theism might be, for Whitehead's God is not a deliberative causal agent who operates by seeing earthly situations and then, occasionally, choosing to intervene. Instead, Whitehead's God is the universal ground of value-seeking in each occasion, generally having the same relatively creative type of aim for viruses, mosquitoes, human beings?and all other entities. Dorrien, quoting David Griffin, says that, "Cobb taught that Whitehead's system offered a third way between interventionist supernaturalism and the idea of God as 'something like a cosmic hydraulic jack' that constantly and everywhere exerted the same pressure."23 But though the phrase seems intended as a parody, personally I rather like the image suggested by "a cosmic hydraulic jack." Numerous passages from Whitehead could be cited to argue that, though the initial aims associated with the divine are varied to suit the context of each occasion, those aims do all point in the same general direction of enhanced intensity, complexity, etc.24 The style of personal spirituality prompted by this latter approach to Whitehead is more akin to adaptive stoicism than to the idealistic romanticism of much process theology?or, in terms of historic options in Protestant theology, it is more Calvinistic than Arminian. 23 Gary Dorrien, The Making of American Liberal Theology: Crisis, Irony, and Postmodernity, 1950-2006 (Louisville: Westminster John Knox Press, 2006), 232. Dorrien is quoting David Ray Griffin and Huston Smith, "How This Discussion Transpired," in Griffin and Smith, Primordial Truth and Postmodern Theology (Albany: State University of New York Press, 1989), 2. 24 "This function of God is analogous to the remorseless working of things in Greek and in Buddhist thought. The initial aim is the best for that impasse. But if the best be bad, then the ruthlessness of God can be personified as At?, the goddess of mischief. The chaff is burnt. What is inexorable in God, is valuation as an aim towards 'order'; and Order' means 'society permissive of actualities with patterned intensity of feeling arising from adjusted contrasts.'. . . If we prefer the phraseology, we can say that God and the actual world jointly constitute the character of the creativity for the initial phase of the novel concrescence." PR, 244-45. For a similar and less technical discussion, see 7, 214-18.</page><page sequence="10">Vol. 30, No. 2, May 2009 177 (4) "Besides, despite the harsh reality of evil and tragedy, it is comforting that the goodness in the world that can be salvaged is saved eternally in God's 'consequent nature. "' The consequent nature of God has become an indispensable doctrine in orthodox process theology. The main problem with this is that Whitehead himself wrote of the consequent nature in only one book?Process and Reality?and put off his examination of this notion until the book's final pages, a section marked more by poetic reverence than by philosophical precision, as Whitehead duly acknowledged.25 Whitehead identifies the consequent nature with God's "physical experience derived from the temporal world."26 It does seem reasonable to think that, in order for God's primordial nature to supply relevant initial aims for actual occasions, God must experience some sort of feedback from temporal events?but it is problematic, if not in fact incongruous, to assert that temporal experience is integrated with a primordial nature that it non-temporal.27 Besides, the whole idea of the consequent nature seems more nearly a surmise based on abstract reasoning; it lacks observable or testable effects. Perhaps that is why, in books that followed Process and Reality such as Adventures of Ideas and Modes of Thought, Whitehead ceased to speak of the consequent nature?a fact not often addressed at any length by process theologians who make the doctrine of the consequent nature a soteriological or eschatological cornerstone in their own 25 Whitehead introduced his comments on God's consequent nature by writing: "Apart from any reference to existing religions as they are, or as they ought to be, we must investigate dispassionately what the metaphysical principles, here developed, require on these points, as to the nature of God. There is nothing here in the nature of proof. There is merely the confrontation of the theoretic system with a certain rendering of the facts. But the unsystematized report upon the facts is itself highly controversial, and the system is confessedly inadequate. The deductions from it in this particular sphere of thought cannot be looked upon as more than suggestions as to how the problem is transformed in the light of that system. What follows is merely an attempt to add another speaker to that masterpiece, Hume's Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion. Any cogency of argument entirely depends upon elucidation of somewhat exceptional elements in our conscious experience?those elements which may roughly be classed together as religious and moral intuitions." PR, 343. 26 Ibid., 345. 27 Whitehead writes, "God's conceptual nature is unchanged, by reason of its final completeness. But his derivative nature is consequent upon the creative advance of the world." PR, 345. The conspicuous puzzle is how temporal consequences can be of any value for or effect upon a conceptual nature that is, by definition, unchanging.</page><page sequence="11">178 American Journal of Theology &amp; Philosophy appropriation of Whitehead. In light of the brevity and diffidence of Whitehead's comments about the consequent nature, it is hard to justify the attitude that the consequent nature of God should be seen as one of Whitehead's indispensable contributions to theology.29 I am not peremptorily dismissing Part V of Process and Reality. I am simply observing that it is misleading to view it as definitive, to the exclusion of Whitehead's other (and contrasting) writings. Furthermore, if the consequent nature is to have any meaning for empirical naturalism, it must be associated with some observable characteristic of lived experience. (5) "These notions may be summarized most aptly in the terms of a panentheism that holds that, though God is wholly immanent in the world, God's being somehow contains and surpasses the world, much as the selfhood of a human being is more than a mere assemblage of body parts. " There are passages in Whitehead that seem to suggest the mind-body imagery as an analogy for God's relation to the world. Much has been made of Whitehead's assertion that for God the conceptual is prior to the physical, whereas for the world the physical poles are prior to the conceptual.30 However, this is a relatively technical detail, and it is a non sequitur to argue from Whitehead's articulation of this detail to the conclusion that Whitehead himself viewed God as something like the Hegelian Absolute or the Mind of the Universe, in the sense of the traditional teleological argument. Of course Whitehead in fact never used the term panentheism, which 28 Schubert Ogden maintains, in a personal conversation with the author (Dec. 16, 2008, and subsequent emails), that though the words "consequent nature of God" are found only in PR, Whitehead does support the concept of the consequent nature in later books such as AI and MT. Though this claim is plausible enough to merit further attention, it does not undermine my present contention that many process theologians overstate the importance of the consequent nature and that the concept calls for more adequate empirical grounding. Regrettably this issue cannot be pursued further in the present article. 29 As Victor Lowe, Whitehead's biographer, observes, "The pages of the last part of Process and Reality occupy but one-twentieth of the book. The subject is God's consequent nature .... Whitehead's words glow, but his tone is tentative. If he were reasonably sure of this doctrine, he would have done well to include his concept of God in his categoreal Scheme." Victor Lowe, Alfred North Whitehead: The Man and His Work, Volume II: 1910-1947, ed. J.B. Schneewind (Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins University Press, 1990), 271. 30 PR, 345,348.</page><page sequence="12">Vol. 30, No. 2, May 2009 179 should be credited to (or blamed on) Hartshorne. There are, in my view, more passages where Whitehead sounds pantheistic than panentheistic. It is as true to say that God is one and the World many, as that the World is one and God many. It is as true to say that, in comparison with the World, God is actual eminently, as that, in comparison with God, the World is actual eminently. It is as true to say that the World is immanent in God, as that God is immanent in the world. It is as true to say that God transcends the World, as that the World transcends God. It is as true to say that God creates the World, as that the World creates God.... God and the World stand over against each other, expressing the final metaphysical truth that appetitive vision and physical enjoyment have equal claim to priority in creation. But no two actualities can be torn apart: each is all in all.31 I am not claiming that Hartshorne is not entitled to disagree with Whitehead (he certainly is), nor that all "true" process theologians would side with Whitehead over Hartshorne on this issue. Rather, my point is that it is a serious mistake to assume, as many do, that all process theologians are panentheists, or even simply that Whitehead was a panentheist.32 For the theological empiricism and naturalism that I believe Whitehead's ideas can justifiably be used to amplify, this presumed panentheism is problematical and counter-productive. 31 Ibid., 348. 32 For example, in a recent address Gary Dorrien claims that Whitehead was a panentheist. "The Lure and Necessity of Process Theology," delivered at the Process Theology Endowment Banquet, Claremont School of Theology, February 15, 2008, page 11.1 have received a copy of the manuscript from a friend who attended the event. As another example, see Catherine Keller, On the Mystery: Discerning Divinity in Process (Minneapolis: Fortress Press, 2008), in which Keller writes: "Similarly, in traditions close to process theology, the universe may be named 'the body of God.' This is not to identify God as spirit with the body of the world, as in pantheism ('all is divine'). Instead, process theology speaks of 'panentheism,' to retrieve the classical vision that 'all is in God.'" pp. 52-53. (Italics are Keller's.) Keller and Dorrien are both eminent interpreters of process theology, and yet neither hesitates to ascribe panentheism to process theology categorically. This in my view is a serious error.</page><page sequence="13">180 American Journal of Theology &amp; Philosophy IV. Process Theology as a Form of Naturalism The modifications or revisions that I have just recommended for conventional process theology can, I believe, be taken as a point of departure for a more naturalistic interpretation of Whitehead. Now, by naturalism I mean the familiar doctrine that the universe is all there is and that there is neither any transcendent spiritual reality nor even any "self-surpassing surpasser of all"33 that coincides with the universe and yet encloses or unifies it. God is not a divine being who thinks or acts but a functionality operable in each occasion's act of self-constitution. There is no encompassing goal or unified teleology that guides the entire cosmos at once. These statements, I believe, are compatible with a type of naturalism. However, one aspect of Whitehead's system that I believe must be retained is his conviction that each occasion embodies at least some minimal degree of mentality, sometimes mistakenly referred to as Whitehead's "panpsychism" but more accurately described as "pan mentalism" or "pan-experientialism." Some of you naturalists will want to disallow the ubiquity of mentality,34 but I do not see how anyone who impugns the ontological co-equality of the mental and the physical can call themselves Whiteheadian. More importantly, I do not see how anyone who denies the elemental ontological status of something like what Whitehead called the "mental pole" can explain the current, structured state of the world. It is not merely a matter of explaining biological evolution or human consciousness. Some type of mental (or "hybrid physical") prehension is necessary in order simply to integrate contemporary physics into one's worldview. After all, Whitehead's mental pole is not a miniature mind, engaged in miniature ruminations concerning miniature little ideas. The mental pole is simply a way of talking about the ability of physical events to receive, retain, and convey information?an ability which is implied by relativity's notion of variable "frames of reference," required by quantum mechanics' 33 Charles Hartshorne, The Divine Relativity: A Social Conception of God (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1964 [1948]), 20. 34 Charley D. Hardwick is representative of a number of naturalistic philosophers who cite "panpsychism" as the chief reason why process philosophy is not and cannot be naturalistic. Hardwick, "'. . . Our Lives Are Afloat on a Sea of Grace . . .': On Deontologizing Religious Value," an unpublished manuscript presented to the Fourth International Conference on Philosophical Theology, in Dobog?k , Hungary, August 6, 2003, p. 4.</page><page sequence="14">Vol. 30, No. 2, May 2009 181 concept of holistic physical systems, and, indeed, an explanation of how it is that physical objects universally follow mathematical patterns. To say that every actual occasion has a mental pole is much like a physicist saying that a quark is characterized by "charm," "color," or "spin." What is being described is not a literal thing but an operability, a behavior, and is therefore compatible with a type of naturalism. Whitehead's notion of a mental pole in every actual occasion is not, as some have assumed, an anthropomorphic image foisted upon nature. It is simply a way of explaining the existence of pattern and emergent wholeness in the universe. That Whitehead is subsequently able to refer to the mental pole as a way of accounting for the purposiveness and freedom of higher organisms is a welcome philosophical benefit, but human consciousness should not be regarded as the paradigm Whitehead had in mind when he became convinced of the truth of pan mentalism.35 In fact, given what we now understand about the constant transmission of information in physical nature, the burden of proof has shifted to the remaining pure physicalists and reductionistic materialists to explain how data are indeed conveyed even apart from the emission of energetic signals or in the form of "information" conveyed by simple physical collisions. Pursuing this matter would rapidly distract us from our present topic, but I will say that I think I agree with John Searle that uncompromising materialism may increasingly be recognized as something of a faith-stance,36 of course not derived from scriptures but from our culture's historic inculcation of a Newtonian worldview. In any case, my point at present is that if you insist on defining naturalism as the idea that everything can be reduced to the purely physical, thus scrapping any vestige of mentality, then of course you will say that Whitehead cannot be a naturalist. But in that case what we have is more nearly a dispute over the definition of a term, posing as a substantive philosophical debate. 35 Whitehead himself attributes his idea of pan-mentalism to his own studies in mathematics and mathematical physics. SMW, 219. 36 Slingerland ascribes to Searle the view that "physicalism functions as a modern religious dogma, accepted 'without question' and with 'quasi-religious faith.'" Slingerland, "Who's Afraid of Reductionism," 392, note 15, citing John Searle, Mind: A Brief Introduction (New York: Oxford University Press, 2004), 48. By citing Searle I do not mean to imply that I am in substantive agreement with his overall position, with which I have only a sketchy acquaintance.</page><page sequence="15">182 American Journal of Theology &amp; Philosophy V. Left-wing and Right-wing Process Theologians The idea that I now wish to restate is that, if we free ourselves from the encumbrances of Hartshornian process theology, we find in Whitehead valuable resources for a more consistent, empirical naturalism. Let me amplify this briefly. In a manuscript for a book on which I am now working, I propose that the differences between what Lee called "the two types of process theology" resemble the historic differences between left- and right-wing Hegelians. In July 1826, in Hegel's own home, a scholarly society was organized to promote his philosophy, apply his ideas to diverse topics, and establish accuracy and expose errors in the interpretation of Hegelianism?in other words, to engage in a sort of Hegelian scholasticism. Members eventually included Karl Rosenkranz (1805-1879), Hermann Hinrichs (1794 1861), Johann Erdmann (1805-1892), Rudolf Haym (1821-1901), Eduard Zeller (1814-19008), Kuno Fischer (1824-1907), and others.37 These were the "right-wing" Hegelians. There was however another group, not as well organized, of those who were deeply influenced by Hegel's philosophy but whose chief interests went beyond Hegelianism as a subject worth studying for its own sake. Instead, they sought to apply themes which were only broadly or derivatively Hegelian to a wide variety of topics, including not only philosophy but ranging from theology to political theory and economics. This group, whose representatives are generally better remembered today, included Arnold Ruge (1803-1880), Bruno Bauer (1809-1882), Ludwig Feuerbach (1804-1872), Karl Marx (1818-1883), and David Friedrich Strauss (1808-1874). It was Strauss, a theologian, who first applied the terms "left wing" and "right wing" to the Hegelians, based on the left, right, and center designations which had been invented to describe the French parliament.38 Strauss located himself in the left wing. The use of the terms "left" and "right" to distinguish two types of Whiteheadians is an improvement over the words "empirical" and "rational" because left and right suggest an overall divergence in 37 Stephen D. Crites, "Hegelianism," The Encyclopedia of Philosophy, ed. Paul Edwards (New York: Macmillan Publishing Company, Inc., and the Free Press, 1967), III, 451-59. 38 Ibid.</page><page sequence="16">Vol. 30, No. 2, May 2009 183 outlook rather than the simple methodological distinction indicated by empirical and rational?a distinction which, at any rate, is no longer as applicable as it once was. If we apply the left-right terminology to process theologians, I suggest that we can summarize the differences between the two as follows. An obvious difference has to do with origins and sources. To many left-wing theologians it often seems that the right is so absorbed with Whitehead that they neglect the insights and nuances found in the worfa of other seminal figures, such as C.S. Peirce, William James, Henri Bergson, John Dewey, and Pierre Teilhard de Chardin. The left wing traces its origins not only to Whitehead but to the empirical theology of the University of Chicago Divinity School, to the pragmatism of Peirce, James, and Dewey, and to the radical empiricism of James. This leads to a second point, namely, that where the left wing focuses on experience, the right manifests a greater interest in coherence, logical inference, and consistency of system. From the perspective of the left, the right sometimes seems to rely too automatically on the outcome of verbal arguments and too little on applicability and exemplification. The left is mindful of Whitehead's sympathetic interest in the American pragmatists, and approaches Whitehead's philosophy not as a completed system but as a pragmatic, functional, and even poetic portrayal of the world. The left wing tends to prefer pragmatic theories of truth to correspondence theories. An over-emphasis on the conceptual or rational side of process thought can lead to what the left wing regards as a reification or hypostatization of Whitehead's terms. Nancy Frankenberry has observed wryly that, taken analogically, Whitehead's metaphysics is "sophisticated anthropomorphism." Taken literally, it is "ludicrous." It is only when taken metaphorically that Whitehead's scheme might very well be "the glass through which we darkly see."39 The right-wing's relative confidence in language leads to another point of divergence. While left-wing process theologians have shown little interest in the construction of metaphysical systems, the right has sought to flesh out and improve Whitehead's system as if that 39 Nancy Frankenberry, "Language about the Totality," Encounter 44 (Winter 1983), 58; quoted by Gary Dorrien in The Making of American Liberal Theology, 464. It is apparent that Whitehead would agree with Frankenberry about the metaphorical quality of his ideas; see PR, Part I, Chapter I, especially 4, 17.</page><page sequence="17">184 American Journal of Theology &amp; Philosophy objective were self-justifying. To this end, the right wing has bestowed what seems to the left to be an unduly concentrated attention on Process and Reality, the most systematic, technical, and closely argued of Whitehead's books. The fact that Process and Reality is not entirely consistent internally tends to be viewed by the right as a defect in need of repair. In contrast, many on the left see Whitehead's inconsistencies as providing elbow room in which to operate; one is not committed to ferreting out the one correct answer to every question. Though not cavalier regarding logic or rational coherence, the left typically places a greater emphasis on the criteria of adequacy and exemplification, with a persistent concern for "checkable consequences." Indeed, for the left it is sometimes preferable to speak and write about process theology without referring directly to Whitehead at all. The right wing's disproportionate reference to Process and Reality has critical consequences specifically for the idea of God. In orthodox process theology it is not unusual to find articles and even entire books about process theology in which alternatives to the primordial-consequent description of God are never even mentioned. Whitehead's contrasting doctrines, such as the Principle of Concretion in Science and the Modern World and the Divine Eros in Adventures of Ideas, are neglected or simply ignored. This is part of the reason why the right tends to take it for granted, first, that Whitehead's God is to be understood within the rubric of panentheism, and second, that the power exercised by Whitehead's God should be conceived of as fundamentally persuasive rather than coercive. The left would seek greater nuance and circumspectness in the formulation of these expressions. For theology, the distinction between Hartshorne's panentheism and Whitehead's mutual immanence is critical, for it bears on historic doctrines such as divine providence, soteriology, eschatology, and even on the question of which modes of personal spirituality and prayer are appropriate. Finally, the left wing is quite aware of the limitations of language. As a corollary to this awareness that our 'forms and symbols' are 'fallible,'40 mystery is frequently accorded a positive theological status. There is a serious appreciation for Meland's well-known adage, "We live more deeply than we can think." Like Meland, Dean, Potthoff, and others, I think we can find much of value in Whitehead without 40 Of course the phrase is Melano"s.

I hope that you may agree that the differentiation between left- and right-wing process theologians is a promising means of getting at some serious theological issues. VI. A Modest Suggestion In closing, let me reiterate that my goal this evening has not been to identify the "true Whitehead" so that additional Whiteheadians can be recruited for some sort of movement. I should also acknowledge that most of the "right wing" Whiteheadians are now no longer as fervent as they once were about some of the methods and stances I ascribe to them, and that, in any case, the "left-right" differentiation is more nearly a heuristic device than an accurate portrayal of any actual scholar. In fact there is considerable overlap between the two groups. My aim is not to attack anyone but, rather, to discover, or rediscover, Whitehead as the cosmologist-philosopher, freed from some of the accouterments of conventional process theology, so that his ideas can again serve as a useful resource for those who are already headed in an empirical, naturalistic theological direction. Will there ever actually be any scholars who refer to themselves as "left-wing Whiteheadians" or "left-wing process theologians"? Who can say? But, remembering that Bernard Loomer concluded his famous essay on "S-I-Z-E" with a short fable, I now use that fact as a flimsy excuse for ending tonight's address, also, with a story. Years ago in England, when King George VI was still a boy, he stood one winter morning with his brother Edward, looking out the window at a group of ragamuffins engaged in a boisterous snowball fight. As soon as their governess left the room, Edward looked at Albert, and Albert looked at Edward. Grabbing their coats, both boys slipped outside to join the fun. But as the battle grew more intense, a recklessly aimed snowball missed its human target and headed toward the palace, where it broke through one of the windows. A guardsman quickly appeared, and soon the group of boys found themselves lined up before the precinct sergeant. What's your name, boy?" the sergeant asked the first fellow in line. The boy stood ramrod straight and answered, "My name is Edward, Prince of Wales." "Oh, a smart little bloke, ain't we!" declared the sergeant. He addressed himself to the next boy. "And what's your name?"</page><page sequence="19">186 American Journal of Theology &amp; Philosophy "My name is Albert, Duke of Windsor," said the second. The sergeant exploded, "In all my life, I've never seen such a pack of liars!" He turned to the third boy. "So, what's your name?" The little boy looked at the floor, looked at the ceiling, and then, wiping his nose on his sleeve, he said, "I'm goin' to stand wiv' me buddies, Guvnor. I'm the Archbishop of Canterbury." I have spoken this evening about a hypothetical classification of scholars called "left-wing Whiteheadians." However, knowing some of these scholars as I do, I think it rather doubtful that they will ever organize themselves into a group with sufficient esprit de corps to stand as comrades when brought before the interrogations of academic accountability. But then, for people who are in the left wing of anything, an organized effort is probably not the most salient goal anyway. I leave you now simply with the notion of Whitehead the naturalist, to do with as you will.</page></plain_text>
