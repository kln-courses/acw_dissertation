Nonethe less, in his first season of publishing, Lagerfeld has endeavored to bring the world some of both in this hand somely designed and printed book. A contemporary of actress Sarah Bernhardt, Rejane is largely forgot ten today, though during her lifetime she was well-known throughout Eu rope, North America, and in parts of South America. In contrast to Bern hardt and her melodramatic style, Rejane was renowned for a subtle expressiveness that was not over played, and for a physical beauty that was not overly made up. This comes through in the photographs, where she appears elegantly poised, with just a hint of a smile, or a slightly dramatic affectation of the eyes. Posed in different dresses but with a weirdly unchanging expression, she looks more like a plastic doll than a woman, perhaps, in part, the result of long exposures. Reproduced on a sumptuous cream-colored paper, and including four gatefolds, the book is a visual treat. The introductory essay describes Rejane's youth, her ascen sion to fame, and her love life. In French—the only language to de scribe a woman who came to define La Parisienne. Palaces in the Night: Whistler in Venice. By Margaret F. Mac Donald. University of California Press, Berkeley, with Lund Humphries, Alder shot, Hants, UK, 2001.160 pp. 120 illustrations, 80 in color. 135 This elegantly designed book inves tigates its subject from almost every possible angle and with a great vari ety of resources. It focuses on a brief, but pivotal period in James McNeill Whistler's career, his 14-month stay in Venice in 1879—80, when he cre ated more than 50 etchings and 100 pastels that would reestablish his position in the art worlds of London and Paris. This is the third book on Whistler by Margaret MacDonald of the Centre for Whistler Studies at the University of Glasgow. She begins with a description of Whistlers ear lier life in London, recounting how he became one of the foremost etch ers there, only to fall out of favor and into bankruptcy. It's a story well told, and it's accompanied by illustrations of Whistler etchings and other art from the period, photographs of the artist, and excerpts of his witty and, at times, hilarious correspondence. The bulk of the book covers Whistler in Venice, the depiction of which was all the rage among artists of his day. But Whistler's interest, as he wrote, was in capturing "not merely the 'Views ofVenice' or the Streets of Venice, or the 'Canals ofVenice' such as you have seen brought back by the foolish sketcher—but great pic tures that stare you in the face ..." Works like The Beggars, for example, a gloomy picture of a homeless moth er and daughter standing in a dark tunnel, shows a more hidden aspect of the city. Modern photographs, taken by MacDonald, are occasional ly placed next to Whistler's scenes so that we can see the source of his inspiration. Highly entertaining, too, is her account ofWhistler's return to London, where the critics lambasted his work after its first showing; his later vindication is a great story in itself. The book includes 14 letters written by Whistler, followed by a detailed appendix listing all of the known etchings and pastels and their locations, where known. Stefano della Bella: Baroque Printmaker.The I.Webb Surratt, Jr. Print Collection. By Charles Johnson. Marsh Art Gallery, University of Richmond Museums, Richmond, Virgin ia, 2001. 96 pp. 78 illustrations. $15 At the core of I. Webb Surratt, Jr.'s print collection, donated to the Marsh Art Gallery at the University of Richmond Museums by his fam ily in 1996, is a remarkable group of prints by the baroque master Stefano della Bella (1610—64). While Phyllis Massar's work on the artist remains preeminent, this catalogue of a spring show organized at the Marsh provides a thoughtful summary of his career and oeuvre by guest cura tor Charles Johnson, as well as fur ther evidence of the riches to be found in some of this country's smaller public collections. And it allows a tantalizing glimpse into Delia Bella's rather rarified world; for in his capacity as designer-print maker to the Medici court, and later to the court of Louis XIV in Paris, he almost obsessively recorded con temporary events and scenes ranging from public and court festivals to battles, landscapes, and animals. Most of these works were sold by his pub lishers to collectors of both mercan tile and noble rank. But although often couched within traditional iconographic formulae, his etchings reveal a vitality that points to his habit of mining elements from sketches made mostly out of doors or in situ. Delia Bella's famous ani mal prints, for example, although based on ancient sources showing animal hunts and symbolism that had been revived during the Ren aissance, are also unusually realistic— and some, like the defiant ostrich from the series Hunts of Different Animals of 1654, also embody a cer tain anthropomorphic charm. View of the Pont Neuf in Paris (ca. 1646) promoted Henri IV s modernization of the city, yet also presents a vivid picture of its swarms of ordinary in habitants (among them a tooth puller, duelists, sellers of sweetmeats, three donkeys, and a lamb). He also produced some 50 drawings on the manufacture and uses of fireworks, a Book for the Study of Drawing (1641— 49), designed as a visual aid for drafts men, and printed rebuses intended to be fixed to hand-held fans.
