<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE HUNT IN THE ROMANCERO AND OTHER TRADITIONAL BALLADS IT is common to classify ballads as narrative poetry; it is just as common for critics to attend to the narrative and to overlook the poetry. While folk ballads generally shun metaphors, the concepts and actions that have an obvious role in the plot may carry connota- tions and associations far beyond this role. Some motifs, though dealing with action, contribute but little to the development of the plot; yet these are possibly the motifs that have sustained the ap- peal of the ballad through centuries. To say that hunting plays an important part in traditional bal- lads is both right and wrong. Hunters abound but seldom bring home any game; in the Romancero, the game is not even likely to appear. The reason for this lies in one of the main characteristics of balladry. Ballads deal with people and their relations with other people, or sometimes other anthropomorphic beings. Hunting is thus not the subject, but the scene, the circumstance, the atmosphere. This does not mean that hunting skill failed to enhance the image of a medieval knight, as he appears in ballads. In the eulogy of the Infantes de Salas, the distinction of two of the slain sons is proficiency in hunting: -Hijo Suero Gustos, todo el mundo os estimaba; el rey os tuviera en mucho, solo para la su caza: gran caballero esforzado, muy buen bracero a ventaja ... -Oh hijo Fernan Gonzalez, nombre del mejor de Espafia, ... matador de puerco espin, amigo de gran compana.1 But more often hunting is mentioned without special emphasis, simply as the habitual activity of a knight. When the Christian girl in Don Bueso y su hermana is riding with the young man who has rescued her from Moorish captivity, she recognizes the countryside where her father and brother used to hunt: -Lloro porque en estos campos mi padre a cazar venfa, con mi hermano Moralejo y toda su cortesia.2 Primavera 24, M.

The pleasure of hunting, not the gain, is the idea behind this motif. In two Danish ballads, the young knight is advised to go hunting so as to forget an impossible love: "Go then, and hunt the hart and hind; "So banish Christel from thy mind. "Go, hunt the stag, go hunt the roe, "And every thought of love forego."4 British knights often hunt the fallow deer, as in Lord Thomas and Lady Margaret (Child 260): Lord Thomas is to the hunting gone, To hunt the fallow deer; Lady Margaret's to the greenwood shaw, To see her lover hunt there.5 So also in Hughie Grame (Child 191), "our lords are to the moun- tains gane, / A hunting o the fallow deer." For a king, the chase is an occasion to meet people of other walks of life, as in King Edward the Fourth and a Tanner of Tamworth (Child 273), or to talk to his courtiers, as in the Romance del conde de Luna: El rey don Juan el segundo dijo un dia andando a caza al infante don Fadrique que conde de Luna se llama, que a don Garcia Fernindez le fuesse a ver a la cama.6 3 In the German equivalent, Deutsche Volkslieder mit ihren Melodien: Balladen, ed. J. Meier et al. (Berlin-Freiburg, 1935-67), Iv, 7, the brother is introduced as a lord, a knight, or alternatively a hunter: "Es ritt ein Jaiger wohl iiber den Rhein." 4 R. C. A.

However, the hunt was just one of many occasions for a conversation between a king and his nobles. Two sixteenth- century versions of Conde Claros are Prim. 191 ("A caza va el emperador") and Prim. 192 ("A misa va el emperador"). In Sephardic versions, the king simply goes out, Larrea Palacin, Romances, I, 92 ff.; R. Men6ndez Pidal, "Romancero judio-espafiol," in Los romances de America y otros estudios, 4th ed. (Buenos Aires, 1945), No. 23, p. 148. 134 HR, 42 (1974)</page><page sequence="3">The Hunt in the Traditional Ballads Men6ndez y Pelayo (xII, 162) points out that the romance follows closely the Cronica de D. Juan II, of 1434: "E yendo un dia (el Rey) a caza, 6 con 61 D. Fadrique, Conde de Luna, 6 otros muchos ca- balleros, el Rey lo llam6 e dixo: 'Conde, yo vos mando que vayais con el conde D. Garci Fernandez Manrique a su posada ...' " On the hunting scene, where a knight spent a great deal of his time, the game took second place after hawk and hound-"the in- signia of a gentleman from Norway to Spain." Documents tell of privileged nobles taking their falcons to Mass and even perching them on the edge of the altar. "The portraits of illustrious persons and their tombs are frequently embellished with ... hawks and hounds."7 Severe punishment of a knight consisted of blinding, and cutting off the foot used for mounting a horse and the hand that held the hawk: SAcanle ambos los ojos, los ojos de la su faz, c6rtanle el pie del estribo, la mano del gavilnn.8 Separation from hawks and hounds is symbolic of duress. The im- prisoned Young Beichan (Child 53 H) sings about his great priva- tions: 'My hounds they all go masterless, My hawks they flee frae tree to tree, MIy youngest brother will heir my lands, My native land I'll never see.' In some versions of this ballad, his captor's daughter, helping him escape, supplies him with the basic necessities, including "a leash o guid grayhounds" (Child 53 c, D). The boasting of knights at a revel, Redesdale and Wise William (Child 246 A), shows what is foremost in their minds: For some o them hae roosd their hawks, And other some their hounds, And other some their ladies fair, And their bowers whare they walkd in. 7 Prior, Ballads, I, 231. "Hawks" and "falcons" will be used loosely to desig- nate various hunting birds. In the Romancero it is obvious that several species are mentioned interchangeably to fit rhythm and assonance. 8 Prim. 109 (Men6ndez y Pelayo, Antologia, vIII, 223); also Prim. 171 (Anto- logia, ix, 57). 135</page><page sequence="4">Edith Rogers When Thomas Rhymer (Child 37) meets the Queen of Elfland, hawk and hounds are a part of her splendor: Her mantle was o velvet green, And a' set round wi jewels fine; Her hawk and hounds were at her side, And her bugle-horn in gowd did shine. In a Danish ballad, a Wild Huntsman's hawk and hound match the color of his own gear: And all in black Sir Morten went Down to his dark abode, And black were both his hawk and hound, And troop that with him rode. (Prior, Ballads, I, 389) In The Three Ravens (Child 26), the hawks and hounds are loyal to their master even after his death: 'Downe in yonder greene field, There lies a knight slain under his shield. 'His hounds they lie down at his feete, So well they can their master keepe. 'His haukes they flie so eagerly, There's no fowle dare come him nie.' For the Serbians, a man's falcon is his protector and mentor. The falcon whose life Marko saved at Kossovo returns the kindness by bringing him water in his beak and shading him from the sun when he falls ill by the roadside.9 Dmitar plans to poison his brother Bogdan during a feud over a horse and a falcon, but his falcon teaches him a lesson about the unity of brothers.10 Lithuanians be- lieved that killing a falcon brought disaster, since he was a friend and messenger of man. A ballad tells of a king who shoots a falcon and is mortally hit by the falling bird.1 The great importance attached to a knight's hounds and hawks has considerable bearing on the sig- nificance of the Spanish motif of tired hounds and lost falcons, which will be discussed shortly. 9 D.

Men6ndez Pidal points out a change suf- fered by Conde Dirlos.12 In the old minstrel ballad, the count was an avid hunter: EstAbase el conde Dirlos, sobrino de don Beltran, asentado en sus tierras, deleitandose en cazar, cuando le vinieron cartas de Carlos el emperante. The letter contains the emperor's orders to go to war against the Moor Aliarde. Dirlos is especially loath to leave since he has been married less than a year, but the motif chosen to represent the end of the happy life is not the parting from his wife but the dismissal of his hunting companions: Triste estaba y pensativo, no cesa de sospirar: despide los falconeros, los monteros manda pagar, despide todos aquellos con quien solia deleitarse. (Prim. 164 EMen6ndez y Pelayo, Antologia, ix, 8]) By the insertion of one letter, the count's addiction switches in the modern version from hunting to footwear, which, in turn, expands into a parallel verse about clothing: Estaba el conde Nifio, en su palacio real, deleitandose en vestir, deleitandose en calzar, cuando le vinieron cartas que tenfa que marchar.l3 Similar atrophy of the hunt motif can be observed in La esposa infiel, where the husband's hunting creates at home an occasion for adul- tery. In the versions collected in the sixteenth century, the lady tells the visiting knight that her husband is away hunting, where- upon the lover wishes destruction upon the husband, his hawk, and his hounds: -A caza es ido, a caza a los montes de Le6n. -Si a caza es ido, sefora, caigale mi maldicion, rabia le mate los perros, aguilillas el falc6n, lanzada de moro izquierdo le traspase el corazon. (Prim. 136a EMen6ndez y Pelayo, Antologia, vII, 2533) 12 R. Men6ndez Pidal, Romancero hispdnico (Madrid, 1953), I, 277. 13 Men6ndez Pidal, Romancero, I, 277; see also Cossio and Maza Solano, Ro- mancero, i, 88, 93. 137</page><page sequence="6">A modern version from Asturias retains hunting as the reason for the husband's absence, together with the curse, and even adds a third reference to the hunt by letting the husband arrive with game for the wife: Mi marido es ido a caza a los montes de Le6n: para que no vuelva nunca, le echar6 una maldici6n: "Cuervos le saquen los ojos &amp;guilas el coraz6n, los perros de mis rebafios le arrastren en procesion."- Estando en estas palabras el marido que llego. -Abreme la puerta, luna, Abreme la puerta, sol, que te traigo un cervatillo de los montes de Leon.- (Men6ndez y Pelayo, Antologia, x, 87) The main change is in the curse: gone are the inseparable compan- ions of the medieval hunter-hawk and hounds-who in the old versions were to share the husband's misfortune. P6rez Vidal as- sumes that, with the coming of firearms, the original curse lost its gravity; in one of his examples from the Canary Islands, the ferret is substituted for the hawk: "Cuervos le quiten los ojos, / aguelillas y huron."14 Nine of the ten variants from Santander published by Cosslo and Maza Solano coincide in the three references to hunting with the version from Asturias, above. The catch can be a rabbit, a bird, or three doves (Romancero, I, 215 ff.). Of the three Andalu- sian variants published by Men6ndez y Pelayo, only in one is the husband said to be hunting and becomes the object of a curse by the wife, as is usual in the modern versions (in the early romance, the curse was pronounced by the lover). In one variant, "es ido a caza" has become "no 'sta en casa" (as also in a variant from the Canary Islands). The third Andalusian variant states only that the hus- band is out: "Que mi marido esti fuera / por esos montes de Dios" (Men6ndez y Pelayo, Antologia, x, 179 ff.). This wording resembles the six Chilean variants published by Vicufa Cifuentes, in none of which does the wife say that her husband is hunting.15 While the mention of hunting as an explanation of the husband's absence has become sporadic, the ballad singers have been reluctant to drop the curse, with its strong emotional effect, and use it in a 14 P6rez Vidal, "Romancero ...," p. 266; "y hur6n" should be "el hur6n" (ibid., p. 278). 15 J. Vicuna Cifuentes, Romances populares y vulgares (Santiago de Chile, 1912), pp. 79-87. 138 Edith Rogers HE, 42 (1974)</page><page sequence="7">The Hunt in the Traditional Ballads modernized form to show the wife's depravity. As a contrast to her contemptible attitude, the husband's affection is expressed by the game he brings home for her-not just as a supplement to the diet, but as a special favor to her ("que te traigo un conejito," "que te traigo un pajarito"). That the latter two parts of the hunt motif- curse and gift-with their function of characterization are nowadays more important than the first reference to hunting is indicated by the variants that omit the business that has taken the husband away from home, but contain either the curse, the gift, or both.16 The omission of the first mention of hunting must be due to changes in actual custom and to changes in the class that cultivates the Ro- mancero. A knight was either at war, which could account for an absence of many years, or hunting, which took him away for a short time.17 A peasant-even a medieval and certainly a modern peas- ant-can have many chores away from home. Thus the ready as- sociation between "out" and "hunting" has faded, altering nothing in the plot, but depriving the style of the romance of some of its vigor. Adherence to the traditional preference for concrete images and ac- tion, together with the fact that hunting, though less prominently, is still within the scope of the experience of the ballad audience, may account for the retention of the pertinent lines in many texts of this romance, including some modern Portuguese and several Catalan variants of Castilian origin.18 Hunting is the reason for the husband's absence also in all four variants of Lucrezia, a Piedmontese ballad of infidelity' in Nigra's collection: "Me mari l'e anda a la cassa, custa n6it ch'a vnira pa."19 Also in Donna Lombarda, a Piedmontese ballad about a treacherous wife who tries to poison her husband, the latter comes home from a 16 P6rez Vidal, "Romancero ...," p. 266; Menendez y Pelayo, Antologia, x, 181; K. Schindler, Folk Music and Poetry of Spain and Portugal (New York, 1941), texts, pp. 58-59. 17 In an exceptional case such as a Sephardic variant, P. Benichou, "Romances judeo-espanioles de Marruecos," RFH, 6 (1944), 316, the hunt is replaced by war and the curse limited to death by Moorish hand: Mi marido estA en las guerras, en las guerras de Le6n, y para que mas no volva le echare una baldisi6n [sic], que al le maten los moros, le saquen el coras6n. 18 Schindler, Folk Music, texts, p. 59; Th.

In the Scottish Little Musgrave and Lady Barnard (Child 81 G), the com- monplace of hunting the fallow deer accounts for Lord Barnard's ab- sence, which facilitates the meeting of his wife and Wee Messgrove: Lord Barnard's awa to the green wood, To hunt the fallow deer; His vassals a' are gane wi him, His companie to bear. In the Portuguese Morena, the wife, impatient to visit her lover, the friar, urges the husband to go hunting: "Erguei-vos d'ai, homem meu chamae os caes, ide a caqa, que o mais certo coelho e' esse da madrugada, que nao ha casa mais certa do que a da madrugada."20 Many mishaps besides adultery can occur at home while a man is out hunting. In several versions of El cautivo, the Moorish lady of the house (in Portuguese texts identified as the Moor's daughter) not only comforts the captive in the master's absence but also pro- vides him with the means of escape.2' In the Catalan Nodriza, the nurse falls asleep and lets the infant prince burn to a cinder while the king and the queen are hunting: Lo bon rey s' en va X cassa, lo bon rey y la regina; no quede ningu al palau sino 1' infant y la dida. (Mila, Romancerillo, p. 39) Most often, however, the center of the trouble is the wife left at home by the hunter. In the romance of the wicked mother-in-law who sends the wife to her parents' home to have her first child, and then, by slandering her to her husband, causes her death, the reason for the man's absence is usually not stated until his mother promises to attend to his hawk's needs upon his return: -Yo le dar6 de mi vino, yo le dar6 de mi pan, cebada para el caballo, came para el gavilnn.22 20 Braga, Cantos populares, p. 376 (see also p. 378). 21 Prim. 131 (Menendez y Pelayo, Antologia, VIII, 245): "Cuando el moro se iba a caza / quitabame la cadena." The Moor goes hunting also in a modern variant from Santander, Cossio and Maza Solano, Romancero, I, 379; a Sephardic text, Larrea Palacin, Romances, I, 170; and a Portuguese version, Th. Braga, Romanceiro geral (Coimbra, 1867), p. 114. A Sephardic variant (Larrea Palacin, Romances, I, 172) makes the usual change to "cuando el amo ibase de casa." 22 Men6ndez y Pelayo, Antologia, x, 95 (see also p. 313); Cossio and Maza Solano, Romancero, i, 241 ff. 140 Edith Rogers HR, 42 (1974)</page><page sequence="9">The Hunt in the Traditional Ballads In some variants, the mother-in-law promises to give either to her son or to his wife one-half of the bag: De la caza que 61 trujese mandardte la mitad; de la perdiz algo menos, de la palomba algo m6s.23 A husband may also find that his wife has been abducted during his hunt. Thus, La esposa de don Garcia: Fuera a caza, fuera a caza el infante don Garcia, fuera a caza, fuera a caza, no caz6 como solfa. Mientras tanto le llevaron la su esposa dofa Elvira.24 Abduction during the hunter's absence from home is particularly frequent in Russian byliny (epic ballads). Czar Koshchei, an un- believer, seizes Mikhailo Potyk's wife; two nephews of the Lithu- anian king take Prince Roman's sister.25 The act can be reciprocal, as in the case of Prince Roman and Marya Yuryevna: while Ro- man is hunting, his wife is taken across the sea to Manuil; when M\anuil rides out to hunt, MIarya escapes and returns to her husband (Trautmann, Das Heldenlied, pp. 369-71). Likewise, Czar Salomo is hunting when Torokashko arrives with his fabulous ships to ab- duct the czarina for Prince Vasily; but also Salomo, in pursuit of his wife, arrives at Vasily's palace when the latter is out hunting (Trautmann, Das Heldenlied, pp. 246, 248). In the Portuguese Melisendra, Gayfeiros rescues his wife while her captor is at a hunt: 0 rei que vinha da caga la deitou a desfilar. Sentiu logo Dom Gayfeiros como o iam alcancar. (Braga, Romanceiro geral, p. 101) In a Sicilian ballad, the hunting trip of Scibilia's husband gives the Moors an opportunity to break down the door and take her away.26 On the other hand, a large group of European abduction ballads re- lated to the Piedmontese Moro Saracino and the French L'Escri- 23 Men6ndez y Pelayo, Antologia, x, 94; see also Cossio and Maza Solano, Romancero, I, 241, and Braga, Romanceiro geral, p. 42. 24 Cossio and Maza Solano, Romancero, I, 46, and three other variants. This romance will be discussed further in connection with the introductory motif of the ominous hunt. The motif is lacking in the two versions from Asturias (Menendez y Pelayo, Antologia, x, 76-79). 26 R. Trautmann, Die Volksdichtung der GroBrussen, I: Das Heldenlied (Hei- delberg, 1935), pp. 316, 269. 26 S.

The Moorish queen asks her husband to go hunt- ing and to bring her a Christian slave: -Sal a cazar, el rey moro, a cazar como solias y traer,sme una cristiana de gran belleza y valia. Ya se saliera el rey moro a las carreras salia y a la hija del buen conde alli ficiera cautiva.28 The word cazar in this romance is interpreted by D. Devoto as cau- tivar, capturar.29 On the other hand, "hunting" may have had a broad meaning of going out and taking whatever was worth taking: the "hunt" could include a local raid, a skirmish, or an attack on wayfarers, as in this case.30 In a Portuguese version, the queen sends the Moors to war for the same purpose: -A guerra, A guerra, mourinhos, quero uma christa cativa. uns vao pelo mar abaixo, outros pela terra acima: Tragam-me a christa cativa, que 6 para nossa rainha. (Braga, Romanceiro geral, p. 103) The two forms-a cazar and a guerra-lead in this romance to the same kind of action. Since hunting is readily accepted as an explanation of a man's absence, as, for example, in the Portuguese Promessa de noivado,3 it is natural to give it also as a false excuse. The king in the Portu- guese Condessa, trying to conceal the execution of the boy from his mother, says his page has gone hunting: "Senhor rei que 6 do meu filho; que eu o venho visitar? -"O seu filho 6 na caga, e' na caga, foi ca9ar." (Braga, Cantos, p. 252) In the Piedmontese Parricida, Angelina has killed her father, the king, so that she could marry her lover, and tells her brother the 27 Nigra, Canti, p. 247; G.

Edith Rogers 142 HR, 42 (1974)</page><page sequence="11">The Hunt in the Traditional Ballads father has gone hunting: " 'L papa 1'e andAit a cassa, / a cassa 'n suil MunfrA." The brother, more familiar with the details of hunt- ing, begins to suspect foul play when he sees that the dogs are at home (Nigra, Canti, p. 88). The mother of the Danish Sir Olave delays the disclosure of the news of his death to his bride in the same manner (Prior, Ballads, ii, 304). However, in the corresponding Breton ballad, Count Nann's mother says he went to town.32 Sometimes a secondary figure is identified as a hunter. In some versions of the German Ulinger and in Die verkaufte Miillerin, the brother, a hunter, either saves his sister or avenges her violent death.33 The mother of Dom Pedro Pequenino receives the news of her son's imprisonment from a hunter (Braga, Cantos, p. 257). A hunter tells the king that he saw the princess with Count Claros (Prim. 190 [Men6ndez y Pelayo, Antologia, ix, 135]). However, a Portuguese version of the same romance gives the role of the delator to a page (Braga, Romanceiro geral, p. 80), and, in the Scottish Johnie Cock (Child 114 A), the protagonist is betrayed to the foresters by an old palmer ("silly auld man" [Child 114 D]). THE LOVE-HUNT In none of the foregoing ballads is the hunt motif indispensable. The father of the Infantes de Salas praises also many other qualities such as skill in war and games, generosity, honesty, social graces; Don Bueso is remembered by his sister also in other knightly pas- times; an emperor can talk to his courtiers also on his way to Mass; the husband of an unfaithful wife can be simply away; the husband whose wife is abducted may have gone to war; death can be tempo- rarily concealed by saying a man went to town; an informer can be anybody who happens to pass by. The mention of the hunt adds the color of the period and is more in keeping with best ballad style than an absence for an undetermined reason, but it does not change essentially the type or the tone of the ballad. There are, however, other groups of ballads that derive from the hunt motif their distinguishing character. One of these is the alle- gory of love-the pursuit of a girl translated into the terminology of hunting-that has been assimilated by the traditional poetry of many European countries and appears to be particularly frequent 32 Th. Hersart de La Villemarque, Barzaz-Breiz: Chants populaires de la Bre- tagne, 6th ed.

In these songs, the lyric element often pre- dominates, and their rudimentary plot hardly warrants their inclu- sion in collections of narrative poems. The following song from the French Alps exemplifies the type: De (bon) matin je me prends, je me leve, A la chasse je suis alle; A la chasse des b6casses, Dedans ce bois; J'ai rencontr6 une bergere Qui dormait.34 A Catalan song shows kinship to the French: Matinadas son fresquetas, yo m' en vaig ana a cassa ... No 'n trovo cassa ninguna pera poderli atina; hi ha sino una pastoreta qu' en guardava bestia. Ya 1' en trovo adormideta a la vora d' un canyA, yo 'n cullo un pom de violas y al pit las hi vaig tira. (Mila, Romancerillo, pp. 299-300) The German versions often retain the time of early morning, but the girl is not identified as a shepherdess, and the song is not in the first but the third person: Es wollt' ein Jager jagen Ein Hirschlein oder ein Reh, Drei Stiindlein vor dem Tagen, Ein Hirschlein oder ein Reh.35 One of the rare examples of the love-hunt allegory in Spanish calls the girl a white dove-a traditional metaphor in Spanish poetry: Me cogi la carabina y al monte me fui a cazar, en el monte no cace porque nada pude hallar; s61o una blanca paloma, en un rico palomar. La segui hasta su casa, por saber su voluntad, los padres que lo supieron, la mandaron ocultar; ... -No llores, blanca paloma, no tienes por que llorar, que en volviendo de soldado contigo me he de casar.

Atrevido preguntola, si era casada o soltera. -Casadita soy, sefor, pero mi amor atris queda. (Cosslo and Maza Solano, Romancero, ii, 148) The love allegory lends itself to several local forms. In a Rus- sian bylina, Mikhailo Potyk aims his arrow at a white swan that is swimming on the sea, but the bird asks him not to shoot since she is a beautiful maiden; he takes her along on his horse and marries her (Trautmann, Das Heldenlied, p. 314). Here the allegory is incor- porated into the type of bylina where a bird gives useful advice to a hunter, after asking him to spare its life.36 In a Polish song, the girl is a part of the catch that two hunters divide: "Rabbit and deer for you; sable and girl for me."37 A Lithuanian song, presumably of Polish origin, deals with a hunter who finds no game but discovers a girl asleep in the meadow and tells her it is a hunter's custom to kiss a girl found in the woods (Balys, Folksongs, p. 137). In Denmark, where metaphoric dialogue is not alien to tradi- tional ballads, it is not surprising that the hunt stands for courtship in a conversation between the king and Torkild Trundeson: "I rode to the wood with hawk and hound, "The game for a while I chased, "And every sportsman, who hunts the deer, "Is tempted the time to waste." The king, who does not approve of the match between Torkild and Adelaide, Sir Lave's daughter, replies: "Thou ridest so long in greenwood shaw "A chasing Sir Lave's game, "The deer, thou lovest so well to chase, "The hunter himself will maim." (Prior, Ballads, i, 450) However, the substitution of hunting for wooing was apparently common usage, assimilated by conversational language, from where 36 Cf. Trautmann, Das Heldenlied, pp. 326, 332, 394 (in each, a raven instructs the hero). 37 H. M.

Thus, Gere- naldo, after trysting the princess, tells the king: -Venho de cagar a r6la da outra banda do rio. -"A r6la que tu cagaste ja t'a tinha promettido. (Braga, Cantos, p. 267) Count Claros overrules in like language the lady's attempt to post- pone a tryst: -Bien sabedes vos, seinora, que soy cazador real; caza que tengo en la mano nunca la puedo dejar.- Tomarala por la mano, para un vergel se van. (Prim. 190 [Men6ndez y Pelayo, Antologia, ix, 34]1) In his analysis of the love-hunt in German popular poetry, Meier points out that in medieval artistic poems, where it originated, the allegory was carried out consistently until the end. When, however, the motif was adopted (fourteenth to sixteenth century) and trans- mitted by popular songs, successive changes led to a precipitate iden- tification of the game-usually a hind-as a girl, which rendered the subsequent description of high leaps, etc., absurd: Er jagt wohl durch ein griines Gestrauch, Er jagt ein schwarzbraunes MIadel heraus. 'Du bist ein Jager und fangst mich nicht, Weilt du meine krumme Sprfinge noch nicht.'39 Meier observes further that the symbolic terminology of the hunt ("shooting" and "bringing down") came to be taken literally, and, as a result, the original ending-acceptance or rejection of the suitor -was changed into the death of the girl.40 This change in the in- terpretation is quite in keeping with the conventions of popular ballad language, where an object or action, while it may signify a broader concept, usually retains also its literal meaning. There is 38 The rural "asking of the bride" in many countries refers to her by a zoolog- ical term. 39 Deutsche Volkslieder, ii, 238. 40 Deutsche Volkslieder, 1I, 242. The motif of the wounded deer in Renaissance poetry-a confluence of biblical, classical, medieval, and popular currents-is dis- cussed by M. R. Lida, "Transmisi6n y recreaci6n de temas grecolatinos en la poesia lirica espafiola," RFH, 1 (1939), especially "El ciervo herido y la fuente," pp. 31-52. Edith Rogers 146 HR, 42 (1974)</page><page sequence="15">The Hunt in the Traditional Ballads no doubt that the folk songs in question were understood to deal with an amorous pursuit; but the hunt itself also became a reality, and the symbolic victory of the hunter turned into a kill. In many ballads, the change from deer into girl is altogether omitted. The hunter goes into the forest and finds a girl, as in the Danish Baffled Suitor: The knight took hawk and his swain took hound And off they rode to the hunting ground. And under a linden's dusky shade They found in hiding a lovely maid. (Prior, Ballads, 11, 183) She gets the best of him by riding his horse while he walks, and, upon arrival at her home, leaving him behind the door. The out- come is the same in the Piedmontese Monacella salvata, where a hunter is left waiting under an olive tree by a nun who flees into the convent under the pretext of discarding her habit (Nigra, Canti, p. 444). In the same category is the version of the Spanish Caballero burlado that begins with a hunting scene borrowed from La infantina encantada (Cossfo and Maza Solano, Romancero, I, 119). But the introductory hunt is not an integral part of these pastourelles. The story of El caballero burlado-a girl gets a free ride on the croup and keeps the knight at arm's length by pretending to be a child of lepers -does not mention a hunter in the version known as La hija del rey de Francia ("De Francia partio la nifia" [Prim. 154, 154a: Me- nendez y Pelayo, Antologia, viii, 272, 273]). The theme occurs with- out the hunt motif also in the Piedmontese Occasione mancata (Nigra, Canti, p. 438) and in the British Baffled Knight (Child 112). Evidently the sportive story-a complete ballad in its own right- attracted in many countries the similarly playful motif of the love- hunt.41 However, the countries that produced the combinations of the love-hunt and humorous ballads, use some form of the hunt motif also to preface tragic themes. The Danish Maid in the Wood at first coincides with the Baffled Suitor, above, but then develops into a 41 Some German songs (Erlach, Die Volkslieder, ii, 109; Im, 115; iv, 250) de- velop the encounter in the wood into a ridicule of the man within the milieu of a hunt; the hunter takes the girl to his cabin, but sleeps all night and is mocked by the girl in the morning; she either accepts or scorns his subsequent proposal of marriage. 147</page><page sequence="16">Edith Rogers fight between the knight and the girl's seven brothers, in which all of the men die (Prior, Ballads, II, 234). The Piedmontese Fuga (Nigra, Canti, p. 125) begins with a repartee between a lion-hunting prince and a coquettish shepherdess, but ends in her suicide with his sword-a commonplace pertaining to abduction ballads, as II Corsaro (Nigra, Canti, p. 119). A further example of the great popularity of the love-hunt is found by Erich Seemann in a Dutch version of Der Spielmannssohn -originally the story of a fiddler who escapes the gallows and mar- ries a princess-where the lover of the princess is a hunter (Deutsche Volkslieder, II, 176). Even the unrelated motif of a baby being found by hunters (cf. the Danish Foundling and Axelwold [Prior, Ballads, II, 188, 323]) is combined in a Lithuanian ballad with the love-hunt: a hunter finds a baby girl in a brazen cradle, swings the cradle and kisses the girl; when she grows up, she refuses to marry anyone but him (Balys, Folksongs, p. 171). The numerous-and sometimes incongruous-graftings of the love-hunt motif to various stories show some common traits: (1) The plot of the ballad can be any kind of love story, from a flirt to high tragedy. (2) In most cases, the love-hunt has lost the char- acteristics of an allegory; a hunter simply finds a girl. (3) A rem- nant of the degenerated love-hunt allegory is the occasional implicit or explicit statement that the hunter has found no game ("en vez de encontrar caza / encontro una linda romera," or the Lithuanian hunter who finds no wild beasts). The reason is given plainly in a French song: Quand je vais A la chasse, Ce n'est pas pour chasser, C'est pour aller voir ma tant joli' berg6re Qui est la bas Couch6, sur la fougbre. (Tiersot, Chansons, p. 381) The girl is the game that the hunter sets out to catch in the first place. The suppression of the overt elements of the allegory brings the love-hunt deceptively close to a realistic image, but-although the possibility of meeting a girl during a hunt cannot be ruled out com- pletely-the motif, even in its briefest form, must be considered an outgrowth of a literary invention. In comparison with other motifs, 148 HR, 42 (1974)</page><page sequence="17">The Hunt in the Traditional Ballads for example, the hunt as a reason for absence from home, the amount of corroboration from real-life experience would be slight. The strength of the motif lies in its lyric aspect, which accounts for its widespread use and long survival. The contracted form of the love-hunt does not achieve its effect through the intellectual exercise that was the basis of the original allegory, but through a subconscious transfer of the characteristics of the hunt to the courtship. The dynamic quality of the chase re- verberates in the hunter's wooing; the flight of the game, in the girl's evasiveness. The brevity of the motif leaves no time to solve the mathematical equation; the two images are superimposed. THE OMINOUS HUNT Through a different process, the hunt motif has become also an introduction to death. As explained above, the lyric association of hunting and courtship was originally an intellectually conceived al- legory. On the other hand, the association of hunting and death- equally lyric in its final stage of evolution-has roots in reality, since the hunt used to be a likely occasion for a man to be killed by his enemies. Well known in epic songs, such as the Nibelungenlied,42 the motif of violent death during a hunt occurs also in the immediately following ballads. In Landarico, the king surprises the queen in her room before he goes hunting: Para ir el rey a caza de mafiana ha madrugado, entr6 donde estA la reina sin la haber avisado. The queen, assuming the visitor is her lover Landarico, inadvertently spills the secret; to protect herself and Landarico, she has the king assassinated at his return from the hunt in the dark: Llama a un criado suyo hombre de muy bajo estado, que mate al rey, le dice en habi6ndose apeado, que seria a boca de noche cuando oviese tornado. (Men6ndez y Pelayo, Antologia, Ix, 219) Men6ndez y Pelayo (Antologia, xnI, 488-92) finds in the Historia Francorum that King Chilpericus was murdered in the year 584, at his return from a hunt at nightfall. Popular opinion attributed the 42 See E. von Richthofen, Estudios epicos medievales (Madrid, 1954), pp. 78 ff. and pp. 125 ff. 149</page><page sequence="18">Edith Rogers crime to his wife and her lover Landericus. An analogous case is the German Frau von Weifenburg, presumably based on the murder of the Palatine Friedrich von Goseck in 1085 during a hunt, likewise instigated by his wife and her lover, whom she married after the obligatory period of mourning. Several variants of the ballad de- viate from the chronicle: the lover has to commit the murder with his own hands, since his squire refuses to do it; then, after showing the bloody dagger to the lady, he forsakes her (Deutsche Volkslieder, i, 301 ff.). Whether or not these and other similar ballads reflect historical events, a hunt would be a credible setting for murder. Child finds no record of the specific incident of The Death of Parcy Reed (Child 193), but points out that "almost every circumstance in the narrative exists in tradition" (Ballads, iv, 24). Moreover, the practical details of the preparation for the slaying give the ballad the appearance of a real event: Parcy's enemies invite him to go hunting; when he falls asleep after a tiring day, they put water in his gun, steal his powder horn, jam his sword into the sheath-making it easy for a band of mosstroopers to kill him. No details of the appre- hension of the king are given in the Piedmontese Re prigionero; evi- dently the vulnerability of a hunter is taken for granted: "Lo re Luis no va a la cassa, / no va a la cassa anturn d'Paris. / S'a l'an pia-ro, l'an lia-ro, / l'an mna'lo 'nt la tur d' Paris" (Nigra, Canti, p. 64). In Danish ballads, family feuds reach a bloody settlement when the hostile parties meet in the woods. Three Danish ballads-The Maid in the Wood, Sir Helmer Blaa, and Fair Ellensborg and Sir Olave-end with a fatal clash between the hero and the lady's broth- ers, whose permission to court their sister he has failed to ask (Prior, Ballads, III, 234, 371, 417). Sir Helmer and Sir Olave are further guilty of having slain an uncle of the youths and not paid the pre- scribed fine. In all the foregoing ballads, the hunt is a circumstance that allows the catastrophe to occur, without an accumulation of omens that would presage a disaster: Sir Olave went with hawk and hound In greenwood glade to ride, And in some evil hour there His lady's brother spied. (Prior, Ballads, III, 419) 150 HR, 42 (1974)</page><page sequence="19">The Hunt in the Traditional Ballads On the other hand, the Spanish romances, often dealing with very similar subjects, use the hunt to build up dramatic tension and to create by means of a few details an atmosphere that foreshadows the main event. Such is the hunt of don Rodrigo de Lara, who is in- volved in a blood feud, similar to that of the Danish ballads, for having caused the death of his seven nephews: A caga va don Rodrigo, esse que dizen de Lara; perdido avia los agores, no halla ninguna caca; con la gran siesta que hace arrim6se a una haya.43 These verses express in a capsule the doom of the hunter. He has lost his falcons-not only invaluable aids in hunting, but, as shown previously, the emblems of a knight, participants in his character and fate, sometimes endowed with supernatural powers of protect- ing their master. He has found no game; he has been marked as a loser. He leans against a beech tree; evidently he is alone and weary, but his withdrawal from the active chase means also that he is giving up the control of events; he turns himself over to fate. Under these circumstances, his vow to kill Mudarra is not a promise but a last, futile protest. When Mudarra arrives, with a courteous greet- ing and a formal introduction, he has the role of an executer of a death sentence, already pronounced.44 In the more concise variants, the romance ends with the imminent, not the accomplished fact: "Aqui moriras, traidor, / enemigo de dofia Sancha."45 Since the intro- ductory verses have determined don Rodrigo's fate, there is no doubt as to the outcome. Menendez Pidal, reconstructing the epic of the Infantes de Salas from chronicles, points out the process of poetic selection. The un- fortunate hunt was a detailed incident in the epic: don Rodrigo sent his falcon after a heron, but both birds disappeared in the clouds; while he and his men searched for the falcon, the troops of his pur- suer arrived and engaged in a fight with those of don Rodrigo.46 The romance makes of the mass scene an intimate encounter between two 43 R.

Very similar is the beginning of a romance from a different cycle, La penitencia de don Rodrigo, in a modern version from Asturias: Don Rodrigo fue a caza, a caza como solia. Non encontr6 cosa muerta nin tampoco cosa viva. La traidora de la muerte n'el camino le salia. iAy de mi, triste isgraciado! yo confesarme queria. (Menendez Pidal, Romancero tradicional, I, 72) The sixteenth-century text says nothing about a hunt; the king through whose fault his realm has fallen into Moorish hands, is shown as a fugitive: Despues que el rey don Rodrigo a Espafia perdido habia, ibase desesperado por donde mas le placia. M6tese por las montafias las mas espesas que habia, porque no le hallen los moros que en su seguimiento iban. (Prim. 7 [Men4ndez y Pelayo, Antologia, vIII, 12]) Like the final episode of the cycle of the Infantes de Salas, this is a story of a guilty man, about to meet his just punishment. La peni- tencia de don Rodrigo, in the late version, has lost most of the rambl- ing narrative of the minstrel ballad; it highlights the king's penitence -being buried alive with a snake. The initial verses have de- veloped into a variant of the dismal hunt, which retains the mood of loneliness and despair, but, at the same time, signals the point of no return: King Rodrigo fails to see anything, dead or alive, on his path; he has been expelled from the world. The addition of the hunt motif cannot be dismissed as a simple case of mobility of a commonplace, attracted-one might say-by the name Rodrigo. Not only does the dismal hunt express more forcefully the mood of the earlier introduction, but the elements that are condensed into the poetic motif in the previous two ballads can be found in similar situations in a low-keyed form. Another guilty king, Pedro el Cruel, receives during a hunt the message of doom: Por los campos de Jerez a caza va el rey don Pedro; en llegando a una laguna, allf quiso ver un vuelo. Vido volar una garza, despar61e un sacre nuevo, remontarale un nebli, a sus pies cayera muerto. A sus pies cay6 el nebli, tuvolo por mal agiiero. Tanto volaba la garza, parece llegar al cielo. (Prim. 66a [MAenendez y Pelayo, Antologia, vIII, 128]) 152 HR, 42 (1974)</page><page sequence="21">The Hunt in the Traditional Ballads From the point where the heron rises, descends a shepherd, weeping and sighing. He is hairy all over, unkempt, his feet full of thorns; he carries a snake, a bloody dagger, a shroud, a skull, and has a black dog on a leash. After enumerating don Pedro's crimes, he proph- esies a violent death, and disappears. This systematic list of omens, accompanied by an explanation, is, in essence, a rational counterpart of the dismal hunt. Somewhat similar is the Danish "long ballad" of Mar Stig, about King Erick, who has abducted Lady Ingeborg, the wife of the mar- shal. Ingeborg's nephew, Ranild, entices the king to go hunting and leads him along a lonely road: They hunted stag, they hunted hind, They chased the fleeting roe, They stay'd so long, that at the last They saw the daylight go. (Prior, Ballads, II, 205) They find a hut, with a cheerful fire and a lovely maid inside. The maid laughs off the king's amorous overture, makes an enigmatic prophecy about the length of his life, and vanishes together with her cozy abode. The king is led by Ranild to a barn and is slain there by Lady Ingeborg's men. Prior observes that "the phantasm in the wood ... is certainly one of the finest impersonations of a guilty conscience to be found in the whole range of ballad poetry" (Ballads, II, 195-96). Considering the clerical origins of many bal- lads, such an interpretation is not baseless. At the same time, the uncanny maid blends easily into the host of fairy creatures that in- habit the woods and are wont to step into a hunter's path. This happens to Tam Lin (Child 39 A): 'And ance it fell upon a day, A cauld day and a snell, When we were frae the hunting come, That frae my horse I fell; The Queen o Fairies she caught me, In yon green hill to dwell.' Also the Danish Dwarf-King's daughter, who binds Sir Tonn6 with the music of her golden harp, appears to him during a hunt: Sir Tonn6 off to the green-wood rode To chase the hind and hare, And there the Dwarf-King's daughter met With other maidens fair. (Prior, Ballads, in, 10) 153</page><page sequence="22">Edith Rogers Surprisingly, the hunt motif (very frequent in Denmark) does not appear, except as a feigned excuse for the dead groom's absence, in the Danish Sir Olave-a ballad that has Breton and Spanish counterparts where the hero's hunt plays an important role.47 The Breton Count Nann sets out to get venison for his wife, who has given birth to twins; he follows a white hind until nightfall and dis- mounts to drink from a spring, where he finds a korrigan (forest fairy) combing her hair with a golden comb; since he refuses to marry her, he must die, but his death is kept secret from his wife until she discovers it on the day of her churching (La Villemarqu6, Chants, p. 25). While the second part-the delay of the news of the death-contains the same elements in most European versions, the hero's death is given different causes. In France, he usually re- turns from war, mortally wounded (Doncieux, Le Romancero, p. 87). As Doncieux points out, the French singers have stripped the Breton gwerz of all the marvelous elements.48 Even if the hero returns from a hunt with a fatal injury, as in the Piedmontese Morte occulta (E), the event does not pass the limits of reality: "Ven de la cassa lo re Rinald, / ven da la cassa, l'e tilt feri."49 A Sephardic version of the corresponding Spanish romance, La muerte ocultada, does contain a supernatural occurrence, but quite different from the Breton ballad: Levant6se Uezo lunes de mafiana, tomara sus armas, fu6rase a la caza. En un prado verde sent6se a almorzare; alli viera Uezo muy negra sefiale ... Firi6 Uezo al Huerco en el calcafiale, firio el Huerco a Uezo en su voluntade; firi6 Uezo al Huerco con su rica espada, firi6 el Huerco a Uezo en telas del alma ... 50 47 Prior, Ballads, In, 301: Sir Olave, on his way to his bride, is caught in the forest by a dancing dwarf-maid, who offers him a great many gifts if he will live with her; his refusal brings him death. 48 La Villemarque, Chants, p. 122. A wound in the war occurs also in Nigra (Canti, pp. 164, 166; Variants D, F, G) and Men6ndez y Pelayo (Antologia, x, 177). 49 Nigra, Canti, p. 165. However, in a fairy tale (ibid., p. 169), a hunter finds a splendidly dressed woman-a fairy-who wants to marry him and punishes him for his refusal by giving him a box that contains a belt that flares up and kills him. 60 Men6ndez Pidal, "Romancero judio-espafiol," No. 75, p. 165; also Benichou, "Romances ...," p. 325. 154 HR, 42 (1974)</page><page sequence="23">The Hunt in the Traditional Ballads Men6ndez Pidal believes that Huerco (the Latin Orcus, god of death and the underworld) belongs to the early peninsular forms of this romance. Derivations of the word huerco mean in Asturias and Gali- cia a harbinger of death, that appears in various forms-white or black dog, specter, wraith.51 The motif has undergone various mu- tations. In one variant, a process of rationalization has changed a letter in the word and made of the spirit a pig or boar (puerco): Estando don Hueso un dia a cazar, de que no vido a nadie se puso a merendar. Y ya que vido un puerco emporcando el rio, se levant6 don Hueso y le ha tirado un tiro: al puerco le ha dado en el corbej6n, y a don Hueso le ha dado en el corazon. (Men6ndez Pidal, "Romancero judfo-espafiol," p. 166) In modern versions from Asturias, don Pedro is stricken with fatal illness during his hunt: A cazar iba don Pedro, a cazar como solfa, los perros lleva cansados y el halc6n perdido habia. Di6rale el mal de la muerte; para casa se volvfa. (Men6ndez y Pelayo, Antologia, x, 111) Or he meets Death personified: A cazar iba don Pedro por esos montes arriba; caminara siete leguas sin encontrar cosa viva, si no fuera cuervos negros, que los perros no querian. Ape6se a descansar al pie de una seca encina; caia la nieve a copos y el agua menuda y fria. Alleg6sele la Muerte a tenerle compafia.52 The last two variants show a marked similarity to the romances of the death of don Rodrigo de Lara and the penitence of King Rodrigo, above. The original episode of action has been replaced by a lyric motif. Life quietly turns away from the hunter in the solitude of a mysterious forest. One by one, the positive, vital elements of his existence desert him: no game in sight; dogs tired; falcon lost; his 51 C.

(Buenos Aires. 1962), p. 195; Men6ndez Pidal places this version into the late seventeenth century, Also in a few French variants, the hero meets Death in person. In a Venetian version (Jewett, Folk-Ballads, p. 90), he is bitten by a can barbin. 155</page><page sequence="24">Edith Rogers own strength ebbing; instead of sunlight, snow and freezing rain.53 Compared with this dark, ominous silence, the fight with Huerco during the lunch hour seems much more matter-of-fact, almost rational; even though he ends up as the loser, the man has at least a chance to defend himself. In the later versions, there is no fight, no action. Alone and weary at the foot of an oak-and even the oak is dry-man succumbs to an invisible enemy. The poetic image of the approach of death evidently became pre- ferable and displaced the narrative in La muerte ocultada, as it dis- placed the explanation of the aimless wandering of King Rodrigo. The dismal hunt, which only in the romance of Don Rodrigo de Lara seems to be a direct outgrowth of the facts in the original story, has become a suggestive introduction, deemed suitable for many ro- mances that deal with death. The connection is very loose between the hunting scene and the narrative in the Romance de Rico Franco: A caza iban, a caza los cazadores del rey, ni fallaban ellos caza, ni fallaban que traer. Perdido habian los halcones jmal los amenaza el rey! Arrim?ranse a un castillo que se llamaba Maynds. Dentro estaba una doncella muy fermosa y muy cortes; siete condes la demandan, y asi facian tres reyes. Robarala Rico Franco, Rico Franco aragon6s. (Prim. 119 [Men6ndez y Pelayo, Antologia viI, 233]) B6nichou ("Romances ...," pp. 313-14) points out that, to tie the two parts together, one has to assume that the abductor Rico Franco was one of the hunters, even though this is neither stated nor im- plied in the romance; also that the Sephardic version is even more in- coherent, letting the father give his much-wooed daughter to a rico fraile. It is customary to include Rico Franco in the long list of European ballads of the Lady Isabel and the Elf-Knight and the Hale- wijn-Ulinger group, since the abducted girl kills Rico Franco with his own knife. One might assume that the European story at- tracted in Spain the hunting scene-a favorite introduction to ro- mances that end in death. At closer scrutiny, however, Rico Franco has more in common with the German Bluthochzeit, a ballad of con- siderable age, found in the Rhine area and among German settlers 63 The lines, "Caia la nieve a copos / y el agua menuda y fria," have an isolated counterpart in the capture of Tam Lin (Child 39) by the Queen of Fairies on "a cauld day and a snell." 156 HR, 42 (1974)</page><page sequence="25">The Hunt in the Traditional Ballads in Transylvania: Friihmorgens der Pfalzgraf zum Waidwerk reit', viel Diener und Knappen in seinem Geleit. Or, another variant: Es fuhr sich ein Pfalzgraf wohl uiber den Rhein, Viel RoB und Jager wohl un ihn sein. (Deutsche Volkslieder, II, 159) In some versions, the girl is a princess; in some newer ones, a miller's daughter. The Count Palatine kills her parents and three brothers, and takes her along against her will-two important details that coincide with Rico Franco, but are not found in the Halewijn series. Nor is there any indication that Rico Franco is anything more than an abductor by force; he is not shown to have any natural or super- natural appeal like that of the elf-knight, Halewijn, or their human successors in balladry, which would lure the girl into his power. In fact, the killing of the abductor by the girl is the only major motif that sets Rico Franco apart from Bluthochzeit, where the girl becomes the abductor's wife.54 Those German texts that begin with the Palatine's hunt show a resemblance to Rico Franco precisely in a de- tail that distinguishes the hunt motif from the usual form in each country: the hunters are many ("los cazadores del rey," "viel Diener und Knappen in seinem Geleit," "viel RoB und Jager wohl um ihn sein"). In other Spanish romances where the hunt leads to death, the hunter is alone; likewise alone is the stereotyped German hunter who finds a girl in the forest. Thus, the foreign ballad that inspired Rico Franco was not necessarily a member of the Halewijn group, but possibly a version of Bluthochzeit, on which the girl's revenge was grafted. A similar denouement is found also in other Spanish romances, such as Venganza de honor or Hija de la viudina, and is perhaps more in keeping with the poetic justice favored in the Romancero. The initial brief hunt motif may have assimilated the typically Spanish elaboration of the unlucky hunt-not finding any game, losing the falcons. Considering that the Spanish version con- cludes with the death of the abductor, the ominous hunt has to the main theme an undeniable-though irrational-affinity. 54 In some later versions, believed to be contaminated by Graf Friedrich, the Palatine discovers on the wedding night that his bride is dead; in some texts, also he dies. On the relationship between Rico Franco and Bluthochzeit, see my article, "A New Genealogy for 'Rico Franco,"' JAF, 82 (1969), 369-73. 157</page><page sequence="26">Edith Rogers The introductory motif of the unlucky hunt would be compar- able to a prologue in the theater or an emblematic song that creates the appropriate mood in the audience before the curtain rises. The purpose of the hunt motif is to suggest that the protagonist has en- tered the realm of an unknown fate against which he is powerless. This impression is achieved in two ways simultaneously: the failure in the hunt symbolizes the hunter's defeat in the subsequent action, and the association of the hunt and the dark forest with many kinds of supernatural beings (some of these have been and others will be discussed) evokes the presence of unfathomable forces. Outside Spain, one can find some of the component parts of the ominous hunt, for example, in the silver wood where Child Maurice (Child 83 A) hunts and is later slain by his mother's husband: Childe Maurice hunted ithe siluer wood, He hunted itt round about, And noebodye that he ffound therin, Nor none there was with-out. The foresters take Johnie Cock (Child 114) by surprise as he and his hounds are in deep sleep after drinking the blood of a dun deer. The scene resembles somewhat the rest in the woods and the vul- nerability of some Spanish protagonists, but Johnie's hunt was suc- cessful and there is no clear hint of a participation by supernatural powers, even though the latter could be easily attributed to the dun deer. SUPERNATURAL AND ENCHANTED CREATURES IN THE WOODS An animal, usually an elusive deer, is in many European ballads something more than seems to the hunter who begins to chase it. The white hind that lures Count Nann, in the Breton ballad, to the korrigan's abode is undoubtedly a messenger from fairyland.55 The long Marques de Mantua is non-committal as to the nature of the deer that appears to the hunters while they are resting in a grove. They release their hounds and rush after the game; at nightfall, the marquis finds himself alone in a dense forest, caught in a thunder- storm; he blows his horn, but his companions are too far to hear it; 55 La Villemarque, Chants, p. 26.

This romance contains in dilated form several of the elements that make up the familiar omi- nous hunt motif, with some meaningful complements. Even before the lonely hunter is overtaken by night and ill weather, there are some verses that, according to the conventions of the Romancero, point toward an extraordinary-possibly supernatural-event. The hunt is on the seashore on the eve of St. John: De Mantua salio el marqu6s Dan6s Urgel el leal: alil va a buscar la caza a las orillas del mar ... El tiempo era caluroso, vfspera era de Sant Juan. (Prim. 165 [Men6ndez y Pelayo, Antologia, ix, 29]) Considering the context, also the escaping deer is in all likelihood meant to be of supernatural character. There is no doubt that the hog that appears before Fernan Goin- zalez is a divine messenger: El conde FernAn Gonzalez cabe la villa de Lara, mientra la gente se junta salese a buscar la caza. Dentro en los robles del monte un puerco se levantara, tras 61 arremete el conde de los suyos se alejaba. (Men6ndez y Pelayo, Antologia, ix, 180) The hog takes refuge at the altar in a hermitage; Fernan Gonzalez is met by a monk in white robes, who foretells him the victory over Almanzor; after the prophecy has come true, Fernan Gonzalez gives his share of the booty to build the church of San Pedro de Arlanza. J. P. Keller relates this romance to legends of saints that tell of ani- mals bearing a flaming cross on the forehead, for example, the deer that appeared to St. Eustace.56 But in other ballads one can also find animals with religious credentials. Digenis, the Greek hero, tells his friends he has to die because he killed a deer that had a cross on the antlers, a star on the head, and on the shoulder blade the 66 "The Hunt and Prophecy Episode of the Poema de Fernan Gonzdlez," HR, 23 (1955), 251-58, and "El misterioso origen de FernAn Gonzalez," NRFH, 10 (1956), 41-44. J. de Onis adds to this genre a unicorn with a flaming horn, "El celo de los duendes: Una variante americana del romance del Conde Olinos," CA, 23 (1964), 219-29. La Villemarqu6, (Chants, p. 13) tells of the pre-Christian cult of the wild sow in the Bretagne and of a vision in which an angel ordered a church built wherever a wild sow with young was found.</page><page sequence="28">Edith Rogers picture of the Holy Virgin.57 A particular type of animal is the hare that Sir Jonas and Sir Nilus are chasing on Easter Sunday in the Danish Sabbath Breaking. The hare foretells Nilus' failure in the hunt and death of his comrade; indeed, the friends kill each other in a quarrel, and even their horses and hounds follow suit.58 The subject matter of this ballad exists also in Basque folklore in Spain. Eiztari-beltza (the black hunter)-a species of the Wild Huntsman active on stormy nights-is a priest who has left his Mass unfinished, to join his hounds in the chase of a hare, and is condemned to run forever, without reaching the game. The hare is sometimes said to be the Devil himself, at other times a witch.59 However, the Christian reinterpretation, which made of the ancient Woden's chase an aid to sermons, has failed to reach many other kinds of marvelous hunts and animals. The deer that in the Scandinavian Power of the Harp lures all the members of the wed- ding procession, including the groom, away, letting the bride fall into the hands of a water-sprite, is clearly in the service of the non- Christian world of nature spirits (Prior, Ballads, II, 285). Also in a Bulgarian ballad, a deer appears to a wedding party and ushers in the catastrophe: the bridegroom, left alone with the bride, tries to kiss her (in other variants, to free her veil from a branch or to cut an apple); his knife, or sword, disengages itself and wounds the bride fatally (Deutsche Volkslieder, in, 210). The hero of a German epic, Wolfdietrich, and his men set out to chase a deer whose antlers are wound with gold, sent to them by Drasian, who uses the opportunity to abduct Wolfdietrich's wife Sigeminne (Deutsche Volkslieder, v, 41-42). In the Romancero, there is a certain ambivalence toward such prodigious deer. On the one hand, the minstrels were obviously at- tracted to the motif, but at the same time, they subdued the pagan connections. In Eneas y Dido-doubtless the work of somebody familiar with the Aeneid-the hunters rush after a swift deer and leave the protagonists alone: Eneas que esto contaba, un ciervo que parecia: ech6 mano a su aljaba, una saeta le tira. El golpe le dio en vano, el ciervo muy bien corria. Partense los cazadores, siguelo el que mis podia; la reina Dido y Eneas quedaron sin compafia.

Yet there is no indication that the animal was dispatched by the god- dess. This deer and the one in the Marques de Mantua are typical examples of the equivocal supernatural element in the Romancero- possibly an intermediate stage between the marvelous and the ra- tional, as well as a compromise between classical scholarship and Christian doctrine. As an exception, the Romance de Lanzarote has retained the magic character of its Breton heritage: Tres hijuelos habfa el rey, tres hijuelos, que no mAs; por enojo que hubo de ellos todos maldito los ha. El uno se torn6 ciervo, el otro se torn6 can, el otro se torn6 moro, pas6 las aguas del mar. Also the dangers surrounding the white-footed deer are recorded in the romance: Por aquf paso esta noche dos horas antes del dia, siete leones con 61 y una leona parida. Siete condes deja muertos y mucha caballerfa.60 Transformation into an animal, rare in the Romancero, is a com- mon occurrence in European balladry. In The Three Ravens (Child 26), the fallow doe is identified as the slain knight's leman: Downe there comes a fallow doe, As great with yong as she might goe. She lift vp his bloudy hed, And kist his wounds that were so red. She got him vp vpon her backe, And carried him to earthen lake. She buried him before the prime, She was dead herselfe ere even-song time. God send euery gentleman, Such haukes, such hounds, and such a leman. There is a hint of the same phenomenon in the request the lady makes of Leesome Brand (Child 15) to "hunt the deer and roe" 60 Prim. 147 (Men6ndez y Pelayo, Antologia, vIII, 263). Cf. the feats and fatal hunt of Lemminkainen in the Kalevala. 161</page><page sequence="30">Edith Rogers while she gives birth to their child, but not to touch the white hind, "for she is o the woman kind." He hunts with such pleasure that he forgets the lady, until he sees the milk-white hind, turns back, and finds both mother and child dead.6' The identity of the white hind is clearly stated in the French Marguerite ou la blanche biche: "J'ai bien grande ire en moi, et n'ose vous le dire: Je sui fille sur jour et la nuit blanche biche. La chasse est apres moi, les barons et les princes." (Doncieux, Le Romancero, p. 235) Renaud does not heed his mother's plea to refrain from chasing the white hind; the slain animal is found to have blond hair and the breast of a girl; when Renaud, back in the castle, asks for his sister, she speaks to him from a dish on the banquet table. Doncieux at- tributes this poem to a prototype from Scandinavia, where, indeed, such ballads abound. Besides the Maiden Hind,62 essentially the same as the French story, there is one about a girl changed by her stepmother into a white hind, who, to escape the hounds of her fiance, Sir Orm, turns into a hawk and recovers her human shape when Sir Orm offers her a slice of flesh from his own breast. In another ballad, the stepmother turns the brother into a wolf, the sister into a nightingale; the brother regains his human form by drinking the stepmother's blood; the sister, by a series of trans- formations similar to those of Tam Lin (Child 39), culminating in a cut by her brother's knife. Another maid is turned by her step- mother into scissors, a sword-blade, and finally a werewolf, and casts off the spell by drinking her unborn stepbrother's blood. Besides such bloody sacrifices, there is a different method of disenchantment: the youth kisses a linden tree and turns it into a beautiful maiden, likewise a victim of her stepmother. Most of the time, however, kissing is equal to a heroic act, since the temporary shape is anything but inviting. Sir Jenus has to kiss a snake, and Signelille a dragon, in order to unspell a prospective mate (Prior, Ballads, iii, 125, 119, 114, 140, 135, 132). Thus, disenchantment is accomplished by courage and by love, or perhaps more precisely, by the courage to love. This large group of ballads about disenchantment has a some- what anomalous representative in Spain-La infantina e cantada. 61 Cf. Willie and Earl Richard's Daughter (Child 102). 62 A.

The deer asks the hunter not to shoot but to marry her, since she is a girl enchanted by her father for a year and a day: Al passant d' un' arboleda qu' es Earboleda] molt linda; que las truncas son de oro, las ramas de plata fina; al mitx d' aquell' arboleda n' hi ha una font tan linda, a n'el mitx d' aquella font [n' hi ha] un c6rvol que hi bevia: "Cassad6, '1 bon cassad6, mirame y no me tiris, no som c6rvol, cassad6, no som c6rvol que som nina, Qu' el meu padre m' ha encantada sols per un any y un dia. (Mila, Romancerillo, p. 174) The hunter wants to ask his mother for advice, and the deer-girl utters the imprecation usual in this romance. In a short version, the girl is a snake drinking from a fountain: ... No so serp que so una niia Yo ser6 la tev' aymia de la nit fins en el dia. Mes a'luego no podria, el meu pare ho sabria. (Mila, Romancerillo, p. 174) There is no speaking animal in the Spanish and Portuguese versions. The romance begins with a shorter or longer form of the dismal hunt motif-hounds tired, falcon lost, nightfall, sometimes also snow and freezing rain, a weary hunter resting against a tree. The tree is of gold and silver; as the hunter lifts his eyes, he sees on the highest bough a beautiful girl combing her long hair with a golden comb. A Sephardic version unites most of the significant features: A cazar iba el caballero, a cazar como solfa, los perros iban cansados y el halcon perdido habia. jAnde le cogi6 la noche? En una oscura montina ande canta la leona y el le6n le respondia, ande cae la nieve a copos y corrfa el agua frfa. En el asomirase a un pino, alto es a maravilla, la raiz es de oro y las hojas de plata fina: en el pimpollo mas alto vido estar a una infantita: cabello de su cabeza todo aquel roble cubria, los ojos de la su cara la montafa esclarecfan, los dientes de la su boca alj6fares parecian.63 63 Larrea Palacin, Romances, 11, 54-55. Ferrets have been substituted for falcons on the Canary Islands (P6rez Vidal, "Romancero ...," p. 278) and the Azores (Braga, Cantos, p. 188). 163</page><page sequence="32">Edith Rogers The girl tells the knight she has been enchanted by seven fairies, but her seven years are up and she is ready to go with him as wife, mis- tress, or slave. The faint-hearted knight hurries home to ask his mother for advice, and finds on his return that the infanta has been carried off by somebody else. For his failure, he decrees his own punishment, usually tantamount to death. The Infantina encantada is a fusion of several ballad themes and motifs: (1) A hunter fails in his hunt-the typically Spanish dismal hunt motif. (2) A hunter finds a girl-a contraction of the love- hunt allegory. (3) A girl, combing her hair, is waiting for a man. (4) An enchanted girl expects to be saved through love. (5) A man fails because of indecision. Despite the conventionality of the separate parts, there is a discord in the combination. Already the unlucky hunt, which usually heralds death, may seem at first glance misplaced, since the knight's tragedy is his failure to find the infanta, not his rhetorical exclamation about the death that he deserves. In fact, the latter is missing in some shorter versions. However, this slight-and only seeming-inconsistency will be explained shortly. The most stymying question is: Why does the hunter hesitate? One might say that the infanta must have been a fairy, sitting in the middle of a lonely forest as she was, combing her long hair with a golden comb and offering herself with the sole condition of being taken along. Particularly the anomalous Portuguese version where Dom Joao hears lovely singing and sees a girl combing her hair at a pond (Braga, Romanceiro geral, p. 26), resembles the scene with the korrigan in Villemarqu&amp;s version of the Breton Count Nann. In fact, the beginning of La infantina, grafted on La muerte ocultada, would produce a hybrid very close to the Breton poem. But then, Count Nann recognized the woman immediately as a fairy, and her revenge was in keeping with her supernatural character. Sooner or later such non-human beings will reveal their origins. In a Basque tale, compared by Caro Baroja to the Romance de la infantina en- cantada, a lamina (mythological non-human female) dressed in gold, proposes marriage to a shepherd and, like the knight in the romance, he goes to ask his mother. On his return he finds the lamina comb- ing her hair, but-unlike the knight in the romance-he notices that she has the feet of a goose. Also unlike the romance, but in keeping with the usual reaction of a rejected fairy, is his subsequent illness 164 HR, 42 (1974)</page><page sequence="33">The Hunt in the Traditional Ballads 165 and death.64 In the romance, the only punishment is the disappoint- ment and self-inflicted suffering of the knight. Also the successful departure of the infanta (in some versions with her father) points toward her human nature. It would further be very irregular for a fairy to pretend that she has been enchanted by fairies. To sit in trees is nothing unusual for ballad ladies, whether be- witched or not. Sir Lionel (Child 18) finds on a hunting trip the lady of a slain knight in a tree: "And as he rode still on the plaine / He saw a lady sitt in a graine." Also in a Greek prose tale, mixed with a few verses, a prince falls in love with a princess who is sitting in a tree; an old woman coaxes her down by sifting flour through a reversed sieve (Deutsche Volkslieder, iv, 144). The hideous lady whom Sir Gawain (Child 31) eventually unspells makes her first appearance "betwixt an oke and a green hollen." The monster in Kemp Owyne (Child 34 A) is not sitting in a tree, but her long hair is "twisted thrice about the tree." Since disenchantment-even disenchantment by love-is usu- ally the result of an act of courage, a man sometimes loses his chance because his courage fails him. In a Scottish tradition, the unearthly sounds of the fairy cavalcade at Halloween kept a farmer from re- trieving his wife (Child, Ballads, i, 336). In another tradition, a queen who has been turned into a huge toad can be disenchanted by a man who arrives on the one Christmas Eve in seven when the cave is open and performs several feats that climax in kissing the toad three times; but all who have tried, have either fallen into a trance or lost their courage (Child, Ballads, I, 311). According to a Portu- guese tradition, which has given rise to the Moira Encantada, a beautiful girl appears on the eve of St. John, at midnight, in the Moorish castle of Tavira and begs to be disenchanted. In the ro- mance, Dom Ramiro fails to gain her because the ascent on the wall is too difficult and the hour of disenchantment is up before he reaches the summit (Braga, Romanceiro geral, p. 107). But most ballads have a hero who overcomes such obstacles. How pseudo-animals are returned to their human shape by bloody sacrifice or a kiss was described earlier. Often a beautiful girl has 64 Caro Baroja, Algunos mitos, p. 54. Also other non-human women are rec- ognizable by some irregularity; see the legends "La dama pie de cabra" and "La mujer marina" (Men6ndez y Pelayo, Antologia, xII, 52-54). Nevertheless, the hunters who found the goat-footed lady and the siren were eager to marry them.</page><page sequence="34">Edith Rogers been changed into a hideous hag, but Kemp Owyne (Child 34) is brave enough to give such a monster the three saving kisses; Sir Gawain (Child 31) is willing to marry one; King Henry (Child 32) slays his steed, his hounds, and his hawks to feed the "grisly ghost," and finally lets her bed down with him. These three knights carry away the prize-the beautiful lady they have unspelled. In his dis- cussions of the three ballads, Child lists a large number of tales, medieval romances, and an Icelandic saga of similar content, and concludes that "tales resembling the Marriage of Gawain must have been widely spread during the iMiddle Ages (Ballads, I, 292). Also in the Irish legend of The Enchanted Fawn, Lugaid Laigde volun- teers when a loathly hag demands that one of the young knights sleep with her; she turns into a beautiful woman, who tells him she is the Kingship of Alba (Scotland) and Erin.65 The perplexing feature in La infantina is that the girl already is as beautiful as any knight may wish. In this case it would be natural for her to be surrounded by unsurmountable difficulties, as in the Moira Encantada, above, or by dangers such as the bear and the lion who have guarded a lady for seven years but submit to the courage- ous Young Svejdal in a Danish ballad.66 In short, a knight normally performs an act of courage and gets his lady. Of the knight in La infantina no such act is required; he could have the lovely girl on his own terms. The reason for the knight's vacillation remains unex- plained. Perhaps he lacked the qualifications that are listed in the introductory stanza of King Henry (Child 32)-the story of a man who succeeds on every count where the knight in the romance fails: Lat never a man a wooing wend That lacketh thingis three; A routh of gold, an open heart, Ay fu o charity. A comparison with King Henry clarifies, at least, the function of the introductory hunt motif in La infantina. Before King Henry is visited by the monster whom he proceeds to unspell, he triumphs as a hunter: He chas'd the deer now him before, An the roe down by the den. Till the fattest buck in a' the flock King Henry he has slain. 65 K. Hoagland, 1000 Years of Irish Poetry (New York, 1953), p. 66. 66 Olrik, Danish Ballads, p. 120. The linden tree with silvery leaves that shelters the lady's bower bends down to earth when Young Svejdal makes his entrance-a setting vaguely similar to that of La infantina. 166 HR, 42 (1974)</page><page sequence="35">The Hunt in the Traditional Ballads Also Lugaid Laigde and his brothers have just caught their father's enchanted fawn and eaten it, when the future bride enters in the shape of a hideous hag. A successful hunt heralds in these poems the successful disenchantment of a lady. This tends to disagree with the hypothesis of Daniel Devoto, in his discussion of La infantina and other ballads, that the hunter who finds a girl has been preoc- cupied with, or disposed toward, a girl-in violation of a primitive hunting taboo-and, therefore, cannot catch any game (p. 490). Rather, the introductory motif of the unlucky hunt is, besides other things, a symbolic paraphrase of the story that follows, as it was in the romances that dealt with death. Fortune has turned her back on the hunter; he loses his falcon, wears out his dogs and himself, and, analogously, loses his chance to win a lady. Thus, there is no dis- crepancy between the function of the hunt motif in this romance and in the others discussed earlier. The futile hunt is the beginning of the disintegration of the knight. INTUITIVE GRAFTING: THE HUNT AS A THRESHOLD TO AN IMAGINARY WORLD If, however, the hunting scene were only an allegorical summary of the subsequent narrative, it is doubtful that it could have become and stayed as popular as it has. To people such as those of northern Spain, where the hunt motif has been fostered, the mystery of a dark forest is a part of actual experience. While there is noticeable re- ticence toward the explicit mention of supernatural occurrences, the suggestive elements of the hunting scene, which create a super- natural atmosphere, are freely elaborated. In versions from Asturias and Santander, the introductory hunt and the description of the girl, taken from La infantina, stop short before the motif of the seven-year enchantment, and change into the sportive romance of El caballero burlado-not alien to the original outcome, since here, too, the knight misses his chance (believing the girl's story of being the child of lepers or some other deterrent).67 Even though the plot stays within rational boundaries, the details of the initial scene are retained. Instead of the lion and lioness who sing to each other in 67 The fusion of the two romances dates back to the sixteenth century (Prim. 154a [Mentndez y Pelayo, Antologia, viii, 273]; see also x, 89, and Cossio and Maza Solano, Romancero, I, 119). Many Portuguese versions add the ending of a third romance, Don Bueso, with the recognition between brother and sister, but tend to retain the motif of enchantment by seven fairies (Braga, Romanceiro geral, pp. 26, 28; Cantos, pp. 183, 185, 188). 167</page><page sequence="36">the Sephardic Infantina, a variant of El caballero burlado has verses about singing snakes, typical of Asturian romances: "Donde canta la culebra, / responde la serpentina."68 A version from Catalonia that omits the girl's declaration of being enchanted, contains, never- theless, her offer to become the knight's wife, mistress, or servant, as well as the ominous hunt and the resplendent forest: No trova perdfu ni dayna ni cassa morta ni viva. Passa per una arboleda que tota 1' en relujia.69 While, as stated earlier, the frequency of the hunt motif as a knight's pastime and as a reason for a man's absence from home has declined, the introductory motif of the lonely, futile hunt has evi- dently not only survived but gained popularity. It is used even in ballads that only halfway warrant the creation of an ominous atmo- sphere. La esposa de don Garcia is a case in point. It is not a tragic romance; the husband whose wife has been abducted by the Moors retrieves her unscathed. That the husband should be hunting when the abductors arrive is an international commonplace, as was shown earlier. However, the singers of the romance have enlarged the simple explanation of the husband's absence into a sinister hunting scene that culminates in his receiving the ill news-in one variant from a bird: A cazar iba, a cazar, el infante don Garcia; a cazar iba, a cazar por unas sierras arriba, donde cae la nieve a copos, donde cae el agua fria, donde nace la culebra, la sierpe la respondia. Lleg6le la oscura noche en una triste montifia. Arrim6se a un duro tronco, al mds gordo que alli habia, y en la ramita m6s alta un ave asi le decia: --Vulvase el conde a su casa, el infante don Garcia, porque a su esposa la llevan moros por sierras arriba. (Cossio and Maza Solano, Romancero, i, 41) The Spanish motif, in this particular function, has a Scottish parallel in Little Musgrave and Lady Barnard (Child 81 G), where Lord Barnard has gone "to hunt the fallow deer" and is found in the dark 68 Men6ndez y Pelayo, Antologia, x, 90 (cf. "donde canta la culebra, / donde la culebra canta" [p. 80], "... una fuente fria, / do culebras cantan [p. 58])." 69 MilA, Romancerillo, p. 175. Also here the lady is combing her hair, but her beauty is elaborated by a description of her splendid clothing. 168 Edith Rogers HR, 42 (1974)</page><page sequence="37">The Hunt in the Traditional Ballads wood by the page who comes to inform him of his wife's infidelity: And whan he to the green wood cam, 'Twas dark as dark could bee, And he fand his maister and his men Asleep aneth a tree. The dismal hunt heads also such unlikely romances as El incredulo: Jesucristo fue a cazar, a cazar como solfa, los perros iban cansados de subir cuestas arriba. Encontr6se con un hombre lleno de melancolfa.70 The man turns out to be an atheist and is extensively punished in Hell. Other variants begin with "El rey Jorge fue a cazar" or "San Matias fue de caza"-characters who seem to have no further bearing on the story, after they have questioned the unbeliever as to the existence of God. In another romance on a religious theme, El posadero de Cristo, a hunter finds on the street a man in need of help: Un cazador iba a caza, no caza como solia, se baj6 una calle abajo, se subi6 una calle arriba, y en el medio de la calle un pobre sangrando habia.71 He lodges the poor man-Christ-in his house and receives, as a reward for his charity, chairs in Heaven for himself and his whole family. The hunter in this romance is most likely a late addition, since he is somewhat out of place walking up and down the street; moreover, in most variants the hospitable man is a farmer on his way to or from his fields. What has been done in the Romancero is not a logical but intui- tive grafting of the motif. The enchanted atmosphere of the forest is transplanted into divers other romances where an amazing, marvel- ous, or supernatural event is about to occur. The initial hunt, whether carried out by the person to whom the extraordinary things happen, the person who makes them happen, or a secondary char- acter, is a key to the mode of the romance. The ties to predictable 70 Cossio and Maza Solano, Romancero, I, 472; see also Schindler, Folk Music, texts, p. 83. Devoto (p. 484) believes that Christ is pictured here as a hunter of souls. 71 Cossio and Maza Solano, Romancero, II, 210. Also some German contrafacta have transformed an introductory hunt into a religious motif: "Es wolt ein jager jagen, wolt jagen vor jenem holz" became "Es wolt gut Jager jagen, wolt jagen im Himmelsthron" (Deutsche Volkslieder, I, 23). 169</page><page sequence="38">Edith Rogers everyday routine are severed; the man in the ballad and the audi- ence cross the threshold to an imaginary world. Because of its ubiquity, the introductory motif of the lonely hunter can be called a commonplace, but there are several indica- tions that, even as a commonplace, it has not become meaningless. As shown previously, the components of the motif can be found, singly or in larger numbers, in ballads that have a similar story but employ different diction-a factor that would rule out a mechanical transfer of the motif. Then, also the diction within the motif varies from one romance to another, yet expresses the same feeling. And in none of the romances can the futile hunt be called absurd, even if it lacks a logical connection. That the hunt as such, independent of the motif in question, evokes the supernatural and marvelous, becomes evident in some other ballads. In an Argentine romance the hunter is dissuaded by his lady from exposing himself to the evil powers that lurk in the night: -Caballero, lindo amor, no salgais de noche a caza, que hace la noche oscura y os puede venir desgracia ... que en el cielo refusila y caen gotas de agua ... que estan tafiendo campanas, que es la noche de las animas.72 A lonely hunter may also meet the Serrana-a dangerous woman who dwells in the mountains and whose invitation has led many a man to his death: Vio venir un cazador sin caminos y sin sendas: -iVenga, venga el cazador! Venga usted para mi cueva; sera usted bien recibido y tendra usted rica cena.73 The aggressive huntress, who wears mannish clothes and braids her hair tightly around her head, is thought to be by Julio Caro Baroja "the last avatar of an ancient deity of the mountains,"74 hence again a supernatural element in the hunting scene. 72 C.

Con un falc6n en la mano la caza iba cazar, vio venir una galera que a tierra quiere llegar. (Prim. 153 [Men6ndez y Pelayo, Antologia, vIII, 270-711]) Even though the count's adventure is not sylvatic but maritime, the hunt is far from being an extraneous element. In the conglo- meration of motifs in this ballad that suggest the supernatural, the hunt serves as a complement and reinforcement. While in the ballads of other countries a great many marvelous things happen during a hunt-elves cast a spell over the hunter, fairy beasts lure him to a hopeless chase, enchanted animals seek restoration to human shape-none has developed of the hunt a lyric motif comparable to that in the Romancero. W. M. Hart observes that the popular ballad, in contrast to the poem of art, does not give special treatment to ghosts or supernatural beings and that, "in consequence of this, the supernatural element readily disappears from the ballads, and versions are to be found which contain de- tails only to be understood by comparisons with more original forms .. .75 Also from the Romancero, some such beings as the Huerco have faded, but their function is compensated, restored, and re- plenished by the hunt that suggests the presence of supernatural powers.
