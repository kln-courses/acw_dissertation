The manuscript was addressed to Born's colleague L?on Rosenfeld and criticized his attempt to show that Niels Bohr's doctrine of complementarity was an example of dialectical materialism and as such in perfect agreement with Marxist philosophy. Besides illustrating the deep political divisions among defenders of the 'Copenhagen spirit' in quantum physics, the manuscript is also a valuable source illuminating Max Born's philosophical position about scientific methodology and epistemology. Keywords: Max Born; L?on Rosenfeld; philosophy of science, physics and politics; quantum mechanics; dialectical materialism 'Dialectical materialism and modern physics' is a previously unpublished manuscript written by Max Born (1882-1970) and sent to L?on Rosenfeld (1904-74) in November 19551 in response to a paper by Rosenfeld defending the compatibility of Bohr's doctrine of complementarity with dialectical materialism.2 The manuscript, which is published below for the first time, offers interesting insights into both philosophy and politics of the time. Born's and Rosenfeld's views differed even though they both saw themselves as defenders of Bohr's position on quantum mechanics. Politics clearly pitted Born against Rosenfeld, Liberal against Marxist, especially given the heightened sensitivities of the Cold War climate. Nevertheless, it is puzzling why Born felt motivated to protest against Rosenfeld's position in this rather elaborate form, and why he never published the manuscript. The text shows that, beyond the obvious political disagreement, Born was opposing Rosenfeld's characterization of the role of epistemology and ontology in physics. Therefore, the text throws light on Born's philosophical position, which is not discussed extensively in the literature on this central figure in the development of quantum mechanics. In the rising controversy over the interpretation of quantum mechanics during the 1950s, both scientists were in the same camp, supporting the complementarity view and aligned with Niels Bohr, Wolfgang Pauli and Werner Heisenberg.

Freir? and C. Lehner interpretation' for the position of Bohr and his supporters was only just emerging at the time; Rosenfeld objected rather vehemently to it.3 Critics of Bohr's position included physicists such as Albert Einstein and Erwin Schr?dinger, who were discontent with the methodological implications of Bohr's interpretation. In contrast, Soviet physicists (such as Dimitri Blochinzev) and philosophers criticized complementarity on ideological grounds, claiming it was an idealistic and therefore bourgeois view. David B?hm, a Marxist like Rosenfeld, suggested a deterministic hidden-variable interpretation of quantum mechanics that seemed more easily reconcilable with materialism than Bohr's position. All this put Rosenfeld in an uncomfortable position. He was Bohr's closest aide for philosophical subjects. Being a Marxist, he was an obvious target of the materialist critique of complementarity. Rosenfeld responded with the paper cited above and attacked both David B?hm and the Soviet physicists, claiming that complementarity was compatible with dialectical materialism and a direct consequence of experience. Born could not accept Rosenfeld's claims: Our attitudes to some of the fundamental questions of physics are very similar?though not identical. The main difference is that you claim complementarity has something to do with "dialectical materialism". This I most emphatically deny.'4 The manuscript presents Born's critique of the Hegelian-Marxist concept of dialectics: he accuses it of ambiguity between epistemology and ontology, and he charges that neither use is warranted by the facts. To prove his point, Born considers three possible uses of dialectics: as a principle of logic, as a principle of scientific methodology, and as an ontological principle 'governing the behaviour of the actual world' (p. 2). Especially instructive for Born's position on the interpretation debate is the second and most extensive section, Born's discussion of scientific methodology. Right at the beginning of the section, Born aligns himself with Einstein's critique of positivism and denies that complementarity, like any high-level theoretical concept, is a direct consequence of experience, as he had already told Rosenfeld in a previous letter: 'If the situation is carefully analysed a lot of non-empirical intermediate steps are easily discovered which one could call metaphysical.'5 Nevertheless, he wants to maintain that the concept of complementarity is a precise theoretical term warranted by the empirical facts of wave particle duality, whereas 'dialectics' is a vague notion that misrepresents both physics and its history. Subsuming complementarity under dialectics 'means a derogation of the efforts of several generations of physicists and in particular of Bohr's genius' (p. 6). It might seem somewhat surprising that Born invokes Einstein as an arbiter of scientific methodology, given that the two had long disagreed on the merits of quantum mechanics, which Einstein never accepted as a fundamental theory of nature. But this hint reveals a striking symmetry in the intellectual position of Rosenfeld and Born: just as Rosenfeld was trying to defend complementarity as a manifestation of dialectical materialism to his fellow Marxists, so Born had long tried to defend quantum mechanics to Einstein as the logical continuation of the critical empiricism of Einstein's theories of relativity. The?at times rather heated?exchanges between Einstein and Born, and Born's reflections on them, are presented in Born's edition of their correspondence.6 Born's comments there show how much he admired Einstein's work and how much he was hurt by Einstein's refusal to accept quantum mechanics as a theoretical achievement equal to relativity. It is therefore quite significant that Born's central charge against Rosenfeld, the ambiguity of the concept of dialectics, mirrors Einstein's fundamental critique of Bohr's doctrine of complementarity: Einstein maintained that Bohr illegitimately blurred the distinction between matters of objective fact (the values of physical quantities) and the question of</page><page sequence="3">'Dialectical materialism and modern physicsy 157 our knowledge of those facts (the measurability of these values).7 To Einstein, Bohr's concept of complementarity was unwarranted metaphysics, just as dialectical materialism was to Born. It is somewhat speculative, although not implausible, to assume that Born's attack on aligning complementarity with dialectics was motivated not so much by his political dislike of communism but rather by his fear of this alignment with 'speculative metaphysics' being grist for Einstein's mill (although posthumously). Born never published the manuscript nor gave a public lecture about it, as far as we know. The reasons seem to be related to Born's political stance in the Cold War context. He had no sympathies towards the Soviet and Eastern social and political regimes, as he made plain to Rosenfeld:8 I have been again in East Berlin as a 'greatly honoured guest.' But I cannot be bribed. I measure the state of affairs not by the bigness of the motorcar put to my disposition, the splendour of the dinner parties, the pleasant houses of my colleagues etc. but by the ordinary people. And I had some opportunity to see something of their life. I have been born in Eastern Germany and spent there the first quarter of my life. It was then a flourishing country with a happy cheerful population. It is rather heart-rending to see what it is now. However, Born did not want to raise the political tension with his criticisms of Marxism. He asked Rosenfeld not to circulate the manuscript, because he wished 'to remain in good terms with the Russians and East-Germans... until they themselves will abandon the more excessive and nonsensical Marxist-Engelist [sic] doctrines.'9 Born later decided to abandon the subject completely, seeing signs of change in the socialist bloc.10 Although repulsed intellectually by Rosenfeld's blending of Marxism and complementarity, Born did not want to get involved in a public struggle against Marxists in Cold War times, and chose to keep the dispute with Rosenfeld private.11 Acknowledgements We thank Martin J?hnert and Christian Joas for helpful comments on the draft of this note, and Lindy Divarci for proofreading the manuscript. Manuscript. 'Dialectical materialism and modern physics', by Max Born In a paper with the title 'Strife about Complementarity' (Science Progress, No. 103, July 1953, p. 393) L. Rosenfeld declares the development of modem physics to be a confirmation of the philosophy of Dialectical Materialism. I shall try to analyse this assertion. For supplementing Rosenfeld's considerations I have before me a booklet of the Communist Party, /. Stalin, ?ber dialektischen und historischen Materialismus, millions of copies of which are distributed in Eastern Germany as an official statement of the Marxian doctrine. The dialectic philosophy is often condensed in the words of Hegel, that progress consists in the contest (or combat) of a thesis and an antithesis, which are finally resolved through a synthesis. But already in Hegel's writing there is an ambiguity in regard what kind of progress is meant. Hegel has spoken about the 'dialectical method' as a principle of logic, but also about dialectical processes (thesis + antithesis = synthesis, abbreviated (th.?a.? s.), going on in Nature and in History.</page><page sequence="4">158 O. Freir? and C. Lehner The same ambiguity is found in Marx and Engels and also in Stalin's booklet mentioned above. I quote from p. 9 (translated from the German): Tn contrast to Metaphysics Dialectics starts from the fact that the things and phenomena of nature contain inherent contradictions ... Therefore it follows from the dialectical method that the development from lower to higher levels does not proceed in the form of a harmonic unfolding of the phenomena, but in the form of a discovery of contradictions [footnote in the original manuscript: Italics by the present writer.] which are inherent in the things and events, in form of a 'combat' of contrasting tendencies which are active on account of these contradictions.' Here in one and the same paragraph dialectics is used for two quite different things: for the inner contradictions in natural and historical events and for the discovery of such contradictions, which is a mental process of the thinking subject. [p. 2] I shall now consider three possible meanings and the validity of the (th.?a.?s.) contention namely (1) in the domain of pure logics, (2) as a method of investigating the actual world, and (3) as a principle or law governing the behaviour of the actual world. (1) Although logic has very much expanded since the times of Aristotle, there is complete agreement amongst the logicians about the general concepts from those early philosophers to the most modern mathematicians. Logics has to do with formulating the laws of combining statements in such a way that the derived new statements are valid provided the primary ones are. Modern research has added one new feature. Ordinary logics assumes that to each statement (or act of statements) A there is only one statement ? which is the negation of A. That is the law of the 'Excluded Third'. There is now a group of logicians (Brouwer, Reichenbach etc.) who suggest that there may be a third possibility besides 'valid' and 'non-valid', namely 'undecided'. If one wishes to interpret the dialectical (th.?a.?s.) idea in terms of logic, this 3-valued logic can be discarded; for it is obvious that thesis and antithesis must then be identified with two contradicting statements A and ?, and there is no room for a third position of 'undecided'. But this identification is not possible because two statements A and ? taken together give always an invalid ('wrong') statement. In mathematical logics one has A . ? = 0; this formula means that the domain of objects lying both inside of the validity of A and inside that of A has zero extension. Hence there can never be a synthesis between logically contradicting statements. As far as physical theories (including the geometrical ones) are logical systems no dialectical synthesis of contradicting theories is conceivable. E.g. a theorem of Euclidean geometry will in general be in straightforward contradiction to the corresponding one of a non-Euclidean geometry, and no synthesis is possible. (2) We now proceed to the second possibility: Can the dialectical (th.?a.?s.) doctrine be interpreted as referring to the methods [p. 3] of investigating Nature? Then the competition of thesis and antithesis is not a purely logical one, for the laws of logic are concerned with deriving valid conclusions from arbitrary premises, while the natural philosophy has to do with the validity of the premises (which then logically implies the validity of the whole system built upon these premises). Every physical theory is based on experiments; but the number of experimental tests is finite, while the theory is intended to cover all possible, i.e. an infinite number of cases. Hence a theory is always an interpolation and extrapolation from the known to the unknown. As Einstein has repeated again and again: there is no unique way from the facts of observation to the theory.</page><page sequence="5">'Dialectical materialism and modern physics' 159 One can illustrate this by the problem to draw a line in a plane through a finite set of given points. If there are only two points everybody will suggest the straight line going through them as the 'obvious' solution; if there are three points on a straight line, a circle will be suggested. The only reason for this choice is the 'simplicity' of the solution; what is meant by this word is not quite clear, but in both cases it seems obvious and leads to a unique solution: there is only one straight line through two points, only one circle through three. If there are four or more points there is no such obvious suggestion, and the ambiguity of the problem becomes evident. The situation in science is very similar. As long as the observations are scarce and crude, the theory appears rather obvious, and it is not realized that it implies additional assumptions. When the experimental material is growing observations are made which do not fit in these obvious solutions, and one has to ponder about modifying the additional assumptions and to replace them by more refined ones. No theory can be constructed which does not transcend the empirical data by introducing additional assumptions. In physics these can be classified in two groups: (i) Assumptions which can be still formulated in terms of physical objects although these are not accessible to direct observation. To this class belong many concepts of atomistics and of cosmology. They may be called 'model assumptions'. (ii) Assumptions which deal with philosophical concepts, like: space and time, continuity, necessity, chance, cause and [p. 4] effect etc. They can rightly be called 'metaphysical assumptions'. In the beginning of experimental science these metaphysical conceptions were simply taken over from every day experience and regarded as obvious, just as in our examples the straight line for two points, the circle for three. This was the situation a hundred years ago when Marx and Engels wrote. They were not even aware of the fact that the current ideas about space, time, cause etc. were not the only ones possible. They took them for granted and believed that science was strictly empirical. If they saw a struggle between thesis and antithesis in physics they could only have in mind what I have just called 'model assumptions', the thesis being an accepted theory, the antithesis a new one invented to account for newly discovered facts. The question is now whether such competing theories are in general combined through a synthesis. Scanning the history of physics before Marx and Engels I have not found a single instance of such a merging. Consider the main events: In cosmology the transition from the Ptolemaic to the Copernican system. In mechanics the replacement of Aristotelian by Galilean mechanics. In both cases the older ideas were completely abandoned, no trace of them remained in the new ones. Later, after modern science was really established by Newton and his contemporaries, the older theories, based now on good though restricted evidence, were often not completely overturned, but remained as limiting cases in the newer theories. This happened when Faraday's ideas of fields were formulated by Maxwell; his field equations contain the former electromagnetic theories (e.g. static Coulomb forces) as limiting cases. It also happened that two different branches of physics were united into a wider theory, for instance optics and electromagnetism through Maxwell's electromagnetic theory of light. But this was not a synthesis of two opposed theories of the same set of phenomena, as postulated by the dialectic doctrine, but the combining of two quite different sets of a</page><page sequence="6">160 O. Freir? and C. Lehner phenomena which did not overlap and could therefore not struggle as thesis against antithesis. It is therefore perfectly clear that Marx's and Engels' doctrine is not based on historical facts. It is a metaphysical assumption, and obviously due to wishful thinking. They desired to justify sociological ideas by pretending they are based on scientific [p. 5] methods and share the reliability of these. The elementary paradigma of the sociological situation is this: There is one piece of bread, which Jonathan and Boris want to have. There are three possibilities: (1) Jonathan takes it (thesis), or (2) Boris takes it (antithesis); (3) after some fight they divide it in two parts and each takes half of it (synthesis). The materialistic doctrine regards the latter as the rule of the condition of progress. I cannot see that this is justified by history; it has happened that Boris got the whole spoil, in other cases Jonathan got it. Nor can I see that it agrees with the communist doctrine that in the struggle between capitalism (thesis) and communism (antithesis) the latter will be victorious and annihilate the former which appears a strange interpretation of synthesis. But all this is not our business here, which concerns only the question whether science conforms to the Hegelian-Marxistic doctrine. This is certainly not the case. Up to the time when it was announced no example can be produced. The only example of the synthesis of contesting theories happened almost a hundred years after Marx and Engels, in Quantum Mechanics. Thus their doctrine might be regarded as a marvellous example of forecast and prophecy. But then it is not science but a feat of super metaphysical divining short of a miracle. Quantum mechanics had to acknowledge the fact that radiation phenomena behaved under certain experimental conditions as if they were due to particles, under other conditions as if they were due to waves. It succeeded in reconciling these two apparently contradicting theories by a truly astonishing synthesis. For this purpose a revision of the ideas about physical reality was necessary, and the traditional concept of determinism in physical laws had to be abandoned and replaced by a statistical interpretation of these laws. A critical revision of the empirical base of the fundamental ideas of particles and waves led Bohr to the complete elucidation of the situation, formulated in his principle of complementarity. The claim that these entirely new ideas are in nuce contained in the doctrine of dialectic materialism means a derogation of the efforts of several generations of physicists and in particular of Bohr's genius. There is, of course, also in modern physics a metaphysical component, since there is no logical way from ex- [p. 6]periment to theory, as explained before. But the metaphysical assumptions (about space and time, cause and chance, matter and field) are a continuous development of previous ones and not wild guesses as those of Hegelian and Marxistic teaching. (3) We now discuss the possibility of interpreting the materialistic doctrine neither as a logical nor a methodological principle, but as a law governing the behaviour of the actual world. Then the word thesis can only signify some tendency, like force in mechanics, and antithesis then would refer to another such tendency or force opposing the first one. The notion of synthesis would then mean what the physicist calls the resultant of the primary forces. I cannot see any other possible way of interpretation. But then the dialectic formulation is nothing but an anthropomorphic transcription of well known and clear physical concepts. It introduces the idea of struggle, i.e. of a biological concept, into a purely physical relation, and thus it reverts the whole development of physics. The expression force was originally derived from the subjective feeling of exertion, and as</page><page sequence="7">'Dialectical materialism and modern physics ' 161 long as this feeling was dominating the concept of force the simultaneous action of two different forces might be described as a struggle. Physics has slowly outgrown this primitive standpoint and replaced the anthropomorphic notions by objective definitions. Engels' formulation quoted above 'that the things and phenomena of Nature contain inherent contradictions' is a relapse into pre-scientific thinking and terminology of the type of 'horror vacui' and other such mediaeval 'explanations'. As if things and phenomena of Nature could have the sensation which a human mind experiences when exposed to two contradicting statements or influences! This is pure metaphysics of the worst type, and its adherers have no right to attack other metaphysical systems, using this word as an abuse. The fact is, that no science is possible without some general assumptions which are not logically derivable from scientific methods and in this sense metaphysical. These assumptions are not invariable but have to be adapted to the temporary empirical situation; though they are not logically derivable from facts they are nevertheless reasonable, which means that an unbiased mind knowing all the observed facts will feel compelled to agree to them. If this is metaphysics, it is good metaphysics. But the [p. 7] doctrine of dialectical materialism is bad metaphysics as it introduces associations with antiquated concepts which are not only unnecessary but misleading. Whether the dialectical doctrine has a legitimate field of application in biology and in human affairs shall not be discussed here. Living organisms are struggling and fighting, and it might be possible to interpret the (th.?a.?s.) dogma in a reasonable way. But then it appears to me as a triviality. But there are other statements about physics to be found in Marxist literature. Stalin, in the booklet mentioned already, quotes a passage from Engels: 'In physics ... every change is a transition from Quantity into Quality ... '. E.g. the temperature of water is, to begin with, irrelevant in respect to its liquid state; but when the temperature of liquid water is either increased or decreased a point is reached where the state of cohesion is changed and the water is transformed into steam or ice respectively. Then there follow some more examples of such changes of state, and a somewhat mysterious sentence from Hegel about 'Nodal lines' on which a purely quantitative increase leads to a jump in quality. The purpose of these considerations is obviously to justify with the help of physics the mentality of the revolutionary, who expects that the continuous accumulation of social injustice (the quantitative increase) leads to a sudden overthrow of the power in being and a new regime (the jump in quality). The thermodynamical transitions by Engels and Stalin, used as physical analogies for such events, can just as well, even with greater plausibility, be used for the opposite conclusion. For van der Waals theoretical investigations on the transition of liquid ?? gas, which have been confirmed by numerous experiments, show that by properly directing the changes of temperature and pressure the transition can be performed in a continuous way without a sudden (qualitative) change and without the appearance of a dividing surface (meniscus). The analogy in the social structure of states would be something like the slow introduction of socialism without a violent revolution, as it happened in Great Britain. But what good are such analogies? They are quite arbitrary and unscientific, in short metaphysical, i.e. transcending the [p. 8] domain of well established knowledge. I am not arguing whether a rotten society can always be reformed in a more or less peaceful manner, or not. My personal view is that this depends entirely on the peoples concerned and the historical situation. It may well be that the Czarist regime in Russia was so rotten</page><page sequence="8">162 O. Freir? and C. Lehner and the standard of the Russian people so low that a violent explosion was necessary. But I see no reason why the same must happen in other countries with a higher standard of living and more developed methods of government. I think that predictions about the future can be founded neither on the facts on history nor on theoretical considerations. In any case an attempt to theorise in this field ought to be based on biological observations and psychological study, but not on physics. I emphatically deny that the development of physics can be used as a paradigma for the truth of the Marxistic doctrine.
