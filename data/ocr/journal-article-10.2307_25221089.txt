<plain_text><page sequence="1">16. The Attributes of God. The Gifford Lectures delivered in the University of St. Andrew's in the year 1924-5, by L. R. Farnell. 9J x 6, x + 283 pp. Oxford : Clarendon Press, 1925. The student of the history of religions who knows (as all should know) Mr. Farnell's previous works, will eagerly turn to this book in the expectation of finding in it the same high merits that distinguish its predecessors?wide learning, luminous exposition, vigorous judgment, fine feeling, and, we may add, a courage of thought that does not fear to flutter the dovecotes of orthodoxy. And he will not be disappointed. Few scholars could have handled the theme so ably and at the same time so attractively as Mr. Farnell has done. In these ten lectures are discussed " the qualities and activities attributed to God in the living religions or in those that have lived and had force ", under the heads of personality and anthropomorphism, polytheism and mono</page><page sequence="2">INDICA 769 theism, elemental and natural functions and attributes of deity, tribal, national, political and moral attributes, the attributes of beauty, wisdom, truth, and power, and metaphysical attributes, ending with a rather dis couragingly negative but very able survey of the chief meta physical and moral problems of religion; and there is not a dull pa go in the book. As this Journal must eschew theology, the reviewer is estopped from discussing many interesting general statements in that domain which are propounded by the author in his acute and sometimes very severe criticisms of both Christianity and Judaism. It is for other hands, if so disposed, to take up the gauntlet here flung down : we are only concerned with facts, and in regard to facts the book is generally well documented. Perhaps Mr. Farnell is a little too ready to believe in the originality of Akhnaten's monotheism, for there is some evidence to justify a different opinion, as may be seen from, e.g. Sir E. Budge's Tutankhamen, p. 149; and possibly future research may lead him to doubt the theory now accepted by him that the religion of Israel " at its best was in its earlier stages only * monolatric' " (p. 80). The statement that " Greece was the cradle of the humanitarian spirit " (p. 131) hardly does justice to Leviticus xix, 34, " But the stranger . . . thou shalt love him as thyself," and Mr. Farnell himself almost gives away his case on the next page, when he says that " the same impression [of universality in religion] is made on us by much of the higher Hebrew prophecy ". Nor is he quite fair in ascribing to later Judaism the unsolved riddle of St. John ix, 2, the meaning of which has defied commentators for centuries. The view that the Muses originated " as projections of the psychic energy of the art-impulse " (p. 213) is, I suspect, historically wrong. It may be supported by the dubious etymology of povcra from the root mon-men ; but there is also something to be said for the alternative derivation which would connect it with Latin mons and regard the goddesses as originally</page><page sequence="3">770 NOTICES OF BOOKS a kind of Oreads or " ladies of the mountain ", who developed into the classical muses by a process somewhat parallel to the history of Sarasvati in India. The sweeping dictum that " the religious imagination of India . . . had no concern with social institutions " (p. 139) is quite incorrect. The reference to Siva on p. 166 confuses different strata in the history of the cult; on p. 168 the conception of Dharma, " the Law of Life and the world," is wrongly attributed to the Vedic system ; on p. 189 Amitabha is erroneously introduced into the Sikh religion 1; and " Shas Yung " on p. 60 is a misprint for " Shao Yung ". Apart, however, from such minor inaccuracies, the book is carefully written, and deserves to take high rank in the literature of its kind. 1 Tho mngic power of (ho divine namo thcro described might be still more effectively illustrated by tho popular story of Ajamila.</page></plain_text>
