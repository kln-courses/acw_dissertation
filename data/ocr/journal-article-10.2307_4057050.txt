<plain_text><page sequence="1">FARABI'S FUNNY FLORA AL-NAWABIT AS &lt;&lt;OPPOSITION)) BY ILAI ALON For Zahavah Introduction' TN HIS description of the excellent city (K. al-siyasat al-madaniyah land Arad ahl al-madfnat al-fdaila), al-Farabi mentions those citizens who are not philosophers, but rather the opponents of the principles of their community. To these groups, of which several are enumerated al-Farbhi refers either as &lt;&lt;the rest)&gt; (al-Bdqun)2, or, &lt;&lt;al- Nawdbl3. It is this group, and in particular this name, that is intriguing, for although on the face of it carries no politico-religious significance at all, some conclusions that touch upon these fields may be drawn by scrutinizing it. I would like to show that al-Farabi abstracted the private name of the Nawdbit and gave it the meaning of &lt;&lt;opposition&gt;&gt;. In order to do this, I will first analyze his use of the name along the following lines: first, a short survey of the lexical usage of the root nbt, then, I will show that the Nawabit were regarded by al-Farb-i as oppositional; then, that they belong to the excellent cities; that their description entails all areas of political activity; that al-Fara-b was aware of the meaning of the name; that he used it in an abstract manner and the reasons for his choosing this particular name for ((opposition&gt;). Secondly, I will show the earlier use of the name by a real historical group, and finally-its later use by Ibn BajJah. The question of the origin of the name of the Nawdbit is not a new one. Several mediaeval and modern writers tried their hand at it, I I should like to thank Michael Bonner, Michael Cook, Manfred Halprern, Etan Kohlberg, Muhsin Mahdi and Roy Mottahedeh for their help in making the good parts of this paper. For the other parts I admit debt to nobody. 2 al-Fra-bi, Ard', 278, 12 as distinct from the philosophers and their followers. I In Ard', the term Nawabit appears in a distorted manner as nawa'ib, where it indicates individuals outside the excellent cities. See below, note 69. Arabica, tome XXXVII, 1990</page><page sequence="2">AL-NAWABIT 57 but they all seem to have failed to provide a decisive explanation for the name. Thus, E. Rosenthal, while rejecting the possibility that the name's origin is to be found in Plato4, renders it ((spon- taneous growth&gt; and suggests a relationship between the Nawdbit and the Nabateans5 and Madelung translates it &lt;&lt;Neuerwachsene6.&gt;&gt; Literally the stem has been used to render the sense of growing with reference to plants, but it lends itself very easily to metaphorical use as well: in the Qur'dn man is compared to plants,7 and cAll is reported8 to have likened the Caliph's understanding to vegetation growing on good soil. Classical dictionaries found the noun at least ambiguous9, and sometimes the stem seems to have been connected with gumr, another root with negative connotations10. I should first like to go into a brief treatment of the individual groups dealt with by al-FarTbi under the title of (&lt;Nawabit&gt;&gt; that seem to be six major ones and eight subgroups".

The stem QNAS is usually employed to indicate hunting, in particular of birds'3, and as far as I am aware, it bears no political meaning'4. Members of this group differ from the philosophers in the excellent cities in that their goals are other than felicity15, namely honour, power or riches or some other goals, all such that may be achieved by laudable deeds'6. Parallel to the Mutqannisun, and similar to them, 'Ard' ahl al- madznat al-fdaila reports'7 about an unnamed group, in the domain of religion, who pretend to adhere to religion and ethics, but actually entertain plans for personal gain. The only clear title that al-FarabI attaches to them is the domain of their activity, namely piety (husuc). Their main views concern (1) belief in God and the Spirituals, and (2) belief in the world-to-come at the expense of this world. Paradoxically enough, their very behaviour engenders love and respect among people towards them. In his notes to this passage, Walzer18 does not raise the possibility that these characteristics may point at a particular group or person in Islamic history or contemporary politics. Instead he concentrates on the Greek origins of the description. 2. Muharrifa'9 The second group that al-Farabi mentions is the Muharrifah. This group desire (hawan) the goals of the ignorant cities, but are debar- red from working towards them by the cities' laws (s'ara'i') and religion (millah). They therefore distortingly (harrafu) interpret (ta'- 12 al-FarTbi, Siyasat, p. 104,7. 13 The stem QN$ was also used by two people as a name: Bazar whose mother was called QANAS(?) (Tabarl, op. cit., I 111,1) and QANAS b. Ma'ad (Tabari, ibid., I 748,7). 14 Najar translates this term as ,opportunists,, in Lerner and Mahdi, Political Philosophy, _p. 53. 15 See 'Ard', p. 290,13 for the generation of improper views in &lt;(the [excellent?] cities)). 16 The distinction between views and deeds is an important element in al- Farabi's writings. E.g., kaldm is divided into two parts according to this distinction (I4cdi al-Culuim, p. 131,13). 17 2Ard2, p. 304,3. 18 2Ard, p. 492. 19 Siya-sat, p. 104,10.</page><page sequence="4">AL-NAWABIT 59 wiY) the sayings and inscriptions of the lawgiver in such a manner as to justify (hassana) their goals. The stem of the name of this group obviously has a negative con- notation: it is employed in hadit in connection with interpretation (tafS-r)20. 3. A -Mdriqa2 The third group, al-Mdriqa, is characterized first by the evalua- tion made by al-FarTbi that they mean no distortion (tahrjf), and that their acts are only wrong because they fail to understand the intentions of the law-giver. They also misunderstand the city's legalities ('umuzr s'ara'i' al-madinah) without even realizing their mistakes. While the Mutaqannisuyn and the Muharrifa are referred to by their name (ha/'uladi yusammuina Mutaqanniis}z), the author refers to the Mdriqa not as a name but rather as an identification (fa-ha'uldi hum al-mariqa), perhaps to indicate that there is no need to introduce the name to the reader, because he is already familiar with it. 4. The Mustars'zdiin22 The fourth group of the opposition is that of the Mustarsidun. These are people who permanently cast doubt23, and as a result find themselves both misled and misleading others in theory (bil-aqawif), although in practice they look for truth. al-Farabi avoids, however, the use of the stem s'akk, although he was familiar with it, and used it elsewhere24. Their doubting leads the members of this group from a lower stage to a higher one until they are brought25 (by an unspecified 20 al-Darimi, op. cit., Muqaddima, 56. 21 al-FarTbT, Siydsat, p. 104,14. 22 al-FarabT, Siyasat, p. 104,17. The same group, under this name is mentioned in 'Ard', p. 280,15. Walzer (ibid., p. 281,22) translates the name as &lt;those who seek the right path,,. 23 The term al-Farabi uses is tazytf, which in a literal sense would mean ((blam- ing for falsity,,; ((refutation.,, See the definition of Kaldm (Ilayd, p. 131,10) which consists in ((refuting the views that oppose the religion which the mutakallim is set to defend.,, 24 E.g. al-Farabi, Ihsa, p. 137,9. 25 al-Farabi uses the verb rufica in the third singular passive voice (Siyadsat, p. 105,2).</page><page sequence="5">60 ILAI ALON agent) to the final stage, that of truth which reflects ((things as they are)&gt; (al-asya' cala ma- hzya), where their doubts disappear26. Their process is not one of misunderstanding, but rather of doubt and refutation. The verb zayyafa as used here does not carry a criminal connotation, but rather an attempt to settle inconsistencies, or to refute others arguments. This is a kind of interpretation, and unlike that of the Muharrifa, it is of a positive goal that is not intended to con- tradict (tuca-nid) the excellent city. al-Farabi uses the stem as used here in two different meanings: first it is used in the political sense of opposition: gayr mucadnidin lil-madina 1-fIdila, and later, in the sense of contradiction, perhaps logical: mawddicyumkin an tu'anad. The Mustars'idun are the ((odd-man-out)) of the opposition groups: their good quality is their search for truth, and in fact, their doub- ting. It seems that al-Farabi thought highly of them, as he saw in them a potentiality for becoming philosophers themselves. It is doubt and questioning that make the philosopher, and what is perhaps more important, is the knowledge of when to stop doubting and to be able to recognize truth, an ability lacking in the next party, those of ignorant goals. 5. Those of Ignorant Goals27 A very similar ideology is shared by members of the next group. These people distort (zayyafa) what they represent to themselves (tahayyul), a process that is similar to that of doubt, in that it may enhance its practitioner closer towards truth. There are a number of differences between them and the previous group: first, they aim at ignorant goals, in particular, power; they object to listening to anyone who might talk to them of felicity and truth, and always look for an argument by which they might defeat felicity. At the same time they try to keep up appearances. The members of this group are discriminated against by al- Farabi in comparison with the MustarsYddn. The latter are elevated to the degree of truth, where the reality of things is explained to them. In contradiction, members of this group do not enjoy this 26 This description of the stage of truth corresponds to al-Farabi's definition of truth in his K. al-Fusus, (Haidarabad 1349) p. 21,18. See also another definition in his K. al-Milla, p. 46,18. 27 Sgyasat p. 105,17.</page><page sequence="6">AL-NAWABIT 61 privilege, and they keep to their practice of distortion even when it has been elevated to the degree of truth. This difference can be viewed as a variation on the problem of predestination and free will. 6. Defective Understanding28 The next group can only represent (tahayyul29) felicity and the principles (mabddi'), but they are absolutely unable to understand (tasawwur)30 them properly. They therefore distort what they repre- sent and manage to find what they regard, mistakingly, as the loci of contradiction in it. They are then elevated to a higher degree which they distort too, but because they can not understand (fahima) truth, they cannot attain it. They are divided into four sub-groups: (1) Those of defective representation; (2) Relativists; (3) The partisans of conditional truth; (4) The distressed. 6.1. Those of Defective Representation31 Those of defective representation are characterized by their inability to understand (fahm) truth, even if they tackle the loci of objection (mawadic al-cindd)32, because they fail to represent things sufficiently well. As a result, they take those who claim to have attained truth either for liars, whose hidden motif is search for honour or power (galaba), or else for misguided persons. It seems that what this description amounts to is that they take the true philosophers to be the Muharrifa. They thus distort truth and play down those who have attained it. 28 Siyasat p. 105,13. A group similar to this is mentioned in 'Ara', p. 282,6 f. 29 For al-Farabi's definition of tahayyul see Siyasa, p. 85,5: (Representing them (i.e. the principles of existence) means that their representation (haydl), likeness and things that imitate them be sketched in man's soul)). 30 For al-Fdrdbi's definition of tasawwur see Siya-sat p. 85,4: . . their (i.e. the prin- ciples of existence) essence (ddt) be imprinted (yursamu) in man's soul as it is in reality (4aqT-qa). 31 Saydsat p. 106,1. 32 Translated by Walzer in 'Ara-' as ((grounds for objection,,, e.g. 'Ard' p. 280,11.</page><page sequence="7">62 ILAI ALON This group in turn, is divided into three sub-groups which are determined by the consequences of this characteristic: (1) Those who blame everyone for being misguided (magruirun) about everything they claim to have grasped; (2) those who are perplexed about everything, and (3) those who claim that nothing perceived (frmayudraku) reflects truth (sddiq) and that anyone who opines (zanna) that he has grasped anything is a liar. It is those whom the philosophers regard as ignorant novices (agmar and guhhdAl)33. It is in connection with this group that al-Farabi advises the leader of the excellent city to attend to each party of the Nawabit according to their nature and to punish those who need punishment34, although the advice is universally applicable to all the Nawabit. 6.2. Relativists The second sub-group35 of those of defective understanding is that of the relativists. They hold that truth is what anyone thinks it is at a given time. 6.3. Conditional Truth The third36, the partisans of the conditional truth, claim that no one truly attains truth, and if such exists at all, it has not yet been attained. All these sub-groups have in common one form of skepticism or another. Still, in his account, al-Farabi does not use the verb s'akka. The most he does is to use &lt;perplexity)) (haira) or &lt;&lt;opinion)) (zann) (although in 'Ihsa' al-'ulzim he mentions the &lt;sophists)) making the point that those who were called by this name rejected science (Culuim) and perception ('idrdk)37. The reason for this choice of terms 33 The term gumr means a boy devoid of intelligence (Lane, p. 2292), and it is used by al-Gahiz* in connection with the Has'wah as traditionists (taqlid) (RasePil, vol. 4 p. 243,13). In Ihsa1d, 133,1 1, the most excellent of men is like al-sabf-wal-hadat wal-gumr compared to those of divine intellects. a Siyasat, p. 106,9. a Siyasat, p. 106,12. 36 Sayasat, p. 106,13. 37Ihsa', p. 71,12. His own definition of &lt;&lt;sophists)&gt; has to do with distortion of truth rather than with skepticism. Cf. 'Ihsa' al-'ul1im p. 81,2; FFA 113,1 and FFA p. 267,3.</page><page sequence="8">AL-NAWABIT 63 is probably that those intended here are not the philosophical school but rather some historical group which he was reluctant to name explicitly38. In the period of the actual Nawabit a controversy was under way between the Mu'tazila and some skeptics39 (sometimes refered to as (&lt;al-Hisba-nzyya&gt;))40. As a care in point we learn about one incident in which Tumama b. 'Asras (d. 213/828), al-Ma'mu-n's court theologian, is reported to have confronted someone who believed that &lt;&lt;all things are mere phantasy and conjecture, that man grasps them only according to his own mind (which means-subjectivity), and that there is no truth in (what we call) reality.&gt;&gt;41 'Abbas b. Sulaiman, a colleague of Tumama, is reported to have met one of these &lt;&lt;sophists)&gt; who wanted to make him believe that &lt;every conviction is nothing but a mirage&gt;&gt;42 and elswhere truth was also related to as a dream43. We may assume that similar views were held, at least by some of the schools of the time, such as The Has'wiya, alias Batrjyyah44, alias Ashdb al-Hadit, (perhaps the Nawabit?)45 who were also called Sukkdk by Mu'tazilites such as al- Hayy,at al-Gubba'l and al-Warraq46. Among the personalities who were named in connection with these schools were Sufyan al-Tauri, Sarik b. 'Abd Allah, Ibn Abi Laila, Muhammad b. Idris al-Safi'l and Malik b. Anas47. The same name (i.e. Sukkdk) was applied to them by the Ibadites as well48. The Skeptical movement in Islamic lands at the time of al-Farabi 38 For a condensed description of three schools of skepticism, see al-Bagdadi, Uysiil, p. 6; one school negates reality (4aqfqa) to anything, a second doubts (s'akk) the reality of things, and the third claimed that all beliefs (ictiqdddt) are true. 39 For the view of the speculative theologians about doubt see F. Rosenthal, Knowledge, p. 302. See also Van Ess (1968) p. 1 who refers to Maqdldt, 434,1; Qudama Ibn Gacfar, Naqd al-Natr, Cairo 1938, p. 33,11; al-Maqdisi, al-Bad3wal- Td'rljh, 48,11; cAbd al-Gabbar, al-Mugnf, XII 41,1. 40 al-Gushami, Risala, p. 35,4. 41 Van Ess (1968) 1 refers to Ibn CAbd Rabbihi's al-'Iqd al-Fardd.

It seems that the tenth century was characterized by a tolerant mood that was accompanied by a spirit of skepticism51 and skeptics at the time were quite a few for instance, Abui CAbdallah al-Basri, was one who expressed his radical position in the formula of equivalence of proofP2. In fact, his school may have been a stronghold of skepticism with regard to basic religious prin- ciples such as prophecy53. Perhaps due to the lack of ((academic)&gt; translation of Skeptic works from Greek, (&lt;true skepticism... in the Greek sense of the word was long extinguished in Islam,&gt;&gt;54 and in its stead, a different ((mild&gt;) skepticism was introduced, that did not doubt truth, but only the intellect as a means to attain it. The Batinis for example, advocated abandoning reason and adhering to the TaCllmss, while the Shlcite theologian Ibn Baqqal (d. 363/974) argued that of the Imam is the sole source of knowledge, then reason is unreliable56 and that conviction is no more than a function of dialectical ability57. al-Fdrabi's concept of skepticism is clearly the traditional Greek one, and it fits the mould of ((philosophical&gt;) rather than of (&lt;theological&gt;? skepticism58. It is against this background that al-Farabi's account ought to be studied: his opposition to the ((mild&gt;? skepticism is apparent in his attacks on Ibn al-Rawandi, who was considered by the Muctazila at al-Fardbi's time as a Musakkik59. Apart from this indication, and a single additional one, where Van Ess calls attention to the fact that 49 M.

The Distressed"' Last is the group of &lt;(the distressed). These people do perceive that truth exists, but their perception is as dim as is if in a dream. They believe some of those who claim to have attained truth but fail to do the same themselves, either because of the effort and time required for such an undertaking, or because of their inclination for pleasures. They therefore become distressed and envious, and dismiss the former as misguided or as lying, persons whose real goals are honour and wealth. Some of these overcome their distress by adhering to ignorant goals themselves until death relieves them from their distress. A few general remarks on all the groups are in order: out of the fourteen groups and sub-groups enumerated in K. al-siyasdt al- madaniyya, only three carry a name or a nick-name: The Mutaqan- nisun, the Muharrifa and the Mdriqa. All the other groups are only referred to by a description. All the groups described by al-Farabi have a common goal, namely felicity. They differ, however in their definition of that felicity, which is very reminiscent of the difference between the excellent city and its external opponents. Since the excellent city is a philosophical entity, objects of knowledge in it are of significance. Al-Fdrbfi mentions three such objects, but the distinction between them is not always clear-cut: the first is felicity, the second is truth and the third &lt;(the sayings of the law-giver.&gt;&gt; In some cases, however, ((truth&gt;&gt; may mean &lt;(felicity&gt;&gt; and ((the sayings of the law-giver&gt;&gt; (which basically is the idea behind the perfect city), but in others it is clear that these are not identical. In contrast with modern politics, the groups described here do not have, in general, a &lt;(platform&gt;&gt; where their views may be presented. Only three of the fourteen groups are made to state 60 Van Ess (1968) p. 3 refers to al-Farabi's Risdlahfjmayanbagj anyuqaddam qabla taCallum Al-Falsafa, in Schmoelders, Documenta Philosophiae, p. 4,1-4. 61 Siyat, p. 106,15.</page><page sequence="11">66 ILAI ALON explicitly, though very briefly, their views which revolve around rejecting the concept of felicity as it is accepted by the city. Other groups either state their opposition in the domain of epistemology, or leave the task of finding out their position to the reader. The common denominator of most of these opposition groups is a faulty epistemological process which results from intellectual shortcomings, and which negates the attainability or even the existence of thruth. Of the fourteen groups of the Nawabit, three major parties and one sub-group share explicitely the goals of the ignorant cities. These groups are the Mutaqannisuyn (who are after honour [karama], rule [ri'dsa] or wealth [yasar]62 the Mukarrifa63 the group which I have labled as &lt;&lt;those of ignorant goals&gt;&gt; [whose emphasis is laid on power (galaba)64] and the &lt;(distressed&gt;&gt; who are basically after honour or wealth65. The goals of the ignorant cities themselves are of the same interest as those mentioned above. The difference, though, is that whereas in the excellent cities some of the Nawabit are not des- cribed as having a particular goal exclusively66, the ignorant cities are established individually according to particular goals, e.g., the city of honour, that of power, wealth, and the like. One may conclude, then, that the goals of the Ignorant cities beyond the borders of the excellent ones are the same as those of the Nawabit within them, and if we accept that the ignorant cities are opposed by definition67 to the excellent ones, we may pass the same judgement on the nawabit. In addition to the cities themselves are those individuals who are &lt;&lt;common people&gt;&gt; (min afrdd al-nds nawadib68 al-mudun)69, whom al-Farabi calls nawdbit. Here it is clear that the Nawabit, if indeed the corrected reading is valid, are those who live outside the perfect city. Accordingly, on the one hand there is a greater affinity between the Nawabit and the excellent cities, of which they are citizens, but 62 Siyasat, p. 104,10. 63 ibid. 64 ibid., p. 105,7. 65 ibid., p. 106,15. 66 E.g. the Muharrifa, those of ignorant goals and the distressed. 67 )Ara--, p. 252,15: &lt;,In opposition to the excellent cities are the ignorant city... 68 E.

See Walzer's note 725 on p. 451.</page><page sequence="12">AL-NAWABIT 67 on the other hand, 'Ara-' Ahl al-madina al-fdaila clearly separates them from it and emphasizes the fact that their goals are similar of those of the ignorant cities. The similarity goes even further between the views of the excellent cities' Nawabit and the external ignorant cities: al-Farb-i makes the point that the latter are a development of the respective views within the excellent cities: they only come to exist when religion (milla) [and not as Walzer translates-&lt;&lt;their religion))] is derived from some old pernicious views70. The Excellent City The Philosophers Followers of the The rest [278,10] Philosophers [278,1 1] [278,14] al-Mustarsidun Ignorant Views Defective understanding [280,15] [282,6] [282,14] Figure 2. Structure of the Excellent City according to 'Ard' ahl al-madfnat al-fadila Again, in the context of the wrong views that negate the necessary nature of human society and their advocacy of solitude, al-Farabi says71: (&lt;Then, from these [views] (i.e. those about aggressiveness in nature and among humans), any opinions which are of the ignorant [cities] arise in the cities,&gt;&gt; and it is my under- standing that the cities in which these wrong ideas arise are the per- fect cities which are contrasted with the ignorant ones. The antagonism which results from an oppositional status between the excellent cities and the Nawabit is stressed by al- Farabi, in making it the duty (wagib cald) of the ruler (presumably the Imam-Philosopher) to watch over (tatabbuc) the Nawabit, to engage them (iskdluhum) and to treat (ciladg each kind in an individual manner, be it by punishment (cuquba72), expulsion from the city, detention (habs) or by fine (tasr7ff f bacd al-acmdb, even if they are not fit for them73. The second point that needs to be demonstrated is that the 70 )Ara-', p. 286,2. 71 Ard), p. 290,13. 72 The term can also mean ,detention,,. Cf. Lane, Lexicon, vol. 1 p. 2103. 73 Siydasat, p. 106,9.</page><page sequence="13">68 ILAI ALON Nawabit indeed are part of the excellent cities74. Although it is true that in 'Ara-' they do not belong to it. Twice in al-Siya-sa al-madaniyya the belonging of the Nawabit to the excellent cities is made: the first, in the opening words of the relevant paragraph75 and the other-in its closing words76. This city, which al-Farabi defines77 as ((a group of people who concur with one another in holding excellent views, and who live near to one another&gt;&gt; is substantially different from the one that is compared with the body, all of whose parts complement and cooperate with one another78. Thus, society in the excellent city is arranged hierarchically, in an order that is one of service rather than of views: the lower groups serve the purposes of the higher ones79. It may still be analysed from the sociological point of view, according to which it includes five classes: (1) The Meritorious (al-afiddil) who are the wise (/ukamd'); (2) The Eloquent (dawu al-alsina) who are those charged with things religious (hamalat al-din); (3) The Quantifyiers, such as the arithmeticians, geometers and astronomers; (4) Fighters on the Holy war (Mugahidun); (5) Financiers (Mdl-byun). Had excellent cities only to be analysed in sociological terms there would be no room left for the Nawabit, ...This analysis is much closer to the description of the Republic of Plato, and it seems as though al-Farabi had two directions in treating the excellent city: on the one hand the Platonic, and on the other, the Islamic- contemporary, and he never really managed to unite these two direction in a happy marriage. It seems that on this point 'Ard' and Szyasat differ strongly. It is therefore useful to compare them now: 74 In FFM 120,4, al-Farabi makes the distinction between the "necessarity,, (daruirtjya) and the (&lt;perfect,) (Fa-dila) cities. Perhaps this pair of terms is to be inter- preted on the quantitative level, i.e. the former means - necessary = sine qua non, the other, the superfluous. 5 Siyasat, p. 104,7-" Wa'amma- al-Nawa-bit fi -1-mudun al-fdaila...&gt;&gt; 7{ Sjy asat, p. 106,3-&lt;(fa-ha-'ua'i hum asndf al-nabitlaflhiladl ahl al-madina...&gt;&gt; 7 7Ara', p. 52,2. 78 )Ard', p. 230,4. 79 'Ard', p. 230,12-231,14; see conclusions.</page><page sequence="14">AL-NAWABIT 69 K. al-siyasa al-madaniyya K.

No followers of the No Muharrifa, Mdriqa, philosophers Mutaqannisun or Skeptics. Why are the Nawabit mentioned in al-Siya-sa al-madaniyya, and basically, in 'Ard', they do not? Although they were probably written around the same time, namely between 330/941-331/94280, The differences between the two books are noticeable. These differences may result from the dif- ference in audience or from differences in the goals of each book. It is obvious that Siya-sat is much more direct and immediate than 'Ara'. In it al-Farabi does not hesitate to mention names of actual groups or nicknames that leave little to the readers' faculty of guess- ing. Terms like Nawdbit and Mdriqa are very clear, as we have seen, and so it seems that 'Ara' was intended more as a propaganda type of book, or perhaps more on the utopian side, while al-Sijyasat was intended to be more on the practical descriptive side. The next point to be demonstrated is that the term ((Nawabit&gt;&gt; was indeed abstracted by al-Farab1. The idea behind the abstract term is its generality which goes beyond the particular. ((Opposi- tion&gt;&gt; means the common denominator of all the views that are not those held by the people or groups in power. In his survey, al- Farbhi touches upon most, if not all the areas that may give grounds for opposition in his, or any city: these include considera- tions of the domains of politics that have to do with the goals of the cities; philosophy, namely attitudes towards truth and its attainability; economy the acquisition of riches, and personal- gaining power and control. 80 Sherwani, op. cit. p. 16,14 and Mahdi (1975) p. 64.</page><page sequence="15">70 ILAI ALON Was al-Farabi indeed aware of the meaning of the term Nawdbit, and did he use it for that reason? The most decisive demonstration in favour of this supposition would be an explicit statement to that effect, but unfortunately I could find none. Second best would be to show that the term was in common use at the time of al-Fardbi, and that its meaning was that of &lt;&lt;opposition,&gt;&gt; and it would stand to reason that al-Farbhi was aware of this use. There is no such evidence either. The third, and least persuasive, but unfortunately the only existent evidence is cir- cumstantial: the very use of this particular term in a political con- text is so unlikely, that I can think of no explanation for its use, other than al-Farabi's acquaintance with it and his wish to make a point by using it. In addition, the treatment of the group in the very end of al-Siyadsa gives it more significance than it would have had in any other location in the book. Another indirect evidence for the generic sense of the word is its use in a double plural that of the noun itself and that of the &lt;(city&gt;&gt; madina8 . Walzer thought that al-Fr-abi may have been thinking of specific events while writing 'Ard'82, but he has come up with no specific evidence for his statement. Thus, after calling attention to al- Farabi's close relation to the ancient Greek philosophers he says: &lt;&lt;...but he (i.e. al-Frab-i) is, at the same time, fully aware of the Islamic discussion of his day: this throws new light on these slightly fossilized Greek school topics and fills them with a different life without changing their traditional form.&gt;&gt;83 He goes further to indicate that al-Farabi's expressions are close to Shicite ones, e.g. the view which he shares with them that all the excellent kings (or Imams) are to be thought of as if they were one single personality84. In that, argues Walzer, al-Farabi agrees with the political views of the Shicites about he Caliphate85. If one accepts the observation that although in themselves, the Nawdbit had earlier ceased to exist as a separate entity, they had become a part of the Has'wziyya, which remained in the tenth century and continued the controversy with the Mutakallimun86, one may conclude, I think, that the contem- 81 Siyasat, p. 104,7.

A similar phenomenon on al-Farabi's part, namely his reacting to a former and partially extinct reality is manifest in his attitude towards the Mutakallimu-n: it does not reflect reality in his own time, and may indicate his awareness of the historic rift that which took place at the beginning of the 'Abbasid era87. Let me turn now to a number of expressions of Islamic character used by al-Farabi that will help to show that he was aware of the special meaning of the name Nawdbit88: The stem hrf employed for the name of The Muharrifa when used within a polemical context was traditionally of a negative content89. For example, al-Darimi (d. 256/869) uses it thus: &lt;&lt;Rabbis (Ahbar) and monks (ruhban), while contradicting the Book in their actions sought to cheat their own folk with regard to what they did, for fear that they might lose their positions (tafsudu) and that their own cor- ruption should become clear to people. They therefore distorted (harrafu) the Book by interpretation, and whatever they failed to interpret, they concealed, keeping silent about their own mischief with the goal of holding on to their positions90. The term tahraf was in use in early Imamite literature of Quran interpretation, where it meant originally &lt;&lt;substitution of a letter (4arf) by another9l, &lt;&lt;omission))92 or distortion of the original revelation93. There were even whole books dedicated to this question94. In all these instances, the term was a negative one and was directed at the Sunnis. The negative sense of the other term-tahszn that describes the purpose of the Muharrifa in their interpretations, was shared by some in the context of anti-Sunnah groups who were engaged in 87 Pines (1971) p. 228. 88 This is a common practice with al-Farabi. See E. Rosenthal (1955), e.g. p. 170. 89 Although Allah is called Muharrif al-quluTb (,,The Turner, or incliner of Hearts)&gt;) Lane, s. v. HRF. For the negative sense, see Dozy, Supplem..., I, p. 271. 90 al-Ddrimi, Sunan, Muqaddima 56. The opposite to this term is Taqblzh, used by al-Fr-abi in `Ihsa-', e.g. 136,13 meaning &lt;&lt;to refute another's argument.&gt;) 91 See Kohlberg (1972) p. 211. 92 Ibid., p. 212,11. 93 Ibid., p. 213,15. 94 Ibid., p. 213,8.</page><page sequence="17">72 ILAI ALON presenting non-sense as valid views (tahstn al-abatiT)95. Even the term ta'wfl is employed here by al-Farabi in a negative sense, although it can also carry a positive one96. Another term employed frequently throughout the paragraph, that conveys Islamic content is Agrdd al-Gdhilyya. It is used in two directions: on the one hand the excellent city is created out of the ignorant cities, and on the other, the latter springs out of the former. Both directions occurred in Islamic history: the creation of the Umma out of the Gdhilijyya, and the deterioration of the Just Caliphate into the Ummayad Kingdom. Incidentally, the word g'ahIilzya itself used by al-Farabi in a double sense: a political sense (ignorant cities as opposed to the excellent one) and an epistemological one: ignorance as opposed to truth). The name of the Mariqa too, is very heavily loaded in Islamic terminology: In Hadit literature it is used to indicate those who cast themselves out of Islam, or who are regarded as having done so97. 'All is quoted as saying, after killing the Hawa-rig at the battle of Nahrawa-n, that the Prophet had ordered him to do the right things (Amaranf bi-kulli haqq), and he interpreted it to include the killing of the ndkitfn wal-qasitfn wal-mdriqfn98. Tirmidil dedicates a whole chapter to this term99, and al-Gahiz, along with naming a number of sects of his own time (including the Nawabit), mentions them in this form100. Not only in a religious, but also in a political context, this word was in use in or around the year 289/901. It appears in a letter sent by CAbd Allah b. Ahmad b. CAbd Allah al-Mahdi al- Mansuir with reference to the Fatimid uprising: &lt;&lt;..ft kulli man maraqa Can al-ta- 'a wa-nharafa Can al-'Fmadn... 101 This is also the way 95 al-Nasafi, op. cit. p. 57. One example of a group that might have been in people's minds in this regard is the Jahmiyah who were accused of distortingly interpreting verse 5,93 of the Quran so as to allow them to disregard Islamic dietary laws. See Asiarl, Maqdldt, vol. I p. 170,7. On the other hand, in the fourth form the verb is also employed positively, i.e. ((serving God as if He were before one's eyes,,, (Muslim, Iman, (1).)5 The opposite to this term is Taqbih, used by al-FarTbi in 'Ihsd', e.g. 136,13 meaning ((to refute another's argument. 96 E.g. Abu Da'ud, Manasik, 56: ((The Quran will come down to him (i.e. the Prophet), and he knows its interpretation (ta'wf[)., 97 See al-Buhari, Dyat, 6 &lt; Wal-mariq ft -l-din al-tarik al-g'amdca,. 98 Ibn Abi Hadid, op. cit., VI, p. 129,10. 99 al-Tirmidi, Bdb Sifdt al-ma-riqa. 100 al-Ga-hiz, Risdlafi -1-Nawdbit, Rasa'il, vol. 4 p. 243.

The same term was used by al- Mucadid in reacting to a poem by Yazid, in which the latter called for taking revenge from 'Awliya' Alldh-hadd al-murziq min al-din'03, and even authorities as late as Ibn Taimiyah identify them with the Hawdrig'04. In describing this group, al-Mrabi uses the expression /iaraga can maqsad al-ras al-'awwal'05. The combination haraga can means, in political contexts, to rebel106 or ceder107. It was, also, naturally applied to the Hawarig, explaining the origin of their name108. It stands to reason then, that the Islamic identification could hardly have escaped al-Farabi's attention... The importance of the religious aspect for al-Fdrabi is emphasized by him in his Tahs4l al-Sacddal09. He makes the recommendation that the leader be of sound religious convictions. This indicates that al-FarTbi was indeed interested in things religious and held strong views, although they were almost always out of sight for his readers. It is true that no religious books have come down to us by al-Farbl, except for one for which his authorship has been contested or even proven wrong, i.e., Fuysu al-IHikmal"0. Does this mean that al- FarabI deliberately avoided the topic? How can one possibly avoid it at the time? al-Farabi uses extensively and with a very special meaning the term Imam.. . Could it be the case that he himself participated in the controversy about the Imama in a philosophical rather than a religious guise? A good evidence for al-Farabi's employing a specific name in an abstract manner would be to show that although he was aware of the actual views of the specific group, he attributed to &lt;&lt;his&gt;) Nawabit different ones. This is exactly what happened with al- Farabi's accusation of the Mutaqannisuin of employing scriptural interpretation1"' that stands in contrast with the attitude of the 102 al-As'arT, Maqdldt, I 191,10. 103 Tabari, Annales, p. 2174,9. 104 Ibn Taimiyya, Mu&amp;wiya, p. 31,2. 105 Siyasat, p. 104,15. 106 Lane, vol. 1 p. 718. 107 Dozy, Supplem. vol. 1 p. 358. 108 Lisan, s.v. khrj. 109 See Tahs4l, e.g. p. 45,6. 110 See S.

Having established what &lt;&lt;Nawabit&gt;&gt; meant for al-Farabi we can now proceed and see if the term was shared by any other author in Arabic. This sect was not unanimous on every issue, so much so that al-Hayyat refers to it in one place as &lt;&lt;different (or differing) groups)) (firaq muhtalifa)l 14. There is enough evidence to indicate that a party or sect of some prominence was in existence at the time of al-Gahiz (d. 869) and later"15. al-Gahiz wrote an entire treatise that is dedicated to the Nawdbit"16, and Pellat even names them as one of the three main parties along with the Muctazila and the SlCa1l7.

This remark brings to mind a wild hypothesis that the name &lt;&lt;Nawabit&gt;&gt; can be explained as a transliteration-translation of the Greek Neophytes. This term was used for many centuries by Christians, Eastern and, later, Western alike, to designate new converts, but literally it means ((new plants.&gt;'12' Add to the plausibility of this hypothesis the fact that the 112 See Mas'u-di, Tanbih, p. 395,13. 113 See below p. 82 (n. 180). 114 al-Hayyat, Intisa-r, p. 55,15. 115 The group has been the subject of a number of scholarly works since van Vloten published al-Ga-hiz's treatise in 1897. In his article he described this group as the relation between the Mu'tazila and the Haswiyya (p. 112), or even as a part of them (ibid. p. 113), a view that Halkin adopted (1936, p. 4 n. 5): &lt;(without a shadow of a doubt,,.

This historical group was very much involved in the politics of the day: al-Gahiz describes the situation in his own &lt;&lt;difficult and corrupt time)&gt; (his treatise about the Nawdbit was written around the year 226/840124) as follows: &lt;&lt;They (the Nawdbit) started to grow (nabatat) and appeared (nasa'at) at that time, they introduced these new illicit innovations (abda'at hadihi al-bid'a) namely, advocating Mu'awiya.&gt;&gt; They gained considerable power and influence, so much so that al-Gahiz laments that situation in which he felt obliged to pray to God on behalf of the opponents of non- believers'25. Others also describe the Nawdbit in terms that connect them to important political and religious events: In 201/816, two separate groups in Baghdad bearing the name al-amr bil-ma'rif wal- nahiy 'an al-munkar took to arms, which resulted in the victory of ahl al-hadtt by gainining control of Baghdad in the time of al-Watiq, especially in the year 231/845126. Eleven years later, In 212/827, the mob became angry over Ma:'mu-n's decree to condemn Mu'cawiya in mosques all over the Caliphate because of the latter's alleged reply to Mugfra to the effect that it did not pay to be good person'27. Yahya Ibn Aktam, the celebrated QdaI, managed to prevent him from doing so'28. In 227, one year after our Risdla was compiled, another round of disturbances took place, in which the Jahmites in Baghdad were attacked129. The cause this time was an attempt to erase an inscrip- tion of the Mosque of SuCaib b. Sahl al-Qaddc30 stating that the Quran was created'3'. 123 al-Gahiz, Risdlat al-Nubl Wal-Nubdlda, in Rasadil, vol. 2 p. 173,13. 124 Lambton, op. cit. p. 62. 125 Glahiz, R.

In opposing him, the Kufans joined the Baghda- dians from a number of quarters: Ahl al-Bait, the Mawdla and the extremist army officers133. They did not restrict themselves to Iraq"34, but were also quite prominent in Syria, especially at the 135 time of al-Hayyat who calls them &lt;(the rebellious sect of Syria)&gt;). The result of these steps was that Ibrahlm and Mansiir, the sons of al-Mahdi, together with the uncle of al-Ma'muin took to arms, received the confidence of the Baghdadians and deposed al- Ma'min"36. It was for this rebellion that Ibrahim b. al-Mahdi bor- rowed money to finance his military operations. When he failed to pay back the debt, a poem was compiled by Muhammad b. 'Abd al-Mdlik, one of the creditors, in which Ibrahirm was referred to as ((the leader)&gt; (ima-m) of &lt;&lt;this Nabdtziya&gt;&gt;, and the author threatened him with showing this poem to al-Ma'muin. The money was promptly returned'37. A sign of the importance of the Nawdbit is the report that goes the farthest with regards the Ndbita, that of Mas'uCdi, who tells that 'Ali, in the year 9 made public the divine decree prohibiting entry to Mecca to non-Muslims, among whom the Ndbita were named"8. For all its historicity, however, the only person who has been explicitly named in connection with the Nawdbit is that of the HanafT faqlh 'All al-Razi Ibn al-Muqatil, who is reported by al- Hayyat as participating with a group of the Nawdbit in a meeting139. When dealing with sects in general, and the Nawdbit in par- ticular, one must bear in mind that what is known of the Nawdbit s views is drawn from writers who are either Mu'tazilite themselves, 132 al-Ma'mu-n appointed his successor (All ibn Ga'far Ibn M. b.

Ibn Qutaiba (d. 276/889), himself far from being a Muctazilite, reports14' that the name Nawdbit was given to ahl al-Hadtt by the mutakallimuin, and al-MasCudi mentions them as forming, along with the Hasvwziya, a group calledfuqahad al-amsar, who, in turn, were one of three main parties of contemporary Islam142. Their theologians' main points of ideology143 were: (1) Mucawiya The first point made is the very emotional way in which al-Gahiz recounts the refusal of the Nawdbit to condemn Mucawiya. This refusal, al-Gahiz states, puts them in a lower position even than the criminal himself'44. The Sunni attitude was taken up by al-Gahiz to show their excessive and unconditional obedience145, a position that on the one hand could conform with authority, but coming as a complaint from al-Gahiz is intended to portray them as opposition to a rightful re-,rme. To th ur veneration of Mucawiya14s, sometimes their support of cAli is added too, a position they shared with the Haramiya. In counter-arguing the above statement the point was made that even cAil himself forbade his followers to condemn Mucawiya, and so did cUmar b. cAbd al-cAziz147. 140 See p. 78 below. 141 Ibn Qutaibah, Ta'wfl, Cairo 1966 p. 80. 142 MasCu-di-, Tanbih, Beirut 1965 p. 337. 143 al-Hayyat -repeatedly quotes &lt;&lt;those of the Nawdbit who theologize (man takallama mmn al-Nawabit) e.g. p. 22,5. 144 al-Gahiz, Risdla, p. 119,9.

These Nawdbit amaze me: they adhere to this hadat, then support Mucawiya&gt;&gt;148. Some hold that at the time of al-Gahiz the two main parties that competed, and whose point of disagreement was the attitude towards Mucawiya, were the Nawdbit on the one hand and the Mu'tazila on the other'49. In the circular letter that Ma'mun intended in 211/826 to send to all parts of the Caliphate with the decree to condemn Mucawiya, the venerators of the late Caliph are referred to as common people (Cdmma) whose religious belief (adydn) suffered subha, whose convictions (muctaqadihim) are corrupt (fasad), and whose misguided objectives (ahwa') have been overcome by separatistic-nationalistic tendencies (casab5ya)lS0. These could include the Hanbalites'5' and even the Rawafid who became Mucawiya's supporters in a later period (if the story reported by a disciple of Gulam Taclab (d. 957) is to be believed'52). al-Ma'mun was dissuaded from taking this step by the high qada-Yahyah Ibn Aktam'53 who put forth the argument that such an action would meet with fierce popular opposition, especially in the east and Khurasanl54. In the year 284/89, when al-Farabi was about 27 years old, al-Muctadid contemplated the possibility to issue the same decree, but he again was dissuaded from doing so. Even a century later, at the time of al-Maqdisl (375/985) there existed in Baghdad a group that &lt;"exagerated&gt;&gt; in loving Mucawiya, who were also anthropomorphists and barbahadriya(?). Al-Maqdisi related the story that on one occasion he, while visiting the Wasit mosque, heard a prophetic hadat to the effect that Allah will sit Mucawiya on the day of resurrection to His right and uncover him 148 Quoted in al-Hagiri, op. cit. p. 191 note 1 from al-munyah walPamal, on the authority of al-Gubba'i.

Funnily enough, The most outspoken supporter of MuCawiya was, reportedly, al-Asamm the Muctazilite who claimed that 'All had never been an Imam and that there was no necessity that Imam should be in the world. 150 Tabari, Annales p. 2167,12. 151 Pellat (1956) p. 58. 152 Pellat (1956) p. 56-7. 153 For him see Masciudi, Mur-g, vol. 4 p. 316 ff. 154 Pellat (1956) p. 55; Tabarl, Annales, vol. 3 p. 1098; 2164; Mas'u-di, Murdi, vol. 7 p. 90; Baihaql, Mahdsin, p. 151.</page><page sequence="24">AL-NAWABIT 79 to all mankind like a bride155. The topic of condemning Mu'awiya is still hot at the time of Ibn Taimiya, whose view is that such a con- demnation is prohibitted because Mu'awiya's had been one of the Sahdba'56. Another argument put forwards in favour of MuCawiya (according to Pellat-by the Nawdbit'57) was that during the entire 40 years that the man served as governor and Chaliph, he com- mited no crime at all. A more modes description of the Nawdbits' stand was that their basic principle was qutiid (avoiding political judgements)158. How- ever, not all students of the events agree on this being the most important matter for the Nawdbit: In contrast to Houtsma'59 who thought that the main issue advocated by the group was hatred of 'AlI, Halkin is of the opinion that they merely supported 'Ali's opponents and did not really hate him'60, while Lecomte thinks that the group opposed both the Alawites and the 'Abbasidesl6l. All this quite detailed history serves as ample evidence for the vividness of the issues, as well as of the parties involved over long centuries, including of al-Farabl's own. Certainly one might say that, judging by the emotionality expressed in the style of al-Gahiz, then the issue of Mu'awiya was the one most hurting for him, and probably to his contemporaries. Although it seems to me that there is very little in common between al-Farabi's account of the Nawa-bit and that or the other authors, it is possible that al-Farabi's view about Mua-wiya was similar to that of Ibn Rusd, namely that he exemplified the transition from a perfect society and government into a deteriorated kingship, from accepted traditions to innovated whimsical (ahwa-) innovations'62. 155 Ahsa-n Al- Taqasim, p. 126,14. Other groups who took up the issue of Mu'awiya in a like manner to that of the Nawdbit were the Saficiyya who claimed that al-Ma'mu-n belonged to the people of paradise because he was a martyr just as 'All was. (Ssfadi, Al-Gait, vol. 1 p. 165,15), and the Hanbalites whom Maqdlsi blamed for excessive love towards Mu'awiya (Maqdlsi, Bad', p. 126) and Ahi Al- Sunna Wal-Hadit, (Lecomte, op. cit. p. 337). 156 al-Gahiz, Risdla, p. 3; Ibn Taimiya, Yazfd, p. 21,9. 1 Pellat (1956) p. 59. 158 Lecomte, op. cit. p. 338. 159 Houtsma, ZA 26 (1911) p. 196. 160 Halkin, op. cit. p. 3. 161 Lecomte, op. cit. p. 337. 162 See E.

They thus took part in the renewed political controversy in the ninth century that revolved around the question of whether the Umma was to be governed according to the inter- pretation of the Qur'dn and hadit by one single Imam, or by that of the many165. The cUtma-nayya movement in the ninth century, which advocated the Umayyads, were not so much for their return, as they were opposed to the veneration of cAli by the Rawafid. They did point out the positive aspect of cUtman being elected by the council. (3) Anthropomorphism One of the gravest and most frequent accusations made against the Nawdbit was that of anthropomorphism (tasbfh)166, and it is more often made by association with other groups whose views on the matter were well-known, e.g., the Jews and the Nawdbit' ((brothers&gt;&gt; from amng the Rdfida'67 and the Has'WZiyya168. Even some modern scholars have adopted this method of describing the views of the Nawdbit, e.g. the Karamiyya, whom van Vloten described as a mix- ture between the Nawdbit and Sufism, and who held the view that Allah has a body169. 163 Election of the Ima-m is excercised by the Sura, and was advocated by a fac- tion of the Zaidites. See Maqdla-t I p. 135,1. 164 al-Hayyat, Intisar, p. 102,1. 165 Mascfidi, Tanbfh, 232,8; Watt, Formative, p. 166. 166 al-Gahiz, Risdla, p. 119,14. al-Hayyat, Intisar, p. 105,14. 167 For the views of the Rafidite on this issue see Maqdlat, I 102,12. The views of the Nawabit on anthropomorphism correspond to those of Ahl-Al-Hadft wal- Sunna, ibid. I 320 ff. The Nabita shares anthropomorphistic views with the Rawafid, and both are clear heresy.

However, al-Galhiz accuses"'7 the Nawdbit of attaching to it all the attributes of creation without call- ing it by this name. They are forced into this position because they do not differentiate between the speech of humans, which is not created by them and that of God. We know, or at least we learn, that the Nawdbit did not always speak in one voice on this matter, to the extent that some even accused others of disbelief'72. For Madelung they are ((the traditionalists&gt;&gt; and he quotes al- Gh.iz as arguing ((that on the one hand they use with regard to the Qur'an terms that imply creation, but on the other hand do not admit the term &lt;&lt;Halq&gt;&gt;, because they imagine God speaking in the same fashion as human beings speak, and human beings do not create their speech&gt;'73. (5) Predestination The Nawdbit's stand on the topic of predestination is not univocally determined either: al-MasCfidi reports two contradictory views allegedly held by them: on the one hand they were not included in his list of the partisans of free choice'174, but on the other hand, later, in the same work they are mentioned and criticised by 'Abd al-Rah.man Muhammad al-Wali in the year 345/956, along with other partisans from ((the Muctazila, the Zaidiya, the Hawa-rig, the Murji'ah and the Has'wiyya'175.&gt; Their theologians were therefore included by al-Hayyat'76 and Ibn an-Nadim, who, incidentally, is the only heresiographer who mentions their Nawdbit as far as I could establish, among the rest of the Mugbiral77. From other instances we know that al-Farabi tried to dissociate himself from 170 On the controversy regarding the createdness of the Qur)dn in the period that preceded the Mihna, see Madelung (1985), especially p. 617 n. 171 al-Hayydt, Intisdr, p. 55,15. 173 Madelung, (1985) p. 121 where he also refers to Van Vloten.

This attitude is expressed in Ihsa' al-'ulzim, FSM and de Int., and one could see that he favoured, at least in this context, the Mu'tazilte position, although he did not mention them by name. This failure brought Zimmermann to observe that it was a sign of disdain that he failed to make a common cause with them'78. It is interesting that he did not stop to elaborate on this issue in his portrait of the Nawdbit, which may indicate once more his lack of both information on and interest in their actual standpoint. On the other hand, although his position seems to have been against that of the historical Nawdbit, his failure to elaborate on the point is curious. It could be interpreted, however, as a sign that he had already dissociated himself completely from this specific case, and only dealt with the abstract for which instances of agreement and disagreement are of no consequence. (6) Textual Interpretation (Ta wii): al-Farabi went to some length to attribute to some of the Nawdbit the technique of scriptural interpretation (ta wfI) for the purpose of strengthening their goal in an illegal manner (tahsin). As a historical fact, the Nawdbit were quite opposed to this techni- que and to those who practiced it most the Bat!niyya. al-Gahiz con- nected the Nawdbit with the slogan of bild kaifa, the celebrated prin- ciple of the Hanbaliyyal79. (7) God's ability to do wrong (Tagwz-r) The Nawdbit seem to have taken part in the theological con- troversy over God's ability to do injustice'80, taking the position that this is possible for Him'8'. In this they were at variance with the Mu'tazila as represented in this paragraph by al-Nazzam'82, 178 Zimmermann, Introduction to his edition of de Int., pp. cxi and cxvi.

Cf Maqdldt, vol. 1 p. 322,23 for the attribution of this position to Ashdb Al-Hadzt Wa-Ahl Al-Sunna. 180 For God's ability to do injustice, see al-AsCari, Maqdldt, I 138,19 ff. where part of the Zaidiya is described as holding this view. The main discussion though, is that of the Mu'tazilite views on the topic (ibid. I 252 ff.). Even some Mu'tazilites agreed that Allah is capable of doing injustice, e.g. al-Iskafi (Ibid. I 253,13). 181 al-Gahiz, Risdla, p. 119,9; 14. 182 For his detailed position on the issue, as well as that of the other Mu'tazilites, see R.

Thus, &lt;(Those among the Nawdbit who practiced kaldm claimed that God can do injustice (,ulm), a view they shared with the entirety of the Rafida183. They also claimed, in a similar manner to Ibrahim al-Nazzam that God can put in hell those who had been promised eternity in paradise in reward for their obe- dience in this world'84, or even to send the inhabitants of Paradise to Hell in spite of His promise. They further said that the expres- sion (&lt;After having stated that He would do something, God can refrain from doing what He had said He would do)&gt; is paradoxical and has no meaning at all, once God had indeed said that He would do that [thing]185. (8) Divine Knowledge: The Nawdbit believed that God knows by means of eternal knoweledge, a view strongly opposed by Abu al-Hudail the Muctazilite 86. (9) The Sahdba: The group, as reported by al-Hayyat seems to have held much in common with ashdb al-hadit and the Murgi'a. On the issue of the sahdba and their rights. They differed from them however over the identity of some of these people and their order of priority'87. As a considerable part of the description of the Nawdbit, the technique of comparison and combination was widely used by authors who dealt with this group. Thus, for an educated reader, seeing their name mentioned along with other group or groups, reveals by itself the author's attitude towards them. For the most part the Nawabit are combined, as we saw188, with the Hasvwz3yya'89, but also with the CIbddtjyya, with whom they were 183 al-Hayyat, Intisar, 22,4. 184 al-Hayyat, al-Intisar, 22,22. 185 al-Hayy,at al-Intisar, 22,4. 186 al-Hayyat, al-Intisdr, p. 59,18. 187 al-Hayyat, al-Intisar, p. 105,17.

On the other historical, as well as the value side of al-Farabi is Ibn Baga (d. 533/1138) who used the term in his book Tadbfr al- Mutawahhid indicating that the word has two meanings: (1) A private name for a particular group of people who live in ignorant cities who hold right philosophical views and as such are the sole candidates of achieving felicity'94. The greater the gap between them and their opponents, the more appropriate is the name. As such each individual is called ?arib (&lt;and is similar to his &amp;zif-t homonym'95. Incidentally, one can trace this view to al-Farabi's: In FFM, the obligation is on the meritorious person (al-fdail min al-nds) to live in the Excellent City, if one exists in his time. If none does, then he is regarded as &lt;&lt;a stranger (garfb) in the world, his life is so bad that death is preferable to him to life'96.&gt;&gt; (2). A generic noun that indicates any opposition, regardless of how right their views are'97. The Nawdbit are mentioned as living in the four cities that are not the excellent one. For him, the Nawdbit, whose name he sug- gests means &lt;(weeds that spring out of themselves among plants)&gt;'98, are the cause for the coming-to-be of the Excellent City, which he calls &lt;&lt;the wholesome city)) (al-madina al-kdmila)199 out of the lesser ones200, a direction opposite to that pointed out by al-Farabi, who allows the Nawdbit in the excellent cities to act towards changing them into ignorant ones. He seems more geared towards the notion of Islamic history as starting from a peak and deteriorating with the passage of time. Ibn Bagga's choice of name for his city makes al-CAmma, Ms. Ambrosiana C5 fol. 23a as quoted by H. Modaressi in al-Gusami, Risdla, p. 8 n. 1.

Within the ignorant cities, Ibn Bag'ga tells us, the Nawdbit appear almost as a professional group, along with physicians and lawyers, and are indicative of the inferior state of the society to which they belong. The philosophical views which they hold give the impression of acci- dent (man waqaca cala ra'y sddiq) rather than systematic and inten- tional striving to the truth202. Ibn B-aga does not mention the historical Nawdbit explicitly. However, his attitude towards Mucawiya, we know, was negative. He pointed out that Muc'wiya was not preferable to cAll, because an examination of these two per- sonalities would reveal their truth203. This attitude is somewhat contrary to the fact that Spain was ruled by the Ummayads long after they had ceased to govern the East; but on second thought, perhaps this explains the fact even better. Ibn Bagga may have not known the Nawdbit directly. He could have drawn all his informa- tion from al-Farabi, a possibility which is strengthened by a passage in which he attributed to al-Farabi an intention to describe in his works the politics of the ancient Persians whose society was a mix- ture of all five kinds of cities, and in particular, the lesser ones204. To sum up: Whereas for al-Farabi the Nawabit live in the perfect cities, for Ibn Bav'a they are the citizens of the ignorant ones; for both writers they are the opposition, their political role for al-Farabi is mostly dangerous and negative, whereas for Ibn Baga it is positive and constructive; contrary to Ibn Bagga, al-Farabi does not attempt to come up with an explanation of the name &lt;&lt;Nawdbibt, but he goes into greater detail in describing the group, perhaps because of his closer historical proximity to the real party. Conclusions regarding al-Farabi: 1. Al-Farabi constantly discusses real existing groups. But when he does so, he calls them by other names, or omits to name them altogether. Al-Farabi never addresses himself in partisan fashion to the burning contemporary issues of the imamate. What he does is to treat it in a detached philosophical manner. 201 Ibn Baga, Tadbzr, p. 43,1. 202 Ibn Bagga, Tadbtr, p. 42,14. 203 Ibn Baga, Tadb&amp;r, p. 57,9. 204 Ibn Bagga, Tadbir, p. 43,5.</page><page sequence="31">86 ILAI ALON He also gives a precise detailed account of the skeptical schools and moods of his own time albeit very concisely. If trying to interpret K. al-siyasa 1-madaniyya with the help of 'Ard' ahi al-madfna al-fddila is legitimate because of the almost complete parallelism between the descriptions in these two texts, one can learn that al-siyasa is more outspoken than the latter. Here a severe criticism is levelled against the leaders of the perfect city (taking into account that this is the city where the Nawdbit exist, according to al-Frabbi). 2. The different treatment of the Nawabit in the 'Ard' and al-Siya-sa indicates a different role for each: the former is used for more general consumption and reflects views that are more favourable to the existing government, while the latter is more realistic in that it takes into account the existence of opposition within the perfect city and even advises the ruler how to deal with them. 3. al-Farabi did his best to avoid being too explicit in naming groups and views. His intentions show through his efforts, especially by using loaded names and expressions. I therefore would agree that al-FarTbi &lt;&lt;carefully avoided the theological, sec- tarian and political controversies&gt;&gt;205 of his time but would restrict this attitude to the explicit realm only. Conclusions Regarding Opposition. (1) It was al-Farabi who introduced the term &lt;&lt;Nawabit&gt;&gt; in the abstract sense of &lt;&lt;opposition&gt;&gt;. (2) The process of the development of this introduction use was: (a) A derogatory political general noun used mainly by the ruling Mu'tazilites in the 9th century or perhaps even earlier used to indicate a proto-Sunnite group that opposed the &lt;&lt;state-religion&gt;&gt; of the Muctazila. (b) A derogatory private name used by the ruling Muctazilites for the same group. (c) A general unified generic noun used by the semi-neutral al- Farabi to denote negatively all the factual and possible views of a group that opposes the philosophers in the Excellent City. We saw that al-Farabi's Nawdbit had in 205 Mahdi (1971), p. 524.</page><page sequence="32">AL-NAWABIT 87 some cases views different from those of their historical homonym. (d) A generic philosophical noun used by the philosophically- neutral Ibn Baga to indicate positively both opposition in general, and in particular the private case of that opposition which is individual and positive, and is under a hostile government206. al-Gahiz al-FrabTi Ibn Bagga Attitude Negative Negative-Neutral Positive-Neutral Nature of General Noun + Private Name(?) + Generic name Word Private Name Generic Name Political Opposition to real Opposition to utopian Opposition to real Stance govt. on political + govt.(?) on political + govt. on philoso- theological issues philosophical issues phical issues Figure 3. The Development of Concept (3) One explanation for the choice of this particular term is that while it was indicative enough, it was not overtly offensive, as mukh/szimun, Mujddilun or fitna might have been. The latter, the most commonly used for ((opposition)&gt; in Islam, carries more than a tinge of religious sense to it, beyond the degree that al-Fdrabi would be willing to surrender. This undertone of apparent detach- ment is also manifest in al-Farabl's reluctance to use terms that are clearly negative. (4) Al-Fdrabi's importance in this process lies in the fact that he served as a link between the real, actual group with their immediate convictions, and the fully abstract concept as was used by Ibn Baga (who, as we saw, was aware of his debt to al-Fdrabi). It was al-Farb-i who was the first to make the abstraction. To the best of my knowledge, up to him no Muslim writer had thought of joining, all the sects and factions at variance with the ruling government on different grounds under the same title so as to draw conclusions about them as a unit. (5) Al-Fdrabi's treatment of the groups in the perfect cities covers the entire range of possible grounds for opposition: political, 206 On the whole, a process similar to that was undergone by the Rafidite.

In this the Nawdbit as opposi- tion contribute to rendering politics a most broad discipline that is both practical and theoretical, something along the lines suggested by Mahdi in his analysis of Ihsa407. (6) Finally, this is not a militant opposition, although al-Farabi does advise the leader to take steps against the Nawdbit when these are necessary, steps that may include harsh measures such as deten- tion and expulsion.
