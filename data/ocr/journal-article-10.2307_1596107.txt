<plain_text><page sequence="1">Studia Islamnica, 2001 Death, funeral processions, and the articulation of religious authority in early Islam Introduction It is said that when Yahya ibn Ma'in, a scholar who had devoted his life to the study of hadith and to evaluating the credentials of its transmitters, died in Medina in the days of the Hajj in 233/847, the Prophet's bedstead (sarir) was brought out and his body was carried on it. (') "A large number of people attended his funeral. A man [went about] saying, 'This is the fune- ral of Yahyd b. Ma'in, who used to guard the Prophet against lies,' and people wept." (2) That a distinguished scholar should have been honoured for a lifetime of devotion to Prophetical traditions by being transported to his grave on what was believed to be the Prophet's bedstead is not implausible, any more than is the large popular turnout at his funeral. The mere fact that the funeral of a prominent person should have been a noteworthy public event is, indeed, not especially remarkable in itself. Reports about a funeral such as Ibn Ma'in's do, however, acquire a new significance and become worthy of serious attention when we read them alongside accounts of other early Islamic funerals and when we ask if these accounts might shed some light on evolving trends in the articulation of religious identities in the first centuries of Islam. As often conspicuous public events, what role did fune- rals have as markers of conflicts and controversies in the community?

What traces might we find of some of these contestations in the corpus of hadith? What evolving conceptions of the community do the early discussions about funerals point to? These are among the questions which this preliminary inquiry into the social and religious meaning of funerals in early Islam seeks to address. (3) Funerals as markers of controversy Numerous traditions attributed to the Prophet enjoin participation in funerals. (4) Such participation is one of the "rights" the deceased has over other Muslims. (') It is a fard kifaya, an obligation that at least some Mus- lims must discharge on behalf of the community as a whole. (6) A tradition reported by Abu Hurayra maintained that one who followed a funeral pro- cession and prayed over the deceased merited one "qirat" (of reward); and he who stayed on until the burial had been completed was to be rewarded in the hereafter with two gir~ts. Asked what a qirat meant, the Prophet is said to have likened it to a mountain. (7) Another tradition enjoins upon (3) Topics which will not be discussed in this preliminary paper, but which I hope to address in sepa- rate studies include: the ritual aspects of death, funeral, and burial in early Islam; the articulation of a Mus- lim religious identity in terms of discourses on how to distinguish appropriate "Islamic" practices relating to death and burial from Jewish, Christian, and Jdhhili ones; and constructions of gender through rituals of death and funerals. For a pioneering (but largely descriptive) study of death and funeral rituals in early Islam, see Irene Grtitter, "Arabische Bestattungsbrauche in frtihislamischer Zeit (nach Ibn Sa'd und Bukhri)", Der Islam, 31/2-3 (1954): 147-73; ibid., 32/1 (1955): 79-104; ibid., 32/2 (1956): 168-94.

Brill, 1960- [hereafter EI(2)]). On certain aspects of continuity from pre-Islamic to Islamic times, so far as such rituals are concerned, cf. Michael G. Morony, Iraq after the Muslim Conquest (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1984), 453- 58.

(8) A tradition about the noted Kfufan scholar Sufyan al- Thawri (d. 161/778) has him hurrying, with face concealed, behind the funeral procession of male and female slaves. (9) The primary point of this tradition apparently is to illustrate Sufyan's piety, in his seeking to honor the lowly while himself remaining anonymous. ("0) But while participating in funeral processions for Muslims was thus a vir- tuous act - and a necessary one for at least some who would stand for the rest (fard kifaya) -, the case of those who were perceived as having been at odds with the community and its norms while yet being "Muslims" was less cer- tain. Perhaps the classic instance of this uncertainty is the funeral of'Abdallah b. Ubayy, the leader of the munafiqun ("hypocrites"). The mundfiqun are pre- sented in the Islamic tradition as having become Muslims in the Prophet's Medina only to undermine the nascent community from within, and are roundly condemned in the Qur'an for their machinations. (") When Ibn Ubayy was on his death bed, he requested that Muhammad clothe him in his shirt and lead the funeral prayer over him. (12) According to other reports, it was Ibn Ubayy's son, 'Abdallah, who made this request for his father. (3") Despite the strenuous objections of 'Umar b. al-Khattdb, Muhammad did pray (7) Al-Bukhari, I, 332f. (Jand'iz, 58f.). A "girdt" normally designated the twentieth or the twenty fourth part of a dirham; hence, the term might be used to signify something which was of little value. The use of this to denote something as big and imposing as a "mountain" represents, then, an interesting inver- sion of meaning. For a discussion of Abft Hurayra's remark about the use of the girdt in this context, which seems to have caused some perplexity to the exegetes, see Ibn Hajar (852/1448), Fath al-bari (Cairo: n.p.; n.d. [1319-20 A.H.]), III, 126-29. For other versions of this hadith in the major Sunni collections of hadith, see A. J. Wensinck, Concordances et indices de la tradition musulmane (Leiden: E. J.

Though Q. 9:84 names no names, it is interpreted by the exegetes as a rebuke of Muhammad's action: "And pray thou never over any of them when he is dead, nor stand over his grave; they disbelieved in God and His Messenger, and died while they were ungodly (Fasiquin)." (15) While the Qur'an had rebuked the Prophet for having prayed over Ibn Ubayy, the jurists were careful to restrict the legal implications of this epi- sode to the Prophet himself. The criterion of membership in the Muslim community was formal profession of the faith, and by this criterion even the munafiqfun were Muslims. According to al-Shafi'i, it was only the Prophet who had been commanded not to pray over them, but neither God nor the Prophet forbade others from doing so. ('6) Conversely, because it was not obligatory for everyone to participate in Muslim funerals so long as some Muslims were doing so, there was room for an individual boycott of a "hypocrite's" funeral. Thus the caliph 'Umar b. al-Khatt~b "sat away from" the funerals of those he knew to have been "hypocrites" as long as others were available to pray over the deceased. ("7) Yet, instances in which a proper burial was in fact denied to the deceased, or at least an effort to do so made, are also recorded in the Arabic historical tradition. As in the Jewish tradition, the lack of a proper burial was among the greatest of humiliations imaginable, the ultimate marker of exclusion (14) For reports pertaining to the death and burial of Ibn Ubayy, see al-Waqidi, Maghazi, III, 1057-60; 'Umar b. Shabba, Ta'rikh, I, 369-73. For another report regarding the practice of burial in the Prophet's shirt, see Ibn Sa'd (d. 230/845), al-Tabaqat al-kabir, ed. E. Sachau et al. (Leiden: E. J. Brill, 1904-17), IV, pt. ii. 33 ('Abdallah b. al-Harith b. 'Abd al-Muttalib). Mu'awiya b. Abi Sufyin, the founder of the Umayyad dynasty, was also buried in the Prophet's shirt and with the Prophet's nails. (Al-Tabari [d. 310/923], Ta'rikh al-rusul wa'l-mulfk, ed. M. J. de Goeje et al. [Leiden: E. J. Brill, 1879-1901], 201. I owe this reference to Prof. Michael Cook.) The Umayyad caliph 'Umar b. 'Abd al-'Aziz (r. 99/717-101/720) too was buried with the Prophet's hair and nails: Ibn Sa'd, Tabaqgt, V, 300. (15) 'Umar b. Shabba.

Unless otherwise indi- cated, the translations from the Qur'an follow A. J. Arberry, The Koran Interpreted (New York: Simon &amp; Schuster, 1996). Also cf. Q. 9:80: "Ask pardon for them, or ask not pardon for them; if thou askest pardon for them seventy times, God will not pardon them; that, because they disbelieved in God and His Messenger; God guides not the people of the ungodly." According to certain accounts, the latter verse, which had already been revealed before Ibn Ubayy's death, was taken by Muhammad as giving him a choice about whether or not to pray for/over the "hypocrites," a choice he decided to exercise until rebuked by Q.9:84 ('Umar b. Shabba, Ta'rikh, 372f.). Another account claims that Muhammad decided to pray seventy-seven times for Ibn Ubayy in the hope of circumventing the Qur'.n's assertion that praying for him "seventy times" would do him no good! ('Umar b. Shabba, Ta'rikh, 1, 371). A number of traditions attribute Muhammad's interest in praying for Ibn Ubayy/enshrouding him in his shirt to his wish to win over the deceased's clansmen (ibid., I, 370f.). (16) Al-Shffi'i, al-Umm, I, 296. Likewise, individuals who had received the capital punishment for adul- tery, or the offspring of an adulterous union (walad zina'), were to be given a Muslim funeral: Malik b. Anas, al-Muwatth' (in the transmission of Yahya b. Yahya al-Laythi), ed. Muhammad Fu'ad 'Abd al-Baqi (Cairo: 'Isa al-Babi al-Halabi, n.d. [1951]), 230; Ibn Abi Shayba, al-Musannaf, III, 254; al-San'ani, al-Musannaf, III, 534ff. For contrary opinions, according to which prayer over one stoned to death is not to be performed, see ibid., III, 535 [no. 6616, 6618]; opinions likewise differed on one who had committed suicide: ibid., 535f. [nos. 6619f.]). (17) Al-Shafi'i, al-Umm, I, 297. 30</page><page sequence="5">DEATH, FUNERAL PROCESSIONS from the community. (8) A poignant early example of such humiliation concerns none other than 'Uthman b. 'Affan, Muhammad's third successor as caliph. 'Uthman was widely accused of having violated the prescriptions of the Qur'an and the sunna, of injustice, and bad faith. Though it was dis- gruntled inhabitants of the garrisons of Iraq and Egypt who eventually mur- dered him, many among the companions of Muhammad in Medina were themselves hostile to him and seem to have had little interest in trying to mitigate the crisis. Al-Tabari gives several accounts of the burial of the mur- dered caliph, the first and most striking of which is worth quoting here: 'Uthmin['s body] was thrown aside and left unburied for three days. Then [two people] ... spoke to 'Ali [b. Abi Talib] about his burial, seeking his permis- sion for [Uthman's] family to see to that. 'Ali granted them his permission, but when news of this spread, people lay in wait for ['Uthman's body] by the road, armed with stones. A few members of his family set out with [his body], inten- ding to take him to an enclosure in Medina named Hashsh Kawkab, where the Jews used to bury their dead. Now when his body was brought out before the people, they stoned his bier (sarir) and were bent on throwing him to the ground. When 'Ali heard that, he sent and demanded that they leave him alone. They did so, and ['Uthman's body] was hurried along and interred in Hashsh Kawkab. When Mu'awiya b. Abi Sufyan gained supremacy over the Muslims, he ordered that enclosure to be razed and transferred [Uthman's body] to al-Baqi'. Then he commanded the people to bury their dead around his grave, until ultimately [those graves] adjoined the cemetery of the Muslims (maqabir al-muslimin). ('") That 'Uthm.n was buried, according to this report, in the cemetery of the Jews rather than that of the Muslims is a pointed assertion of the fact, of course, that the rebels did not consider him to be any longer a member of the Muslim community. (20) Some, indeed, had also objected to the performance (18) Cf. Jon Davies, Death. Burial and Rebirth in the Religions of Antiquity (London: Routledge, 1999), 99. (19) Al-Tabari, Ta'rikh, I, 3046; translation as in The History of al-Tabari. XV, trans. R. S. Humphreys (with minor modifications). The isnad of this account is as follows: Ja'far b. 'Abdallah al-Muhammadi -'Amr b. Hammad and 'Ali b. Husayn -Husayn b. 'Is~ - his father - Aba Maymfina - Abu Bashir al-'Abidi. For other accounts of 'Uthmin's burial, see ibid., 3046-50. (20) As for the two slaves of 'Uthmrn who had been killed along with him, their bodies were, according to one account, thrown out to be devoured by the dogs. Al-Tabari, Ta'rikh, I, 3049; Sayf b. 'Umar, Kitib al-ridda wa'l- futih wa kitab al-jamal wa masir 'A'isha wa 'Ali, ed. Qasim al-SimarrA'i (Leiden: Smitskamp Oriental Antiqua- rium, 1995), 209f. (For some reflections with reference to the Hebrew Bible on the role dogs play in heightening the sense of disgrace in an offender's death, cf. Calum Carmichael, The Spirit of Biblical Law [Athens: University Press of Georgia, 1996], 115ff.) Two other early Islamic examples where a proper funeral/burial was contested or denied are worth citing here: After the Battle of Siffin (37/657), fought between troops loyal to 'Ali and those to Mu'awiya, a supporter of the latter asked Mu'awiya's permission to bury a cousin of his killed fighting on Ali's side, to which Mu'awiya replied: "Do not bury him - they do not deserve that. By God, we were not able to bury [Uthman] Ibn 'Affan except in secrecy." Al-Tabari, I, 3303 (the kinsman did, however, have his way after all). When 'Ali himself was assassinated by a Kharijite in 40/661, his son Hasan executed the assassin whereupon "the people took him [scil. the assassin], wrapped him in mats, and burnt him": al-Tabari, Ta'rikh. I, 3464; other accounts report extensive tor- ture of this Kharijite before he was killed: see al-Baladhuri, Ansab al-ashrf, II (volume dealing with 'All and his sons), ed. Mahmiid al-Firdaws al-'Azm (Damascus: D&amp;r al-yaqza al-'arabiyya, 1996). 361f. 31</page><page sequence="6">MUHAMMAD QASIM ZAMAN of the funeral prayers over him, (21) though they later relented. Other reports do, however, try to give a view of the funeral which is in accord with 'Uthman's later status, among the Sunnis, as one of the "rightly guided caliphs." Thus, an account reported by Sayf b. 'Umar maintains that 'Uthman's funeral was attended by "most of the Companions who were pre- sent [in Medina]. Meantime boys and women assembled in the place set aside for funerals.... Afterwards they took him to al-BaqI' and buried him there, in the part adjacent to Hashsh Kawkab." (22) That "most of the Com- panions" prayed over him is meant to suggest, of course, that they were sup- porting 'Uthman rather than the rebels, who alone are to be held responsible for this tragic turn of events; and the report makes clear that the caliph was buried in the Baqi', that is, within the Muslim graveyard, for all that the burial spot may have been adjacent to the Jewish cemetery. While the funerals of those deemed to have been wayward in their belief or practice were usually allowed to take place, instances of individual boycotts of such funerals were not uncommon. Boycotting funerals was, of course, part of a more general boycott of such wayward individuals: their company was shunned, their hadith was not written (or if already written, the notebooks containing the materials in question might be erased or otherwise destroyed), and their bad credentials made known to others. Many such indi- viduals are characterized in our sources as the people of bid'a or ahwa', of wayward beliefs and mere "whims". (23) Given that "one who walks towards an adherent of bid'a (sahib bid'a walks in aiding the demolition of Islam", as one hadith puts it, (24) the boycott of such individuals was deemed neces- sary. Specifically in the context of funerals, a tradition such as the foregoing would probably have meant that to be part of the ahl al-bid'a's funeral was to abet their unacceptable innovations. Thus, on seeing the approaching funeral of one 'Amr b. Thabit b. Abi'l-Miqdam al-Kfifi, the noted Khurasani traditionist and ascetic 'Abdalldh b. al-Mubarak (d. 181/797) ran into the mosque, shut its door, and stayed there until the procession had passed. (25) The deceased, it is explai- ned, had the reputation of reviling the pious forbears (salaf) (26) a familiar polemical motif which usually signals a strong Shi'i proclivity on the part of (21) 'Umar b. Shabba, Ta'rikh, IV, 1306f.; al-Tabari, Ta'rikh, I, 3048. (22) Al-Tabadr, Ta'rikh, I, 3049 (emphasis added); Sayf b. 'Umar, KitAb al-ridda wa'l- futMh, 208f. For an interpretation of Sayf b.

Ibn al-Mubarak used to instruct people not to narrate traditions from this individual, (27) and the boycott of his funeral was clearly meant to underscore the same point. His boycott was apparently also meant to show others how to deal with such individuals. It is reported that Hibban b. 'Ali (d. 171/787-8), a Kufan jurist, would "feign sleep" in order to avoid rebu- king this same 'Amr for his views on the pious forbears. (28) It was such negligence that Ibn al-Mubarak apparently sought to remedy by his conspi- cuous boycott of 'Amr's funeral. Such boycotts may well have carried other implications as well. Ibn al- Mubarak was well-known for his extensive monetary patronage, (29) and it is conceivable that boycotting the funeral of someone deemed to be wayward would have brought home the message to those hoping for a share of the patronage that an espousal of certain beliefs would entail their exclusion from the scholar's favour, in life as in death. The same may have been true of a younger Khurdsdni contemporary of Ibn al-Mubarak, al-Husayn b. al- Walid al-Naysdbari (d. 202 or 203/817-18), who was also well-known for his generous patronage (kdna yuizil al-'atiyya li'l-nds). (30) Though we do not know anything about how he conducted himself at particular funerals, a tradition he transmitted gives us a fair inkling of where he would have drawn the limits of his circle of patronage: &lt;&lt;The Prophet said, 'Do not revile my companions. Towards the end of time, there will come about a people who will revile my companions; if they [sc. the revilers] are sick, do not visit them; if they die, do not witness [their death]; do not marry with them; do not mutually inherit from them; do not greet them; and do not pray [sc. fune- ral prayers] over them.'" (31) The funerals of those known to have had Murji'ite leanings are reported to have been boycotted by many among the ahl al-sunna and the ashAb al- hadith. The Murji'a held that it was faith alone, irrespective of the quality of one's acts, which defined one as a believer. Though this position was to be largely accepted by the Sunnis of later times, in the late second and third centuries it was the cause of bitter opposition against the Murji'a on the part of the ashdb al-hadith. (32) The latter defined themselves not only in spirited opposition to all groups they saw as falling into erroneous and wayward beliefs - such as the Murji'a, for instance, or the rationalist theologians, or the extremist Shi'a - but also, from the late 2nd/8th century onwards, in (27) Ibid., III, 262.

(33) Not all traditionists were opposed equally vehemently to the Murji'a, even in Kifa (") - where the Murji'a were prominent - although there were those who considered such leanings to be a sufficient basis to boycott their funerals. The Kifan traditionist Sufyan al-Thawri was especially virulent in his opposition to the Murji'a, considering them, as he put it, to be the farthest of all from the "Book of God." ('5) He and a fellow traditionist, Salih b. Hayy, did not therefore attend the funeral of the prominent Kifan Murji'ite Mis'ar b. Kidam. (36) On ano- ther occasion, just as the funeral prayers over one 'Abd al-'Aziz b. Abi Rawwad were about to be performed, and the people were already standing in rows in preparation for the prayers, Sufyan's sudden appearance caused some excitement. The presence of such a noted scholar would surely have lent great posthumous prestige to the dead man. But Sufyan was apparently there only to emphasize his lack of respect for the deceased, who was a Murji'ite; as people made room for him so he could stand beside them in prayer, he merely walked past the gathering making his refusal to pray all the more conspicuous. (37) Waki' b. al-Jarrah, who succeeded Sufyin al- Thawri as the leading traditionist of Kifa, (38) continued the practice of boy- cotting the Murji'a's funerals. ("39) A variety of statements attributed to Ibn Hanbal urge the boycott of the Murji'a's funerals, (4) and, indeed, of any prayers led by a person of Murji'ite leanings. (41) The theological controversy between the ahl al-kalam and the ashab al- hadith over whether the Qur'an was the "created" or the "uncreated" word of God has also left its residue in what we can reconstruct of the history of early Islamic funerals. In 218/833, the caliph al-Ma'min decided to enforce the doctrine that the Qur'An was God's "created" word, and had judges and (33) That juristic thought and legal practice could be based on what Joseph Schacht characterized as the "living tradition" of the ancient schools of law rather than on specific reports from the Prophet was completely unaccep- table to them; and luminaries of the ashdb al-hadith were known to have spent their entire lives collecting, sifting through, and building repertoires of traditions which were to serve as the basis of the community's religious life and practice.

Anyone not subscribing to this doctrine was to be barred from narrating hadith or testi- fying before the judge as a credible witness. (42) One's credentials as a scho- lar and even one's probity and hence social standing were made contingent, during this Inquisition - the Mihna - on assent to the Qur'an's createdness. (43) But in some cases the punishment for nonconformity was harsher. Many recalcitrant scholars were transported from the provincial centers to the capi- tal, or to the caliph's camp at Tarsus; and several were imprisoned, tortured, and a few killed during the reign of the two immediate successors of al- Ma'm(n under whom the Mihna remained in effect. When Nu'aym b. Hammtd, a traditionist who had refused to accept the caliph's position on the Qur'an, died in prison (228/844), "he was dragged with his chains and thrown in a pit; [his body was] not covered with a shroud, and it was not prayed over." (") The body of another member of the ashab al-hadith, Ahmad b. Nasr al-Khuza'i, accused of plotting against the caliph though actually executed for non-conformity to the caliphal position on the created- ness of the Qur'an, was put on public display in the same enclosure as had the body of the notorious Iranian rebel Bdbak, and a note was attached to his ear proclaiming him, inter alia, to be an "infidel" (kafir), a "polytheist" (mushrik), and one who was utterly misguided (dall). (45) Given the treatment of many among the ashab al-hadith during the Mihna, it is not surprising to see the latter striking back with a vengeance as soon as they had the opportunity. According to views attributed to Ibn Hanbal, one was not to perform funeral prayers over those who espoused the Qur'an's createdness - often characterized, for this and other beliefs as the "Jahmiyya". (4) Asked who was to perform funeral prayers over a "Jahmi" who died in a village where only Christians were to be found, Ibn Hanbal is said to have responded, "I would [still] not pray over him. Let him who wants to, pray over him."

It is said that he refused to transmit hadith on the authority of these scholars, ("4) and he did not even participate in the funerals of some of them. (4") Funeral as markers of authority A variety of traditions record the instructions allegedly left by the dying man about how his funeral was to be conducted. (") It was not uncommon to specify that one's death was not to be publicly announced (adhdn/idhan). (51) There are also occasional reports pointing to a certain struggle over who would lead the funeral prayers. In particular, when the deceased was a distinguished "orthodox" scholar, the governor or the local representative of the state was often eager to lead the funeral in order, evi- dently, to publicly emphasize the state's patronage of widely respected individuals. (52) On the death of Ahmad b. Hanbal, for instance, it was (48) TB, X. 419 (no. 5578); Ibn al-Jawzi, Mana~ib, 388. (49) For instance, he is reported to have boycotted, on these grounds, the funeral of the ascetic Abo Nasr al-Tammdr (d. 228/842): TB, X, 420 (no. 5578). On this, see below. (50) See, for instance, the caliph al-Ma'man's instructions regarding his funeral and burial: al-Tabari, Ta'rikh. III, 1136f. Though many early Muslim religious scholars left behind guidelines about how their funerals were to be handled (cf. the following note), such instructions are unusual for the caliphs. In view of al-Ma'man's extraordinary interest in ancient Greek learning, it is tempting to speculate whether he was self- consciously trying to model himself on the example of the Greek philosophers (even though the content of his dying instructions does not reveal any extra-Islamic influences). As Shaye Cohen observes, "Burial and memorial services are common topics in the wills of the philosophers. Aristotle, Theophrastus, Strato and Lyco instruct their heirs/executors how they must be buried." Shaye J. D. Cohen, "Patriarchs and Scho- larchs," Proceedings of the American Academy for Jewish Research, XLVIII (1981), 67. (51) Adhan/idhdn in the context of death and funerals does not refer to the public call to ritual prayers but is rather to be understood as the act of making a death in question publicly known. On this basic sense of the term, see Ibn Manzar, Lisdn al-'arab (Beirut: Ddr Sadir, 1956), XIII, s.v. "A-DH-N". For instances in which various individuals left behind instructions against this practice, see Ibn Sa'd, Tabaqct, V, 106 (Sa'id b. al-Musayyib); ibid., V, 163 ('Ali b. al-Husayn b. Abi Tdlib); ibid., VI, 61f. ('Alqama b. Qays). VI, 73f. ('Amr b. Shurahbil); VI, 99 (Shurayh the q.di). For characterizations of adhan/idhdn as a pre-Isla- mic, JJhili practice, see al-San'ani, Musannaf, III, 390 (nos. 6053); also cf. Ibn Sa'd, VI, 73f. (where it is characterized as "jihiliyya aw da'wa al-jdhiliyya" and is also related to the pre-Islamic Arab tradition of wailing over the dead). But for traditions which allow adhan/idhmn, with reference to Muhammad's own practice, see al-San'ani, Musannaf, III, 390f. (no. 6056f.) Also cf. Ibn Sa'd, Tabagat IV, pt. i, 21, on the announcement of the death of al-'Abbas, the Prophet's uncle, by his clan, the Banu Hashim. The proce- dure was to send out a "mu'addhin" to announce the death; Griitter, "Arabische Bestattungsbrduche," Der Islam. XXXI. 152. It is worth considering if the funeral adh.n also had any relation with the Jewish practice of sounding the shofar to announce a death. Among the Jews, this use of the shofar is attested for Babylonia ca. 400 C.E. Cf. Encyclopaedia Judaica (Jerusalem and New York: Macmillan, 1971), XIV, s.v. "Shofar"; Davies, 105. Conversely, late antique rabbinic sages sometimes also left behind instructions against being mourned or eulogized: Lee I. Levine, The Rabbinic Class of Roman Palestine in Late Antiquity (Jerusalem: Yad Izhak Ben-Zvi Press, 1989), 63. (Rabbi Judah, who instructed his companions "not [to] eulogize me in the towns' also laid down however that "he who attended me during my lifetime will attend me at my death." Quoted in Levine, 63; for this and other traditions on the death of Rabbi Judah, also see Cohen, "Patriarchs and Scho- larchs," 60ff.) (52) Cf. Ibn Sa'd, Tabaqat, IV, pt. i, 138 (the funeral of 'Abdalldah b. 'Umar led by the notorious Umayyad governor, al-Hajjdj, against the wishes of the deceased). 36</page><page sequence="11">DEATH, FUNERAL PROCESSIONS Muhammad b. 'Abdallah b. Tahir, the governor of Baghdad, who led the funeral prayers for him, despite the wishes to the contrary of Ibn Hanbal's own family. (53) Sometimes, a person might not be invited to join, or be allowed to lead, a funeral on account of his strained relations with the deceased. (5) I have not, however, come across any instances where those perceived as wayward were actually prevented, on account of such a per- ception, from attending a funeral. That is, while the funeral of someone viewed as espousing wayward doctrines was often boycotted, as seen in the preceding section, there seems to be no evidence that the ahl al-bida' were also prevented from attending the funeral of a distinguished scholar. (55) Rather, wide attendance at funerals, and, as will be seen later, even the attendance of non-Muslims, was usually a mark of the deceased's autho- rity. Muslim participation in the funeral of non-Muslims is usually not mentioned, and for perhaps understandable reasons. ("6) In general, the information about funerals in biographical dictionaries and other classical Arabic sources remains extremely sketchy. While the date and place of a scholar's death are almost invariably reported, as often is much other incidental information about him, reports about the funeral itself (53) Silih b. Ahmad b. Hanbal (d. 265/878), Sirat al-imim Ahmad ibn Hanbal, ed. Fu'ad 'Abd al- Mun'im Ahmad (Alexandria: Mu'assasat shabAb al-jami'a, 1981), 137f.; Hanbal b. Ishaq b. Hanbal (d. 273/886), Dhikr mihnat al-imim Ahmad ibn Hanbal. ed. Muhammad Naghsh (Cairo: N.p., 1977), 112. Note that while the jurists assign to the ruler the authority to lead or to deputize someone for the Friday and other communal prayers (e.g., the prayers on occasion of'id, solar and lunar eclipse, and in a time of drought), they do not talk about funeral prayers in this context at all; the implication is that such prayer is to be left to the people, just as the daily prayers in "private" (as opposed to "state") mosques is to be left to them. Cf., for ins- tance, al-Mawardi (d. 450/1058), al-Ahkim al-sultiniyya (Cairo: Matba'at al-watan, 1298 A.H.), 96-103; Abu Ya'15 b. al-Farra' (d. 458/1065), al-Ahkim al-sultAniyya, ed. Muhammad HAmid al-Fiqi (Cairo: MustafA al-Bdbi al-Halabi, 1357 A.H.), 78-90. For a sample of some early views on who is most fit to lead a funeral prayer, see al-San'Ani, al-Musannaf. III, 471-73. Also cf. al-Shifi'i, al-Umm, I, 313, where he states his own preference for "the kinsman (wali) as more entitled [to lead the prayer] than the governor (wyli)", but he also notes the opposite view. (54) The relations between Muhammad's first successor, Abu Bakr, and Muhammad's daughter, Fatima were strained, for instance, and when she died six months after her father, Abi Bakr was not invited to join her funeral. 'Umar b. Shabba, Ta'rikh, I, 196f. Also see ibid., III, 1050, for the instructions left behind by 'Abdalldh b. Mas'id, a famous companion of the Prophet, that the caliph 'Uthmrn, with whom he was on bad terms, was not to preside over his funeral. Cf. 'Uthman's reaction (in ibid.): "Were it not that this would become a sunna, I would have pulled him out (of his grave) in order to pray over him!" (55) Hanbali sources testify to the presence of unnamed "innovators" (ashb bida') at Ibn Hanbal's fune- ral. Appearing in a dream after his death, Ibn Hanbal reported that those who had prayed over him had been forgiven. When reminded that there had been innovators among them, he stated that the latter had been "rewarded" (presumably in a way which amounted to something less than salvation). Ibn Abi Ya'lI Tabaqgt al-Handbila, I, 103. This report does not, however, say anything about the non-Muslims who are also suppo- sed to have participated in his funeral. Ibn Hanbal's funeral will be discussed later in this paper. (56) There are exceptions, however. See Ibn Abi Shayba, al-Musannaf, III, 347f. on the discussion of whether it was appropriate for a person to participate in the funeral of his non-Muslim relative (the instances adduced refer to Arabian polytheists and Christians, and the answer is a qualified 'yes'). Other examples: The funeral of the chief of the Rabi' a tribe, who was a Christian, included Muslims as well. See Henri Lammens, ltudes sur le rAgne du calife omaiyade Mo'dwia ler (Paris, 1908), 436, cited in Elizabeth Savage, A Gate- way to Hell, A Gateway to Paradise: The North African Response to the Arab Conquest (Princeton: Darwin Press, 1997), 93; also cf. al-Tabari, Ta'rikh, I, 3460, cited in Morony, Iraq after the Muslim Conquest, 455, for yet another instance. 37</page><page sequence="12">MUHAMMAD QASIM ZAMAN are uncommon at best. Such is often the case with even some of the most prominent religious scholars of their time. (57) We must bear in mind, there- fore, that the lack of information on a funeral does not necessarily suggest that it was poorly attended; after all, the fact of poor attendance itself was sometimes commented on. (5") On the other hand, it may not always be pos- sible to know why the funeral of a particular individual was well-attended, or what, if anything that might mean for the broader social and religious his- tory of the time. Such questions are nevertheless worth asking for those indi- viduals, from the first centuries of Islam, who are in fact described in bio- graphical dictionaries as having had well-attended funerals. In what follows, I shall provide brief notes on a number of late second and early to middle-third century scholars whose funerals are mentioned in the biographical dictionaries. Though we know something about the funerals of certain earlier figures as well (5"), it is only from the late second century that we begin to be learn about a number of roughly contemporary or near contemporary figures. That is, it is only from this time onward that one can begin to perceive the contours of certain evolving religious trends in the light of the reports about the funerals of particular individuals. My notes on these scholars are not intended to go beyond identifying them in terms of reports which may shed some light on the significance of their funerals. And in the interest of economy, I have adopted the famous funeral of Ibn Hanbal as the cutoff point of this sample. Al-Awzi'i (d. 157/774): Among the foremost legal scholars of his age (6), al-Awz'il also left behind a considerable reputation for his active role as a local patron and protector of the interests of the people, Muslims as well as non-Mus- (57) Random examples would include such prominent scholars of hadith as the Basran Shu'ba b. al- Hajjaj (d. 160/776; on him, TB, IX, 255-66 [no. 4830]; the KOfan Sufyan b. 'Uyayna (d. 196/811, in Mecca: on him: TB, IX, 173-83 [no. 4764]); the Basran 'Affan b. Muslim al-Saffar (d. 220/935, in Baghdad; on him: TB, XII, 264-72 [no. 6715]; see ibid., 272 where one person even mentions being present at 'Affin's fune- ral, but says nothing about the character of the funeral itself. (58) Cf. the case of al-Harith b. Asad al-MuhAsibi, who earned Ibn Hanbal's disapproval on account of his indulgence in kaldm: "So Ahmad b. Hanbal parted company with him, and [al-Muhisibi] hid himself in his house in Baghdad, and died there. No more than four people prayed over him...' TB, VIII, 211 (no. 4330). (59) For example: the funeral of al-'Abbas, from which "no man, woman, or child stayed back": Ibn Sa'd, Tabaqat, IV, pt. i, 22. (Note that Muhammad b. 'Umar al-Waqidi, Ibn Sa'd's immediate source for this report. was a qAdi in the service of the 'Abbasids, the descendants of al-'Abbas - hence a possible interest in glori- fying accounts of the funeral.) For other reports on al-'Abbds' funeral, see ibid., IV, pt. i, 21f. Ibid., V. 148: the funeral of Salim b. 'Abdallah, a grandson of the caliph 'Umar b. al-Khattab. The Umayyad caliph Hishim b. 'Abd al-Malik was in Medina at this time and led the funeral prayers over Salim. Seeing the number of people present, the caliph is said to have increased the number of military conscripts from Medina to 4000, and this year (106) itself came to be remembered as "the year of the four thousand." Ibid., VII, pt. i, 129: Hasan b. Abi'l-Hasan al-Basri (d. 110/728), the noted ascetic and theologian. Ibn Sa'd reports that Hasan's body "was taken out [for burial] only after the people had departed", which presumably means that too many people had wanted to participate in his funeral.

(6') This role of acting as a protector and patron of the populace, in the city and beyond, has strong parallels with the role of the bishop and holy man in late antiquity (61), and there is no reason to suppose that Muslim holy men and scholars would not have adapted well to what the inhabitants of a city expected of them. This role provides at least some of the context in which tra- ditions about his funeral are to be seen. One Salim b. al-Mundhir reported: "Hearing the cry regarding the death of al-Awzia'i, I came out and the first thing I saw was a Christian who had poured ashes on his head. (The Muslims of Bei- rut would continue to recognize him for this.) Four communities (umam) came out for the funeral, though none was with the other (laysa minha wahida ma'a sahibatiha): we, the Muslims, came out carrying him, and the Jews came out [and remained?] on one side, the Christians (al-nasdra) on one side, and the Copts (al-qibt) on one side." (63) This account is as remarkable for noting the presence of non-Muslims in the funeral procession, as it is for emphasizing the presence of each as a dis- tinct "community", self-consciously keeping away from other confessional communities. (6) The insistence that the communities kept away from each other may, perhaps, be taken to indicate a certain ambivalence in this report about exactly what to make of the non-Muslim presence: on the one hand, it is, of course, a mark of the dead man's stature that everybody wants to join in; but, on the other hand, and from the perspective of later Muslims at least, such participation also threatens to blur religious boundaries. Hence, per- haps, the need to underline that it was "we", the Muslims, who were carrying the body, and the other communities, while participating, remained at a safe distance. Traditions about the participation of members of different confessional communities in a funeral are common motifs in descriptions of late antique Christian saints. We shall briefly return to such traditions later in this essay. Sufyin al-Thawri (d. 161/778): Sufyan was one of the most distingui- shed Kufan traditionists, jurists, and ascetics of his time, and one who left a (61) See the text of these letters in Ibn Abi Hatim, Taqdima, 187-202.

(65) A number of reports suggest the eagerness of the 'Abbasids to have him accept some form of royal patronage which was equally matched by the scholar's refusal to oblige. Sufyan's vocal opposition to the ruling house eventually forced him into hiding, a state of affairs which was to continue till the end of his life. (66) Given these circumstances of his life and death, it is not surprising that traditions about his funeral in Basra, where he had died, are conflicting. According to a report in the Tabaqat of Ibn Sa'd, "his bier was brought for- ward suddenly (fuja'atan) before the people of Basra; [even so] people heard about his death and a large number attended [his funeral (wa-shahidahu khalq)]." (67) A report in Ta'rikh Baghdad notes, on the other hand, that he was buried at night, implying that many people were therefore unable to attend the funeral. (68) Other traditions are more dramatic in effect. Accor- ding to one report, when Sufyan died, his body was placed at the door of the congregational mosque. Thereupon, "the official ([or governor?] sultan) came, removed the covering from his [scil. Sufyin's] face, and immersed him in camphor. Then he wrote to the ruler (al-sultan al-a'zam): 'I found Sufyan on a bedstead, already washed and shrouded; I have covered him with (literally: immersed him in) camphor and await your orders regarding him.' A thousand boats (samari) then departed to his funeral, and he was buried after a few days." (9) This last account is plainly hagiographical, but it is not without interest for reflecting the concern of the ruling elite to associate themselves with Sufyan (or his memory) at least in death, after they had failed to do so in life. It is also worth noting that certain elements which comprise this account are attested for other funerals too, and need not be mere topoi. For instance, governors are often known to have insisted on leading the funeral prayer, especially if the deceased was a prominent man. Of the noted Kufan tradi- tionist, Abii Nu'aym al-Fadl b. Dukayn (d. 219/834) (70), it is reported for instance that because his funeral took place very early in the morning many people had remained unaware of his death. His son had asked someone from the family of Ja'far b. Abi Talib to preside over the funeral. This might be taken as an indication of the deceased's pro-Shi'i proclivities and was pos- sibly also meant (or at least perceived) as an affront to the ruling 'Abbasid house, which saw this and other Shi'i families as a threat to their own legi- timist claims. The governor, displeased at what had transpired, went so far as to remove the dead man from the grave (thumma tanahha bihi 'an al-qabr) and prayed over him again, along with the people who had come to join him (65) Cf. EI(2), s.v. (H. P. Raddatz). (66) On some of these traditions, see Zaman, Religion and Politics, 79f., 165f. (67) Ibn Sa'd, Tabaqgt, 260. (68) TB, IX, 171 (no. 4763).

(71) Leading the funeral prayer was thus fraught with symbolic significance, and it is not unlikely that by associating himself with Sufyan's funeral the governor might similarly have sought to dampen the edge of the dead scholar's opposition to the ruling house. DIiwfd b. Nuqayr al-TW'i (d. 165/781-82): A Kffan who began his career by studying fiqh with Abti Hanifa (72), Dawid later became an asce- tic (ta'abbada) and "sat in his house" for nearly twenty years. (73) He is said to have given away his considerable inheritance to the needy (74), while him- self practising extreme acts of self-deprivation which included fasting for forty years. (75) Indeed, he is said to have counselled "fasting through the world (al-dunyi) and making death the occasion to break the fast." (76) While suggesting that one "flee from the people as you would flee from a wild beast," he, paradoxically, also insisted that one not abandon the Community (iama'a). (77) His funeral was attended by "an enormous crowd," according to the aforementioned Kffan traditionist Abu Nu'aym al-Fadl b. Dukayn - who himself was prevented from approaching the bier because of the crowd. (78) The Ta'rikh Baghdad gives two versions of an oration which the ascetic Ibn al-Sammak is said to have delivered at Dawuid's graveside after the latter had been buried (7"): ... you heard hadith but you left it to others to narrate it; you developed an understanding in the religion of God (tafahhamta fi din Allh), but you left it to them to give legal opinions. (so) Covetousness did not degrade you...; you did not accept a present from the ruler, nor a gift from the "brothers" [scil. companions on the ascetic path]. You imprisoned yourself in your house, with no one to converse with you (fa-la muhaddith laka), no curtain on your (71) Ibn Sa'd, Tabagqt, VI, 280. Another well-attested motif in the last mentioned report on Sufydn's funeral relates to the provision of items to be used in preparing the body for burial (in this case, the gover- nor's use of camphor). Reports about the funeral of Ibn Hanbal relate that when the governor learnt of the death, he sent a shroud and balms to Ibn Hanbal's sons, but the gift was declined. Hanbal b.

On him, see TB, II, 445-49 (no. 967); Aba Nu'aym, Hilya, VIII, 222-38 (no. 401). Ibn al-SammAk's reputation as a holy man and preacher is attested to by his having been invited to visit Baghdad and preach before the caliph Hrfun al-Rashid. The ascetic obliged, and the caliph is reported to have wept profusely at his admonitions (TB, II, 448f.). (80) The implication here is that narrating traditions and giving legal opinions had become a path to worldly success and to assertions of religious authority. Hence, despite his scholarly stature, Dawiid al-Td'i would have nothing to do with such vocations.

If the servant did not incline towards asceticism in the world for anything but love of such beautiful gathering, and [such] a vast following, it would be a justified effort... (8") The second version of Ibn al-Sammak's funeral oration depicts the gathe- red crowd in a more interactive mode: When Dawud al-Ta'i died, people followed his janaza; and when he was buried, Ibn al-Sammak stood up on his grave and said: "O Dawfid, you used to stay awake during the night while the people slept" - whereupon all the people said, "true!"; "you used to reap profits while people suffered loss" - and the people said, "true!"; "you remained blameless (kunta taslamu) when the people were engrossed [in error?

(82) Abfi Mushir 'Abd al-A'li al-Ghassini (d. 218/833): One of the most eminent traditionists and scholars of his time, his stature in his native Damascus was such that "when he went to the mosque, people would line up on the right and on the left, greeting him and kissing his hand." (83) He was transported to al-Ma'mmin's camp in al-Raqqa to be interrogated by the caliph about his stance on the Qur'an. Under threat of execution, he ack- nowledged the createdness of the Qur'an, but the caliph failed to be impres- sed by the sincerity of his conviction. He was consequently imprisoned in Baghdad where he died shortly afterwards. It is reported that when his body was brought out of prison for burial, "a large number of people from among the inhabitants of Baghdad witnessed" the funeral.

Ibn Abi Hatim cites a report according to which the caliph al-Mutawakkil, in whose reign Ibn Hanbal had died, ordered that the area where people had gathered for the funeral be measured, whereupon it was found to be able to accommodate a million and a half people. ('6) Many accounts assert, indeed, that there had never been a greater Muslim funeral pro- cession than Ibn Hanbal's; it was rivalled only by funerals "among the Children of Israel."

From Sdlih's own account it is not clear whether "the people" did not know at the time that Ibn Hanbal had died, or that his son, Salih. had been prevented from leading the prayers over him. Hanbal b. Ishaq's account does specify, however, that it was the latter (Dhikr mihnat al-imm,. 112). (106) Ibn Abi Hatim, Taqdima, 312 (on the authority of Abfi Zur'a al-Dimashqi).

A number of traditions attributed to the Prophet suggest a specific connection between the way the dead person was remembered and his salvation; indeed, such factors were recognized to influence the decea- sed's prospects in the other world.

At least some scholars may have had misgivings about the implications of such traditions, as we shall see; but for many others, such funerals were a mark not just of public reverence for the said individuals but also of divine approbation. By the third/ninth century, the evidence of fune- rals would have fitted well with the emergent Sunni doctrine that support of the common people signified the truth of a doctrine. This idea is strikingly expressed in a remark attributed to Ibn Hanbal: "Say to the people of inno- vations: 'Let there be between us and you the day of the funerals!" (20) What we know of funerals such as those discussed above comes, of course, from biographical dictionaries devoted primarily to scholars of hadith and law. Works such as the Tabaqat of Ibn Sa'd, where a number of these funerals are noted, were products of the same milieu and expressed much the same world- view as did the aforementioned scholars themselves (12').

Mastfir [d. 385/995]), the person whose funeral occasioned this remark, see TB, XIV, 326-28 ([no. 7650]; this biographical notice does not, however, say anything about his funeral). (121) Some of the scholars whose funerals are mentioned in the Tabaqdit died after Ibn Sa'd (d. 230/845), so their notices must have been added, or completed, by the Tabagqt's later transmitters. Many of these individuals were, in any case, not just contemporaries of Ibn Sa'd but also people who often frequented the same circles and were otherwise in contact with each other. For example, Ibn Sa'd had heard hadith from al-Qaw-ridi (cf. TB. II. 369 [no. 876]), the traditionist whose funeral is mentioned in the Tabaqait; and of Ibn Hanbal, it is mentioned that he used to send his cousin Hanbal b. Ishlq every Friday to borrow two parts of the hadith corpus of al-Waqidi from Ibn Sa'd, and to return them by next Friday and borrow two more. (TB, II, 369f. [no. 876].) Though Ibn Sad may himself have attended some of the funerals he speaks of, just as others may have been attended by those respon- sible for "completing" the notices in the Tabaqat after his death, this is not mentioned in any of the biographical notices of the scholars in question. 47</page><page sequence="22">MUHAMMAD QASIM ZAMAN plainly self-interested motive in presenting these scholars as authoritative and popularly revered figures of their age, and reports about their funerals are but one element in the presentation of such an image. Yet, despite the vested interest, and, indeed, despite the wildly fanciful figures quoted in later works for the funeral of Ibn Hanbal as well as for cer- tain other third/ninth century scholars (122), there are good reasons why reports asserting large popular attendance at particular funerals need not be dismissed out of hand. (23) The foregoing sample of funerals reveals at least three, overlapping bases for social distinction for the individuals in question: a number of them are recognizable as "holy men", several are explicitly mentioned as abna', and most of them were associated with the movement of the ashab al-hadith. Each of these helps place the reports about funerals in a social and religious context and helps us evaluate at least certain aspects of such reports. a) Late Antique Holy Men and their Funerals Sufyan al-Thawri, Dawuid al-Ta'i, Bishr b. al-Harith, Shuja' b. al-Makh- lad, and Ahmad b. Hanbal all had ascetic tendencies. There is much in the teachings and practices attributed to Dawfid b. Nusayr al-Td'i and Bishr b. al-Harith, in particular, which fits nicely with the styles of piety and asceti- cism characteristic of late antique holy men. ("4) There are, moreover, ins- tructive parallels between the role of many a late antique bishop and holy man and prominent Muslim scholars of Islam's second and third centuries, as already noted with reference to al-Awza'i. The protection of the weak, (122) Examples from the third century include: Muhammad b. Aslam al-Tfisi (d. 242/856), a noted holy man (Hilya, 252f. [no. 445], on him, see below); the famed Egyptian Stifi Dhu'n-Nan Thawbdin b. Ibraihim ([d. 246/859] TB, VIII, 393f. [no. 4497]); al-Fath b. Abi'l-Fath Shukhruf b. Dawfd b. Muzahim (d. 273/887), a Hanbali traditionist and ascetic (Ibn Abi Ya'la, Tabagat al-Hanabila, I, 240 [no. 361]); 'Abdallah, the son of Ahmad b. Hanbal ([d. 290/903]. ibid., I, 181 [no. 249]); the Hanbali al-Husayn b. 'Abdallah Abi 'Ali al- Khiraqi ([d. 299/912], ibid., II, 40 [no. 589]). Fourth century examples include: Abii Bakr b. Abi Dawfid (d. 316/929), the son of the noted traditionist Abii Dawiid al-Sijistdini (ibid., II, 47 [no. 595]); the Sifi Ghulam al-Khallal ([d. 363/974], ibid., II, 110 [no. 611]); Ibrahim b. Thabit al-Hanbali ([d. 376/986-7], ibid., II, 121 [no. 615]). (123) Further, though certain late 3rd/9th century scholars are said to have received impressive funerals, there seems to me to be no compelling reason to suppose that descriptions of early or mid-3rd/9th century funerals are either topoi or mere backward projections from a time when the Hanbalis controlled the streets of Baghdad and often appeared in force at particular funerals. Such an excessively sceptical view would have to explain why only a few people from the early 3rd/9th or indeed the 2nd/8th century are said to have had memorable funerals, and, conversely, if large funerals should have been a topos, why should nothing have been said of the funerals of most of the late 3rd/9th century scholars (of any persuasion). (124) On the "holy man" of late antiquity, see, inter alia: Peter Brown, "The Rise and Function of the Holy Man in Late Antiquity," in idem, Society and the Holy in Late Antiquity (Berkeley: University of Cali- fornia Press, 1982), 103-52; idem, "Town, Village and Holy Man: The Case of Syria," ibid., 153-65; idem, Authority and the Sacred: Aspects of the Christianisation of the Roman World (Cambridge: Cambridge Uni- versity Press, 1995); Patricia Cox, Biography in Late Antiquity: A Quest for the Holy Man (Berkeley: Uni- versity of California Press, 1983).

It would be very much in keeping with the vene- ration for such holy men if one wanted to partake of the "saint's" blessings by being present at his funeral as well. ('25) The Syriac Life of Saint Simeon Stylites, for instance, gives an extended account of the funeral of the saint (who died in 459 C.E.), with his body, laid on a chariot, "surrounded by commanders, princes, city prefects, many sol- diers and a crowd no one could remember or estimate. Villages came out with great diligence - men and women, old and young, unmarried youths and virgins, slaves and free-born - to greet him and be blessed by him as they burnt incense and lit candles." (126) Of the funeral of Basil of Caesarea, Gre- gory of Nazianzus claimed in his oration that "squares, porticoes, houses of two and three stories were filled with people escorting him, preceding, fol- lowing, accompanying and treading upon one another, many thousands of every race and age, a sight unknown before that day.... A contest arose bet- ween our people and outsiders, pagans, Jews, strangers, as to who should lament the more and thereby gain the greater benefit. In short, the calamity became a source of danger. Many souls departed along with him as a result of violent pushing and tumult." ("7) In late antique Alexandria, to cite yet another instance, funerals afforded important "opportunities for ceremonial processions. During the early Byzantine period, the typical pattern was for the deceased to be honored in such a way that 'the whole city made a pro- cession for him, including the bishop, with lights and incense.'" (28") Despite their obviously schematic character and their many topoi (crowds no one could remember having seen before; every race and age represented; competition between different religious communities to venerate the dead saint; "our people" and "outsiders", etc.) the basic contention of these (125) It was reported by one S aid (whom I have been unable to identify) that when 'Abdalldh b. al-Faraj, a friend of Bishr b. al-.Hirith and an ascetic in his own right, died "I attended his funeral and after I had buried him I saw him, in a dream that night, sitting at the edge of his grave, looking at a scroll (sahifa) which was with him. I said to him: How did God treat you?. He said, "He forgave me, and He forgave everyone who accompanied my funeral. I said, I was among them. He said, Here's your name in the scroll."

(129) Mobilization of large crowds was central to the construction and display of the holy man's or bishop's authority in late antique cities, as Peter Brown and others have shown (30); and large funerals were no doubt among the markers of such authority. There were many and important differences between the institutional position of the late antique bishop and prominent Muslim religious scholars or holy men, of course. But so far as popular veneration for the deceased at the time of the funeral is concerned, what is true of the Christian late antiquity seems mutatis mutan- dis, to hold for the first centuries of Islam as well. (3) Parallels between late antique Christian funerals continue to be instruc- tive not only when the funerals were impressive but also when they were not. Precisely because an impressive funeral was a mark of one's social stan- ding, there were holy men who wished to be buried in anonymity. Thus, the mid-seventh century Life of Symeon the Fool by Leontius of Neopolis notes that the saint, "not wanting to obtain human honor after his death", hid him- self in his hut and died there. The two men who found his body two days later "lifted him up without washing him, and they went out without psalm singing, candles, or incense, and buried him in the place where strangers are buried." Yet this unceremonious funeral was meant to be the occasion for Symeon's true stature as a saint to come to light: for as he was being taken to the cemetery, a former Jew, whom Symeon had converted to Christianity, (129) For accounts of or observations regarding late antique funerals, in addition to those already noted, see Hans J.

(130) On the late antique bishop as "controller of crowds," see Brown, Power and Persuasion, 103ff. Cf. ibid., 84f.: "The citizen body was no abstraction in late antiquity. It became a reality by assembling on fre- quent occasions in the great theaters and hippodromes that remained an enduring feature of late Roman urban life. The hippodrome of Antioch had room for 80,000 people, the theater of Ephesus, for 24,000." Also cf. idem, Society and the Holy, 247ff. on the rhetoric and "rituals of consensus." On the use of late antique crowds in constructions of authority and in doctrinal disputes, also see Ramsay MacMullen, "The Historical Role of the Masses in Late Antiquity," in idem, Changes in the Roman Empire: Essays in the Ordinary (Prin- ceton: Princeton University Press, 1990), 250-76. (131) Popular veneration at the time of the funeral is worth stressing here. So far as the relics of the dead saint are concerned, while his shrine might of course continue to be much visited and venerated, the idea of dismembering and transporting various parts of his body as relics (as in late antique and medieval Christia- nity), would have horrified most Muslims. Cf. Christopher S. Taylor, In the Vicinity of the Righteous: Ziydira and the Veneration of Muslim Saints in Late Medieval Egypt (Leiden: E. J. Brill, 1999). 54f. On the late antique Christian veneration of relics, see Peter Brown. The Cult of the Saints: Its Rise and Function in Latin Christianity (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1981); on the processions and crowds often accompa- nying such relics, ibid., 7, citing Julian the Apostate's condemnation of the practice of "... the carrying of the corpses of the dead through a great assembly of people, in the midst of dense crowds, staining the eyesight of all with ill-omened sights of the dead. What day so touched with death could be lucky?" 50</page><page sequence="25">DEATH, FUNERAL PROCESSIONS heard invisible music "such as human lips could not sing, and a crowd such as all humanity could not gather." This he promptly reported to the deacon, whereupon "all came to their senses" about who Symeon "the fool" really was. (-32) The instructions attributed to a number of early Muslim figures that their death not be announced can probably be interpreted similarly: "do not inform anyone of my death, take me and throw me in my grave," an ins- truction attributed to the Kifan scholar al-A'mash (d. 148/765), may have more than a passing resemblance to an attitude such as Symeon's. (133) b) The Abni' As noted earlier, a number of individuals from the early third century whose funerals are singled out for comment in the Tabaqat of Ibn Sa'd belonged to the abna', the descendants of the members of the 'Abbasid army from Khurasan. From the foregoing sample of scholars, such individuals include Bishr b. al-Harith, Shuj'" b. al-Makhlad, Isma'il b. Ibrahim b. Bassam, and Ibn Hanbal. As the core supporters of the 'Abbasid dynasty, the ahl Khurasan and their descendants, the abna', had enjoyed great political importance during much of the first century of 'Abbasid rule. ('") Though scattered widely in the 'Abbasid realm, it was with Baghdad that they were primarily associated, for it was there that they were at their strongest. (35) In the civil war between the caliph al-Amin and his brother al-Ma'mun, they had largely sided with the former, but that turned out to be the losing side. The abna's political importance gradually declined after the fall of al-Amin, but they continued to be a very considerable social presence in Baghdad, where they spearheaded the opposition to the pro-Shi'i and other measures adopted by al-Ma'muin. The "traditionalist" movement of Ibn Hanbal found much support among the abna', as indeed, did the vigilante activities of the early Hanbalis of Baghdad.

Leontius was the bishop of Neapolis on the Cyprus. Symeon is believed to have lived in Emesa, in Syria, during the sixth century. The motif of angels praying over the dead because there was no one else to do so also occurs in Ibn Abi Ya' I's account of the funeral of al-Barbahdri (d. 329/941), the notorious leader of the Hanbali vigilantes of Baghdad. He died while in hiding from the authorities, and the only person who prayed over him, besides the angels, was the man hired to ritually bathe his body before burial: Ibn Abi Ya'la.

By the same token, not only were the lives of those whom Baghdad's Hanbalis did not reckon among themselves made difficult, their death too might be turned into an occasion for ignominy. Thus the great exe- gete and jurist al-Tabari, whose views on Ibn Hanbal's stature as a jurist and on certain theological issues were offensive to Hanbalis, had to be buried in his own home, and at night for fear of .Hanbali vigilantes. ('37) c) The Ashib al-Hadith If some of the individuals whose funerals were commented on were asce- tics and holy men and some were from among the abna', most were also known for their association with the movement of the ashab al-hadith. Already in the early third/ninth century, the caliph al-Ma'mun's denuncia- tion of those reluctant to acknowledge the createdness of the Qur'an, among whom there were many ashab al-hadith, had grudgingly acknowledged their popular appeal: The Commander of the Faithful has realized that the broad mass and the overwhelming concentration of the base elements of the ordinary people (hashw al-ra'iyya) and the lower strata of the commonality are those who, in all regions and far horizons of the world, have no farsightedness, or vision.... They consider themselves adherents of the sunna, whereas in every section of the Book of God there is an account related by Him which invalidates their words... Despite all this, they go on to make an outward show of being people of divine truth, the religion and the community of Muslims (ahl al-haqq wa'l- din wa'l-jam'a), and assert that all others are people of false beliefs, infide- lity and schism. (138) To al-Ma'mfin, there is clearly no equation between popular appeal and the rectitude of the position enjoying such appeal; rather, he accuses the opponents of the Qur'an's createdness to be mere rabble-rousers, seeking (137) For al-Tabari's difficulties with the Hanbalis, see Franz Rosenthal, "General Introduction" in The History of al-Tabari, I (Albany: State University of New York Press, 1989), 69ff.; on the necessity to bury him in his own home, ibid., 77f. (Rosenthal is sceptical about these reports, but doesn't show why they ought to be rejected). An interesting contrast to al-Tabari's burial is offered by the case of a prominent Hanbali Muhammad b. Ahmad Ibn Sam'Cin. When he died in Baghdad in 387/997, the funeral prayer was performed over him at his doorstep and he was buried in his house. "But the people became agitated, and it was said: 'why was he prayed over at his doorstep, as is done with the innovators, whereas he was a righteous leader?' Thereupon, he was taken out of his grave ... and carried to the congregational mosque; and a large number followed the funeral procession." Ibn Abi Ya'la, Tabaqat, II, 138 (no. 624). The theme of the "public" vs. the "private" in funerals, as illustrated by the traditions pertaining to al-Tabari and Ibn Sam'fin (as well as by some of the other accounts considered in this paper), is a potentially fruitful line of inquiry which I hope to explore in a separate study. (I am grateful to Prof. Michael Cook for suggesting the idea for such a study to me.) (138) Al-Tabari. Ta'rikh. III. 1112-14: translation as in The History of al-Tabari, XXXII, tr. C. E. Bos- worth (Albany: State University of New York Press, 1987), 200-02 (with some modifications). 52</page><page sequence="27">DEATH, FUNERAL PROCESSIONS little more than to assert their own leadership over the populace. But howe- ver the meaning and significance of the popular support might be interpre- ted, even al-Ma' min did not deny the fact such popular support was enjoyed (or being targeted) by his opponents. Some of this popular interest was evident at the large crowds certain scholars were able to attract. The figures which are sometimes quoted for such crowds are, again, wildly exaggerated (139) but it is scarcely implausible that the scholarly stature of a particular individual who was, say, visiting Baghdad, or his eloquence, or his patronage might have attracted conside- rable audiences. About one al-Hayyaj b. Bist~m (d. 177/793-4), visiting from Herat in Central Asia, it was said that "there did not gather around anyone in Baghdad [numbers] that gathered around him." It is noteworthy that he was not only remembered for his eloquence, but also for his patro- nage: no one could hear hadith from him without also being made to eat with him! Reports about al-Hayyaj's popularity become somewhat more credible when it is noted that prominent scholars such as Yahya b. Ma'in had a poor opinion of his hadith, and he was not alone among the ashab al-hadith in a caustic attitude towards him. ('") In other words, such reports about him could not have originated among the ashab al-hadith of Baghdad. We do not know anything about al-Hayyaj's funeral (he did not die in Baghdad), but the point is that if large crowds could attend upon a scholar in his life it is likely that they would also want to attend upon him in death. The same might be said of certain other hadith scholars who are also reported to have had large audiences in their sessions. (14') For the various reasons surveyed above, there seems nothing implausible, then, in a number of prominent scholars and ascetics having had very large and memorable funerals in the second and third centuries of Islam. Indeed, the funerals of prominent ashab al-hadith of Baghdad may be taken as hitherto unnoticed evidence for the popular appeal of this trend from the late second century onward. Conversely, it is likely that such funerals (and not just the later reports or traditions about them) may have been mobilized in the first place to demonstrate the social standing of this trend and to intimi- date the opponents (though more conventional ways of intimidating the opponents were used as well). Even if the words attributed to Ibn Hanbal about funerals being a mark of differentiation between "us" and "them" are of a later provenance, the sentiment they express may very well be genuine. (139) Cf. G. H. A. Juynboll, Muslim Tradition (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1983), 6.

(no. 5185). 53</page><page sequence="28">MUHAMMAD QASIM ZAMAN The rhetoric of funerals: aspects of ambivalence? The large funerals of certain scholars and holy men may be thought to have served, then, as a mark of their religious authority and, indeed, of the rectitude of the doctrines they represented. The actual or recommended boy- cott of particular funerals (or of the funerals of those associated with certain theological tendencies) equally underscored not just the heretical views of the deceased, but also - once again - the authority of the scholar advocating or exemplifying such a boycott. Yet the evidence of funerals, and more broadly, the rhetoric of popular support, seems to have inspired mixed fee- lings among certain scholars. Sufyan al-Thawri is said to have remarked, though apparently not with specific reference to funerals, that "when all the neighbours of a person praise him, he is surely an evil man." People asked how that was, whereupon Sufyan responded that "he sees them acting in sin [ya'malfn bi'l-ma'asi) but he does not [do anything to] change that and meets them with a cheerful countenance." (142) To Sufyan is also attributed the more specific admonition that "when a deceased person is mentioned, do not look to the opinion of the common people (qawl al-'amma), but rather look to the view of the people of knowledge and reason (ahl al-'ilm wa'l- 'aql)." (143") Such remarks may well be directed at instances of local, popular support for the religious trends of which scholars like Sufyan disapproved. For instance, as Madelung has shown, Murji'ism had begun to enjoy wides- pread support in eastern Khurasan not long after the time of Abfi Hanifa, who was himself associated with it ('"); Sufyan, for his part, was virulently opposed to both Abfu Hanifa and the Murji'a. Statements such as the fore- going may then represent an effort to temper the view that the support of large numbers necessarily implied moral rectitude, or that that alone did so. It is also possible that, by the time of Ahmad b. Hanbal, two generations after Sufyan, and in Ibn Hanbal's Baghdad rather than in Sufyan's Kifa (where, moreover, Shi'i trends continued to be important in their various forms), the ashab al-hadith could rely on the argument from vast numbers much more comfortably than one might have been able to in Sufyin's day and age. (145) (142) Abfu Nu'aym, Hilya, VII, 32 (para, 9461). (143) Ibid., VII, 28 (para 9436). Also cf. al-San'ani, al-Musannaf.

(145) A rather remarkable attitude of hostility towards the common people is also attributed to Sufyan's older contemporary, the Kfifan hadith scholar al-A'mash (d. 148/765): Sa'id b. Yahyd Abui Sufyan al- Hadhdha' said: "al-A'mash took up [residence in] one part of the Sawad, so the people from there came to him and asked him to narrate [traditions] to them. But he refused. One of his companions said: 'O Abu Muhammad, why didn't you narrate [traditions] to these poor folk masakin)? al-A'mash replied: 'Who would adorn swine with pearls!- (Abi Nu'aym, Hilya.

It was these named scholars who were the repositories of true guidance, and it was their followers who comprised the righteous "com- munity": Ish.q b. Rahawayh ('") said: "A man asked ['Abdallh] Ibn al-Mub~rak, 'O Abu 'Abd al-Rahm~n, what/who is al-sawad al-a'zam?' [Ibn al-Mub~rak] responded: 'It is Abu Hamza al-Sakfini.' Ishaq then said, 'As for that time, it was Abi Hamza; and in our own time, it is Muhammad b. Aslam and those who follow him.' Ishaq then added: 'If you asked the ignorant ones what/who is al- sawad al-a'zam, they would say, "the community of the people (jama'at al- nas)." What they do not know is that the "community" is [comprised of] the scholar who adheres to the tradition (athar) of the Prophet and his path; he who follows him [scil. such a scholar] is [in] the community, and he who opposes him in such adherence has abandoned the community.' ("47) Read in the context of funerals, we are to take it, presumably, that one's opi- nion of the deceased ought to be guided by what an "orthodox" scholar thought of him, not by the number of people who showed up at his funeral. ('~) If this is a fair reading of this tradition, then the position it represents stands in mar- ked tension with the view, cited earlier, that the people (read: common people) are the witnesses of God on earth, so that if they have good things to say of the deceased then God's judgement on him follows suit. On this view, the attitude of a prominent scholar, his presence or absence at funerals, did not matter as long as there were some people who would stand by the dead person. "When a Muslim dies and four people from the neighbouring households nearest to him testify that they do not know anything but good of him, God [responds by] (146) On Ishiq b.

He was assiduous in upholding the sunna, exerting himself to act in accordance with it, and renouncing the world entirely. He would delibera- tely preach without having recourse to his knowledge, and he would bear witness [to the truth?] without [having to] articulate it." Despite a certain disdain for intellectual matters that this statement seems to imply. he is said to have been the author of a "Radd 'ala'l-Jahmiyya" (see Hilya, IX, 256 [para 13803], 257 [para 13804]. 258 [para 13805]), though this work or its author is not mentioned in Ibn al-Nadim, al-Fihrist (ed. R. Tajaddud [Beirut: Ddr al-masira, 1988]) nor, for that matter, in GAS; on him, also cf. van Ess, TG, II, 609. (148) Even with a number of people showing up, there seems to have been some effort to define just whose testimony mattered: consider a tradition which agrees that "forty men" can intercede with God for the deceased, but specifies that the men in question are those "who do not associate anyone with AllIh (lyush- rikiin bi'll.h shay'an)." Ibn Hanbal, al-Musnad, ed. Muhammad Shakir (Cairo: Dir al-ma'Arif, 1949-58), IV, 174 (no. 2509). This tradition (whose isnid indicates its origins in Medina: "Abdallah b. Wahb - Ab(i Sakhr Humayd b. Ziyad b. Abi'l-Mukhariq al-Madani - Sharik b. 'Abdallah b. Abi Namir - Kurayb, the mawliof Ibn 'AbbAs - 'Abdallb b. 'Abbas - the Prophet) would exclude the non-Muslims; but might it also be used against those "Muslims" whose beliefs could be accused of veering too close to shirk? 55</page><page sequence="30">MUHAMMAD QASIM ZAMAN saying: 'I have accepted what you know in regard to him, and forgiven him for what you do not know [of his actions].'" (149) It is tempting to consider this "populist" position as a response to disa- greements within the ranks of the ashab al-hadith. While the ashab al-hadith might, with relish, boycott the funeral of a notorious qadari or a proselyti- sing Murji'ite, troubling questions could arise when disagreements in their own circles came to the surface, at funerals as on other occasions. ("0) Such conflicts were especially in evidence during and after the Mihna, for ins- tance, when some of the most prominent scholars of hadith did, in fact, come to acknowledge the caliphal position on the createdness of the Qur'an. As noted earlier, Ibn Hanbal, who himself had remained steadfast during the Mihna, did not transmit hadith on the authority of those who had failed the test. It was apparently for the same reason that he did not participate in the funeral of his erstwhile colleague, the ascetic and traditionist Abu Nasr al- Tammdr (d. 228/842). ('5') Yet some were clearly troubled by this boycott, for, as a fellow scholar, Abu Nasr's memory may have been too precious for many among the ashdb al-hadith to be easily damned by Ibn Hanbal's atti- tude towards him. This tension is reflected in traditions which have the asce- tic Bishr b. al-Hdrith appear in a dream to someone after Bishr, Abi Nasr, and Ibn Hanbal had all died, to report that Abfi Nasr's station in the other world was actually higher than Ibn Hanbal's as well as Bishr's own. (52) But this would probably be too narrow a view of the emergence of what I have called the "populist" position, viz., the idea that it is the (common) peo- ple's views of the deceased which really matter in indicating his salvation. More importantly, this position also accords well with the nascent worldview of the ashab al-hadith - which itself recognized popular support as a sign of rectitude - much more so than do the aforementioned remarks attributed to (149) Ibn Balaban, al-lhshn, V, 12 (no. 3015). The isnid of this report is as follows: AbuYa'la - Ahmad b. 'Umar al-Waki'i - Mu'ammal b. Ism'll - Hammid b. Salama - Thabit - Anas b. Mdlik - the Prophet. Like many other traditions on this theme, the early part of this isnad (up to and including Mu'ammal) is solidly Basran. (On Mu'ammal [d. 206/822], see Ibn Hajar, Tahdhib, X. 380f. [no. 682].) Ahmad b.'Umar al-Waki'i (d. 235/849-50), the next link in the chain was, however, a Kfifan who had settled in Baghdid and went on to serve as a mazdlim judge in Marw, Khurasan, for twelve years. On him, see TB, V, 40f. (no. 2354). That this tradition is to be seen as a pointed response to Sufydn's view, cited earlier ("when all the neighbours of a man praise him, he is surely an evil man") rather than the other way round, is suggested by the fact that a Prophetical tradition with an impressive isnad is deployed in rebuttal, whereas Sufyin's statement goes no further than, and carries only the authority of, his own name. (150) Note, for example, the sharp response of Yahyd b. Ma'in (d. 233/848) when told that some people preferred 'Abd al-Rahmdin b. Mahdi (d. 198/813), a noted Basran scholar of hadith, over the well-respected Kiifan scholar, Waki' b. al-Jarrah (d. 197/812): "May the curse of God, the angels, and of all humans be on he who gives precedence to 'Abd al-Rahman over Waki' !" On the sometimes sharp disagreements within and between the inhabitants of different Islamic cities on those who were to be regarded as their preeminent reli- gious authorities, see al-Shifi'i, "Kitdb jimd" al-'ilm,&gt;&gt; in al-Umm, VII, 294f. (151) TB, X, 420 (no. 5578). On Abai Nasr during the Mihna, cf. al-Tabari, Ta'rikh, III, 1121, 1128, 1132. Like Ibn Hanbal, Abai Nasr too was one of the abna' (~B, X, 420). (152) TB, X, 421. Bishr went on to explain that Abia Nasr's position was higher than either his own or even Ibn Hanbal's because of his having willingly lived in poverty (faNr) and as a recompense for his patience on the death of his sons. 56</page><page sequence="31">DEATH, FUNERAL PROCESSIONS Sufyan al-Thawri. This position should also be seen in relation to the emer- ging juristic notion that the agreement of the community is an indication of divine approval. The Hanafi jurist al-Shaybdni (d. 189/805) (53) attributes to the Prophet the view that "everything of which the Muslims approve or disap- prove is good or bad in the sight of Allah," ('") an idea which, in various for- mulations, was to become a major characteristic of Sunni juristic thought. The "populist" view on funerals is different from the evolving Sunni doctrine of consensus (ijm?'), of course, in that that consensus refers, for al-Shafi'i (d. 204/820), at least, to the entire community; and in the "classical" juristic for- mulations (as well as in many pre-Shifi'i ones), it refers to the agreement of the scholars. (155) The traditions on participation in funerals stipulate, for their part, the efficacy of even a few people's - and not necessarily scholars' - good opinion. Despite this obvious difference, however, the "populist" stance on funerals still seems to rest on the significance of a local "consensus" as regards the deceased, and, in that sense, is likely to be a product of the same milieu as that in which the authority of ijma' was crystallizing. ('") The "populist" stance is also the favored one in major early collections of Sunni hadith on the subject of funerals. Traditions to this effect are note- worthy for featuring important figures from the ranks of the ashdb al-hadith in their isndds. ('57) Yet, as indicated earlier, this position continued to be characterised by a certain degree of ambiguity. While the good things people said about the deceased, and the fact that the funeral was a large and impres- (153) On him, see GAS. I, 421-33.

(156) The juristic interest of this "populist" position is evident in other ways as well. Thus, al-Bukhdri cites versions of the hadith on people being the witnesses of God not only in his &lt;Book of Funerals,, but also in the "Book of Witnesses," where these traditions are adduced to answer the question of how many wit- nesses ought to suffice in attesting to a person's good character (Al-Bukhiri. Sahih. II, 148f. [kitib al- shahadit 6]). For what it is worth, it may also be noted that at least some of the individuals who feature in various traditions which present people as the witnesses of God on earth were actively involved in the judi- cial administration: the Basran traditionist 'Affan b. Muslim al-Saffar, for instance, was in charge of inves- tigating the credentials of witnesses for the Basran judge Mu'&amp;dh b. Mu'adh (d. 196/812), (TB, XII, 265 [no. 6715]). 'All b. Mushir, who narrated a tradition about the significance of people's testimony at funerals, was al-Mahdi's judge in Mawsil (Ibn Abi Shayba. al-Musannaf, III, 368. On this judge, see Muhammad b. Kha- laf Waki' [d. 306/918], Akhb.r al-qud.t, ed. 'Abd al-'Aziz Mustafi al-Mardghi [Cairo, 1947-1950], III, 219f.); and Ahmad b. 'Umar al-Waki'i (d. 235/849-50), who transmitted the foregoing tradition about God forgiving a person's sins if his neighbours testified to his goodness, was himself a judge of a mazAlim court in Khurisan for twelve years. (157) For example: 'Affan b. Muslim al-SaffAr (cf. Ibn Abi Shayba, al-Musannaf. III, 368; also cf. the preceding note); Hushaym b. Bashir (Ibn Abi Shayba, al-Musannaf.

The status of the funeral prayer as fard kifdya allowed one to sit back, of course, as long as there were others at hand to participate; but an influential scho- lar' s boycott was not merely a matter of sitting back. It was also a potentially memorable occasion to define the locus of religious authority, to distinguish between "us" and "them." The view is attributed to Ibn Hanbal that "the imam should not pray over one who has committed suicide, nor over an extremist (gh lin), but the people (al-nas) are to pray over him." (158) The "imam" refers here primarily to the political authority, but this term was also used for leading religious scholars of the late second/eighth and third/ninth centuries, including Ibn Hanbal himself. (159) If, for all its attractions, the "populist" position could lend itself to ambiguity - with the people perhaps turning out in large numbers at the funeral of the wrong man, or with not enough showing up to mark the death of every "orthodox" scholar - it was for the scholar as "imam" or exemplar to continue to clarify the religious landscape on this occasion. And to do so not only helped differentiate "orthodox" beliefs from the wayward; it would have served equally to dis- tinguish the religious elite from the often unpredictable masses. Much, then, was at stake on the day of the funeral. Muhammad Qasim Zaman Brown University (158) Ibn Shihin (d. 385/995), Nasikh al-hadith wa mansfikhuh, ed. Samir b.
