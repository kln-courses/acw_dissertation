<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE STRUCTURE OF THESE YEARS AUGUST KADOW To Whitman on the sands of Paumanok the sea spoke death, and he a windswept child found that word good. But the perpetual knock of moons and hours upon this end of wild recumbent earth brings to my ears no mild and sleeping messages of peace, no clean aesthetic way to look upon this scene. For what can deep sea say to one who lolls upon commercial grains of Florida sand surrounded by hotels and white-washed walls and bathing beauties of the promised land ? We need a god to take us by the hand, one who can speak to us of where we are in these dilemma years of after war. No god accompanies us this tropic night except perhaps the sea circling near earth. Anthropomorphic, gods have died of fright in wine excesses that gave science birth. And who can now evaluate our worth, declaim an economics of the soul before the sea accepts us as its toll ? Technology has wandered out of bounds and left the human heart stranded, alone. We have no art but disc-recorded sounds, no god but now and then a safety zone when traffic is too jammed, or bullets moan. Nor have we time for cures unless they be swift panaceas given without fee. Too many wastelands of the heart led our souls down from war to war to future war: the hour of birth occurs and is this hour when after battle we look up and far and seek to hang our compass on some star. This is the door god-opened or by fate which we must take or burn within our hate. 144</page><page sequence="2">THE STRUCTURE OF THESE YEARS The question here presented by the years is but the antique question of belief, of what to think after we waste our tears, of what to do after we drink our grief. How shall we answer it? With what new sheaf of words will we fill now the crowded air not emptied yet of mottoes from the war ? Not with a sheaf, but with a single word as small and pleasant to the ears as rain, one many-sided and too often heard, a sound we laugh, a thing we call inane. How else but with the love that lies like grain in fields wind-trampled and by war despoiled shall we rebuild the years for which we toiled ? This is the sound the sea casts as its part, a word more ancient than all history: the only hope lies unused in the heart, to build from there towards some new mastery. The god lies dead: our century's mystery: lies in the heart, and silently above . . . the engraved prescription, the potential love. 145</page></plain_text>
