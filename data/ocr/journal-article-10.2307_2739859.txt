<plain_text><page sequence="1">Method of Studying Ethnological Art by Herta Haselberger INTRODUCTION THE TERM "ETHNOLOGICAL ART" "ETHNOLOGICAL ART" is used here to denote the tribal and tourist art of those peoples in Africa, America, Asia, Australia, and Oceania who are the objects of ethno- logical (or, as it is called in the Anglo-American tradi- tion, anthropological) study. As such, it corresponds to the area of art that has often and unsatisfactorily been termed primitive, tribal, traditional, native, indige- nous, folk, or popular. None of these terms, as Gerbrands (1957: 9-24) has shown, withstands thorough criticism. The term "primitive art" encounters serious objec- tion: Gerbrands points out that the art forms of ethno- logical peoples are not particularly crude or early, i.e., are not "primitive"; while Tax and Mednick (1960) have recently emphasized that the symbolic meaning of "primitive" may lead to considerable misunderstand- ing. Kunst der Naturv8lker, frequently used in German literature, is not a suitable appellation for ethnological art, because "the contrasting of 'Naturvolker' and 'Kulturvolker' is completely at variance with modern HERTA HASELBERGER is Dozent of Art History in the department of architecture at the Vienna Technische Hochschule, which has university standing. Born in 1927, she was educated at Vienna University (Dr. Phil. 1951) and later worked as scientific assistant at the Vienna University and the Vienna Technische Hochschule, where she received, in 1960, the venia legendi. HASELBERGER began her research with studies of African art. In 1956 and 1960 she did field work on mural painting in West Africa. She is currently engaged in a study of tribal architec- ture in several West African areas. The present article, submitted to CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY on May 2, 1960, was sent for CA* treatment to 49 scholars, of whom the following responded with written comments: Ralph C. Altman, Emmanuel Anati, Gilbert Archey, Guy Atkins, T. Barrow, Beatrice Blackwood, Ingeborg Bolz, Edmund Carpen- ter, Adr. G. Claerhout, Bernard Fagg, William Fagg, William N. Fenton, Douglas F. Fraser, Robert Bruce Inverarity, Arne Martin Klausen, George Kubler, Henri Lavachery, Phillip Lewis, Andreas Lommel, C. Nooteboom, Fokke Sierksma, P. Jan Vandenhoute, James Walton, Gene Weltfish, Anthony Whitty, and Frank Willett. The comments written for publica- tion are printed in full after the author's text and are followed by a reply from the author, who also discusses in the footnotes several points raised by commentators. ideas to the significance of the term culture" (Ger- brands 1957: 17). Such terms as "tribal," "traditional," "native," and "indigenous" art, according to Gerbrands (1957: 18- 19), are too strongly associated with the concept of backwardness. It may also be noted that these terms do not comprehend the whole of ethnological artistic activity, since they exclude tourist art, which sometimes has aesthetic importance (Fagg, Forman, and Forman 1959). The terms "folk" or "popular" art, proposed in 1949 by a committee meeting in Paris under the sponsor- ship of UNESCO (Gerbrands 1957: 21), are unsuitable because they are generally used for "everything not be- longing to high art or higher applied arts" (Hahm 1932: 15); and many ethnological peoples lack strongly marked social strata and consequently have no "folk" art. Only in exceptional cases-e.g. Benin (Elisofon and Fagg 1958: 64) or Hawaii (Christensen 1955: 282)-is it possible to distinguish a "plebeian" and a "patrician" style among ethnological peoples. It is obvious that "ethnological- art," which is used throughout this article, is the only term that exactly fits the area of art under discussion. Yet the definition it offers is essentially negative: it comprehends all art objects that do not belong to cultures usually included in studies of art historians; and is, therefore, no more than a working term. Perhaps the fruitlessness of all attempts to formulate an accurate and generally accepted term that compre- hends this field of art is explained by the fact that there simply are no stylistic characteristics limited exclu- sively to it (Gerbrands 1957: 138). The art of ethno- logical peoples differs from other art only in degree; and the difference is not sufficient for designating the former by a single distinct term that is both accurate and definitive. However, the fine arts of all ethnological peoples share enough common features so that they can be studied by the same methods and with the same principles. Therefore the working term, "ethnological art," strictly defined and not weighted with any sym- bolic meaning, cannot be avoided. Within a few years, more adequate historical and ethnological knowledge will give us a better under- Vol. 2 -No. 4* October 1961 341</page><page sequence="2">standing of these art areas, and the differences among ethnological styles will become more significant than their common features. The present classification of very different art styles under the rubric of "ethnolog- ical art" will then be replaced by a more appropriate stylistic classification, and we may give up this term. THE SCOPE OF ETHNOLOGICAL ART The term "art" is used here only for the so-called fine arts, namely: architecture (including space-configura- tions and organization of mass, planning of roads and squares, and, in the higher cultures, town-planning); painting and drawing; sculpture; arts and crafts (dis- tinguished from the "great" arts by their more utili- tarian purpose and more decorative intent, and ap- proaching the non-artistic spheres of culture). The transitions between these are fleeting. But which ethnological objects are art objects? Is a wind screen of the Pygmies, for instance, a work of architecture? All of our experience indicates that a strict line cannot be drawn between the artistic and non-artistic; with each doubtful object, the determina- tion of whether or not it is a work of art must be newly undertaken. Differences of opinion about the boundaries of art, and even the meaning of the term, have given rise to many controversies, summarized by Munro (1951) and Gerbrands (1957: 3-8). The Evolutionists regarded as preliminary forms of art all objects and buildings whose counterparts in the high cultures are considered art. Since the Evolutionists took 19th-century natural- ism as the culmination of art, they were forced to inter- pret works of art from all historic periods in terms of a theory allowing them to demonstrate a development of art from stylization to naturalism. The existence of this trend, however, was questioned by Pitt-Rivers as early as 1875, and the theory died after the discovery of the realistic cave paintings of the Late Paleolithic. Evolu- tionism can contribute little to such questions as the boundaries of art. The "Culture-historical Vienna School" of ethnology, which connects a priori an artis- tic faculty with the concept of mankind, is similarly unable to provide an answer. This problem can be solved only with the help of aesthetics, which holds that a work of art involves an artistic-aesthetic intention. If the Pygmy erects a wind screen for the exclusively practical purpose of protect- ing himself from wind and rain, he does not create a work of art; but if a Melanesian carves a paddle and strives to give it a beautiful form, then, even without ornamental decoration, the paddle may be treated as an art object because of this aesthetic intention. Then is it art when someone playfully draws lines in the sand, or scratches them on rocks? Not if playful activity is his main object. Art is involved only when the action produces results designed to affect someone, and is not, like play, an end in itself. Works of art are therefore distinguished from purely utilitarian objects by the aesthetic intention, and from play by the striving for effect. PRE~VIOUS RESEARCH Interest in the history of art developed in Europe during the Renaissance, when intense cultural rivalry among the Italian cities stimulated recording of the lives of noted artists, while pride in the past directed attention to the fine arts of ancient Rome. The study of art, however, remained unsystematic until the 18th cen- tury, when the work of Johann Joachim Winckelmann (1717-1768), a classicist who considered the histori- cal and cultural background of art important, intro- duced a scientific orientation and initiated the develop- ment of a science of art. With rediscovery of medieval artistic values when classicism was succeeded by the romantic movement at the beginning of the 19th cen- tury, scientific investigation was extended to Gothic art. Later, other styles of European art-Baroque, Roman- esque, and manneristic-gained appreciation and be- came objects of study. Systematic investigations were also made of Egyptian, Oriental, and Indian art, and this expansion of interest in the art of the non-European civilizations was accompanied by growing appreciation of ethnological art. Although specimens of ethnological art had been in- cluded in European collections as early as the 15th cen- tury (Fagg and Forman 1959; Maesen 1958), they were valued only as curiosities or exotic objects, rather than for aesthetic reasons. But this attitude began to change during the first half of the 19th century. As early as 1842, Franz Kugler's Handbuch der Kunstgeschichte included descriptions of ethnological art from Oceania and North America. After 1890, both ethnologists and art critics gave increased attention to the fine arts (par- ticularly the ornamental art) of what were then called "primitives." The material collected by K. Woermann and published in his Geschichte der Kunst aller Zeiten und Vdlker (1904) was astonishingly rich. About 1904, the enthusiasm of artists and art critics in Paris, Brus- sels, and Dresden stimulated a wide interest in ethno- logical sculpture (Fraser 1957, Goldwater 1938), which became much sought after. Books and papers dealing with ethnological art were published under the patron- age of the colonial powers; ethnological museums ar- ranged their art collections to separate different stylistic areas, and published serious scientific studies of the art of ethnological peoples. Today not only museums and collections, but also a number of University Institutes, such as the Instituut voor Kunstgeschiedenis en Oud- heidskunde at Ghent University, Belgium, are devoted to research on the art of ethnological peoples. The efforts to enlarge our knowledge of ethnological art are described by Gerbrands (1957) and Herrmann (Herrmann and Germann 1958: 3-29); other funda- mental bibliographical references are Christensen (1955: 367-76), Douglas and d'Harnoncourt (1941: 211-18), Elisofon and Fagg (1958: 252-54), Harding and Bolling (1938), Lem (1948: 33-38), Linton et al. (1946: 196-99), McCarthy (1958: 67-68), Segy (1952: 231-36), and Wingert (1953: 46). These can be sup- plemented by bibliographical notes accompanying the chapters on tribal arts of Africa, America, Asia, and Australia in the first three volumes of the Enciclopedia Universale Dell'Arte (1957-59). PRESENT INADEQUACIES In what situation does the study of ethnological art find itself today? An inspection of publications dealing with the art of ethnological peoples shows that, except 342 CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY</page><page sequence="3">for the special attention given Africa, art investigation -depending, of course, on ethnographical knowledge -tends to be equally advanced in all accessible parts of the world; but that the branches of art-architecture, sculpture, painting, and arts and crafts-are treated very upevenly. Research on architecture, with a few exceptions (Be- guin et al. 1952; Engestrom 1957; Gltick 1956; Phillips 1952, 1955), has been confined to ethnological, ecov nomic, or sociological problems. Almost no attention has been given to the artistic formation principles of houses and villages. The decoration of buildings, par- ticularly the carvings on Maori houses and food stores, is the only aspect of architecture with which art investi- gators among ethnological peoples have frequently dealt. The disproportionately large space given to sculpture by many authors can be attributed to the abundance of ethnological sculpture in European and American mu- seums, on whose collections many publications on eth- nological art exclusively depend. While much attention has been given to sculpture in wood, stone, and metal, sculpture in mud and clay, sometimes of high artistic quality, but fragile and seldom brought to museums, has remained almost unnoticed. The study of ethnological painting has particularly lagged. Only rock paintings and engravings, which at- tracted attention because they resemble prehistoric rock pictures, are relatively well known. The other types of painting have been neglected. Almost no research is being done on the aesthetic principles of tattooing and body painting. The bark, mud, or wood murals of eth- nological peoples in Africa (Cory 1953; Haselberger 1957; Redinha 1953), Australia, central India (Elwin 1951), North America, and Oceania have seldom been investigated, and are rather undervalued. Drawings and paintings in sand, the most famous of which are made by the Navaho Indians of the U.S.A.,' await systematic investigation, as do the painted decorations of cult and ceremonial objects as well as those of utilitarian nature. The most urgent need is systematic field study on a large scale. The whole of the art-production of all eth- nological peoples should be collected and described systematically; and all native traditions about art and artists should be recorded. Such field investigations will provide the foundation for further scientific research on ethnological art. MAJOR PROBLEMS FOR INVESTIGATION The study of ethnological art involves four primary tasks: (1) Detailed systematic study of individual art objects. Such a study should describe the genesis and structure of the object, establish its spatial and temporal classification, and analyze its place within the whole culture. (2) The artist's biography. The biography should include a chronological account of all important events in the artist's, life. It should also trace the development of his style and characterize his creative ability. An account of the influence exerted by his work is also desirable. (3) Study of art in the whole structure of the culture. Which objects are considered works of art by ethnological Haselberger: METHOD OF STUDYING ETHNOLOGICAL ART peoples? What is the role and influence of art and artist out- side the high cultures? How are art, economy, social organiza- tion, and intellectual life interrelated? (4) The history of art. Even if his work concerns ethno- logical cultures, the investigator of art eventually moves into problems of time and space. He establishes dates (at least relatively) for art objects, and assigns them to a particular locality; he traces related complexes, and describes their causal and dynamic interrelations. Further, he sifts out the pioneering, historically significant artists and works of art, and seeks to identify periods and specific trends through time. All four problems are equally important and should be carried on simultaneously; one can never make a detailed study of a work of art without determining its place in the total structure of the culture as well as in historical style-sequences. Similarly, one cannot investi- gate the place of art in a whole culture without the sci- entific foundation provided by studies of art objects and biographies of artists. Conversely, one cannot work within the historical dimension of non-literate time, nor re-create the history of art during such a period, without first having dealt in detail with its works of art. THE NEED FOR A COMBINED APPROACH For the first few decades of this century, the study of ethnological art was primarily limited to ethnologists. Recently, however, art historians have again recognized that a world-wide history of art can not neglect ethno- logical art, while ethnologists have become aware that the art traditions of the peoples with whom they deal require aesthetic as well as ethnological investigation. For the fruitful and effective development of the study of ethnological art, both field study and theoreti- cal research must be based on proper methods, adapting the concepts of European art history and ethnology to the needs of this new science. We still lack the criteria that would facilitate the recognition of standards of ar- tistic quality among ethnological peoples and help us achieve a stylistic classification of all art objects. The concepts of European art history are insufficient for this purpose; but ethnological concepts do not suffice for the comprehension of specific artistic values. A satisfactory understanding of the world of imagery of ethnological peoples can be obtained only with the methodological tools of both disciplines. To meet this need, new con- ceptual tools must be forged. This article, therefore, is designed to broaden the range of vision of ethnologists and art historians, so that they understand each other's methods and thus arrive at a new method. An attempt will be made in the fol- lowing sections to describe a method of art study among ethnological peoples that is based on our present knowl- edge of art history and ethnology. METHODS OF FIELD RESEARCH Gerbrands (1957: 66) notes: It is really only in Africa that art in itself has been the subject of fieldwork, if we except Himmelheber's work among the Eskimo (1938), that of Fenton among the Iroquois (1941), and the research of the Berndts in North East Australia (Elkin and Berndt 1950), and I may add, that of Adair (1945) among the Navaho, 1 Sierksma* (p. 373) cites, as examples of the scientific study of Navaho sand-painting, two works by Gladys Reichard. Vol. 2 * No. 4 - October 1961 343</page><page sequence="4">Kaudern (1944) in central Celebes, and Mountford (1956) in Arnhem Land. Much work, therefore, awaits the art-investigator in the field. Particularly in New Guinea, but also in central India, Indochina, western and northern Australia, South America, Africa, Indo- nesia, Oceania, and even in North America, "tra- ditional" art may be studied within tribal cultures at the present day. Apart from this, a new "tourist" art, whose world-wide formation and development is one of the most interesting phenomena in the art-life of ethnological peoples today, is cultivated within a num- ber of traditional tribal cultures, and should not be neglected by the art investigator. The main tasks of art research in the field are: (1) col- lection; (2) description; (3) inquiry; (4) observation. COLLECTION It would, of course, be desirable to leave art objects in their cultural environment; but well-cared-for collec- tions now seem to offer the only hope for their preserva- tion. Throughout the world traditional art objects are now threatened with destruction: ethnological peoples today seldom have the means or desire to preserve the art of their past; and the transition to Western civiliza- tion often promotes conditions hostile to traditional arts. During a trip to Guinea in 1956, for instance, I was repeatedly told that the abstract murals painted by the women, based on traditions that can be traced back to the neolithic Mediterranean cultures, were "old fash- ioned," and that the practice was being abandoned. The art investigator acquiring a piece of art should immediately record the information needed for its later scientific evaluation: (1) He should fix the place where he obtained the object by marking it on a map, and adding a rough sketch, a photo- graph, and an exact description of the location. (2) He should also record the date and time he found the object. (3) A brief description of the object, including its size, material, execution, artistic form, and state of preservation should be given. (4) Finally, the investigator should make an inquiry among the onlookers, concerning the meaning, use, origin, and age of the art object, and seeking information about the owner and the artist. With these statements, his records should include an evaluation of the authenticity and credibility of the informants. However, one should not be too skeptical, as shown by my own experience in Guinea. Asking who pro- duced the well-known wall decorations on Fulani houses in the Fouta mountains, I obtained no less than three contra- dictory answers. Later I succeeded in showing that changing customs accounted for the contradictions. Formerly, such decorations were made only by women belonging to the Negro population in the area; but in the last decades Fulani women-and today, talented men as well-have learned this once-despised art from the peasants. DESCRIPTION If a work of art is not portable (e.g. a building), or if its acquisition is not possible, it should be made accessi- ble for scientific study by exact description-photo- graphs, drawings, and replicas in easily handled mate- rial. Photographs and drawings should show the object as it ordinarily appears; other aspects may be more effective artistically, but are without scientific value because they show qualities that in reality do not lie within the object. The best solution of this problem would be a series of photographs showing the object in several different positions; excellent reproductions of this kind appear in the book The-Sculpture of Africa (Elisofon and Fagg 1958: 80-81). For the exact investi- gation of buildings, orthogonal plans, reduced models, and position-sketches are indispensible. Excellent ex- amples of architectural drawings are presented by the French architect Beguin and his colleagues in their book, L'Habitat au Cameroun. Only when based on such drawings will the comparative study of ethnologi- cal architecture be successful. Knowledge of architec- tural drawing is therefore indispensible for all those who want to deal with the architecture of ethnological peoples. The investigator who examines an art object for sci- entific purposes has to fulfill on the spot the same tasks prescribed above for the art collector. INQUIRY There are two methods of inquiry: (1) general in- quiry, in which one questions a series of informants about their relations to art; and (2) individual inquiry, in which a single person is asked about his personal rela- tions to art. To obtain results of scientific value, data gathered by general inquiry should be compared with information obtained by the method of individual in- quiry. GENERAL INQUIRY Art is always the concern of a community, the expres- sion of its collective inner-life. This is why general inquiry is scientifically valid. The best results will be obtained from a range of competent authorities in dif- ferent social positions, who are shown art objects and asked about the artistic value of these as well as the asso- ciations connected with them. Continuing the inquiry, the informants are asked whether they own works of art, how and why these were acquired, and whether they are preserved and cared for. Further questions should bring out the social and cultural roles assigned by the informants to art and artists. Such inquiries have been conducted by Cordwell (1952), Maesen (1946), and Vandenhoute (1945). INDIVIDUAL INQUIRY The knowledge provided by this method of inquiry is deeper and more profound, but its value is necessarily individual rather than general. The most important informant is the artist himself, who should be asked about his choice of artistic profession (e.g. whether hereditary or freely made); the aim of his artistic work (e.g. economic profit); professional organizations (guilds, corporations); patrons; selection of materials and tools for his work; execution of art objects; pay- ment; religious ceremonies accompanying his work; and his own ceremonial, social, and economic position. The great importance of such investigations for the study of art is best shown by the successful field work of Cordwell (1952), Himmelheber (1935, 1938, 1939, 1959), and Vandenhoute (1945). OBSERVATION The investigator should analyze the attitude of a group or of a competent individual (e.g. an artist) to- 344 CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY</page><page sequence="5">ward art objects. He describes the artist at work, and the tools he uses, as Vandenhoute (1945) has done so thoroughly. My own experience in Guinea suggests that ethnological peoples are proud of their artistic abilities and enjoy demonstrating techniques of painting and carving to an interested person. I am thoroughly aware of the difficulties that an eth- nographer working in the field will meet in fulfilling the tasks set forth above. Not only do his time and money run short all too soon, but often he lacks the indispensible knowledge of local languages. Therefore, if we are to salvage at least an important part of the traditions concerned with fine arts, during the brief time remaining before the complete ruin of tribal cul- tures, it is desirable for not only the art investigator, but every ethnologist engaged in field study, to know what data are of importance for art-science. DETAILED STUDY OF A WORK OF ART One should first carefully examine the art object, establishing its authenticity, identifying later modifica- tions, and, if necessary, reconstructing its original effect. Next, its date and place of origin should be determined. In the absence of traditional or documentary evidence for the position of an object in time and space, it is always preferable to give priority to determining the locality where it was produced; among non-literate peo- ples, period styles remain very constant and are harder to identify than local or regional styles. In fact, a great deal of ethnological art can be fixed only in space, and not in time. For instance, an investigator can easily tell whether a wooden sculpture from the Congo area was made by a Bushongo, Bapende, or Bena Lulua carver; but only if it is a portrait of a Bushongo king is he likely to determine its date.2 In Europe, on the other hand, the period style is generally more significant than the local style. Thus an educated, but not professionally learned, person can, without much difficulty, tell whether a statue of a Madonna is of Romanesque, Gothic, or Baroque style; but from its style alone he will not be able to name its area of origin. Knowledge of the place where an art object was ac- quired or photographed makes it easier to determine the place where it was made. The date of its acquisition or photographing provides a terminus ante quem, be- fore which it must have been executed. If an object belonging to a recent ethnological culture has been ex- cavated, the soil stratification of the site is particularly important for dating it.3 Above all, in each case one must use the following criteria to further establish the object's position in space and time. CRITERIA FOR CLASSIFICATION MATERIAL Because the materials used for art objects differ among peoples and through time, the material may form one criterion for the place and date of execution. Haselberger: METHOD OF STUDYING ETHNOLOGICAL ART TECHNIQUE The technique of execution may also indicate the object's date and place of origin. PURPOSE Ethnological and prehistoric peoples have produced works of art for a number of purposes, some of the more important of which are: (1) Utilitarian.-e.g. a building for protection from rain. (2) Ritual.-e.g. a building housing a sanctuary; or a statue in which an ancestor is to reside. (3) Educational.-e.g. Australian bark-paintings, used at initiation and age-grading ceremonies to teach young men the myths and folkways of the tribe (Mountford 1956: 6). (4) Commercial.-e.g. art objects produced as trade goods, such as the modern "tourist art." (5) Social prestige.-e.g. artistic creations representing the power and wealth of a ruler. (6) Social control.-e.g. masks to maintain order and dis- cipline. (7) Art for art's sake.-Himmelheber (1935: 49) reports that in the Atutu village of Afotobi, Ivory Coast, he found small signal horns, ointment containers, and sword grips without any practical functions: the sword grips lacked openings for inserting the blade; the salve containers could not be opened; the signal horns lacked mouthpieces. On being questioned, the natives stated that on festival days they set these objects before themselves to rejoice in their sight. Himmelheber conclusively established that these items were made without European influence. In 1956 I found that most of the murals painted2by West African women are valued only for their decorative and aesthetic qualities: they are intended to make the house look beautiful, and have no practical or ritual functions.4 For these reasons, I cannot share Gerbrand's (1957: 74) skepticism about the existence of "art for art's sake" among ethnological peoples. The primary purposes of artistic creation differ in each style epoch and among each people. Therefore a description of the use and purpose of art objects can help determine the time and place of their manufac- ture.5 CONTENT Examples of the content of works of art are the Gothic cathedral as an image of the Celestial Jerusalem, or a wooden sculpture as the portrait of a ruler. Interpretation of the content of ethnological art ob- jects should be drawn, if possible, from written sources, as well as from oral statements and traditions that re- quire critical evaluation according to the methods es- tablished by Graebner (1911), Schmidt (1937), and Van Bulck (1931). If the content of an artistic creation must be interpreted without oral or written sources, one first determines what is actually represented, seeking objects in nature that might be the model. Thus, one may find that the object represents, let us say, a man, or a mother with child, or an animal. Once this is determined, the mythology, religion, and history of the culture involved may be drawn upon for further classification of the 2W. Fagg* (p. 366) points out that this is true only for the past 70 years. 3 Of course, there are other criteria for obtaining the terminus ante quem; some of these are noted in Claerhout's* comment (p. 364). 4Blackwood* (p. 360) cites another example of "art for art's sake," from New Guinea. 5As Altman* (p. 357) points out, every art object may simul- taneously serve several purposes or functions. Vol. 2 No. 4 * October 1961 345</page><page sequence="6">object. Should this be insufficient for a clear interpreta- tion of the content, one uses the method of unilateral interpretation, i.e., one compares the object whose con- tent is unknown with an object of similar form that has already been explained. If such an object is not avail- able, one turns to the method of reciprocal interpreta- tion: an art object, whose content is partially known, is compared with a similar object whose content is also partly interpreted but with respect to different parts, so that the two objects complement each other. Both unilateral and reciprocal interpretation require the use of objects as close as possible to each other in space and time. Interpretative studies based on the comparison of objects by long periods of time or great distances require awareness of the fact that entirely different starting points can lead to very similar forms. The interpretation of content proceeds step by step. First, one determines what is represented. If the ob- ject is, for instance, a bear, one next tries to discover the meaning of the representation of such an animal in this particular case: a hunting scene, for instance, an alter ego, or a totem animal. One moves to a third level of meaning in asking about the significance of the hunting scene, for instance, and perhaps learning that it repre- sents hunting magic. Thus, in the case described, one can establish three layers of meaning for an art object.6 After making as thorough a study as possible of the motifs, the art investigator can turn to their compari- son. Such a comparison can show the origin of the motifs; possible convergences among them (i.e., the same motifs may be produced at different times and places from the same assumptions); and their diffusion, mingling, borrowing, penetration, etc. Thus, starting with the content of art objects, the investigator arrives at their provisional temporal and spatial classification. Research directed toward explaining the content of ethnological art has been rather neglected, and such studies have been few, except for those of Boas (1908) and his pupils, Karutz (1927), Kaudern (1944), Mount- ford (1956), Nuoffer (n. d.), Sierksma (1960), and Vis- sers (1948). FORM Another basis for the classification of art objects is analysis of their outward form, or style criticism. The style of an art work is best grasped through description. Such description is not only a preliminary step; it is also the goal of the preceding scientific analysis, whose results the description presents in a systematic form. The individual style of any work of art is brought out most clearly by comparison with similar objects. Style comparisons must draw upon objects that, as far as pos- sible, correspond in material, technique, purpose, and content, so that differences caused by these factors are minimal, while differences in the formal artistic char- acter of the objects are emphasized. Thus, the investiga- tor does not compare a wooden sculpture with a brass casting, nor an idol with a portrait; he compares idol with idol, portrait with portrait, brass casting with brass casting, and wooden sculpture with wooden sculp- ture. One begins with the comparison of the whole form- the effect and proportions of the object as a whole-and only then turns to details; for, details with similar forms can have different kinds of origin. If the object is a statue, for instance, one first describes its proportions- whether these are natural, thick-set, or deliberately lengthened-and only afterward takes up physiognomy and other details. For the comparison of art objects, Franckl (1938), Panofsky (1915, 1920-25), Rank (1932), Riegl (1893), Schmalenbach (1958: 310ff), Schmarsow (1905), Segy (1956: 104), Wolfflin (1915), Wulff (1917), and others have worked out pairs of contrasting style types to dis- cover formal characteristics of decisive significance, which would otherwise remain unnoticed. These oppos- ing pairs, however, were obtained through the study of European art, and only a few are useful in art investiga- tion among ethnological peoples. This is shown by the following examples, arbitrarily chosen from a great number of possible opposite pairs: Tectonic-A tectonic Tectonic-Internal structure is clearly evident from the external view. Example: an earthen vessel whose base, body, and neck are clearly contrasted, and whose ornament may emphasize this structure, such as Attic vases of the geomet- rical style period, Dipylon cemetery. Atectonic-The inner structure of the object or building is not accentuated-and sometimes even veiled-by its form. Example: an earthen vessel whose base, body, and neck run into each other without sharp demarcations, such as neolithic vases from Thessaly or Zapotec vases from Mexico. Haptic-Optic Haptic.-Forms that are best comprehended when seen at close range, or by handling and touching. Example: A great deal of ethnological sculpture, such as royal statues from the Bushongo tribe, Congo. Optic.-Forms that are most effective at a distant view. The optical conception, being typical of the latest phases of art style, is, as far as I know, nowhere found among ethno- logical peoples. This pair, therefore, is not useful in ethno- logical art research. Sensuous-Imaginative Sensuous.-Naturalistic, the subject being represented as it is comprehended by the senses-particularly, by sight-and not necessarily as it is shaped in reality. This concept is rare in ethnological art. Example: animal representations in Magdalenian rock paintings, as at Altamira cave, Spain. Imaginative.-Stylized; the artist's point of departure is his own idea of the object represented, and he abstracts from what he sees in nature. To this type of art belongs the greatest part of that produced by recent ethnological peoples. Example: animal representations on rock, from the Scandi- navian Neolithic. Since the imaginative style predominates among ethno- logical peoples, it may usefully be broken down into: (1) X-ray drawings, showing not only the outward appear- ance of an animal, but also its interior organs. Example: drawings from Australia, Melanesia, and Northwest America (Adam 1949: 38). (2) Dissection of the animal into limbs and organs, which are reconstituted as mosaic-like inorganic combinations. Ex- ample: Animal pictures drawn by the Haida and Tlingit Indians, Northwest America. (3) Pars pro toto representations, omitting unimportant parts of the represented object (Schlosser 1952). Example: 1 The method of content-investigation outlined in Altman's* comment (pp. 355-358) proves very useful. 346 CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY</page><page sequence="7">earthenware images of the eye, made in England during the second and first millenia B.C. Harmony with the Material- Independence from the Material Harmony with the material.-The artistic form respects the material of which it is composed. Example: Sculptured posts, Galla, East Africa. Independence from the material.-The material does not influence the aesthetic form; or the form imitates another kind of material. Examples: wooden containers imitating the surface of wickerwork, Bushongo, Congo. Frontality-Space-Depth Frontality.-The work of art has one main prospect, a single viewpoint from which it is most effective; if viewed from another position, ugly displacements result. This fixed viewpoint produces an effect of flatness. Space-depth.-The viewer is intended to look at the work of art from all angles; with architecture, he has to seek dif- ferent points of view in the interior as well to admire the overlapping of forms, and he must walk back and forth to obtain an impression of space-depth. The intentional use of space-depth is rare in the art of ethnological peoples; but the almost universal appearance of frontality is misleading. In ethnological art, "frontality" is usually not a contrast to space-depth, but rather a mask- like rigidity or immobility, characteristic of ghosts and the dead-a binding of sculpture to the block. This condition potentially contains both space-depth and frontality, whose separation is carried though only in the high cultures. There- fore I agree with Schmalenbach (1958: 310ff) that Lange's (1899) "law of frontality of all pre- and non-Greek art" is confined to artistic creations within the primary high cul- tures, and does not hold for the fine arts of recent ethno- logical peoples. Ethnological art is far too alive, too real and corporeal, to be subject to mere aesthetic laws. When a Baffinland Eskimo, for instance, portrays an animal (Schaeffer-Simmern 1958), his sculpture is intended to repre- sent the living animal in all its reality. Base and main- prospect are superfluous for such a carving, and are therefore neglected. Many of the magnificent ancestor-figures from Africa and Oceania, which we admire in the light-flooded showcases of museums, were originally placed in unlighted corners of dark rooms where there was no possibility of their being seen from a favorable point of view. Observation by the carver of an aesthetic frontality law, therefore, would have been useless. When it involves comparisons, the study of ethnolog- ical art will have to use ideal types of opposite pairs of formal characteristics. Since only a few of the contrast- ing pairs defined by European art historians apply to ethnological art, an important preliminary task is the discovery of opposed pairs that demonstrate essential principles of form in the latter. When the artistic-formal principles of an art object have been identified through comparison of its stylistic peculiarities, further comparison will establish its place in the development of art styles. This in turn provides additional criteria for determining its time and place of origin, and ensures its best possible classification in those respects. STRUCTURE The detailed study of a work of art also requires investigation of its structure, and thus of the mutual dependence and interaction of material, technique, purpose, content, and form. Haselberger: METHOD OF STUDYING ETHNOLOGICAL ART Material The material, like the technique of execution, con- siderably affects the form of a work of art. Yet, material and technique are not the only factors determining the style, as was alleged by a materialistic theory of art founded by Semper's (1861-63) pupils, the effects of which still persist. In certain periods, the properties of materials were an important consideration and their characteristic qualities were accentuated. Thus, the bulk and heaviness of stone were decisive factors in the effect produced by architecture of the Romanesque pe- riod. But other periods of style have given art greater freedom from its materials, the essential characteristics of which might be negated. Thus in Gothic architec- ture, stone was freed from its natural weight, and was etherealized in order to obtain a diaphanous wall structure corresponding to the cathedral's significance as an image of the Celestial Jerusalem. In still other periods of European art history, architects successfully tried to simulate the appearance of materials that actu- ally were unavailable. Thus, Baroque architects some- times treated stucco lustro in such a way as to produce the effect of marble. The study of European art thus indicates that within the total structure of a work of art the material can have three different kinds of significance. Further research on such different possibilities in the art of ethnological peoples will be one of the tasks for the ethnological study of art. Technique Similarly, technique has varying importance for the final state of a work of art. At present there is a tendency to make the genesis of a work of art clearly visible. Ex- amples of this trend include the impressions of wooden forms in the poured concrete of Le Corbusier's build- ings, and the brush stroke on Impressionist paintings. Other styles, however, tend to efface any trace of the labor; thus, on Michelangelo's Pieth in St. Peter's, Rome, the marble has been smoothed. Similar contrasts in style can be shown in ethnological art, but this prob- lem has not been intensively investigated. Purpose The purpose of a work of art, within its total struc- ture, has also been given unequal consideration at dif- ferent periods. Sometimes functionalism is the end. At other times, the form itself was considered of such im- portance that artists would sacrifice complete functional utility to preserve their aesthetic ideal. An example of such cases where the form overrides the purpose is the Palazzo Piccolomini at Pienza, Italy: the exterior or- ganization does not correspond to the interior, and be- hind the magnificent facade are several dimly-lighted intermediate stories. Research to date indicates that the ethnological artist is less concerned with the aesthetic-formal principles of the object he shapes than with its practical or ritual purpose. But this subject needs deeper investigation, which may produce unexpected results. The "purpose- bound" character often ascribed to ethnological art is Vol. 2 * No. 4 * October 1961 347</page><page sequence="8">surely an exaggeration. My own experience, like that of other fieldworkers in Africa (Gerbrands 1957: 74, 75, 78, 89, 111) has convinced me that artistic-aesthetic motives have considerable importance for the ethnolog- ical artist, and that he is entirely capable of recognizing formal-aesthetic qualities. In ethnological societies, body-decorations, clothing, and houses often indicate the existence of a well-developed sense of beauty. Any- one who has observed, as I did, the eager rivalry of Kissi women painting secular wall-murals, their critical ex- amination of any newly invented motifs, and their careful execution of detail, can no longer doubt that the artistic activity of ethnological peoples aims at aesthetic purposes. Content Another subject for investigation is content within the total structure of an art object. Content is deter- mined, first, by the purpose of the art object, and sec- ond, by the wishes of the patron or those of still a third person who may influence the patron. I have in mind, for instance, a medicine man who wants an image made in a form according to details he gives, for placating an angry deity. He describes these details to a person who has to pay an artist for fabricating the image according to the wishes of the medicine man. The wishes of the artist himself also have a role in determining the con- tent of a work of art. Yet among ethnological peoples, much more than among highly cultured ones, both art- ist and patron are subject to a tradition founded- according to their belief-on divine command, and to the kind of spiritual life prevailing in their culture. For this reason, they are not free in choosing the content for a work of art. The role of content in shaping a work of art is not uniform. In some periods, the power of expression is very strong, and is the primary aim of the artist, as in the Expressionist school of twentieth century painting. At other times, the "meaning" of art works is so reduced that their decorative value becomes almost the sole con- sideration, as in decorative paintings of the Baroque and Rococo periods. There is not yet enough evidence to draw general conclusions about the significance of content within the total structure of ethnological artistic creations; further research is necessary. Form The artistic form has a decisive role in the structure of a work of art. Beyond the factors defined above (material, technique, purpose, and content), form is af- fected by the environment in which a work of art is produced,1by the people and race to which the artist and patron belong, by their economic and social posi- tion, and, finally, by political, historical, and spiritual conditions. The artist's mastery of material, technique, purpose, and content decides the artistic value of the object. Undoubtedly, ethnological peoples place a higher value on the form of their artistic creations than Western art critics have supposed; but a definite resolu- tion of this problem is not yet at hand. Interaction of the five elements outlined above-ma- terial, technique, purpose, content, and form-consti- tute the structure of a work of art. CULTURAL CONTEXT In the systematic study of a work of art, the final task is placing the object within the culture to which it be- longs. Does it belong to the beginning, the climax, or the end of development of a particular style? Is it a pio- neering, a mature, or a late work of that style? Compari- son of the object with other works of its stylistic stage will enable the investigator to draw conclusions about its artistic merit. It is important to discover how far the position of an art object within the total culture is determined by non- artistic factors of an economic, political, or spiritual nature; and what importance the art object has for such non-aesthetic spheres of culture as education or propa- ganda. Another subject for investigation is the value the work had at the time of its creation, whether this has changed, and what changes have occurred. This large field still awaits study. THE ARTIST'S BIOGRAPHY First, the life of the artist should be presented in chronological order against the economic, political- historical, and intellectual background of his time and country. His racial and national origin and his ancestry should be given, and his home, childhood, and educa- tion described. How did he find his vocation? Was the driving force the joy of artistic creation, or was it eco- nomic advantage?' The description of the artist's life should also show whether he worked on the basis of orders received, or for later sale; who were his patrons and customers; what social spheres he frequented; in what esteem he was held; and what his spiritual interests were. It is also necessary to note the dates of important events in his life, and of his changes in residence. Such biographical data has seldom been presented; the few exceptions include Adair (1945), Cordwell (1952), Him- melheber (1935, 1939, 1953, 1959), and Vandenhoute (1945). The second part of the biography should show the development of the artist's personal style. His works are first to be ordered chronologically, and each one treated according to the principles set forth above. Subse- quently, particularly important periods of his creative work, marked by common stylistic features, should be separated from the purely chronological material, and their essential properties shown; and ultimately the artist's entire work should be described with a view to the dynamics of consecutive periods. The next step will be an evaluation of the historical and aesthetic impor- tance of his work. Such investigations of the personal style of the ethnological artist have hitherto been neg- lected. USE OF PSYCHOLOGICAL METHODS A closer approach to the artist's personality may be gained through psychological methods, which are of particular value in the study of the art of ethnological peoples, whose work largely resists the historical method. Adam (1949: 62-67), Freud (1934), Maes (1926), Muinsterberger (1955), Segy (1950), Sydow (1927), Verworn (1908), and others have written on this subject. For investigating the psychological foundations of 348 CURRENT AN THROPOLOGY</page><page sequence="9">the enhanced receptivity and expressive power of the creative artist, the methods of both individual psychol- ogy and psychological typology promise good results. INDIVIDUAL PSYCHOLOGY The method of individual psychology provides an understanding of the individual artist's personality. Its best-known branch is psychoanalysis. One important subject for such investigations are the mental motiva- tions of creative activity. The psychoanalyst explores the subconscious and unconscious impulses leading to artistic creation, and discovers whether the act of crea- tion represents the artist's wish to repress past adversi- ties, to sublimate repressed instincts, or to express a particular vision. Yet it must be noted that the aesthetic notions used in psychoanalysis so far are too vague for achieving really important insights into the essen- tial substance of an artist. TYPE PSYCHOLOGY The method of psychological typology uses "heuristic ideals" of various types of artists to approach the nature of the artist from a direction that cannot be compre- hended with the methods of individual psychology. The defects inherent in such heuristic ideal types as have been established are obvious: they cannot ap- proach the unique quality of the artist's personality. Yet their usefulness cannot be disregarded. Of the great number of ideal types, the following are some of the most important. Constitutional Types A constitutional type is the ideal of a person particu- larly distinguished by a number of psycho-physical qualities. When such a Konstitutionstypus is strongly present among a people, its effect may be seen in all parts of their cultural life; a uniform tendency will characterize such a people from bodily appearance to the highest productions of their culture (Kretschmer 1955, 1958). Empirical proof of the hypothesis that a constitutional type is correlated with a particular style of art is considerably complicated by several factors: in practice there is never a pure type; the results of type psychology are valid only for the genotype, and not for the phenotype; psychic and physical nature have a di- verging heredity; and, finally, we still lack a definitive type psychology, because research is in such flux that we must time and again adapt ourselves to the latest posi- tion. But it is quite certain that connections between con- stitutional types and artistic styles exist. Strongly marked differences have been shown between artistic creations of children belonging to the leptosome-schizo- thym constitutional type, and those of the pyknic-zyklo- thym type. Apart from such studies, the history of Western art indicates the existence of two contrasting streams of artistic talent among Europeans of different periods and nations, which are perhaps based on differ- ent constitutional types. Examples of these contrasting style groups in European art are, in antiquity, Dorian and Ionian art; and in Renaissance times, the art of Florence and that of Venice. The first group is marked by greater talent for draw- ing than for painting; a tendency to see forms; an incli- Haselberger: METHOD OF STUDYING ETHNOLOGICAL ART nation toward abstraction; and a static, quiet style. Work created by artists of this group is characterized by purpose-oriented ornament. Non-aesthetic factors-con- tent and purpose-are more essential to this art than is the formal-aesthetic element; as a result, the influence of the political, social, and economic environment on art is far reaching. The second group is characterized by strong tenden- cies toward fantasy and realism, an emphasis on color, and preference for a dynamic style and curvilinear or- nament. Formal viewpoints are more important than practical ones, and art belonging to this style-tendency is thus more independent of the general historical situ- ation. These two constitutional and stylistic types, however, are only extreme examples of a whole series of types. The three main problems of ethnological art research involving constitutional types are: (1) to identify con- stitutional types that will be useful in investigating the art of ethnological peoples; (2) to identify stylistic qual- ities in their art; and (3) to correlate racial, anthropo- logical, or psychological personality-types with different stylistic tendencies. Several studies of ethnological peoples suggest that such ideal types could be established for their artistic production. Thus, the Anglican missionary Edward Paterson (1949), who gave drawing lessons to boys from the Matabele, Shona, Barziwi, Makalaka, and Nyasa tribes, whose ages ranged from eight to twenty-two years, noticed considerable differences among the vari- ous tribes, regardless of general talent. The Matabele youths, whose people led the nomadic life of cattle- breeders, painted more realistically that youths of the agricultural Shona tribes, whose talent tended to be more ornamental. The final word on this problem, however, will have to be given by expert psychologists; and so far, very few studies have been made by them. Types of Aesthetic Vision A different classification of artists into psychological types may be based on kinds of aesthetic talent. Four standard types developed by Miiller-Freienfels (1923- 1933) are: (1) The sensory type. This type of artist especially inter- prets the sensual perceptions produced by a work of art; other associations are of minor importance to him. For such an artist, a painting consists primarily of colors and shapes, and its content is less important. (2) The kinesthesia type. In his work, this type of artist primarily wants to shape his conception of space and motion. An example is the "figura serpentinata" of European Ma- nierismus. (3) The imaginative type. Imaginative artists start with a vision of their imagination, and often stylize the content of their work. (4) The emotional type. The emotional artist wishes to eternalize sympathy and erotic love in his work, and to en- hance them into a form with general validity. Male and Female Ty pes Men and women, as artistic personalities, constitute basically different types. Appropriate investigations of Vol. 2 No. 4 * October 1961 349</page><page sequence="10">this contrast have not yet been made. They would be useful, not only because the production of art among primitive people is largely in the hands of women (e.g., mural paintings and ceramics in Africa), but also be- cause women have an important indirect influence on art. Deeply rooted differences in male and female art styles can be recognized in many ethnological areas. Such stylistic differences in North American Indians have been reported by Boas (1955: 184), Inverarity (1950: 45), and Linton (in Elisofon and Fagg 1958: 13); Bastide (1958) found them among the Indians of Brazil; and Wingert (Linton et al. 1946), among the Maori of New Zealand. While studying African murals, I was able to distin- guish a men's and a women's style. Women restrict themselves to secular abstract decorations, which some- times include highly stylized human figures, musical instruments, tools, etc. They use only the three tradi- tional colors of Negro Africa, black, red, and white. Secular murals painted by men are realistic, and all pos- sible European colors are used; their religious and mag- ical murals are painted in black, white, and red, and stylized, like those painted by women; but differ greatly in style. The secular murals painted by women, which include very ancient, perhaps Neolithic, ornament, are considered old-fashioned, and this art is now often abandoned. The more realistic, vari-colored secular murals painted by men are very popular, and can be found in a large area of Africa. In recent years, however, European influence seems to have blurred the stylistic differences between paintings by men and by women. In 1956, in the Guinea coast hinterland, I found a num- ber of men who had studied the women's style and become professional painters. Their style was marked by the interpolation of realistic figures into the ancient, stylized, abstract decorative pattern learned from the women. But sexual-psychological differences cannot always explain differences among artistic expression in men and women, which sometimes result from historical developments. Such a development was involved in the differences between the mural styles of men and women among the Kissi and Toma in West Africa. Here I was able to show that the murals painted by Kissi and Toma men during initiation ceremonies were formerly known only to the Toma, and in the past decades were taken over by the Kissi tribe, together with the "toma sassa- ceremony." But, the splendid wall decorations, in a totally different style, with which Kissi and Toma women cover their houses, are an old Kissi heritage imi- tated only in the past several years by the Toma. Thus, what a superficial investigation might interpret as a male and a female style of mural painting among the Kissi and Toma could, by more thorough examination, be shown to be the traditional styles of two different tribes. The Eidetic Type This type is of paramount importance in prehistoric and ethnological art. Certain persons-particularly juveniles, and women more often than men-are able to re-create in their imagination subjective pictures of objects they once perceived, even after considerable time has passed. These images have great intensity, and may sometimes be artistically reproduced in a direct way (Jaensch 1922, 1930). Such persons have the ability, not through memory, but simply by re-reading the mental image of a briefly seen object, to describe the object exactly, and even to draw it. Eidetic talent of this sort partially explains the naturalistic character of Paleolithic cave-paintings, of certain styles in Bushman painting, and of Cretan art (Snyder 1936). It has been stated that Bushmen, when painting on rock, first drew points which they then con- nected by a line, creating the outline of a figure. Perhaps this method of execution resulted from the imitation of an eidetic mental image. Eidetic talent would also explain pictures showing figures floating in space, unconnected with a horizon, as well as the use of unnaturalistic colors. Perhaps the occasional place- ment of animal images perpendicular to their normal position can be explained as a disarrangement of the mental image. Eidetic talent can be artificially evoked or enhanced by the vision-producing agents used in certain cults; by stimulating the eidetic ability, the cult directly interacts with art. The visions produced by peyote (mescalin), Natema, Gauyusa, Maikoa (Datura arborea), and the Pitcherie of the Australians are well known. Represen- tations on Cretan seals suggest a delirium of the senses evoked by henbane (Hyoscyamus niger) or thorn apple (Datura stramonium). Henbane can produce images and visions; and the thorn apple is connected with reli- gious conceptions. The Tungus use the poisonous fungi, fly agaric (Amanita muscaria) to stimulate the optical sense. As far as can now be determined, shamans and medicine men were especially trained in eidetic ability. Macropsia can produce over-life-size images; and such composite beings as centaurs can appear through the juxtaposition of eidetic images. Eidetic ability has also been observed in the acoustic sense area. Charles Darwin, for instance, reports that when he visited them between 1831 and 1836 the Fue- gans could repeat, without error, whole English sen- tences of which they did not understand a single word; this was probably due to acoustical imitation. The fre- quent night-long recitation of ritual texts by ethnologi- cal peoples, which, as experiments have shown, are ordinarily recited without error, must be related to these talents, which, without doubt, also partially ex- plain the verbal richness of the languages of non-literate peoples. The number of eidetics varies greatly from place to place, perhaps influenced by such factors as constitu- tional type, racial type, ultraviolet rays, and the chalk- content of drinking water. THE ARTIST'S WORKING PROCESS Further clarification of the nature of artistic talent may be gained through analysis of the artist's working process. Does he add detail upon detail, for instance, or does he work from the large form to small forms? Does the final shape of the object crystallize in his mind only in the course of execution, or does he start with the finished concept in his mind? Most descriptions of the working process of the ethnological artist indicate that he often imitates a masterpiece he once saw and men- tally remembers; or that he copies an actual piece of art 350 CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY</page><page sequence="11">placed before him while he works. Very often he seems to have a fully conceived picture in his mind before he starts to carve or paint, and he seldom alters a design or corrects a brush stroke. Free and new creations occur, but infrequently. The biography should conclude with remarks on the life expectancy of the artist's work, and his effect on disciples or other imitators. A few investigators, such as Cordwell (1952), Him- melheber (1935, 1953, 1959), and Vandenhoute (1945) have tried to see the actual person in the anonymous non-literate artist. They collected biographical data about the lives and professional careers of Eskimo and African Negro artists, and also tried to do justice to their individual stylistic qualities. On the whole, the time for collecting biographies of ethnological artists has passed. Perhaps the next few years will offer a few last opportunities for this kind of art investigation among non-literate tribes, but soon it will be impossible to find sculptors, painters, or architects working within their tribal traditions. Already the most skilled artists have been absorbed in the ranks of those producing art work for the tourist trade. STUDY OF ART IN THE WHOLE STRUCTURE OF THE CULTURE Since each civilization constitutes an indivisible entity, the investigator studying any part of culture, such as the fine arts, should always keep the total cul- ture in mind. A structural study of art, therefore, should be designed to analyze the structure of a civiliza- tion, and the relationships and intertwining of its vari- ous fields; and to show the position of art in the culture, as well as the order in which individual arts are ranked. EXAMPLES OF INTERRELATION The close relations between many cultural and artis- tic fields may be illustrated by a few examples: ECONOMY AND ART. The influence of economic conditions on art is often overrated. For instance, the assumption that art should be considered a luxury based on wealth is contradicted by many facts. Outstanding masterpieces have often been created in periods of economic depression, and time and again an artist has produced major works while living in the utmost misery. It is true that the production of art objects generally increases in prosper- ous times, but this affects the number and richness of such objects, not their artistic quality. An important factor for ethnological art is the "divi- sion of labor" in some ethnological societies that ena- bles an artist to live entirely on the proceeds of his works. Once the society achieves this level of economic development, the artist has two alternatives: he finds a patron who provides his subsistence (e.g., the applique- embroiderers at the court of Abomey, Dahomey, are supported by the king); or he gains a living by selling his products (e.g., the carvers living in the village of Baname near Abomey). Art, in turn, may be a more or less important factor in the economy. Increasing aes- thetic demand may stimulate the entire economy, and when individuals or whole villages, such as Baname Haselberger: METHOD OF STUDYING ETHNOLOGICAL ART (Dahomey), make the production or trading of art the economic basis of their existence, they form a special kind of economy, even if it may not be particularly im- portant within the total culture. Repeated attempts have been made to prove that certain forms of economy are always associated with certain forms of art (Graebner 1924; Grosse 1894; Kuhn 1952). Thus, sculpture is alleged to have originated in agrarian cultures; and it has been claimed that pastoral peoples could not develop art beyond good handicraft. Undoubtedly, sedentary peoples have better opportu- nities to produce sculpture and elaborate buildings than do nomads who must move about continuously, carrying their possessions with them. Yet prehistoric rock-paintings, which were made by roaming hunters (e.g. Altamira, Spain, and Fezzan, Libya) or nomadic herders (e.g., Libya), show that nomads create perma- nent works of art at sites that are sacred in their reli- gion, or rendered particularly important by other causes. An explanation for the lack of buildings at such sites or of more sculptured images than those ac- tually found, must therefore be sought in factors other than nomadic existence. SOCIAL STRUCTURE AND ART The great importance of social structure for art has been pointed out by Paul Honigsheim (1928) and K. M. Swoboda (1952), who suggest that matriarchal cultures have played a special role in the formation and develop- ment of art. This hypothesis, however, still lacks actual evidence. The development of various social ranks is a precon- dition for the specialization of artists. If such officials as chiefs, priests, or princes wish to maintain their spe- cial position within a social order, they must symbolize these positions; thus, they commission artists, and stim- ulate the creation of art. This situation may lead to the formation of a court or patrician style of art that differs from the tribal or plebian style, as occurs in a number of African kingdoms. Domination of the culture by any particular class will always be reflected by art, as late medieval European art reflects the specific importance of the middle class during this period of European his- tory. Among many ethnological peoples, the produc- tion of art objects is restricted to members of a certain social group, such as blacksmiths. Certain ethnological peoples are divided into free citizens and slaves-into rulers and ruled. Often the two segments correspond to entirely different nationalities. Most social structures of this type developed when a sedentary agricultural people became subject to a no- madic pastoral group. When studying the art of such a society, which constitutes a cultural unit only in out- ward form, it is very important to establish to which class the artists belong. In Africa, for instance, artists are for the most part drawn from the peasant popula- tion, because the ruling classes despise handicraft, which includes the making of art. Among the Mangbetu-Bangba of the Congo, for example, the beau- tiful house-paintings are made exclusively by Bangba women. Art thus depends in many ways on the social struc- Vol. 2 - No. 4 * October 1961 351</page><page sequence="12">ture. On the other hand, the effect of art on social or- ganization is slight among "ethnological" peoples, be- cause the formation of closely organized artist groups- such as the medieval societies of builders or the applique-workers corporation at the royal court, Abomey-has until now had only a negligible effect in the social structure. IDEOLOGY AND ART Intellectual culture includes, among other constitu- ents, custom, morality, religion, metaphysics, poetry, painting, dancing, and music, all of which have some relation with art. If the world-conception of a society, for instance, is hostile to art, it may greatly inhibit artistic production. Thus, belief in a supreme deity, especially pronounced in Islam, prohibits the making of images of the god. Christian missions have played an important role in de- stroying traditional tribal arts. But heathen cults have exercised an equally fatal influence. Thus Maesen, in the Enciclopedia Universale Dell'Arte, mentions the fact that many Bantu peoples have, within the frame- work of their own cultural process, accomplished this same destruction of traditional cult-emblems. Wissmann called attention to the example of the Luba (Bashi Lange) of Kalamba Mukenge, who zealously searched out and burned their statuettes in order to make way for the intro- duction of the "riamba" hemp cult. Various Congo tribes have time and again undergone similar experiences. Central Africa, gripped by the crises that accompany its growing self-awareness, has seen the appearance in many places, but especially in the Middle French Congo, of syn- cretistic cults, often involving prophetic phenomena. These movements have brought about the decay and the obliga- tory destruction of art objects. In the dozen or so years since its first appearance, this injunction, the effectiveness of which cannot be doubted, has spread throughout the Lower Congo, affecting even the peoples of the large region lying between the Kwilu and the Kwango. The most recent of these massive auto-da-f6s took place in 1954 and resulted in the loss of numerous works of art, of which only a small part could be recovered by museums or private collectors. Although Bantu societies seem to have practiced such self-induced destruction of their artistic patri- mony in every period of time, it is clear that today these societies can no longer bring forth those resurgences of cultural vitality that are inducive of a productive renais- sance. Other ideologies stimulate art. Animism, for exam- ple, requires spirit-seats and masks; magical conceptions of the world need images of persons and objects for magical rites. And what significance has art for religious concep- tions? It can supplement the abstractions of religion with concrete symbolism, rendering them pictorial. Thus art may contribute to the spread of a religion, and produce an educational effect. OTHER ASPECTS OF ART AND CULTURE The theory of the Vienna School of Ethnology that the origin of art lies in the "totemic" Kulturkreis, which is at the same time the main location of art, is now ob- solete. W. Koppers (1959) recently showed that the Kulturkreis concept as a principle of historical research has been replaced by newer concepts in the develop- ment of procedures for ethnological-historical research. Hereafter, statements of the Kulturkreislehre about the origin of certain stylistic forms, and their attribution of these to certain culture-circles, are also superseded. Yet, to have perceived the association of certain meta- physical, economic, social, and artistic forms remains to the credit of advocates of the Kulturkreislehre. A structural investigation of art will further have to trace the differences among architecture, painting, and sculpture in regard to the interactions of economy, so- ciety, intellectual culture, and art. Research on this problem is very much needed. What position is held by art in the total culture of a people: does it have a predominant role, as with the Greeks, or a subordinate one, as among the Romans? Which branch of art-architecture, sculpture, or paint- ing-takes precedence; in which field are the artistic talents of a people pre-eminent? Which branch of art takes the lead and creates works of historical impor- tance? In the 19th, and early 20th centuries, for in- stance, painting set new artistic standards for European art, which later became obligatory for sculpture and architecture as well. Recently this situation has been changing, and in Europe sculpture is now supplanting painting as the leading art. Which branch of art pro- duces works of greatest aesthetic value? Until now, in- vestigators of ethnological art have never dealt thor- oughly with such questions. While wood-carving is described in all handbooks, architecture and painting are often ignored, and thus no comparisons can be drawn. In answering these and similar questions, it will be- come clear that the total picture of a culture is not static, and that relations among separate fields are sub- ject to continuous change. Everything that can be said of the position of art within a culture will hold good only for a given historical moment. To provide histori- cal perspective for the structural study of a'rt, therefore, it is necessary to investigate the questions raised above at different periods of time. Such an approach will demonstrate the shifting zones of influence of economic, social, and intellectual culture on art through the course of time, and will show that at different times art owes its principal stimulation to different fields of cul- ture-e.g. to politics, religion, or literature. Further, it will be found that the regard in which art is held varies even within brief periods, and that art cannot always influence civilization to the same extent. These studies will also show that the style of one period may be best represented by architecture, and that of others, by paint- ing or sculpture. In African art, for instance, wood- carving held this position until 1950; but today, paint- ing-an art introduced only 30 years ago-best represents the artistic abilities of the African Negro. When studied within the total structure of a civiliza- tion, art will be understood as an expression of collec- tive inner life. Since art always appertains to a commu- nity, the structural investigation of culture will render good service as an heuristic method providing a closer approach to the essence of a work of art, and to art it- self. If one accepted the psychoanalysts' belief that it is possible to read from works of art the specific mentality of the period and region of origin, one would have in the structural-analytical method of art study a key for reopening the total culture of a past epoch. Such in- 352 CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY</page><page sequence="13">Haselberger: METHOD OF STUDYING ETHNOLOGICAL ART vestigations until now have not been entirely convinc- ing. Yet structural analysis of different ethnological cultures can be expected to yield important results con- cerning the fine arts. HISTORY OF ART AMONG ETHNOLOGICAL PEOPLES The fourth concern of the study of ethnological art is a chronological presentation of the development of art styles. First, the scattered material needed for his- torical research must be selected out of the great mass of art objects lacking artistic or historical value. Then, through arrangement, comparison, and the elimination of extraneous objects, significant works of art are or- ganized into related groups that, so far as artistic quali- ties are concerned, form units. Styles may be defined in terms of space and time: resemblances among a group of art objects from adjacent regions constitute the local style; the similarity among groups of art objects from the same time period is the period style. The next step is to define the character peculiar to each style, and to trace its evolution and decline. Then, through com- parison of motifs and styles, the investigator can es- tablish the historical connections, interactions, and dif- fusion of different styles, ultimately establishing broader homogeneous art complexes and lines of de- velopment.7 Studies of local style complexes and substyles have been frequently undertaken. Tribal styles in Negro Africa have been successfully characterized by Burssens (1958), Fagg (1951), Griaule (1938), Kjersmeier (1935-38), Lem (1948), Madaus (1929), Maesen (1958), Olbrechts (1946), Segy (1933), Sousberghe (1960), Sydow (1930), and Vandenhoute (1948). Haddon (1894) and Preuss (1897) have established stylistic areas for eastern New Guinea, and a similar study was recently made of the western section of the island (Gerbrands 1950). Wingert (1949) and Boas (1955) used stylistic criteria with considerable success to distinguish local style groups on the Northwest Coast of North America.8 Meaningful histories of art can already be written for the ethnological peoples of Africa, North America, and Indonesia; as an example of these, I shall outline below the history of ethnological art in Africa. HISTORY OF AFRICAN ART The oldest known art of Africa comprises the North African rock-paintings, notably revealed by the strik- ing discoveries of H. Lhote (1958) in the Algerian Tassili'n'Ajjer. In 1955, Lhote attempted a preliminary chronology of North African rock art, based upon the superimposed layers of color at certain sites. He postu- lated an early Neolithic "Hunting Period" between 8000 and 6000 B.C., followed by a "Period of Cattle- Breeding" that lasted from 6000 to 1200 B.C. A "Pas- toral Period with Chariots and Cavalry," or "Period of the Horse," began about 1200 B.C. Rock pictures be- longing to the "Period of the Camel" were painted dur- ing the first centuries A.D. Of special interest were Lhote's observations concerning the "Negro" and "Egyptian" character of certain paintings. These ob- servations were confirmed by the finds of F. Mori (1960) in the Tadrarf Acacus, Lybian Fezzan, between 1955 and 1959. Through Mori's work, we have a new C-14 date, 3500 B.C., for one of the rock-shelters with "Ne- gro" and "Egyptian" pictures. This date enables us to evaluate Lhote's dating of the rock-picture region, which extends across North Africa from the Hoggar massif to El Awenat; it also enables us to demonstrate a continuity of Negro art styles for over 5,000 years. Further, the date seems to establish the priority of the "Egyptian" rock pictures over the dynastic art of the Nile valley; and Mori suggests that the puzzling change in style separating predynastic from dynastic Egyptian art may have been due to immigration of Negroid peo- ples from the Sahara. Reciprocal influence between Negroid and non- Negroid African cultures seems to have been far greater than was formerly supposed. It may be noted that Heine-Geldern (1935, 1937) showed a similar artistic interplay between the ethnological and the sophisti- cated cultures of Indo-China, Indonesia, and Oceania. It seems probable that as our knowledge advances, we shall also discover, in the artistic activity of other ethnological culture areas, similar stylistic affinities to the arts of neighboring civilizations-affinities which will lift the former out of their fictitious historical iso- lation. The evidence for reciprocal influences between "so- phisticated" and "ethnological" art styles in Africa has been compiled and critically examined by Davidson (1959). He shows that during the last centuries before Christ-corresponding to the time of transition from the Stone Age to the Metal Age over much of Africa- Carthage, the South Arab states, and the Empire of Kush in Nubia were particularly important centers of culture and the fine arts, influencing the development of art in Negro Africa. Kush, where more than 200 sites await excavation, expanded over East Africa from Egypt to Uganda and Ethiopia, and her influence can be traced even farther to the south and southwest. Kush provided the medium through which, together with other cultural traits, was disseminated the lost-wax tech- nique of casting, which was flourishing in Egypt by 3000 B.C. and later was highly developed in West Africa. This cultural flow to the west and south continued for centuries, so that the influence of the Christian cul- tures that flourished along the Middle Nile Valley be- tween A.D. 600 and 1500 is particularly evident in the eastern Sudan, and can be traced even in the West African forest area. In 1958, Arkell discovered a Chris- tian church and monastery in Darfur, 600 miles west of the Nile (Davidson 1959: 108). Here, on the route by which the Nile Valley culture expanded to the west, lies one of the most important African archaeological sites, a large city that still awaits excavation. At the western end of the route of diffusion from the Nile Val- ley cultures, on the southern and eastern shores of Lake Chad, lie the cities of the Sao, built between the 10th and 16th centuries A.D. From an aesthetic standpoint, Sao architecture is worth thorough investigation. A 7 Bolz's* remark that "la forme voyage seule" is valuable indeed, and the section of her comment (p. 361) that deals with this ques- tion is very informative. 8 This is not intended to be a complete list, but only to offer a few examples. Vol. 2 No. 4 * October 1961 353</page><page sequence="14">great number of pottery heads and tomb figures provide further testimony for the artistic ability of the Sao, whose culture was derived from that of Kush, as that in turn depended on Egypt. Apart from the art styles developed through influence from the Nile Valley cultures, an autochthonous Negro culture evolved in the wide transverse valley of the Niger-Benue in West Africa. This so-called Nok Cul- ture is represented in European museums by a consider- able amount of pottery (Elisofon and Fagg 1958: 58) made between 900 B.C. and A.D. 200, during the period of transition from stone to metal.9 Nok pottery includes several almost life-size portraits that, together with the rock pictures in the Tassili and Acacus, demonstrate the appearance of a realistic representative art among Negroes long before the well-known realistic Ife style -the climax of African Negro art-which flourished in Nigeria between the 12th and 15th centuries A.D. The relation of the realistic Nok art to the bronze and terra- cotta heads or figurines from Ife is unknown. During the 14th century the Benin style, whose bronzes are well known, developed in southern Nigeria under strong Ife influence. The chronology that Luschan (1919) and Struck (1923: 13-66) established for the art of Benin has been rejected by Fagg (Elisofon and Fagg 1958: 66). A new basis for its dating will be available when the ceramic finds noted by Davidson (1959: 127) have been placed in chronological sequence. While the Ife and Benin art styles flourished, there developed in the Sudan powerful states with "Iron- Age" cultures and distinctive art styles, whose effect can still be traced in the ethnological art of the area. Ghana, which was an important power as late as the 13th cen- tury and whose capital at Kumbi Saleh was excavated in 1951, seems to have been the place of origin for the technique of mud-carved wall ornaments still used among the Fulah of the Futa Mountains, the Sussu and Kissi of Guinea, the Nigerian Ibibio, and other West African peoples. In the Central Sudan, the civilizing power was Kanem, whose expansion from the Middle Nile to the Niger made it an important disseminator of culture traits. The Empire of Mali, which began to ex- pand in the early fourteenth century (L'Empire du Mali 1959), eventually included an area as large as Western Europe, reaching from the Adrar des Iforas to Cape Verde, and from Kankan to the Adrar Tagant. It in- troduced into the Sudan and the West African forest- area artistic ideas from the Maughreb. Abu Ishaq es Saheli, a poet from Granada, apparently built a palace and the Mosque at Timbuctu, thereby founding the notable Sudanese style of architecture (Engestrbm 1957), which still determines the appearance of the cities along the Middle Niger between Bamako and Gao. But the power of the Sudanic empires, and their role as disseminators of civilization, were brought to an end in the sixteenth century by Moroccan invasions, the decline of Moorish culture, and the replacement of the African gold trade by richer sources of gold in America. Dates for the pre-Iron Age cultures of South and East Africa, and for their art, remain uncertain. Dwellings of an early Neolithic culture found in Kenya in 1937 (Davidson 1959: 140) have been dated to about 3000 B.C. Paintings of the "woodland Nachikufu" people, whose culture was transitional between hunting-and- gathering and agriculture, have been dated by the radiocarbon method to about 4,000 B.C. Other Neo- lithic cultures, whose art has not yet been arranged in chronological order, flourished after 1000 B.C. During the first seven centuries A.D. the Horn of Africa (David- son 1959: 192) was occupied by a culture that had ac- cepted a number of traits and techniques from Sabeans and Axumites, from Meroe, and from the circum- Mediterranean areas. Eventually forced southward by Islamic expansion, this culture survived in Kenya until the fifteenth century. In East Africa, the Iron Age begins about A.D. 500, the same period as in the West African woodlands.10 A decisive period for the further develop- ment of East and South Africa were the centuries be- tween A.D. 500 and 1000, which saw the origin of the "East Coast Culture," formerly considered purely Arabic, but now shown by recent discoveries to be African. Arab settlements were first founded in the seventh century; about 1300, some of these had de- veloped into elegantly built cities with a distinctive architectural style that has probably influenced the architecture of the inland peoples. Extensive trade be- tween the East Coast of Africa and Iran, India, Indo- nesia, and China explains some of the striking paral- lels between African art and that of peoples living about the Indian Ocean. Considerations of internal policy caused the Chinese to withdraw from this trade by 1500; about the same time, the greed of the Portuguese, who had reached the East Coast in 1488 and 1489, de- stroyed the coastal trade and brought about the decline of East Coast culture and art. The art of the interior, whose development was inti- mately connected with the East Coast trade, is distin- guished above all by its architecture. Mines, terraced fields, and fortresses characterized the interior culture, which expanded over Rhodesia, southern Congo, west- ern Mozambique, and northern Transvaal. Probably its origins can be attributed to the overlaying of Azanian peasants by pastoral peoples from the north. The drystone building technique, one of its most char- acteristic features, perhaps spread south when the Em- pire of Axum declined; the layout of hill-fortresses and hill-dwellings in Southern Rhodesia, Basutoland, and Angola also shows Ethiopian influence. The culmina- tion of this dry-stone architecture can be seen at Zimbabwe, Rhodesia, the erection of which seems to have corresponded with the flourishing East Coast trade between the twelfth and the fifteenth centuries. Zimbabwe shows relations with the elegant dry-stone construction of Nalatali, which originated in the "Mambo" period, from 1450 onward; and with the stone-enclosed streets, canals, terraces, and dwellings of different construction types in Kenya and Tanganyika. The huge earthworks discovered at Bigo, Uganda, show important parallels with the ruins of Zimbabwe. In the hills of the Kenya-Tanganyika borderland were dis- covered the ruins of a city of about 6,800 houses, ap- "I accept with pleasure the amendments offered by B. and W. Fagg* and by Willett*. The dates for the Nok culture should, following B. Fagg* (p. 365), be corrected to 400 B.C.-A.D. 200. I regret having erroneously transplanted some of the Nok sculptures to Eurovean museums. "'According to W. Fagg* (p. 367), the beginning of the Iron Age in West Africa was much earlier. 354 CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY</page><page sequence="15">Haselberger: METHOD OF STUDYING ETHNOLOGICAL ART parently built about 300 years ago; a great number of petroglyphs were also found. Other sites are Dhlo Dhlo, Regina, and Khami in Southern Rhodesia, and Mapungubwe in the Transvaal. Golden plates and or- naments were discovered at the latter site in 1952. The bulk of the present styles of tribal carving, paint- ing, and building in Africa seem to reflect, in a more or less degenerate manner, the art of the old empires. This decline can be attributed not only to European civilization, but also to iconoclastic heathen cults and sects, whose appearance was often followed by regular auto-da-fes of older paraphernalia. In the coastal areas of West Africa, and at the mouth of the Congo, a "tourist art" with some highly qualified styles has developed since the sixteenth century (Fagg, and Forman, 1959); and today a revival of native artis- tic tradition can be seen not only in urban centers, but also in the traditional centers of art (Christensen 1955: 58-59). Princely patrons, such as Njoya, sultan of the Bamum; Eweka II, Oba of Benin; and Bope Mabinshe, Nyimi of the Bushongo, have contributed considerably to this development. Whole villages of carvers, like Baname in Dahomey, produce art today for trade; and among their populations can occasionally be found real talents, able to create new style centers. This African example demonstrates that we already have a number of footholds for compiling histories of ethnological art styles; but many detailed studies re- main to be made before such a summing up of art- historical facts will be entirely successful. STYLE PHASES The art investigator must also discover whether it is possible to distinguish ideally-typical style-periods in the development of ethnological art similar to those established for European art. During the last decades, European art history has expanded beyond the limits of a strictly historical science by using sociological methods to recognize style phases. Through these new methods, it could be shown that eras of art styles in Europe do not succeed each other regularly and uni- formly; but that certain periods might be distinguished in the chronological development of European art. Five great epochs in European art can be distin- guished (Swoboda 1951-52), each with its own peculiar character, but all showing certain parallels in their de- velopment. In each period, two significant antithetical strains can be clearly distinguished in the early forms, which are then followed by a brief synthesis of these contrasts. With the achievement of such a "classic" synthesis, form and content, rest and movement, are balanced, and artistic creations show a high degree of perfection. The first "classic European style" appeared in Greece during the age of Pericles; the second in Augustan Rome; the third in the Byzantium of Justin- ian. European art achieved a "classic" style for the fourth time in the cathedrals of Chartres, Reims, and Amiens. The last "classic" style appeared at Rome, at the beginning of the sixteenth century. Each of these five "classic" epochs, after wave-like phases of develop- ment spreading the "classic" style over a wide area, was followed by a "baroque" period. Each of the five "baroque" periods began with a reform movement ac- centuating the "classical" qualities of the particular style, and closed with a vast loosening, almost a de- composition, of the forms of that style. The final phase of all five styles was characterized by strong emphasis on the artistic qualities of the picturesque, of space-depth and movement. Adama van Scheltema (1950) worked out a similar periodicity for the art of the Neolithic, Bronze, and V6lkerwanderung Ages, distinguishing in each period three stages characterized particularly by the kind of ornament. On the other hand, Kuhn (1952) divided the Paleolithic into three phases, according to art styles. Such attempted classifications are not yet conclusive, because new data and insights frequently necessitate modifications of the hypotheses; and style-phases based on ideal-typical methods cannot reach the individuality of the historical facts. Yet one must grant them an heuristic value for the science of art; and they introduce into the presentation of historical stages a dynamic impetus that corresponds to reality better than does the uniform lining up of single facts. Dempf (1947) has shown similar periods and parallels in the history of philosophy throughout the world; and political science now recognizes historical parallels in world events. It seems probable, therefore, that similar phases will be found in the art of the non-Western civilizations, and of ethnological cultures. Whether their style-stages suc- ceed each other as dynamically as those in the West is very difficult to determine; for each culture has its own dynamism, and we are far from recognizing the peculiar dynamics of foreign cultures. Yet we must not disregard the rhythmical pulsation in the art history of non- literate peoples. FUTURE STUDIES Out of the great number of important questions con- cerning ethnological art, only a few have been answered satisfactorily. Many tasks await future research. The pri- mary need today is detailed studies made with the help of exact methods. Explanation of the personality of an individual artist, systematic description of a single ar- tistic creation, and historical or structural-analytical studies restricted to regional or even local problems should take precedence over vague generalizations about the fine arts of ethnological peoples, as general- ities are useful only insofar as they can be corroborated by thoroughly detailed studies. Comments By RALPH C. ALTMAN* I welcome the publication of Hasel- berger's stimulating paper and regret that lack of time restricts my response to a few comments at random. Parts of the paper read almost like a compendium of ideas about art derived from art history and anthropology. It is good that it attempts to bridge the fields of anthropology and art history. The question that arises is how to find a workable synthesis. To what extent can concepts and ideas of art history be ap- plied to arts of primitive cultures with- out twisting facts to fit? Art history is a Vol. 2 No. 4 * October 1961 855</page><page sequence="16">product of the same culture as its tradi- tional and still primary object-the arts of Western civilizations. The concepts that one is working with must be con- genial to the culture one investigates. The object and objective of study must be defined before a discussion of method becomes meaningful. As Hasel- berger implies, only a volitional defini- tion can be given for the object in ques- tion. There is doubt of the existence of this entity commonly called "primitive art." I, too, dislike the term. However, it has assumed a certain meaning, admit- tedly and necessarily shadowy, which transcends the original connotations to which we object. Deeply implanted in the literature and in our vocabulary, it has resisted many efforts to supplant it. I doubt that a satisfactory substitute can be found, i.e., a denominator common to everything which is customarily called primitive art (see e.g. The Mu- seum of Primitive Art 1957) and dis- tinct from the arts of all literate civiliza- tions. For the present, I prefer to think of primitive arts on the one hand in terms of art in general, and on the other hand in terms as specific as those art historians use, e.g. in the study of Euro- pean arts (Northern Renaissance, Aus- trian Baroque). I endorse, therefore, the segregation of pre-Columbian from primitive arts, although this too is a collective term, and some of its aspects have as little in common as classic Maya and Dogon sculpture. Among the substitutes suggested for "primitive," both "non-literate" and "pre-industrial" are more meaningful than "ethnological." The field of eth- nology seems to me wider than that in which primitive arts occur, and also narrower, inasmuch as archaeological specimens certainly lie within the realm of primitive arts. Besides, I cannot sup- press a phobia against calling an art ob- ject, which is an ethnological specimen, ethnological. Primitive arts have been defined as the arts of cultures which developed es- sentially beyond the spheres of the ma- jor civilizations of the Orient and Oc- cident. Both "major" and "essentially" require emphatic quotation marks. It becomes increasingly evident that the arts of "major" civilizations in proxim- ity to primitive-art areas are not to be excluded from the objects of study. I am grateful for Haselberger's stress on this point. More research is needed, and fewer speculations as to the possible in- teraction between, for example, Meroe and tribal Negro styles; continental Asian and Poly-Mela-Indonesian arts; Old World-New World relations. In which categories should one fit prehistoric arts from areas where major civilizations later evolved? Are modelled Jericho skulls, and Hacilar, Ubaid, or Amratian clay statuettes primitive or not? One might argue pro and con; might, for instance, exclude forms which could be considered related to those of later periods (e.g. Hassuna-Samarran or Susa designs on ceramics) and include whatever has no known descendants (e.g. Ubaid statuettes). A sharp dividing line may never be established, no matter how many classificatory cubbyholes one might construct. From a form-analytical viewpoint it seems to make no sense to call a Mimbres pot primitive and the visually comparable Samarran pot not primitive. Upper Paleolithic arts present similar problems. Where should they be placed? As far as I am concerned, they belong, tentatively, in the complex rubric "Up- per Paleolithic arts." Things may look different tomorrow (if, for instance, presently unexpected links should emerge between Willendorf and Haci- lar, or between Magdalenian and Es- kimo ivories). Of course the question arises: Are the arts of the Western Su- dan within the Niger bend or those of the American Northwest Coast Indians "less unique"? Dilemmas of this kind prove that one can "refer to primitive art only through convenience and convention" (Gold- water 1957). Greater insight into the philosophy of specific living groups, into their con- cepts of reality, might lead to new clas- sifications in the future. Conceivably, criteria might be furnished by style anal- ysis, or the degree of homogeneity or unanimity of a culture, or a cross- cultural approach of the type Steward and Faron (1959) attempted for South America. One may find more exact methods of using our knowledge for interpretation of the works of cultures of the past (Levine 1957). Disregard for "tourist art" as a whole has always seemed to me short-sighted. I am glad Haselberger calls attention to this field, although it is peripheral to the subject. Most of it is debased mass production, primarily expressive of Western civilization today. But some of it is valid as art in its own right, al- though it is art of acculturation (see certain East Canadian Eskimo sculp- tures, Hopi Kachina "dolls," Navaho textiles, Huichol yarn mosaics, Pueblo Indian ceramics, to name just a few American categories). Some of the kinds or details of commercially-made objects may be expressive of cultural values as well as of the demands of the trade. The study of tourist art in the widest sense of the term might contribute to the un- derstanding of the process of accultura- tion, artistic innovation, of the person- ality of the artist, et al. "Folk art," as Haselberger and I un- derstand it, refers to) a distinctive field of inquiry and ought not to be used synonymously with primitive art. True, stratification of certain primitive socie- ties extended into the field of art, pro- ducing forms one might call folk arts. Still, common usage reserved this term for art forms which co-existed with others used by the ruling elements of society in Asiatic and European civiliza- tions (see rural versus urban, or peas- ant versus court arts). Selected aspects of it might well be included in the subject of our study (such as the persist- ence of pre-Hispanic traits in Latin American folk arts or, for comparative purposes, the use of masks in rural Europe). The subject of study must also be defined in other terms: I cannot accept Haselberger's definition of art. I reject "artistic-aesthetic intention" as a cri- terion; "artistic-aesthetic" is methodo- logically not usable. I understand "primitive art" as the sum total of visual arts and crafts, of so-called fine and applied and decora- tive arts. Overemphasis of any single category of art might cause it to be mis- taken for the total range of the arts of a given tribe or area. It prevents the study of one category in the context of others. African Negro sculpture, for instance, has almost come to be taken as synon- ymous with African Negro arts. One must agree with Haselberger when she calls attention to the neglect of so many art categories. We regret that our knowledge of the arts of certain remote periods is restricted to objects which archaeology happened to be able to un- earth. Yet, little is done to save or re- cord material still within our reach. The image of primitive arts created by collections and most art books is cer- tainly different from actuality. Among reasons for this inevitable inadequacy are transportation difficulties, the na- ture of the material, the subjective ap- proach of writers or collectors, the prej- udices of our times, the purpose of collecting. One is dealing with a multiplicity of diverse objects from different cultures and periods which we have come to label art. The meanings the objects had or have for their producers and con- sumers are largely unknown. It is in- conceivable that maker and user lacked aesthetic sensitivity. However, little is known about their aesthetic judgment, norms, or values; or about the nature of concepts equivalent to our "art," (or "artist," "patron," "customer"), which may differ from culture to culture-if they exist or existed at all. One may argue that all art is func- tional, or repeat the truism that all primitive arts are inextricably inter- woven with all phases of life. But these statements remain meaningless unless 356 CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY</page><page sequence="17">Haselberger: METHOD OF STUDYING ETHNOLOGICAL ART it is realized that the significance of art cannot be comprehended except in its unique cultural context. The persistence of labels and classifi- cations which may have been useful tools in the past but are now obsolete is an obstacle to research. I wish at times one could eradicate some of them from our memory. Ideas of unilinear or cycli- cal evolution belong to this category, since they kept us from evaluating, for example, the effect on art of the indi- viduality of the artist and of a multi- plicity of external forces or pressures. Comprehension is often hindered by our compulsion to categorize. The way in which the author uses the purpose for which an object was made as a cri- terion for classification obscures the manifold but inseparable functions and uses that a single object might have. Many classifications fail to recognize certain objects as facets of a greater unit, such as a rite, from which they cannot be divorced. One might pursue different objectives within the study of primitive arts. It must be stated what one really wants to do, since one cannot start going in all directions at once, hoping for ulti- mate synthesis. One might, for example, class the objectives of the study of art objects into 3 large groups (even if the pursuit of one depends partly on the other): 1. Study of the art object for art history. (What is it like? Why is it the way it is? What is its function? What does or did it mean to the society which produced it?) 2. Study of the art object as an avenue toward the understanding of the society, culture, or period of which it is an expres- sion. 3. Study of the art object in the frame of the studies of the psychology and philos- ophy of art. (One might subsume here the investigation of the new significance that the forms of primitive art have acquired for our own culture; the reasons for the in- clusion of a Micronesian chart or a decayed fragment of a Dogon-Tellem statuette in our art exhibitions.) Haselberger lists many ideal goals and important tasks for the field worker who studies arts which are still alive. One might elaborate on some and re- state that research should aim at estab- lishing the following data: 1. An inventory of all collectible and noncollectible forms of the visual arts, in- cluding those which may be physically or intentionally ephemeral within the human group under investigation. An analysis of their relative importance in terms of quan- tity and of the values (material and im- material) attributed to them by the society. Presence or absence of correspondences be- tween the artistic and the sacred. Relations which conceivably exist be- tween the artistic form and the nature of the land, or the specific place for which an object is intended; visual or ideological re- lations between the object and its place or other objects (mask and costume, painting and house front, carved prow and the boat as a whole). The manner in which it is to be seen- if at all. The selection, availability, physical and symbolic properties of the material, in- cluding pigments. The method of manufacture; tools; the time necessary to make it; to acquire the skill necessary to make it; the way the skill was acquired. The presence or absence of concomitant ritual. Values ascribed to the act of making an object. The significance and fate of the finished product. 2. The style or styles. Different categories or media ought to be considered, individ- ually and collectively, using criteria as ob- jective as can be devised. The goals might include style definitions (individual, tribal, regional, chronological), detection of corre- lations with the ecology, function, medium, symbolic content, language, and non-visual arts; investigation of the traditional char- acter of art, of process and causes of varia- tions and change, and their relations to changes in symbolic content (Gombrich 1960:144). Objective criteria must prevent the creation of fictitious "styles" which do not stand up in the face of actual diversity. I believe, with Haselberger, that the sets of polar terms set up by Riegel, W6lfflin, et al. served only a most limited, classifica- tory purpose. Meyer Schapiro (1953:299) said, "they provided no adequate bridge from the model to the unique historical style and its varied developments," and I cannot see the value of looking for other sets. Questions as to the alleged relations be- tween biology (including race, however that may be defined) and style might be investi- gated by physical anthropologists and psy- chologists after "style" and styles have been studied more adequately. Present attempts at correlation impress one as comparisons between unknown quantities. The dangers inherent in the construction of style-evolutionary theories are obvious, and are not always avoided by Haselberger. For example, her pronouncement that "the bulk of present styles of tribal arts in Africa reflects in more or less degenerate manner the art of the old empires" is astonishing, indeed. (Moreover, I do not believe that a "meaningful" history of African Negro arts can be written at the present.) Her question whether a given object belongs "to the be- ginning, the climax, or the end of the de- velopment of a particular style" seems to imply the assumption of periodicity and may lead to the construction of evolutionist sequences. I do not understand what artis- tic merit has to do with that. 3. The need for data about the maker or artist is emphasized by Haselberger. They might explain his or her motivation, social position, degree of specialization, training, and attitude toward his work and that of others; his psychology in relation to quan- titatively valid psychological studies among the rest of the community; the problem of individual creativity within traditional cul- tures. 4. The most dismaying challenge is to find a method of penetrating the terra in- cognita of problems dealing with the aes- thetic attitude of the people in relation to the polyvalence of artistic objects; form and intrinsic meaning; sources of value norms, locus of beauty. (See the pioneering effort of George Mills 1959.) 5. Extrinsic symbolic meaning and sub- ject matter. (Difficulties arise in the case of forms without overt, representational connota- tion.) Correlation of subject matter expressed visually with religious, mythical, legendary imagery could be worthwhile. (What is, and what is not represented?) Analysis might be guided by Panowsky (1955:26-54) whom I paraphrase: a) Primary subject matter. Identification of certain motifs as represen- tations of people or certain species of ani- mals, of tribal marks, dress, hairdo, ornaments, utensils, etc. b) Iconography. Description of certain elements as signs of status, sex, totems; of certain gestures or postures as conventionally significant; attri- butes, colors, configurations, compositions as symbols of specific personages or events. Iconography may be shifting or constant. Similar images may have dissimilar icono- graphic meaning and vice versa. It might depend on the context or the presence or absence of ritual during use or manufac- ture of the object. c) Iconology. Art interpreted as a symptom of something else (i.e., as a manifestation of underlying attitudes, values, philosophy, whicb are also expressed in other symptoms). This area is most apt to lead to speculations and generalizations ("ancestor figure," "to- temic-" or "mortuary carving," etc.). The prerequisite for iconology is familiarity with the people and all aspects of their cul- ture; it necessitates correlation of art with all other "symptoms," such as non-visual arts, religious concepts and practices, my- thology, social institutions, etc. New in- sights in primitive philosophy require redefining or abandonment of older terms such as animism (Fagg, 1955-56:54). 6. Data on artistic quality: qualitative uniformity or diversity of comparable ob- jects. Not only "masterpieces" should be considered. Comparison between the in- vestigator's judgment and that of the natives. Basis for art criticism which tran- scends the prejudices of our own world. 7. Data on "connoisseurship": criteria for attributions. Physical condition of the object in relation to climate, use, storage, exposure, properties of the material, sub- jection to sacrifices, anointing, repainting, etc. Data about the informants and inter- preter, about the relationship between investigator and informant and the time spent with them ought to be part of the record. One might inquire what "secret" objects mean to the non- initiate. One might expand a list of ideal goals of field work ad infinitum while one wonders how and where they could still be realized. The problem that remains is how to correlate and interpret the material from times and places beyond the reach of field work. Comprehension of artistic expressions of any alien culture remains an ideal beyond our reach. A prolonged stay with the people, the removal of lan- guage barriers, the wish to identify one- self with the people, and acceptance by them are among the prerequisites few researchers are able to fulfill. Nobody can argue with Haselberger: field work is the best, if not the only, way to come close to the goal, no matter how sensi- Vol. 2 No. 4 L October 1961 357</page><page sequence="18">tively and scholarly one might inter- pret collections and the literature. The need for field work and training for it is obvious, for special training in an- thropology, art history, and the psychol- ogy of art, as well as in the methods of psychological (analytical and experi- mental) research. I am not competent to judge the value for the study of art of the "type psychology" in which Haselberger be- lieves. Still, I should like to voice my scepticism about the reality of these types, and about the validity of efforts directed toward the establishing of cor- respondences between constitutional types and art as long as the relations between constitution and personality remain so problematical. Her state- ments relative to eidetic types are in- compatible with my ideas about image- making. [Los Angeles, 1.4.61] By EMMANUEL ANATI* I was very much interested by Hasel- berger's article, and think that it is a necessary start towards a systematiza- tion of study in a field in which there have been almost as many schools as scholars. Others will probably comment on the advantages and inadequacies of Haselberger's method for their own specific fields. I shall limit myself to a few remarks on details in which I am particularly concerned. Since terminology is mainly a means for mutual understanding, the term "ethnological art" is as good as any, so far as one knows what is meant by it. If I correctly interpret Haselberger's intentions, by "ethnological art" she means: the arts of human groups in Africa, America, Asia, Australia, and Oceania, that have not reached the cul- tural stage defined as "civilization" by the historico-archaeological school. If I am correct in this interpretation, the objection one could find to the term is that the arts of similar groups from Europe should be included under the same label. In my opinion, all the terms which are rejected by Haselberger, namely, primitive, tribal, traditional, native, indigenous, folk, and popular, are good terms for describing specific kinds of art, on condition that they are properly used. But each one of these terms means something different. Scholars interested in the tribal arts of Near Eastern Bedouins, the sha- manic arts of certain Siberian tribes, the folk arts of rural European or of Arctic regions, or the popular arts of countries like Sweden or Spain, will find that Haselberger's method is not always suited to their own needs. Some of these examples of "ethnological art" from Asia and Europe constitute one of the most important tools in the hands of the anthropologist for detecting de- tails of the mythology and the super- stitions of the people who made them. Frequently, however, the original pur- pose of these arts is unknown today to their makers, and the anthropologist is obliged to look back at the evolution and development of an object or a pat- tern in order to understand its mean- ing. Furthermore, prehistoric arts, in their various forms and regions of distribu- tion, do not seem to be included within "ethnological art." These again create another set of problems with which Haselberger does not deal. Since these arts were made by people who-though in most cases extinct-are "objects of anthropological study," they should fall within the scope of what the author calls "etl nological art." When dealing with livinig populations, or with human groups that have left behind historical records, art can usually be fitted into an economic, social, and ideological context. In the case of prehistoric art, the situation is exactly opposite, be- cause figurative art is frequently the main relic at the disposal of the anthro- pologist for reconstructing the econ- omy, the social structure, and the ideo- logical background of the artist. Thus, analysis tries to understand the artist from his art and not the other way around. In the case of prehistoric arts, with the exception of a few general rules of classification and analysis which have a universal value in the study of art, a rigid theoretical working scheme might frequently turn out to be inadequate. For each separate area or subject of study, workers must try to find a work- ing scheme in accordance with the data at their disposal and with the scope of the project they are undertaking. I am accustomed to calling whatever has a direct or indirect decorative or aes- thetic purpose, art. Thus I do not re- gard utilitarian objects or things as art in themselves. However, I consider their decorative or non-utilitarian parts to be art. If this approach is followed, architecture should not be considered art, just as tools and weapons are not regarded as such. A hut or a tool might, however, possess decorations or non- utilitarian parts which are to be con- sidered art. These different views on the definition of art might well be due to the substantial difference in the kinds of arts studied by Haselberger and by myself. African prehistoric art is still in a very incipient phase of research, and it is not yet clear which of the known art- groups is the oldest. Although nothing is known today about the absolute dat- ing of the early phases of South African rock pictures, various groups in this re- gion illustrate a way of life typical of the Old Stone Age, and some of them might turn out to be surprisingly an- cient. Whatever may be the case, most of the pictures belonging to the style of the "Archaic Hunters" of the Tassili show rather evolved characteristics, and are not likely to be older than the early realistic phase of rock engravings from Fezzan (Libya). Archaeological deposits at the base of rock pictures are not necessarily con- nected with the wall art, and might be either anterior or posterior to it. In the case of Mori's C-14 date, a subsequent question arises: if the material is con- temporary with the rock pictures, to which one of their phases and periods does it belong? Hence, one should not rely upon this dating to the extent of stating that "it enables us to demon- strate a continuity of Negro art styles for over 5,000 years." We do not yet know the precise dat- ing of the earliest "Palaeo-Negro" rock pictures from the Tassili, Fezzan, Hog- gar, Ennedi, Tanganyika, and South Africa. Some of these groups might go back several thousand years, but, with the doubtful exception of South Africa, in no place can a continuity with the Negro art of historic times be demon- strated. [Oxford, 9.3.61] By GILBERT ARCHEY* Haselberger's remark that the optical concept of form, that is, form seen at a distance, is not found among ethnolog- ical peoples immediately brings to mind the stone statues of Easter Island; also, from Maori art, the great palisade and gate-way statues, and compositions ad- mirably graded in strength and depth for further, nearer, and close view. I may not correctly construe her com- ment on frontality and space-depth, but it appears to indicate that frontality, while dominant in ethnological art, is the outcome of, for example, death- mask or ghost-mask representation rather than of definite intention to create a frontal aspect. In other words, we have here a question of aesthetic intention versus social purpose. The point is raised more directly by Haselberger's expressed view that "the ethnological artist is less concerned with the aesthetic-formal principles of the object he shapes than with its practical or religious purpose." She continues, "this subject needs further study which may produce unexpected results." With this last remark I agree, because I have observed, again in Maori art, the direct opposite to that which she suggests, and have myself been constrained to com- ment on a piece (Archey 1955: 8) and does it not appear that the carver of figure 6 was more concerned with creating a design appropriate to his long plank than with commemorating his ancestor. 358 CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY</page><page sequence="19">Haselberger: METHOD OF STUDYING ETHNOLOGICAL ART Haselberger is probably more con- cerned, however, to suggest that the ethnological artist is not consciously and academically aware of aesthetic- formal principles; and with this I would agree. Nevertheless we have to account for the fact that aesthetic-formal quali- ties are part of his achievement. Could it be that his art has emerged more freely, and was indeed the better for this very lack of academic conception? Von Kleist has somewhere warned con- temporary artists that "to be aware of our motives is to suffer loss of original- ity, clarity and vitality"; sensitivity, therefore, may manifest itself more readily as a natural talent than as an attitude subject to doctrine or canon; though I would not wish to suggest that its achievement is mere artlessness. The aspects of form which Hasel- berger directly suggests should be fol- lowed tend more towards determining the time and place of origin of a work, or the classificatory position of one art among others, than towards aesthetic comprehension. Such implied criticism is in a measure answered by the fact that, as we have seen, aesthetic ques- tions do arise from her essay. Yet, while the scope and procedure she suggests are thoroughly scientific and will un- doubtedly produce important results, we should still keep it in mind that art is not an ordinary natural phenom- enon; here we are not, as some physicist has said, "determining the recurrences of nature," but considering examples of individual human creative achievement and of individual human responses to it. These responses are part of the sub- ject matter of aesthetics, itself a scien- tific study for, as W. B. Smith (1945:87) has said, when analysing art we are not enjoying it. Aesthetics as a discipline is more commonly seen traversing the field of the arts of the civilizations, and the thought arises that it would find equally valuable material in the some- times more primitive expressions of ethnological art. As a corollary, ethno- logical art study might itself enquire into the significance for aesthetics, as well as for social anthropology, of the field of art it claims for review. [Auckland, 17.3.61] By T. BARROw* Haselberger's contribution is a val- uable one in so far as it draws attention to the great need for method in the study of ethnological arts, provides us with an interesting summary of knowl- edge on the subject, and also provides an excellent list of references. I shall restrict myself to a few critical com- ments with special reference to Oceania, and particularly to Polynesia as the area with which I am most familiar. It is difficult to associate tribal and tourist art in the South Seas, as the latter has reached such a point of decadence that there is no real relationship with the past. Surely it is generally true that tourist arts have little in common with the great traditions of the past. Today, Frenchmen in Papeete make "tradi- tional art" by copying traditional Mar- quesan methods and designs from books, and in New Zealand immigrant Europeans compete with a few Maori craftsmen and disabled servicemen in providing visitors to New Zealand with so-called "Maori art." Perhaps legiti- mate studies of tourist art may be made on Easter Island or Samoa, but in both cases it would be a study in decadence. Generally speaking, such studies would not in any way contribute to the knowl- edge of ancient arts of the past. If such terms as primitive, tribal, tra- ditional, native, indigenous, etc., are correctly used, they are quite satisfac- tory, regardless of their incorrect use by uninformed people. I believe Hasel- berger is inclined to depart from sim- plicity in language and to introduce new terms and words which in fact con- tribute to the specialist jargon that we wish to avoid. The question of aesthetic intention is a very difficult one, and the dogma that "art is involved only when the ac- tion produces results designed to affect someone, and is not, like play, an end in itself," is hardly followed in the light of our knowledge of Pacific arts. In fact, the magical significance of Pacific art is predominant, and the craftsman was one of the most important members of the community, enjoying the status of priest. The unerring aesthetic sense we observe in the primitive art of the Pa- cific is the result of exact training in an ancient tradition which believes that error will call down the vengeance of spirits. To the South Sea islander, the simplest motive might contain magical power, and the application of this de- sign to an object of every-day use, such as a paddle or fish hook, was able to in- crease the mana or effectiveness of the object. Haselberger in some respects is in- clined to interpret ethnological arts in terms of her own culture. Modern man is inclined to think designs are merely applied to make a thing more beautiful, but to a primitive man this was not always the case. Primitives are usually concerned with evoking magical aid, beauty being a by-product of which the traditional craftsman was more or less unconscious. Great art was also achieved in the Pacific without any se- rious intention. In some cases, the mere idle marking of a cave wall or pecking into stone or lava rock, in the Pacific at least, left us some aesthetically power- ful images. In Pacific arts, art for art's sake does not appear, but this by no means excludes an intensive apprecia- tion of the quality of work or work of unusual skill. Generally speaking, there was fair competition for the services of the best craftsmen, who received re- wards according to their ability. With reference to male and female types in artistic expression, I do not doubt that differences exist; but al- though New Zealand is cited as an area where male and female artistic styles are to be observed, this is certainly not the case. All sculptural arts were the prerogative of the male, to such an ex- tent that the female was not allowed near craftsmen at work as she was a destroyer of taboo. It appears to me that although a sound training in the method of study- ing ethnological art is highly desirable, it is not in itself adequate for the actual study of the art of a particular group. A long association with a single culture and a wide knowledge of its ethnology and archaeology is essential before one can seriously write on the particularly difficult aspect of art. In New Zealand I have met, over a number of years, visitors from overseas who descend on the country "to study Maori art." The results are usually negative. Area styles, range of media, succession and relation- ship of styles, etc., call for a very broad background. In Pacific art the subject matter is found in a vast army of gods, ancestral spirits, supernatural beings, animistic spirits, and numerous totemic creatures. Therefore the study of the art of these islands is largely a matter of the study of religious belief. The Polyne- sian craftsman-priest was in the first place engaged in the manufacture of human images to serve as a convenient abiding place for either god or ancestor. Birds, fishes, lizards, turtles, and dogs also found a place in the art of the re- gion. The austere and uncluttered ele- gance of Micronesian art springs largely from the limitations placed on the craftsman by the restricted environ- ment. In terms of Oceanic art itself, Micronesian style represents a blending of Polynesian, Melanesian, and Ma- layan elements, and therefore one must bring a very wide range of data to bear on the interpretation of a single arti- fact. I agree entirely with Haselberger that the primary need today is for detailed studies in ethnological art made with the help of exact methods, and I be- lieve that her article is a definite con- tribution to this end. [Wellington, 9.3.61] Vol. 2 No. 4 - October 1961 359</page><page sequence="20">By BEATRICE BLACKWOOD* This is an interesting and stimulating paper which should be welcomed by all field anthropologists, though some may see, in parts at least of it, a counsel of perfection which the circumstances of their own work would preclude them from following. The initial discussion on terminology tackles a problem which has troubled anthropologists for a long time. I agree entirely with what Haselberger says about the unsuitability of terms such as "tribal," "traditional," and particu- larly "primitive," which have been used, for want of better, to describe the kind of art in question and the people who produce it. Her suggestion "ethnolog- ical art" seems a very reasonable one; it is consistent with the current use of the word "ethnology," though not with its wider meaning. I can add a clear example of the existence of "art for art's sake" among ethnological peoples. The women pot- ters of the Bosmun, Lower Ramu River, New Guinea, frequently use any pieces of clay left over from making a batch of pots, to fashion little figures repre- senting men and women. They told me that these are made purely for pleasure, and are kept in the house to look at (Blackwood 1951:270). More stress might perhaps be laid on the fact that a large proportion of eth- nological art is "decorative art." In many instances this too could be looked upon as art for art's sake, since the ob- ject decorated would function equally well if left without decoration. To give one instance known to me: the Arawe of southwest New Britain paint quite elaborate designs, some more or less realistic, some conventionalized, some geometrical, on the blades of their canoe paddles. The makers or owners were able to give me the names of these pat- terns, and in many cases their origin; but in response to careful enquiries as to why they were used, I could discover no reason except that they improved the appearance of the paddles (unpub- lished material). I am not forgetting, however, that "decorative art" often serves purposes other than purely aes- thetic ones. It is often hard to deter- mine whether a given design, besides being decorative, has also an esoteric meaning, perhaps symbolic-witness the much discussed, and, so far as I know, yet unresolved, question as to how much, if any, significance is to be at- tached to the frequent use of designs connected with clouds, rain, etc. on the pottery of the Pueblo Indians. In other cases, designs, in themselves decorative, may be intended primarily to serve as owners' marks. This appears to be the purpose of the linear patterns cut at the nodes of cane arrow-shafts by the Kuku- kuku of the mountains of southeastern New Guinea, a people in whose culture art of any kind finds very little place (Blackwood 1950:44). The interpretation of content may be complicated by the fact that different individuals may give entirely different or contradictory explanations of the ob- ject or design being investigated. Again, changes introduced unintentionally, by successive copying or by working from memory, each probably minute but add- ing up to something very considerable, may modify the interpretation of con- tent to a surprising degree. This is very well brought out in a valuable little book by H. Balfour (1893:23-31). In her statement that entirely differ- ent starting points can lead to very similar forms Haselberger has made an important point that is too often for- gotten, with the result that "conver- gence" is confused with or mistaken for "evolution." More stress might well have been laid on this aspect of the subject. While considering the relation of the artistic form to its material (Harmony with the Material, Independence of the Material), one might add a third possi- bility: "Modification of the artistic form imposed by the material." This is dis- cussed by Balfour (1893:116-26) and illustrated by reference to the animal, reptile, and bird forms portrayed in basketry by the Indians of British Guiana. I agree that the "purpose-bound" character often ascribed to ethnological art is an exaggeration, and that there are frequent indications in ethnological societies of the existence of a well- developed sense of beauty. I would add that this sense of beauty may be alto- gether different from that of the investi- gator, or from anything recognized as such in his own culture. The paragraphs on the artist's biog- raphy seem to presuppose a class of pro- fessional artists. In many ethnological societies no such class exists or is pos- sible, but the creators of objects which anyone carrying out such an investiga- tion as is here envisaged would have to take into account are ordinary mem- bers of the community, sharing in its general activities, and making in the course of their every-day work articles for their own use or amusement and that of their immediate family. In some societies, however, an individual may become known in his community for excellent work of some particular kind, and may be asked to produce articles for a wider circle, which could be the first stage towards becoming a profes- sional. An enquiry into whether-and if so, how far-the artist is such by pro- fessionl might be added to the subjects suggested for investigation under this head. I am not qualified to comment on the psychological portion of Haselberger's paper, but I think that some of the sug- gestions made in this section would be very difficult to put into practice, to any useful purpose, in many societies, such as, for example, the Melanesian groups of which I have personal knowledge. Haselberger's statement that the pro- duction of art among primitive people is largely in the hands of women is too wide a generalization; and would not apply, for example, to Melanesia, where the production of objects intended for religious or ceremonial purposes-a con- siderable proportion of the art-is largely if not entirely in the hands of men. Apart from such special objects, the craft of working in wood, in Mela- nesia one of the most important media, is confined to men. Even pottery-making is men's work in some groups. This is not to deny the importance of differ- ences in male and female art; but it should be borne in mind that such dif- ferences may spring from differences in purpose and/or medium rather than from those which have a sexual-psycho- logical basis. It seems to me that one of the great- est difficulties inherent in studies such as that dealt with in this paper is that they are very apt to take on a subjective character. Interpretations and classifications vary with the period, and with the per- sonality and training of the individual investigator, but facts, accurately re- corded and carefully authenticated, will always retain their value. I would lay the strongest possible emphasis on one sentence in Haselberger's conclud- ing paragraph: "The primary need to- day is detailed studies made with the help of exact methods," with an added caution not to allow method to become master. [Oxford, 1.3.61] By INGEBORG BOLZ* The title of Haselberger's article does not correspond with much of its con- tent. Although she deals extensively with the history of the study of ethno- logical art, many of her details would more concern the work of the sociol- ogist, for it is his task to find out, with his methods, the conditions under which the unknown artist is working. To study art wherever it is produced is a field where one can work with success only when using the methods and terms of art history. These are so little known in the field of ethnographical art that it is symptomatic to find a superabundance of books dealing, for example, with the art of all Negro Africa. Besides the more or less unscien- tific ideas of the various authors, one 360 CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY</page><page sequence="21">Haselber,aer : METHOD OF STUDYING ETHNOLOGICAL ART will find in these books repeated refer- ence to the same tribes; even the same specimens are illustrated, and of course the same errors are repeated. Of course we must not neglect field work, or rather, the collecting of art, with exact data about where the item was obtained, for what purpose it was made, and by whom. But what we need first is an extensive catalogue, and de- tailed studies of all tribes. And this work can be initiated only from the museums and private collections. We need publications, from public as well as private collections, that will help us to make clearer distinctions between the various styles. Art "history" can be done, too, in the field of ethnological art, though we will not be able to reconstruct the exact changes of the style of a tribe living in the tropical forests and mostly using wood in its works. One factor that can be of some assistance here in discerning some changes of the forms is the fact that in ethnological art, more than in other arts, older and newer types are made at the same time. Art history also means that the scholar has enough materials to make satisfactory comparative studies. This will make clear how far types and forms can diffuse without the tribe itself mi- grating. One should always take into consideration a phrase of Denise Paul- me's: "La forme voyage seule." This means that masks and statues can be taken over by a distant tribe without its taking over the ritual in which the masks were used. Many examples can be given. On the other hand, a religious ceremony can be performed with masks and costumes already used in another cult, even of the same tribe. These facts, besides many others, give us the right to lay greatest stress on the study of the various form-elements. Style criticism should be the very first step for every scholar working in the field of ethnological art. I should like to add the voice of an African artist which shows how much nonsense has been included in interpretation, espe- cially of Negro art. Mr. Enwowu writes (criticizing a book by Underwood): one comes across certain anthropological errors such as that the figures express the ideals and the ideas of the spirit world. On the contrary, the group-religious concepts were impregnated in the figures. And he later states: The art-schools of West Africa, if any, were not the secret societies, but the carvers' sheds or workshops. My father was a sculptor, and although I certainly did not learn the art before I became an ini- tiate in the Mmvo society, it was in his shop that I learned the art of wood carving. [Cologne, 27.3.6 1] By EDMUND CARPENTER* 1. Let me discuss two aspects of this field which Haselberger's paper does not touch upon, or at least does not em- phasize. Certain statements in her paper I found exciting; others, especially those dealing with "constitutional types" and "eidetic type," I thought questionable; but I limit my remarks to a considera- tion of the artistic act and the acoustic structuring of space, with illustrations of both from the Arctic. 2. Nowhere is life more difficult than in the Arctic, yet when life there is re- duced to its barest essentials, art and poetry turn out to be among those es- sentials. Art to the Eskimo is far more than just an object: it is an act of seeing and expressing life's values; it is a ritual of discovery by which patterns of na- ture, and of human nature, are revealed by man. As the carver holds the unworked ivory lightly in his hand, turning it this way and that, he whispers, "Who are you? Who hides there?" And then: "Ah, Seal!" He rarely sets out, at least consciously, to carve, say, a seal, but picks up the ivory, examines it to find its hidden form and, if that is not im- mediately apparent, carves aimlessly until he sees it, humming or chanting as he works. Then he brings it out: Seal, hidden, emerges. It was always there: he didn't create it; he released it; he helped it step forth. What emerges from the ivory, or more accurately from the artistic act, is not simply a carving of a seal, but an act which explicates, with beauty and simplicity, the meaning of life to the Eskimo. Let me illustrate from personal fieldwork and from an exceptionally brilliant manuscript, Freedom, Being, and Necessity by Paul Riesman: In the Eskimo language little dis- tinction is made between "nouns" and "verbs," but rather all words are forms of the verb "to be" which itself is lack- ing in Eskimo. That is, all words pro- claim in themselves their own existence. Eskimo is not a nominal language; it doesn't simply name things which al- ready exist, but rather brings both things and actions (nouns and verbs) into being as it goes along. This idea is reflected in the practice of naming a child at birth: when the mother is in labor, an old woman stands around and says as many different eligible names as she can think of. The child comes out of the womb when its own name is called. Thus the naming and the giving birth to the new thing are inextricably bound together. The environment encourages the Eskimo to think in this fashion. To Western minds, the "monotony" of snow, ice, and darkness can often be depressing, even frightening. Nothing in particular stands out; there is no scenery in the sense in which we use the term. But the Eskimo do not see it this way. They are not interested in scenery, but in action, existence. This is true to some extent of many people, but is almost of necessity true for the Eskimo, for nothing in their world easily defines itself and is separable from the general background. What exists, the Eskimo themselves must struggle to bring into existence. Theirs is a world which has to be conquered with each act and statement, each carv- ing and song-but which, with each act accomplished, is as quickly lost. The secret of conquering a world greater than himself is not known to the Es- kimo. But his role is not passive. Man is the force that reveals form. He is the force which ultimately cancels nothing- ness. Language is the principal tool with which Eskimo make the natural world a human world. They use many "words" for snow which permit fine distinctions, not simply because they are much con- cerned with snow, but because snow takes its form from the actions in which it participates: sledding, falling, igloo- building, blowing. These distinctions are possible only when experienced in a meaningful context. Different kinds of snow are brought into existence by the Eskimo as they experience their environment and speak; the words do not label something already there. Words, for the Eskimo, are like the knife of the carver: they free the idea, the thing, from the general formless- ness of the outside. As a man speaks, not only is his language in statu nas- cendi, but also the very thing about which he is talking. The carver, like the poet, releases form from the bonds of formlessness: he brings it forth into consciousness. He must reveal form in order to protest against a universe that is formless, and the form he reveals should be beautiful. Since that form participates in a real situation, the carving is generally utili- tarian. One very characteristic Eskimo expression means "What is that for?" It is most frequently used by an Eskimo when he finds some object and stands looking down at it. It does not mean "What can I use that for?" but rather something closer to "What is it in- tended to be used for?" That portion of the antler, whose shape so perfectly fits the hand and gives a natural strength as well, becomes, with slight modification, a chisel handle. Form and function, revealed together, are insep- Vol. 2 No. 4 - October 1961 361</page><page sequence="22">arable. Add a few lines of dots or tiny rings or just incisions, rhythmically ar- ranged to bring out the form, and it's finished. Here, then, is a world of chaos and chance, a meaningless whirl of cold and white; man alone can give meaning to this-its form does not come ready- made. When spring comes and igloos melt, the old habitation sites are littered with waste, including beautifully-designed tools and tiny ivory carvings, not de- liberately thrown away, but, with even greater indifference, just lost. Eskimo are interested in the artistic act, not in the product of that activity. A carving, like a song, is not a thing; it is an action. When you feel a song within you, you sing it; when you sense a form emerging from ivory, you release it. It's senseless to assume that when we collect these silent, static carvings, we have collected Eskimo art, even if we record date and provenience. Measurements of size, dia- grams of diffusion, and seriation studies of chronology do nothing to correct the initial error here. However, the ap- proach I have recommended is gener- ally called "mystical" or "subjective" or "insight without method," while this latter method is called "objective" or "scientific." That competent fieldwork should be called "mystical" and incom- petent fieldwork called "scientific" is one of the more remarkable features of our profession. 3. "It's the power of belief," writes Rainey (1959:13), "which makes all the difference between original native art and contemporary native souvenirs." This difference becomes most apparent when we study the artistic act, rather than just the artistic object. Haselberger refers to Schaeffer-Simmern's Eskimo plastik aus Kanada but fails to note that the souvenir art which this volume describes is strictly post-1948, Western- designed, Western-valued, and some of it Hong Kong-made. There's a differ- ence between the carver who would stop carving tomorrow if the market failed, and the carver for whom art is a necessary part of being human. I think it's important that we system- atically collect and document sou- venir art, but I have no time for the Winnie the Pooh nonsense which is written about most of it. A Canadian official recently stated that "contempo- rary Eskimo prints are related to the Paleolithic art of Altamira and Las- caux" and from another authority we are advised that contemporary Alaskan carvers "still use the basic principles . . . of the ancient master engravers who produced the 'Okvik Madonna'." A serious study of Canadian Eskimo souvenir art would tell us much about the modern Eskimo. It would note that art is now a thing, an object, no longer an act, a ritual; that most pieces are now characterized by a base, a favored point of view, three-dimensional per- spective, etc., all of which reflect grow- ing individualism, an aggressive self- concept that seeks to possess and control the external world, in contrast to the traditional, aboriginal techniques of multiple perspective, visual puns, three-dimensional x-ray or openwork sculpture, etc., which reflect a less as- sertive, less individualistic self-concept. A serious study would also include de- tails of the Department of Northern Affairs and National Resources' strong opposition to any study of, and publi- city on, aboriginal Eskimo art-an op- position that does not stem from any fear that such studies would diminish souvenir sales, but lies in the fact that the stone carvings are taken by many as evidence of government respect for, and encouragement of, aboriginal Eskimo culture. This might lead to the ques- tion: How closely does this propaganda coincide with reality? This in turn will immediately open unexpected aper- tures, vistas, break-throughs-especially in the field of finance, or the fact that Canadian anthropologists-apologists in- volved in this situation are as contented as Coolidge in the Harding cabinet- but you're laughing, aren't you? You're laughing at the notion of art as some- thing more than a kewpie nude with a clock in her belly on the television set. The best story I know about souvenir art (I offer it free to any television script-writer) concerns a friend of mine who accepted a position as a junior curator-collector with an African mu- seum. He liked the town, but not his English school-tie superior; and so at the end of his three-year tour, he de- cided to remain there but to go into the mask business. Now the aboriginal masks from that area are rare, costly, heavy, and too grotesque to be accept- able as decor in Levittown. So he de- signed his own mask. It bore no resem- blance to any known mask, but was eminently suitable for the market; and moreover was of light wood and shal- low, so one could be packed inside an- other, like Chinese boxes, and shipped at a minimum cost. He employed a large crew, power equipment, and assembly-line methods: masks were dipped, branded, etc. Tens of thou- sands were sold to interior decorators and museum sales desks. While touring America gathering orders, he also gath- ered, from the Salvation Army and from tie manufacturers, 22,000 used or remaindered ties, all resembling English school-ties, which he shipped as gifts to) the more impoverished members of this African town. 4. Often we can! better unde:rstande an art form when we see what happens to it in translation, when, say, in the interplay of cultures, an old art is ex- pressed in a new medium. Thus photo- graphs of minute Dorset carvings reveal that all share a quality of sizelessness: each can be blown up to monumental size with no qualitative change of effect, for the artists reduced each form to its basic essentials. The tension and beauty which a rain- drop possesses just before it falls, and loses when it does fall, was captured by the artists of the steppes who drew, separately or closely locked in combat, "armored" animals: poised, each with suggestions of power about to burst forth, but not yet in operation. Re- cently, Soviet film-makers employed this art in an animated fairy tale. Still scenes were superb, but when the fig- ures moved, the art was destroyed. Sketches made by Eskimo on two- dimensional surfaces, however, can be animated without violation. This dif- ference in adaptation offers a clue to a major difference between Okvik-Ipiu- tak art and that of the Eskimo. 5. I do not think it accidental that it is in Paul Klee's work that we see the closest parallels with Eskimo art, for in both there is a structuring of space by sound. Klee was the son of a music teacher and himself so good a musician he had difficulty deciding whether to devote his life to music or painting. He said his works owed more to Bach and Mozart than to any of the masters of art. He wanted art "to sound like a fairy tale," to be a world in which "things fall upward." He was bewitched by the dreamlike universe underwater, the aquarium in which fish and flora moved like phantoms through lyrical light. We often have difficulty in under- standing a purely verbal notion. In Alice in Wonderland ". . . the patriotic archbishop of Canterbury found it ad- visable-." "Found what?" said the Duck. "Found it," the Mouse replied rather crossly: "of course you know what 'it' means." "I know what 'it' means well enough when I find a thing," said the Duck: "it's generally a frog, or a worm. The question is, what did the archbishop find?" We feel happier when it is visible; then we feel we can understand it, judge it, perhaps control it. In our workaday world, space is conceived in terms of that which separates visible objects. "Empty space" suggests a field in which there is nothing to see. We call a fume-filled gasoline drum or a gale- swept tundra "empty" because nothing is visible in either case. The Eskimo do not think this way. One hunter I knew, when assured by a 362 CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY</page><page sequence="23">Haselberger: METHOD OF STUDYING ETHNOLOGICAL ART White man that a gasoline drum was "empty," struck a match and peered inside: he bore the scars for life. With them the binding power of the oral tradition is so strong as to make the eye subservient to the ear. They de- fine space more by sound than sight. Where we might say, "Let's see what we can hear," they would say, "Let's hear what we can see." In the beginning was the Word, a spoken word, not the visual one of liter- ate man, but a word which, when spoken, revealed form: "And God said, Let there be light: and there was light." The Eskimo speaker imposes his will diffidently upon unbounded reality. Form is temporary, transient; it exists, as the Eskimo poet says, ". . . on the threshold of my tongue." Nothing has a definite, invariable shape. In our society, however, to be real a thing must be visible, and preferably constant. We trust the eye, not the ear. Not since Aristotle assured his readers that the sense of sight was "above all others" the one to be trusted, have we accorded to sound the role of dominant sense. "Seeing is believing." "Believe half of what you see, nothing of what you hear." "The eyes of the Lord pre- serve knowledge, and he over-throweth the words of the transgressor" (Prov- erbs 22:12). Truth, we think, must be observed by the eye, then judged by the "I". Mysticism, intuition, are bad words among scientists. Most of our thinking is done in terms of visual models, even when an auditory one might prove more efficient. We employ spatial metaphor even for such inner psychological states as tendency, dura- tion, intensity. We say "thereafter," not the more logical "thenafter"; "always" means "at all times"; "before" means etymologically "in front of"; we even speak of a "space" or an "interval" of time. To the Eskimo, truth is given through oral tradition, mysticism, intuition, all cognition; not simply by observation and measurement of physical phenom- ena. To them, the ocularly visible ap- parition is not nearly as important as the purely auditory one. The essential feature of sound is not its location, but that it be, that it fill space. We say "the night shall be filled with music," just as the air is filled with fragrance; locality is irrelevant. The concert-goer closes his eyes. Auditory space has no favored focus. It is a sphere without fixed boundaries, space made by the thing itself, not space containing the thing. It is not pictorial space, boxed-in, but dynamic, always in flux, creating its own dimensions moment by moment. It has no fixed boundaries; it is indifferent to back- ground. The eye focuses, pinpoints, ab- stracts, locating each object in physical space, against a background; the ear, however, favors sound from any direc- tion. I know of no example of an Eskimo describing space primarily in visual terms. They do not regard space as static, and therefore measurable: hence they have no formal units of spatial measurement, just as they have no uni- form divisions of time. The carver is indifferent to the demands of the opti- cal eye: he lets each piece fill its own space, create its own world, without reference to background or anything external to it. Each carving lives in spa- tial independence. Size and shape, pro- portions and selection, these are set by the object itself, not forced from with- out. Like sound, each carving creates its own space, its own identity; it imposes its own assumptions. Superb examples of this are the great Alaskan Eskimo mobile-like masks in the Heye Research Center. Such masks were not the result of lack of large pieces of wood, but a deliberate effort to let the mask assert its own dimen- sions. This is in contrast to Northwest Coast Indian carvers who worked within enclosed space. Other features of Eskimo art, alien and puzzling to us, become comprehen- sible if we recognize that the ear to them is the primary sense; it imposes its bias over all other senses. Take an obvious example: lack of verticality. The value we place on verticality (it even influences our perception) stems from the strength of literacy in our lives. Children must be taught it. Na- tives do not know it. And when the mentally ill in our society withdraw from the burdens of literate values, and return to non-vertical, non-lineal codi- fications, we call them child-like, and even note parallels with primitives. To lack of verticality can be added multiple perspective, visual puns, X-ray sculp- ture, absence of background, and cor- respondence between symbol and size: all examples of non-visual structuring of space. Models in the social sciences come, without exception, from the world of literacy. That Joyce, Pound, and Klee offered models, based on the electronic media and sharing much with oral cul- ture, that are applicable to pre-literate data and relevant to a contemporary audience, has escaped anthropologists. The natural sciences, however, and even certain of the humanities, decades ago turned to post-literate models and found them fruitful. 6. The only persistent archetypes may prove to be those formed by the interplay of the senses themselves, as in the case outlined above. The inter- play of cultures does not produce per- sistent archetypes. The electronic media, regarded as extensions of our senses, can, in their interplay, have archetypal results. As cultural forms they can provide interplay with other whole-cultures. Most studies of arche- types are limited to the archetypes aris- ing from the interplay of the private senses, and thus break down completely when confronted with the interplay of cultures. [Northridge, California, 21.3.61] By ADR. G. CLAERHOUT* Not yet being familiar with the purely theoretical aspects of methods of studying "ethnological art," I wish to abstain from over-all comment on Haselberger's praiseworthy attempt in this matter. I also abstain from com- ment on the author's views about field investigations, in which I lack experi- ence-although we should not forget that museum work on "ethnological art" is a kind of field work, too! Thus, the following comments contain only a few criticisms and marginal remarks. 1. My first comment concerns the term "ethnological art." a) Is there a real need hic et nunc to look for a new working-term-the more so as fHaselberger herself expects that "ethnological art" may be abandoned once there is a more appropriate stylis- tic classification. I propose to keep the term generally used now, and wait for a more appropriate and definite one without hunting for a temporary term in between. b) Nevertheless, I would make use of this opportunity to say that I disagree formally with "ethnological." Of course, once the conventions are unanimously agreed upon, the term fits the area under discussion; but it neither de- scribes, defines, nor characterizes it. Furthermore, although unfamiliar with the English language, I have the impres- sion that something in this term is wrong, linguistically speaking; at any rate, I believe that none of our Dutch- speaking colleagues is disposed to accept the term ethnologische kunst, let alone volkenkundige kunst, for simple reasons of linguistic feeling; and I can hardly imagine that our colleagues in France would agree with art ethnologique (all of this is with the supposition that the term "ethnology" is not replaced by the term "cultural anthropology"). c) I would also take this occasion to disagree with Haselberger and with Ger- brands about the association they think is made between the term "tribal" and the concept of backwardness. This is in complete contradiction to the feeling of Vol. 2 No. 4 * October 1961 363</page><page sequence="24">most of the "ethnological peoples" themselves, as has been illustrated for years in Maori life, for example, and is also illustrated in our time by the re- vival of tribal consciousness. We have to respect the feelings of those peoples! d) Why should we prefer a term with- out any symbolic meaning? Should we have to change the term "classical an- tiquity"? e) I am afraid that it will be impossi- ble to formulate an accurate term by means of a more appropriate stylistic classification, this norm being insuffi- cient for this purpose. f) If a new temporary working-term should be necessary, I then suggest "Non-European tribal art." 2. Indeed, "tourist art" should not be neglected in this field of study, at least within certain limits. But then we should not forget that the art products which have been called "academic" also have to be studied by art historians; the more so as trade is certainly not the main object in contemporary Balinese sculpture, modern paintings of Congo- lese artists, or the textile art in the state of Bombay revived under the auspices of the public authorities. 3. Haselberger points out that com- parative study of "ethnological architec- ture" can only be successful when based on architectural (meaning technical? on scale?) drawings. I wish to complete this opinion through my own museum expe- rience, adding that students in the his- tory of art should be trained in drawing tout court, both artistic and technical. The same for ethnographers, who should also be trained in the techniques of photography, music-recording, and dance-notation. 4. As Haselberger undoubtedly knows, there are other elements besides the date of acquisition and photograph- ing that offer possibilities of establishing a terminus ante quem: The changing of the shape of a head dress as a result of an acculturation process for instance; or the self-disbanding or interdiction of a secret society, which may provide a stylistic terminus ante quem for certain sculpture. Another instance is the Ryamba-cult, among the Bena-Lulua, which ordered the destruction of the ancestor cult, and consequently of all the existing ancestor figurines, while prohibiting the manufacture of new ones; if its instructions had been ob- served rigourously, the date of spread of the cult should have been a magnificent terminus ante quem in the matter. 5. I do not understand why a distinc- tion is to be made between form and structure in the study of an art object, nor why form as a sub-element of struc- ture is different from the first-men- tioned outward form. The material and the tools, to a certain degree, determine technique and structure possibilities, and form is that which it was possible to create within the limits of those struc- tural possibilities. All of this can be de- fined by a single term: morphology. 6. I agree with Haselberger that style comparisons must draw upon similar ob- jects. Indeed, mask style and figure style in African art are really two distinct things. But Yoruba wooden figures, for instance, need to be compared with the bronze Ita Yemoo figures from Ife (Man, November 1953: 189) and also with the stone heads from Esie (Man, March 1959: 41). "Similar" should refer to the kind of object, rather than to the kind of material. 7. That comparative study of "ethno- logical art" will have to use ideal types of opposite pairs of formal characteris- tics seems to be a fundamental point in the author's demonstration. Is this not putting the cart before the horse? We have to gather the art objects; to study them with the appropriate stylistic cri- teria; then to determine the style char- acteristics of each group-which may be chronological, geographical, tribal, so- cial, functional, or material; and finally to determine evolutions and interac- tions. One cannot predict whether this will or will not lead to the discovery of opposite pairs of formal style principles. And in the meantime, in the state of affairs hic et nunc, this kind of discovery is a loss of time and of no practical help whatsoever. These are rather hard words, but it is my conviction that they correspond to the present and real needs of the study of "ethnological art." [Antwerp, 24.3.61] By BERNARD FAGG* The very full and useful discussion on the most appropriate term to de- scribe "ethnological" art hardly re- solves the dilemma, and it is to be hoped that the time is not too far dis- tant when the most accurate term ("tri- bal" seems to me to be the most appro- priate) can again be used in popular or semi-popular literature without giving offence. For at the present time even Nigerian intellectuals who are com- pletely objective in their outlook, and would agree that the term "tribal" is the most appropriate word, would pre- fer not to see it used outside purely academic literature because of the emo- tional reactions, however illogical they may be, which the use of the word is likely to arouse. 1. One of the present inadequacies in the study of tribal art, the neglect of the detailed study of traditional archi- tecture, which is so poorly represented in the literature, is well on the way to rectification in respect of Nigeria, where the Department of Antiquities has since the beginning of 1958 em- ployed on its staff an architect, Mr. Z. R. Dmochowski, who has a wide prac- tical knowledge of folk architecture in Eastern Europe. Mr. Dmochowski is studying architecture in all its aspects- sociological, ethnographic, technolog- ical, and artistic-throughout Nigeria. His interests are by no means confined to ethnological, economic, or sociolog- ical studies, and he is constantly notic- ing unexpected subtlety of design and basic artistic conception of form and space in building. The study of im- movable mud sculpture, necessarily neglected by most art historians, also receives detailed attention from Mr. Dmochowski. Innumerable traditional architect- builders still execute buildings and ar- range compound and village plans in the traditional idiom, though change is, of course, taking place very rapidly. In many places where 10 years ago whole compounds were built in the tradi- tional style, mud-block construction has completely supplanted the old methods of hand-building for everything except the beautiful and functional granaries. For the biggest of these, the strength of hand-building is realised to be incom- parably more suitable for resisting the bursting load of several tons of grain. By the use of traditional architectural forms and materials in new buildings, and by the careful maintenance of old mud buildings (of which at least one is known to have had nothing but super- ficial maintenance during the last hundred years), the Federal Depart- ment of Antiquities is attempting to show that some of the despised ma- terials and methods are in certain re- spects better and still infinitely cheaper than the ubiquitous sandcrete block construction. 2. The possibility of obtaining biog- raphies of artists is not so rare in West Africa as Haselberger suggests. There are still very many practising sculptors in Nigeria (where it is not yet true to say that painting now best represents the artistic abilities of the African Negro). 3. There are encouraging signs in Nigeria that a limited official patronage of sculpture is growing up for the decoration of public buildings which, contrasting with the uncritical patron- age of tourists, may perhaps bring a new possibility of livelihood for tradi- tional craftsmen. 4. The Nok Culture (so-called after the village where the first terra-cotta figurine of this culture was discover-d) is not, contrary to the author's state- ment, represented in European mu- seums by a considerable amount of pot- tery, though it will, it is hoped, soon be possible to supply replicas in terra cotta for overseas museums. The entire 364 CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY</page><page sequence="25">Haselberger: METHOD OF STUDYING ETHNOLOGICAL ART corpus of Nok sculpture, with one tri- fling exception, is confined to the mu- seums at Jos, Lagos, and Ife, having been excavated by the Department of Antiquities, or presented to the Jos Museum over the past 17 years by public-spirited mining engineers. Nat- uralism in the human form, which is the subject of the bulk of the specimens so far discovered, is extremely rare (though significantly not absent), though a quasi-naturalism is more com- mon in the animal figures. The Nok Culture is now thought to be a product of the revolution brought about by the introduction of iron and probably flourished between about 400 B.C. (probably not as early as 900 B.C.) and A.D. 200. That Nok sculpture was in some way ancestral to the art of Ife and Benin becomes more and more probable as further evidence comes to light. [Jos, Nigeria, 13.3.61] By WILLIAM FAGG* I am grateful for the invitation to comment on this interesting article. Haselberger is to be congratulated on her valiant attempt to codify the pres- ent practice, and aspirations, of anthro- pologists who study art. If some such students should feel that much space has been used in the elaboration of ob- vious considerations of common sense, let them remember that this valuable faculty still deserts many of us from time to time in the field, and that many for whose work art studies are only marginal may be glad of the formula- tion. I have reservations, however, on a few points and will deal with them in their order of occurrence. The first and no doubt the most seri- ous is a strong objection to the term "ethnological art" in the title. I am sorry to cross swords with my friends Gerbrands and Haselberger over this, but it cannot possibly be accepted, whether from the logical, linguistic, scientific, or even political point of view. First, if the term "ethnological peoples" has any meaning at all, it means peoples who study ethnology rather than the subjects of it. (As well apply the term "psychoanalytical art" to the works of the mentally unbal- anced.) But in fact it has no meaning, for all peoples without exception are proper subjects of ethnological study (Haselberger herself draws examples impartially from Europe and the tribal world); it has been recognized from the very beginnings of ethnology and an- thropology that a concentration of ef- fort on the "primitive" peoples is a temporary phenomenon due to the facts that their traditional cultures are doomed by the onset of civilization, and that techniques to deal with the simpler cultures can conveniently be developed before those for the more complex. Any restriction of the acknowledged scope of ethnology for the sake of a minor ad- vantage (even if it were a real one) would be a grave disservice to our sci- ence. The political argument offered in support of "ethnological art," viz. that it is not associated with "backward- ness," is of course entireli illusory: it will not take the "backward peoples" long to discover that it has exactly the same meaning as the other words; in- deed they need not look beyond the end of this article, where they will find that the correlative of "ethnological" is "sophisticated." But in truth, while it may be right in journalism to pander to the inferiority complexes of the im- mature individuals among the formerly "backward" peoples by accepting and afterwards dutifully rejecting an infi- nite regression of shibboleths, it is surely not right in science; nor is it a compliment to the intelligence of our African and other friends. Even "primi- tive" is not to be rejected primarily for this reason, but rather because of its vagueness and ambiguity. What we need is a term conforming as closely as possible to the ethnologi- cal reality. I have for at least the past 14 years sought diligently for a better and more accurate word than "tribal," but have found none. Equally have I sought and not found any valid objec- tion to this word, and certainly neither Gerbrands nor Haselberger has pro- duced any. (I think, though, that I have hit upon the real, if unexpressed, cause of their unease with it: it seems that "tribal art" cannot be translated into the Germanic languages. But this is no reason why English should deny itself.) "Traditional" is doubtless the next best word, and "Nigerian tradi- tional art" is recognizable enough; but it is greatly inferior to "tribal" in that it loses most of its meaning when used as a generic term, and is then nearly as illogical as "native" or "indigenous." I would add in passing that any term wide enough to comnprehend "tourist art" as well as tribal art is too wide to be of any practical use. The two things are absolutely different in kind, the former phrase being almost a contradic- tion in terms because, being "other- directed," this is not really art at all. (I have, perhaps a little whimsically, re- ferred to the Afro-Portuguese ivories of the 16th century as "tourist art," but the patronage involved in this was of a very different order from that of the bazaar goods of this century, and I com- pared them only in order to contrast the measure of artistic success which they achieved.) A minor point under "Detailed Study of a Work of Art" is that the wooden statues of Bushongo or Bakuba kings are hardly more readily datable than other African woodcarvings, except for the statues made in the last 70 years; the traditional dates and attributions of the older ones are not necessarily re- liable. Under "Criteria for Classification: Purpose," I think that "(7) Art for art's sake" exemplifies (following Him- melheber) a long-standing fallacy about tribal art-that it can be divided into works of purely ritual or other utili- tarian purpose and those-a small and anomalous group-of purely aesthetic purpose. In fact all tribal art (like all true art anywhere) has an artistic pur- pose in that the artist intends to make it beautiful, but at the same time it is always an expression of belief, art and belief being for any true artist in- separable and coterminous; only when their unity is undermined by intellec- tualization or aestheticism does the con- cept of "art for art's sake" begin to have any meaning, and this never happens in tribal art-indeed, it may mark the end of it. In the case reported by Himmel- heber, several other explanations are in fact possible (e.g. that the carvings have the same purpose as the bronze plaques of Benin-conspicuous consumption), but it is improbable that any one of them is by itself correct. Since tribal art is essentially an art of synthesis, not of analysis, it is usually misleading and unprofitable to try to compartmental- ize the artist's motives. A few paragraphs later, under "Form," Haselberger suggests that "the style of an art work is best grasped through description." However, all visual art, and pre-eminently tribal art, is concerned with the communication of the ineffable (when it is not, it is open to the criticism of being "liter- ary"); and it follows that its essential nature cannot be conveyed through ver- bal description, although its superficial formal characters may be. The ethnolo- gist who proposes to study tribal art must recognize the obligation to ac- quire the same skills as the European art historian, the ability to recognize the style of a painter or a school in- stantaneously, coupled of course with the ability to support his opinion by stylistic analysis and argument. Such skills he can acquire only by seeing and handling large numbers of works of art (and reproductions thereof). He must train his mind to be a kind of touchstone of style, and must recognize that his judgments will often have to be sustained, not by scientific proofs, but by the approval of his fellows. The analytical method is indeed valuable, Vol. 2 * No. 4 * October 1961 365</page><page sequence="26">but it must not be regarded as para- mount or self-sufficient. I should be guilty of le trahison des clercs if I did not here object, distaste- ful though it is, to the inclusion of Segy among serious authorities on style in tribal art, especially in view of the ex- cessive variability (to speak as kindly as possible) of his illustrative material. As to the concepts Frontality and Space-Depth, I think that these are chiefly useful in tribal art in assessing the merits of sculptures and their art- ists, those round sculptures whose in- terest resides only in the front view being generally the work of poor artists (including the ungifted sons of great masters). I would remark in passing that artists do not observe laws, of frontality or anything else; the "laws," like the rules of prosody, are derived from works of art by the "schoolmen." Under "Cultural Context" Hasel- berger suggests that we should ask whether a work belongs to the begin- ning, the climax, or the end of develop- ment of a style. With the exception of the Benin court style, however, we must not expect tribal art to run in cycles similar to those which we can discern in European art. Owing partly to the lack of a unified artistic tradition like that of Europe; partly to the appren- ticeship system, operating largely on a hereditary basis; and partly to the ex- treme perishability of the materials, there is a constant ebb and flow of style and quality; and it is improbable that any cyclical development that might be inferred from a given group of works of art could ever be shown to be appli- cable to more than the single village or small district in which they were made. We must, moreover, remember the pit- falls of the "evolutionary series," the arrangement by the ethnologist of a number of variants of a given design trait in an order which seems to pre- serve the successive stages in its de- velopment from, say, a naturalistic representation of a lizard to a geo- metrically decorated lozenge. This can be a most instructive method of study, provided that we do not suppose it pos- sible by this means to determine the actual chronological order in which the objects were made, or even that in which the design variants were first in- troduced. In the case of sculptural forms, we shall be more usefully em- ployed in collecting external evidence about the dates and authorship of works by diligent enquiry in the field than in trying, on a basis of style alone, to arrange them in a developmental cycle. I make an exception for cases where, in the course of this century, a progressive degeneration of a tradi- tional style under European influence is discernible. As for "Use of Psychological Meth- ods," I prefer to regard this whole sec- tion as an awful warning rather than as a real promise of help from that quarter. Psychology has so far thrown little significant light upon the art of the Western world, even though so much of modern art is now Freud-di- rected; but even if it had done much more in this field, it would still be a very different matter to apply it in the tribal world, requiring a prior develop- ment of some neglected branches of anthropology, and especially that almost non-existent branch which I may perhaps call ethno-philosophy. I think that it will be very many years before psychologists develop adequate tech- niques to make valid contributions to the study of tribal art. In the meantime we should look with the greatest cau- tion on writings which purport, how- ever plausibly, to explain works of tribal art in psychological terms, re- membering that psychology is still (like the tribal religions) to some extent a self-supporting logical system. Under "Types of Aesthetic Vision," I should be inclined to add a fifth cate- gory, "the integrated (or tribal) type." I must disagree absolutely with Has- elberger's view that the time for col- lecting biographies of "ethnological artists" has passed. On the contrary, it has only just begun, for it is only in the last few years that the importance of individual artists, as opposed to "the tradition", has begun to be recognized. Some of the best African traditional artists are still practising, and innumer- able fine carvers have died in the past 20 years or so. Since it is still possible to collect eyewitness accounts of events which took place 70 years ago, it is clearly possible to collect life histories of most of the carvers who have flour- ished in this century. The next 20 years should be especially fruitful, but there is no reason why such biographi- cal research should stop then. More- over, it is certainly not true that "the most skilled artists have been absorbed in the ranks of those producing art work for the tourist trade." These lat- ter are almost always of a very differ- ent turn of mind from the true artist, their motivation being wholly com- mercial; their art does not come from inside them. Translation is rare. I must say that I am amazed to read that 1950 was a great climacteric, be- fore which wood-carving and after which painting best represented the artistic abilities of the African Ne- gro; when I was visiting Nigeria and the Congo in early 1950, nowhere did I receive an inkling of such an impend- ing revolution. In the traditional cul- tures of West Africa, I should say that painting is hardly anywhere more than an insignificant and sporadic phenome- non, except when used in enhancement of sculptures and especially of masks. But it is school art that Haselberger seems to have in mind, and it must be said at once that art education has been (with rare exceptions) among the most signal failures of the European mission in Africa, precisely because no attempt was made to build on African aptitudes, European methods of teaching being introduced with little if any modifica- tion. As in Europe, the teachers sent out were nearly all painters, and those few who became enthusiasts for African sculpture were often frowned upon if they tried to make use of it in their courses. African schoolchildren show no less aptitude for painting than others, and indeed their work is in- distinguishable from that of children everywhere; but it cannot be said that painting has caught on in Africa as an adult occupation or recreation, and the handful of "contemporary" artists have almost exclusively European clienteles and derive their art directly or indi- rectly from the School of Paris and not from African sources. It is significant that those of them who practise paint- ing as well as sculpture are by common consent better at the latter. Altogether a great opportunity was lost by the European educationalists, but it is to be hoped that with independence their African successors will restore the em- phasis to sculpture, thus giving free rein once more to genuinely African artistic abilities. Haselberger's useful summary of African art history suffers, I think, from a tendency to treat as established facts propositions which are at best reason- able hypotheses; in fact, the scope for new research and interpretation is greater than is obvious from this ac- count. I am much mystified by Mori's re- ported suggestion that immigration of Negroid peoples may have produced the stylistic revolution by which dynas- tic succeeded predynastic art in Egypt. In fact, the artistic affinities of Negro art seem to be entirely with predynastic Egypt, while the philosophical and mathematical basis of dynastic art and culture never seems to have had any influence in Negro Africa-although individual traits did of course travel great distances. In general, I think that the implications of the North African paintings require much further con- sideration by Africanists; and in par. ticular I do not feel that the represen- tation of Negro masks in some of them can yet be regarded as fully established, attractive though the theory certainly is to me. (I have discerned a Baluba mask in a Roman wall painting from St. Albans !) 366 CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY</page><page sequence="27">Haselberger: METHOD OF STUDYING ETHNOLOGICAL ART The importance of Kush as a cul- tural mediator between Egypt and Negro Africa, especially in the matter of cire perdue, is also very much a mat- ter of speculation at present. The dif- fusion could equally have occurred across the Sahara from Roman North Africa. And it is perhaps an exaggera- tion to speak of lost wax "flourishing" in Egypt, since the Egyptians used it only for minuscule works, and never for life-size bronze heads, let alone the near-life-size figures of Jebba and Tada. I shall leave it to my brother, B. Fagg, to comment on the Nok Culture. The view, expressed without qualifi- cation, that the Ife style is "the climax of African Negro art," coupled with the later estimate of the present styles as degenerations from "the art of the old empires," evinces an artistic preconcep- tion of the European tradition which is shared with many writers (including the late Leonhard Adam). The refer- ence is not, of course, to the undoubted degeneration which has occurred in most, but not all, places in the past half-century with the decline of the old religions under the revolutionary im- pact of industrial civilization. It is clearly not a matter capable of scien- tific proof, but many others besides myself consider that the best works of the period around 1900 (and some of later years) are superior in artistic vig- our and profound poetic expression of the fundamentals of African belief to the admirable but less moving court art of Ife. Which of the old empires, we may in any case ask, has yielded any representational art at all? Such indi- cations as we have suggest that where visual art was concerned these empires were of a somewhat philistine charac- ter. What evidence is there that the Iron Age began in the West African wood- lands about A.D. 500? Since iron-work- ing seems to have been known in the area of the Nok Culture, on both sides of the Benue, nearly a millennium earlier, it would be surprising if it had taken more than a few years to spread to the Ibo or their predecessors. I do not know of anything in African art (almost all found in West Africa) which is explained by trade between the East Coast and the Asiatic countries. I find the discussion of Style Phases a little obscure. But it is most important not to attempt to establish them on too global a scale; we shall be lucky to suc- ceed within the tribe, and until we have done so with many tribes it will be worse than useless to attempt to con- struct larger theories. If I may make one more general com- ment, I would say that, while our great need in tribal art studies is for more facts, we should never forget that the study of any art must by its nature be far more a humanity than a science. [London, 1.4.61] By WILLIAM N. FENTON* The first question raised by Hasel- berger's provocative article is a proprie- tary one. Do we need a new term for the art of preliterate peoples? The term "primitive art" was perfectly satisfac- tory in 1927, when Boas' classic treat- ment of the subject appeared, which de- fined its nature in aesthetic appeal, analyzed its formal elements, discussed the relationship of representative art to symbolism in all its facets, and explored the problem of style, with particular reference to the elaborated art forms of the Northwest Coast peoples of North America. That he had probed to the foundations of some universal human behavior trait was quite clear to Boas as he concluded his book; and it is notable that Ruth Bunzel, in handling the same subject a decade later for Boas' General Anthropology (1938), had dropped the qualifier and calls her chapter simply "Art." Admittedly, the term "primitive" is loaded with undesirable meanings for peoples of the world who are now emerging to nationhood, and if carried to its logical extremity no people will want to be studied. And the term has acquired a tertiary meaning as applied to a collection or museum of ethno- graphic objects of aesthetic appeal to collectors, a movement that is now en- joying the height of fashion; and the ob- jects are displayed out of cultural con- text, scarcely hinting at the cultural whole that the anthropologist has striven for 50 years to see and delineate (Fenton 1960: 342-43). For these rea- sons a new term may be desirable, but is "ethnological art" any better? My main objection to the new term is the implication that it tends to limit ethnological inquiry to the cultures of peoples outside of the Western tradi- tion-"to objects that do not belong to cultures usually included in studies of art historians. . ."-a tendency that may be noted in the work of our Central Eu- ropean colleagues. I would agree that it is difficult to draw a line between art and non-art, but I am also of the opinion that some art arises out of sheer virtuosity in the manipulation of set forms, and that the "aesthetic intention" may be secondary. With much of the article I am in sub- stantial agreement, and the suggested program of field studies is laudable. Each of us can document from his own field experience some point that bears on this program. I can think of no more convincing demonstration of the thesis that "one can never make a detailed study of a work of art without determin- ing its place in the total structure of the culture as well as in historical style- sequences" than my own experience in documenting a mnemonic cane depict- ing the roll call of the Iroquois chiefs; which led from a museum specimen to an analysis of the political structure of a confederacy (Fenton 1950). Hasel- berger's article is a salutory exposition of this point of view. Methods of field research are inevi- tably adapted to the problem, the so- ciety, and the terrain. Verbal accounts of how to do it are always unsatisfactory but are helpful as check lists of things to do. On the criteria for classification I have even less to say, lacking the op- portunity to check them in the context of a research problem. But since I did approach this problem several years ago and asked "Some questions of classifica- tion, typology, and style raised by Iro- quois masks," I mention it now, if only to add a reference to the literature that has escaped the author (Fenton 1956). It appears that styles, like ceremonies, evolve locally, and exert strong feed- back effects upon the formation of ster- eotypes, and this process may be even more important than mythology in de- termining how the natives conceive the supernaturals and classify masks. I find the possible correlation be- tween constitutional types and artistic styles an interesting idea which ought to be investigated in the field, although it may prove impracticable to bring off. The depth and breadth of training re- quired is not the equipment of the field ethnologist embarking on a dissertation problem. Masks offer, nevertheless, an exciting possibility for such a study in areas where physical type, personality structure, and art styles are well known and afford abundant data. I have always been impressed by the contrasts offered between the floral beadwork of Iroquois women and the grotesque carving and rough and ready craftsmanship of their menfolk. One wonders whether the men made the effigy pottery pipes in prehis- toric times? I should also like to see made some studies of eidetic imagery. American In- dian art forms, including music, still of- fer attractive opportunities. [Albany, New York, 25.3.61] By DOUGLAS F. FRASER* Haselberger's attempt to impose or- der on the study of "ethnological art" deserves full discussion. She has rightly stressed the importance of painting, ar- chitecture, and "tourist art," subjects neglected by anthropologists and art historians alike. And her suggestions for field research, if carried out, will add Vol. 2 - No. 4 * October 1961 367</page><page sequence="28">extensive data to the rather meager first- hand sources on the non-Western arts. Much as I applaud these achieve- ments, I must take exception to Hasel- berger on a number of key points which might otherwise stand unchallenged. Most of these have to do with her con- ception of art and of art history as ex- pressed in her reconstruction of the Af- rican development. First of all there is a real danger in the rigid application of method or system to so elusive a subject as art. In dis- cussing classification procedures, Hasel- berger insists on separation according to media. Applied with moderation, this technique will often clarify prob- lems; but it should never become a dogma. Objects converted from one medium to another without change of form (called skeuomorphs by Haddon 1895) are among our most important historical phenomena. I also question the general utility of cyclical or polar art theories. Hasel- berger, while sharing some of my skepti- cism, at the same time pays lip service to "ideal" pairs of formal extremes. Scha- piro (1953) has shown how dubious these theories are, even for Western art. In practice they tend to rigidify into personal systems that disregard quali- tative differences in style. Similarly, cyclical theories ignore the social, his- torical, and economic forces that mold and modify artistic forms. On the other hand Haselberger seems to discard one of our fundamental tools when she rejects the so-called "law of frontality." In Lange's view, certain aesthetic traits such as rotation of the axis of the body, avoidance of main- prospect, etc., can arise only after the earlier phases of frontal, rigid conform- ity to the block, etc., have been attained. Greek, Romanesque, and Chinese sculp- ture follows such a process of compara- tive development. In a less evolutionary way this approach helps to classify the arts of Africa, Oceania, and America. The example of Eskimo sculpture cited by Haselberger is obviously due to re- cent acculturation. Haselberger also lays considerable emphasis on "art for art's sake." Of course aesthetic feeling probably exists in all artists of whatever culture. But it is no service to primitive man to attrib- ute to him certain attitudes that crystal- lized in Europe as a result of special cir- cumstances. Until the 19th century, Western art always had an ulterior func- tion-glorification of a ruler, desire for salvation, organization of the external world, etc. But with the breakdown of traditional values and the disappear- ance of sources of patronage, artists turned to "art's sake" for self-justifica- tion. Such a situation never existed in primitive society, and never will as long as the traditional need for the artist's work continues (Firth 1951: 171). That the Western usage is indeed recent is shown by the etymology of the word art itself. This term was not used in the modern sense of something valued in- dependently for its aesthetic qualities until the second half of the 19th cen- tury. While Haselberger's conception of art is enriched by a strong personal viewpoint, her reconstruction of African art contains little in the way of new in- sight or information. Relying heavily on Davidson (1959), a far from adequate source, she concludes: The bulk of present styles of tribal carv- ing, painting, and building in Africa seem to reflect, in a more or less degenerate man- ner, the art of the old empires. But it is a striking fact that almost all of these old empires-Kush, Meroe, Zimbabwe, etc.-lie outside the heart- land of African art, the area embraced by the Niger and Congo drainages. Only the relatively recent Sudanic em- pires and the Nok-Ife-Benin complex and perhaps Sao are close enough to the Niger-Congo areas to have participated in any such development of art. In truth the finest African arts-the sculpture of the Niger-Congo area-have their source in the Neolithic era. The key evidence is a complex formal ar- rangement-called for the sake of brev- ity, the heart-shaped face-which per- meates the entire Niger-Congo area from the Mendi and Baga in Sierra Leone and Guinea to the Makonde of Tanganyika (Fraser 1961). Basically, the term "heart-shaped" de- scribes a method of carving the face which is as follows: the area from the eyebrows to the mouth is hollowed out from the cylindrical shape of the block. The eyes and nose are left behind as high relief forms. The heart-shaped area then extends from the eyebrows-often shown as twin arcs-down across the cheeks, converging in the vicinity of the mouth or chin. The clearest instances of the heart-shaped face are in Pangwe, Kwele, and Lega masks, but it predomi- nates also throughout the Congo-Gabon region and in Ibo, Ibibio, Ijaw and Senufo, Dogon, and Bambara carving. The Niger-Congo area, as Greenberg has recently shown, is one of linguistic homogeneity. Since the heart-shaped face extends throughout this area, its comparative rarity in Nigeria and neighboring areas suggests an intrusion of some sort in the Lower Niger region. The presence of Nok, Ife, and Benin further indicates that this intrusion is one associated with high cultures stem- ming ultimately from the Ancient Near East. The heart-shaped face, on the other hand, must be older, in a histori- cal sense, than the art of Egypt or the Ancient Near East; this can only mean of Neolithic origin or earlier. Several independent sources confirm the Neolithic basis of the heart-shaped face. It occurs in figures from southwest- ern Ethiopia (Leuzinger 1960: Plate 62). This culture area, as Murdock (1959) and Crawford (1956) have emphasized, is distinctly Megalithic in character. Similar mortuary figures with the heart- shaped faces are found among the Pende (Sousberghe 1960) in association with horn spirals and double axe sym- bols. All of these devices suggest pre- Egyptian levels of society. Looking further afield, we observe in- stances of heart-shaped faced wooden figures in Neolithic contexts in the Mediterranean, Northern Europe, and Asia, for example a 3rd Millenium B.C. figure from the Ural Mountains (Mon- gait 1959: 101). Poor preservation con- ditions and the rise of more naturalistic interpretations of the face have elimi- nated many of the early data. I cannot at this time expand fully on the implications of this discovery; ob- viously certain traditional positions will have to be abandoned before new ones can be investigated. But it should be noted that Haselberger also observed this connection: ". . . the abstract murals painted by the women, based on tradi- tions that can be traced back to the neolithic Mediterranean cultures." Un- fortunately she did not pursue this line of reasoning further in her reconstruc- tion of the history of African art. [New York, 1.3.61] By ROBERT BRUCE INVERARITY* When asked to comment on such a paper as this, embracing a wide field, one's tendency is either to generalize in a few remarks and say the paper is well done although there are certain points of disagreement, or to attempt a really critical evaluation, which in many cases would mean writing a book. I am not going to venture the latter approach, but shall offer a few general remarks. Haselberger's Introduction is liable to arouse disagreement as the author tries to establish a basis from which to begin. Regardless of whether the sub- ject under discussion is just plain art or primitive, tribal, traditional, native, ab- original, indigenous, folk, popular, high, low, applied, plebeian, ethnologi- cal, anthropological, exotic, ancient, or ethnic art, the problem of terminology has long been under discussion and no doubt will be for some time. However, I am in agreement with her position that time will clarify this issue although not necessarily with one term. It is diffcult, if not impossible, to de- fine a work of art-witnessed by the number of volumes in any art library 368 CURRENT ANTHROP O LOGY</page><page sequence="29">Haselberger: METHOD OF STUDYING ETHNOLOGICAL ART devoted to this subject. I am not sure that a long-lasting working formula for all times and places has been or can be developed. Also, I am not sure that such a formula is necessary. What creates an art experience for one person may not create a similar experience for another person. In certain instances the stimu- lus for such an art experience may or may not be a work of art. I do not be- lieve that the motive involved in the production of a work of art is a valid standard-many pieces of non-art have been created with good aesthetic inten- tions. Haselberger makes no effort here to consider the frame of reference of the observer. What may be a work of art to one person in one culture may certainly not be acceptable as a work of art to another person with a different cultural background or at a different time. If we are dealing with ethnological art, as de- fined by the author, the possibility of a variety of cultural frames of reference then presents a "tower of Babel" as to what is a work of art. To say that "a Melanesian carves a paddle and strives to give it a beautiful form" and from this predicate it as a work of art due to this aesthetic intention leaves me con- fused. Beautiful by whose standards- the Melanesian's, the author's, those of the Western world, or whose? To say that "art is involved only when the action produces results designed to affect someone, and is not, like play, an end in itself" is equally confusing. Is it not possible that an object that has been created in play, even scratches on a rock, by a person of one culture could be classified as a work of art by someone else of the same culture or of another culture and time? This type of premise would also presuppose that we know the motivations of all the creators of works of art or non-works of art. In all of the above, we have great problems of semantics. We also have the problem whether the particular society or culture whose works might be under discussion has any concept of a work of art. Under the subheading Present In- adequacies, as well as in other parts of this article, many anthropologists and museum personnel will find statements with which they will disagree. My feel- ing is that some research and publi- cations, perhaps not widely enough known, have escaped the attention of the author. The plea for a systematic collection of material and its study is one with which I am in full accord. A number of years ago I did a great amount of research and tried desper- ately to establish an organized file of such material in micro-reproduction for such study, but was unable to find sym- pathetic or active response. The remainder of the article includes points with which one could argue, but this would vitiate a most worthwhile attempt to clarify a complexity of issues and approaches. The author has con- sidered a most difficult subject in a very direct manner. Haselberger's reitera- tion of the need for more intelligent and organized research is shared by any- one remotely aware of the art-anthro- pology field; and in turn she has pre- sented a carefully considered approach to develop such a method of study. [Blue Mountain Lake, New York, 15.3.61] By ARNE MARTIN KLAUSEN* Haselberger's article is a very useful summary of our present knowledge of "primitive art." (I do not like the term "ethnological art," but use the strictly technical term "primitive" in the mean- ing of "non-literate.") The article is also of great value as a kind of micro-edition of "Notes and queries in anthropol- ogy," specially made for the scholars who deal with artistic activity in a so- ciety. The author stresses the importance of "proper methods," and states that, for the anthropologist studying art in primitive societies, "new conceptual tools must be forged." I completely agree with this statement. But I am not sure that we have so much to learn from the "concepts of European art history." The study of art in Western society has always accentuated the aspect of evalu- ating works of art according to aesthetic criteria peculiar to our society. The art historian and art critic collaborate very intimately in our society, which results in a tendency not to separate pure de- scription from value judgments. At- tempts to establish analytical terms in the science of Western art traditions are more characteristic of the critic than of the analytical scientist. In serious works one can even see the word "style" used as a qualitative term, e.g. with the mean- ing "good style," according to accepted criteria. In the study of social and political or- ganization, which has played a domi- nant part in anthropology during the last decades, a set of descriptive terms has emerged; everyone knows the mean- ing of clan, moiety, polygyny, polyan- dry, and so on. There are few anthro- pologists who, in the description of a social structure, use these terms with an ethical value bias. Thus, in my opinion, the most important task for the student of art must be that of adopting the same precision that the student of kinship and marriage has evolved since the time of Radcliffe-Brown, and to get rid of the tendency to be value-oriented. I would even say that the study of Western cul- ture (art, literature, music, dance) might profit from the viewpoint of cultural relativism, which is more consistent in anthropology than in any other branch of the humanities. Haselberger stresses, as mentioned earlier, the importance of obtaining "new conceptual tools"; but in spite of useful dichotomies and some clarifying definitions, I still have the feeling that fundamental terms are used in an im- precise way. The terms motif, style, form, naturalistic, realistic, stylized-to mention only a few-are used in a very ambiguous way in the literature on European art, and I do not feel that the author clarifies these terms. Under the first heading, "Form," I find expressions that I should like to have more clearly explained. Hasel- berger writes: "Another basis for the classification of art objects is analysis of their outward form, or style criticism." Are "form analysis" and "style criti- cism" synonymous? And what is really meant by "style criticism" in this con- text: Is it criticism in the sense of "good-bad," or does it just mean "an- alysis"? The next sentence reads: "The style of an art object is best grasped through description." I really wonder what is meant by "style," if there are any methods for discovering the "style of an art object" other than "describ- ing" it. I would also comment on the following sentence: "The individual style of any work of art is brought out most clearly by comparison with similar objects." Here I wonder what is meant by "individual style." Personally I find it impossible to use an expression like this, since to me the word "style" pre- supposes comparison with other objects, similar or not. Style is to me an abstrac- tion dealing with the similarities be- tween objects. Suppose that we found in Antarctica a unique specimen. I would not talk about "the style" of this specimen, but the form. But if a second specimen were found ten miles away from the first, it might be useful to in- troduce the term "Antarctic style," if the specimens had traits in common. These comments may seem trifling, but I cannot get away from the feeling that what we need is to work on the primary terms, such as form, motif, style, and a few others, rather than to start working with precisely defined psy- chological dichotomies. For a limited analysis of basket-work ornamentation among some Dayak groups, I have tried to establish a set of analytical terms for this special material; and those inter- ested in details will find the title of the book cited in the references. Haselberger seems to be very much Vol. 2 *No. 4 - October 1961 369</page><page sequence="30">interested in stylistic differences, and especially those "in the formal artistic character." For this reason she stresses the importance of comparing objects of identical material, made by the same technique, and with the same purpose and content, "so that differences caused by these factors are minimal." Of course this is very important; but one must not forget the possible value of the opposite procedure. In studying an area, a tribe, or a group of any kind, with the inten- tion of analysing the interrelation of art and society, I feel that the common traits in the art objects would be of most interest. For that reason I would choose not to follow Haselberger's advice, but rather to do the opposite. I would first and foremost compare objects of differ- ent material, different technique, and with different contents and purposes. By introducing all these variables, one has an opportunity to see the so-called real artistic or formal unity in the area, the group, or in the work of a particular artist if his production comprehends all the variables just mentioned. By this procedure one might get more insight into the art-creating processes and might also discover the degree of interdepend- ence between technological factors and the ideas of "beauty" in the particular society. [Oslo, 1.3.61] By GEORGE KUBLER* Haselberger's article achieves a com- munication of some utility to those anthropologists and art historians who usually seem to navigate upon parallel and separate courses without communi- cation. She defines art as affective action governed by aesthetic intention. The idea not only satisfies the art historian, but it also enlarges the anthropologist's standard of art as a manifestation of play impulse, a preconception which Haselberger firmly ignores. Her idea of the "structure" of the work of art as a manifold of dimensions in material, technique, purpose, con- tent, and form is also convenient, and it gets us past the usual anthropologi- cal restriction to material and technical classing. It is worth recalling, however, that materials and techniques are easier to describe than purpose, content, or form, so that her enumeration may be taken to correspond to an increasing or- der of difficulty, easiest with materials, and hardest with form. Our perplexities begin with "pur- pose," since aesthetic intention is usu- ally detected through the absence of any rational or rationalized purpose. To these difficulties I shall return below. "Content" in turn offers an even more perplexing logical dificulty. Following E. Panofsky (Studies in Iconology, 1938) Haselberger speaks of "three layers of meaning for an art object," which she simplifies as representation, meaning, and significance. Panofsky, however, made it clear that to know the exact meaning of an old object, we must have a text. But texts are lacking for all non- literate or preliterate cultures. These short-circuits in the second layer throw us back upon "significance" or intrinsic meaning, where the precision of ade- quate proof is unattainable. In respect to "form," finally, Haselberger reviews for us some selected "ideal types of op- posite pairs of formal characteristics," like "tectonic-atectonic," "haptic- optic," etc. We need to work more on the theoretical assumptions of these di- mensions, whose completion, or at least enrichment, is a most urgent immediate task now confronting students of art. It may also have been precipitate of Haselberger to have said so categorically that "the art of ethnological peoples differs from other art only in degree." A case can still be made for certain dif- ferences in kind, as when we consider the grouping of peoples having literary traditions about art, including artistic biography and art theory. The artistic behavior of these groups differs radi- cally from the affective habits and tra- ditions of non-literate peoples. This distinction, between Far Eastern or Eu- ropean peoples and "ethnographical" peoples, as to the large constellations of artistic practice, is not only objectively verifiable, but it even gives Haselberger her central idea of separating "ethno- logical art" from all other art. I am not sure, in any case, that Hasel- berger's topography of artistic activity is complete enough. She is right to in- clude "tourist" art as a presentrday emergent with global diffusion, but she makes no mention of the provincial styles and the rustic arts that preceded modern tourist productions and indus- trial expressions. Furthermore, her re- striction to "fine arts" (including archi- tecture, painting, and sculpture, as well as "arts and crafts") makes many diffi- culties in respect to the culturally vari- able threshold between artistic and non- artistic spheres of human activity. Her remarks imply that although every man- made thing may be art, we still have to draw a line between art and non-art, a boundary varying according to culture upon some undivulged principle. As a result, two identical objects of different cultural origins might have to be classed one as art and the other as non-art, de- pending upon the shifting locus of the imagined boundary in the two cultures. If we return to the vexed question of artistic "purpose," the reader will recall that Haselberger proposes 7 varieties. These are all endocultural, i.e., subor- dinate to a conception of culture as the supreme and all-embracing entity of existence. By this view of culture as a deity working his wonders to perform, art is mere illustration, and the art ob- ject, as Haselberger insists, is deter- mined by its cultural context. It remains the view of many art historians, how- ever, that no theory of historical change can be valid if it fails to account for those indeterminate or mutational as- pects of happening, of which important works of art have always been our clear- est evidence. In other words, to her 7 varieties of artistic "purpose" ("moti- vation" would have been preferable), an eighth should be added to suggest the absolute primacy of artistic activity as an exploratory mode of sensing the universe. This mode may be shaped by culture, to be sure, but it exists inde- pendently and outside many of the stock responses of cultural condition- ing. In contrast to the anthropologist, who shelves art under culture, the art historian always wants to invert this or- der, by looking to artists for the clearest manifestations of those non-rational im- pulses toward change without which there can be no history. Haselberger is far more inclined to believe in the ra- tional character of artistic activity than I am: she sees it as culture-bound, pur- poseful, and determinate, while I regard the work of art as more indeterminate and non-rational, transcending its cul- tural framework whenever it is a prime object rather than a replica of another object. [New Haven, Connecticut, 27.3.61] By HENRI LAVACHERY* The criticisms passed on the term "primitive art" after the publication of Gerbrands' paper (1957) are a matter of common knowledge and are per- fectly justified. In my opinion, though, the expression "ethnological art" is even less satisfactory. Stating the par- ticular type of investigation which one applies to a given object hardly con- tributes to the definition we are after: no one is, after all, likely to call modern art "aesthetic art" because most of the people writing about it are aestheti- cians. As I see it, the right approach is once and for all to avoid lumping together under a single general term the arts of Africans, Oceanians, Amer-Indians, etc. Any one term singling them out and setting them apart from the universal trend of history of art makes for neither more nor less than a colour-bar. Alleged basic differences between their arts and ours appear to me as so many misunder- standings rooted in a certain failure to understand the phenomenon of art it- self. To all appearances, we have by now done away with the obsolete oversimpli- fications of 19th-century evolutionism. But did we actually get rid of a nostalgia 370 CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY</page><page sequence="31">Haselberger: METHOD OF STUDYING ETHNOLOGICAL ART for "progress in art"? Are we immune to sentimental longing for a "transcen- dental beauty" which once served as the criterion for the "real work of art"? All this, of course, does not mean that we are not perfectly entitled to like the Venus de Medici better than an African sculpture. The real point is that our personal preference for the Venus de Medici should not induce us to look upon African sculpture as a clumsy, un- skilful performance. Does Haselberger manage to avert this type of mistake when stating that "the art of ethnological peoples differs from other art only in degree"? She goes on to insist on the fact that "the fine arts of all ethnological peoples share enough common features . . . " and by so doing attempts to justify (without proving her case) that a ge- neric term, which I personally cannot accept, is applicable. Many laymen or immature students will, as a matter of fact, make "common features" out of superficial material analogies. The specialist, however, can- not be fooled. No doubt, in-say-Afri- can art, the function of the work of art is the fundamental raison d'etre. But did things work out differently among the Greeks (even for Phidias) or during the European Middle Ages? Beauty- or better, perfection-is to be regarded as an attribute of supernatural power. Decline or transition in religious feeling brings about a certain disregard of the transcendental function. There enters "art for art's sake" (in which our own historical period has a share). If a division between the arts turns out to be indispensable, it should of course avoid taking into account his- torical periods, countries, and above all "races," and should turn to a classi- fication which would group together, on the one hand, "functional arts" (function taking precedence over beauty), and on the other, "sensorial arts" (with beauty as the one raison d'etre). Adopting such a classification for what it would be worth, the ethno- graphical methods outlined by Hasel- berger will no doubt prove useful, pro- vided that they are supplemented by aesthetic methods. [Brussels, 6.3.61] By PHILLIP LEWIS* As a student of the phenomenon of primitive art, I admire and congratu- late Haselberger on her brave attempt to deal with this sprawling and peculiar field. In addition, as a museum anthro- pologist, I am pleased to state my ap- preciation for her awareness (1) that art objects actually exist as material arti- facts, and (2) that, in addition to merely collecting them, there is (or should be) a fairly complex procedure of documen- tation based upon field observation. She urges us to observe and describe the physical structure of the art object, the process by which it is made, the location of its place of origin and use, the point or points in time through which it per- sists, and the position of the art object in its culture. Also we are urged to col- lect the biographies of artists and inves- tigate the various relationships of art to economy, social organization, and intel- lectual life. Finally, Haselberger points toward the possibility that the strange, exotic, and largely unknown systems of primitive art may be found to have his- tories of art, complete with historically significant artists,works of art, and other favorite problems of art historians. Haselberger addresses her paper to art historians, asking them to extend their interests to include primitive art so that a world-wide history of art can be approached, and to ethnologists, ask- ing them to study the art traditions of the peoples they deal with by means of "aesthetic as well as ethnological inves- tigation." Her article "is designed to broaden the range of vision of ethnol- ogists and art historians, so that they understand each other's methods and thus arrive at a new method." On the whole Haselberger succeeds in presenting to art historians some of the methods necessary for work with non-literate peoples, and in suggesting to ethnologists that art can be studied as the center of a web of functionally related aspects of culture and society. However, one is tempted to quibble here in saying that art historians, used to working in libraries and museums, will not have much zeal for pursuing ethnological field research; and on the other side, ethnologists who are not now interested in art as a focus of their stud- ies will not suddenly drop their other investigations in favor of art research. Therefore the question arises: who, ac- tually, will benefit from the paper? It will obviously be persons already oriented toward the study of primitive art, including those in history of art as well as those in anthropology. In either case, it seems to me that would-be inves- tigators of art would be most pleased with the advice on field method, which is practical and thorough, but would be confused by and unhappy with the lack of a conceptual framework which defines and limits the field of study. The advice in the sections on Collec- tion, Description, Inquiry, Observa- tion, and Detailed Study of a Work of Art could help very much in collecting and investigating art in the field, but could also furnish necessary orientation for investigation of undocumented art objects in museums and private collec- tions. However, when one looks for a con- ceptual framework with respect to types of societies included in Haselberger's field of interest, one is confused. I have attempted to deal with this problem in my paper, "Toward a Definition of Primitive Art," in which the problem of comparison of art form is put aside by not assuming it to be a criterion of development of society. Since art is the phenomenon being studied, assessment of the degree of its formal variation must be a result of study, and must not be part of the data which are to be ana- lyzed. Thus in my view, the total pos- sible field of study is divided, in what I hope is a significant way, into the arts of primitive and civilized societies. Haselberger sees that same total field as non-divisible, saying that there "are no stylistic characteristics limited exclu- sively to [this field of art]"; and also that (1) the art of ethnological peoples differs from other art only in degree, and (2) the difference is not sufficient for designating it by a single distinct term that is both accurate and definitive, suitable for application to the art of "all ethnological peoples." Haselberger states that the term ethnological art is negative, and is "no more than a work- ing term." It is clear then, that Haselberger con- siders the field of interest covered by the term "ethnological art" to be an all- inclusive term, one which is very similar to Gerbrands' "non-European art" (Gerbrands 1957: 24). Both terms are relatively free of invidious connota- tions, but present difficulties, even as provisional or working terms. The cate- gory non-European would exclude the art of paleolithic Europeans, about whom Gerbrands says (1957: 11): Primitive can certainly be used to indi- cate the initial stage of human culture as such, but then it must be understood as referring to the culture of paleolithic man, which does indeed, as far as we know at present, represent the earliest phase in cul- tural development. The term "ethnological," except for the bias of ethnologists for working with primitive people, cannot be re- stricted to such people. Ethnologists can and do work with urban and peasant Europeans and with peoples of similar social organization from other parts of the world, and thus the term ethnologi- cal art could include the art of all peo- ples observed as living people. A more serious objection to the use of the term "ethnological art" is the implication that the art of archaeo- logically known peoples is excluded. Again, we can refer to paleolithic art, which would not be included. There are differences between archaeologi- Yol. 2 * No. 4 - October 1961 371</page><page sequence="32">cally-recovered art and that collected from and studied in living societies. Archaeologically-recovered art consists mostly of objects made of durable ma- terials, which have survived. Knowledge about their socio-cultural context is based more upon inference than upon direct observation. The study of the art of ethnologically-known peoples is methodologically different from study of archaeologically-recovered art; but it does not follow that the art is different in any significant aspect. Arbitrarily cutting off an archaeologically-known historical dimension from the culture history of a studied group is not what Haselberger intended by the term eth- nological art. Indeed, in the section His- tory of African Art, archaeological evi- dence is used freely. A minor objection to the term is that "ethnological" gives a falsely scientific aura to the objects which are preserved in museum and private collections. Mu- seum anthropologists would be de- lighted to have the careful documenta- tion, the functional exploration of the art object in its context that the term implies. In actual fact many art objects are collected by amateurs and often lack documentation. Under the subheading Form, in the section entitled Detailed Study of a Work of Art, Haselberger grapples with one of the crucial problems of the study of art, in attempting to tell us how to describe and analyze art form. Since most of us avoid this area in a cowardly way, it is hardly fair to say that I do not regard the system of con- trasting opposing pairs of types of form as ideal for use with primitive art. I would prefer a more direct and descrip- tive system, perhaps one which refers to elements of form in geometric terms as suggested in Gardner (1936: vii-xv) as the visual elements of art expression. The section on Use of Psychological Methods seems to me the least promis- ing or useful part of the paper. In con- sidering the section Constitutional Types, for argument's sake, let us as- sume that the statement is true that "it is quite certain that connections be- tween constitutional types and artistic styles exist." Until we have accounted for the determining effects of cultural and social contexts on art styles, how can we tell what psychological factors have helped to differentiate Dorian and Ionian art, or the art of Florence from that of Venice? One implication of this is: as anthropologists, we must master and analyze the data and problems of our discipline (art in its social and cultural contexts) before it is possible to deal with psychological aspects of art. It is possible that there are correlations between art styles and psychological factors, but I cannot see that with pres- ent knowledge these can be anythin but intriguing possibilities. The discus sion of types of aesthetic vision and o an "eidetic" type of person seem to b, similarly premature. For instance, if i were found that persons had natural o artificially induced eidetic capabilities their art expressions would still be prc duced within a socio-cultural frame work, and would be subject to man non-personal determining forces. How ever, it would certainly be pertinent t( describe such talents, if observable, i a context of biographies of artists, or o recruitment and training of artists. In conclusion, despite the severa negative points raised, I must empha size that I found Haselberger's pape: informative and stimulating. Especiall, good is the clear aim throughout th( paper that it is art which is beinc studied by using anthropological anc art-historical methods and concepts Anthropological approaches to ar often attempt to use art to discove: something about culture history or th( nature of society, procedures which arn perfectly valid, but which do not tell u much about art. [Chicago, 24.3.61 By ANDREAS LOMMEL* I am, of course, grateful for the de tailed list concerning the methods ol studying ethnological art; but I am nol in favour of the term itself. Haselbergei herself points out the uselessness of all attempts to formulate an accurate and generally accepted term. The new term, it seems to me, is not adequate either, and is only a further provisorium. Defi nitions of art are a special problem. So far, there exists no generally ac- cepted definition as to what art really is. In spite of all the scholarly efforts of Greek, Chinese, and Japanese philos- ophers, as well as Western scientists, we still cannot say when and why the dabblings of prehistoric men become art; and when and why-if at all, for that matter-the works of modern artists cease to be art and become some- thing entirely different. The Staatliche Museum fur Volker- kunde (National Museum of Ethnol- ogy) in Munich has collections of ob- jects of art from every part of the world. This fact is pointed out to the public by calling it a museum for "aus- sereuropaische Kunst." The rather negative term "aussereuropaisch," which means non-European, has been chosen in order to point out that European art is not to be found in this museum, but rather art from anywhere else. In studying the art of various parts of the world, I think that mere geo- graphic terms will be sufficient in many cases, while other terms will be inade- quate for various reasons. We cannot compare "ethnological art" from Africa with that of Greece and Rome. But we can work on the diffusion of motives of art from the Mediterranean into North Africa and, for instance, Benin. Further study will reveal to us that relations between the art of different regions of the world are so intricate that the mere differentiation of "eth- nological" from other art-such as the art of "civilisations on a higher level" -will become more and more obsolete and impracticable. [Munich, 16.3.61] By C. NOOTEBOOM* Comparing the methods of art history with the methods of the ethnological discipline can surely be very useful; and in my opinion the methodological in- troduction of Haselberger can be very stimulating for the ethnological study of so-called primitive art. I reject the term "ethnological art," as I reject the term "ethnological peoples." In Ger- man, "Ethnologische Kunst" and "Eth- nologische Vblker" may be acceptable; but in English, as in Dutch (my mother- tongue), we cannot go further than perhaps "ethnographical art," as we already speak of "ethnographical ob- jects" or "ethnography." While fully appreciating Hasel- berger's attempt to cross-fertilize art history and ethnology (cultural and social anthropology), nevertheless I see serious objections. An object of prim- itive art can be appreciated as such when it evokes emotions of aesthetic value. But when we investigate the ob- ject we look for its qualities which cause these emotions; in other words, for the relations between the object and its viewer. And continuing our inquiry, we search for the origin of the qualities capable of evoking emotions. Certainly we see that these qualities are man- made. The art-object as such is nothing. It has value through the qualities it re- ceived at the hands of a man. This man, who is part of a society and who has a part in a culture, is the real ob- ject of the inquiry, and through this man we try to investigate the culture and the society behind him as human phenomena. This culture and this so- ciety are the real objects of our study, and not our piece of art. In art history, the object may possibly have the appearance of independence, more than in anthropology. But this is nothing but an illusion. In art history, too, it is not the object in itself, but its relation to people, and its qualities as human work, which ask for investiga- tion. Haselberger, however, looks at the object and wants to study the man be- hind it only for the object's sake. This is, I think, the reason that she is not 372 CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY</page><page sequence="33">Haselberger: METHOD OF STUDYING ETHNOLOGICAL ART digging deep enough in society and in culture to come to a satisfying under- standing of the art-object. Art for art's sake is very rare in so- called primitive societies. The few cases we find in the literature are perhaps the exceptions which prove the rule. Or they are not wholly authentic: Is influ- ence from Western culture out of the question in the few known cases? The qualities of an art-object which qualify it as such are never meant as only aesthetical. They always have a practical purpose: they make the ob- ject better fit for its function in the culture. The aesthetical "get-up" of an object, its ornamentation, the well- balanced tension in form and in colour, are means to a better result in its func- tioning, and not means to make some- thing beautiful. I value Haselberger's observations on "methods of field research" as very useful for an anthropologist interested in art, when the research-worker keeps in mind (as an anthropologist certainly will do) that not the object, but the peo- ple, the society, and the culture behind it remain the real topic of his investi- gation. The detailed desiderata of the author regarding the examination of an art- object are, I fear, a little too idealistic. Only in very rare cases will the investi- gator be able to pursue the ways indi- cated by the author. Especially, psycho- logical research on the artist and on the public in his environment will confront most anthropologists with a task for which they are not equipped. When we consider the urgent need for general anthropological research, and the rapid disappearance of peoples untouched by Western culture (New Guinea is the only large region where we can find extensive possibilities for this kind of research), we cannot devote much time and attention to art. The people, their society, and their culture are the real object of our study, and inquiries about art problems are of interest to us only when relevant to them. I said that Haselberger, by concen- trating her attention on the art-object, is not digging deep enough. Her re- marks on content, form, and structure seem to be superficial. The cultures in question are in reality total cultures. An art-object of some importance in such a culture must be expected to represent a part or an aspect of the totality. Con- tent, form, and structure, as well as eventual ornamentation, will reflect the thoughts on the universe which are ex- pressed in mythology. The representa- tion of an important god, or of a fore- father, can be a structure of symbols depicting part of the mythology. The same can be the case with cult-objects, or with the beautiful ikat-cloths of Sumba (Indonesia). An attempt to study such objects of art leads us to an inquiry into the totality of the culture. The methods of art history and psy- chology may possibly be of use, but will in most cases not be relevant. The pieces of primitive art of finest quality are those which reflect in the highest degree the total conception of culture and universe. They certainly are the best made, for the strain of the artist in expressing the highest values will be strongest; and only the best- qualified artist will dare to undertake such a holy labour. An object of art is, in a sense, a con- densed piece of writing. We can com- pose an ideal evolutionary series (which does not necessarily correspond to reality) beginning with art symboliz- ing mythological concepts via ancient Egyptian picture-writing and Chinese idiographic writing to other alphabets of more general use. The artist composes in his art the ex- pression of his image of cultural values in conformity with the society of which he is a member and the culture he lives in. These ideas I missed in the contem- plations of Haselberger. It is clear that her interest in "tourist art" in this line of thinking is of only little amplitude. In this kind of artistic creation the ten- sion of intercourse with the highest values is lacking, and the result will be weak and of little importance. [Rotterdam, 9.3.61] By FOKKE SIERKSMA* 1. The author is to be complimented upon her article dealing with a subject which is as difficult as it has been neglected. Her confronting cultural anthropology and art history is a valu- able undertaking, since many points have to be cleared up with respect to this much needed co-operation. More- over, her article demonstrates the value of CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY, e.g. broach- ing points of view that are not generally known, and pointing out the signifi- cance of the work of Vandenhoute. On one point at least all the students con- cerned will not differ: i.e., practically every topic in this field awaits further study. With respect to the science of art this certainly is not a truism. 2. The fact that the study of art has been much neglected is in itself sig- nificant. Art-objects are either articles of luxury, not connected with man's primary or secondary needs, or they are utensils (be it domestic or religious) that also have an aesthetic aspect. This may imply that to the cultural anthro- pologist the function of art is a second- ary onLe, and that objects of art should be studied by cultural anthropologists primarily as socially, economically, re- ligiously, etc. functional objects, the function of which is reinforced by their aesthetic impact. Art for art's sake does occur, but even in our own societies this is limited to a few really gifted and sensitive intellectuals. 3. The definition "ethnological art" is to the cultural anthropologist not only a purely negative one, but it also engenders a vicious circle; the more so as the author makes mention of "ethno- logical peoples," i.e., peoples studied by ethnologists. There is another com- plicating factor. To an economist there is an essential difference between the economy of the Aranda and the econ- omy of the U.S.A. To the student of art (as well as to the artist!), there is no such difference between, e.g. a Dan and a Japanese mask, a Benin and a Tibetan bronze. Although this is not true of music and architecture, arts which are more dependent upon technological de- velopment, the problem mentioned re- mains to be solved. As it remains to be seen, moreover, whether "hochkul- turen" and "intermediate" cultures should not also be studied by cultural anthropologists, n'en deplaise the sociologists, it might be suggested that, for the present, art should not be studied as ethnological and high art, but always inductively, as the art of a particular culture. 4. For similar reasons, it may be sug- gested that the question of the scope of primitive art should be reduced to the question of the scope of art in gen- eral. This is either a matter of provi- sional and inductive common sense (e.g. Herskovits 1948: 380), or a matter of philosophical analysis based on the findings of comparative psychology (cf. Gehlen 1960). If both approaches are kept separate, they may be useful; though sometimes, of course, we may gain a new insight by creating a short- circuit; but see under Point 2. And at any rate, a conscious aesthetic-artistic intention on the part of the artist does not seem sufficient to delimit the scope of art in general. Mutatis mutandis the words of Lao Tse will be true many times: "The truly virtuous is not con- scious of his virtue." Especially where sacred art is concerned, people in homogeneous cultures will more often ask "Is it correct, according to the pre- scribed rules?" than "Is it beautiful?" (sandpaintings, Egyptian statues, Ti- betan thang-kas and bronzes; comp. Sierksma 1960: 35 and passim). 5. Sometimes Haselberger slightly underrates the work already done. Con- sidering the painstaking studies of Gladys Reichard (1939, 1950), it is Vol. 2 No. 4 - October 1961 373</page><page sequence="34">rather difficult to maintain that Navaho sandpaintings "await systematic investi- gation." With respect to individual style, Bunzel's work might have been mentioned, especially as it deals with a highly integrated and socialized culture (Bunzel 1929). With respect to style, I should like to mention Meyer Scha- piro's article in Anthropology Today 1953). 6. Of course systematic field study on a large scale is a top priority. But is not the author a bit too optimistic? To my knowledge, reports from the areas she mentions are not very encouraging if one wants to study a culture as a func- tioning whole. According to Levi- Strauss (1953: 550): "Unfortunately the native cultures where we used to gather our data are disappearing at a fast rate, and what they are being replaced by can only furnish data of a very different type." This is valid as well for Navaho sandpaintings as for Tibetan butter- reliefs, leaving aside more permanent art-objects, which are gone too. 7. It seems to me highly important that Haselberger also includes the "tourist art," as this is almost always passed by in silence. To the cultural anthropologist, however, this art in the first place should be an opportunity to study acculturative processes as reflected by art. In this connection I should like to stress the utter necessity of a con- tinued penetrating study of modern American Indian painting in its ac- culturative context, and of similar art- forms in Africa and elsewhere. In this case all the necessary conditions and requirements, rightly stipulated by Haselberger, are still there. Against the background of the work already done, it is to be expected that the study of modern Pueblo and Navaho painting will also produce interesting psychologi- cal results. 8. In the above-mentioned connec- tion, the "art" of children should not be neglected. 9. With respect to the different pur- poses (functions) of art, as far as art for art's sake is concerned, attention may be drawn to the possibility of loss of function, which may result in an art for art's sake with almost purely recre- ational aspects. The admirable, sober but penetrating work of F. E. Williams deserves to be mentioned in this con- nection (Williams 1940: 414ff. and passim). 10. As to the content of art, mention might be made of the hypothesis that one of the main functions of sacral and religious art is the "filtering" of the world of the unseen, with the result that religious images etc. are communica- tion-signs or shorthand symbols. There- fore it does not matter whether re- ligious images are realistic or highly abstract. A religious image consists of or is one or more key stimuli. In this way man knows what to expect in his "second" ideological world, which, in itself evasive, is filtered and therefore stabilized. A careful deciphering of the key-stimuli is therefore necessary. It goes without saying that this is only possible within the context of the par- ticular culture (Sierksma 1960). 11. As an exemplary analysis of form and content, the studies of Levi-Strauss should have been mentioned (Levi- Strauss 1958: 269-94). 12. "Ethnological art is far too alive, too real and corporeal, to be subject to mere aesthetic laws." One should heartily agree with this statement, es- pecially when primitive art is compared with much of modern cubist etc. art. Nevertheless, primitive art may also be very abstract and yet full of meaning: Pueblo pottery, the Great Man and the Caribou God of the Naskapi, the v6v6 of the Voodoo cult, the Australian sa- cred patterns, etc. (Speck 1935: 83; Sierksma 1960: 19f.). 13. Although I myself am very much in favour of a psychological approach, where such an approach is possible and the cultural context is sufficiently known, I cannot but doubt whether "individual psychology and psychologi- cal typology promise good results." In the first place, "individual psychology" up till now in this field has produced very meagre results. In the second place, psychology still has not solved the prob- lem of the classification of constitu- tional types (there are almost as many classifications as psychologists). In the third place, very little is known about the relation between constitutional, psychological, and cultural differences. Why, for instance, are all Tchambuli men artists (Mead 1950: 164-89)? Also in this field the old question is still ir- ritating: Where does nature end, where does culture begin? 14. The examples of the wilful de- struction of art, given under "Ideology and Art," should rather be regarded as the results of acculturative self-agres- sion than as the effects of a world- conception of a society hostile to art. "Throw 'em away, those bloody New Guinea things"-a slogan of the Vailala Madness, recorded by Williams-is not an ideological protest against art as such, but agressive liquidation of the art which reminds people of a particu- lar society of their own inferiority as compared with what they experience as the superiority of the White man and his culture. 15. Differences of opinion-some of which have been formulated in this comment-are very often due to the fact that we don't know enough. As already mentioned, this is especially valid for the study of art, which is moreover in- sufficiently studied and difficult to grasp. Surely, therefore, we should take to heart the final sentences of Hasel- berger's article: thoroughly detailed studies should take precedence over generalizations. [Leiden, 20.2.61] By P. JAN VANDENHOUTE* In the absence of any discipline ac- credited with the ethnological study of the plastic arts, it is necessary to empha- size, prior to any discussion, the merits of Haselberger's endeavor. If, in our opinion, her "Method of Studying Ethnological Art" does not compensate for this lack of a well-founded method, this first attempt does raise a host of heterogeneous problems of varying im- portance, which demand above all a rea- soned systematization, a selection even more rigorous than that proposed by the author. This has an undeniable heu- ristic value. We have no intention here of listing or discussing this range of problems, which would take the greater part of a large volume. We- shall attempt only to rediscover some outline of essential ele- ments which, in our opinion, should govern a method for the ethnological study of the plastic arts. It is clear that, to avoid the dangers of foundering among ineffectual theo- ries, a rigorous clearing of the encum- bered ground should be undertaken for the sole aim of again finding the ele- mentary foundations of a formerly ana- lytical study of the work of art-and one bordering, through comparative meth- ods, upon an ethnological or anthropo- logical theory of the plastic arts. This would be as profitable for art history as for ethnology. Clearing the Ground A critical review of ethno-artistic lit- erature and research from the 19th cen- tury to the present day, starting with a systematic analysis of the opinions ex- pressed by art historians and ethnolo- gists as well as by the art critic, would undoubtedly give us the opportunity to reject a quantity of theories which are attractive but can no longer withstand criticism. Such an historical critique, which has not been written, would also point out that the rather severe judgment passed on ethnologists by L. Adam is fully jus- tified and has lost no value when turned against the art historians. Adam says (1958:115): Even today, most ethnologists, unless they have also studied the history of art, have an attitude of remarkable indifference and lack of understanding toward the ar- tistic qualities of primitive works. Aside from the discovery of gaps, such a systematic history will apprise us of a 374 CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY</page><page sequence="35">Haselberger : METHOD OF STUDYING ETHNOLOGICAL ART mass of other elements whose value is debatable and whose nature may ad- vance or confine the efficacy and clarity necessary for any method. Let us mark out, among these elements, terminol- ogy, the well-known source of a host of misunderstandings, and therefore a cru- cial starting point for a reciprocal re- adjustment between art history and ethnology-two sciences in the midst of rites de passage. Aside from the modus operandi et procedendi adopted, it is clear that these two sciences are in ur- gent need of a common language. This further implies that they will have to rid themselves of ideas about art which are based too much-not to say entirely- on Western art, an aspect of artistic cre- ation that is very important, but limited in space and time. An Example of Faulty Terminology: the Term "Aesthetic." We shall not discuss the term "eth- nological art," since Haselberger herself is sufficiently aware that this "working term" shares quite a few disadvantages with the dozen or so other terms re- quired by circumstances; rather, we shall turn to other terms that Hasel- berger believes herself empowered to use without defining their sense. An ex- ample is the word "aesthetic." It may be noted that the author, ap- parently indebted to art history more than to ethnology, gives this term a meaning that assimilates the aesthetic concept to that of beauty, thus linking the existence of art to the presence of beauty-to the "beautiful form"-and hence stipulating that an object "may be treated as an art object because of this aesthetic intention." "Non-aes- thetic factors-content and purpose" are contrasted with "the formal aes- thetic element," which evokes a trouble- some discussion concerning the aes- thetic functions of the work of art, and those functions of a non-aesthetic na- ture. It is, in short, a petitio principii! But Aesthetics must recognize the am- biguity of the concept of beauty and the beautiful as one of its major difficulties. As long as the aesthetic experience of a work of art is conceived as equivalent to the perception and appreciation of the beautiful, it will be difficult or even impossible for us to justify the use of the word "aesthetic" in an ethnological study, as well as in a sociology of art in general. Even if one attributes to this aesthetic experience the sense of a feel- ing of well-being, or the delight evoked by the work of art, or if one assumes by definition "a quality by which an object arouses disinterested pleasure in the person perceiving it" (Maquet 1954: 64), one scarcely conceals the nuances of this same equivalence of art and beauty. Although a great part of artistic pro- duction is thus excluded from ethno- artistic study, this assimilation of the concepts of art and beauty is not at all unusual in cultural anthropology: Ac- cording to Herskovits (1948:380, 413): Art is to be thought of as any embellish- ment of ordinary living that is achieved with competence and has describable form. . . . It is the expression of the de- sire for beauty. The experience of the beautiful is no more than a particular aspect of the aesthetic experience, properly speaking. The latter includes a quantity of other aspects, e.g. the experience of ugliness, of horror, of the hateful, of surprise, of the comic, the tragic, the religious, of clannish sentiments, etc., no two of which are mutually exclusive. Surely Aesthetics is concerned with recogni- tion of some modifications of the ex- perience of the beautiful! Let us retain the aesthetic experience in its proper sense, i.e., the perception of the work of art and the impressions, emotions, associations of ideas, im- pulses, and reactions that issue from it, without neglecting the experience of the beautiful, or even excluding a priori the experience of disinterested pleas- ure, however problematical. The Starting Point for an Ethnological Study of the Plastic Arts We hold the immediate object of the ethnology of art to be the study of works of art in space (all continents) and time (from prehistory to the pres- ent), and of the consequences of the aesthetic experience for the individual as well as the community (obviously in- cluding that of the artist or artists). In consequence of this precision, it is well to emphasize the importance of the cen- tral object, which is the work of art itself as the starting point for a method for the ethnological study of plastic arts. The work of art is by nature an en- tity in its form and content. Like hu- man culture, this particular entity specifies itself in those aspects of uni- versal nature of which a systematic anal- ysis seems to permit us to outline the framework of a method along several principal lines. It is necessary to emphasize Hasel- berger's merit in wishing to concentrate her method on a "detailed study of the work of art." Unfortunately, she has not succeeded in detaching the conse- quences which intrude before hurrying to a "mutual dependence and interac- tion of material, technique, purpose, content, and form," thus losing her way, in our opinion, in an unco-ordinated succession of ideas, concepts, and prob- lems. This is clearly incompatible' with the elementary principles of any meth- odology. The work of art, conceived as a par- ticular entity of form and content, calls for an initial distinction between these two aspects, of which one-the form-is by nature rather material and tangible, whereas the other-the content-is of a spiritual order. The interactions of these two aspects are multiple and com- plex, and are neither constant nor permanent. A more incisive analysis of the work of art, such as that made by Gotshalk (1947), allows us to distinguish as uni- versal aspects classed in organic order and making allowance for very complex interaction, the aspects of material, form, expression, and function. More- over, one or another of these aspects may take for itself a hypertrophied value, to the detriment of the other as- pects. It should be noted that these uni- versal aspects exist only as a function of the artist and the public. The Aspect of the Material The raw materials which the artist uses to make the aesthetic experience possible are by nature very divergent: coloring materials, grains, fibers, plumes, various types of wood, of metals, or of stone, clay, sand, ivory or bone, tortoise-shell, and many others. To these we may add raw materials of a quite different nature, such as the sounds, words, and movements which govern other forms of art and allow of other aesthetic experiences-which are not, however, as constantly conspicuous as those resulting from works of art of a plastic nature. The choice of any raw material by the artist is conditioned as much by physical environment as by the cultural (effective or non-effective appearance; purchase by distant markets; necessity of expeditions; conditions of a magical nature; etc.). The Aspect of Form The raw materials, which are form- less (although occasionally allowing some einfiihlung), integrate themselves into a new entity, especially a form, as a result of the directing ideas and tech- nical capacities of the person or persons who make the art object. Each raw material imposes its own laws, which are different for wood and for clay, different for brass or bronze, starting normally from a material that is soft and capable of being molded. The raw material is ultimately shaped ac- cording to the principles inherent in the nature of the work of art, i.e., by the principles of harmony, equilibrium, symmetry or asymmetry, and others. Vol. 2 - No. 4 - October 1961 375</page><page sequence="36">Thus the form exhibits readily percep- tible characteristics which enable one to define in a formal manner, by means of morphological analysis (or stylistic analysis), the morphological criteria pe- culiar to the plastic work of a single artist, or those characterizing the artistic creations used by a community of any order, or those of works occurring in some geographical area, or those of some early level of a culture. Comparative study of the morpholo- gies which show themselves in an ex- tremely rich variety will lead to classifi- cations into stylistic regions (horizontal or vertical), like those set up by Linton and Wingert (1946), Olbrechts (1946), Gerbrands (1950), Burssens (1958), and Maesen (1959), being rather applica- tions to the plastic arts of the "culture areas" of cultural anthropology. An- other stylistic classification, related to the sculpture of the Dan and Gere of the Ivory Coast (Vandenhoute 1948), should more closely approximate "cul- ture patterns" in specifying, not so much centers of style, as nuclear styles resulting from different artistic visions. It should be noted here that a study of the genesis of forms, which should en- gage all our attention, will also confront us with the interdependence of mor- phology and other aspects of the work of art as well as of the entire culture. The Aspect of Expression The form resulting from the techni- cal and spiritual activities of the artist should, by definition, permit an impres- sion of the whole. In short, it is the source from which spring the senti- ments, ideas, and associations of ideas, which are extremely varied and very un- stable, sometimes distinctly fixed or else completely unfixed. This subject is by nature delicate and not easily recogniz- able, especially in the present Western world, where it is more subjective than in those milieux studied in ethnology. If it is true that the expression inher- ent in the form of the work of art is one of the factors impregnating, to a certain extent, the aspect of function, it is no less true that the presence or absence of an empirical knowledge of the particu- lar use and the specific function of an artistic creation is an imperative factor of first importance, directing the conse- quences of an aesthetic experience. A Dan mask from the Ivory Coast amuses those who are aware of its proper func- tion, whereas others who lack this em- pirical knowledge will experience a feeling of anguish, while perhaps admir- ing the good technical qualities and the originality of the sculpture in wood. The Aspect of Function By definition, the work of art has its own ultimate fixed goal. The use of the artistic creation with the object of ac- complishing its proper task is called the functional aspect, which is moreover of primordial importance in ethnological study. Study of the use and function imme- diately raises the question of the pres- ence of the work of art and, even more, that which we have called its functional content (Vandenhoute 1960). The ethnography of some peoples shows us that the presence of the work of art may be real, and even of an effec- tive permanence with respect to the aesthetic experience; or a presence that is of short duration, or cyclical; or a presence that is effective but invisible and very spiritual in nature. It may hap- pen that the work of art is strictly re- served for those persons who are suf- ficiently qualified. Having called attention to the spe- cific presence of the work of art in re- spect to means of communication or cultural reality, it becomes necessary to mark that which we call the functional content, i.e., a purport of ideas or im- pressions, of sensations or impulses, ex- perienced in a precise or a vague fashion by the person or persons who use the work of art in some manner. These sen- timents and impulses of which the motive is considered present (among others, by the expression of the form brought about by means of the mate- rial), or is imposed as a result of various events or circumstances, do not always depend on the motif made by the artist, nor on expression, and need not neces- sarily accord with the aim and the in- tentions that the artist planned at the time of the realization of his work. Hence the aesthetic experience of the expression inherent in the form may be, by nature, completely opposite in two individuals or groups of individuals, of which the one is conscious of functional content, and the other is not. Knowledge of functional content and the breadth, in the user, of that knowl- edge of events which condition the mo- tif which provokes stability or changes in the personal or social behavior of the individual, allow us finally to set off the cultural (or social) function at the same time as the artistic role of the work of art in question. An ancestor figurine buried beneath the house effectively fulfills its cultural function for those who are conscious of the invisible presence and those who have had the aesthetic experience with- out this being able to recur. The ethnologist who undertakes the study of art must not ignore the differ- ent aspects, nor the multiple and com- plex interactions of those aspects which finally result in a particular entity of form and content, and as such makes it impossible to isolate the functional as- pect of an artistic creation. Note here that the function of the work of art is not always constant or permanent. The function may, on the other hand, determine the choice of raw material as much as it may impel the artist to the creation of a form adapted to some practical use arising from the function. Yet in realizing a creation, the artist is not always conscious of the eventual use or the future functional content of his work. The presence of a monoxyl socle un- der a large Senufo anthropomorphic figurine could well derive from its use as a pestle by means of which one strikes the soil to promote the fertility of the earth or to invite the dead to as- sist in some ceremony (Holas 1957). In a study concerned with art and so- ciety (Vandenhoute 1960), from which we have reproduced here some conclu- sions, we attempted a functional analy- sis of a ridge sculpture of the Bapende of Kasai (Central Africa). Conclusions Starting with these few essential premises, it seems to us possible to at- tempt a provisional systematization, based primarily on a method centered on the work of art: A. ANALYTICAL 1. Morphological analysis and classification of the work of art in space and in time (stylistic critique), which comprises the field work sui generis in the private col- lections, the museums, and the litera- ture. Moreover, we think that it is of great urgency that the museums publish, if not detailed studies, at least icono- graphic archives, annotated with the data at their disposal. 2. Functional analysis and classification of works of art. 3. Practical method of field work of the ethnology of art: a) the work of plastic art b) the artist (male or female): -as a member of a cultural commu- nity; -relations with his colleagues; -initiation to his craft -technology -as a creative personality c) the user of the work of plastic art. It is worth noting that a practical method of field work should preferably be based on vertical studies in depth and should, through extreme flexibility, aim at stimulating the initiative of the qualified researcher with a view to the discovery of unknown facets. B. SYNTHETIC An ethnological method for the mor- phological and functional study of the plastic arts should give rise to an ethnologi- cal or anthropological theory of plastic arts in general, and ultimately permit an adequate comparison with Western arts and those of the Eastern world. Let us emphasize, finally, one of Haselberger's conclusions: "Many tasks await future research. P rchent. 1.3.611 376 CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY</page><page sequence="37">Haselberger : METHOD OF STUDYING ETHNOLOGICAL ART By JAMES WALTON* In attempting to find a convenient ti- tle to cover the subject of this study, Haselberger uses the term "ethnological art," in which "ethnological" is given a restricted meaning by definition. By ex- tending such a usage to "ethnological peoples," we arrive at a term which is not only awkward but also etymologi- cally and grammatically unsound, and which is adequately covered by the sim- ple word "folk." The objections put for- ward against "folk" are based on false premises resulting from an incorrect usage of the word. "Folk art" does not denote "everything not belonging to high art or higher applied arts," nor does it require a marked social stratifi- cation for its existence. Writing of "folk song" and "folk dance," Fox-Strangways stated (The Observer, June 19, 1938), 'Folk' means 'all human beings'. You are a member of the folk, so am I. 'The folk' never meant 'yokels'; these . . . were the 'lewde men' as opposed to 'lettred men'. There is ample evidence that what was sung and danced in Langland's day was the same for all, and that in these occupations, castle and cottage met on equal footing; and though dame of high degree made one thing of them and serving-maid quite an- other, yet both shared one fancy and moved to one rhythm, as their modern counter- parts may. To this statement lorwerth Peate adds, "Though this quotation refers specifi- cally to folk-song and folk-dance it is universally true of folk life." In his Presidential Address to the British Association for the Advance- ment of Science in 1958, Peate stated that some American anthropologists cloud the issue by differentiating between folk and urban, and folk and peasant, communities. When such special meanings are given ar- bitrarily to the term folk, the exposition of our study is reduced to incoherence. The study of folk life, as I see it, is the study of the way of life of communities and of nations which are comparatively unaffected by a high degree of industrialization.... But there is no exclusion of any class within the community. In 1952 at the inaugural meeting of the Vernacular Architecture Group the term "vernacular" was adopted in place of the more usual "folk," but it is not a term which has been widely accepted- although it is gaining ground and is used by Conant in his Carolingian and Romanesque Architecture, 800 to 1200 (1959). I feel, however, that the terms "folk art" and "folk building," used in the true sense of the word as employed by Fox-Strangways, Peate, and Erixon, would have adequately described the subject of Haselberger's study. The scope of the paper seems too wide for the available space, resulting in the inevitable generalization. Unless great care is taken, such generalization can easily lead to inaccuracy; and there are a number of cases where this has arisen. A typical instance is afforded by the statement: While studying African murals, I was able to distinguish a men's and a women's style. Women restrict themselves to secular abstract decorations, which sometimes in- clude highly stylized human figures, musi- cal instruments, tools, etc. They use only the three traditional colours of Negto Africa, black, red, and white. Although this statement may be true for a certain part of West Africa, it can- not be applied to "African murals" in general. The Ndebele and Sotho women of South Africa use whatever local ochres are available, and with the in- troduction of washing blue and enamel paints a full range of colours is em- ployed. Nor do the women restrict themselves to "secular abstract decora- tions," although these are by far the most common. Nevertheless, there are a number of instances of Sotho women decorating their hut walls with natural- istic representations of animals (Walton 1958). By attempting to cover such a wide field, other inaccurate impressions are given, due to the author's lack of knowl- edge of the relevant literature. A case in point is the sentence, "The bark, mud, or wood murals of ethnological peoples in Africa ... have seldom been investi- gated and are rather undervalued." But our knowledge of African parietal art is by no means restricted to the works of Cory, Haselberger, and Redinha. A con- siderable amount of work has been car- ried out among the Berbers, notably by Paris but also by Terrasse, Adam, Jacques-Meuni6, and many others. Simi- larly, the mural art of Uganda has been studied by Margaret Trowell (1953), and in South Africa much has been re- corded of the wall paintings of the Ndebele and Sotho-Tswana (see Walton 1948-1949; 1956). A further example is afforded by the statement that "research on architec- ture, with a few exceptions (Beguin et al. 1952; Engestrom 1957; Glick 1956, Phillips 1952, 1955) has been confined to ethnological, economic, or sociologi- cal problems." This completely ignores the work of Terrasse, Paris, Adam, and Jacques-Meunie in the Atlas; of Des- pois, Bernard, and Crawford in Tunisia; of Rathjens in Yemen and Syria; of Ling Roth and Goodwin at Benin; of Margaret Trowell in Uganda; and my own work during the past 15 years in Southern Africa. These are but a few studies of folk building, all of which fall within the field of Haselberger's paper. A glance at the bibliographies compiled by the Building Research Station of the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research and the Vernacular Architec- ture Group will quickly demonstrate that our knowledge of folk building is not so meagre as Haselberger would have us believe. These comments are not intended to detract from the importance of Hasel- berger's main theme, namely the urgent necessity for detailed studies of folk art and folk building, but merely to stress the dangers in attempting to cover such a wide field. There is undoubtedly a very real need for such studies, and the lines of approach and projects which she outlines emphasize the enormous gaps which still exist in our knowledge of these subjects. There are many points on which I should like to comment, but in particu- lar I wish to support Haselberger's con- tention that certain "ethnological peo- ples" do paint murals simply for the aesthetic pleasure which they provide. The traditional home of the Southern Sotho was a thatched beehive hut which afforded no opportunity for decoration. When the Sotho adopted the cone-on- cylinder dwelling they almost immedi- ately began to decorate the mud walls with finger patterns, with different col- oured ochres, or with mosaic patterns. The latter were introduced by the Taung, who stuck pebbles in the mud wall to protect it from the rain. Ulti- mately they arranged the pebbles in de- lightful mosaic patterns which were quickly copied by the neighbouring tribes. I have questioned hundreds of Sotho women, both young and old, as to the meaning or significance of their pat- terns but they invariably reply, "They have no meaning; we just produce what- ever pattern we feel will make the hut look beautiful"; and I have been unable to find any evidence to indicate that these wall decorations had any other source of origin. [Rondebosch, Unionz of South Africa, 1.3.61] By GENE WELTFISH* The proposal here made that the ethnologist and the art historian de- velop "a combined approach" in the field of ethno-art is a very welcome one, particularly to an ethnologist for whom art study has been mainly a function of ethno-genesis and ethno-dynamic, and who has looked with envy at the time depth and the vast materials "on the other side." As an ethnologist it would seem to me that if this approach is to illuminate the field of "aesthetic intent" and expression to include all mankind. Vol. 2 No. 4 * October 1961 377</page><page sequence="38">we ourselves need to develop a renewed awareness of our own cultural biases. Fine arts as here defined and in the main as we have studied them-"archi- tecture . . . ; painting and drawing; sculpture; arts and crafts . . ."-are lim- ited to certain concrete material objects. From an ethnological point of view, this study thus becomes a function of material culture, albeit serving aesthetic intent and expression. Material culture is the cultural expression of man's transaction with the material world and this is by no means given, but takes varying ethnic forms. In our culture, the material aspect can with some defi- niteness be categorized into "with or without aesthetic intent," or perhaps utilitarian and non-utilitarian; but for the tribesman in his more limited polity, the impulse to aesthetic expression in- trudes itself more often into his daily activities and material concerns than it does among ourselves. Moreover, the balance of aesthetic media in a tribe is different from our own. In a tribal set- ting the whole people are generally more active participants in such aes- thetically-oriented activities as the dance, music, drama, and story, while our people are extensive users and col- lectors of material things-a group ex- perience that reflects itself in our con- centration on the material arts as here exemplified. Further, in our fine-arts tradition, the general cultural context is for us more or less understood. This is not the case with the ethno-arts. In a study of ethno- art, the aesthetic intent of the object requires more knowledge than can be obtained by closely observing its mate- rial and its form, or even by a compari- son with other (to us) seemingly similar objects. Whether they come from an archeological or an ethno-historical source, we are not in a position to study them in the same isolation from their cultural matrix as the fine-arts objects of our culture or even their antecedents in a more direct line. As for comparability of data in terms of their materiality, objects made of the same materials do not in themselves give us an obvious basis for comparison, or even what we consider to be analo- gous forms. Malinowski in his study of the Trobriand Islanders gives us an ex- ample of an object that would ordi- narily be classified as a stone axe. How- ever it is neither made of stone (but of volcanic tuff), nor is it an axe (but a gardening implement). Plutonic stone, which the Trobrianders do have, is im- ported from the south and is named "imported." The "axe" is called kema, the name of the tuff. As we get more insight into other people's lives, the "solid rock" upon which our knowledge can rest is no longer so definite. Mate- rial culture, in the sense of the cultural expression of a tribal group's transac- tion with the material world, is one of the least developed fields of ethnology. As a people who have passed historically from an outlook on materiality as inert mass, to Newton's gravity, to Einstein's atom and relative time, and to modern matter and anti-matter, we can hardly overlook the ethnic variability of our material culture. In this emphasis upon ethnic varia- bility in all aspects of human experi- ence, I do not mean to imply that peo- ple living in tribal polities are groups apart, as has too often been presumed, sometimes for status reasons. The break- ing of this trend as represented in Has- elberger's summary of African art his- tory is a major contribution to our field. It is certainly very unlikely that there was ever a human group at any time that was an isolate, however limited communication may have been at one period or another. But the question still remains of what defines and delimits a people as a distinctive "ethnos"-a classification that must be subsumed under any study of their aesthetic cul- ture. Ruth Benedict's "Patterns of Cul- ture" approach was initially stimulated by studies of ethno-art such as Boas had made. If, Benedict reasoned, there are such clearly identifiable art styles from the different ethnic groups, this must be a function of general "life styles." I think their characterization is still a ma- jor object of ethnology. Like Hasel- berger for art, I should like to see such "life styles" defined concretely and scientifically. And being very much a product of my culture, I give materiality a high value in such a study, based on the assumption that the history of man's transaction with the material (as borne out by recent prehistoric findings) is the most continuous in time and space of all aspects of human experience, and that it can furnish the student of man- kind with the most universal of all cul- tural "languages." But the elements of its universality remain to be uncovered against the background of its cultural variants and changes over time. If the field of ethno-art is to enrich our knowledge of the universals of aes- thetic intent and expression, then we cannot rest on the idea that if we con- fine ourselves to the field of material arts, we can take the material aspect for granted as cross-cultural "safe ground." Further, when we apply such a limita- tion to a people whose aesthetic par- ticipation is heavier in the fields of dance, music, drama, and myth than in that of the "art object," we are matching our major aesthetic interest with what, among most other peoples, receives less emphasis-getting a distorted view of their aesthetic values. African art, in which the visual arts are a comparatively minor aspect of the whole aesthetic cul- ture of the people, is a notable example. The student of any given aspect of ethno-art must constantly keep in view its place within the setting of all the other arts, and the culture "style" of the people whose aesthetic intent it ex- presses. The ethnologist who achieves some bridging of the gaps of culture pattern or style, however, does discover the many facets of the common human in the course of his work, even though it is his yet unresolved and difficult task to define and portray it. Being an intellec- tual in the nature of the case, as Him- melheber has so well shown, he encoun- ters artists and fellow-minds in most of the cultural settings he enters, be they in the Arctic or in the tropics. One might well parallel Himmelheber's ex- perience in most cultures. The Pomo Indian woman of a food-gathering tribe of central California has reached the epitome of technical skill in a rare art. Into her coiled basket she sews a de- sign that has nothing to do with the mechanics of the technique and is con- ceptually so separate for her that, in dis- regard of the form limits of the basket, the design seems to just float spirally beyond the rim into space. Her Yurok sister some miles to the north used com- parable techniques and the same design elements and formal arrangements, but she puts her design neatly fitted to the object. This Yurok basket-maker artist we are told, in an all too familiar mode, chases the children out of the hut while she works so that she can concentrate on her aesthetic problems, measuring, con- sidering, and contemplating. The Pomo Indian woman makes one fine master- piece of her technical virtuosity and de- sign creativity, on which she works all her life so that it may be burned on her funeral pyre. Art and artists are every- where, and art is as implicit in man as mind. For all our cultural variability, communication is eminently possible for people of knowledge and good will, and I think the study of ethno-art will not only enrich our knowledge of art, but will deepen our understanding of what is really human. As we now stand, a more creative vision of our species would not be unwelcome. [New York, 28.2.61] By ANTHONY WHITTY* The method of study outlined in this article seems to me to be applicable over a wider field than "ethnological art." The principles of analysing an ob- ject into readily apprehensible abstrac- tions such as material, technique, pur- pose, form, and content; of research into the biography of the artist (maker); and of study of objects in the whole 378 CURRENT ANTHROPOL OGY</page><page sequence="39">Haselberger: METHOD OF STUDYING ETHNOLOGICAL ART structure of a culture are all applicable and relevant to artifacts lying outside the defined field. Whether or not a Pygmy wind screen can be regarded as architecture, it is nevertheless suscepti- ble to analysis and classification by these means and can significantly be com- pared with, say, a simple hut which qualifies as architecture. From the point of view of the historian or the prehis- torian, the precise boundary between art and not-art is merely of academic in- terest. To the student of art this bound- ary is necessary as providing a limit to his field of research. But the detection, through an artifact, of the maker's aes- thetic intention, or the absence of such intention (leaving aside the question of its success or failure) is open in a great number of cases to very wide differences of opinion. This boundary must be un- real and arbitrary. A vehicle of aesthetic expression, be it in the form of architec- ture, painting, sculpture, or, indeed, of any humanly-made artifact, must have had its cultural origins below the threshold of art so-defined. Moreover there are countless objects belonging to artistic traditions which have degener- ated to levels which cannot be regarded as art. Such objects, of either kind, are suitable material for Haselberger's method, which is logically valid, I think, in the wide field of "all artifacts." It is evident that no such analytical method can elicit from its subject- matter the real essence of "art," any more than a structural dissection will describe the essence of a Bach fugue. Of all the factors which go to make up a work of art, the one which inexorably evades this method (or any objective method) is that which contributes the very quality of art. The method doesn't deal in the subject. It merely deals with certain abstracted attributes of an ob- ject of art, attributes which may be com- mon also to humanly-made objects of not-art. It therefore seems to me that within the limiting definition of "Ethnological Art" the function of this method must remain chiefly classificatory, but that when freed from that limitation it be- comes a potentially important tool for the study of significant rhythms in hu- man history. [Borrowdale, Southern Rhodesia, 1.3.61] By FRANK WILLETT* This paper evokes a number of com- ments on the topics upon which it touches. In the first place, since the au- thor rejects the word primitive and uses ethnological instead, may I play the advocatus diaboli and suggest that we retain the word primitive in our vo- cabulary? No attempts to find substi- tutes for the word have been successful, and no single word seems capable of bearing the meaning which primitive has acquired through many decades of admitted misuse by anthropologists. The objections to this word fall into two main groups: (a) it does not coin- cide with the dictionary meaning of the word; and (b) it is objectionable to the people to whom it is applied. Now when primitive was first used of pre- literate European societies, it was gen- uinely thought that these societies did represent primitive stages of social evo- lution. Therefore at that time the usage coincided with the dictionary meaning. As anthropological studies have pro- gressed, it has been discovered that the dictionary meaning of the word no longer applies to these societies, but the word has continued in use, being rede- fined from time to time, so that al- though as used by anthropologists it no longer has its dictionary meaning, this is because the dictionaries have not kept up to date with this particular semantic change. We all know well enough what we all mean by primitive societies and primitive art-the art and societies studied by anthropologists. I would sug- gest that the length of time that the word primitive has been used in this sense by anthropologists justifies its re- tention, and calls for an additional definition in the dictionaries. The emo- tional associations which make the word objectionable would be transferred to any other word which was used to re- place it, just as the stigma attached in England to elementary schools still sticks to the secondary modern schools which have replaced them. It is, of course, legitimate to circum- vent the use of the word primitive by the use of other words appropriate to the context; one can for example speak of traditional sculpture of the Yoruba or of the Kwakiutl, even though "tradi- tional art" cannot be considered a suit- able substitute for "primitive art." Haselberger remarks "Works of art are therefore distinguished from purely utilitarian objects by the aesthetic in- tention." How are we to distinguish this aesthetic intention when the maker of the object is not present, or when the specimen is already in the museum? Le Corbusier has taught us that suitability to purpose is an aesthetic quality, though museum ethnographers ought not to have needed the lesson. If the form of an object is pleasing, it can be treated as an object of art in European terms, but not necessarily in the terms of the society which produced it. This is comparable to a European artist's ad- miring a work of primitive art for the (ethnologically) wrong reasons. It is a permissible form of aesthetic apprecia- tion, though not of the most profitable kind. It is true that architecture and paint- ing are frequently ignored in studies of primitive art, presumably because most of these studies have been done on mu- seum collections, not in the field. Wall paintings and buildings are not easily collected for transfer to a museum, al- though it can sometimes be done. Haselberger says that "tourist art ... should not be neglected by the art in- vestigator," and that "tourist art . . . sometimes has aesthetic importance (Forman and Fagg, 1959)." The Afro-Portuguese ivories are very exceptional examples of tourist art, which usually even at its best is more valuable as an example of craftsman- ship than of art. At best the execution is good, but there is usually no original- ity either of expression of emotion, or of conception of the subject. This is be- cause it is made, not to please the makers within their own traditional culture, but to please the tourist with his own standards which are entirely ir- relevant to the maker's situation. Tour- ist art is thus more important as a phenomenon of culture contact, than as art. The harmony of European forms treated in an African manner which characterizes the Afro-Portuguese ivo- ries is occasionally still found in works commissioned by Europeans from a tra- ditional artist, when the artist is left completely free to execute the work in his own way and is not shown pictures of European works he is intended to copy. In such a case the artist needs suf- ficient freedom to create the work as if it were intended for use in his own cultural setting, and this sets it aside from true tourist art, which I take to be objects made on speculation, for future sale, and intended to appeal to the (usu- ally bad) taste of the tourist. "Ethnological peoples today seldom have the means or desire to preserve the art of their past." One wonders whether they ever did have the means or the de- sire. In many parts of Africa carved masks are permitted to rot after being used only once; indeed, in some cases it is considered essential that they should do so. Among the Yoruba, carv- ings such as verandah posts and shrine figures were not preserved but replaced when they decayed, and the new carv- ings were considered to be the old ones, even when they were appallingly bad copies. Occasionally carvings were cared for, especially twin figures (ibeji), not for aesthetic but for religious reasons. The problem of satisfactory photo- graphic recording of art in the field is indeed very important. "Photographs should show the object as it ordinarily Vol. 2 No. 4 - October 1961 379</page><page sequence="40">appears," but many objects are kept in near darkness, and photographs of ob- jects in normal surroundings can often be extremely unenlightening. At the same time over-dramatic lighting needs to be avoided since even if it does not "show qualities that in reality do not lie within the object," it does emphasize the photographer's interpretation of the object. The middle way between a flat, uninteresting, uninformative pho- tograph and a dramatic, startling, but misleading photograph is often hard to find. The difficulty is not that the camera cannot lie, but to persuade it to tell the truth. Art for art's sake is probably an im- portant element in all great art. If the art object is intended for utilitarian, ritual, educational, commercial or social purposes, a lower standard than the best would be sufficient, but the good artist surpasses the "good enough" standard chiefly for his own satisfaction as an artist. The finest cave paintings of the Upper Palaeolithic seem to have satis- fied the artists in this way. "A description of the use and purpose of art objects can help determine the time and place of their manufacture." This is true where the objects are still in their primary social setting, but in the case of one of the most important groups of art objects in Africa, namely those of Ife, the present use and purpose are quite clearly unrelated to the origi- nal use and purpose (cf. Murray and Willett 1958; Willett 1960). Moreover, in the case of excavated art objects, we may be able to discover the time and place of their manufacture, but not be able to establish their use and purpose. In interpreting the content of primi- tive art, oral sources collected at the same time as the object itself are more important than the written accounts of similar pieces. The process which Hasel- berger describes reads like a technique of investigating undocumented speci- mens in museum collections, which have a secondary value in comparison with well-documented specimens col- lected in the field. In publications de- scribing art objects this distinction should be made, so that secondary evi- dence may not be mistaken for primary, and so that erroneous interpretations may not be indefinitely proliferated. The content of two art objects repre- senting similar forms may not be iden- tical. Figures of men on horseback ap- pear in Yoruba shrines to many gods; because one is recorded in the literature as representing a worshipper of a par- ticular god, it does not by any means follow that other carvings of the same kind have this same meaning. I wonder how valuable these opposed pairs listed on p. 846 are in the study of ethnological art. Are they not perhaps comprised in Fagg's remark "The prog- ress made by our art critics in develop- ing verbal techniques to match the non- verbal arts of their own culture holds out little hope . . . indeed most of those who have written from an aes- thetic point of view on African sculp- ture have succeeded only in interposing an opaque screen of largely irrelevant verbiage between it and the student" (Elisofon and Fagg 1958a:25)? For ex- ample, the concept of frontality and space-depth seems to me to be irrelevant in primitive art. If an object is intended to be seen frontally it will be essentially two-dimensional-e.g. a piece of cloth, a painted wall, a carved door. If it is sculptured in the round it may not be intended to be viewed from all possible angles (particularly from the back), but it will not be intended to be seen from only one view-point. The doors carved by the Yoruba Olowe of Ise, Ekiti (a pair in the British Museum are illus- trated in Joyce and Braunholtz 1925, Plate XV), show a remarkable blending of both these concepts, for although ar- ranged as a two-dimensional pattern the individual elements need to be seen from many angles to be appreciated, for most of his figures lean out from the door and are carved in the round. On a door at the palace in Ilesha he has carved a palm wine tapster climbing a palm tree which grows out clear of the door! There are other cases where works by the one hand and therefore in the same tribal style may show either fron- tality or space-depth, e.g. Bamgboye, the carver of the Epa mask illustrated on Plate XV of Fagg 1960, also carves flat decorative trays. It is rarely in primitive art that we have any independent evidence to show whether an object belongs to the begin- ning, the climax, or the end of a devel- opment; whether it is a pioneering, a mature, or a late work of a particular style. This is possible in the early higher civilizations, when works of art were made in durable materials. It is possible in the case of Benin, but here it has to be based on assumptions and internal evidence rather than on proven inde- pendent facts. The few Yoruba pieces at Ulm, collected before 1650, seem to be no different in style from those of three centuries later; yet we rarely have such early examples of art in perishable ma- terials, and our study of development has to be restricted to the last 5 or 10 decades, during which usually only a decline can be observed. On the other hand it is sometimes possible to estab- lish stages in the development of the style of an individual artist, though even this is sometimes more difficult than one would expect. The artist often cannot remember when he made a piece, and sometimnes cannot recognize his own work, or will claim, as his own, work by another hand. On one occasion I got three apprentice carvers who were working under a Yoruba master carver to group together the pieces which each of them had carved so that I might find out whether they had yet developed styles of their own. They had, and I was able, much to their surprise, to point out pieces which they themselves had attributed to the wrong carver. Yet these carvings had been made during the few weeks immediately preceding my visit. Anthropologists have been pained by the use which well-intentioned psychol- ogists have made of their data. Let us not treat them in the same way. There is a very great danger in amateurism in psychological interpretation. Hasel- berger remarks that psychological "re- search is in such flux that we must time and again adapt ourselves to the latest position." Surely then, if psychology and psychoanalysis are to contribute to the study of primitive art, it is better that the work should be done by pro- fessionally trained psychologists. Most ethnographers working in the field would be severely handicapped if they had to carry a psychiatrist's couch around in their loads! It would be interesting if Haselberger would explain her statement that "to- day painting-an art introduced only 30 years ago-best represents the artistic abilities of the African Negro." It would appear by this that she means the Euro- pean kind of painting taught in schools with oil and water-colours on canvas or paper. Is not this a thing apart from ethnological art, and strictly a phenom- enon of European art? Such Nigerian artists as Ben Enwonwu and Felix Idubor have their place in European art-history not strictly in the history of traditional African art, for such tradi- tional elements as appear in their sculp- tures or paintings are used in the same way as Picasso and Matisse used them when African art was first revealed to them-a valid use, but one divorced from African tradition. "This so-called Nok Culture" (why so-called?) is not represented in any European museum unless by plaster casts. I can find no statement in the original edition (Elisofon and Fagg 1958a) which could have given this im- pression. "The ceramic finds noted by David- son" may serve to date the cultures of Benin and Yorubaland, but not to date the art objects themselves, unless, as seems highly unlikely, the waste moulds of bronzes are found at the casting sites in association with domestic pottery. These moulds are extremely friable in all the modern bronze-casting I have seen in Africa and would almost cer- 380 CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY</page><page sequence="41">Haselberger : METHOD OF STUDYING ETHNOLOGICAL ART tainly disintegrate rapidly and disap- pear from the archaeological record. [Ife, Nigeria, 8.3.61] Reply By HERTA HASELBERGER I am content that my imperfect and risky attempt to call attention to prob- lems of method in the field of ethnolog- ical art has brought a response from my more competent colleagues. I am grate- ful for the corrections of errors offered by several authorities, and was particu- larly satisfied with the interesting com- ments by Blackwood, Carpenter, B. and W. Fagg, Fenton, Fraser, Inverarity, Klausen, Sierksma, Walton, and others, which widened the area covered by this article by introducing information about little-known peoples and geo- graphical areas, as well as valuable new ideas. The tentative attempts by Alt- man and Vandenhoute to develop their own interesting ideas on methods of art investigation among ethnological peo- ples go far beyond what one would ex- pect from a simple comment, and speak for themselves. Lacking time, I cannot comment in detail on all the points that have been raised, but shall limit this reply to those that follow: 1. The terms primitive, tribal, tradi- tional, native, indigenous, folk, and popular art are, as Anati and other com- mentators state, good terms for describ- ing specific kinds of art, when they are properly used. But none of them exactly circumscribes the art-area under discus- sion here. Most of the commentators disagree with the expression "ethnologi- cal art." I am well aware that this term is anemic, and that it may be etymolog- ically and grammatically unsound; but I cannot see that any of the newly pro- posed terms, such as "pre-industrial" or "non-European tribal" art are more convincing. For this reason, I think it best to stand by "ethnological art." (May I parenthetically tell my friend W. Fagg that I am alone responsible for this term; Gerbrands [1950] speaks of "non-European art.") But my sympathies are with those commentators who, like Altman, La- vachery, Lommel, and Sierksma, are of the opinion that we already possess so many data on art styles among ethno- logical peoples that we no longer need a common name for this art-area, even as a working term. Their view will cer- tainly prove to be correct within a few years. 2. The definition of art given on p. 342 was simplified and was not in- tended to be definitive. But who can, as some commentators wished me to, give a perfect definition of "art" in a few sentences? 3. I am very grateful to Walton for his citing some of the authors who are working on traditional African architec- ture. As I have learned from Mr. 0. Davies, of Legon University College, Ghana, and as B. Fagg noted in his com- ment, an architect, M. Z. R. Dmochow- ski, is studying traditional architecture in Nigeria. Moreover, the Vernacular Architecture Group, whose work was exhibited at the Paris Congress of An- thropological and Ethnological Sciences in 1960, does much work in this field. Nevertheless, I maintain that research on the architecture of non-literate peo- ples is insufficient and often unsatisfac- tory. 4. I agree with Klausen and Vanden- houte that there is a very urgent need for a set of well-defined terms and clari- fying definitions that will allow us to discuss aesthetics, art, and style without too much misunderstanding. However, I think that this terminology is a task for the student of philosophy rather than for an anthropologist. 5. Nooteboom argues that the pieces of finest quality among objects of eth- nological art are those whose "content" reflects in the highest degree the total conception of the people's culture and universe. But frequently a paddle or a comb will be found to be a better and more important piece of work than an image representing the paramount god of the group. 6. Klausen objects to the term "style- criticism." To me, however, form-anal- ysis and style-criticism seem synony- mous. Style-criticism, used as a method by an art-historian, is never value- oriented and means simply "analysis of style." I must disagree with Klausen and other anthropologists who believe that art historians do not separate pure description of an art object from value judgment. The first thing learned, at least at Vienna University, by a student of art history (which is simply an his- torical science) is that he must abso- lutely abstain from any value judgment. Such judgments are left to the philos- ophers and the art critics. 7. Archey cites monuments of Oce- anic art, e.g. Maori palisade and gate- way statues and the well-known stone statues from Easter Island, which he re- gards as examples of "optical concep- tion," as explained on p. 358. The question is whether there really is an "optical conception" in these statues, or whether their great size only gives the impression of such a conception. In any case, the problem needs further investi- gation. 8. In the section "History of African Art," my concern was to illustrate my assumption that it is already possible to write the history of art among ethnolog- ical peoples; I did not intend to give new data about African art history. To all those who wish to do field re- search on art during the next years, I can recommend Nigeria as a fortunate country where a number of valuable art traditions seem to have remained intact, if I correctly interpret the comments of those who are authorities on Nigerian tribal arts. Finally, I hope that this article has stimulated discussion of the methods of ethnological art-investigation, and that one of the authorities in this field-per- haps Vandenhoute-will soon present us with an adequate method for the study of art in the field of anthropology.
