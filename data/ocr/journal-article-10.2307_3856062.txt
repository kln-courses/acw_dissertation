Proceed- ings of a meeting of the Research Seminar in Archaeology and Related Subjects held at the Institute of Archaeology, London University. Duckworth, London, 1969. Pp. xxvi+58i; pls. 8. Price Â£7. 7s. This formidable inter-disciplinary symposium expounds and discusses the problems, conceptual and methodological, of the study of the great adaptive shifts in food production that were seminal in the growth of civilizations. Its scope is very wide. In Part I the environmental background and patterns of exploitation are considered. Part II considers methods of investigation of the domestication of plants and animals from a diversity of genetical, palynological, phylogenetic, archaeological, physical anthropological, ethnographical, and historical standpoints. Part III comprises studies of regional and local evidence for domestication, while Part IV deals with the history of the domestication of particular groups of animals. Part V contains general studies of human nutrition, and the book ends with reflections on the significance of domestication by Professor Piggott. While these papers range over four continents and fifteen millennia and more, the work's central concern is with the origins of agriculture and animal domestication in the Near East. They illustrate how great has been the access of knowledge on these subjects during the past twenty years; but more, they show how vital is the contribution of natural scientific disciplines to their interpretation, and how important are the con- tributions that the archaeologist and historian can make in the provision of evidence of value to scientists. Certain remarkable contributions, in particular those of Harris, Hawkes, Zohary, Darlington, and Flannery, show vividly the need for most of us to revise our assumptions and conceptions of what the 'neolithic revolution' comprised. Indeed, the work presents a special challenge for Egyptologists; for it shows clearly how far studies of early agriculture, domestication of animals, irrigation, and the origins of communal and urban life in Egypt lag behind those in the rest of the Near East. No doubt the physical character of the Nile valley, where basin irrigation has been practised on an annual silt deposit for millennia, poses special practical and methodological problems. But the importance of surveying for and discovering sites, and above all of providing properly stratified and statistically adequate bone, seed, pollen, and dung samples stands out-more especially as the effect on such material remains of the new irrigation regime introduced by the Sudd el-'Ali is uncertain. This, then, is a remarkable work, to which justice cannot be done in a brief notice. There are at least a dozen papers which are directly relevant to ancient Egypt and its Near Eastern neighbours, many of which contain new or uncollected material, and for these alone the book should stand on all Egyptological shelves; but it is best read as a whole, for only thus does one attain a full understanding of this many-sided evolu- tionary and social topic. The editors deserve the greatest credit for the very large administrative effort that the organization of this seminar must have involved, and for their modest, scrupulous, and accurate editing; but even greater thanks for conceiving the idea of this fruitful meeting. The publishers have produced the book most handsomely, and in remarkably quick time, since the seminar was only held in May 1968. H. S. SMITH Anthropomorphic Figurines of Predynastic Egypt and Neolithic Crete with Comparative Material from the Prehistoric Near East and Mainland Greece. By PETER J. UCKO. Andrew Szmidla, London. Pp. xvi+530; 195 figs., 77 pls. Price 36. 6s. The author has long been concerned with predynastic or prehistoric figurines and, in this book, offers the results of his studies. Predynastic figurines from Egypt, some excavated and some bought (those which the</page><page sequence="2">REVIEWS I99 author takes to be authentic), neolithic figurines from Crete, as many as the author could trace, and, a rather arbitrary selection of neolithic figurines from other Near Eastern regions and from Greece, have been brought together in a catalogue in which each figurine is described, and most also illustrated in line-drawings and in photographic plates. It is difficult to give in a line-drawing a satisfactory picture of a statuette in the round. The drawings in Ucko's book certainly have not succeeded. Even if one knows the figurines fairly well, it is often difficult to make out what is represented in a particular line-drawing. For those less well acquainted with the originals, many of the drawings must be completely useless. Unfortunately, the plates are not of much help either. The original photographs are cut out from their background and put on a uniform white one. The cutting out destroys the contours of the figurines, the white background makes some of them look like inkspots, especially where the photographs had not enough contrast in the first place. This is particularly regrettable for the illustrations of the Cretan figurines, as most of them are published here for the first time. It also makes it impossible to form an impression of the bought figurines which the author includes as authentic; one can only say with the author 'c.s.', which is his abreviation for 'cannot say'. It can be questioned whether bought figurines should have been included at all, as opinions about them differ. The catalogue begins with the Egyptian figurines, the first ones being those from Badari. (The name of the excavator who worked there with Brunton is Caton-Thompson, and not Thompson, as the author calls her throughout.) These are followed by those of Naqada I and II. The descriptions of the figurines, which include provenances and present locations, where known, are arranged under eight headings: material used for manufacture; arm position and technique for showing arms; position of head; description of breasts or penis; posture, position of legs; description of buttock-protrusion; detail and techniques of ornamentation; anatomical details and techniques for showing them. It is difficult to set up tables such as are used in this catalogue without making some mistakes, but on pp. 84 and 86 things have got rather out of hand; nos. 29, 30, 3 are all said to have been found in Naqida, tomb 1895. This is not a tomb number, but the first part of the Ashmolean Museum number which indi- cates the year in which the museum acquired the object. No. 31 also has the wrong museum number; it should read 1895 not I985. Both nos. 30 and 31 have the remark attached: 'For dating see figure No. 20.' This last was found in the village rubbish at Mostagedda and was dated both by Brunton and Ucko as Badarian. Ucko cannot possibly mean that figurines 29 and 30 are Badarian. Nothing belonging to the Badarian period was found in either Naqada or Ballas, as the author himself says. The reference must be wrong. On pp. 86 f. the peg figurines from Naqada, tomb 271 are catalogued under nos. 32-7. Nos. 32-6 are said to have come from Naqada, tomb T27I. This is wrong; they were not found in the T cemetery which does not have 271 tombs, but in the main cemetery. Only no. 37 has the correct number. No. 47 is a female figurine found in Ballas, tomb 394. Here is to be found a curious misreading of the text of the original publication in NAaqada and Ballas. First, the text is attributed to Petrie, while it is by Quibell who excavated at Ballas. Then Ucko says that the excavator was in doubt about the sex of the figurine, though it has well- formed breasts. Two figurines were found in Ballas, tomb 394. Of them Quibell says (Naqada and Ballas, p. 13): 'In one tomb of the regular type two female figures of clay were found.' Later on in the description of the paint on the figurines Quibell mentions (p. 14) the four black stripes down the side of the face of one of them and says that if the figurine represented a man one would take them as a beard. As Naqada and Ballas were the first predynastic cemeteries excavated in Egypt, Quibell did not know that the Predynastic Egyptians used green, black, and red paint as cosmetics. The figurine from tomb 394 shows us how the black paint was applied. The question of what Ucko calls a bearded lady or a hermaphrodite does not arise. The Brooklyn figurines nos. 56-73 from Ma'ameria graves i86 and 2, are catalogued as Amratian (Naqada I), sometimes with a ?, and sometimes without. The only pot known from grave 2 is a fine A-Group vessel which dates the grave right at the end of Naqada II (Gerzean), or at the beginning of the Dynastic period. The only other piece known to have been in grave 2 is a fishtail with projections for the haft. This is a rare form which probably is also rather late. While the two figurines from grave 2 are well preserved those in grave I86 were mostly fragments. Not only did they not have raised arms in all cases as the author points out, but one of them had no breasts; yet they are certainly all representations of women. The entry for figurine 74, head and torso of a woman from cemetery U at Abydos, says that the pottery which was associated with it included 'white lined ware and is therefore clearly dated to the Amratian period'.</page><page sequence="3">200 REVIEWS In 1928 Brunton already knew that Petrie's date for this type of pottery (S.D. 31-4) was mistaken (Badarian Civilisation). It still existed at the beginning of Naqada II. The catalogue is followed by a chapter 'Discussion of points arising from the catalogue', which begins with a useful publication record of individual figures. After this comes a section on 'Published analyses' and a section on 'Dating of bought figurines' which shows how wildly differing are the dates which scholars ascribe to the same figurine. That is why I think bought figurines would have been better left out of the catalogue. A lengthy section is concerned with the question of 'steatopygia', the existence of which the author rightly denies for Egypt. Only then does Ucko proceed to his own analyses. He explains that as many features as can possibly be detected in the figurines should be grouped together, so that some generalizations can be arrived at from the sparse material. His first feature is sex. This is not always easy to determine, for sometimes no definite male or female traits are shown. The Egyptians knew who was represented by the figurines, and sometimes did not find it necessary to represent the sexual organs. As we are ignorant of the meaning of the figurines, their sex sometimes represents a problem. Ucko is certainly right in maintaining that the predynastic Egyptians did not intend to represent any figurines as sexless. Nevertheless he classifies some as sexless as in a category different from c.s. ('cannot say') in table 3, I (p. 175). Table 3, 2 (p. 176) deals with sex and period, and 3, 3 (p. I77) with the number of figurines found in one tomb and their periods. The material on which these two tables are based is far too small to allow reliable conclusions. The wrong dates assigned to Ma'ameria graves 2 and 186, which between them account for i8 figurines, throws table 3, 2 completely out. The tables that follow also have to be treated with reserve. The text repreats what has been set out in the tables, and comes to the conclusion that the Egyptians could model statuettes in whatever position they wished, a conclusion which few people who know the material would have doubted. The next part of the book deals with figurines from neolithic Crete, most of them from the recent excava- tions of Professor J. D. Evans. It is a great pity that these important figurines, which were only summarily published by Evans, are shown in the same kind of miserable line-drawings and equally miserable plates as were the Egyptian figurines. The catalogue that follows is drawn up under the same headings as those used for the Egyptian figurines, and it is accompanied by similar tables. The main difference between the Egyptian and the Cretan figurines is their provenance, the Egyptian having been found nearly exclusively in tombs while those from Crete come from village sites. Here again the author specifies some figurines as 'none sex' as distinct from 'c.s.'; here the same objections apply as in the case of the Egyptian figurines. Then comes a section dealing with figures found at Hacilar, Jarmo, Hassuna, the Northern and Southern Obaid cultures, the Northern Gawra and Ninevite cultures, and the Southern Gawra and Jemdet Nasr cultures. Here one reads with some amazement that in Southern Mesopotamia figurines are virtually absent, and that the only examples known are from Ur. The author does not know the figurines from Uruk, includ- ing the interesting little fragment of a woman giving birth to a child which the excavators classify as pre- Obaid. After a description of some statuettes from the Greek mainland, Ucko goes on to discuss inter-cultural relations. These are again summarized in tables which give 'the direction of influence, the number of features, and the number of typical features'. It is not specified which these are, but reference is made to the preceding chapters. As the tables of the preceding chapters are not reliable, this reference is of little use. It is also not clear which features are used for parallels, and it seems doubtful even to the author whether a mechanical collection of features, like the positions of the arms, sex, head with or without features, can be used to establish cultural relations. Ucko, therefore, does not come to any results, other than the cultural relationship between Egypt and Nubia; and for this result complicated tabulations are hardly needed, for it has never been doubted. The last chapters of Ucko's book are concerned with the interpretation of the anthropomorphic figurines. He thinks mistakenly that female figurines-and especially those from Egypt-are generally explained as representing the mother goddess. For Egypt he then denies that there was a cult of the fertility goddess at all in predynastic times. He overlooks her representations with hands underneath her breasts in high relief on black-top vases of Naqada I, and her ensign of the raised arms and horns which is the most frequent of the standards on the boats on the decorated pottery of Naqada II. This ensign also appears on slate palettes and as an amulet. The nine points which Ucko adduces to prove that female figurines found in Egyptian tombs are not the mother goddess have, therefore, very little bearing, as no serious scholar has taken them for her.</page><page sequence="4">REVIEWS 20I On the basis of usages found in modern ethnographical material, Ucko suggests that the figurines were either dolls or substitute wives. He then states that he has gained the impression from the positions of the figurines in the graves that the majority were of no special importance in the tombs, and that the sex of figurine and that of the skeleon found with it were not significant. A better knowledge of the material might have led him to a different conclusion. He also denies that they might have been votive, because many more female than male figurines were found in the graves, which, he says, would imply 'that girls were much more frequently desired than boys' (p. 431). One can hardly expect a connection between the sex of the skeleton and that of the figurines, for the corpse s can not have been asking for a child. The petitioner was the woman who put a likeness of herself in the tomb to show to the goddess who it was who prayed for a child; the dead was supposed to act as messenger. That this idea existed in Egypt we know from the letters to the dead; they were put in any available grave and the dead were supposed to deliver them. Why the author states (p. 427) that what he calls 'pin figures' were always made of some durable material is difficult to understand. It is refuted by his illustrations on pp. 26 and 28 which show one pin figure made of ivory, the other of Nile mud, confronting each other. Pin figures form the first of the categories into which he divides his material. Another is labelled 'initiation figures'. It is not known whether initiation rites were performed in Egypt, though the circumcision of boys may have been one. What female figurines in graves could have to do with initiation rites remains obscure. However, Ucko himself is not convinced that such rites provide the correct interpretation of the figurines for, as he puts it, the majority of them were made of cheap materials and 'there must surely have been some rich parents' (p. 450). The category named 'Twin Figure', in which the figurine might represent a twin of the deceased, has no bearing for Egypt. The possibility that the figures might be servants is equally rejected; so too their interpretation as mourn- ing figures. Ucko's assertion (p. 418) that there is a 'historically attested arm position for mourning with hands on the breasts' is a mistake based on a misreading of a note by Leclant. Leclant quotes a remark by Breasted that the holding of breasts may be an attitude of mourning only to point out that this is an error. It is just as wrong to say that the god Min, whom Ucko mentions on the same page, does not appear before the Pyramid Texts. His symbol is frequent on the decorated pottery of Naqida II. Lastly (on the same page), it is absurd to say that the logical consequence of the assumption of a mother goddess in Egypt has not been recognized, namely the existence of a large pantheon and of a father god or male element in some guise. I do not see that this follows; moreover, it is not true for Egypt, where the ensigns on the boats of the decorated pottery have always been taken for symbols of different gods; while the existence of a male god at least since Naqada I is common knowledge. There is no 'great father god' in Egypt, because its earliest civilization seems to have been matriarchal, and the son and lover is of minor importance, as can be seen on the decorated vase in the Metropolitan Museum, which carries a representation of the sacred marriage. It is unfortunate that a book which brings together much material from different civilizations, and which is so elaborately produced, should be so unsatisfactorily e illustrated. The mistakes and misunderstandings in the text (not all of which could be pointed out here) make it unsafe in the hands of all who have no first-hand knowledge of the material. ELISE J.

Pp. xx+52; 104 photo- graphic and 104 line plates, 17 plates of palaeography. Price f 12. As one would expect, papyri dated to the Old Kingdom are not common, so that it is a matter for con- gratulation that the joint editors of the above-named work have given us an admirable edition of the oldest hieratic manuscripts known to be extant; documents, moreover, which will shed much light on a matter of which we know but little, namely the administration of an Old Kingdom royal funerary temple, that of Neferirkarec-Kakai. The most important group of fragments is preserved in the British Museum, but the Petrie Collection at University College London, the Louvre, and the museums of Cairo and East and West Berlin all have portions of this archive in their possession. The recording and publication of fragments of documents scattered through so many museums, and the ready response of the various museum administra- tions to the requests of the editors, give an outstanding example of international co-operation in the interests</page></plain_text>
