Marquardt Current Engineering and Manufacturing Services Staff General Motors Corporation ABSTRACT A critical performance issue in the deve- lopment of any air cushion restraint system is the dichotomy that exists between the inflation rate required to meet the 30 mph frontal, rigid barrier restraint performance requirements and the effect that this parameter has on increasing the risk of deployment- induced injuries to out-of-position occupants. In general, small cars experience greater vehicle deceleration levels than large vehicles in FMVSS 208, 30 mph frontal, rigid barrier tests due to tighter packaging of their front-end components. In order to meet the FMVSS 208 performance require- ments for such cars, the small car air cushion must be thicker and inflated faster than the large car air cushion. Such air cushion tech- nology will increase the risk of life- threatening, deployment-induced injuries to out-of-position occupants of the small car. A harm reduction analysis is done that indicates that a greater benefit can be derived from installing a large car air cushion technology in a small car than from installing the same air cushion technology in a large car, even though the FMVSS 208 restraint performance requirements are not met when installed in the small car. This statement is true for any occupant re- straint system (belts, passive interiors) identically applied to both the large and small car since small car occupants will always be exposed to more severe collision severities due to the car's lighter mass and reduced front-end crush space. Based on the analyses presented, it is suggested that performance requirements addressing deployment-induced injury concerns of out-of-position occupants be added to FMVSS 208 for evaluating air cushion restraints and that the FMVSS 208, 30 mph frontal, rigid barrier test conditions be changed to a frontal test of equal collision severity for all car sizes. AIR CUSHION RESTRAINT CAN PROVIDE excellent occupant protection in frontal collisions provided: i) the cushion is inflated before there is appreciable occupant interaction, ii) the cushion has sufficient capacity to arrest the forward motion of the occupant relative to the vehicle interior without allowing the occupant to penetrate through the cushion and impact the underlying vehicle struc- ture, and iii) the cushion dissipates a sufficient amount of the absorbed occupant energy so that the occupant rebounds at a velocity that will not result in injury during this phase of occupant motion. This statement is supported by the lack of significant injuries to human volunteers who were exposed to simulated frontal collision environments while being restrained by driver and passenger air cushions. In these tests, the volunteers were initially seated in normal driver and right front occupant positions and postures. The cushions were inflated during the simulated collision events, but prior to ap- preciable forward motions of the volunteers relative to the simulated vehicle interiors. For example, Smith et al (1)* report the results of human volunteer tests of a driver air cushion restraint conducted on the crash test sled at Southwest Research Institute. Eight different collision severities were simulated and five volunteers were tested at each severity level. The most severe collision environment ♦Numbers in parentheses designate papers listed in References. 5.30 0096-736X/86/9405-0030$02.50 Copyright 1986 Society of Automotive Engineers, Inc.</page><page sequence="2">851199 was a sled simulation of a 30 mph frontal, rigid barrier of a full size car. Only minor trauma (erythema, abrasions and ecchymosis) were observed. The authors noted that the pattern of these superficial trauma did not change with simulated collision severity level and they concluded that the injuries were induced by the deploying cushion. The láck of significant injuries in these tests must be tempered by the fact that none of the volunteers was close to the driver air cushion module when the cushion was deployed. The results of human volunteer testing of a passenger air cushion restraint are summarized by Smith et al (2). This test program was conducted on the Daisy Decelerator sled at Hoi loman Air Force Base under the direction of the Aerospace Medical Research Laboratory, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base. For their dynamic sled test series, a stepped severity approach was used in which the human subjects were exposed to increasing severity of simulated collision environments beginning with a sled impact velocity of 10 mph and a constant sled deceleration level of 10 g. The most severe simulated collision environment was a 30 mph sled impact velocity with a 22 g constant deceleration level. Only minor trauma (erythema, abrasion, contusion and blister) were observed in these tests. Again, the lack of significant injuries in these tests must be tempered by the fact that none of the volunteers was close to the passenger air cushion module when the cushion was deployed. The importance of this statement is clearly illustrated by the results of their static test series. In these tests, the volunteers assumed a normally seated, right front passenger posture. After they had leaned forward prescribed amounts towards the instrument panel, the passenger air cushions were deployed. These tests were discontinued when one of the volunteers experienced a mild concussion when he was bent forward 22 degrees from the vertical, the furthest forward head position assumed by any of the volunteers. FMVSS 208 does not address the out-of- position occupant injury concern relative to air cushion deployment performance. It only speci- fies a limited set of response requirements (HIC less than 1000, peak resultant chest acceler- ation less than 60 g for accumulative times greater than 3 ms, and peak axial compressive femur force less than 10,000 Ņ) that must be met by any passive restraint system when evaluated using normally seated dummies subjected to 30 mph frontal, flat rigid barrier, vehicle impact tests conducted at any barrier angle between ±30 degrees from the perpendicular to the direction of travel. It is important to note that differ- ent car models will produce different vehicle deceleration-time histories when subjected to these FMVSS 208 test conditions because of differences in the design of their front-end structure and packaging of their front-end components. These differences in deceleration- time histories impose different constraints on the design of air cushion restraint systems in terms of cushion size, gas volume and rate of gas generation. If the only concern was to meet the FMVSS 208 performance requirements, then one could simply design a rather large air cushion and a gas generator that would produce the required volume of gas in a very short time. Unfortunately, this design philosophy increases the potential for significant injury to out-of- position occupants. The challenge is to design an air cushion restraint that has sufficient capacity and can be inflated fast enough to meet the FMVSS 208 occupant protection requirements while not posing an undue risk of injury to out-of-position occupants. This paper will discuss the constraints that this challenge places on the design of air cushion restraints for small cars. AIR CUSHION SYSTEM DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS 0UT-0F-P0SITI0N OCCUPANT INJURY CONCERN - An important consideration in designing an air cushion restraint system is the potential for producing life-threatening injuries to car occu- pants who may be close to the air cushion module when the air cushion is deployed (3,4). This consideration is termed the out-of-position occupant injury concern. Horsch and Culver (5) have investigated the potential for thoracic injury to the out-of-position driver. Their static test environment consisted of a driver air cushion module mounted on a steer- ing wheel that was attached to an energy absorb- ing steering column. This assembly was installed in a stationary fixture. A Hybrid III dummy was positioned with its chest at a pre- scribed distance from the module and the cushion was deployed. Two types of air cushion modules were used. Their Type A module used an inflator that filled the cushion very rapidly. Their Type B module used an inflator that produced a slower fill rate. The effect of inflation rate on the potential for thoracic injury to the out-of-position driver is clearly demonstrated by comparing the maximum chest compressions that occurred when the Hybrid III dummy was against the modules when they were deployed. The fast inflator produced maximum chest compressions of 84 and 81 mm which are indicative of life- threatening chest injury. With the slower inflator, the maximum chest compression was only 43 mm. Numerous studies (6-14) have been conducted relative to the potential for air cushion deployment- induced injuries to out-of-position children. Analyses of Takeda and Kobayashi (8), Stalnaker et al (10) and Montalvo et al (11) have shown that children may be close to the instrument panel in a variety of positions and postures at the instant of a collision either due to their precrash "seated" position or due to the effects of preimpact braking. Aldman et al (7), Mertz et al (9) and Prasad et al (14) used anesthetized pigs to investigate the potential injury hazard to out-of-position children. Both static deployment and dynamic deployment sled tests were conducted with the 5.31</page><page sequence="3">pigs placed in a variety of positions and postures near various passenger air cushion modules. In a number of these tests, life- threatening head, neck, thorax and abdomen injuries were produced. Similar types of injuries were observed by Patrick et al (6) and Mertz et al (9) when anesthetized baboons were used as the child surrogate. Mertz et al (9) caution that the life-threatening injuries observed in their tests were produced by aggres- sive passenger system restraint concepts and such injuries may not be produced with less aggressive systems. The results of these studies clearly demonstrate the need to consider air cushion deployment- induced injuries to out-of-position occupants in the design of any air cushion system. Performance requirements need to be specified in FMVSS 208 to assure that the out-of-position occupant injury concern is addressed in the design of all air cushion systems.

These kinematic constraints can be illustrated by considering the simplified velocity-time (V-t) curves of the vehicle and its air cushion restrained occupant depicted in Figure 1. The vehicle V-t curve is described by line AD. We have assumed, for ease of illus- tration, that the vehicle deceleration in the 30 mph frontal, rigid barrier test of FMVSS 208 is Av, a constant. If we assume that there is no rebound, then P, which is area ADO, is the front-end crush of the vehicle. The occupant V-t curve is described by lines AB and BC. Line AB is that portion of the occupant's V-t curve where no restraint forces are acting and the occupant travels at the vehicle's precollision speed. The time from point A to point B is the time required to sense the need to deploy the cushion plus the tim*» required to inflate it. At point B, the cushion has been sufficiently inflated to begin to decelerate the occupant relative to the vehicle. Again, for ease of illustration, we have assumed that the cushion decelerates the occupant at a constant level, Ao. If we also assumed that the air cushion has been designed to dissipate the absorbed occupant energy, then there is no occupant rebound and the occupant is brought to rest relative to the vehicle at point C. Area S is the displacement of the occupant relative to the vehicle interior prior to being restrained by the cushion. Area R is the displacement of the occupant relative to the interior while being restrained by the cushion. The sum of areas S and R is the total forward displacement of the occupant relative to the vehicle interior during the collision event. A number of interesting observations can be made relative to the kinematic parameters described by the V-t curves of Figure 1. The front-end crush, P, and the vehicle deceler- ation, Av, are determined by the front-end structural design and the packaging of front-end components of the particular car model that incorporates the air cushion restraint. The sum of areas S and R is limited by the space avail- able between the normally seated occupant and the forward interior components of the specific vehicle incorporating the air cushion restraint. For a driver's chest, this distance would be the space between his chest and the air cushion module plus the available crush distance of the energy absorbing steering column. If the occupant's displacement exceeds the distance available, then he will penetrate through the air cushion and impact the underlying structure. The occupant deceleration level, Ao, is limited by the performance requirements of FMVSS 208. T, the time required to sense and inflate the cushion in a 30 mph frontal, rigid barrier test, is dependent on Av, S plus R and Ao. This implies that T will be constrained by the front-end structural and packaging limitations of Av, the interior distance limitation of S 5.32</page><page sequence="4">851199 plus R and the FMVSS 208 performance limitations placed on Ao. A second, independent constraint, is placed on T by the out-of-position occupant concern. Several researchers (5, 6, 9) have shown that the interaction forces between the out-of- position occupant and the deploying air cushion increase with increased rate of gas generation. Thus, as T is decreased to achieve a faster rate of gas generation required to meet the FMVSS 208 performance requirements, the risk of injury to out-of-position occupants is increased. It is quite possible that these two independent constraints placed on T (meeting FMVSS 208 requirements and not producing serious injuries to out-of-position occupants) are mutually incompatible for some vehicle designs. As car size decreases the task of satisfying these two independent constraints on T becomes more difficult. Small cars usually have less avail- able front-end crush space because of the goal to reduce overall vehicle size (mass) while maintaining occupant interior space (roominess). To achieve this goal, front-end components are tightly packaged leaving less space for crush- ing. The result of this tighter packaging of front-end components is that the small car experiences a higher level of vehicle deceler- ation in the 30 mph frontal, rigid barrier test of FMVSS 208. As the vehicle deceleration level increases, the time to sense and inflate the air cushion decreases, and the occupant achieves a greater velocity relative to the vehicle in- terior prior to being restrained by the air cushion. In order to meet the FMVSS 208 occu- pant protection requirements, the air cushion must be thicker and filled faster. Both these requirements are counter to the design objective for reducing interaction forces on out-of- position occupants. A comparison of air cushion design constraints for meeting FMVSS 208 occu- pant protection criteria for a large and small car is given by the following, example. LARGE AND SMALL CAR AIR CUSHION RESTRAINT DESIGN CONSTRAINTS - Consider the V-t curves for a large and small car shown in Figure 2. The large car frontal rigid barrier pulse is charac- terized by a 20 inch front-end crush, an 18 g deceleration level and a 30 mph velocity change.

For ease of illustration, we have assumed that neither car rebounds from the barrier. To investigate the differences in air cushion technology required for these two V-t curves, it is assumed that the large and small car have the same space available between the occupant and the forward interior (12 inches), that the air cushion mounting structure does not absorb energy and that the same level of air cushion restraint forces will be applied to the occupants of both cars. The restraint forces are approximated by assuming that the occupant experiences a constant 30 g deceleration level when in contact with the cushion. This value was chosen as one half the FMVSS 208 peak chest deceleration limit of 60 g and is taken as the limit of the average occupant deceleration level required to meet the FMVSS 208 peak acceleration limit. With these assumptions, the minimum cushion size and the maximum time allowable to sense and inflate the cushion are uniquely determined for each V-t curve and are shown in Figure 3.

A minimum cushion thick- ness of 7 inches is required to decelerate the occupant at 30 g's while limiting the occupant's forward displacement relative to the car to 12 inches which is the assumed available interior space. For the small car, the cushion must be inflated much faster (within 23 ms) and a larger cushion (minimum cushion thickness of 9 inches) is needed. The difficulty in designing an air cushion for this small car is the reduced time budget that is available to sense and inflate the cushion in order to meet the 30 mph frontal, rigid barrier performance requirements of FMVSS 208. It is possible to develop a gas generator that can fill a cushion in less than 23 ms. However, GM test results (5, 9) and those of others (6, 7, 8, 14) have demonstrated that such aggressive air cushion systems can produce fatal lesions to out-of-position occupants. Clearly, constraints need to be placed on the rate of gas generation. As indicated previously, this could 5.33</page><page sequence="5">be accomplished by specifying performance requirements in FMVSS 208 to address the poten- tial for life-threatening, deployment-induced injury to out-of-position occupants. LARGE CAR AIR CUSHION TECHNOLOGY APPLIED TO SMALL CARS Let us consider the implications of apply- ing air cushion technology developed for a large car to a small car. For example, assume that the large car air cushion technology depicted in Figure 3 is to be used. That system consists of a 7 inch thick cushion which will provide a 30 g occupant deceleration level. Note that all of the cushion thickness is used to decelerate the large car occupant in the 30 mph frontal, rigid barrier test depicted by Figure 3. This implies that for the large car the FMVSS 208 occupant protection criteria will be met. For the small car, assume that its vehicle interior and space between the normally seated occupant and the forward interior components (12 inches) are the same as the large car. Further assume that its 30 mph frontal, rigid barrier V-t curve is as shown for the small car in Figure 2.

Our experience has indicated that there is only a small change in sensing times for 30 mph frontal, rigid barrier tests of current large and small cars. This implies that the time required to sense and inflate the cushion will be that given for the large car in Figure 3 or 38 ms. Note that because of this sensing and inflation time, the cushion will not prevent the small car occupant from penetrating the cushion and striking the underlying interior structure which is denoted by the vertical line on the occupant V-t curve of Figure 4. The implication of this observation is that occupant protection criteria of FMVSS 208 will not be met. However, the system can provide excellent occupant protection for small car deployment collisions in the field whose severities are equal to or less severe than the large car V-t curve shown in Figure 3 provided the occupants are not close to the air cushion module at the time of deploy- ment. BENEFIT ANALYSIS - To obtain an estimate of the relative benefits to be derived from apply- ing a given air cushion technology to a small and a large car, one needs to estimate the density of unrestrained occupant harm as a func- tion of collision severity for large samples of N randomly selected collisions of a small car and N randomly selected collisions of a large car. For an unbiased estimate, the interiors of the large and small cars should be identical and the precolli sion spacing of the occupant from the interior should be equal. Figure 5 presents a qualitative estimate of such harm density curves. The corresponding cumulative harm curves are given in Figure 6.

Note that the small car experiences a more severe collision severity than the large car when subjected to the FMVSS 208 test conditions. The cumulative harm for the small car sample is greater than that for the large car sample because the small car will be involved in greater number of higher severity collisions due to its lighter mass and smaller amount of front-end crush space. The basis for these curves is discussed in more detail in the Appendix.

The effectiveness is zero until the frontal collision severity corresponding to the air cushion deployment threshold is reached. It is assumed that the air cushion will provide a high level of effectiveness up to and including the crash severity corresponding to the 30 mph frontal, rigid barrier collision of the large car. For more severe collision severities, it is assumed that the occupant will penetrate through the cushion and impact the underlying interior structure reducing the effectiveness of the air cushion. This is indicated by the decreasing portion of the effectiveness curve for collision severities more severe than the 30 mph frontal, rigid barrier collision severity for the large car. To obtain estimates of the harm reductions that can be obtained by applying the large car air cushion technology to a large car and a small car, the qualitative unrestrained occupant harm density curves of Figure 5 are multiplied by the hypothetical air cushion effectiveness curve of Figure 7. This process gives the harm reduction density curves for the large car and small car. Integrating these density curves over the spectrum of frontal collision severi- ties gives the curves of cumulative harm reduc- tion as a function of collision severity for the large car and the small car that are shown in Figure 8.

While the curves used in this analysis are hypothetical, the conclusion that a greater benefit can be derived by applying a given air cushion technology to a small car as compared to a large car will always be valid, independent of whether or not the FMVSS 208 occupant protection requirements are met by the small car. This statement is true for any occupant restraint system (belts, passive interiors) identically applied to both the large and small car since small car occupants will always be exposed to more severe collision severities due to the car's lighter mass and reduced front-end crush space. The results of this benefit analysis suggests that the 30 mph, frontal rigid barrier test of FMVSS 208 may place unnecessary require- ments on air cushion designs. This test condi- tion produces different collision severities for different car designs. To meet the occupant protection requirements of FMVSS 208 with an air cushion system, faster inflation rates are required for car designs that experience higher collision severities in the FMVSS 208 test. Unfortunately, faster inflation rates increase the risk of life-threatening, deployment-induced injuries to out-of-position occupants. This dichotomy can be resolved by replacing the 30 mph frontal, rigid barrier test conditions of FMVSS 208 with a frontal test of equal collision severity for all cars. Such a test would provide an unbiased evaluation of all types of occupant restraint systems (belts, air cushions, passive interiors). As noted previously, performance requirements addressing deployment- induced injury concerns for out-of-position occupants need to be added to FMVSS 208 to assure that this important injury risk is considered in the design of any air cushion re- straint system. 5.35</page><page sequence="7">SUMMARY Two important considerátions in designing any air cushion restraint system are meeting the passive restraint performance requirements specified in FMVSS 208 and not producing serious injuries to car occupants who may be close to the air cushion module when it is deployed. An analysis was done of the kinematic constraints placed on the air cushion restraint design by the FMVSS 208 requirements. Generally, small cars experience greater vehicle deceleration levels than large cars in the FMVSS 208, 30 mph frontal, rigid barrier tests due to tighter packaging of their front-end components. In order to meet the occupant protection require- ments of FMVSS 208, such small car air cushions must be thicker and deployed faster than large car air cushions. Faster inflators in conjunc- tion with thicker cushions result in greater forces being applied to occupants who may be near or against the air cushion module at the time of deployment increasing the risk of life-threatening deployment-induced injuries. A benefit analysis was done of installing a large car air cushion technology in a small car. It was assumed that this air cushion technology would provide a high level of effectiveness for collision severities ranging from the threshold of deployment up to the 30 mph frontal, rigid barrier severity of the large car. However, the air cushion technology would not satisfy the FMVSS 208 occupant protection requirements for the 30 mph frontal, rigid barrier test of the small car. Qualitative estimates of the cumula- tive harm reduction as a function of collision severity for unbiased, equal samples of large and small cars were made. These estimates indicated that the cumulative harm reduction (benefit) for the small car equipped with the air cushion system would always be greater than the cumulative harm reduction for the same air cushion system installed in a large car indepen- dent of the fact that the air cushion system installed in the small car did not satisfy the FMVSS 208 occupant protection requirements while these requirements were met when the air cushion system was installed in the large car. It was noted that this statement is true for any occupant restraint system (belts, passive interiors) identically applied to both the large and small car. The results of the benefit analysis suggest that the 30 mph frontal, rigid barrier test conditions of FMVSS 208 should be replaced with a frontal test of equal collision severity for all cars. Such a test condition would allow the same air cushion technology to be applied to all cars. In addition, it is suggested that perfor- mance requirements be added to FMVSS 208 to assure that the life-threatening, deployment- induced injury concerns to out-of-position occupants are addressed in the design of any air cushion system.

APPENDIX ESTIMATE OF UNRESTRAINED OCCUPANT HARM AS FUNCTION OF COLLISION SEVERITY - In order to determine how unrestrained occupant harm varies with collision severity, estimates of the average unrestrained harm for given collision severities and the frequency of different collision severities for large and small cars must be made. As a first step in determining the nature of such distributions, assume that one could select a random sample of N accidents from the population of all frontal collisions for a given small car and a random sample of N accidents from the population of all frontal collisions of a given large car. Furthermore, assume that the interiors of the two cars are identical and that the occupants are the same. Assume, also, that the small car weighs less and has less available frontal crush distance than the large car. With these assumptions and neglecting accidents with significant localized intrusions, the occupants of the large and small cars will experience the same harm when their V-t curves are identical, independent of colli- sion conditions. But, under similar accident conditions, the small car collision severity will be more severe. This latter point is clearly illustrated by the V-t curves as shown in Figure AI. In all four cases, the large and small car strike the same object (either a fixed rigid barrier or another object). For ease of illustration, the V-t curves have been linear- ized. Note that for similar collision condi- tions, the small car always experiences a more severe collision environment than the large car. Consequently the effect on the small car occu- pant will be more severe (greater harm). Two other important points are illustrated by the V-t curves of Figure Al. The first is that identical V-t curves can be produced by differ- ent collision modes for the same car. The second point is that both the large and small car can experience the same V-t curve; however, Small Car Large Car 2000 lbs. 3500 lbs. 12" Interior Space 12" Interior Space Small Available Crush Space Large Available Crush Space ĪK * |K* * Vg, Object Struck !

Estimates of frequency distribution curves as a function of collision severity for the samples of N large cars and N small cars are given in Figure A2. Since field data indicates that the number of collisions drops rapidly as the collision severity increases, the distribu- tion curves will be skewed to the left. Note that the areas underneath each curve are equal because the sample sizes are equal. Since the small car will experience a greater number of higher severity accidents than the large car, the curves must cross at a relatively low level of collision severity. This characteristic is very significant in developing estimates of harm distributions for the unrestrained occupants of the large and small car sample. Now the harm to an unrestrained occupant associated with a given collision severity (V-t curve) will be independent of car size per our assumptions of identical interiors and occu- pants. Thus, a curve of unrestrained occupant harm for a given collision severity versus collision severity will have the characteristic shown on the graph of Figure A3. At low colli- sion severities no harm results. As collision severity increases, harm increases on an S-shaped curve and eventually reaches a maximum harm value at a high collision severity level. Multiplying the number of collisions of a given collision severity (Figure A2) by the unre- strained occupant harm associated with that collision severity (Figure A3) gives estimates of the unrestrained occupant harm associated 5.37</page><page sequence="9">with each collision severity for the large and small car samples. These estimates are depicted by the curves of Figure A4. £ I Large Car oc o _ - |ã Small Car U- ~~ FRONTAL COLLISION SEVERITY FIGURE A2: Collision Frequency for Various Collision Severities for Random Sample of N Collisions io So ' » I I i » » FRONTAL COLLISION SEVERITY FIGURE A3: Average Harm Per Collision for Various Collision Severities _ Car _ s / ^Large Car ' i i i i i FRONTAL COLLISION SEVERITY FIGURE A4: Harm Associated with Various Collision Severities for Random Sample of N Collisions Figure A5 shows the cumulative harm distri- butions for both the large and small car samples as a function of collision severity derived by integrating the curves of Figure A4. Note that above some relatively low level of collision severity, the cumulative unrestrained occupant harm is always greater for the small car than for the large car. Because of this characteris- tic any occupant restraint system (belts, air cushion, passive interior) identically applied to both the large and small car will produce a greater occupant harm reduction in the small car than the large car, independent of the restraint system's effectiveness. g _ f ^^Small Car _ 5 _ V Large Car - 1 1^1 I I I I I I FRONTAL COLLISION SEVERITY FIGURE A5 - Cumulative Harm of Unrestrained Occupants as a Function of Collision Severity for N Randomly Selected Collisions 5.38</page></plain_text>
