<plain_text><page sequence="1"> JANE HAYWARD The Cloisters, The Metropolitan Museum of Art In 1882, Louis Steinheil, the Parisian glass painter, began restoration of the three east windows of the cathe- dral of Poitiers. The unusual feature of this restoration at the time was that the three windows were photo- graphed, section by section, as the glass was removed and again after the repairs took place. Steinheil extracted a number of medieval panels of different periods that had been inserted as stop gaps in the two lateral windows, a fact that can be determined by comparing their present state with the description of the cathedral published in 1848 by Abbe Auber.1 Two of these panels are now in the collection of The Cloisters and a third scene, unre- lated to these two panels, was discovered by Louis Gro- decki in storage in Paris.2 Four saints, dating from the sixteenth century, were reinstalled on the south side of the choir but the remainder of these panels, twelve in number, have disappeared. Most of the photographs made during the Steinheil restoration are unpublished and many of the original negatives have been lost so that the two Cloisters panels, and in particular the one relating to the history of Noah, are all that remain of an interim phase in the glazing program at Poitiers between the three east windows (1165-1175) and the middle side bays of the choir which have been dated ca. 1215-1220 and later.3 Scholars interested in this problem presently have been dependent upon these few fragments of the glass and the brief descriptions of the windows published by Abbe Auber. Recently, however, a complete set of the Stein- heil photographs was discovered among the papers of the late collector of medieval art, Raymond Pitcairn. It is now possible, therefore, to reexamine the evidence for this phase in the cathedral glazing and to suggest both the design and the iconographic sources of the lost Noah window. To review, briefly, the construction and history of the glazing program at Poitiers, work began on the two easternmost bays of the choir around 1 162 and was terminated about 1 180.4 During this period, the three east windows were installed with a terminus post quem of 1152 provided by the donors of the central window containing the Crucifixion which was given by Henry II, Plantagenet and his queen Eleanore of Aquitaine who were married in that year at Poitiers. The later dating for these windows (1165-1175) is justified by progress of the building campaign and by stylistic comparisons with other twelfth century glass in the west of France. A sec- ond building campaign comprising the completion of the choir, the transept and the first bay of the nave must have been completed by 1199 when the choir was consecrated. The nave progressed slowly with the western facade finally reaching completion in the latter part of the thirteenth century. Based on the extant windows at Poitiers, there appears to have been a hiatus in the glazing program which seems to have been resumed in the north choir aisle and north transept only in the second decade of the thirteenth century.5 The problem, however, is that much of the choir glass is missing. Both the first and third bays of the north and south aisles have lost their early glass. To make matters worse, the original two- light window of the first bay on the north side, critical to this study, was enlarged in the beginning of the four- teenth century thus destroying its original form and, un- doubtedly altering its glazing as well.6 The earliest records concerning the choir glazing date from 1562 at the time when the cathedral was first ravaged by the Huguenots. An account of the state of the windows at that time provided by the glass painters Rene Frovignault and Michel Robin stated that the first bay on the south side of the choir was already set in quarries.7 In 1569, the cathedral was again attacked by the Huguenots. This time, a bombardment broke many of the windows and completely demolished others.8 It was, perhaps, at this time, or certainly during the restoration of 1775-1778,9 that panels from other windows were gathered for insertion in the east windows and remained there until Steinheil's reorganization of the glass. But, as these fragments indicate, repairs had been made to the glass by local glaziers as early as the beginning of the fourteenth century at the time when the aperture of the north bay was rebuilt.10 Many of the panels removed by Steinheil were in such disarray that their subjects are indecipherable and were probably broken up and discarded. In the scene showing two bishops, now in The Cloisters collection, for example, the head of the smaller figure stop-gapped with a disproportionately large face of the fourteenth century when removed by Steinheil, was repaired with a more suitable head from another discarded panel.1l By far the 129 GESTA XX/I (8) The International Center of Medieval Art 1981 The Lost Noah Window from Poitiers</page><page sequence="2">best preserved of the lost panels were the five that de- picted the history of Noah, one of which is The Cloisters piece and on which this study will concentrate. The Cloisters panel (Fig. la), a half-circle showing God in the person of his Incarnation, Christ, closing the door of Noah's ark, was purchased by John D. Rockefel- ler, Jr. in 1925 from George Grey Barnard and subse- quently given to The Metropolitan Museum of Art.12 When removed by Steinheil from the St. Peter window at Poitiers in 1882/84, howevern the Cloisters Noah panel (Fig. lb) had been joined to one of the lost pieces from the same series and it still contained the original head of Christ which is now replaced by a copy.13 The fragmentary sequence of the Noah story from Poitiers begins with another of these lost panels (Fig. 2).

Except for some confusion in the archi- tecture, this panel was, apparently, in the best condition of the series. Its photograph shows one of Noah's sons, since the figure has a short beard and wears short clothes, bending to guide a hoofed animal into the ark. The creature bounds up the gang plank and through the arched doorway. Only the superstructure of the ark is shown with the gabled doorway forming the lower stage and a pedimental structure, supported by colonnettes, above. The Cloisters panel (Figs. la and lb) is chronolog- ically the next in the group. In the usual format, God with cruciform nimbus extends his hands to close the door of the ark. Only one stage of the superstructure, that of the gable with its elaborately hinged door, and a portion of the decking of the ark, are visible above the advancing floodwaters. A stylized tree is shown at the left. Since this is the sole surviving panel of the series, it is the only one in which color can be discussed. The range is limited, comprised of only eight colors in this piece. The back- ground is a clear sapphire blue, deeper in tone than the fields of the east windows. This lighter blue is em- ployed in the decking of the ark. A bright, striated ruby is used for the nimbus and the gable and a deep green for the door. God is clothed in white and pinkish murry. His hands are a brownish pink, a color that was un- doubtedly repeated in the original head of the figure. Ac- cents of white and yellow delineate the architecture and the landscape. These pure, bright colors are characteris- tic of twelfth century class at Poitiers and in the West of France. The third panel in this series (Fig. 3) has survived in a photograph, often reproduced and described as Noah sending forth the dove.14 The piece appears to have been in considerable disorder with numerous insertions and mixing of pieces of glass. Noah's figure protrudes from an open window in the tiled roof of the ark. He holds the bird aloft. The plumage of the bird and its grayish tonality in the photograph suggest, however, that it is the raven rather than the dove that is being released, a point to which we will return presently.15 The piece of carrion, stopped in beneath the bird's feet, has further associations with the raven. Shown this time in side view, the familiar double staged superstructure o£ the ark, with its upper story of colonnettes applied to checkerboard paneling, has a lower story with a roof covered with tiles and walls of planked siding. The last two scenes are mere fragments having been cut down to fit the arch at the top of the Saint Peter window. In the first o£ these, (Fig. 4) the upper half of Noah's body emerges incongruously from the side of the ark. The figure is completely restored in early fourteenth century style. Following the biblical account, the raven, who does not return to the ark, is shown in flight above Noah's head. The cycle is completed by still another Deluge scene (Fig. 5). This time Noah is shown half-length with the dove appearing to alight on his outstretched hand. Bits of a rectangular structure are shown in the lower part of the panel and a pair of stockinged feet have been in- appropriately leaded onto the torso of the patriarch.

Was this scene originally the return of the dove with the olive branch? Was it, as the feet suggest, the release o£ the animals from the ark? Or was it, as we will consider presently, a frag- ment of Noah's sacrifice? It is difficult to determine the subject at this juncture. What can be stated at the outset, however, is that the Noah windows at Poitiers contained an extensive account of the Deluge and one that bears little relationship to other contemporary cycles in stained glass. Within the iconographic program as defined by Gro- decki at Poitiers, the Noah window would logically have been placed, with a Creation cycle in its twin light, in the first bay on the north side of the choir adjacent to the story of Abraham and Lot that continue an Old Testa- ment sequence in the second bay.16 Though the window apertures of this first bay were destroyed there is no rea- son to believe that they differed in size or design from the twin lights in the opposite bay of the south aisle. It is virtually certain, however, that these panels are not now in their original form. A careful examination of the re- mains indicates that some of these scenes and probably all of them were quatrefoils, or, more accurately, half quatrefoils.17 The most easily reconstructed of these panels, since it still exists, is the Closing of the Door of the Ark. (Fig. lc). If the lead lines in the panel are fol- lowed, the restorations removed, and the glass reordered, the original half-quatrefoil shape emerges. As it exists, in FIGURE 2.

The bisecting of scenes by the irons of the window armature was characteristic of glazing at Poitiers and at Angers as well.l8 The quatrefoil shape used in place of the circular format common to the earlier narrative windows of St. Peter and St. Lawrence at Poitiers was a departure from tradition. But the ap- pearance of more complex geometry in the framing of scenes seems to have been adopted in all of the western French centers of glazing in the last decade of the twelfth century.l9 Though it is impossible to determine how these scenes were originally arranged in the aperture, cer- tain clues toward a solution to this problem are provided by the later side bays. The grid type of armature seems to have been consistently maintained at Poitiers and fre- quently to have bisected scenes as presumed in the quatrefoils of the Noah window. Scenes in the side win- dows are most generally placed in two vertical rows in the grid and surrounded by a continuous framing fillet.20 This type of arrangement most probably originated in the northeasternmost bay where the Noah window was originally placed. The Noah window comprised a number of scenes fourteen according to our reconstruction- enough to have included both the history of the flood and the culture of the vine as well. The unprecedented enlargement and multiplication of window openings in nascent Gothic architecture and the elaborate iconographic programs that ensued re- quired novel solutions by the glass painter and his ico- nographer. Contemporary art in other media was quite unequal to the task of providing models. Even the most extensive fresco cycles were limited in scope by com- FIGURE 5.

Noah opening the ark, stained glass panel formerly in the Cathedral of St. Peter, Poitiers, ca. 1190, now lost. 133</page><page sequence="6">parison with the number of scenes required in stained glass windows and the same can be said for narrative relief sculpture and metalwork. French manuscript il- lumination in the twelfth century was, for the most part, confined to single scenes or historiated initials. Just how critical this problem was for stained glass cycles can be demonstrated in the Noah window at Chartres, glazed probably in the first decade of the thirteenth century. This window contains an exceptional number of scenes- forty in all. Of these, four are devoted to the animals coming to the ark and no less than six depict people drowning in the deluge. One might conclude that the Chartres painter was hard pressed to fill his window. Since the Dormition of the Virgin window at Chartres is iconographically and in design an ampliSca- tion of its predecessor at Angers,22 it would be tempting to see a similar comparison with Poitiers in the Noah window especially since both employed quatrefoil-shaped medallions. Though God appears in incarnate form in the command to Noah at Chartres, there are no scenes that show the animals entering the ark, God closing the door, the raven released, or Noah's sacrifice. Even the release of the dove, with only Noah's hand showing, is iconographically different from Poitiers. These important omissions from the Chartres cycle indicate an entirely different tradition from the one employed at Poitiers. Since there are no other contemporary cycles in glass, it will be necessary to turn to more limited versions in other media. The obvious choice, because of its proximity to Poitiers, would be the Genesis cycle at Saint-Savin-sur- Gartempe. These frescoes, that cover the entire vault of the nave, were executed at the beginning of the twelfth century and include eight scenes from the story of Noah of which four are concerned with the flood: Noah com- manded to build the ark, the ark floating on the waters, God's covenant with Noah, and Noah's sacrifice.23 Even in this limited series of scenes, certain elements common to both cycles deserve mention. God appears as Christ with crossed nimbus three times at Saint-Savin, in the Command to Noah the Covenant, and Noah's Sacrifice, as he does in the Closing of the door at Poitiers. The ark at Saint-Savin, though complete rather than cut by the frame as at Poitiers, has a multileveled superstructure with tiled roof and arcaded sides. George Henderson has compared the Saint-Savin frescoes to Late Antique models transmitted by way of English sources.24 It is not our purpose here to discuss these complex questions of iconographic recensions and transmissions but, rather, to submit the Poitiers fragments one by one, to a similar type of analysis. The actual loading of the ark, that begins the Poitiers sequence, is not as frequently represented in art FIGURE 6. Animals entering the ark, mosaics Cathedral of Mon- reale. as one might suppose. Only in very extensive cycles is this scene included. Kurt Weitzmann has postulated on the basis of the narthex mosaics at San Marco, that there were three miniatures devoted to this incident in the Cot- ton Genesis.25 But the Cotton fragment of one of these scenes and the San Marco mosaics are unlike the Poitiers panel in that the animals and birds are lifted into the ark by Noah and his sons.26 A striking parallel to the Poitiers scene is afforded by the nave mosaics in the cathedral of Monreale installed in the decade of the 1 180's. 7 There, in the scene of the loading of the ark, one of Noah's sons, wearing stockings and a short tunic, bends to guide a diminutive horse up the gang plank and into the ark (Fig. 6 ) . The figure is a mirror image of the one at Poitiers. It is possible that the missing half of the panel from Poitiers was also similar to Monreale but the shape of the ark was not. The multistoried ark of the Poitiers scene is more like the one at Saint-Savin and those of certain English examples at Canterbury and at Lincoln and in the Caedmon Genesis ( Fig. 7 ) . )8 In fact, the stepped superstructure with arcaded sides and peaked roof seems to have been a Romanesque type that con- tinued to be employed later in places like the ambulatory window at Auxerre.29 The next scene, that of God closing the door of the ark, is extremely rare in Genesis iconography. Only two examples that pre-date Poitiers include the scene: the ivory antipendium of Salerno, before 1084,3° and the Caedmon Genesis (Fig. 7 ), early eleventh century. In both these examples God appears in anthropomorphic form, in the case of the Caedmon drawing, with crossed nimbus of Christ. In both these examples, also, God stands upon the crest of the rising floodwaters as he does in the Poitiers panel. In all probability, the missing right half of the panel displayed the side view of the ark with Noah and his family in the window as in the Salerno 134</page><page sequence="7">the raven alone is sent out in the Ashburnham Penta- teuch.32 The latter example, however, is a conflated scene including Noah's departure and the ark itself is totally unlike the one at Poitiers. Considering the con- fusion of the glass in this panel and its numerous stop- gaps, it was probably the dove rather than the raven that was originally released in this scene and the iconographic type represented was one derived ultimately from the Cotton Genesis recension. There are plausible reasons for this suggestion in that the bird has no wings, its feet do not articulate well with its body, the neck of which has been pieced, and the carrion, probably the hind- quarters of a horse, is out of context in its present loca- tion in the scene.33 We would suggest that all these pieces were stopped in from another part of the panel and that the raven, whose missing wings were made from other pieces of glass as they are at Chartres and Auxerre, was originally pecking at carrion in the water. Furthermore, a tiny bit of the original dovens white tail can be detected below Noah's right hand. But, there are, also, other ele- ments in this panel that connect it to the Cotton Genesis recension. The checkerboard pattern on the upper story of the ark between the pilasters with its diagonal line in each square is very like the pattern on the side of the ark in the Cotton Genesis fragment of the same scene, a com- parison already suggested by Henderson in relation to similar patterning on the ark on page 73 of the Caedmon manuscript (Fig. 8).34 Most difficult to interpret, because of its fragmentary state and restorations, is the scene of Noah in the open ark with the bird in flight above his head. Though the fragment suggests that it depicted the flight of the raven during the voyage, a comparison with earlier Noah cycles may yield a different interpretation. In the Aelfric FIGURE 7. God closing the door of Noah's ark, Caedmon Gen- esis, Oxford Bodleian Library, ms. Jlnitls Xl, p. 66. ivory. Though the iron hinges of the door in the Caedmon manuscript are similar to those shown in the Poitiers panel, the scene itself is a conflation of the Embarkation, the Closing of the Door and the Release of the Dove. There is one puzzling element in the Poitiers panel-the stylized tree that acts as a space filler on the left-hand edge of the scene. Had the ark a hull, like other ex- amples of the type, the tree, both in position and shape would be the prow of the boat. While several stepped arks, including those at Saint-Savin and in Caedmon, have beast-headed prows, others do not. The arks on pages 65 and 73 (Fig. 8) of the Caedmon manuscript and in a psalter that was made in Winchester about 1150 all have prows with a double volute termination not unlike the two leaves of the tree at Poitiers.3l This may be a case where the glass painter either misunderstood or deliber- ately changed his model. Noah releasing the raven or the dove is next in the Poitiers sequence. The release of the raven is extremely rare in Genesis cycles. Most of them, including the Cot- ton Genesis, show the release of the dove while the raven pecks at carrion on the surface of the water. In early depictions of the ark in certain of the catacomb paintings, Noah simultaneously releases both birds, a type that was repeated in the fourteenth-century Holkham Bible while FIGURE 8. Noah's family leaving the ark, Caedmon Genesis Oxford, Bodleian Library, ms. Junius Xl, p. 73. 135</page><page sequence="8">Pentateuch illuminated at Canterbury in the second quarter of the eleventh century, is a large, full page miniature depicting the opening of the ark (Fig. 9).35 At Godss command, Noah pushes up the roof hatch which seems to raise the wall as well, so that the figure of the patriarch appears to project from the side of the ark in much the same manner as in the Poitiers panel. Though the Aelfric Noah is still within the ark, his family, the animals, and the birds have already come forth. The birds, in pairs, fly away from the ark while the dove ap- proaches with the olive branch. This is a conflated scene but the incident is repeated in proper sequence at San Marco.36 In the mosaic version, Noah and his family still stand on the deck of the ark which rests precariously on two hilltops as it does in Aelfric. Noah is releasing the animals who play about in the landscape below while the freed birds flutter about his head. Since the scene appears at San Marco, it was also in the Cotton Genesis and it became a common inclusion by the middle of the thir- teenth century.3 Another early source for the Departure scene and one in which the raven is shown in flight above Noah's head, is that on fol. 1 0v of the Ashburnham Pentateuch, dated as early as the seventh century.38 Though there is little else in this miniature that relates to the Poitiers cycle, the raven in flight is unusual and this example must be considered even though its origins are still unknown.39 It is the Opening of the Ark, in our opinion, that is depicted in this fragment of the Poitiers series. It is equally possible, on the basis of earlier proto- types, to conclude that the last fragment in the Poitiers cycle is the scene of Noah's sacrifice. The sacrifice scene is included in the frescoes of Saint-Savin, the Salerno ivory antipendium, the mosaic cycles at Monreale and San Marco and on page 74 of the Caedmon manuscript. It is not, therefore, an unusual scene. We can partially reconstruct the Poitiers panel by means of its missing pieces. Noah is placed to the right of the scene, his sac- rificial dove held in his right hand. If the piece of drapery stopped in next to his arm belonged to his figure, Noah was kneeling or, at least, bending his left knee. The pull of the drapery across the knee and the bunched folds behind it could only describe a bent limb. The stockinged feet attached to his torso are exactly like those of his son in the Loading of the Ark panel. If these belong to this panel, Noah was accompanied by his sons. Bits of the rim of the altar table appear above the debris in the lower part of the panel, the original position of the altar probably being in the darkened area of the Steinheil pho- tograph. That the scene took place in the open air is in- dicated by the rock in the background. Though a com- mon scene in Deluge cycles, the Sacrifice of Noah contains numerous variations both as to the number of persons present, the kinds of animals brought to the altar, the setting and the poses of the figures. Only at Saint-Savin (Fig. 10) does Noah kneel before God as we presume he does at Poitiers. But, at Saint-Savin, he holds the doves in veiled hands unlike his uncovered hands at San Marco. By the latter part of the twelfth century, however, veiled hands in sacrifice scenes seem to have been less common so the unveiled type at Poitiers would not have been unusual.40 Noah is accompanied by members of his family in Caedmon, at Monreale, and at Salerno but in both these latter examples the sacrifice is placed on the altar, an element not shown in the Caedmon and Millstadt scenes. The fragments at Poitiers most resemble the altar at Saint-Savin. The standing figure of God is shown only in Caedmon and at Saint-Savin, as it probably was in the missing part of the scene at Poitiers. Of these examples, that at Saint-Savin seems closest to Poitiers particularly because it is the only one in which Noah kneels. Local models seem to have played a part, therefore, in the for- mation of this iconographic type at Poitiers but, as Hen- derson has suggested, many of the types used at Saint- Savin had their sources in England.4l It seems clear, from this examination of the frag- ments from Poitiers, that no single source can be credited as the iconographic model for the Noah window. Many of the scenes derive ultimately from Late Antique sources, some from the Cotton Genesis recension, while FIGURE 9. Noah's family leaving the ark, Aelfric Pentateuch, London, British Library, ms. Cotton Claudius V. IV, fol. ISv. 136</page><page sequence="9">main, bishop of Poitiers in 1 162? was an Englishman from York.4t) It was he who began the rebuilding of the cathedral shortly after assuming the episcopal chair at Poitiers. If it is possible to see English influence in the flat chevet at PoitiersS it is not diEcult to imagine English models for some of its windows. Scholar and friend of Thomas Becket, Jean Belmain had visited Canterbury where both the Caedmon and Aelfric manuscripts may have been located and may later have served as models for the choir glazing at Christ Church.46 It is not incon- ceivable to imagine that Jean Belmain knew these manu- scripts and derived models for his own program from the same sources. Jean Belmain went to Poitiers as the personal choice of King Henry II. Henry's tendencies toward the achievement of political stability through well placed prelates sympathetic to his cause are well known. Jean Belmain had won royal favor early in his career. Though direct royal patronage in the building of the new cathedral at Poitiers is unrecorded, Henry and his queen, Eleanore of Aquitaine, gave the east window there. Henry is also known to have attempted to exert his influence in the Norman kingdom of Sicily through the marriage of his daughter Joan to William II. The cathedral of Monreale was William's personal foundation that he built and decorated to serve as his royal mausoleum. The model for the mosaic cycle at Monreale, according to Demus, was a fresh source brought directly from Byzantium by Greek workmen.47 It is hardly likely, given the renewed interest in Byzantine art at the end of the twelfth century, that such an important foundation would have escaped notice in the north. In any case, the evidence presented indicates that the iconographic models employed for the Poitiers Noah window derived ultimately from Late Antique sources transmitted through English manuscripts a source that would see a new flowering at the end of the twelfth century in English psalter illumination.48 The Noah window was not, of course, the first occasion on which sources from across the channel had influenced the art of western France. Though perhaps an isolated example in stained glass, the Noah window should properly be viewed as part of a longstanding tradition of artistic exchange. NOTES 1.

Of central importance in the defini- tion of models for the Poitiers window is the Christ image of the Deity, appearing only once in the fragments, but presumably present in other lost scenes, as well. The type apparently originated in the Noah scenes of the Caedmon Genesis from which it may have been derived at Saint-Savin. Saint-Savin is unique in that of the four scenes relating to the Deluge, three contain the full- length figure of Christ. The emphasis there is upon God's direction of the events just as it is in Caedmon and in Aelfric. In Caedmon, God appears five times: directing Noah to build the ark, both closing and opening the door, ordering Noah to come forth and in Noah's sac- rifice. In three of these scenes he has a crossed nimbus. In the Aelfric manuscript, God is shown three times in anthropomorphic form. Only once, in the first instruc- tions to Noah, is the older form of the hand of God em- ployed. Ohlgren has attributed both these English cycles to a common model related to the Cotton Genesis recen- sion.42 Henderson, on the other hand, sees them as de- riving from a number of Late Antique sources.43 Both Bergman and Weitzmann have traced the rare scene of the Closing of the Door of the Ark to the Cotton Genesis but though the anthropomorphic figure appears at Saler- no, it is not Christ and it is doubtful that the figure, itself, was included in the Cotton manuscript.44 It is equally doubtful that the Salerno scene had any direct influence on Poitiers. The English version in Caedmon is far closer in type. In fact, except for the Loading of the Ark, all the scenes at Poitiers appear to derive from English or local models. This is not surprising considering that Jean Bel- 137</page><page sequence="10">nos. 50 and 51. L. Grodecki, "Les vitraux de la cathedrale de Poitiers," Cz711iers ArcSteologiqlles, CIX, 1951, 142.

Documents regarding the Steinheil restoration are preserved in the Bibliotheque de la Direction de l'Architecture in Paris. That Steinheil, himself, reused fragments removed from the east windows is proved by the first Joseph window of the south transept, also restored by him, where the head of Noah from the lost Release of the Dove panel is inserted in the scene of Joseph's brothers selling him to the Ishmaelites. This is a sad commentary on the fate of this splendid glass. A closer exam- ination may well reveal other such reuse as well as, perhaps, the missing head of Christ in The Cloisters' panel. 12.

See Grodecki, "Les vitraux," 143-156. Grodecki has postu- lated that the Noah story occupied the left hand light of the bay and that it was preceded by a lost Creation cycle in the right hand light that began the Old Testament series. No re- mains of this window have ever been found. Equally mysteri- ous are the subjects of the lost windows on the south side of the choir. The windows now occupying the second bay, the Infancy and Passion of Christ, are subjects that would nor- mally begin a New Testament series, but, on stylistic grounds, Grodecki has dated this glass in the second quarter of the thirteenth century. Only one piece of the Steinheil debris had clearly defined New Testament associations. This was a Bap- tism of Christ but, in style, it related to the later glass of the choir. 17. I am grateful to Dr. Madeline Caviness for this suggestion. The original format can be detected in the Placing of the Animals in the Ark and the Release of the Dove panels as well as in the Closing of the Door. 18.

Though the ark at Poitiers does not appear to have the subsidiary turrets of Saint-Savin, also present in that of the Caedmon Genesis, it does have the projection of the gabled doorway and its superstructure is basically similar. This projection is also found in the Klosterneuburg ark, see T. Ehrenstein, Das Alte Testamente im Bilde, Vienna, 1923, 166, pl. 31. It is also not unlike both arks in the choir win- dows at Canterbury Cathedral, even though its iconographic significance is different. See M. Caviness, T11e Earlv Stained Glass of Canterblarx CatSledral, Princeton, 1977, 126 and pls. 143-145, who sees the absence of the hull at Canterbury as symbolizing the ark of the church, not the case at Poitiers. The closest comparison to the Poitiers ark is that at Lincoln, which also has tiled roofs, colonnettes, and brick-like siding of the lower story. The notable difference between the two is that the hull is included at Lincoln, see J. Lafond, "The Stained 138</page><page sequence="11">Glass Decoration of Lincoln Cathedral," The Archaeolegical Jollrnal, CIII, 1947, pl. XXII, 13. 29. The publication of these windows by Virginia Raguin will ap- pear shortly. The Auxerre window adheres to what Henderson terms "the Anglo-Saxon type ark" in that it, like the ones at Saint-Savin and in the Caedmon and Aelfric manuscripts, have a large beast head on the prow which is not the case at Poitiers. 30.

This sugges- tion was proposed by Deborah8Kraak, to whom I am grateful for help with the research on this article. A similar suggestion was proposed by G. Henderson, "Late-Antique Influences in Some English Mediaeval Illustrations of Genesis," Jolzrncll of the Warblzrg and Collrtauld Institlltes, XXV, 1962, 186-187, regarding the change in the type of ark on p. 73 in the Caed- mon Ms. from the beast-headed ark on pp. 66 and 68. See H. Graham, "The Munich Psalter," The Year 1200: A Svm- posium, New York, 1975, fig. 10. 32. The paintings in the Catacombs of Priscilla and Domatilla both show this type, see Ehrenstein, Das Alte Testamente, 99, pls. 1 and 4, and also 102, pl. 13 for the Ashburnham Penta- teuch (Bib. Nat., nouv acq. ms. lat. 2334, fol. lOv). For British Lib., ms. add. 47862, see The Holkham Bible Pictllre Book, facsimile with introduction and commentary by W.O. Hassall, London, 1954, fol. 8r. 33. Most early examples including the Cotton Genesis, San Marco and the Sicilian mosaics show the raven feeding on a cadaver. The dead horse seems to have been a later type employed in the Holkham Bible, the roof bosses of Norwich Cathedral, the window at Auxerre and the Morgan Bible (Morgan M. 638, fol. 2v).
