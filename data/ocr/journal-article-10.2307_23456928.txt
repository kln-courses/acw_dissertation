<plain_text><page sequence="1">Summaries and Appendices* Cult Artifacts from Gilat and Relations with Northern Edom in the chalcolithic period David Alon (pp. 1-12) The site of Gilat, on the east bank of Nahal Patish in the northern Negev, extends over an area of about 10 ha. A slight rise situated in the northern part of the site, where many unique finds were exposed during years of deep ploughing, was the focus of salvage excava tions conducted on behalf of the Department of Antiquities. Four to five strata were identi fied, of which Stratum 3 was the most fully preserved and excavated. The central struc ture of this stratum consists of three rooms grouped around a courtyard, entered through a series of chambers (Plan 1). Three grain pits, lined with courses of brick or stone, and mea suring about 1.5 m in diameter and in depth, were situated in the eastern part of the court. Finds from the structure and its vicinity include violin-shaped figurines and stone pal ettes, decorated terra-cotta statuettes,4 stone stelae, votive axes made of basalt and gabbro, and a group of unique cylindrical jars. This unique assemblage of finds forms the basis for the interpretation of the structure as a Chalco lithic shrine. The violin-shaped figurines (Fig. 1) are of an abstract anthropomorphic type which is known locally only in fourth millennium BCE contexts. It appears to reflect a concept of the deity removed from that represented by the more conventional and expressive figurines of this and other periods, perhaps one related to an abstract, immaterial force. Violin-shaped figurines have been found at nine Chalcolithic sites, ranging from the Lebanese coast to Northern Sinai and the Jordan Valley.917־ The thirteen figurines from Gilat form the largest group, and include the largest known examples (over 20 cm in height) and the widest variety of raw materials, including diorite, granite and colored sandstones. The stone palettes from Gilat (Fig. 2), num bering at least twelve artifacts, do not appear to have served a functional purpose. In their smoothed, convex surface and in the choice of raw materials, the palettes, or body-plaques, appear closely related to the violin-shaped fig urines, and might be interpreted as a yet more abstract rendition of the schematic figure. A third group of cult objects is that of the cylindrical jars (Fig. 3). These, over 50 cm in height and with walls up to 3 cm thick, were also found in the shrine and its vicinity. The jars have a slightly everted rim and elongated double lug-handles; they are made of coarse clay, with large grits and straw temper, and are poorly fired. Pétrographie analysis has revealed that the raw material does not origi nate in the vicinity of Gilat, but comes from areas ranging from the southern Hebron hills to southern Transjordan, and from the south em coastal strip to the Negev highlands.19 The diverse origins of the assemblage of cult artifacts from Gilat reflect, it seems, the special role of the site as a regional cult center and a focus of pilgrimage. There is no evidence for local evolution in the Gilat material cul ture; all of its components appear in crystal lized form in the deepest levels at the site. We must therefore assume that, like the raw mate rials, the cultural traditions and technical * For footnotes and illustrations to summaries, see Hebrew section.</page><page sequence="2">2* Summaries knowhow evidenced at Gilat must have had their origin elsewhere. As noted, some violin-shaped figurines and 'body-plaques' (palettes) are made of igneous rocks (especially diorite and granite) and sand stones, originating in the Arabian-Nubian massif. They could have come from three pos sible sources: southern Transjordan, Sinai or Egypt. There is, however, no evidence for intensive contact with either of the latter two regions. No Egyptian pottery has been found at Gilat, and there is no evidence of direct Egyptian cultural influence. At most, the dis tinctive Egyptian culture of the period had only a marginal and indirect influence. Nor should the small, possibly seasonal sites of the Sinai3334־ be regarded as the source of the cul tural traditions at Gilat. Southern Transjor dan, however, has a long history of utilization of -and trade in - materials such as basalt, haematite, granite and sandstone, beginning with the PPNB cultures of sites such as Beidha.25 The region between Ghassul in the north and Petra in the south has also revealed traces of consecutive occupation during the Neolithic and Chalcolithic periods, and of extensive copper-mining in Wadi Fenan.3739־ Transportation routes, no doubt existent by Chalcolithic times, ran from Wadi Fenan across the Aravah Valley and through Nahal Zin to Avdat and the Be'er Sheva' basin,41 and from Wadi Hasa (Nahal Zered) in northern Edom, through es-Safi and Nahal Hemar to the Arad and Be'er Sheva' basins - the center of Chalcolithic settlement in the northern Negev. This area may thus be regarded as the primary source for the Gilat culture. The connection with Transjordan sug gested by the petrography of both ceramic and stone cult artifacts from Gilat is possibly ech oed in the later traditions of fraternal relations between Edom and Israel (Abraham and Lot, Jacob and Esau). The areas of the northern Negev and Edom also serve as the backdrop for biblical references to divine revelation (Ju. 5:4-5, Hab. 3:3), and may also reflect the ancient cultural ties between the two areas.</page></plain_text>
