<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Shark in Oceania: from Mental Perception to the Image Introduction1 An aspect of visual expression common to several of the societies of insular Oceania is the iconographie image of the shark. Much more than just a fish and food source for man, the shark has psychological and symbolic meanings reflected in the many plastic rep resentations encountered on a great number of objects.We will see that it is a social partner,2 medi ator, judge, or god according to different Oceanic societies. I will present a brief description of the rela tionships man maintains, in daily as well as imagi nary life, with the ocean environment and the life forms inhabiting it. The shark especially is related to the ways Pacific islanders see and think about the world. Shark Representations In Polynesia, Micronesia, insular Melanesia, and in Polynesian outliers, where the Polynesian culture neighbors that of Melanesia, men live for the most part in strict symbiosis with the sea. The sea sup ports life by providing resources, avenues of trans port, communication and exchange, and sources of identity. When man is at sea, he socializes with the sur rounding environment, deriving an aspect of his identity from it. Even today, after Christianization, he communicates with the gods of his pre-Christian religion (Bataiile-Benguigui 1994). For men fishing on the high seas.3 the sea is generally perceived as a 'jealous woman' tolerating no rivals on her territo ry, to the point of exacting sexual abstinence or forc ing man to use subterfuges such as rubbing fragrant herbs on the body to mask a woman's odor from the day before (Johannes 1981:14 note 9). I will touch again on these sexual-type interdictions later. The sea, before widespread air transport, was the natur al and continuous extension of land. Following is an example of the mythical origin of the shark, collect ed in Tonga in 1974, in which the shark easily goes Marie Claire Bataille Benguigui Musée de l'Homme Translated from the French by Janet Pawelko from the natural to supernatural, from the land of the living to the land of gods and the dead: A handsome young man, Sinilau, goes in search of the beautiful, young girl he had seen the night before beating bark in the halo of the full moon. He walks to the end of his island and on his way gathers some followers who each possess different physical merits; one has a piercing stare, another can swell up his body, and the last can lengthen it. They arrive at the sea and walk towards the open ocean. They leave the beach, at first wading from one stone to another, then continue towards the open waters. As they continue to advance on the sea bottom Sinilau keeps his head above water by climbing onto the shoul ders of the one who can lengthen his body. E ventually the bottom rises and the three com rades arrive on none other than the island of Pulotu, the Tongan paradise, the world of the gods and deceased ancestors. There they find only the young girl named Hina and her par ents. After many mishaps and trials involving the boys foiling all the traps, he leaves with the girl, again with the aid of his helpers. At that time the parents give the girl a belt of small sharks as a going-away present. This myth reveals to us that the shark is a present from the land of the gods. (Storyteller: Initoni from the village of Navutoka, northwest coast of Tongatapu, Tonga Islands, Bataille Benguigui 1994:180) In this mythological context, familiarity and complicity with creatures of the marine universe are natural. They can be social partners, lovers, or courtiers. Fish are not prey to be appropriated, rather they are individuals with whom one interacts. With regard to Tonga, I will sketch a quick pic ture of the pre-Christian religion, specifically with regard to the shark and its forms in this region of Polynesia. The Tongan pantheon, assembled in the July 200I 87</page><page sequence="2">mythical island called Pulotu, was generally peopled with a great number of gods, kindly or even mis chievous — to the point of being qualified as evil demons by missionaries (S.M. Reuter 1907). Some of these visit mortals incarnated as zoomorphic crea tures. Several were embodied in living representa tions, fish and fowl, called the vaka, boats or recep tacles of the gods. The priests, taula 'otua, anchors of the gods, kept them on earth among mortals. Five of the vaka were sharks. This pantheon, partially based on marine environment and an oceanic semi ology, was very hierarchized in Tongan culture. The story is consistent with this proverb from the Lau Islands, the close neighbors of the Fiji4 Islands, brought back by A.M. Hocart (1978:232): "You must always go in twos, if you want to avoid shark bite." As the author explains: "the custom was that each chief had a second."5 The shark, in the abstract, filled the duty of chief's second and as a sort of guardian and companion. the powers of the god Haehaetahi, who was embod ied in shark form. During a kava^ ceremony, he jos tled the priestess representing him among men, declaring the shark god she embodied as defeated. The people around him feared this insult would cause the shark god to turn on them. He then swam to the open sea, calling the shark gods by name, but they did not come. Then he sent a man to swim in the open sea to see if the Christian god would save him from shark attack, since the shark gods natu rally would take revenge on the swimmer (Latukefu 1974:64). The man returned to the beach safe and sound; which proved that the future king had van quished the shark gods. Having tested the might of the Christian god, he converted to Christianity. This Tongan myth of the shark's origin reveals its divini ty since it comes from Pulotu, world of the gods and ancestors. Although some gods were incarnated in living creatures, others were embodied in inanimate objects; small wood or sperm whale7 ivory sculp tures; material creations made by man as supports for symbolic connotations that will be examined later in regard to other regions of Oceania. The former importance of sharks in Tongan reli gion is reflected in this legend about how the Tongan chief, Tupou I, tested the authenticity and power of the ancient gods compared to the one God of the Christians, before adopting the Occidental religion (for political reasons not discussed here). He tested The former importance of the shark as god is also revealed in the way men used to prepare for shark Figure ι. Map of Oceania. According to B. Anell (1955), shark is fished with a slipknot everywhere in the Pacific except Marshall Islands, Solomon Islands, Vanuatu and New Caledonia 88 Pacific Arts</page><page sequence="3">fishing expeditions. Before leaving to fish, the men used to spend several nights in the taboo fishing house preparing their fishing tackle and performing separation and purification rites in order to appear before Hina (the female form of the shark god) puri fied from all feminine stain. The ritual was an inte gral part of shark fishing surrounded by numerous sexual taboos. A man abstained from sexual relations for a month before shark fishing and did not par ticipate if his wife was pregnant.^ Upon their return, the men performed a rite that lifted the taboo and allowed return into society, especially that of the women. The catch, forbidden for sale, is distributed by hierarchic order: the fishing chief's sister first,9 the village noble next, and then church representa tives. with feminine odors to estrange the shark. J. G. Frazer (1981:597), in 1927, noted this taboo of chasti ty for success in hunting and fishing existed in a great many societies. B. Malinowsky (1918:89) furnishes even more convincing illustrations of this sexual symbolism from the village of Kaibuola in the Trobriand archipelago where the shark is caught on line in October and November: "at the beginning of each shark-fishing season, new canoes are built and the old ones overhauled...no noise is allowed in the village...all the village has to keep the sex taboo... when the fisherman goes out on an expedition he (that is, the magician who stays on the beach away from his wife and family) opens wide the door of his house and sits on the platform without his pubic clothing, keeping the legs apart. This is said to make the shark keep his mouth wide open and catch on to the bait. Sometimes he sits in the same position on the beach, singing to attract the shark." The sex ual allusion is evident; the sorcerer sets his wife apart in order for him to have a relationship with the shark, to whom he offers his virility. If on land the shark is second to the chief, at sea it is perceived as a woman whom the fisherman must seduce. Fishermen also describe the metaphoric story of the shark god's capture. In human form the shark is a woman named Hina, the fiancée of the Oceanic mythological hero. He draws her to his canoe with seductive words so they can lie together.10 In this account, the shark is captured with a slip knot,11 the metaphor for a garland of flowers. The shark is spo ken to with words of royal formality and is also offered royal food. Once held by the knot, it is exhausted by being pulled along behind the canoe. Once it is tired, the shark offers no resistance to being pulled into the boat, where it is slaughtered with a club that represents the awaiting royal head rest. This sexual symbolism characterizing the rela tionship of man and shark in the Tonga Islands is found all over Oceania where sharks are likewise captured with a slip knot. There appears an amorous rivalry between women and shark. In Hawai'i, fish ermen spent the preceeding night apart from every one, women in particular, in an imua sanctuary, (Malo 1951:210). In the Marquesas Islands (Handy 1927:284), as well as on the island of Pari in Papua New Guinea (Pulsford 1975:108), in Fiji (Tippet 1968) and at Lesu in New Ireland (Powdermaker 1933), fishermen performed a purification rite and slept in a sacred place before leaving for sea. In the village of Kontu in east New Ireland, women com pete to attract the young men who fish the shark into their gardens.12 According to some, their intent is to exhaust the virility of the men, who must conserve their strength for the shark the next day (Brouwer 1983:65); but most of all, they impregnate their lover Information collected in the field testifies to another perception of the shark in Tonga (Bataille Benguigui 1994) as someone in charge of the village social equilibrium. If anomic circumstances, in the Durkheimian sense of the term1^ (Dürkheim 1967: 36off), develop on land while the men are at sea; if there has been an argument in the crew; or if one of them has committed an unavowed transgression before boarding, the shark will avoid the slip knot and the fishermen will come back home empty handed: they will not sound the conch announcing the catch to break the silence and the hunting secre cy. The shark is also perceived as a judge in that he only attacks persons who have transgressed custom ary taboos, or nowadays, Christian morals such as stealing the church's kerosene or committing adul tery with the pastor's wife. In short, if your con science is clear, you can go overboard in all the south seas, and nothing bad will happen to you! This brief survey of the shark's symbolism, shared by numerous sea-oriented Oceanic societies, leads us to turn our attention to specific artifacts so as to gain even better insight. I have chosen four types of objects representative of the shark's iconic image to illustrate this: clubs, stone, sculpture, and skull reliquary. July 200I 89</page><page sequence="4">The Shark in Material Representations from risks and mitigates his weaknesses or incom petences. The size of the sign has no effect on the symbolic efficiency (Shapiro 1982:24) due to con straint in the field of expression with other figures — warriors, other fish, moon crescents, and other representations — all in the same scale (see Fig. 2). The Tongans, the great chiefs at least, were known in the past as warriors and colonizers. They would leave on expeditions as far off as Micronesia, where they established trading posts. They seem to be responsible for the islets of Polynesian culture in Melanesia and Micronesia that are called Polynesian Outliers in English literature. Did man feel pro tected by the representation of his 'second,' a kind of spiritual companion in the physical and mental universe of war, accompanied by even a small mate rial representation of the shark as a power symbol on a weapon? Engraved Wooden Clubs — the Warrior s Travel Companion Clubs from Western Polynesia are engraved with geometric designs sometimes drawn from nature with tools of stone, shell, or sharks' teeth. According to William Churchhill (1917:140 pi. XIV and table 54) "A representation of the fish (shark) was the sign of a very solemn tabu of prop erty and forecast the punishment by the shark of any violation thereof." In this commentary, Churchill seems unaware of the portrayals of the relationship between man and shark in Oceania described by R. H. Codrington (1891) and to those following. According to K. St. Cartmail (1997:134), among the decorations of all kinds (including human portray als encountered on clubs), the zoomorphic icons, such as the shark, were not only decorative, but pro pitiatory and intended to obtain support and inter cession from the gods in combat. Since in Fiji (Hocart 1978) and in Tonga (Gifford 1929), the shark is seen as a mediator between man and gods, as a tie between sea and island, as well as a social partner (Bataille-Benguigui 1988, 1994), we can hypothesize that its iconic sign on clubs signi fies it to be the warrior's double who protects him Stone Cult Object Representing the Shark-god Figure 2. Sections of clubs from from Western Polynesia (Tonga and 'Uvea, Wallis Islands) bearing shark-motif engravings. The two on the left (from the Tonga Islands) have a quadrangular terminal section1? with incised representations of rays, turtles, birds, people, and lance-brandishing warriors. I would term this image portrayal "the chiefs insignia." (left to right: Private collection, Paris; Museum der Kulturen, Basel; MNAAO,18 Paris) This perception of the shark would also explain why the shark is, in the Tonga Islands, a source of inspiration for song, poetry, and dance (Bataille Benguigui 1994:211-215). Naturally formed, extremely patinated, presenting the appearance of a shark with two eyes and a sketch 90 Pacific Arts</page><page sequence="5">of a rounded slit on the inferior part of the muzzle,14 this stone15 collected at the beginning of the centu ry by E. Caillot entered into the collections of the Musée de l'Homme with the notice "stone repre senting the shark-god" given by the collector. Indeed, Caillot writes16 in 1909, "The Polynesians also had fish-gods, fish being their principle food stuff. An old sorcerer told me that the natives car ried these gods in ceremony to the sea's edge, and that each species approached his god, allowing abundant catches!... The most venerated of these fish-gods being the shark and the tuna." It is inter esting to note in passing that later the author men tions, "one stone portraying the largest tuna mea sured 1.5m long and weighed approximately 250kg." The tuna-god is rarely evoked in Oceania, although this fish holds a priviledged status. A monumental sculpture supposedly representing the god of tuna fishermen from the Easter Islands can be seen in the Musées royaux d'Art et d'Histoire of Brussels (L'île de Pâques, Une Enigme 1990:351). These phrases by Caillot on the shark-god are accompanied with a note: After much research I am able to procure one of these fish-gods, a stone shark that is one of the rarities of my Polynesian antique collec tion. The natives wanted to see it; I showed it to them, they looked with superstitious fear and refused to touch it, some pretending that it might not please the new God, the one from the Bible; most gave no explanation and soon left. (Caillot I, p. 96) According to W. Ellis of the London Missionary Society, who stayed in Polynesia from 1816 to 1824 and Raiatea in 1819, among the fourteen leading marine divinities, the two principle ones, Tuaraatai and Ruahatu, were called atoa mao, gods of sharks. Ellis elaborates ...the natives believed that the marine gods used sharks as executioners of their vengeance. Only the great blue shark was the gods' ser vant. The priests attributed to them many of the strangest and most fabulous infamies. The natives believe that these voracious animals always recognize a priest on board a canoe, that they will come to his call, will leave at command, and in the case of shipwreck, even spare him although they would devour his companions... A man being an atoa mao priest, the shark of his god appeared in the sea, carried him or his father, on his back from Raiatea to Huahine, lands 20 miles dis tant. (Ellis 1967:11:196, 1972:1:209) Not far from Raiatea, in Tahiti, a king's enthrone ment ceremonies consisted of his walking into the sea and bathing in it for purification. He then con tinued by boat to indicate his rule over the Ocean and to receive homage from the powers of the ocean depths. During this voyage, Tuumaho andTaui, two deified sharks, half-gods of the sea, were called by the priest of the god Oro to congratulate the new king on his coming to office (Ellis 1972, vol; 2:538). T. Henry,also tells that in Tahiti, The fish were emanations of gods and were believed to also be possessed by disembodied spirits of those lost at sea... The great blue shark, which the natives said to not be very voracious, was the emanation of Mao purotu (a fine-looking shark) from the living waters of Tane in heaven...The sharks possessed by spirits of the dead never hurt members of their family when met at sea, on the contrary they would assist them, carrying them on their backs or in the jaws to land; sometimes they emmitted sounds similar to the human voice. (Henry 1968:400). Also, with the aid of a blue shark, Taruia, a petty chief of Tahiti escaped from death and was able to marry a princess from Pare (Henry 1968:632-639). The same author notes a legend, collected in 1825, in which a stone incarnated by the god Ta'aroa is endowed with a divine power. The story tells that one day a man brought in on his line a stone endowed with a mysterious power. He tried to throw it back to sea, but it stayed inexorably fastened onto the hook. He was advised by priests "that it was pos sessed by the spirit of Ta'aroa and placed it in a hoi Figure 3.

In this area the stone became the god of the fishermen, who would bring offerings of fishes" (Henry 1968:313-314). Enriched with symbolic knowledge, it represents an accumulation of a theological initiatory education. Rare for the isomorphism of a fish venerated by Oceanic peoples, more than for the esthetic feelings it provokes, this stone joins the list of natural shapes that 'resound' in the human spirit, described so well by Y. Le Fur (1990) concerning natural objects that are accepted and loved, different the world over. These diverse sources clarify how this stone became a cult object and, today, museum object. A natural work untouched by the hand of man, this object of nature without author became an object of meaning due to its particular form. The myth is undecipherable without the key supplied by its cul tural context. An interface between man and gods, this singular form filled with invisible forces testifies to the encounter between natural form representing god as a sacred spiritual reality and iconic idea mate rialized by the image. Its meaning is accessible only to the initiated, those who were prepared since youth to see in the shark a god or its incarnation, a symbolic presence that links the relationship of man and his natural environment with the supernatural. The Anthropomorphized Shark-god In 1934 during one of his stop-overs, Charles van den Broek searched for a representation of the shark god, which, he writes, was already rare at the time. He visited all the fishermen's communal houses on the island of Ndeni (presently called Nendo) in the Santa Cruz Islands, Solomon archipelago. In the vil lage of Nimbelowi he found a small sculpture of the shark-god driven on a post inside the communal house (Fig. 4).

Before leaving to fish, the natives give it fine offer ings, after which they are reassured the god will pro tect them (Broek 1939:123). But they do not want to give him it. He searched on and finally 'buys' one in the village of Nimbelowi that he must "... himself unfasten from the pole. Everyone attentively watched this White who did not fear to touch this powerful god. When I had it in my hands, no one would approach me. During their next expedition, the sharks would certainly have attacked them" (Broek 1939:125). There is reason to believe that the shark gods could be of different sizes, sitting as well as stand ing, with a base set on the ground or high up on a pole driven in the floor, like the one at the Musée de l'Homme (Fig. 5) and a similar example at the Museum of Mankind.2^ The object measures 10 cm. high; the one in the drawing, taking into account the scale provided by skulls and rolls of feather money,24 can be estimated at 50 cm. These wooden anthropomorphic figures, called dukas, generally masculine, in various dimensions from several cen timeters to more than a meter (Gillett 1939 and many other authors), are well represented in muse ums. Whatever their size, they all have long, reced ing foreheads, conical hair styles, prominent, angu lar jaws, an stiffly held arms and legs, and tense expressions. Some are decorated with disks of shell on the chest, ankle ornaments, and a piece of bark cloth girding the waist. It is said that the duka rec ollect the dead ancestor and are related to shark fish ing. According to Gillett, most of these smaller duka were "taken on fishing expeditions to bring good luck and calm weather" (Gillett 1939:153). After this description, how can one not be impressed with the similiarity between the corporal attitudes of the fishing sorcerer described by B. Malinowski in the Trobriand Islands, spoken of ear lier, and this small statue, in societies several hun dred miles distant? How can one not link this object with the suggestive description in which the fishing sorcerer bares himself in solitude, facing the sea, to attract the shark into a privileged and sexualized relationship? These comparisons attest a common Oceanic perception of the shark, expressed accord ing to characteristics of each society's material and behavior variations. Shark-Shaped Reliquary — A Place for the Metamorphosis of Man into Ancestor This repository for human bones, made of light wood in the form of a large fish, represents a myth ical shark. The central part is hollowed out and fit ted with a lid, intended to hold the skull of a high ranking person who will incarnate a shark after having received the longest funerary cycle. Its cau dal fin is crescent shaped and the four smaller fins are attached with tenons.25 These fish reliquaries, generally sharks, sometimes bonito (a tuna, Sarda Chilensis2^) — the distinction being sometimes dif ficult as in this case — were sheltered in the boathouse, which was used as the men's house and fishing house. There are three shapes, all halieutic, corresponding with the hierarchic stature of the deceased. The first, tarigau, was a tapered hoop net of bamboo strips. The second, aigaininuni, was a July 2001 93</page><page sequence="8">Figure 6. Shark-shaped skull reliquary, "place for the metamorphosis of man into ancestor."

The human body pierced by shark jaws recalls the myth of Karemanua, a man metamorphosed into a shark, which bites the body of his brother, Kakafu, for having observed his trans formation into a powerful god and his passage from the living world to the world of gods and ancestors (Davenport 1968:11, Green 1973:17-18, and Waite 1979:256). The object holding our attention here deserves some consideration concerning physical character istics from the biologists' viewpoint. The pinnules, both dorsal and anal, under the body, and crescent shaped caudal fin identifies fish as a bonito from the Scombridés (Thunidés family). However the gill slits, and even more so, the presence of a human body transfixed in the jaws recalls the Karemanua myth and would make it an elasmobranchiate, a shark. / In the eastern Solomon Islands the shark occu pies a priviledged place among the animals linked with the spirit world. It can be the incarnation of an ancestor or a tutelary animal who has a special rela tionship with a village, family, or individual. The myth, the imaginary, and the esthetic creation asso ciate shark, bonito, and frigate bird as the symbol of chance and safety. Their representations are every where: on canoes, men's houses, fishnet floats, and domestic objects such as bowls and plates. It is said of sharks that they bring aid to bonito fishing, which itself is partly supernatural. In the southeast Solomon Islands (San Cristobal, Malaita, Guadalcanal, Ulawa, Santa Catalina, and Santa Ana), the three iconic images are associated with an initiation rite in which bonito fishing trans forms young boys into men. This is the malaohu cer emony (Codrington 1891, Ivens 1927, Waite 1989). In Santa Catalina, the boy is taken to sea like a fish — by canoe lying on his back with a bonito across his chest. In order to become a man he swallows some drops of bonito blood, the fish's mouth is passed over his body, the body is annointed with a mixture of sand and fish blood. This is supposed to weaken him, afterwards his health is regained by acquiring the status of man, after having been kept in seclusion from society for a time and away from feminine contact. Bonitos are considered as young virgins and guarded by sharks, just as young boys are treated like newborns during the ritual, being fed on liquids by the persons who guard them during the first days of seclusion. Later they are reinserted into society, exhibited on a platform in the village, their arms decorated with drawings of protector frigate birds. The young boy who became a bonito fish by this sea voyage was transformed into a man/preda tor, bonito fisherman. The vital cycle is completed through different ritual phases and a symbolic anthropophagy occurs since man captures and con sumes the bonito with which the initiated is identi fied. Once a man, he can be metaphorically identi fied with other birds and sharks who are both predators and guardian/protectors.2^ Only an initi ated man can go bonito fishing. The first bonito caught is immolated for the spirits of ancestors whose skull is kept in the big fish of sculpted wood — receptacles or reliquaries, like Figure 6. In the 94 Pacific Arts</page><page sequence="9">eastern Solomon Islands, while the bonito allows passage from boyhood to manhood, the shark is the metaphor that permits the passage from life to death. In other words the child becomes man by becoming a bonito; he attains the world of the dead by metamorphosing into a shark. The rituals accompanying this initiatic passage from one state to another rely mainly on metamorphic animal transformations. We frequently find plastic repre sentations half-man, half-shark (sometimes femi nine), testifying to passage from one world to anoth er. The physical features change (sometimes at the head or waist in vertical portrayals), but in these hybrid descriptions the shark always occupies the upper part of the body and head (stylistic charac teristics described and studied by Waite (1979:255). In the western Solomons (New Georgia, Santa Isabel, Choiseul) society focuses on bonito fishing linked with head-hunting expeditions; their por trayals depict anthropomorphic figures, crocodiles, and various birds. Sharks and bonitos are migratory species from the exterior, from the world of the gods or dead in origin myths, the same as chiefs and kings of Polynesian and Fiji Island societies descended from immigrant groups. In a similar manner the 'stranger-king' (Sahlins 1989:90) remains stranger, endowed with a spiritual power over the society in transit. Sharks and chiefs are assimilated, as in the Hawaiian proverb: "a chief is a shark who travels on land."3° The Shark, Mythical Hero of Ocean and Land Sharks are present all over Oceania. Their image inhabits individual and collective imaginary and plastic representations. They appear in realistic, symbolic, idealistic images — as man's equal, ances tor, protector, god, or judge — as the incarnation of spirits or ritual objects. Are they fish, men, or even women?'1 D. Czarkowska Starzecka and B. A. L. Cranstone'2 draw attention to the notched wood decorated with zoomorphic designs, or knotted cord accompanying red feather money of Santa Cruz islands correlated with the number of captured sharks counted just like the frequency of feminine conquests. I will mention a few other examples of shark imagery to illustrate further this pan-Oceanic phenomena. Solomon Islanders in Aréaré sing a magic song 'Race' (Zemp, 1995:160—175) for each long sea canoe trip for pleasure, family reunions, or trade. Builders of large canoes are sea people who possess shark ancestors. Pigs, money, shells, and areca nuts are immersed in the sea as offerings to those who will guide them during the trip. All trips progress under the shark ancestors' hospitality, guiding and push ing the canoe, making it 'roll' one way or another according to the message of approval or disagree ment they wish to transmit to the paddlers. In New Ireland (Papua New Guinea), in the vil lage of Lorolargum,33 shark-calling is an art, accom panied by rituals transmitted from generation to generation (G. Köhnke 1974:12).34-The shark callers display their courage, ability, and strength when they capture the shark. They call by shaking a rat tle, larung (made of coconut halves strung on a trop ical creeper), in the water.-55 In addition to the slip knot, there is another accessory for fishing in this region of Oceania. It is a piece of wood, kasaman, usually cut in the shape of a propeller, sometimes sculpted and attached to the slipknot, operating as a shackle.Termed as a brake or a drag by J. Hornell (1950:11), this light wood floater "prevents the shark from fleeing until he is exhausted by the device that hits him and hinders his flight, and is hoisted into the pirogue and slaughtered by clubbing." Ethnologists also describe this float as being "a pro tection for the hands of the fisherman against the shark's teeth" (Anell 1955:44 citing Groves 1936). Shark fishing, apart from being sport, bears an important social and initiatic aspect. A young boy becomes adult only after he has taken a shark in his noose; he is then no longer obliged to hunt it. When he comes back with his first catch, he is provoked into a simulated fight and thrown into the water along with the dead fish. This simulation aims to kill the boy in him who is unable to catch shark and give Figure 7. Sculpted stone in the shape of a shark for the Bung Be ceremony. L. 39cm. W. 13.5cm. H. 7.4cm.

In the vil lage of Kontu on the east coast, shark callers store the magic and the sculpted shark-shaped stones that contain their spirit in their houses (Brouwer 1983:66). They assemble several of these stones (Fig. 7) on a platform facing the sea in the men's house for the 'BungBe (shark group) ritual. This men's cer emony takes place in secret, forbidding all contact with women and the ingestion of pork; signs of pol luting influence from land. The stones are kept in the shark caller's house, out of view, and are passed on from one generation to the next. The sharks allow men to become initiated and to reproduce. The vil lage comprises eleven groups or clans, each headed by a man whose duty it is to call the sharks. He lives in a house surrounded by a low wall, a place inher ited from his maternal uncle. Shark fishing is forbidden to women. They are not to touch the fishing devices — rattle, float, noose and slipknot, club — nor may they board a canoe used for the shark. It would take on the fem inine odors, among others the menstrual blood, and the shark would flee. Consequently, it is also for bidden for fishermen to have relations with a woman, or to eat pork, lizard, crab, and land ani mals before leaving for sea. Any transgression of these separation rite taboos will bring failure to the fisherman. However, he may purify himself from taboo sexual relations by appealing to the shark caller of his group, who will prescribe drinking salt water, smearing the body with coral powder, and jumping over a fire (Köhnke 1974:97). Another example of the ritual importance of the shark image is provided by H. H. Frankel for the vil lage of Walomo, near Vanimo on the northwest coast of New Guinea. There the fishermen's canoes bear chiseled zoomorphic clan decorations on the hulls and sculpted animal, bird, and fish designs that follow the sinuous bow lines. (Fig. 8) The ancestors said a canoe is a man whose head is the bow's fig urehead. The beauty of a man is linked to that of the bow. In Walomo culture, "A young man had to catch a shark (with a slipknot as well) before he could go through a certain stage of the initiation ceremonies; after this stage of initiation he could become mar ried. Thus the catching of a shark is synonymous in Walomo culture with acquiring a wife" (Frankel 1:978:53, 56). Men, like their canoes, are subject to a ritual cleansing meant to purify them from the fem inine world before meeting the shark. As we have seen in other parts of Oceania, in the Walomo cul ture women and sharks are thought of on the same level. In Tonga the presence of a man on board who has commited a fault or has had sexual relations before leaving for sea could be the cause for failure, unless the man confessed of it publicly. This obligation of moral and physical purity for men as well as canoes for the interrelations between man / sea / fish is found both in warm and cold seas. On the other side of the world, in an article concerning the shark's place in Icelandic thinking, G. Palsson (1990:123) notes the necessity of a pure craft for a good catch, "One of the ocean taboos implied that if the boat contained some dirt belonging to the land the catches were bound to be poor. A boat had to be pure. During fishing, its terrestrial nature had to be suppressed." The shark's representation is so widespread in Oceania that a socio-cultural and environmental approach cannot be the only one. Sharks and boni tos (tuna in general) are considered to be fish that have blood that is warm, red, and abundant, a char acteristic shared with men and perhaps more pre cisely with the notion of femininity. (Other fish are generally white-blooded, without hemoglobin; and cold-blooded.) Because of these warm-blooded characteristics they belong to a particular part of the animal kingdom that makes them closer to humans. Some species of sharks, like the hammerhead^ have a vivipare reproduction similar to that of man.3° Could this be why links exist between Pacific islanders, these fish, and their many portrayals?... In any case, these priviledged relationships and this interpretation of the world and nature is conveyed in expressions and imagery, and adds meaning to material creations. As J. P. Changeux (1994: 39) writes, access to the multiple meanings of a repre sentation "depends on the cultural impregnation of the spectators and more generally, the stocked infor mation in their long-term memory." This informa tion comes from the physical and cultural environ ment, and the oral tradition and mythology for Oceanic societies. From the same author, concern ing esthetic pleasure, "The idea of a picture does not appear from nowhere. The creative combinations works on pre-structured elements. The artist calls upon 'mnemotechnic' images and depictions, a vocabulary of forms and figures balanced in their 96 Pacific Arts</page><page sequence="11">intellectual connections, the same as the maternal language, during a long epigenetic process, through synapsis selection that marks each individual with a particular impression" (Changeux 1994:51). It is the same for shark portrayals, mental and public. On clubs, shark-shaped reliquaries, shark-gods, and other objects, the image does not come out of nowhere. The concept of the 'good shark' is proba bly part of the 'elementary images' (Changeux 1983:174) of the Oceanic mind given by sensory per ception of the environment, by narrated myths, and oral traditions. This is a possible explanation for it frequent iconic image, ideal or material, in insular Oceania. Perhaps it is also why the meaning of this same elementary image has different connotations in our Occidental societies. Figure 8. Walomo canoe prow (drawing by H. Frankel 1978) July 2001 97</page><page sequence="12">Conclusion ers that do not belong to this world by localising them in a precise shape and a fixed place." They evoke, "the absence by their presence of the else where by that which is in view" (Vernant 1965: 337-343)· They 'presentify the invisible. With these Oceanic objects we go from the 'iconic idol,' such as the stone shark-god, to the zoomorphic figure, passing by the anthropomorphization of the fish, and the two-dimensional image to three dimen sions. The demonstration that leads from the "pre sentification of the invisible to the imitation of appearance" is carried out by peoples dispersed in the ocean sharing not only the same common cul tural patrimony, but the same cult for the shark. In the ethno-zoological domain, shark and bonito are for Polynesia and insular Melanesia what the crocodile, cassowary, and other animal species are to continental Melanesia. These four iconic images represent man's duality of protector and predator typical in Oceanic societies. This example of the shark chosen from a vast and homogenous iconolo gy characterizes the insular Oceanic domain. It is only the preamble, the conductor that leads us toward the systems of portrayal whose source is the ocean environment in which these societies evolve. In this environment as a basis for viewpoints, com munication, and exchange between insular peoples, and also as a resource supplier, men and fish inter mingle. In present day life, as in the past, there is an overlap of images of canoes, fishhooks, fishnets, men, and souls of deceased ancestors, meriting fur ther study. These images link men and islands to make one unique space for land and ocean, where men and sharks cross each other without fear as long is certain interdictions are respected. 1 recall an înteesting event in riji that appeared in the Courrier International in December 1999.^9 hor those wishing to celebrate the millenium in exotic style, Fiji seemed the perfect choice. But take care of avenging sharks. Ratu Glanville Lalabalavu, tui cakau, paramount chief of the Cakaudrove province died last month. Local custom dictates that strict mourning be observed for 100 days, starting on November 4, ending mid-Februry. Partying, snorkelling and diving in this province should be banned. The chief family, under the pressure of the tourist officials, have accepted to limit the area covered by the ban. Another chief, Ratu Tevita Vakalalabure, has warned he will use ancient rites to call up sharks to attack revellers, a successful deter rent in the past which appears to have an impact again. The Guadian 6/12/99 This news item under the heading 'Unusual' was absolutely not so for the islanders, as I have shown. It was significant of the enduring respect men have for the shark. I conclude with J. P. Vernant's Greek example of rorms covered with images. Our Oceanic objects are acts of figuration,' a bit like the Greek 'divine idols.' rhey are intended "to give to view the invisible pow Acknowledgements [ thank Marie France Fauvet-Berthelot, Bernard Juillerat, Yves Le Fur, and Philippe Peltier for their amicable and critical reading of this paper and Eric Gonthier for his information concerning the description of the stone shark-god.

The origin of this article is a communication for the APRAS (Association for Research in Social Anthro pology) conference "Iconologie de l'object: reflex ion anthropologique" organized by C. F. Baudez, M. Coquet, and D. Geirnaert in May 1996. Some of the places mentioned in this paper have not been visited recently by anthropologists but we may imagine that shark rituals might still be performed. For this reason the ethnographic present is used. This paper was originally presented at the PAA Festschrift for Philip Dark in Chicago on October 1999. 2. See M.C. Bataille-Benguigui 1988. 3. 1 do not know of an Oceanic society that allows women to go on the open sea to fish. It is equally rare in other regions of the world. 4. Fijian society is sometimes considered Melanesian, other times Polynesian depending on what anthro pologists wish to demonstrate. It presents many racifac Arts</page><page sequence="13">similarities with Tonga in organization and its rela tionship with the supernatural. Tongans and Fijians have numerous reciprocal influences, social and economic interrelations, alternating conflict and harmony. 5. The dualism of power that comprised a sacred chief, tui, and a secular chief, sau or hau, existed in Tonga until the middle of the last century. 6. A ceremonial drink made from pepper root, fresh or dried, according to local practice, crushed and mascerated in water, used all over Polynesia. 7. There exists in museums only three specimens in wood and six in ivory, all feminine and from Ha'apai. Very little is known of them compared to the representations of tiki (gods, ancestors, or heads of lineage) sculpted in wood or stone, known in central and peripheral Polynesia, Hawai'i, Easter Island, and New Zealand. Although the fabrication of three-dimensional religious objects has disap peared since 'contact' Tongan society today spon taneously expresses its individual and collective imagination in the art of the spoken word and graphic art on bark cloth of considerable size that depict their history through decoration. The same can be said of performing arts such as poetry, tales, song, and dance. 8. This sexual interdiction is widespread in Oceania. It is also found in other parts of the world. Authors note the same for hunting. 9. Social organization of the Tongan society is based on two principles: the eldest is superior to the youngest of the same sex and the sister, even if younger, is superior to the brother. 10. Hina and Sinilau are Polynesian mythological fig ures. Persons of great beauty, they are found all over in Oceania, with spelling variations. 11. The technique is identical in numerous parts of Oceania. See descriptions by C. van den Broek (1936:123-124) in Santa Cruz, E. C. Brouwer 1983 for the east coast of New Ireland, P. Buck in Hawai'i (1957), R. H. Codrington in the Solomon in 1891 (1972:318), H. Frankel 1978 for the coast of Wanimo, west Sepik, G. Köhnke 1974 in New Ireland, E. Pritchard in 1866 in Raratonga, and Aitutaki in the Cook Islands and Samoa (1968:172), H. Powdermaker in Lesu, New Ireland (1933), R. Radiguet (1967:189) in the Marquesas in 1929, L. Rollin (1974:62) in the Marquesas in 1929, and many others if we were to be complete. B. Anell (i955:42-—54) draws up a map showing the distrib ution of this technique's practice, which covers nearly all the Pacific and Indonesia excepting part of the Solomon and the Tuamotu Islands. Few authors tackle the symbolic aspects. 12. Gardens are the places for sexual relations. 13. According to Dürkheim, anomia' is the result of the disintegration of the norms that rule human behavior and maintain social order. 14. E. Gonthier, ethno-mineralogist at the Muséum National d'Histoire Naturelle, describes and com ments on this object: "Piece of black, alluvial, high density basalt, of a quadrangular and oblong form, possessing a natural fissure on the largest end. This fissure providing the shark mouth could have been slightly accentuated to increase its ressemblence with this fish. On the first third or narrower, pos terior part, three edges and the interior right side show a series of marks made by a chisel. Several hypotheses can be made to interprete these scars: the marks could be in imitation of the shark's skin composed of thousands of small, scale-shaped indentations, or could be signs of slight work on the stone to accentuate its form — or the stone hav ing sonorous qualities like a lithophone. The marks could also be those of a stone hammer." (personal communication) 15. Gift of Mrs. de Rocheprise, sister of E. Caillot, musician, traveller, and historian who stayed in Polynesia from 1896 to 1903 and from 1912 to 1913. The work is illustrated in his 1909 publication, PI. LXXXVI captioned, "Shark-god, in black stone. This stone comes from the well-known marae of Opoa" (also named Taputapuatea — literally taboo taboo god. Personal communication from J. Garanger), "in the island of Raiatea, of the Society archipelago." This marae, a cult platform in central Polynesia consecrated to the god Oro, would be, according to the author and oral tradition, the old est platform on these islands; this age has not been questioned since by archeologists. 16. Chapter VIII titled: "Antiquities of Western Polynesia" in his 1909 work, about 'idols' repre senting tuna that had been burned long ago by Protestant missionaries. We note the expression antiquity' used by Caillot probably recalls pre- or proto-historic scientific or archéologie collections rather than a cabinet of curiosities.

This money is constructed of small plates covered with scarlet feathers from the bird myzomela cardi nalis, one of the most beautiful in Oceania. Made on the island of Ndende, they are used specially for buying wives, pigs, and as payment for different types of work (Waite 1983:146). They are kept in the fishing house, which is also used as the men's house and boat house. 25. In F.

Following is a commentary by C. Kaufmann (per sonal communication January 2000) concerning some hemming and hawing over the identification of this fish: "It is exactly this refusal to remain in the realm of photographic-style illustration of a natural form which is the basis of a work's artistic quality. The resulting image transforms the iconic aspects into synchronic forms, otherwise forever separated by their differentiated origins on diachronic scale of the evolution of the species." In other words, oral tradition gives the fish its identi fication rather than its physical aspect. 28. W.

Designation given by the author to a village on the northwest coast of New Ireland to respect the wish es of his informant to remain anonymous. The author seems to indicate this village is near Paruai. By comparing names and eliminating too-distant consonances, we could believe it to be the village of Lavongauam near Mangai, in the linguistic area of Kara (communication from B. Derlon). 34.1 thank A. Meyer, who introduced me to this work. 35. The nuts must not be cut by women because they would take on an odor. This device was still used in Tonga in 1990. 36. Several examples of this device exist in museum col lections. One is illustrated in the work of Count R. Festetics de Tolna (1904:49) and comes from the Bismarck archipelago. It is part of the Musée de l'Homme collections and measures 140 cm. long. A third from New Ireland is part of a private col lection. 37. For viviparous sharks, the eggs become embryos implanted on the uterus lining. They are joined to their mother with an umbilical cord and an organ similar to the placenta of higher mammals. Hammerhead sharks "give birth with contractions and apparent birth pains described in mammals" (Cousteau and Paccalet 1997:117-121). 38.1 thank Bernard Séret for having made me aware of this biological approach to anthropological facts. 39.
