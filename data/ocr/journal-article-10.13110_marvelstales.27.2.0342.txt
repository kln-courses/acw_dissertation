I highly recommend this book to s cholars of fairy tales,  particularly those interested in anime and Japanese popular culture. Okuyama Yoshiko University of Hawai‘i, Hilo Anime and Its Roots in Early Japanese Monster Art. By Zilia Papp. Kent, UK:  Global Oriental, 2010. Anime and Its Roots in Early Japanese Monster Art is a welcome addition  to the growing body of academic writing in English on Japanese manga and  anime. However, it suffers from a misleading title, which may alienate its  target audience of Japanese scholars, because it implies an essentialist, total- izing, or even Orientalist perspective that treats all Japanese culture as  unchanging and looks to ancient art or literature to explain modern culture.  This book is not, as the title implies, an overview of classical sources of  contemporary anime or a survey of Japanese cultural elements in anime as a  whole. Papp’s focus is far more specific. She analyzes the work of author  and artist Mizuki Shigeru (b. 1922) and his long-running manga Gegege no  Kitarō (1959–1969) as well as its various offshoots, including an animated  television show (1971–1972; 1985–1988; 1996–1998; 2008) and several  live-action films. Papp catalogs the folklore that influenced Mizuki’s work  and analyzes his creations in terms of the changing uses of folklore in the  twentieth century. Mizuki Shigeru first began writing about Kitarō, the one-eyed monster  boy born in a graveyard, in the 1950s under the title Hakaba no Kitarō  (Graveyard Kitarō) for kamishibai (paper theater) and kashihon (rental comic  books), which were the forerunners of modern manga. In 1959 Mizuki reti- tled the story Gegege no Kitarō, turning his own childhood nickname into a  nonsense word with a spooky sound. He also toned down some of the  horror elements to create a more child-friendly version in manga format.  Kitarō is the last descendant of a race of yōkai (supernatural beings, vari- ously translated as spirits, demons, or monsters) whose serial adventures  involve encounters with hundreds of different creatures, drawn from  Japanese folklore. Gegege no Kitarō is largely unknown to western audi- ences, even among fans of Japanese animation, because it has not been  translated. Nevertheless, it is central to the development of manga and  anime and remains tremendously popular in Japan. Papp’s book is the only  book-length study of Gegege no Kitarō in English. After a brief introduction, Papp begins with an overview of images of yōkai  from prehistoric times to the present. She demonstrates how yōkai began as  342 Marvels &amp; Tales: Journal of Fairy-Tale Studies, Vol. 27, No. 2, 2013 MT_27.2_11_BM.indd   342 19/09/13   1:23 PM </page> <page sequence="2"> rEVIEwS the embodiment of common fears of death and disease in earliest written  records through the medieval period and then changed in the Edo period  (1600–1868) to represent outcasts and foreigners. with this change, yōkai  became the subject of picture scrolls, chapbooks, and woodblock prints,  giving them corporeal or anthropomorphic form for the first time. Papp  discusses Edo period supernatural tales and ghost stories but in particular the  encyclopedic codices that give the name, illustration, and features of hundreds  of yōkai. Papp ends with a discussion of how yōkai became tools of imperial  propaganda in the Meiji, Taishō, and early Shōwa periods (i.e., from the late  nineteenth century through world war II) and then reemerged as entertain- ment for children in the 1950s and 1960s. In the next brief chapter Papp gives a quick biography of Mizuki and  examines folklore precedents for the main characters in Gegege no Kitarō. Papp  draws most of her biographical details from accounts Mizuki has written of his  own life; he describes himself as having been interested in folklore and art  from an early age. His formative experiences, however, came as a soldier in  world war II, when he was posted to New Guinea from 1943 to 1945. During  his time there, he claims to have had supernatural experiences in the jungle.  while recovering from the loss of his left arm in an air raid, he formed close  friendships with local tribes and became fascinated with their folklore.  Although Papp briefly mentions the influence of South Pacific masks on  Mizuki’s art, she never traces New Guinean folklore in his work but concen- trates almost exclusively on Japanese precedents. In the second half of the  chapter Papp discusses some generalized precedents for Kitarō in Buddhist  tales of babies born to dead mothers or in graveyards and in tales of one-eyed  heroes or monks. However, she does not discuss the more immediate prece- dent, the kamishibai stories of Hakaba no Kitarō from the 1930s. If Mizuki did  not wholly invent this character, then what were the twentieth-century  sources? This seems to be a significant omission. The fourth chapter, “Art History Meets Gegege no Kitarō,” is not only the  longest chapter but also longer than the other chapters combined. Most of this  chapter is a catalog of specific sources for yōkai in Gegege no Kitarō. Mizuki  drew primarily on the Edo period codices by Toriyama Sekien published in the  1770s and 1780s. Papp lists twenty-three yōkai that derive from Sekien’s work,  with a paragraph description of each and comparative illustrations by Sekien,  by Mizuki, and from various seasons of the television anime series. In many  cases the images are identical, suggesting that Mizuki looked at Sekien’s work.  Papp then lists various other sources for an additional twelve yōkai. Finally, she  analyzes the various ways yōkai have been used thematically in Gegege no  Kitarō to deliver antiwar and pro-environmental messages.

In the final chapter, drawing on work by Michael Dylan Foster, Papp argues  that yōkai have become mascots; through the success of Gegege no Kitarō and  other manga and anime featuring folklore elements, yōkai that once were  minor deities or that symbolized humanity’s greatest fears have become cute  commodities. Papp’s book provides a wealth of information on yōkai that has not been  available previously in English. It should be of interest to scholars of Japanese  folklore, art history, and popular culture. Scholars interested in those topics  but who do not speak Japanese, however, may find this a challenging read  because of the large number of Japanese words and titles, which are all  rendered both in (sometimes inconsistently) romanized and Japanese script.  The book is lavishly illustrated, which is unusual in this age of strict copyright  control. Papp’s interdisciplinary praxis, analyzing Gegege no Kitarō in terms of  the evolution of images from Edo to contemporary texts, is compelling and  original. However, these analytic sections are frustratingly brief. Most of the  book reproduces the cataloging tendencies of both Sekien and Mizuki, simply  listing yōkai and their attributes. A more balanced and coherent structure  would help to highlight the analysis, which threatens to become lost in a  collection of details.

All the props, including the costumes, are also white, except  for the devil’s black clothing, and look as though they were made of pieces  of paper folded to appear three-dimensional. Indeed, the whole stage looks  like a large piece of origami, the Japanese art of paper folding. The two- dimensional quality of the stage is enhanced further by the use of shadows,  presumably influenced by wayang kulit, the traditional Indonesian shadow  play. Shadows also act, as it were, as the shadowy doubles of both charac- ters and objects, making the paper-thin originals look even more abstract  and insubstantial. This minimalist yet complex visual effect constantly blurs  and redraws the boundaries between reality and illusion, truth and  344 Marvels &amp; Tales: Journal of Fairy-Tale Studies, Vol. 27, No. 2, 2013 MT_27.2_11_BM.indd   344 19/09/13   1:23 PM </page> </plain_text>
