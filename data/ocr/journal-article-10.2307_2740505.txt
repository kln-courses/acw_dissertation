Discussion and results: Amongst the most provocative papers was Professor Joseph Greenberg's which highlighted the need for further urgent research on the Kordofanian languages which make up one of the two branches of his Niger-Kordofanian language family. He posed the paradox that, because the "investigation of some hither- to little studied Kordofanian language spoken by a miniscule population will add incomparably more to our long-term lin- guistic historical perspective than further study of some single Bantu language," priorities for research may be incom- patible with priorities for educational policy. Dr. B. Haycock's survey of Meroitic culture clearly laid to rest the hypothesis of widespread Meroitic influence in Africa outside a limited area of the middle Nile and demonstrated that the Meroitic lan- guage is still far from being deciphered or even placed within a known language family. One of the major topics discussed was the Arabization of the Sudan both from the anthropological and historical points of view. It was apparent that the acquisi- tion of Arabic as a language should not be confused with the acquisition of Sudanese culture or Islamic religion. This was well brought out in Miss James' paper which described the retention of traditional cul- tures and social patterns amongst the Fung and other peoples of the Sudan and in Dr. Yusuf Hasan's paper from which it is evident that in Darfur at least Islamic influences did not fully penetrate until the 18th century. Natale Akolawin from the Southern Sudan demonstrated the ways in which Islamic law in an Islamic Republic is being modified by custom. It was apparent from the papers by Abdul Aziz and Ali Mazrui that the Sudan represents a marginal African state with marked national integration in the north and ethnic cleavage in the south, sharing a civilization that stretches both north along the Nile and west across the Sahara, both tropical African and Islamic north African. But the direct links except to the north and to the Red Sea are slender. Syd. Umar al-Nagar's paper indicated that 19th-century links from the western Sudan were strengthened by the pilgrim movement which has declined in the 1950's with the growth of nation states and paradoxically the de- velopment of air services. Though the emphasis was largely on the historical aspects of the Sudan's links with surrounding areas from Stone Age Vol. 9 - No. 5 * December 1968 557</page><page sequence="2">times, lively discussion amongst specialists in several disciplines on Professor Joan Lewis' account of "Spirit Possession in Northeast Africa" revealed that a per- vasive spirit possession cult, particularly amongst socially deprived women, known as Zar, is credited to have been diffused from a large number of countries in northern, eastern and western Africa but rarely from the country in which it occurs and to have spread very rapidly in the last fifty years, largely in urban centres. The conference clearly indicated the full reinstatement of the Mahdi in Sudanese history. Hodgkin stressed the links between Mahdism and Messianism and the influence that both these ideolo- gies of the oppressed had on radical national movements in modern Africa. Marxism in Hodgkin's view "attempts to restate truths about man and society already expressed by the revolutionary tradition within both Islam and Chris- tianity." Professor Smirnov's paper brought out the modernizing qualities of the Mahdist state. The conference covered many diverse fields and it was concluded that the very variety of themes discussed demands a greater specialization in the future on separate aspects of Sudanese studies and that in this, the first international con- ference of "Sudanists," the value of look- ing outside the Sudan for cultural parallels and influences was clearly demonstrated. The rapid advances made by Sudanese scholars themselves, largely trained by the University of Khartoum, was one of the most lasting impressions of the conference as well as the scope and local co-operation that exists for future research in the largest African country. It was agreed that future conferences would focus more on some of the regional and discipline-oriented themes raised in the larger scope of this first conference.

Discussion and results: In many ways, the Conference was an important successor to that held at Burg Wartenstein in 1964 (CA 7: 591). The twofold purpose of the Newberry Library Conference was to emphasize the develop- ment of the study of the history of science and ideas, and to indicate gaps and needs in basic research. The statement of pur- pose of the Conference contained the following: "The present situation in the study of the history of linguistics is gener- ally recognized as unsatisfactory. Existing treatments of the subject for the most part do not rise above the level of simple chronicle, or of apologetics for current theories. There are major gaps in basic research and our knowledge of important periods and schools, due partly to the general limitation of attention to aspects of the 19th and 20th centuries and due partly to the small number of know- ledgeable specialists." Comments on the papers were made from the standpoints of history of anthro- pology, sociology of knowledge, and his- tory of science, by Stocking, Wolff, and Greene, respectively. Roman Jakobson summarized the Conference as a whole and initiated discussion of each set of papers. Many issues were raised that could not be adequately pursued in the time avail- able, but it was generally felt that much was gained from the contributions and discussion. Highpoints were the brilliant and comprehensive interventions of Jakobson, and the remarkable meeting of minds in an interpretation of the 19th century quite different from that usually conveyed. Historian participants commented favorably upon the level of the work represented, which shows promise for further development in this field, which, as Jakobson noted, was almost wholly neglected in the United States a generation ago, and whose tech- nical aspects require primary participa- tion by linguists themselves. Publication: Most of the papers from the Newberry Library Conference and some from the Burg Wartenstein Conference will be edited by Hymes and published by the Indiana University Press in its Studies in the [Hi story and Theory of Linguistics.

Discussion: The participants in the meeting were selected from a broad range of disciplines and engaged in free-ranging discussions on sub-Saharan Bantu origins and its related research problems. No formal papers were presented, thereby leaving maximum time for discussion. This brief report summarizes some of the general conclusions of the meeting and sets out certain recommendations made by par- ticipants at the conference; a draft was circulated to all the delegates for exami- nation prior to publication. The meeting began with a detailed presentation of the archaeological evi- dence for the origins of food production in sub-Saharan Africa by Clark. He showed that the climatic changes in the Sahara Desert were an important factor in the diffusion of ideas and processes of the new economies into West Africa, and that sedentary settlement is not a criterion for domestication. The pastoral peoples of the Sudan and Sahara were affected by the gradual desiccation of the desert and slowly moved southwards and eastwards. Experiment, development and adapta- critical factors in the diffusion of agricul- tural techniques over most ofsub-Saharan Africa. The agronomists discussed sor- ghum and millet as well as southeast Asian food plants and showed that im- portant factors were ecological adapta- tions for plant remains and the length of periods required for experimentation to achieve full domestication ofplant species. They also stressed the important differ- ences between eastern and western varieties of sorghum. A highlight of the conference was a presentation by Dalby of Guthrie's lin- guistic evidence, based on a comparative study of over three hundred Bantu lan- guages, including twenty-eight "test languages" studied in considerable depth. The evidence compiled by Guthrie over the last twenty-five years is now in the process of publication and the conference was able to review an impressive body of information. From this information dele- gates concluded that there was an urgent need for the uniform training of com- parative linguists and for the further extension of Guthrie's data, with a view to establishing precisely the geographical distribution of important lexical items and the area covered by his proto-Bantu "nucleus." On the physical anthropological side, Gaherty emphasized that there was a prevalence of typological thinking in African physical anthropology despite its rejection by most evolutionary biologists today. The interpretation of the biological history of the Bantu-speaking peoples has been made difficult by the perpetuation of typological concepts which have been rejected by the synthetic theory of evolu- tion. The diversity shown by living and past populations can be viewed more profitably as naturally occurring varia- tion within evolving, breeding popula- tions than by postulating hybridization between hypothetical ancestral "types." The historians gave a presentation of the historical background to later Bantu movements and settlement and discussed in detail the nature of the evidence and its limitations. They stressed the impor- tance of trade and particularly of detailed studies of ethnographic data as a com- plement to both archaeological studies and the work of oral historians and lin- guists. The final sessions were taken up with a detailed review of research needs and with the formulation of recommen- dations for future research. Conclusions: The archaeologists felt that their evi- dence, though as yet incomplete, suggests the strong possibility of the existence of dense populations, in the peripheral parts of the Congo Basin and in the woodland savannah, during later Stone Age times. Some of these peoples had specialized economies oriented towards fishing and intensive collecting. Although the Bantu languages are by African standards closely related, the linguists present nevertheless postulated that the degree of differentiation existing between present- day Bantu languages could scarcely have come to pass within such a brief period as two millennia, the conventionally ac- cepted chronological limit of the African Iron Age. It was also pointed out that there was no remnant non-Bantu lan- guage in the northwest or central part of the present Bantu area which could be regarded as a possible predecessor of Bantu. There was a wide feeling that the proto-Bantu, namely the speakers of Guthrie's P.B.X., and of his subsequent western and eastern dialects P.B.A. and P.B.B., were perhaps specialized later Stone Age fishermen and "vegecul- turalists" who were using, perhaps plant- ing, such crops as yams and oil palms close to and in the southern fringes of the Congo forests. These people may have spread from there to the central part of the East African coast at an early date. It was conjectured that the banana and other southeast Asian food plants may have been introduced to this area before the Iron Age, but there was a tendency among the agronomists to play down the importance of the Asian food crops. Participants also noted that, from physical anthropological, linguistic, and cultural evidence (such as matrilineal inheritance, anthropomorphic art, secret societies, and spirit possession cults), it was almost certain that the affinities of the central Bantu were with the Negroes of the West African forest rather than with the Nilotes, central Sudanic- speaking Negroes who live immediately to the north of the present Bantu sphere. There was strong support for the notion that the main concentrations of non- Bantu-speaking populations had been in the eastern and southern parts of sub- equatorial Africa; Kushites lived to the northeast, while the Khoi-Khoi (Hotten- tot) speakers and the Bushman lived farther south. Assuming that language and race are closely related, the archaeo- logical record has been interpreted as showing that all these populations go back to later Stone Age times. Cattle were probably brought into sub-Saharan East Africa by Kushites and others during the first millennium B.C., or earlier. Although cereal agriculture was known to the northern Kushites by 2000 B.c. at the latest, there is no evidence as yet to show that they brought crops southwards into East Africa. Recent research suggests that Kushites in the Kenya Highlands were among the last people to adopt an Iron Age economy. Although the archaeological evidence is at present totally lacking, cereal agri- culture may have been introduced into Vol. 9 * No. 5 * December 1968 559</page><page sequence="4">parts of East Africa, and perhaps in much of the subcontinent, by centr Sudanic-speaking peoples living betwe( the Kushites in the east and the Bantu the west. The sorghums and mille grown in most of Bantu Africa are tl eastern varieties. It is probable th agriculture was first introduced into th area prior to the adoption of metallurgic techniques. As yet, Stone Age cere agriculturalists have not been identifir in most of sub-Saharan Africa, but d tailed research in the northern Inte lacustine area might yield critical info mation on this point. Iron-working has been dated at Merc to earlier than the 4th century B.C while it is known to have flourished i West Africa, at Nok, in the same centu: and later. Delegates suggested that likely route, by which iron-working me have spread first into West Africa, w; from the west, from whence it was diffuse southeastwards into Bantu Africa. TI latest research from south Central Afri( indicates that metallurgy was well estal lished in these areas by the 4th centui A.D. Considerable numbers of settlemen have been investigated in Zambia an Rhodesia, but the area to the east an west of the Lualaba is very little know: Advanced metallurgy was certain] flourishing in the Sanga area by ti 8th and 9th centuries A.D., and it is thern fore logical to expect that iron-workin had been practised in this region - least as early as in south Central Afric. if not earlier. The arrival of iron-workir and iron technology may not, therefor have been responsible for the early settl( ment of Bantu-speaking peoples in th southern woodlands, but the new tecd nology may well have led to the expansio of the Bantu from there into easter central, and southern Africa. The relationship of the dimple-base and channelled pottery types of easter and southern Africa has not been studie closely, because the evidence is still ir adequate. However, the former is dir tributed from Kalambo Falls in norther Zambia through Rwanda and Kivu, an as far north as the Nyanza Province Kenya, while outlying sites are foun near Mombasa and in northern Tar zania. Channelled pottery occu: throughout much of Zambia, widely i Rhodesia, and in at least one locality i South Africa. The earliest dates for bot these pottery types have so far fallen i the first half of the first millennium A.D. such readings are consistent with th rapid expansion of population center already well established in the woodland of the southern Congo. The first settle ment of the subcontinent by an immigran group from the eastern parts of Wes Africa would probably have exhibited more gfraduated time scale, and one wit] a different geographical distribution. Thz linking of ancient pottery traditions with modern ones, through the excavation of late medieval settlements known to traditional historians, was seen as one of the ways of determining how far the dimple-based and channelled pottery traditions are likely to have been trans- mitted by rapidly expanding Bantu populations. Another means of tracing the early expansion of the Bantu was judged to lie in an extension of the number of Guthrie's twenty-eight test languages to cover areas at present not represented in such detail. The evidence from traditional history indicates that the Bantu-speaking world may have been centered initially on the Katanga, or at least on the divide of the subcontinent. Oral evidence extends back as far as six hundred years or so from the present in the most favorable areas. Even at the beginning of this time the popula- tion was dense enough to be an incentive for the development of small states over a region extending from the Interlacustrine region in the north to Katanga in the south as well as westward to the Congo mouth and southeastward to Rhodesia and southern Mozambique. Traditional history confirms that some areas in the northeast sector of the present Bantu sphere have been Bantuized compara- tively recently. The most serious gaps in our knowledge relate to the northwest region through which "pre-Bantu," or remote ancestors of the present Bantu-speakers, must al- most certainly have passed. This does not seem to have been an area where there was an early or a rapid expansion of peoples speaking "true" Bantu languages. Guthrie finds, however, that this area contains the Bantu languages with the lowest proportion of common Bantu roots. In this case at least, the sharply falling index of these roots must show something more than sheer distance from the nucleus of the Bantu languages. Neither archaeology nor traditional his- tory have yet contributed any significant data from this area. However, the east end of this region, along the Ubangi and Uele Rivers, has yielded traditional recorcds indicating comparatively recent meeting and contact between Bantu and central Sudanic peoples near the northern forest fringes. The most crucial of all areas for future investigation was deemed to lie in the rela- tions between the peoples living north and south of the Congo forests. Consid- erable argument circulated around the question of how great a barrier the forest was for human settlement. Some regard it as a biotope which sharply con- trasts with the forest margins. The forest environment rapidly modifies physical characteristics, but the populations with the largest stock of common physical characteristics are found all around the forest margins. The archaeologists made the point that most of the forest is prob- ably secondary rather than primary, its present reduced state being due in large part to cutting and burning for cultiva- tion. To Guthrie, the forest has some special quality which may have accel- erated the process of linguistic diversi- fication, although in his scheme it appears as a one-way filter with a high index of common Bantu roots to the south and a very low one to the north. This might indicate a late reflux of Bantu-speaking population from the center of the Bantu world into an area only lightly colonized by collateral descendants of the pre- Bantu. Finally, there was general agreement that the spread of agriculture, the history of domestic animals, and the diffusion of iron tools and metallurgy are all separate problems which have to be considered separately from one another and from the history of Bantu languages. Only when more is known about each separate problem will it be possible to establish meaningful correlations between lan- guages and cultures. Recommendations: (1) The discussions of the previous four days have indicated that there are a number of areas adjacent to, and sur- rounding, the equatorial forest regions which can be expected to yield archaeo- logical data of vital importance to the study of Bantu origins. These areas of most crucial interest lie to the north and south of the Congo Basin, namely in the forest mosaic, savannah, and grassland north of the Ubangi River in the Central African Republic, and in the savannah regions in the central Katanga, Guthrie's supposed nuclear area for the Bantu languages. These areas should be in- vestigated by interdisciplinary teams collaborating in archaeological pro- grams. It is envisaged that the composi- tion of such teams should include a botanist, an ecologist, an oral historian, a zoologist, a Bantu linguist, an ethno- grapher with archaeological training, and a physical anthropologist. The pro- ject must begin with an initial survey followed by the excavation of carefully selected late Stone Age and early Iron Age sites. The excavations must be conducted in such a manner as to yield maximum information concerning eco- nomic and settlement patterns. The analyses and interpretation of informa- tion recovered from these sites must utilize to the fullest possible degree the techniques of the disciplines involved, and reflect close collaboration at all stages in the work. (2) It was recognized that, in all the disciplines represented at this conference, the regions lying immediately to the north and south of the Congo basin were 560 CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY</page><page sequence="5">both the least well known and of t] most crucial importance. Since resear by foreigners in these areas presents speci difficulties, it was felt to be especial important that efforts be made to e courage the training of African schola from these areas. (3) The complexity of the study Bantu origins makes it essential that the be maximum collaboration between tU relevant disciplines and institutions. TI can only be achieved by careful consu tation and co-ordination in the plannir of research, and through the regular e: change of staff and students. The associ; tion of certain disciplines with specif institutions, such as the concentration , twenty-five full-time Africanist linguis at the London School of Oriental ar African Studies, makes it desirable th; such institutions take the initiative i co-ordinating research and teachir within their own fields, and that the institutions bear special responsibility fR the training of future research-worker Visiting studentships and professorshil need to be established at such centres c an international basis, in order that sta and students from foreign universitii may have the opportunity of working,, the relevant institution. This would, f( example, enable British students i archaeology to work in the United State and American students of comparatiN linguistics to work in the United KinE dom; it would also facilitate intei disciplinary training and exchange i such fields as ethnobotany and prm Colonial history. (4) It was recognized that research i traditional history is making a significar contribution to the study of the remot( African past. In the interpretation c archaeology and linguistic data it is c great importance to use the detailei evidence about the development c society and of material culture during th past five or six hundred years. It wa noted that the trend in research i] traditional history is increasingly toward intensive work in particular linguisti communities; since those communitie are small in most of Africa, research wori should justify the heavy investment i: linguistic training by working over , large chronological span in geographi cally limited areas. In all such studies scholarly presentation of the primar, evidence is at least as important as th work of interpretation, and most re search projects need to be conceived ir terms of three or four years of research a dissertation level, including a substantia period spent in the field. (5) The conferencewelcomed the worn of Hiernaux on human variability anc urged that further biological data be collected for populations of historical anc linguistic importance, such as those speaking the test languages used by Guthrie. There is a great need for the study of the osteology of modern Africans, as exemplified by de Villiers' research on South African Negroes, in order to evalu- ate the biological affinities of prehistoric populations. A re-examination of pre- historic skeletal remains from established archaeological sequences is needed to determine whether there have been any marked changes in physical characteris- tics which might be associated with popu- lation movements and with the expansion of new and more successful population groups at the expense of older ones. (6) Ethnographers should be trained to specialize in those aspects of culture which are relevant to the archaeological and historical understanding of the African past: e.g. distribution studies, studies of patterns of settlement and of trade, the manufacture and use of arti- facts, attitudes towards these and their nomenclature, and the technology of iron. (7) The most definitive evidence con- cerning the origin and evolution of culti- vated plants may be expected from the field ofarchaeology. Critical botanical evidence is frequently ignored or of little use for lack of efficient means of positive identifi- cation. The field of "archaeobotany" is a much neglected discipline, deficient in professional personnel and specialized techniques. An archaeobotanical labora- tory is urgently needed to provide service to archaeologists in identification of plant remains and interpretation of the evi- dence. The laboratory should also develop new techniques and serve as a training centre for archaeobotanists. Vol. 9 * No. 5 December 1968</page></plain_text>
