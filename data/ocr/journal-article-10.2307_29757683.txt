<plain_text><page sequence="1">Archaeology and Settlement History in a Test Area of the Swat Valley Preliminary Report on the AMSV Project (1st Phase) by Luca M. Olivieri and Massimo Vidale with contributions by Abdul Nasir Khan, Tahir Saeed, Luca Colliva, rlccardo garbini, leonardo langella, Roberto Micheli and Emanuele Morigi Above [the ruins] rise boldly eroded cliffs of red sandstone looking like frowning walls. The contrast offered by this wild solitude, a small Thebais, to the smiling green fields below was strangely impressive in the light of the evening. M.A. Stein, An Archaeological Tour in Upper Swat and Adjacent Rill Tracts, Calcutta 1930, p. 14. Introduction It was on the valleys S of Bir-kot-ghwandai that Giuseppe Tucci made his seminal, fundamental observations on the ancient history and archaeology of Swat (1958). It is with a feeling of pride and satisfaction that our Mission returns on its own tracks, also because this happens - and we envisage this as a particularly appropriate coincidence - on the celebration of our 50th year of continuous field activity. We present the first part of the preliminary report of the Archaeological Map of the Swat valley (AMSV) project, led by Luca M. Oliveri (LMO) and Massimo Vidale (MV) in the framework of the IsIAO Archeological Mission (IAM) activities directed by P. Callieri. This preliminary report has the goal to present all data so far collected during our 2000 2005 survey campaigns, concerning an area of about 100 km2. In fact, the aim of the 2000-2005 campaigns was to accomplish the surface exploration and mapping of a first, meaningful sample area of the AMSV project. For this purpose, we had selected the valleys immediately facing the Bir-kot ghwandai area to the east and south-east, thoroughly - if not systematically - * The present research has been edited on a fifty-fifty basis by these two Authors. All the photographs are property of IsIAO. [1] 73</page><page sequence="2">explored by the Mission over the past 20 years (see Olivieri 2003a for bibliography). The project started in the year 2000 with the reconnaissance of the Kandak and right Lower Kotah valleys, followed in 2004 by the exploration of the Upper Kandak, Middle Kotah and Najigram valleys. Finally, in 2005 (and 2006) the Upper Kotah and Karakar valleys were surveyed. The exploration did not include the Mt Ham area (already surveyed by G. Stacul and LMO in the past), which is geographically part of the Saidu valley area. In addition we carried out limited exploration tests in other areas as well, namely in Zalam-kot. The survey of the Zalam-kot valley led us to the discovery of a possible Shahi religious building. The results of the research are summarized in the enclosed Sites List (x). In the List the topographical setting is indicated according to the different valleys surveyed, namely the Kandak, Najigram, Karakar and Kotah valleys (somewhere abbreviated respectively as KK, NG, KR, KH) (Fig. 1) as well as other valleys, where we conducted preliminary research (Saidu=SA, Zalam-kot=ZK). The Sites List subdivides the locations into specific types (Pre-Protohistoric sites: graveyards, settlements; Rock-art/artifact sites: painted shelters, carvings, cup-marks, tanks and wine-presses, axe-sharpeners and others; Historic sites: Buddhist sites, settlements; Late Historic [and Early Islamic] sites: religious buildings, fortifications, settlements). Chronology, at this preliminary stage, is indicated only roughly, farming each site in wide cultural horizons inferred by ceramics found on surface and other kinds of macroscopic evidence (2). Each site has an individual inventory number (numbers are not necessarily serial and many have not been assigned or cancelled). Each site is indicated by its name: the transcription of toponyms follows the rules indicated in Olivieri &amp; Vidale 2004: n. 8. When they exist, references to published information are also reported. To each Site, if not published elsewhere and/or if the evidence was deemed sufficient, a short description is attached. The List is illustrated by selected photographs and by distribution maps for each type of site and/or cultural horizon. The second part of the report will discuss some issues that emerged from the preliminary study of our data, but will also present some finds (so far unpublished (*) The already published data are simply referenced. (2) Note that some Periods of the Swat Cultural Sequence (SCS, aka 'Ghalegay Sequence') have been here defined as following: Period IV=Bronze Age (1700-1400 B.C.); Per. V-VI=Late Bronze Age (1400-600 B.C.); VII=Early Iron Age (600-400 B.C.); Per. VIII-BKG Early Periods-Early Historic (3rd -1st B.C.); lst-6th A.D.=Historic (subdivided in 'Historic' l=Saka-Parthian, 2=Kushan, 3=Kushano Sasanian in Tables 1 and 2); 7th-llth A.D =Late Historic; 12th-15th A.D.=Early Islamic. The first digit indicates the survey year (0=ante 2000, 1=2000, 2=2004, 3=2005 4=2006); this is followed by the individual number of the site (e.g.: 1121=Site 121 documented in 2000) and, eventually by a subscript letter if the site revealed different chronologies. In the Sites List measurements are given in m.cm (0.00); the following abbreviations have been used: l=length, w=width, d=diameter, h=height, dp=depth, m=meters, m2=square meters, ha=hectars, qt=100 kg, hl=hectoliters. 74 [2]</page><page sequence="3">Fig. 1 - The AMSV study area (all the maps are processed by EM). and, we think, important) from the Jambil valley. The surveying of the latter (together with Saidu and Ugad valleys) will be the subject of the second phase of activity of AMSV (3). General information on the AMSV Project, data regarding the previous campaigns, geographical and geological features of the sample area, and the reappraisal of the previously available data, are available in recently published reports (Vidale &amp; Olivieri 2002; Olivieri 2003a; Olivieri &amp; Vidale 2004; Laurenza &amp; Vidale 2005; Filigenzi, forthcoming f). (3) Some of the issues here presented (those dealing with the prehistoric artefacts and rock-art) had already been briefly anticipated in two papers presented at the last South Asian Archaeology Conference, London, July 2005 (Micheli &amp; Vidale, forthcoming; Olivieri, forthcoming b). [3] 75</page><page sequence="4">The 2005 AMSV Campaign The 2005 campaign was carried out from July 27 to September 4. The 2005 survey was carried out with the contribution of other specialists: Luca Colliva (LC), Roberto Micheli (RM), Emanuele Morigi (EM), Piero Spagnesi (all permanent members of the IAM in Pakistan) and in close collaboration with the Department of Archaeology and Museums, Gov.t of Pakistan, directed by Fazal Dad Kakar. Abdul Nasir Khan (ANK), Curator of the Reserve Collection, Swat Museum, Saidu Sharif, was appointed by the Department as his representative; he also directed the survey in the Zalam-kot Valley (4). The success of this research is also due to the invaluable help of our head worker and restorer, Akhtar Manir. During the first three weeks many new sites were found in the Karakar area. They are mainly Buddhist sites belonging to the late-historic period. Amongst them it is important to recall the large site of Kanderai 1, to be considered the largest monastic settlement of the entire project area (Spagnesi, this issue). A complete photographic survey of the monastic buildings overlooking the sacred areas of Abbasaheb-china 1-2 and Tokar-dara 1-2 was also performed. The other three weeks were devoted to the control in the field of the information previously gathered in Kandak and to the exploration of the Upper Kotah valley. New sites were documented in the Middle Kandak, as well as in the Kotah valley, where also new painted shelters were discovered. New information confirmed the importance of the area for the knowledge of the painted rock-art of the Swat Valley and its evolution. These shelters, like the other previously published, namely Sargah-sar 1, Kakai-kandao 1, Dwolasmane-patai 1 (Vidale &amp; Olivieri 2002) and the Kafir-kot group (Abdul Nasir et al. 1995), are painted in red ochre. The shelters span a wide chronological range, as may be inferred from the subjects of the different paintings. We believe that the rock paintings may range from the Bronze Age to the Early Iron Age, as well as to Historic and Late-historic phases. The earliest paintings are distinguished by a particularly complex repertory of designs, including possible deities arising from ibexes and tigers or holding sun-like radiating wheels. No depiction of domestic animals, st?pa designs or images of metal weapons are represented in these paintings. A stone slab at the shelter of Muhammad-patai 1, in the Kotah valley, among various designs, shows a scene of a horse sacrifice comparable to the designs found by G. Stacul on a few potsherds from Bronze Age layers of Bir-kot-ghwandai, and therefore provided a new chronological clue of primary importance. Early Iron Age (4) He was also representative for the Department in 2000, while Tahir Saeed (TS) represented it in the 2004 Campaign. Leonardo Langella (LL) draughtman and archaeologist took part in the 2004 Campaign. 76 [4]</page><page sequence="5">paintings, in contrast, include designs of domesticated animals such as, in the first place, humped bulls and metal battle axes, two 'classic' motives of later rock-art repertories in other regions of the Indo-Pakistani subcontinent. A monumental Brahmi-Sarada rock inscription in several lines was discovered near Talang. The inscription is sheltered below a large projecting boulder and partially covers earlier carvings. Traces of red paintings with superimposed carvings, as well as large 'permutations' of cup-marks (in the sense of Olivieri &amp; Vidale 2004), are also visible at this spot. The campaign scheduled for Summer-Fall 2006 has been entirely devoted to finalizing the survey of the left Lower Kotah valley, as well as to the study of the stratigraphic sequence on a specific key site, Talang (where the rock carvings may still be partially covered by archaeological deposits) (see the Postscript above). In the same campaign, we also started the survey of the Saidu valley (together with the Mt Ham area), the Jambil valley, and Puran. All these areas are included, together with the Ugad valley, in the second future phase of the project (2007-2010).

One of the wine-presses still has its original walls, made of heavy rectangular stone slabs. Bang-khas 1 (Site 359a) Wine-presses; tanks. On the sub-horizontal upper surfaces of a gigantic boulder (1 10.50; w 5.40), at a height of about 2 m, there is 1 wine-press and a tank, both partially covered by soil. The press (12.20; 92 [20]</page><page sequence="21">w 1.60) has outer walls still in their original setting, made by single, thick rectangular stone slabs (w 0.15); the inner excavated cavity, therefore, is smaller (1.90; w 1.35). From the tank a flow hole leads off and ends in a lower, smaller basin. Another tank beside the one just described, partially buried by earth, may have been similar in size and features. All along the edge of the boulder runs a continuous groove that originally supported a row of other stone slabs. Cup-marks are visible on top of the same boulder, as well as along the exterior wall. At the foot of the boulder there is a round press. Bang-khas3 (Site 378a) Wine-presses. Here we observed 4 wine-presses, one of which of the 'palette' type.

The latter, on the back wall, are themselves covered by 5 lines relating an inscriptions in Brahmi-Sarada script dating to 8th-12th A.D. from the paleographic point of view (Fig. 86). (LMO, MV&amp;TS) Saidu Valley Madeslam (Site 389) (Fig. 42) Wine-presses. Two large tanks are carved into a big gneiss boulder. The first of these, on the left, consists of a large rectangular tank with a gently sloping bottom, ending in an overflow canal leading to a large basin (d 0.60). A small incised canal also terminates in the basin. The second, on the left, consists of two linked basins situated at different levels. The upper basin is roughly square in shape (1 0.80), and the lower one circular (d 0.43). Above the first basin a large horizontal recess is situated (1 0.40). This second artefact has been interpreted as a wine press: the press may have been connected by means of a rod pivoting on the recess and moved by hand at the other end. The press linked to the first basin allowed the pressing of juice into the lower basin. In the vicinity other rock artefacts of difficult interpretation have been found. Ghirai (Site 390) (Figs. 43-44) Wine-presses, cup-marks. The site presents different artefacts to the right and left of an irrigated meadow in which the water from a spring is collected. The main one is a large gneiss boulder (1 9.00), on which numerous cup-marks have been incised. On one sloping side two basins joined at different levels lie.

This is perhaps the largest Buddhist site in the whole valley. Dominating the course of the Kandak, the complex covers two main st?pa terraces and other smaller ones, sloping down the hill. For a description of the complex as it appeared during the first third of last century see the references indicated above. Today the remains of the complex, after the damage caused by decades of illegal digging, may still be identified. It covers the side of the ridge, occupying an area of about 8,000 m2. The lower terrace (S) is supported by a substruction wall, some 40.00 m has been conserved (max. h 6.00). To the SW lie monastic dwelling structures of the type found at both Tokar-dara 2 and Abbasaheb-china 2.

The best conserved complex in the whole of Kandak. With its characteristic splendid vih?ra still standing, it must have been more deeply appreciated at the time of Stein. The double artificial terrace on which the sacred areas stood must have been appreciated even more. The upper one is still visible today and, in addition to the vih?ra, houses also the remains of three st?pa, two of which are large (d about 10.00). Traces of closed chambers may be identified in the corners of the outer walls. Here, more than elsewhere, a substantial presence of pottery has been recorded and sampled. The pottery was probably due to the presence of two dwelling units to the S and W of the complex, each about 3,000 m2 in area.

The site is located at the end of the Zalam-kot Valley, in the Allahdand-dherai area (Malakand Agency), in a zone lying outside that included in the AMSV work. Its vicinity to the W border of the AMSV, as well as its historical importance (see Abdur Rahman 1998), justifies treating it herein. The area S of Allahdand-dherai splits into two valleys - to the E that of Loryan-tangai, which ends in the not Periano-kandao (very far from the Cherat-kandao); to the W the actual valley of Zalam-kot, which ends in the Shahkot-kandao. From here it is easy to walk to Palai, and Dargai along two ancient roads that are still accessible today. The site, [47] 119</page><page sequence="48">uphill from the village of the same name, is characterized by a powerful defensive line, large sections of which are still visible. This closes the valley and then climbs up to the ridge, taking in the Shahkot-kandao, which becomes an integral part of them, together with its ancient road itinerary. Halfway up the hill a huge substruction wall running E-W has been found, with a curtain of large isodomic blocks (max. w 20.00; max. h 3.50). On this substruction stands a moulded podium with the same orientation (1 21.10; w 13.00; max. h 3.80). The platform is punctuated by pilaster strips 1.35 m apart; the latter are decorated with slender columns with reverse trapezoidal capitals of a non Gandhara type. The decoration, masonry technique and layout exclude the likelihood of its being a Buddhist building. On the other hand, the orientation and indeed the decorative and moulding typology suggest the features of the Shahi temple of Bir-kot-ghwandai (see Callieri et al. 2000, 2000-2001). (ANK) Implications of Rock-Art Studies for a History of Human Settlement in Swat Introduction One of the most important discoveries made by Giuseppe Tucci in 1955 in Swat was that of the carved wall at Gogdara I (Tucci 1958; Brentjes 1977; Olivieri 1998). Standing sheer over the road, it displayed only a few carvings, which nevertheless increased as a result of the excavation of the deposits covering its base. Unfortunately, for some reason, the dig gave no useful indications concerning the dating of the carvings (Olivieri 1998: 59). The wall is covered by over one hundred figures, the majority of which deeply incised, others merely scratched on the surface. The carvings were carried out using metal points; the rock face was then cut by quarrying operations typical in this area during the golden age of the great Buddhist monastic foundations (Di Florio et al. 1993). These two elements allow the carvings to be dated to between the Bronze Age and the beginning of the Historic Age (16th 4th B.C.). Retouches and overlaps point to two large carving phases: one comprising large wild animal figures (all facing right), the other one with the depiction of carts, herds of horses, standards (all facing left); the human figure is absent (the contrary of what Tucci wrote in the legend to fig. 2 in On Swat in 1977). The two phases are stylistically different: large animal figures are often bi-triangular, while later images, as a rule, are linear and schematic. For a long time Gogdara I was considered an isolated case in Swat, an early example of a tradition that reached its peak only with the rock art of the later Buddhist monuments, in late antiquity. After a decade of new, intensive research, Gogdara I, although still representing a key site for protohistoric archaeology, is 120 [48]</page><page sequence="49">obviously part of a much wider and richer heritage. In the following pages we shall try to place the rock art of Swat in a wider archaeological reconstruction, centered on the fluctuating relationships between human societies and their territories. Urban Growth and Land Use at Bir-kot-ghwandai The most important archaeological feature is without doubt the large settlement of Bir-kot-ghwandai (hereafter BKG), which was continuously occupied from the Bronze Age to the Early Iron Age, after the excavations of G. Stacul (for references see Olivieri 2003a), and the trenches exposing the layers below the Indo-Greek city, both in the lower town (Callieri et al. 1992) and in the hilltop or acropolis (Callieri et al. 2000; see also Olivieri 2003 a). The settlement seems to have covered a total area of 5 ha (without the acropolis). Stacul found a Bronze Age settlement with semi-subterranean dwellings (or dwelling-pits: perhaps huts and/or storage facilities). In the latest Bronze Age phases, huts were built above the ground with walls of mud and pebbles. The material culture includes a highly refined painted ware, previously unknown in the contemporary sites of Swat, clearly belonging, from a stylistic point of view, to the 'Cemetery H' culture of the Localization Era of the Indus tradition (according to the M. Kenoyer's definition), c. 1700-1300 B.C. Both at BKG and in other sites of the valley, these Bronze Age settlements based their subsistence upon sedentarian agricultural practices. Thus they clustered near the available cultivable lands, usually at the confluence of river courses, as in the cases of BKG or the Mingora area (sites of Aligrama, Loebanr 3 and Kalako-dheri) (Stacul 1987; contra Coningham &amp; Sutherland 1997-98). In front of BKG there are about 250 ha of naturally irrigated floodplains, consisting of fertile fine silt and clay beds. This surface appears to have been free from settlements or other constructions (with the possible exception of the small graveyard of Shaga-malkidam 3). On the outer bounds of this area, again in the hillsides or mountain sides, we found 3 major contemporaneous settlement areas or large villages: Abwa 1-2 (in the Swat valley), Gumbat and Jowar-bandai 2 (in the upper Kandak valley). At BKG the most common crop was rice, which was easy to grow on these easily irrigable lands, followed by wheat and barley (data from Costantini 1987). The flowrate of the Swat was without doubt greater than it is today, also in view of the existence of a much larger niveo-glacial basin at the time; and perhaps the bed of the river was much wider than it is now (as also suggested by the find of thick alluvial layers in the Ghalegay shelter, see Stacul 1987. The minimum Pleistocene glacial, according to A. Desio, was identified at an absolute height of 1,400-1,500 m asl, while the present-day ELA lies over 4000 m asl; cit. in ibid.: 5). The BKG natural hill perhaps appeared as a peninsula extending towards the N and NE into the Swat river bed. Although the rice fields in the present bed of the [49] 121</page><page sequence="50">Swat are a recent result of a major hydrographic shift, the water table in ancient times was definitely higher. There is little doubt that the land south of BKG, along the Karakar and Kandak rivers, represented the most favourable land for cultivating rice. The BKG Bronze Age settlement relied heavily on the humped bull {Bos indicus), more than in any other contemporary village of Swat, while sheep grazing came a clear second (not only in absolute terms, but also when compared, for example, to Loebanr 3) (data from Compagnoni 1987). The following settlement at BKG is quite different: it had rectangular houses with mudbrick walls built above partially subterranean stone foundations. In this settlement 2 chronological horizons were identified: a Late Bronze Age and an Early Iron Age occupation (Stacul 1987: 63). Painted ceramics were replaced by a black and grey burnished ware, sometimes decorated with comb-like patterns, spike and chevron designs. Between this settlement and the later fortified city there is a little settlement gap, as demonstrated by the mud brick debris found in the fillings of the foundations of the Indo-Greek boundary wall (3rd-2nd B.C.). In this time-span the best agricultural land in front of BKG was slowly covered by a huge graveyard, doubtless the largest in the whole Swat valley. Initially identified at several individual sites (from Bir-kot-ghwandai 2 to Thasildar[sep] kabiruna and Goratai-kandao 1, up to Shaga-malkidam 1), this burial ground was finally recognized as a single cemetery extending for more than 1 km2, thus occupying about 1/3 of the best available ploughing surfaces. This huge graveyard may well have contained 30,000-60,000 individuals buried over a millennium. This evolution in the land-use pattern, in the late Iron Age, doubtless had a considerable impact on local economies. Minor protohistoric burial grounds were found in more remote locations: Uech-tangai in Karakar, Kandak, Jowar-bandai 1, Miage 2 and others in the Kandak valley, Kamal-china 4, Rahmanuddin house, Bang-khas 1, in Kotah. Although Gwel[angaso]-dherai seems to have been the only other major protohistoric settlement in Kandak, the frequency of small cemeteries hosting 10-50 graves suggests a widespread occupation of the general area by localized family groups. The Kandak valley was the most intensely occupied area, followed by the Upper Kotah Valley. In the Karakar and Najigram valleys, there is only one known protohistoric site, while the latter valleys were densely settled in the Historic periods. In protohistoric times, the Karakar might have been used and controlled in a quite different way. According to the historical sources, the Karakar pass was already open during the second half of the 1st millennium B.C. and this might have been one of the reasons for the increasing prosperity of BKG (Olivieri 1996b). A scarcity of ancient settlements would indicate that roads and the pass were managed indirectly, as they might have represented a potential danger, rather than a source of wealth. This may be considered evidence of a state of marginalization, particularly when it is compared with the previous settlement patterns of the Bronze Age (as originally perceived in Tusa 1979). 122 [50]</page><page sequence="51">This inference might be biased by the flimsy nature of the archaeological evidence, particularly if we accept with R. Young (2003, 2005) that the core of the economy depended upon sheep grazing and transhumance and on seasonal strategies of subsistence farming (Id. 2003: 81). In the second half of the 2nd millennium B.C. there is clear evidence of a sudden change (see also Stacul 2001). A loss of interest in farmland and a shift towards building and maintaining large and rapidly expanding burial grounds can hardly be questioned. This might have promoted an important inversion in the economy of our valleys and of Swat in general. While agriculture (apparently in progress, again, in the Early Iron Age, thanks also to important innovations such as the introduction of large saddle querns: see Id. 1995) was not abandoned, crops and diets may have been transformed. The overall contribution of cereals to subsistence decreased, and, in husbandry, feeding on straw, hay and cereals might have been partially replaced by the exploitation of mountain meadows. This is also the opinion of K. Jettmar when he examines the passage from Arrianus (Anabasis IV 25, 4) that mentions the confiscation of 240,000 oxen or bulls by Alexander from the tribes inhabiting the NW borders of Swat (Jettmar 1995): They were of such a superb quality that he ordered to bring a selection back to Macedonia, for ploughing. Evidently the dominant tribes of the region were experienced cattlebreeders. As a pre-condition for the maintenance of large herds of superior quality, we may assume a system of transhumance. {Ibid.: 36). Little is known about this important change, nor whether it was fast or slow. At BKG, [...] a thick, alluvial, almost barren deposit [...] separates the occupation of Period IV [...] from the layers of Period V [...]. Here, in this clayey deposit, some human skulls and a few other disconnected skeletal remains, were recovered, scattered over a large area without traces of graves [...]. (Stacul 1987: 63). Painted Shelters and Their Possible Implications More information on the dynamics of settlement, intrusion and marginalization, comes from the rock art in Kandak and Kotah. Such artistic or graphic (and, at least in part, ritual) tradition has been attested since the Bronze Age and survived the transformations brought about by Buddhism, declining only in the later historical phases. The shelters are usually large gneiss boulders metamorphosed and eroded by glacier action located in rugged and hard to access places, but clearly visible at a great distance. The interior, or protected space, may barely have been sufficient to shelter more than 1-3 persons at the same time. The figures are painted in dark red ochre, the more recent in orange ochre, and more rarely in yellow or white. The paintings deemed to be the most ancient, those of Sargah-sar 1 (Figs. [51] 123</page><page sequence="52">16-17) and Kakai-kandao (Fig. 15), display highly symbolic compositions, the syntax of which is based on associations, oppositions and combinations of iconographic themes. The elaborate structure suggests co-literate cultural contexts, that is, typical of illiterate cultures that nevertheless possess a complex mythopoeietic and lexical heritage (Vidale &amp; Olivieri 2002; Olivieri 2005, and forthcoming b; Olivieri &amp; Vidale 2004; Laurenza &amp; Vidale 2005). While the fundamental theme of the early phase of Gogdara I is the wild animal icon, the ibex and the leopard, two sacred animals in the traditional cultures of the Hindukush and the Karakorum, the dominant theme at Sargah-sar 1 and Kakai-kandao 1 seems to be agriculture. The following is doubtless highly speculative - an almost inevitable condition for any rock art study - although we willingly pay this price in the hope of combining this fascinating evidence in a unitary reconstruction of the history of the ancient population of Swat. At Sargah-sar 1 we have actually hypothesized scenes of ploughing, sowing and consecration of the field entrusted to three types of actors. Men and women, perhaps equipped with farm implements, have the task of ploughing; other men, who seem to occupy a hierarchically higher position have the task of sowing (they have typical upside down U-shaped legs), a large anthropomorph, with the same characteristics as the sowers is lastly depicted inside a large ploughed and sown field, of which the same symbol is part, as in a drawing by Escher. In our attempt to relate these scenes back to a Vedic (or Rgvedic) ideological background, we cited the preclusion of priests from ploughing, who with their tools (all the worse if made of metal) would have injured the virginity of the field (see also Manu X 84, ff.). The priests have the task of sowing, in the name of the god of the fields, which was reborn from them through the ritual act. The presence of animals in the painted shelters is limited in Kakai-kandao to a monkey depicted in the act of defecating on a sown field: in a Rgvedic environment this animal could be a reference to the goddess-symbol of the autumn equinox (ref. in Vidale &amp; Olivieri 2002, and Olivieri &amp; Vidale 2004). At Sargah-sar 1, a marginal sector of the painted sector is dominated by a heroic scene. An individual with U-shaped legs armed with a shining shield intervenes between an ibex surmounted by an anthropomorph and a large feline that is attacking it. Here we again see, although expressed through a syntactic language, an association between the themes of the leopard and the ibex, which is dominant in phase one of Gogdara I, where an ibex surmounted by an anthropomorph is perhaps depicted. This icon doubtless corresponds to the hypostasis of one of the many devi of the mountain, known throughout the Karakorum-Himalaya area until recent times sub specie Durgae, called Murkhum by the peoples of Kafiristan. This reference to hunting (interpreted in its metaphysical or ritual meaning) is linked to the marginal, although not absent, role played by this activity in the osteological evidence yielded by the excavations (Compagnoni 1987). 124 [52]</page><page sequence="53">At Sargah-sar 1 and Kakai-kandao the principal compositions are surrounded by secondary figures: archers aiming arrows rigorously to the right of the onlooker, dancers or figures with theriomorphic modifications or open hands extending outwards. Also in the Bronze Age painted pottery of BKG (inv. no. BKG 302; Stacul 1987: fig. 41 .k), as in that of Cemetery H at Harappa (or, for the sake of example, in the painted pottery of the 2nd millennium B.C. of Maharashtra) such depictions exist. The theme has often been associated with a state of shamanic trance or ritual death (ref. in Vidale &amp; Olivieri 2002: nn. 23-24). These observations probably bring us nearer to the meaning of these shelters, inside which a man often has difficulty even in remaining seated. Clearly the art of the earlier painted shelters was not created simply to be observed: it could be linked to long periods of isolation and deprivation and associated with forms of initiation ritual. New Evidence from Muhammad-patai 1 In the carved frieze of Muhammad-patai 1 the mythopoietic components of protohistoric Swat are enhanced with new revelations. The shelter is decorated with two principal compositions: a frieze on the front of the jutting boulder forming the roof (Fig. 19); a second composition in several different registers overlapping on the inside, at the rear wall of the shelter (Fig. 20). While the latter presents stylistic and lexical characteristics typical of the later phases (linear or comb-like zoomorphic figures; see Olivieri &amp; Vidale 2004: 172), on the left, the former displays a complex quadruple scene. Starting from the left we recognize a warrior figure raising a large shield in his right hand and a weapon (?) in his left; the figure of an archer facing at least one zoomorphic image; two large animals - a feline and a caprid in evident opposition, each surmounted by an anthropomorphic figure linked to the back of the animal Vehicles' by vertical lines or rods; an anthropomorph (the head of which has unfortunately been lost) supporting a feline or a bird of prey pushing towards an equid (?) with lowered neck, and with the rear hoofs clearly bound to a pole. The latter scene, almost certainly of a sacrificial nature, is strongly reminiscent of few painted fragments, in particular a Bronze Age one, from BKG (inv. no. BKG 500; Stacul 1987: fig. 46.h). G. Stacul has in several instances emphasized the archaic stylistic reference of many of the depictions on this quality pottery, above all which scenes of 'ritual aggression' between animals and representations of equids are illustrated (ibid.: 109; Id. 2005). Although without going into the matter in detail, Stacul was doubtless thinking of the horse sacrifices that were so important in the Indian representation of regality (even though the role of the animal of prey remained undefined). Further to the right, a part of this carving evidently fell off in ancient times, now revealing fracture surfaces with a different patina. The latter were used to make new carvings with different subjects and in different styles. [53] 125</page><page sequence="54">An Iron Age Celebratory Carving at Sargah-sar and Other Cases The painted shelter of Sargah-sar 1 was used also in a later era. Both here and at Kakai-kandao 1 and Muhammad-patai 1, there are actually various cup-marks that, as we will see, are a phenomenon that can definitely be dated to the Iron Age and later. Furthermore, several complex scenes scratched on the base of the niche rigorously respect the space occupied by the paintings, which were perhaps perceived as sacred or in any case prestigious (Fig. 18). At the centre of the Sargah-sar 2 surface a large figure of a horseman armed with a large bow and perhaps carrying a rectangular shield decorated with 'eyes'. Beneath the anterior hoofs of the horse lies an anthropomorphic figure, perhaps headless. A large arrow is nocked to the bowstring and its triangular head transfixes an enemy prisoner. To the immediate right lies another enemy, either fallen or taken prisoner (in both cases the state of being a prisoner is apparently indicated by the arms closed in the form of an arc on the sides, as though the wrists were bound behind the back). On a scale and in contexts that are completely different the impression is that of observing a prehistoric antecedent of the great Iranian celebratory reliefs of late antiquity, as it were. On the right of the horseman there are other figures: a dismounted archer aiming at the head of a caprid, holding it by the hoofs, in order to represent possession or capture. On the left, there are other animals and vaguely anthropomorphic figures with a 'mushroom' shape, two of which presenting some similarity with the well-known 'anthropomorphs' of the so-called Gangetic copper hoards. The theme of the hero carrying a shield associated with the ibex and the large feline is a recurrent one in rock art after the Bronze Age: for example, on the carved boulder of Lekha-gata 2 and in the painted shelter of Dandi-sar 1. The Lekha-gata 2 boulder (Olivieri &amp; Vidale 2004: fig. 41), as well as the (heroic?) human figure, also displays a large number of compositions executed by means of dot marks, forming wheels. Astronomically oriented wheels and crossed wheels are common in these lesser valleys of the Swat, as also in Bajaur and the upper course of the Indus, where they were recorded by the archaeologists of the German projects. 'Permutations' of larger dot-marks (or cup-marks) are very commonly found in the form of cup marked boulders. The widespread presence of cup-marks is a truly extraordinary phenomenon in Swat, in particular in the Kandak valley. Furthermore, all the painted shelters and carved walls are literally surrounded by cup-marks. They are found around the sites, at the top and bottom of the shelters (this may support the idea that cup-marks were meant for rituals, for example for holding liquids). The earliest datable cup-marks are those carved out of the roof slab of several Iron Age graves, in the Jowar-bandai 1 graveyard (in the Kandak valley) and in that of Kamal china 4 (in the Kotah valley). This does not rule out the possibility that many may be even older (for a reappraisal of all the aspects related to the phenomenon of cup marks in Swat, see ibid., and Olivieri 2005; as far as the compositive or sub-figurative 126 [54]</page><page sequence="55">values is concerned, together with the case of the megalithic monument of Kandak ford, see Olivieri &amp; Vidale 2006b). The painted shelters of Dandi-sar 1 (Fig. 24) and Kamal-china 1 (Fig. 22) are the expression of a progressive lexical transformation, tending towards a repetitive simplicity i.e. symbolism, as the result of an actual cultural change. The process of change might have been strictly local and autonomous, or, conversely, due to a foreign influence: we are unfamiliar with. At Dandi-sar 1, motives already observed in older painted shelters, such as body transformations (lid. 2002: n. 23) or radiating shields/wheels are rendered with a new emphasis. A minor figure, on the upper left, shows a body transformation, while the whole scene is dominated by a big anthropomorphic image holding a shield, whose head is surmounted by a radiating disc or solar symbol. Similar icons (anthropomorphs with round shields) are repeated twice in the midst of other designs more difficult to interpret. At Kamal-china 1 the painted shelter affords us a different relationship between space and the figures: the latter are bundled together, practically filling every bare space, in a kind of horror vacui, which is not found in the lucid syntactic composition of the earlier shelters. At Kamal-china 1 the almost obsessively repeated icons are dominant. In the centre of the wall at least 5 hands stand out, arranged in the centre in the same line and emphasized by an anthropomorphic image displaying a huge hand as though it were the hypostasis. All around, in a cyclic pattern, figures of horsemen, anthropomorphs on horseback (with bodily modifications), humped bulls, banners and battle-axes are arranged. Below, there is a horseman with a small fringed shield and an ithyphallic anthropomorph which is raising a humped bull by the hoofs, a motif observed also at Dandi-sar 1. The site of Kamal-china 1 is one of the most interesting of the entire Kotah valley: it is surrounded by two Iron Age graveyards and three sites with cup-marks and wheels (Kamal-china 3-5). While in the older painted shelters the horse is absent and agriculture is possibly emphasized, in the later examples warriors are constantly associated with horse riding. The horse icon was possibly the totem of the Assakenoi-?skakay?na, or at least their eponymous animal (Tucci 1977: 45-46): these are the peoples that Alexander encountered in Swat at the end of the 4th B.C. It is certain that the horse was present in the decoration of the precious Bronze Age pottery at BKG (Stacul 2005b); as an icon it was however found first at Gogdara I and Sargah-sar 1, at least in the latter phases of these sites. In both cases, the later carvings respect the ancient monument and make do with residual and marginal spaces. The 'horse' is then definitely found in the iconographic and osteological panorama of the graveyards (ref. in Olivieri 1998: 69). It is then certain that the entire iconographic patrimony of the poit-Bronze Age is based on manly and warlike themes. The impression is that highly hierarchized pastoral societies were formed, perhaps the same as those described in critical terms, for example, in Manu X 41 55 (see Id. 2004). These groups may have wasted large portions of farmland to [55] 127</page><page sequence="56">maintain large graveyards in which the memory of their ancestors is conserved.

At Lekha_gata 2 (Fig. 77), we find depictions of armed horsemen, side by side with the simplified representation of a carriage drawn by a pair of horses (the same type as Gogdara I) and a large bi triangular animal. In the shelter of Kamal-china 1, which may perhaps be dated by its Iron Age graveyard, everything speaks to us of a herder-horseman culture gathered around often repeated symbols: the battle-axes, the right hand, the banners, the ownership of herds. This act, as we have seen, is represented by means of the scene of a man holding the animal's hocks, both at Kamal-china 1 and Sargah-sar 2. Lastly, the style is that of typically linear later protohistoric rock art; on the other hand, the syntax is impoverished to the advantage of a composition rendered complex by the redundancy of a small number of themes. This complex of symbols might be hypothetically interpreted, at an elementary level, in the following way: hands = authority, possession; horse and riders = rank; humped bulls = material wealth; battle axes = warfare and conquest. We suggest that similar symbols are closely related to the rise of a sharply stratified society where the highest ranks fought not only for land and prestige but for cattle as well. This is the end of a long evolution running from the 2nd millennium B.C. until the end of the 1st millennium A.D., but not of the rock art of Swat. In summary, we are dealing with an early phase datable to the Bronze Age (before 1400 B.C.), when paintings possibly represented agricultural rituals and wild animals, perhaps depicting specific divinities; in this phase the hero appeared for the first time, holding a shield. In the long transition phase towards the Iron Age (1400-400 B.C.), with the well-known extensive graveyards, warrior and pastoral figures predominate, but above all the depiction of the horse. In the phase of contact with the Buddhist cultural domination (100 B.C.-400 A.D.), we witness the expressions of a contrast with the new ideology, accompanied by symbols, which proudly underline the difference of the local tradition (Table 2). A continuous and recurrent phenomenon throughout this time span is, as we have seen, that of the cup-marked boulders. (LMO &amp; MV) 128 [56]</page><page sequence="57">Settlement Patterns in the Early Historic and Historic Periods Introduction Analysis of the distribution of the Buddhist sites suggests that the majority of the sites identified are situated inside the area of confluence of the three largest valleys (Kandak, Najigram e Karakar) in the area immediately S of the built-up area of BKG. They are located half way up or at the top of hills in a dominant position. Although our observations were based upon unexcavated ruins, usually badly damaged by plundering activities, these sites are formed by large monastic complexes, the size of which is much greater than that of the relative sacred areas. In monumental or larger sites monastic structures with courtyard seem less common. They seem mainly to consist of complexes of isolated buildings with similar characteristics (structures with a rectangular layout with towers and external masonry staircase). Small courtyards have been found at Tokar-dara 1-2, Masum shahid and Abbasaheb-china 1-2; they may be hypothesized at Gumbat 1, Kanjar kote 1, Goratai and Najigram, where however isolated buildings are absent. The monastic types that are extensively documented in the Mingora area, especially at Saidu Sharif I, thus seem to be less frequent: contiguous courtyard and sacred area within well defined limits (Callieri 1989; on the differences between sites in the Mingora area and that of the BKG area, see Faccenna, forthcoming a). At Najigram no dwelling structures have been found outside the monumental terraces. Kanderai 1 (Fig. 52) may possibly have been the centre of a huge monastic settlement on which several sacred areas depended: namely, Najigram, Naitmara 1 and Nawagai. In this sense, the site or site cluster of Kanderai 1 could even turn out to be the largest monastic complex of the entire Swat. It is situated in a position of strong dominance, visually dominating many other important sites: Abbasaheb-china 1-2, Tokar-dara 1-2, Ghadiar 4, Tok-dara, Top-dara, Amluk-dara and lastly BKG (Fig. 78). On the BKG hill there must certainly have been another important sacred area: in spite of the reconnaissance and the excavations it has not been located exactly (Olivieri 2003a; Callieri et al. 2000, 2000-2001); this is demonstrated by the frequency of Gandharic sculptures and decorated architectural elements over the entire acropolis. BKG represents the second pole of this 'strategy' of visual dominance of the territory by the Buddhist foundations. From the top of the hill the gaze reaches as far as Kanderai 1, takes in the whole of Karakar, as far as the pass of the same name, the entire Kandak as far as Gumbat 1, Amluk and China-bara; it dominates the whole of Swat from Udegram to the E as far as Chakdara to the W. Then there are lesser sites located in more marginal areas, albeit not far from the largest centres. We found, for example, a long row of sacred areas perched on the right bank of the Kandak: from Kandak-khwar 1 to Garam (the size of which is hard to assess today), as far as the hill site of Daud-banda, whose ruins appear [57] 129</page><page sequence="58">Fig. 78 - A general view over the confluence between Kandak, Najigram and Karakar rivers from above Kanderai 1. In the background the isolated crescent-shape hill of BKG is visible. (Photo by LMO, processed by LC). monumental, in spite of its limited extension. In the Najigram valley in particular (but not exclusively) on the left bank there is a series of small sacred areas which gradually thin out as one climbs the valley towards the passes leading to Kandak. In the Karakar valley the sites are spread out along the valley up as far as the pass of the same name, in practice following the ancient and important communications route (Olivieri 2003a). This seems to prove that also the monastic settlements must have had some connection with the transit route owing to the great fortune and long life of the BKG site from the Bronze Age to the Islamic period. In rare cases (e.g. at Gumbat and Kanjar-kote), and only on the hillside or at the top, the settlements overlapped protohistoric graveyard area, as was found in other areas of Swat (Olivieri &amp; Vidale 2004: n. 25; see below). The three Valleys thus display an intensive multiradial settlement type in a quantity that in general has no equal in Swat, except in the Mingora area. Also here a radial type of settlement model was constructed which radiated from the centre towards the inner valleys: from Butkara I towards the sites of Jambil and Saidu. However, these two valleys do not have accessible outlets comparable with the Karakar pass and their occupation seems more the result of a gradual reduction in the amount of space available rather than of a strategic relocation around the trade routes. The preliminary investigations envisaged for the subsequent reconnaissances for the AMSV project will confirm or disprove this interpretation. Space reduction may also be conceived of in the case of the Najigram and Kandak valleys, although not at the end of the Karakar valley, where the coincidence between the monastic settlements and the trade route is clear-cut. The same is true for the Cherat pass, with the large settlement SW of Kafir-kot 1-2, which has now disappeared. In the 130 [58]</page><page sequence="59">Karakar the correspondence may be seen also in the late-ancient age, in view of the tower-houses built almost on the pass itself. In general, in the rest of Swat, except for the more densely built up (and populated) areas (BKG, Mingora, but also Mangwlaor), the Buddhist foundations follow the course of the river, especially on the left bank while the acquisition of the tributary valleys seems to be a secondary consequence. For example, the Kotah valley narrows considerably over the last one third of its course. In the lower part, there are numerous dwelling centres, although all of a small size, situated on the sides and at the foot of the mountains, and evidently controlling a territory related to the communication route along the river. In the upper part of the valley there are isolated complexes, but also hilltop hermitages of some importance, such as Amluk and China-bara and perhaps Palwano-gata. Their construction is such remote and almost inaccessible places seems to suggest the symbolic acquisition of visual space, as well as of a meditative hermitage. If these are the elements referring to Buddhist centres and building complexes, what can be said about non-religious settlements outside the town of BKG? The only ones identified with certainty are Abwa 1, Gwel[angaso]-dheri and Garam. The first faces the Swat valley while the other two are situated on the opposite side of the Kandak area. Garam was probably a large non religious site, perhaps with smaller sacred areas on the outer edges. There is no doubt that Gwel[angaso]-dheri was non religious; it was completely destroyed in the course of farm work after our first visit. It was conceivably built in relatively early times as a station for the control of transit along the Kandak, and abandoned comparatively quickly. With this exception, the building occupation of the territory in historical times, outside BKG, seems to have been a phenomenon principally linked to the activities of the monastic centres. According to P. Callieri, with whom we have discussed this hypothesis, sacred areas, monasteries and medium sized and small rural settlements must have formed part of a polygonal model of control and management of the territory, the centre of which was BKG. This panorama is composed of many elements, which were all taken to be contemporary. In actual fact, many of them were contemporary, albeit over a period of exposure of at least 4 centuries, a period that is too long for there not to have been reconstructive distortions. Agriculture, Water Management and Land Use We may now consider the relationships between the built up space and the farmland space of BKG (similar research has recently been published by Prabha Ray 2004 and Shaw 2005). Craft activities were well developed in the city (production of metal goods and weapons), as was inter-regional trade (Taddei 2004). In other parts of Swat, other economic activities were carried on, such as [59] 131</page><page sequence="60">quarrying high quality stone for building and sculpture (always related to Buddhist commissions) (Di Florio et al. 1993) and of course pottery production; in more outlying areas sheep and goat grazing was practised as well as cattle raising (see below). However, a good deal of BKG economy was based on agriculture. This is shown, among other things, by the finds made in the city of small and large stone artefacts used for grinding cereals as well as large jars in situ in store rooms. Without counting the riversides and hillside slopes, the exploitable land in the vicinity amounts to about 500 ha. If the contribution made by agriculture to the area s economy was (obviously) essential, it is also clear that the Buddhist centres and sacred areas tended to develop beyond the boundaries of the fertile land. The monastic complexes and sacred areas actually lie on the hillsides and the higher areas, above the limit of the alluvial fans and of the arable silt and clay terraces, and corresponded to rock or conglomerate outcrops of no agricultural interest. Here the water table is at least twice as deep as the lower lands (the digging of town wells at BKG indicates that the water table lies about 6 m below the surface of the time; today the aquifer is much deeper, see Stein 1930: 17. Together with the withdrawal of the glaciers and gradual drying up of the Swat this may have caused serious damage to the ancient environment). Also the control and management of the water and irrigation must have been essential. One of the most interesting legends of Buddhist Swat is that of the naga Apal?la. In the myth (disregarding any detailed exegesis) Apal?la appears as a powerful pre-Buddhist indigenous entity. Originally kept at bay by the payment of regular contributions, the naga guaranteed control of the water. But when the collective contributions were neglected, Apal?la unleashed hydraulic disorder, devastating Swat and causing destruction and famine. It was then converted and placated by Buddha himself, who extended to the river-serpent the right to perform periodic flooding (Tucci 1958a: n. 18). The possible interpretations - beyond the superficial coincidence with the Rgvedic myth of Indra and Vrtra - are various. However, the idea may well be present that efficient hydraulic control and the agricultural potential of the entire valley depended in the past on the work of complex social organizations (from the late Bronze Age on?), while periods of political and organizational crisis may have exposed the communities to disastrous events. In this light the Buddhist communities seem ideally to be candidates for restoring an earlier order, at the same time acknowledging the marginal positive effect of flooding in regenerating the potential of its valley floor farmland. They were certainly responsible for the creation of a hydraulic panorama of unprecedented complexity. The numerous masonry wells still visible on the plain or the hillsides, such as the tanks for collecting spring water, seem to be lined with walls similar to those of the better quality masonry of the religious complexes. At BKG the contemporary non religious buildings displayed the use of different building techniques, which were less precise and in any case non homogeneous. While in the 132 [60]</page><page sequence="61">non religious environments of the courtyards in BKG the wells have a rectangular layout, in the monastic and sacred constructions they are circular (see Figs. 62 and 66 for instance). A well may consist of a simple hole, above all in the compact clay of Swat: the fact that the wells in the country were lined with masonry is an indication of the apparent desire to create long-lasting supply points. The most monumental example is found in Buner, at the site of Sunigram, the Gandharan type stone lined well of which was accessible thanks to a stone staircase (Stein 1899: pi. V). The monasteries' interest in water supplies in the country was not limited to digging and maintaining wells, cisterns and springs. Several important complexes, such as Tokar dara 1, Najigram and Tok-dara have huge building works to dam, convey, collect and distribute water from streams, also using bold technical choices, such as aerial aqueducts which extended transversely across the beds of the local tangai. These infrastructures may have been used both to control flooding and torrential rainfall episodes and for the accumulation of water energy to drive the water mills (never found but which must have existed: see Farooq Swati et al. 2002: pi. 11). In the lesser valleys the sacred area lie precisely on the banks of torrents (at Kolai, actually on an island on the torrent), as though water represented the principal wealth. Furthermore, the more remote sacred areas (including Amluk-dara and Abbasaheb china 1-2) are located near important springs or mountain lake basins, and in any case near large water reserves (in this connection, see also Faccenna, forthcoming a). In view of this we wondered whether any definite relationship existed between the early spread of Buddhism and the demand for farm goods, through the possibility of reconverting the best land to farming rather than to continue to waste it for the traditional burial areas. Perhaps the Buddhist ritual which, by reappropriating the land, concentrated the community funeral worship in the symbol of the st?pa {pars pro toto) (see Stacul 1995: 210; Olivieri &amp; Vidale 2004: n. 25) had managed to satisfy also a compelling economic need. The role of the monastic communities seems decisive not only in controlling irrigation (or the water mills) and therefore the fertile land, but also the communication routes, as well as also the mountain passes and pastures. The rural communities living in the more remote areas of our valleys and principally in Kandak and Kotah seem to have been societies in the main with a pastoral economy, after the control and management of farm land had already been jeopardized starting in the late Bronze Age. Animal husbandry and grazing were perhaps semi nomadic, as has been suggested in a recent study (Young 2003). The seasonal activities of transhumance might have been controlled by the high altitude Buddhist centres through the management of the springs, the passes and the pastures. This management may have entrained periods of crisis and tension but must certainly have represented an important asset for the monks and a serious restriction of ownership of the pastures for the rural communities. These remarks of ours on the economic activity of the Buddhsit foundations and their role in the management of the territory must be viewed in a purely [61] 133</page><page sequence="62">hypothetical light. There is no doubt that they fit perfectly with the conclusions of the fine lecture by G. Schopen on M?lasarv?stiv?da-vinaya (prob. lst-2nd A.D.) delivered at Kansas City nel 2000, but still to be published ('Art, Beauty and the Business of Running a Buddhist Monastery in Early Northwest India'; see also references in Schopen 2005, 2006). These data, as A. Filigenzi points out, are accompanied by important written documents (the earliest dates back to the first half of the 1st A.D.): 'mentionnant le creusement des puits ou l'amenagement des etangs, travaux qui paraissent avoir ete faits par des bouddhistes ? titre de bonne action "en l'honneur de toutes les etres"' (Fussman 1994: 33), or the relationship between monkish communities and agriculture: for instance, the role attributed by the sources to the Buddhists, for example regarding the spread of the precious saffron crop in Kashmir [ibid:. 43). While on the Swat valley floor and that of its tributary valleys Buddhist monasteries and sacred areas continued to develop, the painted shelters and historic age rock art in general attest to cultures and communities that unwillingly yielded to or resisted the spread of formalized religions. In the sites of Kafir-kot 1-2 st?pas are depicted with the characteristics of 2nd-3rd architecture A.D. (LMO in Abdul Nasir et al. 1995); they are surrounded by archers also on horseback; in the centre stands a totemic symbol which from Gogdara I (late phase) on is repeated almost as though it was the emblem of a culture now nearing its epilogue: the crossed wheel. The opposition between Buddhist architecture and archers and warriors on horseback, sometimes gathered around their emblem, is one of the recurrent themes of historic age rock art (see Table 2). This is clearly exemplified at Dwolasmane-patai 1 (Fig. 9), Kafir-kot 1-2 (Fig. 38), Shamo, Hinduano-hatai and Bang-doghal (Fig. 8). The latter is an open-air site with numerous carvings, most of which seem to refer to an actual ideological-religious conflict, as Karl Jettmar defined it, with reference to the rock art evidence of the Upper Indus and the valleys around Nanga Parbat and Hunza (Jettmar 1997). While there is no doubt that the latter forms reflect a radical cultural opposition, it is not clear whether, in Swat, painters and carvers, whether men or women (in present-day Swat graphic decoration is often the task of women) are actual protagonists or just witnesses of an ideological clash observed from the outskirts of the more remote areas of the valley. Still today the peoples of Swat carve on boulders the mechanical symbols of the new world that is advancing, such as motor lorries and minibuses, the access of which to the valleys is still impossible (Fig. 79). The economy of the Buddhist foundations doubtless favoured, and even conditioned, the growth, development and decadence of BKG. What is certain is that the decadence of the BKG and that of the monasteries proceeded at the same rate and with them, the abandonment of the land, the covering of the wells and of the hydraulic works; and, as P. Callieri suggests, the process may be developed chain fashion also in the opposite direction. In time, the rural communities may have regained control over the land, the pastures and the passes, thereby bringing about a 134 [62]</page><page sequence="63">radical transformation of the economy of the Valleys. The reappropriation of mountain pasture land by semi-nomad peoples may have led to gradual deforestation (the management of the forestry economy might have been another asset held by the Buddhist mountain foundations; see, for the protohistoric age, Stacul 1987): the proof of this is the identification in many sites of high altitude stratigraphic sections with thick layers of loose red soil: this is typical soil of Pinus excelsa, Pinus longifolia and Cedrus deodora forests (prized trees that are nowadays residual above 2,000 and 2,500 m asl). This fact, but also the gradual desertification of many areas due to deforestation and soil erosion, the lowering of the water table and the withdrawal of the glaciers, may certainly be considered as forgotten co-causes of the economic crisis that began in the late-ancient age. Chronological Evidence The phase in which Buddhism flourished in the three valleys is easy to identify in the stratigraphy of the built up area of BKG (Olivieri 2003a). It could correspond to Periods VI-VIII of trench BKG 4/5 (the main trench of those dug between 1984 and 1992), or with the Middle-Late Kushan phases (Callieri et al. 1992; MacDowall &amp; Callieri 2004), and thus with the 'demilitarisation' phase of the Indo-Greek and Saka-Parthian fortified city (Olivieri 1996b, 2003a), which had now become an integral part, together with the whole of Swat, of the 'metropolitan territories' of the now pacified Kushana Empire (the so-called pax kusanica referred to by Tucci in his long 1977 article On Swat). Period VI of BKG 4/5 dates the construction of an important small sacred area intra muros, the final building phase of which, prior to its final abandonment, are situated in Period VIII. Period VI is also involved in finds in a chamber contiguous with the sacred area of two Gandharan steles in situ, perhaps the first ever found in a certain stratigraphic urban context (Callieri et al. 1992: pi. XVIII). In this period of great building development, of military peace, wealth and trade (always judging by the excavation evidence), it would be possible to include the flourishing of so many new Buddhist construction in the countryside S of the city. The pottery evidence gathered in a representative sample of sites nevertheless allows us to consider the Saka-Parthian period as the one in which the occupation of the territory by the Buddhist Fig. 79 - A tradition still alive: modern carvings near Lekha-gatha 2. (Photo by MV). [63] 135</page><page sequence="64">communities had already begun: this phase corresponds to Periods IV-V of BKG 4/5, that is, the great building development phase in BKG {ibid.) (see Table 2). On the other hand, as D. Faccenna points out, the large site of Tokard-dara 1 may be dated on the basis of its structure, which has much in common with Saidu Sharif I, at least in the mid 1st A.D (about the building relevance of the Saka-Parthian period see also Faccenna, this issue). One of the most interesting markers as far as pottery is concerned is the spread of the 'paddle and anvil' technique which, in the Kushana age, paralleled and then almost replace the wheel turning technique. Since 'paddle and anvil' pottery is known to be typical of the Indo-Gangetic area, in this phase, we are apparently witnessing a process of Tndianization' of part of the material culture brought about by the Kushana state (see Table 1). This phenomenon is not surprising as it was precisely during this phase that we find the most important evidence of inter-regional trade, principally with the Mathura area (see Taddei 2004). The ceramic data show that only a few sites in the sample investigated survive the late age. Further elements accompany these data. Buddhist rock reliefs are the iconic expressions of the presence of Tantray?na and Vajray?na schools and cult centers. Studies carried out on this topic (Filigenzi, forthcoming e) show that only a few of the hundreds of complexes built in Swat, Buner, Dir, Puran developed into similar centers. This phenomenon occurred after a phase of great crisis for Buddhism in the region: between the 6th(?)-7th and 8th A.D. (see Filigenzi, this issue). Perhaps during this period only the monasteries belonging to these schools were fully active as the archaeological data and written sources (Chinese evidence, see Tucci 1977: 68 ff.) agree in indicating the 6th-7th A.D. as the saeculum horribile of Buddhism in Swat. The Tantray?na and Vajray?na school monasteries are concentrated in specific areas, in Swat, mainly in the Saidu, Jambil and Ugad valleys (around the area of Mingora and Mangwlaor), around Udegram and Manyar, at BKG, particularly on the left bank of the Swat. The valleys mentioned so far (with three exceptions: BKG, Nawe-kalai and Amluk-dara) were not involved in this phenomenon. At Amluk-dara the relief (Stein 1930: 18) has unfortunately been lost. Nawe-kalai, although lying at the mouth of the Kotah valley, is situated outside of it and is part of the centres built on the left bank of the Swat. Lastly BKG, because of its peculiar position, managed to survive beyond the end of the ancient age. As we have seen, the hill (acropolis) of BKG definitely housed a Buddhist sacred area also in a late age. The two reliefs on the hillside are certain evidence of this. It is statistically certain that this type of icon was always found along the paths giving immediate access to a sacred area. At BKG the Gandhara age foundation was doubtless transformed into a late Buddhist school centre and was ultimately replaced, by means of a a monumental building operation, at the end of the 7th A.D. by a Brahmanic temple foundation, which was excavated by us starting from 1998 (Callieri et al. 2000, 2000-2001; Olivieri 136 [64]</page><page sequence="65">Table 1.

According to these hypotheses, on the other hand, in the three valleys a situation of crisis and abandon prevailed. The abandon was perhaps only partial (the Karakar route may have retained some of its importance), although here the economic and ideological investments were not made which in other valleys led to the flourishing of the centres of the new schools. (LMO&amp;MV) People and Cultures of the Late Antiquity Genesis of a Kafiri Human Landscape From the 6th century A.D. onward, a sea change occurred in the human landscape in Swat. The large cities like BKG and Udegram began to decline; their inhabitants withdrew to more protected dwellings in the mountains. The cities emptied and were gradually abandoned. Many of the Buddhist monastic foundations lay in ruins, as is narrated by the Chinese pilgrims. Only a few religious complexes, as we have seen, enjoyed a new period of prosperity, becoming the headquarters of large late Buddhist schools. This phase saw the beginning of the process of fortification typical of late ancient Swat. The city of BKG was abandoned in favour of tower constructions built on the E side of the hill (Olivieri 2003 a). Other fortified centres were built on the hills in the Kotah valley, near the Swat gorges at Kalungai and Qal'a: the so-called tower houses (Id. 1996a, 2003a). It almost seems that the settlement process during this period was concentrated in the lower part of Middle Swat (according to the definition proposed in Id. 2003a: 13), but did not extend beyond the BKG area. The focus of this settlement process is situated roughly in the Thana area, from which it radiates out through the tributary valleys to the North and South, from Talash as far as Buner. The dwelling units comprising the individual groupings almost always have a rectangular layout, subdivided into two square rooms. One of the two always has a tower form; there are occasional single towers. They are of simple construction: the walls have no foundation trenches and are built directly onto the rock. Sometimes, in order to offset the difference in level, the houses are placed on platforms supported by the hillside. Access to the interior is almost always located on the first storey, which is reached by means of a removeable ladder. In those cases in which the entrance is located on the ground floor, it could be closed from the inside by means of heavy wooden beams. Access to the upper storey is provided through a narrow trapdoor. 138 [66]</page><page sequence="67">In individual villages (no more than seven or eight houses) the simple street layout may be recognized even today and sometimes even a rough outer wall provided with loopholes. The villages are often situated within view of each other, clearly visible on the ridges and hilltops. The tower-houses, in the absence of excavations, have been dated as ante 9th A.D. thanks to a serendipitous find, as well as on the basis of the reconnaissance of the BKG hill and analysis of the pottery sampled on the surface. In the site of Qal'a, situated at the entrance to the Swat gorges, a tower with cylindrical buttresses has been documented which abuts and is supported by the structure of a tower-house {ibid.: 40, fig. 41). This type of buttressed tower is well-known throughout Swat as a result of Italian and Pakistani research (ref. in ibid.). These fortified structures may be dated to the Late Shahi or Hindu-Shahi period (9th-10th A.D.; ref. ibid.). This simple but non banal fact points to a very important stratigraphic fact: the tower-houses may be older than a 9th A.D. and perhaps lie in the era of the so-called 'Early Shahi', or Turki-Shahi, or Shahi of Kabul (7th-8th A.D.). This is the era of the building upheaval that witnessed on the top of the BKG hill the construction of the Brahmanic foundation and, on the E hillside, the large tower-house settlement (ibid.; Callieri 2005: 423-24). In the present-day Kafir villages there are buildings similar to our tower-houses, known as kot. Still today this comparison is one of the most interesting and stimulating for the purpose of understanding this phenomenon. Also in the Upper Indus, until a few years ago, there were villages based on models similar to those of the tower-house complexes. '[They are] built according the pre-Islamic orientation. The towers belonged to specified quarters of the village [...]' (Jettmar 1967: 17). The actual spatial layout of the village reflects a non random structuring (houses/tower houses, 'male'/Temale' zones). Entire valleys even appear to reflect a form of metaphysical order. For example in Punyal the women's sanctuary near the village of Bubur is situated at the bottom of the valley near the river. The men's sanctuary is on the opposite side of the river on a terrace set high on which the village of Gakuch also lies. (Ibid: 73). Our area of investigation contains several of the best conserved examples of the whole of Swat, which form the object of an excavation campaign planned for 2007: the four complexes of Hissar 1-4 situated on the left flank of the lower part of the Kotah valley. On the right hand side lie the sites of Sur-kamar and Tor-gumbat. There are only a few sites of this kind in the Kandak valley: Maishkhano-maidan, Nawarale-tangai and Begum-kot. Similar complexes in the Karakar valley are found at Hakim Barikot, Ashgarai-ghar, Gadhiar 1, Kilarano-tangai, Nare-tangai and Mia kote. Their presence at the NW boundary of the area in which this typology spread out is doubtless explained by the possibility of still controlling the Karakar route. Beyond the pass of the same name, as far as Barandu to the SW and beyond Jowar to the S, other tower-house complexes had already been identified in the past (Olivieri 1996a, 2003a). [67] 139</page><page sequence="68">ft AMSV 362 Malak-ziarat KU 2005 Fig. 80 - Malak-ziarat, the paintings. (Drawing by LMO and MV). This transition was no doubt gradual and for a long time cities in the process of being abandoned, Buddhist centres in crisis, must have coexisted with the progression of the new models of occupation of the territory, which may be considered to have been completed by the 7th A.D. Xuanzang, for instance, describes the progress of Brahmanism (see Tucci 1977: 68 ff.) and mentions 10 temples dedicated to the deva. We are familiar with two of the latter: that of BKG (Callieri et al. 2000, 2000-2001; Callieri 2005; Filigenzi 2005), of which also a dedicatory inscription is believed to exist (Tucci 1977: n. 92) and probably that of Hati-dara (see above). Moreover, in the upper Kotah valley, painted shelters have been documented with partially different characteristics from the others. In the first place, the paintings are bright ochre, almost orange, in colour and the subjects depicted, although subscribing to the ideographic lexicon typical of such manifestations, here definitely reflect a Brahmanic religious symbology. In the shelters of Dandi-sar 2 (Fig. 25) and Malak-ziarat (Fig. 80) (but also at AMSV 409, 418 and 441.1; see the Postscript) the depictions of trisula stand out; at Malak-ziarat this symbol is accompanied by a st?pa model in a representation that could perhaps be considered an icon of this transition phase. As aptly summarized by Tucci (1977), side by side with the spread of Brahmanism and the Vajray?na, we also witness a 'revival of aboriginal cults' belonging to agents and cultures that the Buddhist centres had controlled and managed but, we think, never converted. Other evidences of a 'Kafiri' culture came out from the Raja Gira graveyard (see Bagnera, this issue). In the 7th A.D. Swat was apparendy involved in two separate situations: NE of BKG we still find that the Buddhist foundations are dominant, those that accommodated in their doctrine the boldest elements of the new schools of Tantric inspiration. To the SW the tower-house complexes he, while, except in a couple of enclaves, the number of late Buddhist school foundations is limited. We do not know whether this is the result of a political distinction or not. Tucci pointed out in this connection that the Tibetan and Chinese sources of the 8th century A.D. describe Swat as split into two political entities: one ruled by the Buddhist king Indrabhuti (protector of the late Buddhist schools), the other dependent on the Laghman area (Tucci 1958a: n. 1; 1977: 75). In this regard, together with P. Callieri, we wondered whether this source may be interpreted as the reflection of a political predominance in the lower Swat valley by the Shahi of Kabul. 140 [68]</page><page sequence="69">With the foundation of the tower-house complexes we witness a radical cultural and economic change. New pottery forms appear, especially ordinary pottery, which is enhanced by handles, lugs and spouts, as well as quality ceramics, in which white and red decorations prevail, often on golden slip (Callieri 1990b, 2000; Olivieri 2003b). These new forms differ from the Late Kushan age ones, as from the typical Islamizing horizon from the 11th A.D. on. The big hydraulic plants were probably abandoned and the springs and wells filled in; the litde available evidence points to pastoral activities and the onset of a new' agricultural or gathering activity - wine production. On the top of Palwano-gata, where the Kotah valley opens on to the Mardan plain, we found what seems to be the latest painted shelters. In a countryside marked by a tumble of gneiss boulders, at an altitude of about 2,000 m, various indications of a non occasional presence have been documented: steps carved out of the stone (Fig. 35), basins, sinuous structures dug out of the rock (Fig. 36). The shelter contains a painting depicting a herd of caprids, horses and a single ascertained human figure: a hieratic character with an elaborate mande, with protruding arm and a hand with the fingers extending outwards (Fig. 33). Below the paintings there is a rough carving depicting one or more superpimposed st?pas (Fig. 34). At Palwano-gata 1 the typical style of the caprids - schematic, linear, with the body rendered by means of a single curving line - is the same as in the paintings of the Kalash peoples of the Chitral (similar paintings were discovered in Summer 2006; see the Postscript). Slightly further on, a huge boulder suggests the gigantic figure of a reptile: oddly enough, where one imagines the head of the gigantic figure to be, a hand has deeply carved the circle of the eye and the pupil (Fig. 37). This deliberate intervention, aimed at reinforcing the suggestion that the rock resembled a monster, means that greater credence and attention must be paid to the vast and ambiguous repertoire of gigantic images sculpted by nature in these places: examples are the anthropomorphic and zoomorphic rocks in the Saidu, Kandak and Kotah valleys. The Chinese pilgrim Xuanzang mentioned the elephant-shaped rock overhanging Swat into which the white elephant of the legendary king Uttarasena had been transformed (Tucci 1958a: 299). Also significant are the remarks of Biddulph (1880: 15) and Jettmar (1967: 74) on the zoomorphic rock in the village of Gor (Gilgit), in which Taiban, the male representative of the divine couple in the Dardic pantheon, may be recognized in the form of a black stallion. Forms of anthropomorphization of the landscape are often found in Swat and neighbouring regions, at Ghirai, for instance (Fig. 45), but also elsewhere like at Ranigat. Here the natural monolith dominating the summit of the site perhaps represents the 'Queen' giving the name to the site, or else lies at the origin of the name of the ridge, the translation of which is 'Skyreaching Ridge Temple' (Odani 2000: 1, fig. 1). Lastly, the pictorial document of Palwano-gata 1 enlightens us as to what must probably have been one of the greatest assets and marks of prosperity for the peoples inhabiting this area - the possession of cattle and the consequent management of grazing land and the passes. In accordance with an old and consolidated thesis, on which numerous researchers agree (from Raverty, Yule, Voigt to Lentz, Jettmar, A.M. and A.S. Cacopardo) Swat [69] 141</page><page sequence="70">can thus perhaps be included in the area of diffusion of Kafir culture ('Peristan' better than 'Greater Kafiristan') before the latter was reduced to the present enclaves in upper Chitral (Scarcia 1965; Cacopardo &amp; Cacopardo 2001) (Table 2). The Chinese source cited by Tucci which mentioned a part of Swat being under the control of Laghmhan is of great interest regarding both what we know of this province down to modern times (Scarcia 1965) and in view of the evidence regarding its rock art, which has much in common with our later manifestations (Bourgeois &amp; Bourgeois 1971; Jung 2003). In spite of its vagueness, this information, if incorporated in a geopolitical reconstruction that takes into account the Chinese, Tibetan and Turko-Muslim strategies, could provide an important historiographic support to the thesis. The Importance of Wine-making During the reconnaissance of the Kandak and Kotah valleys dozens of boulders were documented with quadrangular or irregular basins carved out of them, as well as slabs with deep quadrangular carvings; basins and carvings were all provided with an overflow hole or canal. It was therefore a triple typ Mogy: the first is the most common one - rectangular tanks with an overflow hole (a type widespread in both Kandak and more particular in the upper Kotah valley, see also Olivieri &amp; Vidale 2004: figs. 33-34) (Figs. 81-82); the second type is characterized by sub-circular cavities connected to basins placed at a lower level, or else by basins connected to holes to house levers (documented only in the Saidu valley sites) (see Figs. 42-43); the third type consists of the so-called 'palettes' (see Fig. 28): rectangular carvings, having the same size as the tanks, carved out of inclined boulder and joined by an overflow canal (Kandak and Kotah, and also in the Jambil, at Jabbra: see ihid.\ also at Kubla-lai and Amluk-lai, respectively nos. 10 and 102 on the Jambil Archaeological Map in Gui &amp; Cimmino, unpubl.) (Fig. 83). Excluded from this typology are the simple excavated tanks without overflow, which are typical in the mountain Buddhist settlements (e.g. Amluk; see Fig. 11) and generally constructed on crystalline rock outcrops {ibid:, n. 21). The serendipitous find of 2 sites with tanks of the first type having walls made of pseudo-isodomic stone blocks (Banj-ghwandai 1, Bang-khas) suggested the hypothesis of the so-called 'palettes' used as working surface, to which stone or wood partitions were added in the outer canals. This study unequivocally showed that they were devices for pressing grapes, i.e. wine? presses. This is a relatively widespread type of utensil: suffice it to take the example of the Italian palmenti that remained in used until late last century, as well as of the Roman age tanks, for instance in Tuscany (Masi 2005), but also elsewhere in Eurasia and East Africa. Even more rigorous comparisons can be made with the methods and equipment used in the 'Kafir' environment (Fig. 84). As Sir G.S. Robertson writes: One day I went to see wine being made at Binaram, a hamlet close to Kamdesh. The arrangements were very simple. A flat-topped boulder conveniently placed by the roadside formed the floor of the wine-press [cf. Fig. 83], and one side of a 142 [70]</page><page sequence="71">Table 2.

The other walls, more or less semicircular in continuous outline, were made by stones placed one on the top of the other and raised the height by two and a half feet, the interstice being filled up with clay. The greatest length of the vat was about five feet six inches, and its greatest breadth about four feet. The floor sloped naturally, and at the lower end, in front, an aperture had been left, partly closed by a little brushwood, from under which a deeply-grooved piece of wood, with its edges still further deepened by clay from the vat, protruded, and afforded an outlet for the expressed juice. (1896: 558-59). 144 [721</page><page sequence="73">Those same years, G.W. Leitner, on returning from a reconnaissance in Dardistan and Hunza, wrote with un? witting irony: The Gilgitis are great wine-drinkers, though not so much as the people of Hunza. In Nagyr little wine is made. The mode of preparation of the wine is a simple one. The grapes are stamped out by a man who, fortunately before entering into the wine-press, washes his feet and hands. The juice flows into another reservoir, which is first well laid round with stones, over which a cement is heated. (18942: 39). Further evidence comes from Masson (see Edelberg &amp; Jones 1979: fig. 41) and the research by the Senfts (Senft &amp; Senft 1986). Lastly, for the consumption of alcoholic beverages as late as the 17th A.D. in Swat in populations in which elements of Kafir culture may be discerned, see the evidence provided by the Tibetan pilgrim sTag ts'ari ras pa (in Tucci 1940=Filigenzi &amp; Callieri 1997). In the upper Kotah valley, the frequency of these artefacts is astonishing: one artefact every 5 ha, for a possible wine pressing activity capable of treating 2-3,000 qt of grapes per day (with a conservatively estimated yield of 1,500 hi), with the employment of about 100 individuals (according to the characteristics of the similar Italian palmenti\ source Enciclopedia Italiana, see 'Vino' entry). The last terraces of the Kotah valley are ideal for wine-growing: the loose silica rich soil and the specific microclimate materially create physiographic conditions quite similar to those found in many areas of inland southern Italy (still today the gravevine grows spontaneously in the area) and in the past grapes may have been the object of seasonal gathering rather than an actual cultivated crop, as is shown by the ethnographic data of Edelberg &amp; Jones (1979: 64). In the specific area of distribution of the artefacts alone (c. 250 ha), taking into account that they are probably not specialist and intensive crops according to modern criteria, a conservative (under)estimate of the annual yield would be a maximum of 6-8,000 hi (processing of Enciclopedia Italiana data, see 'Vino' entry, tab. 1). The calculations envisage all the wine-presses in operation at the same time. In actual fact, the different state of conservation of artefacts on the same lithic support seems to suggest that not all these artefacts are contemporary. It is in any case probable that these zones of Middle Swat (including the upper Jambil and Saidu valleys, from which other examples come, see the Sites List) were important wine producing areas at the time. One of these artefacts was found inside a shelter bearing traces of paintings, Gwarejo-patai (a possible indication but not proof of antiquity) (Figs. 30-31). Slightly Fig. 85 - Sanchar, a 'palette'. (Photo by LMO). [73] 145</page><page sequence="74">further downstream, at Talang, near a ford, we uncovered a large shelter where a succession of different types of rock graphics is concentrated. The earliest phase is represented by permutations of highly eroded cup-marks. On the sides of the shelter traces of red paintings have been partly cancelled out by carvings depicting warriors on horseback (Figs. 40-41). The incised scenes have themselves been covered by five lines written in Br?hmi scripts dating to the medieval age. The inscription is currently being studied by Riccardo Garbini (see Garbini, Appendix in this paper). This seems to support an indirect ?stratigraphic' according to which the artefacts used for grape pressing are rather ancient, in any case earlier than the 15th A.D. (a date that may be considered the most recent limit of the painted shelters). (LMO) Appendix The Talang Rock Shelter: The Inscriptions (Fig. 86) At the site of Talang, a large boulder was observed (about h 2.00 m and w 3.00 m) bearing incised figures and an inscription in the central part. The inscription consists of 6 lines of Br?hmi script, similar to the late sarada variety, large in size (h 0.20 m c), with a ductus 4 mm deep c. The conditions of the epigraph have been affected by exposure to atmospheric agents, which make its interpretation less than immediate. The present note is by kind courtesy of LMO and MV who first have discovered the inscription and have collected digital photographic images and the physical characteristics of the inscription. A first reading of the epigraph is as follows: Text: 1. sri saso t(i)stha sa lepu . . cha . . sra(?)ga(?) 2..'. 3.. . . hulaputra mu(ni?) 4. samh?. . . . ghasa sa(?) 5.da karatvena . . 6. Palaeographic Characteristics The specimen, in sarada characters, seems to be a later version than those from Chilas, Gilgit and Skardu collected by von Hin?ber (2004) and dating to the 7th-8th century A.D., by Hund, dating to the 8th century A.D. (Sahni, S.S. 1932) and by Laghman (Humbach 1985), as well as the ten line inscription dating to between the 8th and the 10th century A.D., incised on a boulder on the banks of the river Kunar, and found near Arandu (Khan 2002) as well as the contemporary one from the Alingar valley (Mohammadzai 2002). Also from the same area are the Barikot (Bir-kot-ghwandai) inscription dating to the 10th century A.D. (Sahni, B.D. 1933: 146 [74]</page><page sequence="75">Fig. 86 - The Talang inscription. (Photo processed by LMO). 301), and the Zalamkot (Zalam-kot) bilingual inscribed stone slab dating to 401 A.H. (822 A.D.) (Abdur Rahman 1988): both are also of an earlier style than our specimen. Several characters (ka, td) display similarities with 'medieval inscriptions' from Chilas and, as in the case of the Gondophares Rock, 'dated to the mediaeval period, some time in the 14th or 15th century A.D.' (Dani 1983: 88, 221). Therefore the text may be provisionally dated, according to available palaeographic evidence, as between the 12th and 15th century. (RG) Postscript During the 2006 Summer campaign, with the help of Faiz-ur-Rahman, the Representative of the Department, other sites were discovered and consequendy added to the maps illustrating this Report. Apart from the discovery in the Kotah valley of an impressive Iron Age rock painting near Churkhai (AMSV 407), a Late Historic one (AMSV 409) and others which were badly preserved (AMSV 410 and 411), a group of Late Historic painted shelters has been documented by chance in the area S of the Topialai ridge (AMSV 415,416,417,418,421.1,421.2,421.3,423,424,426.1, 426.2, 426.3, 427, 428, 429.1, 429.2, 429.3, 441.1, 441.2, 441.3, 442, 443.1, 443.2, 444, 445, and 446). The newly discovered painted shelters will be presented at the next SAA Conference in Ravenna, in July 2007. During the survey many new wine-presses have been discovered both in Kandak (2 in AMSV 401, and 2 in AMSV 244) and Kotah valleys (AMSV 404,431,437,439 and 4 near AMSV 364). Tanks and cup-marked boulders have also been noticed in Karakar valley, upstream Amluk-dara (AMSV 412 and 413), but the most interesting cup-mark sub-figurative [75] 147</page><page sequence="76">permutations came from Kotah valley (AMSV 402, but also 404,437,403,430,439,462,463,464 and 438 - the latters with a tank) and from the area of Saffar-kandao (AMSV 447). New large Historic setdements have been discovered in Kotah valley (AMSV 408, 436, 438 and 419) as well as many new Buddhist sacred areas (AMSV 406, 434, 435, 440, and 420) in the Kotah valley and above Nal (Thana) (AMSV 432 and 433). A new Buddhist site has been discovered at Bacha-kot, S of Amluk (AMSV 425). A more detailed survey in the area of Amluk (AMSV 136) has revealed the existence of a monastic rock hermitage: amongst the several natural cavities piercing the precipitous NW side of the Loe Topialai rock pinnacle (2000 m asl), at least 5 caves were artificially modified and transformed into monastic cells. The near peak of Bar Topialai (2030 m asl) with its carved flight of steps hosts a tank dug out of the flat rock summit (AMSV 414). A small Late Historic settlement has been localized upstream Amluk-dara (AMSV 413, see above). During the campaign several rock-art sites (AMSV 454, 448.2, 449.1, 449.2, 449.3, 455, 456, 457, 458, 459.1, 459.2) as well as Protohistorical (AMSV 448.1, 453) and Historical sites (AMSV 450) have been documented on the left side of the Lower Saidu valley.
