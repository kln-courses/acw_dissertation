GENTI E CULTURE DELL'ITALIA PREROMANA, by Mas- simo Pallottino. (Guide allo studio della civilta ro- mana 1,2.) Pp. 136, figs. 19, pls. 54. Societa Edito- riale Jouvence, Via Castelfranco Veneto 88, Rome 1981. Lit. 12,000. Historians, archaeologists and linguists can now avail themselves of this summary of new approaches and discov- eries that have transformed our knowledge of pre-Roman Italy. The six-volume Popoli e civilt&amp; dell'Italia antica (1974-78) sets them out in detail. Massimo Pallottino, him- self responsible for many of these advances, in the book un- der review distills this information into concise text and wonderfully up-to-date, readable new maps of the popula- tions, languages and cultures of ancient Italy. He briefly ex- amines theories and evidence concerning the formation or "origin" of the historical peoples of Italy in the ninth and eighth centuries B.C.-Mediterranean substratum, Indo- europeanization, and distribution of Italy's native lan- guages and populations, whose fascinating variety contrasts so strikingly with contemporary Greece. He next traces their complex history: Phoenician and Greek colonization and influence, illustrated by discoveries at Motya, Sybaris, Metapontum, Pithekoussai; the primitive populations of Sardinia, Corsica and Sicily, of southern Italy including Campania, and of Latium. Along the Adriatic shore, cul- tural interchange involved Puglia, Picenum, the Veneto, Istria and Dalmatia in modern Yugoslavia; populations in- cluded lapyges, "Illyrians," Apulians, and Messapians with their colorful ceramics and anthropomorphic funerary ste- lai. Charted are the rise, expansion and decline of the Etrus- cans, the movements of the Osco-Umbrians, and the peo- ples of the Po Valley, Veneto, Liguria and the Alpine re- gions. The Celtic expansion brought the Gauls. Finally, Romanization. What changed and eventually dissolved the ethnic plurality of the world of Italy was not a nation (like the Etruscans), or a foreign power (like Pyrrhos of Epiros), but a city state that boasted it was born from the union of different peoples, Latin, Sabine and Etruscan. The plates of this affordable and indispensable book include our old fa- vorite, the Capestrano Warrior, as well as a Sabine inscrip- tion in Boston, "Nestor's Cup," and the new archaic Latin inscription from Satricum.
