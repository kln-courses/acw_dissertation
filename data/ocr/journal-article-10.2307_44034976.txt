<plain_text><page sequence="1">MARCUS AURELIUS AND «ZEUS KASIOS» AT CARNUNTUM Recent excavations at Carnuntum have raised anew chronological and interpretive problems connected with two weather miracles which came to the aid of Marcus Aurelius and his troops in their struggle with the Marcomanni and Quadi. The new evidence allows a closer examination of the means by which Marcus used the miracles both to enhance his prestige and to restore the confidence and morale of his army. After a series of disasters which included the burning of Optergium and the siege of Aquileia, Marcus Aurelius was at last able in 172 to undertake an offensive against the German tribes north of the Danube.1 The chro- nology of the following campaigns and of the course of the war is uncertain and confusing. The ancient sources are lamentably defective.2 It seems that Marcus' first campaign was directed against the Marco- manni in 172; then in 173, he turned against the Quadi.3 It has been argued on the basis of Dio lxxi 1 1 that the war against the Quadi preceded that against the Marcomanni.4 The passage reports that Marcus remained in Pannonia and received embassies from many of the Germanic tribes, including the Quadi who were seeking peace terms. The Quadi obtained peace at the price of supplying cattle and horses and promising to return 13,000 prisoners and deserters. The reference to Marcus remaining in Pannonia has been taken as referring to his departure from Carnuntum in 173/4 and the reference to the embassies as the result of an overwhelming victory only possible as a sequel to the successful offensive in 172. 5 1 For the attack of the Marcomanni and Quadi on Northern Italy, see Amm. Marc. XXIX 6.1. The date for the opening of the offensive was established by J. Dobiáš, Le monnayage de M arc- Aurel et les bas-reliefs historiques contemporains, RN series IV 35 (1932), p. 127-172; see especially p. 128-132. This conclusion was reinforced by W. ZwiKKER, Studien zur Markussäule ( Allard Pierson Stichting, Archaeol.-Hist. Bijdragen, 8), Amsterdam 1941, p. 128 ff. 2 W. Zwikker, op.cit. (n. 1), p. 128 ff. 3 I adopt here (and argue for) the chronology of A. Birley, Marcus Aurelius , London 1966, Appendix III, p. 323-327. This chronology is also followed by H.W. Böhme, Archäologische Zeugnisse zur Geschichte der Markomannenkriege ( 166-180 n.Chr.), JRGZ 22 ( Festschrift Hund), 2 (1975), p. 197. 4 W. Zwikker, op.cit. (n. 1), p. 189-191. 5 W. Zwikker, op.cit. (n. 1), p. 190 links it with Eutropius VIII 13.1 who states that Marcus remained at Carnuntum for three years.</page><page sequence="2">152 M.M.SAGE These arguments are hardly compelling. The reference to Marcus remaining in Pannonia can as easily refer to the period before he moved north with the army over the Danube. The embassies may well have been the result of the massive defeat of the Marcomanni at the crossing of the Danube, presumably on their return from their attack on Italy. The Quadi as well had been involved in the attack on northern Italy and it may have been the fear of suffering the same fate as the Marcomanni that induced them to come to terms with the emperor. 6 This can be further supported by some general considerations. The Sixth Imperial acclamation of 171 is rightly linked with the victory over the Marcomanni at the Danube crossing. 7 This great victory must have weakened the Marcomanni who consistently appear as the most dan- gerous of Rome's enemies and who, in the later tradition, give their name to the first phase of the war.8 It would make military sense for Marcus to proceed first against the most dangerous of the tribes while they were still suffering the effects of their earlier defeat. The significance of the Marcomanni from the Roman perspective may be signalled by the appearance on Marcus' coinage of the legend «Germania Subiecta» and the award to Commodus of the title Germanicus on October 15 of 172. 9 These appear as understandable preliminary steps to Marcus' own assumption of the title and points to the significance of the enemy of 172 - that is, the Marcomanni. 'The delay of Marcus' assumption of the title would then be due to the break with the Quadi, towards whom he felt so passionate a hatred for renewing a struggle which appeared almost won. 10 Marcus' base of operation during this period was at Carnuntum in Pannonia Superior. It was well situated for operations against both the Marcomanni and the Quadi.11 The first scenes on his column portray the departure of his army north of the Danube from this base. 12 In the 6 HA, Marcus 21.13. 7 A.

The first (attested only in the Historia Augusta) is the Lightning Miracle. As a result of a prayer by the emperor, lightning destroyed an enemy siege machine. 13 The second miracle is the Rain Miracle. A rainstorm saved a Roman army beset by thirst and engaged in battle with the Quadi.14 These two miracles have assumed crucial importance because of the column. They offer the possibility that they can be dated and can thereby solve the question of whether the column is chronological. 15 The ancient sources offer three dates for the Rain Miracle. Dio, in Xiphilinus' epitome, connects the Rain Miracle with Marcus' seventh imperial acclamation which can be dated to the summer of 174. 16 This date cannot be accepted. Dio ascribes the miracle to an Egyptian magician, Arnuphis, who invoked Hermes Aerios and other daimons to save the Romans. 17 A remarkable series of coins, which begin in Marcus 27 (December 172-173) and continue into 28, interrupt a series of war-related issues with portrayals of Mercury in Greco-Roman guise. The crucial issues for identification are the sestertii which portray a temple or aediculum with an unusual curvilinear pediment and four herms serving as columns.18 The curvilinear pediment is of Egyptian provenance and serves to identify the Hermes of the coinage with the Egyptian Hermes Aerios of the Rain Miracle. 19 The sestertii as well as 13 HA, Marcus 24.4. « Fulmen de cáelo precibus suis contra hostium machinamentum extorsit.» It is represented in scene XI on the column. 14 Tertullian, Apol. 5.6; Ad Scapulam 4.5; Dio LXXI 8 and 10; Eusebius, Chronicon 270f Helm and H.E.

His conclusion that the</page><page sequence="4">154 M.M.SAGE dupondii and denarii all bear the unusual legend «Religio Augusti» which has no parallel in Marcus' coinage. It occurs again only under Valerian, in association with Diana.20 The combination of the temple and this unusual legend must surely refer to the Hermes Aerios of the Rain Miracle which must thus be dated to 172 or 173. An attempt has been made to challenge this identification. M. Grant has argued that deity on the coin is Mercurius Augustus. He takes the «religio» legend of the coinage as referring to honors paid to Augustus and the temple of the sestertii as a reference to the conquest of Egypt.21 Several points disprove this interpretation. First, this mode of reference to Augustus is so obscure as to be unrecognizable. Second, there seems to be no obvious reason to make any specific reference to Egypt in such a context, especially since the anniversary of its annexation was three years before. Finally, the issue appears in the middle of a series of emissions with reference to the German wars and therefore should be explained in such a context. Again, this dates the Rain Miracle to 172 or 173. The Chronicon of Eusebius presents two possible dates. The version of Jerome places the event in 173; the Armenian version, in 172. 22 The date of Jerome's translation is more likely that of Eusebius' original version, but no faith can be placed in these dates without independent confirmation.23 The excavations at Carnuntum appear to raise the possibility of an exact date for both the Lightning and the Rain Miracles.24 Attention temple is a conscious reference to Egypt is borne out by egyptianizing references in the Third Pompeian style, analyzed by P. Gilbert, Le fronton arrondi en Egypte et dans l'art gréco-romain , CE 33 (1942), p. 83-90. 20 RIC V.l, nos. 114 (Valerian), 29 (Saloninus).

Mosshammer, The Chronicle of Eusebius and the Greek Chronographie Tradition , Lewisburg 1979, p. 76ff. On the reliability of Eusebius' dates, see T.D. Barnes, Constantine and Eusebius , Cambrid- ge (Mass.) 1981, p. 120 and n. 115. A.G. Roos, Het Regenwonder op de Zuil van Marcus Aurelius ( Mededelingen d. Nederi. Akad. v. Wetensch., Afd. Letterk., N.R. 6,1), Amsterdam 1943, p. 2-6 suggested that Eusebius was dating the event by Olympiads and thus the date was actually Olympiad 238. But other events in the reign, such as the death of Lucius Verus (Marcus 9), are assigned to specific years which tells against such an approach. 24 See W. Jobst, II Id Juni 172 n. Chr.: Der Tag des Blitz- und Regenwunders (SA WW , 335), Wien 1978.</page><page sequence="5">MARCUS AURELIUS AND «ZEUS KASIOS» AT CARNUNTUM 1 55 has been concentrated on the Pfaffenberg, a ridge which rises to the East of the city and is its natural termination, forming the western spur of the Hainburger Mountains.25 The Pfaffenberg appears to have been, despite its unusual position, the Capitolium of Carnuntum.26 There appears to be no evidence of a pre-Roman cult on the Pfaffenberg and the first datable building begins in the reign of Hadrian under whom Carnuntum obtained municipal status.27 By the Third Century, the Pfaffenberg had developed a complex of temples, altars, and monuments centered on the Capitoline Triad, Jupiter, and the Imperial Cult. The excavations have revealed a series of three temples. The first temple is so badly damaged that any identification is impossible. Temple II has now been identified as a temple of the Capitoline Triad and, on the basis of the style of sculptural fragments, is dated to the late Second or early Third Centu- ry.28 It may well be connected with the grant of colonial status by Septimius Severus.29 Temple III (which is initially Hadrianic in date) appears to be a temple to Jupiter. In its environs, fragments of two greater-than-life-size statues - one female and the other male - were found. The male statue appears to have been enthroned with a lightning bundle in his right hand. An eagle in a sitting position was found nearby, confirming the identification of the statue as a representation of Jupiter. This interpretation is further reinforced by a wall (also of Hadrianic date) erected at the expense of the Juventus of Jupiter Dolichenus which also provides our earliest evidence for this deity from Commagene in Pannonia.30 The concentration on the cult of Jupiter is hardly surprising in the Danubian area where dedications to Jupiter Optimus Maximus predominate over those to any other deity.31 North- west of and connected with the Hadrianic temple are two large altar bases. These are associated with a further monument of Hadrianic date. 25 The fullest description is by W. Jobst, in H. Stiglitz, M. Kandler and W. Jobst, Carnuntum , in ANRW II 6, Berlin - New York 1977, p. 701-720. 26 This was the conjecture of E. Borman. See W. Jobst, loc.cit. (n. 25), p. 705. Its position is eccentric as evidenced by the location of the capitolia at Scarbantia and Savaria, also in Pannonia Superior. 27 Temple III appears to be the earliest building and a denarius of Sabina found in the foundation deposit appears to confirm this date. See W. Jobst, op. cit. (n.24), p. 22. On the date of the grant of municipal status by which Carnuntum became Municipium Aelium Carnuntum, see H. Stiglitz, loc. cit. (n.25), p. 586. 28 W.

IX (1962), col. 741.</page><page sequence="6">156 M.M.SAGE Southeast of the altar bases are the remains of a monumental column and base. This was probably originally dedicated to Hadrian on the basis of an inscription found near the base of the column.32 The building of this complex with its stress both on Jupiter and what must be seen as the Imperial Cult is probably connected with the grant of municipal status.33 Such close connections between Jupiter and the imperial presence readily conform to the general lines of Hadrianic policy. This policy stresses the links between Jupiter Optimus Maximus in the West and various forms of Zeus in the Greek East as a means of reinforcing the emperor's claims to legitimacy.34 But modifications appear to have been introduced during, or soon after, Marcus' stay at Carnuntum. The remains of a greater-than-life-size statue and head (which have unfortunately disappeared) were found near the base of the column.35 The statue appears to have crowned the monumental column.36 Jobst has identified the head as that of Marcus by comparing it with other portraits of the emperor. Although the head is badly preserved, it violates one of the normal characteristics of portraits of Marcus in this period - the change in hairstyle. The portrait busts of the 170's show the hair off the forehead and highcombed.37 The only other portrait of the emperor found at Carnuntum, a bronze bust (presumably produced locally), is of some help in resolving the problem of identification.38 It is a product of the same provincial milieu as the monumental statue. It also displays a hairstyle in which the hair partially covers the forehead. It is similar as well in the portrayal of the beard and lips. A dedication from Temple III offers further, but not conclusive, support. It is a dedication on behalf of Marcus and Commo- dus, dated 11 June 172. 39 32 W. Jobst, op. cit. (n.24), p. 21. 33 W.

Johne, Zu den Siegennamen der Kaiser Marc Aurel und Commodus, Klio 48 (1967), p. 178-179. The «consistentium» of line 3 proves conclusively the hypothesis of A. Birley, op. cit. (n. 3), p. 234-235 that Commodus accompanied Marcus Aurelius during the campaign of 172.</page><page sequence="7">MARCUS AURELIUS AND «ZEUS KASIOS» AT CARNUNTUM 1 57 South of this apparent monument to Marcus, in the direction of the temple to the Capitoline Triad, stood a considerable number of altars. The number of identifiable dedications had already passed thirty by the time of publication of Jobsťs monograph in 1978. 40 The dedications are all to a particular form of Jupiter Optimus Maximus, abbreviated JOMK. Five of the fragmentary inscriptions refer to a particular day - III Id. Juniis.41 The earliest in date bears the same consular date as the dedicatory plaque found near the monument to Marcus - that is, 172. 42 The others, except for one inscription, which is too fragmentary for the consulate to be restored, date from the period of the Tetrarchy and the early Fourth Century. 782 is in an extremely poor state of preservation. Both Jobst and the editors of Année Epigraphique read Di[ocletian]o II.43 But there are problems with such a restoration. There appears to be room for only three or four letters on the stone. There is absolutely no space on the stone for «DN», or any other such abbrevia- tion; nor is there any room for «Aug.» following the name. This would have been Diocletian's first imperial consulate since he was proclaimed on March 7, 285. 44 His colleague in the second consulate was T. CI. Aurelius Aristobulus. It seems impossible to me that no stress would be given to his imperial status in this, his first consulate as emperor. Therefore, the identification of the consul of this inscription with Diocletian is very unlikely. This is reinforced by 783 which carries a regular titulature. Unfortunately, I can suggest no alternative. The latest inscription is of the early Fourth Century and must date to 313. It reads: [- ]/ mag[istr]o m[- /I]II idus Iun(ias) d(omino)/ [n(ostro)] / Constant( ) III Au[ - co(n)s(ulibus)]. Jobst restores it as if a second consul were mentioned. Therefore, this date can be either the second consulate of Constantine in 3 1 3 or that of his son, Constantius, in 342. 45 There is clearly no room on the stone for another name.46 Between April and circa August, Constantine is 40 W.

Though Licinus' territory included Carnuntum, this inscription may well represent the same phenomenon.47 The extant dedications, though small in number, appear to cluster in two groups: one under Marcus; the other under the Tetrarchy. The prominence of Jupiter in the second group is in accord with Diocletian's stress on his descent from Jupiter and the general religious ideology of the Tetrarchy.48 Nor should the dedication to Constantine occasion surprise when a panegyrist, in the same year, compares the emperor to the god who sends his thunderbolts as messengers of both happy and sad tidings.49 The dedications under Marcus (which at present appear to be the earliest) need further explanation. In eight of twenty-four cases, the normal formula of dedication to J(upiter) O(ptimus) M(aximus) is further qualified by the addition of a K.50 In addition, the remains of a free-standing statue (which Jobst identifies with Jupiter) can be connected with these dedications. The head appears to be a fairly typical Jupiter type, with a strongly stressed crown of hair, a prominent beard with double curls on the chin, and an upwardly directed gaze. 51 A three- pointed iron shaft decorated with lead was found near the head. It fit a socket in the crown of the head.52 In addition, the right and left hands were found - the right holding a globe and the left, a sceptre.53 Though the statue is fairly typical in most respects and the sceptre is a normal attribute of Jupiter, two elements are strikingly unusual: the globe in the right hand and the trident-like metallic insert in the skull. 54 The globe raises some important problems. It had been appropriated as a symbol of the emperor's authority as world ruler. Its connection 47 T.D. Barnes, op. cit . (n.44), p. 95. 48 W.

It is not clear from Jobst's description why the statue is restored in a standing position. 54 I agree with W. Jobst, loc. cit. (n.25), p. 716 that this has nothing to do with a meniskos.</page><page sequence="9">MARCUS AURELIUS AND «ZEUS KASIOS» AT CARNUNTUM 1 59 with Jupiter also appears to be of Roman origin.55 But the number of representations of the emperor with this attribute far exceeds those of Jupiter. The type which our statue displays (with globe in hand) is almost exclusively found on money. It occurs in both standing and sitting versions. The sceptre or lance often appears as a second attribute, as in this example. 56 The globe is also used in conjunction with abstractions like Italia, Fides Militum, and Securitas which has strong imperial associations.57 Thus, the use of the globe with this statue can be seen as establishing a special link between the emperor and Jupiter in a singular and unusual manner. The trident-shaped skull attachment is harder to place and raises the question of the identification of the form of Jupiter which is further complicated by the previously unattested dedications to JOMK. There is no parallel in the Danubian area for such an attribute. In general, little is known about native Illyrian and Celtic gods in this area. Structures for worship appear to all be of Roman date.58 Traces of pre-Roman religion appear in proportion of dedications to deities like Silvanus and Diana and in the appearance of certain appar- ently Pannonian divinities such as Aecorna, Riodiaspe, and Didone as well as the Matres Pannoniorum.59 The almost total adoption of the local gods through an «interpretado Romana» makes the attempt to evaluate unusual attributes extraordinarily difficult. Jupiter, himself, presents a particular problem. He is easily the most honored god in the Pannonian provinces, though at Carnuntum, Silvanus (in his various forms) takes pride of place.60 Most of the dedications, however, are 55 A. Schlachter, Der Globus: Seine Entstehung und Verwendung in der Antike (ed. F. Gisinger), Berlin 1927, p. 93. For the representation of the emperor as Jupiter, see H.G. Niemeyer, Studien zur statuerischen Darstellung der römischen Kaiser ( Monumenta Artis Romanae , 7), Berlin 1968, p. 59-60. 56 A. Schlachter, op. cit. (n.55), p. 94. On the coinage of Marcus, the globe appears with normal frequency. Marcus is twice portrayed holding a globe on the coinage of his first year, i.e. BMC IV, no. 24 (denarius); 846 (dupondius). 57 See for example, BMC IV, nos. 721, 761, and 1 149. 58 Although the editors of A E 1982, p. 207 take «leuga», a Celtic unit of measurement known in the Tres Galliae since Trajan, as an indication that the Pfaffenburg had originally been the home of a Celtic god of heights, there is absolutely no trace of pre-Roman remains on the site.

Both Roman and Eastern forms of Jupiter are found.61 At Carnuntum, dedications to Jupiter Optimus Maximus are the most frequent. Eastern versions of Jupiter, including Dolichenus, Heliopolitanus, and Tavianus also appear, as well as dedications linking Jupiter either with a specific god or in company with all the gods and goddesses.62 Of these, Dolichenus is by far the most frequent, particu- larly in dedications connected with the military. Neither the Roman forms nor any of the eastern versions of Jupiter offer any suggestion in their iconography of a trident-like attachment to the skull, though various forms of Jupiter are often represented holding the traditional thunderbolt.63 The apparent significance of the trident appears to be its symbolization of the lightning.64 The sculptor may have decided to portray lightning as an attribute in this form on the basis of two considerations. First, both of the statue's hands grasp symbols of sovereignty and that is clearly the main thrust of the representation. Second, the sculptor may have been influenced in his positioning of the symbol of the lightning by the tendency in eastern forms of Zeus to crown the figure with a representational attribute.65 Though parallels may be adduced, the problem of identity and the significance of this deity are not immediately apparent. Since he appears to be a form of Jupiter, it is tempting to equate the statue with the special form of Jupiter Optimus Maximus, signalled by the unusual abbreviation JOMK. But following normal grammatical rules, one would expect the letter following the K to be an «A».66 Thus, Kapitoli- nus immediately suggests itself. But K is in fact never used in this 61 A. MÓCSY, loc. cit. (n.60), col. 728 presents a list of the most common epithets of Jupiter found in the dedications. 62 E. Swoboda, op. cit. (n.29), p. 184. A Jupiter O. M.

Cook, Zeus, A Study in Ancient Religion II, Cambridge 1925, p. 786-798 convincingly argues that the trident of Poseidon was originally a lightning symbol and the equivalent of the thunderbolt of Zeus. His figure 766 reproduces a deity from the Augustan house near the Villa Farnesina which may be a representation of Jupiter with a trident. 65 So the modius usually shown on the head of Serapls.

Most of all, it would be a way of linking Hadrian's lightning wonder with Marcus' similar experience.70 But there are serious objections to such an identification. The sole notice of Hadrian's experience on Möns Casius near Seleucia Pieria appears in the Historia Augusta.11 It claims that while Hadrian was at Antioch, he ascended Möns Casius to view the rising sun. A storm arose which killed both the victims of an impending sacrifice as well as the priest in charge of the sacrifice.72 The ancient Möns Casius (which should be identified with the modern Jebl el Akm) stands 5318 feet high. The ancients claimed that it was possible to see the sun rise during the last quarter of the night while the surrounding land was still in darkness.73 The Historia Augusta apparently places the event during Hadrian's second journey to the East. He journeyed from Athens, by way of Syria, and was in Egypt before the end of August, 130. 74 During this journey, Hadrian is attested in Antioch in June, 129. It was 67 CIL VIII 6981; ILS 1066, 1102, 1191, 2103, 4291a.

The notice comes within a series of measures that Hadrian had taken and difficulties which he had experi- enced at Antioch in this year. It has recently been persuasively argued that the material on Hadrian's Antiochene sojourn in 129/130 derives in part from additions to the HA' s main source - that is, from Marius Maximus.75 The immediate proximity of the Lightning Miracle, as well as the fact that the report of the miracle in the Vita Marci is a palpable addition to the main source, appears to point to Marius Maximus as the author of this notice as well (thereby illustrating one of that author's predilections). Dio reports a miraculous dream which Hadrian had, but dates it immediately before the start of his reign. According to Dio, Hadrian dreamed that a fire descended from heaven (although the sky was perfectly clear), fell on the left side of his throat and then passed to the right side without doing harm. No connection with Zeus Kasios is mentioned and the event presumably took place at the governor's residence at Antioch. 76 Though it cannot be resolved with any certainty, the two incidents do not appear to be doublets of each other. Whereas the first has obvious implications for Hadrian's difficult position at his accession and could serve as a support for his imperial claims, the second performs no such function. Their patterns are different enough to justify their being seen as two separate incidents. There is a parallel as well with the miracles under Marcus. Just as the Lightning Miracle is omitted by Dio, so the miracle on Möns Casius is also excluded. In both cases, they owe their inclusion in the Historia Augusta to the interests of an author used as a subsidiary source, Marius Maximus.77 The god who vouchsafed this miracle to Hadrian appears to have originally been of Hittite origin.78 His two most famous centers of cult were on the Möns Casius (already mentioned) near Seleucia Pieria and 75 R.

It typically shows what may be the sacred stone of the god itself in a shrine with four pillars and a pyramidal roof. An eagle surmounts the roof.82 It may well be that Zeus Kasios was aniconic. There is no evidence of a cult statue. Hadrian's epigram to accompany the dedication to god by Trajan in 1 13 probably used the freedom accorded by this to conceive of Kasios in the classical shape of Zeus.83 Hadrian's experience at this time on Möns Casius must have made an impression on him for it was probably on his entry to Egypt in 120 that he founded or restored a temple of Zeus Kasios in Pelusium itself. 84 In his Egyptian manifestation, Zeus Kasios had come to be identified with the young Horus, that is Harpokrates.85 The equation of the young Horus with the Kasian Zeus is difficult to understand. But it seems that at least in the Fourth Century, there was a connection between Zeus Kasios and the sun.86 However, in his role as the young sun, Harpokrates, Horus also combined aspects of the god of fertility. He was a provider of bread and agricultural sustenance.87 The celebra- 79 The cult at Pelusium was probably derived from Syrians resident in the area. See A.

Zeus Kasios is never given the thunderbolt as an attribute on the city's coinage. But on occasion, he was credited with its use. See Libanius, Orat. 11.116. 83 Anth. Pal. 6.332 in suitably Homeric language. 84 For an improved version of the inscription, see A. Salač, loc. cit. (n.79), p. 166-167. Salač believes that Hadrian built the temple but two arguments from silence tell against this conclusion. First, there is no evidence of it on Hadrian's Alexandrine coinage; and second, the cult statue is already recorded on the coinage of Trajan. It can be convincingly argued that this was the cult statue at Egyptian Möns Casius. See C. Bonner, Harpokrates (Zeus Kasios) of Pelusium, Hesperia 15 (1946), p. 58. 85 On Harpokrates, see W. Helck and E. Otto (edd.), Lexikon der Aegyptologie II (1977), col. 1003-1007. 86 So A. Salač, loc. cit. (n.79), p. 178 citing Julian, Misopogon 361.

This representation is borne out by coinage and gem representa- tions. Though there are variations in the representations of Harpokrates of Pelusium, three attributes of importance appear on the coinage: the pomegranate in the god's right hand; a staff in his left hand; and a hem- hem crown.92 These attributes all appear together on the coins of Trajan.93 The pomegranate presumably refers to the god's function in fertility.94 Most important for us is the hem-hem crown which is associated with Horus in his various manifestations. It is a symbol of cosmic power and world rule. The crown itself is a composite, essentially a triple-atef crown. It is composed of joined plant stems, feathers (usually from the ostrich), horns of goats or cows, sun disks, and uraei.95 Thus, the identification proposed between Zeus Kasios and the statue at Carnuntum seems impossible. Features that appear to link the two lose their identity on closer inspection. The globe dissolves into a pomegranate and the lightning symbol into a hem-hem crown. The age difference between the two deities also tells against identification.96 88 Strabo XVI 2.5.

(n.24), p. 33 recognizes the age difference between the Carnuntum figure and Zeus Kasios of Pelusium, but ascribes the differences as being due to the influence of Jupiter Dolichenus. This is a device equally invoked to explain the difference in attributes. But there then remains literally nothing to associate the two and which is supported by no other evidence.</page><page sequence="15">MARCUS AURELIUS AND «ZEUS KASIOS» AT CARNUNTUM 1 65 There are traces of the extensive diffusion of Egyptian deities in the Danubian area, including Carnuntum.97 There may even be traces of a cult group of Zeus Kasios in the Dobrudja, though the evidence is tenuous.98 But in the middle Danube, no trace of this deity has been found. Hadrian appears to have made no attempt to propagate this form of Zeus/Jupiter, whatever the significance of the miracle was for him personally. It is inherently unlikely that Marcus made any specific reference to Hadrian in his celebration of the miracle. The context was totally different and another emperor offered an obvious parallel and the obvious advantage of an unassailable reputation as a conqueror. The coinage of 172-173 that can be associated with the Lightning Miracle is problematic. It seems likely the Providentia Deorum series of bronze of 172 refers to the aid of the gods on this occasion.99 More clearly associated with the miracle is an aureus of 172 on which the emperor is portrayed in military costume holding a thunderbolt in his right hand and a reversed spear in his left. He is being crowned by Victory who holds a palm.100 This is a startlingly unusual issue for Marcus and has long been recognized as an allusion to the Lightning Miracle. The type recalls coins already issued for Trajan.101 The natural inference from the coin type is the transference of Jupiter's powers to the emperor who now (as the king of gods) wields the thunderbolt. This type also recalls the Arch of Beneventum where, on the southwest attic, Jupiter offers his thunderbolt to the triumphing Trajan.102 The most striking correspondence is the most obvious of all. No one questions that the column of Marcus is inspired by the column of 97 M. Malaise, La diffusion des cultes égyptiens dans les provinces européennes de l'empire romain , in ANRW II 17.3, Berlin - New York 1984, p. 1615-1691.

Two elements are juxtaposed in a striking way. A Victory writing on a scroll symbolizes the end of the First Dacian War on Trajan's monument.104 The same representation reappears on Marcus' column in the same location. But here it marks no real break. Its placement owes more to the earlier monument than to its historical significance for Marcus' wars. 105 Even more striking and at the same point as the Rain Miracle on Marcus' column, a great battle scene appears on the Trajan column. In the scene, Jupiter Tonans comes to the aid of the Roman forces at Tapae with his lightning. It is a possible reference to a miraculous thunderstorm which intervened at a critical moment.106 The placement of these scenes and the relations that they indicate between Marcus and Trajan (as well as the coin types) suggest what one would, a priori, expect. The model for Marcus was not Hadrian, but the Optimus Princeps victorious, on the Danube. 107 The aureus of 172 presumably reflects Marcus' own concep- tion about the use of Trajanic forms to advertise his victory. How far the column immediately reflects his own thought is less clear. The only ancient evidence (which is of little worth) dates its commencement after his death.108 But whether its inspiration was Marcus' or not, it shows that Trajan would have been the natural model.109 Thus, there is no basis for seeing any connection between Marcus and 103 On these, see M. Wegner, Die kunstgeschichtliche Stellung der Marcussäule, JDAI 46 (1931), p. 61-174. 104 K. Lehmann-Hartleben, Die Trajanssäule, Berlin and Leipzig 1926, Taf. LXVIII and E.

Caprino, La colonna di Marco Aurelio , Rome 1955, who argue that it does mark a real separation, it is not the sequence of the scenes, but the victory itself that persuades them. 106 R. Vulpe, Fulgenul lui Jupiter de la Tapae, Apulum 9 (1971), p. 571-588 bases his interpretation purely on the column. There is no literary evidence for it. 107 If the Lightning Miracle and the Rain Miracle owe their placement on the column to the position of analogous scenes on the column of Trajan, then there is no possibility of establishing the chronological order of the scenes on the column of Marcus since these are only scenes that have any possibility of being dated. 108 Aurelius Victor 16.15; Epit. de Caesaribus 16.14. The only definite date is supplied by CIL VI 1585 which shows that the column was in existence by the reign of Septimius Severus. 109 On the fame of Trajan in Late Antiquity, see R.

The problem of the meaning of the epithet abbreviated by K remains. Clearly the most reasonable solution is the obvious one. K must be an abbreviation for Karnuntinus. K is often used as an abbreviation for the town or for adjectival forms derived from it. 1 10 In one instance it is used in conjunction with a deity. 1 1 1 This identification makes the representation of the deity all the more sig- nificant. The practice of using an epithet derived from a place name, though common for Eastern gods (such as Jupiter Tavianus or Doliche- nus), is almost unattested in the Danubian provinces, except for Jupiter Olbiopolitanus. The close identification with the emperor (through the use of the globe) shows that Marcus was concerned to use the incident as means of supporting and strengthening the morale of his army after the defeats of his first two years of war. It can be no accident that the coinage of 170-171 is marked by the repetition of the legend «Fides Exerci tum». 112 The unusual attributes of the god as well as his name would be strong evocation of divine support for the emperor and his army now that they had entered the offensive phase of the war. 1 1 3 If the statue and the dedications to JOMK referred to both the Lightning Miracle and the Rain Miracle, they can provide a final solution to the chronological problems that both of these events present. The Lightning Miracle has been commonly dated to 172 on the basis of the coinage and the position of its depiction on the column. The Rain Miracle has been dated either to the summer of that year or to that of 173. The evidence before the discoveries at Carnuntum allow no greater precision. If the cult was begun in Carnuntum as a commemoration of both miracles, a firm terminus ante quem would be provided.114 The crucial question is: Did Marcus ascribe the miracle to Jupiter as well as to other gods, in particular Hermes Aerios? The evidence for an inscription to Jupiter is not strong. The earliest mention of this version 1 10 W. Jobst, op. cit. (n.24), p. 31 makes the suggestion himself only to reject it. See his note 89 which lists inscriptional uses of the abbreviation. 111 See for example CIL III 12464. 112 BMC IV, nos. 1395-1397, 1406. 1 13 W. Jobst, loc. cit. (n.25), p. 718 n. 36. He restored CIL III 3347 from Alba Regia, a dedication on behalf of Marcus, Commodus and the ordo Aquincensis dated June 11, 172, as dedicated to JOMK. Op. cit. (n.24), p. 28, he developed the notion of a province-wide cult. But in n. 107, he cites an inscription from the vicinity of Leon which is dated to June 11, 163. Thus, without further evidence, it is more reasonable to assume that the inscription from Alba Regia's agreement in date is due to chance. 114 So W. Jobst, op. cit. (n.24), p. 12ff.</page><page sequence="18">168 M.M.SAGE occurs in Tertulliano Ad Scapulam of 212. In the Apologeticum , Tertul- lian dealt with the same incident; but there, only the prayers of Christian soldiers were cited as the cause.115 In Ad Scapulam , Tertullian repeats that it was the efficacy of Christian prayers that saved the situation, and adds that, «Tune et populus acclamans Deo Deorum, in Iovis nomine Deo nostro testimonium reddidit.»116 But, as has been pointed out by others, Christian Apologists have a tendency to use pagan symbols and deities in ways which will further their arguments.117 It does not inspire confidence that the remark follows a claim that Commodus was edu- cated as a Christian by his nurse. 118 Given this typical turn of apologetic argument, it becomes clear that once Tertullian had made the claim that Marcus recognized that the event was due to the prayers of Christians (and therefore to the Christian God), he would be drawn to make the equation with Jupiter (which is the centerpiece of the passage). 119 Thus, Tertulliano statement carries no independent worth. The other piece of literary evidence which cites Jupiter (in this case, specifically Jupiter Tonans) is the Panegyricus De Sexto Consulatu Honori of Claudian.120 Though Claudian is aware of other versions of the cause of the miracle, he ascribes it to the character of Marcus who merited «omne Tonantis/obsequium...». 121 Claudian's account focuses on the destructive effects of the lightning rather than the saving effects of the rain. It is this bias in his account, as well as his distance in time, which leads him to cite Jupiter as the agent of the miracle. Another stand in the tradition led him in the same direction - the stress on the miracle an indication of Marcus' character. The miracle has become an exemplum of the rewards a good emperor can obtain. 122 In fact, it is 115 5.6. 116 4.6. 117 See the illuminating remarks on this topic by J. Geffcken, Das Regenwunder im Quadenlande, NJA 2 (1896), p. 261. 118 4.5. 1 19 As was pointed out eons ago by J.B. Lightfoot, The Apostolic Fathers I 2, London 1 889 2, p. 489 the Latin of Tertullian does not imply that he had actually seen the letter of Marcus. He clearly depends on second-hand information, perhaps Apollonarius. 120 340-350. 121 The reference here to the «Carmina Chaldaea» must be linked to a version of the Rain Miracle which appears in the Suda. The Suda ascribes the miracle to Julianus the son of Julianus who is probably the author of the Chaldaean Oracles in their original form. See J. Kroll, art. Iulianos , in RE X 1 (1917), col. 15-17. 122 The same viewpoint is evident in Themistius, Orat. 15.191b and 35.21, though in his</page><page sequence="19">MARCUS AURELIUS AND «ZEUS KASIOS» AT CARNUNTUM 1 69 clear that both on the Christian and pagan sides, the miracle obtained its importance because of its connection with Marcus and with Marcus' particular reputation. This stand clearly impelled Claudian (and proba- bly earlier sources) to make the equation with Jupiter once the emperor's presence was assumed. Orac. Sib. xii 199 appears to make an indefinite reference to Zeus. It claims that the Romans were saved on account of the Eusebeia of their emperor whom «õ 0sòç oòpávioç» obeyed. Again, the same pattern is repeated. The merits of the emperor induce their reward from the king of gods. The pagan versions of the event thus appear to introduce Jupiter as a reflection of the involvement of the emperor. Whatever their source, there is no reason to assume that they reflect the contemporary view of the matter. The column offers no aid here. The rain is represented in the form of an allegorical figure who bears a strong resemblance to Notus in Ovid's Metamorphoses . 123 This may in part be due to stylistic convention. In both miracles, there is a reluctance to portray anthropomorphic divini- ties in contrast to the column of Trajan. 124 The representation certainly bears no relationship to any known representation of Jupiter or to that of the other Olympians. A final piece of evidence is a medallion of 173 which represents Jupiter in a quadriga facing right and hurling a thunderbolt at a prostrate foe. This recalls a medallion of Pius issued in 157. 125 The reference of the medallion of Marcus is not clear. It can be taken either as referring to the Lightning Miracle or to the Rain Miracle. Both points of view have been taken.126 Its date seems rather late to refer to the Lightning Miracle and chronologically it would best suit the Rain Miracle. But the medallion need not have any such specific reference. None has been found for its antecedent model under Pius. It may well have a wider significance, symbolizing the generalized notion of Roman victory over the barbarian forces of chaos. In the Pian medallion, it version the emperor is Pius. But he seems to have reversed the order of their reigns. See 17.215a, 19.229b. 123 1.264ff. First suggested by E. Petersen, Das Wunder an der Columna M. Aurelii , RM (1894), p. 87. 124 P.G.

Rubin, Weather Miracles under Marcus Aurelius, Athenaeum N.S. 57 (1979), p. 377 argues that the absence of rain on the medallion indicates that it represents the earlier miracle. J. Guey, Encore 'La Pluie Miraculeuse', RPh 3e ser. 22 (1948), p. 357 ascribes it to the Rain Miracle through the passage in the Ad Scapulam cited above.</page><page sequence="20">170 M.M.SAGE appears that the figure struck is a giant symbolizing chaos. The referent for the medallion of Marcus may well be the same. It also recalls the general type of Jupiter Propugnator which occurs as a variant on a sestertius of Marcus' second issue as IMP Villi in 176-177 with the legend «propugnatori imp viiii cos iii pp sc». 127 The type was to become frequent from the Severi on.128 Here, clearly there is no reference to a specific miracle, but a general reference to the granting of Imp VIII. The medallion can in no way serve as an argument for the particular identification of the god responsible for the miracle as Jupiter. The reference to Hermes Aerios on the coinage and in Dio's account as the deity who (along with others) was responsible for the Rain Miracle tells against any immediate identification with Jupiter as author of the Rain Miracle.129 Marcus is commonly characterized as a tradi- tionalist in religious matters. 130 But it appears that under pressure of acute stress, he was willing to enlarge his religious horizons. So, in 167, Marcus (perhaps under pressure from public opinion) summoned foreign priests to Rome and had them perform their ceremonies in an attempt to cleanse the empire of the plague that Verus' soldiers had brought back from the East. 131 It was perhaps in this context that Arnuphis (the priest who brought about the Rain Miracle) arrived in Rome. 132 Marcus was sensitive and scrupulous about religious matters, sharing the common attitude toward the efficacy of the supernatural. 133 It was this same combination of traditionalism as well as a certain readiness to cross boundaries that marks the account of Dio lxxi 8 and the coinage with Mercury. This is a clear indication that this was the initial and 127 BMC IV, no. 1637. 128 M.

It is significant that the identification of Toth with Shou took place through a link with an intermediary god, Chons, whose warlike functions make him particularly appropriate in the context of the miracle. See A. Rusch, in RE VI A 1 (1936), col. 381.

Dio (our best source for the miracle) clearly states that the enemy the Romans faced were the Quadi.136 This campaign, as has been argued above, belongs to 173. The only way out of this conclusion is to follow the suggestion of A. Birley.137 He adopts the original reading of the forged letter of Marcus at the end of Justin's first apology which is Kotinoi.138 Birley argues that the letter preserves an authentic tradition that the miracle took place among the Cotini and not the Quadi.139 Though the letter contains what appears to be genuine information (mixed with a great deal of exaggeration and Christian apologia), its most likely source for historical material is Dio, as Mommsen argued long ago.140 That the event may have been localized by Dio in the territory of the Cotini is a possibility as Xiphilinus tends to be haphazardly selective in his epito- mization of Dio.141 However, in Dio the battle is clearly against the Quadi and not the Cotini. Thus, it is probable that the event belongs to 173 and not 172. 142 On the grounds of the available evidence, the dedication at Car- nuntum which continued over several centuries had its origin in the Lightning Miracle. Its discovery most importantly provides us with a terminus ante quem for the Lightning Miracle, though the dates of the original dedication must surely be the dedication of the statue and not that of the miracle. It makes clear that Marcus, under the pressure first 134 The coinage legend «Religio Augusti» gives it added point. 135 W. Jobst, op. cit. (n.24), p. 15-16 is far too ready to allow the mixing of official and Egyptian religion in this case. 136 Dio LXXI 8 and 10.
