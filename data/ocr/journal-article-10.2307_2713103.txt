AMERICAN ANTICOMMUNISM HAS BEEN, BY ANY MEASURE, ONE OF THE GREAT forces of the twentieth century, debated, denounced, defended, defamed.I Like Communism, it is catnip to the kind of writer who comes to history with answers in search of questions. Rare is the historian who can approach this emotionally charged topic "without hate, without bitterness, without fear, without protest, without preaching," to use Virginia Woolf's formula.2 Richard Gid Powers teaches history at CUNY and is the author of Secrecy and Power, a biography of J. Edgar Hoover, and G-Men, a study of the FBI in popular culture. He is working on a history of American anticommunism. 714</page><page sequence="2">ANTICOMMUNIST LIVES 715 Now, as individuals prominent in the anticommunist movement reflect auto- biographically on their lives or deposit their papers in archives, and as biographers, driven by related impulses, try to understand the careers of key anticommunists, historians can scrape away some of the polemical gloss that has accumulated over the historical record. The most recent crop of biographies and autobiographies suggests some of the social and intellectual range of the anticommunist movement, and the variety of motives that energized anticommunist activists. * * * J. Edgar Hoover is a pivotal figure in any discussion of American anticom- munism, shaper as well as symptom of the movement. He entered government service in 1917 when the study of American anticommunism properly begins, made his first real mark on American politics in 1919, the first and most exuberant year of the Comintern, and died in 1972, the year of Nixon's China trip, which, if it was not conclusively the end of the anticommunist movement, was at least the end of something. Hoover always claimed he became an anticommunist because of what he learned during the summer of 1919 when he planned the round-ups of alien Communists known as the Palmer Raids (November 1919-January 1920). But Athan Theoharis and John Stuart Cox, authors of the most recent biography of Hoover, will have none of this. Convinced that anticommunism has no redeeming features, Theoharis and Cox treat Hoover as a pathological specimen whose life reveals nothing except the cultural dementia of American society. For them anticommunism was a mask of deceit Hoover used in an insane quest for power and revenge against the enemies his feverish imagination held responsible for his pathetic and hollow existence. There is no effort to understand the needs and motives of Hoover's constituency in the anticommunist and law enforcement community that looked to him for leadership. Cox and Theoharis deride Hoover's reports on crime and Communist infiltration; they fail to examine the reality behind the reports, evidently because they regard criminals and Communists as little more than Hooverian hallucinations. But while Hoover's words certainly should not be accepted uncritically, neither should they be unthinkingly rejected. Hoover lived out his career at the very center of the action, the "bloody crossroads" of American life, and so he was not simply giving vent to idiosyncratic frustrations in his speeches, books, and articles; he spoke for millions, and the popularity that was the real source of his power proves that those millions believed he was fighting their battles in his crusades against crime and Communism. By refusing to understand political acts as responses to real events, Theoharis and Cox deprive themselves of any theory of cultural dynamics and have to grope for farfetched anthropomorphic metaphors to make sense out of historical pro- cesses: in the 1920s "America regrouped around the collective consciousness of</page><page sequence="3">716 AMERICAN QUARTERLY aft earlier era"; the Senate investigated the Teapot Dome Scandal because "the country's immune system had begun to react"; on the eve of JFK's assassination, "the nation appeared poised to break the resistance to integration in the South" (78, 343). Because Theoharis and Cox approach their subject with answers in hand, they do not think it worth the trouble to shift their gaze to the world outside the FBI files they mine so tediously for evidence of FBI denseness and deviltry. Their book is riddled with factual errors that reveal an ignorance of Hoover's life and times. Barry Goldwater was not a "Jew (turned Episcopalian)" (296). His mother was a Protestant and raised him in that faith. They mistakenly claim that Dillinger "at no time, then or later, committed a known capital offense" (123). He committed at least one murder and was an accomplice in two others. They know Evalyn McLean, one of the capital's wealthiest and best-known socialites, only as a "Washington housewife" (76). They should know that the Nixon-Mundt bill would not have outlawed the Communist party, having been carefully drafted to stop short of that to deprive Communists of an absolute Fifth Amendment privilege (249). Since The Boss refuses to take seriously the explanations Hoover offered for his anticommunism, the authors are forced to resort to potted popular psychology, serving up large undigested chunks of Adorno's Authoritarian Personality and Adolf Berle's Power like undergraduates cutting and pasting together a term paper. On the weakest of anecdotal evidence they maintain that Hoover had phobias about snakes and germs, and they use this to buttress their bizarre theory that Hoover had an irrational fear of outside infiltration, that his anticommunism was "germ phobic" (26, 327). This is the Ann Landers school of historiography. But there is no need for off-the-shelf psychobiography in Hoover's case. Hoover was a common American type; his upbringing in a middle-class Protestant enclave of Washington, his training in the elite public schools and the Protestant youth groups of the capital at the turn of the century fostered in him a conscious sense of belonging to an elite charged with maintaining and guarding the traditions of WASP America against the onslaughts of radicalism and modernism. This com- bination of middle-class Protestant moralism with faith in education, science and technology marks him as a conservative cousin to the progressive reformer, relying on scientific public administration to stabilize society. When he was given the responsibility of devising programs to deal with an expanding international Com- munist movement in 1919, his background made him particularly sensitive to Communism's potential for subverting patriotism and religion ("Americanism") and the institutions that were the bulwarks of the America of the Protestant middle class: family, church and school. Anxious about the stability of these institutions, Protestant "countersubversives" like Hoover were suspicious of fellow traveling clergy, educators, intellectuals, artists, and youth leaders. Based on his background and beliefs, Hoover should be grouped with WASP</page><page sequence="4">ANTICOMMUNIST LIVES 717 anticommunists like Hamilton Fish, Ralph Easley of the National Civic Federation, Martin Dies and his research director, J. B. Matthews, and, of course, Richard M. Nixon. Once the genus and species of Hoover's anticommunism are accurately identified, his covert activities and his public role, for good and ill, reflect an inner psychological and intellectual consistency that ties together his anticom- munism, his racism, and his anticrime policies. Given the times, Hoover was the inevitable man. * * * Sidney Hook was not simply or exclusively an anticommunist. He was a disciple of Bertrand Russell and John Dewey. He wrote the first major American study of Marxism and figured in most of the major philosophical and educational debates of the past half century, but the dominant theme of his life was anticommunism. His memoir, Out of Step, is valuable for the light it sheds on the motivations of the anticommunist Jewish intellectual, and as a corrective to the recent flood of books celebrating or denouncing the New York anticommunist left.3 Hook was a fellow traveler until 1932. But when Hitler came to power and the Communists failed to overthrow him, leaving the Jews at the mercy of the Nazis, Hook began to doubt their honesty. When William Z. Foster published Toward Soviet America in 1932, Hook made the "horrifying and embarrassing discovery" (185) that the American Communist party he had been supporting was not, as it claimed, a democratic political party; it had been completely Bolshevized. "Here openly revealed was the true face of Communism" (186). His discovery of Communist duplicity was especially shocking to Hook because he had begun to suspect that the Communists had been lying to him. To someone as fervently, I should say fanatically, devoted to the truth as Hook, the revelation of their dishonesty shook his intellectual world. Breaking with Communism was therefore essential to Hook's continued activity as a philosopher. During the Cold War Hook opposed McCarthy for the same reason he fought the Communists: McCarthy did not tell the truth. He called McCarthy "a boon to the Communists and a bane to genuinely liberal anticommunists" (422). Hook's memoirs are crucial evidence about the motivation of left anticommunists in the early cold war period: Although Communism as a world movement dominated and controlled by the Kremlin was a danger to America rather than in America, the agents and partisans of that movement, who had infiltrated strategic positions in government, trade unions, ed- ucational establishments, and centers for influencing public opinion, had to be exposed and opposed. After all, the leaders of the Communist party had publicly proclaimed that in the event of war between the United States and the Soviet Union, they would not support the United States. This gave rise to legitimate fears concerning the loyalty of those who knowingly followed the Communist party line in other fields of social and cultural activity. (421)</page><page sequence="5">718 AMERICAN QUARTERLY The most important achievement of the Congress for Cultural Freedom (which he was instrumental in creating) was combatting "the virus of neutralism that was spiritually disarming the West against Communist aggression" (440). Sidney Hook's anticommunism derived from his commitment to intellectual freedom, which he saw as viable only in a free society. But for all Hook's formidable individualism, he did see himself as a member of a community threatened by Communism: the intellectual community which he saw as inseparable from a free international intellectual culture. Inasmuch as that community in New York was largely Jewish, Hook's ethnic background was definitely a factor in determining his anticommunism, though clearly it was much less important than for conservative Jewish anticommunists like Eugene Lyons, Isaac Don Levine, Roy Cohn, and George Sokolsky. These right-wing Jewish anticommunists tended to concentrate primarily on Jewish Communists, whom they saw as a threat to the safety of the American Jewish community because of the ammunition they furnished anti- Semites, and secondarily on Soviet Communism as a danger to Jews in the Soviet Union and, indirectly, to Israel. Like Hoover, then, Hook's vision of Communism was colored by the concerns of the community to which he belonged, but his different background and experience made him sensitive to different Communist activities than those that alarmed the FBI director. * * * Stephen E. Ambrose's biography of Nixon, which carries the story to 1962, is in some ways even better than his Eisenhower series. Ambrose describes the forces that shaped Nixon's personality so sensitively and comprehensively that in the end the reader feels he has been given all information needed to understand the motives for the decisions that shaped the nation and the world and that in the end brought Nixon down. Where, specifically, did Nixon's anticommunism begin? Pace the psychobiog- raphers, its roots were not traumatic childhood experiences or deprivations. "He grew up in an atmosphere of security, surrounded by love.... His father frightened him sometimes, appalled him at others, but he never had cause to doubt [his father's] love or protection" (30). But early in Nixon's political education we see signs of the "countersubversive" anticommunism typical of old-stock American conservatives: alarm over the penetration of American institutions by Communists promoting a radical political and economic agenda. After his discharge from the Navy, Nixon threw himself into a slashing contest for Jerry Voorhis's Twelfth Congressional District in California, east of Los An- geles. The national theme for the Republican party that year was "Communists in government." After its long exile from power, the GOP was desperate; it believed that the CIO was taking over the Democratic party, and that liberals like Voorhis who had let radicals into the government and the unions were even more dangerous</page><page sequence="6">ANTICOMMUNIST LIVES 719 than the Communists. Nixon did not need to be convinced. His prewar experience in Washington at the Office of Price Administration (OPA) had been a "Road to Damascus experience" which convinced him that there were bureaucrats who were out to "get business" (103). Nixon came to Washington with a commitment to "smash the labor bosses ... my one principle [was] to accept no dictation from the CIO-PAC" (142). He then broadened his knowledge of the Communist issue by consulting with Father John Cronin, a Baltimore priest who had written a 1945 report on Communism for the Catholic bishops (based on FBI data). The report contained names of Communists working for the government: Alger Hiss's name appeared four times. Nixon learned even more about Communist infiltration when he helped HUAC interrogate Gerhard Eisler, probably the Comintern representative to the American party. "This was really the first time I had brought home to me the character of the Communist party and the threat which it presented to the country.... It was the beginning of my education in this field" (146). As Nixon's interest in foreign policy grew, his competitive instincts were aroused by the geopolitical challenge the Soviet Union posed to American power and Communism's doctrinal challenge to Americanism. Nixon was from the start one of the most outspoken Republican supporters of the Marshall Plan. He took a trip to France and Italy in 1947 and concluded that immediate and massive aid was necessary: "Otherwise we will be faced with the almost certain prospect of a United States standing virtually alone" (157). The more he learned about Com- munists the more they offended his conviction that patriotism was at the core of every moral personality: "The Communists throughout the world owe their loyalty not to the countries in which they live but in Russia" (156). Nixon was never so naive, Ambrose argues, as to think that the United States was threatened by a Communist take-over. What he did believe was that their influence on American opinion through front groups made it more difficult for the country to take measures to deter Soviet aggression, and that in the event of conflict with the Soviet Union, there was a danger of sabotage. As was the case with Hoover and Hook, Nixon's career shows the importance of the individual's identification with his community in an understanding of anti- communist motivation. Nixon's middle-class Protestant background disposed him to the same countersubversive view of Communism as J. Edgar Hoover, with the same characteristic suspicion of fellow travelers in the ranks of the traditional American leadership class: the "parlor pinks." Like Hoover, Nixon's early official responsibilities put him in a position to acquire special knowledge about Communist infiltration in the government and other fundamental institutions of WASP America. Unlike Hoover, however, Nixon acquired a broader understanding of Communism as an evolving force in world politics which eventually led him to abandon anti- communist orthodoxy, and, in the eyes of many true believers, to betray the movement.</page><page sequence="7">720 AMERICAN QUARTERLY * * * The story of William F. Buckley, Jr.'s anticommunism also underscores the point that anticommunism cannot be understood without reference to religion, race, and ethnicity. Black anticommunism, Protestant anticommunism, Catholic anticommunism, Jewish anticommunism are all intensely refracted by the angle of vision peculiar to each group. John B. Judis's fine new biography of Buckley describes Buckley's political beliefs emerging out of his family's history, a family which, though exceptionally well off, was by no means spiritually divorced from the common concerns of American Catholics. Buckley's father, William Sr., was an oil man who had gone to prerevolutionary Mexico in 1908 to make his pile, lost it in the 1911 Revolution, and, after fleeing Mexico in November 1921, struck it rich again in South America. During the Mexican Revolution, William Sr. collaborated with counterrevolutionary forces, tried to persuade Washington that Carranza was a Bolshevik, and helped organize an abortive coup in 1919. Like the Roman Catholic aristocrats in Reformation England the young Bill Buckley liked to read about in Belloc and Chesterton, William Sr. hid Mexican priests and nuns and helped them find their way to the United States. Out of his Mexican experience the elder Buckley taught his children "that he had seen in Mexico the first stage of a worldwide Communist revolution against capitalism and Christianity" (22). To the Buckley clan, Communism was "not merely a foreign ideology-like socialism or fascism-but a Satanic faith that threatened the soul of Western civilization .... It could invade the spirit of peoples unexpectedly and in disguise, as it had in Mexico" (27). For William F. Buckley, Jr. anticommunism was a family heritage, a duty owed out of loyalty to a heroic father, a way of striking back at those who had tried to lay his family low. Buckley and his brother-in-law L. Brent Bozell defended Joseph McCarthy against attacks on his aims and his methods. Here Buckley and the right-wing anticommunists were in the opposite camp from Sidney Hook. But Buckley's anticommunism was similar to Hook's in one regard: for both, the real danger of domestic Communism was that it might weaken the country's resolve to contain the world Communist movement. Both, too, had respect for the power of ideas: Judis writes that "Buckley believed that the intellectuals determined what people thought, and that the ideas of intellectuals shaped events rather than vice versa" (116). Buckley's anticommunism displays the distinctive concerns of the American Catholic community: hatred of Communism as an atheistic philosophy incompatible with the Catholic world view; anger over Communist persecution of the Church in Mexico, China, Spain, and Eastern Europe; and an intense resentment against liberalism and the New Deal for being insensitive to the concerns of American Catholics. In all this Buckley's attitudes are indistinguishable from those of other</page><page sequence="8">ANTICOMMUNIST LIVES 721 Catholic anticommunists like the Brooklyn Tablet's Patrick Scanlan and George- town University's Edmund Walsh. Given the fierce anticommunism of the Amer- ican Catholic Church, combined with the Catholic sense of grievance toward New Deal liberalism's domestic and foreign policies, it was almost predictable that somewhere in the country there would be an American Catholic waiting to do what McCarthy eventually did. Hoover, Hook, Buckley, and Nixon all joined the anticommunist crusade when the Communist party was a tangible force in American politics, and when Com- munism was on the march around the world. The collection of essays in Political Passages lets a new generation of "Big Chill" anticommunists tell how they got that way: how they emerged from the New Left political activism of the sixties and seventies into a neoconservatism that enlisted them in the old anticommunist cause. The thirteen confessions in Political Passages belong, like Hook's, to the tradition of reverse conversion narratives established years ago by Benjamin Git- low, Walter Krivitsky, Whittaker Chambers, Louis Budenz, Elizabeth Bentley, Bella Dodd, Hede Massing, and, of course, the God That Failed narratives of Arthur Koestler, Richard Wright, Louis Fischer, Ignazio Silone, Andre Gide, and Stephen Spender.4 And although half a century separates these newest conversions to anticommunism from those of Hoover, Hook, Nixon and Buckley, the pattern is the same: the revolutionary left is seen as a threat to values central to the specific community-ethnic, religious or racial-that remains the frame of reference for the anticommunist whether he has stayed within the community, has rejoined it, has left it behind or even, as in the case of Julius Lester, has been converted to it. Again conforming to the familiar pattern, the Political Passages writers turn against the left because they have come to see it as a threat to values-honesty, openness and tolerance-essential to the intellectual community they identify with (and which, like Hook, they see as an international culture of freedom). For the most part, of course, the Political Passages ex-radicals did not break with the Communist party; except in a few cases the Party was no longer available to join except as a quixotic gesture. Rather their disenchantment was with the "left," defined less as a coherent political movement than a complex of attitudes having as a least common denominator a reflexive opposition to the United States, its culture and its foreign policy, coupled with unquestioning support for the Third World's America- and Israel-bashing. Tending to see the political in psychological terms, they came to see belonging to the left as a form of self-hatred that had to be rejected as an essential step toward self-integration and political sanity. Leaving the left gave the ex-radicals of Political Passages the feeling that they had recaptured a lost intellectual innocence and integrity. Now they could speak</page><page sequence="9">722 AMERICAN QUARTERLY frankly about Soviet barbarism, the bankruptcy of socialist economies, and the treachery of revolutionary regimes, instead of having to make excuses for them. And once the "leftist blinders" were removed, the world turned out to be more interesting, varied, and exciting. "The way the world is," writes Joseph Epstein, "became a subject of greater fascination than the way it ought to be" (57). They felt more perceptive, creative, and productive. He felt, says David Horowitz, like an American for the first time in his life (185). The anticommunist movement, as it flourished during the cold war, was an unlikely cooperative enterprise of Catholics, Protestants, and Jews. The image of Roy Cohn whispering to Joe McCarthy while the Methodist J. B. Matthews shoveled them notes from his files is an apt illustration of anticommunism' s function in forging a new ethnically federated nationalism during the cold-war era. Catholic anticommunists like Buckley, Protestants like Hoover, and Jews like Hook arrived at their anticommunism by different paths, and their anticommunism reflected the peculiar concerns of their ethnic communities. So too with the Political Passages neoconservatives. Most of them are Catholics and Jews, and their specific reasons for leaving the left are rooted in values derived from the communities that produced them. But while the earlier generations of anticommunists carried into their anti- communism mutual suspicions born of generations of ethnic conflict, the Political Passages neoconservatives, with names that sound like a highbrow version of a Hollywood World War II infantry roll call, wear their ethnicity proudly but lightly, as a badge of membership in a patriotic national consciousness that sees the American mission as guarding the essential values of the Judeo-Christian heritage common to all their traditions. The decision to "hang up the old red flag" forced the Political Passages anti- communists to choose sides, to "choose the West" like the-earlier generation of intellectual anticommunists. And to choose the values of freedom turned out to demand opposition to philosophies and regimes that rejected them. At the end of their journey they found, in the words of Michael Novak, that "resistance to Communism, principled and militarily effective, is morally obligatory" (269). * * * Every human being is different, and so it follows that every anticommunist has his own story. There certainly were pseudo-anticommunists, like Gerald L. K. Smith or Merwin K. Hart, for whom the cause was a nothing but a financial racket; there were others, like Elizabeth Dilling, for whom it was merely a convenient excuse to wallow in anti-Semitism. Still others placed anticommunism at the service of the rich and powerful in their class war against reform. But that is not what emerges from this group of biographies and memoirs. In the lives of Hoover, Hook, Nixon, Buckley, and the neoconservatives, there is an underlying pattern, and it is not a pattern of irrationality or social strain. Rather each of these anti-</page><page sequence="10">ANTICOMMUNIST LIVES 723 communists was moved by a conviction that Communism specifically threatened his own community and its values. If we pay attention to the explanations the anticommunists themselves offer for their lives, the simplest interpretation, as is so often the case, seems the truest. They were anticommunists because, for reasons that exactly reflect the mix of cultures that make up America, they hated Com- munism. NOTES 1.

See also Ellen W. Schrecker, "Archival Sources for the Study of McCarthyism," Journal of American History 75 (June 1988): 197-214. The theoretical discussion of American anticommunism originated in efforts to explain McCar- thyism, though the use of that polemical term indicates at the very least a predisposition toward what used to be called anti-anticommunism. To deconstruct the term "McCarthyism" it might be useful to adopt Leo P. Ribuffo's useful idea of a "Brown Scare" as an analog to the "Red Scare" (in The Old Christian Right: The Protestant Far Right from the Great Depression to the Cold War [Philadelphia, 1983], 178-224), in which the left engaged in the same kind of rhetorical overkill, guilt by association, and character assassination as did the right. 2. Early efforts to explain the phenomenon as anxiety over changing values or frustration with the ethnic status system (Richard Hofstadter, "The Pseudo-Conservative Revolt- 1954," in The Paranoid Style in American Politics and Other Essays [Chicago, 1979], 41-65) were effectively demolished by Michael Rogin as logically and factually flawed (Michael Rogin, The Intellectuals and McCarthy: the Radical Specter [Cambridge, Mass., 1966]); Robert Griffith has recently provided an able summary of the current state of this dispute and of recent research on McCarthyism (Robert Griffith, The Politics of Fear: Joseph R. McCarthy and the Senate [Amherst, 1987]). 3. Two of the most helpful are Alan M.
