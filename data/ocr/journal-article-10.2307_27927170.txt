NUMBER 2 ? 2007 The First Adam, Androgyny, and the cAin Ghazal Two-headed Busts in Context Irit Ziffer Eretz-Israel Museum Tel Aviv Two-headed human statues with a common torso are a known feature of the ancient Near East, beginning with the inception of monumental statuary in the Pre-Pottery Neolithic period (the first half of the seventh millennium BCE) at cAin Ghazal, north-east of Amman. The following survey focuses on the two headed statues from cAin Ghazal ? the earliest of their kind to have been discov ered so far ? in an attempt to establish their significance. Monumental human statues dating from the Pre-Pottery Neolithic period at Ghazal were retrieved from two separate caches (unearthed in 1983 and 1985), which were dug for the sole purpose of their disposal under the floors of long abandoned dwellings. The statues of the first cache (discovered in 1983), dating from c. 7000 BCE, were stacked in stable piles, with an apparent disregard for the orientation of the heads or whether they were face up or down. The busts were arranged crosswise at the foot of the statues in an arc conforming to the shape of the pit (Tubb and Grissom 1995). In the second cache, dating from several hundred years later, the statues were deposited in a round pit ? in one half of the pit in a single layer, and in the other half in several layers. Furthermore, one statue was placed face down, and another figure, with the largest head, seems to dominate the group (Rollefson 1983; 1986; 1998; 2001-02). The statues, which were made by modelling plaster (composed of slaked lime, quartz and crushed calcareous filler) on a reed/rush core wrapped with twine (fig. 1), include full-fledged human figures that are large and flat to the point of being two-dimensional (ranging in height from 84 cm. in the first cache to 100 cm. in the second). In addition there are several busts, 12 one-headed in the first deposit, and three (or possibly five, see Grissom 2000: 272) two-headed busts in the second. The two caches vary in the size and style of the statues. In the first cache, they are naturalistic in style and are characterised by different postures, individual facial IEJ51 (2007): 129-152 129</page><page sequence="2">130 IRIT ZIFFER a Fig. 1.

A fragment of a leg from the first cache has six toes. The statues in the second cache are larger and more stylised than their predecessors: their features and posture are almost identical, and they lack arms. The eyes are marked with a mixture of bitumen and charcoal. In the first cache, the eye contour is round with an accentuated dot for an iris, whereas in the second cache, the rhomboid iris within an almond-shaped eye contour imparts a feline gaze to the portrait. With the exception of three statues in the first cache ? one with moulded labia and breasts (Schmandt-Besserat 1998a: fig. 2), another one representing a narrow-waisted female supporting her breasts (Schmandt Besserat 1998b), and a third statue with a narrow waist, broad hips, and rounded buttocks, possibly indicating the female figure (Schmandt-Besserat 1998a: fig. 3) ? none of the statues have any gender-specific attributes. In the first cache, the statues were treated with ochre to represent body pain (Grissom 2000: 28). Whereas the heads of the busts in the first cache naturally rise out of somewhat drooping shoulders, the busts of the second cache feature two heads emerging from a common torso, whose shoulders are spread out horizontally. All figures</page><page sequence="3">FIRST ADAM, ANDROGYNY, AND CAIN GHAZAL TWO-HEADED BUSTS 131 have a peripheral incision above the forehead ? perhaps intended for the inser tion of a headdress made from a different material ? and a well-balanced, flattened base, which makes it likely that these statues were once intended for public display (Grissom 2000: 43). The busts may have been placed on an elevated podium. Fragments of monumental human statues, similarly made of lime plaster constructed around a reed bundle forming the skeleton of the statue, were discov ered at Jericho, and fragments of an anthropomorphic statue were exposed in the Nahal Hemar cave, on the western shore of the Dead Sea (Garstang 1935: 166-167, pis. 51-53; Kenyon 1960: 92, pi. 12a; 1970: 54, pl. 14B; Tubb and Grissom 1995: 445-446; Bar-Yosef and Alon 1998: 20-21). Alongside the moulded skulls discovered in each of those sites, the human statues indicate a common cultural foundation of Pre-Pottery Neolithic agricultural societies. Rollefson suggested that the Ghazal statues represented ancestors whose effi gies were instrumental in shaping the historical memory of the community, some members of which specialised in lime and plaster production under a leading authority (Rollefson 2001-02: 103). Pf?lzner proposed that the statues were used in a domestic ancestor cult and that the busts were arranged on stands or altars. Another possibility is that these statues, substituting for the ghosts of the dead, were used to cast out demons, to ward off evil, or to practice necromancy, that is, communication with the dead through magic, enchantment, or conjuration of spir its (Pf?lzner 2001: 401-402). Schmandt-Besserat proposed that the cAin Ghazal statues represented deities, and that they therefore signify the transition from domestic worship to public cult. In her opinion, the diversity of human features on the statues bears evidence to a pantheon: the statue of the woman supporting her breasts to make milk gush forth represents the great goddess who nourishes mankind, and her distinct gesture, the hallmark of the Near Eastern Naked Goddess. She accounted for the polydactilism (a rare genetic syndrome) of the statues as a divine attribute, and, based on cuneiform literature, identifies the two-headed busts as the likes of the gods Marduk (according to the Epic of Creation, 'four were his eyes, four were his ears'; Dalley 1991: 236) and Ishtar ('Ishtar of Nineveh is Tiamat... she has [4 eyes] and 4 ears'; Livingstone 1986: 223; Schmandt-Besserat 1998a: 10-15). The four eyes and four ears may stand for a doubled face.1 Barnett (1986: 116; 1986-87; 1990) explained the polydactilism of the Ghazal statues as a mark l Compare the two nineteenth-eighteenth centuries BCE bronze statuettes from Ishkhali (ancient Neribtum) of a god and goddess, each with four faces, PKG 14: pi. 165a, b; Braun-Holzinger 1984: 44-45. Double-headed male gods appear in Kassite glyptic (Matthews 1992: nos. 148,149). A Middle Assyrian seal impression on a thir teenth-century BCE tablet from Assur features a cult procession towards a double faced frontal goddess wearing a scaled attire. The goddess's two faces seem to emerge out of two separate necks (Fischer 2004).</page><page sequence="4">132 IRIT ZIFFER of supernatural entities, such as the biblical Rephaim, a race of giants: 'There was a giant of a man, who had six fingers on each hand and six toes on each foot, twenty-four in all; he too was descended from the Rapha (single form of Rephaim). When he taunted Israel, Jonathan, the son of David's brother Shimei, killed him' (2 Sam. 21:20-21). When fragments of human statues made of plaster were discovered at Jericho, Garstang suggested that they represented a family of gods. Amiran (1962) ventured that the reed armature over which the plaster statues were fashioned at Jericho was not merely a technical device of ensuring the statue's stability, but rather an actual substitute for the human skeleton, bones and sinews. Moreover, she proposed that the making of the statues in fact imitated the act of human creation from an earthy matter, in accordance with the religious belief that man was fashioned from clay ? a belief that was to become prevalent from Mesopota mia to Egypt and would find its expression in the biblical account of the creation of Man in Genesis. Amiran's intuition is now corroborated by Selz's proposed etymology for the Sumerian GIDIM (Akkadian etemmu), 'Ghost' from GI, 'Reed'+DIM, 'Figure', i.e., a reed figure, a mimetic representation of the dead, such as the almost life-size 'dolls' of cAin Ghazal. Selz maintains that the cAin Ghazal figures were representations of ancestor ghosts, and that they were used magically in burial rituals (Selz 2005: 581-582, 585; 2006: 87).2 Hence, I suggest that even before the advent of pottery, it was commonly believed that man was a figure modelled out of an earthy substance. Therefore, the cAin Ghazal statues should be seen as the material expression of the concept of human creation by a divine craftsman, which was later transformed into the notion of Man's creation from earth by a divine potter, a notion shared by the peoples of the ancient Near East (Ziffer 2003). COMPARATIVE MATERIAL The two-headed busts from cAin Ghazal have parallels in ancient Near Eastern art until the early second millennium BCE. These include a marble statuette from ?atal H?y?k, dating from the first half of the sixth millennium BCE (fig. 2), in which two heads grow out of a common torso, with two pairs of breasts but only one pair of arms that are crossed on the abdomen (Mellart 1967: ill. 70); a two headed Hacilar-style vessel in the Abbeg Stiftung collection, Switzerland (mid sixth millennium BCE), which consists of a globular body with two necks, and two hands placed below two breasts respectively (Keel and Schroer 2004: 2 Indeed, the funerary liturgy of royalty at Ugarit included a ritual of the feast of the slm, 'protective spirits' or effigies, as the Akkadian salmu, i.e. that actual statues were involved in the cult of the dead kings at Ugarit.

Fig. 8. Twin head-cups from Tchoga Zanbil (Ghirshman 1968: pl. 70:G, T-Z.927) The bust statuette with two heads from ?atal H?y?k (fig. 2) stands out among the rest of the statues found at the site, which usually distinguish the figure's gender by emphasising the sexual attributes of female statues (Mellart 1967: ills. 70-79). The two pairs of breasts on the figurine are by no means sufficient to show that it repre sents a female, or even a goddess, Ishtar or Anat, in her double aspect as virgin and mother (Wipf 1990: 23). Rather, it has effeminate features, similar to the features on the statue of the singer Ur Nanshe from Mari (fig. 9), dating from the twenty-fifth century BCE (Asher Greve 1998: 14, 33, n. 37), or the foun dation figurines from the Third Dynasty of Ur and the Old Babylonian period (fig. 10). All these feature males with swollen breasts ? an androgynous figure with effeminate characteristics. Breasts were probably not perceived as Fig. 9.

The Naked Hero wearing a belt, Early Dynastic II?III cylinder seals (Amiet 1980: nos. 893, 907, 1001) above the waistline (a doubled triangle) enhances the ambiguous nature of the sex of this anthropomorphic vessel. Moreover, the paint on the faces may indicate beards. The fronton of the Peqicin ossuary (fig. 3) exhibits two modeled heads flanking a square opening. In view of other ossuaries found in the cave, in which the remains of two individuals were deposited (but without any visual indication of the number on the ossuary itself), the excavators have suggested that the ossuary was designed for the deposition of the remains of two individuals, probably related. They have stressed, however, that because this ossuary was found smashed, it was not possible to associate any bone remains with this 'twin' ossu ary (Gal, Smithline and Shalem 1999: 13*, 15*, n. 7). Many of the Peqicin ossuaries display sexual classifiers, such as large breasts or a beard, which may be indicative of the sex of the deceased. The two-headed ossuary should therefore be classified separately, as lacking any engendering signs.</page><page sequence="10">138 IRIT ZIFFER The eye idols from Tell Brak ? small flat plaques with long necks topped by large eyes ? indicate the intention of representing different figures. Some are equipped with long and conical head covers; others have head covers that are round with toothed upper edges (fig. 12). There are single figurines, occasionally with an animal pattern on their chest (fig. 13), no doubt chosen as a distinguishing mark; others that have a single torso shared by two pairs of eyes (fig. 4), two torsos one above the other (fig. 14), or three different torsos with three pairs of eyes forming a multiple figurine; and a third group with one torso and one pair of eyes, against which a smaller single torso leans (fig. 15), as well as idols on whose chest two smaller torsos lean (Lloyd 1978: 84). Except for the two-headed variety, all idols are equipped with one torso per pair of eyes and therefore represent a single figure, a pair of figures, or a 'family'. The disc-shaped idols from K?ltepe display similar features to the Tell Brak eye idols: one-headed idols in addition to two-headed (fig. 5) or even three headed idols with a common torso (fig. 16).

Possibly the Cycladic figurines, with two pairs of superimposed almond-shaped eyes with straight-gazing pupils (fig. 18), are yet another way of conveying the notion of two heads (Hendrix 2003: 425, 443).5 5 Using special lighting and photographic methods to conduct a microscopic examina tion of Cycladic figurines, Hendrix discovered some on which anatomical details and other ornamental patterns had been drawn.

Historically speaking, androgyny symbolises the perfect human being: female attributes cast into a male vessel. The foundation figurines from the Third Dynasty of Ur, for example (fig. 10), depict the smooth-faced builder king carry ing the basket of earth with swollen breasts, suggesting an effeminate character. This image expresses the king's perfection: not the robust, masculine bearded hero, but a more 'feminine' figure that incorporates male and female characteris tics, thereby symbolising humanity in its entirety. Thus, the king's image harks back to the image of the first human being who, according to Mesopotamian mythology, was created to relieve the lesser gods of the labour of providing for the great gods. The prototypical creature conceived to free these gods from their yoke, the first human creature, was named lull?. According to the Babylonian Flood Myth, Atrahas?s, the creature lull?, was fashioned from clay (tittu) mixed with the flesh (s?ru) and blood (d?mu) of the god who had led the rebellion of the drudging gods, and was named aw?lu, 'Man'; according to the Epic of Creation, lull?, the primeval man, was put together from the blood (d?mu) of the renegade god and from bones (esemtu) fashioned by the creator god, and was named am?lu, 'Man'.6 The god's blood has since constituted the divine element in mankind. In Akkadian, the noun lull?, which signifies the primeval man, the mould, the blueprint from which the whole of humanity was to be created, has no feminine form, such as *lull?tu, and therefore, no female counterpart (Dalley 2002: 118). In the Mesopotamian creation myths, the human body is a divine creation made of clay in which divine ingredients are mixed. It is not defined according to gender; it was produced in a single process before the existence of sex and gender, and therefore encompasses every possible gender. Only in the second creation were male and female couples created with genital organs vital for the reproduction of the species (Asher-Greve 1998: 29). This process is evident in the Sumerian myth of Enki and Ninmah, where the goddess Nammu, Enki's mother, creates of mixed clay, assisted by two birth goddesses and Ninmah herself, the first human being, a 'mould' (ME.D?M). Apparently, this first model creature was unable to reproduce (Shifra and Klein 1996: 82-84 and n. 10). The goddess Ninmah then creates from clay six human creatures, all imperfect and several of them imperfective with respect to the ability to reproduce, but in each case Enki is able to assign them an appropriate position in the human community. When it is Enki's turn to create, he makes 'a... from... in whose inside is... and pours semen made by his penis inside the woman's womb'. The inseminated female conceives, and Enki praises his penis for siring UMUL, the 6 Enki and Ninmah, 11. 1-39, Jacobsen 1987: 153-157; Atrahas?s, 1:1-60, 182-191, Dalley 1991: 9-10, 14-18; Enuma Elish, VI:l-34, Dalley 1991: 260-261.</page><page sequence="13">FIRST ADAM, ANDROGYNY, AND CAIN GHAZAL TWO-HEADED BUSTS 141 first baby, a divine creature born of the first female capable of reproducing (Stol 2000: 109-110).7 The Bible, too, narrates both stages of human creation. The first account (Genesis 1:26-27) clearly states that the original creation of mankind included both sexes: 'So God created man in His own image, in the image of God created He him; male and female created He them. And God blessed them; and God said unto them: "Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth"[...]'. According to this description, man was created in the singular (him; ) and was immediately referred to in the plural (them; ). The same description occurs in Genesis 5:1-2: 'In the day that God created man, in the likeness of God made He him; male and female created He them, and blessed them, and called their name Adam [= man], in the day when they were created'. The literal interpretation is that the name DIN included both sexes and represented their unified wholeness. The image of God materialised in the human form; and, when joined together, man and woman are the personification of God on earth (Rothenberg 2004: 148). Now, the second account of the creation in Paradise (Genesis 2:7) relates how the first human being was formed of the dust of the ground: 'And the LORD God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul'. Here the creation of mankind is portrayed as the work of a potter who fashions an earthen statuette and imbues it with breathing, thereby animating it into a living soul. Next a female is created from Adam (Genesis 2:20-24): Adam gave names to all cattle, and to the fowl of the air, and to every beast of the field; but for Adam there was not found a help meet for him. And the Lord God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam and he slept: and He took one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh instead thereof. And the rib, which the Lord God had taken from man, made He a woman, and brought her unto the man. And the man said: 'This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh; she shall be called Woman, because she was taken out of Man'. Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh. As it turns out from the second account, human being was first created a man, and it is from his flesh (rib) that woman was created. Their subsequent union is equiv alent to the decree in support of monogamy 'be fruitful and multiply' in Genesis 1:26-27; for woman was taken from the body of man, and without her he is incomplete (Rothenberg 2004: 150-151). 7 Kilmer (1976) has shown that UMUL (U4-MUL 'My day [of death] is far') is to be identified with Ziusudra ('life of prolonged days'), hero of the Sumerian Flood Myth, and, by extension, with Atrahas?s ('Exceeding wise', epithet of Enki, applied to his son) Uta-napistim ( have found life') of the Gilgamesh Epic.</page><page sequence="14">142 IRIT ZIFFER According to the pre-Socratic philosopher Empedocles (the fifth century BCE), the origin of the sexes lies in the first two generations of a different order of creatures. In the first generation, the limbs were unarticulated. These divine elements combined with one another in various monstrous unions, but not through sexual union. The second generation arising from the joining of limbs were fantastic creatures, both male and female 'born with faces and breasts on both sides... creatures compounded partly of male, partly of the nature of female, and fitted with shadowy parts'. The third generation were whole-natured forms of men and women. The fourth generation arose by 'intermingling (sexual inter course)... Feminine beauty excited the sexual urge' (Wright 1981: 49-54, 211-221). Berossus, priest of Bel and author of the Babyloniaca (281 BCE), writes that, in ancient times, when there was nothing but darkness and water, strange creatures were formed in the fluid, including men born with two wings and some with four wings, and two faces, who had one body and two heads, and they were both masculine and feminine, and they had two sets of sexual organs, male and female. None of the creatures mentioned by Berossus are divided into male and female sexes. The emphasis on the two heads is telling. The equivalent for the two headed human being with one body in Akkadian is in the phrase L? sa r?s?n, lit. 'a man of two heads' (Dalley 2002: 117-118, 121), the dual form of L? sa r?si (AHw 974b). The latter also appears in the logogram form L?.SAG, 'that of head' (plural: L?. S ACMES), which in West-Semitic languages became the s?r?s, a high-ranking official or military commander in the governing hierarchy of the ancient Near East. The L?.SAG was a eunuch, that is, a castrated human male (Tadmor 1995; D?lier 1999: 305-306). R?s?n, the dual form of r?su, is only docu mented in the Middle Assyrian law, specifying the corporal punishment imposed on adulterers and other sexual offenders: ana sa r?s?n ut?rlutarr?, lit. 'he will be turned into (one) with two heads', meaning: 'he will be castrated'.8 That castration should be denoted by the peculiar expression '(of) two heads' may find its equiva lent in the form of two testicles. The English word testicle goes back to Latin testiculus, which might be a diminutive form (test-iculus). The Italian testa, 'head', may be connected with the element test. Testiculus, therefore, could be 'small head'. Therefore, Akkadian sa r?s?n, 'One with two heads', could easily become 'One with no heads' or 'with mutilated heads', a euphemism for the person whose testicles were maimed (D?lier 1999: 304-305, 311): no longer a man, but not quite a woman ? broadly speaking, an androgyne. Thus, androgyny is portrayed not by terms related to the sex organs, but through the image of the two heads standing for the testicles. The visual expression for this euphemism 8 CAD R: 292:2 Eunuch. In Ugarit, a coveted handsome youth is to become a eunuch slave to fulfill his master's desires, ? as-ra-nu-ma a-na LU.SAG-wMz li-pu-su-su, 'and there he shall be castrated'. See Heltzer 1974.</page><page sequence="15">FIRST ADAM, ANDROGYNY, AND CAIN GHAZAL TWO-HEADED BUSTS 143 found its expression in the two-headed figure. Thus, the prototype human, containing both sexes, was defined through the two-headed person. In Plato's Symposium (189D-190A), Aristophanes displays knowledge of an ancient myth of the androgyne, according to which our original nature was by no means the same as it is now. In the first place, there were three kinds of human beings; the third kind ? neither male nor female ? had equal shares of the other two. 'Man-woman' was then a unity in form no less than name, composed of both sexes and sharing equally in male and female, whereas now it has come to be merely a name of reproach. Secondly, the form of each person was round all over, with back and sides encompassing it every way; each had four arms, and legs to match these, and two faces perfectly alike, on a cylindrical neck. There was one head to the two faces, which looked in opposite ways; there were four ears, two privy members, and all the other parts, as may be imagined, in proportion. When the androgyne was split into two halves, the distinct male and female sexes were created. Philo of Alexandria (the first century CE) took up Plato's dualistic conception of the creation. He distinguished between two different acts of the creative God: according to Genesis 1, the first Adam is an entirely spiritual being, whose incorporeal being may be defined as both male and female. Because this singular Adam creature was created in God's image, his male and female qualities should be understood spiritually: he is spiritual, neither male nor female, an androgyne, a general species, an 'idea or type or seal',9 a blueprint that comprises masculinity and femininity, and is, by nature, immortal. According to Genesis 2, Adam, having been formed 'of the dust of the ground', is a corporeal male creature from whom woman was later fashioned.10 The Sages in early Talmudic times knew the myth of the primeval androgyne and used it to account for the contradiction between the two stories of creation. In the Midrash, the first human being, the 'Adam', was androgynous, incorporating the genitals of both sexes, and the tale of the creation from the rib in Genesis 2 provides for the separation of the two sexes of the primeval body, reconstructing them as two human bodies. According to the Babylonian Talmud (Berakhot 61a; Erubin 18a), Genesis Rabba 8.1 and Leviticus Rabba 14 (fifth century), the man was created dipros?pos, 'two faced' (VDliHD-n), that is, male and female (Meeks 1974:186). 'Two faced' is a way of describing Adam, the first human being, with out the use of corporeal or sexual terms, a euphemism for the bisexual progenitor of the human race. Contrary to most ancient mythologies, which hold that woman is nothing but an offshoot of the male body, in ancient Egypt humanity was initially created with 9 Philo I, On the Creation 134, pp. 106-107. Boyar?n 1993: 37-38. The 'seal' probably refers to the primary type, the template of humanity, much like the first human crea ture created from clay, lull?, in the Atrahas?s. 10 Philo, Allegorical Interpretation, Book 1, 31-32 (pp. 42-43); Book 2, 3, 13, 19-23 (pp. 62-67).</page><page sequence="16">144 IRIT ZIFFER gender distinctions; thus, the word for 'people' in various creation myths was mostly written in the form of a man and woman followed by a phonetic comple ment (Pinch 2002: 68). Drawing on Rollefson's interpretation, which understands the cAin Ghazal stat ues as ancestral figures instrumental in shaping the historical identity of their makers,111 would like to suggest that these statues represented mythical ancestors from the dawn of mankind and that the two-headed busts among them represent the first human being, the androgynous prototype of humanity. Since various myths describe the first human being as one who is both male and female by defi nition, perhaps the two-headed busts are a very early expression of this myth in material form. The three female statues from cAin Ghazal (the first cache) may represent the next stage, in which woman came to be distinguished from man. As for the fact that, given the absence of gender attributes (a phallus or a beard), it is impossible to establish the male sex in the rest of the statues, they could represent both males and females. It may be that the statues were displayed dressed, the garment constituting the mark of distinction between the sexes. A similar situation regarding the sexes is evident in the massive stone T-shaped statues discovered in sacred compounds of G?bekli Tepe, Nevali ?ori and Karahan Tepe in south-eastern Turkey. Rising to the height of 4 m., these statues date from the end of the Pre-Pottery Neolithic A or the beginning of the Pre Pottery Neolithic periods (the ninth millennium BCE). They represent highly stylised human figures, and were apparently used as caryatids for a wooden roof (Brentjes 2001: 60). Some statues are carved with bent schematic arms and hands laid down below the waist (fig. 19); on others, various animals (e.g., fig. 20), birds, reptiles and insects are carved in relief (Schmidt 2003), undoubtedly differ entiating signs whose exact meaning evades us.12 A monumental naturalistic human statue (height: 1.93 m.) has recently been unearthed at ?anliurfa (fig. 21). The hands of this male figure are placed below the waist and above his genitalia ? a penis and testicles ? as though revealing them openly (Hauptmann 2003: 626-627).13 It seems that the bent arms of the massive, stylised T-shaped pillars aspire to the very same gesture. This gesture is common to both female and male figures displaying their geni tals, for example in the Chalcolithic ivory statuettes from Beer Sheba (Tadmor 11 Based on Sumerian sources, Katz has shown that the icon of the dead, his statue, which stood for the spirit of the dead, was the mediator between the mythological belief of the survival of the soul and the stark reality that the body perishes and noth ing remains. The statue or statuette of the dead facilitated the cult of the dead in places other than the burial site, even in the absence of the grave (Katz 2003: 200,208-211). 12 Brentjes (2001: 61-62) believes that the human figures served as divinatory devices and explains the carved images as symbols related to the cult of the dead. 13 Compare a human stone figurine with identical posture, without articulation of the sex, from G?bekli Tepe, Schmidt 2000: fig. 14b.</page><page sequence="17">FIRST ADAM, ANDROGYNY, AND CAIN GHAZAL TWO-HEADED BUSTS 145 Fig. 19.

It is therefore difficult to ascertain whether the schematic monumental statues from G?bekli Tepe, Nevah ?ori and Karahan Tepe represent males or females. Naturalistic sculpture from G?bekli Tepe clearly distinguishes between the sexes, as is evident in three phallic rock reliefs, an ithyphallic statue (40.5 cm.) (fig. 22) and the 30 cm. high stele exposed in one of the sacred compounds, which depicts a woman with spread legs and two streamers emerging from her genitalia ? an articulated labia (Schmidt 1999: 21, pi. 10: 1-3), or possibly menstrual blood.14 An 80 cm. high Pre-Pottery 14 For the significance of the menstrual blood and the origins of culture, see Knight 1991.1 am indebted to Yael Katz (Department of Religious Studies, Tel Aviv Univer sity) for this reference.</page><page sequence="18">146 IRIT ZIFFER Fig. 22.

Monumental androgynous figure, Kilisik (Verhoeven 2001: fig. 1) Neolithic stone statue from Kilisik at the foot of the Taurus Mountains (fig. 23) depicts a human figure laying its hand above the navel and genitalia, which include a penis, and testicles (?), beneath which is a large cavity. Although this statue might be male, it is more likely asexual, or possibly a composite androgy nous figure, showing both male and female genitala, the cavity representing the vulva (Verhoeven 2001). The two-headed busts from cAin Ghazal should perhaps be interpreted as a visual metaphor, a 'euphemism' or a more 'spiritual' expres sion for the ancient androgyne, whose dual sexuality is depicted not by two sets of genitalia, but by a common body with two heads. The cAin Ghazal statues and the colossal statues from south-eastern Turkey are a silent testimony to the beliefs of their creators. Perhaps it was in their time that myths explaining the origin of humankind were already beginning to form, those very myths that were first recorded in writing during the third millennium BCE ? myths bold and effective to such an extent that, conceived in the dawn of civiliza tion, they were to prevail in the cultures of the West for ages to come.</page><page sequence="20">148 IRIT ZIFFER RFFFRFNrFS; AHw von Soden, W., Akkadisches Handw?rterbuch, Wiesbaden, 1959-81 Aitken, M.J., Moorey, P.R.S. and Ucko, PJ. 1971 The Authenticity of Vessels and Figurines in the Hacilar Style, Archaeometry 13: 89-141 Amiet, P. 1980 La Glyptique M?sopotamienne Archa?que (rev. ed.), Paris Amiran, R. 1962 Myths of the Creation of Man and the Jericho Statues, BASOR 167: 23-25 Asher-Greve, J.M. 1998 The Essential Body: Mesopotamian Conceptions of the Gendered Body, in Wyke, M.
