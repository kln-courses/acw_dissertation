<plain_text><page sequence="1">JOURNAL OF BIBLICAL LITERATURE The Post-Resurrection Appearance Stories of the Gospel Tradition: A History-of-Tradition Analysis, with Text-Synopsis, by John E. Alsup. Calwer theologische Monographien, series A: Bibelwissenschaft, 5. Stuttgart: Calwer, 1975. Pp. 307+folding chart. DM 28. Alsup's basic aim (p. 19) is to analyze the form and structure of the resurrection-appearance stories of the gospels to determine the origin and intention of the Gattung that they represent. In tracing the history of modern interpretation of these stories, Alsup takes issue with various widely employed approaches: with M. Dibelius, because he begins with the kerygma and regards the stories as primarily illustrations thereof; with R. Bultmann and his predecessors, because they consider the needs of the early church to have had determinative influence on the details of the stories; with H. Grass (Ostergeschehen und Osterberichte [G6ttingen: Vandenhoeck &amp; Ruprecht, 1956; 41970]), because he places too much stress on the historical aspects of Easter and considers the Lichtglanz type of appearance story to be earlier than the gospel narratives, which he regards as objectifying; with U. Wilckens, because he employs the kerygma as the starting point for tracing the history of the gospel resurrection narratives, which he regards as portraits of an apotheosized Jesus. The most extended critique, however, is reserved for the theories of P. Seidensticker (Die Auferstehung Jesu in der Botschaft der Evangelien [Stuttgart: Katholisches Bibelwerk, 1967]). In this work the paradigm for the Easter appearances is said to be the OT epiphany stories, and especially the scenes of exaltation and enthronement in the canonical and extra-canonical apocalyptic traditions. Seidensticker claims that Jesus as exalted Son of Man was represented in the prinlitive church by appeal to this kind of paradigm before the present gospel narratives of the resurrection arose in response to the Jewish challenge that demanded more tangible evidence of the resurrection claim of the Christians. Alsup considers this accounting for the origin of the gospel accounts to be merely conjectural (p. 44). He likewise rejects R. H. Fuller's linking of these stories with apocalyptic tradition. And finally, he is impatient with C. F. Evans's assertion that the gospel narratives are incapable of harmonization. After seeking to make a sharp distinction between the historicity of the resurrection event(s) and the tracing of the history-of-tradition - which he says has not yet been done (p. 54), Alsup launches into a series of analyses that result in the narrowing of the scope of what he considers to be relevant to his investigation. Because Celsus ridiculed the Christian claims of the bodily resurrection, it is foolish to suppose that resurrection stories were ever employed as convincing evidence in support of the kerygma "for any sector of the Christian mission in this earliest period" (p. 61). On the basis of this single example that a pagan was not convinced by kerygmatic evidence, Alsup dismisses the kerygmatic material in the NT as irrelevant to his inquiry. Similarly, the references to resurrection in the summary statements in Acts are ruled out of consideration, since they consist largely of allusions to Luke's own stories of the resurrection. And the heavenly radiance narratives, as in Paul's Damascus-road experience, are ruled out on the ground that they represent a different Gattung from the gospel accounts, as is also the case with the empty tomb stories and the accounts in the apocryphal gospels. What remains, then, is a threesome of narratives: Matthew 28, John 20 and 21, and Luke 24. Even these are pared down by removal of "seams" and other elements that do not fit the Gattung. Its features include the following "basic similarities of structure and content": (1) The participants are in a crisis situation as a result of Jesus' death; (2) Jesus enters the situation unexpectedly; (3) he is seen but not recognized; (4) he addresses the recipients of the vision and a verbal exchange follows; and (5) he is recognized as the Lord, the Jesus of their former experience (p. 211). The evidence for this Gattung is laid out on a synopsis printed in large chart-form and included in a sleeve at the rear of the book. Alsup explores the Hellenistic material about theios aner and concludes that it is really not analogous, since those heroes do not really die. He finds the closest affinity with the 672</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS "anthropomorphic theophanies" of the OT, especially those of Genesis 18, Exodus 3, Judges 6 and 13, 1 Samuel 3, Tobit 5 and 12 and the Testament of Abraham. They are of service to the resurrection-appearance tradition, since there is need to give anthropomorphic expression to the appearances of the Risen Lord (p. 271). Written as a thesis under the late L. Goppelt, Alsup has performed a useful service in pointing up the range of different characteristics of the resurrection traditions. The bibliography and the detailed discussions carried on in the footnotes and excursuses are well worth reading and often serve to sharpen literary and exegetical issues. The basic thesis is, however, arbitrary and ambivalent. It is arbitrary in that excluded from serious consideration is a large segment of both NT and history-of-religions evidence: the eschatological vision-tradition that seems to have been central for Paul (even apart from the conversion stories in Acts). The evidence here supports Fuller and Seidensticker against Alsup. The direct verbal links between Mark 16:8 and the LXX version of the vision in Daniel 10, as well as the detailed parallels between that vision and Mark 9:2-8 do, in fact, represent the "substantial parallel" in intention and an "analogy on internal ground" which Alsup claims is lacking between the appearance material in the gospels and the intertestamental literature. The ambivalence is evident in that Alsup begins by excluding the question of historicity but finally lets it in by the back door in his concluding paragraphs (p. 273). The Gattung, the identification and development of which has been the announced goal of the book, turns out to involve "the clear articulation of interest" in stories expressed in a Gattung which bears "witness to God's historical self-disclosure" (p. 273). Since he raises the question about gaining "access to the experience behind the confession," this reviewer is puzzled by Alsup's refusal to allow others to do so and why he has excluded from his investigation other lines of evidence which might have helped toward an answer. Even if the question of historicity were to be excluded consistently, the "heavenly radiance" and kerygmatic traditions cannot be ruled out in advance if one is to get perspective on the range of forms and functions that the resurrection-appearance traditions served in the primitive church. The apocalyptically-linked NT material and the heavenly-vision stories deserve at least as full treatment as the fuzzy, anachronistic theios aner material, which is correctly ruled irrelevant by Alsup (pp. 214-39). Alsup has provided a painstaking history of a narrow segment of tradition, but what is still wanting is a comprehensive analysis of the diversity of forms in which the early church expressed its claim that God had raised Jesus from the dead. Though printed by a German press, the book is remarkably free of typographical errors. One does not know where to place responsibility for "rebuttle" (p. 20), "imminent" for "immanent" (p. 23), Iranaeus (p. 87), Ferrar for Farrer (p. 90 and bibliography), and "verticle" on the Synopsis. But minor blemishes aside, Alsup has written a serious and thoughtful work which leads this reviewer to hope that he will broaden the perspectives of his history-of-tradition study now that he is no longer under obligation to narrow the topic in order to complete a thesis.
