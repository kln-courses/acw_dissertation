Entries in the references should be in alphabetical order of authors and should include: name and initials of author(s), date, title, name of a periodical, volume number (arabic numerals to be used throughout), pagination (for articles in periodicals), place of publication (and name of publisher for any book published in I9OI or after).

Manuscripts will be returned only to authors who have enclosed the cost of the return postage. Page proofs of articles will be sent to authors, who should use the standard method of proof correction. Corrected proofs should be returned before the date indicated: where proofs are not received in time, the Editor will send to the printers his own corrected proof. Proofs are intended for checking, not re-writing, and authors are most strongly reminded that material should be submitted which is ready for the printer. Proofs of correspondence, announcements and reviews will not normally be sent to authors. The Editor reserves the right to shorten corres- pondence where necessary. Authors receive 25 free copies of offprints of articles only. Additional copies can be supplied at cost price, and must be ordered and paidfor when the corrected proofs are returned.

Shapiro Doctor Shapiro recounts the story of the discovery of the fossils of Peking man and the dramatic tale of their disappearance. The discovery, disappear- ance and mystery of a priceless scientific treasure has led a large number of investigators, both professional and amateur, in a series of fruitless searches. 'One of the best books on evolution I have read.' Adrian Berry, Sunday Telegraph 'Shapiro describes the subsequent search for the lostfossils, the accusations, counter accusations and tantalising leads . . . all the elements of a good detective story.'
