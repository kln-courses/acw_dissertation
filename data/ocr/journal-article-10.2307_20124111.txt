<plain_text><page sequence="1">ETERNAL RECURRENCE IN NIETZSCHE'S PHILOSOPHY ROSE PFEFFER JL he importance of the theory of eternal recurrence within the framework of Nietzsche's thought has been a subject of dispute among Nietzsche scholars. Some dismiss the idea as a subjective, religious experience and a deceptive illusion.1 Others acknowledge its importance, but see it in irreconcilable opposition to other central concepts of Nietzsche's philosophy, primarily to that of the will to power.2 In this paper I contend that the idea of the eternal recurrence is of central importance and represents a vital and essential unity in which the various aspects of Nietzsche's thought are synthesized. The idea expresses Nietzsche's critique and repudiation of the Platonic-Christian tradition and accomplishes a revaluation of values. It grows out of his conception of nihilism as a dialectical movement and basic law of the history of being and leads to an apotheosis of life. The timeless eternity of a supernatural God is replaced by the eternity of the ever creating and destroying powers in nature and man. 1 Alfred B?umler, Nietzsche der Philosoph und Politiker (Leipzig, 1931).

Kaufmann does not stress the importance of the idea of eternal recurrence within the framework of Nietzsche's thought and asks: "Why does Nietzsche value this most dubious doctrine, which was to have no influence to speak of, so extravagantly?" He claims that the answer must be found in the fact that the eternal recurrence was to Nietzsche less an idea than an experience, an experience of joy in which the powerful man affirms life in its totality, "backward, forward and in all eternity." Kaufmann, however, does not see any contradiction between the fundamental concepts of Nietzsche's philos ophy, as do the above cited interpreters. Instead, he stresses the close rela tion of the conception of the eternal recurrence and that of the superman. Both, he points out, are based upon Nietzsche's supra-historical point of view, his denial of indefinite progress, and his affirmation of the value of the moment and the individual.</page><page sequence="2">ETERNAL RECURRENCE IN NIETZSCHE'S PHILOSOPHY 277 The most important treatment of the theory is found in the Gay Science and in Zarathustra. Further references are contained in both his earlier and later works, and particularly in the posthumous publications, the Nachlasse Nietzsche presents the idea of eternal recurrence in many forms and under many aspects. I will discuss its importance from a scientific, metaphysical, and ethical perspective. The Scientific Basis of Nietzsche's Theory of Eternal Recurrence Most of the material which refers to Nietzsche's scientific ideas is found in the Nachlass of the eighties, in the many notes and fragments which were intended to serve primarily as a basis for his magnum opus, the Will to Power. In these notes he calls his doctrine of eternal recurrence "the most scientific of all possible hypotheses" and stresses the possibility of a scientific proof (Werke, XV, p. 182). However, in 1881, he admits in letters to Overbeck, Gersdorff, and others that he does not possess sufficient knowledge to provide such a proof and therefore plans to devote the next years to the study of mathematics and natural sciences. Nietzsche's theories and hypotheses have found no recognition 3 Nietzsche, Gesammelte Werke (Grossoktavausgabe, 1st ed., 15 vols. [Leipzig, 1895-1901]; 2nd ed., 19 vols.

He remains the philosopher of culture, the Zarathustra prophet whose temper is not scientific, but imaginative, artistic and speculative. However, Nietzsche's writings show a continuous attempt to reach an understanding of the processes of nature. Particularly in his theory of eternal recurrence he exhibits characteristics which are close to a scientific temper: a desire to find uniformities and order in the cosmic processes, a belief in the eternal, immutable laws of the universe, and a longing to transcend the particular, individual human exist ence and find a nexus between man and nature. Admittedly, his scientific insights are intuitive rather than systematic, but this intuitive ability to grasp the basic problems of science is indeed out standing. He not only gained a truly remarkable understanding of the sciences of his day, but he drew conclusions, particularly in the field of atomic theories, which science itself did not make until the end of the nineteenth and the beginning of the twentieth cen tury. My purpose in this paper is not, however, to evaluate Nietzsche's contributions to the natural scences. It is to prove, on the basis of his scientific hypotheses, that his theory of eternal recurrence represents a unified doctrine which does not contain the alleged contradictions that many of his interpreters have stressed. Nietzsche's doctrine of the eternal recurrence is based upon the following presuppositions which he states in the Nachlass : time is eternal and infinite; space is limited and finite; the number of atoms, the constituent elements of the universe, is determined and finite. From these presuppositions if follows that only a finite number of configurations and combinations of atoms is possible and, therefore, that in a sufficiently long period of time, a recur rence of past configurations becomes necessary (Werke, XII, pp. 51 ff.; XVI, pp. 397 ff.). The important question that now arises is: How are Nietzsche's presuppositions to be interpreted ? What are these atoms and their configurations whose finite number and infinite recurrence Nietzsche claims? If these presuppositions are interpreted on the basis of mech anistic theories of explanation and classical atomism, then the con</page><page sequence="4">ETERNAL RECURRENCE IN NIETZSCHE'S PHILOSOPHY 279 elusion could be drawn that Nietzsche's cyclical theory refers to particular fixed states which will, after a sufficiently long period of time, recur in exactly the same, identical way as they have already occurred an infinite number of times in the past. This conclusion is drawn by most Nietzsche interpreters who, then, on the basis of it, are confronted with irreconcilable contradictions between the cos mological and the ethical meaning of the theory, as will be dis cussed in the last section. But it is my contention that Nietzsche's theory is not based upon the classical atomism which still prevailed in his time, but upon a dynamic energetic theory of explanation. This leads to a different interpretation of his conception of atoms and thereby to conclusions which are contrary to an interpretation of the theory as a return of exactly the same static, unchanging states. On the basis of Nietzsche's writings and posthumously pub lished notes, a theory of nature can be constructed that proves Nietzsche to be a precursor of twentieth century dynamism. He calls the ultimate constituents of the world "quanta of energy." Energy becomes the fundamental notion of the universe, displacing matter. These quanta of energy are no longer the rigid particles of Democritus, Gassendi and Dalton. They are not the material, indivisible particles whose mechanistic movements determine the configurations of the world and whose essential property is their immutability. Nietzsche's quanta of energy are profoundly differ ent from the corpuscular entities of classical atomism. "The atom as a fixed point is without content and never exists. . . . The dynamic interpretation of the world with its denial of empty space and corpuscular atoms will shortly gain power over the physicists" (Werke, XVI, pp. 104 f.). His concept of Kraft is, in its dy namic qualities, close to the energy theories of contemporary physics. He breaks with the material and mechanistic explanation of the world which reduces all natural phenomena to a change in position of intrinsically immutable particles. The world is not a "block universe," made up of an aggregate of corpuscular atoms that persist through all time. Nor is it a pack of cards that, if shuffled long enough, must eventually turn up the same card again. However, it cannot be affirmed that Nietzsche is completely free of the spirit of his time. There are passages in his writings</page><page sequence="5">280 ROSE PFEFFER which point to a mechanistic theory of nature; but they must always be connected with his admission that the mechanistic ex planation is motivated by a need for clarity and must be considered "imperfect and merely a temporary hypothesis" (Werke, XIII, p. 80; XVI, pp. 106,400). It must be further acknowledged that Nietzsche's intuitive insights, which pointed a way toward twentieth century dy namism, were not independently conceived in the heights of the Engadin. Nietzsche lived in a period of scientific transition. While the nineteenth century had primarily a mechanistic back ground, the struggle between the mechanistic and the dynamic conception of the world had begun. Nietzsche himself mentions influences by Faraday, Boscovich, Caspari, Zoellner, and above all, Robert Mayer and his theory of the conservation of energy.4 Never theless, Nietzsche's originality and unusual ability to intuit and anticipate future developments and trends must be fully recognized in spite of the many influences by the scientists of his own time as well as earlier thinkers, above all Leibniz and Goethe. Although the mechanistic theory of nature was already undermined in Nietzsche's time, it was not until the end of the nineteenth and the beginning of the twentieth century that definite conclusions were drawn. Nietzsche's revision of the traditional concepts of atom and mass thus replaces the traditional concept of static, material quan tities with the dynamic quanta of power and energy that are con tinuously acting and reacting. Activity and process become the fundamental concepts. The universe becomes a field of force, a field of incessant activity. The principle of the conservation of energy, which Nietzsche accepts as the basis of his theory of eternal recurrence, expresses a law of conservation which takes place within change and process, a change that is not based upon a mechanistic, but a new, dynamic, energetic principle. Thus he says in the Nachlass: "Not only constancy of energy, but the will to become stronger in each center of energy as the only reality. ... It is a struggle between two elements unequal in power. ... In the 4 Die Briefe Peter Gast's an Fr. Nietzsche, 2 vols. (M?nchen, 1923-34), I, pp. 163 f.</page><page sequence="6">ETERNAL RECURRENCE IN NIETZSCHE'S PHILOSOPHY 281 smallest organism, energy is constantly formed and must be con stantly released" (Werke, XVI, pp. 154, 110; XII, p. 148). On the basis of Nietzsche's dynamic world view which is in contrast to the mechanistic, materialistic principles of his time, the following questions must be asked : Does Nietzsche mean by eternal recurrence the return of exactly the same particular states in the eternal monotony which he himself calls die ewige Leier and which he rejects in Zarathustra as the teaching of the dwarf and the animals? (Werke, VI, p. 318). In the light of his dynamic views, can the recurring states be defined as configurations of simul taneously existing material, static, immutable elements, or must they not rather be understood as simultaneously occuring values of energy? With the rejection of the materialistic, mechanistic principle of explanation the interpretation of Nietzsche's theory as a return of exactly the same fixed states must be abandoned. This inter pretation had presupposed not only a finite number of the funda mental constituent elements of the world within limited space and infinite time, but it also presupposed that these elements are dis tinct, static and immutable. When it becomes meaningless to speak of a particular, definite, fixed state of the universe, it is equally meaningless to speak of the return of such a state. If there are no permanent, self-identical, static elements, there are no recurring configurations of these elements. The theory of the eternal recurrence of exactly the same is an instance of the fallacy of "misplaced concreteness." A different interpretation of Nietzsche's theory must be con structed that is not based on classical atomism, but on his own dynamic, vitalistic world-view. Nietzsche asks: "Is the existence of diversity and the absence of complete circularity in the world around us not a sufficient counter-evidence against a uniform cycle of all that is?" (Werke, XII, p. 58). And he answers: "The same quantity of energy means something different on a different level of development. . . . Everything has been here before innumerable times, in so far as the total field of energy [Gesamtlage der Kr?fte] always returns. Whether aside from this anything identical has existed, is entirely indemonstrable" (Werke, XVI, p. 115; XII, p. 51).</page><page sequence="7">282 ROSE PFEFFER The eternal recurrence of the same is the return of the Gesamt lage der Kr?fte in which energy is constantly formed and constantly released. It is the return of the dynamic pattern of nature and life which is eternally active and eternally the same. The principle of conservation does not refer to the conservation of a static, un changing, fixed state, but it refers to the preservation of the "field of energy" which contains within it the elements of change and activity, of tension and release, repulsion and attraction, destruc tion and creation. "The energy of the totality of becoming rises to the highest point and falls again in an eternal cycle" (Werke, XVI, p. 115). The Eternal Recurrence in Its Metaphysical Perspective In the Will to Power Nietzsche says: "The triumphant con cept of 'energy' . . . must yet be supplemented. It must be given an inner will which I designate the 'will to power'" (Werke, XVI, p. 104). The concept of the will to power is the foundation of Nietzsche's theory of eternal recurrence and the basis of his metaphysics. Nietzsche is often called a philosopher of life, and a distinction is hereby indicated between a philosophy of life and metaphysics, between life and being as such. But Nietzsche's philosophy of life is a metaphysics of being and Heidegger is correct in calling Nietzsche a metaphysician, and the eternal recurrence "a doctrine where being is thought in its deepest sense." 5 Wherever Nietzsche rejects metaphysics, it is only the Platonic-Christian tradition that he opposes, in which being is understood as un changing and transcendent: "... in truth therefore not a rejection of all metaphysics, but only of a metaphysics of a fixed and static world" ( Werke, IX, p. 309). Just as Nietzsche, the "immoralist," is in reality a tortured seeker of moral values beyond good and evil, just as the atheist is in fact consumed by a deep longing for God, so the anti-metaphysician is, in his teaching of the eternal recurrence, the creator of a new metaphysics of life and existence. This new metaphysics is based on the repudiation of the 5 Martin Heidegger, Nietzsche, 2 vols. (Pfullingen, 1961), I, pp. 262, 369.</page><page sequence="8">ETERNAL RECURRENCE IN NIETZSCHE'S PHILOSOPHY 283 Platonic-Christian tradition and represents a "reversal of Platon ism." In the dictum of the Gay Science, "God is dead," Nietzsche expresses his revolt against Platonic-Christian transcendence where the real does not exist, and where what exists is not real. With the "death of God," the so-called "true world" of eternal and super sensuous ideas is destroyed. "But with the true world we also abolished the apparent world" (Werke, XV. p. 486). The world of the senses, becoming, and strife is now the only world that exists and thus becomes the "true" world. The reversal of Platon ism is accomplished. Transcendence is replaced by immanence, pure reason by existence. The reversal of Platonism finds its fullest expression in the teaching of eternal recurrence which represents a repudiation of the beyond, the timeless, and an affirmation of this life and the moment. Change and tension are not any longer something out side being, but they are necessary parts of being itself. Reality is no longer to be understood by pure reason, but is a reality which is lived, experienced, suffered. It is a reality based upon the fundamental concept of the will to power. The two basic concepts of the will to power and the eternal recurrence seem at first in sharp opposition. In fact, many inter preters have stressed the existence of a contradiction between a teleological "will to power" and a non-teleological "eternal recur rence," between eternal development and eternal sameness. How ever, it is my contention that the two concepts are closely inter connected and must be understood as a unity. Nietzsche's funda mental law, the Ur-Gesetz of being, must be interpreted in its double aspect of the will to power and the eternal recurrence. These two opposing positions result from fundamental differ ences in interpretation. The Schopenhauerian foundation of Nietzsche's voluntaristic conception of reality, as well as the re versal of that foundation, are generally acknowledged. But dis agreement occurs as to the manner and reason for the reversal of Schopenhauer's will to live into Nietzsche's will to power. This disagreement leads to different positions in regard to the acceptance or denial of a unity between Nietzsche's basic concepts of the will to power and the eternal recurrence. Nietzsche's conception of reality at first seems more pessimistic</page><page sequence="9">284 ROSE PFEFFER and negative than that of Schopenhauer. Both live in the shadow of Kant's critical philosophy which made na?ve, dogmatic meta physics impossible. The distinction between what is and what appears had to be acknowledged. However, Schopenhauer be lieved that the noumenal realm, which exists in a state of primal unity, is not completely closed to us. It can, even if only in a limited sense, be reached by the annihilation of the objectified will. Nietzsche, on the other hand, denies the knowability of the Ding an sich and abolishes it as a metaphysical foundation. This posi tion, however, is not always clear and the longing to penetrate behind phenomena into a primal state of unity is not always absent from the complexity of Nietzsche's thought. References to the Ur-Eine are not restricted only to his early writings, wherein he still accepted the Kantian distinction between the noumenal and the phenomenal and the Schopenhauerian separation of the world as will and idea, primal unity, and its objectifications. There are references to primal Oneness, the Ur-Eine, also in his later writings. But, on the whole, Nietzsche's position must be inter preted as a denial of the duality between the empirical and noumenal will. This is particularly true after 1881, the period during which the concept of the eternal recurrence was developed. With the abandonment of this duality, Schopenhauer's primal state of unity and peace becomes meaningless. All that is left is the phenomenal world of ceaseless striving and pain. This world is not Schopenhauer's world of illusion in which the primal will has objectified itself into a multiplicity of contradictory wills. It is the only world that exists. There is no possibility of escape. Schopenhauer's liberation from the blindly striving will, which the Saint accomplishes, is meaningless for modern Western, man and his existential concerns. Nietzsche, whose philosophy stands under the symbol of Dionysus, wants to find an answer which does not lead to resignation and Nirvana, to what he calls "weak pessimism." He reverses Schopenhauer's metaphysical teaching not by negating and abolishing its pessimistic premiss, but by interpreting it Dionysiacally. Schopenhauer's blind, striv ing will becomes Nietzsche's positive and creative will to power. It is a will that does not struggle merely for existence, but aims at stronger and fuller existence, at "growth and conquest and</page><page sequence="10">ETERNAL RECURRENCE IN NIETZSCHE'S PHILOSOPHY 285 supremacy." It is a will that is equally active and aggressive, but no longer blind and without direction. In the Will to Power Nietzsche says: "There is no willing that is not a willing of some thing; the goal must not be eliminated from the process of will ing. . . . One has abolished the essence of the will, the 'whither.' This is the case with Schopenhauer. What he calls 'will' is only an empty word" (Werke, XVI, pp. 133, 156). It is here that difficulties and ambiguities of interpretation arise. The question is: What does Nietzsche mean by the "whither" and "goal" which accomplish the reversal of Schopen hauer's will to live into Nietzsche's will to power? If "goal" is interpreted in the traditional meaning of the word as an end station toward which being develops and moves, if it is in any way con nected with ideas of progress and morality, Nietzsche's own mean ing is misunderstood and contradictions between his central con cepts of the will to power and the eternal recurrence are created. Instead, one must understand "goal," as used here, as an inner principle of form. It is Nietzsche himself who here, as in many other passages, contributes to the misunderstanding of his theory by giving anti thetical meanings to the same word, using it in the traditional sense as well as in the new meaning of his own philosophy. Although Nietzsche's concepts grow out of an entirely new way of thinking, he uses traditional, conventional terms to express his radically different ideas. In a "Backward Glance" to The Birth of Tragedy he himself admits: "How much I regret the fact that I did not have the courage to create my own language in keeping with my own, radically novel ideas. . . . Using terms borrowed from the vocabularies of Kant and Schopenhauer, I tried laboriously to express value judgments which were in basic contradiction to the spirit or taste of these men" (Werke, I, p. 11). By interpreting the word "goal" in the traditional and not the Nietzschean sense, many of his critics have been led to see a contra diction between the non-teleological teaching of the eternal return of the same and the teleological will to power, in which develop ment is understood as a progressive movement, and creativity as novelty. Among those who interpret Nietzsche in this manner are Simmel, Oehler, and Vaihinger. Their traditional interpretation</page><page sequence="11">286 ROSE PFEFFER of the word "goal" leads them to the conclusion that it is Darwin whose influence is responsible for Nietzsche's reversal of Schopen hauer's metaphysics. "Between Schopenhauer and Nietzsche is Darwin." 6 However, Nietzsche's own statements express a rejection of Darwin's concepts of development. It is true that some passages in Nietzsche's writings seem to indicate an agreement with certain aspects of Darwin's theory, but this agreement is merely apparent. Such is the case with Darwin's principle of the "survival of the fittest" which Nietzsche calls "a conception of the first order" (Werke, XIII, p. 236). But Darwin and Nietzsche mean some thing different by "survival" and something different by the "fittest." Nietzsche's "survival" is not merely struggle for exist ence and self-preservation, but it is primarily struggle for increase of power. "Wanting to preserve oneself is the expression of a distressed condition, a restriction of the fundamental instinct of life which aims at expansion of power. . . . Not distress, but abundance, extravagance predominate in nature" (Werke, V, p. 285). Nietzsche's "fittest" are not those whose basic instinct is self-preservation; they are not the "herd" men who, guided by utilitarian principles, are "more clever . . . and have more ingenuity-by ingenuity I understand . . . timidity, patience, cunning, disguise" (Werke, VIII, p. 128). The fittest is the higher individual, the "free spirit" who affirms struggle as a creative force and aims at intensification of power. Nietzsche's fundamental concepts are in opposition to Darwin's mechanistic and utilitarian principles of evolution which lack the creative element. Thus he says in the Will to Power: " 'Useful' in Darwinian biology means: to prove advantageous in the struggle with others. But it seems to me that true progress is already con tained in the feeling of increase of power which is quite inde pendent of its usefulness in the struggle; from this feeling alone originates the will to struggle" (Werke, XVI, p. 120). The will to power is a dynamic, creative force that does not aim at goals 6 Georg Simmel, op. cit. Richard ?hler, Nietzsche und die Vor-Sokra tiker (Leipzig, 1904). Hans Vaihinger, Nietzsche als Philosoph (Berlin, 1902); cf. by the same author, Die Philosophie des Als-Ob (Leipzig, 1911).</page><page sequence="12">ETERNAL RECURRENCE IN NIETZSCHE'S PHILOSOPHY 287 external to itself, but creates from within and organizes the dialec tical powers of its own being. It does not aim at evolution and progress in the Christian theistic, Hegelian, or Darwinian sense. "The goal of humanity does not lie in the end, but in its highest specimens" (Werke, VIII, p. 219), in the greatness of the indi vidual and his creative will. The will to power creates in the manner of the artist, not toward goals and purposes and utilitarian considerations, but out of the inner need for balance and form. Nature acts "not out of poverty and distress, but out of the fullness of its potentialities and an artistic urge" (Werke, XIV, p. 332). It is eine reine, freie Natur which possesses "purposiveness without purpose." The concept "goal," as traditionally understood, is to Nietzsche merely a Kantian regulative idea, a human category that has no objective significance. "We have invented the concept goal; in reality there is no purpose" (Werke, VIH, p. 101). "Goal" as understood by Nietzsche, is not external to the will. The will does not go beyond itself in its striving for expansion. Its goal is the intensification and unfolding of its own powers. "Power as the essence of the will and not as its goal." 7 If the will to power is interpreted in this way, its unity with the concept of the eternal recurrence of the same is accomplished. The will to power thus interpreted is the Gesamtlage, the field of force that was discussed in the preceding section; it is a center of energy that contains the forces of tension and release, of polarity and enhancement. And it is this Gesamtlage of the wills to power in their inner striving which returns again and again in eternal recurrence. "Let us beware to attribute a goal to the cycle of eternal return" (Werke, XII, p. 60). Nietzsche's reversal of Schopenhauer's "negative pessimism" into a positive, creative, "strong pessimism" is not based upon the influence of Darwin, but upon Heraclitus, Spinoza, and Goethe. "To place Darwin next to Goethe means to offend majesty, majes tatem genii" (Werke, XIII, p. 337). Nietzsche's concept of the will to power is influenced by Spinoza's and Goethe's non-teleological conception of being, his 7 Heidegger, op. cit., I, p. 52.</page><page sequence="13">288 ROSE PFEFFER eternal recurrence by their concept of unity. The Spinozistic influence is not always acknowledged by Nietzsche himself. It is often only indirectly exerted through the Spinozism of Goethe, whose poetic temper was closer to that of Nietzsche. Spinoza's concept of substance has many elements in common with Nietzsche's will to power. Substance is not a dead, inert unity, but an active power; it is not transcendent, but immanent in all modes of being. Substance as causa sui is expanded into causa efficiens omnium rerum, that is active in all that is and con tains not only the principle of self-preservation, but also that of heightening of power. Above all, both Spinoza's and Nietzsche's fundamental concepts of power are non-teleological forces. They are at work in a cosmos that creates according to its own laws without any final causation. Reality is free of ends and purposes. Development is not a progressive movement toward higher goals and ends, but every moment is of equal importance within the unity of the whole, and possesses the attributes of necessity and eter nality. But Spinoza's substance is still far removed from Nietzsche's dynamic, dialectical will which also contains conflict and tension. It is Goethe's principle of "polarity and enhancement" (Polarit?t und Steigerung) which, while influenced by Spinoza, provides for Nietzsche those elements which Spinoza's teaching did not ade quately express. It adds to Spinoza's all harmonizing peace the concepts of polarity and tension. But for Goethe, as for Nietzsche, polarity does not represent negative and hostile antagonism. It expresses an opposition that seeks equilibrium and contains the principle of intensification and enhancement. Goethe further adds to the clarification of Spinoza's anti-teleological world-view by replacing the ultra-deductive mathematical system by an artistic interpretation of life. For both Goethe and Nietzsche, the forces of nature work in the manner of the artist, creating freely without ends and purposes out of the duality and fullness of their own being. They operate in a perpetual rhythm of separating and uniting, perishing and coming to be. The concept that creates the closest kinship between Spinoza, Goethe and Nietzsche is, in spite of many differences, that of the unity of the cosmos. Spinoza's pantheistic views and his stress on</page><page sequence="14">ETERNAL RECURRENCE IN NIETZSCHE'S PHILOSOPHY 289 the immanence of the creative principle are the foundation for Goethe's and Nietzsche's universe. For both Goethe and Nietzsche, God exists in the creative activity of nature and man.8 Both find in the dynamic forces of the cosmos and their eternal rhythm of destruction and creation, death and rebirth, the unity of God and nature and man. It is the concept of unity which leads to Spinoza's amor intellectualis dei, to Goethe's Naturfr?mmigkeit and Nietzsche's amor fati. Nietzsche's concept of amor fati is primarily of ethical significance and will therefore be discussed in the next section. In order to further clarify Nietzsche's concepts of the will to power and eternal recurrence it is important to go back to Heraclitus. Nietzsche looks to the Pre-Socratics, particular ly Heraclitus, as his models and precursors. He finds in these earliest philosophers of Greece, seers and poets as well as thinkers, and is drawn to the mythological and intuitive elements that per meate their thought The three elements of Heraclitus' philos ophy which become leitmotifs in Nietzsche's teaching are the fol lowing: Life is eternal war, polarity, tension; life is becoming and flux; life is play, "the world of Zeus." These three elements become the bases for Nietzsche's fundamental concepts of the will to power and the eternal recurrence. There is no scholarly disagreement in the acknowledgment of the Heraclitian influence in regard to Nietzsche's concept of the will to power. The will to power is a dynamic, dialectical force, in process of continuous becoming and continuous striving. It manifests itself in the encounter with obstacles. But in regard to the doctrine of eternal recurrence, some interpreters have pointed to an opposition between the eternal return of the same and the eternal flow of the river, between being and becoming.9 How ever, Nietzsche himself sees no contradiction. He calls becom ing a "form of Being" (eine Art des Seins) and claims that the doctrine of "the eternal recurrence . . . this teaching of Zarathustra, 8 Goethe, in a letter to F. Jacobi, June 10, 1785, "Existence is God." Also see Eckermann, Gespr?che mit Goethe, February 20, 1831. Nietzsche calls his teaching of the eternal recurrence "the religion of religions" (XII, p. 415); cf. also, XII, p. 329. * B?umler, op. cit.</page><page sequence="15">290 ROSE PFEFFER might already have been taught by Heraclitus" (Werke, XV, p. 68). The Heraclitian river is not only a symbol of change and becoming, but in the sameness and repetition of the motion and beat of the waves, there is a rhythm which, like an Oriental melody, repeats itself again and again. The influence of the third Heraclitian element of "play" is seen in Nietzsche's aesthetic interpretation of reality. With Heraclitus, he arrives at a conception of nature that is free of ends and pur poses, creating in the manner of the child and the artist, playfully building and destroying "in innocence." It is a conception of the cosmos which Nietzsche calls "the Innocence of Becoming" (Un schuld des Werdens). "And just as the child and the artist play, plays the eternally active fire; it builds and destroys in innocence ?and this is the play of the Aeon" (Werke, X, p. 41). The world for Nietzsche is an eternal play of dynamic forces, their tension and release, their perishing and coming to be. It is an eternal recurrence of a will to create and to destroy, to struggle and expand. The Teaching of Eternal Recurrence in Its Ethical Perspective The ethical meaning of Nietzsche's eternal recurrence is treated apart from the metaphysical in this paper for purposes of clarifica tion, but with the realization that it separates what belongs to gether as a unity in which ethics and metaphysics merge. Inter preters who separate the metaphysical from the ethical perspective of the teaching for reasons other than those of clarification contend that Nietzsche's idea of eternal recurrence breaks into two irrecon cilable doctrines: the idea as an objective fact to be demonstrated by theories of physics, and the idea as a subjective hypothesis to be demonstrated by its ethical consequences. This break into two contradictory parts is unavoidable on the basis of an interpretation of the metaphysical meaning as an eternal return of exactly the same identical states, and of the ethical meaning in terms of tradi tional morality. Among those who see no possible link between the two perspectives of the idea are Vaihinger, L?with, and Jaspers. Their ethical interpretation of the idea is centered primarily</page><page sequence="16">ETERNAL RECURRENCE IN NIETZSCHE'S PHILOSOPHY 291 upon the following passage from the Nachlass: "My teaching says: To live thus that you must wish to live again, is the task . . . you will in any case. . . . This is a heavy stress. When you absorb and embody this thought, it will transform you" (Werke, XII, p. 64). This quotation is erroneously interpreted as a Categorical Imperative and thus the teaching of eternal recurrence becomes a regulative idea, a practical postulate, a will to eternalization, which has no connection with the cosmological aspects of the idea. The following quotation is found in L?with: "If everything returns . . . then the demand to live 'as if would lose all meaning. The second, the cosmological meaning, creates a fundamental con tradiction. ... If human life is merely a ring within the larger ring of the eternal recurrence of all that is?what meaning would there be in a will to go beyond oneself, to want a European future, to will anything at all ? . . . On the basis of its educational charac ter, one must understand Nietzsche's teaching as subjective, as a 'fiction,' an 'As-If there was an objective recurrence."10 And Jaspers says: "This idea must serve life. As such it is not a meta physical teaching, a metaphysical conception of being. It cannot be interpreted in logical or scientific terms. A world in which everything returns and can be figured out with mathematical cer tainty would be senseless."1X Vaihinger stresses the Kantian origin of Nietzsche's idea and calls it "a doctrine of conscious illu sion, a heuristic fiction." 12 I agree with the above interpreters that Nietzsche's idea must be understood as an ethical teaching, but not as a traditional ethics 10 Karl L?with, Nietzsche's Philosophie der ewigen Wiederkunft des Gleichen (Stuttgart, 1956), pp. 91 f. 11 Karl Jaspers, Nietzsche (Berlin, 1950), pp. 250 f. This book has recently appeared in English as Nietzsche: An Introduction to the Under standing of His Philosophical Activity, trans, by Frederick J. Schmitz (Tus con, Ariz.: University of Arizona Press, 1965). 12 Vaihinger, op. cit. Kaufmann, op. cit. pp. 283 f. Kaufmann, in contrast to Vaihinger, finds an analogy between Kant's Categorical Imper ative and Nietzsche's teaching of eternal recurrence misleading, a position which is supported in this paper. He points to the fact that Nietzsche was not primarily a moral philosopher, but was concerned, above all, with the artist, the philosopher, and the man who achieves self-perfection. "Partic ular actions seemed less important to Nietzsche than the state of being of the</page><page sequence="17">292 ROSE PFEFFER based on moral imperatives. I further agree that the teaching is a regulative idea, but stress the fact that it also is a constitutive idea. Both are connected in Nietzsche's thought and cannot be separated. Nietzsche's teaching is close to Kant. However, it is not the Kant of the second critique. The Critique of Practical Rea son, with its separation of man into a noumenal and empirical self, and its abolition of instincts and impulses from the moral con sciousness, is always rejected by Nietzsche and is contrary to his understanding of man. It is Kant's third critique, and his attempt to find a union between the noumenal and the phenomenal in the aesthetic judgment which influenced Nietzsche profoundly and led, partly through the mediation of Schiller and Goethe, to his aes thetic conception of the universe. The interpretation of Nietzsche's idea of eternal recurrence as a moral imperative and a "heuristic fiction" is not in agreement with Nietzsche's own thought. His entire philosophy aims at a destruc tion of a moral interpretation of life and wants to achieve a re valuation of values. It cannot be denied that the idea must be interpreted in its "formative and transforming" effects upon man, but the question is, Whom does Nietzsche want to transform and "breedP" He calls it a doctrine "strong enough to have the effect of breeding: strengthening the strong, paralyzing and breaking the world weary" (Werke, XVI, p. 279). It is a doctrine for the "free spirit," the strong, heroic individual and not for the weak who need goals and imperatives, who lack the courage to face life as it is and need illusions and idols. The weak individual is broken and paralyzed by the idea of eternal recurrence, since it robs him of the belief in a Beyond and the hope of salvation. The free spirit, however, needs no lies and illusions. His heroic will accepts the teaching in joyful affirmation, although it is at first a "heavy burden." And thus it will transform him, "Not only to endure necessity and on no account conceal it . . . but also to love it" (Werke, XV, p. 48). However, it is necessary to point out that Nietzsche's position whole man?and those who achieve self-perfection and affirm their own being and all eternity, backward and forward, have no thought of the morrow. "</page><page sequence="18">ETERNAL RECURRENCE IN NIETZSCHE'S PHILOSOPHY 293 in regard to the necessity of illusion is not always clear in his early writings, particularly in The Birth of Tragedy. Here he was still under the influence of Schopenhauer and what he later called "weak pessimism." Existence was still justified in the dream world of Apollo. Illusion was the only possible redemption for suffering man and God. But later, particularly after 1881, the concept of tragedy deepens through the idea of eternal recurrence. Schopenhauer's teaching is reversed. Zarathustra becomes the teacher of the overman and tragedy is overcome not by illusion, but by a "will to tragedy" which turns weak pessimism into a pessimism of strength, a "pessimism beyond good and evil." Nietzsche now means something entirely different by the aesthetic justification of life. It is not any longer the creation of Apollonian images and an escape into a dream world of illusion. It is an aesthetic interpretation of life which abolishes all moral values and the need for illusions, and justifies existence, with all its suffering and pain, by an identification of the creative forces of man with those of nature. Nietzsche speaks of this change in 1886, in his "Critical Backward Glance" at The Birth of Tragedy. He calls his early work "a first book in the worst sense of that term?one that exhibited every fault of adolescence." And he concludes his belated preface by saying: "That entire aesthetic metaphysics might be called arbitrary, superfluous, fantastic. . . . Yet, in its essential traits, it already reveals that spirit which later will defy and resist courageously any moral interpretation and meaning of exist ence . . . here we find perhaps for the first time a pessimism be yond good and evil" (Werke, I, pp. 7 ff.). Thus the idea of eternal recurrence does not serve life as a heuristic fiction and moral postulate, but it serves life as an obstacle and stimulus to strengthen the will to power. The idea was not created by man in order to provide him with a goal and necessary illusion. It was created by life itself whose essence is to grow, to expand and to overcome. "Life itself created this abysmal thought, it wants to overcome its greatest obstacle" (Werke, XII, p. 369). Nietzsche's teaching presents a new ethics, of which the motto is: "Incipit Tragoedia" (Werke, V, p. 266). It is not a tragedy in the Schopenhauerian, but in the Greek sense. Tragedy begins with the "going under" of the hero; but this going under is heroic,</page><page sequence="19">294 ROSE PFEFFER and bears within it the means of overcoming. Zarathustra goes under. He is the madman, the tightrope walker, the choking shepherd; but he is also the "convalescent" who accepts the "heavy burden" of the doctrine and becomes the teacher of a "new love." After doubt, despair and sickness, he rises. The circle is no longer the Drehorgel of the dwarf and the animals, the senseless, eternal repetition of exactly the same. It is the eternal return of the pattern and rhythm of life in its rise and fall, its will to suffer and its will to create. Tragedy ends in a Yes to life, "a Dionysian Yes saying to the world as it is, without deduction, exception and selec tion. ... It is the highest attitude that a philosopher can reach: to stand Dionysiacally toward existence: my formula is ,4mor fati" (Werke, XVI, p. 383). Amor fati becomes the foundation of Nietzsche's new ethics and finds its fullest expression in the teaching of the eternal recur rence. It is a concept that can be understood only on the basis of Nietzsche's conception of the unity of man and nature. Man's fate and freedom are inextricably interwoven with the totality of the cosmic fate. The significance and meaningfulness of the human will and its history is found within the non-human world, within the necessity of the cosmic whole. Nietzsche's concept of the unity of man and nature is close to Spinoza's pantheistic views. But Nietzsche is also modern man, living in the shadow of Cartesian dualism, Humean skepticism, and Kant's critical philosophy. His often seemingly contradictory passages must be understood on the basis of this modern duality. Nietzsche's return to pre-Socratic unity is frustrated by the prob lematic situation of modern man and the sentimental artist who has lost his unity with nature. But he never ceases to strive for this unity and to consider it the basis for his interpretation of man's destiny and freedom. "The riddle that man faces must be solved within being itself and no other way" (Werke, I, p. 431). The neglect of Nietzsche's concept of the unity of man and nature has been largely responsible for those interpretations which had separated the idea of eternal recurrence into a metaphysical and an ethical teaching. Heidegger, however, is one of the few inter preters who acknowledges the unity of Nietzsche's ideas. Neither Heidegger nor Nietzsche make the traditional distinctions; for</page><page sequence="20">ETERNAL RECURRENCE IN NIETZSCHE'S PHILOSOPHY 295 both, metaphysics and ethics merge. But the basis of this unity is not always the same and the points they emphasize often differ. Above all, Heidegger completely neglects the concept of amor fati which accounts, in spite of his closeness to the spirit of Zarathustra Nietzsche, for his often excessively subjective interpretation on the basis of his own fundamental concepts of time, freedom, and the unity of man and nature. The unity between Weltsein and Menschsein, between Sein und Seienden is accomplished by both philosophers on different grounds. Heidegger's unity is achieved on the basis of a new ontology which is grounded in existential phenomena. His start ing point and foundation for any transcendence into being is always existence, Dasein. It is man who in his ontological concerns gives meaning and reality to the world around him and creates the Um welt. While he distinguishes between authentic and inauthentic, ontic, and ontological concerns, his categories of care, dread, and resolve seem to remain existential and human. Nietzsche's starting point, on the other hand, is nature and the penetration of the mysteries of its creative processes. Man is part of nature, inextricably interconnected with the totality of the cosmos. The world we live in is not created anew each moment by a human decision. It is man whose fate and freedom gain meaningfulness only on the basis of his unity with the creative activity of nature. Nietzsche warns against a humanization of nature, against a reading of human goals and values into what he calls "The Innocence of Becoming." His ultimate aim is to re establish the ancient Greek unity, "to consider man again as part of nature" (Werke, XI, p. 250). Heidegger, in disregard of these fundamental differences, interprets Nietzsche on the basis of his own conception of nature and being and says in reference to Nietzsche's metaphysical views: "Metaphysics is anthropomorphic . . . the forming and conception of the world in the image of man. . . . This metaphysics makes man, as no other metaphysics before, the unconditional measure of all things." 13 This passage from Heidegger's book on Nietzsche must be contrasted with a quotation from Nietzsche's own writings: 13 Heidegger, op. cit., II, p. 127 f.</page><page sequence="21">296 ROSE PFEFFER "The whole conception 'man against the world' . . . man as the measure of things, is recognized as an immense absurdity and rejected by us" (Werke, V, p. 279). From this fundamental opposition in Heidegger's and Nietzsche's understanding of the relation between man and nature, additional differences result which further contribute to Hei degger's subjectively biased interpretation. Heidegger chooses the concept of time as central for understanding Nietzsche's teaching of the eternal recurrence and takes as his central theme the following passage from "On the Vision and the Riddle" in Zarathustra: "There is a gateway just where we stopped . . . two paths meet here; no one has yet reached their end. This long lane stretches backward into eternity. And the long lane out there, that too, is another eternity. They contradict each other . . . and it is here in the gateway that they come together. The name of the gateway is inscribed above: 'Moment.' " And Zarathustra continues: "From this gateway, 'Moment,' a long, eternal lane leads back ward: behind us lies eternity." and he adds: "Are not all things knotted together so firmly that this moment draws after it all that is to come?" (Werke, VI, pp. 231 ff.). It is in the present "Moment" that the concept of eternity and Nietzsche's teaching of eternal recurrence become comprehensible to Heidegger. But this comprehension is based on an under standing of the concept of time that is contrary to Nietzsche's. While both Heidegger and Nietzsche agree that the past, present and future form a dynamic unity, significant differences exist. Hei degger, in contrast to Nietzsche, stresses the future and not the past as the fundamental exstasis of existence and interprets Nietzsche's teaching on that basis. His emphasis is on that part of the above quotation from Zarathustra which, if taken only in itself, could justify his contention: "All things are knotted together so firmly that this moment draws after it all that is to come." However, if the concept of amor fati is considered to be of central and of primary importance in Nietzsche's teaching, then the emphasis must be on the past, not the future. Another part of the above passage is then of primary importance: "From this gate way, Moment, a long eternal lane leads backward: behind us lies eternity."</page><page sequence="22">ETERNAL RECURRENCE IN NIETZSCHE'S PHILOSOPHY 297 Thus it can be seen that Nietzsche's eternal recurrence has been interpreted by Heidegger in terms of his own concept of authentic temporality. The past and present, time and history, become authentic only by their transcendence; man finds his free dom and meaningfulness only in the projection of Dasein into the future. What already was and will return is this present moment with its power to make the past vital and its possibilities to create the future. What returns is the present moment which the indi vidual can by resolve and decision transcend, and thus transform an otherwise insignificant past and present into a meaningful future. Nietzsche's theory of eternal recurrence is vermenschlicht. Time and eternity become human categories. Freedom and creativity are realized in the human will to transcend; despair and suffering are founded upon human decision and responsibility. But this is not Zarathustra's "abysmal thought." That which makes Zarathustra shudder is not the decision of the moment, with its terrible freedom and responsibility. It is the consciousness of the future that already was and the past that will eternally return, with eternal inevitability. Nietzsche's tragedy is of a different dimension than that of Heidegger's interpretation. Heidegger's despair and anguish are existential and can be overcome by man's attitude and decision. Nietzsche's concept of tragedy is deeper, however, and is more truly tragic. It is metaphysical and never can be abolished by the human will to transcend. The problems that arise from Nietzsche's conception of time, freedom, and creativity are far more complex than those that result from Hei degger's interpretation of the teaching. Nietzsche and Heidegger both celebrate the moment, but in a different sense. The Hei deggerian man experiences the fullness of the moment as one in which the past influences, but does not enchain him. His thoughts and will are directed toward the future, undetermined by fate and necessity. He is the creator of that which returns; his creativity involves originality and novelty. The Nietzschean man experiences the moment in a more tragic manner. It leads him into the abyss, but also into a conception of life and being where the moment becomes the highest exultation of the artist. It is the concept of amor fati that provides the basis for Nietzsche's conception of freedom and creativity; and it is also the</page><page sequence="23">298 ROSE PFEFFER means by which the negative element of the teaching is overcome. In the concept of amor fati man accomplishes an identification with the processes of nature and with the past that returns again and again. It is here that Nietzsche performs the important transition not only from the "thou shalt" to the "I will," but also to the "I am." In fact, the second step to the "I will" already contains the third transition to the "I am," for Nietzsche's "I will" is not identical with Heidegger's; it is not primarily a willing toward the future, but a will "to set free the past and transform the 'it was' into a 'thus I willed it' " (Werke, XV, p. 100). The step from the "it was" to the "thus I willed it" is achieved on the basis of man's unity with the fatality of the cosmos. There is no antinomy be tween will and fate. The "I will" is also the "I am." "This is my last wisdom: I want that which I must. ... I want nothing else than this eternally returning world that is not foreign to me, but is at once my 'Ego' and my 'Fatum.' I want myself eternally again as a ring within the larger ring of the world" ( Werke, VIII, pp. 383, 102 f.). The passage from the Nachlass that has been quoted before gains a new clarity. "To live thus that you must wish to live again, is the task . . . you will in any case." The two parts of the quotation are no longer in contradiction. "Ego-Fatum. . . . The fatality of man cannot be detached from the fatality of all that was and will be . . . one is a piece of fatum, one belongs to the whole" (Werke, VIII, p. 100). The question that faces the Nietzschean man is how he can find freedom within this fatality of all that was and will be, within a world that possesses "no order, but necessity." In the Gay Science Nietzsche says: "The total character of the world is chaos, not in the sense of a missing necessity, but of a missing order" (Werke, V, p. 149). Nietzsche's world lacks the order of either a mechanistic or a teleological universe, but it does not lack necessity. However, it is not a necessity "to act thus and thus in obedience to a law or law giver, whereas apart from the law it would be free to act otherwise. But precisely that inability to act otherwise might spring from being itself which did not behave in such and such a way in response to a law, but because it was constituted in such and such a way ... it is neither free nor unfree, but merely thus and thus" (Werke, XVI, pp. 109 f.).</page><page sequence="24">ETERNAL RECURRENCE IN NI ETZSCHE'S PHILOSOPHY 299 "Necessity is fatum." It is not the necessity of a law that is external to us or beyond us, but the necessity to act "thus and thus" in accordance with the fatality of being itself and the eternal return of all that is. Freedom must be achieved within this necessity. Nietzsche denies "free will" in the traditional sense and calls it "a contemptible trick devised by theologians in order to make man kind 'responsible' in their sense" (Werke, VIII, p. 99). His con cept of freedom is also contrary to Schopenhauer's negation of the will, Kant's moral consciousness and Heidegger's "free resolve." Freedom to Nietzsche is achieved by amor fati and man's identifica tion with the cosmic whole, whereby an otherwise strange fate is transformed into his own. It is a conception that is close to Spinoza's freedom within determinism, and Goethe's conception of the artist's creative activity. Zarathustra, the godless one, has found a new faith: "circulus vitiosus deus." He has found a new love: "I want to love only that which is necessary. Amor fati be my last love" (Werke, XII, p. 141). Zarathustra does not negate any more. In Dionysian rapture he beholds the play of the cosmic forces, der Dinge eigenen Tanz. In the teaching of the eternal recurrence Nietzsche creates a new ethics that is free of moral imperatives, guilt, responsibility and "ressentiment." "We others . . . whose antagonists are the apostles of revenge and ressentiment . . . who want to regain the innocence of becoming, are the missionaries of a purer thought. . . . We are not the results of an eternal design, will, wish . . . the whole cannot be judged, measured, compared or even negated . . . because there is nothing else but the whole . . . this is the innocence of all being" (Werke, XVI, p. 202). It is an ethics that abolishes the need for transcendence and redemption and affirms this life without reduction and curtailment. It protests against defeat and negation and affirms "struggle, pain, destruction as necessary because of the abundance of forms surging constantly into life, because of the enormous fecundity of the world will; we feel the furious prodding of this pain in the same moment in which we become one with the immense lust for life" (Werke, I, p. 117). In Nietzsche's new ethics "the unconscious activity of nature</page><page sequence="25">300 ROSE PFEFFER breaks out in the consciousness of man." 14 The creative individual does not aim toward that which is good and useful and pleasant, but toward an inner fitness which expresses the very essence of things. He does not act in obedience to moral laws and imper atives, but out of the fullness and abundance of his creative powers. Nietzsche's ethics celebrates the heroic will of the individual who erects upon the altar of the dead transcendent god, the new divinity, man, and becomes the prophet of a new "meaning of the earth." It glorifies the will to power and its eternally active dy namic forces: the will to destroy and create, to go under and over come, in eternal recurrence.15 Brooklyn College. 14 Kant, Critique of Judgment. 15 Key to the Grossoktavausgabe of Nietzsche's Collected Works: Vols.
