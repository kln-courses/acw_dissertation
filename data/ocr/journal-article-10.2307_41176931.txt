<plain_text><page sequence="1">Progressive Revelation George Ernest Wright a small Hebrew class was reading the story of Daviďs adultery with Bath-sheba, and of his subsequent elaborate attempt to cover his deed even to the extent of having the husband killed. Yet _____ the thing was not hidden from God nor from his prophet. In the course of the latter's accusation the judgment of God was pronounced : "Thus says the Lord, Behold, I will raise up evil against you out of your own house ; and I will take your wives before your eyes, and give them to your neighbor, and he shall lie with your wives in the sight of this sun" (2 Sam. 12 :ii). At this point lone of the students asked: "How could a good God order or even threaten' such a judgment? I can understand that justice requires the punishment of David but I cannot com- prehend why the wives should be brought into it, especially when we must affirm the love and goodness of God !" How shall such a question be answered? Shall we simply say that this is one of the nasty bits of Scripture and then pass it over for something that is nicer and more "spiritual?" During the past two or three generations the general tendency among biblical scholars and theologians was to do just this. They began at the point where our student began with his question : that is, with an initial as- sumption about gbodness, love and beauty. These ideal entities are really what God is, or, at least, we must assume that these ideals represent God. Hence wher- ever one encounters material in the Bible that does not appear to be lovely, beauti- ful or good, then we cannot assume that jit is* a revelation of the true God ; at best, what is revealed about God in such places must be on a! fairly low level of concep- tion. If God is good and loving, then we must see in the Bible many differing ethical conceptions. As one writer recently put it: "Blind adherence to the letter of Scripture takes no notice of the varying conceptions of different men in different periods. ... It sees no difference between the conception of a God who orders Agag hewn to pieces before the altar, or who dashes the enemies' children against a stone, and the God and Father of Jesus Christ who taught, through St. Paul, 'If your enemy is hungry, feed him' (Romans 12:20) and who, on the Cross, asked forgiveness for his slayers." In the Bible all agree that Jesus is the pinnacle of the story, representing in noblest form our ideals of goodness and love. These ideals with which we begin coincide perfectly with the person of Jesus. Hence, we assume that other things which are not so lovely in the Old Testament are of limited value. Such a method of approach to the Bible was developed at a time when the idea of progress was being transferred from the natural sciences to human history, when evolution and the Bible were being adjusted one to another, and that not Dr. Wright is a member of the Department of Old Testament of the MoCormick Theo- logical Seminary, Chicago, Illinois. [61]</page><page sequence="2">The Christian Scholar without considerable difficulty. Fit the above viewpoint into the idea of progress, apply both to the Bible, and the conception of "progressive revelation" emerges. This is simply that the spiritual, theological and ethical ideas in the Bible are not on one level. A growth has occurred. When Israel was a child, its ideas were crude and primitive ; but as it matured, it gradually put away childish things ; it discovered, especially through the work of the prophets, ever finer truths, until in the fulness of time Christ came as the climax and end of this fragment of evolu- tionary process. Turn the thing over, look at it from Goďs side, and the result is this : God gradually made his word known to people as they were capable of compre- hending it Yet progressive discovery of fever nobler ideas about God and the good is really what has been meant by "progressive revelation" as most people of the last two generations have used the term. In our time, however, thene is a question mark being placed beside such an approach to the Bible because, among other things, it fails to do justice to the Bible's own perspective. The questioner with whom we started began with an unanalyzed assumption concerning his ideals and God. His basic given was the identity of God and the good, as he understood the good, though the source of his knowledge of that good was unquestioned. Hence in his mind the Good as G¡od could not reveal itself in the forms of historical evil. The tenth century writer of 2 Sam. 12, however, was a contemporary of the events described and of their after- math. He is believed to have been a friend and a close observer of David's life and death. He wrote the verse in question, about the trouble that was to come out of David's own household and about the disgrace which was to be visited on the king through the public violation of his harem, in the light of what actually happen- ed. From this point on in the story David has a series of troubles, and they came mostly from his own family. The worst blow of all was the rebellion of Absalom, which almost succeeded in its aim with the result that David was forced to flee for his life. When Absalom came to Jerusalem, he pitched a tent upon the palace roof and publicly violated his father's harem as a sign that he had taken over the reins of government and that his father's power was at an end. To the victor went the spoils, including the women, of the vanquished (see II Sam. 16:21-22). In other words, the passage about God's judgment of David for his sin was written in the light of, and perhaps even colored by, what actually happened in the years that followed the Bath-sheba incident. It did not occur to the writer to question the matter or to wonder about the goodness of God. He understood this goodness full well, and he has portrayed his hero up to this point as a remarkable testimony to the wonderous grace of God who in David finally granted unto his people the first real security they had ever had. The extraordinary tokens of David's prowess and wisdom are taken as testimony to God's undeserved beneficence. Yet David sinned and terrible things happened to him when he was an old man. These to our court historian are facts of history. And these facts are the stuff ¡with which theology must deal. He does not begin with any preconceived notions of what [62]</page><page sequence="3">Progressive Revelation God can or cannot do. He began with the testimony which was an interpretation from past experience that God was good, and he proceeded from that, through sin, into current and future historical reality. In the evil of Absalom's rebellious acts he saw the just hand of the good bord, and that without absolving Absalom of his crime. For many of us today there seems to be an order of the spiritual, a "spiritual- ismus" which is assumed to be religious but which is somehow separated from the profane, from the "facts of life" or of historical experience. There are two realms, an above and a below, the ideal and the real. Yet for our biblical writer there was no such understanding of the spiritual. There is only one realm that is significant, that is the complex order of daily life, with, one might say, all of its political, social and economic aspects understood as the arena of revelation. This revelation was not primarily a series of ideals or ideas. It was the knowledge that the factual event, in our case Daviďs acts toward Bath-sheba and Uriah, was not self explanatory apart from the claim of God upon his people. In the light of that claim Daviďs deed was sin; it was "despising" God (II Sam. 12:9), and it would be followed by penalty. The subsequent rebellion of Absalom and the works associated with it are to be understood as a portion of that penalty. Our author is grappling with the complexities of history and he is attempting to understand their meaning. The clue to his procedure is not to be fiound in "spiritualizing", tut simply in his attempt to comprehend what is. The stuff of his theology is the stuff of history. He does not ask how a good God could do this or that. What has happened, has happened and an attempt must be made to understand it, whether it is pretty or not. One does not begin with preconceived ideas of what God can or cannot do, but one tries to interpret what happened. Such a procedure will not lend itself to the construction of a coherent and convenient system of belief about God and the world. It will always have questions within it, for God does not remove the veil from his mystery. There will be continuous tension between justice and love, law and grace, meaningfulness and vanity. And the resolution of that tension may be seen in particular historic moments (that is, particularly in Christ), but the facts of history do not let it remain resolved. Yet the question now arises as to whether the attempt to understand the meaning of events does not itself undergo refinement in the course of time, so that one can say that a development takes place. Does not the impact of Christ's life and death refine the primitive Church and cause a considerable gulf to be fixed between it and old Israel in numerous Very important respects? Did not the break- up on the Judean community in 587 В. С bring new issues to the fore which were not considered before? Is not this in some sense "progressive revelation?" That the Bible has great variety and that new situations raised either new theological issues or old issues in new form is quite clear. Yet, scholars today are less willing to chart a simple course of development than they once were. Further- [63]</page><page sequence="4">The Christian Scholar more, they generally believe that the earlier stages of the history must not be de- pressed to an extremely low level in order to make room for a particular scheme of development. Genesis 2-4 represent very early material, but they are no longer considered as simple relics of a primitive and naive anthropomorphism. In other words, present and future events were faced in the light of the knowledge gained from past events. And this knowledgte of the past was continually tested in the light of the present situation. Past and present, "that which was from the be- ginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our eytes, ... of the Word of life, . . . declare we unto you, that ye also may have fellowship with us." All experience is in a measure unified under the same Ljord who has made himself known in different ways. H. Richard Niebuhr in his book, The Meaning of Revela- tion (New York, 1941), pp. 135-36 has well summarized the shift in the under- standing of progressive revelation as follows: "Revelation is not progressive in the sense that we can substitute for the revelatory moment of Jesus Christ some other moment in our history and interpret the latter through the former. The monastic movement and the Reformation, modern evangelism and the social gostpel, represent no progress beyond the New Testament in the sense that we may understand the latter through the former. Benedict and Luther must be interpreted through Christ and not vice versa ; modern civilization and modern human life must be regarded as the scene of activity on the part of the Father of Jesus Christ, but Jesus cannot be rightly understood as the son of the god of modern culture. Nevertheless revelation is a moving thing in so far as its meaning is realized only by being brought to bear upon the interpretation and reconstruction of ever new human situations in an enchiring movement, a singlte drama of divine and human action. So the God who revealed himself continues to reveal himself as the one God of all times and places." In other words, our knowledge of God is real or meaningful, not when it is simply and solely expressed in ideals and principles, but when it is both applied to and drawn from the complexity of our human deeds and relationships. This means that it is never static, never fully expressible in abstractions, always alive and mov- ing as is history itself. Revelation is an attitude, an expression of a relationship, an initiation into meaningful activity - it is all this before it is or can be a doctrine ; it is never a truth apart from an event. Indeed, to define it as doctrine is to betray biblical faith. The word "faith" in the Bible refers to commitment, to trust and fi- delity, to the nature of the relationship which the Faithful One has created. Ideas and doctrines, to be sure, are involved in faith, but their particular formation is so largely conditioned by the particular situation in which they appear it is difficult to systematize them. "New occasions teach new duties," and dutiful activity is never precisely the same in a new occasion as it was in an old one. Nevertheless, there is a unity in what Professor Niebuhr calls "a single drama of divine and human action." And it is to that drama that the biblical canon bears witness. Yet what is the validity in the Church's conception of a closed canon ? That the Song of Songs and Esther are within it, while I Maccabees is excluded is sure- ly a decision of men. There are a few, though actually very few, borderline books within and without the canon which were debated and are debatable, but their in- [64]</page><page sequence="5">Progressive Revelation elusion or exclusion can actually change nothing that matters to the faith. On the other hand, the period from Abraham, through Christ, to John on Patmos is a cer- tain definite and unrepeatable segment of history. In and through it the Bible re- veals to us the true God and in so doing the meaning of all human existence. As a result, many people have lived and died, and many institutions have been formed or influenced; and these things are illumined only by what happened then. The Scriptural canon was closed by human decisions as noted above. Yet at the same time in a larger sense it is closed by God himself ; it is normative in the sense that subsequent Christian teaching and teachers are to be understood in its light, and not the other way around. The canon does not give us a complete creedal system that is sufficient for any and every age without theological struggle and involve- ment. Nor does it provide a system of ethics to which no new ethical insight can ever be added. It is nevertheless normative in that it binds me in the Church and through Christ to the true God ; it sharpens my wits to beware of idolatry and to confess my sin of idolatry ; it commands me to love God and my neighbor, though it does not tell me precisely how, other than to give examples of what was once done ; and it so changes and conditions my point of viewing that in company with Goďs people, past and present, I approach our common life with a sense of vocation and destiny. In so doing I encounter faith, love and hope, not as teachable traits of character, but as the goods that are given me by the faithful and loving One. [65]</page></plain_text>
