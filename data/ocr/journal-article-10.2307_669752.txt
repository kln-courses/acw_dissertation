<plain_text><page sequence="1">A Deluge? Which Deluge?: Yet Another Facet of the Problem of the Copper Hoard Culture B. B. LAL Director-General of Archaeology Archaeological Survey of India "Copper hoards" found in the Ganhgd Valley over the past century and a half remain enigmatic. Some attribute them to the invading Aryans, others to the Harappan refugees, and still others to the indigenous people. Be that as it may, circumstantial evidence suggests the association of the hoards with the so-called "Ocher Color Ware," datable to a period prior to c. 1200 B.c. However, at almost all the sites the potsherds occur sporadically, in a deposit of neat earth bereft of any signs of habitation like ash, floor- ing material, or the like, and with the deposit itself imperceptibly merging into the natural soil. How did the sherds find their way to the places where they are found? Could the deposits have been waterlogged? If so, it would mean that an area of over 60,000 square kilometers had gone under water at some time. Was this waterlogging due to incessant rain over a long period, or to the diversion of the waters of the Ghaggar, a tributary of the Indus, to the Ganhgi system, or to the bunding-up of the latter at some stage? The matter is far from clear and requires detailed investigation. BETWEEN 1950 and 1952, the excava- tions at Hastinapura brought to light, from the lowest levels of the site, a ceramic industry called, in the absence of a better name, Ocher Color Ware (Lal 1954 &amp; 1955: 10-11, 23, 31-32). On being handled, the pottery left on the fingers an ocherous color, hence the provisional name. The sherds had sometimes a greyish core, indicating that at least some of the pots had not been well fired. Being fragmentary, these sherds gave only a partial clue to the shapes, the most notewor- thy type, however, being a vase with a flaring rim. On the basis of the stratigraphic prece- dence of the Ocher Color Ware over Painted Gray Ware, an end point of c. 1200 B.c. was suggested for the former. Pottery having a family likeness with the Ocher Color Ware has since been found at many sites in the valleys of the Galigd, Yamund, and their tributaries (Fig. 1). The more noteworthy amongst these sites are Bahadrabad (Lat. 290 55' N, Long. 78" 0' E), 13 km southwest of Hardwar, Dis- trict Saharanpur; Nasirpur (Lat. 290 48' N, Long. 770 55' E), about a kilometer south of Manglaur, District Saharanpur; Gad- harona (Lat. 29' 42' N, Long. 770 55' E), 12 km southeast of Roorkee, District Saharan- pur; Jhinjhana (Lat. 290 30' N, Long. 77* 10' E), 8 km northwest of Shamli, District Muzaffarnagar; Ahichchhatra (Lat. 28' 22' N, Long. 790 7' E), north of Aonla, District Bareilly; Atranji-khera (Lat. 270 42' N, Long. 780 41' E), 16 km north of Etah-all in Uttar Pradesh; and Noh (Lat. 270 15' N, Long. 770 30' E), about 7 km west of Bha- ratpur, a District headquarters in Rajasthan. As at Hastindpura, so also at these places only potsherds (never complete pots) were found, although at certain sites, for example at Bahadrabad and Atranji-khera, their fre- quency was somewhat more than that at Hastinspura. The additional data have con- firmed the occasional use of a red slip, sus- pected in the case of the Hastinspura ex- amples (Lal 1954 &amp; 1955:11). At Atranji- khera an example has been found suggesting that at least some of the pots bore painted designs in a black pigment (Government of India 1965/66: 1-83). From the same site also comes evidence that a good many pots carried incised designs (Government of India 1963/64: 45-47). Typologically, the addi- tion of the dish-on-stand and lid with a cen- tral knob, and of handles and channel-like spouts, is noteworthy. However, in spite of this further information our picture of Ocher Color Ware is far from complete. At Bahadrabad (Krishnaswami 1953:71) the Ocher Color Ware was found in a deposit in which the canal diggers had earlier found Accepted for publication May 6, 1968. 857</page><page sequence="2">858 American Anthropologist [70, 1968 SITES OF ......... ..

Which Deluge? 859 The identity of these copper hoard people has been a matter of debate. Several years ago Professor Stuart Piggott suggested that the hoards might represent Harappan refu- gees, moving eastwards from the Indus basin as a result of barbarian inroads from west- ern Asia (Piggott 1950:238). The view that the copper hoard people might be Harappans has since been reasserted, this time on the basis of: (1) an apparent similarity of some pottery-types in Ocher Color Ware with those in Harappan ware; and (2) the find of a fragmentary anthropomorphic figure (a con- stituent of the copper hoards) at the Harap- pan site of Lothal (Sharma 1964:12-13). No doubt these are significant pointers but the evidence on the whole cannot be re- garded as conclusive. For, in the first place, as already stated earlier, we still do not have a complete picture of the Ocher Color Ware itself, which makes it difficult to assess fully its Harappan affiliation. Secondly, just as the Persian Gulf seal, found at Lothal, cannot be regarded as forming a constituent of the Harappa culture, the single anthropo- morphic figure also need not necessarily be- long to that culture. It may as easily have found its way to Lothal as a result of con- tacts between the Harappan and the copper hoard peoples. According to Professor R. Heine Geld- ern, the copper hoards represent "the ar- chaeological traces of the Vedic Aryans" (1936, 1937). This view was also held by Professor Piggott for some time (1944), but was later given up in favor of the Harappan refugee thesis, already referred to. I have suggested yet another possibility, namely that the hoards might be the products of an indigenous people occupying the Gafig&amp; Val- ley (1951). The honest fact is that we all are groping in the dark; the reason: the pau- city of evidence available. Be that as it may, the purpose of the present paper is to place before archeolo- gists and allied workers an altogether differ- ent aspect of the problem. At Hastindpura (Lal 1954 &amp; 1955:10-11) the sherds of Ocher Color Ware were found in a very hard de- posit of brown earth. In this deposit there was no ash, no flooring, nor any of the other signs one usually comes across in a regular habitational stratum. The frequency, too, of the sherds was very limited. One stroke of the big pickaxe might turn up not more than a couple of sherds; in fact, often there was none. The sherds occurred sporad- ically to a depth of about half a meter in the brown earth, which continued downward, merging imperceptibly into the natural soil. It was also observed that the upper part, 10-15 cm in thickness, of the brown earth was darker than that below it, which might indicate that the top of this deposit re- mained exposed for a long time before the site was occupied by the succeeding Painted Gray Ware people. At Bahadrabad (Krishnaswami 1953: 71), the copper objects as well as the pottery came from a deposit that lay about 6 meters below the general ground level- with no mound formation whatsoever. This overlying deposit consisted of sand, pebbles, and earth. The stratum that yielded the pot- tery and the copper hoard was about a meter in thickness and consisted of hard brownish earth. Available accounts show that there was no floor level or any similar sign indicative of a regular occupation. Several years ago copper objects had been recovered from Nasirpur-celts, a harpoon, a hooked spearhead, etc.-which are now lodged at the Gurukul Kangri University Museum, near Hardwar. A recent examina- tion of the locality showed that there was no habitational layer as such, but the natural- looking, yellowish-brown earth did contain sherds that, on the basis of their color and texture, may be regarded as belonging to the same general family of the so-called Ocher Color Ware. The sherds were found to occur sporadically and down to a depth of about 11/2 meters below the general ground-level. Jhinjhana has not so far yielded any cop- per objects, but the section at this site is quite important. As at Hastin5pura, so also here, the deposit bearing the Ocher Color Ware underlay the one yielding Painted Gray Ware, and the two stood in marked contrast to each other. Thus, while the Painted Gray Ware came from regular occupational layers with floors and habitational debris, including ash, charcoal, etc., the Ocher Color Ware oc- curred in a deposit of brown earth devoid of any ash, charcoal, or floor-material (Fig. 2). The sherds, too, did not lie in any orderly</page><page sequence="4">860 American Anthropologist [70, 1968 W:w, X? A-- .... . . ... .. FIGURE 2. Jhinjhana: section showing the contrast between the deposits yielding Ocher Color Ware (lower half) and Painted Gray Ware (upper half). fashion, forming, for example, a layer, but occurred sporadically. In this manner they went down to a depth of about one and a quarter meters. The soil itself showed some interesting features. The uppermost 10-15 cm strip was dark in color. An examination</page><page sequence="5">LAL] A Deluge? Which Deluge? 861 of it was clearly called for, as it might re- veal humic contents, suggesting that the top remained exposed for quite some time be- fore the arrival of the Painted Gray Ware people. The next lower strip, about 30 cm in thickness, was lighter in color than the ones above or below it. Maybe it was leached in the course of time-a guess that is being checked through a chemical examination. Lastly, there was no hard and fast demarca- tion between the soil yielding the pottery and the one below it, although lower down kankars (nodules of calcium carbonate) began to make their appearance. At Gadharona, the sherds of the Ocher Color Ware were picked up very near the surface, from a matrix of sand and silt (Fig. 3). However, as the site seems to have un- dergone subsequent disturbance, it is diffi- cult to say whether the sherds lay in their original matrix or whether they had been displaced and subsequently re-embedded in the present deposit. The story at Achichchhatr&amp; is similar to that at Hastinapura and Jhinjhana. Thus, here too, below the Painted Gray Ware strata lay a hard brown earth in which sherds of the Ocher Color Ware occurred sporadically, up to a depth of about 60 cm (Government of India 1964/65). This deposit continued even lower, though without the sherds. All through, the brown earth did not contain any ash, charcoal, or other material indica- tive of a regular habitation. At Atranji-khera the Painted Gray Ware strata were underlain by a 15 to 40 cm de- Figure 3. Gadharona: sherd of Ocher Color Ware embedded in a matrix of sand and silt. posit containing Black-and-Red Ware, and it was below this that the Ocher Color Ware oc- curred (Government of India 1963/64:45- 47). The deposit yielding the last-named pottery varied from 0.8 to 1.5 meters in thickness and consisted of yellowish brown earth mixed with kankar. There were no signs of any regular habitation. The sequence at Noh (Government of India 1964/65) is identical with that at Atranjikhera, for here too the Black-and-Red Ware intervened between the Painted Gray and Ocher Color Wares. The sherds of the last-named ware lay sparsely in a matrix of brownish earth that merged into the natural soil. The deposit was devoid of ash, charcoal, floor material, etc. The preceding account presents a more or less uniform picture from all the sites, namely that the Ocher Color Ware occurred in a deposit of earth, varying from yellowish brown to dark brown in color, often mixed with kankar and usually hard in texture, which did not contain any flooring substance or ash or charcoal or for that matter any other object indicative of the layer having been a regular habitational one. If this be so, a query arises as to how the earth came to be deposited and how the sherds found their way into it. The absence of habita- tional symptoms precludes human agency, unless it is argued that the earth was rammed down by human beings for some purpose and that the sherds came in along with it. This might seem to be all right theo- retically, but sounds somewhat unrealistic, particularly when the same pattern is re- peated at so many sites, located far away from one another. Thus, one has to look for some other explanation. At the moment, the following possibilities suggest themselves. There could, obviously, be many more. The simplest explanation would be that the soil, a naturally laid one, developed fis- sures, like those occurring in the black cot- ton-soil of central India and the Deccan, and that the sherds, which had been lying about on the ground, found their way into it through the fissures. Such an explanation, however, would involve at least two assump- tions, namely that (1) this soil is capable of developing fissures, and even very deep fis- sures, for the sherds have been found down to a depth of about 1V2 meters from the top, and (2) there was some settlement in the</page><page sequence="6">862 American Anthropologist [70, 1968 neighborhood, the inhabitants of which left the sherds on the surface, say while plowing the field or in some other way. On the first assumption the present writer is not compe- 'tent to comment. All that he can say is that he has not seen this soil develop such fis- .sures-maybe its sand content prevents it from so doing. The second assumption re- quires the existence, in each case, of a regu- lar settlement of the Ocher Color Ware peo- ple somewhere in the neighborhood. As in this hypothesis the settlement site is not thought to have been affected in any way, it should still be available. The writer, how- ever, has come across no such site. If the above is not the likely explanation, what else would be? At my request, Dr. B. B. Lal, Chief Archaeological Chemist, Archaeo- logical Survey of India, and his colleagues have undertaken a detailed study of soil samples from Hastinspura, Jhinjhana, Ahich- chhatrd, Nasirpur and Atranji-khera. Their preliminary investigations suggest that the de- posits may have been water laid. Professor Fakhruddin Ahmad, Head of the Department of Geology, Aligarh Muslim University, and his colleagues, who independently examined the soil samples from Atranji-khera, are, ac- cording to the excavators, of the view that "the area had been flooded by the river and remained waterlogged for a considerable pe- riod, which may explain the absence of the lusual habitation marks" (Gaur &amp; Hasan 1964: 5-6). Now, if a flood is to be invoked to ex- plain the nature of the deposit at Atranji- khera, the same will have to be done in the ,case of the rest of the sites. This would in- volve the flooding of almost the whole of the ?upper basin of the Gafig&amp;, Yamun&amp; and their tributaries. From Bahadrabad in the north to Noh in the south is a distance of about 300 km, and from the longitude of Jhinjhana in the west to that of Ahichchhatr&amp; in the east measures about 200 km. And if, on examina- tion, similar deposits are found at the copper hoard sites further downstream, the flood will have to be nothing less than a "deluge." Assuming for a moment that this turns out to be the case, one would naturally look for the causes of the deluge. Among various possibilities the following three may have to be considered. (1) Incessant rain for a sufficiently long period might cause sheet flooding of the en- tire basin, because of the limited draining capacity of the plain and also of the rivers, which do not have a steep gradient.' In such an event the settlements would be sub- merged, and while the lighter material, like ash, charcoal, etc., would float away, heavier articles like pottery, "copper hoards," and the like, would no doubt get mixed up with the muddy soil but would resettle in more or less the same area, without being carried far away. (2) The flooding of the Upper Gafigd- Yamund basin could also have occurred if, through some tectonic movement, a barrier was created across the river system some- where lower down, such as, for example, has been postulated by Raikes (1965) for the flooding of the lower Indus basin, involv- ing Mohenjo-daro. If it were a barrier of earth, it would soon be broken through by the waters and the deluge would be short- lived, but long enough to produce the kind of pottery-mixed strata referred to above. Or, a less drastic explanation might be that local tectonic movements led to widespread changes in the courses of the Gafigd, Yamun, and their upper tributaries, resulting in wide- spread flooding. (3) In a third possibility, one has to ima- gine a tectonic movement involving the di- vide between the Indus and Gafigi systems, say somewhere near the source, where the Ghaggar and YamunA basins come close to each other (Fig. 1). Such a possibility comes to mind because we must also account for the drying up of the Ghaggar, which could have resulted from the diversion of some of its tributaries to a neighboring system, in this case that of the YamunA. In this context it may not be out of place to mention two points. First, if the desertion of the Harappan site of Kalibangan is to be attributed to the drying up of the Ghaggar, as is not altogether unlikely, the latter event would have to be placed broadly in the first half of the second millennium B.C. (Lal 1962 &amp; 1963: 212, 219). Secondly, the occurrence of the an- thropomorphic figure, even though frag- mentary, in the late levels of Phase IV at Lothal shows that the copper hoard culture was in existence in the first quarter of the second millennium B.C. (Lal 1962 &amp; 1963: 220). Thus, at least from the chronological</page><page sequence="7">LAL] A Deluge? Which Deluge? 863 point of view an interrelation between the drying up of the Ghaggar and the flooding of the copper hoard sites may not be altogether incompatible. Looking at ancient Indian literature and tradition, one finds that the Purdnas refer to two floods. The earlier of these occurred on a very large scale, covering vast territories and causing wholesale destruction.2 Manu is said to have been the only survivor, from whom descended the later kings of ancient India. The later flood is described as having been of a somewhat limited nature, con- fined to parts of the Gafig&amp; only, in which was destroyed the city of Hastindpura dur- ing the reign of Nichakshu (Pargiter 1913: 5, 65). It would, however, be premature to go into further details about these floods or to try to correlate either of them with the flooding of the Ocher Color Ware sites, for the flooding itself has yet to be duly estab- lished. The reader must have noticed that this paper is full of ifs and buts, hypotheses and super-hypotheses; and, for all one knows, the whole thing may turn out to be mere fantasy. One can even question the very wis- dom of producing such an article. However, the writer felt obliged to reduce to print cer- tain ideas that have been coming to his mind for some time past, and, in fact, many of the sites, for example Jhinjhana and Na- sirpur, were especially investigated by him for the purpose. Thus, he would regard his little labor amply rewarded if-again an if -this article attracts the attention of geolo- gists and hydrologists whose active help, by way of field investigations, the archeologist would very much welcome.
