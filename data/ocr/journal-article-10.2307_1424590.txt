Anthony Alofsin is Associate Chairman of the Division of Historic Preservation, Graduate School of Architecture and Planning, Columbia University. He is also working on a Doctorate at Columbia in the Department of Art History and Archaeology. He received his M. Arch. from the Harvard Graduate School of Design. The study of architecture today involves an increasing awareness of its historical prece- dents. The history of architecture has been pur- sued primarily by scholars through the study of buildings, events, and personalities. Another course of investigation, less often followed, is how and by whom the history of architecture has been taught in the past. The attitudes of teachers and students ultimately change the content of the history of architecture by affecting the choice of buildings, events, and people sub- jected to research. Analysis of approaches and methods of teaching and how they change over successive generations may inform students about contemporary attitudes toward the history of architecture. An examination of teaching and teachers also connects the student to the tradi- tions of the profession; a student's training becomes part of a changing continuum of efforts to clarify the meaning and making of architecture. In studying the history of teaching the history of architecture one legacy is found in the example of Herbert Langford Warren, the founder of the Harvard School of Architecture in 1893 (fig. 1).1 This paper may serve as an introduction to War- ren, the origin of his pedagogical ideas, and the general content of his courses. It will conclude with a summary of Warren's attempt to adapt his methods to the stylistic conflicts in architec- ture at the tumrn of the century. Formation Warren was the product of diverse cultural backgrounds: his father was an American of New England colonial ancestry, his mother was from Bridenorth, Shropshire, England. Warren was bom on March 29, 1857, in Manchester, England. At the age of twelve he accompanied his father to Germany where he attended the venerable gymnasia at Gotha and Dresden. His facility with the German language would later allow him to rely in his teaching on the work of German scholars. Furthermore, Warren's expo- sure at the gymnasia to the atmosphere of Ger- man nineteenth century philosophy must have created a receptivity to the concepts of Kultur- geschichte and Zeitgeist in which culture is inte- gral with history and art. In 1874 at the age of fourteen Warren retumrned from the gymnasia and attended Owens College in Manchester, England, for four years. There were no architecture courses offered in the Gothic revival buildings at Owens with the exception of a course in drawing and watercolor by William Walker, a student of J. D. Harding who had been John Ruskin's teacher. It is prob- able that Warren pursued his interests in archi- tecture on his own and absorbed the thought of Owen Jones whose Grammar of Ornament had been published in 1856 (fig. 2).2 Jones attempted to show with examples of decorative design that forms of beauty exist in every style-an attitude similar to Warren's-and that a limited number of rules of nature form the basis of beauty. According to Jones, creativity springs from these rules without the need of imitation; Warren would have shared this idea and many of Jones's propositions on design, particularly the second proposition: "Architecture is the material expression of the wants, the faculties, and the sentiments of the age in which it is created. Style in Architecture is the peculiar form expression takes under the influence of climate and materials at com- mand. "3 After Owens College Warren worked briefly as a draftsman for Manchester architect William Dawes. He then moved with his family to the United States in 1876 where from 1877 to 1879 he continued his studies at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.4 In the same year, at the age of twenty-two, he entered the office- atelier of Henry Hobson Richardson, where he worked for five years until 1884. Warren learned the craft of architecture under Richardson and became one of his chief office assistants. He worked on a number of important Richardson buildings including the town hall at North Eas- ton, Aubumdale Station, Austin Hall at Harvard, and he executed facade drawings for the rectory of Trinity Church in Boston (fig. 3).5 Fall, 1983 JAE</page><page sequence="2">0 Warren was not only in the company of exciting young architects, including Stanford White, but in proximity to Richardson's extraordinary library. Open to the staff at all free hours, it con- tained the study materials whose perusal was encouraged in the educational atmosphere of Richardson's office. One of Richardson's assis- tants described the library as "a magic source of inspiration" where pupils "occasionally lay in blissful repose, reveling in the resources of the land of dreams."6 A number of those volumes would become ref- erences for Warren's courses and writing. One set of books was Lbonce Reynaud's Trait6 d'Ar- chitecture, the most substantial mid-nineteenth century French manual of architectural theory (fig. 4). A precursor of Viollet-le-Duc's Entre- tiens sur L'Architecture, it exemplified the tradi- tion of the rational expression of structure. Rey- naud's theory held that commodity was the first consideration of architecture--"Architecture is born of material needs" -and that within the limits of possible functional solutions, taste must decide which solution was most beautiful.7 Other references would include Perrot and Chi- piez's series, Histoire de I'Art (1882-1914), and Martha's Manuel d'Archdologic Etrusque et Romain (1884). In the midst of such literary resources and the flourishing production of Richardson's office Warren, however, was somewhat out of place. Charles Allerton Coolidge, Warren's colleague at the time, later remarked: "I always had the feeling that Warren was a Goth at heart, and yet the work at Richardson's office was Romanesque. It was quite interesting to see how by purely intellectual processes he pro- duced such good Romanesque drawings."'8 During the last years of his stay at Richardson's office, Warren's Gothic heart must have been deeply touched by his exposure to the circle of Charles Eliot Norton (b. 1827-d. 1908) at Har- vard. Norton was Professor of the History of Art at Harvard from 1875 to 1898, and was one of the most important 'men of letters' of the period. Warren took courses as a special stu- dent in fine arts under Norton, and they later became colleagues. When Warren, in his writ- ings, charged architecture with the responsibility of elevating the spirit of youth and training taste, one recalls the words of Norton: "Fine architecture [is] an influence in the educa- tion of youth through its power to quicken poetic sensibility and imagination ... [It] is the expression of a nation's highest moral aspira- tion."9 Norton followed Ruskin in matters of architec- ture; they were both proponents of the Gothic. When Ruskin extolled the Oxford Natural History Museum of 1855, Norton lent his support with favorable reviews in the Atlantic Monthly. When Ruskin tumrned away from architecture, Norton pursued his nascent interest in classical art and culture. It was during this period that Warren came under Norton's direct influence, although he may have read Norton's Historic Studies of Church Buildings in the Middle Ages-Venice, Siena, and Florence (1880) as well as Ruskin's Stones of Venice (both of which were also in Richardson's library). Although Warren had a strong affinity with the Gothic and described it in structural terms as did another member of the Norton circle, Charles Herbert Moore, he avoided the rigid extremes that resulted from Moore's logical expansion of the principles of Viollet-le-Duc. Other influences in the Norton sphere, briefly mentioned, were Russell Sturgis, the Gothicist editor of A Dictionary of Architecture and Build- ing (1901-1902) for whom Warren wrote on the architecture of southwest France, and Den- man Waldo Ross whose empirical work in color theory and abstract design provided the theoreti- cal basis of Warren's design courses.10 Finally, before beginning his teaching career, Warren had the opportunity to synthesize these influences in buildings that he designed and built. He opened his own office in 1885 after a year's travel in Europe, and it remained in oper- ation throughout his life. Although Warren's teaching of design used the language of classi- cal architecture, because its best examples had "simplicity and directness [and] excellent propor- tions,""11 his own commissions were in a style that expressed Gothic architecture. The relation- ship of his theory to his work, such as the Church of the New Jerusalem, Cambridge, Mass., of 1901 (fig. 5) and his orphanage at Troy, New York, of 1900, is outside the scope of discussion here. But it is clear that Warren's experience with architectural practice gave tangi- bility to the dictates of his rationalism, thus his experience in building affected his teaching. PI.

Fall, 1983 JAE</page><page sequence="3">u Teaching When Warren, at the age of thirty-six, founded Harvard's first school of architecture he brought with him the experience of a practitioner trained on two continents, an immersion in nineteenth century architectural traditions, and an interest in the theory of teaching architecture. In an effort to state explicit requirements for the proper study of the history of architecture, War- ren outlined three tenets: 1) that certain great principles underlie the best architecture of all styles; 2) that "great architecture expresses the needs of its own time"; and 3) that "form has developed as an expression of structure and through the working out by architects and craftsman [of] the problems of their own day in direct fashion."'12 In both the official school bulletins and in an article on architectural education at Harvard writ- ten shortly after the School of Architecture moved into the newly-built Robinson Hall in 1902,13 Warren described his teaching program: "Architecture is essentially a Fine Art, the practice of which must be based on a thorough know- ledge of construction. Great stress has therefore been laid on continued practice in design and drawing and through instruction in the history and principles of the Fine Art of Architecture and the arts allied to it.Y'14 With respect to the history of architecture, War- ren said it would serve many purposes. It would be the corrective to a hollow mimicry of history and allow the progressive use of the basic prin- ciples of architecture. It would bring students into intimate contact with great works of beauty that would cultivate taste. And it would encour- age students to feel intuitively that a sense of beauty in all the arts leads to an alliance with the spirit of history and the rejection of imitation. Consequently, for Warren "the formation of taste is one of the most important tasks which the schools of architecture have to set them- selves. "15 Warren's theoretical viewpoint, then, was syn- thetic: he defined architecture as a fine art whose greatest works express civilization, trans- form its citizens, and observe the practical necessities of building and the requirements of human need. The application of his theory was found in the history courses that were the center of the school's curriculum. In the early years of the school, each history course had three lectures weekly and the series, covering Antique, Medi- eval, and Renaissance architecture, extended over three years. In addition to attending lec- tures, students were required to draw architec- tural elements, occasionally to present written reports, and read works from a published bibliography (fig. 6). Of the twenty-seven references to be used in Warren's courses ten would be by Germanic authors.16 Texts for the courses included works by the German historians of architecture, Kolde- way and Puchstein, DOrm, B1tticher, Essen- wein, and BOhlman. In general, these writers either followed one of two traditions or com- bined aspects of both. One tradition emphasized the expression of building structure as a rational method of design. The other tradition was clas- sicizing, and its adherents advocated the study and emulation of Greek architecture.7 The concept of the integration of culture and architecture was presented in the books of Jacob Burckhardt, the Swiss historian of the Renaissance. Burckhardt's Der Cicerone and Der Geschichte der Renaissance in Italien were prin- cipal reference texts for Warren's course in Renaissance architecture. They were to be read in German, although English translations of the latter existed. Foundations The only compendium of Warren's lectures is The Foundations of Classic Architecture, pub- lished posthumously in 1919 with an introduc- tion by Fiske Kimball.'" It comprises the lectures of the course "Architecture la, The Technical and Historic Development of Ancient Styles with Specific References to Classic Architecture." The course content, as reflected in his book, included discussions of the history and the architecture of Egypt, Mesopotamia, Persia, the Aegean, and Greece to which Warren devoted one half of his text. Warren's basic approach provided a cultural and historical background for architecture, with par- ticular emphasis on the influence of one civiliza- tion on another. For instance, he discusses the cultures and architectures that influenced ancient Greece and then Greek culture itself. Before ana- lyzing Greek temples, however, he explains the elements of Greek architecture. He starts with moldings, "those universal and eternal elements in the language of architectural form" whose purpose is "to connect, to articulate, and to clearly express the members to which they are attached or between which they are placed." Warren grouped moldings according to func- tion, their purpose being "to aid in the poetic expression of structure."'g The role of the orders followed, and in discuss- ing them Warren continued a debate current in the nineteenth century on the origins of the Doric order.2 He calls upon the authority of Viollet-le-Duc to support his contention that unlike the lonic order the Doric is a stone form, uniquely evolved, and not a transformation from pre-existing wooden elements." According to Warren, purity of origin implied a distinct devel- opment of elements arising from primary needs; it is central to great architecture as seen in that other self-sprung architecture, the Gothic. Fur- thermore, the Doric order perfectly expressed both its material and its system of construction. In addition to elements and orders Warren also described proportion, the other essential prop- erty of classical architecture. He approached absolute proportions, however, with caution, and he advocated a method suggested by the theorist and architect Gottfried Semper (b. 1803-d. 1879) as a clear way of comparing general proportions. Semper's analysis of tem- ple facades consisted of comparing drawn rec- tangles formed by a horizontal line at the top of the stylobate, the vertical axes of the outer cen- tral columns at the temple's front facade, and the horizontal line at the top of the geison (fig. 7). The "norm," or "normal rectangle" as Semper called it, allowed for the comparison of entire facades.2 Upon concluding these extensive preliminaries, Warren proceeded to the buildings themselves. First he discussed the general cultural context of the period, and then gave a brief history of the building and its site. He next summarized the relevant archaeological evidence and then described the building's proportions, details, and decoration. The denouement of architectural history, then, took the form of a chronological discussion of buildings that followed this method; emphasis was on the tectonic meaning of the building's parts and their visual relation- ship to the whole building. Fall, 1983 JAE</page><page sequence="4">I When Warren applied his method to the archi- tecture of the Romans, he emphasized their technical innovatons in vaulting and their ability to plan on an immense scale. John Taylor Boyd, Jr., one of Warren's students, recalled Warren's approach to Roman and Renaissance architecture. According to Boyd, Warren showed how the Romans borrowed architecture from Hellenic Greece; Warren "accomplished the paradox of taking away from the Romans what little credit some of their hostile critics allowed them, yet leaving them with more credit than most of their admirers claimed for them."9 In his appraisal of the Renaissance Warren avoided the extremes of both negative criticism and praise. Although he considered the unsuc- cessful imitations of Renaissance architects "the reflections of a reflection of a reflection,"24 he saw much to admire in the early Renaissance buildings of Florence and other northern Italian city-states with creative art guilds. For Warren the High Renaissance work of Raphael in his sketches for St. Peter's, the uncompleted Villa Madama, and the work of Peruzzi held promise as noble as any other style. But Warren pro- posed that much of the architecture following the work of Raphael and Peruzzi hardened into mechanical, arbitrary forms and formulae, "that first deadened, then debased the style into Rococo extravagances."925 Warren's approach to Medieval architecture was consistent as seen in the manuscript notebooks of Kenneth John Conant for Warren's lectures in 1914-1915.26 Warren began his Medieval course by setting Romanesque and Gothic buildings in a historical and cultural context with individual monuments organized by both region and style. The central theme in Conant's course notes is the evolution of structure as seen, for instance, in Warren's remarks on the structural unification of the choir and nave at St. Gall. Concern with structure at Abbot Suger's choir of St. Denis, however, appears to exclude any observations of innovative lighting effects and their rapturous sensuality. In summation, Warren exposed his students to a method instruction that established a cultural- historical setting, discussed buildings as part of a tradition that either adhered to or deviated from models, and analyzed them in terms of expression of construction, materials, and a visual appropriateness whose highest synthesis was the aesthetic realm common to all the arts.

Ives, Dream City. n.p. The mastering of classical detail and elements was emphasized both as historical precedents and in actual execution as a malleable source of contemporary design vocabulary. Teaching with this method and a belief in rational ideas expressed in a traditional vocabu- lary would itself have been a considerable accomplishment, but Warren went beyond this synthesis. In the decades surrounding the turn of the century when the Harvard School of Architecture began, conflict re-emerged between two fundamental architectural traditions, one identified with a rationalist orientation, the other based on an appeal to ancient authority and anthropomorphism. In 1893, the first year that Warren offered his history courses in classical architecture, the Columbian Exposition at Chi- cago took place (fig. 8); Gothic and classic styles were at war in a struggle that had begun in the Renaissance.27 By 1894 a sufficient num- ber of Americans had retumrned from training at the Ecole des Beaux Arts in Paris that they formed a Society of Beaux Arts Architects.28 Suddenly it seemed that in America the French academic influence had overwhelmed the Gothic-rationalist tradition. In 1899 Henry Van Brunt recalled his thoughts on the controversial Memorial Hall project at Harvard that he and William Ware had designed and built from 1865 to 1878: "[The drawings for Memorial Hall] were made at a time when the fever of the Modem Gothic experiment was at its height. It was a style which at the time we were persuaded was the only one having life and progressive power ... If I were called up to design a great monument for a similar purpose I am entirely persuaded that under new impulses which now prevail, the building would assume other characteristics, recognizing possibly classic and academic influ- ences which not only would make it a more accurate exponent of the spirit of contemporary civilization . . . but would perhaps give it a bet- ter chance for permanent recognition as a work of art .. ."29 In the same year in a speech to the American Institute of Architects in Pittsburgh, Warren spoke directly about the conflict in architecture.3? He acknowledged the considerable American debt to the Ecole and outlined the principal strengths of its training and practice: its insis- tence on composition, its excellence of propor- tions and mass, and particularly its mastery of monumental planning. On the one hand, he felt that the Ecole had formerly taught that a build- ing should express its purpose and produce one rhythmic whole from inside to outside in an architecture based on principles. On the other hand, Warren felt that training at the Ecole had begun to be limited to the teaching of ornament accompanied by a desire for sensation from "a jaded and sated palate (fig. 9)."31 As a result the excesses of the Ecole were interfering in the development of the American public's taste in art. Warren advised the American architectural profession to be discriminating and to reduce its reliance on the Ecole in order to allow the devel- opment of a truly American architecture. The French influence grew as other schools, such as MIT and Columbia, embraced the Beaux Arts method. In 1914 Geoffrey Scott pub- lished The Architecture of Humanism, A Study in the History of Taste. His fluid prose further undermined a tradition that had emphasized a rational architecture and its constructional logic. By this time Warren, however, had pulled off something of a coup. Through the debate he perceived that some recent graduates of the Ecole were being trained-under the influence of theoretician Julian Guadet-to be more sen- sitive to the needs of society and to acknowl- edge principles of construction, circulation, and program in designs that grew from interior spaces to the exterior. Such an orientation was sympathetic with Warren's precepts, and he succeeded in bringing to Harvard in 1912 Eugene-Joseph-Armand Duquesne, a member of the new breed. Duquesne had worked under Guadet in the same atmosphere as Tony Gar- nier,32 and Duquesne's Eglise Votive won the Prix de Rome over Gamier in 1897.33 Duquesne's approach combined the art of build- ing with a tradition of the appreciation of beauti- ful form and detail. His own views of teaching architecture reflected Warren's philosophy: "Architecture is thus at the same time a fine art and a science, a fine art by invention, combina- tion, and foresight, a science by analysis and the rigor of verification. Consequently, art with- out science is insufficient, just as science with- out art is sterile."34 Warren succeeded in bringing together opposing attitudes first in his courses by searching for principles in every style. Then, by bringing Duquesne to Harvard to teach design he attempted to unite basic approaches to architec- ture: the rational expression of structure, avoid- ance of excessive omament, and incorporation of plan principles of the Ecole des Beaux Arts. He, thus, intended that the teaching of history and design create a whole. This union of princi- ples, however, was short-lived. After only two years of successful teaching at Harvard, Duquesne was called back to France at the out- break of World War 1. Herbert Langford Warren died not long after on June 27, 1917, exhausted at the age of sixty by his dedication to the school he founded and the country he adopted.5 We have looked in a summary way at Warren's intellectual formation, the general content of his courses in architectural history, and how he attempted to transcend the dogma of the period that thrust a classicizing style against a gothicis- ing style. This look, however, hardly does War- ren's contribution justice. In the future, students may want to examine in greater depth how War- ren's views of architecture differed from the views of his contemporaries, and how Warren ranked among other theorists and teachers of the period. Further inquiry is also needed to see the differences between Warren's proposed study of the past and its application to contem- porary buildings. Student projects executed under Warren could be compared to the work of other students and practitioners. Warren's own buildings could provide a focus in themselves as they reflect the built evidence of how his theory affected his designs." Despite the limits of this discussion, hopefully one aspect of Warren's contribution is clear: he sought to analyze conflicting ideologies and extract their viable principles in architecture and unite them in his teaching. Within twenty years of his death the role of courses in the history of architecture would be radically altered, an altera- tion brought about both by the dominance of a Modemrnist movement rooted partly in some of the structural rationalist traditions that Warren shared and by a decay within the teaching of the history of architecture itself. The clash of fundamental traditions is no less poignant now than in Warren's era. In contem- porary architecture the expression of building structure has been challenged by teachers and practitioners who advocate the expression of architectural elements that have meanings inde- pendent of rationally derived form. A student today is challenged to develop a synthesizing vision and to see continuity where it exists. Her- bert Langford Warren sought to extract princi- ples from conflicting traditions. His success may have been too brief.

Norton edited in 1864-68, with John Russell Lowell, the North American Review and was a founder in 1865 of the Nation. 10 The influence of John Ruskin in the Department of Fine Arts at Harvard was strong and in several instances direct. Charles Herbert Moore (b. 1840-d. 1930), who was the first director of the Fogg Museum, had studied with Ruskin in 1876-77. Moore followed Viollet-le-Duc's interest in architecture as the rational expression of structure, and Moore's Development and Character of Gothic Architecture (1890) was a slap at what he saw as sentimental tenets of the Gothic Revival. For Moore no notable buildings in the Gothic style existed beyond the lie St. Louis in Paris; Renaissance architecture was full of disparate ideas and constructional illogic. The Harvard setting of Warren's teaching occurred in the context of the work of Charles Eliot Norton, who provided a literary tradition of Ruskinian precepts, Charles Herbert Moore, who provided a practical basis in drawing as well as a distinct architectural ideology, and Denman Waldo Ross (b. 1853-d. 1935) whose approach to aesthetics and design was empirical. Ross believed that an understanding of the orderly relationships in color and their discrimination by a viewer was necessary in the critical perception of painting. By applying Ross's principles of design in the decorative arts to architecture Warren instituted the teaching of an abstract the- ory of architecture as distinct from the applied teaching of design or history. 11 Warren, Herbert Langford "The Study of Architectural His- tory" Architectural Quarterly of Harvard University, Vol. I no. 2 (1912), p. 42. 12 Warren ibid p. 43. 13 Warren, Herbert Langford "Architectural Education at Harvard University," Harvard Engineering Journal Vol. I no. 2 (June 1902), pp. 76-87. 14 Official Register of the Department of Architecture, Harvard University (Cambridge, Mass.) 1902.
