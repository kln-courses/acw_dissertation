<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> Ruth Page University of Leicester Response to Target Essay on Social Minds:  A Contextualist Perspective Let me begin by stating that although I am not in sympathy with much work produced  by the cognitive turn in poetics, narratology and literary criticism, I find much to  commend in Palmer’s concept of social minds. The examination of the ways in  which shared patterns of thought are represented as collective, synergistic entities  — what Palmer calls social minds — is a much needed antidote to the internalist  emphasis in at least some streams of cognitive narratology. Indeed, Palmer’s  championing of the externalist position is a welcome signal that alludes to one of  the key weaknesses of much existing cognitive narratology and poetics: namely, its  treatment of context. Cognitive narratology emerged within a broader contextualist  reaction to structuralist narratology (Herman), but, as Shen points out, the focus on  modelling an idealised reader’s mental processes has led cognitive narratology to  focus on generic contexts rather than varied, actual sociohistorical contexts (157).  In combination with an internalist perspective, the ahistorical, agendered treatment  of context and a repeated reliance on modelled reader response rather than empirical  analysis has created a gap between cognitive narratology and other streams of  narrative criticism which attend to the specific and ideological situations in which  literary texts are produced and received. The concept of social minds thus offers  to enrich existing cognitive narratology and to bridge the gap between cognitive  and other kinds of contextually oriented literary analysis. There are always risks entailed when gaps are to be breached, especially when  perspectives on either side of the divide are embedded in differing research traditions,  methods and terminology. The question of context and the part this might play in  determining social minds is a case in point. Context is a multifaceted, fuzzy concept.  This polyvalency is at once a strength (enabling connection between different  fields of work), yet also a source of potential misunderstanding. A sociolinguistic  or ethnographic treatment of context might look very different from the factors  considered relevant in cognitive narratology. On one level, different applications  of contextual material in the process of textual interpretation might not matter very  much at all. Different kinds of questions require different means of reaching an  292 Style: Volume 45, No. 2, Summer 2011 </page> <page sequence="2"> A Contextualist Perspective 293 answer. But if the concept of social minds is to achieve the kind of interdisciplinary  potential it promises, then further reflection on this point is needed. I raise thi,  because Palmer’s claim for the centrality of social minds in fiction is predicated  on its parallel significance to “real social minds” and our engagement with “the  actual world” (1, emphasis added). The relationship between textual and actual  minds might be developed in a number of further directions, including, but not  limited to, expanding an idealised readership (the “we” to whom Palmer refers, 7,  17, 23) to incorporate the responses of actual readers from different sociohistorical  contexts and critical perspectives and make plain what kinds of “existing or pre- stored knowledge of other minds” (6) are activated in processing social minds,  both fictional and actual. Such interdisciplinary work may not change the final  typology of social minds, but it will ground the theory in a more substantial base  of evidence and prove its transferable qualities beyond the domain of cognitive  poetics and narratology. The example that Palmer gives us to demonstrate, quite rightly, the value of  uncovering the operations of a fictional social mind is taken from Middlemarch.  His close reading convincingly illustrates the presence of collective thinking in  Middlemarch’s society, concluding that the “town actually and literally does have  a mind of its own” (23). In fact, Palmer’s analysis is strongly reminiscent of the  ideological analysis of literary texts that began to emerge within critical stylistics  of the 1980s onwards (Fowler; Carter and Simpson), and from which notions  of mind style have later been developed. This begs the question of whether the  concept of social minds might fall foul of the criticism Palmer raises of “putting  old wine into new bottles” (18). While there are clearly areas of overlap between  critical stylistics and social minds, there are also important differences. In my  opinion, the most innovative contribution that social minds makes is to foreground  the working of intermental thought and its role in establishing different kinds of  intermental units. This being the case, it seems vital to me that the composite nature  of the intermental units and the contributions made by its different members to the  production of intermental thought be spelled out clearly. Here I suggest that Palmer’s  work might be strengthened further by drawing on work from sociolinguistics and  social anthropology. Although the typology set out in Palmer’s introductory essay  differentiates between intermental units in terms of scale and permanence, the  generality of the categories, “small”, “medium” and “large” might be refined so  as to make their application more robust and transferable. For example, there is a  sizable body of research on social networks which distinguishes between network  membership with strong and weak ties (Granovetter) and single or multiplex  </page> <page sequence="3"> 294 Ruth Page connections (Milroy). Likewise the concept of Communities of Practice (Eckert)  usefully explicates the role group membership plays in shaping social practice  and identity. These frameworks have already proved replicable means of mapping  out different dimensions of group membership and dynamics in many different  contexts and would sharpen the distinction between the intermental groupings  that Palmer proposes.  There is a further subtle but significant difference in terminology between “social  networks” and “communities of practice” and “intermental units.” Both networks  and communities imply that the composite entity — the social group — is composed  of multiple members. The term “unit” does not, and its Latinate etymology implies  instead a number regarded as an “undivided whole” (Oxford English Dictionary).  The problem of talking about “units,” especially when these are represented by  metaphors like “towns” or “neighbourhoods” is that the composite nature of the  social mind can be obscured. If it is the intermental workings of the social mind  that most distinguishes this concept from critical stylistics more generally, then this  terminological ambiguity is a significant one. Take the example that Palmer uses  to prove that readers can ascribe mental functioning to a whole town and not just  individual characters: “Middlemarch, in fact, counted on swallowing Lydgate and  assimilating him very comfortably.” Recognising an anthropomorphic metaphor  where the members of a town, especially when referred to collectively by the name  of the town, is not, as Palmer points out, an unusual practice. But the danger is  that the intermental processes by which shared beliefs are produced do not come  to the fore when the group is treated as a single unit rather than a social network  made of many parts. The potential for homogenized, collective thought is, of course, one of the most  powerful outcomes that the analysis of social minds attempts to capture. As Palmer  points out, there are many ideological implications of social minds that lie beyond  the scope of the introductory essay in this volume. I want to draw my response to  a close by posing a series of questions that indicate some of the contextual and  critical work that might take the concept of social minds further forward. What is the relationship between social minds and ideological systems? What work can social minds accomplish to construct or destabilize stereotypes? What kinds of social minds are marginalized, silenced or un-narratable? And  how might this vary in literature across different socio-historical contexts? What happens to individual minds that resist or rework the collective thought  of social minds? And how might the relationship between individual and social  minds create plot dynamics in stories of different genre and media? </page> <page sequence="4"> A Contextualist Perspective 295 What multimodal resources are used to realise social minds in narratives  which employ more than one semiotic information track? What might this reveal  about the place of language in the work of social minds, especially across different  cultural contexts? There are a great many questions that will no doubt occur to other readers as  the concept of social minds is developed more fully. The small set of questions  presented above is but an indication of the productive work that might be generated  by shifting the direction of the cognitive turn towards the analysis of actual as well  as generic contexts in years to come.
