<plain_text><page sequence="1">Princes Shall Come out of Egypt A Theological Comparison of Marcus Garvey and Reverend Albert B. Cleage Jr. Cardinal Aswad Walker University of Houston Journal of Black Studies Vblurae 39 Number 2 November 2008 194-251 Â© 2008 Sage Publications 10.1 177/0021934708317361 http://jbs.sagepab.com hosted at http://online.sagepub.com Marcus Garvey left substantial documentation regarding his beliefs about the nature of God, humanity, and salvation and the role of religion, positioning him as a theologian of considerable merit. Yet Garvey 's contributions to the religious discourse have been widely ignored in academic circles, even though his theological ideas found tangible expression in his programs and institu- tions founded and in movements espousing solidarity to Garvey 's race first agenda. One such movement is the Shrine of the Black Madonna of the Pan African Orthodox Christian Church (PAOCC). Founded in 1953 by the late Reverend Albert B. Cleage Jr., considered by many to be the father of Black liberation theology, the PAOCC embodies many of Garvey's beliefs. In this article, the author explores the similarities and differences in Garvey's and Cleage's theologies and their organizational expressions via the Universal Negro Improvement Association and the African Orthodox Church, and the PAOCC, respectively. Keywords: Marcus Garvey; religion; comparative analysis; Albert B. Cleage Jr.; Pan-Africanist theology; Christianity; African religion Garvey came to prominence as a race leader during a time when many Blacks were taking issue with and questioning status quo beliefs and ideas in every area of life. Religion was no exception. Although Garvey was preceded by David Walker, Henry McNeal Turner, Richard Allen, and others in declaring Jesus, Mary, and God as Black, he formalized the evolution of such thought with the canonization of Jesus as a Black Man of Sorrows and Mary as the Black Madonna during the 1924 annual con- vention of the organization he founded, the Universal Negro Improvement Association (UNIA). Garvey also questioned the assumption that Jesus was an otherworldly, apolitical figure. Thus, in Garvey 's rejection of the Eurocentric, otherworldly paradigm of Jesus, he sought to make Jesus, Christianity, and 194</page><page sequence="2">Walker / Marcus Garvey and Albert B. Cleage Jr. 195 the Black church relevant to the Black struggle for power and salvation on this side of the grave. Albert B. Cleage Jr., also a Pan-African, nationalist "race man," took the evolution of the rejection of the basic assumptions about Jesus even further. Not only were Jesus and Mary Black, but Christianity was an African reli- gion, with a God who chose a group of Black people to be His people. For Cleage, the entire Bible is the story of the constant revolutionary struggle for God's chosen people to seek an end to their earthly oppression by obtaining a promised land here on Earth. Cleage founded the Shrine of the Black Madonna in 1953. The church's denominational name, the Pan African Orthodox Christian Church (PAOCC), pays homage to the church most closely associated with Garvey's UNIA: the African Orthodox Church (AOC). Cleage and the PAOCC not only questioned and rejected Eurocentric beliefs and ideas in all areas but worked to build a theology, church, and other institutions that reflect beliefs and ideas coming from an African (Black) worldview. The same questioning of European theology that was taking place in the liberation theologies of South and Central America, Korea, and other places was carried out by Cleage with his Black liberation theology. Like Garvey, Cleage sought to make Jesus, Christianity, and the Black church rel- evant to the Black struggle for power and this- worldly salvation. Yet for many, it may be surprising to speak of comparing the theology and ecclesiology of Marcus Garvey with those of Albert B. Cleage Jr., for only Cleage has been recognized by established theologians as having a theology. This institutional recognition, which was once felt in many Black churches across the country wrestling with the notion of making Christianity relevant to Black people's struggle for empowerment, has waned as the distance has grown between academia and the church and between the civil rights and Black power era and present-day sensibilities. Still, much of Cleage's theological conclusions, regardless their level of public recogni- tion, were originally espoused by Garvey. In his thesis, The Theology of Marcus Garvey, Roderick McLean (1987) eloquently illustrated the theology of Garvey and compared it with those of Cleage and others. Garveyism as a Religious Movement, a thesis by Randall Burkett (1978), makes the same argument in a very similar style. McLean pointed out that the criticism that Garvey did not have one neat theologi- cal position paper is ill founded, considering that Martin Luther (of the Protestant Reformation), Menno Simons (of the Mennonite movement), and John Wesley (the father of Methodism) were also without such. Wrote McLean of Luther and others, "A systematic approach of their contributions to theology was put together by their understudies and disciples, and by</page><page sequence="3">1 96 Journal of Black Studies theologians and students of history, after the fact" (p. 43). The theologies of Luther and Wesley, McLean continued, were formalized by their followers. The fact that Garvey clearly articulated his beliefs on God, humanity, Jesus, and salvation in a consistent manner throughout his public ministry in various speeches, position papers, news articles, interviews, and organizational publications, McLean and Burkett argued, is proof enough that his was a legitimate theology. According to James Cone (1984), Cleage was more homiletical than theological in his book The Black Messiah, a compilation of sermons published in the hope that they may help other Black people find their way back to the historic Black Messiah, and at the request of many Black preachers who are earnestly seeking ways to make their preaching relevant to the complex and urgent needs of the Black community, (p. 18) With regard to Cleage's (1972/1 987b) second book, Black Christian Nationalism: New Directions for the Black Church, first published in 1972, reviewers praise its thoroughness and insightfulness in articulating Cleage's program but fail to give it their theological stamp of approval. Yet like Garvey, Cleage was consistent in presenting his theological views on God, humanity, Jesus, and salvation. His views are easily found not only in his two books but also in other writings, sermons, and publications. The omission of Garvey and Cleage from the discourse on theology is easily understandable when this omission comes from White academicians who have never given Black theology their full respect and support. However, Black theologians and historians have been just as guilty for their over- sights. Burkett (1978) offered possible reasons for the oversight of Garvey. Cone (1984, pp. 225-226) suggested that Cleage's lack of respect for "genuine biblical Christianity" makes it impossible for any Black Christian to take him seriously. Ironically, and very understandably, the reasons submitted by Burkett (1978) and Cone (1984) for the absence of recognition of the theological contributions of Garvey and Cleage speak to the very core issue Garvey and Cleage raised in their positions: the question of authority. Both Garvey and Cleage dared to go against the grain of established beliefs and dared to ques- tion their legitimacy, especially in light of the fact that the propagators of said positions were of the very same group they determined was responsi- ble for the oppression and exploitation of Black people. White theologians had no reason to legitimize theological positions that called into question</page><page sequence="4">Walker / Marcus Garvey and Albert B. Cleage Jr. 197 the very foundation of their own beliefs. Black theologians, who accepted those same beliefs, espoused by their White "fathers in Christ," could not cut their theological legs from under themselves by abandoning all they had been taught in White seminaries and universities, for two reasons. First, like their White counterparts, their foundation was being shaken and questioned by the views of Garvey and Cleage. Second, Black theologians had to fight another battle, also included in the positions of Garvey and Cleage. Black theologians had to fight against what Cleage called the acceptance of the myth of Black inferiority (ABI). According to Cleage, ABI is a by-product of the conditioning process endured by enslaved Africans, which he referred to as "niggerization," labeled by Dr. Joy Leary as posttraumatic slavery syndrome and by others as internalized oppression. This acceptance makes it difficult at best for Blacks to take seriously anything not given to them first by White people. Thus, a study comparing the theologies of Garvey and Cleage is long overdue. And though separated by several decades in terms of the height of their ministries, their positions and beliefs are incredibly similar. Yet each had strongly different opinions on the positioning of the church in their respective movements. Although both Garvey and Cleage believed that religion was at the core of their movements for Black self-determination, Garvey was staunchly against having a UNI A church. Garvey made it painfully clear in a series of articles and speeches that the UNIA had no one church and that it was an organization open to Black persons of all faiths and denominations. For Cleage, however, the entire movement centered on members pledging loyalty to one church, one program, one faith: the PAOCC. This is not to say that Cleage believed that the entire Pan- African world would find liberation via the work of his church but rather that he believed that for the PAOCC to be successful at building the institutional power needed to effectively influence and collaborate with other freedom movements, its members had to adhere to Garvey 's call of "one God, one aim, one destiny." Thus, a study comparing the ecclesiologies of Garvey and Cleage is long overdue. Cleage gained insight and inspiration from the work of Garvey. The church founded by Cleage, the PAOCC, defines itself as an extension of the church most commonly associated with Garvey's UNIA, the AOC. Not only did he adopt many of Garvey's ideas, but Cleage also implemented changes in areas in which Garvey, upon reflection on the effectiveness of the UNIA near the end of his life, believed he had erred. One of those ideas was the level of prominence that religion and the church were to have in an organi- zation involved in the struggle for Black power. Garvey saw religion as an</page><page sequence="5">1 98 Journal of Black Studies aid to Black women's and men's struggle in a general way. Blacks were to reject European conclusions about Jesus and Christianity in order to be able to function effectively as members of the UNIA, yet maintain membership in their existing churches. Cleage, however, viewed the Black church as the most important element of the Black struggle for power because it is the only institution owned and controlled by Black people and thus the logical foundational institution from which all other necessary Black power institu- tions can be built. However, for Cleage, only a Black church with a changed theology could struggle for self-determination with any hope of success. Thus, Cleage's call for Black people to reject the European understanding of Christianity was also a call for them to reject the theology of the vast major- ity of Black churches that were founded on that same understanding and to accept the theology and program of the PAOCC. In this article, I compare the theological and ecclesiological views of Garvey and Cleage to see how the two approached the same problem of making Jesus, Christianity, and the Black church relevant to the Black struggle for power. Influences For both Garvey and Cleage, three things can be pointed to as having had the most influence on their theological beliefs: their parents, their life experiences, and the work of preceding Black Nationalists. The parents of both Garvey and Cleage were strong, successful, determined, and national- istic. For each man, key life experiences helped shape their theologies, both before and during their stints as public figures. Also, Garvey and Cleage built on the foundational work and ideas of their Black Nationalist predecessors. Because the childhood and life experiences of Garvey have been much more widely reported, attention is given here to the parents and life experi- ences of Cleage. Suffice it to say, however, that the cumulative experiences of Garvey's childhood and young adulthood forged in him a theology that placed the redemption of Africa and her children of the diaspora as the eschatological goal: At this moment methinks I see Ethiopia stretching forth her hands unto God, and methinks I see the Angel of God taking up the standard of the Red, the Black, and the Green, and saying "Men of the Negro Race, Men of Ethiopia, follow me." (Garvey, 1923-1925/1986, p. 96)</page><page sequence="6">Walker / Marcus Garvey and Albert B. Cleage Jr. 199 Born on June 13, 191 1, in Indianapolis, Indiana, Cleage was one of six children. His mother, Pearl Reed Cleage, was described by author Hiley Ward (1969) in Prophet of the Black Nation as "a tiny dynamo of a woman ... but at age 81 still the very regal personality that has left her imprint on all the Cleage children" (p. 38). One imprint made by Mrs. Cleage on her children was the power of God and the sacredness of religion. Said Mrs. Cleage, "The advice for [Cleage] is the same for all his life, was to take your troubles to God. Don't think you can decide anything by yourself (quoted in Ward, 1969, p. 47). Mrs. Cleage and others described her husband, Albert B. Cleage, Sr., as a great crusader for Black people. According to Oscar Hand, a childhood friend of Cleage, "His father was a very militant Black person. I can under- stand how Rev. Cleage is the same way. His father tried to organize Black people long before anyone thought of organization" (quoted in Ward, 1969, pp. 40-41). The elder Cleage was also the first Black named to the position of city physician for Detroit. His wife described him as overworked and overly worried about the welfare of those he served. He founded Dunbar Hospital (now Parkside Hospital), the first Black hospital in Detroit. According to Mrs. Cleage, "There was a lot of argument about starting it, but he insisted on a colored hospital where he could be treated with dignity" (quoted in Ward, 1969, pp. 38-39). Like Sarah Garvey, Pearl Cleage greatly affected the life of her son. The dedication of Cleage's (1972/1987b) book Black Christian Nationalism attests to this fact: "To my mother, Pearl Reed Cleage, who listened to me 'preach' from the time I was four, and told me that my New Testament pro- fessor was wrong because Jesus was Black . . . with love." Mrs. Cleage's insistence on telling the "correct" Bible story is foundational to the works of her son. Wrote Cleage (1972/1 987b), "If the Black church is to commit its resources to the Black Revolution, we must develop a new Black theology founded upon a critical re-examination of the historic foundation of the Christian faith" (p. 45). Like the senior Garvey, Cleage's father influenced his son's approach to his mission of nation building with his tireless work ethic and emphasis on organization. Wrote Cleage (1972/1 987b), the Black church will no longer wait for people to come in to worship but will educate, train, recruit, mobilize, and confront out in the community. The church involved in Black Liberation will go where Black people are and bring them where they ought to be. (p. 65)</page><page sequence="7">200 Journal of Black Studies Life Experiences As with Garvey, the redemption of Africa was the cornerstone of the church founded by Cleage. Like Garvey, Cleage grew up in a time and place that brought the realities of racial inequality home, even amid a relatively privileged upbringing. Many of these experiences helped shape in Cleage a Pan-Africanist theology and an ecclesiology that placed the church at the center of the Black liberation struggle. Cleage was a youth when the Garvey movement was at its height (the mid-'20s), with the reality of segregation the rule of the day: I was separated from the day I was born. Every area of my life has been separate. . . . Essentially all the people I know are Black. You can't ask me if I'm advocating separation. I don't know anything else. I know all about separation. But I didn't do it. I just inherited it. (quoted in Ward, 1969, p. 76) Although most Blacks were relegated to low-paying service jobs, Cleage grew up the son of a very successful and very hard working father. He also had the benefit of parents who were willing to fight for the rights of their children, specifically, and Black people in general. The pictures of lynched Blacks in Crisis magazine and the constant belittling of being asked to sit at the back of classrooms in predominantly White schools made for a very serious young Cleage. Hand mentioned an incident from his and Cleage's youth when Cleage, like Garvey, boldly stood up to opposing forces, refusing to yield because he believed himself right. Hand, recalling the continued police harassment inflicted on the Cleage family, observed one particular incident when the police were attempting to tear down the Cleages' door after receiving a call reporting loud music coming from his residence, when Cleage opened it and shouted, "This is what you always do - walk in a Black house, and all over . . . you are not going to do it here!" Added Hand, "Rev. Cleage was really mad and raised so much hell that if they had come in, I think he would have killed them" (quoted in Ward, 1969, p. 77). Cleage as a child was described as being more interested in reading, planning, and "making talk" (preaching or debating) than in playing. Cleage's theology reflected the work of one who had experience defending the validity of his positions while questioning the validity of the positions of others. Wrote Cleage (197271987b),</page><page sequence="8">Walker / Marcus Garvey and Albert B. Cleage Jr. 201 White Christianity is a bastard religion without a Messiah and without a God. Jesus was not white and God is not white. Jesus was a Black Messiah, the son of a Black woman, a son of the Black Nation Israel. Historical and anthro- pological evidence abounds to prove the Blackness of Jesus, so let us not waste time whipping a dead horse (or a nonexistent white Messiah), (p. 174) The self-help logic and emphasis on institution building that flows in Cleage's theology was developed by his work in the print medium, like Garvey. The Illustrated News, published by Cleage and his brother Louis as a tool for politicizing the Detroit community during the '60s, was preceded by his work as a youth on the Detroit People News, a neighborhood publi- cation run mainly by Cleage and Hand. Several persons besides his parents had an influence on Cleage and his approach to theology and ecclesiology. One such person was the Reverend Charles Hill, who was one of the most outspoken liberal clergymen of the '20s, '30s, and '40s. Of Hill it was stated that on one occasion during the Sojourner Truth controversy (a project in which white priests were organizing against integration), three carloads of white roughnecks came to his house. Stated Rev. Hill, "I met them at the door and told them if they crossed the threshold they could prepare to go to the next world." (Dukes, 1963, quoted in Ward, 1969, p. 215) Cleage appreciated Hill's protests and radicalism voiced at church meetings but believed that Hill became too "evangelical on Sunday morning." Still, Hill was one of two persons mentioned by Cleage during Ward's interviews with him for Prophet of the Black Nation, with Reverend Dr. Horace White being the other. White's concern for political action was not confined to midweek meetings. "His was all one religion - weekdays and Sundays. This is also my preference - all one faith. He did not make concessions," said Cleage (quoted in Ward, 1969, p. 42). On the social gospel movement that so influenced Garvey, Cleage believed it to be "too Utopian, full of action, but not much realism." Cleage leaned more toward the neo-orthodoxy of Reinhold Niebuhr, who empha- sized the beliefs that every person is a sinner and that God is an omnipotent judge. Karl Barth's special emphasis on drawing faith from scriptures led Ward to conclude that Cleage was one of the most scriptural preachers in Detroit, shunning quotations from all sources other than the Bible and life. The evolution of Cleage's theology widened his scope of faith sources. In a PAOCC publication, Basics of BCN for Membership (Nyerere, 1994), there are no fewer than 31 different sources cited ranging across disciplines</page><page sequence="9">202 Journal of Black Studies (physics, anthropology, sociology, psychology, African history, biblical studies, and social commentary). While in seminary at the Oberlin Graduate School of Theology, Cleage's theology was also informed by popular '20s theologian Walter Rauschenbusch, who related religion to existing social problems and emphasized the Old Testament. Wrote Cleage (1972/1987b), "There is very little history in the Gospels and in the rest of the New Testament. ... We must depend on the Old Testament to validate the New Testament." He continued, "The New Testament does not take the Old Testament to new heights. It is a complete contradiction of the Old Testament, and Jesus came to fulfill the Old Testament" (pp. 35-36). Freud's "dynamic concept of the human mind in terms of subconscious struggle" was also a major part of Cleage's theology, though Cleage believed that "it's not sex (Freud), but a will to power that motivates the subconscious and gives all a desire for power. [For] much of human nature is concealed and is beneath water, like an iceberg" (Ward, 1969, pp. 103-104). Wrote Cleage (1987a) in his publication The BCN Message and Mission, Niggerization, caused by an oppressor's opÃ©rant conditioning, leads to the acceptance of Black inferiority and then to its psychological repression because the individual cannot live with a conscious awareness of this condi- tioned acceptance. Although repressed, this acceptance of Black inferiority continues to function as unconscious motivation causing non-rational thinking and persistent non-adjustive behavior, (p. 7) Upon graduating from the Oberlin Graduate School of Theology, Cleage began his church work. "I went into the church because I could not see any- thing that you could do for Black people with white-oriented sociology and psychology" (Cleage, 1972/1987b, p. 109). Upon a recommendation from legendary theologian Howard Thurman, Cleage served at the San Francisco Church for the Fellowship of All Peoples in an interim position for 6 months until Thurman arrived to take over. This interracial endeavor added to Cleage's belief that integration was an impossibility. Cleage described the whole affair as contrived and artificial, with Whites coming as "missionaries" and Blacks brainwashed into believing that it was something superior. Cleage organized the largest youth ministry program in Detroit. This work was preceded by his tireless youth work in Springfield, Massachusetts. While there, Cleage, as chairman of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People's (NAACP) housing committee, fought against housing discrimination. But his most impressionable fight was against a former minister of his Springfield church, William N. DeBerry. This</page><page sequence="10">Walker / Marcus Garvey and Albert B. Cleage Jr. 203 "granddaddy of all pastors" of St. John's took with him as he left his posi- tion as pastor properties given to the church that he had used to forward the church's social programs. DeBerry later sought to sell the church properties back to St. John's. Cleage stood against this, saying that the properties were already St. John's by legal right. The battle split church loyalties but served as an example of the uncompromising nature of Cleage and the theology he professed, even risking losing the acceptance of the masses. Speaking on the process of transformation during a 1992 sermon, Cleage said, If you want to change your life, you would have to listen and do the things that are required. Not to merely say, "Amen. That's right. That's right." I really couldn't care less whether anybody ever said "Amen." If you want to change, want to be transformed ... if you want to be healed then you must change, (quoted in Ufum, 1995, p. 35) Just as important, DeBerry 's opposition to the training of others for leader- ship probably strengthened Cleage's desire to purposefully and programmati- cally train and develop leadership. This point was crucial to Cleage because he, like Garvey, saw the liberation struggle as protracted. And Cleage viewed the PAOCC as a leadership church. Thus, training was critical. For, as stated in the Black Christian Nationalism responsive meditation, "We share a sacred trust with those who have gone before and with those who will come after." The incident with DeBerry also gave Cleage an example of how the selfish actions of an individual over and above those of the group can do immea- surable damage. This experience did much to lay the foundation for Cleage's vision of an all-volunteer movement, with no paid positions and all properties belonging to the church. These cumulative experiences forged in Cleage a theology that placed the process of transformation and the questioning of "orthodox" beliefs at the top of his religious priorities and placed the Black church squarely in the middle of the struggle rather than on the periphery. Wrote Cleage (1972/1 987b), "If the Black church is to commit its resources to the Black Revolution, we must develop a new Black theology founded upon a critical reexamination of the historic foundation of the Christian faith" (p. 45). Preceding Black Nationalists Both Garvey and Cleage were obviously influenced by the ideas and actions of Black Nationalists who preceded them. The leading writers of the Pan-African movement during Garvey's era were Henry McNeal Turner,</page><page sequence="11">204 Journal of Black Studies Edward Wilmot Blyden, and J. E. Casely Hayford. Turner, a prominent cler- gyman, led a campaign to persuade Blacks in the United States to move to Africa. Blyden, a West Indian by birth like Garvey, moved to Africa in 1851 and became the leading spokesperson of the Pan- African movement. There had also been earlier abortive nationalist attempts to set up separate Black republics in the United States. S. H. Scott, of Fort Smith, Arkansas, in 1885, and Edwin P. McCabe, a former auditor from the state of Kansas, in 1889, worked for establishing separate Black territories. (Ward, 1969, p. 17) Before Scott and McCabe, Paul Cuffe in 1815 organized the African Colonization Society, which helped colonize Monrovia in 1822 and launch Liberia as a republic in 1847. These persons, in addition to Booker T. Washington with his self-help, nonprotesting program of social uplift, helped mold in Garvey a theology that called for persons to accept personal responsibility for their own well-being. According to Garvey (1921), "God is not going to save you. He has done all He possibly could: He has given you a life to live, and if you do not exercise your own will in your own behalf you will be lost" (p. 2). Cleage was no doubt influenced by the works of these same persons. He also gave credit to Elijah Muhammad, founder of the Nation of Islam, and Garvey when he wrote, Only a few Black men have seriously attempted to lead Black people. Marcus Garvey tried to lead Black people away from integration and towards sepa- ratism. . . . The Honorable Elijah Muhammad has tried to lead Black people toward the establishment of a separate Black Nation in the Western Hemisphere. (Cleage, 1972/1987b, p. 13) Garvey and Cleage gave life to these nationalistic influences in their programs and in their theological writings and utterances. On the impor- tance of Black people worshipping a Black God, Garvey tried to show that for Blacks, a White God is idolatrous. "When you bow to a graven image, when you bow to the god of another species, you dishonor the God that is in you" (Garvey, 1924, quoted in Burkett, 1978, p. 63). According to Cleage (1972/1987b), The concept of separatism as opposed to integration is a recurring theme in the Old Testament, and God is always on the side of separation. "You must sepa- rate from people who are wrong, who are against you, who are corrupting you, and set up a nation in which you can control your own institutions." (p. 202)</page><page sequence="12">Walker / Marcus Garvey and Albert B. Cleage Jr. 205 Other Factors At the Berlin Conference of 1884 to 1885, Great Britain, France, Germany, Belgium, Portugal, and Italy carved up Africa, without Africa's consent, for their own imperialistic purposes. Traveling the world and seeing the European powers profiting from the weakening of Black people because of colonialism greatly affected Garvey's mission and theology. Another factor in the formation of Garvey's theology and program was the Harlem Renaissance. According to McLean (1987), "it would seem that the entire world of Black people was in ferment." Blacks from all over the world were making public demands for equal treatment. And Harlem was becoming international in its makeup, with Blacks coming not only from the South but also from the French and British West Indies and from Africa. This growth in persons was matched only by a growth in ideas and creativ- ity. The mood of the entire country was one of people no longer accepting the status quo on anything. Democracy was in question with the rise of the Communist Party. World control was in question with the shifting of pow- ers due to the rapid growth of the United States. Colonialism was in ques- tion with the rise of the Pan- African movement, with scholar W. E. B. Du Bois holding international conferences on the subject annually. Creation was in question with the rise of Darwinism. The existence of a historical Jesus was in question with the rise of the form criticism movement. Also, Black life being tied solely to southern sharecropping was in question with the great northern migration, which saw nearly half of the entire Black pop- ulation leave the South. This will to question and confront once sacred norms breathed new life into the poets, authors, musicians, and race leaders of Harlem. To even be heard over the commotion of new energy, one's voice and ideas had to speak boldly, loudly, and specifically to the needs of Black people. This boldness was exhibited in the scholarship of several Black histori- ans who researched and found documented evidence of ancient African civilizations. It was during this period that Negro History Week, now Black History Month, was founded by Carter G. Woodson. It was during this period that James Weldon Johnson penned what is now referred to as the Black National Anthem, "Lift Every Voice and Sing." Thus, it stands to rea- son that during this time, Garvey could ask the questions "Where is the Black man's government? Where are his king and his kingdom? Where is his president, his country, and his ambassador, his army, his navy, his men of big affairs?" (Garvey, 1923-1925/1986, p. 126).</page><page sequence="13">206 Journal of Black Studies Another influence upon Garvey was the rise of the social gospel move- ment, summed up by the words of Walter Rauschenbusch (1907), who later influenced Cleage: If at this juncture (the twentieth century) we can rally sufficient religious faith and moral strength to snap the bonds of evil and turn the present unpar- alleled economic and intellectual resources of humanity to the harmonious development of a true social life, the generations yet unborn will mark this as that great day of the Lord for which the ages waited, and count us blessed for sharing in the apostolate that proclaimed it. (p. 422) The social gospel movement has been described as one that sought out the truth about society for program formation rather than relying on biblical exegesis or theological elaboration. This realist approach is seen in Garvey's social analysis on the future of Blacks in America: We [the members of the UNIA] foresee the time when the great white race in America will have grown numerically to the point of selfish race exclusion, when no common appeal to humanity will save our competitive race from their prejudice and injustice, hence the Universal Negro Improvement Association warns the Negro of America as well as of the western world of the dangers of the future, and advises that the best effort of today should be that concentrated on the building up of a national home of our own in Africa. (Garvey, 1922, quoted in McLean, 1987, p. 84) Much happened in the racial life of the United States between the 1954 Brown v. Board of Education ofTopeka desegregation case and the 1997 Supreme Court decision to let stand the Fifth Circuit Court's ruling against the constitutionality of race-based scholarships for college admission. The latter, said Jaramogi Menelik Kimathi, the PAOCC's present holy patriarch, will have just as sweeping effects on Black life as did the Topeka case. For, 40 states other than the three immediately affected by the case (Texas, Louisiana, and Mississippi) have anti-affirmative action legislation just wait- ing for that ruling, as do corporations who were always slow to comply to affirmative action laws anyway, (interview, 1997) Within these bookend landmark cases lie hundreds of events, discoveries, and revelations that shaped the evolving theology of Cleage: the 1955 murder of the 14-year-old Black youth Emmitt Till and the acquittal of his adult White confessed murderers; the emergence of Martin Luther King Jr., as</page><page sequence="14">Walker / Marcus Garvey and Albert B. Cleage Jr. 207 leader and spokesperson for the civil rights movement; the Black power movement that, like the Harlem Renaissance 40 years before, rekindled interest in African history and culture; the assassinations of Malcolm X, Medgar Evers, and King; the bombing of Birmingham's 16th Street Baptist Church, killing four Black children; the declared war on the Black Panther Party by U.S. law enforcement agencies; and the war in Vietnam, where Black frontline troops and casualties were grossly disproportionate to Black popu- lation figures. These events and experiences only verified Cleage' s beliefs about the impossibility of integration. Moreover, new discoveries in various fields of science, along with the new age religious movement, informed the theology of Cleage, verifying already held beliefs of the correctness of ancient African religious positions on the interconnectedness of all life. On Authority Although many theological studies begin with a discussion of beliefs about God, then progress to beliefs about Jesus, anthropology (humanity), and salvation, it is imperative in such a study as this to begin with Garvey's and Cleage's theological views on the question of authority. Authority was at the heart of both men's theological positions. Each questioned the accepted authority of White, Western perceptions and assumptions about theology. Each sought to move his people to the point of accepting their own God-given authority to think, act, and speak for themselves. For Garvey, the roadblock to building a self-determining nation for Black people was Blacks' acceptance of White definitions of reality. Garvey saw contradictions between Black existence and Black essence. And this essence was lost from the sight of Blacks when they failed to question and reject White definitions of reality. Said Garvey, We have to admire the white man who fixed the Bible to suit himself, and who even fixed tradition itself, telling us that everything worthwhile and beautiful was made by the white man; that God is a great white man, that Jesus was a white man, and that the angels, etc., whatever they are, are as beautiful as peaches in Georgia, (quoted in Martin, 1 976, p. 30) And in so doing, White definitions of reality became Black definitions of that same reality in many areas, one of which was religion. Thus, with the push toward integration and inclusion into White society by the NAACP</page><page sequence="15">208 Journal of Black Studies and other Black leaders, few even saw a need to question the authority of those White definitions. But for Garvey, questioning this unquestioned authority was at its heart, a theological issue. Said Garvey, If the white man has the idea of a white God, let him worship his God as he desires. . . . We, as Negroes, have found a new ideal. Whilst our God has no color, yet it is human to see everything through one's own spectacles, and since the white people have seen their God through white spectacles, we have only now started (late though it be) to see our God through our own specta- cles. . . . We Negroes believe in the God of Ethiopia, (quoted in Burkett, 1978, p. 63) Garvey's movement was open to religionists of all faiths and denomina- tions. However, one common belief that Garvey stressed to all members was in the Blackness of God and Jesus. For he saw no possibility of a person being true to the struggle for Black redemption while bowing down daily to a concept of God that came from the White community and experience. Cleage (1972/ 1987b) was not as gracious as Garvey in his appraisal of the European view of Christianity: White Christianity is a bastard religion without a Messiah and without a God. Jesus was not white and God is not white. Jesus was a Black Messiah, the son of a Black woman, a son of the Black Nation Israel, (p. 174) For Cleage, the acceptance by Blacks of a White, Western worldview is evi- dence of the psychological damage inflicted on Blacks due to the process of niggerization, the use of opÃ©rant conditioning by the oppressor to reward desired behavior while punishing undesired behavior. This conditioning, which began with the slave trade and continues to this day, according to Cleage, has rendered Black people psychologically incapable of accepting their own authority without entering into a process to counter the effects of niggerization. For Cleage, religion is the process that can transform Black people who suffer from Acceptance of the Myth of Black Inferiority (ABI) opening them to see the God incarnate, enabling them to accept authority that emerges out of their own experience and thus work to end their oppression. Speaking on the goal of religion, Cleage (1972/1987b) wrote, For us the Experience of God is the basis of a revolutionary struggle for self- actualization and social change designed to transform our wretched black condition here on earth. It is the basis for our commitment to the struggle. It is not an end in itself, (p. 4).</page><page sequence="16">Walker / Marcus Garvey and Albert B. Cleage Jr. 209 Cleage believed that a failure to enter into this process would leave Blacks forever unconsciously accepting White authority and thus incapable of giv- ing commitment to the Black liberation struggle. The question of authority was also crucial for Cleage because, as the sub- title of his book Black Christian Nationalism (Cleage, 1972/1987b) states, he sought to give new directions for the Black church, which for too long operated from an unchallenged European perspective of theology. Thus, if the Black liberation struggle was to have any success, the Black church had to be reclaimed by Black people with a theology derived from the Black experience. For Cleage, as he stated in the introduction to Black Christian Nationalism, titled "Authority and the Black Revolution," "There is one authority for a Black man and that is the Black experience as it is influenced by the never-ending Black Liberation Struggle" (p. xvii). Stated another way, Cleage asserted, If it supports the Liberation Struggle of Black people, then it is good. If it is in opposition to the Liberation Struggle, then it is bad. If it supports the Liberation Struggle of Black people, then it is moral. If it opposes the Liberation Struggle, then it is immoral. If it supports the Liberation Struggle of Black people, then it is the will of God. If it opposes the Liberation Struggle of Black people, then it is satanic. With this simple key to the mysteries of life both events and institutions can be judged, (pp. xviii-xix) For Garvey, the lack of questioning authority manifested itself in society by the view held by many Blacks that they were privy to a special connection with God because of their ordained subordinate status. Cleage (1972/1987b) observed this same phenomenon, stating, Black people are not good because they are poor and powerless. We want power and everything everyone else wants, but we have been taught that we ought not want them, so we feel guilty and try to make a virtue out of weakness, (p. 139) Said Garvey, Some of us flatter ourselves to believe that God is with us and God is a being who is taking care of us in this serfdom and peonage and slavery that we are enduring. God is vexed with you because you are subordinating the powers that He gave to you. (quoted in McLean, 1 987, p. 53) Wrote Cleage on this same subject, "God is more disgusted with us for accepting our oppression than He is with white people for oppressing us" (Cleage, 197271987b, p. 200).</page><page sequence="17">2 1 0 Journal of Black Studies Cleage described the societal effects of the acceptance of White authority in terms of its psychological damage done (niggerization) and the resulting way of life built on that foundation (slave culture). According to the Black Christian Nationalist Glossary, slave culture is "the lifestyle developed by an oppressed group that has psychologically accepted their conditions" (Cleage, 1975, p. 56). Thus, in the slave culture, which is more a state of mind than a place, one's oppression is not fought against. And the authority of the powerful is the only authority. This mind-set incapacitates individual members of the Black church and the institution corporately, from involvement in the Black liberation strug- gle. And even if members feel the desire for said involvement, the theology of the Black church does not allow for such, because it is invested too heav- ily in the process of taking sinners to heaven rather than seeking to build a heaven on Earth. Wrote Cleage (1972/1987b), Black people then are involved in two separate processes. One is the religious process of preparing for death and the hereafter, which is completely unrelated to the other, which is the process of trying to survive here on earth. Two-thirds of the wealth, resources, and leadership of the Black community are devoted to the religious process of preparing Black people for heaven. On the other hand, the survival process is almost without organization, resources, or leadership, (p. 47) In questioning accepted Western views of Christianity, several things were rejected by Garvey and Cleage. The rejection of White images of the sacred has already been mentioned. Both emphatically rejected the view of Jesus as a passive, meek, apolitical figure. Garvey said of Jesus, "All true warriors know no fear. . . . Jesus Christ was the greatest radical the world ever saw. Jesus opposed wrong. His program was to lift up humanity and save mankind" (quoted in Burkett, 1978, p. 73). To Garvey, Jesus was a marked man by the powers of his time because he sought to equalize both the "spiritual and temporal rights of man." Wrote Cleage (1972/1 987b), "As important as the fact that Israel and Jesus were Black is the fact that Jesus was a revolutionary leader engaged in a Liberation Struggle against the white gentile world" (p. 45). The intolerance of other religions that was and is so much a part of the Western Christian tradition was also rejected by Garvey and Cleage. Garvey had UNIA members who were Black Jews, Muslims, Egyptian Coptic Christians, and those who represented many Christian denominations. For this reason, Garvey kept from committing the UNIA to one official organi- zation church. Theologically, Garvey believed all his members, regardless</page><page sequence="18">Walker / Marcus Garvey and Albert B. Cleage Jr. 211 of faith, to be worshipping the same God. Garvey said, "Some men call it by different names but all mean the same thing and it is God" (quoted in McLean, 1987, p. 51). The same was true of Cleage, who in the PAOCC statement of faith, the Black Christian Nationalist creed, repeated Garvey's words almost verba- tim: "I believe that human society stands under the judgment of one God, revealed to all, and known by many names" (Cleage, 1972/1 987b, p. xiii). On why Christianity is the faith professed by the PAOCC, Cleage (1972/1 987b) said the following: Since all of the great religions of the world derive from the Black experience, we could turn to another religion if we wished. They all belong to us. Or we could put together a new religion suitable to our present needs and true to our historic revelations of God. But for Black people in America, Christianity is a part of our past. Its reinterpretation in terms of its historic Black roots is a joyful task which we have undertaken, (p. 44) Cleage pointed to historical and anthropological evidence that shows definite links between the religious beliefs taught in the African Mystery Temples in Egypt and the religions of the East and among all peoples of color along the equatorial belt. The fact that the oldest statues of China's Buddha, India's Krishna, and other holy figures in that part of the world por- tray these figures as Black, as documented in Godfrey Higgins's (1833/1965) Anacalypsis, adds credence to Cleage's assertion that priests from the African Mystery Temples played the role of missionary, introducing their beliefs to peoples all over the world, including those in the Americas. Cleage's rejection of accepted Western Christian norms went much deeper than Garvey's. Cleage rejected "Pauline" theology (beliefs espoused by Paul of Tarsus), which put him in direct opposition to many "orthodox" Christian beliefs. Wrote Cleage (1972/1 987b), "The whole Pauline inter- pretation of Christianity is historically false" (p. 34). Commenting further on the "Uncle Tom" apostle Paul, Cleage (1972/1 987b) wrote, [Paul] wanted to identify with his white Gentile oppressors. Paul was very proud of his Roman citizenship, even though he was an oppressed Black Jew. He was just like a Black man today talking about his American citizenship. And I dare say that Paul's Roman citizenship did him just about as much good as a Black man's American citizenship does him today. . . . Paul wanted to feel like a Roman. He wanted to be a part of the pagan Roman world, so he took something that happened, the history and the person of Jesus, and distorted it to make it acceptable to a heathen world, (p. 35)</page><page sequence="19">2 1 2 Journal of Black Studies In a sermon delivered on April 26, 1992, Cleage stated, [Paul] created a religion which met the needs of the pagan heathens to whom he ministered. It began with a faith in Jesus and a religion about Jesus. Not what Jesus had said, not what Jesus had taught, not the life of Jesus, but what the Apostle Paul believed that Jesus had accomplished by his death upon the cross and his resurrection (a blood sacrifice). Jesus gradually became God for the Apostle Paul. So it was actually God who had been crucified on the cross to save mankind. This became a powerful religion for the pagan heathens. They could easily believe this because it was much like many other pagan religions that postulated that God had died as a sacrifice and thereby had saved believers. The Apostle Paul considered his "new church" to be the "New Israel." For him it had taken the place of the "old Israel." (Ufum, 1995, p. 31) Cleage contended that Israel's liberation struggle was lost in the indi- vidualistic salvation of Paul. The church founded by Jesus' disciples was separate and apart from the church founded later by Paul. On Paul's church, which later became accepted as the only true church and precursor to the Catholic church, Cleage stated, The Christian church emerged as a powerful political organization, preach- ing individual salvation through faith releasing the free gift of God's grace, and the sacrificial atonement of Jesus on Calvary as mediated by the sacra- ments of the church, but with no realization that the individualistic salvation it preached negated the teachings of Jesus and ran counter to the way God works in the world. (Ufum, 1995, p. 31) Thus, Cleage questioned not only the color of Jesus and Israel but the pillars of the entire Christian faith. For, according to Cleage, Paul's interpretation of Christianity, which went on to become orthodoxy, had nothing to do with the life and teachings of Jesus. Cleage agreed with Joel Carmichael's (1992) assertion in The Birth of Christianity: Reality and Myth that Paul's "gospel," indeed, had no essential connection with the historic Jesus at all. Though a few facts scattered about his letters indicate that he thought Jesus was born of a normal Jewish woman in a normal way and was a descen- dant of King David, Paul shows no interest whatever in Jesus 's real-life back- ground. Even in referring to the crucial event of his own life, his conversion, Paul extracts Jesus from his natural habitat to such an extent that he says nothing whatever of the historical circumstances of the crucifixion, (p. 73)</page><page sequence="20">Walker / Marcus Garvey and Albert B. Cleage Jr. 213 This rejection of Paul's reading of Christianity means also that Cleage rejected Paul's beliefs that Jesus is God, that salvation is a purely spiritual matter depending solely on an individual's faith, and that the covenant of the Old Testament is "updated" and replaced by Jesus' "new covenant." Cleage argued that the Black church, laypersons, and scholars (and the Christian church in general) give more credence to the message of the New Testament than to that of the Old Testament. He wrote, "The New Testament does not take the Old Testament to new heights. It is a complete contradiction of the Old Testament, and Jesus came to fulfill the Old Testament" (Cleage, 1972/1987b, p. 36). With the lessened importance of the Old Testament to the Christian faith because of the acceptance of Paul's theology, in particular to the Black Christian church, the concepts of nation and communalism were lost. According to Cleage (1972/1987b), "the Old Testament is a Black-power document which no modern book can equal" (p. 37). Cleage asserted that when Christianity is informed by an Old Testament exegesis, it becomes apparent that Israel was involved in a power struggle for salvation, which they defined as a promised land here on Earth. This salvation was corporate, not individual, and reflected the communalism found in ancient and contempo- rary African societies. Thus, the Black church, which received its theology from White Christians while enslaved on plantations, preached the same mes- sage of individual salvation that Paul fashioned for the Romans (Europeans) instead of the message Jesus preached to the Black nation of Israel. Cleage referred to the Black church's theology as "slave theology" for the reasons mentioned above and because he believed that the process of making a slave begins with teaching a person to seek personal salvation, so that relationships with others become secondary at best in one's faith journey. Cleage (1972/1 987b) said not only that the Old Testament could be used to validate the message of the New Testament but that a clearer picture of who Jesus was and what he was trying to do emerges from its pages: We can understand Jesus more fully by looking at Moses and the Maccabees than by looking at the Apostle Paul with his pagan concept of blood redemp- tion. The teachings of Jesus and of Israel reflect the deep spirituality of Black people. The religious ideas of Israel that shaped the ministry of Jesus can only be understood in the light of the history and culture of Africa. Moses gave form and shape to the religion of Israel by borrowing from the ancient religions and culture of Black Africa, (pp. 3-4) To give shape to their assertion of Black authority, and thus the rejection of White Christian norms, Garvey and Cleage used several methods to</page><page sequence="21">2 1 4 Journal of B lack Studies formalize their positions. One such tool was scripture. The most often quoted scripture for Garvey and the UNI A was Psalm 68:31: "Princes shall come out of Egypt; Ethiopia shall soon stretch forth her hands unto God." For Garvey, this scripture spoke of his eschatological expectations of a redeemed Africa. It also spoke to the process of Black people answering the call to struggle that said expectation could be realized. Cleage too used scriptures, but in a different way from Garvey. Because Cleage accepted the Bible as a Black book, the entire Old Testament, with Israel's struggles to build a promised land and maintain its covenanted relationship with God, was seen as proof of the validity of the present Black struggle as a Christian endeavor. One popular scripture at the PAOCC is Exodus 1:8: "There came a pharaon who knew not Joseph." This scripture serves to remind a powerless Black people that no matter how comfortable they are in another's country, they are always viewed as visitors by those in power, regardless of how "Egyptian" they may feel. Genesis 1:1 also informs the theology of the PAOCC. "In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth. Now the earth was a formless void, there was darkness over the deep, and God's spirit hovered over the water." From this was formed Cleage' s concept of an all-encompassing God who is present in everything. Thus, for Cleage, there was no possibility for a chasm to exist between humanity and God because of sin or any other event or force. For God is the essence of all creation, present at all times. Humans can lose an aware- ness of God's presence in them, but not the presence itself. For "in God we live, move, and have our being." For Cleage, the Bible was not viewed as the infallible word of God but was still used as a rule of faith. Thus, the New Testament, though dominated by the writings of Paul, could still inform one's contemporary Christian journey. Cleage, though, in his assertion of Black authority, focused on the synoptic gospels rather than Paul's letters. For Cleage, Jesus' actions as recorded in those gospels showed him to be an extension of the Old Testament covenant struggle. Garvey and Cleage rejected White authority not just in word but in deed. Garvey had the UNIA chaplain-general, Bishop George Alexander McGuire, set up the Universal Negro Catechism training program for UNIA youth that taught Garvey's theology. Garvey's concepts of God, Jesus, and salva- tion were presented. Also stressed was the Black presence in the Bible, with mention being made of Zipporah, wife of Moses, Simon of Cyre, Balthazar the magus, and others. The Universal Negro Catechism also mentioned that the Hebrews were Semitic (an admixture of races, with Black African being one of the races present). Also, the Universal Negro Ritual was put together</page><page sequence="22">Walker / Marcus Garvey and Albert B. Cleage Jr. 215 for UNIA chaplains to abide by. There is evidence, however, to suggest that this book of rituals was never wholly adopted and used. Garvey, considered a functional theologian because "he expressed deep religious concerns as he looked at his people in their setting, and raised ques- tions in relationship to what was, what is, and what ought to be" (McLean, 1987, p. 44), is said to have formed a Black civil religion. According to McLean (1987), Garvey sought to cast the UNIA into an all-embracing institution. What he was struggling to institutionalize can most accurately be described as a species of civil religion, more specifically a Black civil religion. It provided a common set of shared beliefs and value commitments which sought to bind its adherents - all those men and women of African descent who proudly took the name Negro - into a collectivity which was divinely called to a special task in the world, (p. 91) Said songwriter James Weldon Johnson, "The [UNIA] movement became more than a movement, it became a religion, its members became zealots" (quoted in Burkett, 1978, p. 24). This happened because Garvey gave form to Black authority in a religious context. Everything about UNIA meetings was said to be religious. They met on Sundays and opened with a litany of hymns and prayers, followed by a sermon. Besides religious language being com- monly used during UNIA gatherings, all of the activities done to provide a motif of nationhood were done with a religious flavor. Thus, the appoint- ments of officers, ambassadors, knights, and so on, were all accompanied by very ritualized religious ceremonies. There were ministers of African Legions, education, labor, and industry. There were UNIA chaplains at each chapter who answered to the UNIA's chaplain-general. Garvey himself was the president-general and provisional president of Africa. UNIA rituals, hymns, and so on, were interpreted in light of the struggle in which they were engaged. Baptism was no exception. For "infants were not only baptized as Christians but also dedicated to the principles of the UNIA and formally inducted into membership in the organization" (Burkett, 1978, p. 109). The canonization of Jesus as the "Black Man of Sorrows" and Mary as the Black Madonna in 1924 also served to connect Christianity with the Black struggle for self-determination. Cleage also put assertions of Black authority in program form by way of a ministerial training program, rituals, sacraments, and institutions. Although he was one of the most highly demanded college campus speakers, and radio and television interviewees between 1970 and 1972, Cleage walked</page><page sequence="23">2 1 6 Journal of Black Studies away from that form of public ministry to dedicate his time and efforts to training a cadre of young Black ministers in his theology and program for the purpose of building a Black nation with power. These ministers formed a group called the Ministerial Training Group, and Cleage held nightly classes and meetings to impart his theology to them. Formal seminary train- ing was not abandoned as one means of training PAOCC ministers. But the Ministerial Training Group was necessary to emphasize the PAOCC theology, which rejected much of what was taught at seminary. All seven PAOCC rituals and 1 1 holy sacraments are designed to open members to the experience of God for the express purpose of meaningful fellowship in the church community and participation in the liberation struggle. Participation in the holy sacrament of baptism symbolizes members of the PAOCC dying of the old life dominated by feelings of inferiority as witnessed by the worship of White images of the sacred and participation in the strengthening of White power institutions. Those baptized are born anew in the "community of Jesus," the counterculture of the PAOCC, in which they can worship in a tradition that is derived from their own Black experience and participate in the building of Black power institutions. The UNIA's shipping company, the Black Star Line, as well as African Legions, Black Star Nurses, bakeries, cleaners, and Liberty Halls, gave life to the dream of making the UNIA an "all-encompassing" institution that rejected White definitions of reality and thus White control of Black survival needs. Likewise, the PAOCC has built a complex of institutions all designed to concretize the "all-encompassing" nature of the church sought by Garvey. A national cultural center and bookstore, missionary training institutes, KUA meditation centers, KUA retreat centers, commu- nity service centers, printing presses, national holy orders, and a national coordinating leadership help bring Cleage's vision of a "nation within a nation" to life. For Cleage and Garvey, views on God, Jesus, humanity, and salvation must come from the authority of their own people's experience. Theological Views On God Garvey 's view of God was based on his belief in the goodness of creation. Garvey saw "human culture as a process within and part of a wider cosmic</page><page sequence="24">Walker / Marcus Garvey and Albert B. Cleage Jr. 217 process ... the Black Race in their present state as having their origin in God and therefore potentially good and mighty." Rejecting anthropomorphic definitions of God, Garvey referred to the creator as universal intelligence. Said Garvey, There is a God and we believe in Him. He is not a person nor a physical being. He is a spirit and He is Universal Intelligence. Never deny that there is a God. God being Universal Intelligence created the universe out of that intelligence. It is intelligence that creates. Man is a part of the creation of Universal Intelligence, and man was created in the image and likeness of God only by his intelligence. It is the intelligence of man that is like God, but man's intelligence is only a unitary principle of God's Universal Intelligence. (McLean, 1987, p. 55) Although Garvey taught and preached God as spirit, he did not stop from referring to God as Black as he did throughout the Universal Negro Catechism. As previously stated, Garvey saw no way for Blacks to commit to the cause of African redemption if they could not conceive of God through the "spectacles of Ethiopia." Said Garvey, Every man is a pattern of God . . . and all of God's creatures go to make God. All men being part of God, thus Black men must see that it is idolatrous to make God white. When you bow to a graven image, when you bow to the God of another species, you dishonor the God that is in you, and you . . . abase the God of your existence and commit a sin against the Holy Ghost. . . . Therefore, the UNIA desires every Negro to destroy the image of the white God that you have been taught to bow to. (Garvey, 1924, quoted in McLean, 1987, p. 49) To hammer his point home, Garvey used scripture as a justification for his positions. Along with Psalm 68:31, "Princes shall come out of Egypt," Garvey also quoted from Exodus 20:4-5: Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image or any likeness of anything that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth: Thou shalt not bow down thyself to them, nor serve them: for I the Lord thy God am a jealous God. And though Garvey thought it imperative for Blacks to accept a Black God, he still believed in a universal God of all humanity. This God, however, would be pleased with the race in power that takes care of rather than exploits all of humanity. The White race, Garvey contended, had failed miserably at this task. Said Garvey,</page><page sequence="25">2 1 8 Journal of Black Studies Up to now, we have found no race in power that has held out a helping hand and protection to all humanity, and it is apparent that that position is left for the new Ethiopia. Let us, therefore, continue our journey, man. I believe when we reach the goal we shall reign forever, because we shall be the elect of God. (quoted in Burkett, 1978, p. 68) The theme of "chosenness" mentioned above was not stressed as much by Garvey as the theme of the impartiality of God. Said Garvey, There is no God who would create me a Black man, to be a hewer of wood and drawer of water. It is a lie. It is a damned lie. If there is such a God, then I would have to look for another God. (quoted in McLean, 1987, p. 52) Garvey believed that if God be a God of fairness, God had to be impartial. For in Garvey's view, God empowered humanity with the will and ability to act and take care of self, relying on humanity's own God-given resources. With such a view, it was not humanity's place to blame God for any situa- tion that left them the servants of others: There are two understandings of God ... the scientific and the sentimen- tal. The Negro assumes the Sentimental idea, and therein he makes his big mistake. We must not blame God for our servile condition, because God gave us our physical self and made us lords of creation on an equality with all other men; nor must we blame the white man, who is similarly using the ability given to him by God. We have only ourselves to blame. The fault is not in our stars, but in ourselves, that we are underlings, (quoted in McLean, 1987, p. 54) Although Garvey's God was impartial, God was neither passive nor weak. For Garvey, God was a God of war and peace who held absolute power. Stated Garvey, There is a God. No man can say there is no God, because no man is like God. Man is limited in his intelligence at the most and man knows how insufficient he is between life and death - that he is born without his knowledge and dies without his will or wish; when his birth and death must logically and natu- rally be controlled by somebody else. It could not be a man because man is always man whether he be a big man or small man. So power that gives birth and causes death must be greater than man's power. Whatsoever that power is, it must be an absolute power. Some men call it by different names but all mean the same thing and it is God. (quoted in McLean, 1987, p. 51)</page><page sequence="26">Walker / Marcus Garvey and Albert B. Cleage Jr. 219 Garvey also said, God is a gold Sovereign - A Warrior Lord. The God we worship and adore is a God of War as well as a God of peace. He does not allow anything to inter- fere with His power and authority. The greatest battle ever fought was not between the Kaiser of Germany on the one hand and the Allied Powers on the other, it was between Almighty God on the one hand and Lucifer the Archangel on the other ... the whole universe shook as the battle raged between the two opposing forces, and as God the Creator gained the upper hand of Lucifer, what did He do? Did he hoist the white flag of peace? No, God Almighty, God the Omnipotent took hold of Lucifer and flung him from the heights of Heaven to the depths of hell, thereby proving that He is a God of War as well as a God of Peace. And when anyone transgresses His power, He goes to war in defense of His right. (McLean, 1987, p. 50) Garvey is quoted as saying that "God is on the side of the strongest bat- talion" because God created all humanity equal, and those who prosper are pleasing to God for exercising the authority God gave them to have domin- ion over the earth. This does not mean that Garvey believed God to be in favor of those in power. Rather, it was a motivational ploy to get members of his race to leave behind the thoughts of God engaged in a special rela- tionship with them because of the powerlessness. Cleage's view of God was based on three separate yet connected sources: biblical witness, ancient African religious experiences, and discoveries of modern science. According to Basics of BCN for Membership, "The biblical witness, beginning with the first account of creation in Genesis along with the revolutionary teachings of Jesus found in the New Testament and Gnostic gospels lean more toward the African-based pantheistic conception of God" (Nyerere, 1994, p. 63). Using the same logic as Garvey with regard to Genesis 1:1-2 ("In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth. The earth was without form and void, and darkness was upon the face of the deep and the spirit of God was moving over the face of the water"), Cleage asserted that God created everything out of God's "self." Thus, all of creation has a spark of inner divinity, a part of God. Everything is there- fore connected in a gigantic "cosmic web." Cardinal Sondai Nyerere (1994), formerly of the PAOCC, asserted in Basics of BCN for Membership that this pantheistic conception of God, at the core of ancient African reli- gion, undergirds the theology of the "Essenes and (was) adopted by Jesus," then retained by Gnostic Christians. Scriptures such as John 10:30, John 14:17-20, and Luke 17:20-21, which states "the kingdom of God is within</page><page sequence="27">220 Journal of Black Studies you," are cited as evidence of these facts, along with several Gnostic scrip- tures that have matches in the Synoptic Gospels. Cleage asserted that the mystics and priests of ancient Africa and other non-Western cultures that came to know the nature of God through direct religious experience discerned that beyond the boundaries of the rational mind, there exist a wholeness and unity of existence stemming from the reality of God. Moreover, this theology was the theology of the African Mystery System and served as foundational thought for the "Christianity" of Jesus, Buddhism, Hinduism, and Taoism. Said Fritjof Capra (1975/1980) in The Tao of Physics, The most important characteristic of the Eastern world view - one could almost say the essence of it - is the awareness of the unity and mutual inter- relation of all things and events, the experience of all phenomena in the world as manifestations of a basic oneness. All things are seen as interdependent and inseparable parts of this cosmic whole; as different manifestations of the same ultimate reality. Entering in the Samadhi of purity, [one obtains] all- penetrating insight that enables one to become conscious of the absolute oneness of the universe, (pp. 116-117) Cleage placed strong emphasis on the testimony and disciplines of these ancient African priests because of their direct religious experiences. This point alone was enough for Cleage to discard the intellectual debates of European theological teachings. Thus, Cleage's religious practices reflected a desire to lead members to their own experiences of God, that they may "become conscious of the absolute oneness of the universe." For such inner knowledge would produce a Christian bound for life to the struggle of ending Black powerlessness and oppression. Cleage's view of God was also informed by discoveries of modern science. Said Cardinal Nyerere (1994) in Basics of BCN for Membership, The discoveries made in physics during this century concerning the physical nature of the universe support the cosmology of ancient Africa coming out of the African Mystery System (a cosmology derived through ritualized experi- ence). The physicists have discovered, through mathematics and scientific experimentation, that everything in the universe is some form of energy. Matter is simply bound energy. So everything in the universe tangible and intangible, is a particular manifestation of the same fundamental substance - energy. The fundamental reality of the universe is energy. Energy is always expressed through invisible fields of work and activity. These energy fields extend beyond and totally inter-penetrate any physical substance.</page><page sequence="28">Walker / Marcus Garvey and Albert B. Cleage Jr. 221 Anything that enters the energy field of a particular form of matter is acted upon by the field emanating from that matter and conversely, through its own field, that matter is also being acted upon by other fields. This creates a picture of the universe as a gigantic system of energy fields that overlap and interact with one another. All realities in the universe are a product of the existence, activity and interaction of energy fields, (p. 72) The sum total of these influences on Cleage's view of God produced a definition of God strikingly similar to that of Garvey: God is the cosmic energy and creative intelligence out of which all things were created. Thus, religion deals with energy and power, realigning blocked energy due to our acceptance of oppression and powerlessness and opening us up to the power already present via God incarnate. In the PAOCC, this process of transfor- mation is referred to by the Kiswahili term KUA, the science of becoming what you already are. For Cleage, the definition of church could not be separated from that of God. For the church seeks to utilize the energy system upon which all life depends (God) by bringing together a fellowship of persons who practice the disciplines, rituals and sacraments which "open" the individual for both the Experience of God and the Experience of Community. (Cleage, 1972/1987b, p. 5) Wrote Cleage (1972/1987b), We experience God in the fellowship of the church. The church is the mes- sianic community in which God is incarnate and through which God has chosen to work in the world. The church then is more than a group of people professing faith in Jesus Christ as the redeeming son of God. The church is the living body of God possessing the power and ability to act for God in the world, (p. 8) Like Garvey, Cleage rejected the anthropomorphic concept of God, yet still referred to him as the God of Black people. And in so doing, Cleage placed much more emphasis on the chosenness of Black people than did Garvey. Wrote Cleage (1972/1987b), We are God's Chosen People. I don't debate it, I declare it! Black people are God's Chosen People. God supports his Chosen People. We have the witness of the Old Testament. When we fight a battle, God fights with us. In the Old Testament, when the prophet held up his arms, God held the sun still so that</page><page sequence="29">222 Journal of Black Studies the enemies of Black Israel could be killed. That is the kind of God the Old Testament talks about. That is the kind of God who supports the Black Nation, (p. 239) Still, Cleage affirmed the universality of God by declaring in the Black Christian Nationalist creed that there is "one God, revealed to all, known by many names." Although the two beliefs seem contradictory, they are not. The equality of humanity that Cleage believed in (which will be discussed later in this section) demands a God that created all persons. The chosen- ness of Black people comes from the fact that "all peoples have to believe they have a special relationship with God if they are to struggle successfully for equal standing in the world," according to Cardinal Aminifu Waganga of the PAOCC (interview, 1997). Said Cardinal Olu, "We are chosen because we have done the choosing to follow in the footsteps of the revolutionary Black Messiah and do the will of God" (interview, 1997). Cleage also pointed to the fact that the Bible, though the story of one Black group's trials and tribulations amid the warrings of other, more powerful Black nations, is still a story of God working with a Black people. Like Garvey, Cleage saw God as working through people to achieve God's aims. More specifically, Cleage saw God working through communal groups. This belief is foundational to the faith of the PAOCC. Chapter 4 of Black Christian Nationalism (Cleage, 1972/1987b), called the most impor- tant chapter of the book by Cleage, is titled "Salvation: A Group Experience." In it, Cleage wrote that "individualism is the unpardonable sin because it separates a man from his Black brothers and sisters, who constitute his only channel of communication with God." Thus, for Cleage, "African commu- nalism is not a socioeconomic system but a theological statement that emerges from the total Black experience" (p. 69), whose whole rhythm is determined by regular festivals which submerge the individual into the group. Wrote Cleage (1972/1987b), When we consider changing individuals as we do in KUA, we are concerned with changing people from individualism to communalism. Basically we are dealing with the problem of socialization. The individual is taught to conform to the Behavioral Norms of a group. We must learn to belong! This is the Group Experience! The Group tears down walls of individualism! Socialization is necessary before the individual can see the Experience of God! The Group then, is basic to the Practice of KUA. The individual resists belonging because he does not wish to sacrifice individualism!</page><page sequence="30">Walker / Marcus Garvey and Albert B. Cleage Jr. 223 This is a paradox - KUA is the science of becoming what we already are. We are created by God with the capacity to love and belong, but from birth we are conditioned to be individualistic. We build up walls of individualism. Fear of others is learned. Fear, insecurity and paranoia are learned at home. Children learn it from their parents. Socialization is necessary before the individual can seek the Experience of God. (p. 7) Thus, salvation comes only through the work of a loving group, a people committed to their personal transformation and the transformation of the group. This aspect of Cleage's theology was informed by the scriptures of the Old Testament calling the patriarchs and the prophets in service to God not for personal salvation but for the salvation of the group to which they belonged. Cleage also found scriptures in the Synoptic Gospels that speak to communal salvation. Acts 2:1-4, which describes the Holy Spirit coming upon the group of disciples in the upper room, is viewed as how God can transform a group of seekers. Acts 2:44-47, which states, All who believed were together and had all things in common; they would sell their possessions and goods and distribute the proceeds to all, as any had need. Day by day, as they spent much time together in the temple, they broke bread at home and ate their food with glad and generous hearts, praising God and having the good- will of all the people. And day by day the Lord added to their number those who were being saved, provided for Cleage a model of how the church community is to function, giving to one another in an intimate fellowship as they are able and receiv- ing as they have need. It is through this process of people divesting them- selves of the obsession with self for the good of others that they are saved. Garvey spoke of an active God of war and peace. Cleage also viewed God as active in the affairs of humanity, specifically on behalf of His chosen people, as witnessed by the words of the Black Christian Nationalist creed (Cleage, 1972/1987b): I Believe that human society stands under the judgment of one God, revealed to all, and known by many names. His creative power is visible in the mys- teries of the universe, in the revolutionary Holy Spirit which will not long permit men to endure injustice nor to wear the shackles of bondage, in the rage of the powerless when they struggle to be free, and in the violence and conflict which even now threaten to level the hills and the mountains.</page><page sequence="31">224 Journal of Black Studies I Believe that Jesus, the Black Messiah, was a revolutionary leader, sent by God to rebuild the Black Nation Israel and to liberate Black people from powerlessness and from the oppression, brutality, and exploitation of the white gentile world. I Believe that the revolutionary spirit of God, embodied in the Black Messiah, is born anew in each generation and that Black Christian national- ists constitute the living remnant of God's Chosen People in this day, and are charged by Him with the responsibility for the liberation of Black people. I Believe that both my survival and my salvation depend upon my willing- ness to reject individualism and so I commit my life to the Liberation Struggle of Black people and accept the values, ethics, morals and program of the black nation defined by that struggle, and taught by the Pan African Orthodox Christian Church, (p. xiii) On Jesus In the few theological discussions of Garvey, much is made of his doubts about the historicity of Jesus. I believe Garvey on this point to merely be reflecting on the discourse of the day. The form criticism movement's popularity rose at about the same time as Garvey 's. K. L. Schmidt, Martin Dibelius, Rudolf Bultmann, B. S. Easton, and R. H. Lightfoot are credited as being the scholars at the forefront of this movement. In his Bampton Lectures in 1934, Lightfoot (1935) said of form critics, They remind us that the early Church is by no means likely to have expressed itself at once in a literary way, and they believe, first, that in the earliest years memories and traditions of the words and deeds of Jesus were only handed from mouth to mouth, and, secondly, that they were valued, not so much . . . in and for themselves, as for their importance in solving problems connected with the life and needs of the young churches. These needs, they think, would be chiefly concerned with mission preaching, catechetical teaching, demon- stration of the content and meaning of the Christian life, refutation of Jewish and other objections, and perhaps above all worship, (pp. 30-31) For form critics and their adherents, the New Testament served as a poor source for knowledge of the historical Jesus. It would only be consistent with his character for Garvey to be abreast of such radical assertions and, at the very least, incorporate the questions they raised into his own dis- course. On the subject, Garvey stated, "If Christ as man never existed, but was only an assumption it would have been a glorious assumption to set man a spiritual high example of how he should live" (quoted in McLean, 1987, a 56).</page><page sequence="32">Walker / Marcus Garvey and Albert B. Cleage Jr. 225 Still, Garvey 's views on Jesus focused more on the reality of his existence than not. And for Garvey, Jesus was the Son of God, who died to redeem all humankind. Unlike Cleage, who made his position on the humanness of Jesus clear and often, Garvey rarely referred to Jesus as God, but he did at times. Said Garvey, "Never admit that Jesus Christ was a white man, other- wise he would not be the Son of God and God to redeem all mankind" (quoted in McLean, 1987, p. 60). However, Garvey described Jesus in human terms most often. And in so doing, he portrayed Jesus as a Black man. As was previously mentioned, the UNIA officially canonized Jesus as the Black Man of Sorrows and Mary as the Black Madonna in a Liberty Hall service in 1924. In the "School of African Philosophy," Garvey said that Jesus Christ had the blood of all races in his veins, and tracing the Jewish race back to Abraham and to Moses, from which Jesus sprang through the line of Jesse, you will find Negro blood everywhere, so Jesus had much of Negro blood in Him. (quoted in McLean, 1987, p. 60) The Blackness of Jesus was not the only way Garvey showed Blacks having a "claim" on Jesus. The fact that Simon of Cyre carried the cross for Jesus while others harassed him supplied Garvey with proof enough that Blacks have the moral right to claim allegiance with Jesus. In the "School of African Philosophy," Garvey stated, In reading Christian Literature and accepting the doctrine of Jesus Christ lay special claim to your association with Jesus and the Son of God. Show that whilst the white and yellow worlds, that is to say - the worlds of Europe and Asia Minor persecuted and crucified Jesus the Son of God, it was the Black Race through Simon the Black Cyrenian who befriended the Son of God and took up the Cross and bore it alongside of Him to the heights of Calvary. The Roman Catholics, therefore, have no rightful claim to the Cross nor is any other professing Christian before the Negro. The Cross is the property of the Negro in his religion because it was he who bore it. (quoted in McLean, 1987, p. 60) In Jesus, Garvey saw the highest ideal of humanity, love, as central to his teachings. Inasmuch, Jesus was the model for a moral life. Said Garvey, The greatest thing that Christ taught was love. Love thy neighbor as thyself, do unto others as you would have them do unto you. In these statements are wrapt up the highest idealism of a Godhead in the relationship of a father with his children. There has been no greater philosophy in the history of mankind. Support this philosophy and never change until God manifest him- self to the contrary, which is not likely, (quoted in McLean, 1987, p. 58)</page><page sequence="33">226 Journal of Black Studies For Garvey, Jesus also stood as a moral model because of his work as a radical reformer. Jesus' preaching, in Garvey's opinion, was both spiritual and temporal. Said Garvey, When Jesus came, the privileged few were taking advantage of the unfortu- nate masses. Because the teachings of Jesus sought to equalize the spiritual and even the temporal rights of man, those who held authority, sway and dominion, sought His liberty by prosecution, sought His life by death. He was called to yield up that life for the cause He loved - because He was indeed a great reformer, (quoted in McLean, 1987, p. 65) And though Jesus was a Black man who came to the poor and downtrod- den, Garvey's Christ came to radically redeem all, oppressed and oppressor, offering new life in the form of the Kingdom of God. "[Garvey] taught that the Kingdom of God is a consciousness of God given dominion over the things of this world. Garvey challenged the Black race to realize that the Kingdom of God was right within them as Jesus taught" (McLean, 1987, p. 88). Garvey balanced out his view of Jesus as great reformer with that of Jesus as suffering servant. Jesus as great reformer was important for inspir- ing Blacks to live lives dedicated to radical reform, secure in the knowledge that their actions were Christian. Garvey used the model of Jesus as suffer- ing servant as a parallel to the unjust suffering of Blacks. Therefore, Blacks had another vehicle with which to attach themselves to the life and mission of Jesus. Said Garvey, Give us the standard bearer of Christ; let Him lead and we shall follow, Christ the crucified, Christ the despised, we appeal to you for help, for succor and for leadership. . . . Oh Jesus the Christ, oh Jesus the Redeemer, when white men pierced your side out of which blood and water gushed forth, it as a Black man in the person of Simon the Cyrenian who took the Cross and bore it on heights of Calvary. As he bore it in the past to lighten your burden as you climbed your Calvary, so now, when we are climbing our Calvary and the burden being heavy - Jesus we ask You to help us on the journey up the heights, (quoted in McLean, 1987, p. 61) I submit that Garvey also used the suffering servant motif not only to provide his people with a blueprint for leadership but to remind himself of the cost of leadership. For the attacks on Garvey and his movement were bitter and constant, often coming from persons who were formally on Garvey's side in the cause of African redemption. Declared Garvey (1923- 1925/1986) on the "price of leadership,"</page><page sequence="34">Walker / Marcus Garvey and Albert B. Cleage Jr. 227 Those of us who are blazing the way in this new propaganda of the Universal Negro Improvement Association to enlighten our people everywhere are at times very much annoyed and discouraged by the acts of our own people in that consciously or unconsciously they do so many things to hurt our deeper feeling of loyalty and love for the race. But what can we do? Can we forsake them because they hurt our feelings? Surely not. Painful though it may be to be inter- fered with and handicapped in the performance of the higher sense of duty, yet we must, martyr-like, make up our minds and our hearts to pay the price of leadership. We must be sympathetic, we must be forgiving, we must really have forbearance, so that when the ignorant and illiterate fellow who happens to be a member of your own race stands up to block the passage of some cause that you believe would be to his benefit and to yours as a people you will be able to overlook him, even though he fosters his opposition with the greatest amount of insult to your intelligence and to your dignity, (pp. 64-65) For Cleage, there was no doubt about the historical person of Jesus. It is the historical Jesus that Cleage said was lost in the otherworldly theology of the apostle Paul. And it was this historical Jesus who Cleage declared was human, not God. In the sermon "Jesus, the Black Messiah," delivered in December 1992, Cleage said, People said, "[Jesus is] not a man! God just chose to put on human flesh and to die for mankind." The Catholic Church still argues this point and many rural Black Christians will argue the same thing. Perhaps your imagination is better than mine. I don't know how God could put on human flesh and go through the whole process of being born, it is as though God was playing in a little drama of human selection that ended in his death and resurrection. This story that God pretended to be born was conceived by the Church. The idea of God being born into the world as a baby in the womb of a virgin didn't seem real. I know that centuries later you accepted it as true. You read the Christmas story, and it seemed true because it had been handed down for a thousand years. You didn't have any hesitancy about believing it, but you have never been able to conceive of how God could be the physical father of Jesus. Have You? God is the father of Jesus, just like God is the father of everyone! And the term "Son of God" was used in Israel during the life of Jesus, to mean that all men were "Sons of God." (quoted in Ufum, 1995, p. 24) Cleage pointed to the gospels, in which Jesus consistently states his humanness. One such scripture is Matthew 19: 17, which states, "And he said unto him, 'Why callest me good? There is none good but one, that is God.'" Another is John 14: 12, which says, "Truly, truly, I say to you, he who believes</page><page sequence="35">228 Journal of Black Studies in me will also do the works that I do; and even greater works than these will he do, because I go to the Father"; this passage was used by Cleage to show that Jesus saw his actions as very human capable. "Several times Jesus admonishes his disciples for not being able to heal. 'How much longer must I be with you negroes before you understand that God can work through you too?'" explained Cardinal Olu regarding Jesus' humanness (interview, 1997). Said Jaramogi Menelik Kimathi, To make Jesus God strips us of an example, because if Jesus was God, nothing he did took any effort. Jesus had to struggle, just like us. He got mad, just like us. He got frustrated, just like us. He wanted to sleep late sometimes, just like us. He's our example because even though he had the same struggles that we have, his dedication to God and his people pushed him forward despite it all. (interview, 1997) The humanness of Jesus was an important theological point for Cleage because of its ramifications on the church's view of Christian duty and process of salvation. Wrote Cleage (1972/1 987b), "As we see God in Jesus and in the Black Nation Israel, we also see God in Nat Turner, Marcus Garvey, and Brother Malcolm. We are confident that in today's world God speaks to Black people through us" (p. 10). Thus, like Garvey, Cleage viewed Jesus as the standard bearer for aspiring Christians. "For, if the poor Black son of an unwed teenage mother could become the Messiah his people had prayed for and waited for, there is hope for us still," said Cardinal Waganga (interview, 1997). Thus, one's Christian duty consists of seeking to come upon "Christ consciousness" so that said Christian can do what Jesus did, and even greater things. Cleage stated that Jesus became the Messiah not at his birth but at his baptism at the river Jordan. Said Cleage during a December 1992 sermon titled "Who Is Jesus?" John the Baptist called men into the Liberation Movement by calling them to repentance in conformity with the Covenant. His message was "repent for the Kingdom of God is at hand." The important part of the baptism story was the anointment of Jesus by God. At the time of his baptism and not at his birth, Jesus became the Messiah. Jesus was not born a Messiah. He was anointed Messiah by God at the time of his baptism, (quoted in Ufum, 1995, p. 57) This was significant for Cleage theologically because it opens up the possibility of such a baptism to all who seek, like Jesus, to do the will of God. Thus, salvation comes when Christians commit, and then recommit,</page><page sequence="36">Walker / Marcus Garvey and Albert B. Cleage Jr. 229 to the task of seeking the experience of God, which will naturally lead to commitment to the liberation struggle. For Cleage, being saved was not viewed as a one-time occurrence but rather something that happens over and over again. For Cleage, neither Jesus' humanity nor his Blackness was in question. On the ethnic makeup of Jesus' people, Cleage (1972/1987b) wrote, Historically, Christianity is a Black man's religion created out of the experiences of Black people in Africa. This is not to say that Christianity was the one and only Black man's religion. It was the religion of a small, numerically insignifi- cant, mongrel tribe of nomads who wandered for centuries mixing, intermin- gling, and intermarrying with all the peoples of Africa and the Fertile Crescent. They were a Black people racially, culturally, and religiously, (p. 174) "We know that the Israel of the Old Testament was a Black nation. We know that Mary and Joseph and Jesus were Black. So Christianity is founded upon the life and teachings of a Black Messiah," said Cleage (1972/1 987b, p. 45). But "as important as the fact that Israel and Jesus were Black is the fact that Jesus was a revolutionary leader engaged in a Liberation Struggle against the white gentile world" (p. 45). This theme is found throughout Cleage's writings and sermons because it lies at the heart of what Cleage believed Christianity, and religion in general, to be: a process of transformation for a person and for that person's society. Wrote Cleage (1968/1991), Jesus called men to a real decision. In all probability his disciples were already committed to the revolutionary struggle as Zealots before they saw Jesus, but when they heard him, they accepted his leadership and followed him. They were a part of a small underground revolutionary movement which included John the Baptist, dedicated to complete separation from Rome. (p. 61) In Cleage's estimation, the revolution for Jesus took form in serving the needs of his people. Said Cleage, We must understand that Jesus was not preaching that he was going to save mankind by dying on the cross. That idea had not entered his head nor that of his disciples nor anyone else in Israel. Jesus was saying that the spirit of the Lord was upon him because there were certain things that he had to do, and all of them were matters of serving the needs of people. "To proclaim release to the captives, the recovery of sight to the blind, to set at liberty those who are oppressed, and to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord" were all a part of his mission to wipe-out the evils of the world. Our basic confusion</page><page sequence="37">230 Journal of Black Studies today lies in the question of Jesus' basic mission. Was it his death and resur- rection? Or do you follow in the footsteps of Jesus because of the things that he did? (quoted in Ufum, 1995, p. 59) Like Garvey, Cleage viewed love as the core of Jesus' teachings. For Jesus consistently admonished those who chose to honor the letter of the law rather than the spirit behind said law. Cleage made clear his belief that Jesus' message of love was nationalistic. Wrote Cleage (1972/1987b), "Jesus was primarily concerned with building a people, bringing them together, and forming a nation. And this task to which Jesus gave his full commitment was profoundly revolutionary" (p. 41). Commenting on Jesus' triumphal entry into Jerusalem, Cleage (1991) wrote, "Blessed be the Kingdom of our Father, David, that is coming." Historically, the mission of David was to re-establish the Nation. So the emphasis in the triumphant entry was not upon Jesus as an individual who was soon to be crucified and resurrected to bring about some kind of mystical salvation; it was upon Jesus as a prophet who had called a Nation to repentance, a Nation that was coming into being. "Blessed be the Kingdom of our Father, David, that is coming." (p. 76) Cleage went further than Garvey in stating Black people's claim to Jesus. Cleage pointed to several scriptures to validate his point of Jesus' nationalism. Matthew 10:1-16 contains Jesus' instructions to his disciples with regard to their mission. He specifically tells them in verses 5 and 6, "Do not turn your steps toward pagan territory, and do not enter any Samaritan town; go rather to the lost sheep of the House of Israel." Matthew 15:21-28 tells the story of the Canaanite woman who sought healing for her daughter. After ignoring her pleas for help, Jesus responded to his disciple's intercessory pleas on her behalf by telling them, "I was sent only to the lost sheep of the House of Israel." Matthew 18:15-18 deals with Jesus' view on brotherly correction. In verse 17, after stressing the point of going the extra mile with one's brother or sister who has wronged one, Jesus states, "But if he refuses to listen to these, report it to the community; and if he refuses to listen to the community, treat him like a pagan or a tax collector." Wrote Cleage (1972/1987b), One of the most confusing teachings of Jesus has to do with the love ethic which the Apostle Paul attempted to universalize. Jesus was defining a tribal</page><page sequence="38">Walker / Marcus Garvey and Albert B. Cleage Jr. 23 1 ethic for the Black National Israel. He was trying to bring together a people who were oppressed and who had been fragmented by their oppression, (p. 39) Thus, Black people must understand that only within the Black Nation do we turn the other cheek. We turn the other cheek only to a Black brother or a Black sister. We do not turn the other cheek in any other situation, (p. xxxiii) Here, Cleage emphatically rejected the notion of Jesus' message as one of universal love. Cleage believed that to best understand the historical Jesus, we had to view him in light of the struggles of Israel in the Old Testament. For Cleage viewed Jesus as an extension of that same struggle against oppression. And as such, Jesus' life was one filled with conflict and confrontation. He was in conflict with the Roman state because of its oppressive position over Israel. He was in conflict with the Jewish aristocracy, who aided Rome in their own people's oppression. He constantly confronted his disciples and Israel with the realization that change first had to come from inside of them. On Humanity Basic to Garvey 's theology of humanity was the belief that people reflect the nature of God. Garvey saw God as creative, powerful, and active. Humans were not living up to their God-given abilities and duties if their lives reflected lesser attributes. This view of humanity was shaped by Garvey's belief in the inherent goodness of creation. Garvey "saw human culture as a process within and part of a wider cosmic process." This process was leading to Africa's ultimate redemption. Thus, inherent in Garvey's view of humanity was his view of humanity's mission: to live out the attributes of God. Black people were expected by Garvey to become creative, powerful, and active participants on the world stage. Said Garvey, Do you know what it is to be a man? To be a man is to bear the semblance of my Creator, the image of my Creator. If you are conscious of the fact that you were created in the image of your Creator, then you realize that you are a man. Man is the supreme lord, the supreme master of the world, (quoted in McLean, 1987, p. 55) For Garvey, being created in the image of God meant being created out of the very substance of God. On this point, Garvey believed, as did ancient</page><page sequence="39">232 Journal of Black Studies African religionists before him and modern physicists in the years following, in seeing the connectedness and cycle of all life. Said Garvey on the subject of the fear of death, Man never dies. Nothing dies. Man is made of body and spirit. The spirit is God. It is intelligence. The body of man is matter. It changes from living matter in the man to other matter in the soil. It is always the same matter. It doesn't die in the sense of how we understand death. It changes. When man sleeps and passes away in the flesh, he goes to earth that lives on, out of which other men and things are formed. All matter is related as man is related and the earth related to man. We eat ourselves over and over. When we eat the apples, the banana, the fig, the cherry and the grape, when we drink the water, we are eating and drinking ourselves over and over again, so nothing is lost and nothing dies. So do not be afraid of death because what you call death is only change and you are still in the universe, either in the Spirit of God to whom your spirit goes after the change or as matter which goes on forever, (quoted in McLean, 1987, pp. 80-81) Another theme basic to Garvey's theology of humanity was the equality of all. Garvey was quoted as saying that God was on the side of the strongest battalion. This should not be taken to mean that Garvey believed that God favored the race in power at that time. Rather, the quotation reflects Garvey's view that all people are created equal and that the Black race had failed to exert its equality, choosing rather to find solace in the misguided belief that God favored Black people because of their lowly state. Speaking on the difference between the stronger and weaker races, Garvey said, The difference between the strong and weak races is that the strong races seem to know themselves; seem to discover themselves; seem to realize and know fully that there is but a link between them and the Creator; that above them there is no other but God and anything that bears human form is but their equal in standing and to that form there should be no obeisance; there should be no regard for superiority. Because of that feeling they have been able to take care of the situation as it confronts them in nature; but because of our lack of faith and confidence in ourselves we have caused others created in a like image to ourselves to take advantage of us for hundreds of years. (McLean, 1987, p. 70) Garvey also often pointed to the history of Whites as a means of proving his point about the equality of all. He said, It is the progress of the Anglo-Saxons that singles them out for the respect of all the world. When their race had no progress or achievement to its credit,</page><page sequence="40">Walker / Marcus Garvey and Albert B. Cleage Jr. 233 then, like all other inferior peoples, they paid the price in slavery, bondage, as well as through prejudice. We cannot forget the time when even the ancient Briton was regarded as being too dull to make a good Roman slave, yet today the influence of that race rules the world. (Garvey, 1923-1925/1986, p. 22) Garvey saw humanity as endowed with all the attributes of God, but with the choice and free will to use them or not. Thus, for Garvey, evil was a very real part of human nature. Moreover, Garvey believed that Blacks had to be transformed from the drive for individual fulfillment over and above fulfill- ment of the race. To this end, Garvey offered no process or program beyond "knowing self." Said Garvey, If four hundred million Negroes can only get to know themselves, to know that in them is a sovereign power, is an authority that is absolute, then in the next twenty-four hours we would have a great empire resurrected not from the will of others to see us rise, but from our own determination to rise irrespective of what the world thinks, (quoted in McLean, 1987, p. 72) Emphasis on this one point indicates the greatest difference between the programs of Garvey and Cleage. Although they both believed in the spiritual as well as temporal importance of humanity knowing itself, Cleage placed transformation as the top religious and revolutionary priority. For Cleage, transformation was a group dynamic. For Garvey, religion was something that could not be eliminated from humanity's system. It kept humankind from being reduced to savagery. But Garvey did not see the transformative power that Cleage saw in religion. Garvey believed every person to be a religious island unto his or her self. Garvey was apparently strongly influenced by the belief in the priesthood of all believers. Thus, he was able to say, You can worship God by yourself. You are responsible to God by yourself. You have to live your own soul before God. Nobody but yourself can save your soul. Others may advise you because of your ignorance of life how to shape your soul. Keep in communion with God. But none can save your soul but yourself in your soul relation with God. (quoted in McLean, 1987, p. 92) Cleage, like Garvey, believed humanity to reflect the nature of God. In fact, Cleage believed that because human beings were created out of "the substance of God," there is divinity within each person (God incarnate). Jesus provided Cleage with the model of what any human being can achieve (Christ consciousness). "The life-force or incarnate divinity in each individual</page><page sequence="41">234 Journal of Black Studies is the Divinity placed in man at the moment of creation," wrote Cleage (1972/1987b,p. 7). Central to Cleage's theology was the belief that people are energy beings. This was consistent with his belief that God is cosmic energy and creative intelligence. Humans are but compressed energy. As such, humans are made of the same "stuff' as God. The theological ramifications of this are that humans are always connected to God, one another, and all of creation. Thus, this cosmic web of interconnectedness means that the actions of any one person or thing affect all in some way. Humans by nature are required to act in accordance with the unity and harmony of all creation. For Cleage, such actions were capable only in a communal society. Thus, communalism was not simply a socioeconomic statement but a theological one. Humans living communally, looking out for the well-being of others, set in motion positive energy for the entire universe. Humans living in accordance to this harmony were said to be vibrating on the same frequency as all of creation. Wrote Cleage (1972/1987b), The essence of all being is energy. The Church seeks to utilize this energy system upon which life depends by bringing together a fellowship of persons who practice the disciplines, rituals and sacraments which open the individual for both the Experience of God and the Experience of Community, (p. 131) Thus, for Cleage, the human mission of personal and social transfor- mation was an energy issue. Personal and social problems were defined in terms of blocked energy. Thus, the unblocking or opening of persons to the energy and power already available to them was a necessary precursor to social transformation. KUA, the science of becoming what you already are, seeks to open members to self, others, and thus to God. Wrote Cleage (1972/1 987b), "Black people must find healing in the fellowship and program of a Transforming Community designed to help them remove blocks which prevent the experiencing of the Group" (p. 5). Like Garvey, Cleage believed in the equality of all humankind. Hence, Cleage rejected the notion of Whites as devils, as taught by W. D. Fard, Elijah Muhammad, and the Nation of Islam. Wrote Cleage (1972/1987b) of Whites, "There were never good white people and bad white people. There were just white people controlled by the institutional structure created to serve their interests" (p. 131). Cleage's belief in the divinity of humanity was coupled with his belief in humanity's penchant for acting individualistically (the ultimate sin in a communal, interconnected universe). Thus, like Garvey, Cleage affirmed the</page><page sequence="42">Walker / Marcus Garvey and Albert B. Cleage Jr. 235 inherent goodness of God's creation while still believing in humanity's ability to do evil. Cleage did not attribute this evil to humanity's fall from God's grace because of the original sin of "Adam." For Cleage, there was no chasm separating humanity from God aside from humanity's own selfishness and individualism that cut off awareness of the connection to God, but not the actual connection. This is consistent with Cleage's belief that humans are energy beings, connected to the greater energy source, which is God. For Cleage, humanity has the ability to choose to function selfishly or selflessly. The determining factor is one's environment. An environment that focuses on a communal, selfless lifestyle will enable people to function accordingly. Societies that are individualistic in nature condition people to live as such. Wrote Cleage (1972/1 987b), It is difficult to lose oneself in the group experience in the Western world because all the restrictions and social controls of white society are designed to strengthen the individual's sense of separation from other individuals. The white man feels that venturing out upon the oceanic feeling of togetherness is at best a weakness, and at worst a sensual primitive sin. Everything in the Western world is designed to preserve the icy walls of individualism. The white man struggles to maintain his egocentric psychological isolation so that at the moment of death he can lay at his Savior's feet a stunted, malformed personality fetus which he dared not permit to live. (p. 68) As has been stated, Cleage rejected the view of Whites as devils as is the belief of the "new Black cultural mythology." Cleage's (1972/1987b) com- ments on this subject speak to his belief in the equality of all: In reality we are dealing with a man with a human nature just like our own, but with power. We ought to realize that this is what power does to human nature. This is reality. The white man is not a beast. He's not a devil. He's just a human being with power. A human being will do anything to get power and to keep power. There are no limitations to what a man will do for power. He'll kill his own mother and find good reasons to explain why it had to be done. We must look honestly at the white man and realize that he demonstrates the effects of power upon any individual who is not protected against it by ade- quate group controls. As Black men get little bits of power they become a little bestial. Even as Black men scramble after individual power they become bestial. This "beast" idea is only a question of power, (p. 101) Thus, in the Black quest for power, a new value system must be created that places power "within a communal framework that will enable us to preserve our humanity."</page><page sequence="43">236 Journal of Black Studies On Salvation To talk about Garvey and Cleage's definitions of salvation, I think it important to first mention from what they are trying to save Black people and all humanity. The few theological studies done on Garvey fail to mention Garvey's theological position on sin. This is due in large part to the fact that Garvey rarely spoke of sin in terms of providing a concise definition. What Garvey did, however, was mention those things he viewed as abominations and insults to God. Because these things were mentioned as oppositions and roadblocks to the fulfilling of the redemption of Africa (salvation), it is safe to say that said actions constituted sin for Garvey. Said Garvey (1923-1925/1986), "Fear is a state of nervousness fit for children and not men. When man fears a creature like himself he offends God, in whose image and likeness he is created. Man being created equal fears not man but God" (p. 3). Thus, to Garvey, fear was a sin. For it hin- dered many Blacks from asserting their God-given equality. Another insult hurled up to God by humanity (specifically Black humanity) was belief in the God-ordained placement of Blacks in the class of peon and serf. Said Garvey (1923-1925/1986), Some of us seem to accept the fatalist position, the fatalist attitude, that God accorded to us a certain position and condition, and therefore there is no need trying to be otherwise. The moment you accept such an attitude, the moment you accept such an opinion, the moment you harbor such an idea, you hurl an insult at the great God who created you, because you question Him for His love, you question Him for His mercy. God has created man, and has placed him in this world as the lord of the creation, as the sovereign of everything that you see. ... All that you see in creation, all that you see in the world, was created by God for the use of man, and you four hundred million black souls have as much right to your possession in this world as any other race, (pp. 89-90) Thus, for Garvey, sin could be defined by a particular state of being. This would also be true for the Black race's state of dependence on other races for life necessities. Garvey stated over and over that God created all equal, and all to be lords of creation. Thus, a people who accepted any station in life less than a "lord of creation" were in sin. There were also specific acts that could be defined as sin for Garvey. The aforementioned worshipping of divine images from other cultures and experiences would be an example of such. Being a race traitor would be</page><page sequence="44">Walker / Marcus Garvey and Albert B. Cleage Jr. 237 another. A traitor by Garvey's definition was any Black who sought to lead Black people toward integration, which Garvey equated with racial death. Also, any actions that reflected sloth, neglect, or indifference could be clas- sified as sin for Garvey. Sin for Garvey was not confined to the individual. Corporate sin was very real for Garvey. Said Garvey (1923-1925/1986), "As Negroes, no one suffers from the infliction of injustice more than we do. It is practiced against us in every walk of life - politically, socially, industrially, education- ally, commercially, judicially, and even religiously" (p. 12). Although Garvey voiced the belief that Jesus was the redeemer of all mankind, he concerned himself with salvation on this side of the grave. Jesus served to empower humanity to work for their redemption. Wrote Burkett (1978), "Garvey rarely spoke of a life after death and he never spoke of it in compensatory terms so as to suggest that injustices of the present would be rectified on the other side of the grave" (p. 83). For Garvey, neither was the Bible the key to salvation in and of itself. Said Garvey (1923-1925/1986), I am not one of those Christians who believe that the Bible can solve all the problems of humanity. The Bible is good in its place, but we are men. We are the creatures of God. We have sinned against Him, therefore it takes more than the Bible to keep us in our places, (p. 9) Salvation for Garvey came through human efforts for self-determination, not through Jesus or God. Said Garvey, "God is not going to save you. He has done all He possibly could: He has given you a life to live, and if you do not exercise your own will in your own behalf you will be lost" (quoted in Burkett, 1978, p. 66). Garvey had many words of disapproval for reli- gionists of all faiths who presented Blacks with the scenario of salvation after death. Wrote Martin (1976) in Race First, "[Garvey] disapproved also of Jamaican prophets and prophetesses who are going to fly Heavenward for the solution of the Negro problem" (p. 74). Although Garvey was not an advocate for promoting salvation after death, his eschatological expectation of a redeemed Africa was a picture that he painted in terms of being alive to experience the rewards as often as he portrayed it as something that those working toward its end presently may never see but is sure to come. For Garvey, however, part of the "reward" of Africa's redemption and salvation came during the day-to-day work to bring that vision to fruition. For in the struggle came the courage, confidence, conviction, and action that would bring its success. Said Garvey, speaking with a familiar note of apocalypticism,</page><page sequence="45">238 Journal of Black Studies Keep your eyes steadfast on the object, and what is it? It is the emancipation of four hundred million souls. It is the freeing of our own country Africa and the making of it a great United States, a powerful government, not to be con- trolled by alien races, but to be dominated by ourselves. This is the object, this is the vision, for this we live, and for this we will die. . . . As the war clouds gather let us gird our loins and in greater numbers and stronger determination hold fast until the hour comes, and come it surely will. . . . Four hundred million Negroes [are] ready for the march toward African redemption, (quoted in Burkett, 1978, p. 83) Central to Garvey's belief of salvation was the theme of power - for the individual and the race. A common utterance of Garvey's was "Man, know thyself." Garvey believed that much of the power Black people had but failed to use was due to a lack of self-knowledge. The knowledge of self Garvey referred to was that God had created Blacks equal to all. Said Garvey often, "Whatsoever man has done, man can do." Another aspect of that lacking self-knowledge centered around lack of knowledge of historical African achievements and contributions. Said Garvey (1923-1925/1986), When Europe was inhabited by a race of cannibals, a race of savages, naked men, heathens and pagans, Africa was peopled with a race of cultured Black men, who were masters in art, science and literature; men who were cultured and refined; men who, it is said, were like gods. (p. 77) Power for Garvey was a very tangible, outward reality. Power in every aspect was the goal for which Garvey said Blacks aspire: Gradually, even though slowly, we are getting to realize that the fight is now or never. We have to fight for a place in the world if we must exist; that place is not going to be yielded up to us by philanthropy, by charity, but only through that stronger power that will compel others to give us that which is our due. I say POWER because it is necessary. Except the individual, the race or the nation has power that is exclusive; it means that that individual, that race or that nation will be bound by the will of the other who possesses this great qualifi- cation; hence it is advisable for the Negro to get power; get power of every kind, power in education, in science, in industry, in politics, in higher govern- ment, and physically. We want that kind of power that will stand out signally so that other races and nations can see, and if they won't see, feel. POWER is the only argument that satisfies man. Man is not satisfied; neither is he moved by prayers, by petitions, but every man is moved by that power of authority which forces him to do, even against his will. . . . The only advice I can give the Negro is to get power, (quoted in McLean, 1987, pp. 82-83)</page><page sequence="46">Walker / Marcus Garvey and Albert B. Cleage Jr. 239 For Garvey, inner and outer power would save Black people from their sins of sloth, passivity, dependence, and the worshipping of the sacred images of others. Many of Garvey's components of sin are encompassed in Cleage's def- inition of sin. Said Cleage, "For us, individualism is the unpardonable sin because it separates a man from his Black brothers and sisters, who consti- tute his only channel of communication with God" (Cleage, 1972/1987b, p. 69). A different PAOCC definition that says the same thing states that sin is any thought or action that serves to alienate one from another. "Sin is not doing that which you are intended to do," said Cardinal Kimathi. We were intended to live in unity, harmony, and power, reflecting the aspects of God. However, we live lives thinking only of self, thus there is no unity and much disharmony. And as a result, we are kept powerless because of our disunity. We live in sin. (interview, 1997) Salvation for Cleage, then, dealt with the process of moving people from individualism to communalism. And because in Cleage's theological view, our relationships with one another constitute our relationship with God, moving from individualism to communalism was actually reconciliation with God. Such a feat must be done, said Cleage, in a group setting. For salva- tion in particular and religion in general come about as a result of a process. Stated Cleage (1972/1987b), "People change as a result of a group process. It is the constant pressure and love of a community committed to change that transforms people" (p. 2). It is this process, or lack thereof, that, in Cleage's estimation, rendered the Black church unable to change people. The impotence of the Black church lies in its inability to move people from individualism to communalism. It has no method by which it can effectively change people. It does not even pose the question so that people can turn sadly aside, as did the rich young ruler in the Gospels. (Cleage, 1972/1 987b, p. 69) Cleage looked to the group as the agency that could mediate the power of God. This aspect of his theology was informed by biblical witness and testimonies of African religionists. Cleage pointed to the fact that all prophets were called to serve the interests of the group. He also emphasized Jesus' passionate drive to form an intimate group. Cleage also looked to the power the disciples received at Pentecost when they came back together as a group and formed a church that was group focused, where everyone gave as they were able and received as they had need.</page><page sequence="47">240 Journal of Black Studies Cleage also referred often to testimonies of great healing power ema- nating from African healing rituals, such as those found in Katz's (1982) Boiling Energy, that center on the Kung nation of southern Africa: For the Kung, healing is more than curing, more than the application of med- icine. Healing seeks to establish health and growth on physical, psychologi- cal, social, and spiritual levels; it involves work on the individual, the group, and the surrounding environment and cosmos. Healing pervades Kung culture, as a fundamental integrating and enhancing force. The culture's emphasis on sharing and egalitarianism, its vital life of the spirit and strong community, are expressed in and supported by the healing tradition. The central event in this tradition is the all-night healing dance, (p. 34) For Cleage, this group process was a necessity for Black people because of the overwhelming amount of messages in Western society promoting individualism. Another reason why the group process was so critical was because Blacks have been conditioned for 400 years to believe and accept the white man's Declaration of the Myth of Black Inferiority (DBI). Add to this is the fact that Blacks have been and are still the victims of an ongoing Black Holocaust, and the need for a process that seeks to counter the "niggerizing" process is obvious, said Cardinal Mbiyu Chui (interview, 1997), pastor of Shrine #1 in Detroit. Cleage believed that there is no salvation outside of the church. Important to note here is that Cleage's definition of church constitutes the church as movement struggling for Black liberation. Outside of the Black liberation struggle, then, there was no means of salvation for Black people. Another reason Cleage saw salvation as housed within the church was the fact that church to Cleage was a communal group in which God-power was mediated. Thus, outside of this sacred circle, there was no salvation. Like Garvey, Cleage did not see Jesus' death on the cross providing sal- vation for Black people 2,000 years later. Wrote Cleage (1972/1987b), "The theological basis for the gospel of liberation can be found in the life and teachings of Jesus. Not in his death, but in his life and in his willing- ness to die for the Black Nation" (p. 188). Black people working toward inner and outer transformation are saved by giving their lives to the church, to the struggle. For Cleage, the process of salvation, participating in the group process for inner transformation, was not an end in itself. Individuals were saved or</page><page sequence="48">Walker / Marcus Garvey and Albert B. Cleage Jr. 241 transformed that they may be able to save and transform the world. The ulti- mate goal for Cleage was the creation of a promised land or kingdom of God here on earth. Wrote Cleage (1972/1987b) of the promised land: A Nation's search for a Promised Land flowing with milk and honey, where every man can sit with dignity under his own vine and fig tree, is a basic part of the religious experience. A Nation has a right to expect its religious insti- tution to be engaged in the task of building a Promised Land. A religious institution which is not so engaged serves no valid institutional purpose. The search for a Promised Land is basic in the Old Testament and in the teachings of Jesus. But men did not always clearly understand what they were doing. They would get confused and interpret the Promised Land in purely geo- graphical terms. They would get possession of a piece of land and think they had it. Then they would degenerate and start fighting and exploiting each other and they would lose the Promised Land, because they had identified with it geographically. The Promised Land is a group of people living together and sharing a communal way of life with love for each other. It is not a place but a way of life. (pp. 202-203) Said another way, The story of the Promised Land did not begin with Moses and it did not end when Israel fought its way into Canaan. The Promised Land is a state of being in which people achieve the kind of existence God intended men to have. (p. 207) Because "a people without institutions that serve their interests are powerless. They are a non-people, and for all practical purposes they do not exist," Cleage's base level definition of salvation would be institutional power for Black self-determination. Cleage saw conflict at some level as inevitable, if only for the historical fact that those with power have never freely shared it with those without. Cleage (1972/1987b) gave directions for Black people regarding the struggle for power in very pragmatic terms, with a realistic social analysis: In a world of constant tension and conflict, what are we to do? Black Christian Nationalists try to secure enough power to maintain real tension. The absence of real tension produces power for and oppression by one group, and powerlessness and rage for the other group, (p. 61) Thus, the material manifestation of Cleage's promised land was actually a world with a balance of power. Wrote Cleage (197271987b), "The Black</page><page sequence="49">242 Journal of Black Studies Nation is important because we do not want to become the 'beast' that the white man has become. We want to secure power within a communal frame- work that will enable us to preserve our humanity" (p. 102). Cleage (1972/1987b), sounding almost word for word like Garvey, wrote, "'Created in the image of God' means that we are willing to stand up like men, to defend our own people like men, and to defend our commu- nities like men" (p. 199). Cleage preached that inner transformation would help Black people fight off the sin of individualism, thus allowing them to work together in harmony to create those things necessary to live in accor- dance with the will of God. Ecclesiological Views The theologies of Garvey and Cleage are relatively the same. There are marked differences at some points in what they espoused verbally. But in practice, their theologies are almost identical. The main differences between Garvey and Cleage lie in their positions on ecclesiology with regard to their movements. Where does the church fit into the liberation struggle of Black people? Said McLean, the UNIA "was by no means only a religious movement; but without appreciating the centrality of its theological dimensions, one cannot fully grasp either the UNIA or it enormous appeal among a wide range of Black people." Continued McLean, "Garvey sought to cast the UNIA into an all-embracing institution," but he did not want to do so by establishing one institutional church. An unsigned article that appeared in Negro World on August 4, 1923, stated the following: The churches were not doing the work undertaken by Marcus Garvey, yet some preachers are among the crusaders. A full explanation of their attitude might be pretty hard to arrive at and harder to state without entering on con- tentious matter. It is enough simply to point out the obvious fact that Negro churches are divided, in some cases forbidden to work together with other movements, and they furnish no convenient meeting ground for united work. Only a movement that welcome all people of all denominations and is officially attached to none while having its own assembly halls can spread its net wide enough together in all people desiring to identify with it. (quoted in McLean, 1987, pp. 91-92) The UNIA's chaplain-general, Bishop George Alexander McGuire, was in favor of creating an organization church. McGuire envisioned the church</page><page sequence="50">Walker / Marcus Garvey and Albert B. Cleage Jr. 243 he founded, the AOC, as filling that role. Garvey, however, was empathie in having the UNIA adhere to his position, as is attested by the following notice that appeared in Negro World: NOTICE! NOTICE! This Association has no connection with any other Organization, Church or Movement, and any one who claims that their par- ticular Organization, Church or Movement is the same [as] the Universal Negro Improvement Association is endeavoring to deceive. . . . We are in sympathy with all Negro Churches, but we have no particular Church to support. Any information to the contrary is deceptive, (quoted in Burkett, 1978, p. 130) Garvey held this position for several reasons. First, there were many Christian denominations and other faiths represented in the UNIA. There was also the problem of the great diversity of the very active clergy members in the UNIA. One sixth of all who signed the charter document of the UNIA, the "Declaration of Rights," were clergy women and clergymen. Clergy from all denominations filled nearly every leadership position available. And there were several influential clergypersons who never joined the UNIA but helped out by offering their churches as UNIA meeting space, assisting with advertising and promotions, and securing legal help for Blacks asso- ciated with the UNIA, adding to the organization's credibility. Another factor affecting Garvey's decision against forming an organiza- tional church was his respect for various faith traditions. Said Garvey, Man is a religious being, that is to say, he must have some kind of belief - call it superstition or what not. Man who has started to think traces his origin beyond man; and as such has been groping in the dark to find out the source from whence he came, and by our own intuition we have attributed that source to something beyond us; and in so believing we accept the idea of religion. Some make our God the God of Fire; some make our God the God of Water; some make our God the God of Elements and others of us accept the Christian belief. Man's religion is something we cannot eliminate from his system or destroy in him; therefore, it is folly for any man to go about attack- ing another man's religion, because to him it is fundamental. You may be a Christian; you may be a Mohammedan; that is your religion. We are all enti- tled to our own religious beliefs. Some of us are Catholics, some of us are Presbyterians, some of us are Baptists, and we deem it a right to adhere to our particular belief, (quoted in McLean, 1987, p. 97) Garvey also expressed beliefs that showed his opinion of the church to be low. Thus, it would stand to reason that if Garvey held the church as</page><page sequence="51">244 Journal of Black Studies institution in low esteem, he would be against setting up an organizational church. This low opinion of Black churches was due in part to his view that several Black preachers were corrupt. Garvey spoke on Whites working to seduce Black preachers into taking part in moneymaking scandals, with the Black preachers first "gathering together as many religious suckers as possible, to worship in a sufficiently accommodating building, and then selling them through sermon and prayer on the idea of using all church funds toward buying a newer and bigger church" (Garvey, 1923-1925/1986, p. 289). Wrote Martin (1976) in Race First, "Garvey described himself as a Christian driven from the church by such actions as the pope's blessing of Italian fascists en route to their invasion of Ethiopia" (p. 71). Garvey also denounced Black churches that were content to emulate White churches. Although nearly all UNIA members voiced an acceptance of the "God of Ethiopia," Garvey's many statements on Blacks' rejecting White religion spoke more to his ultimate vision than to his present reality. The Negro is now accepting the religion of the real Christ, not the property- robbing, gold-stealing, diamond-exploiting Christ, but the Christ of Love, Justice and Mercy. The Negro wants no more of the white man's religion as it applies to his race, for it is a lie and a farce; it is propaganda pure and simple to make fools of a race and rob the precious world, the gift of God to man, and to make it the exclusive home of pleasure, prosperity and happiness for those who have enough intelligence to realize that god made them masters of their fate and architects of their own destinies. (Martin, 1976, p. 71) Another reason for the UNIA's not becoming a movement church was Garvey's belief in the priesthood of all believers. Said Garvey, "You can worship God by yourself." Thus, with this view, there was no need for the UNIA to become a church. Members could fully participate in the struggle for African redemption, confident that their personal prayers of faith were being answered outside of the confines of the UNIA fellowship. Still another reason why the UNIA did not become a movement church was Garvey's belief in the power of rational argument in persuading people to accept total commitment to a cause. Garvey believed that only the lack of a proper argument kept most Blacks out of the UNIA. On the subject of soliciting the support of Black ministers, Garvey said, In approaching ministers of the gospel, be always diplomatic enough to con- vince them of the Christian policy of the organization. The willingness of the organization to support the cause of the Christian religion. If the preacher is won over and himself contributes, you may get further assistance from him</page><page sequence="52">Walker / Marcus Garvey and Albert B. Cleage Jr. 245 by seeking permission to speak to his congregation. . . . No preacher should be left until he has consented to help in some way, as there is no greater way of the Church showing willingness to expand the functions of the Church than by helping a cause like that of the UNIA. If a preacher refuses, it is evident that he has not been in touch with the proper argument or that he is positively selfish, (quoted in Burkett, 1978, pp. 189-190) Garvey found opposition to his position on ecclesiology from his own chaplain-general, Bishop George Alexander McGuire. McGuire, born in Sweets, Antigua, in 1866, was involved in the church from his youth. McGuire's entire adult life was spent preparing to serve or actually serving as assistant or head pastor to several churches. Although baptized in the Anglican Church (the church of his father), and receiving early theological training in a Moravian-sponsored seminary (the faith of his mother), McGuire was confirmed in the Protestant Episcopal church. From there, he served at various churches. McGuire grew frustrated as he tried unsuccess- fully to start a Black branch of the Episcopal church, as was in existence for Black Methodists and Baptists. Still, McGuire managed to find his way to St. Bartholomew's, a Black congregation in Boston that had separated itself from the White-controlled congregation of St. Peter's. He served as the first rector there from 1909 to 191 1. Shortly thereafter, McGuire returned to the West Indies to visit his mother and to repair the damaged parish of St. Paul's, the church of his baptism. There for six years, McGuire had ample time to be exposed to the new movement of racial pride that sprang up on the neighboring island of Jamaica during the summer of 1914, the UNIA. And though it is unclear when McGuire officially became a UNIA member, by 1919, he was an active participant. McGuire's strong race views put him theologically in line with Garvey and called for the redemption of Africa, saying, "They call us the white man's burden, and I hope that burden will keep him down until we get back to our homeland. We don't want anything from the white man except what is ours by divine right" (quoted in Burkett, 1978, p. 101). McGuire's strong church background no doubt influenced his views on the importance of an institutional church for the UNIA. As chaplain-general of the UNIA, McGuire wasted no time compiling the Universal Negro Ritual and the Universal Negro Catechism. Both documents, McGuire envi- sioned, would be circulated to all UNIA branches and adhered to by local chaplains. In so doing, McGuire sought to bring about uniformity of UNIA rituals, prayers, songs, and worship. The "Baptism and Dedication of Infants," found in the Universal Negro Ritual, called for infants to be baptized not only into the Christian faith but also into the UNIA.</page><page sequence="53">246 Journal of Black Studies The Universal Negro Catechism was viewed by McGuire as an important instrument by which the history, purpose, and theology of the UNIA could be disseminated both among the children who were tutored in it, and by the parents who would be forced to become familiar with it in the process of teaching their youngsters its contents, (quoted in Burkett, 1978, p. Ill) McGuire's vision of these two tools helping formalize a distinct UNIA faith apparently never materialized, due in large part to resistance from various denominational clergypersons. Still, McGuire's initial vision of an African Episcopal church turned to aspirations for the founding of an all-encompassing "African or Ethiopian church." A Negro World article reported McGuire's aspirations as follows: Archbishop McGuire feels himself fully equipped and authorized for the large work entrusted to his care and supervision, and hopes to prove himself truly an Episcopus, or overseer, of the Church for which Negroes everywhere are looking. When Dr. McGuire left the Church of England in 1919, he left behind him the fragile theory and doctrine of "Apostolic Succession." He believes in the validity of non-Episcopal ordinations; he believe that the time has come for church unity among Negroes; he believes that unity does not necessarily mean uniformity in worship, and that the coming African or Ethiopian Church will be big enough for all negroes to enter, retaining their own worship as Methodists, Baptists, Episcopalians, etc. . . . We are not concerned about white Episcopalians, or Negroes still in the Anglican Church. But we are concerned about Ethiopians and the Ethiopian Church. Ethiopia is stretching out of the land of our fathers. . . . The Negroes of the world in convention assembled [i.e., the August 1920 Convention of the Negro Peoples of the World] made the Most Rev. Dr. G. A. McGuire the first prince of the Church Ethiopia. We understand that plans are under way for his enthronement at the coming Convention in August next, (quoted in Burkett, 1978, pp. 124-125) Interestingly, the above article sounds like an attempt to merge the two conflicting ecclesiological positions. This, however, was never to happen. The incorporation of McGuire's first Independent Episcopal Church, the Church of the Good Shepherd, in April 1920 was but a precursor to the founding of the AOC, which took place in September 1921. But because McGuire had named himself bishop and James N. Brigeman as auxiliary bishop of the Independent Episcopal Church, and appeared to have promoted</page><page sequence="54">Walker / Marcus Garvey and Albert B. Cleage Jr. 247 it as the official UNIA church, McGuire and Garvey had an ecclesiological falling out that ended with McGuire being ousted from the UNIA and even- tually labeled a traitor to the race. Many articles followed in Negro World clarifying the organization's position of openness to all churches and denominations, with total allegiance to none. By 1924, McGuire had been reinstated as a member of the UNIA and was named the honorary chaplain-general. From that point on, still as head of the AOC, McGuire complied with Garvey's position on ecclesiology. For Cleage, the church was at the heart of the Black liberation struggle. In fact, the church was the movement. Said Cleage (1972/1 987b), When a movement becomes a church its meaning and dynamics usually die. Jesus headed a movement. The Apostle Paul established churches. People who come together to do something with Jesus became, with the Apostle Paul, a group of people waiting for God to do something for them. With our emphasis on building a movement, much of the nonsense which characterizes the tra- ditional Black church program will be discarded, (p. 16) Thus, for Cleage, the church was not a group of individuals engaged in the task of assisting one another to find their way to heaven after death, but a vital part of the movement seeking to build a heaven on earth. It is precisely this definition of church as movement that made it impossible for Cleage to conceive of a liberation struggle without the church at the center. Cleage (1972/1987b) explained his position by describing the two processes in which Black people are involved: Old Black theology holds that worldly problems are not relevant to man's basic struggle for his soul's salvation. So the church constitutes a process sep- arate and apart from the everyday process of living. Black people then are involved in two separate processes. One is the religious process of preparing for death and the hereafter, which is completely unrelated to the other, which is the process of trying to survive here on earth. Two-thirds of the wealth, resources, and leadership of the Black community are devoted to the religious process of preparing Black people for heaven. On the other hand, the survival process is almost without organization, resources, or leadership. Black people do not know what to do about their real problems and generally have no place to turn for help. Most Black leadership is either tied up in the heaven process or is subservient to it for reasons of political expediency, (pp. 47-48) Cleage viewed focusing on the survival process as central to the religion of Israel and the teachings of Jesus. Thus, "Somehow we must merge the</page><page sequence="55">248 Journal of Black Studies two separate processes present in the Black community. The task of deliv- erance must become a single process including the totality of life" (Cleage, 1972/1987b, p. 50). Another reason why the church was at the center of Cleage's movement was his belief in the imperativeness of the building of Black-controlled institutions. On this point, Cleage (1972/1 987b) stated, We begin with the basic premise that the Black church is essential to the Liberation Struggle, because it is controlled by Black people and is capable of being restructured to serve the Black Revolution. We also assume that a Black Revolution is impossible unless Black people are able to build an entire system of counter-institutions, created and designed to serve the interests of Black people as all American institutions now serve the white-supremacy interests of white people. To build a system of counter-institutions we must first build one basis Black institution which has the acceptance of the masses of Black people, facilities and economic stability is not directly dependent on the hostile white world, and the capability to spin off all other institutions needed for the estab- lishment of a Black Nation within a nation, (pp. 173-174) For Cleage, the Black church was that one institution with all the neces- sary ingredients for spinning off all other needed institutions. For Cleage, the personal transformation so vital to the success of the strug- gle could come only via the group process mentioned previously. This made total acceptance of one faith, position, ideology, and program, and adherence to a clearly defined chain of command, crucial to mission success. Without this, the group had no parameters within which to operate, and no commonly accepted authority over members, and thus no way of affecting change. Cleage pointed to Jesus as an adherent to this form of group process. Adherence to one program was also crucial in that it helped Blacks move to the position of finally being able to delegate real authority to a Black leader or institution. Another reason for Cleage's ecclesiological stance was the fact that he gave top priority to personal transformation. This was so because of the debilitating effects of the psychological damage done to all Black people (niggerization, posttraumatic slavery syndrome, etc.). Also, Cleage believed that Black unity simply for its own sake was a waste of time: "Being Black is a condition, not a program, and we can't make a program out of being Black" (Cleage, 1972/1987b, pp. 7-8). Thus, a few firmly committed to a common vision have more of a chance for success than a large number of persons with nearly as many ideologies. The</page><page sequence="56">Walker / Marcus Garvey and Albert B. Cleage Jr. 249 sum total of Cleage's reasoning aligned his ecclesiological position more closely with that of McGuire's, for both saw the church as central to the liberation struggle. Still, Cleage's church as movement honors two of the reasons why Garvey sought to keep the UNIA from birthing an organization church. Garvey kept from endorsing any one church in order to keep the doors of the movement and its activities open to all faith members of the Black community. But a major part of Cleage's program emphasized working with and supporting organizations and programs from all faiths that are working toward the liberation of Black people. Also, Garvey sought to make the UNIA the all-encompassing movement by keeping the doors of the organization open to all. Cleage sought to make the PAOCC the all-encompassing movement by working with and providing direction to others. All need not join. But the PAOCC worked with and gave guidance by example to others interested in the same work. To this end, Jaramogi Menelik Kimathi has presently synthesized the positions of Garvey and Cleage in promoting the PAOCC as a "global ecclesiastical corporation": a church capable of meeting the mountain of unmet need in the Pan- African world by its ability to accumulate communal wealth and invest it in serving community interests (skills training, health care, equality, empowerment, etc.). Such a church would encourage members to adhere to a common belief system that preaches a message universally understood by focusing on the core values held in common by most of the world's faith systems. Conclusion Both Garvey and Cleage sought to do the same thing: make Jesus, the Bible, and Christianity relevant to the Black struggle for self-determination. Garvey chose the path of creating a Black civil religion: an all-encompassing organization that produced all necessary survival institutions. Cleage chose to work within the Black church as center of the movement: an all-encompassing Black nation that produces all necessary survival institu- tions. Cleage's reasoning was that only the church could provide the inti- mate setting, sacraments, rituals, and group experience needed to work on the main problem all other Black organizations failed to deal with: the psychological sickness inherited by and conditioned into Black people. Cleage saw the church as the only mediator of God's power, providing the processes necessary for transformation. Thus, there can be no successful struggle without the church.</page><page sequence="57">250 Journal of Black Studies Garvey thought that Blacks could redeem Africa with God's help. In fact, he saw Africa's redemption as part of God's cosmic plan. He saw this redemption coming by people rationally committing to the principles of the UNIA. Cleage did not believe that success was guaranteed but rather that it was contingent on the decisions Blacks made to take seriously the process of transformation. Cleage believed that Blacks could do what Jesus did and even greater things if they took those processes seriously. Thus, the church fellowship and processes were crucial. For with them could come transfor- mation and an opening to God-power. Garvey saw the power of God working with Black people but did not express a belief that such power was either available to individuals or even that it was crucial to the success of the UNIA goals. He saw rational power, work, and solutions to problems being answer enough. Cleage, however, saw rational programs as futile without Black people being opened to the God-power that lies within them, only waiting to be discovered. References Burkett, R. (1978).
