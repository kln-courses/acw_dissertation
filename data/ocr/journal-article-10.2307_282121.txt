<plain_text><page sequence="1">REVIEWS number of houses, possible floors, and exterior zones excavated. The book is divided into 16 chapters. Tringham and Krstic set the methodological and chronological back- ground for the excavation followed by a report on field techniques, stratigraphy, and distribution of the locat- ed houses or post-mold configurations. Material-cul- ture studies include a detailed technological study of ceramics (Kaiser), typological analysis of pottery (Vuk- manovic and Radojcic), nonceramic uses of clays (e.g., loom weights, counters, lamps) by Tringham and Ste- vanovic, lithics (Voytek), and bone tools (Russell). The weakest analysis is of figurines by Milojkovic, where too much is made of using them as chronological in- dicators, and too little quantitative analysis is con- ducted with such a large sample (over 300). Ecological exploitation studies include mammalian faunal anal- ysis, where Legge convincingly demonstrates shifts in wild and domestic species; fish (Brinkhuizen); archaeo- botanical analysis (McLaren and Hubbard); and some of the earliest evidence in eastern Europe for metal- lurgical slag (copper) on an archaeological site (Glumac and Tringham). John Chapman presents a regional analysis of Se- levac in relation to what is known about the Neolithic Morava-Danubian confluence area. His chapter pre- sents a lucid introduction to the geology and hydrology of the region, and sets Selevac geographic placement relative to resources and land-use strategies. Tringham and Krstic conclude with a excellent chapter placing the site within the larger context of prehistory and so- cial change. One minor criticism is the formatting of the text into two columns per page with an inordinate amount of white space per page. Although it is an oversized book, the columnar approach does not make for easy reading, and sometimes figures of site architecture are too small for understanding. However, most figures, maps, and tables are clearly executed. Some of the photographs of ceramics are not clear. The Selevac report will greatly aid European pre- historians to understand the chronology and the social processes that led to more expansive farming com- munities. In total, the authors present convincing ar- guments for internally manifested social intensification during the Late Neolithic of this area. Vision and Revision in Maya Studies. FLORA S. CLANCY and PETER D. HARRISON, editors. University of New Mexico Press, Albuquerque, 1991. x + 224 pp., figures, maps, notes, index, bibliogra- phy. $40.00 (cloth). Reviewed by Aleksandar Boskovic, Tulane University. The question of revisionism in archaeology is con- nected with the ever-present need to expand our un- derstanding-especially concerning prehistoric cul- tures. It is sometimes associated with the postmodern approach in philosophy and history (as the editors of this volume note in the Introduction [p. xii]), but can also be related to the postprocessual methodology. In the context of Maya studies, this would mean trying to let the ancient (and modern, where possible) Maya speak for themselves, and trying to limit the work of interpretation as much as possible, eventually shifting to the hermeneutical approach. Vision and Revision in Maya Studies consists of 12 papers presented at a conference at the University of New Mexico in Albuquerque in January 1987, plus the editors' theoretical Introduction. According to the ed- itors, "The title Vision &amp; Revision in Maya Studies is meant to prepare the reader for what is to follow by reflecting this present state of Maya Studies" (p. vii). And indeed, some of the contributions are very much revisionistic, aiming at completely new models that emerge from more recent ceramic analysis (E. Wyllys Andrews V: "The Early Ceramic History of the Low- land Maya"), or models of explaining ancient Maya subsistence patterns (Peter D. Harrison: "The Revo- lution in Ancient Maya Susbsistence"). Some contri- butions deal with problems that were neglected in pre- vious studies, or present them in a completely different way (Flora S. Clancy: "A Geneology for Freestanding Maya Monuments"; Richard M. Leventhal: "Southern Belize: An Ancient Maya Region"), while other authors tend to give us state-of-the-art contributions that sum- marize working models present in this area of research in the last decade (paper on Lowland Maya wetland agriculture at Rio Azul by T. Patrick Culbert, Laura J. Levi, and Luis Cruz; paper on early architectural his- tory of Mundo Perdido, Tikal, and its dynastic con- sequences by Juan Pedro Laporte and Vilma Fialko; Anthony P. Andrews's "The Role of Trading Ports in Maya Civilization"). Among the most interesting con- tributions are the one dealing with transition from Classic to Postclassic in Northern Belize (David M. Pendergast), as well as the brilliant ethnographic essay by Grant D. Jones on the sources that help us to better understand Maya colonial history. In some sense, the structure of the book and the quality of the individual contributions justify the re- gional approach in mesoamerican studies. This ap- proach has also been employed in a recent publication on the Olmec culture and its contemporaries (Sharer and Grove [editors], Regional Perspectives on the 0l- mec, 1989) with great success. In the present volume its importance is not explicitly stressed (except, maybe, by Richard Leventhal [cf. pp. 125-126]), but all the authors start from the relatively limited (in both time and space) set of data from a certain area and/or site, and try to expand these data further. Sometimes, data lead to questions that remain open (e.g., what was the relationship between Seibal and Tikal?-as implied by Clemency C. Coggins). It can be argued that the starting points for the study are not always the best points from which to expand; e.g., Linda Schele presents (as usual) a brilliant study of dedication ceremonies and house names at Palenque-but what is the broader value of this study if we know that Palenque is (geographically, politically, and especially epigraphically) an exception in the Lowland Maya area? If so many exceptions in ancient Maya writing are encountered only at Pal- enque, is it valid to try to interpret the writings from other sites (which have little or no irregularity!) using the information based on the examples from Palenque? Another interesting thing to be noted is the inter- disciplinary approach, since the authors come from different fields: archaeology, art history, epigraphy, and 591</page><page sequence="2">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY ethnohistory. Within this interdisciplinary approach, there is a great emphasis on the iconography (papers by Laporte and Fialko, Freidel, Coggins, Schele), and at least in one case (Freidel) it is demonstrated in great detail how the ancient Maya symbols (in this case, the Jester god) changed and transformed over the time, with different cultural implications for the social or- ganization from Preclassic into Postclassic. While the image might stay the same, its context and meaning significantly shift over the longer periods of time. Preparing publications based on conferences is very often connected with the risk that some or most of the contributions will be out-of-date by the date that the book becomes available to the general public (in this case, more than four years have passed since the con- ference, and two years since the book was actually fin- ished in April of 1991!). However, the editors, con- tributors, and the publisher did a great job by updating some contributions in the process, so that as a final product we have a nicely printed (with a lot of draw- ings, architectural reconstructions, and site plans) and very useful summary of the work in the last decade, but also a book that can pose questions for future re- search. Vision and Revision is certainly open to criti- cism and revision(s), but right now, it is without any doubt the best book on Maya studies. The New World Figurine Project, Vol. 1. TERRY STOCKER, editor. Research Press, Provo, Utah, 1991. vi + 165 pp., figures, tables, references. $23.00 (cloth) Reviewed by James A. Chiarelli, Brandeis University, and The Center for Field Research, Watertown, Mas- sachusetts. In the editorial introduction to this volume, Terry Stocker takes note of the fact that figurines, when men- tioned in archaeological site reports, are often classified as a "minor artifact category." Anthropomorphic, zo- omorphic, and other kinds of figurines are known from many archaeological contexts throughout the world, but it would be safe to say that the attention such materials receive from scholars is disproportionately small when measured against their ubiquity in the archaeological record. Figurines constitute a potentially significant ar- chaeological data base that is at once enticing in its size and variability and forbidding in light of the per- ceived limitations of currently available interpretive frameworks. This first volume of a projected multi- volume series presents 13 papers by authors who, for the most part, approach the study of figurines from New World sites in fairly traditional ways and in most- ly descriptive terms. Stocker, again in the introduction, states that "the primary goal of the New World Fig- urine Project is description," and descriptions are pri- marily what the contributors have delivered. Three of the 13 articles focus on methodological or theoretical issues. There is one article on preceramic figurines from Aspero, Peru, and one on Mississippian figurines. Two concern figurines from the northwestern United States, two are on Valdivia figurines, and the remaining four present figurine data from mesoamer- ican sites. Since it is impossible to summarize every article in this collection, I will mention five that stand out due to the authors' attempts to move beyond description and toward some interpretive or processual explana- tion of their materials. David Grove's and Susan Gil- lespie's 1987 article (reprinted from Archaeology) con- cludes that many of the more than 4,000 figurine fragments recovered at the central Mexican site of Chalcatzingo represent portraits of deified Middle For- mative rulers. Joanne Mack concludes that the geo- graphical and cultural distribution of realistically ren- dered Late Archaic zoomorphic figurines from the western Cascades is indicative of complex trade net- works among upland groups as early as A.D. 1000. William Fowler examines figurines from the site of Cihuatan, El Salvador, and evidence of a Postclassic incursion by Pipil immigrants from Mexico. Kevin Smith considers the potential roles of figurine analysis and ethnographic analogy in determining the nature of Mississippian social organization, mortuary practices, and religious-symbolic behavior. Lastly, Terry Stocker closes the volume with an unabashedly diffusionist ap- preciation of certain aspects of New World prehistory including the now-legendary Valdivia-Jomon problem and the possibility that "Olmec sailors" mounted trad- ing expeditions among the peoples of the American southeast. This article will undoubtedly draw fire from his colleagues. The New World Figurine Project is a handsomely produced, large-format volume with ample and infor- mative illustrations. Several typographical errors and what appears to be an inconsistent editorial hand give the book as a whole a somewhat uneven quality. Nev- ertheless, it is a welcome contribution to New World archaeology, and we should look forward to future vol- umes. Mechanics of Pre-industrial Technology. BRIAN COT- TERELL and JOHAN KAMMINGA. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 1990. xv + 325 pp., figures, tables, appendixes, references, index. $49.50 (cloth). Reviewed by Phillip de Barros, Stanton, California. This is the first general review of the mechanics of preindustrial technology and represents the joint efforts of an engineer (Brian Cotterell) and an archaeologist (Johan Kamminga). The book's purpose is to present the basic principles of mechanics and show how they help us understand the artifacts and technological pro- cesses of ancient and traditional cultures. The authors see several benefits to providing a mechanical per- spective to the discipline of archaeology. First, by fo- cusing on the mechanical processes of artifacts, ar- chaeologists can better understand which attributes are functional (especially in mechanical terms) and which are stylistic. Such a mechanical base should lead to better typologies of material culture, which have often been based on a mixture of functional and stylistic attributes (e.g., projectile-point typologies). The authors also see mechanical data as useful for reconstructing culture histories, measuring material development, understanding human adaptation to the environment, and for developing theories of culture 592 [Vol. 58, No. 3, 1993]</page></plain_text>
