<plain_text><page sequence="1">Early Greek Elegists. By C. M. BOWRA. Pages 208. Harvard Un,iversity Press, Cambridge I938 Martin Classical Lectures, Volume VII) $2.50 This well written and well constructed book should be read by classical teachers and by all who are inter- ested in poetry, ancient and modern. The translations of the Greek illustrative passages are excellent and in many cases have the virtue of bringing Greek poetry close to our poetry. For such a criterion of good trans- lation, see a discussion of types of translators in The Oxford Book of Greek Verse in Translation, Intro- duction II, xxxvi. The contents of the book under review are treated in the following chapters: I. Origins and Beginnings; II. Tyrtaeus; III. Solon; IV. Xenophanes; V. Theognis; VI. Simonides and the Sepulchral Epigrams. After a brief discussion of the origin of the Greek elegiac couplet as a flute-song, and of its pecuiliar adaptation to the expression of the individual poet's thoughts or feelings on every kind of subject, not neces- sarily confined to grief or lamentation, the elegiac fragments of Archilochus are taken up. To this warrior- poet, and not to Callinus or Tyrtaeus, the author would assign the invention of the earliest elegiacs, if not the earliest. in time, at least their artistic perfection and adaptation to different uses. Though on one occasion the poet ran away and left his shield behind, he was no coward. Implacable toward his enemies, he had a gentle side, as appears in Fr. 7, where he expresses sympathy for a friend grieving at the loss of friends drowned at sea, and urges manly endurance of the in- evitable. The author's comments on the use of Homeric words and phrases by the early elegists, especially those Ionian born, are most helpful, and accentuate the gen- eral relationship of the poets under consideration (See Hudson-Williams, Early Greek Elegy, 71-105). The stirring verses of Callinus, calling the luxurious Colophonians to take arms against the threatening hordes of Cimmerians, were the models of the battle- songs of Tyrtaeus who is fully treated in chapter two. The exquisite melody of the elegies of Mimnermus, where, as in Sappho, word and thought are perfectlv blended, appears in the famous lines (Fr. i, Diehl) on the joys of love and youth in contrast to the futility and gloom of old age. The author's comments (I9-24) on Fr. 2, depicting in melancholy strain the transitoriness of human life, are good examples of scholarly interpretation. The writer argues (40-41) that Tyrtaeus was a native of Sparta and not, in accordance with tradition, an Athenian loaned by Athens to help the Spartans in their discouragement and extremity during the Second Messenian War. There is a strong probability that the former view is the true one, but it cannot be certainly proved. The definition of the ideal good man 4v3p ayaos, whose special virtue, or JpET{, is to fight and die for his country, is first expressed by Tyrtaeus, especially in Fr. 9, 1-20. Such a true patriot has his reward: he is remembered and honored by his own city-state and he has a sort of immortality in that he will live in the memory of others. The teachings of Solon, the wise Athenian law-giver, and in fact his own life throughout, represent the good man of a higher type than the brave warrior. His life was spent in trying to benefit his fellow-citizens and in giving justice to the poor who were being oppressed by the rich nobles. The reviewer would call attention to the author's excellent commentary (90-98) on Solon's famous philo- sophical poem, opening with a praycr to the Muses, Fr. I, I-36. For an extended commentary on tlis poem, see Ivan M. Linforth, Solon The Athenian, University of California Press, Berkeley i9I9, i64-I69, 227, 243 and 1o5ff. Solon, the apostle of tolerance and of moderation, is the first poet of Athens, and as has .been suggested, the first Greek whom we can feel that we personally know, and even regard with affection. The Eleatic philosopher, Xenophanes of Colophon,</page><page sequence="2">94 CLASSICAL WEEKLY was a man of marked originality and independence of thought, a skeptic and a reformer far ahead of his time. He attacked the anthropomorphic theology of Homer and Hesiod, the glorification of athletes, espe- cially Olympic victors and the mythical stories sung at drinking parties as impious and tending to promote strife. His revolutionary views are of immense import- ance in the history of human thought. The poet's high seriousness is apparent. As master of the feast he pleads for purity of word and thought as well as of body in the approach to the gods, and for the power to do the right thing in the affairs of life. Bowra's interpretation of Fr. I is greatly extended in C.Ph. October, I938, Vol. XXXIII, 353-367 (See pages I2I-127)- Again in Fr. 2, especially lines II-14, the poet- philosopher, conscious of his own worth and high motives, feels that by his gift of song he is of more benefit to his fellow-citizens than is the victorious athlete, and is therefore more deserving of honor. Xenophanes passed most of his long life in exile. He was a pessimist and seemed to be 'agin' most of the men and institutions of his day. He was a sixth cen- tury G. B. S. of a sort. As a specimen of his caustic wit may be quoted (1I4) his veiled attack on Pytha- goras' doctrine of metempsychosis, Fr. 6, 2-5, thus translated by Sir William Marris: Once he was passing by an ill-used pup, And pitied it and said (or so they tell) "Stop, do not thrash it! 'tis a dear friend's soul: I recognized it when I heard it yell." The Theognidea is an anthology of nearly I400 lines by different authors and based on the elegiac verses of Theognis, written in the second half of the sixth cen- tury.1 The poet was an aristocrat of Dorian Megara, who was exiled and lost his lands in the civil strife be- tween the aristocrats, the good and the populace, the bad or base born. The key or seal of the genuine work of Theognis is the name Cyrnus, and where this name occurs we have 282 genuine verses. The poet instructs his young squire Cyrnus in manners and in worldly wisdom, but in particular he advises him how to con- duct himself-to do the right thing in accordance with the traditions of his own class. In the view of Theognis the virtue of the good man is neither military prowess nor the courage to fight and die for his fellow-citizens. The supreme virtue was to stand by the traditional order of things, the rule of the oligarchy, which was being menaced by the rise of democracy, to reverence the gods in the traditional way, to be loyal to one's friends, and to preserve in thought and conduct the Mean. This doctrine of the Mean is advocated in lines 335-336 and discussed on pages I 53-I55. "Seek not too much. The Mean is best. And then Shall you have virtue, hard to find for men." And on page I64 the author quotes the fine poem, lines 237-254, in which Theognis predicts Cyrnus' im- mortality through his song. It is a splendid handling of the elegiac couplet. We have seen that the elegy was used to define the nature of the good man. It was also the best vehicle by which to commemorate the virtue of the deceased, whether it was sung at a feast or engraved on a tomb. In the hands of the lyric poet, Simonides of Ceos, the sepulchral epigram was a work of art, concise and clear-cut and, with all its simplicity, polished like a Greek gem. It has given a kind of immortality, in the shadowy Greek sense, to the persons commemorated. The author gives tests by which the genuine, and probably genuine, work of Simonides can be judged (I86-I93). Perhaps Simonides' two most famous epi- taphs are those in honor of the Spartans who fell at Thermopylae (Fr. 92) and of the Athenians who died in the Persian Wars (Fr. II8). The former is a tribute of praise to Sparta; the latter to men who gave up their lives for the freedom of all Hellas. The author shows skill and judgment in giving in brief the historical background of these early elegists, thus furnishing a setting for his analysis of their poetry. The social and civic disturbances described by Solon and Theognis cannot be without interest for our own times. The reviewer hopes that his own pleasure in reading this book may be shared by many others. It is a dis- tinct contribution to the appreciation of an important branch of Greek poetry. HENRY S.
