<plain_text><page sequence="1">REVIEWS A POET-PHILOSOPHER The Bare Hills, by Yvor Winters. Four Seas Co. Probably the last thing Yvor Winters would care to have me call him is a mystic. If I were to do so, it would be not at all according to the interpretation he himself puts upon mysticism, but in the meaning that he expresses himself only to a higher grade of intelligence or to the especially initiated. Something of the mystic in this meaning is in his work-the feeling below the feeling which persists in many of his poems. [4I]</page><page sequence="2">POETRY: I Magazine of Verse Not for this author is death a lovely adventure. He is full of the horror of death and the pain of history, as indeed anyone must be who thinks sincerely. Yet he transforms the ugly face of truth to a macaberesque beauty which is appealing in its very starkness. I should like to quote more than I may of the lines in The Bare Hills, his latest book-such as this music from The Im palpable Void: And his vision Drifts from the place Where the lawn was, Where dew was the sea. Having the breadth of vision which comes from his not being a one-language man (his translations from the French and the Spanish and other tongues are distin guished), Mr. Winters is able to measure and coordinate racial literatures and to acquire a subtle apprehending of values. He has been misunderstood and passed over as an imagist-as a poet without a discernible philosophy. But he has a very distinct philosophy, which is primarily intuitive, arrived at through direct experience and feeling, only secondarily through logic. Imagist or not, he pictures characters, whether of men or of animals, faultlessly. Here is a small animal, irrepressible life in youth-he calls the poem April: The little goat crops new grass lying down leaps up eight inches into air and [42]</page><page sequence="3">A Poet-philosopher lands on four feet. Not a tremor solid in the spring and serious he walks away. And here is Mr. Winters' philosophy-for his poetry and hiis philosophy cannot be reviewed apart. He postulates a Deity, the Universe: matter, but not matter as diverse from mind, which are one and the same-Limitation, the converse of Space or Nothingness. This Deity is alive, incessantly alive. Physicists define his movements in terms of forces-a metaphor, but a fairly good one. These different forces, by blocking each other in various ways, produce certain whirlpools which maintain themselves for periods of time. (Time is nothing but a function of any such whirlpool or organism, including the Deity himself, whereas Eternity is a function of Infinity, or nothingness.) A poem from Transition (not in this book) presents this phase of the matter: Through the long winter nights when every beast turns steaming in his sleep I lie alone an eddy fixed, alive with change that is not I: slow torture this to lie and hold to mind against the stream with nought to seize on: the bed trembles to my blood, I break [43]</page><page sequence="4">POETRY: a Magazine of Verse the night, I break the soundless flow, I cry and turn and the cold gathers round my hands and thickened brain: a girl lay naked in my bed with cold small arms and wept. The humming tongue burrows the nightwind of the nightingale that comes no more. Mind, in this poem, is simply the form of the eddy, and will vanish with the cessation of that particular motion, with the death of the body, when the motion (more im portant than the mere physical content of the motion, which is continually coming and going) will be reabsorbed. According to Mr. Winters, then, the mind is a relationship, not a thing. And in this it is like a work of art. Now this leaves man in a double position: the mystical relationship with God, in which he visualizes himself as non-man, but which is realized perfectly only in death; and the moral situation as man, as something created by and contained in God, but nevertheless distinct from God, and unable to attain God. It is this realization of oneself as man and non-God that drives one to the madness of hysterical mysticism or the discipline of art. Art functions for Mr. Winters as a moral discipline. For him the only godhead left for man is the evaluation and renunciation of life, through the practice of art and philosophy. This state of renunciation marks the end of the second section of his [44]</page><page sequence="5">a Poet-philosopher book, in the poem called Man Regards Eternity in Aging: Now rotting Time again leaves bare the god. The other phases of this attitude are most evident prob ably in the following poems: Nocturne, which presents life in a state of trance, the mystical relation; ,Quod Tegit Omnia, the state of becoming, of acquiring life, beginning with nothing: The poet mounts into the spring, upon his tongue the taste of air becoming body: is embedded in this crystalline precipitate of Time. Mazda Wake, the state of one who is suddenly stripped of emotional surroundings, and is brought face to face with the naked and "inanimate" god: Hard chair and table skeleton of feelings carved away by glassy light condensed in grief the old man walks beside the bed or lifts the flame-pure sheet to see this woman: jagged grip on Space deposited by life a thought made visible in wrinkle upon wrinkle not to be forgotten but now done and gritty gathered at his feet. [45]</page><page sequence="6">POETRY: a Magazine of Verse The same state may be attained (it is the next thing to madness, and a state to avoid) through metaphysical con centration. In The Streets, the first third deals with the departure from the anthropomorphic deity of the gospels and the Jews; the second third, with the approach to the mystical unity with deity; the third, with the abandonment of the attempt, and the refusal to attempt to placate or join a deity of a moral level lower than human. I think Hart Crane must have had in mind this bit from The Streets when he accused Yvor Winters of being "witty about God" and "Laforguian in the street-car line." In inten tion, at least, nothing was ever more desperately serious: I met God in the street-car, but I could not pray to him, and we were both embarrassed. I have said that this author's poetry could not be re viewed apart from his philosophy. I might qualify this. There are poems of great charm in this volume which need no philosophical explaining. Many who read them will enjoy beauty without of necessity analyzing it. Mr. Winters has the art to set aside the unnecessary word, the art to cut emotion into sharp intaglii. Strong winds blow through The Bare Hills, a book inspiring in its absolute originality. To some readers it will signify mere austerity. Others will find tenderness, as they find it in the gigantic conflict of the first movement of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony, or in the fateful tones of Brahms' Tragic [46]</page><page sequence="7">a Poet-philosopher Overture. Important and remarkable, it may be better understood in France than in America, for Frenchmen are not afraid of the dark. Yvor Winters cannot complain if, after some of the sophisticated cadences of today have died out, Time, the flow of which is almost a physical sensation of pain to him, but Time in the only conception the average person has of it, brings these sculptured poems to a place in what men call the future.
