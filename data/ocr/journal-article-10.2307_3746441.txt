<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE DUALISM OF MIND AND MATTER PROFESSOR JOHN MACMURRAY ONE of the most deeply engrained habits of the modern world is the habit of thinking in terms of a contrast, and indeed of an opposition, between something we call Mind and something we call Matter. This habit is obviously not confined to philosophy. It is built into the structure of our languages and of our ways of behaviour. It conditions our religious and moral attitudes, as well as our reflective thought in science and philosophy. It is not surprising, therefore, that much of modern European Philosophy has consisted in an effort to overcome the dualism to which this habit gives rise when we try to clarify and systematize our know- ledge of Reality. This essay on the subject is an essay in scepticism. It will tend to the conclusion that the dualistic habit of thought is a bad habit; that it is, in fact, the formulation of an illusion. It does not attempt to prove this. It only asks a question, and seeks to examine such answers as seem likely to be given. The question is this: "What rational justification is there for accepting the dualism of Mind and Matter as a metaphysical hypothesis which deserves consideration?" If the habit of contrasting Mind and Matter is a bad habit, it will, of course, require a psychological explanation, and the attempt to explain it will be a study in the pathology of the modern consciousness. But it will have no reason, and if the attempt to discover a reason for it proves fruitless, that will in itself strongly suggest that the subject is one for psychological rather than for logical investigation. When a philosophical position commands wide acceptance and universal attention, and yet cannot be shown to have any rational justification, it is almost certain that it has a deep-seated source of an irrational kind. There can be no reason for believing an illusion, but there must be a reason why it is actually believed. Of the philosophical works which have been published in recent years none has impressed me more than Professor Lovejoy's book called The Revolt Against Dualism. It is an elaborate and systematic examination of the dualistic motif in modern philosophy from Descartes to the present time. Whatever may be thought of the particular analysis which Professor Lovejoy gives, he at least succeeds in revealing that the problem of dualism lies at the basis of all modern philosophy, and that all modern philosophies are efforts to overcome the dualism. Professor Lovejoy's conclusion 264</page><page sequence="2">THE DUALISM OF MIND AND MATTER is that none of these attempts (though some of the more recent ones, which rest upon the Theory of Relativity, are very subtle) have succeeded in escaping the dualism, and that, therefore, we must give up the revolt and accept dualism as inevitable. I mention this conclusion not in order to discuss its validity but in order to make quite clear the question which I am asking. It is not Professor Lovejoy's question, though it is very difficult to avoid confusing the two. I am willing to grant that all modern philosophy is dualistic and that all the attempts to overcome this dualism have failed. But I should give a very different account of the reasons for the failure. I should maintain that any philosophy which starts by con- trasting Mind and Matter must necessarily fail to resolve the dualism which its starting-point involves. I ask, therefore, why any philo- sophy should start from this contrast. Is there any real necessity for thinking in teims of a dualism between Mind and Matter? It may seem strange at first sight to say that the dualism of Mind and Matter is characteristic of all modern philosophy. With the qualified exception of the philosophy of Descartes, all the outstanding philosophical systems of modern times have been either monistic or pluralistic. Berkeley's philosophy, with its thorough- going denial of matter, is certainly not dualistic. It holds that the only reality is mind and its activities, so that everything is mental. But I had no intention to deny that most modern philosophical systems are monistic in their conclusion as well as in their intention. What I wished to assert was that these monisms are all in terms of the dualism of Mind and Matter. They start from the hypothesis of a prima facie contrast between the mental and the material, and reach their conclusion by unifying, in some way or other, the two sides of the dualism which they take as prima facie given. These philosophies could never arise except on the basis of dualism. The dualism forms the primary hypothesis which they set out to examine. They discover, by critical analysis, that this dualism raises insuperable difficulties which force them to attempt its resolution. The final denial of dualism is still the result of thinking in terms of dualism. Berkeley's philosophy, for example, is obviously founded, in this sense, on the dualism of Mind and Matter. Without that distinction it could never get started. Berkeley begins by examining the idea of a two-substance world and goes on to show that all the things which we usually put in the basket labelled "Material Substance" should really be put in the basket labelled "Mental Substance." In the structure of his thought there are still two classes, mental and material. But one of the classes turns out to be a null class. All the actual things in the world go into the mental class. When Berkeley says that everything is idea, the meaning of his statement depends upon the contrast that we draw 265</page><page sequence="3">PHILOSOPHY between ideas, which are mental, and things, which are material. If Berkeley and his readers were not equally thinking in terms of a significant distinction between mind and matter, Berkeley's conclusion would itself carry no meaning at all. Thus apart from the dualistic habit of thought Berkeley's philosophy would never have come into existence, and could not be understood if it had. The same is true of all the classical modern philosophies. Even in their rejection of dualism they depend upon dualistic thinking. My question is this: "Is there any rational justification for thinking dualistically?" Our question, then, is not whether Reality is ultimately dualistic, but whether there is a prima facie case for suggesting that it may be; whether, that is to say, our common knowledge of the world suggests that a systematic attempt to understand it might naturally start by distinguishing two classes of things which seem at first sight to have nothing in common. Further investigation might then either confirm the dualism and so reach a dualistic conclusion or it might discover a way of resolving the dualism. But neither of these types of conclusion would arise unless there was a prima facie case for starting with a dualistic classification. Now a dualism, in the philosophical sense, is a metaphysical classification, a schema for dividing everything without exception into two sorts of things that have nothing in common, and which, therefore, exclude one another in their essential nature. If we consider that Reality may possibly be dualistic, we are considering the possibility that every- thing in Reality is either of one kind or of another, and that these two kinds have nothing in common and must be defined as mutually exclusive. If, for example, the dualism we are considering is the Mind-Matter dualism, then we are considering the possibility that everything in the Universe is either mental or material, and that nothing is both. We are considering that whatever is mental has none of the characteristics that belong to material things, and that nothing that is material possesses any of the characteristics that belong to mental things. A metaphysical dualism is, thus, both ultimate and absolute. The history of modern philosophy shows that there is a deeply- rooted tendency in our minds to classify the constituents of Reality in this way. It also shows that such a dualistic classification raises great difficulties for the philosopher. It may be, of course, that no philosopher has yet hit upon the way to surmount those diffi- culties, and that we ought to go on making the attempt in the hope that we may finally be successful. But it may also be that the difficulties are of our own making, and that they really arise from the fact that the dualistic classification is merely an irrational tendency which we should attempt to overcome. It is between 266</page><page sequence="4">THE DUALISM OF MIND AND MATTER these two possibilities that we have to make our choice. That is why it is necessary to ask what are the prima facie grounds for starting out with the hypothesis that Reality divides without remainder into what is mental and what is material. Let us first appeal directly to common sense, that is to say, to our ordinary unphilosophical outlook upon the world. The question that we shall then ask ourselves is: "What kinds of things are there in the world as we know it which seem to be fundamentally dif- ferent?" And the answer to that question would provide us with a natural prima facie classification of Reality. We shall begin (shall we not?) by distinguishing animate from inanimate things. This difference between things that are alive and things that are not alive is prima facie the obvious one. Whether it is ultimate or not is a different question, but not one with which we are now con- cerned. We shall then distinguish human beings, like ourselves, from both these classes. The main difficulty that we are likely to find will be in deciding whether to distinguish plant life from animal life. But on the whole we shall decide that this is really a sub- division of the class of animate but non-human things. It might be possible to argue for a different natural classification, but hardly without sophistication. The division of the contents of the world into inorganic, organic, and personal seems at least to be a universal one and to correspond to what we can discover about the develop- ment of the human being in childhood. One thing is quite certain. We should never dream of dividing the things that we know into material things and mental things. It requires, at least, a high degree of sophisticated reflection to arrive at that classification. It is obviously not a natural classification of the contents of the world in comparison with the division into inanimate, animate, and rational or personal. This brings to light the first prima facie difficulty of the Mind-Matter dualism. It is difficult to find in it any place for living things that have no minds. If the world consists exclusively of mental things and material things, where do cabbages come in? There is one quite simple consideration that reinforces this natural threefold classification against the dualism of Mind and Matter. Suppose that in spite of its unnaturalness, there is some deeper reason for classifying real things as either material or mental. We should expect that the systematic effort to investigate the nature of the world would result in the development of two separate lines of inquiry. We should expect to find the results of the inves- tigation grouping themselves into two sciences or two groups of sciences, one having material things as its field of research and the other mental things. We should expect to find a set of physical sciences concerned with the investigation of matter and a set of 267</page><page sequence="5">PHILOSOPHY psychological sciences concerned with the investigation of mind. Actually this was the expectation entertained by philosophers and scientists at the beginning of the scientific period under the influence of the dualistic habit of thought. Persistent efforts were made to develop two sciences concerned respectively with Mind and Matter. But the attempt has proved unavailing. The necessities of scientific development have forced another classification upon us, in spite of our prejudice in favour of dualism. We find ourselves with a set of physical sciences which are concerned with material phenomena. We find a set of sciences dealing with the phenomena of life, quite distinct from the physical sciences, but not concerned with mind at all. Finally, we find a special set of sciences, still rather unsure of themselves, which are concerned with psychological phenomena. In other words, the development of science reflects the natural threefold classification of reality and not the dualistic one, in spite of the fact that the dualistic tendency has exercised a continuous pressure upon the development of scientific investigation. At first sight we might be inclined to draw the conclusion that the dualism of Mind and Matter was not exhaustive, and that what is required is the introduction of a third division into the classi- fication. Instead of the twofold division into Matter and Mind, we might adopt a threefold division into Mind, Life, and Matter. Then we should look upon physical science as the science of Matter. Biological science as the science of Life, and Psychological science as the science of Mind. To do this would be to miss the point. Biology is not the science of Life, and Psychology is not the science of Mind in the sense that Physics is the science of Matter. Biology does not study Life in distinction from Matter. It studies the behaviour of living things, and living things are certainly material objects in some sense. Indeed, many biologists are of the opinion (wrongly, I believe), that as time goes on the biological sciences will become a special branch of physical science. As for Psychology, it is a commonplace of its history that it failed completely to develop so long as it was conceived as a science of Mind and that it has only achieved its recent qualified successes by deliberately aban- doning this attempt and becoming a science of the behaviour of conscious beings and in particular of human beings. The importance of this lies in the fact that whatever a human being in the psycho- logical sense may be, he is certainly not a mental constituent of Reality. In some sense he is just as much a material object as a brick or a penny whistle. Thus the appeal to common sense draws blank. The natural outlook upon the world provides us with no prima facie ground for classifying the constituents of reality into mental and material. Indeed, it suggests a different classification which is incompatible with the dualism. 268</page><page sequence="6">THE DUALISM OF MIND AND MATTER I imagine that anyone who is at all familiar with modern philosophy might be inclined to retort that everyone knows that the grounds for the Mind-Matter dualism arise in another field altogether, and that I have been deliberately wasting time. Before turning to con- sider the field in which the ground for the dualism is supposed to lie, I should like to justify my appeal to common sense. If the dualism of Mind and Matter is to have a real prima facie basis, the field which we have been considering is the field in which it ought to arise. If it does not arise naturally from the straightforward attempt to classify the kinds of things-the specifically different natures-to be found in the world, then that is in itself evidence that there is something wrong with it. For any metaphysical dualism offers itself as a classification, exhaustive and ultimate of the con- stituents of Reality. If experience shows that it is not possible to organize the detailed investigation of Reality on the basis of this classification, that is strong empirical evidence that the classification is a bad one. Philosophy, like any other systematic inquiry, must start with a classification; and since there is no other way of making a preliminary classification than by an appeal to the obvious and noticeable distinctions in the field of study, philosophy ought to start from the natural classification which common sense provides, especially when that classification is reinforced by the grouping of the sciences which are concerned with the investigation of special parts of the same general field. Indeed, the field to which we must now turn and in which the supposed grounds for the dualism are to be found, is itself the product of the dualistic tendency and presupposes it. The centre of this field is determined by the perfectly natural and legitimate question, "What am I?" For some reason or other, traditional philosophy does not like to ask this question in its natural form. It prefers to ask, "What is the Self?" This is not, in fact, the same question. It is quite possibly a meaningless question. It is quite certain that I exist, that there is me. It is equally certain I submit, that there is you. But is there such a thing at all as the Self? If there is, it must be something which is as much me as it is you, and therefore, I should have thought, it can be neither you nor me. So I prefer to stick to the natural question, "What am I?" Of course it is mainly in connexion with the Theory of Knowledge that the suggestion of the dualism of Mind and Matter has arisen. But that question is really only a part of the wider question, "What am I?" and it is worth our while to consider the wider question first before coming to that aspect of it which is concerned with our knowledge. Perhaps we can agree in general that the idea of dualism only arises when we consider our own nature. When we contrast Mind and Matter, we are primarily thinking about certain 269</page><page sequence="7">PHILOSOPHY characteristics which belong to ourselves and to beings like our- selves, and which we are inclined to deny to other things in the world, even to animals. Thus it is only in reference to persons that the dualism arises at all, and persons form a relatively small class of objects in the world as we know it. That in itself suggests that the dualism is not really a metaphysical one but rather a personal one. It is a distinction within one of the natural classes into which common sense divides the constituents of Reality. But let us put this aside, and ask ourselves what it is about persons that suggests a dualism of Mind and Matter? In the first place, they are material objects, at least they have all the characteristics which we usually associate with material objects. They have size and shape and weight and so forth. Incidentally, we should notice that they have all the characteristics of animate things as well. They grow and they reproduce their species. Even within the special class of persons our natural threefold classification insists on reappearing. But they have certain special characteristics which set them in a class apart. They have special ways of behaviour which do not seem to be covered by our ordinary conceptions of what material objects or living creatures are. We need not trouble ourselves at the moment to define or even to enumerate these special characteristics. We need only notice that people cannot be understood or investigated in the same way and through the same conceptions as material objects or even as living organisms, without leaving out something that is of the essence of their nature. Or, to put it more simply and more fundamentally, we cannot deal with people in the way in which we can deal with other things, without frustrating our own efforts and failing in our intentions. But in all this there is no suggestion of a dualism of Mind and Matter. Indeed, the dualism would never suggest itself but for one fact, that we ourselves, who are carrying on the investigation, belong to this class of things, and that our knowledge of ourselves is very different from our knowledge of other people like ourselves. I know myself from inside, as it were, while I know other people only from outside. I know myself as a set of activities and energies to which I give the general name of consciousness. But I also know myself from outside in the same way as I know you, though not so well. It is worth while to remember that our external knowledge of our- selves is not so complete or satisfactory as our external knowledge of other people. But there is enough of it, perhaps, to enable it to act as a kind of middle term between our knowledge of ourselves and of them. It suggests to us that other people know themselves as we know ourselves, from inside, and that they know us as we know them, from outside. I do not wish to endorse this as an account of how we come to know other persons as persons, but it is certainly 270</page><page sequence="8">THE DUALISM OF MIND AND MATTER a natural account and true so far as it goes. It indicates, however, how we come to think of ourselves in a dual way, as known from outside and from inside, or to put it in terms of the dualism, from the mental side and from the material side. Here, then, for the first time we come across a fact that seems to suggest a dualism between Mind and Matter so far as persons are concerned. It is not, I believe, the real root of the dualistic illusion, because the formulation of it as a distinction between mental and material aspects, presupposes that we have already adopted the Mind-Matter dualism as a basis of our classification. But we may let that pass for the moment. Now, if we admit that this suggests a dualism, we must notice that it is not the metaphysical dualism of Mind and Matter. It could only lead us to credit the class of things that we call persons with a dual nature. At most it would suggest that persons consist of a body and a mind, and that these two constituents, as we experience them, are radically different and mutually exclusive. It may be psychologically natural to read this dualism into the nature of Reality as a whole. To do so would be a form of anthropomorphism, for it would consist in projecting what we take to be a characteristic of human beings into the field of objective Reality. The tendency to anthropomorphism, however, does not constitute a good reason for accepting the dualism of Mind and Matter as a metaphysical classification. But is there any ground for thinking that the double way in which we are aware of ourselves suggests a dualism of mind and body as the proper analysis of persons? It arises only for each of us in one particular case, our own. If we were to forget ourselves and to think only of our experience of other people, we should conclude that they were living beings with certain special peculiari- ties of behaviour. There would be no prima facie suggestion that what we know when we know another person is some combination of a body and a mind. In other words, unless we had already accepted the dualistic classification of persons, we should never use it to interpret our experience of other persons. The dualism of body and mind could only arise through a reflection upon the two ways in which I am aware of myself, through external perception and through introspection. In this case, it is suggested that we are aware of our bodies in external perception and of our minds in introspection. But are we? Let us examine the inference that is involved. The premiss which we take from our experience is the proposition, "I know myself both from outside and from inside." The conclusion is that "I know my mind and I know my body." It is surely impossible to infer the second from the first. The first implies that 271</page><page sequence="9">PHILOSOPHY one and the same entity is known in two different ways. The second implies that two different entities are known in one and the same way. The transition is obviously illogical. If introspection is myself knowing a mind, and the external perception is myself knowing a body, then I can be neither the body nor the mind, nor a fortiori the two together. If I can properly say that I have a body and also that I have a mind, what is it that has them? If I am a mind, then that mind might perhaps have a body; and if I am a body then possibly that body might have a mind. But I cannot both be a body and have a body, nor can I be a mind and have a mind. Surely if it is true that I know myself in two distinct ways-and that seems incontrovertible-then I cannot consist of a mind and a body which are mutually exclusive. I can properly generalize my experience by saying that it is a characteristic of persons that that have the capacity of knowing themselves in two different ways. To introduce a Mind-Body dualism is to deny this. Therefore, this fact provides no logical grounds even for a dualism of mind and body. I should like, in this connexion, to draw your attention to a fundamental difference between the dualism of mind and body and the dualism of Mind and Matter. When we distinguish between our minds and our bodies, we are thinking of our bodies not as material objects but as animal organisms. We are contrasting our rational with our animal nature. By body in this antithesis, we do not mean what the physicist means when he says "all bodies gravitate," but when we use the Mind-Matter dualism this is precisely what we mean by "matter." Thus if we came to the conclusion that the Mind-Body dualism was a proper one, that would afford no logical ground for the Mind-Matter dualism. We could not logically pass from the one to the other. If we refer back to the natural threefold division of the constituents of the world into material objects, living beings, and persons, we can see that the Mind-Matter dualism arises, though illegitimately, through a contrast between the first and the third which omits the second, while the Mind-Body dualism arises, though again improperly, from the contrast of the second and third, which omits the first. That is why Descartes, for example, who started from the Mind-Matter dualism, was forced to consider all living beings, with the exception of persons, as automata. We must now turn to the field in which the dualism of Mind and Matter has been most discussed in modern philosophy-the field of the Theory of Knowledge. If we reject, for philosophical purposes, our natural tendency to limit our thinking to the objective field of what we experience, leaving our experiencing of it out of account, and try to think of the total fact of ourselves experiencing the 272</page><page sequence="10">THE DUALISM OF MIND AND MATTER world, we have to take a new distinction into account. We have to distinguish between that which knows and that which is known, between the subject and the object. The logical dualism of subject and object describes the fundamental form of any cognitional experience whatever. In any case of knowing, there must be a subject-that which knows, and an object-that which is known. Logically, subject and object are correlative terms which exclude one another. By definition, the subject is that in any instance of knowing which is not the object; and the object is that which is not the subject. Now, in actual fact, it is we who know, and, there- fore, it is natural to identify ourselves with the subject in experience. But also we use the term "mind" as a generic term for that which knows, and, therefore, we tend to identify the subject with mind and so ourselves with instances of mind. This is, in fact, the normal way in which the dualism of Mind and Matter appears in modern philosophical discussions. "I am a thinking being," says Descartes, "that is to say, a knower. Mind, in general, is that which knows. Therefore, I am a mind." In other words, the term "subject," "mind," and "self," or "ego," or "I" are all in different references definable as "that which knows." And as soon as mind is identified with the subject it is natural, where the dualistic tendency is already in operation, to identify matter with the object. It is natural, I say, although it is completely illogical. The connexion is purely an association of ideas. If we are operating with a distinction between Mind and Matter and also with a distinction between subject and object, and if there is in the field which we are investigating a ground for identifying the subject with mind, there will be a psycho- logical tendency to identify the object with matter. Thus there is a psychological explanation ready to our hand for the association of the logical dualism of subject and object with the metaphysical dualism of Mind and Matter. There is, however, no logical justification for this association. In the first place, a logical dualism is formal. A metaphysical dualism is not. A metaphysical distinction is a distinction in the object. It is part of the analysis of what is known, and has nothing therefore to do with a logical distinction between what knows and what is known. What knows from a metaphysical point of view is part of what is known, and is, therefore, considered as object. If there is a reason for identifying the subject with mind, there is absolutely none for identifying the object with matter. Indeed, the association at once denies the possibility of metaphysics or even of psychology. For, unless mind can be the object in a case of knowing, there can obviously be no knowledge of mind, and if mind is a constituent of reality, there can then be no knowledge of Reality. But the iden- tification of the object with matter is palpably grotesque, since s 273</page><page sequence="11">PHILOSOPHY no one who makes it ever means (as he ought to mean) that the only objects of knowledge are material ones. The dualism of Mind and Matter is, indeed, the belief that the world which we know- that is to say, the world as object-consists of two kinds of objects, mental and material. To identify the object with matter implies, therefore, that the dualism of Mind and Matter is false, and logically must lead to a pure materialism in metaphysics. Any philosophy, therefore, which confuses the subject-object distinc- tion with the Mind-Matter distinction, is inherently materialistic, however ideal may be the terminology in which it is expressed. The two distinctions have, in fact, no point of contact, and, there- fore, the logical distinction between subject and object can never provide any reason for a belief in the dualism of Mind and Matter. Unless we already had the Mind-Matter dualism in our thoughts, the association of the two would never be set up. This in itself indicates that the source of the dualism of Mind and Matter cannot lie in the logical field. There is another feature of the logical distinction which is, I believe, not usually appreciated, but which is very important for modern philosophy. It is that the distinction between subject and object, however essential it may be for logic, cannot be made the starting-point of any philosophical inquiry into the nature of Reality, because it cannot legitimately be generalized. When I begin to reflect upon my experience, I quite naturally draw a distinction between myself experiencing and what I experience. I have no objection to that distinction. It is quite a proper one. But it is a different dis- tinction for each one of us. If I draw it, it puts me on one side of the line and everything else on the other. If you draw it, it puts you on one side of the line and everything else, including me, on the other. Each person is both subject and object; subject for himself and object for every other subject. If I try to use this distinction between myself and what I experience as the basis of a meta- physical construction (as Descartes did, for example) I imply that I am the only subject and that all other persons are parts of the object-world. I am, in the world, that which knows. Everybody else is part of what is known. I am, in fact, unwittingly committed to solipsism. Solipsism is the philosophical correlative of egoism or individualism. It corresponds to the practical attitude which says "I am the only agent. The rest of the world is material for the service of my selfhood." All individualist philosophy-that is to say, practically all modern philosophy-does illegitimately generalize the subject in order to escape the dilemma of solipsism. It does so by assuming that there are a large number of different "I's," yet that all of them, in some mystical sense, are really the same "I" repeated at different points in space and time. That is why it 274</page><page sequence="12">THE DUALISM OF MIND AND MATTER is driven to talk of the Ego or the Self or the Mind or, in another connexion, the Will. For, if the different subjects were really dif- ferent, they would all have to be credited with different objects, and there would be no common world or Universe for them to discuss or to belong to. But because of its starting-point such philosophy can only produce a pluralism of solipsisms,-a plurality of unrelated worlds-which is of course a blank absurdity. This point is so fundamental that it is difficult even to express it or to become aware of it, since we are all individualists with minds shaped by an individualistic tradition. But it shows itself in the fact that our modern philosophy completely ignores the second person. It is full of Ego and Meum, but it knows nothing of Tu and Tuum. Yet the terms "I" and "You" are strictly correlative, and their correlation is the proper truth in the familiar statement that human nature is essentially social. The "I" in isolation is non-existent. The real unit of rational experience on the subject side is not "I" but "I and You," in mutual relation. The logical distinction, then, between Subject and Object affords no ground for accepting or even considering a metaphysical dualism of Mind and Matter. To argue that since I am a subject aware of objects, therefore what I am aware of must be divided into material entities and mental entities, is a palpable non sequitur of the crudest kind. Is there, then, any other field in which we can hope to dis- cover a prima facie ground for entertaining the idea of a dualism of mental and material? There is only one other direction, so far as I can see, in which we may look. It is the distinction between things and images. But before examining this distinction, which comes nearer to suggesting a dualism than any of the others, I should like to dispose of a purely verbal confusion that might tend to blur the argument at this point. All persons have certain capaci- ties, such as thinking, remembering, perceiving, imagining, deciding, and so on, which we are accustomed to describe as mental capacities. I can see no objection to this use of the term mental so long as we do not read the Mind-Matter dualism into it. We should do this if we implied by the term "mental capacities" that these were the powers of an entity called a "mind." The issue may become clearer if we compare an analogous case. We speak in a similar way of the "vital" functions of organisms. They have such vital capacities as assimi- lating food and reproducing themselves. But no one imagines that this suggests that "vital functions" means functions of something called "life," which is somehow dualistically conjoined with the bodies of organisms. Why, then, should anyone think that the phrase "mental capacities" means capacities of something called a mind. Surely only because they already have the dualism of Mind and Matter, or rather of Mind and Body in their thinking. This is indeed 275</page><page sequence="13">PHILOSOPHY characteristic of most arguments advanced in favour of the dualism as well as of a great number (such as Berkeley's) which are raised against it. They are themselves consequences of dualistic thought, and can therefore neither support the dualism nor refute it. They presuppose it. But the distinction of things and images, or, more satisfactorily, of things that exist and things that are imagined, is on a different footing. In some sense we must admit that there are hosts of things which, as we say, exist only in idea, or are purely imaginary. If, then, we are to begin our philosophical task with a classification of all that there is, must we not start with the distinction between two classes of objects, one class which exists independently and one which exists only "in the mind"? And is not this distinction logically prior to what we called the "natural" classification of things into inanimate, animate, and personal, since that is a classi- fication which refers only to the things which exist independently? Surely here we have at least a prima facie case for the dualism of Mind and Matter? I do not think that it provides even a prima facie suggestion of the dualism. The reason why it seems to do so is that we are apt to state the distinction, as I have just done, in terms which are the product of the dualism. If we talk of objects which exist in the mind and objects which exist independently of the mind, we are obviously assuming the existence of the mind as an entity and therefore we have assumed the dualism. Any conclusion in favour of the dualism which we draw from this premiss will inevitably be circular and fallacious. We must first state the distinction in a form which does not assume the dualism. And this is not merely possible, it is the natural way to state it. For common sense the distinction is one between imaginary things and real things. The unicorn, for example, is an imaginary animal, while the horse is a real animal. In this form the distinction offers no prima facie ground for dualism; indeed it implies the opposite. For the dualism is a classification of Reality into its real components, while the distinction between real and imaginary things excludes the latter from Reality and implies that they do not exist in Reality and cannot therefore be constituents of it. But we cannot leave the matter here, because someone will at once object that imaginary objects are part of our experience and that we cannot therefore merely ignore them in a philosophical account of the nature of things. That is of course true, and we must agree that a philosophy which took no account of the imagination and its activities would be ridiculous. But the question is only whether the facts necessitate a dualistic interpretation from the beginning. Now there is one peculiar difficulty which will arise if we answer this question in the affirmative. If we divide 276</page><page sequence="14">THE DUALISM OF MIND AND MATTER the whole of what we experience into imaginary entities and real entities, and insist that this implies a dualism of Mind and Matter, on which side of the dualism will mind fall? Is my mind an "imaginary" or a "real" entity? If we answer that it is not an imaginary entity we shall have to conclude that every actual mind is a material entity; and that makes nonsense of the dualism. If we reply that mind is an imaginary entity-and that is in my opinion the proper answer-then we must assume that I imagine it, and that I am not an imaginary entity, but a real one; and therefore, in terms of the dualism, that I am a material entity. Now, common sense maintains that we produce the objects of our imagination, and that therefore they depend on us for their exis- tence. Their existence is their being imagined. But there is a stream of philosophical tradition which establishes another type of dualism by an implicit denial of this dependence of what is imagined on the person who imagines it. Why, it may be asked, should the objects we imagine (or to use an old phrase of Plato's, who is the main source of this thought), the objects we can only see with the eye of the soul, be more dependent upon us for their existence than the objects we perceive with our bodily senses? This may be taken in either of two ways. We may answer either that what we perceive and what we imagine are equally dependent upon us, or that both are equally independent. The first gives us the Platonic metaphysic with its dualism of two worlds, both indepen- dent of the persons who apprehend them; the second gives us modern Idealism in which both real objects and imaginary objects are considered to be equally mind-dependent. But the idealist solution presupposes the Mind-Matter dualism and so does not concern us now; while the Platonic dualism can find no place for the person who both perceives and imagines. He cannot be properly assigned to either of the two worlds and can only be included in the classi- fication at all by the tour de force of supposing that he belongs to both at once. To suppose this is to suppose that the same entity is at once real and imaginary. We must return, then, to our proper question, whether the dis- tinction between real and imaginary objects provides a prima facie case for the dualism of Mind and Matter. Since it is a prima facie case that we are seeking, we must accept the prima facie dependence of imagined objects upon the person who imagines them. Now this provides a prima facie case against the dualism, unless we are pre- pared to make the ridiculous assumption that "I depend upon the activities of my own mind for my existence." The objects which I imagine, so far as they are imaginary objects, and not real objects apprehended through imagination, are functions of my imagining and dependent upon me. I myself am a real object, not an imaginary one, whether I am aware of myself from without or from within. 277</page><page sequence="15">PHILOSOPHY I recall here this dual self-awareness in order to emphasize the point that in introspection it is myself that is apprehended. If, therefore, I am aware through introspection of images or "objects of imagina- tion," I am aware of them as dependent on me, as modifications of my own real nature. These images and ideas, then, if they are in any sense constituent parts of reality, can only be so because they are constituent parts of me. They can be elements in Reality only because I am an element in reality, and not in their own right. I can only contrast them with the rest of Reality by contrasting myself with the rest of Reality. The question about the nature of images is thus part of the question about the nature of persons, and it falls within the natural classification of Reality into inanimate things, living organisms, and persons. It follows that the distinction between things and images cannot provide a prima facie case in favour of a dualism of Mind and Matter. At the most it can be construed, and, illegitimately construed, in terms of the dualism, if the dualism has already been presupposed. The effort to construe the distinction between imaginary entities and real entities as a dualism of Mind and Matter has a very curious corollary which may well form the conclusion of this essay. If by "my mind" I mean the complex of entities which are revealed by introspection, in contrast to the objects which are revealed by the bodily senses, then "my mind" must be a complex imaginary object. Now the characteristic of any imaginary object or mental entity lies in the fact that its "esse" is "imaginari." It exists, that is to say, only in and through the activity which apprehends it. If, then, I cease to think or imagine "my mind," it ceases to exist. If we all were to cease thinking that there is such a thing as mind, there would cease to be such a thing as mind. If, on the other hand, I mean by "my mind" my activities of thinking and perceiving and imagining and so on, if I mean, that is to say, "me thinking," then I am a real entity possessed of these capacities, and there is no need to suppose that I must have a mind in order to possess them. For common sense at least, the "I" that thinks-certainly the "you" that thinks-is an object that can be seen and heard and handled. I cannot claim that this search for a reason for entertaining the dualism of Mind and Matter is exhaustive. There may be a field which has been overlooked. But it seems to me to reveal such egregious implications of that dualism as to justify a highly sceptical attitude, and to suggest the effort to describe the nature of Reality without assuming a dualistic classification as the proper starting- point of any new philosophical construction. The proper supplement of this essay would be an explanation of how the dualistic illusion arises. Such an inquiry, however, falls within the province of the psychologist rather than of the philosopher. 278</page></plain_text>
