<plain_text><page sequence="1">4i8 Book Reviews sorting out of groups of ideas and their clear relation to each other very hard, yet the more necessary. The difficulty would, I think, have been successfully handled by her had she not made her initial decision that "since much has already been written on Palace of the Peacock, I shall take it for granted that the story line is known and understood." What an assumption! It presupposes that all her readers have read the critical literature, that all the interpreters understand the "story line" in the same way, and that she has nothing to contribute about it at this time and in this context. But the "story" itself is a basic poetic image whose development contains the development of the others and which also should be analyzed. Had Maes-Jelinek first given her inter- pretation of the "story," she might then have grouped her other ideas under such headings as "transformations of imagery" or "moments of intensity," for example. Or the story, if told as she went along (which did in part happen, but not dearly) could have provided a framework, permitting the analysis of imagery, moments of intensity, significance of characters, and so on, to be presented from stage to stage with more clarity. Or better, Maes-Jelinek's sensitive imagination might have conceived some less obvious method. Except for this flaw, The Naked Design is an outstanding example of how creative a contribution the interpretation of a work of literature can be. Joyce Sparer Adler Ulli Beier. The Return of the Gods: The Sacred Art of Susanne Wen- ger. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1975. 120 pages. ?5.75; $14.95. This lavishly illustrated book on modern Yoruba sacred art defies cate- gorization. It is, in one sense, an artistic biography of Susanne Wen- ger; but Beier abstains from artistic judgments of the sort that are usually to be found in monographs on particular artists. He cites six of Robert Thompson's nineteen aesthetic criteria by their Yoruba names, only to say that in twenty years of residence with orisha wor- shipers, Wenger has never heard them discuss their carved figures in such terms. The Yoruba aborisha, or worshipers, simply speak of suc- cessful carvings as "ere," sacred images. These are produced by carvers who undergo a tremendous discipline of ritual and psychological con- centration. Their aesthetic is unconscious in the same sense that most</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 419 of us are not conscious of the complex and highly structured grammar and lexicon of our own native language. Wenger regards her art as the construction of ere, sculptured ob- jects in which spiritual and magical forces are concentrated. By being concentrated into particular places and objects (and concepts?), these forces are brought under control and made less dangerous; it is in this way and in this sense that they are given a kind of life and home in association with human society. From one point of view, the orisha are emanations from or aspects of Olodumare, the Supreme God. Each orisha is the universe looked at from another angle (p. 33). Said an- other way, each orisha is like a variable in a mathematical equation. On the other hand, one aspect of the orisha is anthropomorphic. He or she has needs and joys and sorrows like a human being. One of these needs is for a home and privacy. As Wenger puts it, "The wall that we are building round the Oshun shrine has no other function than to give the Orisha privacy" (p. 94). Whatever else is true of them, the great family of mud-cement sculptures and sculptured shrines that Wenger and her associates have erected at Oshogbo bear the powerful stamp of her-and their-concentration. Wenger has produced an artistic phenomenon of the first order at Oshogbo. Naturally, it is not immediately understandable, nor always welcome, to people who have been educated in a different tradition. "Talking more seriously on Yoruba religion, [Wenger) says that the difficulty with orisha worship is that it requires so much human con- centration. The world is now open. There is traffic. This new traffic in ideas and people brings a great deal of stimulus, but too much stimulus endangers concentration" (p. 56). Since the old psychological concen- tration of the cult groups is too rarely available today to guarantee the continued presence of the orisha, Wenger says that artistic forms must be found as another means to the same end, and symbols must be brought in from the rest of the world to help. She says, "Today every gesture we make, every form, has to make the principles of orisha clear. ... A traditional shrine could be merely functional: could sim- ply serve as a building in which certain activities took place. What we are doing now is expressionist architecture" (pp. 90-91). The result is very powerful. Beier's book gives us a generous sample of excellent photographs of Wenger's art and of its natural, personal, and urban context. He also gives us a very useful short description of Oshogbo, including both the documentary and the mythological sides of its history. There is a brief</page><page sequence="3">420 Book Reviews artistic biography of Wenger herself, including pictures of two of her paintings from her Viennese period and four photographs of her batiks. It should be said, however, that Wenger has done a great deal of im- portant work since Beier's book was compiled. Five chapters are devoted to Yoruba religion, and it is here that Wenger's thought is most explicitly present. The study of Yoruba re- ligion is still fragmentary and superficial, and Wenger is an important and valid witness to it. Her seventeen years of devoted living in a Yoruba town and working artistically with Yoruba culture enable her to give us an inside view of the religion, where others have reported it from the outside. (I would not regard Professor Wande Abimbola as an "outsider," however [p. 33}. His work with Ifa divination poetry gives us very important "inside" evidence on Yoruba religion, albeit very different in kind from Wenger's.) More than forty pages of the book are devoted to the shrine, to the creative process, as Wenger sees it, and to the work of her closest col- laborators, who are fine artists in their own right. As Beier puts it, "The shrines at Oshun (of Oshogbo) are thus born of a rare symbiosis of minds, of a rare cooperation between artists. The human relationship between these artists is very important to Susanne Wenger: it replaces, up to a point at least, the communal subconscious that can no longer feed and sustain their work" (p. 93). Beier's book is a very fine introduction to Wenger's fundamental role in what I like to call "The Oshogbo Renaissance." He is quite right in calling attention to the work of other artists in Oshogbo, to the work of the Mbari Mbayo Club, and to the music dramas of Ladipo and the late Kola Ogunmola. Naturally, much remains to be said and studied. It is in an effort to be constructive that I add a few remarks, some of them critical. I am grateful to Beier for telling us (p. 20) that "Obotunde Iji- mere" is his own pen name. Librarians and bibliographers please take note! Since Beier was writing for the international art world (which does not like to hear about economics), it was probably legitimate to omit mention of the role of the University of Ibadan in the course of Wen- ger's career. The day of royal and aristocratic patrons is long past, how- ever, in both Europe and West Africa. Their place today must be filled by other institutions, such as the universities, if art is to continue to flourish in the technological-technocratic, modern world. In fact, the Oshogbo Renaissance may be viewed as a particularly fine feather in</page><page sequence="4">BOOK REVIEWS 421 the cap of the Extra-Mural Programme of the University of Ibadan. Susanne Wenger came to Ibadan in 1950 as the wife of a well- known tutor in the Department of Extra-Mural Studies of the Univer- sity of Ibadan. She has never been on the University staff, but she has in a real sense been a part of the University family for twenty-six years. When Oshogbo was chosen as a center for University extramural ac- tivities, she went there with her husband. On page 26, Beier speaks of "the magnificent Yoruba stone mansion Susanne Wenger lives in at present." Taken literally, this would suggest that Wenger is a very wealthy lady. Nothing could be farther from the truth. She lives from hand to mouth, and since her illness in the early 1950s, she has never been strong. The house in question, which is shown on page 11, was completed by the University for its extramural program. As a part of the agreement with the owners, the University has held the house on a long-term lease. In Wenger's hands it has become something between a museum of modern African art (very little of which is Wenger's) and an international shrine that attracts visitors from all over the world. By an informal agreement, the University in recent years has allowed Wenger to live in the house and take care of it. Ulli Beier has essentially written his own book. There is a great deal of Wenger's thinking in it, but except where it is shown that she is being quoted directly, it should be assumed that what we are reading are Beier's paraphrases, interpretations, or views. That some of these are subject to correction is shown by the statement attributed to Wenger implicitly on page 53: "that some art is prelinguistic communication." Wenger has told me that what she said-or meant-was "pre-rational communication." Beier is generous enough to say, "Ideally Susanne Wenger should have written this book herself. No one else's interpreta- tion-however sympathetic-could do full justice to this complex per- sonality" (p. 10). She has, by now, written such a book, but bringing it to publication has proved to be no easy task. A couple of technical linguistic remarks seem in order. "Alajere," on page 42, analyzes into o-ni-ajere, "he (or they) who has (have) ajere." "Ajere" is a colander, a vessel with holes that may be used for washing vegetables-or, on occasion, as a fish trap. Its most general use in Nigeria, however, is as a container for meat that is being smoked over a fire. I like to call it a "fire-colander," and this is surely the origin of the fire symbolism of which Beier speaks. The traditional previous home of Oshogbo is Ipole not Ikole (p. 17). The linguists will not be happy with the discussion of "the com-</page><page sequence="5">422 Book Reviews plex multivalent verb li or ni," on page 44. There are really two dif- ferent verbs here, li or ni (high tone), "to have, own," and li or ni (mid-tone) "to be" (the identifier, which has the peculiarity that it follows its predicate). Both verbs follow similar rules for the appear- ance of 1- or n-, but the choice of interpretation between these verbs in a given Yoruba sentence is not ambiguous. Olorisha can only mean "one who has orisha." "One who is orisha" would be a completely dif- ferent sentence in Yoruba. "One who makes orisha" would have noth- ing to do with any of the "ni" words. This is not to say that the idea of making the god is not important. As in ancient Rome, the worshiper is very conscious of making the god he worships; but this must be understood in the sense of the first paragraph of this review. Finally, Beier gives us (pp. 105-10) English translations of two short praise poems, oriki, one for Ajagemo, the Priest of Obatala (see pp. 24, 29, 53), and one for Alajere (p. 42). These are useful re- minders of the vast poetic dimension to Yoruba art and life. One could wish that we had a word or two about the origin of these fine poems. Who chanted them? How were they recorded, transcribed, translated? It would be good to be able to compare the Yoruba with the English. But perhaps I am quibbling. Accepted for what it sets out to be, a sensitive and well-informed presentation of Susanne Wenger's unique artistic life and work in Oshogbo, the book is a real success. It reads very easily, and the pub- lishers have given it an elegant production. At the price of ?5.75, it is a very good buy, and a serious contribution to the continuing dialogue on the development of modern art in Nigeria. Robert G.
