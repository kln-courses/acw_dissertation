<plain_text><page sequence="1">REMARKS ON THE POPULARITY OF MICKEY MOUSE By Fritz Moellenhoff, M. D. (Peoria) It is twelve years since Mickey Mouse first put in an appear ance. From the history of this mobile and moving figure it is inter esting to observe that his first appearance was a complete failure. We have reason to presume that the failure arose from the fact that Mickey Mouse was first heard with his creator's voice. We have difficulty in imagining this today since we have become so familiar with the voice that is now used for him. Mickey's difficult time did not last long and today everyone knows what an enormous success he has had and how he attracts both young and old. You see him as children's toys, as brooches, adorning boxes of Corn Flakes, or appearing in other places as advertisements. If one asks people at random if they like Mickey Mouse, one definitely finds more affirmative than negative answers. Someone who, at my suggestion, made inquiries among his circle of friends found more supporters of Mickey Mouse among women than men. Whether this is the rule, I do not know, I am inclined to attribute it to the fact that women are more closely involved in their children's delight in the movie. There is little doubt that most children accept the films promptly and unreservedly. Without difficulties their phantasy is linked to the simple pictures, the immediate happenings which take place and which do not presuppose any knowledge but touch on the child's emotions simply by visual means. Repetition of actions and gestures, painfully tiresome for the adult, give profound satis faction to the child. Repetition is a means to overcome anxiety and to strengthen self-confidence. In the Mickey Mouse films we find a continuous repetition of leaps across precipices, of capture and es cape, of attack and defence. Monotony does not seem to exist for the child. Just as a verse is sung fifty times with an untired en thusiasm, so the fiftieth leap is watched with the same amount of pleasure as was the first. The principal character of this play of motion is a mouse. This fact is already a paradox for the adult. The mouse is a fearful, flighty little animal, annoying only because of its voracity and the noise it makes during the night, and certainly</page><page sequence="2">20 FRITZ MOELLENHOFF, M. D. most unfit for playing a lead on the stage. Children, on the contrary, enjoy its insignificance here partly because it is so successful in overcoming obstacles. It is difficult to understand why the creator of Mickey Mouse chose a mouse when it would have been much simpler, in many respects, to select for instance a supple cat. Should we not suppose the creator has an intuitive knowledge of a child's reactions? The small creature fights, runs around and is very much more successful than the bigger ones. It concerns one of the most frequent day dreams of childhood, the dream to be grown up. Though pleasurable for many children I found a number of the little would-be-greats, in whom, at times, this dream was ac companied or followed by anxiety. For them the Mickey Mouse films contain an extra gratification: the day dream is playfully substituted by a series of pictures in which smallness is victorious throughout. Everybody, however, has seen the slowly growing enthusiasm of the adults for Mickey Mouse, which followed an initial failure for which several reasons may be advanced. Earlier I mentioned the first voice of Mickey Mouse and the fact that the whole concept affects the adult as paradoxical. Many of us are inclined to feel of fended whenever we suspect that we are not taken very seriously. When in this mood, it is impossible to get away from the monotony and silliness of these films which then become their most conspicu ous features. Furthermore the lack of causality becomes offensive to our thinking and the eternal gaiety and unfounded optimism affect our nerves. Still we know that the mouse conquered several con tinents. In Europe, critics spoke of a specific product of American humour. Its characteristic was said to be a denial of man's need for logic and a preference to a grotesque and crude chaos of which there is an abundance in the Mickey Mouse films. But in spite of differences of humour existing in various nations the mouse became an international success even though most adults were reluctant to permit themselves to leave the realm of intellectual control and surrender to a playfully primitive world. It is an anthropomorphosized animal world where a mouse has all kinds of dangerous and difficult adventures. The companions of the mouse are a somewhat silly and depressed setter and an ar rogant, foolish drake. Malicious and threatening enemies are every where. Giants, gigantic apes, bulls, all are bent on obstructing the</page><page sequence="3">REMARKS ON THE POPULARITY OF MICKEY MOUSE 21 well meant intentions of the mouse. The material world, especially the world of technical object, plays its part tooâ€”sometimes in a helpful and sometimes in a hampering manner. The wild actions, jumping, fighting, being vanquished, conquering, all these are done at a breakneck speed. At times a plan of action is concocted, but rarely carried through since it usually ends up by haphazard wander ing. These themes are repeated again and again. At intervals some body is rescued. The mouse proves to be persevering, courageous and cunning. Even the reserved critic is compelled to recognize the mouse as the hero. Besides feeling amused he cannot help feeling admira tion, the conscious content of which might be fused sooner or later with a more primitive excitement. At this point the critic is exposed to the danger of identification. It cannot be far away when we are looking at the vital little hero who is endowed with the ability to evoke admiration. Then, I suppose, the danger comes nearer and nearer and the process of identification is in statu nascendi. It is, as we know, one of the most important approaches to enjoy ment, which we seek and find both on the stage and in the films. And it is identification, too, which after hours of happy or un happy, or at any rate keen, suspense, brings us so often into a state of fatigue or irritation because the actual identification has left us. Then we are again alone with ourselves and, after the loss is to some degree overcome, we then deal with our daydreams in which the figure of our identification still plays a part. But it has become dim, less real. We need some effort to assume its shape. Difficulties arise from what we might call the "everyday super-ego". The process of disillusionment is especially apparent in theatergoers when, on their way home, some are silent, others talk about a thousand trifles, quite unrelated to what they have seen. Some suddenly feel very tired, and others even depressed. After Mickey Mouse films, however, I did not observe any of these phenomena. Speaking of Mickey Mouse as an object of identification will undoubtedly arouse resistance. Could one possibly identify oneself with this something? The fact that he is an animal would not speak against it. Literature teaches us that poets and writers like to furnish animals with human character features and to have them talk about good and evil. Remember Aesop's and La Fontaine's fables and Goethe's epic "Reinecke Fuchs." But if one admitted that identification were possible, the material of the film, men</page><page sequence="4">22 FRITZ MOELLENHOFF, M. D. tioned briefly above, is so ridiculously light that any concern with it later on would seem to be most unlikely. Even if we accept an identification process, the fact that we are not concerned with it later on is because our experiences are so fleeting and because they seldom leave the plane of visual entertainment to go more deeply. A little while ago I would have completely agreed with this view. But I couldn't imagine that such an extraordinary popularity could be based only on the fact that we find in these films an abun dance of amusing fun, a series of bizarre phenomena of motion, and a complete disregard for the need of causality. Popularity has almost always to do with the unconscious of the persons with whom something or someone is popular. In this case the content of the Mickey Mouse films cannot be so ridiculously light, it has the necessary weight to sink into the deeper layers of our mind. Are we not then more justified in calling Mickey Mouse a hero with whom one can identify oneself? And as far as identi fication is concerned, it seems to me not only that it is completed without effort, but I am even inclined to say that there are funda mental qualities in Mickey Mouse which particularly promote iden tification. We have here to deal with an unusually uninhibited process of identification. This may sound bold if not again paradox ical. But such a statement is prompted by the popularity, the inter national success of Mickey Mouse. Let us look at the hero a little more closely, at his physique, some of his physiological functions and certain actions which are characteristic of him. He has the head of a mouse, exaggerated, impudent, childish. The neck is missing. The body is round, fat, undifferentiated. Arms and legs are un naturally thin, hands and feet unnaturally large. The body seems best fit for rolling on the floor and the limbs for flying through the air. The larynx contains a most peculiar voice, it is crowing, thin, without modulation and we are unable to tell whether the character is a man, woman or child. Let us not forget that Mickey Mouse was successful only after his inventor created this second voice. Mickey's actions have impressed one fact upon us: he is an extremely gifted acrobat. But if we examine his movements from a more clinical standpoint we find that they often give a mechanized impression, they have something of the inanimate elasticity of a</page><page sequence="5">REMARKS ON THE POPULARITY OF MICKEY MOUSE 23 rubber ball and then again remind one of a baby's first attempt at walking (in the waddling stages). As to the contents of his actions, we spoke of wandering, adventures, but what we did not find are love affairs. I know that the hero occasionally rescues a heroine and embraces her. But the bodily forms of Mickey Mouse are so drawn that one immediately establishes the fact that they are ill-adapted to physical expressions of love. Embraces become more than ridiculous, arms fan the air in protestations of love, kisses are seldom exchanged, and are absurdly clumsy. I know that animals cannot kiss each other. But apart from the anthropomorphosis of Mickey Mouse, animals have tender and what seem to be convincing caresses which are not to be compared with the grotesque advances in these films. I should like to mention that savages and children often find the kisses of grown-ups amusing or disagreeable. At first we might think the omission of love-affairs was done intentionally since the film was produced principally for an audience of children and that love affairs, therefore, had been excluded. However, since we do know how interested children are in such things we can dismiss this idea. Nothing persists but the somewhat painful statement that our hero is unable to love, that he is someone who, from the point of view of genitality, makes no decisions because he does not need to. We have described his physique, motor expressions and voice. We know that when Mickey Mouse appeared with a man's voice he met with ridicule; with the eunuch's voice he met with laughter. That was an understandable reaction of the public, which knows how much the voice has to do with sex and with the structure of the body. Considered from the unconscious readiness for identification on the part of the audience this refusal was not only comprehensible but justified. Generally one does not like to identify oneself with what is confusing and therefore dangerous. But when Mickey appeared with his "apt" voice, he became definitely the representative of a lively, though neutral sex. We believe to have proved our statement that Mickey Mouse's funda mental qualities almost entice us to identify ourselves with him. And we hope to be justified if we say that the hero is a hermaph rodite. Identification is now established without effort and would be one of the explanations for his popularity.1 1. If we take a little time to observe the anthropomorphism of this artificial</page><page sequence="6">24 FRITZ MOELLENHOFF, M. D. Seen from the conscious, these films even though they touch the realm of the grotesque, offer no difficulty for the thinking or phantasy of the adult. Seen from the unconscious the situation is similar. It remains innocuous for the object libido. This rather rare coincidence has some share in the popularity too. In the process of identification, regression naturally plays a great part. Our readiness for regression is always mobilized when fun is made, when jokes are told or when practical jokes are per formed. They are abundant in the Mickey Mouse films and, very often lead eventually to all kinds of sadistic explosions which satisfy us considerably. Having discovered an easy outlet for our aggressions we happily regress and urged by the asexuality of our gay partner we accomplish identification with him readily. One fact, which almost always complicates matters in the process of identification, does not enter â€” the conscious or un conscious jealousy for the person with whom we try to identify ourselves. Competitive libidinal forces in our unconscious are here not provoked. Regardless of age we can well imagine the thoughts which arise in the observer's conscious mind â€” how wonderful it would be to jump around so, or, Mickey never seems to have a care, nothing ever seems to bother him. Such ideas are naturally con trolled by the conscious judgment. In the unconscious no jealousy will arise, the definite sexual neutrality of Mickey Mouse takes care of that. Here we might still add something about the smallness of our hero who, most of the time, is the tiniest character on the stage. How often during the process of regression do we experience the wish to be as small as possible. There are folklore love songs in which a lover expresses the wish to become a mouse in order to be~ able to slip unseen into the bedroom of his sweetheart. The wish tells us that the young man does not intend to do mouse and to look at him from the clinical point of view, we can easily discover parallels to certain types of dysfunction of the hypophysis as they have been described by Cushing and others. These types arc characterized by the fact that they retain some of the softness and roundness of their infancy and may even suggest the feminine form. They are further characterized by increased fatness in the regions of the neck, breasts, abdomen and hips; and in certain special cases, by conspicuously thin arms and legs as contrasting to their plethoric and fat torso. The genitals are usually undeveloped, and consequendy these types remain sexually infantile and indecisive. In respect to the anthropomorphism of Mickey Mouse, Disney has really created an endocrine type, which agrees with our hypothesis of the disturbed and deficient sexuality. As a curiosity in this connection: most experiments in the study of the hypophysis have been made witn white rats.</page><page sequence="7">REMARKS ON THE POPULARITY OF MICKEY MOUSE 25 anything bad. He would like so much to see, just to see. He is completely harmless. Well known are the tender names among lovers which stress smallness again â€” "little mouse" â€” very popular in German â€” "my baby, my little bit." There is an unconscious tendency to make the love objects temporarily asexual, in other words, to make them small. Seen from the unconscious of a grownup who really has regressed, smallness enables him to do forbidden things, almost entirely unseen. And does not our hero do forbidden things? Another attractive factor is that tiny Mickey is amazingly successful in his actions directed towards or against much bigger beings, for instance giants, who may represent parents. Seemingly invincible, they are surprised, over whelmed and vanquished. We could very easily draw parallels to those fairy tales in which ugly dwarfs play an important part. In the folklore literature dwarfs are depicted and drawn with various characteristics, but with one that is characteristic of all. Their faces are unyoung, bizarrely deformed, puzzling. They often have white beards. Physical proportions are distorted. Yet some thing unites them, the element of asexuality. Going back to our mouse, identified with his harmless person let us now consider the details and their meaning. In these films there is an abundance of possible interpretations, of which we will discuss only a few. If we try to characterize the qualities which all of the Mickey Mouse films have in common, we can say that they represent a child's world of wishes and fantasies; that there is unfolded a mechanized fairy-tale, the mechanized quality of which we are very much inclined to overlook, because the variations of the story are so closely involved with our own unconscious. In contrast to most heroes, our Mickey resolutely follows the pleasure principle. When he comes strutting along, without a care, he communicates the simple and deep pleasure of existence. Suddenly something, however, arouses his curiosity which be attempts to satisfy then and there. He cannot refrain from inspecting and touching objects as well as living things. Then something may happen, something terrible for instance, but it in no way keeps our hero from doing the same thing when the next occasion arises. He is a happy child, not yet intimidated by knowledge and experi ence. To satisfy his desires is still the supreme law. Acting follows seeing without the interposition of thinking. It is exactly as child</page><page sequence="8">26 FRITZ MOELLENHOFF, M. D. psychology describes it. If we consider the phenomena from a more clinical angle, we might speak of scoptophilia and tactophilia. Evidently they are pregenital drives. The question could come up whether this level counts for the heroes attractiveness and whether it might eliminate our hypothesis of his hermaphroditic quality. I do not believe this. Pregenital features alone would not be sufficient to explain Mickey's magnetic forces. These incidents are the more delicate ones, corresponding quite well to the character of mice. More numerous and more conspicuous are the gratifications of the sadistic impulses of our hero. It is not at all easy to decide who is the aggressor, who the victim, but there is a tremendous amount of fighting and quarreling which may strike us consciously as monotonous but which does not seem to affect our unconscious in the same way. After the gratification of aggressive impulses conflicts and anxiety appear so that the desire and need for punishment now takes the stage. This is provided for in the optical medium of the films and we must admit that the unconscious desire for punishment is seldom completed in a lighter or more casual manner than in the Mickey Mouse films. The hero goes through most harrowing situations. Because of his insatiable curiosity he finds himself in the mouth of a giant and struggles desperately against the torrential stream of beer which the giant is guzzling which carries him down into his stomach, only to make his escape again. At another time, Mickey Mouse, as circus director, tries to rescue the animal trainer from the ridicule of the audience which is made up of little Mickey Mice. Both are performing on a wire which the audience has charged with elec tricity. Both begin to burn and finally disappear in sparks. A few seconds later they reappear. These unique magic restorations have, in my opinion, a particularly profound effect on the unconscious of the observer. Death is denied and the sense of immortality is stimulated anew. The processes work very much as in a dream and illustrate the omnipotence of thought.1 In the above-mentioned film, in which Mickey Mouse appears as the circus director, and 1. An often repeated dream of a patient who, as a child, dreamed for years with the same clarity the following; she sees a wood in which dwarfs are happily bustling about. Suddenly the trees and branches begin to move in snake-like fashion, fall down, entangle each other, and crush the dwarfs. The patient sees them flying about in bloody pieces. In some dreams she later sees the dwarfs, completely whole, in a palatial house.</page><page sequence="9">REMARKS ON THE POPULARITY OF MICKEY MOUSE 27 which is particularly full of symbols, he falls from the roof of the circus tent into the water tub where the seals were supposed to do their tricks. Seized by jealousy, for he has returned to the womb, the seals jump into the tub where they stage a suffocating and horrible turmoil, which, when the tension is at its greatest, evolves into the familiar madly rotating spirals which are so often the momentary visual solution of these murderous encounters. Are they not representing a kind of world destruction ; the end of the world ? It is the rapid realization and fulfilment of destructive wishes in the visual medium. One might even say the pictures have the same time element as our thoughts. How ready are we to think and even to say that this or that city should be destroyed because our political opponent has won a victory there? How mad with rage we become when the material world does not cooperate with our desires, for example, when we do not succeed in driving a nail into a wall. At such a time we would like to destroy hammer, nail and wall. Geographical boundaries do not exist for our conscious or unconscious wishes for destruction. At one time it is a wall, at another, a world which we would like to crush. In a playful vein, as in the nursery, these problems are acted out in the film. At the conclusion of this turmoil, the smirk on our face betrays the relief of having everything in its place again. Still another example in which reality and dream symbolism mix in an incomparable manner, is when Mickey Mouse has rescued Minnie from a terrible disaster, after which he greets her only with a handshake â€” which is an important detail for our hypothe sis. An enormous, vicious bull approaches with bizarre leaps as they sit in the meadow. In order to rescue Minnie again, Mickey, the hero, like the Don Quixote of this strange anthropomorphic animal world, intuitively seizes a red cloth (Minnie's skirt, as I remember), wraps himself up in it, and disappears under the bulk of the charging bull, to crawl later cautiously out from under him. He outwitted the powerful father, he becomes incorporated and reappears with new strength. Another uneasy situation occurs when Mickey gets entangled in an automobile tire, which he has been trying to put on at top speed. From dreams we recognize this special and particularly dis turbing constraint: we want to run away and cannot, we reach for an object and unseen rubber bands hold back our arms. In</page><page sequence="10">28 FRITZ MOELLENHOFF, M. D. such instances we feel uneasy, but nevertheless the pleasure of really seeing the figure of our identification in such distress provides us needed relaxation. It is worth mentioning that in these films, as far as I know, we do not find any examples of castration symbolism, which sup ports our hypothesis of Mickey's hermaphroditism. We understand the attraction of these films from the way in which reality and fantasy are woven together; or better, the world of our conceptions of reality and that other world of fantasies and dreams. Reality and fantasy are no longer opposed, but they unite in a droll way through the medium of these jerky pictures. This unification permits the ego and the id to fulfill a number of their wishes simultaneously and in equal intensity and indeed in an animal-like disguise which corresponds so closely to dream mechanism. Considered from the esthetic point of view this unification of reality, fantasy and dream also indicates the artistic qualities of the film. One is justified in calling the Mickey Mouse films naive, childlike, and often childish, but are they not also a proof that a certain amount of naivete does not injure creativeness? I should like to mention another factor which may also be responsible for their popularity, that is, the motor activities which we find in them. Besides the peculiar character of the motion there is such an abundance of violent motor eruption that one might call it a kind of frenzy or ecstasy of movement, which is conveyed to the observer. I know it sounds like a paradox to speak of the muscular joy of such thread thin little arms and legs. But if we consider that the Mickey Mouse films disregard all physical laws anyhow and that the hero attains success in his movements â€” which we laughingly admire â€” we need not trouble our biological conscience any further. To me there is little doubt that the muscular eroticism plays a very important part in this artistic, artificial, child's dream. The laws of gravity are denied and the enjoyment might be greater than when looking at acrobats, snake-men, or eccentric dancers. I called the films an artistic, artificial dream. The word "arti ficial" was used because the Mickey Mouse films make use of tricks, photographing sketches instead of living things. The lens and other devices which produce the illusion of living movement</page><page sequence="11">REMARKS ON THE POPULARITY OF MICKEY MOUSE 29 ought to make us critical. The illusion that something is alive which is not, the artificial imitation of things which were once natural, worries us if we have time to think about it. What worries us? It is what makes possible all these illusions and imi tations â€” the machine. We speak of the machine age, the over poweringly rapid development of which causes profound doubts and anxieties. Sachs considered the question why the people of antiquity, who were acquainted with mechanical things, did not develop the machine to a greater extent. He believes that the machine had for the people of ancient times only the attraction of a plaything, but also of the repugnance against the uncanny, and that their well balanced narcissism protected them from the "sur render to the goddess of the machine." Later, driven more strongly by the exigencies of life and by the wish to gratify his narcissistic impulses by demonstrating his power, in spite of all pressure, man again found the way to the machine. In the beginning man was the master or the happy subject of mechanical inventions; now he be comes, or at least seems to become, their unfortunate slave. This brief digression into one of the most urgent problems of our time may seem strange, but we believe that the problem of the machine has something to do with our subject. The attrac tion of the Mickey Mouse films can be explained still further in that we find in them a mild attempt to ridicule the afore mentioned goddess. Machines, the automobile for example, change themselves, at least partially, into animals whose faces often take on human features. This metamorphosis, or to put it another way, this momentary refinement, affords for those who are in any way concerned with the machine, a possibility of getting rid of their anxiety, at least temporarily. Moreover, this "playful inversion of the machine age" may border on our narcissism and may touch the neighboring region where the omnipotence of thought resides. The animation of things is a very ancient and serious game, and attributing to constructed and measurable things the infinite possibilities of living movement and expression gives a profound satisfaction. We are freed from the limitations of physical laws and formulae of whose perennial value our unconscious has never been convinced. This game of animation is achieved in varying degrees; it concerns the simple as well as the subtle. Here it changes a complicated machine, there a child, finding a root,</page><page sequence="12">30 FRITZ MOELLENHOFF, M. D. makes it his living companion for hours, days or even weeks. The expressionistic painter curves a house into a melancholy grimace trying to subdue its stable form. Immortal life alone in its ever changing expression should have a right to exist. It is an attempt to deny the division of living and lifeless, so obvious in reality, because it breeds anxiety. The unconscious tries to preserve the magic power of animation, thereby combating the Nirvana prin ciple. We still have to answer the question: is not the cartoon film the "trick" film, simply a new symptom, among others and more important ones, of the increasing dictatorship of the machine? The cartoon film does not even show real people; but we do not regard this as a symptom. We are much more inclined to regard the cartoon film as an uncomplicated representation of human ideas, often very simple ones, growing from the layers of the unconscious. One thinks of the plot, of the sketches, which are connected with the unconscious of the creator and his wishes to express himself.1 Another example of the problem of the machine is illustrated when Mickey Mouse and two companions are ordered to repair an automobile by a dangerous looking, gigantic ape. They take it apart with incredible speed and after they have found the trouble, a buzzing insect, put it together again in mad haste without any sense of mechanics whatsoever. The ape thoroughly delighted to have his beloved machine in order again, swings himself into it, drives off, and then after half a minute the car explodes and with it the furious owner. The three heroes who had so completely disregarded the laws of mechanical technique, now return to their enjoyment of an idyllic life. These are only a few illustrations which I have chosen from a mass of examples in these films. I hope that they are sufficient in explaining their popularity, at least from a certain angle. Mickey's bodily appearance, his voice and his motor activity brought us to the idea of his hermaphroditism. The early failure of the film which we mentioned at the beginning, suggests another thought. For the majority of people, the mouse is a repugnant animal. The fear of mice is widespread chiefly among women. 1. One should consider, too, the played by human beings, and how exact directions which bind him closely to the precise detailed directions of a film scenario and controlled the work of the actor must be, machine â€” in this case, the camera.</page><page sequence="13">REMARKS ON THE POPULARITY OF MICKEY MOUSE 31 How did the audience overcome this? The symbolic meaning of Mickey's figure is obvious. Symbolically, we should have to call it a phallus but a desexualized one. Mickey's actions and adventures demonstrate his lack of genital interest. His audience feels that and although he remains a mouse and a phallus, he does not stir up wishes which have to be suppressed and consequently he does not rouse anxiety. In characterising our hero and his success, the psychiatrist will attribute it to his temperament. Mickey Mouse is, to say the least, a hypomanic and this unrestrained temperament has a definite connection with the comic 3nd carricature content of the films.1 The comic is evident. To Mickey's appearance one easily might associate that it is the caricature of a certain human type, small but pompous, urgently driven by the wish to have a word to say about every thing. There is the manic element again. Mickey's companions and enemies do not lack the signs of caricature either, they all are sketched in an exaggerated manner. Kris says: "Caricature means freedom, but freedom to be primitive. This innermost primitive ness in style as well as mechanism, in tendency as well as in form, is the secret of the caricature's appeal." It easily applies to the Mickey Mouse films. At another place Kris considers the manic as the pathological correlate of the comic. In the visual biography of our hero an incessant mixture of comic and caricature results. We enjoy the drastic comedy which arises when the ego frees itself from the bonds of the super-ego and allies itself for a short time with the id. We feel the freedom from inhibition and effort in this manic comedy. Who would not enjoy a situation in which the super-ego is deprived of all its rights; in which the wish-fulfilments are achieved in such a primitive fashion and in which the close relationship between our infantile fantasies, interpretations and explanations is shown? But if we glance for a moment at the other creations of Disney, the colored fairy tales, we find immediately that we have to deal with the more sublime brother of the comic â€” with humour. In these, the super-ego again rules. Rescues are brought about not 1. The comic effect can also be explained by the purely phenomenological or formal manifestations. Professor Albers (Black Mountain College) for instance, ascribes it to the fact that the qualities of rubber are transferred to man and animal.</page><page sequence="14">32 FRITZ MOELLENHOFF, M. D. only through wild and comic jumping around, but also through well prepared and successfully executed actions, for instance in the Three Little Pigs. It is no longer the crude manic explosion but kindness, effort and considerate readiness to help. Our reactions to those films which regarded esthetically are really simple and charming illustrations of fairy stories, may have unsuspected depth and may even be mixed with sentiment. The super-ego brings about these effects. The Mickey Mouse film, on the other hand, is robust, fast moving and provocative of belly-laughs. The world is turned madly upside down, but beneath this surface turmoil serious laws exist, as serious as those which a child creates for his games. BIBLIOGRAPHY Freud.
