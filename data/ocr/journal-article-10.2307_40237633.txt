<plain_text><page sequence="1">Moral ly Untenable Beliefs Richard J. Burke "It is wrong, everywhere and for anyone, to believe anything upon insufficient évidence." - W. Κ. Clifford, "The Ethics of Belief" (1876) I. Introduction Twentieth-century libérais1 have not wanted to pursue Clifford's argument that we have a moral obligation to be rational in our beliefs. They have drawn a sharp distinction between actions, which may and should be restricted by society when they infringe on thè legitimate interests of others, and beliefs, which should (or perhaps must) be left entirely up to thè individuai. Their position is summed up in the ringing words of John Stuart Mill: If all mankind minus one were of one opinion, and only one person were of the contrary opinion, mankind would be no more justifìed in silencing that one person, than he, if he had thè power, would be justifìed in silencing mankind.2 U.S. Supreme Court décisions in this Century have consistently taken this position: the First Amendment has been interpreted to mean that government has no right to rule on the "substance" of any belief, no matter how seemingly false or dangerous.3 Officiai censorship and discouragement of "anti-social" ideas by Commu- nist régimes has been strongly condemned by libérais.4 But beliefs lead to action, and action can härm others. When society tolérâtes a belief which leads to a harmful action, it con- dones the härm. I cannot see any way to avoid this conclusion. Clifford said bluntly, "It is not possible so to sever the belief from the action it suggests as to condemn the one without condemning the other."5 A belief may not always or directly issue in action, but "if a belief is not realized immediately in open deeds, it is stored up for the guidance of the future."6 My beliefs, like my actions, are mine; I must accept responsibility for their effects on others. To take the most obvious type of case first, the belief that somè class Philosophy and Rhetoric, Vol. 23, No. 3, 1990.

The problem is, where are we to find neutral criteria by which to evaluate such justifications when they are offered? If "we" (who?) decide that such a belief is unjustified, and try to discourage it (how?), are we not simply imposing our own beliefs on those who do not accept them? When Clifford spoke of "insufficient évi- dence," he was referring to "the methods of the exact sciences," which in his day were being applied by Marx, Mill, and others to moral, politicai, and economie problems, and which he was confi- dent would enable us to distinguish "rational" from "irrational" beliefs- from those based on religion, for example. He maintained that everyone has a moral obligation to proportion his degree of assent to any proposition to the weight of scientific évidence sup- porting it. "No simplicity of mind, no security of station, can es- cape the universal duty of questioning ail that we believe."7 His favorite phrase, applied repeatedly to common-sense and religious beliefs, was "They had no right to believe on such évidence as was before them."8 Today we cannot share Clifford's confidence in the application of scientific methods to value judgments. While the distinction between "facts" and "values" may hâve been overdrawn by positiv- ists and existentialists, the conceptual obstacles to determining which ethical, politicai, or religious beliefs, if any, are "scientific" remain formidable. According to Clifford's criterion, then, it would seem to follow that we should hâve no beliefs at ail about moral, politicai, or religious matters: surely a reductio ad absur- dum of Clifford's position, as William James pointed out in "The Will to Believe."9 But perhaps we can find a différent criterion of rationality and keep the gist of Clifford's argument. James's idea that it is psychologically healthy to "take risks" in belief notori- ously raises more questions than it answers. Where shall we get our criterion of mental health? And while James explicitly restricts his argument to beliefs that are "live options," "momentous," and "forced" (ail problematic concepts), he never considers beliefs that are potentially harmful to others. Generic belief in God may be innocuous; but consider belief in witches. A more promising approach to a rational criterion for moral be- liefs is the dialectical method developed by Piato and Aristotle, and used in some form by most philosophers since: thè attempi to arrive</page><page sequence="3">170 RICHARD J. BURKE at truth or understanding by the juxtaposition and comparative évaluation of arguments on both sides of an issue.10 Το determine whether abortion is morally justified, for example, onc constructs the strongest argument he can on both sides, making distinctions and eliminating inconsistencies where necessary, and then tries to decide which argument is more elegantly cohérent with facts and values broadly accepted by philosophers. The problem with this method for our pufpose is not that philosophers cannot agree: they ha ve reached conççnsus on many once-controversial issues (slavery , racism, tpftufê, aggressive warmaking, etc.), and even on an intrac- table issue like abortion there is more agreement among philoso- phers today than among thè generai public. The problem is that the average person cannot be expected to appreciate the subtle weigh- ing of various factors involved in being responsive to ail aspects of a complex issue. He is likely to attach too much or too little weight to a single principle or a single distinction. And in matters of public dispute, it is the sensibility of the average person rather than the trained philosopher that seems most relevant. In this paper I will explore the possibility that the relevant crite- rion of "rational" or "reasonable" belief can be derived not from social science, clinical psychology, or philosophical dialectics, but from the rhetorical tradition stemming from Aristotle. Actually, Clifford seems to point in this direction when he writes, No one man's belief is . . . a private matter which concerns himself alone. Our lives are guided by that generai conception of the course of things which has been created by society for social purposes.11 I will assume that actions that tend to harm the interests of others are prima fade immoral, and should prima fade be restricted by society, without trying to defìne "harm," "interest," or "im- moral."12 (I will also leave aside the difficult issue of actions causing harm only to oneself.) I will assume that belief s about justice and social groups are sufficiently voluntary that we can rightly be held responsible for them. This seems reasonable, since such belief s rest on évidence toward which each person must take up an attitude of acceptance, rejection, or something in between. I will not be con- cerned with whether the belief s are true or false, but with whether the act of belie ving them is reasonable or unreasonable in the circum- stances. (In this sensé, two persons who believe the same proposi- tion, p, for différent reasons hâve différent beliefs.)</page><page sequence="4">MORALLY UNTENABLE BELIEFS 171 Finally, I will not assume that beliefs judged to be "untenable" - both unreasonable and probably harmful to others - should there- fore be restricted by society using coercive methods like censorship or "brainwashing." Just as the social cost of preventing harmful actions by enforcing législation against them may be too high - ail mistreatment of children by their parents, for example, or ail unnec- essary abortions - it may well be that society should resort to coer- cion of belief only in extreme c^ses of imminent serious harm, and use persuasive means like éducation and public opinion in ail other cases. To say a belief is immoral is not necessarily to say it should be prevented at ail costs. But to say that people have a generai right of freedom of religion, for example, is also not necessarily to say that this right cannot be abused. It is important, I think, for philosophers to try to establish thè principle by which some beliefs can be judged morally untenable, even if there are good reasons for enforcing this principle as sparingly as possible. II. A Rhetorical Criterion of Reasonable Belief Aristotle's art of rhetoric differed from that of the "sophists" who preceded him in being normative rather than simply prag- matic. Gorgias had defined rhetoric as the art of persuasion of an audience to accept any conclusion, without regard to its truth, by means of language.13 He had compared the effect of skillful words on the mind to that of a drug, bypassing or numbing the rational, criticai part of the mind, so that the rhetor could instill whatever belief he wanted.14 This same conception of "persuasion" was de- veloped by Hitler in Mein Kampf, and is assumed in many propa- ganda and advertising manuals today. Aristotle, however, thought it seriously underestimated thè reasoning power of the average audience, and that the effects of such persuasion would be short- lived;.to really change the beliefs of the listener, the rhetor must appeal directly to his intellect, and show him that the proposition in question is worthy of belief But he often cannot use scientific (or "demonstrative") arguments to do this, as Socrates and Piato had tried to do, because (1) scientific knowledge is often unavail- able in the issues people argue about, and (2) even when it is available, there is not enough time to prepare the audience to accept it. So the rhetor must aim at plausibility: what a given audience should accept, given their assumptions and limitations of time and access to évidence.15 The rhetor may be "successful" in</page><page sequence="5">172 RICHARD J. BURKE thè short run without being genuinely persuasive; and he may make a "good case" for his position without converting his audi- ence. A genuinely plausible argument gives a good reason for its conclusion, which may nevertheless be false. Το make this distinc- tion clearer, Aristotle devotes two chapters of the Rhetoric to ex- amples of each. Book II, chapter 23 is a list of twenty-eight genu- ine enthy mêmes; that is, Unes of argument that a rhetorician should use (when appropriate) because one of them may well be the strongest argument available in the circumstances, for exam- ple: analogy to a similar case (#10), the prior décision of an author- ity (#11), good or bad conséquences of the proposed action (#13), if two results are the same their antécédents must hâve been the same (#17), the motives people might hâve for doing the action in question (#20), if the cause is présent the effect must be présent (#24). He knows that the assumptions of thèse arguments are not necessarily true, but they are plausible: we all make them in every- day life. In chapter 24 he gives nine "spurious" or "sophistical" enthy- memes, which should never be used because they are not really plausible, although they may seem so to the careless. Again, a few examples: asserting of the whole of something what is true of its parts, or vice versa (#2); the use of indignant language (#3); representing what is accidentai as if it were essential (#5); if B happened after A, it must have been because of A (#7). The différence between the two lists is illustrated nicely in #9 of the second, "pseudo-probability". A weakling may plausibly défend himself against a charge of assaulting a larger man by pointing to its intrinsic improbability. If a larger man is charged with assault, however, he must not argue that he was unlikely to do it just because people would think he was likely to do it! Even if he did not do it, and this was in fact his reason for not doing it, the argument is not plausible. In the second group there is no logicai connection between prem- ises and conclusion, and no common-sense assumption that would establish such a connection. Some of them are verbal or syntactical tricks, others are appeals to émotion rather than reason. While one of them might well work with a given audience, it would be an insuit to the intelligence of the audience, and unworthy of the rhetorician's art. Aristotle was keenly aware that Greek democ- racy, which he gener ally supported, presupposed the rationality of the average man. His Rhetoric, along with his Politics, should be</page><page sequence="6">MORALLY UNTENABLE BELIEFS 173 read as a justification of this assumption against both the elitism of Piato and the cynicism of many sophists. As an example of this normative concept of rhetoric as a crite- rion of reasonable belief, consider belief in a personal God based on some version of the argument from "design": thè universe con- tains too much artful design to hâve corne about by chance, so there must be an Artful Designer. Most modem philosophers since Hume and Kant regard this argument as circular and therefore worthless; but most ordinary people in our society, including reli- gious and cultural authorities, still accept it. The existence of a personal God would thus be a reasonable premise of rhetorical arguments in our society by Aristotle's criterion, not just because most people in fact still accept it, but because the reasons for not accepting it are accessible only to the small minority who hâve studied modem philosophy. Now consider the still-widespread unreflective belief that God is an elderly white maie with a beard, who lives somewhere among the stars. This belief is not plausible, because the reasons for not accept- ing it are accessible upon ordinary reflection. We would say of an adult who accepts it today - but not of a European of the twelfth Century - that he ought to know better. An argument based on this premise ought not to be persuasive in modem America. Believing what "people like me" generally believe, including ac- ceptance of whatever authorities are generally accepted in my "réf- érence group,"16 is perfectly reasonable when it would be impossi- ble, or asking too much of an ordinary person, to investigate the matter further. Such prima facie reasonableness is often the best we can do with our limited time and resources. But we must be on our guard against patently specious arguments, and we must accept responsibility for the belief s we take ο ver from those around us. A normative-rhetorical criterion of reasonableness like this is located between sociological fact (whatever people in a given com- munity generally believe) and philosophical or scientific truth or probability (what is supported by the best available évidence and analysis). Such a criterion is relative to time, place, and culture, but not "subjective": it makes sensé to say of a given belief that it is widely accepted, but should not be, because it is not really plausi- ble in that Community.17 such a criterion is necessarily vague, which would be a serious problem if I were advocating censorship of implausible belief s, but may not prevent its usefulness for ethi- cal évaluation.</page><page sequence="7">174 RICHARD J. BURKE Let us see whether "plausibility" thus defined is a useful concept for evaluating potentially harmful moral, politicai, and religious beliefs. First, consider the belief of sixteenth Century Aztecs and Incas that human sacrifice is pleasing to the gods. This practice was certainly harmful to its victims, and the belief caused the practice. But was it an unreasonable belief? Presumably it was accepted by everyone in both communities, even the victims, and especially all the authorities. It was integral to their culture; there was no way to question it without undermining their whole understanding of the order of things.18 Even if modern science and philosophy could show somehow that the belief is false, or probably false, or that their culture as a whole was morally inferior to ours, we would hâve to concede that the belief was plausible to them, and thus morally blameless by the normative-rhetorical criterion. Now suppose a group of modem Americans forms a déviant sect of Christianity advocating human sacrifice, perhaps based on the story of Abraham and Isaac in the Bible.19 Are we constrained by this criterion to exonerate them likewise? Not necessarily: the cru- cial question would be, What is their community? Within the sect itself, the rhetorical situation is like that of the Aztecs and Incas: everyone, including the authorities, accepts the belief. But they also know, as the Aztecs and Incas could not, that they are deviat- ing from the interprétation of the Bible by many générations of Christian, Jewish, and Muslim scholars and theologians. Without some plausible explanation of the amazing fact that everyone for 3,000 years misunderstood thè story of Abraham and Isaac until they came along, their position would be implausible; and even before they put their belief into practice (by killing their first-born sons), we could condemn the belief as both unreasonable and po- tentially harmful. Their awareness that they are deviating from a long tradition makes them also members of a much larger commu- nity, and créâtes an additional bürden of justification which (we are supposing) they dogmatically refuse to take up, and which they could not possibly fulfill. This concept of a "larger community" représente an important expansion of Aristotelian rhetorical theory. Aristotle's rhetoric was an art of persuading particular audiences in particular places and times, with particular beliefs and values. Improvements in communication technology hâve steadily increased the size of the audience that a "speaker" can address. The spread of writing en- abled future générations to "hear" the arguments of a Parmenides</page><page sequence="8">MORALLY UNTENABLE BELIEFS 175 or a Socrates, as Piato already realized.20 The invention of the printing press and translations into vernacular languages enabled any literate European to read the Bible for himself , transforming the nature of Christianity.21 And modem newspapers, radio, and télévision hâve revolutionized our rhetorical situation again by creating a "global village."22 People with access to thèse media, which today means nearly everyone in the world, now belong not only to their local communities but also to the world community. Arguments that were persuasive when their hearers were unaware of alternatives can become less so when their audience is virtually universal. For a civilized person today, this means that he must be prepared to justify his beliefs to anyone else. In this way, he is obliged to participate in the formation of a single Worldwide com- munity, through dialogue about différences rather than imposition by force.23 This may be an impossible goal to reach, due to cultural and social différences, but we are obliged to try, because the re- fusai of dialogue is the beginning of violence. The rhetorical and ethical significance of the "universal audi- ence" has been formulated most clearly by C. Perelman and L. Olbrechts-Tyteca in their The New Rhetoric: A Theory of Argumen- tation (1958). w When a speaker addresses an audience orally on a particular occasion - the situation envisioned by Aristotle through- out his Rhetoric - his "available means of persuasion" include not only his argument, but his own réputation (ethos) and the emo- tional mood (pathos) of his audience, perhaps induced by récent events or by the previous speaker(s). With the enlargement of the audience through writing and other media of communication, how- ever, cornes a greater distance between speaker and audience in space and time, and a correspondingly greater emphasis on the speaker's words themselves (logos) rather than his character or the mood of the audience. He may stili have a "target audience" in mind, sharing certain beliefs and values, but he cannot assume that they will be in any particular emotional mood, nor that they know him personally, so he must construct an argument addressed to anyone having those beliefs and values. At the limit, this potential audience becomes "the whole of man- kind, or at least of ail normal, adult persons."25 The "common- sense" beliefs appealed to must now be those generated by the human condition itself , not by idiosyncratic local or temporal condi- tions. Appeals to the self-interest of one group at the expense of others will be seen for what they are: rationalization or "ideology"</page><page sequence="9">176 RICHARD J. BURKE rather than genuine argument. The resuit of this process, when successful, is so différent from ad hoc persuasion that Perelman and Olbrechts-Tyteca suggest that we use a différent word for it: "convic- tion."26 They argue that there are two distinct types of rhetoric corresponding to these two purposes, and most of their magisterial treatise is devoted to thè various "commonplaces" (topoi) of rheto- ric aimed at "thè universal audience." Wider agreement does not guarantee approximation to truth, of course: thè rapid spread of materialistic values in thè twentieth Century, for example, does not imply any deeper wisdom. But it does increase thè potential for rational dialogue, and thè bürden of rational argument on those who dissent from the consensus. Indeed, it may seem that rhetoric aimed at uthe universal audi- ence" is indistinguishable from philosophical dialectic (see above), and that Perelman and Olbrechts-Tyteca apparently want to col- lapse this distinction. But while thè gap has certainly been nar- rowed, there is stili a significant différence between arguments addressed to the beliefs and values of the average person and those addressed by a philosopher to other philosophers, as a glance at any professional philosophical journal will show. It is not just that philosophy is normally written in very abstract language; ever since the Pre-Socratics, it has not aimed to satisfy "common sensé" at all, not even the "common sensé" of ail mankind. Like science (from which it was not distinguished until the nineteenth Century), it has aimed not at persuasion, not even at generai "conviction," but at knowledge. Perelman and Olbrechts-Tyteca themselves bring out the crucial point: Agreement of the universal audience . . . refers, of course, not to an experimentally proven fact, but to a universality and unanim- ity imagined by the speaker . . ,27 Everyone constitutes the universal audience from what he knows of his fellow men, in such a way as to transcend the few oppositions he is aware of. Each individuai, each culture, has thus its own conception of the universal audience.28 The "universal audience," then, always reflects the assumptions of a particular time and place. This is why it is a rhetorical rather than an epistemic concept. But an important distinction can be drawn between those who honestly try to persuade "anyone" of the validity of their beliefs, and those who refuse to engage in</page><page sequence="10">MORALLY UNTENABLE BELIEFS 177 dialogue with those who disagree with them. An excellent illustra- tion of this différence may be found in Plato's Gorgias. When Callicles enters the discussion about the nature of rhetoric with a combination of ad hominem abuse of Socrates and transparent rationalization, Socrates, instead of pointing this out, says: If there is any point on which you and I both agrée, Callicles, we may regard it as sufficiently tested, and never again hâve to submit it to further proof. For you could not have conceded it through either a failure in wisdom or an excess of modesty; nor through a wish to deceive me, for you have said that you are my friend. Any agreement between the two of us must bear the stamp oftruth.29 In spite of his irony, Socrates welcomes the opportunity to de- bate with Callicles, because their assumptions about the world are so différent that if they agrée about a conclusion, the facts them- selves must have forced it upon them! How many of us would react to such a challenge in this way? Later, when Callicles' position has been shown to be incohérent and he quits the discussion with angry threats, Socrates continues the dialogue by himself for four pages, taking first Callicles' part and then his own by turns, until he is satisfied that the logic of both positions has been fully revealed.30 Socrates' own position is hardly "universal" - it reflects the assumptions of ancient Greek medi- cine, for example - but the contrast between him and Callicles as models of argumentation could not be more dramatic. The modem rhetorical criterion of tenability for social beliefs, then, is this: a belief is tenable insofar as it is judged reasonable by the "universal audience," or the believer is willing to honestly try to persuade (his version of ) that audience of its validity. Perhaps not all our beliefs need to be justified in this way; but at least those that tend to produce actions harmful to thè interests of others must be. Since the criterion is in terms of communication, it is the beliefs themselves th^t must be judged, and not just the resulting actions. Now let us look at a few actual cases of potentially harmful contemporary beliefs. While the belief of the Nazis that Jews, Gypsies, and other "human vermin" should be destroyed may have been shared by quite a few Europeans in the 1930s, it was strongly condemned by the wider consensus of mankind at that time. Since the Nazis and their supporters were part of that larger Community, and perfectly aware of the near-universal rejection by</page><page sequence="11">178 RICHARD J. BURKE everyone not subject to their politicai power, they could not daim that their belief was intrinsically plausible. They were not an iso- lated Community like thè Aztecs or Incas. The same is true of terror- ists, whether in Lebanon, Irei and, or Sri Lanka, who believe that they are justifìed in killing innocent people to cali attention to their cause. However justifìed their ends may be, their choice of means is clearly rejected by the conscience of mankind; they cannot simply ignore this fact. And those South African whites who insist that God wants the races of mankind to be kept "apart," with whites retaining a monopoly on power and wealth, ought to know as Christians and heirs of Western civilization that their belief is regarded as transpar- ently self-serving by the rest of the world, including virtually all other Christians. It is their intransigence in thè face of this wider consensus that makes their position untenable. I want to emphasize that it is the beliefs of the white South Africans, not just their behavior, that are condemned by world opinion. If we look at Worldwide behavior, we find violations of human rights everywhere, and not least in the nations that pro- claim the principle of equality the loudest. Belief in the justice of the apartheid System départs much more from accepted norms of belief than the practice does from accepted norms of behavior. If whites in South Africa were to say, "We realize that blacks are disadvantaged in our society; we are doing our best to correct this, but we fear that the process will take a long time," the attitude of the rest of the world would change dramatically. If they really seemed to be "doing their best," and there were some signs of progress, I suspect that the world would re-accept white South Africans as partners in the struggle against injustice. It is not so much their practice, then, that sets them apart, as their stubborn irtsistence that the beliefs of the rest of mankind about blacks and justice are simply wrong or irrelevant. Likewise, the belief of many Muslims that Salman Rushdie de- serves death for Publishing his "blasphemous" novel, The Satanic Verses, flies in thè face of international opinion.31 Article 19 of the Universal Déclaration of Human Rights, approved by the General Assembly of the U.N. in 1948, reads: Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interférence and to seek, receive, and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers.</page><page sequence="12">MORALLY UNTENABLE BELIEFS 179 Muslims are by no means alone in regarding blasphemy as a serìous sin,32 and in feeling a need to respond strongly to a pub- lic insuit to one's honor. In any tribal society, from thè locai schoolyard to Sicily, while one may be free to speak his mind, if he uses that freedom to publicly insult someone else he must be prepared to take thè conséquences. Not to respond at ali, or to respond by saying "You are mistaken, sir, but you are entitled to your opinion," would be to suffer a spécifie kind of harm, called "loss of face." In that sense, it could be argued that Rushdie's book is harmful to believing Muslims, and he therefore had no right to publish it. Indeed, it might be thought that thè rhetorical criterion I am proposing for moral belief forces me to accept this argument. But if "freedom of expression" means anything, it must include freedom to say things that some people find offensive, even deeply offensive, without fear of violent repercussions. So thè principle expressed in Article 19 must mean that people ail over the world - but not all people, obviously - hâve reached the conclusion that tribal ethics must be transcended by impersonal judicial procé- dures if we are ever to hâve world peace. This conclusion was expressed by Aeschylus in the Oresteia in 458 b.c., and by Shake- speare in his Romeo and Juliet, and it has now become the consen- sus of the enlightened portion of mankind. Accordingly , I consider the position of the Ayatollah Khomeini to be morally untenable, however many devoted followers he may hâve, and whether or not his death sentence on Rushdie is actually carried out. Does this mean that moral truth is whatever the majority of a community happens to believe? Not at all. Social condemnation of certain belief s does not presuppose that they are false, as John Stuart Mill thought,33 but only that they are both unreasonable and harmful. Majority opinion is neither necessary nor sufficient for plausibility. The majority may be fooled by "spurious enthy- memes." And we cannot require unanimity, but only widespread agreement of those who are reasonably informed about the issue. As Perelman and Olbrechts-Tyteca remark, One can always resort to "disqualifying the récalcitrant" by classi- fying him as stupid or abnormal. [But] there can only be adhérence to this idea of excluding individuals from the human community if the number and intellectual value of those banned are not so high as to make such a procedure ridiculous.34</page><page sequence="13">180 RICHARD J. BURKE To round out thè picture, let me give some examples of beliefs that would not be condemned by thè criteria I have proposed, either because they are not clearly potentially harmful to others, or be- cause there is not sufficient consensus that they are implausible. Belief in God, no matter how implausibly anthropomorphic (above, p. 173), does not seem to have any harmful effects; indeed, it may well bring consolation to many unsophisticated believers, and moti- vate them to be more moral in their behavior toward others. The same may be said of belief in astrology, ESP, reincarnation, or that we are being visited by benign beings from other planets. However improbable such beliefs may be by thè standards of modern science, and however implausible by thè current rhetorical consensus, their apparent harmlessness makes any attempi by society to discourage them unjustified. Other beliefs are clearly potentially harmful to some people, but too controversial among even well-informed and impartial inquir- ers to be judged implausible. One example of this, I think, is thè belief that homosexuality is a perversion or a form of mental ill- ness, despite thè fact that psychological and medicai authorities now regard this idea as without scientific foundation. Other exam- ples would be belief in thè necessity of capital punishment for certain crimes, and belief that purveyors of pornography should be put in jail. Whatever thè best available évidence may indicate on thèse issues, thè beliefs in question are too widespread to meet thè rhetorical test of implausibility, and debate should continue until a genuine social consensus émerges, if it e ver will. There will be many intermediate cases, of course, in which ei- ther thè potential harmfulness or thè plausibility of beliefs is hard to determine. Does belief in thè reality of thè Devii, with its corol- lary that certain people are "his" and must not be reasoned or compromised with, qualify? According to a 1978 Gallup poli, this belief is stili widespread in thè U.S. (40%), but this number is dropping, and is already much lower than thè 95% who say they believe in God.35 Perhaps belief in "agents of Satan" will soon be implausible as well as potentially harmful by the rhetorical crite- rion. Such uncertainty would be a serious problem if I were recom- mending concerted social restrictions on belief. As an ethical issue, however, one may say that beliefs constitute irresponsible behav- ior insofar as they are both implausible and harmful to others, and leave the matter to individuai consciences to decide.</page><page sequence="14">MORALLY UNTENABLE BELIEFS 181 III. Conclusion Society cannot force its members to change their beliefs by pass- ing laws, or even by attaching électrodes to their heads. But society can and does influence the beliefs of its members: by éducation, by culture, by active and passive encouragement and discouragement of ideas. American society encourages bizarre religious beliefs, some of them dangerous,36 by its toleration of absurdity in this area. South African society has persuaded even some of its blacks that they cannot exercise power responsibly. Many women hâve been persuaded by their societies that they do not deserve equal rights with men. If society has this much power over the beliefs of its members, it must accept responsibility for the results. How that responsibility should be exercised is a very large question. But it is not a new question, just part of the old question about the right use of politicai power. Which beliefs deserve to be discour aged by society, and the best ways of doing this, should be part of the continuing dialogue about politics. Traditional liberalism holds that while actions affecting the inter- ests of others should be regulated by society, each individuai has the right to believe whatever he likes, especially on matters of morality, politics, and religion. This sharp séparation between ac- tions and beliefs in ethical-social theory is supported by three con- sidérations: (1) beliefs cannot harm anyone; (2) we hâve no firm epistemic criteria for the truth or falsity of beliefs in the areas of morality, politics, and religion; and (3) in any case, society cannot control the beliefs of its members. I hâve argued that, on the contrary (1) some beliefs, especially on matters of morality, poli- tics, and religion, produce actions harmful to groups believed to be inferior or evil; (2) the relevant criterion for social évaluation of beliefs is not epistemic truth or probability but rhetorical "plausibil- ity"; and (3) social régulation of belief by encouragement and discouragement should be effective enough. Libérais must concentrate on keeping the dialogue about moral, politicai, and religious beliefs open; but they should not hesitate to condemn beliefs that hâve been rejected by the consensus of impar- tial inquirers, especially when the believers refuse to give accept- able reasons for them, and when they tend to cause actions harm- ful to others. Such beliefs are as immoral as the actions they cause, even though society has good reasons for using only persuasion,</page><page sequence="15">182 RICHARD J. BURKE and not coercion, against them. The liberal tradition has erred in thinking that belief s are outside thè scope of ethical évaluation. Department of Philosophy Oakland University Notes 1.
