<plain_text><page sequence="1">John Covert's Studios in 1916 and 1923: Two Views into the Past MICHAEL KLEIN With the recent exhibition of the art of John Covert (1882- 1960) at the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden,1 the work of this Pittsburgh-born artist is currently receiving more attention than was the case at the time of the abandonment of his avant-garde career in 1923.2 Because Covert's known oeuvre is small and since a number of his works were apparently lost or destroyed in 1923 or thereafter,3 five surviving photographs of Covert's studios in 1916 and 1923 comprise the only remain- ing record of a substantial portion of his artistic production. They provide, moreover, fascinating glimpses into his other activities and into his working habits. Fitted together with what little remains of what the artist said, as well as with his known i~fis Fig. 1. Covert's studio in New York City in 1916, left view. works and additional pertinent documents, these photographs assume critical importance in augmenting our knowledge of Covert's art and personality. The first two photographs are of Covert's studio at 20 West 31st Street4 in Manhattan in 1916 (Figs. 1, 2). They can be assigned to that year because of the presence of Temptation of St. Anthony directly behind Covert (Fig. 1), a painting that was signed and dated 1916.5 The dramatic juxtaposition of this Cubist-Dadaist picture on the easel with the traditional aca- demic nudes on the walls behind it attests to the artist's rapid transition to a new style, and reflects the impact of the remark- able personalities and works of modern art with which Covert ( Fig. 2.

Finally, the two photographs reveal the expansive, gleeful mood of the artist, as he joyfully participated in the surge of modernism in New York, both as artist and administrator. The next three photographs were taken at the conclusion of Covert's most intensive period of modernist creation, almost certainly just prior to his abandonment of full-time painting in the summer of 1923 (Figs. 3, 4, 5).'0 Probably taken by the artist himself with his own camera," they suggest a distinctly differ- ent mood. The studio is empty and desolate, lacking the jovial feeling of seven years earlier. Another more important difference concerns Covert's work- ing procedure. In 1916, despite his conversion to modernism, he still painted with brushes and a palette on a traditional canvas on an easel. By 1923, he was working on an almost horizontally placed table and using a small hammer, a hack- saw, and even a celluloid triangle as well as brushes. A quote from Covert's remarks to Rudi Blesh about his transformation into a modernist is relevant: "I was a carpenter, upholsterer, painter-what have you."12 No later than 1919, Covert was usually employing composi- tion board instead of canvas13 and was cutting and nailing his own frames to these surfaces. Above all, he was producing collages, in which he attached cords (Brass Band),14 dowels and half rounds (Vocalization, Fig. 6) and upholstery tacks (Time, Fig. 7)15 to the surfaces of his compositions. Undoubt- edly the slightly slanted table facilitated his new manner of working as well as disclosing his changed conception of his artistic role: he was as much a constructor of objects as a painter. Henry McBride provided a tantalizingly brief description of Covert's materials and techniques in his review of the artist's one-man show at the De Zayas Gallery in April and May, 1920.1' He [Covert] goes into cubism deeply. Like Picasso, if he happens to feel it to be cement, he acknowledges it on the picture in real cement. In fact, Mr. Covert's muse is at home in what most artists would consider the unlikeliest materials. Some of the panels have rows of small objects resembling corks glued all over them and the painting is done upon them: others may have the strips of molding beneath the glaze, as it were, and still others appear to have been achieved upon boiler iron with the rivets left in. These various textures prevent the artist [from] dropping into perfunctory habits.l7 What works "have rows of small objects resembling corks glued all over them" is difficult to say, but the "strips of molding" may be the wooden dowels and half rounds in constructions like Vocalization. Moreover, the "rivets" placed upon "boiler iron" may refer to the tacks on Covert's construction Time. If so, this assemblage originally would have had a distinctly metallic appearance. Returning to the photographs, a glance at the studio alerts one to the diversity of Covert's oeuvre, which ranged from academic nudes and portraits to advanced collages and abstrac- tions. Of the 39 works in the room, 24 are still extant,'8 and several more are either partially hidden by other pictures or FALL 1979 23</page><page sequence="3">A? Mor 4a. O.A.M., - V. X? Mg, IX. Fig. 6.

Some of the most interesting of these can be examined here. Before considering these lost works, however, it will be necessary to assess the accuracy of the photographs as sources of visual information. Their clarity can be measured by com- paring an extant construction, Vocalization, which appears in the photographs of the studio (Fig. 4) with the original.

Vocalization were lost, careful observation of the shadows under the dowels and half rounds would lead one strongly to suspect that small, three-dimensional objects had been placed on its surface. This knowledge of the degree of visual sensitivity of the photos can be applied elsewhere. For example, in the upper left on the same wall, there is a dark painting that appears to be a landscape (Figs. 3, 8). It has three dark undu- lating lines-probably trees-in the right foreground and a horizontal band of light in the distance. Its composition thus recalls the basic format of Covert's Landscape with Three Trees (Fig. 9). Yet the surface of this lost landscape is not smooth; it rather seems completely covered with small, round bumps. Since Covert placed small upholstery tacks on his construction 24 ART JOURNAL, XXXIX/1</page><page sequence="4">Time, we can suggest a "reconstruction": it is a landscape painted over a surface of upholstery tacks. Another composition worth noting (Figs. 5, 10) is an area of one photograph where the detail is extremely fine, since even the sprocket holes in the film hanging beneath this picture are visible. The work itself contains a complex shape that has been subdivided into sections that are subtly varied in tone from white through grey to dark. Unlike the abstract forms in the upper portion of the shape, the lower part resembles a face in three-quarter view, with a beard and bent nose. This face is derived from the head of Nicodemus-which is also a self- portrait-in Michelangelo's late Pieta (Fig. 11). The Michelan- gelo prototype can also partly explain the abstract "headdress" in Covert's picture as an elaboration of the high, draped hood over the head of Nicodemus. In this lost picture Covert merges modern, abstract forms with a reference to a great 16th-century sculpture and sculptor. Such combinations of the contemporary and the traditional occur in other works by Covert, including his Temptation of St. Anthony and Leda and the Swan. " One of the most intriguing pictures in the studio is a vaguely organic abstraction on the upper right of the main wall (Figs. 5, 12). Its configuration of curving shapes is akin to those of such paintings as From Word to Object (Fig. 13). In contrast to this known work, however, where Covert fused the linear simplifi- cation of Jugendstil and Art Nouveau with Cubist spatial am- biguities, the lost painting contains modeled, sculptural shapes. There is a smooth, spherical form in the lower right of the picture. Pressing against this balloon-like shape is another, more complex and anthropomorphic form. It is made up of two main parts, an upper portion or "head," with three lobes on its right side, which could be a forehead, nose and cheek area, and a long "neck," with a curved crease in its upper left, and a rim at its base.

These features bring to mind the art of Brancusi. For instance, the spherical form is similar to the radically reduced egg shapes in the Rumanian artist's Newborn and his Sculpture for the Blind, both of which were acquired in 1922 by John Quinn,20 the distinguished New York lawyer and daring collector of modern art, who knew both Duchamp and Arensberg.21 And the taste for subtly modeled, bulbous masses and elegantly curving edges in the central shape of Covert's painting recalls similar elements in sculptures like Brancusi's Muse (Fig. 14) or his Madame Pogany I (Fig. 15). Quinn owned versions of both these works by 1918.22 Indeed, the Madame Pogany I, possess- ing a domed head, small mouth, rounded eyes and a love of interplaying curves, is close to the arrangement of lines in From Word to Object. Moreover, Covert's knowledge of the Madame Pogany I goes far to explain the origin of the strangely pointed left shoulder in this painting. This unusual feature could have been derived from the folded hands that move diagonally below the jaw, reaching a point above the level of the eyes. Even the diagonal line that traverses the breast of the figure could have come from the cleft between the two hands in the Madame Pogany I. Just below the lost work that reflects and transforms the style of Brancusi, there is one more painting that is now lost (Figs. 5, 12). This picture consists of two egg shapes that are placed in a vertical position, side by side. But unlike the organic shapes in the painting above it, there appears to be something in- scribed on the surface of these "eggs"; or possibly these "shells" are transparent membranes, so that we can observe what is inside them. In any case, they can be identified and described with considerable precision. On the right the hair, face, and crossed arms of a small, doll-like figure are discernible. At the base of this "egg," there is a long arc parallel to the round lower edge, which has the soft, organic, even fleshy appearance of an abdomen. The doll or baby may therefore be an embryo within a transparent womb. On the left "egg" there appears the head of a figure, which seems to be wrapped in swaddling clothes or FALL 1979 25</page><page sequence="5">.......... Fig. 12.

There are echoes here of Covert's Water Babies (Fig. 12, upper left)23 where two small dolls stand side by side, one of them in a transparent glass.

The main shape was based on a photograph of a female nude (Fig. 17).24 The figure has been simplified in the painting: its arms and legs do not-appear; the shoulders have been narrowed and the base widened to stress the spread of feminine hips. Despite the reduction of the body to an elemental form, some anatomical details have been emphasized, such as the muscles that extend along the sides of the spine. Yet the transformation of the figure in the photo- graph has essentially reduced it to a pear shape; significantly, ;: i~--o-s ::_i~ii -ii~i: ~i: i - -- i iiiiiiiixZi- Fig. 18.

Philadelphia Museum of Art, Louise and Walter Arensberg Collection. Covert exhibited a picture at the De Zayas Gallery in 1920 entitled Pears,25 which may be tentatively connected to the painting in Covert's studio. Turning to the tall painting on the left side of the left wall (Figs. 3, 18) next to an early Self Portrait by Covert,26 we find a FALL 1979 27</page><page sequence="7">picture containing an upper and lower grouping of forms, attached to each other by a long dark line, thicker above and thinner below. One can perhaps only speculate on the nature of the upper half of the work, but the shape in the lower section may be compared to Morton Schamberg's Mechanical Abstraction (Fig. 19), a painting that was hanging in the Arens- berg apartment by 1918.27 The two pictures consist of a mixture of rounded, mechanical parts, tonally graded from light to dark, although Schamberg's forms remain flat on the surface and are made up of more sharp right angles and precise, straight con- tours, whereas the shapes in the lower portion of Covert's work are comparatively sculptural and relatively soft, even slightly rubbery and organic in appearance. The careful study of these photographs of Covert's studios in 1916 and 1923 has uncovered a richer stylistic variety in the artist's oeuvre than has previously been supposed from his extant work. However, any comparison with the originals only heightens our awareness of the limitations of these pale, mon- ochromatic images of Covert's studios in providing a picture of what the real works looked like. It is to be hoped that this article will help to encourage a further search for additional examples of works by this important American modernist. 0 1.
