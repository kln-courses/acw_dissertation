<plain_text><page sequence="1">NICOLAI HARTMANN'S CRITICISM OF KANT'S THEORY iOF KNOWLEDGE1 Early in life, Nicolai Hartmann was a representative of logicistic Neo-Kantianism, but as early as I9I5 he began his apostasy from the tenets of Marburg. So strong was the Kantian influence and so strong has it remained, however, that opposing Kant was no easy task for Hartmann as it had been, unfortunately, for those realists who did not think Kant worth the trouble of attentive read- ing. Thus, instead of ignoring Kant and instead of attacking him outright and from the ground up, it was Hartmann's difficult task to say precisely where he thought Kant was in error. It would not be far wrong to say that every one of his books is, in a degree, an Auseinan- dersetzung with the Kantian philosophy. He has given an outline of a book on Kant "which must be written, and which I see as a task for our time, but which I myself shall not write."2 And no one has been in a better position than Hartmann to give such directions, not only because of his unsurpassed learning in the letter of Kant's text and his old sympathy with the critical philosophy, but even more because he does not fall under the ban by which all metaphysicians have been "ceremoniously and officially suspender from their occupations"3 until they can answer the question as to how synthetical judgments a prior are possible-for Hartmann, almost unique among modern realists, has attempted to meet this question. That Hartmann has discovered many weak points in Kant's philo- sophy cannot be denied. That he has cogently argued for the inevit- ability of many of those difficulties which have been pointed out by others, by showing how they are rooted in Kantian fundamentals and are not due, as many have hoped, to mere carelessness of expression- neither can that be denied. But no exposition of these points is needed; it would be indeed presumptions for another writer to undertake to defend Hartmann or even to give another exposition of his views when Hartmann himself is so convincing in his own argument and so well able to deal with all who disagree with him. And if the writer mentions Hartmann's specific arguments only to disagree with them, that is no sign of lack of sympathy with or respect for those positions which are not mentioned. 1.

THE PROBLEM OF STANDPOINTS The subtitle of Hartmann's Kantgesellschaft lecture of I922, "Diesseits von Idealismus und Realismus," reads, "A Contribution to the Differentiation of the Historical and Transhistorical in the Kantian Philosophy." This indicates accurately the form of Hartmann's treat- ment; it is not critical in the sense that it marks a complete renunciation of Kantianism, but rather in that Hartmann is interested in distilling out of Kantianism that which is of lasting value and thus free from the limitations of Kant's standpoint in history. The "historical" and the "transhistorical" in this study refer to the same elements in the works of a philosopher which Hartmann has distinguished respectively as the "systematic" and the "aporetic" moments in philosophical con- struction. "Whatever in philosophy in transhistorical," he says,4 "must necessarily be above all standpoints." "Arbitrary presuppositions," such as idealism and dogmatic realism, are always standpunktlich.5 The standpoint, as such, always determines a system, because its acceptance by a philosopher means that all problems will be dealt with from a previously assumed perspective, which will sometimes involve distortion or force the philosopher to do violence to a particular problem so that its solution can be brought into a harmonious whole whose structure has been decided upon in advance. Thus when Hartmann distinguishes between the historical and the transhistorical in Kant, he means to dis- tinguish between the systematic and the aporetic, or between the con- structional and the "phenomenological" (in his very broad usage of this latter term). With reference to Kant himself, that means that he will search out those parts of his philosophy which are determined by Kant's "arbitrary assumption" of transcendental idealism, reject them because they are "historical" and systematic, leaving the rest of the philosophy as a result of the pre-suppositionless aporetic or phenomenological method which bases itself solely on the temporary "standpoint" which the specific and single problem and the present phenomena afford. This resulting philosophy will be a fund of phenomena which have no specific reference in themselves to their function in Kant's actual systematization." But there are several questionable points in this ideal. First, a 4. "Diesseits," p. 162. 5. Ibid., p. 165. 6. Here is a noteworthy resemblance between the evaluations by Hartmann and by Ledger Wood ("The Dialectical Method," in The Heritage of Kant). Whether Hartmann specifically has influenced Wood I do not know; but it is a fact that many of Hartmann's opinions may be illustrated equally well by quotations from his own works or from Wood's essay.</page><page sequence="3">474 PHILOSOPHY AND PHENOMENOLOGICAL RESEARCH formal question may be asked. Can the aporetic method proceed with- out presuppositions? To be sure, there is a difference in method which is important; Hegel and Kant are sufficient proofs of this in themselves. But is the ideal of presuppositionlessness attainable, and even we may ask, is it meaningful? As to its attainability, perhaps only a history of the further refinements of phenomenology can decide. No one can claim, I think, that it has been attained, and Hartmann does not assert categorically that it has. One has to read only the first sentence of Hartmann's Metaphysik der Erkenntnis to see his presuppositions: "The following investigations proceed from the conception (Auffas- sung) that. . . ." It is well to have such suppositions on page I, but that does not make them any less of a presupposition. In Hartmann's case, this "presupposition" is that knowledge is a knowledge of some- thing independent, and further on he argues that his "standpoint" is not necessarily realism simply because it makes this supposition. The belief is not a "schlechtweg hingenommenes Vorurteil" but only a "vorgefundener Ausgangspunkt" which will be held only as long as it is adequate to the problem.7 The expressed readiness to give up the conception does not render it less of a presupposition, but it is only a confession of such a philosophical seriousness as a systematist like Hegel might make. In a word, it is difficult or impossible to see how, without a stand- point of some kind, any question could arise from a conflict of phenom- ena, how an Aporie could be acknowledged, or how any situation could be recognized as problematical. For why should the world "make sense"? Without presuppositions that it does, it is the most obvious thing that, prima facie, it does not. Only the general presupposition that a philosophy is possible, that the wonder and curiosity of the lover of wisdom can in some way be at least partially satisfied, makes it pos- sible for us to leave even for a moment the rhapsodic phenomena and to hunt for their "meaning." And to go a little further, there is a more specific and peculiar pre- supposition. (I call it, "peculiar" because it is less generally held than the first, which is the a priori beginning of all philosophizing.) It is that a systematic approach to philosophy must do violence to some of the problems it touches. Granted that there may be no such thing as a consistent and true system of philosophy, it does not follow that we should reject systematicity altogether, nor that we should, as Hartmann says we should, relegate systematic thinking to the end of the endless task; the antidote for bad systems is better systems, Hartmann is proud 7.

Here- after referred to as Metaphysik.</page><page sequence="4">NICOLAI HARTMANN'S CRITICISM OF KANT'S 475 THEORY OF KNOWLEDGE of his aporetic method because it does not look "longingly for results."' But this wise caution against enthusiastic haste in metaphysical specu- lation which would lead to some preconceived and uncriticized goal amounts to an actual fear of solution of problems in Hartmann's own thinking. To take some examples: Hartmann holds that all of Kant's antinomies are unresolvable because they involve a relation of phe- nomena to noumena, and this relation is "irrational." "All attempts to solve the antinomies are merely perspectival (standpunktlich) and artificial."9 And when idealism has an answer to the question of the relation of the subject to the object in a priori knowledge, Hartmann fears it because of its lack of mystery, its ease. "Idealism weakens the meaning of the thesis [that principles of the object are identical with those of the subject] since it takes the object into the subject, even though only into the transcendental. The identity of categories is then almost self-evident. But if one lets the object stand as real beyond the subject, even the transcendental, the whole burden of the difficulty falls to [the principle of] the identity of categories to bind the subject and object together as they are in a prior knowledge. That the identity of categories can do this constitutes its strength."'0 To object to a philosophical principle because it is "almost self-evident" is almost unique in the history of philosophy. Primna facie it would appear that Hartmann avoids the "almost self-evident" principle in order to show the strength of another interpretation, but this strength consists in overcoming difficulties avoided by Kant's own expression." Again, Hartmann's fear of solution leads him to say, "Ontology makes the attempt to assume the absolute minimum of hypothesis for the con- sideration of the philosophic problem. The criterion of its legitimacy lies in the question, how well does it succeed in taking up the irrational loose ends of problems into its insight and putting them in the place in the connection of the entire system, into which, in spite of their irresolvability it does introduce them? A closed rational system can never satisfy this demand. But an open system, which closes itself only beyond the limits of knowability, has within itself room for this 8. "Diesseits," p. 164. 9. Metaphysik, p. 233. lOi.bid., p. 187. Here the concept of "identity of categories" is introduced only as a part of a typical example of Hartmann's argumentation. It will be discussed in its own right in section iv, below. 11 That Kant avoids them will be shown later. Hartmann refers later to the objectivity of the Metaphysik as having been an ultima ratio to be defended in other ways. But the defense, as we shall see, is only of "gnoseological being," of the object as different from the subject in knowledge, and not of "ontological being," i.e. of real being without any dependence on the knowledge situation itself.</page><page sequence="5">476 PHILOSOPHY AND PHENOMENOLOGICAL RESEARCH possibility."'2 Examples could be multiplied indefinitely to show Hart- mann's fear that solution means rationalization.13 A more material objection can be made to Hartmann's own inter- pretation of what the Kantian "system" is. It is not too much, I think, to say that many of the views and emphases Hartmann attributes to Kant are largely Hartmann's own presuppositions which he is now for the first time rejecting. That is to say, the "Kantian system" Hartmann rejects is a Neo-Kantian system. Hartmann is, no doubt, quite correct in saying that there is in Kant a "decisive preponderance" of the apo- retic over the systematic tendency.14 After this is admitted, what is it that remains to be attacked? It is Kant's "systematic moment" of idealism, which is merely a historically conditioned vestige of rational- ism. But it is significant that this is the moment which is decisively preponderant in Marburg Neo-Kantianism. When Hlartmann denies the "systematic consistency" of the Kantian philosophy for the admitted presence of the thing itself, ought not his criticism perhaps be directed more at his own teachers than at Kant himself ? For have we any rea- son to believe that critical idealism is the proper name for Kant's ultimate philosophy? Marburg Neo-Kantianism could not, to be sure, admit the thing in itself without falling victim to Hartmann's attack, but that is because it was professedly an ultimate idealism. Hartmann sees in the thing in itself the "preeminently critical concept" in Kant15- but Kant had no very different opinion of it. Kant had a transcendental idealism, but it did not extend to the "noumenon in the negative under- standing"; nevertheless, the latter is still there. Does that then mean, 12. Metaphvsik, p. 306. "Ontology," in this sense, is largely a project, not a product. It is the "neutral" treatment of subject and object, and conceivably of mere appearance, as forms of being. As such a project, "It follows, as a matter of principle, only the problem, and allows only that to stand in the picture of the world which is demanded by the problem. It moves as little as possible away from the natural standpoint, and it preserves its point of view as far as it is valid. . . Its results must bear the stamp of some standpoint: its methods can remain this side of all standpoints and pre-decisions." (Ibid., pp. 179, 180.) Thus we may say that ontology, as understood in the passage quoted, is the "aporetic standpoint" itself, if such a term is permitted. Though the text is not always unambiguous in this point, it seems necessary to separate ontology in this sense from Hartmann's own substantive ontology, which is the system or science of the principles of being and which is largely realistic. 13. It is well to point out here the meanings of rationalization which may be confused in this attitude of Hartmann's: it may mean systematization (which is acceptable at the end, if it is possible); a renunciation of the irrational in its various senses (whose recognition as such constitutes the metaphysical problem of knowledge as Hartmann sees it, as he, by implication, describes his work as "eine Phanomenologie der Erkenntnis als Wesensanalyse des Metaphysischen im Erkenntnisphanomen"-Metaphysik, p. 36): or a false systematiza- tion, a "standpunctual" act of violence in an almost psychoanalytical sense. But that all systematic procedures are bad rationalizations in the last sense seems to be assumed by Hartmann without any grounds. 14. "Diesseits," p. 165. 15. Metaphysik, p. 220.</page><page sequence="6">NICOLAi HARTMANN'S CRITICISM OF KANT'S 477 THEORY OF KNOWLEDGE as Hartmann seems to believe, that Kant was not systematic, but aporetic? If Kant's ultimate systematic attempt was in the direction of idealism, we should have to agree with Hartmann that in this con- cept the problem triumphed over the system. But we have no right to say that Kant' ultimate system wvas transcendental or critical idealism. To be sure his "refutation of idealism" does not affect his transcen- dental idealism, but the immediately following chapters on the distinc- tion between noumena and phenomena would hardly have been written by a metaphysical idealist. Hartmann himself recognizes the possibility of a "systematic realism" in Kant."6 Nevertheless, this is precisely the form of criticism which a member of the Marburg school would be expected to make if he ever rejected "Kantianism." We should be very sure what it is which suffers from the attack. The critical philosophy as a whole does not; those parts of it which may be described as idealistic may-though this is a matter we shall have to discuss in greater detail later; but only a Kantianism which stops at the beginning of the dialectic, or a Neo- Kantianism which is wholly transcendental and idealistic will be utterly destroyed by Hartmann's argument concerning the necessary position of the "realistic" elements in Kant, if it prove successful. One more question of "standpoint" needs to be considered before we go into the details of Hartmann's criticism. Every age reads history and the historically significant in terms of its own needs and interests. When we separate the historical from the lasting in a philosophy, are we not in danger of merely disetinguishing between the "old fashioned" and the "new fashioned," even though the latter will be just as 4'historical" in its way as the former was? Adolf Seelbach 17 raises this question, and in the symposium of the Kant Society in 193i Emil Utitz implied that he thought Hartmann's shift to realism was "zeitbedingt." Hartmann's answer to his critic on that occasion is worthy of study. "I would regard it as misleading," he said,18 "to see the problem of reality itself as merely an expression of a passing time. It is a very old basic problem of philosophy, which periodically again and again comes to the fore. And rigorously taken, all and every philosophy must deal with it. . . . From this standpoint [and not from the standpoint of fashion] the investigations I have presented take their origin. They should not serve a 'movement' but a timeless demand." 16.

Hereafter referred to as "Problem."</page><page sequence="7">478 PHILOSOPHY AND PHENOMENOLOGICAL RESEARCH When one goes into Hartmann's discussion of the problem of real- ity and its evidence, it is easy to see how it is a "timeless demand"-it is the demand that philosophy not be absurd on its very face. For the "timeless demand" for reality is so little speculative, and so indiscrimi- nate in regard to the reality which will satisfy it, that the sort of reality Hartmann provides is of little or no distinctive use in the Wendung zum Realismus.19 Ontology, the assertion of being, "has a stand- punctual indifference to idealism and realism, and the same distance from them even though it is not equally visible in the two cases." The ontology which is assumed as ultima ratio in the Metaphysik der Erkenntnis and argued for in the symposium of I93I as part of the shift to realism is wholly negativistic; there must be being, but what it is the argument does not and cannot show: "Being is the common sphere in which subject and object stand over against each other."21 II. EMPIRICAL REALISM It is from the proof of the givenness of the real that we must begin our detailed discussion of Hartmann's strictures on Kant. Hart- mann does not directly charge Kant with failure to account for empiri- cal reality, and for that reason it might seem, at first, as if the argument in Zum Problem der Realititsgegebenheit would be irrelevant to our problem. Perhaps ultimately it is; but strictly speaking this entire paper by Hartmann seems to me to be irrelevant to his own position too. Nevertheless he thinks his realism is strengthened by the argu- ment, and if his position is strengthened, Kant's more "extravagant" metaphysics can be attacked by implication. Only when we see what Hartmann attempts to prove and how, can we say how significant it is for Kant's position. For the establishment of realism it does not suffice merely to throw the responsibility for proof upon the shoulders of the skeptic and "idealist," for as Hartmann said in his reply to Moritz Geiger, the grounds for the displacement of the burden of proof must be shown forth in some phenomenon, and the exhibition of this phenomenon is itself productive of evidence for the givenness of reality 22 This is of course Kant's own procedure against the idealists in his Refutation of Idealism, but it is easily seen that this refutation does not really meet Berkeley's problem at all. Kant accepts the "reality phenomenon" of empirical realism just as much as Hartmann does, though Hartmann 19. Cf. Metaphysik, p. 138. 20. Ibid., p. 300. 21. Mletaphysik, p. 138. 22. "Problem," p. 85.</page><page sequence="8">NICOLAI HARTMANN'S CRITICISM OF KANT'S 479 THEORY OF KNOWLEDGE does have objections to this assumption on the part of Kant. Hartmann holds to an a priori certainity of empirical reality, and he says, "Kant satisfied himself in showing how empirical realism was compatible with his idealism as one of its corollaries. But if he had seen it as a priori, then precisely according to his own concept of apriority it would have been necessary to demonstrate, in addition to this compatibility, also the conditions of its universality and necessity. For its claim to uni- versal validity is perhaps naively obvious, but not philosophically ob- vious. It is the precise problem."23 Let us see, then, why Kant does not carry through an a priori justification of the assumption of empirical reality. It is safe to say he never thought of it at all, since the given- ness of reality is not a formal a priori Sachverhalt. Therefore "accord- ing to his own conception of apriority," which was formal justifiability, he is not required to "deduce" the belief in empirical givenness; and if the mere givenness as such of reality were a priori for him, needless to say his conception of apriority would have had to be different; he would have had to be just a phenomenologist. To make this require- ment of Kant with his own conception of apriority would be to require him to use an ontological argument to deduce givenness. Hartmann had begun his Metaphysik der Erkenntnis, as we have seen, with the supposition of reality. There it was taken as an ultimna ratio, as he himself later says. His argument here, in the Zum Problem der Realitttsgegebenheit, is supposed to bear this assumption out and justify it. The argument moves from "emotional-transcendent acts," phenomena which are so constituted that they "transcend their own phenomenal character," or phenomena which have the marks of self- transcendence within themselves; but it merely establishes the fact that the concrete man is in a real environment. And this has never been denied. He tells us nothing about the reality which confronts man, except that it is as real as he. This failure to determine its nature is a consequence of the nature of the phenomena to which he appeals. "This mode of givenness of reality is not only different from that of knowledge, but occurs independently of it. Being affected by some- thing does not wait for the occurrence as such to be known. It is immediately there. Of course knowledge of the situation can follow it, but it need not. What it really 'was' which happened to me or affected me can remain hidden to me." But the that and the what do not appear equally visible: "The weight of the givenness of reality in an act is the greater the more indissoluble the reality of the object is 23. Metaphysik, p. 132.</page><page sequence="9">480 PHILOSOPHY AND PHENOMENOLOGICAL RESEARCH connected with the act-phenomenon. "24 In other words, the more con- crete and immediate the experience of reality, the less we know about it and the more certain we are that it is. Cognition containing a theore- tical element has less certainty in the more it asserts than a mute Erleben has in its mere acknowledgment that something has happened somewhere. The only ground which we have for supposing that which we do think to be real is that we can apparently have emotional and cognitive acts related to the same thing, in other words, that there is one reality and not two.25 But why, we may ask, so great a devotion to the emotional- transcendent acts? That Hartmann's phenomenological analysis of them is subtle and thoroughly accurate no one denies, but why does it occur here? In order to show both the strength and the weakness of his position, let us compare what he says about these acts with what might be or has been as truly said about cognition. "This confronta- tion (Betroffensein) is thoroughly real and is experienced as real. And because it is a confrontation with 'something,' immediately behind it must stand the happening (Widerfahrnis) itself, by which the sub- ject is touched and as the real thing which is experienced in the act."26 To be sure, if the experience of having something befall you is accur- ately described in these words, then there must be the thing there which does as a matter of fact befall you. But in knowledge the argument can be phrased in precisely the same way, and with as easy and obvious a phenomenological justification. Let us say: "Cognition is thoroughly real, and in every experience it is known as real. And since it is a cognition of something, so there must be immediately behind it the cognized' itself, which the subject cognizes, and which is the real thing which in knowldege the subject does as a matter of fact cognize." The only way to avoid this analogy is to say that, in Lockean terms, it is the idea which is cognized while the thing may be felt (as reminiscent of the function of intensity and "sensible knowledge" in Locke); but 24. "Problem," pp. 18, 30. 25. The interpretation at this time does not bring it out, but here we have a "Zwei- Instanzen System" as criterion of truth as this has been presented in Hartmann's earlier works. In a word, if two "ideas" of a thing agree they may both be wrong; but if we have two "sources" of experience and their deliverances agree, then their agreement in diversity is a criterion of their dependability. Hartmann uses in his other works the different sources of apriority and aposteriority as the two instances, but if in any way he could separate emotion and cognition, the argument could be employed very usefully here. But in this lecture, more than in any of his other writings, Hartmann is close to a kind of Lebensphilosophie or anthropology, and he emphasizes the errors introduced into the theory of knowledge by the mistake of isolating knowledge from other life-functions. For this reason, the fact that we erfahren and erleben the "same world" cannot be used as a criterion of its actuality. 26. "Problem," p. 16.</page><page sequence="10">NICOLAI HARTMANN'S CRITICISM OF KANT'S 48I THEORY OF KNOWLEDGE Hartmann of course explicitly rejects this anti-phenomenological con- struction (as for example in his sharp attack on Leo Polak.) Further: "In this occurrence, self-obtrusion, oppression (Zustossen, Sichauf- drangen, Bedrdngen) the happening (Widerfahrnis) shows a weight of reality which the subject cannot defend itself from. This reality is in a sense given; and against this, skeptical and idealistic attack must remain mute." But Berkeley's argument for reality is precisely the same: I am acting in putting myself into a position to experience (I open my eyes) but what I experience cannot be my product and is not affected by my desire or dislike of its own nature. "Whatever more there is, as that I experience such a particular smell, or any smell at all-this is independent of my will, and therein I am altogether passive."27 That Berkeley thinks of it not as having an altogether independent existence (in his sense, matter and in Hartmann's, Ansich- sein) does not affect either the cogency of the argument or its relevance to Hartmann's position, for both are interested here not in the onto- logical status of the thing but solely in its existential position with refer- ence to the concrete and particular subject. And for both of them it is equally real and equally evident that it is real; but for Hartmann to infer Ansichsein and ultimately realism from it is a subreption, essen- tially like Dr. Johnson's refutation of Berkeley, and no more justified. But it is further argued that Erfahren in the broad sense of Lebenserfahrung is in its own nature "the act-correlate of the happen- ing (Widerfahrnis)" and it is immediately known as such. "I have not spoken of subsequently breaking through the subjective limit, either in transcendent acts or anywhere else." And in cognition this phe- nomenological description also holds. For in the phenomena of know- ing, we do not experience the object as "idea" or "modification of mind," but without saying anything about the ultimate dignity of the object, we have in cognition an experience of "objects." If we do not, "object" is merely a flatus vocis.28 27. Three Dialogues between Hylas and Philonous, I. 28. For this reason, it seems to me one may rightly suspect some of Hartmann's phenomenological descriptions of knowledge. Especially noteworthy here are the descrip- tions of the Satz des Bewusstseins and the Bild des Objects im Snbjekt. (Metaphysik, 1. Teil, 2. Abschn., 5. Kap.) The fact is that one of the great apories of his system arises from the conflict of this Satz and intention. The antimony of consciousness (p. 6), the conflict between "knowing consciousness" (Satz der Erkenntnis) and "knowing conscious- ness" (Satz des Bewusstseins) may appear to many to be artificial, since it is based on the statement, "Zum Wesen des Bewusstseins geh6rt es, dass es nie etwas anderes als seine eigenen Inhalte zu fassen bekommt, nie aus seine Sphare heraustreten kann" (p. 59). The antinomy, which Hartmann overcomes only at great metaphysical expense, seems to me to be phenomenologically ill founded.</page><page sequence="11">482 PHILOSOPHY AND PHENOMENOLOGICAL RESEARCH When the givenness of reality is on such a firm foundation in our theoretical experience, where the object is not only given as real but also as definite, why go to another form of argument for reality? It is a practical matter. "In experiencing [in this broad sense] or suffering, it would be senseless to understand the happening (Wliderfahrnis) as merely supported by the act (aktgetragen), standing and falling with it, and thus as unreal." But this would be no more nonsensical (and no one has ever supposed that solipsism or even skepticism was practical) than to do the same thing with the act of observation. If one does make this supposition, "One does not at all understand the act, does not com- prehend its phenomenon, and has playfully mistaken the seriousness of human life."29 But is the seriousness of human life more directly or obviously threatened by the failure of this defense than it would be if a solipsism were intellectually founded? For to attack this argument, like the defenses against intellectual solipsism, is still possible, if one cares to go on. Skepticism can "certainly again and again validate the view that happenings, obstructions, fates (Wicderfahrnisse, Widerstdnde, Schicksale) are only self-created forces. But such stereotyped argu- mentation becomes less and less significant (wesenloser) the stronger the phenomenal transcendence of the act becomes. It is pushed more and more into empty abstraction. And so it exhausts itself, in that it becomes objectless (sic!)." But is this last Potenzierung of the skeptical argument any more arbitrary and "objectless" than the first one was, since the very first attack of the hypothetical skeptic is an attack on act- transcendence in its most naive and outstanding form? C'est le premier pas qui couite. In fact, though it must be admitted that all arguments against skepticism of this variety are futile so long as the skeptic makes his stereotyped reply, still the single judgments have a greater "objectivity" or "possibility of meeting the object" if emotional transcendence is forgotten. Moritz Geiger, in fairly close agreement with Hartmann, argued that since illusion could be discovered only by a comparative study within experience, experience as a whole could not be illusory, that such a statement would be not only false but meaningless. But Hartmann doubts the reality-evidence of these judgments which are clarified and abstract enough to be tested in this way, and it is true, though neither Geiger nor Hartmann argues in this way, that Geiger's disproof of the possible illusoriness of all experience will hold whether 29. "Problem," p. 31.</page><page sequence="12">NICOLAi HARTMANN'S CRITICISM OF KANT'S 483 THEORY OF KNOWLEDGE knowledge is a Realitdtzeugnis as they believe or only a Sinneinheirt.30 Empirical realism then can be neither dialectically proved nor refuted. But why is a proof needed? Helmut Kuhn pointed out that every form of realistic argument grows out of a polemical situation since it is always directed at some specific form of Realititsbezweiflung. Hartmann's argument is directed against the "pseudological" form which characterizes ancient skepticism's recognition of the possibility of deception but it neglects the more modern critical limitations. Oppos- ing purely empirical skepticism, Hartmann's attack can lead only to empirical realism. But that this empirical Ansichscin (which is not denied by idealism) can hold its own against Kant's or even Berkeley's attack-that possibility is not even touched by Hartmann. Thus we may say, if the realism Hartmann is here arguing for were metaphysical and not merely phenomenological, it would be systematic, conditioned by a standpoint in the stream of history as Utitz and Seelbach say, and therefore it would according to Hartmann lack weight. But realism of this kind is not systematic, and it is to be sure one of the timeless de- mands we may make on any philosopher or sane man. But then it does not touch Kant, even by implication. The idealists were quick to realize this. During the symposium Willy Moog said that a phenomenological analysis of the acts could be built into an idealistic as well as into a realistic system, and thus Hart- mann's polemic did not touch really critical idealism.31 Hartmann's answer is revealing in that it shows how far he had gone since he expressed the opinion that Sein was a neutral category including subject and object and therefore jenseits idealism and realism, which is his position in the Metaphysik der Erkenntnis. "Such a true idealism would have to draw, however, also the further consequence, and allow the 'acknowledged' reality of the world, and indeed of the empirical world, to hold as existing in itself," but he doubts if it could be called "true idealism" if it drew this consequence.32 But Hartmann is here confusing his own useful concepts of gnoseological and ontological Ansichsein; 30. But one may ask what is the criterion in Hartmann's scheme? Every emotional act, except perhaps "moods," claims a certain transcendence and objectivity. But what of pathological cases? And Hartmann explicitly refuses to base an argument for the existence of God upon the mere emotional conviction. "In regard to the religious experience, I do not indeed mean that from it one could directly 'prove' the existence of God, though perhaps that in it the reality of God could be immediately given.

Hartmann goes even further in his attack on the idealists who would allow this much of "realism" in their system, and thus he by implication attacks Kant.33 Against Liebert, who like Hegel thought of the true idealism as being the only true realism, and who sought a synthesis beyond perspectival distinctions (as opposed to Hartmann's epoche this side of idealism and realism), Hartmann re- plied, "The opposition of matter and spirit is not a contradiction, as that of views from a chosen standpoint is; they may easily be united in one world view. Therefore there is no need for a 'standing beyond them,' even if they are both fully autonomous; nor is there a.iy need for a dialectical synthesis. Both of them are rather included in the same reality. And whoever is aware of that stands already mn the foundations of realism." 34 And against Heinz Heimsoeth, he continues, "The great idealists have all of them only sublated one reality for the sake of another." 35 This is a noteworthy argument, meaning that all philosopher: are realists. But if this is the case, realism is a wholly nondescript philos- ophy, a tautology. The ontology of realism can only be the idea of an ontology in general. If every idealistic attack on the metaphysical Ansichsein of objects, beginning with Berkeley, is to be met by this realistic supererogation, we may paraphrase Hartmann's own argument against skepticism: such realism is always a formal possibility, but tL s stereotyped argumentation becomes less and less significant the mob idealistic that "being" is whose "reality" is asserted. The argument X analogous to, and as futile as, Parmenides' strictures on talking about non-being. It is unfortunate that Hartmann thought what he said was an attack on anyone, let alone Kant. III. THE SUPREME PRINCIPLE OF SYNTHETICAL JUDGMENTS We are ready to turn to specific points in Hartmann's explicit attack on Kant's idealism, now that we have seen idealism in general, and Kant's transcendental idealism in particular to be unaffected bv any "proof" of empirical givenness. The question is, can those specific parts 33. The writer must confess that he regrets having had to spend so much time dis- gcussin a problem which he considers ultimately irrelevant to Kant criticism. But here Hartmann, who never accuses Kant of neglecting empirical realities, implies that this phenomenological analysis is opposed to Kant's system. It is this belief of Hartmann's which has necessitated this already too long discussion. 34. Thus obviously the "Wendung zum Realismus" may be supposed as having taken place after the Metaphvsik der Erkenntnis in which Sein was "equally distant" from the hypostatizations of idealism and realism. Are we then to suppose that "realism" is proven by "Realitatsgegebenheit"? 35.

I shall make no futile attempt to defend Kant's idealism by deprecating the importance of the thing in itself; Hartmann, I think, is quite correct in his censures of those who, like his Marburg teachers, tried to explain the noumenon as a Grcnzbegriff whereas Kant only argued that the concept of the noumenon is a Gretzbegrifj. The major problem lies in Hartmann's attack on the supreme prin- ciple of synthetical judgment, or rather on the idealistic interpretation Kant gi ,es to this principle. Here again I shall have to neglect many important points in which I think Hartmann is correct: his construc- tion of the principle "A is not A" as a complement to the principle of analytical judgments, "A is not non-A"; his emphasis upon the non- judgmental character of much a prior knowledge, etc. These points are important, but they are more by way of supplements to Kant's own theory and do not materially affect the main points in his theory. That the conditions of experience should be at the same time condi- tions of the possibility of objects of experience is a statement which can be iLead in many ways. In order to avoid them, Kant has another and move careful statement of the principl. "Any object stands under the necessary conditions of a synthetical unity of the manifold of intuition in ja possible experience."86 However, we may interpret Kant to mean term "possibility of experience" is to be preferred to "possible experi- ei ce," and at B I95 we read, "The possibility of experience is thus that w hich gives all o'ur knowings a priori objective reality."37 Possible experience has its own laws, the laws of its own possibility, and these aws are the necessary conditions of any actual knowledge; but it would be a mistake to interpret them, in this section, as merely the formal conditions of experience; nothing in this section is asserted specifically about a priori synthetical judgments, and what is said is applicable to all synthetical judgments provided they be true. Because its laws are the same as the laws of our actual (true) experience as empirical sub- jects, and because its formed content is the empirical reality we actually experience, we have the possibility of the coexistence of empirical reality and transcendental ideality if grounds for the latter can be found. It does not prove that we have this coexistence actually; it merely means that, so long as we consider objects as objects of experi- 36. K. d. r. V., B, 197. 37. It is odd that Hartmann does not emphasize the preferability, in Kant's own thinking, of "conditions of possibility of experience" to "conditions of possible experience," since it seems to bring Kant closer to his way of thinking; this subtle point has been elucidated by Paton, Kant's Metaphysic of Experience, vol. ii, p. 90.</page><page sequence="15">486 PHILOSOPHY AND PHENOMENOLOGICAL RESEARCH ence, the transcendental ideality of the conditions would not prejudice the empirical reality of their specifications in actual experience. Because the possibilities of experience do not extend to the things in themselves as they are (or, in Hartmann, since they do not cover the entire Ansichsein of the object), we do not have a priori knowledge, or indeed any knowledge, of what is not under these conditions. Because there is no higher principle which unites the possibility of experience with the possibility of the existence of things in themselves, phenomena, says Kant, do not contain a priori determinations of things in themselves. Thus we have in Kant a three-level system of the relation of the subject to its counter-part: empirical realism-the objectivity of this or that spatial object and of this or that psychological subject; corresponding, in Hartmann, to gnoseologisches Ansichsein, Realitdtsgegebenheit. transcendental idealism-the ideality of the phenomenal object in a possible experience; the thesis that the conditions of the empirically real are, in part, conditions which underlie the possi- bility of experience; and according to Hartmann, the "dogma" that these principles are transcendentally subjective or ideal. metaphysical dualism-the speculative but unavoidable assump- tion of the ultimate duality of the transcendental subject and the thing in itself which "affects" it, a dogma which is denied by neo- Kantianism in favor of the transcendental subject (idealism) and modified by Hartmann in favor of the supreme sphere of being (ontologism). If the discussion in the preceding section has any value at all, it shows that the first level does not properly concern us now. We must restrict our attention to the second and third. The third concerns us first. Kant assumes the ultimate duality not only to "limit knowledge in order to make way for faith," but also to provide for the material contents of experience which he did not believe were capable of an a prior justification. That existence is not dialectically derivative is an opinion shared by Hartmann, and it is not only made on empirical grounds (the failure of science to deduce particulars), but also in order to avoid an ontological argument, Hartmann preferring the former ground and Kant perhaps the latter. Hartmann's monism is an objec- tion to this dualism from the other side, however, since he holds the common principles of the subject and the object are common principles of being, and since the subject is, it must be under these conditions. Several objectionable features of this doctrine can be seen immediately. We have already pointed out the poverty of this concept of being; if it</page><page sequence="16">NICOLAI HARTMANN'S CRITICISM OF KANT'S 487 THEORY OF KNOWLEDGE were a real concept, and not just a limit, we should run into certain of the difficulties I shall point out in regard to the second level. If it is not a real concept, not a "punctual unity," but a catch-all for all prin- ciples, I can see no legitimate objection one may raise against it except that it is as empty as Parmenides' being. But let us forget for the moment being in general and consider the being of the subject. Hart- mann is quite clear that Kant did not mean the transcendental con- sciousness to be a hypostasized existent,8 yet he just as often argues against it as an unnecessary being. He says, "The vehicle of appearing must have reality, else there could be no such thing as appearance as such. Thus a 'thing in itself' would be made the foundation of the system, and indeed its knowableness would be recognized as a matter of principle, though Kant has declared the things in themselves to be unknowable." 39 Obviously if "thing in itself" is to be interpreted as equivalent to being, Hartmann is no longer talking Kant's language and the objection does not meet the issue. On the other hand, if they are not the same, and they certainly were not for Kant, Hartmann's argument likewise fails. The notion of being has the disadvantage of allowing us to think that we have made a beginning towards categorization, though this is a delusion for it leaves "all cows equally black." Thus no material objec- tion can be made to Kant or to any other system on the ground that its highest principle is not being; the only objection which can be legiti- mately made is on a "lower level" and concerns what this being is. Hartmann's ontology is, as we have seen, negativistic: "The possibility of ontology remains, independent of the adequacy of its concepts." 40 Any attempt to qualify Being seems to be either too specific or not to have sufficient evidence behind it. Hartmann's particular objection to idealism is that it does not allow Seinsprinzipien which are not Erkennt- nisprinzipien.4' We must consider Hartmann's objections to idealism's equation of these two. To do so will lead us to the detailed study of the second level we mentioned above. A fundamental difference lies here. Kant says that the principles of actual experience must be like the principles of possible experience, that is principles from which the a priori character of actual experience can be derived, but not principles of any ultimate Ansichsein. Hart- mann, on the other hand, says it is sufficient if some of the principles 38. Cf. Kant's letter to Marcus Herz, February 1772, and Metaphysik, p. 146. 39. Metaphysik, p. 150. 40.

Ibid., p. 362.</page><page sequence="17">488 PHILOSOPHY AND PHENOMENOLOGICAL RESEARCH on the two sides of the knowledge-situation, imbedded in a common sphere of being, be the same, so that objective Ansichsein is at least under the partial domination of principles which also hold for the sub- ject as a particular Seinsgebilde. Thus Hartmann, in effect, eliminates the second level altogether, regarding the empirical subject-object situa- tion as metaphysically derivative from the peculiar nature of the being of the subject, placing over this duality a monism of common ontologi- cal principles which are neutral as regards this distinction between sub- ject and object. The degree of identity of principles on both sides is the degree to which knowledge can be extended; beyond that limit there is ineradicable ignorance. But the principles which give the mind a neces- sary isomorphism with empirical existence are no more adequately described as principles of experience than as principles of being. The subject iiberhaupt is a fiction, a prejudice Kant has taken from his standpoint to idealism. "The subject in general is a pure fiction of a standpoint, and with it idealism falls into the atavism of the dogmatic systems it has struggled against, in which the fiction of the intellectus infinitus, archetypes, or divinus had played the same role. And so far as all these Potenzierungen of the intellect, whether hypostasized or not, nevertheless are finally constructed only by analogy to the only intellect known to us men, so there is hidden in it, as probably in all epistemological idealism, a vestige of an old anthropomorphism." 42 Hartmann's argument against this conception of Kant, constituting the central theses of his own epistemology, may be summarized in three theses: (a) Principles which are to provide for knowledge of objects are neither objective nor subjective in any definite sense, though they may appear almost indiscriminately on the subject and object sides in knowing. (b) Since these principles are not products of the ratio, that they should be rational or knowable does not lie in their essence, and a fortiori the a priori need not be known a priori. (c) The object side in knowledge is homogeneous; that is we do not know a mere phenome- non, with the being which has Ansichsein remaining heterogeneous with it and necessarily unknowable. What we know of an object is that part of it which is under principles which our knowing mind is under, and more specifically that aspect of this part which is not too "distant" from the subject and which lies within its own psychological or metaphysical limits of actualization. IV. THE IDENTITY OF PRINCIPLES "Only an identity of principles can bridge the duality of subject 42. "Diesseits," p. 171.</page><page sequence="18">NICOLAi HARTMANN'S CRITICISM OF KANT'S 489 THEORY OF KNOWLEDGE and object without abolishing them; and therefore it is indifferent whether these principles are primarily principles of the object or of the subject, or stand neutrally above both of them." 43 "That which is philosophically valuable in the intellects infinitus is not the intellectus but the infinitum. It is not clear why this incontestable infinitum, which goes beyond the human ratio, should be attached to an intellect." 44 Thus argues Hartmann against the subject in general. At times he seems willing to allow it as a possible interpretation, as a matter of personal belief, but to be neither refutable nor provable and therefore to be a "transgression against the critical minimum of metaphysics." At other times he objects to Kant's formulation of the supreme principle as not even adequate to its own task; for example, apparently forgetting that Kant's principle is restricted to "objects of experience," he asserts that it stands "in obvious contradiction to his theory of ideas" since the latter points out the divergence between subject and object conditions.45 But for the sake of argument let us grant all of Hartmann's restrictions of the use of this principle in Kant, and then let us face the issue in its simplest form. Hartmann says, and I take this to be the central dis- harmony between him and Kant, "Principles of knowledge . . . are ontic (seiende) principles of knowledge, which is possible only if knowl- edge itself has a being, is a kind of being.46 What are the ontic principles which thus cover knowing and being known as well as unknowable being? Hartmann does not say that the principles of being, or our knowledge of them, are wholly empty; it is only the unity of all principles about which ontology can say nothing.47 In fact, a very great deal can be said about being in extension; and we do know that some of the principles or conditions of knowledge are conditions or principles of beings known. They are ontic principles because knowledge is a being. They are not "ideal." They are shared first of all by all subjects as peculiar kinds of beings (the root of inter- subjective apriority) and by some aspects of all subject-beings and some aspects of all object-beings (the root of transcendent apriority). This part of Hartmann's ontology is not negativistic, since we know a great deal about these beings we call knowers and some of their principles, or at least our conceptions of them. We have then to ask this question: Does the ontological assertion 43. Metaphysik, p. 151. 44. Ibid., p. 301. 45. Metaphysik, p. 350. 46. Ibid., p. 253. 47. Ibid., p. 310.</page><page sequence="19">490 PHILOSOPHY AND PHENOMENOLOGICAL RESEARCH of the primacy of being to knowing hold its own when we come to spe- cific and pregnant beings we call subjects? In other words, do the char- acteristics which make being the fundamental and ultimate, even if intensionally empty, concept obtain also for particular things which we call specific beings (Seinsgebilde as contrasted with Sein) ? Is it not rather that general ontological characterizations retire to the back- ground as soon as the emphasis is placed upon the Gebilde which are, or which have being? And do we not find some Gebilde which are beings in the ultimate and empty sense, but not beings in any pregnant sense of the word? The last two questions must, I think. be answered affirmatively as far at least as the knowing subject is concerned.48 Kant's entire philosophy is a denial that the subject and its knowl- edge are beings under laws characteristic of things which are known "to be." Mind, the root of knowing, is not a thing among things or a being among beings; it is the knownness of being (Bewusst-sein). This known-ness is the condition of the assertion of being in any pregnant modal sense. Being as modally pregnant is a Sinneinheit, even though as a noumenon in negative understanding it is more than this, and that despite the fact that a science (ontology) of this empty being is, for Kant, impossible. The transcendental possibility of experience has a being, but its modality is empty, since modality has a meaning only through relation of an assertion to other possible experiences of the same thing; the significance of possible experience is to be found in its relation to actualized experience, in which being is known, and not to empty being itself. The objection may be made, of course, that knowers are existents; this is, in fact, the meaning of Hartmann's own "Coperni- can revolution." 49 But this raises the issue of the status of knowledge in a world of existence or being, and we mean here the world of being in a pregnant, assertible, and identifiable sense. Hartmann's solution to the problem as to how a knowing subject can be and find its principles in a being- world raises more questions than it answers. It leads unavoidably to a confusion between psychological categories (being-principles in a preg- nant sense) and logical or epistemological categories (which are being- principles only in an empty Parmenidean or indeterminate sense). In the midst of phenomenal being we are introduced to "transcausal deter- minations" whose being is wholly irrational and can never be under- stood; these transcausal relations lend to logic and ontology a spurious effectiveness in their own right. To be sure this is an error of -post- 48. Cf. my "The Psychophysical as a Pseudo-Problem," Journal of Philosophy vol. xxxvii, 1940, pp. 561-571, where this point is argued in detail. 49. Metaphysi4, p. 277.</page><page sequence="20">NICOLAI HARTMANN'S CRITICISM OF KANT'S 491 THEORY OF KNOWLEDGE Kantian idealism too, but it is not an error in Kant since he held to a sharp distinction of spheres, with relations to each other obtaining between them only as wholes, not as 'an interpenetration of their "effects." The error is introduced by Fichte and is present in Hart- mann; what Hartmann finds as the Plotinian and "chorismic" errors in Kant's philosophy, that the categories are transcendent and their "appli- cation" to experience must be justified, shows itself to be one of the strongest points in Kant's doctrine since it sets up limits to various types of explanation.50 Hartmann avoids psychologism and anthropologism by not inter- preting the knowledge principles as primarily principles of subject- beings, though the inter-subjective a priori is psychologically conceived and all the a posterior is existential and anthropological. The only way to find out whether a principle which is given with a priori evidence is transcendently a priori, that is, also a principle of objects, is to test it perhaps empirically so as to eliminate prejudices which are also a priori, but only subjectively so. The principles which are eliminated are not illusory and of no metaphysical significance; they are rather meta- physical principles of being which apply only to some things (some or all subject-beings) and tell us much about them, rather than what they purport to assert. Here in this differentiation Hartmann is merely using an ontologi- cal language to describe what Plato discovered and Kant repeated: namely, that the a priori is a principle of knowing and of the known, whereas the empirically general characteristics of the empirical ego do not have this universality and objectivity. Hartmann is introducing into the negativistic sphere of empty being all of the distinctions Kant dis- covered, so that being in the pregnant sense (the only sense in which Kant used the word) is in effect distinguished from the necessary con- ditions of its own knownness, which have being only in the negativistic but, to be sure, imprescriptable sense. And having once made this dis- tinction, Hartmann goes on further in a Kantian way, distinguishing the knowable from the unknowable in the object by reference to the functions of the subject, admitting that the antinomies may be depend- ent upon discrepancies between subject-conditions and world-conditions in the sphere of pregnant being and making the world as a whole (mere Sein) antinomial in its own intrinsic nature.5' 50. How badly such a principle is needed by Hartmann is shown in his wholly un-Kantian attempt to solve the third antimony. Cf. Ethik, second edition, pp. 590-595. 51. "Wie ist kritische Ontologie iiberhaupt m6glich?" in Festschrift fur Paul Natorp. 1924, pp. 174-5.</page><page sequence="21">492 PHILOSOPHY AND PHENOMENOLOGICAL RESEARCH To summarize: Kant and Hartmann differ primarily only in the names they give to the principles at the second level; all of the distinc- tions pointed out by the former are admitted by the latter. Kant, how- ever, considers being as a phenomenal, i. e., a pregnant, determination, and therefore inapplicable to the conditions of its own knownness. Hartmann uses being and principles of being in a much broader sense so that it applies to both. But since the boundaries between transcen- dental conditions and phenomenal being coincide with that between being in an empty and in a pregnant modal sense, there is no real point at issue. All of the serious problems in this part of Kant's philosophy- turning on the point of how actual experience is related to possible experience or to the possibility of experience-are left where they were by Hartmann. Transcausal determinations, categorial fundamental relations, and psychophysical fundamental relations do not aid us in solving the problem of the relation of the phenomenal to the super- sensible, or of pregnant to tautological being. V. THE RATIONALITY OF CATEGORIES The second major ground on which Kant is criticized is his belief in the rationality of the principles of knowledge. By rationality here is not meant logical deducibility, for everyone is clear on the point that the ultimate principles even of logic are not "deducible," and Kant admits that the characters of space and time are not "logical," else they would be concepts and not intuitions. By rationality in this case Hart- mann means knowableness, and if the a prior forms are not ideal, i. e., not functions or productions of the ratio, Hartmann thinks they need not be known at all, and certainly their knowableness is not an a priori character of them, even though they must be known a prior if they are to be known at all. Some of them, he thinks, may be irrational in a preeminent sense, that is, both alogical and unknowable. It is one of the strong points of Hartmann's writing that he does not confuse these meanings of the irrational. Let us examine Kant's theory of the status of the formal a priors elements in experience. For there to be an apriority, Kant requires that there be two characteristics: a certain trait or structure must be per- vasive in experience and known to be such, and second it must be a condition of experience so that the occurrence of experience however characterized or categorized would be impossible without it. These two features (illustrated, for example, in the third paragraph of the Meta- physical Exposition of Space, B 38-39) must coincide, and this is the distinctive feature of the Kantian a priori. The transcendental method of Kant is to take the former (as found in his "phenomenological"</page><page sequence="22">NICOLAI HARTMANN'S CRITICISM OF KANT'S 493 THEORY OF KNOWLEDGE description of space and time, the Aristotelian table of judgments, the axioms of natural science, etc.) and to make a critical regression upon their conditions. To make this clearer, let us consider space as an example: Kant says spatiality is a universal characteristic of all external experience, and he says so on grounds of his phenomenological (to use Hartmann's own description) report of the experience which he imagi- natively varies to see what happens if spatiality were abolished; and also on the basis of his dogmatic assertion of the validity of geometry (as in the analytical or regressive method in the Prolegomena). This is space as an intuited form of experience; it is known a priori as a feature of experience as we have it, thought it is not asserted to be a form to be intuited in all possible experience of a being otherwise constituted for experiencing and not to be a form necessarily present in things apart from all experiencing. Kant is here asserting an absolute minimum of formal apriority; if it were originally with the weight only of a de facto generalization from experience, it is nevertheless taken as a criterion of our sane human experience, and if it failed, experience as the stuff analyzed by Kant disappears; thus it becomes a kind of presupposition for future experience, giving the futurity which is a necessary even if not sufficient condition of apriority. Now Kant asks how we can assert this apriority which is an absolute minimum, or, to put it in another way, why is space a priori? He might have said space is valid of objects in themselves and in some way it migrates into experience, or he might have said it is an a posteriori human generalization; but in addition to the reasons (largely "phenomenological") he had for not doing so, there are deeper reasons lying in his transcendental method. They do not follow solely from the impossibility of an a priori knowledge of things in themselves nor from the impossibility of the Humean denial of a priori synthetical knowledge; they are dictated by Kant's desire for a metaphysical minimum, his desire to state what he finds in experience as only an experiential necessity. Kant says this intuited form can be said a priori to characterize all our experience, but at the same time to be known definitely as characterizing only this experience, if it is at the same time a form of intuition. Thus central to the Kantian argument is a principle which is formally like the supreme principle of synthetical judgments: the intuited forms are likewise the forms of intuition. Mutatis mutandis, this is Kant's assertion of the identity of categories, but materially it is far different from Hartmann's "minimal" reading of this supreme principle. If the transcendental condition, without which experience as it is constituted would be impossible, were not identical with the conditions which are necessary for the objects as experienced,</page><page sequence="23">494 PHILOSOPHY AND PHENOMENOLOGICAL RESEARCH we should have no grounds for connecting a priori necessity with uni- versality. To be sure in Kant these conditions are not wholly rational; but they are necessarily knowable. Hartmann attacks Kant here at almost every point. (a) Erkenntnisgesetz is not the same thing as Gesetzerkenntnis; the former is the prius of knowledge, the latter the posterius.52 This is not a significant objection to Kant, however. The a priori is not first in order of time or obviousness; and if it asserts more than this, it erects metaphysical (ontological, but at least non-epistemological) principles which are constructs or hypotheses to account for that which is known directly. Hartmann's grounds for doing this lie only in his interpreta- tion of experience as a kind of being, which conception we have already discussed. And interpreted most narrowly, the statement is a truism. Kant would completely agree with the following assertion of the means of knowing conditions of knowledge: "Conditions are certainly, if at all, known with a priori evidence, though this evidence is not immediate, but mediated through that regressus (Rickgang resp. Riickschluss)." 53 (b) The concepts we make of those conditions underlying the pos- sibility of experience are and remain concepts of categories; they are not themselves categories. "Knowledge of principles is related to the principle which is in the same way that knowledge of objects is related to the transcendent object.54 "Concepts of categories are nothing but attempts to comprehend a category or to progressively formulate it. Between them and the categories themselves there is the same tension of the progress of knowledge as obtains between the knowledge of the object and the object itself." 55 These statements are dependent again upon Hartmann's basic ontological theory, that the principles of knowl- edge are ontic principles of being which are shared by the object in itself and by the knower as a kind of being. To be sure, then, they are not correctly labeled psychological or cosmological principles or condi- tions of knowing an object; but formally, ontological and gnoseological formulation of these principles is like the existential and psychological. That is to say, there are certain partially or wholly unknowable con- ditions which are partially or wholly identical for the knowing-being and for the known-being. We do not know the principle as it is or the object which it dominates; we know only that aspect of the principle which we intuit in that object. This principle is indicated or suggested, and on account of its compulsiveness it is inferred to dominate also our 52. Metaphysik, p. 350. 53. Metaphysik, p. 253. 54. Ibid., p. 251. 55. Loc. cit.</page><page sequence="24">NICOLAI HARTMANN'S CRITICISM OF KANT'S 495 THEORY OF KNOWLEDGE experiencing the object, since experience is also a kind of being under universal ontological laws. Thus the principles of the a priori structure (and for Hartmann, also content) of knowledge are not specifically subjective or objective, but neutral; still objective (realistic) or subjec- tive (idealistic) interpretations could equally well account for the phe- nomenon of apriority. They would, however, assert more than we know about the a priori than we can know acpriori, which is merely that there is an identity of principles on the two sides of the knowledge situation. Nevertheless, because Hartmann thinks this identity extends also to the real object (thing in itself ) he is asserting more than experi- ence justifies, for the partial identity of principles is, at the very least possible, a partial identity of the appearance and our experience, in the duality we directly know. (Whether this is justified will be discussed in the last section, on the distinction between appearance and reality.) (c) Kant's theory of the transcendental consciousness is involved in his identification of the conditions of experience with the necessary features found in the experience; but Hartmann says that there is an identity of subjective and objective conditions in being, though these conditions appear only in a disguised form in a priori evidence in experi- ence.. Thus to Hartmann it appears that Kant's transcendental con- sciousness as the "source" of these principles is merely an hypothesis, a metaphysical speculation unnecessary to Kant's own justification of the a priori.56 If the interpretation of Kant is correct whereby these condi- tions must be identical in the three phases but have no relevance (as they cannot if the distinction between appearance and reality, however interpreted, is valid) to things in themselves, then this is not an hypothe- sis but, as Kant thought, the sole sufficient condition of experience. Thus Hartmann's apriority is always merely hypothetical since it is a construction of being beyond experience, whereas Kant's apodicticity is found in a regressus upon conditions, found as it were beneath experi- ence; Kant's apodicticity is therefore not hypothetical when regarded only in terms of that experience based upon it, and not in terms of a neutral or objective ontology. To infer characters of being from experi- 56. It is here that Wood's criticism most nearly approaches Hartmann's. "The critical epistemology is not incomparable with the transcendental idealism, yet Kant's argument from the one to the other is certainly inconclusive. I am convinced that the really signi- ficant insights of the critical epistemology could be preserved even if the whole transcendental paraphernalia were either abolished altogether or else translated into psychological terms. Kant's metaphysical idealism-for it is that despite Kant's professed repudiation of all dogmatic metaphysics-is, in relation to his critical rationalism, a mere suppelmentary hypothesis which has to compete on terms of equality with the rival hypothesis of realism." ("The Transcendental Method," in The Heritage of Kant, p. 18.) For "psychological" read "ontological," and the agreement is perfect.</page><page sequence="25">496 PHILOSOPHY AND PHENOMENOLOGICAL RESEARCH ence (and by this being one must mean a modally pregnant being, another being than experience itself), is to construct an hypothesis which goes beyond the fact of experience. Thus, though it can be said that Kant's transcendental idealism is an ontological hypothesis, it is an hypothesis giving the minimum conditions of an actual experience. Hartmann's assertion of being is, since it contains non-experiential determination of both experience as a being and the being experienced, in contrast with it, speculative and dogmatic. In a word, Hartmann hypostasizes being as necessary in a way in which he admits Kant does not have to hypostasize the transcendental subject as a being in any pregnant sense.57 Kant does not hold there may be no unknowable principles of Ansichsein, nor does he hold there may be no unknown aspects of the twelve categories and two forms. All that he denies is that there may be unknown principles which are a priori for experience as it is consti- tuted. (We know this from his assertion of the exhaustiveness of his analysis.) But his theory in its essentials would not be adversely affected, as Ledger Wood has shown, by regarding the list of categories as merely a de facto analysis just as his statement of the forms of intuitions was. All that is essential is the assertion that every necessary principle in experience corresponds to a necessary condition of experience; as to the manner of discovery we need make no restrictions. VI. THE THING IN ITSELF Finally, we come to the last decisive problem, that of the status of the thing in itself, Though Kant expresses himself sometimes loosely in regard to it, for purposes of evaluating Hartmann's criticism several easily documented theses may be taken as expressive of Kant's views: (i) The thing in itself is that which "affects" the senses to produce the "presentations of the things which are unknown in their nature," and these presentations are phenomena." (ii) What we do know is the phenomenon which is under condi- tions which do not hold for the things in themselves but only for our own experiencing; therefore it is not only possible but also necessary that there be a priori knowledge of appearance. 57.

It is the "other side of appearance. "62 The first of these theses requires little attention. It has long been realized that Kant committed a subreption in applying causality beyond possible experience. Furthermore, it is also generally recognized that a causal theory of knowledge is inadequate, regardless of the status of the entities .supposed to be concerned in knowledge; and in this first thesis, and also in part in the fourth, Kant has not completely resisted the seduction of Locke's analysis. Hartmann is rightly insistent upon the "transcausal" character of the knowledge relation. Moreover, there is agreement as regards the fourth thesis in so far as Hartmann thinks of sensuous material as a system of symbols of that which is not sensuous 63 and Kant'holds that an "empirical ideality" can be attributed to the a posteriori sense contents.64 They agree that there is no "migration" of the characters of things in themselves into sensa- tion, and that there is no resemblance between a sensation and its corre- late. Hartmann holds, however, that there may be an "intersubjective apriority" of the sense material; such a belief is not expressed by Kant, but there is no fundamental reason why he might not accept that view. Nevertheless, Hartmann does argue that there may be a posteriori knowledge of the thing in itself, for all true knowledge is of an Ansich- sein; therefore their disagreement here is a mere corollary of their divergent views concerning the second thesis. Similarly; little discussion of the last thesis is required. In both systems, appearance is of a real thing which is not limited to the sphere of experience. For Hartmann, the Ansichsein includes the "objectified" and the "transobjective" as continuous parts, with the boundary be- tween them being shifted in the direction of the latter in the progress of 60.

The progress of knowledge occurs wholly within the former, with the transcendental object a mere x which is to be progressively characterized. The thing in itself, in its own nature, does not appear, if we mean by that that it becomes phenomenal. It is at most the substratum of experience. It is here that Hartmann makes an illicit criticism. He says, "If the thing in itself is the partially appearing behind the appearance, and in its un- known and infinite remainder but the continuation of the known, then it would be an astonishing coincidence if the accidental limits of pos- sible experience were the same as the limits of the validity of the categories in it."65 But for Kant there is not this continuity which Hartmann hypothesizes and which he finds only on the basis of his original Auffassulg66 and because of his empty assertion of the com- munity of all being. Therefore the limits of the former are not acci- dental for Kant, and their coincidence with the limits of the categories is not astonishing. In fact, they are essentially related as two different expressions of the basic heterogeneity between appearance and that which is (ambiguously) said to "appear" in it. Hartmann, however, is here arguing from his own thesis of the ontic continuity which Kant denies in the second thesis. But the force of Hartmann's thesis of homogeneity is considerably weakened by one consideration. We have already seen how the concept of being is unable to effect any actual synthesis or categorization of "everything which in any sense is," and the spurious unity of Being is disrupted by the vari- ous tensions which Hartmann finds within it. Here he asserts that the unknowable aspects or parts of the object depend, for their unknow- ableness, not on any intrinsic peculiarity they have, but solely on the incapacity of the subject-being or the knowledge relation to "bridge the gnoseological distance" from the subject, and he admits that there is an undetermined point dependent only upon the nature of the being of the subject, and not on any intrinsic peculiarity of a specifically "un- knowable" being, beyond which this boundary- cannot be pushed. Thus the world of Being itself develops the heterogeneities he had decried in Kant's separation of appearance and reality.67 Once again, the looseness of the unification through the concept of 65. Metaphysik, p. 227. 66. Cf. above, p. 474. 67. The distinction between appearance and reality returns in Hartmann with almost the same force as is in the Kritik der Urteilskraft, sect. 77, "Von der Eigentiimlichkeit des menschlichen Verstandes . . ." For it is merely a peculiarity of knowing, says Hartman, that it takes its object from a perspective, and "Appearance is the objective structure of consciousness differentiated from the object."-Metaphysik, p. 225.</page><page sequence="28">NICOLAi HARTMANN'S CRITICISM OF KANT'S 499 THEORY OF KNOWLEDGE being is obvious when Hartmann comes to the problem of the antin- omies. It was the discovery of the antinomies which led Kant to abandon rational ontology after he had written the dissertation of I770. Kant's attempt to solve the antinomies does not fail to do justice to the Aporie itself; it is an attempt not to deny the antinomial character of the different aspects of experience, but rather to use these to show the distinction between phenomenally appearing and ontologically being. Hartmann, in denying the ultimacy of the distinction, is faced with the same kind of problem (with a different coefficient, as it were) which Berkeley would have had to struggle with had he known of the anti- nomial character of his metaphysical assertions. That is to say, when the distinction between appearing and merely being is regarded as acci- dental, then esse, whether interpreted as percipi or Ansichsein, itself becomes antinomial. Thus Hartmann develops, as the only alternative to Kant's distinction which will not rationalize the antinomies away, the highly speculative and uneconomical theory that "being itself is dishar- monious, and conflict is the form of its being. In this case we must assume that the principle of contradiction does not actually, or at least only conditionally, obtain for the sphere of the ontic real."68 Here, with the logical law as a form dominating only the ratio, the distinction between appearance and reality is surreptitiously introduced even after being has been made antinomial and chaotic. We have now seen that the divergences with reference to each of these theses, where they do exist, depend upon Hartmann's rejection of the second and third of Kant's views which I have listed at the begin- ning of this section, or at least that part of them which says that the a prior conditions of phenomena are not conditions of things in them- selves. But this thesis is absolutely central for Kant, and its rejection is decisive for Hartmann. Each philosopher gives an essentially similar picture of the fact of phenomenation; what Kant cannot do and what Hartmann attempts in spite of the acknowledged antinomies is to gen- eralize beyond these phenomena as kinds of being to a general ontic continuity. This ontic continuity is not, however, as we have seen, necessary for accounting for the reality-phenomenon or for empirical realism.69 In Kant, the thing in itself provides only for aposteriority; 68. "Wie ist kritische Ontologie iimberhapt m6glich?" pp. 174-175. Though it cannot be dogmatically asserted that this is Hartmann's final view, nevertheless at that (1924) it was the only alternative to Kant's theory which he gave more than a mere nod to. 69. Kant is quite insistent upon the adequacy of his concept of object to satisfy all the phenomenological demands, and Hartman concedes this in admitting Kant's empirical realism. The fact that it is not a priori does not, as we have seen, touch any relevant point here.</page><page sequence="29">500 PHILOSOPHY AND PHENOMENOLOGICAL RESEARCH .... but to construct an a priori theory which is to apply to it is to assert more about it than we know, and indeed more than we need to know in order to understand the phenomena. Therefore Hartmann's ontology, which tries to do this, is speculative and, in Kant's sense, dogmatic. LEWIS WHITE BECK. EMORY UNIVERSITY AND THE UNIVERSITY OF DELAWARE.</page></plain_text>
