SHUTT Worcester Worcester This article 1) is based on a study of the beginning of the Jewish Antiquities,Antiquities, for which Josephus' primary source is Genesis, with special reference to the Biblical names, the meanings ascribed to them, and the statements made about them. His policy is clear from two specific statements: "... it (i.e. the Antiquities) will embrace our entire ancient history and political con stitution, translated from the Hebrew records". (Ant. 1,5; Loeb translation) "Translated" is a somewhat ambiguous term, and the statement about the Hebrew records does not mean that they were necessarily consulted in the Hebrew language. "I have one thing to add, of which the Greeks are perhaps unaware, before reverting to the narrative where I left it. With a view to euphony and my readers' pleasure these names have been Hellenized. The form in which they here appear is not that used in our country, where their structure and termination remain always the same; thus Nochos (Noah) in Hebrew is Noe, and the name retains this form in all the cases". (Ant. I, 129; Loeb translation) In the Septuagint version, which Josephus uses as a source, the names are not "hellenized", but transliterated from the Hebrew. Thus in the LXX, the form of Noah's name is Nws 2), and since Josephus uses the Hebrew and Greek versions of the Old Testament, and each of these versions sometimes has a different form of a particular name, the hellenized form found in Josephus can be expected to give some indication at least of his preference. His "hellenization" is for the ג) Quotations in this article are made from H. St. J. Thackeray, Josephus IV.

SHUTT 168 most part easily comprehensible: a rather unhappy effort is found with Japheth (Ant. I, 122: Gen. 10,1. Heb. and LXX Japheth). Josephus has Tacp0a, which is a somewhat doubtful form for a proper name in Greek. So too with Taßaxyo!; (Ant. I, 331) for Jabbok, following the LXX 'Iaßox. Melchisedek (Ant. I, 180 etc., cf. B.J. VI, 438) seems a special case, for the name has not been hellenized; so too Solyma (Ant. I, 180). The names and statements made by Josephus about them can be tabulated for convenience, after which the significance of the evidence produced will be assessed. Table Table Table Table A. General instances of modification, amplification, and explanation in Josephus' statements, the effect of which is to approximate the language to Greek and Roman thought and customs: Ant. 11,73: The baker was "crucified": according to Gen. 40,19 he was "hanged". Ant. I, 196: Abraham was "sitting before the door of his courtyard". Gen. 18, 1 and LXX "tent". Ant. II, 45: "on the approach of a public festival". An amplification has here been inserted by Josephus, to explain why the menfolk were absent (Gen. 39, 11). According to Thackeray (Loeb, Josephus,Josephus, ad loc.) there are Rabbinical parellels to this addition. Ant. I, 186: "the oak called Ogyges". 'Qyoyio^ means "primitive", instead of the Bibl. "oaks of Mamre". Examples of more simple amplification are: Ant. II, 18: (Gen. 37, 12) "now that their harvest labours were ended". Ant. II, 31: (cf. Gen. 37, 24) "... he departed in search of grounds suitable for pasturage". Ant. II, 36: (cf. Gen.37, 32f.) "... who had already received news of his son's misadventure". Ant. 11,39: (cf. Gen. 39, If.) Potiphar "gave (Joseph) a liberal education". Ant. II, 63: The king's cupbearer was "wearing the same fetters as Joseph". Ant. I, 41: "at that epoch all the creatures spoke a commong tongue", cf. Book of Jubilees 3,28.</page><page sequence="3">169 BIBLICAL NAMES IN JOS. ANT.

The form in Jos. however is found in some LXX mss. Ant. I, 180: Jerusalem. The hellenized form adopted by Jos. and used here and elsewhere is TspoeroAu^a (LXX TspousaXY)[!). He gives the popular etymology of the name, though it is not strictly accurate (Loeb,/0j-., note ad loc.). Ant. I, 331: Jabbok. This is a typical illustration of Jos. hellenization (Gen. 32,22). Heb. Jabbok, LXX 'Iocßox. His rather ugly juxtaposition of xx to form the Greek ending 'Iaßaxyoc; is note worthy, also Ttxßav-yoc, rather than the direct use of the LXX 'Iaßox. Ant. I, 302: Leah.

Table Table E Instances in which the statements and interpretations of names in the Antiquities follow the Hebrew rather than the LXX narrative: Ant. I, 52: Cain and Abel. Jos. derives Cain from "acquisition". Heb. Kanah, LXX EXT7](7a[x7)v. He derives Abel from "nothing". Heb. Hebel, "vapour". The reading o1»0sv is that of Jos. codd. RO and Lat., the others read tcsvOo^, which represents another etymology of Abel from Heb. 'ebel, found also in Philo, De Migr. Abr. 13, 74. (Loeb, Jos., note ad loc.). It is noteworthy that the one reading (oüOsv) in Jos. approximates to one Heb. etymology, and the variant (tovOo;;) to another, although it is difficult to be sure what Jos. originally wrote. Ant. I, 262: Eskos = "combat". Heb. = "contention". LXX xSlxlx. Jos.Jos. adopts the meaning given in the Heb. Ant. II, 180: Gera, (see below Jacob, II, 176, and his departure for Egypt.) Gen. 46,21 (Heb.) gives the names of the sons of Benjamin. LXX also gives the names, but says that three them were sons ofBenja min, and the others his grandsons. Jos. follows of the Heb. here. Ant. II, 176: Jacob's departure for Egypt. The number of Jacob's sons and grandchildren is 70 (Gen. 46, 8ff.). LXX says that there were 75 of them (46, 27). The mss. of Jos. give 70, agreeing with the Heb., except for RO, which give 75. On textual grounds, Niese and Naber adopt the reading 70. Ant. I, 39: Tigris. "The Tigris (is called) Diglath, expressing at once "narrowness" and "rapidity"." The Heb. is Hiddekel. Diglath is the Aramiac equivalent. Jos. gives the Aramaic form, and translates the Heb. (Had = "sharp", dak = "thin".) Ant. I, 308: Zabulon. With the names of Leah's children, Jos. seems to follow the Scriptural interpretations, with the possible ex ception of Zabulon, for which Gen. 30, 20 gives two Heb. derivations, "endow" and "dwell". LXX gives none. Jos. gives his own derivation, "pledge".

J. H. SHUTT 172 Ant. I, 73: Angels. "For many angels of God ..." (Gen. 6, 1). "Sons of God", Heb. Jos. follows the LXX statement. Ant. I, 205: Amman, "son of the race". Heb. Ben-ammi, "son of my people". LXX "son of my race", which Jos. follows (Gen. 19, 38). Ant. I, 212: Bersubai = "well of the oath". Heb. Beersheba = "well of seven" (Gen. 21, 30.31). LXX "well of swearing", followed by Jos. Nevertheless, two narratives and meanings may here be interwoven. (S. R. Driver, Genesis [Westminster Comm.], ad loc.). Ant. 1,284: Bethel = "God's hearthstone" (Gen. 28, 19). LXX olxoq 0eoü. Ant. 1,343: Benjamin (Gen. 35,18). Rachel wanted to call him Benoni ("son of my sorrow"). Jacob called him Benjamin ("son of the right hand"). So too LXX. The name Benjamin has no connection with "sorrow", "suffering", so Jos. statement is confused, presumably with Benoni. Ant. I, 260: Gerar (Gen. 26, 17). Heb. "in the vale of Gerar". Jos. clearly follows the LXX lv ty) cpocpayyi. Fspapwv, in saying "a place called the Ravine", and further, makes "Ravine" a proper name. Ant. 11,184: Goshen. (Gen. 46,28: "the land of Goshen"). LXX (followed by Jos.) has "the city of Heroes" (Heroopolis). Jos. perhaps follows the LXX here, because the name Heroopolis might be more recognisable by a non-Jew. (It is perhaps the Egyptian Egyptian Pithom.) Ant. I, 346: Isaac died aged 185. With his death Jos. ends the first book of Ant. (See Loeb,/0j-., ad. loc.) Thackeray raises the quest ion whether "the Greek Genesis was ever divided at this point". The Berlin Fragment of Genesis breaks off here (35, 8). If it could be established that the Greek Genesis did break off here, we should have additional and more specific evidence of Jos. close following of the LXX. Ant. I, 80: "... the second month, called by the Macedonians Dius and by the Hebrews Marsuan." Heb. Marheshwan. For an extended note on the calendar, and the chronology of the patriarchs, see Loeb,Jos., ad loc. Ant. I, 81: Jos. refers to the "27th day". Heb. "17th day". Ant. I, 205. Moab and Amman (cf. Gen. 19, 30). Jos. adopts the LXX interpretation of these names.</page><page sequence="7">173 BIBLICAL NAMES IN JOS. ANT. I AND II, 1-200 Ant. I, 63: Lamech's "77 children". They are not mentioned in Heb. LXX (Gen. 4, 24) says that he was avenged "77 times". Jos. follows the LXX in giving this number, but makes 77 the number of his children. Ant. II, 39: Pentephres (or Petephres). Potiphar (Gen. 39, 1). LXX says that he was ocp^iii-aysipo?, "chief cook". Heb. does not mention this. Jos. has dcv7;p .... s7ri. tmv ®apacoOou [i.ayE1p0)v.. Ant, 11,91: Psonthomphanechos, the name given to Joseph by Pharaoh (Gen. 41, 45f.). Heb. Zaphenath-paneah, an Egyptian name meaning "God spake, and he came to life". (Driver, Genesis,Genesis, ad loc.) Jos. follows the LXX name, which does not give the meaning, but he attempts to give the meaning, "Discoverer of Secrets". This is a fairly clear case of Jos. preference for the LXX form of the name, and of his awareness of the Heb. at the same time. Table Table G Instances in which the form of the hellenized name, or the meaning given to the name, seems independent of the Hebrew or LXX narrative: Ant. I, 77: Ark. "He constructed an ark of four stories." Jos. does use the LXX word xißtoTOi;, and states that the ark was of four stories (three in Gen. 6,16). Ant. I, 187: Hagar (Gen. 16, 3). LXX 'Ayap. Jos. omits the aspirate. Ant. I, 84: Anoch (Enoch) "returned to the divinity", (cf. Ant. IV, 326). LXX ji.sTs07)xev, i.e. "God transported him". Ant. I, 238: Sons of Abraham. Although, on the whole, Jos. reflects the LXX versions (e.g. MaStavrjc LXX MaSaifi., Gen. 25, 2), the form Aoucrüßaxo? which he gives for Ishbak (LXX Tsaßox) is independent of both. Ant. I, 177: Dan is said to be one of the two sources of the Jordan. This may be consistent with a popular etymology, but is not very accurate. Ant. I, 305: Dan is Heb. = "he judged". In Greek, Jos. says, it could be rendered Theocritus. This, however, means "chosen by God". Ant. I, 182: Enner. Bibl. Aner, LXX Auvav. The form "Ew/jpo; in Jos. is independent of both. Ant. I, 258: Esau, Jos. says, was so called "after his hairiness, since the Hebrews call shaggy hair esauron." From the context Esau means hairy, but the Heb. does not actually confirm this, though</page><page sequence="8">R. J. H. SHUTT 174 Gen. 25, 25 plays on Edom ("red") and Seir ("hairy"). Thacke ray's comment here (Loeb, ed. ad loc.) is: "Josephus is weak in his philology". Ant. I, 39: Euphrates. "The Euphrates is called Phoras, signifying either "dispersion" or "flower"." Phoras is the reading of mss. RO and Lat., the rest read Phora. Heb. is Peräth, which Jos. derives from Paras, "divide", or Päräh "be fruitful". Philo renders xap7ro&lt;pop1a, thus adopting the latter. Ant. I, 36: Eve. "In the Hebrew tongue woman is called essa; but the name of that first woman was "Eve", which signifies "mother of all (living)." The modern transcription is *issä (Gen. 2, 23). HavväHavvä (Eve) = "living" or "life". Jos. says that the name itself actually means what Gen. says is the reason for her receiving the name. His etymology is not very precise. Ant. 11,186: Egyptians. Gen. 46,34: "for every shepherd is an abomination unto the Egyptians". So too LXX. Jos. has an independent paraphrase: "for the Egyptians were forbidden to occupy themselves with pasturage". Ant. II, 92: Ephraim, says Jos., means "restorer" (Gen. 41, 52). The Heb. derivation means "be fruitful". Ant. I, 170: Hebron = Naßpw. Jos. is not consistent in the form of this name. Other forms found elsewhere are Naßpoiv, Nsßpcov, Fißpcov, "Eßpwv, Xsßpcöv. Ant. I, 62, 63: Anoch ('Av«xo0 in Jos. Heb. and LXX Enoch. Jos. is independent of both, as also for Jarad (TapaSvjc;), for which Heb. has Irad, and LXX TaiSaS. Ant. I, 308: Joseph = "addition of one to come." Heb. and LXX (Gen. 30, 24.) give the meaning as "may God add to me another son", Jos. version is not quite the same. Ant. II, 123: Gen. 43, 34. "But Benjamin's mess was five times as much as any of theirs." LXX 7rsvTa71X(X(Ttw!;. Jos. says that Benjamin was given "double portions". Ant. I, 113: NsßpwSy]!; (Nimrod), LXX NsßpcoS.

Ant. I, 196; B.J. IV, 533). This is Jos. version of the "oaks of Mamre". The adjective 'QyÜYf.0? means "primitive", a word which is derived from a background of Greek thought and tradition.</page><page sequence="9">175 BIBLICAL NAMES IN JOS. ANT. I AND II, 1-200 Ant.

Jos. explains the meaning ("little"), but gives his own version of the name. Table Table H Instances in which the statements of Josephus do not correspond closely with either the Hebrew or Septuagint text, but are apparently independent: Ant. I, 34: "Now this man was called Adam, which in Hebrew signifies "red", because he was made from the red earth kneaded together; for such is the colour of the true virgin soil." Adamah = ground: Adom = red. Jos. seems to try and conflate these two meanings. Ant. I, 35: (Gen. 2, 20) Jos. says that God, not Adam, gave living creatures their names. Ant. I, 244: Charran. Bibl. Nahor. LXX Na/wp (Gen. 24, 10). Jos. does not follow Heb. or LXX, but gives the name of Nahor's city (cf. Gen. 11, 31). The meaning is the same, but Jos. is independent of his sources here. Ant. I, 377: Dinah. Jos. says that she was ravished "as the Sikimites were holding a festival". Gen. 34, 1, also LXX, says that she "went out to see the daughters of the land". In the Loeb ed. of Jos.,Jos., ad loc., it is suggested that the festival may have derived from Theodotus. Ant. I, 63. Lamech. Jos. adopts from LXX (Gen. 4, 24) the number 77, but independently ascribes 77 to the number of his children. Ant. II, 15. Joseph's dream. Jacob "was delighted with the dream". Gen. 37, 10 says that Jacob "rebuked him", and (v. 12) "kept the saying in mind". Weill quotes parallels from Midrash and Philo in support of Jos. (vide Loeb, Jos., ad loc.) Ant. II, 16: "The "eleven stars" of Joseph's dream. Gen. 37, 9 and LXX refer to "eleven stars". Independently, Jos. may be alluding to the signs of the Zodiac specifically (cf. Loeb, Jos., ad loc.). This however is conjectural. Ant. II, 122: Joseph and his brethen and Benjamin. Gen. 43, 29: "God be gracious unto thee, my son", cf. LXX. Jos. says: "he exclaimed that God presided over all". This is a loose paraphrase, or 7tpoerraTY)v in Jos. may be corrupt, though this seems doubtful.</page><page sequence="10">R. J. H. SHUTT 176 Ant. II, 117: cf. Gen. 43, 9: "If I bring him not unto thee ... I shall have sinned against thee for ever". So too LXX. Jos. paraphrases: "he would lay down his life along with him". Ant. II, 169: Jacob goes to Joseph in Egypt. Gen. 45, 26 says that Jacob did not believe the reports that Joseph was alive; so too LXX. Jos. says, quite independently: "he could deem none of these reports incredible". Ant. I, 39: Nile . . . "Geon, which flows through Egypt, means, "that which wells up to us from the opposite world", and by Greeks is called the Nile." The Heb. Gihon is thus derived from giah,giah, and is generally accepted. "From the opposite world" is Jos. independent addition: it is the reading of mss. RO; the rest of the mss. read "from the east". Ant. 1,38: Pishon. "Of these (rivers) Phison, a name meaning "multitude" runs towards India ..." Phison is Jos. version of Bibl. Pison, and the etymology is uncertain. Jos. identifies "the land of Havilah where there is gold" (Gen. 2, 11) with India. 'Palaistine' (Palestine) is used by Jos. of Philistia only. (G. A. Smith, Historical Geography of the Holy Land, 1966, p. 27; cf. also p. 346: "to Josephus, Coele-Syria is all Eastern Palestine", including Moab and Ammon (Ant. I, 206). Ant.

Gen. 29, 32 (LXX P0uß7)v): "The Lord hath looked upon my affliction" (see Driver, Genesis, ad loc.). The name, according to Jos. means "he had come to her through the mercy of God". His etymology is independent of Scripture, and obscure. Ant. II, 100: Rubel (Reuben) is the spokesman in Jos. In Gen. 42, 10, "they"they said". Ant. II, 31: "... the pit, which was as good as dry."

I AND II, 1-200 Jewish Rabbinic tendency to avoid anthropomorphisms stands out here, in spite of Gen. 18, 8: "they (the three men) did eat". Thackeray (Loeb ed., ad loc.) quotes Philo De Abrahamo 23,118. Ant. I, 333: Gen. 22, 28: "he who striveth with God". Instead of God, Jos. says "an angel of God", showing a Jewish sensitivity to the idea of man directly encountering God. Ant. I, 224.226: "Morian mount". Jos. in identifying this mountain does not follow either Heb. or LXX (Gen. 22, 2), but probably a Rabbinical tradition. Table Table J Instances in which the chronology of Josephus differs from the Hebrew and/or LXX: Ant. I, 67: Gen. 5, 3f. says that Adam was 130 years old when he begat Seth, and lived a further 800 years. Jos. following LXX, says that he was 230 years old, and lived a further 700 years (cf. Ant. I, 83). Ant. I, 148: see Loeb ed., ad loc. The total of years from the Flood to the birth of Abraham is in the Heb. 292, and in the LXX 1072 (Gen. 11, 10-26). Jos. makes the total 993. The mss. of Jos. however are not unanimous on the figure: in RO it is 993, but the other main mss. group gives 293. Niese and Naber follow RO. The explanation could be that there has been an editorial attempt to equate the text of Jos. with the Heb. Ant. II, 176: The number of Jacob's sons and grandchildren, see Table E. Table Table K Instances of Josephus' vocalisation: Ant. I, 54: ". . . Abel came with milk and the firstlings of his flocks". "Milk" is an interesting and specific example of Jos. use of a different vocalisation of the Heb. hlb: Gen. 4, 4 reads "fat", also the LXX (errsaTojv), but Jos. ignores this vocalisation in favour of his own. What conclusions are to be drawn from the evidence which has been tabulated above? Josephus' policy of "hellenizing" Biblical names is clearly set out. Does the evidence show that his policy was successful, and that it was carried out carefully and accurately? The</page><page sequence="12">R. J. H. SHUTT 178 same questions apply to the meanings of the names which Josephus makes a practice of interpreting. These and similar questions can be specified without much difficulty, and some assessment can be made in answer to them. But the questions and the answers are complicated by the matter of the Biblical test or texts used by J osephus: accuracy and precision are here unattainable. Josephus had in mind primarily readers who knew Greek, and who were not familiar with the Jewish Scriptures in their original language. Hence his desire to "hellenize" the Jewish Scriptures, in the general sense of writing in Greek about the history of the Jewish people contained in those Scriptures, and in the particular sense of giving to the Hebrew names Greek forms, which would sound more familiar in their ears. So a general background of hellenistic (non Jewish) thought is assumed. Table A gives examples of additions which illustrate this point. The first two are striking. Josephus says (Ant. II, 73) that the baker was "crucified", not hanged as in Gen. 40, 19. Crucifixion was the form of capital punishment reserved in Josephus' time under the Roman Empire for non-Roman citizens, and so would be more familiar to his readers. In the second example (Ant. I, 196), Abraham is described as sitting "before the door of his courtyard". Gen. 18, 1 (Heb. and LXX) says that he was sitting before the door of his tent. Courtyard is more consistent with a Greek or Roman house than the tent of a nomad. It is clear that Josephus keeps his readers in mind, because they would be more familiar with a courtyard than a tent: it is also clear that he does not regard such a change in the original as inconsistent with his "transla tion" from the Hebrew records. Josephus therefore as a translator does not consider himself obliged to keep too close to the original. He is at liberty to amplify the text when it suits his purpose: Potiphar, he says, for example, "gave (Joseph) a liberal education" (Ant. II, 39), but it is an amplification which does not add much to the under standing of the narrative. Table B gives two typical examples, showing how Josephus adopts the form of the name and the familiar meaning common to the Hebrew and the Septuagint text. These examples are illustrative, without being especially significant: special significance would only have attached to them if the form of the name or the meaning ascribed to it differed from that in the Hebrew or Greek source. So far, the evidence provided has been straightforward, and its interpretation likewise. But in Tables C and D, the interpretation of</page><page sequence="13">179 BIBLICAL NAMES IN JOS. ANT. I AND II, 1-200 the evidence becomes more complicated. Table C shows instances in which the "hellenized" names follow the forms found in the Hebrew text of Genesis rather than the Septuagint version. Table D shows instances in which the forms in the Septuagint are followed, rather than the Hebrew. These instances show that Josephus was aware of, and—what is more important—used, the Biblical text of Genesis in both Hebrew and Greek. It is important to establish this, although it is not very much. The following of one version rather than the other underlines the fact that with all the similarities between the Hebrew and the Septuagint, textual differences which now exist may also have existed in the time of Josephus. But this evidence is not sufficient to enable us to identify with anv certainty the text of Josephus' Septuagint. It may be tempting to compare the total of instances in Table C with that in Table D, and to draw conclusions on the basis of these numbers: but it is dangerous. Table C has four instances, showing equation with the Hebrew form: Table D has about twenty five, showing equation with the LXX form. It cannot be concluded, on the basis of those figures alone, that Josephus has a decided preference for the LXX version, but it can be said that this preponderance of instances in Table D underlines his dependence upon the LXX in the matter of names. This is not surprising, because since Josephus promised to "hellenize" names he could be expected to turn to the Greek version of those names in the LXX for the purpose of his hellenization. Even so, there remains for him the task of providing the Greek endings for the names, and this is a feature absent from the LXX, which only gives a transliteration of the Hebrew original. His interest is not confined to the LXX version, however, and the four instances in Table C show that on occasion he showed a distinct preference for the Hebrew form, and his discrimination is noteworthy. Turning to Table D, we find in the instances given evidence of Josephus' dependence on the LXX for the form of his names. Some of the instances are worthy of comment: Ant. I, 64: Gen. 4, 20. Heb. Jabal. LXX Tcoßy)X. Josephus' helleni zation TwßyjXo!; is neat, based on the LXX. But when Josephus (Ant. Ill, 282) gives a rendering of the word, he says that it means "freedom". This is not precisely true, for the traditional meaning is "ram", which was associated with freedom and jubilee. Why does he give such a loose rendering? We can only conjecture. Perhaps Josephus thought it sufficient for his non-Jewish readers, saving time</page><page sequence="14">R. J. H. SHUTT 180 and space needed for fuller explanation. Perhaps Josephus was some what careless in these matters. Perhaps through lack of use during his long stay in Rome his Hebrew had become somewhat "rusty". (The popular etymology which he gives of Jerusalem (Ant. I, 180) is another example). The word 'IwßY)X0^ also provides evidence of mss. variation. Although most of the mss. read ©oßeXo;;, RO (Lat.) read ToußrjXoc, which is based on the Hebrew. There are other examples in Table D. In Ant. I, 163 etc. the form of the name Pharaoh is usually ®apa«07]c;. But in Ant. VIII, 151, the variation in the mss. could be interpreted as showing that for once J osephus simply wrote theLXX form Oapaw, without "hellenizing" it. The mss. variations are ®apaa&gt;v7jc; RO, rtv Oapaw SPLN,pharao Lat. In Ant. I, 277 difficulty again arises because of variation in the readings of the LXX mss, which have McxsXsO, and also Mac7s[xa0. We cannot be certain of the reading of the LXX ms. which Josephus used. In Table E, there is further confirmation of what has already been established, that Josephus used Genesis in Hebrew as a source. Of the instances given, Ant. I, 262.308 and Ant. II, 180 are clear and straightforward. Ant. I, 39 (Tigris) shows some confusion on the part of Josephus himself, for he gives the Aramaic form (Diglath) and translates the Hebrew. Is this due to ignorance or carelessness? It is certainly incorrect. The remaining instances show lack of unanimity in the Josephus mss.: Ant. II, 176: the number of the sons and grand children of Jacob is given as 70 or 75; Ant. I, 52: the meaning of Abel. This name according to the majority of mss. is derived from "nothing" (= ou0sv, following the Hebrew). We may assume with reasonable certainty that this is the preferable reading. But the other mss. read 7rsv0o;;, which represents another etymology of Abel. How did this variant come about? There is no evidence, but the conjecture may be hazarded that interest was showTn in the meanings ascribed by Josephus to Biblical names, and such a variant as tcsvOo^, inserted originally as a note, became incorporated into the text. An interest such as this is consistent with the general interest shown in Josephus' works in antiquity, because they shared common ground with the Bible. Table F contains more instances than Table E (Cf. the numbers of instances in Tables C and D). They are not complicated by any mss. variations, and in that respect are straightforward. They provide further evidence of discrimination by Josephus in favour of the LXX version. This must have been quite deliberate. The reason for this dis</page><page sequence="15">181 BIBLICAL NAMES IN JOS. ANT. I AND II, 1-200 crimination is less clear, as is the underlying policy—if indeed there was any such policy. On occasions he seems confused (e.g. Ant. I, 343: Benjamin, and Ant. I, 63: Lamech's children) and tries to combine the different versions of the Hebrew and Greek texts, so that any conclusion must be drawn with caution regarding the Hebrew and Greek Old Testament which he used (e.g. Ant. I, 346: the division of the Greek Genesis at the death of Isaac). As to his underlying policy in adopting the LXX version, it can be said that he had in mind the clarification of names for the benefit of non-Jewish readers: we can therefore conjecture that he expected Heroopolis ("city of Heroes": Ant. II, 84) to be more intelligible to such readers than the "land of Goshen". Or, even more simply, he may have decided that the LXX was much easier to "hellenize" than "Goshen". Tables G and H show Josephus' apparent independence of the Hebrew or LXX narrative. Here in particular two questions arise: first, Josephus' attitude to the Jewish Scriptures and his view of the nature of their inspiration, if he felt justified and free to make in dependent statements even in comparatively minor details; and secondly is there any authority for his independent statements, apart from what would appear to be a personal predilection. According to Josephus, for example, Noah's Ark was of four stories (Ant. I, 177): in Gen. 6, 16 (Heb. and LXX) it is of three stories, and no explanation of the variation is given. It may be thought that the difference is of little consequence, but is it consistent with Josephus' oft-repeated claims to accuracy? If it is thought sufficient to say that such a minor detail can be ignored, then we are bound to say that his accuracy does not always extend to details, and presumably depends upon and is in fluenced by other factors. We have to admit that Josephus shows some weakness in philology, as Thackeray says in his comment on Ant. I, 258 Esau and esauron, which Josephus says is the Hebrew for "shaggy": so too Josephus says that Eve "signifies mother of all (living)", Ant. I, 36; this is strictly incorrect. Occasionally we find, quite unexpectedly, a paraphrase, e.g. Ant. II, 117 (cf. Gen. 43, 9: "If I bring him not unto thee I shall have sinned against thee for ever".) "he would lay down his life along with him." His in dependent version on one occasion spoils the dramatic story (Ant. II, 169): the Hebrew and LXX versions say that Jacob did not believe the reports that Joseph was alive, but Josephus says, in a very in volved way, "he could deem none of these incredible", i.e. he believed them all. It is hard to find an adequate explanation of this variation.</page><page sequence="16">182 SHUTT, BIBLICAL NAMES IN JOS. ANT. I AND II, 1-200 One may conjecture that at times his Greek was uncertain. Similarly he says, (Ant. II, 31) "the pit ... was as good as dry". Gen. 37, 24, Hebrew and LXX, says that there was no water in it. The adverb txavw&lt;; translated "as good as", may be, as Thackeray suggests, due to a misreading of xsvofound in some LXX mss: if this is so then Josephus misread xsvoc, and we must conclude that he made a mistake through carelessness. It would be consistent with this conclusion in another instance (Ant. II, 122: Joseph and his brethren and Benjamin) to be satisfied with the text of Josephus which paraphrases Gen. 43, 29 loosely, and not to look for a possible corruption in the mss, the emendation of which would remove some of the looseness of the paraphrase. In some instances, the statements in Josephus can be ascribed to Rabbinic influence, directly or indirectly, especially in regard to the avoidance of anthropomorphic language ascribed to God (Table I). His own statement under this influence can even be contrary to that of Genesis (Gen. 18, 8, Ant. I, 197) showing that his concern for ipsissimaipsissima verba is not too sensitive. Chronology and numerals (Table J) are notoriously uncertain in ancient authors, so that too much weight cannot be attached to the instances cited. There is one instance of a vocalization of a Hebrew word by Josephus which differs from that of Genesis (Table K). The instance is isolated, and we do not know its source or the reasons for Josephus' adoption of it and his rejection of the Scriptural one. In the light of the evidence produced in the previous Tables, too much stress should not be placel upon it, in the absence of corroborative evidence from elsewhere.</page></plain_text>
