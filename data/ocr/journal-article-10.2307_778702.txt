<plain_text><page sequence="1">Spiritual Reactionaries After German Reunification: Syberberg, Foucault, and Others DIEDRICH DIEDERICHSEN TRANSLATED BY PETER CHAMETZKY Just as ancient peoples lived their past history in their imagination, in mythology, so we Germans have lived our future history in thought, in philosophy.

One is not totally misguided to be reminded of Zeev Sternhell's title Ni droite, ni gauche, which was discussed in Denis Hollier's analysis of the suspicion of fascism in the reception of Bataille, since Syberberg's book was published by the press that has put out not only most of the German editions of Bataille, but also the most important Bataille commentaries. But I fear that here the "ambiguity" is in reality practically nothing more than a "cover for a univocal fascism," which Hollier rejected in terms of the Collkge de Sociologie in October 55, and not "profound ambiguities, which are as such -as ambiguities-at the heart of what was thought."2 To reach this conclusion we must follow a trail that will take us past a Bataille translator and editor. Unfortunately, along this route we can no longer afford the luxury of being generous rather than suspicious investigative readers. We must be wary of some of the individuals, sites, and enterprises that we encounter and that were involved in the 1980s dismantling and disposal of the thinking of the German left of the 1970s (for which there were at least some good reasons). In the name of poststructuralism, and especially Foucault and Bataille, they have contributed to an amnesia coinciding with the unification of Germany, which reminds us of the German myths that are dispensed in place of a history forgotten, or mastered and left behind, as the whole world ground- lessly, hazardously, and prematurely entrusts the new nation with its search for identity. On the occasion of Germany's reunification, fashioning a national identity has become a widespread occupation, taken up by as many former leftists as rightists. Those who have posed the uncomfortable question as to why one needs such an identity have been isolated through elaborate press-and propaganda-efforts. Dissent over which materials can be used to create the foundations for an identity, and what historical necessity demands that nations develop identities at all, were by and large outmaneuvered with suggestive but vague comments. In this operation Syberberg certainly went too far, or too early, in the determination of the materials and in specifying their function. That is, at least when measured against what the official West German essayists could take at the time in terms of specificity, without coming into conflict with that which could only be hinted at: Germany's new demands for hegemony, its capacity for action, whether under U.N. auspices, as an economic power, as the leader of the European Community, or as a bulwark against the storm of 1.

That the conservative Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung (FAZ) joined the chorus of protest against Syberberg's Vom Ungliick und Gliick der Kunst in Deutschland nach dem Kriege (On the misfortune and fortune of art in Germany after the war), in a tone whose shrillness departed from its familiar mild manner, led to the suspicion that one of their own had simply come out into the open. Anti-Semitic "passages" were quickly searched out, identified as scandalous slogans, and cited repeatedly in warning. Yet a more careful reading of the book, rather than highlighting the differences in tone and literary manners, would have revealed its common ground with the workaday ideology of the FAZ. A symposium was quickly pulled together in Berlin. In the following days all the daily newspapers and even television reported on this pressing matter of state. Syberberg fans, among them Susan Sontag, were confronted with passages that even she found "shocking," although they had no effect on her evaluation of the value of Syberberg's art.3 Heiner Miiller moderated laconically, while the audience provided occasional right extremist interruptions. Only Klaus Theweleit attacked Syberberg directly. Syberberg was supported by his favorite actress, Edith Clever, who lamented the collapse of standards under democracy: according to her, everything had become too crude. It's no news that Syberberg sees himself as a victim of the cultural bureau- cracy. He already stormed against mass and oppositional culture more than a decade ago, in Die freudlose Gesellschaft (The joyless society), and again in 1984 in Der Wald steht schwarz und schweigt (The forest stands black and quiet), whose breathless tone no longer even tried to conceal the signs of a sensibility clouded by paranoia. The most often cited sentence from the "misfortune book": "One could make a career out of consorting with Jews or leftists, forming bonds that had nothing to do with love, or understanding, or even inclination. Jews must have put up with this since they wanted power."4 This followed immediately on the formulation about "art without Volk,5 made cheaper, more comfortable, and disposable, as punk, pop, or junk." The model for this could be read more than ten years earlier in Die freudlose Gesellschaft, directed there against people who wore jeans and sneakers, and anyone else whose clothes were not the stuff of which either a state or a national identity could be made. Only one review responded in a friendly way to Syberberg in 1990. Bernd Mattheus published it in the clerical-conservative weekly Rheinischer Merkur- Christ und Welt (Rhein mercury-Christ and world). Mattheus is known for his aphorisms and as an essayist, and wrote a two-volume "Thanatography" of 3. For this and other information I am indebted to an unpublished manuscript by Hubert Winkel, excerpts of which were published in the Hamburg journal Tempo in October 1990. 4.

In 1985 he and publisher Axel Matthes edited the anthology Ich gestatte mir die Revolte (I approve of revolt), published by Matthes's Matthes &amp; Seitz Verlag.6 In this anthology texts by classic conservative and cultural pessimist authors such as Ernst Jiinger, E. M. Cioran, Ludwig Klages, and Leon Bloy were published alongside radicals and insurrectionists of all kinds, such as Artaud, Bataille, Carl Einstein, Marcel Broodthaers, and Oswald Wiener. In it there were also some signal passages from the publisher that conform astonish- ingly, and not only stylistically, to the tone struck by Syberberg in 1990 and before. Take, for example, this statement against what Matthes, based on hear- say, referred to as "radical chic": "prestige, stereotypical and mediocre as the fashion for a heterosexual hairdresser and a lesbian mother. Godard's films strive for radicality, as do Achternbusch's productions, and the intellectually chichi, overly rebellious pubescent fantasies of a Rainald Goetz, which is similar to what I see in the apocalyptic dandyism of late Beuys. The punk poseur yearns for rankings and unambiguous relations just as much as the organization man. And is the computer freak going about his business any different?"7 And against the postmodern: "The thesis that only the endless resurrection of the already familiar is possible I take for the argument of the entertainer in a whorehouse society."8 Finally, he comes out against an "anthropomorphic" (where anthro- pocentric is probably what he means) zeitgeist, which has no clue as to true radicality. It is a sign of the passage of seven years' time that Syberberg speaks now only about "pop, punk, and junk," as if he can no longer even take the time to name what he finds diffuse, threatening, dirty, and above all, frivolous. Before, while not taking the trouble to examine and test the grounds for his hate of the contemporary whorehouse culture under examination, at least the names of some randomly attacked persons were mentioned-Beuys, Goetz, Godard, Achternbusch-none of whom he was apparently very familiar with, as well as putative signs of the times-punks, computer freaks, heterosexual hairdressers. Syberberg does not seem to have noticed the tautology in using terms like punk or junk to criticize people who had already characterized their production methods according to those same terms. It is too late to search for other allies among the critics of commodification, probably because despite the constant conjuring up of a mentality dedicated to empty consumption and dissipation, it is slowly emerging that something else is really at issue: as opposed to the depressive Matthes of 1985, Syberberg in the meantime has a new hope. Indeed, his book is not only about misfortune, 6. Bernd Mattheus and Axel Matthes, eds., Ich gestatte mir die Revolte (Munich: Matthes &amp; Seitz, 1990). 7.

But before that can accrue, much has to disappear, as fast as possible, that could endanger the new identity. Syberberg publishes in various normally respected, liberal, mainstream presses. Diogenes was the last one before Matthes &amp; Seitz. His first book for Matthes &amp; Seitz, as we shall see, shocked even Matthes, a publisher who, after all, was quite familiar with the tendency. From Syberberg's preface it appears that the press wanted an introductory positioning that would perhaps obscure what, in fact, could not be missed. Syberberg knuckles under and names his heroes: Anselm Kiefer, Andrei Tarkovskii, Thomas Bernhard; in politics Gor- bachev, Vaclav Havel, and Walesa; then Ernst Jfinger, Heidegger, and even Hannah Arendt, before he loses himself in biblical, mythical, and ancient fig- ures.9 A year later, a few of these names (Jiinger, Heidegger) show up again when Axel Matthes writes, in his contribution to the Matthes &amp; Seitz yearbook Der Pfahl (The pole), about the "philistine fellow travelers among German intellectuals," who are described in connection with what had by then been transformed from the "Syberberg Debate" into the "Syberberg Affair."' Theo- dor W. Adorno received an unexpected place of honor here ("despite his rash malice toward Heidegger, Spengler, and Sibelius, he was an outstanding An- arch") among such leading figures of German "neoconservatism" (to put it discreetly) as Carl Schmitt, Spengler, etc. Matthes cited Adorno from 1947: "Stalin just clears his throat and they throw Kafka and van Gogh on the dung heap." This is then applied without adjustment to our own liberal-infested culture: "In the meantime, a magazine editor only needs to complain about Syberberg and these combat-league types shun the author, the artist, and the whole publishing house." The particularly comic element is the comparison of Stalin with the man implicated here, the rather harmless Mr. Karasek, an editor for Der Spiegel who most enjoys providing a genial gloss under a pseudonym or writing about Woody Allen, and whose most radical gesture was apparently the admission more than ten years ago that he could enjoy a James Bond movie. This is made worse by Matthes's inflationary false relationships: Karasek is worse than Stalin, the crime of shunning Syberberg more dangerous than the dung heap for Kafka and van Gogh. That Adorno suffers for all this is certainly symptomatic. We must cite a further source, the anthology published in 1978 by the Berlin Merve Verlag called Das Schillern der Revolte (The shimmer of revolt), which stood not only at the beginning of the reception of recent French theory among the (former) German left, but which also introduced the rather remark- able career of the concept of revolt that finds its provisional end in Syberberg's 9.

Before Schillern, Merve described itself as primarily a press of "international Marxist dialogue." Besides Sohn-Rethel, Merve published Toni Negri and others who, back then, were referred to as "undogmatic leftists." The direct precursors of this anthol- ogy were publications on Italian autonomist groups (such as broadcast tran- scripts from the radio station "Alice A/traverso") and German translations of Foucault, Althusser, and Deleuze/Guattari. In Schillern, German followers of the still variously used French novelties spoke out for the first time. Until then Foucault and Deleuze/Guattari, as well as Derrida, were only known to a small group of specialists. The huge success of Klaus Theweleit's Male Fantasies, with its many footnotes and references, especially to Foucault and to Deleuze/Guat- tari's Anti-Oedipus, which first appeared in Germany in 1976, laid the ground- work for the general interest. The authors of Schillern included such diverse types as the former SDS'2 activist Frank B6ckelmann, who in the early 1960s along with Dieter Kunzelmann founded "Subversive Action" (an organization derived from the German section of the Situationist International), and later became a "catastrophe theorist" and cofounder and editor of the journal Tumult-Zeitschrift fiir Verkehrswissenschaft (Tumult-Journal of transportation theory); Dietmar Kamper, today among the Republic's best-known professors; and the Foucault translators Walter Seitter and Ulrich Raulff. Seitter departed from the "Karl Marx litany"'3 and suggested a new way of reading May 1968, whose symbol would now be "the black flag of anarchy and the colorful, poetic wall slogans." Actually the established left was finished off in France in 1968 in a way that was not possible in Germany, given that there had been no established left in Germany in the postwar period. The German Communist party (KPD) was banned in 1956, the Social Democrats excised the concept of "class struggle" in the Godesberg Program of 1959, and in the 1950s it was nearly impossible to see a Brecht play on a Western stage. The diverse Maoist sects that were founded in the wake of the German student movement, the so-called K-Groups (KPD, KPD/ML KBW, KB, etc.), which atomized in the 1970s due to internal splits, seem a repetitive parody of the history of world communism. Rigidity and party discipline were exaggerated, and despite total political meaninglessness they believed they were involved in front-line struggle, unified with the working class. Characteristically, some of the K-Groups agreed with the official Chinese line that declared Soviet "social imperialism" to be the primary foe, with NATO as a lesser evil. So, the idea of a unified, socialist Germany could be an aim 11.

The other part of the movement, meanwhile, either "marched through the institutions" or carried on an "armed struggle."4 Around the end of the 1970s, the K-Groups began to break up, and their former members in many cases filtered into the ranks of the Spontis, citizens action groups, and other "autonomous" or "micropolitical" movements. The same time saw the beginning of the German reception of a new French theory, whose texts, however, were generally then about a decade old. The "liquidation" of one's own past in a K-Group seems to have gone on at about the same pace and with the same smoothness as the late 1980s transformation of theorists from orthodox Marxism or Critical Theory to Systems Theory. In that a French theory was used that already stood in opposition to the orthodoxy of the established left, some fought to exorcise their own Stalinism and that of the K- Groups as if it had had a meaning either to the individuals or the groups that it never really did. This Stalinism itself had been a hysterical answer to the lack of a history of communism in Germany. As such, the fight against it was a farce without force that possessed some charming aspects of youthful scout's-honor- type clannishness, which aside from a few small psychodramas has no real blood on its hands. Its "genesis anamnesis" would have sufficed to accomplish a kind of Protestant self-flagellation, if in this act of contrition about the arrogance of assuming political importance a new nostrum had not swept everything under the rug: that we all have skeletons in the closet and need to transform ourselves as quickly as possible into responsible and compromising democrats, whether in the Green party or somewhere else. Such a past for Seitter is indeed not known. But that one had to perceive May '68 totally differently was a message warmly greeted all over at the begin- ning of the 1980s: suddenly it was a totally different May, not the May of the enrages and the Situationists, not the May of Maoists and the General Strike; instead it was the May of poetry and Cohn-Bendit, the May that led directly to Ariane Mnouchkine and Jerome Savary, and no longer to Guy Debord or Jacques Mesrine or Malcolm McLaren. Colorful, carnivalesque fantasies vied everywhere for power. The texts in Schillern can be explained in relation to their historical context in that they make arguments against a left-wing common-sense approach that had, in its time, become frigid and made peace with the social democratic cultural bureaucracy. The changes of 1977/78 also play into the fact that the 14. The "march through the institutions" was an emphatically proclaimed battle cry of the project of altering society from within, announced around the time of the dissolution of the SDS and APO (Auflerparlementarische [extra-parliamentary] Opposition), which actually turned out to be a euphemism for career building in the culture industry and cultural bureaucracy. "Armed struggle" means the Red Army Faction.</page><page sequence="8">72 OCTOBER social democratic culture used Marxist positions and explanations in a repressive way. Indeed, even the developer of the computerized search used against the Red Army Faction and other political deviants, BKA President Herold,'5 ex- plained his concept with Marxist notions. With that, Germany had gotten its belated Communist party, as the dialectic of its particular enlightenment. But the self-punishment that allowed leftist intellectuals to negate their own politi- cization was directed only against themselves and their milieu, not against social democratic power. In this way it was different from the contemporaneous rise of punk rock. In the course of this act of contrition, which is the affirmative antithesis of revision, the anti-Fascist roots of the politicization of German intellectuals was forgotten: all that remained was the false choice of two possible readings of May '68. Finally, Seitter said in 1978: "The solitaire is also a touch- stone of politics." This became the favorite figure in endless anthologies and publishing-house brochures from the post-left, from Konkursbuch Verlag to Matthes &amp; Seitz: even the many different authors and traditions that came together in these publishing houses could all be ascribed the position of the solitaire, if necessary in crude dust-jacket blurbs. And the only imaginable correct attitude for a solitaire was called revolt. What appeared in all innocence on the cover of Schillern, has by today become one of the most overused and beloved pieces of cheap praise dished up in blurbs and on talk shows in the Federal Republic for the easiest type of unaccommodating thought: thinking against the grain (Querdenken). But the future solitaires and insurrectionists were not to be fobbed off by that. "It's a type of subversion that stops at nothing, certainly not at the my- thology of the respective identities of revolutionary groups or individuals," wrote Robert Mfiller and Michael Makropoulos about the new thought that is now supposed to take the place of "leftist" thought.16 This is in an essay that was not only important then for providing a theory of the Punk Movement in Germany, but whose use of Foucault and Deleuze/Guattari to explain the pitiful state of student life at the time is also exemplary today. It wasn't just these "identities" that could really get on one's nerves then. It was the time of left- wing homilies of party-line conformism and a type of solidarity with the Third World that projected onto others the misery of one's own regression and safely identified and summed up someplace else's structure of contradictions. Against this a "subversion" was demanded that would battle against capitalism in the name of the margins and of escapes, and these demands were bolstered with exciting quotations from this new and unknown body of thought. (In 1978 it was still pretty much unchallenged that the struggle was against capitalism, as 15. BKA, Bundeskriminalamt, Federal Crime Bureau.-Trans. 16.

At the end of their text Muiller and Mak- ropoulos quoted a bon mot or aphorism of a certain Gerd Bergfleth, printed in poetic form. A few years later a text by Bergfleth appeared in an anthology published by Matthes &amp; Seitz called Zur Kritik der palavernden Aufkliirung (Cri- tique of the palavering Enlightenment), which for the first time brought on the charges of anti-Semitism against a Matthes &amp; Seitz book-charges leveled by the Hamburg journal Spuren, among others." Authors who up until then had published with the press, such as Elisabeth Lenk, who had worked on surrealism and provided the first Bataille edition for Matthes &amp; Seitz, withdrew their manuscripts." Matthes &amp; Seitz was at the time the German press that, along with Merve, most thoroughly and partisanly published long-neglected French texts in Germany. Bataille, Artaud, Laure, Leiris, and Barthes were brought out by Matthes &amp; Seitz. When Baudrillard's Symbolischer Tausch und der Tod (Symbolic exchange and death) appeared in 1982, the publisher Matthes pro- vided the book with a long afterword by Bergfleth (against the author's wishes), and proceeded the same way again when Die Gattliche Linke (The holy left) appeared.19 This time one afterword did not suffice: in addition to the Russian art theorist Boris Groys, two authors were included who hardly required ex- posure as members of the radical right wing in Germany. One is Hans Dietrich Sander, editor of the right extremist journal Staatsbriefe (Letters of state) and author of such texts as "The National Imperative-Plans and Components for the Remaking of Germany" and "On the Spiritual Bondage of the Germans and Its Possible Alleviation." The other is Giinther Maschke, a slippery figure who originally went to Cuba as a leftist, took part in a putsch attempt against Castro, and returned as a right-wing theorist and philologist. He has devoted much work to Carl Schmitt, the constitutional lawyer who provided a justifica- tion for Hitler's Enabling Act, and who is now enjoying a widespread renais- sance.20 Today, Maschke is editing the work of Schmitt's Spanish precursor, Juan Donoso Cortes. That Maschke and Sander publish with Matthes &amp; Seitz hardly troubles those intellectuals who all these years have gotten their Bataille and Oswald Wiener, their Baudrillard and Panizza from the same source. Only Baudrillard himself is troubled, since he has to read his afterwords.2' 17. Gerd Bergfleth et al., Zur Kritik der palavernden Aufklirung (Munich: Matthes &amp; Seitz, 1984). 18. See note 3. 19.

His defenders describe this as the "committed antifascism" of an admittedly eccentric and particularly radical German adherent of poststructuralism, simply because Bergfleth (again, in his 1991 contribution to the Matthes &amp; Seitz anthology Der Pfahl) quotes alertly from Foucault:22 The people (Volk) have achieved what only Beethoven's Ninth has before: they have rocked the world. All the stigmas affixed to them have been erased, all their supposed servility overcome. . . . The German Democratic Republic's popular movement represents the real Germany, which has been betrayed by West Germans in favor of the capitalist, liberal economic epidemic that eats away the collective body (Volkskiirper) of the people.23 Betrayed to a cult of technology that is laying waste to the land, and to cosmopolitan contradictions that are designed to achieve the destruction of Germany's folk character (Volkscharakter). Liberalism is the vanguard of European/Atlantic nihilism.... Lifting the occupation on both sides, together with an armed, independent, unified Germany is the minimum required ... because rebirth requires a popular, racial (volkmdfiige) renewal that still lies ahead for West Germans. Only when this deracinated pop- ulace (Unvolk) rises up against its technological, American servitude will it be ready as a free people to unite with the free people the GDR. The popular uprising in the GDR is the first act of a national uprising of all Germans, at the end of which will result unity for the nation, the German Reich.24 Four years earlier Rolf Grimminger had confronted Axel Matthes with passages such as this one from Bergfleth, an author in whom Matthes had shown such an interest." Grimminger: Your author Bergfleth published an essay in which pernicious untruths glide by, restoring volkisch national myths that approach those of National Socialism. How do you as publisher react to this scandal? Matthes: Your reading, which you share with others of leftist 22. Gerd Bergfleth, "Finis Mundi," in Der Pfahl, no. 5, p. 8. 23.

Deutsches Worterbuch vonJacob Grimm und Wilhelm Grimm, V. 12/2 (Rudolf Meiszner, ed., Leipzig: Hirzel 1951, Munich: ETV, 1984, p. 486).

Comparisons were made with Ro- senberg and Streicher. One does not read what one reads, one reads what one is. Grimminger: Just a moment, I'll cite Bergfleth in the original: "That enlight- ened Jewry in the rule has no sense of... the special German character ... romantic aspirations . . . recollections of the pagan Germanic past." Or even worse: "So the new Enlightenment breeds a nonperson . . . a German, a European, an American, Jew or whatever, anything but himself. Then, thanks to the liberal reeducation that was completed after the defeat in the War, he becomes a guest worker in his own country . . . who is charitably cultivated by the left-wing master cynics of the Enlightenment mafia." That's enough. Matthes: I know, Bergfleth challenges our self-assured Zeitgeist, breaking a West German taboo, especially among intellectuals, to whom, as a publisher, I also belong. I can understand my own agitation, since I was raised intellectually on a diet of Benjamin and Adorno. Bergfleth is no philo-Semite, and in the Federal Republic, there exists a philo-Semitism that is just as unfree as it is hypocritical. But Bergfleth . . . is not a racist anti-Semite. No more than Nietzsche! ... Adorno came out sharply against Dvorak, Rachmaninoff, Tchai- kovsky, but does that make him anti-Slavic? And again, Adorno. It's not only that their early intellectual diet no longer seems so healthy that these spirits laden down by too much philo-Semitism keep bringing him up. It's also of course because of his critique of the culture industry, his disinclination for jazz and American popular culture, about which he had vague conceptions similar to those Syberberg has about junk and punk, and Matthes about Godard and computer freaks. And because he was marked by turn-of-the-century bourgeois artistic taste, to which the reactionary music lover can always warm. As in Dialectic of Enlightenment, where general charac- teristics of the culture industry are supposed to be discussed, the discussion is, on the one hand, only about the New Deal films, with frequent references to Frank Capra plots or, on the other, to Cecil B. DeMille extravaganzas, although by the time the book was written conclusions based on this aspect of the culture industry were already becoming obsolete. So, too, the whole agitation of Syber- berg, Bergfleth, and Matthes is directed against cultural productions and events that are seen as threatening because they defy orderly comprehension. The poststructuralist and deconstructionist aesthetes, freed from left-wing positions, make increasingly seductive offers to dispose of the waste products lying on the cultural slag heap by sorting out the culture industry and its supposed products into-depending on their degree of right wing radicality-"American," "for- eign," "artificial," and all the way to "Jewish." Only a gigantic clean-up effort seems to make possible the reconstruction of the identity promised by the blurb on the Syberberg cover (undoubtedly by Matthes). According to Syberberg: "We have been taken over by the plastic world. When we climb into a car, a plane, aboard ship, when we purchase today's kitchen, let ourselves into today's TV world, from the studio and substance to the image of the world, we enter the</page><page sequence="12">76 OCTOBER world of artificial chemical universes. . . . Computers are made from this substance, and with it our thought, memories, the simulation of life."''26 Syberberg's attack, written in bizarrely bad German, against the genuine- ness and authenticity of a "substance" that apparently has more to fear from a harmless computer casing than from the chips inside, which are still being made from silicon, bears out the interpretation not only of Syberberg's text, but also of the success of his polemic, offered by the Dutch media theorist Geert Lovink in Mediamatic. Lovink reads Ungliick and the other theory best-seller embraced in the same year by German sentimentalists, George Steiner's Von Realer Gegen- wart (On the real present), as nostalgic attempts to (re)construct authenticity by a kind of cultural ecology. If we could only free ourselves from the mass of obscuring media data that surrounds us, if we could be done with secondary discourse, "real presence" (Steiner) or Prussia rather than Israel, plastic and punk (Syberberg) would set in. Lovink closes: Steiner and Syberberg fill a need. For the time being, experiments with electronic art are open-ended and offer no certainty in the unstable art world. So the call for a return to the Authentic can count on public approval. The overkill, however, which is real, is a logical consequence of the new media's phase of introduction onto the mar- ket. This will regulate itself via restraints and bankruptcies, irrespec- tive of the authenticity wrapper. The drumroll of the oaken sticks on tightly stretched pig's bladders which can be heard at fetes and street festivals (amplified or not) is at present passing before us in the media's consolidation phase, followed by an authentic tape of 60s music and the latest technodisco. It is for lack of a primary media theory that Syberberg and Steiner can not only lash out so naively and conservatively, but on top of it get discussed as ground-breaking thinkers. If enough were known about the connections and technical possibilities of the media (and its history), such contributions would instantly be lost in the everyday multicultural shuffle.27 It is precisely this "shuffle" that is Syberberg's biggest concern. The evil scent of an overly powerful villain, the multicultural society, wafts through the book. Syberberg smells the clear morning air for the first time in the last part of the book, written after the opening of the Wall. "And suddenly it became clear why it all had to disappear: the center, the consciousness of unity and of collapse triumphed up to the catastrophe, to which it had to lead, like furies of the European disappearance from the center of its life force with pop neuroses, 26.

Where a new beginning can only be like an archaic origin from the center of losses, if the truth of feelings regulates reason, where true tears and laughter banish everything unnatural."28 Walter Seitter deals with the new conditions more soberly, and in better German. His lectures on the Nibelungenlied appeared regularly in the 1980s in Merve Verlag, after he had already written on Lacan and translated and edited Foucault.29 In these he regularly recommended the reading of the Nibelungen as an example of Foucault's "ethnology of one's native culture" (Ethnologie der eigenen Kultur). One would certainly find that strange upon realizing that Fou- cault's sketch of an ethnology, one which "instead of defining itself in the first place-as it has done until now-as the study of societies without history ... deliberately . . . seek[s] its object in the area of the unconscious processes that characterize the system of a given culture,"30 could hardly have meant that the Nibelungenlied would provide insights in this sense into the unconscious processes that characterize the system of the given (German) culture. And this not only because the Nibelungenlied has behind it a whole reception history as a state mythology, which Seitter is much less interested in illuminating than its "political wisdom." In principle, though, rash applications such as this are attractive, since they at least oppose the lame cult of admiration that prevails among academics. Seitter, born in 1941, is himself an idiosyncratic special case (indeed, a solitaire) whose lecture style is just as unique-he articulates every syllable as if it has a magical power-as his surprising couplings among things traditionally kept separate. Both Nibelungen books are decorated on the interior cover with photographs by Helmut Newton, one of Seitter's personal aesthetic obsessions. The others are Anselm Kiefer and ... Syberberg. His method was conspicuous early on for its admixture of philological thoroughness and original simplifi- cation. Seitter believes in precision, in thorough analytical work ("not theory, not speculative summarizing, instead work").31 He believes in finding the best, correct expression for an idea, just as he does in clarity of articulation. Therefore one can also assume that the use of the word "right," connoting both a political and a correct position, can not be an accidental ambiguity in the title of his essay "On the Right Use of the French."32 28.

Seitter, "Vom rechten Gebrauch der Franzosen," Tumult 15 (Vienna, 1991).</page><page sequence="14">78 OCTOBER There is much that astonishes in this essay, including the heart of the argument. Seitter is an Austrian and likes to refer to Austria as "the German southeast corner." He recommends to Germans an "ethnocentrism," which he again ennobles as the application of a Foucaultian "ethnology of the native culture." The models he offers for this are his own work on the Nibelungen and Benjamin's The Origin of German Tragic Drama. German ethnocentrism is cer- tainly blooming on every level. And it is certainly questionable whether Germany can serve as a proper subject for an ethnology of native culture, since who can draw the distinction between what is "native" and what "foreign"? And to what end? Above all, what will have to be cleared away and shut out before starting on the "native"? Certainly the "multiculture" so suspect to Syberberg, certainly also oppositional, mass, and pop culture. Probably also the internationalism of the established arts. (Seitter is more circumspect here: "I am not referring to contemporary artistic production. I do not want to pronounce a global judg- ment, but allow me the remark that for me neither the internationalism of the cult of state opera stars, nor that of Viennese avant-gardism, are of interest.")33 A development preceded such political positionings: in the afterword to the anthology of Foucault interviews that he edited, Vom Subversion des Wissens (On the subversion of knowledge), Seitter still approved of Foucault's friendship with Althusser and grounded Foucault's departure from the Communist party emphatically in its "support for the state."34 Now not only does he give the new German state advice on its internal structure, he plays off Foucault as a friend of the Germans against the less "German-friendly" Gilles Deleuze, using Eribon's Foucault biography and the description in it of the split between Foucault and Deleuze, which had to do with their assessments of the Red Army Faction and whether one should give them unqualified support or only make sure that members got political asylum in France. Foucault had, according to Seitter, praised Erhard's "social market economy" and allowed himself an "anxious optimism" as regards Germany. Finally, in passing, Seitter takes care of the second most famous Frankfurt School belief, from Horkheimer: "He who would discuss fascism must also discuss capitalism."35 He buries the lapidary unmasking of Germany's mistaken anticapitalism in a footnote: "Classic anti-Semitism is 33.

In the latest issue of Tumult, Seitter even speaks of the "antifascist consensus (Adorno/ Honecker)," which clearly refers to the duo Adorno/Horkheimer, and goes on to praise Helmut Newton, of all people, as "the only morally correct German intellectual" because he hasn't been part of this German postwar antifascism (Tumult 16 [Vienna, 1992], p. 119).</page><page sequence="15">Spiritual Reactionaries After German Reunification 79 also a form of anticapitalism-a particularly dumb one. This preliminarily applies also to antifascism." With that Seitter comically draws on a well-traveled bon mot by the founder of German Social Democracy, August Bebel: "Anti- Semitism is the fool's socialism." To repeat this after 1945 is not only odd: all over the world, and certainly in Germany, there is flagrant racism to which no anticapitalist sentiments can be ascribed. Is anti-Semitism then a special case of racism, a historical "mistake" of the same magnitude as anticapitalism? Is the observation that racialism as a result of a capitalist mode of production differ- entiates itself from all earlier "racisms"-to an extent that one can speak of the same phenomenon only when speaking in the most general terms-only a mistake of confused late Communists, all evidence to the contrary? A racialism that also survives unchallenged in liberal German writings: Spiegel can only manage to write about the events in Los Angeles as "racial unrest" and "race riots," without even using the quotation marks. And is antifascism, which indeed usually also conceives of itself as anticapitalism, finally in truth closer to anti- Semitism than to its opposite? We are likewise amazed when, in a relatively inconspicuous place, Seitter defines politics as: "Apartheit: the installation of relations among foreign peo- ples."36 Is the near homonym of this newly invented German word, Apartheit, supposed to connote that the "Apartheid" with which one is familiar is really not so bad-in fact, only politics? And it becomes clear that only Foucault's name remains from the rejection of ceremonies supporting the state and sym- pathy for the black flag, since Seitter now thinks that Bonn lacks "the classic minimum for political authority," a "statesman." In the social democratic 1970s in Germany, Foucault still stood for the left, whether or not it was anarchistic: today he delivers models for "genealogy," "archaeology," or "ethnology" to the nation born anew again. But one could, if interpreting generously, take all this for the eclectic slips of an independent scholar, whose leaps among references and preference for surprising borrowings were once an engaging method, and whose citations still reveal just as much of a debt to essays by such left radical authors as Wolfgang Pohrt.37 But it is rather sadly telling that this essay dedicated to the theme of "Frenchmen," which opened number fifteen of the journal Tumult, edited by Seitter, B6ckelmann, and Kamper, had already appeared in number six of Etappe. Etappe is an organ that hides its radical right-wing positions no better 36. In 1989 Seitter translated two Foucault lectures that were published by Merve under the title as Das Licht des Krieges (The light of war). There Foucault labels primary uprisings against sovereignty as "racism," but differentiates this term from the "state racisms" of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. This volume was also well-received by Etappe. 37. All quotations derive from the Seitter essay cited in note 32. Wolfgang Pohrt has recently emerged as a sharp critic of all the bluster about Germanity and of the more or less latent anti- Semitism of the left.</page><page sequence="16">80 OCTOBER than does its occasional author Maschke, even though these positions are inter- spersed with articles on Seitter, Lipowatz, or Foucault. Every other article is about the work of Carl Schmitt, and advertisements promote the products of the Karolinger Verlag, which belongs to the military historian Jean Jacques Langendorf. This author, who also publishes with Matthes and published in his own press among other things Gottfried Dietze's notorious Hitler-Komplex, a book that claims that this "complex" has been more disastrous for Germans than its cause. Sometimes one also comes across formulations in Etappe such as "certain philosophers of Jewish blood." What are Foucault and his translator doing in a place like this? Ernesto Laclau wrote in 1990: An initial reaction to this new intellectual climate has been to become entrenched in the defence of "reason" and attempt to relaunch the project of "modernity" in opposition to those tendencies considered "nihilistic." The work of Habermas is perhaps the most representative of this attitude. Our position, however, is exactly the opposite: far from perceiving in the "crisis" of reason a nihilism which leads to the abandonment of any emancipatory project, we see the former as opening unprecedented opportunities for a radical critique of all forms of domination, as well as for the formulation of liberation projects hitherto restrained by the rationalist "dictatorship" of the Enlightenment.38 In 1978 it might have been possible in Germany to write this; by 1990 it no longer seemed so. The connection of a critique of reason with projects of emancipation has at best contributed to a depoliticization and at worst to the right-wing radicalization of an intellectual generation. The old Marxist diagnosis of Germans' philosophical contemporaneity without historicity proves valid once again. In the 1980s not a single minority, counter-cultural, feminist, or antiracist movement of the type that would have moved beyond Green enviro-kitsch or simple peacenikdom could get a foothold, let alone link up with an emancipatory concept grounded in a critique of reason. The "nihilistic" three P's (punk, poststructuralism, postmodernism) erased from experience and memory what they once wanted or were supposed to correct and bring up to date: a frigid and rigid culture of emancipation, as well as its origins. But their precursors were not at all socially grounded: one political hysteria could be easily exchanged for another; one didn't even need to change philosophies. Today professors in Germany wonder how and why in the United States Derrida and Foucault can be used in the struggles of feminists or African Americans. Hubert Winkels has uncovered in his research a wealth of personal con- 38.

Actually, in spite of everything, it is not my intention to place Seitter on the same level as Syberberg. One can still hope that the path from a poetic interpretation of May to publishing along with the common anti- Semites is a dangerous wrong turn taken by this right-wing Foucaultian, which is typical for disoriented, displaced times. Syberberg, on the other hand, drifted off long ago into a zone where he can no longer be reached by the crowing of the Gallic cock. In the confrontation with these specters one is thrown back upon positions that one had thought to be either superfluous or self-evident. It is certainly irritating, though, that this expedition takes one into a time loop, at the beginning of which there was great hope. Around 1980 it actually seemed as if it would be possible to stage or weave together a worldwide synchronized "patchwork of minorities," as Lyotard called it so optimistically. When I published an earlier version of this text I often heard the charge, coming from well-intentioned postmodern corners, that I was giving voice to an outmoded differentiation of right/left that belongs to the same system of terroristic binarisms as white/black, man/woman, and so forth. Now then: the lines and formations that emerge from a sketch of the German fate of some "poststructuralist" and "francophile" thought perhaps deserve a new name, denoting this specific cultural pessimism, the components of which are dreams of originality (Urspriinglichkeit) and authenticity, along with a disinclination to- ward electronic, multicultural, and "foreign" arts. If Seitter, in the name of Foucault, commends a "rational, stable and flexible relationship to power," if he only sees "criminal regimes" in the former East and desires a real old- fashioned "statesman" in Bonn, he stands to the right of more than just those left-oriented journalists who want to see a country normalized and with com- mercial capacities (even if those economic and other interests promise no good for the rest of the world). However, the whole economic dimension, except for an old text by Kojeve, is miraculously suspended from consideration in the entire Tumult issue. As the diminished children of a Germany limited to economic action, my generation had the chance to perceive ethics (and what it forbids: crime) pri- marily on a global scale, even if the connections among global exploitation were still so "complex" that this could obscure the perception of global crime. A capitalism that is on the whole no longer even capable of exploitation, and which has therefore become inconspicuous, can be well used, in the name of Dumezil and Foucault, by German ethnocentrics and those who decree the "reasonable contribution of [Germany] to the creation of a world power called Europe." The basic idea is simple and has been propagated in every type of recent German writing: Germany's problem is not self-interest, nationalism, 39. See note 3.</page><page sequence="18">82 OCTOBER desire for hegemony, etc.; rather, as Seitter says, it is "self-forgetfulness." Ger- mans tend to escapism, to the exotic, instead of finally becoming normal and politically capable. But only this German trait-it being the better one, if anything-would merit an "ethnology": emigration and the contributions that have been derived from a difference and a distance that have become our "own." The new writing, however, wants to hear as little about German emi- grants as the German politicians and the normal reactionaries want to hear about immigrants, to whom they react as if they can hardly be accommodated anymore. This is the response, whether it is to the writing of emigrants whose thought was formed while fleeing from the Nazis, or to the few more-acceptable figures in postwar German literature, such as Hubert Fichte or Rolf Dieter Brinkmann, who sketched a German literature in flight from the "German." Germany's state theater writer, Botho Strauss, who not long ago also published with Matthes &amp; Seitz, wrote the afterword for the German edition of the Steiner essay, and in it he repeatedly confessed allegiance to the "spiritual reactionary" (a self-evaluation) Nicolas Davila, whose name is dropped often in Etappe and Pfahl. Tracing connections in this manner might be reminiscent of the way a district attorney traces suspects, and all too often we got to know- at the time as punk rockers-the methodology of social democratic sociological powers: suspicious reading finding the Fascist suspect. But as long as the "right" hides behind ambiguities, there is nothing else to do. In Germany, unlike in America, Bataille and Foucault have not been authors whose work has been socially grounded and fruitful for "emancipatory movements," or whatever one wants to call them. Their reception made possible, in favorable cases, a depol- iticization, and in the unfavorable ones, as has been discussed here, a rehabili- tation of right-wing positions. Bataille did not make Syberberg, but a left that gave him over to Matthes &amp; Seitz cleared the way for the creation of an atmosphere in which Syberberg's publication could profit. In this new front, connections to fragmentary remains from Adorno have also been forged, while Derrida, for example, remains a scandal. The "de Man case" could be celebrated with pleasure by the right-wing FAZ as a "scandal of the leftists" and their "fashion," deconstruction. With the latest revelations about de Man, Der Spiegel has felt justified in its opinion that "deconstructionists" are the type of people who don't pay their rent on time. Meanwhile Adorno and the Frankfurt School have ascended to the level of stylites in the Frankfurt paper, where they are reduced to pure culture critics. Much maligned control mechanisms, such as those used by the "p.c." movement in America, are revealed as something Germany could well have used. Syberberg is someone who has always been somewhat off balance, and he would have therefore been viewed with suspicion by those who now form ranks in which he is accepted. This comes after years of having not been criticized by those who had their hands full clambering to the heights of postmodern reflection. The Gallic cock could crow itself hoarse.</page><page sequence="19">Spiritual Reactionaries After German Reunification 83 We have arrived at only this: we want our own beautiful culture and history, so we write our own little Foucaultian books about German odds and ends and cultivate our own Batailles. Seitter himself called this usage "right." Sylvere Lotringer said, in a recent interview in Artscribe, that Baudrillard is no longer interesting to him since he "has been so taken up by the new right."40 Please send definitions of "left" to the appropriate addresses. 40.
