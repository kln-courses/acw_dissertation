In 1909 the American Museum of Natural History mounted the Congo Expedition, led by scientist Herbert Lang with the assistance of James Chapin, which sought to explore the northeastern corner of what is now Zaire. In an attempt at thoroughness, Lang and Chapin spent the next five years studying, documenting, photographing, and collecting as much material as possible, primarily specimens of the flora and fauna of the region, but also ethnographic objects. They sent back to New York several thousand articles of the material culture of the Mangbetu and Azande which have been selectively assembled (together with additional objects from other museum collections) into a major exhibition mounted by the American Museum of Natural History. African Reflections is not a catalog for the exhibition, but a thorough discussion of the early 20th-century Congo Expedition, Western perceptions of the peoples and arts of northeastern Zaire, the ethnography and material culture of the major cultures in that re- gion, and art historical issues involving the anthropomorphic im- agery which is customarily associated with the region, particularly the human headed pottery and harps of the Mangbetu. Schildkrout and Keim's text is dense with information without being pedantic or making overuse of academic jargon. Distributed throughout the book are hundreds of black and white field pho- tographs taken by Chapin and color photos of many of the items in- cluded in the American museum exhibition. Several chapters are written by other respected Africanist scholars, including Vansina's essay on the history and political development of the Mangbetu, Demier and Miller on music and musical instruments, and Mack's survey of Azande art. What distinguishes this book and makes it of especial signifi- cance to those who study African art is the authors' challenge of the almost universally held assumption that the art and material culture now stored and displayed in many of the world's great museums, which was collected in the period of major exploration of the interior of Africa (the latter half of the 19th century and beginning of the African Studies Review, Volume 34, Number 3 (December 1991), pp. 107-61.</page><page sequence="2">AFRICAN STUDIES REVIEW 20th), was typical of the styles of Africa's many cultures. The authors' contention is that the acceptance of the concept of the "ethnographic present" as it relates to material culture belies the importance of change in African art. They demonstrate that the anthropomorphic pottery and sculptures which have until now been regarded as typical of Mangbetu art style, actually were part of an artistic development which occurred just prior to the arrival of the Congo Expedition. Further, they establish that such anthropomorphic art is not exclu- sively Mangbetu, but is found among other cultures in the region. The region of Africa where Zaire, the Central African Republic, and Sudan meet will most likely turn out to be extraordinarily impor- tant because it may offer important clues to the development of the art history of Central, Northeast, and East African art. While this is not a topic explored by Schildkrout and Keim, African Reflections is a ma- jor contribution to our understanding of Mangbetu and Azande art in particular and African art history in general.
