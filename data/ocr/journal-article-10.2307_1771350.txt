<plain_text><page sequence="1">MICHELLE E. BLOOM Pygmalionesque Delusions and Illusions of Movement: Animation from Hoffmann to Truffaut A "PYGMALION COMPLEX" AFFLICTS much of the literature of the nine- teenth century, according to Marie Lathers (36). Nineteenth-century tales representing the desire for the animation of the inanimate in "gynomorphic" form abound.1 As both Lathers's choice of the noun "complex," borrowed from Ross Chambers ("De grands yeux" 314), and her use of the verb "to afflict" suggest, in the nineteenth century Pygmalionesque desire is represented as an illness; in- deed the nineteenth-century counterparts of Ovid's King of Cyprus (Pygmalion) tend to be "mad." The "happily-ever-after" formula of Ovid's version of Pygma- lion in Book X of the Metamorphoses, in which the gynomorphic statue comes to life and its creator marries her, no longer applies to what J. Hillis Miller calls nineteenth-century "versions of Pygmalion." Rather, the Pygmalion myth fails or undergoes what I call "dissolution," as nineteenth-century Pygmalion figures experience the "Pygmalionesque delusions" of this essay's title-"delusions" that in turn metamorphose at the end of the century into "illusions of movement" made possible by the advent of cinema. The German romantic author E.T.A. Hoffmann's story "Der Sandmann" ("The Sandman," 1816-17) provides the point of departure for this study of the shift from "Pygmalionesque delusions" to "illusions of movement." The French sym- bolist Villiers de l'Isle-Adam's novel L'Evefuture (TheEve of the Future, 1886) is the focal point of this trajectory's second (literary) stage, which falls just before the transition to film. In the third section of the essay I argue that cinema usurped the "Pygmalionesque space" previously dominated by literature. I do so through a chronological study of three films: Georges Melies's turn-of-the-century silent short, Le Parapluie fantastique, ou dix femmes sous une ombrelle (Ten Women in One Umbrella, 1903); Karl Freund's 1935 Hollywood horror film Mad Love; and Fran:ois Truffaut's penultimate and most somber film, La Chambre verte (The Green Room, 1978). I I use the neologism "gynomorphic," which is the specifically female form of "anthropomorphic," because in most nineteenth-century versions of the story the inanimate figure is female.</page><page sequence="2">COMPARATIVE LITERATURE/292 This overview perhaps requires some explanation and qualification. First, by "literature" I mean primarily prose fiction. The short story was the most preva- lent narrative form of the nineteenth-century fantastic, practiced by Balzac, Gogol, Hawthorne, Maupassant and Poe, among others. Pygmalionesque desires are also represented in novellas and novels, such as Mary Shelley's Frankenstein (1817- 18), which is contemporaneous with "Der Sandmann," and fin-de-siecle texts in- cluding L'Eve future and Oscar Wilde's Picture ofDorian Gray (1891). Furthermore, although some of these texts might encourage us to distinguish between the animation of organic and inorganic matter (bodies and body parts versus the painting in Wilde's novel, for instance), I believe that their similarities-both are "dead" (literally or figuratively) when they are inanimate-outweigh their differences.2 Consequently, I will treat a reanimated corpse as analogous to a statue come to life because both challenge the distinctions between life and non- life. The frequency of hybrid organic/inorganic forms, as in "Der Sandmann" and Frankenstein, supports this approach. The third issue I want to clarify is that when I argue below that cinema be- comes the privileged space of the Pygmalionesque, I am making the (relatively) modest claim that cinema becomes the favored but not exclusive medium of the fantastic, dominating but not monopolizing the twentieth century's Pygmalion- esque space. The phrase "Pygmalionesque space" is a deliberately vague term, because I want to suggest not only that cinema took over the role of representing Pygmalionesque desire, even Pygmalionesque desire gone awry, but also that the very medium embodies the longstanding human desire for the animation of the inanimate. Even when the Pygmalion paradigm fails in film, the medium itself succeeds in creating the illusion of movement. As this statement implies, the illusion of movement is the key element render- ing cinema "Pygmalionesque." Although I will consider factors such as artistic creation and gendering, the single most significant concept here is animation. Cartoons, however, are only tangential to my study." I am interested instead in the notion of animation (derived from its Latin origins) as life, breath or spirit, because it best characterizes Pygmalion's life-giving gesture, which I will discuss at more length below. Of course, the texts and films central to this study's trajec- tory represent death as well as life. Remolding the Pygmalion myth by reversing Pygmalion's life-giving gesture yields inanimate rather than animate bodies- corpses, body parts, automata, wax figures, stone statues, painted images, and what Christian Metz calls the definitionally fake bodies of cinema (43)-because it entails images of absent bodies (and objects).' In nineteenth-century fantastic 2 The mention of "Pygmalion" also evokes yet another related scenario, that of the figurative re- molding of living and breathing human beings, as in Bernard Shaw's late nineteenth-century play. See Small and Levinson's fruitful article about animated film (cartoons) and/as montage. These inanimate forms might be considered both photographic and thanatographic. Indeed, although Raymond Bellour warns against reductive and rigid applications of the opposition be- tween photography and death, on the one hand, and cinema and life, on the other, he also aptly points to the opposition's potential value: "Without ever being able to reduce film or photography to corresponding strictly to one or the other of these opposing terms, [life and death] ... it is clear that photography holds the power of death" ("The Film Stilled" 30-32). Barthes, among others, also connects photography with death.</page><page sequence="3">PYGMALIONESQUE DELUSIONS/293 tales, epitomized by "Der Sandmann," the reversal of Pygmalion's (or Venus's) life- giving gesture overshadows the gesture itself, with "disanimation" playing a greater role than animation. By contrast, as anticipated in fin-de-siecle literature and as seen since the beginnings of film, the medium of cinema has affirmed and embodied Pygmalionesque animation through its signifiers, techniques and metaphors. Pygmalionesque Delusions: the Ovidian Paradigm Before looking at "Der Sandmann" I will take a brief detour back to Ovid to highlight the elements of this version of the Pygmalion myth that constitute the "Pygmalion paradigm" to which modern versions of the story respond. To sum- marize briefly a myth undoubtedly familiar to most readers, in the Metamorphoses Pygmalion sculpts a statue in female form from a block of ivory. He falls in love with his creation and prays to Venus for a wife like his "ivory girl." Venus grants his wish, Pygmalion marries his statue come to life, and they live happily ever after. The elements in Ovid's narrative particularly relevant to this study are: 1) the male artist (subject, creator) and the female work of art (object, creation); 2) the work of art's representation or simulation of human form; and 3) the happy end- ing. However, the metamorphosis of the work of art into a woman, or its animation, and the instrumental role of Venus in the animation of the statue nuance the three elements above. The reference to wax to describe the transition of the unnamed ivory girl into flesh5 is particularly important, because the role of wax figures in nineteenth- and twentieth-century Pygmalion fantasies accounts for a subgenre of the fantas- tic that I call "wax fictions": literary and cinematic texts that feature anthropo- morphic or more often gynomorphic wax figures, typically in the context of wax museums. In Ovid's account, when Pygmalion returns from the festival of Venus, [he] made straight for the statue of the girl he loved, leaned over the couch, and kissed her. She seemed warm: he laid his lips on her again, and touched her breast with his hands-at this touch the ivory lost its hardness, and grew soft: his fingers made an imprint on the yielding surface, just as wax of Hymettus melts in the sun and, worked by men's fingers, is fashioned into many different shapes, and madefitfor use by being used. (emphasis added; lines 281-87) The reference to wax at this transitional moment is far from coincidental. Nor is this metaphor "unwise," as Wilmon Brewer suggests without further explanation in Ovid's Metamorphoses in European Culture (343). Indeed, stone plays a much greater and more obvious role than wax in the Metamorphoses, as Douglas Bauer suggests, and Heinrich D6rrie has persuasively argued that wax's capacity to be shaped and reshaped through sculpting and molding makes it the ideal material to emblematize metamorphosis. Further, the pliability and porosity of wax (D6rrie 22), along with its capacity for polychromic coloration, make it suggestive of 5 Note that in Ovid Pygmalion's statue is anonymous, the name "Galatea" having been ascribed to it retrospectively, perhaps as late as the eighteenth century, in Rousseau's 1770 short dramatic piece, Pygmalion. Since the name "Galatea" has since been generally used to refer to Pygmalion's statue, I use this term to refer to such figures in modern texts. In the Mary Innes translation of the Metamor- phoses, the Pygmalion passage is called "Pygmalion and Galatea," reflecting the name's penetration into the scholarly domain. Although there is indeed a Galatea in the Metamorphoses, she is a sea- nymph in Book 8. See Law 431-32.</page><page sequence="4">COMPARATIVE LITERATURE/294 human flesh, thus rendering wax particularly appropriate for the simulation of human beings. The Failure of the Pygmalion Paradigm in the Romantic Tale: E.T.A. Hoffmann's "Der Sandmann" Because there is no metamorphosis in Hoffmann's "Der Sandmann," this text exemplifies the failure of the Pygmalion myth or its dissolution. In this sense, it is representative of nineteenth-century literary versions of Pygmalion. As Cham- bers says of "Der Sandmann," "Beaucoup de themes chers au dix-neuvieme siicle franais se trouvent en germe dans ce texte prestigieux... Le theme, pratiqu6 par Merimbe et Gautier, de la 'statue amoureuse,' theme etroitement lie ia celui de la 'morte amoureuse,' y est dcj'i en relation avec un evident complexe de Pygmalion" ("De grands yeux" 314; "The seeds of many themes favored by the French nineteenth century are already planted in this prestigious text... The theme of the amorous statue seen in Merimbe and Gautier, closely related to that of the dead lover, is already there in relation to an obvious Pygmalion complex"; my translation). Galatea figures take the form of "painted ladies" (in Balzac's "Le Chef-d'oeuvre inconnu" ["The Unknown Work of Art," 1832/40] and Poe's "The Oval Portrait," 1840) no less than statues. The animation of the inanimate oc- curs only at the expense of (and often in exchange for) human and typically female life, as in Merimee's '"Vnus d'Ille" (1837) and in "The Oval Portrait," if it occurs at all. More frequently, the realization that the female image or form is inanimate results in its destruction, as well as in the madness and death of the enamored male character when his fantasy is deflated. The best possible sce- nario entails the statue's stasis, which avoids the consequences of disillusionment, as in Champfleury's tale "L'Homme aux figures de cire" (Les Excentriques, 1857), in which a wax figure collector, Diart, leaves his shrewish wife for the wax doll Julie and presumably lives happily ever after. In "Der Sandmann" the Pygmalion myth goes awry in the hands of scientists and an artist. Hoffmann distinguishes the female beloved's creator from the amo- rously obsessed male artist and then further divides (or multiplies) the role of the creator. The automaton Olimpia is the joint work of the lawyer Coppelius, who doubles for the peddlar of optical goods, Giuseppe Coppola,6 and the physi- cist Spalanzani, ironically the namesake of the distinguished Italian naturalist Lazzaro Spallanzani (1729-99), a priest who demonstrated the failure of sponta- neous generation (193). Coppelius, Coppola and Spalanzani are mad scientists who destroy Olimpia despite their success in passing her off as a human, albeit a machinelike one. 6 Nathanael himself wavers on whether Coppola and Coppelius are doubles, at one moment af- firming with certitude that they are (190), and at another calling Coppola "far from being Coppelius's dreaded double and ghost" (203). Nathanael does identify Coppelius with the Sandman. Accord- ingly, in Freud's famous essay on the uncanny, he equates Coppola not only with Coppelius, but also with the Sandman: "the conclusion of the story makes it quite clear that Coppola the optician really is the lawyer Coppelius and thus also the Sand-Man" (383).</page><page sequence="5">PYGMALIONESQUE DELUSIONS/295 If in "Der Sandmann" science is not associated with rationality, neither is art. The poet Nathanael is too imaginative to be reasonable. Amorously obsessed with Olimpia, he imagines that "she" is alive and fantasizes that he is a Pygmalion figure. Ironically, he deems his fiancee Clara a "damned, lifeless automaton!" (200; "lebloses, verdammtes Automat!" 348) because she embodies rationality, as her name suggests. Nathanael takes the beautiful mechanical doll for a living and breathing woman even if, as the psychoanalytic critic Sarah Kofman states in her analysis of the story, "La perfection est ... l'indice qu'on a affaire 't une ma- chine qui mime la vie" (166; "perfection is ... the sign that we are dealing with a machine imitating life").' Nathanael's "discovery" that Olimpia is alive clearly recalls Pygmalion's realization that his statue has a pulse: "he thought that the pulse began to beat in her cold hand, and the warm life-blood to course through her veins" (206; "war es auch, als fingen an in der kalten Hand Pulse zu schlagen und des Lebensblutes Str6me zu glfihen," 354). And although her "ice-cold lips" ("eiskalte Lippen," 355) meet his "burning ones" ("seinen glfihenden," 355), while the touch of her "cold hand" ("kalte Hand," 355) prompts him to think of the Legend of the Dead Bride," his Pygmalionesque imagination ani- mates the dead and leads him to believe that his kiss is able "to warm her lips into vitality" (207). That Olimpia is associated with wax prior to the doll's destruction foreshad- ows its "death." Reducing the automaton to one of its parts just before it is liter- ally fragmented, Nathanael's friend Siegmund refers to the entire doll as a waxface ("Wachsgesicht"), pointing out its inexpressiveness in an attempt to discourage the poet's infatuation (356; trans. 207). Immediately after the fight in which Spalanzani and Coppola dismember Olimpia, the narrator adds "deathly pallour" to Siegmund's comment, calling Olimpia's eyeless face a "toderbleichtes Wachsgesicht" (359; trans. 210). By echoing Siegmund's earlier comment he re- minds us that the automaton was no more alive when in one piece than it is now, its various parts scattered about the room. The constitution of Olimpia's simulated body becomes obvious only upon its destruction. Ultimately, the automaton's creators reverse their work by literally pulling the automaton apart in front of the enamored poet's eyes, revealing its scientific origins in the process: Spalanzani "reeled backwards and fell over the table among the phials and retorts, the bottles and glass cylinders," which "smashed into a thousand pieces" (210; "fiber den Tisch, auf dem Phiolen, Retorten, Flaschen, glkiserne Zylinder standen, taumelte und hinstfirzte; alles Gerit klirrte in tausend Scherben zusammen," 359). Olimpia is a hybrid, an automaton whose creation and composition are multiple rather than singular, a liminal figure that is neither dead nor alive, still nor mobile, silent nor able to talk. 7 My translation. In Hawthorne's "The Birthmark," the scientist Aylmer's attempt to perfect his wife by removing her single flaw, a birthmark, yields a perfect, but dead, body. Like Hoffmann, Hawthorne suggests that idealized "perfect" women are either literally or figuratively dead, as op- posed to being living and "real"-that is, imperfect. 8 Hoffmann's mention of the legend of the Dead Bride is a reference to Goethe's ballad, "Braut von Korinth," in which "the hero unwittingly makes love to a revenant and must die" (Kent and Knight 160n6).</page><page sequence="6">COMPARATIVE LITERATURE/296 Olimpia's physical dissolution pushes Nathanael over the edge, both figura- tively and literally: he goes mad, tumbles over the railing of a tower, and, like Olimpia, ends up in pieces-his head shattered on the sidewalk. As in Balzac's "Le Chef-d'oeuvre inconnu," the absence of a mythic Venus figure to animate an inanimate object in female form leads to disaster (Didi-Huberman 82). Olimpia's creators thus become versions of Mary Shelley's Dr. Frankenstein-experiment- ing with the unknown, trying to synthesize a human out of an amalgam of parts, and in so doing, wreaking havoc. Hoffmann's early nineteenth-century Olimpia set a precedent for subsequent French incarnations of this failed Galatea figure, for such figures do not come to life in modernist texts of any medium. For instance, Edouard Manet's 1863 painted lady Olympia (fig. 1) harks back to Hoffmann's automaton, as Charles Bernheimer points out: [T]he most suggestive hypothetical reference of the name Manet chose, precisely because it thematizes the play of indeterminacy, is to the mechanical doll named Olympia in ETA Hoffmann's story "The Sandman," the text on which Freud based his analysis of the uncanny. The captivating doll is at once human and nonhuman, alive and dead, whole yet dismemberable, female yet not female. (116) Indeed, nineteenth-century critics called Manet's Olympia cadaveresque because the lack of modeling leads spectators to "doubt the existence on the canvas of three dimensions" (Clark 85). Unlike Manet's Olympia, but like Hoffmann's automaton,Jacques Offenbach's incarnation of the character is three-dimensional. In Les Contes d'Hoffmann (Tales of Hoffmann), Offenbach's late nineteenth-century operatic version of three Hoffmann stories, the first act of which corresponds to "Der Sandmann," it is not flatness that marks Olympia as inanimate. Rather, it is her extraordinary beauty that makes the automaton seem too perfect to be human: Charming! Charming! She has really lovely eyes. A beautiful figure! See how nicely she's dressed! She lacks nothing! Charmante! Charmante! Elle a de tr&amp;s beaux yeux! Sa taille est fort bien prise! Voyez comme elle est mise! Il ne lui manque rien! Olympia's stillness, evoked in the opera by the namesake of the story's author (Hoffmann), also betrays that "she" is inanimate: How extraordinarily still! It seems as if her eyes had no life, her cheeks no blood. It seems as if her soul has fled her body. Etrange immobilitY. Il semble que la vie manque i ce regard, le sang... .t ce visage, comme si son tme avait quitt6 son corps. At this moment, Olympia is doubly inanimate: she lacks an anima and she liter- ally does not move. When she does move, dancing with Hoffmann, her rigid, mechanical motion is evoked not only by the lyrics ("She can dance, in rhythm!" Act I) but also, quite humorously, by the sound of a spring, suggesting that the doll must be wound up in order to dance.</page><page sequence="7">PYGMALIONESQUE DELUSIONS/297 $:it g.; :J- $i.? i,.v. K' /IsL ~~ Ai A i9 ??.~* t rjI</page><page sequence="8">COMPARATIVE LITERATURE/298 Hoffmann, Manet, and Offenbach all parody Pygmalionesque desire through their incarnations of Olympia. Indeed, the Pygmalion myth's only success in nine- teenth-century texts (taken broadly) occurs in relation to nonfictional authors or to artists who, like Pygmalion, "breathe life" into their characters or images. If the automaton Olimpia does not come to life, the character Nathanael certainly does, and thus we might identify both Hoffmann and his narrator as Pygmalion figures. Indeed, Hoffmann's unidentified, first-person narrator portrays his art as analogous to that of a "good portrait painter" ("ein Guter Portriitmaler," 344), and even refers to painters in order to evoke Clara's image, which "rose up so vividly" before his eyes: .. painters averred that her neck, shoulders, and bosom were almost too chastely modeled, and yet, on the other hand, one and all were in love with her glorious Magdalene hair, and talked a good deal of nonsense about Battoni-like colouring. One of them, a veritable romanticist, strangely enough likened her eyes to a lake by Ruisdael, in which is reflected the pure azure of the cloudless sky, the beauty of woods and flowers, and all the bright and varied life of a living landscape. (196) ... die Maler fanden Nacken, Schultern und Brust beinahe zu keusch geformt, verliebten sich dagegen sdimtlich in das wunderbare Magdalenenhaar und faselten iiberhaupt viel von Battonischem Kolorit. Einer von ihnen, ein wirklicher Fantast, verglich aber h6chstseltsamer Weise Claras Augen mit einem See von Ruisdael, in dem sich wolkenlosen Himmels reines Azur, Wald- und Blumenflur, der reichen Landschaft ganzes buntes, heitres Leben spiegelt. (345) This portrait "fills in" the narrator's earlier metanarrative concerning how to begin his account of Nathanael's "ominous life" (195; "verhmingnisvollem Leben," 344). Explaining that "I could not find any words which seemed fitted to reflect in even the feeblest degree the brightness of the colours of my mental vision" (196; "Mir kam keine Rede in den Sinn, die nur im mindesten etwas von dem Farbenglanz des innern Bildes abzuspiegeln schien," 344), the narrator uses three letters, written by Nathanael and Clara, to provide the "outline of the picture, into which [I] will proceed to introduce more and more colour" (196; "den Umriss des Gebildes, in das ich nun erzihlend immer mehr und mehr Farbe hineinzutragen mich bemifhen werde," 344). "Perhaps, like a good portrait painter, I may succeed in depicting Nathanael in such a way that you will recog- nize it as a good likeness without being acquainted with the original, and will feel as if you had very often seen him with your own bodily eyes" (196; "Vielleicht gelingt es mir, manche Gestalt, wie ein guter Portr~itmaler, so aufzufassen, dass du es ihnlich findest, ohne das Original zu kennen, ja dass es dir ist, als hattest du die Person recht oft schon mit leibhaftigen Augen gesehen," 344). Metz's coments on the relationship of "cinema's signifier" to the signifiers of the "other arts" sheds retrospective light on animation in "Der Sandmann." Ac- cording to Metz, the signifier of literature, like that of cinema, is perceptual, "since the written has to be read" (42; "puisqu'il faut lire la chaine 6crite," 62). Beyond this minimal sense of perception, however, literature "involves a more restricted perceptual register: only graphemes, writing" (42-43; "engage un registre perceptif plus restreint: seulement des graphames, de l'&amp;criture," 62). Metz groups together painting, sculpture, architecture, and photography, calling them perceptual "too" ("6galement," 62), with the implication that they are more perceptual than lit- erature, but "still within limits, and different ones: absence of auditory percep- tion, absence in the visual itself of certain important dimensions such as time</page><page sequence="9">PYGMALIONESQUE DELUSIONS/299 and movement..." (43; "avec encore des limites, qui sont diff6rentes: absence de la perception auditive, absence, dans le visuel lui-meme, de certaines dimen- sions importantes comme le temps et le mouvement," 62). Hoffmann's narrator's repeated recourse to painting to compensate for literature's limitations likewise suggests that, in Metz's terms, painting is more perceptual than literature. Metz's theory of cinema also illuminates Hoffmann's notion that we can rec- ognize a "good likeness" of a person without knowing the "original." Indeed, elements of Metz's work resonate with Freud's theory of the uncanny, which is at least nominally derived from "Der Sandmann," even if Freud glosses over Olimpia, as noted by Cixous (537), Kofman (148), and Weber (1121). Freud invokes his precursor, ErnstJentsch, who has more to say than he does about the uncanni- ness of the blurred boundaries between animate and inanimate objects: The unpleasant impression is well known that readily arises in many people when they visit collec- tions of wax figures, panopticons and panoramas. In semi-darkness it is often especially difficult to distinguish a life-size wax or similar figure from a human person. For many sensitive souls, such a figure has the ability to retain its unpleasantness after the individual has taken [sic] a decision as to whether it is animate or not. (12, Freud 378) Metz argues that cinema is both more and less perceptual than the other arts because "the activity of perception which it involves is real (the cinema is not a phantasy), but the perceived is not really the object, it is its shade, its phantom, its double, its replica in a new kind of mirror" (45; "l'activit6 de perception y est r6elle [le cin6ma n'est pas le fantasme], mais le pergu n'est pas r6ellement l'objet, c'est son ombre, son fant6me, son double, sa riplique dans une nouvelle sorte de miroir," 64). What he means by this list of uncanny figures (shade, phan- tom, double), which might have walked right out of Freud's orJentsch's texts, is that cinema records images of objects and figures that are necessarily absent at the moment of their projection (43): "More than the other arts, or in a more unique way, the cinema involves us in the imaginary: it drums up all perception, but to switch it immediately over into its own absence, which is nonetheless the only signifier present" (45; "Davantage que les autres arts, ou de faon plus singuliere, le cin6ma nous engage dans l'imaginaire: il fait lever en masse la perception, mais pour la basculer aussit6t dans sa propre absence, qui est n6anmoins le seul signifiant pr6sent," 65). The empty bodies on the screen par- allel Olimpia's (almost) empty body, containing only "clockwork" ("das Riiderwerk," 359). Like Nathanael-to draw a parallel that straddles levels, me- dia, and historical periods-cinema spectators are confronted with uncanny doubles that only appear "real." Like Ovid and Hoffmann, Metz invokes wax to describe the definitionally un- canny objects and figures perceived by cinema spectators. If Olimpia is perceived as waxlike, perception itself is waxlike for Metz. Whereas Hoffmann character- izes Olimpia's face as similar to solid, rigid and shiny wax rather than flesh, Metz describes human perception in terms of soft wax (50; "la cire molle," 71). For Metz, the human body doubles the cinematic apparatus, or the projector, which itself "duplicates the camera" (51; "redouble lui-mime la cambra," 73). Metz's comparison of perception to "soft wax and no longer an emitting source" (50; "cire molle et non plus source Amettrice," 71), echoes Ovid's description of</page><page sequence="10">COMPARATIVE LITERATURE /300 Pygmalion's "fingers ma[king] an imprint on the yielding surface, just as wax of Hymettus melts in the sun.. ." Here, Metz refers to the "introjective" rather than the "projective" phase of vision, which consists of a "double mouvement" (71). Introjection entails "consciousness as a sensitive recording surface" ("la consience comme surface sensible d'enregistrement," 71), with soft wax constituting a meta- phoric screen (50; 71). Although my invocation of film theory with respect to Hoffmann's story is anachronistic, Metz focuses on cinema while touching on the "other arts" in ways that clearly pertain to animation and perception. Further, his argument that cinema's signifiers are uncanny suggests a connection with Hoffmann's uncanny automaton. Hoffmann's Olimpia in turn foreshadows Villiers de l'Isle-Adam's phantom, his Eve of the future, another mythical, uncanny gynomorphic figure. L'Evefuture not only combines forms of representation, but also anticipates the beginnings of film. A brief study of this novel will thus bring us closer, historically and conceptually, to early cinema. Toward a Pygmalionesque Cinema: Villiers's L'Eve Future The almost seventy-year gap between Villiers's L'Eve future and Hoffmann's "Der Sandmann" should not lead us to overlook the conceptual continuum be- tween the two works, as bothJacques Noiray (276-78) and Chambers ("L'Ange et l'automate" 31) have argued.' Indeed, as Noiray points out, the epigraph to Book I, Chapter 2 of the novel reflects Villiers's familiarity with "Der Sandmann."'o Villiers may also have seen D61ibes's ballet Coppelia, which opened at the Paris Opera on May 25, 1870 (Noiray 278). Published serially as early as 1880, L'Eve future appeared in book form in 1886. Although the novel follows in the foot- steps of "Der Sandmann" as a failed Pygmalion story, Villiers's Galatea figure "outdoes" Hoffmann's-and appropriately so, given such late nineteenth- century scientific advances as the phonograph and electricity. Further, L'Eve future, published just nine years before the first film projection by the Lumiere brothers, portrays a fictive Edison's experiments with successive photography, a portrayal which anticipates the historic Edison's early films and "primitive" cin- ema more generally. In doing so L'Evefuture represents the success of cinematic animation and signals the shift of "Pygmalionism" from literature to film. Villiers specialistJohn Anzalone offers a helpful abstract of the novel, to which I add proper names and brief descriptions: "a real woman [the aspiring opera singer Alicia Clary] resembling a work of art [the Venus Victrix] but deemed spiritually deficient by her love [the English gentleman Lord Celian Ewald] is replaced by an artificial device resembling a woman [the "Andreid" Hadaly]- but spiritually more satisfying-by an inventor [Thomas Alva Edison] " (Lathers 9 Not coincidentally, Chambers's 1972 article, "De grands yeux dans l'obscurit6: regard scientifique et vision occulte dans Clair Lenoiret L'Evefuture," is as much about "L'Homme au sable" as about the texts in its title (see note 8). 10 The epigraph is as follows: "'It's he! ... Ah!' I said, opening my eyes wide in the darkness, 'it's the Sand Man! "'-Hoffmann, Nachtstiicke (5; "'C'est lui!. . . Ah!' dis-je en ouvrant de grands yeux dans l'obscurite; 'c'est l'Homme au sable! . . "'41).</page><page sequence="11">PYGMALIONESQUE DELUSIONS/301 10). Note that Villiers created the neologism "Andreid" ("I'Andr6ide") 1 and that Hadaly means "Ideal" in Persian. As in "Der Sandmann" the Pygmalion figure is split between the creator, who is a scientist, and an amorously obsessed male, his one-time benefactor. Villiers's invocation of the Pygmalion myth is explicit: Hadaly on the verge of incarnation is described as "the statue awaiting the creator Pygmalion" (173; "la statue atten- dant le Pygmalion cr6ateur," 248). Although the "creator Pygmalion" refers to Ewald here, the phrase actually has two referents, as Chambers points out: Le r ve d'Ewald ne peut se passer du support ext6rieur qui lui est fourni par Edison; mais celui-ci, a son tour, ne peut completer son ouvrage qu'a l'arriv6e d'Ewald, apportant a la statue son r&amp;ve vivifiant. Disons qu'Hadaly sortant des mains d'Edison est une structure que l'amour d'Ewald doit animer en la dotant d'une signification ... ("L'Ange et l'automate" 45). Ewald's dream cannot do without the external framework that is furnished by Edison; but Edison, in turn, can only complete his work upon the arrival of Ewald, bringing to the statue his vitalizing dream. Let us say that Hadaly coming out of Ewald's hands is a structure that Ewald's love must animate by endowing it with meaning. (my translation) The Chambers passage reveals that in L'Evefuture, the "lover" is a dreamer but not an artist. Furthermore, even though Ewald is aware that Hadaly is a fabrica- tion-he agrees to postpone his suicide if Edison creates a (superior) double of his beloved-Ewald, like Nathanael before him, is nevertheless duped. The imitation human that Edison creates surpasses automata. Edison's critique of the Andreid's precursors and of their creators, which deserves quotation at length, is an "attaque violente" in Jacques Noiray's apt words (280). Edison laughs at "those mechanics of former times who tried to construct human simulacra ... Hah, hah, hah, hah!" ("ces m6caniciens d'autrefois qui ont essay6 de forger des simulacres humains?-Ah! ah! ah!-ah!"): "Those unlucky fellows, for lack of adequate means of execution, produced only derisory monsters... Their automata deserve a place in the most hideous waxworks museum because they are disgusting objects... These mannequins are nothing, if not an outrageous caricature of our species. And that is what the first Andreids were like." (69) "Les infortun6s, faute de moyens d'ex6cution suffisants, n'ont produit que des monstres d6risoires... Leurs automates sont dignes de figurer dans les plus hideux salons de cire, a titre, d'objets de d6gofit... Ces mannequins ne sont qu'une caricature outrageante de notre espece. Oui, telles furent les premieres ebauches des Andreidiens." (121) While wax figures tend to be inert, automata move in a jerky fashion. (Recall Olimpia's overly regular, machinelike dancing.) Edison corrects this by adding elastic synthetic flesh because, along with clothing, it makes the jerky movement of skeletons smoother (162). Edison's Andreid is a truly "modern" automaton (Noiray 303) due to its combination of electromagnetic power, phonographic voice, and flesh. Although this walking, talking, thinking and feeling creation is indistinguish- able from its model, Hadaly is not identical to Alicia Clary, whose surname re- calls that of Hoffmann's Clara. Like Olimpia, Hadaly lacks a soul and mortality. " On Villiers's neologism see Noiray 281n19. Noiray calls L'Evefuture an example of the literary theme of the automaton and distinguishes it from artifically biological creatures in the vein of Frankenstein's monster (276n1). I disagree on both counts, since Villiers's Andreid is not purely and simply a machine.</page><page sequence="12">COMPARATIVE LITERATURE /302 When Edison cautions Ewald not to confuse the doll with the living creature, his friend asserts that "The piecework will always betray the machine" (73; "l'oeuvre sentira toujours la machine," 126). But Ewald is wrong: after he complains about the "absurd, unthinking doll" ("une absurde poup6e insensible") to the woman he thinks is Alicia, declares his love, and then kisses her, "Alicia" proceeds to identify herself as the Andreid Hadaly. This apparent identity of soulless "copy" with "original" is, Walter Benjamin has argued, one of the key characteristics of Modernity. Raymond Bellour makes a similar point with reference to postmodern rather than modern phenomena in his analysis of L'Evefuture: "With the appearance of 'new images,' of the holo- graph, of cybernetics and automation (not to mention new theories of biology), an environment takes shape in which the copy tends to rival the model-the theme has become commonplace today-the difference between the two threat- ens to disappear" ("Ideal Hadaly" 130). The result is "potentially, a mass product, infinitely multipliable" (131). This blurring of boundaries between copy and origi- nal results from technology taking over the divine role of creation, as Ewald him- self recognizes (74; 127). The work of art in the age of mechanical reproduction is multiple rather than singular, as Hadaly's potential yet unrealized reproduc- tion suggests.12 Thus, despite proclaiming that he will make no more Andreids (249; 344), Edison explains that Only the first Andreid was difficult. Now that the general formula is established, it is only a matter of workmanship. There is no doubt that soon thousands of imitations will be manufactured from this model, and the first industrialist on the scene will begin manufacturing ideal women. (168) La premiere Andr6ide seule &amp;tait difficile. Ayant 6crit la formule g6n6rale, ce n'est plus d6sormais, laissez-moi vous le redire, qu'une question d'ouvrier: nul doute qu'il ne se fabrique bient6t des milliers de substrats comme celui-ci-et que le premier industriel venu n'ouvre une manufacture d'ideals! (241) Edison, of course, portrays himself as a scientist and calls Hadaly "une Eve scientifique" (277). However, the Andreid is a hybrid of science and art. Both the historic Edison's scientific inventions (electricity, the telephone, the phonograph) and the nineteenth-century tendency to view photography and cinema as tech- nologies rather than arts explain the fictive inventor's belief that his Andreid is a product of science. But Hadaly is also a work of art in the sense that the Andreid is a copy of a copy of a statue, since Alicia embodies the Venus Victrix."' Further, her lungs, made of two golden phonographs containing sixty hours of Alicia's readings of famous poetry, novels, and philosophy, make her a(n inter) text in- carnate. Hadaly is also L'Evefuture, itself, since each section of her body consti- tutes a chapter of the novel: La Bouche de Rose et les Dents de Perle (Rosy Mouth and Pearly Teeth), Les Yeux physiques, (The Eyes of the Body), La Chevelure (The Head of Hair), and L'Epiderme (Epidermis) (Schefer 88). In the same vein, Noiray suggests that by the time Villiers wrote, the machine was no longer a technical object but a literary one (379). 12 Villiers elides notions of sexual reproduction and sexual anatomy, as Bellour points out: "Geni- tality and the capacity to procreate are impossibilities for a machine" (121). 13 In her examination of sculpture and the ideal feminine ("The Decadent Goddess"), Marie Lathers links Hadaly with the V6nus de Milo in particular.</page><page sequence="13">PYGMALIONESQUE DELUSIONS/303 Although this art/science hybrid is a convincing human simulation, her de- struction results in the unhappy ending of the Pygmalion story that she modern- izes. Unlike humans "The Andreid knows no life, no disease, no death" (177; "L'Andr6ide ne connait ni la vie, ni la maladie, ni la mort," 253). Since she is literally heartless, she neither lives nor dies. Consequently, Edison instructs Ewald to destroy her when he dies; however, her destruction kills Ewald instead. It is prefigured by Edison's stipulation that she cross the ocean "as a dead person" ("a la maniere des mortes") so that her "s6r6nit6" will not offend women passengers suffering from seasickness (87; 144). To return to England with Ewald once he opts to accept this simulated woman in favor of the real one, Hadaly boards The Wonderful in a sarcophagus inscribed with her name (237; 329), only to meet her demise in a fire on board the ship.'4 As Ewald notes in an "Adieu telegram" he sends Edison from Liverpool, her loss makes him "inconsolable," implying the imminence of his suicide, postponed since the night of "the Pact" (251; 348). Death reverses Edison's Pygmalionesque creation of Hadaly and figurative ani- mation of Ewald, whose love for the Andreid revitalized him, but only temporarily. The fictive Edison's moving pictures both represent death and prefigure cinematic animation.15 Because Lathers has analyzed the fictive Edison's films in some depth (Aesthetics ofArtifice 102-10), I will look at them only briefly as a tran- sition to early film. In the first of these films Evelyn Habal, a fatal seductress who dies in the novel's subplot, is "animated in a moving picture show," as Lathers puts it (104). The show begins with the projection of a life-sized color photo- graph of the young, beautiful redhead. This still shot and Habal come (back) to life with the help of successive photography, which makes the dancing woman's movements "lively and sharp as life itself" (133; "Les mouvements s'acccusaient avec le fondu de la Vie elle-m me," 199). This anticipation of early cinema even includes music and voices: "Suddenly a flat, husky voice, frivolous and hard, was heard. The dancer was singing the 'alza' and 'olle' of her fandango. Her tam- bourine began to tinkle and her castanets to clink. Everything was reproduced: gestures, glances, lip movements, the play of the hips, the flutter of the eyelids, the insinuation of the smile" (134; "Soudain, une voix plate et comme empes6e, une voix sotte et dure se fit entendre; la danseuse chantait l'alza et le hole de son fandango. Le tambour de basque se mit 'a ronfler sous son coude et les castagnettes a cliqueter. Les gestes, les regards, le mouvement labial, le jeu des hanches, le clin des paupieres, l'intention du sourire se reproduisaient," 200). The second film represents the "real Evelyn" in her "natural" state without make-up: "the reflector projected upon the screen the image of a vaguely femi- nine creature, bloodless, skinny, hollow-cheeked, with a nearly lipless, toothless mouth, a nearly bald skull, dull beetle eyes, drooping eyelids. Completely skinny, wrinkled, and lusterless" (135; "le r6flecteur envoya dans le cadre l'apparition 1 The demise of Hadaly invites comparison with Poe's "Oblong Box." '5 Bellour minimizes the interest of Villiers's anticipation of talkies, in part because the Symbolist writer is in good company: "he predicts, for example, as did so many others of the period, the as-yet-to- be-invented cinema" (my emphasis, Bellour 11). Indeed, cinema seems to have been "in the air" in the years leading up to its invention. See Vanessa Schwartz's account of pre-cinematic spectacles (morgues, wax museums, and panoramas) in fin-de-siecle Paris.</page><page sequence="14">COMPARATIVE LITERATURE/304 d'un petit etre exsangue, vaguement f6minin, aux membres rabougris, auxjoues creuses, a la bouche 6dent6e et presque sans lvres, au crane a peu pres chauve, aux yeux ternes et vrille, aux paupieres flasques, a la personne rid6e, toute maigre et sombre," 201). This Baudelairian skeletal female or "witch"'" is then (re) animated cinematically and dances and sings, albeit in a drunken voice. Of course, while Edison and Ewald actually "see" the "living dead" of the sec- ond film, readers of L'Evefuture can (only?) imagine what this looks like. Liter- ary animation depends on imagination, not perception. To some extent, then, literature renders readers no less than authors Pygmalion figures because, as Chambers suggests, "c'est le lecteur qui est charg6 de vivifier la cr6ation de l'auteur... pour Hadaly Pygmalion est un etre double, .... la creation r6sulte ici de la collaboration de l'auteur et du lecteur" ("L'Ange et l'automate" 44-45; "it is the reader who is responsible for animating the author's creation ... for Hadaly Pygmalion is a double being whose creation results here from the collaboration of the author and the reader," my translation). But, if like Pygmalion prior to his statue's metamorphosis, readers use their imaginations to bring characters and texts to life, they do so with a crucial difference. Literary characters such as Hadaly are after all linguistic constructs. We imagine their animation, but we do not perceive it. Illusions of Movement: M6lies's Le Parapluiefantastique In film, however, movement occurs on a perceptual level, even if it is ultimately an illusion. As seen in "Der Sandmann" and L'Evefuture, Pygmalionesque delu- sions survive in the face of a character's consciousness that the object of desire is literally an object and indeed perhaps due to this awareness. Cinema continues to convey the illusion of movement regardless of our knowledge that it is con- stituted by nothing more (or less) than a series of still photographs. The illusion of movement, resulting from the phenomenon called persistence of vision, re- sults from tricks of sensory, and more specifically visual, perception. The persis- tence of vision is a "retinal effect" that exploits the human eye's gradual rather than immediate perception of the change in light stimulus. Thus, when station- ary images are presented in sufficiently rapid succession, the eye perceives them as continuous. Consider, for example, the zootrope, a precursor of cinema. The rapid rota- tion of this hollow cylindrical form, on which images alternate with slits or peep- holes, creates the effect of moving pictures. The illusion of animation is reflected in the Greek root, zoe, meaning, "I am active, or live.""7 This 1833 invention is analogous in form and movement to the amusement park ride commonly called the rotor, which Francois Truffaut invokes as a metaphor for cinema in his New Wave classic Les Quatre cent coups (The 400 Blows, 1959). Cinematic projectors also use intermittent motion to activate the "mind's mistake" in perceiving motion. 16 See John Anzalone's examination of the "pas de deux intertextuel" between Villiers and Baudelaire in the "Danse macabre" chapter of L'Evefuture (17-25). 17 On persistence of vision and the zootrope see Spottiswoode, Wall, Van Amerongen, Crary 107- 110, Small, and Levinson.</page><page sequence="15">PYGMALIONESQUE DELUSIONS/305 Ironically, it is because cinematic images are not projected continuously that they appear to be in continuous motion. Metz once again helps to explain the relationship between perception of cin- ema versus the "other arts." According to him, cinema is more perceptual, if the phrase is allowable, than many other means of expression; it mobilizes a larger number of the axes of perception. (That is why the cinema has sometimes been presented as a "synthesis of all the arts"; which does not mean very much, but if we restrict ourselves to the quanti- tative tally of the registers of perception, it is true that the cinema contains within itself the signifiers of other arts; it can present pictures to us, make us hear music, it is made of photographs, etc.) (43) plus perceptif si l'on peut s'exprimer ainsi, que beaucoup d'autres moyens d'expression: il mobilise la perception selon un plus grand nombre de ses axes. (C'est pourquoi on a parfois pr6sent6 le cin6ma comme une 'synthese de tous les arts'; cela ne veut pas dire grand-chose, mais si l'on s'en tient au relev6 quantitatif des registres de perception, il est vrai que le cinema 'englobe' en lui le signifiant d'autres arts: il peut nous presenter des tableaux, nous faire entendre de la musique, il est fait de photographies, etc.) (62) This statement may seem an illogical preamble to a discussion of silent film, which seems not to mobilize as many of the axes of perception as does sound film. However, historically speaking, the label silent film is a misnomer (see Bloom, "Using Early Silent Film"). Silent shorts were always accompanied by music- typically, live piano music. Live "lecturers" also provided narrations for slightly longer films. Neither of these factors (music and lecturers) will enter into my analysis of M6lies. However, they help to explain how early silent film provides a transition from the graphemes of literature to sound cinema's multi-faceted sig- nifier. That is, early silent film is "more perceptual" than literature and less so than sound film, in Metz's terms, particularly when it is studied a century after the fact and without the benefit of live music and lecturers. I propose to follow up on the connection between L'Evefuture and early film that Annette Michelson proposes discursively at the end of "On the Eve of the Future: The Reasonable Facsimile and the Philosophical Toy" and suggests visu- ally through the still shots of female images from M6lies films sandwiching her piece on the Villiers novel. Although Michelson ends her article without analyz- ing M6lies's or the "real" Edison's films, she identifies the important connection between L'Eve future and early film-and does so with particular reference to gender, linking the female body as the site of analysis (18) to the acts of magic perpetrated upon the female subject, as by Edison and Mli's in the films of the primitive period (1900-1906), for the mutilations, reconstitutions, and transformations performed upon her body are to be read ... as the obsessive reenactment of that proleptic movement between analysis and synthesis which will accelerate and crystallize around the female body in an ultimate, fantasmatic mode of representation as cinema. (19-20) M6lies's turn-of-the-century magic films objectify (transform, fragment, multi- ply) women and portray a male magician manipulating them. Melies, who often "stars" in the role of the magician that he really was-echoing the portrayal of Edison as a magician in L'Evefuture (Noiray 356)-attempts to create the illusion that, through a magic wand or other such phallic instrument, he is responsible for making people-often, but not always, women-vanish, reappear, metamor- phose. Of course, it is actually the magic of cinema, embodied in the cinematic apparatus, or the cinematograph, and the medium of film, that play such tricks on us. By stopping the camera and using dissolves (or fade-outs), M6libs the</page><page sequence="16">COMPARATIVE LITERATURE /306 , .. l i i~r, Y ' j j r- i" ? i;Y~  ..... ;: :?

Thanks to the same cinematic tricks, the ac- tresses then magically often reappear and are put back together, presumably to the amusement of the film's spectators."' In some Mlies films, such as Illusions extraordinaires (Extraordinary Illusions, also 1903), the reference to "Pygmalion" is implicit. This film features Mlies himself as a magician who assembles dismembered body parts into a statue and then transforms the statue into a woman. Other Mlies films explicitly invoke the myth. Pygmalion et Galathie is unfortunately no longer extant.19 In Ten Ladies in One Umbrella (Le Parapluiefantastique, ou dix femmes sous une ombrelle, 1903) the action takes place on the stage of what Mlies labels the "Galathea Theatre" and features him as a magician using an umbrella to create the ten titular women (fig. 2), metamorphose them into exotic dancing girls, and then transform them into ladies of the Belle Epoque. As such, it presents a particularly instructive ex- '8 Melis's films also fragment men and male body parts as well. See, for example, Un homme de tites (1898), Le Milomane (1903), and Le Bourreau turc (also 1903) in which no women appear. 19 Of course, at the rate that Mlies shorts have been discovered and restored in recent years, it may well turn up. The FCSF (Essai de Reconstitution du Catalogue Franpais de la Star-Film suivi d'une Analyse Catalographique des Films de Georges Milits Recensis in France), published in 1981, was based on 140 Mlies films, whereas at the 1996 colloquium on Mlies at CGrisy-la-Salle, France, the Melies corpus had expanded to several hundred.</page><page sequence="17">PYGMALIONESQUE DELUSIONS/307 ample of the transition from the nineteenth-century literary failure of the Pygma- lion myth to its success in film. Indeed, in Le Parapluie fantastique the Pygmalion myth accounts for the gendering of the uncanny cinematic body as female. Echoing Villiers's phan- tom, Hadaly, Melibs's ten ladies are absent images in the sense that all cinematic bodies are absent. As "conjured" women, they are doubly fantasmatic, a quality consistent with Lucy Fischer's suggestion that "the act of conjuring and 'vanish- ing' ladies tends to dematerialize and decorporealize the female sex-to relegate woman to the level of 'spirit' " (32). If Pygmalion sculpts his statue from a block of ivory, Melies conjures his Galateas out of nothing. The animation of Le Parapluiefantastique derives in large part from what today seems like a very primitive cinematic "trick." Melies stumbled upon the possibil- ity of conveying the effect of "transformation" when he was filming at the Place de l'Opera and his camerajammed (Melies 14). When it started again, the image of a hearse had replaced that of an omnibus and women had substituted for men, creating the effect of transformation rather than exposing the substitu- tions. By stopping the camera, replacing or modifying the object or person in front of it, and then starting the camera again, Melies could thus convey meta- morphosis cinematically. Exploiting this possibility, Le Parapluie fantastique features what Fischer calls "the act most typical of trick films,... simply conjuring a woman" (31). Consis- tent with the late nineteenth-century view of cinema as technology rather than art, it is tricks, rather than aesthetic creation, that account for the appearance of women in Le Parapluiefantastique. Melies, wearing a top hat and holding a cane, enters the scene in front of the Galat(h)ea Theatre. His hat becomes a ball, in turn transformed into the top of an umbrella, which he places on his cane to form his phallic magic wand. He metamorphoses himself into an ancient Greek through a costume change elided by stopping the camera and starting it again. Then a bundle of white cloth emerges from his umbrella and a woman comes out of the cloth. Indeed, in keeping with the frontality and lack of depth in Melies's films, the ladies "appear from behind the planar surface of an umbrella held toward the audience" (Frazer 124). In this manner, Melies conjures up not "simply" one woman, but ten, multiplying Pygmalion's dream (see Questerber) and moving toward the mass production of ideal women that Villiers's Edison renounces and that cinematic tricks-turned-special effects permit. The women, clothed in exotic dress representing different countries, stand, sit or recline on platforms in statuesque, sometimes odalisque, fashion, until Melies has them descend from their platforms, drop their exotic attire to reveal bourgeois cloth- ing and dance off-stage and off-screen to the right. After his final transformation back into his suit and top hat, he exits as well.20 20 Questerber likens Melies's films to cartoons: "La technique employee est tres proche de l'animation, et l'annonce" ("The technique used is very close to animation and announces it," my translation). Frazier echoes this comparison: "The world would be a poorer place without a certain amount of broad farce and comic violence of the sort represented by The Terrible Turkish Executioner, or in our time by Roadrunner cartoons" (134).</page><page sequence="18">COMPARATIVE LITERATURE/308 The proliferation of Galatea figures in Le Parapluie fantastique is particularly cinematic and exemplifies cinema's objectification of women from its earliest days. The more important point here, however, is that both Melies and cinema are magically animated. Indeed, in Le Parapluiefantastique the key examples of the metamorphosis fundamental to the Pygmalion myth occur with respect to inanimate objects (the hat, the ball) and Melies himself (becoming an ancient Greek and then returning to his "original" state)--and not, as one would expect, the ladies. While one could hardly argue that the ten ladies escape from the magician's control, they do descend from their pedestals. Moreover, even if they do so according to the wishes of the illusionist-which, like Pygmalion's, are unarticulated-it is because he desires "un spectacle plus vivant" (152 Cata- logue). Melies neither leads them off-screen nor makes them disappear. In short, whereas one might say that ten actresses perform in LeParapluiefantastique, Melies uses cinematic techniques to transform balls into hats and himself into an an- cient Greek. Later, in shorts such as Le Mdlomane, he will even achieve cinemati- cally the proliferation made possible in La Parapluie fantastique by the use of multiple actresses, reproducing his own head seven times to represent seven musical notes through the then painstaking cinematic process of multiple expo- sure (Melies 14). The Dissolution of the Pygmalion Myth in the Classical Hollywood Horror Film: Karl Freund's Mad Love In Freund's 1935 film, Mad Love, the musician Stephen Orlac, played by Colin Clive,21 is not a Pygmalion figure, even an unsuccessful one. Instead, he is Galatea to Peter Lorre's Dr. Gogol, a surgeon who comes to the rescue when the pianist's hands are destroyed in a train accident. Stephen's wife, the actress Yvonne Orlac, shares the role of Galatea. As La Torturie in a Grand Guignol melodrama, she is the object of the amorously obsessed doctor's desire. As a scientist Gogol is a successful Pygmalion figure, but as a man he fails to "animate" women. ("I, a poor peasant, have conquered science. Why can't I conquer love?" he com- plains.) In his "love life," Gogol both imagines he is Pygmalion and attempts to reverse the life-giving gestures that he realizes in the realm of science. In addi- tion to bringing human body parts to life cinematographically, Gogol aspires to kill photographically. When Yvonne resists his sexual advances, he proceeds to fetishize her wax double. Subsequently, she substitutes for her effigy, animating it cinematographically and becoming in effect her double's double. In doing so, she unwittingly anticipates Gogol's attempt to murder her since wax figures re- semble corpses. Medical science, in Gogol's hands, allows for (re)animation, even if the anachronous hand grafting is, like moving pictures, a (science) fiction. As a sur- 21 Mad Love's resonances with other late 1920s and 1930s films are numerous. Karl Freund was the cinematographer for Fritz Lang's Metropolis (1927), which centers on the same theme of doubling as do the texts of this study. Just four years before Colin Clive played Stephen Orlac, he incarnated James Whale's Victor Frankenstein. Peter Lorre played another mad male character whose perver- sions were directed toward females in Lang's M, which was first released in Berlin in 1931.</page><page sequence="19">PYGMALIONESQUE DELUSIONS/309 geon, Gogol cures deformed children, mutilated soldiers and the poor. After he amputates Orlac's hands and replaces them with those of Rollo, a circus knife- thrower recently executed for killing his father, his recollection of the moment of success-"Once I felt the blood pulsing through the hands, I knew the opera- tion would succeed"-recalls the response of Ovid's Pygmalion when his ivory statue comes to life: "The veins throbbed as he pressed them with his thumb" (10.290). (Gogol's successful resuscitation of dead body parts also anticipates- uncannily, one might say--the first actual hand graft in France: a 1998 operation on an ex-convict in Lyon.) Moreover, although Gogol brings a murderer's hands back to life, they pose the same problem for Stephen Orlac that his wife Yvonne poses for the obsessed doctor, for the hands have a life of their own. Although Orlac's new hands are made of human flesh, it is not his own and therefore it feels dead. The musician senses this, although Gogol tells neither Yvonne nor Stephen about the amputa- tion and grafting: "-They. They're dead... But they.., .they don't look like mine ..." Orlac's reanimated hands can throw knives, as they did for Rollo, but not (as did Stephen's "old" ones) play the piano, an inability that prompts Stephen to play records of his music, which Yvonne, in a Pygmalionesque fash- ion, takes for a live performance. Stephen's resulting comment on the power of the phonograph to sustain life ("Wonderful invention the phonograph. Keeps a man alive long after he's dead") not only recalls Villiers's Edison, the "Papa du Phonographe," but also applies self-reflexively to cinematic soundtracks. Gogol's surgery on Orlac embodies both Pygmalionesque animation and its counterforce. The jealous doctor, aiming to incriminate Orlac, whom he per- ceives as his rival for the affections of Yvonne, exploits the hands' murderous past through what he calls the "power of suggestion." Gogol's conflicting ten- dencies toward creation and destruction, more or less corresponding, respec- tively, to his scientific and romantic pursuits, are represented in shadowing that literally divides him (vertically) into aJekyll-Hyde figure as watches Yvonne as La Torturee. His eyes close as he experiences sadistic jouissance at the sight of Yvonne playing a Duchess being branded with iron and stretched on a rack for betraying her husband sexually. Confusing Yvonne with the Duchess that she plays, Gogol seems to expect the actress, like the character, to commit adultery. As a result, when he meets Yvonne in her dressing room after her final performance, the camera's frontal close-ups reveal Gogol's horror as he discovers that she plans to leave France for England with her husband. Furthermore, even if she were not happily married, Yvonne would be unable to offer him "more than friendship," since, as she later tells Gogol, there is something about him that frightens her. Rejected, Gogol buys Yvonne's wax double, a figure that had been located in the theatre lobby during her performances, and then installs it in his private "chamber of horrors." That a journalist who sees the figure being delivered to Gogol's home mistakes it for a "stiff" again reflects the resemblance between wax effigies and dead bodies. Gogol in general demonstrates necrophiliac tenden- cies through his "love of dead things," a love in turn exemplified by his faithful attendance at "head choppings" as well as at no less than forty-seven consecutive performances at the Thidtre Perd Une Autre Thte (Theatre Lose Another Head), where</page><page sequence="20">COMPARATIVE LITERATURE /310 a wedding cake decorated with a guillotine is served at the belated celebration of Yvonne's marriage. Gogol explicitly identifies the wax effigy of Yvonne as a Galatea figure when he purchases it from the truck driver who is supposed to take it to the "melting pot": Gogol Did you ever hear of Galatea? Lanvin Galla who? Not wanting a statue of him, are you? Gogol I don't want a statue of Galatea. You see, she was a statue herself. Pygmalion formed her, out of marble, not wax. And then-she came to life in his arms. Gogol buys his wax statue a negligeee that, according to his drunken housekeeper, Francoise, costs "a whole month of my wages," just as Ovid's Pygmalion decides to "dress the limbs of his statue in woman's robes" (10.263). It is Francoise's inebriation, together with the surgeon's madness, that makes possible the illusion of animation through cinematic representation. Yvonne arrives at Gogol's home in search of help for her husband, just accused of mur- dering his stepfather by throwing a knife at him, although Gogol has in fact committed the crime. The maid, aided by spirits (of the liquid variety), has a "double vision" of Yvonne upon her arrival. Francoise hurries what she imagines to be the wax doll back upstairs "where you belong, before he [Gogol] comes back and finds you running around loose." Only afterward does she scream "It talks! It's come alive!" and then exit the house to report this case of animation to two skeptical policemen (whojust so happen to be on the scene): Francoise Oh, dear-oh, dear! It went out for a little walk-and then it started to talk! ... Gendarme Who went out for a little walk? Francoise The wax statue. It came to life, I tell you. 2nd Gendarme They often come back to life, and go out for little walks. Francoise They do? Gendarme Yes. Now, you come for a little walk with us. I know a doctor who wants to have a word with you. Francoise Well, I never saw a statue come to life! However, because Yvonne is not as compliant as her wax double, Gogol's Pygmalion fantasy goes awry. Yvonne confronts her effigy, throws it out the win- dow and simulates it (see Everson 132, and Mundy 10). When Gogol sees this "animation" of the wax figure, an animation which is actually the vitality of Yvonne standing in for her effigy, his vacant frontward stare as he turns away from Lanvin to articulate Galatea's coming to life foreshadows Gogol's later, and even more pathological, expression of his obsession with animation.

So it seems that wax can bleed." This trace of life convinces Gogol that he has realized his dream: Gogol Galatea! I am Pygmalion! You were wax, but you came to life in my arms. Yvonne Doctor Gogol, please!... Gogol You speak! You speak to me! ... My love has made you live. Galatea, give me your lips. Yvonne Let me go! Let me go!... Gogol Why are you afraid of me? I love you, I love you, you came to life for me. Don't you know me Galatea? ... Yvonne Yes, yes, I am Galatea. Let me go now, please, I promise to come back. This is a case of substitution rather than metamorphosis. Even if "Galatea" were alive, that would not suffice for Gogol because his fantasy is modeled after Ovid's myth, in which Pygmalion's love for the statue animates it, and in which the animated statue in turn marries its creator. Not only has Gogol's love not animated the statue, but Yvonne also continues to resist his sexual advances (she won't kiss him) and begs to be liberated from the arms of her captor. The two figures occupy most of the shot of Gogol embracing Yvonne, the framing thus highlighting their physical closeness. Although Yvonne escapes from his embrace and from the shot, moving off screen from the right foreground, the camera follows closely after her, recapturing her image. However, from Gogol's perspec- tive, his supposed statue-come-to-life is more like Frankenstein's creation than Pygmalion's wife in that, like Mary Shelley's monster, she is out of his control. He cannot appropriate or contain her. In the last "Pygmalion scene" Gogol pretends to be Rollo come back to life. Having apparently returned from a meeting with his "benefactor," Gogol (as the "reanimated" killer) wears a neck brace ostensibly holding his reattached head in place, as well as goggles and metal hands. As he climbs the stairs to his cham- bers, he laughs madly. The close-up of a cockatoo follows medium shots of Gogol removing his disguise and precedes a cut back to a long shot of him. The cack- ling of the bird as Gogol walks toward the "wax effigy," still simulated by Yvonne, clearly parallels the madman's laughter, which is punctuated by speech, rather than vice versa. The German expression "haben einen Vogel"-literally, to have a bird-means "to be crazy." The symbolism here is obvious. Following the last utterance of the refrain "Liar! Hypocrite! You disgust me" in this scene, the voice of Gogol's demented consciousness repeats "Each man kills the thing he loves" (7.7), a sentence that vocalizes a line from Oscar Wilde's "The Ballad of Reading Gaol" (Draper 62n17). After this statement, the cut from a middle close-up of him to an even closer shot of Yvonne from his perspective positions her as the victim of his desire and consequently of this death sentence. Doctor Gogol petrifies the female object of his desire photographically, as exem- plified in a production still (fig. 3) in which Gogol stands close to Yvonne, his</page><page sequence="22">COMPARATIVE LITERATURE /312 Figure 3 Karl Freund, Mad Love, MGM, 1935.

Here, Yvonne looks waxen. Given that the image is a production still, and thus by definition outside the context of the film, it is ambiguous whether she is playing the part of her wax effigy or is simply frightened. In any case, Yvonne is "scared stiff," but not literally scared to death. As Gogol, quoting "No pain feels she" from Robert Browning's "Porphyria's Lover," attempts to strangle Yvonne with her own hair (Draper 62n18), Stephen Orlac kills the mad doctor by hurling a knife into his back. Although Gogol does not bring Yvonne's effigy to life, Freund, the filmmaker, does so on at least two levels: Yvonne simulates the effigy and is in turn animated by the actress Frances Drake who plays the role of Yvonne in the movie. The director also uses dissolves to convey Gogol's mad perceptions, dissolves which conjure up past images and sounds of himself and of Yvonne (cf. Bloom, Waxing Eloquent). Finally, as a web of intertextual references, Mad Love, like both Hadaly and L'Evefuture, brings other texts (back) to life: poems (Wilde's "Ballad of Read- ing Gaol" and Browning's "Porphyria's Lover"); a novel (Maurice Renard's 1920 fantastic-mystery novel Les Mains d'Orlac); Grand Guignol melodrama; and, of course, the myth of Pygmalion. As a remake of Robert Wiene's 1926 German silent film Orlacs Hiinde, it resuscitates silent film as well, just as it has itself been revived by later remakes, such as Edmond de Greville's 1960 version, The Hands of Orlac. Unlike Pygmalion's animated statue, literary and cinematic texts, once published and distributed, escape (like modern Galatea figures) the control of their authors and directors and fall into the hands/minds/eyes of readers and viewers, including other authors and directors. Illusions of Movement: the Failure of the Pygmalion Myth and the Success of Cinematic Animation in Truffaut's La Chambre verte Like its nineteenth-century literary predecessors and Mad Love (but unlike Le Parapluie fantastique), Truffaut's penultimate film, La Chambre verte (The Green Room), represents the failure of Ovid's Pygmalion myth as well as its success, although it accomplishes the latter through its use of a metaphor for cinema, rather than through cinematic techniques (stop motion and dissolves, for ex- ample). Its protagonist, Julien Davenne, played by Truffaut himself, manifests his violent Pygmalionesque desire to animate the inanimate by resurrecting the dead as early as the film's first sequence, which portrays the wake of his friend Gerard Mazet's wife. The impossibility of realizing such Pygmalionesque desires is already evident at this point in the film. Davenne, who has not recovered from the loss of his own young wife eleven years earlier, rages at the priest, reproach- ing him for not having the powers of Pygmalion-or should we say of Venus? C'est votre faute, Monsieur l'Abb&amp;, oui, c'est votre faute. Cette femme n'est pas morte du p~ch6 comme on meurt d'un mauvais rhume, et son mari n'a que faire de vos paroles de resignation .. Ceux qui pleurent leurs morts, ce n'est pas dans vingt ans, ce n'est pas dans mille ans qu'ils espyrent les revoir, c'est maintenant... Tout ce que l'on attend de vous c'est que vous disiez: 'Leve- toi et marche' et que les morts se levent et marchent. Alors si vous &amp;tes incapable de faire revivre Genevieve Mazet, aujourd'hui, maintenant, i l'instant mime, vous n'avez rien i faire ici...</page><page sequence="24">COMPARATIVE LITERATURE/314 It's your fault, Father. Yes, it's your fault. This woman didn't die from her sins like you die from a bad cold. Her husband doesn't want to hear you talk about resignation. Those who mourn their dead don't want to see them again in twenty years or a thousand years. They want to see them again now. All we expect is for you to say, "Get up and walk" and the dead will get up and walk. So if you can't bring Genevieve Mazet back to life today, right now, you have no business here!22 Davenne rebukes the priest for not having the power to make the dead- specifically, his best friend's deceased wife and, by extension, his own late wife- "get up and walk" immediately. This mention of the walking dead recalls, among a host of horror movies, Mad Love and another 1930s Karl Freund film, The Mummy, in which the line, "He's gone out for a little walk has he?" echoes with a gender change ("She's gone out..."), a line from Mad Love. La Chambre verte certainly has elements of the genres of horror and the fantastic. However, since natural rather than supernatural laws apply, the only way in which Genevieve Mazet can come back to life is through Gerard quickly finding a second wife. This quick substitution of wife 2 for wife 1 (with a change of hair color from blond to brunette) enrages Davenne because in his view the (hasty) remarriage kills off Genevieve's spirit rather than keeps it alive. The impossibility of realizing Pygmalionesque fantasies is further emphasized by a sequence featuring a wax figure of Davenne's wife, Julie. In this sequence Davenne goes to pick up the wax effigy of Julie that he had ordered after a fire destroyed her portraits in the green room of the film's title. Wax, we might re- call, is an eminently fragile material that evokes death, as does photography. Moreover, this substitution of a wax figure for his dead wife upsets Davenne even more than his friend Gerard's replacement of wife 1 with wife 2. Indeed, the only sense in which the wax effigy is animated is that it rotates on a stool. But the stool is visible and creaks as it turns, revealing that the wax figure is itself static. In constrast to the "still stools" that function as pedestals in Le Parapluie fantastique, the rotating stool functions as an exteriorized version of the mechanical spring that makes Offenbach's Olimpia automaton move. Ironically, although Truffaut has an actress-Laurence Ragon (Screenplay 18n24)--incarnate this statue, he does not do so to make it appear alive.23 On the contrary, as with the sculptor's theatrical opening of the curtain to expose the effigy to Davenne (Gillain, Franfois Truffaut 270), Truffaut heightens the artifice of the figure by making Ragon's skin shine like wax, even more than it appears to do in figure 4. In this still, which does not appear in the film, Truffaut's Davenne, not the sculp- tor, opens the curtain. Like Jean Cocteau in Le Testament d'Orphee, Truffaut also superimposes fake eyes over her real ones (Gillain 271) to create the glassy stare apparent in figure 4. As a result, despite the vertical position of the effigy, its movement (of course in the film, not the still), and its incarnation by a human, it resembles Genevieve Mazet's dead body laid out at the wake of the opening se- quence more than it approximates a living person. 22 Translation according to subtitles (Captions Inc.

The wax effigy, which perfectly resembles the photographic portrait ofJulie that Davenne had given the sculptor, is a flawless mimetic representation. However, like a photograph (at least in the traditional, nineteenth-century view of the medium) the wax Julie is also static, even dead. Pure image, it does not capture Julie's spirit. As a three-dimensional, purely material, and spiritless portrait, the effigy evokes a dead Julie rather than a living one. The cinematic fragmentation of the wax effigy sequence anticipates the frag- mentation of the wax figure by the sculptor upon Davenne's orders. Of the twenty- three shots of this less than two-minute sequence, only three last more than sixteen seconds. The opening shot following Davenne down the steps to the studio, the sequence's third shot, which reveals the sculptor and the workshop's interior, and the last long shot of the workshop from the outside last from seventeen to twenty-nine seconds each, which is a long time in cinematic terms. It is particu- larly ironic that the final shot, which affords through translucent window panes an obstructed view of the sculptor hacking the effigy into pieces, lasts so long; an act of fragmentation, represented without cinematic cuts, in effect gains an illu- sion of continuity and totality. On the other hand, by placing the camera outside the workshop Truffaut fragments our vision just as the sculptor fragments the effigy, thereby bringing his negation of the Pygmalion myth to its logical conclusion. However, although The Green Room seems in this way to support the view that the Pygmalion myth fails in cinema no less than it does in nineteenth-century tales, this is not the case. If the wax figure sequence points to the myth's failure, the medium of film itself, as represented in The Green Room's "Altar of the Dead" sequence (named after the 1895 Henry James short story), suggests the oppo- site. While Truffaut rejects the animation of the inanimate in the "vulgar" or "fantastic" form of the animation of simulacra, he proposes an alternative, aes- thetic solution. Davenne refuses the (dead) wax figure but embraces (vital) ani- mated photographs which, not coincidentally, function as a metaphor for cinema. That is, he constructs a shrine to Julie and all of his dead friends by hanging their photographic portraits, accompanied by lit candles, in a church. The photographs of Davenne's "dear ghosts" (Insdorf 221) also double as memorials to Truffaut's, since they present images of the filmmaker's deceased role models and friends: HenryJames; Maurice Jaubert, who composed the film's music; the actor Oskar Werner, who played Jules in his 1962 classicJules and Jim; the twentieth-century writers Proust and Raymond Queneau, along with the latter's wife, among them. This altar of the dead also recalls Antoine Doinel's Homage to Balzac-a portrait accompanied by a lit candle, which starts a fire-in Les Quatre cents coups. In both films, still portraits animated by the movement of flames constitute metaphors for cinema, a "cinema" that thus keepsJulie's spirit alive much more successfully than her wax effigy. In contrast, the photographs, minus the lit candles of the altar, are "dead," just as the wax effigy is pure materiality, lacking a spirit and thus inanimate. Of course, Davenne has not completely rejected the efficacy of wax, as it reap- pears here in the abstract form of the candle. However, it is the moving flames,</page><page sequence="27">PYGMALIONESQUE DELUSIONS/317 which are either seen in the foreground or more often projected onto the glass covering the portraits, that animate the photographs. As McGarry puts it, "Try- ing to bring a still portrait to life with the help of a lit candle equals trying to make an image move, as in cinema" (355). Through camera movement (pans, traveling shots) and illuminated candles Truffaut resuscitates (dead) photo- graphic portraits cinematically, at the same time that he pays homage to the nonfictional artists represented in these portraits so that they, too, will live on. Thus, while Truffaut critiques Davenne on the grounds that he is an obsessive necrophiliac, he endorses his character's rejection of forgetting: "Dans notre m6tier de cin'ma,je suis 'tonne de l'oubli dans lequel est tombeJacques Becker, par exemple ...Je suis contre l'oubli, qui est une frivolite norme .. ." (Gillain, "La Chambre Verte" 372; "In our profession of cinema, I am astonished that Jacques Becker, for instance, has been forgotten ... I am against forgetting, which is an enormous frivolity," my translation). The Fantastic and "Cinemadness" Animation might be called a "fantastic phenomenon," since in the genre called the fantastic, inanimate objects often come to life, or are imagined to do so. In Cl6ment Rosset's words, "si le cinema peut etre particulierement bon dans le fantastique, c'est qu'il n'est, ' la limite, de bon fantastique que cinema- tographique." (54; "if cinema is particularly conducive to evoking the fantastic, it is because cinema is the only effective medium of the fantastic," my translation). Implicit in this admittedly debatable contention is the compelling notion that cinema is by definition fantastic.Jean-Louis Leutrat likewise emphasizes this prin- ciple in Vie desfantomes: lefantastique au cinema, explaining: Par fantastique du cinema, il faut entendre ce qu'il y a de fantastique dans le dispositif lui-meme ainsi que les effets fantastiques produits par le cinema avec les moyens qui sont les siens. . . La cat6gorie du fantastique cin6matographique que nous proposons est transversale. Elle met enjeu le tout du cinema, Lumiere autant que M61ies. (10) The "cinematic fantastic" refers to that which is fantastic in the medium itself as well as fantastic effects created by the cinema through its own means ... The category of cinematographic fantastic that we propose is tranversal. It puts into play all of cinema, Lumiere as much as Melies. (my translation) Leutrat here rejects a widely held dichotomy between French film pioneers Lumiere, typically associated with his actualities, which portray "slices of life," and Mlies, best known for his magic films, like Ten Ladies-a move consistent with his intended subtitle, "Le fantastique du cinema" (The fantastic of cinema or the cinematic fantastic), as opposed to the published subtitle, which trans- lates as "the fantastic in cinema" and so suggests a more thematic and less fruit- ful approach.24 Whatever its particular genre, every film is fantastic in that it creates illusions, allowing and even forcing us to confuse fiction and reality. Fictional readers such as Don Quijote and Emma Bovary have generally been considered mad because they confuse fiction with life. As such, they are also "exceptional" readers, but not in the positive sense of the word. By contrast, 24 Leutrat made these comments on his intended subtitle during a seminar on the Mummy at the Universite de Paris III-Sorbonne Nouvelle in 1996.</page><page sequence="28">COMPARATIVE LITERATURE/318 viewing film always and necessarily entails a sort of "temporary insanity." It relies on perceptual "mistakes," not merely on a suspension of disbelief, which-if we are not a Don Quijote or an Emma Bovary-we can will or not as we like. Film affects humans more democratically than does literature. It is Everycinema- goer, not the exceptional one, who gives up her sanity in the darkness of the movie theatre or in front of the television at home, as is more often the case in the age of video. Our eyes dictate that we perceive cinematic images for what they are not: dynamic, motion pictures. Cinema shows us that heads can be de- capitated without killing people, and that they can be put back on. Even if our imaginations resist, films visually project us into imaginary worlds. Although Mlies is long dead, films of all genres continue to take advantage of our perceptual confusion in order to play tricks on us. As we watch we thus become the latest descendants of Ovid's amorous sculptor, our Pygmalionesque delusions triggered by the illusory dynamism of film."25 University of California, Riverside Works Cited Anzalone,John.
