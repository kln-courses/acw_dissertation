<plain_text><page sequence="1">Paradoxia Epidemica. The Renaissance Tradition of Paradox. By ROSALIE L. COLIE. Pp. xxH- 554. Princeton: University Press; London: Oxford University Press, 1966. ?5 net. Miss Colie is not the first scholar to be attracted to the subject of Renaissance paradox, and it is bad luck for her that W. Kaiser's Praisers of Folly (London, 1964) should have come out while she was still finishing her own work. Com- parisons between the two books are not in her favour. Mr. Kaiser dealt with three authors, Erasmus, Rabelais, and Shakespeare, and one specific aspect of their use of paradox, the praise of folly. Though there is much in his book open to dispute, it is always clear what he is trying to prove. Miss Colie, on the other hand, deals with a dozen authors or more, ranging from Petrarch to Burton and Pascal, and it is almost never clear what she is trying to prove. It may be unfair to quibble about the limits of the 'long Renaissance' defined so as to include Cusa, Milton, and Pascal, but it is significant that Swift would have been in- cluded too if Miss Colie had had her way, though we are told that 'as a major mode of expression, paradoxy certainly went out of favour at the end of the Renaissance' (p. 508). If Swift, why not Voltaire (Zadig, Candide), why not Sterne, why, for that matter, not Goethe's Faust? It is all very well to deny relying on 'the notion of some paradoxical Zeitgeist' (p. xi), but where the authors of some four centuries and half Europe are used as illustrations, just what concept of Renaissance (or paradox) is being relied upon? This general vagueness about period and authors is aggravated by some highly questionable assertions of fact. Thus we are told that Renaissance paradoxy 'coincides with active speculation on the market of ideas' but that in 'the ver- nacular literatures it remained a sophisticated form, written for a learned and experienced coterie' (p. 33). Like everything else in the book, this is a question of definition, but Rabelais and Shakespeare hardly seem to bear it out.</page><page sequence="2">318 REVIEWS It is worth considering in detail what Miss Colie has to say about Rabelais, Montaigne, and Pascal, because it throws light on her methods in general. It is ominous that Lucian, of crucial importance for both Rabelais and Erasmus, is only mentioned five times in the whole book (three passing references to his paradox of the fly, two to his imaginary voyages). We are told that 'Panurge ... is the creative fool whose ideas and questions are the origin of the [Third] book's activity' (p. 6o), but we are nowhere told that Gargantua and Pantagruel are the eponymous heroes without whom there would be no book at all. Two mouldy chestnuts are duly exhumed: 'Rabelais' scatological interests ... surely excep- tional in the grand tradition of belles lettres to which Rabelais' book so patently belongs', and 'Much of the book concerns itself with copulation, either in fact or fantasy' (p. 64). The fantasy is surely Miss Colie's own: the most cursory reckoning shows that in the whole book the theme of copulation is a very minor one, and that even in the Third Book it is forgotten for whole chapters at a time, while as for the 'grand tradition' it is news to at least one reader that Rabelais is to be classed with belles lettres. However that may be, his book contains no more scatology than, for instance, the comedies and short stories of the French Renaissance; what distinguishes it is the amount of serious material. There is much bawdy and much paradox in Rabelais, but they only make sense in the context of the epic deeds and wise words of the gigantic heroes, who are, unlike Panurge, specifically offered to us as models. By the end of her book Miss Colie has realized, too late, that 'Montaigne's [work] is excerpted at the critic's peril' (p. 405). We learn that 'though dedicated to the "hard" Stoical doctrine of Seneca and Plutarch ... Montaigne spent most of his time relishing mutability', but it is precisely this 'hard' doctrine that he abandoned during his sceptical crisis. The explanation of this interpretation comes at the end of the book, in connection with Charron's systematization of Montaigne: In an ultimate anomaly, then, the teachings of the two schools of thought traditionally opposed, Stoicism and Skepticism, turn out to be identical. (p. 405) Of course, men managed to combine elements of both, but a moment later Miss Colie explicitly denies that 'the connexion is simply complementary', so that one is left bewildered before a statement which seems to make nonsense of all attempts to disentangle the skein of Renaissance thought. We read of the Essays: In self-reference any assertion, however true, must also be a denial: self-assertion is equally self-denial. .... The enterprise itself, the public display of a man engaged in the most intimate self-regard, is paradox. (p. 395) Perhaps it is, but on the face of it such a judgement seems neither true nor helpful. Pascal comes off no better. A remark plainly put into the mouth of his imaginary interlocutor (Pascal himself never went to school) is adduced as evidence that 'Pascal had from childhood sensed the existence of some nothing', in the context of the void. Far more serious is the following: 'Pascal's God ...</page><page sequence="3">REVIEWS 319 has no anthropomorphic affection for man or mankind . . . in Pascal's system loving is left to the Second Person of the Trinity' (p. 268). Who then loved his chosen people, to whom Pascal devoted a very large section of his Pense'es? And how can God and the Trinity be thus disjoined? A few comments on Shakespeare show that the French are not alone in being treated thus: [Macbeth] has become the embodiment of his paradox, that nothing is but what is not: the most terrible thing about thatwhole tragedyis that he knows it absolutely. ... The 'nothing' of Hamlet is not the existential not-being of Macbeth so much as the paradoxical nothing of the rhetoricians. (p. 237) lago is the dramatic figure acting out the duplicity of the liar paradox, for he lies in speaking the truth. (p. 248) It is hard to imagine the sort of students for whom these remarks would lighten their darkness, yet even the most paradoxical of critics presumably aims at something other than obfuscation. With so much enviable erudition and enthusiasm Miss Colie should have produced a valuable study of an interesting subject, but the depressing fact is that she leaves confusion worse confounded. Her idea is an excellent one, as is the plan of presenting categories of paradox in ascending order of intellectual complexity (rhetorical, theological, ontological, epistemological); but in seeing her own work as essentially paradoxical she is courting disaster. The reading of Rabelais, Montaigne, and Pascal is wrong to the point of perversity, and this is due as much to defects of method as deficiencies of knowledge. Others are more competent to judge her handling of English authors. The book is full of good things (notably the section on still life in painting), many of which are well worth following up, but Miss Colie should have heeded her own final warning: 'only confident men can contemplate paradoxes in the first place, and only the most secure technicians can accept its risks' (p. 520).
