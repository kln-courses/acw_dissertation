<plain_text><page sequence="1">Plants as play props Robin С. Moore School of Design North Carolina State University In the Yard's treasure chest of loose parts, the most beautiful, most inspiring jewels were plant parts. No one had to 'requisition' for new supplies of these most prolific, renewable, play and learning re- sources. They were nature's free gift. I make 'flowers' out of flowers," a girl says. I take little petals and pretty leaves like the red ones ( Linum ) and I use the green pine needles and I take two green leaves and I stick them on and I take some of the yellow stuff [dandelion petals] and put it in the middle and make a flower. Sometimes we make other stuff with the dried leaves and stuff, like a doll, or a picture of a cat, or a bird. I start with a leaf for the head and cut a little hole in it for the eye and take some pine needles and cut them into little pieces for the feet. Then I get a piece of yellow leaf for the beak. A six-inch high doll, made of four twigs , a marigold flowerhead, and sixteen dried black acacia leaves . 3 'The flowers are magic," a girl says matter-of-factly, "especially these." She bends down and picks some red linum (Scarlet flax, Linum grandiflorum rubrum). "They'll make your hands magic, then everything you touch'll be magic. Pens will write magic... glasses will see magic. Everything'll be magic." The girl was playing in the Natural Resource Area of the Environmental Yard, a redeveloped schoolyard in multi-ethnic Berkeley, California, built over several years as an experimental play setting. One of the more important objectives was to study how five to eight year olds used a broad variety of outdoor settings, ranging from traditional play equipment and asphalt to natural resources such as dirt, water and vegetation. A number of systematic and informal research methods were used. These included the documentation of "behaviour episodes" by the author and a small cadre of trained graduate assistants (well-known to the children and trusted by them). This anecdotal record, gathered over several years, provides evidence of the extent to which imagina- tive play and creative social interaction can be supported by a highly manipulative environment having plants as its primary plav material. "I like the nature area because of all the scraps that can be turned into something else, like airplanes and boats for racing down the creek," a girl says. Whatever *s there, you can make something out of it. That's what's neat. If I see a branch that broke off a tree and it has a few leaves on it, I use it for a broom. When I find plants that are already picked or that fell from trees, I pretend to eat them at my campsite. If I find a plant that has a shape like a mushroom, then I pretend it's a mushroom. I use one of the rocks as a camping stove. Sometimes we make the ground moist and dig it over with a big stick. We collect seeds and plant them like a garden and pretend they're going to grow. They don't really. But they might. I wish they did. Children used whatever scraps (both natural and synthetic) they could lay their hands on, referring to the playful blending of props and imagination with shorthand names like "messing around" or "nothing" (the ultimate description of this play-beyond-words). I just pick bits of stuff off the ground," says one of the boys, "fiddle around and put 'em down again. Sometimes I play 'telephone man'. You take some rocks and put 'em in your pocket and walk up to a tree and pretend you're fixin' the telephone. If a friend comes, we fiddle around some more.. .just sit and talk and fiddle around. An earlier version of this paper appeared in Playworld Journal, 1 , p. 3-6, 1986. Vol. 6, No. 1, (Spring) 1989</page><page sequence="2">A small unobtrusive tape recorder was used to document these play episodes so that the authenticity of children's own descriptions could be preserved. At the same time, detailed observations were made of children's interactions with the immediate environment. "I collect weeds and make things with my sister," a girl explains. Once we found a piece of dried grass and split it in half and twisted it together and made a ring. We got some reeds and braided them together into a hat. We stuck some flowers in it and put it on our heads. After a while it dried up and we had to throw it away. Plant parts provided irresistible sensory gems, pinpoints of color, smell, and geometric form that focused children's attention and set the wheels of their imaginations in motion. The two girls pick the leaves of an ornamental succulent and impale them, together with pink rose petals and purple fuchsia flowers, on the thorns along the length of a rose bush stem. They say it's a "barbecue." One of them rolls up her lip and puts a California Laurel leaf ( Umbellularia californica , the more pungent American cousin of the culinary Italian Bay) under her nose. "I made a bay leaf moustache to smell," she says, laughing. A boy twirls a bright orange California poppy (i Eschscholza californica) between his fingers, calls it an "airplane flower" and shows how the "wings go out" as it spins around. Another mentions how he likes to smell the eucalyptus "nuts." This type of imaginative play was accompanied by a stream of minute physical change. On fence post tops; on benches, tables and ledges; on the raised walkway around the central sand area; in the crotches of trees and bushes; children assembled concoctions of Young boatbuilders try out traditional crafí, inspired by studying Native American life and made from tule rushes (Scirpas robustusj growing around one of the Yard ponds. The importance of small play/work surfaces is demonstrated by these girls engaged in culinary activity using a variety of seeds and crushed leaves as ingredients. 4 Children's Environments Quarterly</page><page sequence="3">sticks and stones, insects, dead and alive, candy wrappers, bits of coloured glass, bottle tops and pull tabs, milk cartons, toys from home - amalgams that fertilized flights of fancy and provided the raw material for ingenious invention. Aluminum lunch trays filled with sand scraped smooth were used to trace hieroglyphic portraits and abstract designs. Rowers, leaves and grasses were added to make what kids called "little pieces of heaven." A girl described how she went "hunting for buds" in the spring. Best were the silvery, pollen-laden pussywillow catkins. "We call them Cottontails'," she says. Ya know, those fuzzy things. We pretend they're rabbits' eggs. We get some grass and make it into a circle like a nest and the rabbit just sits on the eggs to keep 'em warm and waits 4till they hatch. The father rabbit goes to look for food. We get bitty branches and make 'em into carrots. We know rabbits don't really lay eggs * cause they're mammals. When they hatch, we make boats out of leaves and sail the cottontails in the pond. If it's sunny, we make them go swimming and pretend they get a tan. Play with very small-scale plant parts was engaged in more by girls than boys. Themes were often domestic, anthropomorphic, with dramatic action revolving around little toy characters brought from home. Three girls are playing in the roots of an old tree stump. They have a stuffed rabbit, a plastic doll, and a ballerina cake decoration (all brought from home), assorted weeds, flowers, pine needles, the kind of small fabric puff that hangs from a Mexican hat, bits of bark, a piece of bone, a feather, popsicle sticks, grass, sprigs of fennel ( Foeniculum vulgare ), and a piece of aluminum foil (all found in the Yard). They are building a "doll's house" among the roots of the stump, using dock leaves for beds, flowers and pine needles for pillows. One girl breaks the stems off some weeds and uses them as carrots to feed the rabbit. She makes the ballerina eat them too. Another makes a bed out of a long piece of bark, with a pine needle pillow. She gives her doll a shower, using a flower as a shower head, holding it in her hand and pretending to spray water. She uses the fabric puff as a scrubbing brush and pieces of bark as soap ("rose and mint scented!" she says). They use the hollow piece of bone as the base for a houseplant, stick flowers, a feather, and the popsicle stick in the hole and place the "plant" in the middle of the stump. The first girl picks a handful of long grass, and cuts it up by scraping it against the edge of the stump, turning it green. She says it's "paint." She walks over and washes her doll's hands with the bark soap to get the paint off. The third girl sticks some fennel in the rabbit's mouth, calling it "bunny salad". The second girl puts her doll on the bunny's back and rides it around. She fits the ballerina's foot into a crack in the stump to make it stand up, takes her doll and walks over to the grass-cutting edge and pretends to paint some more. The third girl cuts a bunch of grass and piles it on top of the bed of weeds. She puts a piece of foil, used as a plate, in a bedroom located on part of the stump lower than the rest of the "house". A crevice covered with a leaf becomes a bench. The dried leaf becomes a rug (they say they used it last week and it has dried since then.) As the house is built, the girls begin to play with their dolls and keep adding continuously to the furnishings, using objects from the environment. Boys occasionally played these small-scale, plant-part games, often mirroring, like girls, stereotypical sex-roles. "We play factories," says one. "Fr' instance we pretend we're going through the process of making paper. We take some dried leaves and stuff like that. The first guy lays them on one of the rocks and smashes 'em with a little rock, 'bam, bam.' Then he passes 'em to the next guy who does something like put them in water, and the next guy lays 'em out to dry on a sheet of real paper, so we pretend we've done the whole thing." In spite of the Yard's emphasis on peaceful play and the wise, nonexploitative use of natural resources, it could not adequately protect the children (read boys) from the militarism and mass media violence of the broader culture. "Pow, pow! I shot you," a boy shouts, pointing a piece of dry fennel stem at his friend. A third boy joins in with another piece of stem. They all get stems. "We use sticks for 'phasers' and pieces of rock for 'communica- tors'," one of them explains. "Look what I just made from the bush over there." He brandishes a willow stick with two stubby side branches as "triggers." Although these typical boys' play episodes with modest props plucked from the surroundings often expressed violence, it was strictly "pretend." Indeed, one of the most intriguing aspects of social play was the way in which mock violence was used to test and elaborate the social relations between best friends. "We're Munchkins having a sword fight," the boys yell, laughing, falling down in the grass, rolling around when they get "wounded." "We just pretend to hit each other and beat each other up," one of them says, laughing, "but we never cry or anything. It's fun. We love to roll around in the long grass." Two boys separate and start their own game. "You're under arrest!" one yells as he holds a wood chip "knife" to the other's back. "Stop, or I'm going to stab you!" He drops the knife on purpose. The other picks it up. "Do you think it's easy to get a knife through a person?" he jokes. They bend each other over the fence, threatening each other and laughing. One boy sits on the fence while a second collects a handful of wood chip knives off the ground. He throws them at his friend who uses one as a screwdriver, and pretends to remove some "screws" above the first boy's eyes. The first acts like a robot, moves mechanically, is stabbed, short-circuits, falls over, laughs, grabs a long stick, which he uses as a sword. Both threaten each other, taking turns stabbing each other. This evergreen leaf is transformed into a swimming pool for "fairies" made of small seed pods and flowers .

"We're making a potion to kill our enemies," disclosed one of a trio of girls as they moved among the Orchard Wayside, collecting ingredients. On a table they assembled piles of fennel flower heads; dock seeds (dried and undried); grass seeds; broken-up, dry, rotten wood; dirt and sand; flowering plum leaves; crushed leaves from wild raspberry and pigweed seeds (Amaranthus retroflexus). After a while, they stopped collecting, gathered around the table and, using plastic spoons saved from lunch, carefully counted out portions of the ingredients for mixing each potion. One of the larger- scale forms of plant play was shelter -building. Either individual shrubs or groups of shrubs were converted to this use or larger plant parts were used as construction material, and supported by existing shrubs or simple wooden frameworks con- structed as fixed elements within the Natural Resource Area. Variously known as "dens," "forts," "clubhouses," and "hideaways," Rudimentary shelter was made by a group of boys by "thatching" with dried weeds a simple wooden framework designed into the Natural Resource Area as a fixed element they featured in all manner of dramatic play episodes and "club" activity involving both girls and boys. Many other examples were recorded of children's use of plant parts. Clearly, they added important play and learning value to the setting. They also held tremendous potential for programmed activity in both formal environmental education and nonformal playwork - providing open-ended situations which creative teachcrs and play leaders enjoyed working with. Plant parts clearly add significant support to children's play. The most obvious recommendation is that appropriate (nontoxic) plantings be integrated into all children's play settings, not only to serve adult aesthetics (but without "Don't Pick" notices) but also, and more importantly, to stimulate childhood imagination. Much investigation has been made in recent years about the right kind of plantings to attract wildlife to urban neighborhoods. The significance of this effort needs to be extended so that it is also seen as a means to make urban playgrounds more attractive and valuable to children. Various shrub species provide raw material for themes ranging from mock battles to domestic play. 6 CNklren'« Environments Quarterly</page></plain_text>
