<plain_text><page sequence="1">Lawrence's Auto da fé: The Grand Inquisitor in The Plumed Serpent PHILIP SICKER In the waning days of 1929 a consumptive D.H. Lawrence summoned his strength to produce an introduction to S.S. Koteliansky's new translation of Dostoyevsky's "The Grand Inquisitor.*' Written less than three months before his death and published posthumously, this 3,500 word document was impelled by more than merely the novelist's obligation to an old friend and collaborator: it was Lawrence's recollection, summing up, and attempted resolution of his lifelong preoccupation with The Brothers Ka- ramazov and its author. Examining his successive responses to the Russian masterpiece "over a period of years," Lawrence had the "strange experi- ence"1 of discovering that as he read and reread Ivan's story of the Grand Inquisitor the text was reading and rereading him, that each descent into the tale was a journey into himself. As Lawrence's earlier commentaries on Dostoyevsky reveal, however, these self-readings were not altogether honest, and even as he appears to scan his past from an Olympian height in 1929, his final word on "The Grand Inquisitor" leaves much of his long-troubled relationship to its creator unexamined. I In all, Lawrence read The Brothers Karamazov three times - in 1913, shortly after it appeared in Constance Garnett's translation, again in April 1915, and in early 1926 - before perusing the newly-rendered COMPARATIVE LITERATURE STUDIES, Vol. 29, No. 4, 1992.

That each reading before 1929 should provoke an explosion of indignant responses scattered through letters, essays, and reviews suggests an uneasy enthrall' ment that sometimes bordered on obsession. Dostoyevsky, as Gary Cox has rightly observed, was the writer that Lawrence "loved to hate,"2 and his interest seemed to grow with his revulsion. Remembering "how fasci- nated and yet unconvinced" the tale of the Grand Inquisitor left him in 1913, Lawrence notes that, on first reading, "the story seemed to me just a piece of showing off: a display of cynical-satanical pose which was simply irritating" (Phoenix 283). But if the youthful writer could so easily dismiss Ivan's fable as melodramatized "blasphemy," why was he sufficiently "fasci- nated" to read this "lurid romance" again less than two years later? Law- rence's failure to analyze the source of his longstanding attraction to Dostoyevsky in general and "The Grand Inquisitor" in particular reflects his discomfort with a predecessor whose influence he could neither ac- knowledge nor escape. Under scrutiny, his final commentary disguises as much as it purports to reveal, acknowledging the gradual discovery of a philosophical kinship but evading the admission of a long-neglected liter- ary debt. After his first disappointment, Lawrence recalls that with each reread- inp he found "The Grand Inquisitor" "more depressing because, alas, more drearily true to life." The tale's most devastating truth, he explains, was its "final and unanswerable criticism of Christ" (283) - its indictment of the legacy of doubt, sin, and suffering that He left for man by increasing his moral freedom and making him responsible for his own salvation. Explicitly identifying both Ivan and Dostoyevsky with the ancient cardi- nal who judges Christ "inadequate," Lawrence paraphrases the Inquisitor's argument and concurs that the failure of Jesus "lies in the fact that Chris- tianity is too difficult ... for the vast mass of men," who demand "mira- cle, mystery, and authority" to restrain their unendurable freedom (284- 85). While Lawrence presents his recognition of this "truth" as a mature discovery, it was probably this very assault upon Christianity that drew him back to Dostoyevsky 's novel in 1915 and that prompted much of his subsequent jealous criticism. If, as Lawrence contends, "Dostoyevsky half hated Ivan" (283) for articulating a challenge that subverted his own Messianic purpose, we might say that Lawrence half hated Dostoyevsky for writing a parable whose truth helped to shape his vision but under- mined his originality.</page><page sequence="3">LAWRENCE AND DOSTOYEVSKY 419 Ever insistent about his uniqueness, Lawrence effectively absolves him- self from all direct literary influence when, in his Foreword to Fantasia of the Unconscious (1921), he contends that, upon finding traces of his own incipient ideas in other works, "I only remember hints - and I proceed by intuition."3 Predictably, he adopts an adversarial posture toward those writers whose concerns, vision, or style most closely approximate his own, particularly those whose work has received a powerful cultural sanction. Thus, Hardy, Tolstoy, and Freud characteristically serve as whetstones upon whom Lawrence sharpens his own fictional methods and sexual ideology, while less conspicuously related writers whom he has helped to rediscover - Giovanni Verga, Cooper, and Melville - gain his strongest favor. None of these predecessors, however, elicits from Lawrence quite the tortured ambivalence that the inwardly-divided Dostoyevsky did, be- cause none of them conjoined in their works so much that Lawrence found repugnant with so much of himself. And if Lawrence resented Dostoyevsky for their differences, it was their similarities that he could neither forgive nor fully acknowledge. Ever since E.M. Forster, in Aspects of the Novel, classified Lawrence and Dostoyevsky within a small novelistic subset of bardic "prophets" whose theme is "the universe,"4 critics have illuminated other likenesses: their fusion of fiction and philosophy in opposition to formal narrative codes (Zytaruk);5 their reliance on psychic doubles and division of experience into polarities of flesh and spirit, being and personality, male and female, aggression and inertia (Cox); and their conception of evil as a function of mechanistic, devouring will (Panichas).6 While it is possible that all such similarities threatened Lawrence and contributed to his hostility, these critics are more concerned with establishing kinship than with demon- strating influence. More important, scholarship has heretofore ignored the central significance of "The Grand Inquisitor" in Lawrence's response to Dostoyevsky, and its relationship to his evolving ideas about politics and religion, freedom and authority, between 1915 and 1925. Most re- cently, David Lodge has found in Lawrence's fiction the polyphonic tex- ture of competing, unresolved voices and ideas that Mikhail Bakhtin contends Dostoyevsky "invented." One characteristic of such "dialogic" fiction is what Bakhtin calls "doubly-oriented speech," whereby an author/narrator may absorb the voice or tonality of another writer into his own.7 As we shall see, one can occasionally hear the oracular "borrowed discourse" (19) of "The Grand Inquisitor" half-submerged in The Plumed</page><page sequence="4">420 COMPARATIVE LITERATURE STUDIES Serpent, but Lawrence never openly allows Dostoyevsky to collaborate in the novel's meaning. Far from emerging in either parody or homage, Dostoyevsky's voice seems to issue forth, almost in defiance of Lawrence's will, as one of those remembered "hints" that the novelist could not suppress. Indeed, for most of Lawrence's career, Dostoyevsky plays the unacknowledged role of usurping opponent in a creative struggle that conforms, in its general outline, to Harold Bloom's "anxiety of influence" paradigm. For a "strong poet" such as Lawrence, art must be "always at work imagining its own origin" in denial of the very past from which it draws its strength.8 Lawrence's mature novels are not entirely Bloom's "psychic battlegrounds" (3), for their central dramas involve much more than the author's grappling to deny and master his forebears, but they do bear witness to his confrontation with Dostoyevskian political and philo- sophical influences that he refused to concede but could not resist. Lawrence was straining against more than Dostoyevsky's ideas, how- ever. His circle of friends and correspondents included not only Kotel- iansky, but Dostoyevsky translator Constance Garnett and her husband Edward, as well as John Middleton Murry, whose study of the Russian writer Lawrence reviled as the blind hero-worship of an ostrich with its head in the sand.9 Thus, smashing the Dostoyevsky icon was an expres- sion of Lawrence's jealous contempt for many things: for Murry's rejection of his infamous invitation to Bludbudershaft at a time (1916) when the critic was exalting in Dostoyevsky's non-physical humanitarian love, for his friends' collective devotion to a competing prophet-colossus before whom non-Russian writers could only "play about the feet,"10 and for the prevailing reverence of Georgian intellectuals, typified by Virginia Woolf's description of Dostoyevsky's works as "composed purely and wholly out of the stuff of the soul."11 Lawrence recalls answering Murry's early enthusiasm for "The Grand Inquisitor" tersely in 1913: "It seems to me just rubbish" (Phoenix 283). But neither this dismissal nor his equally blunt declaration, "I don't like Dostoyevsky" (Letters 311), in March 1915 kept him from requesting a copy of The Brothers Karamazov to reread two weeks later. A survey of this personal correspondence serves as an essen- tial preliminary context for tracing the Grand Inquisitor's presence in Lawrence's later fiction. Lawrence's most extended fiilminations against Dostoyevsky occur in his letters of 1915 and 1916 when, amid the protracted cataclysm of war, he was laboring to bring forth his own political and religious "philosophy"</page><page sequence="5">LAWRENCE AND DOSTOYEVSKY 421 in "The Crown" and the metamorphosing Women in Love. Addressing himself to such Slavophile friends as Murry, Koteliansky, and Ottoline Morrel, Lawrence could expect little sympathy, and the implicit resistance of these auditors merely amplifies his invective in what amounts to a series of hostile dialogues with his Russian alter-ego. Dostoyevsky is a "rat, slither- ing along in hate, in the shadows," he writes in April 1915, a "will fixed and gripped like a trap," a man with "not a grain of the passion of love within him" (Letters 311, 314). Worst of all, the Russian writer is a hypo- crite: a misanthropic "introvert" filled with a "passion of hate" that "dis- guis[es] itself in terms of love" (314). The altruistic embrace and self- sacrificial spirit embodied in saintly Alyosha and Prince Myshkin is, for Lawrence, a cynical pretense through which Dostoyevsky attempted to hide his pathological disgust for man. Reading Dostoyevsky's own letters, Lawrence discovers a man who "never, never wanted anybody to come close to him," and who "exerted a repelling influence on everybody" (3 14). Curiously, it is this embittered and solitary Dostoyevsky with whom Lawrence most powerfully identifies and to whom, often against his will, he is insistently drawn. Without making explicit the source of his attrac- tion, Lawrence concludes a 1915 letter to Koteliansky given over to denouncing the novelist's spurious "Christ-worship" by confessing that Dostoyevsky is a "great man," for whom he feels "the greatest admira- tion," and "even ... a sort of subterranean love" (314). Lawrence's final phrase is doubly suggestive, implying that he characteristically disguises his underlying affinity for a subterranean (but often disguised) part of Dostoyevsky. This submerged and subversive Dostoyevsky, whose magnet- ism Lawrence briefly acknowledges, can only be the writer who, defying his Messianic Christianity, distilled himself into a series of metaphysical rebels - the narrator of Notes from Underground, Raskolnikov, Stavrogin, and, above all, Ivan Karamazov. Lawrence's painful attraction to this side of the Russian writer becomes clearer in light of his more reasoned hatred for other aspects of Dostoyev- sky. Eight months after denouncing him as a Christian poseur, Lawrence revealed to Murry his deeper disapproval: Dostoyevsky's willful "mania to be infinite, to be God" (Letters 543). Focusing principally upon The Brothers Karamazov, Lawrence explains that the activity of the mégalo- manie Dostoyevskian will is dualistic and produces two corrupt character types. First, there is the selfless Christian, Alyosha, whose will to the infinite emerges as a "desire for ... spiritual turn-the-other-cheek con-</page><page sequence="6">422 COMPARATIVE LITERATURE STUDIES summation," a self 'diffusive emotional identification with all of suffering humanity. This yearning for integration with "the universal conscious- ness" is, for Lawrence, equivalent to Whitman's democratic embrace. In both the individual will becomes "purely selfless" for purposes of its own enlargement and apotheosis - the "Christian ecstasy" of becoming "dis- seminated" until one is "transcendently super-conscious" (543). Both Christian and democratic creeds promulgate a love of one's neighbor that is actually "self-love extended to cover the whole of humanity." The other form of the Dostoyevskian willfulness expresses itself not in Alyosha's insidious self-abnegation, but more directly in the "all-consuming" self- assertion of his brother, Dmitri, a psychic predator who seeks the dark "sensual ecstasy of universality" by "devouring" his victims in "the plea- sures of love" (543-44). Lawrence recognized that these ostensibly antithetical "doubles" in Dostoyevsky are actually different versions of the will's desire to be "God- like and absolved from all relation i.e. free" (543). We find in "free," I think, the essential clue to both Lawrence's love and hate for his Russian predecessor. In Alyosha and Dmitri, Lawrence beheld the nightmare of modern man's moral and political obsession with freedom of will, a preoc- cupation so desperate and mechanical that its expression could only de- stroy other bodies and souls, and its ultimate fulfillment could be nothing less than the absolute freedom of self-extinction. Thus, Lawrence ob- serves, "Christian ecstasy leads to imbecility . . . [and] sensual ecstasy leads to universal murder" (544), whose logical end is suicide. Lawrence's own great novel of these years, Women in Love, not only dramatizes the death-wish that underlies the unrestricted exercise of will, but draws upon the same self-abnegating/self-asserting dichotomy that he identifies in Dostoyevsky. Incorporating the Christian-democratic yearning for self- enlargement through universal love, mine-owner Thomas Crich is a "sub- tle funeral bird, feeding on the miseries of the people" that he helps to create, drinking their "sordid tales" with "a sort of mournful, sympathetic satisfaction."12 Crich's sensualist son, Gerald, no less than Dmitri Karama- zov or Rogozhin, finds his gratification only in moments of sadistic aggres- sion when lovers, employees, even horses, are reduced to "the passive substance of his will" (72). Bringing Gerald ineluctably to his father's freshly-dug grave late in the novel, Lawrence not only unites these diver- gent forms of willfulness, but locates the place in which freedom finds its final resolution.</page><page sequence="7">LAWRENCE AND DOSTOYEVSKY 423 Not surprisingly, Lawrence's vision of the destructive consequences of uncontrolled free will also shaped the doctrine of political leadership that he began to formulate at this point in his life. In July 1915, three months after acknowledging his "subterranean love" for Dostoyevsky, Lawrence wrote to Lady Ottoline that the idea of a "democratic electorate," based on what he had described to Bertrand Russell as the "three-fanged Ser- pent" of "Liberty, Equality, and Fraternity" (Letters 366), needed to be strangled for society's salvation. Judging "the working man" unfit to select a government, Lawrence urges that "real leaders" step forward and assume power that "shall not rest upon the choice of the mob" (367). Instead, egalitarian liberties must bow before "a Dictator" who "shall be almost immune" to the desires of the masses. The democratic principle must yield as "the highest understanding dictate[s] for the lower understandings" (366). Midway through his letter, Lawrence admits that his new "ideol- ogy" has been colored by his recent reading of the "early Greek philoso- phers," but he concludes with a more telling offhand allusion: "I have asked Radford to send you on your Karamazov'1 (367). The casualness of this reference to a borrowed book belies (intentionally, perhaps) its acute significance. The novelist who perceived the catastrophic consequences of man's indiscriminate will and advocated a supreme "Ruler" and "an aristocracy of people who have Wisdom" (364) could not have been impervious to Ivan's denunciation of human liberty in "The Grand Inquisi- tor," and his vision of an all-powerful "wise-spirit" surrounded by an heroic Elect to whom self-lacerating humanity might surrender its "terri- ble gift" of freedom. 13 Nor could the self-conscious rebel who announced to Russell in July of 1915, "I am rid of all my Christian religiosity," have been immune to the influence of a text that he would describe, fourteen years later, as the most "deadly [and] devastating" challenge to Christian- ity ever mounted (Phoenix 283). Indeed, without saying so, Lawrence seems to read Alyosha and Dmitri through the mind of their brother. Like Lawrence, Ivan is repelled equally by Alyosha's tormented Christianity and Dmitri's compulsive eroticism, regarding them as complementary and self-destructive responses to "the freedom of conscience" that man cannot endure (BK 302). It is characteristic of Lawrence's vexed evasion of Dostoyevsky's influ- ence that he never mentions the Grand Inquisitor episode in his long 1915-16 epistolary commentaries and has relatively little to say about Ivan himself. Referring to Ivan incorrectly as "Stepan Karamazov" (a</page><page sequence="8">424 COMPARATIVE LITERATURE STUDIES lapse so improbable given Lawrence's knowledge of a novel he had read twice in two years as to suggest purposeful camouflage), Lawrence identi- fies him as a "third type," whose will is "non-emotional," "mental," and "rational" (Letters 543). Beyond contradistinguishing Ivan's unspecified "aspirations and ideals" from Christian and voluptuary forms of self- engorgement, Lawrence can only hypothesize that Dostoyevsky meant to embody Ivan's rational and utilitarian nature in the Devil who visits him in the form of a "decayed social gentleman" (544). While Lawrence's reading of this scene is plausible, his assessment of what Ivan's "aspirations and ideals" meant both to Dostoyevsky and himself is woefully incom- plete. We find a more extreme evasion after Lawrence's third encounter with the novel in 1926. Having announced that "the time has come to read Dostoievsky again, not as fiction but as life ... I will order Karama- zov at once,"14 he asserts a year later, "One gets tired of being told that Dostoievsky's The Legend of the Grand Inquisitor 'is the most profound declaration which ever was made about man and life.' As far as I'm concerned . . . the more Dostoievsky gets worked up about the tragic nature of the human soul, the more I lose interest. I have read The Grand Inquisitor three times, and never can remember what it's really about. I make this as a confession, not as a vaunt" (Phoenix 367). Lawrence pro- tests rather too much here, and his memory is both selective and strangely inconsistent: just two years afterward he recalls having found the central "criticism of Christ" in Ivan's tale to be increasingly "true" and unforgetta- bly "depressing" (Phoenix 283). Only in this essay written at the end of his life could Lawrence suggest that the source of his inveterate attraction to Ivan and his strange "poem" lay in their central concern with the dilemma of man's freedom and his need for restrictive earthly authority. So notori- ously reluctant was the novelist to acknowledge even this affinity, how- ever, that to discover it in his fiction the reader must adopt Lawrence's own maxim and trust not "the teller," but "the tale." In doing so, one finds that five years before his essay on "The Grand Inquisitor," Lawrence betrayed his massive, but still unspecified, debt to Ivan's parable in his most Dostoyevskian "tale" - The Plumed Serpent. II First composed at Lake Chapala in a burst of creative energy during May and June of 1924 and rewritten in a similar frenzy six months later,</page><page sequence="9">LAWRENCE AND DOSTOYEVSKY 425 Lawrence's Mexican novel is a manifesto directed against the horrors of moral and political liberty in an age of degenerate faith. The bullfight that Kate attends with two American friends establishes Lawrence's position in the novel's opening pages. Serving as metaphor both for the decadence of an imported European custom and for a newer democratic culture gone wrong, this ritual slaughter is sustained less by the force of tradition than by man's perverse exercise of free will. While Kate's disgust at the goring of the picadors' horses, with its "smell of blood" and "whiff of bursten bowels,"15 cannot match Ivan's protest at the brutalization of innocent children, both are repelled at man's unrestrained capacity to destroy help- less creatures for his amusement. Just as a general, in the most harrowing story Ivan recounts, stages for his servants the processional hunt and dismemberment of a naked peasant boy, so the toreadors of The Plumed Serpent engage in a formalized and public "performance" of torture. Law- rence's spectators, however, are voluntary witnesses and, as such, become moral participants in the carnage. The "modern disease of tolerance" (PS 26) that lures them to the bullfight is an extension of the democratic cult of personal freedom in which all experiences, including sadism and self- disgust, are admissible. Kate watches her American companions, Owen and Villiars, "picking over the garbage of sensation" (27-28) and feels, with Ivan, "how loathsome the human species" can be (24). Although she initially regards the corrida as a world apart, she soon discovers that torture and death are not confined to the national spectacle. In the modern Mexican republic, as in the bullring, the unrestricted and desper- ate exercise of will leads to prédation, producing a nation of "Victims and Victimizers" (218). For Lawrence, as for the creator of Fyodor Karamazov and Svidrigaylov, the deliberate corruption of children is the most patho- logical and unforgivable expression of this impulse. Watching two Indian urchins stone a water fowl, whose legs they have tied to a heavy stone, Kate realizes, "This country would have its victim. America would have its victim" (218). Led on by a loutish teenager, these four-year-old "infant men" (215) are depraved by example, ignorant victims in the act of victimizing. In their veneration of individual freedom, the Christian and demo- cratic religions of Mexico ensure that this vicious cycle will continue. The Grand Inquisitor's central charge against Jesus and the religion he founded is Lawrence's own complaint in The Plumed Serpent: by refusing to compel faith and enforce virtue through earthly authority, Christianity ignores</page><page sequence="10">426 COMPARATIVE LITERATURE STUDIES man's "everlasting craving ... to find someone to worship" (BK 301). The capacity to question, to doubt, to rebel, to sin is a burden that most of humanity cannot support. In declining to remove "freedom of faith" (300), Christ refused to "cut short the suffering of men for a thousand years." "Nothing," the Inquisitor tells the returning Savior, "has ever been more insupportable for man and a human society than freedom" (299). Rather than satisfying the humane injunction to "feed men, and then ask [for] virtue" (300), Jesus disappeared from the earth, leaving behind only the insubstantial bread of his example of free resistance to temptation in the desert. But ordinary men, Dostoyevsky and Lawrence both insist, are incapable of such god-like restraint - the demands of their animal nature and the onus of free choice are too oppressive for them to bear. Seven years before beginning The Plumed Serpent, Lawrence ob- jected in his letters to "the divinity in man business" that he found so pernicious in Christianity (Phoenix II 537). Mankind's deepest religious yearning, Lawrence recognized, is to worship divinity in the flesh, not to emulate Christ's example of self-abnegating spirituality. "People are not fallen angels," he insisted, "they are merely people" (544). The demands of freedom alone impel their futile yearnings for godliness. Ironically, this protest, so close to Ivan's own, is directed specifically against the theologi- cal vision of Dostoyevsky who, Lawrence charges, falsified humanity by elevating certain characters to the status of "religious units" (544). One might well object that Lawrence's Ramon and Cipriano, in their own ways, come closer to idealized religious ciphers than do any of Dostoyev- sky's figures, but the vast majority of Lawrence's Mexicans are all too horribly human: they illustrate the characteristic weakness, doubt, and rapacity that renders Christianity so ineffectual in the novel. Theirs is a nation given over to "the instriking thud of the heavy knife, stabbing into a living body" (PS 135), a country where hopelessness is the only birth- right. Dona Carlota, "an intense, almost exalted Catholic" (156), laments that "so many children are born in Mexico . . . and so many die" (157), yet, like Ivan's devout brother Aloysha, she cannot bring herself to chal- lenge the "harmony" of the invisible Deity that permits such suffering. Her husband, Don Ramon, does protest the conditions of existence. In seeking with Dostoyevsky's Inquisitor to "correct" Jesus' work on earth (BK 308), he identifies Christianity's central failure: the Conquistadors brought to Mexico not the living divinity-in-the-flesh that all men crave,</page><page sequence="11">LAWRENCE AND DOSTOYEVSKY 427 but "a dead god on the cross," an incorporeal symbol whose only "com- fort" for human tears is a remote and ambiguous promise - "the scentless rose-trees of the afterlife, when you are dead" (PS 124). Similarly, the Inquisitor charges that Christ, in his sacrificial death and ascension out of the sensate world, left humankind a model of redemption that is "excep- tional, vague and enigmatic . . ♦ utterly beyond the strength of men" (BK 302). It is perhaps more than coincidence that the early sixteenth cen- tury, when Cortez used the sword to bring Christianity to the Aztecs, corresponds to the most heresy-ridden and tyrannical phase of the Inquisi- tion, the period during which Ivan sets his fable. In the New World, as well as the Old, violent tests of faith became necessary in the face of man's existential resistance to the demands of an invisible God. In a single epoch of Spanish history, Lawrence and Dostoyevsky each find evidence of human rebellion against a religion too shadowy and immate- rial to command faith. Unable to free itself from the "heavy serpentine coils" of its atavistic instincts, Mexico can neither believe in the muti- lated "dead god" nor obey his moral example. If the inhabitants of Ivan's Seville have forgotten their Redeemer, their racially-mixed Mexican de- scendants are, for Ramon, "a people that has never been redeemed, that has not known a Savior" ( 136). And if the Grand Inquisitor can complain that "it is fifteen centuries since man has ceased to see signs from Heaveh" (BK 294), Ramon knows that after nineteen centuries man's need for the "manifestations" (PS 291) that instill belief is even more profound. Lawrence's Mexico, however, needs more than charismatic religious leadership; the proliferation of democratic institutions has left the country poverty-stricken, while generating its own form of moral anarchy. Judge Burlap, a long-time witness to the nation's social upheaval, sums up the essence of egalitarian license for Kate: "What they call liberty here is just freedom to commit crime. That's what Labour means, that's what they all mean. Free crime, nothing else" (38). Curmudgeon though he is, the Judge's assessment seems incontrovertibly true. A moment later Law- rence's heroic double, Don Ramon, offers a complementary description of liberation politics. Leading all of Mexico's populist revolutions he sees "a skeleton walking ahead of a great number of people, waving a black banner" that reads not "Viva la Liberté," but "Viva la Muerte." In a nation that cannot bear its freedom, the rhetoric of emancipation merely conceals the impulse to destruction: "Whenever a Mexican . . . says Viva! he really means Death for somebody or other" (40). Thus, Lawrence</page><page sequence="12">428 COMPARATIVE LITERATURE STUDIES suggests, if Christianity offers for adoration a crucified corpse, democracy promotes the worship of death itself. Ramon knows that religion and politics can redeem Mexico - and mankind - only by making faith and virtue inescapable. Only inspired compulsion can harness a will "subject to an ever-recurring and fathom- less . . . hatred of life itself" (135). Such a will, founded upon doubt and despair, must express itself in perpetual conflict and brutish opposition, whether the object of contention be a continent or a stadium seat. Vil- liers' quarrel with a usurping Mexican at the bullfight is the reductio ad absurdum of this individual and national impulse: "Oh land of the free! Which of these two men was to win the struggle for conflicting liberty?" (13). For Lawrence, these degrading encounters are actually the ego's misdirected and self-injuring protests against the conditions of its own freedom. As Cipriano, Ramon's acolyte, explains to Kate, men and women have, paradoxically, become imprisoned by the idea of personal freedom and by the mechanical notion that they must exercise it to affirm their being. "You think like a modern woman [that] because you belong to the Anglo-Saxon or Teutonic world . . . [you] are altogether free - But you only think like this because you have these thoughts put in your head. ... So when you say you are free, you are not free. You are com- pelled all the time to be thinking U.S.A. thoughts - compelled I must say. You have not as much choice as a slave" (204-05). In exhorting Kate to embrace the ancient worship of Quetzalcoatl and to bow down before the god's incarnation in Ramon, Cipriano seeks to free the Irish woman from her twentieth-century obsession with freedom. Lawrence's evolving belief that one is free only in relinquishing individual will to the man-god one so deeply craves is, of course, central to Ivan's argument, and Cipriano's appeal to Kate unmistakably echoes the Inquisitor's words of Christ: "we shall persuade [men] that they will only become free when they renounce their freedom to us and submit to us" (BK 306). We find Dostoyevskian rhetoric reverberating again later in the novel as Kate meditates the complete submission of will that Cipriano and Ramon have urged. Realiz- ing that "if one tries to be unlimited one becomes horrible," she repudi- ates the principle of freedom: " 'No!' she cried to herself, *my ego and my individuality are not worth that ghastly price' " (439). Just before begin- ning his tale, Ivan had similarly abrogated the Christian doctrine of free will for exacting "too high a price" (BK 291) in human wickedness and suffering.</page><page sequence="13">LAWRENCE AND DOSTOYEVSKY 429 Lawrence's solution for human misery is Ivan's own: a self-appointed figure of awe-inspiring natural authority who, with the consent of the masses, appropriates both religious and political control. Mankind will be "happy" (308), the Inquisitor explains, only when he genuflects before the leader of a "universal state" who will "keep his conscience" (305) and dictate belief. In order to promote this fusion of spiritual and civic author- ity, Ivan had earlier proposed that the Russian ecclesiastical courts absorb their secular counterparts, so that the State itself might eventually be consolidated within a Church structure headed by a single superior indi- vidual. The exercise of absolute power, mystical and salvific, is the aim both of Dostoyevsky's ancient cardinal and of Lawrence's own grand inquisitor, Don Ramon. Each gathers around him a group of priestly initiates to create an alternative religion to Christianity, one that answers the soul's deep desire for obedience by providing "manifestations" that "connect [it] to the universe" (PS 264). For the Inquisitor, this enforced connection satisfies man's anguished craving to lose individuality in the unity of an impersonal, all-encompassing state. Don Ramon shares the cardinal's vision of authority, but his seasonal hymns and rituals of Quet- zalcoatl generate a more genuine, sensual unity by awakening the faithful to the mysteries of the natural universe, putting each man "into touch with a far, far greater life than if he stood alone" (Phoenix 290). Lawrence may well have had Ramon in mind when, near the end of his "Grand Inquisitor" preface, he calls for a "nature-hero" who, in removing the burden of free will, "puts the sun into the heart of the ordinary man" (Phoenix 290). Cipriano, long tormented by his inability to believe in the God of his Jesuit teachers, finds in Ramon and his revival of the Aztec pantheon an irresistible call to faith: "I believe in him," he tells Kate, "[and] I tell you why. Because he has the power to compel me. If he hadn't the power . . . how should I believe? . . . How else should one believe except by being compelled? When I grew up and my god-father could not compel me to believe, I was very unhappy. . . . But Ramon compels me, and that is very good. It makes me very happy, when I know I can't escape."16 Cipriano's declaration of faith echoes the gospel according to Don Ramon, for whom the world has "gone as far as it [can] go in the good, gentle . . . direction" of Christianity, with its emphasis upon "the emo- tion of love and the greater emotion of liberty" (206-07). "Nauseated" by human will, Ramon regards liberty, be it moral or political, as "a rotten</page><page sequence="14">430 COMPARATIVE LITERATURE STUDIES old wine-skin" (73) that cannot contain man's yearning to bow down before a God alive in the flesh. Like the Inquisitor, Ramon realizes that man is "waiting, eternally waiting" (161) for something to worship and that, because his faith is "fragile," he must "live by manifestations" (360) of divinity in the material world. In Lawrence's Mexico, the thirst for such incarnations is nearly insatiable. Early in the novel, Kate is repelled by her housekeeper's desire to adore her as the embodiment of the pale- skinned Blessed Virgin; yet, through Ramon's instruction, she eventually ascends to the role of fertility goddess within the Aztec pantheon.17 In order to remain a source of veneration, however, she learns that she must perpetually maintain her religious identity, lest the people "murder you and violate you for having worshipped you" (436). Ramon's own greatest fear is that the nation's faith in "the living Quetzalcoatl" will fade when he, like the Christian savior, must "die and disappear from the face of the earth" (427). Thus, Ramon perpetuates popular belief in his own immor- tality and answers Mexico's need for an irresistible call to faith with the same regimen that Dostoyevsky's prelate employed: miracle, mystery, and authority. These three gifts, Lawrence maintained in his essay on "The Grand Inquisitor," provide the sustenance that "mankind demands, and will always demand" (Phoenix 285). Whereas Ivan's Christ rejected hu- mankind's need for the miraculous when he refused Satan's challenge to change stones into bread,18 Ramon wisely founds his religion upon an ostensibly supernatural occurrence: emerging naked from the "spermy" waters of Lake Sayula, this "man of great stature" proclaims to a group of Indian women that the old gods are coming back to Mexico (56-57). Plagiarizing John the Baptist, Ramon heralds the advent of Quetzalcoatl, whose earthly identity he himself shortly assumes. Unlike Dostoyevsky's godless Inquisitor, who hides from mankind the unbearable "secret" that there has been no redemption and that "beyond the grave they will find nothing but death" (BK 308), Ramon believes in a sacred mystery behind the god-man he purports to embody. His chants celebrate the natural mystery of human sexual life rhythmically allied to the rising and setting sun, the rotation of the seasons. Not surprisingly, Lawrence regrets that Dostoyevsky's cardinal, with his "withered face" and "bloodless aged lips" (BK 296, 311) cynically perpetuates the traditions of orthodox Roman Catholicism rather than celebrating "the rapture of the Easter kiss" (Phoe- nix 288). In another essay written shortly before his death, "A Propos of Lady Chatterley's Lover," Lawrence maintained that such erotic rituals,</page><page sequence="15">LAWRENCE AND DOSTOYEVSKY 431 coordinated with the life-cycle in nature, were central to the "old Church" and elemental to all true religions. 19 While Ramon preaches this vitalist doctrine, he faces a challenge of miraculous conversion that is nearly identical to the Inquisitor's. Yet, as Lawrence observes in "On Being Religious" (1924), the problem of faith isn't so much "whether God exists or not," but rather "how to get at Him" (Phoenix 726). In laboring to "get at" the Plumed Serpent, Ramon embraces the Inquisitor's wisdom that mankind, tormented by the slightest ambiguity, must often be "de- ceived" for its own ease.20 Thus, Lawrence's hero conceals from his peas- ant followers the truth that Quetzalcoatl is not a personage but a princi- ple, not an anthropomorphic divinity but, as he tells Kate, "only the symbol of the best a man can be, in the coming days" (273). Ramon's self- appointed role as the Aztec god is itself, he admits, a skillfully contrived "manifestation" (316); Quetzalcoatl is "just a living word" designed to help the faithful "find the beginning of the way to their own manhood" (209). In short, manipulation and deception are meant to give men greater access to their natural sources of religious feeling.21 But, despite his hope that magical enactments will help to awaken men to the "unfath- omable life-mystery" within themselves (273), Ramon comes increasingly to share Ivan's belief that there can be no faith or virtue without contin- ual reinforcement of the supernatural and awe-inspiring. In the spirit of the Inquisitor, who holds that "man seeks not so much God as the miracu- lous" (BK 303), he responds to Kate's question, "Does one need gods?" by asserting, "Why yes. One needs manifestations . . ." (291). Far from being convinced that he is Quetzalcoatl, as many critics have main- tained,22 Ramon repeatedly confesses to those whom he wishes to recruit as guardians of the religious mystery that his impersonation of the serpen- tine god is a histrionic necessity. "I only pretend that the Aztec god is coming back to the Mexicans," he tells his sons (295). Months later, he advises them, "I am the father who calls himself the living Quetzalcoatl" (356, italics mine). Half savior, half showman, Ramon shares the Inquisitor's awareness that merely conjuring occasional miracles, such as the explosions of col- ored flame at the reopening of the church, cannot save humanity from its capacity for doubt. In order to correct the failures of Christianity and "hold captive" man's conscience (BK 303), religion must cultivate the power of impenetrable "mystery" within daily life. Unlike the agonizing enigma of Christ's invisible presence in the Eucharist, the baffling solem-</page><page sequence="16">432 COMPARATIVE LITERATURE STUDIES nities of Quetzalcoatl allow no rational questioning, but enforce the sus- pension of disbelief that humanity craves. The hierarchy of living gods, in which Cipriano and Kate are ceremonially married, is the grandest expres- sion of Ramon's proliferating mysticism, but Lawrence's prophet also fire* quently invokes the word "mystery" in describing the elaborately fabri- cated prayers and dances, sacraments and costumes that weave themselves into the texture of day-to-day experience. Drawn down to the lake by a newspaper report of an Aztec revival, Kate seeks in these ostensibly atavistic practices deliverance from the "automatism" of her will: "Give me the mystery and let the world live again for met [she] cried to her own soul" (105). Specifically, she yearns to submit to an erotic male mystery, "a powerful, potent thing . . . greater than the individual" (152). Soon, she finds herself hypnotized by the rhythms of Ramon's indecipherable "hymns." The compelling force of these incanta- tions lies not in their transparent mythmaking (wherein a weary Christ surrenders His reign to the newly awakened Quetzalcoatl), but rather in the visceral power of their reverberating sound. Giving themselves up to the chant, as they surrender their wills to Ramon, the faithful "took not much active notice" of the content of the hymns, yet "craved for them, as men crave for alcohol, as a relief from the weariness and ennui of [the] man-made world" (260). So dense and inscrutable is Ramon's evolving symbolism of stars and vegetation, dragons and dogs, that his listeners never suspect that the hymns are themselves "man-made." Rather, these phantasmagoric inventions answer in the people "a strange, submerged desire for things beyond the world" (261). Like the unfathomable vision of death and damnation that the Inquisitor preaches, Ramon's ceremonies evoke "a mystery which [men] must follow blindly, even against their conscience" (BK305). Ultimately, sovereign mystery removes conscience altogether. Entranced by a hymn calling for death to the "grey dogs" of modern Mexico (378), Ramon's followers watch impassively as Cipriano, acting as high priest, ritually executes three heretics with his knife. "What do I care if he kills people," Kate reflects after their marriage, "[h]is flame is young and clean" (394). These occult performances induce more than moral anesthesia, how- ever. They also generate what Lawrence, in "Hymns in a Man's Life," describes as the one "natural" religious sense - "the sense of wonder."23 Attributing his own religiosity as a child to the "wonderful sound" of devotional words such as "Galilee" and "beauty of holiness," Lawrence</page><page sequence="17">LAWRENCE AND DOSTOYEVSKY 433 explains that his ignorance of their meaning filled him with a sense of "splendor." "I don't know what 'beauty of holiness1 is. It easily becomes cant or nonsense. But if you don't think about it - and why should you - it has a magic" (600). Heathen renegade though he is, Ramon's own litanies, verse parables, maranathas, exhortations, valedictions to Jesus and Mary, and invocations to ceremonial hours of the day generate a similar magic by combining primitive music with an even more elliptical language. Sitting next to Cipriano at the rededication of the Church as an Aztec temple, Kate hears the hierophants chant, "Put sleep so black as beauty in the secret of my belly. Put star-oil over me" (351). Despite vague suggestions of sexual darkness and impregnation, Kate's sudden yearning for mystical union with Cipriano has less to do with the words themselves than with the insistent drumbeat and pulsating voices. Noting that "as knowledge increases, wonder decreases" (Phoenix H 598), Law- rence traces his own religious disillusionment to the dawn of rational scrutiny. Not surprisingly, Ramon is at pains to eliminate all such question- ing among the peasants by establishing hymns and sacraments to com- memorate every phase of quotidian experience: "The final mystery is one mystery," he assures Kate, "but the manifestations are many" (360). Many, indeed: Mexico, it seems, must be insulated within a charmed circle of thaumaturgical display. Ramon's performances answer the human yearning for self-surrender, above all, through an exercise of absolute control that promotes "fear, and joy, and relief" (261). In his Hymns of Quetzalcoatl there speaks "a new voice, the voice of master and authority" (261). For Lawrence, as for Dostoyevsky's hero, temporal mastery is, at once, the most overpowering and appealing of all manifestations. The Inquisitor explains that "author- ity" not only enforces worship but, by uniting the subjugated masses into "one unanimous and harmonious ant-heap," answers "the craving for universal unity," which is "the last anguish of men" (BK 306). Hence, he works to bring forth the universal church-state that Ivan had earlier adumbrated. Lawrence's visionary prophet, Ramon, seeks this same all- encompassing secular control. Yielding to the temptation to earthly power after a brief hesitation, he corrects Christ's third failure in the desert by responding as Lawrence maintains the Lord should have: "Well look here [Satan], my boy, I'm going to take it all from you, so don't worry. The world and the power and the riches thereof. . ." (Phoenix II 575-6). Following in the Inquisitor's footsteps, Ramon's ultimate aim is not</page><page sequence="18">434 COMPARATIVE LITERATURE STUDIES merely to make the cult of the Plumed Serpent the official faith of Mexico (as Montes eventually decrees it), but to absorb the government into his religious hierarchy. Dismissing socialism in Dostoyevsky's own phrase as "a social religion"24 Ramon labors to create a religious state and, ultimately, to promote his version of Ivan's mystical world-state: "the Universal Church of Christ and Mohammed, and Buddha, and Quetzalcoatl and all the others" (264), governed by a superior few whose vision is "interna- tional or cosmopolitan or cosmic" (248). Only religious leadership ex- tended to the secular realm will serve this end, but, as he advises the Mexican bishop, contemporary Catholicism has failed to seize the unify- ing political power that mankind requires. The Inquisitor's older version of Christianity through fear would proba- bly appeal to Ramon. Indeed, his most dramatic exercise of authority - the ritual executions of religious/political dissenters and the "autodafé" in which he burns an image of Christ - unmistakably resemble those of Dostoyevsky's ancient cardinal. Ivan begins his story by describing the sacrifice of heretics to "the glory of God" in the fires of the "splendid auto da je" (295), and Lawrence, adopting this phrase nearly synonymous with the Inquisition, gives it the signal importance of a chapter title when Ramon incinerates the Church icons and replaces these saints with a living pantheon. Here, as elsewhere, Ramon's habit of borrowing from the customs of the religion he is supplanting is both deliberate and ironic. Despite his mythic enactment of an Aztec god, Lawrence's hero is ances- trally "almost pure Spaniard" (64). In the style of his sixteenth-century forbears, he incorporates aspects of the auto da /é's dual significance - a solemn pronouncement of judgment on heretics, and an execution that purifies the faith. With Ivan, Ramon knows that bloodshed without the trappings of religious authority is merely a reign of terror; onlookers must see in the public killing a transcendental judgment that precludes doubt and disobedience. Like the Inquisitor and his Elect, who "guard" the faithful from their freedom (BK 308), Ramon and his apostles, "Masters of Death" as well as "Lords of Life" (PS 308), are the self-appointed protec- tors of Mexico's conscience. Thus, Lawrence gives his hero a surname derived from the German "Raymond," meaning "protective judgment." It is this unassailable power of judgment, for Lawrence and Dostoyevsky, that makes the "act of faith" possible - not for the condemned, whose sins can only be purged through death, nor for the authorities, but for the transfixed and trembling worshippers. Although the religious murders that Ramon orders are usually per-</page><page sequence="19">LAWRENCE AND DOSTOYEVSKY 435 formed with a knife, they are made possible by the symbolic burning of Christ Himself in the form of a plaster statue.25 Transporting the glass* encased form from the Church to a pyre, Ramon enacts the execution that the Inquisitor threatens ("Tomorrow I shall burn Thee. Dixi." 309), but strangely withholds. The influence of Ivan's tale is nowhere more apparent than in Lawrence's grotesque evocation of the painted cast as Christ in the flesh. Emerging from the dark transept into sunlight, the crucified figure seems "lifelike" (282) in death. "Streaked with blood," He "enter[s] the crowd" at the city gates (282), where men and women kneel before Him, just as the worshippers of Seville bowed at the pierced feet of the returning Jesus. Yet both groups know that their sudden sense of a physically accessible Savior cannot last: they realize that He must again disappear, giving way to perpetual earthly authority. As Ramon's proces- sion stops and the "great Dead Christ" is laid upon the blazing grill, "caked wounds of paint bubbled black" and the enclosing box "emitted strange, painful yelps" (285). Repulsive as the scene is, Ramon's aim is not, as Carlota insists, to "put Christ back on the cross" (189). Rather, in burning the martyred image, he seeks to destroy men's crippling identifica* tion with an illustration of death, their "unpleasant sensuous gratification of feeling themselves victims, victimised" (276). Like the Inquisitor, his principal aim is not to punish Christ but to protect the people from the alienation, suffering, and life-denial that He represents. As the fires burn out and the crowd disperses, "Sayula was empty of [this] God, and, at heart, they were glad" (287). If Lawrence's hatred for Christ surpasses Ivan's, it is due to the crucified Son's denial of erotic life, a perversion the novelist ultimately sought to correct by reinterpreting Jesus's death in "The Man Who Died." The same erotic mystery that this mythic figure discovers is at the heart of Ramon's religion, while the Church's tortured Christ is "essentially womanless" (Phoenix 11 572). 26 In its denial of mature sexuality, the crucifix is, for Lawrence, only slightly less perverse than representations of the Christ child enthroned on the lap of "the all-pitying, all sheltering madonna" (Phoenix II 572). Along with most Mexican women, Carlota identifies intensely with this Magna Mater, regarding her husband's apostasy as infantile egotism: "I've held [him] in my arms. He is a child, as all men are children" (165). In consigning statues of the Virgin Mother to the fire, Ramon anticipates his sacrifice of Carlota as the first human victim of the auto da je. Unable to prevent her husband from renouncing their Chris- tian marriage and dedicating the gutted cathedral to Quetzalcoatl, she</page><page sequence="20">436 COMPARATIVE LITERATURE STUDIES suffers a fatal breakdown, screaming, "Ramon [has] murdered me" (346). Figuratively, he has: as Carlota collapses before the glowing altar, "her hands seemed to flicker in the air like flames of death" (343). A moment earlier, at the climax of the pagan ceremony, she had cried, "No! No! It is not permitted," and desperately invoked Jesus to intervene (343). Her cry seems an echo of Aloysha's horrified (and equally helpless) response to Ivan's story: "Everything is lawful, you mean? Everything is lawful, is that it?" (BK 312). For both Ramon and Ivan, anything done by the Enlight- ened to free humankind from the bondage of individual will is lawful. In Cipriano's words, "men who are more than men must have judgment of men that are less than men" (379). This conception of a theocratic ruling class, a "Natural Aristocracy of the World" (PS 248), mirrors Ivan's vision of a heroic "hundred thousand" who rule over "thousands of millions of happy babes" (BK 308), and it leaves no place for such "artificial" champions of democracy as Kate's late martyred husband or Montes, whose campaign posters tellingly proclaim him "el Jesucristo de Mexico" (35). Ramon knows that such "charitable" men must inevitably be eliminated and live in fear until they are, for "the knives of the Mexican people are stronger than the pinions of love" (227). In his role as Huitzilopochtli, Quetzalcoatl's living scourge, Cipri' ano insists upon the necessity of authoritarian "horror" in life: "like the sesame seed in the nougat ... it is good to have it there" (235-36). Ramon himself warns Kate that he is anything but a "gospel of peace" (187), and later proves it when, with her help, he kills two assassins. As she "glanc[es] from horror to horror" (295) during the attack on Jamil' tepee, Kate's faith in Ramon and obedience to his will are sealed less by his miraculous survival than by the drops of his blood that splash upon her during the knife fight. So anointed, she becomes initiated into a code of violence intrinsic to religious mastery. The shot from her revolver that saves Ramon's life simultaneously confirms her reverence for this "Sultan" (397) and makes possible her own apotheosis through marriage to "the red Huitzilopochtli of the knife" (360). Celebrating her participation in blood- shed, Ramon remarks, "Good that we killed them between us!" (297). Ill Lawrence's insistence throughout The Plumed Serpent that authority de- mands "horror" and ritualized brutality makes his final pronouncements</page><page sequence="21">LAWRENCE AND DOSTOYEVSKY 437 on "The Grand Inquisitor" at once more provocative and more puzzling. Early in the essay, he hastily dismisses the spiritual significance of Christ's parting kiss. Far from affirming peace or love in the face of inexplicable suffering, Jesus "gives the kiss of acquiescence to the Inquisitor, as Aloysha does to Ivan." Both are forced to recognize "the inadequacy of their inspiration" (Phoenix 283-4). Lawrence, however, neither explains why the old cardinal immediately releases his prisoner nor mentions that the lingering kiss "glows in his heart" (BK 312). Instead, he insists that the Inquisitor "speaks" Dostoyevsky's own final condemnation of Christ's insufficiency. Ivan is no longer simply a part of Dostoyevsky, nor is the Inquisitor merely Ivan's idealized alter-ego: the three form an indivisible trinity in their rebellion. Clearly, Lawrence has come full circle in his view of Dostoyevsky as a religious thinker, and he will brook neither ambiguity nor irresolution. Having finally claimed the Russian writer as a soul-mate, he seems intent on casting him in his own image.27 In The Plumed Serpent Lawrence had merely absorbed Dostoyevsky's rhetoric; five years later he absorbs most (but not all) of Ivan's philosophy. If self-projection is a characteristically Lawrentian form of praise, it is also a subtle mechanism that denies influence by blurring cause and effect. Lawrence could embrace a Dostoyevskian vision of political and religious authority over mankind, but, as a militantly independent writer, he could not submit to the artistic authority of Dostoyevsky himself. The evasive impulse expresses itself most recognizably in Lawrence's ambiva- lent closing remarks on "The Grand Inquisitor." While repeatedly endors- ing Ivan's claim that mankind "needs someone to bow down to," he regrets that Dostoyevsky's protagonist should be "so tragic and satanic," the Inquisitor so ancient and "diabolical," his methods so "bullying" and deadly (Phoenix 290). For Lawrence, the man who posed such noble questions to Jesus "could not possibly have burnt a hundred people. . . . He would have been too wise and far-seeing" (287). It was "perverse" of Dostoyevsky to "drag in Inquisitors and autos dafé" (291). Harold Bloom identifies this urge to escape enslavement in a precursor's system by mis- reading his work as "clinamen": "an act of creative correction that is actually and necessarily a misrepresentation. . . ."28 Coming years after The Plumed Serpent, however, Lawrence's willful revisionism of Dostoyev- sky amounts, ironically, to an assault upon aspects of his own earlier work. The "diabolical" that Lawrence rejects is among the elements that he most explicitly "dragged in" to his novel from The Brothers Karamazov.</page><page sequence="22">438 COMPARATIVE LITERATURE STUDIES Although Ramon is fifty years younger than the Spanish cardinal, he employs terror in the best (or worst) inquisitional style and encourages Cipriano to cultivate "his demon power" (PS 311). Lawrence is, in fact, so intent on inculcating the diabolism he later condemns in Dostoyevsky that he has Kate exalt her Aztec husband as "my demon lover" (312). In his subsequent attempt to distance himself from a maleficence that he identifies in the Inquisitor, Ivan, and Dostoyevsky alike, Lawrence also curiously ignores Ivan's confession to Alyosha of vitalist yearnings for "the sticky leaves in spring, the blue sky" (BK 274) that lie beyond the power of intellect and logic. Ivan sounds almost like a Lawrentian hero when he explains that this "loving with one's inside, with one's stomach" has sustained his life in the face of metaphysical despair. While Ivan regards this feeling as existential rather than religious, Dostoyevsky characteristic cally implies that a spiritual need inheres in all sub^rational human long* ing. Never comfortable with Ivan's divided nature, Lawrence not only overlooks his underlying sensualism but finally consigns him, with the Inquisitor, to the realm of the "diabolic" and "satanic." It is possible to read Lawrence's apparent repudiation of violence and terror in his final essay as symptomatic of a much^cited softening of vision in the years following The Plumed Serpent Writing to Aldous Huxley in 1928, he laments that "the leader^cum^follower relationship is a bore" and calls for a new social model founded upon "tenderness" and "sensitivity]" among all people.29 But this is not the political vision to which Lawrence commits himself a year later in his Grand Inquisitor essay, where he reaffirms the no longer boring prospect of "a true lord, a noble, a nature hero" (Phoenix 290). Here, the novelist merely denies that these "specially gifted few" need employ the devilish techniques of Dostoyevsky's Inquisitor. Lawrence's failure to explain how his envi* sioned leader is to maintain protective authority without Ramon's use of force calls into question the coherence and, finally, the sincerity of his claims. For all of his borrowing in The Plumed Serpent, Lawrence's debt to Dostoyevsky remains submerged in a final, urgent mixture of praise and separation. Ivan and his Inquisitor have "found the truth again" (291), but in dismissing their methods Lawrence sought to cast off not only the darkest truth of his Mexican novel but the even darker text that inspired it.

Despite her recurrent misgivings, Kate ultimately echoes this need to surrender her freedom - not merely to Ramon, but to Cipriano who, as husband, will "limit me and submerge my will" {PS 439). As the novel ends, she is reduced to begging these two high priests to compel her to stay: " 'You don't want me to go, do you?' she pleaded" (PS 444). 17. Even in her status as the divine Malintzi, Kate must accept the subservient role assigned to all women in Ramon's power structure. In this regard, Lawrence's vision of authoritarian leadership in the novel differs from the model he had proposed to Bertrand Russell in 1915, which culminated in "an absolute Dictator, and an equivalent Dictatrix . . . the women's share must be equal with the men's" (Letters 365). Far from sharing power with her male counterparts, Kate is nothing more than a figurehead in her position as fertility goddess. Her marriage ceremony requires that Cipriano kiss her brow and breast, while she kisses his feet and heels. Although she dons a symbolic green dress for this mystic union, her husband denies her the fulfillment of orgasm and even the mysterious female potency of reproduction. Ramon's adoring second wife, Teresa, explains to her that woman is born through man, who carries her soul "in his womb" (PS 412). As Kate Millett has observed, Lawrence, writing at his most misogynie pitch, wishes "to rearrange biological fact . . .</page><page sequence="24">440 COMPARATIVE LITERATURE STUDIES bypassing the [female] womb" as the generative center. See Sexual Politics (New York: Ballantine, 1969) 398. 18. Lawrence may allude to Christ's first temptation when Kate's housekeeper, Concha, insistently offers her a tortilla, the indigenous "bread" of Mexico (PS 213). As in Dostoyev- sky, this bread suggests more than merely an earthly hunger: Concha also wants the white woman to allow her family to worship her as the semi-divine Blessed Virgin. Not yet drawn by Ramon into her role as Mexican goddess, Kate, like Jesus, refuses to eat. 19. D. H. Lawrence, Sex, Literature and Censorship, ed. Harry T. Moore (New York: Viking, 1953) 99. 20. Though his intentions are more honorable, Ramon's "miracles" bear some ironic similarity to the deceptions that Montes produces to awe the peasants. Labour officials pretend to report Indian complaints to the government by telephone, which the campen- sios, in their simplicity, regard as communications with higher power. This telephone is, of course, a dead line, connected to nothing. 21. K. ]. Phillips suggests that Ramon's meritocratic "emphasis on the few," and on himself as a single human embodiment of the Redeemer, may actually work against his expressed desire to make Mexico see the Plumed Serpent as a divine principle in all mortals.

Like Dostoyevsky, who derided socialism as an atheistic pseudo-religion attempting to "set up heaven on earth" (BK 26), Lawrence objected to its absence of transcendent vision. In the Grand Inquisitor essay, Lawrence complains that the central failing of socialism lies in its mistaken belief that "all you have to do is ... to give earthly bread (good houses, good sanitation, etc. ) to the poor, and that is in itself the heavenly bread. But it isn't" (Phoenix 288). Humanity continues to long for the real "heavenly bread" that only miracle, mystery, and authority can supply. 25. Here, as elsewhere, Ramon borrows freely from European Christian practice. Com- pare his Spanish method of religious execution with the more primitive Indian sacrifice at the end of his Mexican story, "The Woman Who Rode Away," written between drafts of The Plumed Serpent. 26. By contrast, Quetzalcoatl (in the form of Ramon) takes a native wife. Moreover, while Jesus is born of woman and is dependent upon her until he becomes "womanless," the Aztec god has no mother. 27. My contention that Lawrence distorts Dostoyevsky 's authorial intentions in identify- ing him exclusively with his Inquisitor is consistent with Gary Cox's view that Lawrence presents a "deliberate misreading" in order to make the Russian writer "an advocate for his own views" (179). In noting his reversal, however, Cox fails to explore the larger implica- tions of Lawrence's simultaneous attempt to separate himself from an adversary whose perspective he has seemingly embraced as his own. 28.
