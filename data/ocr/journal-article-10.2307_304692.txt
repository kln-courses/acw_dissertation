<plain_text><page sequence="1">RUSSIAN FUTURISM, XLEBNIKOV, ESENIN By Renato Poggioli Harvard University Russian Futurism The first vague rumors about the manifestoes of Marinetti reached Russia in 1909.1 On no other ground but the association of ideas created by the suggestive echo of that new name, the first to call themselves Futurists were a handful of young poets in Petersburg led by Igor' Severja- nin and Vadim ?ergenevic. The latter was the theorist of the group and was later destined to become also the theorist of Imaginism. But the circle of the Moscow Futurists was more valid and solid, even if it became an effective center only a few years later. At first, to distinguish themselves from the Italian Futurists-upon the advice of their leader Xlebnikov, who was paradoxically a purist and an archaist in matters of language-they called themselves budetljane, a word coined on the third person of the future tense of the verb "to be" (budet), and which sounds in Russian like "those who will be," or "the men of the coming time." Lat- er, they became better acquainted with the doctrines of Marinetti, who had just made a lecture tour in Russia, but who disappointed them with the political overtones of his speeches, already inspired by a kind of bourgeois imperi- alism. This led them to feel not only independent, but also different, from the original Franco-Italian branch of the same international movement. Later on, to distinguish themselves from their Petersburg rivals, to whom they were allied for a while, so that Severjanin was one of the signers of some of their early manifestoes, they named themselves Cubo-Futurists, showing that their rift with the Marinetti group did not prevent them from following with curiosity and interest the new advance-guard movements of 3</page><page sequence="2">4 The Slavic and East European Journal the West, not only in the field of letters, but also in the field of the arts, as proved by the allusion in their new name to the Cubism of Braque, Picasso, and Apollinaire. As a matter of fact, as in the case of Italian Futurism, the Moscow group included not only men of letters but also artists, and, frequently, men of letters who were also art- ists. Almost all of the Burljuk brothers, David, Nikolaj, and Vladimir, led by David, the oldest (born in 1882), were poets and painters at the same time. Painters like Lavre- nov and Goniarova, sculptors like Lipschitz, were con- nected with the group. For a while, one of the members of the circle was a man of the theatre, Nikolaj Evreinov, who later was to become well known for his doctrine of "the theatricality of life," and as the author of a few plays antic- ipating the dramas of Pirandello. The movement had its adventurers, too, like the poet Vasilij Kamenskij, who was one of the first Russians to try to fly an airplane. But Rus- sian Futurism was not merely a meeting ground for eccen- trics: it was also a breeding ground of new talents, as shown by the presence in its ranks of two real masters, Xlebnikov and Majakovskij, and of a few minor but authentic craftsmen of the word, like the woman poet, Elena Guro, whose early death (1913) prevented her from developing her promising gifts shown in the posthumous collection of verse, Organ Grinder (Sarmanka, 1914), which is but the poetic report of her child's life and death; Naturally, the activity of the movement expressed it- self, even more than in works of art, in printed proclama- tions and in public manifestations, even in public scandals: above all, in the irregular but constant publication of a series of arbitrary and challenging anthologies, collecting the best of the minor members of the movement and often some of the most interesting pieces left by Xlebnikov, the most finished literary artist produced by early Russian Futurism. The titles of these collections are highly signif- icant of the paradoxical taste of the group: Hatchery of Judges (Sadok Sudej, I and II, 1909 and 1913); A Slap to Public Taste (PoiEeEina obgestevennomu vkusu, 1912); Three (Troe); The Roaring Parnassus (Rykaju?Eij Parnass, 1914); The Marsians' Trumpet (Truba Marsian, 1916); etc. Even a cursory reading of these anthologies shows how Rus- sian Futurism was, theoretically and technically, less su- perficial than its Italian equivalent: far more interested in</page><page sequence="3">Poggioli: Russian Futurism, Xlebnikov, Esenin 5 problems of language and style, in questions of versification and form. The elaboration of a Futurist poetics was prima- rily due to Velemir Xlebnikov, who contributed to it both brilliant insights and interesting experiments; to Aleksandr Krucnyx, born in 1886 and still living in Russia, whose contribution was more valuable in the theoretical than in the practical field; and finally, to David Burljuk, the real or- ganizer of the movement during its heroic years and its out- standing propagandist, who hardly survived as an artist after he left Russia in the early twenties to settle in New York. This theoretical interest was a peculiar trait of the ear- ly Futurist circle, so well represented by the figure of its leader, Velemir Xlebnikov; while the new group, more po- litical and practical, found its standard-bearer in Maja- kovskij, followed by a host of young poets, the best known of whom is Nikolaj Aseev, who had been also the last to join the Moscow Futurists. Majakovskij himself had foreseen such a metamorphosis of Russian Futurism from the very beginning of the First World War, in the article "A Drop of Tar" (Kaplja degtja), published in the collection Vzjal (1915), the title of which is the third person of the past tense of the Russian verb meaning "to clutch" or "to grasp." That piece contained a double foreboding, announc- ing the imminent and parallel triumph of the Revolution and of Futurism, and prophesying that the latter would soon "clutch Russia in its grasp." After the war and the Revolu- tion, Majakovskij was destined to lead the Neo-Futurists to their early and uncertain victories, gained through the cam- paigns he waged as editor-in-chief of the periodical The Left Front of the Arts (Lef, an abbreviation of Levy front isskustv, 1923-28), and through which he hoped to obtain for his movement a kind of cultural monopoly from the So- viet regime. At the same time, Majakovskij helped to make the movement more normal and more popular, succeeded for a while in keeping it in a state of uneasy balance between the taste of the public and the demands of the party line; did his best to defend his own brand of Futurism from the at- tacks against it from the opposite quarters of the cultural Right and the political Left. When he began to lose his con- trol over the movement, he founded The New Lev (Novy lef, 1927-28), which he described as being "to the left of Lef"; but finally, shortly before his death, confronted with the</page><page sequence="4">6 The Slavic and East European Journal hard facts of Soviet reality, he was practically forced to dis- solve the movement to which he had given the best years of his life. It is only for the single poetic achievement of Maja- kovskij, and for the psychic bond that existed for a while be- tween his inspiration and the new state of mind, enthusiastic and heroic, which dominated Russian youth during the early phase of the Revolution, that the second period of Russian Futurism is more important than the first. But as seekers after new forms and techniques, as pioneers in yet unex- plored esthetic fields, thanks to Xlebnikov's searching and tireless quest, the Futurists of the Old Guard left a far deeper imprint in the soil of Russian letters. Yet the two generations of Russian Futurism differed equally from the Italian Futurists by being more aggressive toward the liter- ary situation of the present than toward the national tradi- tion itself; while, on the other hand, their exaltation of modern life was less subordinated than that of their Western rivals to what the latter called "the esthetics of the ma- chine." In the Russian case, the glorification of the values of our modern mechanical civilization came only later, with Majakovskij and his group, and in connection with the Com- munist idolatry of technology and industrialization. According to the letter of their statements, and some- times even according to the spirit of their acts, the Russian Futurists, who from their very beginnings had been sympa- thetic to the ideal of a social revolution and who had never been dominated by an egotistical and tyrannical leader like Marinetti, were less individualistic than their Italian col- leagues, and acted with more consistency and discipline as a group. They steadfastly opposed any decadent culte du moi, stating in the very first of their manifestoes that they would " stand fast on the rock of the word 'we' amidst an ocean of hisses and indignation." As a matter of fact this distrust of any form of self-idolatry by the artist was per- haps the most important of the many differences which led them to sever their ties with the poets of the Petersburg circle, who had significantly labelled themselves Ego-Fu- turists. The Ego-Futurists were interested only in disguising old feelings and moods under new dresses or masks, but the Cubo-Futurists were really interested in creating new forms. While the posthumous example of Mallarm6's Coup</page><page sequence="5">Poggioli: Russian Futurism, Xlebnikov, Esenin 7 de D4s had suggested to Marinetti the doctrine, which re- mained little more than a slogan, of mots en libertg, the Russian Futurists developed, instead, from some of the ideas and the works of one of the extreme representatives of Russian Symbolism, Andrej Belyj, the theory and prac- tice of a complete metamorphosis of poetic language, and tried to enact a radical revolution of the word. In this at- tempt they went further than any other offshoot directly de- rived from Futurism, and anticipated experiments later performed by the Dadaists. They failed in their search, yet they had the merit of pushing it to its extreme conse- quences, without being satisfied with the wishful or boastful proclamations of unrealized programs. After all, Marinetti's doctrine of mots en libert6, while proclaiming the dissolution of all syntactical ties, had mere- ly achieved the abolition of punctuation, and had done little more than develop minor and purely external or material effects, like onomatopoeia and typographical relief. The left wing of Russian Futurism--in brief, the Cubo-Futurists -aimed instead at creating a new kind of poetry, based on a language invented anew, consciously constructed for this very purpose. Their intent was to transcend the traditional and conventional meaning of each word; nay, to devise words morphologically new, and therefore devoid of any pre-established connotation. The language thus created took the name of "transmental tongue" (zaumnyj jazyk). Krucanyx once stated the theory of "transmental"'poetry with the following words: "Before us no art of the word ev- er existed. Up to now it has been maintained that it is poet- ry that rules the word, rather than contrariwise. We have bared this mistake.... A word is wider than its meaning.... Each letter, each sound, has its relevance.... Why not re- nounce ideas, why not write with idea-words, with words freely made ?... There is no need for such intermediaries as symbol and thought, and we prefer uttering our truth anew . . . " Xlebnikov's method was more original and complex, and his poetic experiments cannot be reduced merely to ar- bitrary exercises in the medium of the "transmental tongue." We can therefore safely assert that the only poet of some reputation among the few using the new medium was Kruinyx. His "transmental" poems are generally made of newly coined monosyllabic words, joined together</page><page sequence="6">8 The Slavic and East European Journal in series or lines based on the associative power of phonetic suggestions or of etymological allusions; the content, if any, of these poems is betrayed, or hinted at, only by their titles. These pieces are among the very few poems of early Futur- ism belonging to the metrical experiment of vers libre; moreover, they are unrhymed, while a casual and unconven- tional kind of rhyme will reappear in Majakovskij's free verse. Except for this formal aspect, and against the best intention of its authors, Russian "transmental" poetry ends, however, by achieving effects similar to those produced by nonsense verse. This does not mean that Krucanyx's at- tempts, or that the less literal performances of Xlebnikov, are devoid of value or interest. Despite the strong polemical attitude which Futurism took against Symbolism, it is evident that "transmental" poetry is directly related to some extreme Symbolistic trends, and similar in nature to some of the experiments which were undertaken at the end of his life by such a West- ern master as Mallarm6. Both the suggestive verbalism of the Symbolists and the sensuous verbalism of the Decadents, with their emphatic cult of a musical language, were bound to open the way to developments in the directions mentioned above. Furthermore, some of Krucnyx's ideas seem to anticipate even the doctrines of the Surrealists, who, in spite of their protest to the contrary, are but the children or grandchildren of the Symbolists. KruUanyx anticipated, for instance, the very hypotheses on which the Surrealists based their conceptions of "oneiric poetry" and of "auto- matic poetry" and of "automatic writing," as the following statement may easily show: "Psychic motions and changes of mood may originate strange combinations of letters and words, devoid of any articulate meaning." Xlebnikov It would be impossible to find a greater contrast, in tone and in quality, than the one dividing the poetry of Se- verjanin from the poetry of Xlebnikov. We may go even further, and we can safely assert that the leader of Cubo- Futurism had little in common not only with the vulgar mod- ernism of Severjanin, but with Futurism itself, as it was understood in Italy by Marinetti, and even in Russia by Ma- jakovskij. Yet along with Majakovskij, and even before him,</page><page sequence="7">Poggioli: Russian Futurism, Xlebnikov, Esenin 9 Xlebnikov was the most important figure which Russian Fu- turism produced. As for Majakovskij, he acknowledged more than once the merits of Xlebnikov. Immediately after Xlebnikov's death, Majakovskij described him as "the most magnificent and blameless knight in our poetic struggle ... the Columbus of new poetic continents," and later paid many other similar tributes to the memory of that master. Even writers of very different literary and political tastes quali- fied their critical reservations with an unbounded admira- tion for the originality and integrity of the work of Xlebnikov. "Several of his lines," said the Neo-Parnassian and counter- revolutionary Nikolaj Gumilev, "seem like the fragments of an unwritten epic." Yet Xlebnikov is practically forgotten in Russia and still unknown in the West. Viktor Vladimirovich Xlebnikov, who chose as nom de plume the Russian and pagan name of Velemir, was born in 1885, in a little town of the province of Astrakhan. He spent his youth in Simbirsk, and studied at the University of Kazan. When he was twenty-three, he went to Peters- burg, and began writing his first poems, under the influence of the Symbolists and other older poets of that time. It is quite significant that he was affected especially by the "By- zantinism" of VjaZeslav Ivanov and the "mythologism" of Sergej Gorodetskij. Later he settled in Moscow, where, to- gether with the Burljuk brothers, Majakovskij, and Kruc'nyx, he founded the Futurist movement in Russia. He contributed to all manifestoes, and helped to edit all the pub- lications of the movement. He collaborated with Krucanyx in framing the doctrine of the "transmental language," of a poetry to be written only in newly coined and meaningless words. Drafted into the army during the First World War, he deserted after the Revolution, and the civil war caught him in Kharkov. There he met Aseev and published with him the almanac The Marsians' Trumpet. He became a member of the Communist Party, and served the new regime in the Ukraine, in the Caucasus, and in Iran. He saw in the Rev- olution a messianic Utopia, and it is doubtful whether he would have remained a faithful follower of the party line and the Stalinist order. He died suddenly in the summer of 1922, in a provincial hospital. He left an important, but uneven, body of work, scattered in pamphlets, leaflets, periodicals, and anthologies, which remained practically</page><page sequence="8">10 The Slavic and East European Journal inaccessible for about twenty years: a neglect partly due to the official mistrust for experimental art and advance-guard poetry. The most important titles published in his lifetime are Creations (Tvorenija) and Golden Book (Izbornik), both of 1914; Night in a Trench (Noc' v okope) and Zangezi, of 1921 and 1922. In spite of its label, the poetry of Xlebnikov is not Fu- turistic in the literal sense of the word. This is equally true from the standpoint of ideas and feelings, as well as from the standpoint of form and technique. Xlebnikov looked at modern life with a sense of aversion; he worked hard at his experiments and research, while the other Fu- turists were often satisfied with announcing the most radi- cal innovations in resounding manifestoes, or in rhetorical proclamations. Xlebnikov's indifference toward modern themes, toward the most attractive or repulsive aspects of contemporary existence, is proved by contrast by his deep interest in Slavic mythological lore, which inspired several of his poems; or more generally, by his longing for all those forms of primordial or ancestral life which are the field of study of the archeologist and the anthropologist. In Xlebnikov's work there breathes a kind of pantheistic inspiration la Walt Whitman, but his is an escape panthe- ism, out of tune with the present, going backward into the past, and trying to find the regained paradise of primitive innocence in the darkness of prehistory. Also from this viewpoint his poetry has little to do with the movement to which he gave his allegiance. One could say that Futurism was in Russia the last and most extreme literary manifesta- tion of the Westernizing tendency, while in the West it was nothing else but an unconscious variation of the Nineteenth Century idea of progress, from which it derived the myth symbolized by the very term "Futurism." But Xlebnikov is perhaps one of the most consistent Slavophiles in the histo- ry of Russian poetry: he even anticipates the reactionary ideology, built after the Revolution by a group of emigre historians and geographers, on the belief that Russia and Siberia are an ethnographical and geopolitical unit, forming the sixth continent of Eurasia. Xlebnikov's Utopia is regres- sive and retrospective: it repudiates our own steel or iron age for a mythical age of gold, even for a stone or wooden age. Xlebnikov's sentiment and imagination constantly turn</page><page sequence="9">Poggioli: Russian Futurism, Xlebnikov, Esenin 11 back toward the time when the forests and plains of Europe- an and Asiatic Russia were still inhabited by the spirits of the trees and the waters. Such a nostalgia is expressed by a poem entitled "The Shaman and Venus" ( aman i Venera), which combines barbaric and classical mythology, and where the goddess of love offers herself not to a hero or demigod, but to a Mongol, to a Siberian sorcerer. And Xlebnikov's repudiation of modern life is tragically stated in the poem "The Crane" (2uravlej), where the machines created and enslaved by man rebel against him, as a trai- tor to nature and to himself. It would be wrong to interpret too literally the numer- ous poems which Xlebnikov devoted to historical subjects; their themes are never ends in themselves, but rather me- dia through which the poet turns our attention toward what is archaic and prehistoric in life and man. Such an effect is generally contrived by employing anachronisms, because, as we read in one of the poet's tales, "there are no barri- ers within time ... consciousness joins together the differ- ent ages .. ." These violations of chronology, this conver- sion into new values of the category of time, are applied by Xlebnikov not only to the collective experience of mankind, but to the individual himself. Thus, in the story "The World Upside Down" (Mir izkonca), the biography of the protagonist is reversed, and the author accompanies him from his grave to his cradle. As shown by the judgment of Gumil8v, quoted above, the anonymous, almost choral solemnity of Xlebnikov's po- etry has led a few critics to assert the epical character of his inspiration. But in the poet's imagination the mythical element is stronger than the heroic one: his conception of nature as in a state of permanent chaos, as a continuation of the first day of creation, as an everlasting conflict be- tween the human and the cosmic, between creatures that are like things and things that are like creatures, suggests, rather than the epical, the theogonic character of his in- spiration. This can be easily recognized also in the poems which Xlebnikov wrote under the impact of the War and the Revolution. Except for a few pieces dictated in the spirit of the future "Left Marches" of Majakovskij, all these poems look at those two historical events as if they were cosmical catastrophes, elementary cataclysms. The military and revolutionary struggle is seen as a new Titanomachy, as a</page><page sequence="10">12 The Slavic and East European Journal conflict between upper and nether gods, as the eternal war- fare between the animistic forces of the universe. History, again, is reduced to prehistory; war, to a telluric outburst; the Revolution, to a metamorphosis. The tragical breath of the gods of destruction and death transforms the cosmos in- to chaos, and earth into a Gehenna. Sometimes Xlebnikov seems to conceive of revolution as a palingenesis or rebirth, as in the poem "Liberty for All" (Svoboda dlja vsex); but even here, significantly enough, he asks for the resurrection of the natural deities of the primitive mythology of the Slavs. In "Death Feast" (Trizna), he describes the burning of the corpses on a modern battle- field as if it were an ancient ritual, an archaic funeral pyre, while the uncontrolled forces of nature, symbolized by two great Russian rivers, are considered as more powerful than that fire which man has learned to use and to control. Thus in Xlebnikov's poetry the fragile order of man is for- ever upset by the revolt of the elements. This can be seen in the beautiful passage of a poem describing a fusillade in the dark streets of a city, in the autumn or early winter of 1917. We do not see the people who are killing, but only those who are being killed, and we hear only the voice of the guns. The shots themselves, rather than being a man- made curse, are a wind of fire, a rain of lead. The bullets are like cruel spirits generated by the obscure recesses of the material world. Human beings are either their blind victims or their blind instruments, never their conscious agents. The very act of slaughter is described as the cut- ting down of a poplar tree's branches and trunk. Nothing is more significant than this identification of war and murder with the falling of leaves, with the felling of a tree: in brief, with autumn and winter. Here Xlebni- kov shows once more his tendency to translate the events of human history into the phenomena of natural history, to in- terchange epochs and seasons, to introduce within the mi- crocosm the laws and proportions of the macrocosm. The same tendencies, and the methods mentioned above, the same processes of indifferentiation and anachronism, the same attempt to establish metaphysical and metahistorical categories, are to be found also in his linguistic revolution, in his verbal reform. In this too, he remains independent from the mainstream of the literary movement to which he belongs. While the average Futurist starts from the</page><page sequence="11">Poggioli: Russian Futurism, Xlebnikov, Esenin 13 traditional vocabulary to create his own paradoxical words, and from conventional grammar to his final denial of syn- tactic structure, Xlebnikov looks in the storehouse of popu- lar and national speech in order to find ancient and eternal roots, and to rebuild a new tongue on the ideal chain of pure forms and perfect words. The neologisms and barbarisms so frequent in normal Futurist idiom are replaced in this poet's work by archaisms and Slavisms, and his writing seems to be the literal execution of the poet's task as de- fined by Mallarm6: donner un sens plus pur aux mots de la tribu. As a philologist, Xlebnikov is especially interested in the archaic stage of the linguistic evolution. It is there that he tries to find the embryo or the shell, the secret of the genesis of language, or even of creation itself, since "in the beginning was the Word." He states his purpose in the following terms: "Without breaking the links of the roots, to find the philosopher's stone of the reciprocal interchange of all Slavic words, freely dissolving them into each other: such is my conception of the word. The Word per se, out- side of life, and beyond its vital uses." This ideal of the poetic word as an entity completely divorced from history and culture, this reversal of the idea of language as a token conventionally accepted and exchanged by man, are concep- tions that may be found also in Mallarm6, although it is quite probable that Xlebnikov was unaware of the relation- ship. The poet tried to put into practice the notions of the theorist, and made several experiments in that direction. Such is the case with a poem like "Curse by Laughter" (Zakljatie smexom), which attempts to achieve a kind of lyr- ical catharsis of an etymological unit. In this poem, where one does not find even one of the forms of the verb "to be," all words are without exception derived from the Russian and Slavic root meaning "to laugh." This root is used in all its existing forms or possible variants: nouns and verbs, adjectives and adverbs, cases and aspects, tenses and moods, derivatives and compounds; and also in new words convincingly invented by the poet with the aid of several pre- fixes and suffixes. Because of this reduction of the poem to only one word-idea, the experiment from the linguistic standpoint has an exclusively phonetic and morphological character. As a work of art, it aims successfully at</page><page sequence="12">14 The Slavic and East European Journal achieving a poetic equivalent of that kind of musical com- position called "theme with variations." These linguistic and experimental interests relate Xlebnikov's work to the critical theories of the Formalist school. But the poet, besides being a born philologist, was also an arbitrary and mystical one, as it has been the case with some of the Symbolists. He was obsessed by the an- cient myth of the universal tongue, of an adamic or edenic language, which he dreamed of reaching again through methods reminiscent of those employed by the French Ren6 Ghil. Valerij Brjusov had been the only one in Russia to pay some attention to Rene Ghil and his "scientific poetry," which, rather than scientific, was cabalistic. Belyj had moved in the same direction, bringing to extreme mystical consequence, in his Glossolalija, the symbolistic doctrine of the " syncretism of the arts." Xlebnikov stated his posi- tion with the following words, in the text already quoted above: "After having realized that the roots are but ghosts hiding the alphabet's strings, to find the universal identity of all tongues: this is my second conception of the word." It is evident that by letters of the alphabet Xlebnikov mreant not only the sounds, but also the signs representing them; like Belyj, he wanted not only to speak or sing, but also "to paint with words." This led him to experimenting not only with merely verbal, but also with non-verbal signs: his research in the field of general symbolism is a poetic anticipation of modern semantics. His early verbal exer- cises had been a clever manipulation of the doctrine of the "transmental language," as shown by the predominance of onomatopoeic effects. But while we have been led to com- pare the compositions of other "transmental" poets to a kind of nonsense verse, we must say that these experiments by Xlebnikov are charged, even overcharged, with meanings of every sort, not merely verbal, but graphic, and ideo- graphic, too. They are dominated by a system of allusions, where there appear also, like hieroglyphics, historical ref- erences, and iconic symbols. Yet, even these are reduced to the common denominator of linguistic structure, playing at the same time the roles of grammatical functions, as well as of myths. Thus, in the poem without title, beginning with the line "Villa by night. Genghis Khan!" (Usad'ba noch'ju. din- gisxan! ), a series of proper names belonging to the cultural</page><page sequence="13">Poggioli: Russian Futurism, Xlebnikov, Esenin 15 or historical tradition are used as appositions or attributes describing or qualifying some aspects or elements of a landscape. This is why they are not capitalized. If, for in- stance, the "villa by night" is genghis khan, the nocturne itself is zarathustra, and the dark-blue sky, mozart. The strangeness and arbitrariness of these methods may be equally approved or reproved, and their importance may be too easily overrated. But we must not stop at the technical details per se. What counts is that by means of a given de- vice the poet has shown us an insight into a world of his own, where human reality and historical events become qualities of things, where life and history are lowered, or raised, to the condition of nature itself. It is for visions of this kind, not only for his daring use of language, that the poet Xlebnikov, far more than Andrej Belyj, whose novels have been so often compared to Ulysses, reminds us of Joyce and of his creation, especially of Finnegans Wake. Esenin Unlike Majakovskij, whose destiny it was to become the poet of history and of "October," Sergej Esenin re- mained forever the poet of nature and of the decaying sea- son, as if fated by his own family name, derived from a Slavic root meaning "autumn." Yet for a while he, too, wanted to be, like Majakovskij, the poet of the new era. But the man who in Inonija defined himself as "the prophet Sergej Esenin," projected into the image of the Revolution hopes and fears undreamed of by his rival. Majakovskij had learned his craft from early Futurism, which we have already described as the most extreme manifestation of the Westernizing tendency in Russian literature; and his politi- cal ideology derived from the workers' movement and Marxism. This orientation, as well as his temperament, had made of him an urban poet, the singer of the metropo- lis, the glorifier of city life. Esenin, instead, had begun his literary career as a pupil of the peasant poet Nikolaj Kljuev. He easily surpassed, in artistry as well as in in- spiration, the modest achievements of his master; yet he constantly hesitated between the contrasting attractions of the modernistic trends and of the traditions of folk poetry. At the end of his career he felt that he had failed to recon- cile within himself the old and the new, as shown by his</page><page sequence="14">16 The Slavic and East European Journal famous complaint: "I am the last peasant poet: crude is the wooden bridge of my songs." So, while Majakovskij accepted, almost beyond his will, the task of singing the "edification of Socialism," Esenin remained always the poet of "wooden and vegetable Russia." Politically, he had always felt closer to the Social-Revolu- tionary Party, an offshoot of the Populist movement, which interpreted in radical terms the messianic view of an agrar- ian Russia, thus acting as an unconscious Slavophilism of the Left. While the Marxists exalted the working class, the Social-Revolutionaries idolized the peasantry, in which they saw the whole of Russia. Besides being affected by this political ideology, Esenin had been subjected from his childhood to the eschatological mysticism still alive in the countryside among the sectarian groups which had left the mother Church at the time of the great Dissent. It was this combination of doctrines and beliefs that led the poet to see at first in the Revolution both a new Zion and a mod- ern Arcadia, bringing Christian peace, pastoral happiness, and utopian justice to the men of good will, who were the toilers of the earth. To be exact, except for the accident of his birth, Esenin never belonged to the tillers of the soil. Yet, in a moral sense, he remained until his death a child of the Rus- sian countryside. He was born in 1895 in the village of Konstantinovo, in the province of Ryazan. The father and mother of the future poet had gone to work in Moscow, and the boy was raised by his maternal grandparents, who were prosperous farmers, and who instilled in him a love for the old faith and the simple legends of the Russian people. He started studying to become a country teacher, but while at school, through the reading of Pugkin, the mysterious mag- ic of poetry was revealed to him. He joined his father in Moscow, where, among other jobs, he worked in a book- shop and at a printing press, dreaming of a literary career, and writing his first poems. In 1924, he settled in Petro- grad, where he became a proteg4 of Sergej Gorodetskij, a rather artificial poet who had found his Muse in the mythol- ogy of pagan Russia. There he also met Kljuev, with whom he led for a while a group of poets of peasant origins. In 1916 he published his first collection of poems, to which he gave, as to many other of his books and works, a title so</page><page sequence="15">Poggioli: Russian Futurism, Xlebnikov, Esenin 17 peculiarly Slavonic as to be practically untranslatable: Radunica. Shortly after, he was drafted into the army, but served in the Russian Versailles, the "Imperial Village" of Tsarskoe Selo, celebrated by the early Pugkin. By then his name was already well known; it is reported that he was once invited to read his poems to the Empress, although it seems that he declined the invitation. At that time he fell under the influence of the radical critic, R. I. Ivanov- Razumnik, a Social-Revolutionary with Bolshevik sympa- thies, who was shaping a mystical and apocalyptic doctrine about the destiny of the Russian people, under the name of "Scythianism." It was perhaps because of his Leftist lean- ings that in 1917 the poet was sent to the front, where he was surprised by the Revolution. Like millions of other Russian soldiers, he deserted and returned home, settling later in Petrograd, where he married Zinaida Ri6, and published the poems he had written under the spell of Ivanov- Razumnik's "Scythianism, " Inonija (1918) and Transfigura- tion (Preobra'enie, 1919.) Later on, in Moscow, he tried to show his independ- ence not only from Kljuev, but also from even the brightest stars of the Russian poetic firmament, such as Blok and Majakovskij, by founding, along with other younger writers, the movement called Imaginism. It was then and there that he started his vie de boheme, leading a life of orgies and scandals. Once, with other members of his group, Esenin spent a night in jail: the poet and his companions had been arrested while painting their names on the signposts of the main thoroughfares of the capital. The psychological ex- periences of those years were to be forcefully conveyed in the poems of A Hooligan's Confession (Ispoved' xuligana), published in 1921 (the title piece had already appeared in 1918); and in the cycle entitled Moscow of the Taverns (Ka- batskaja Moskva, 1922). The experimental techniques of Imaginism found peculiar expression in the lyrics of Tre- rjadnica and in the dramatic poem Pugae*v (1921). It was in 1921 that Sergej Esenin first met the famous American classical dancer, Isadora Duncan, who by then had already reached middle age. They became lovers, and married in 1922. Unable to speak each other's tongue, they found a common experience in high living and heavy</page><page sequence="16">18 The Slavic and East European Journal drinking. Impoverished by her lavish style of living, Isa- dora Duncan decided to make a tournee abroad, and Sergej accompanied her in a long journey through Western Europe and the United States. It was a shabby odyssey, full of mis- adventures and failures. Esenin felt cruelly disappointed in the West and drowned his despair in alcohol. When he returned to Russia, his mental and physical health was fa- tally impaired. He broke with Miss Duncan, and married in 1925 a descendant of Lev Tolstoj; she nursed him, and after his death became the custodian of his literary herit- age, and the vestal of his memory. Fearing that his crea- tive powers were forever gone, on December 27, 1925, he hanged himself in a Leningrad hotel room. The night be- fore, since there was no ink in his desk, he slightly cut a vein in his wrist, and wrote with his blood a brief farewell poem, ending with the famous lines: "to die is not new, but to live is not newer." Majakovskij answered these lines with a poem condemning Esenin's act, not knowing that with- in five years he would come to the same willful end. In the poetry of Esenin there is at least a minor vein which is not too different from certain aspects of Majakov- skij's work. This is the apocalyptic strain, which appears in Transfiguration and Inonija (the latter is a word coined by the poet, meaning "Other-Land"). In both pieces the poet condemns the dying old world, while exalting the Revolution as a kind of cosmic rebirth. Here Esenin's verse, like Ma- jakovskij's, overflows with "hyperbolic" and "iconoclastic" images which in this case derive however from a morbid and perverted mysticism, often turning into heresy and blasphemy, into a parody of Christian hopes, myths, and beliefs. In these two poems Esenin becomes the secular apostle of a new Gospel, the announcer of a new earthly kingdom, the seer of the Revolution as the earthly paradise of the peasant and the shepherd. These two pieces greatly differ from the long poems of the later years, predominant- ly autobiographical in character, and expressing the disap- pointment of the poet with the Revolution, as well as the complaint of a peasant's son uprooted from the countryside, living as an outcast in the alien world of the city. Both the early revolutionary pieces, which are the weakest part of his work, and the later autobiographical poems may all too often seem to a foreign reader the most important fruits of this poet's talent. Certainly, nobody</page><page sequence="17">Poggioli: Russian Futurism, Xlebnikov, Esenin 19 can deny their significance as human and social documents. Yet the most genuine of Esenin's masterpieces are to be found among his shortest and less ambitious lyrics, written in the pure and simple modes of the elegy and the idyll, de- void of any rhetorical and anecdotical structure, and lightly woven as a cobweb of transparent words around the cluster of a few bright and striking images. Each one of these songs may be reduced to a landscape and to the mood it evokes within the soul of the poet. Although the narrative element is lacking, or hardly present, the poems partake of the magic aura of the legend and the fairy tale. They re- create a private and intimate universe, domestic and rus- tic, where all things are humanized by a naive animism, by a pathetic anthropomorphism. The ingenuousness of Esenin's vision is evident in the central image of each one of such poems, defining its object by a kind of childish puz- zle that follows or accompanies its name. It is from the same simplicity of outlook that Esenin derives his gusto for the colorful, the vivid, the pictur- esque. His favorite color is the color of the sky, in all its shades, and he loves it so much as to attribute it to his na- tive land, to his "blue Russia." But his poems are equally full of white and yellow patches, so enameled as to give the effect of gold and silver, and to remind us of icon and min- iature painting, of Byzantine mosaics and of popular prints or cuts. This chromatism is not merely a decorative, but rather a compositional element, and intensifies the styliza- tion of the poet's vision, so evident in the stillness of the landscapes, with their motionless figures and timeless moods. But almost always this stillness is broken by a sudden burst of song, by a hidden stream of music, chang- ing the stasis into ecstasy, and flooding the entire scene with a melodic grief which makes a vibrant chord of every fiber. This feeling of cosmic pain is suggested through a con- tinuous parallelism, through a continuous identification be- tween men, beasts, plants, and stars. For Esenin there is no difference between our tears, and the tears of all oth- er creatures, and even of things. Since only the humble may be exalted, the poet celebrates even the heavenly crea- ture he loves most, the moon, through a series of animal metamorphoses: by converting it, metaphorically, now in- to a bear, now into a frog. In the same spirit, when</page><page sequence="18">20 The Slavic and East European Journal wishing to express his own sorrow at the passing of time, he changes himself into an old maple; or when wishing to declare his love for a girl, he addresses instead a young birch. It is the beasts that play a central role in the poet's be- lief that there exists a universal, brotherly and mystical bond, joining together the human and the non-human, the animal and vegetable kingdoms, the organic and inorganic worlds. Animals are for Esenin the most human and hu- mane of all the creatures of God. Thus, in one of the most beautiful and moving poems of his later years, he projects the horror of the Revolution through the vision of animal, rather than human, slaughter: through the ordeal of starva- tion and famine, when human beings are forced to kill their domestic animals, and to eat of their flesh. Such a poem is Mare Ships, in which the tragedy of Revolution is re- duced to the tragedy of hunger, symbolized by carrion aban- doned in a city street. As the poet of wooden Russia, Esenin also protested against the invasion of the Russian countryside by the tech- nological monsters of modern civilization: by the telegraph poles and the electric cables, the steam engines and steel derricks later demanded by the Five-Year Plans. This theme is fully developed in Requiem, especially in its final scene, describing a foolish colt that vainly challenges to a race the train crossing the Russian plains as a ghostly and awful "iron guest." The two themes of the animal's sacri- fice and of the countryside's martyrdom dominate the poetry of the late Esenin, in which they merge with a more individu- al note, with the poet's lament about his plight as a man and an artist. The poet's plaint about his own crisis, and the foreboding of his own ruin, reflect in personal terms the cruel destiny of any uprooted villager, living as an exile in the foreign and harsh world of the city. The peasant's son had become a successful writer, even a public figure; yet he remained forever obsessed by a sense of failure and guilt. The disease of modern life had tainted his body and his soul, and there was nothing that could cure him. Esenin conveyed this feeling of alienation and corruption in Soviet Russia, a poem describing a visit to his native village; he vented his indignation against a way of life he could neither reject nor accept, by acting, in both imagination and reality, as the bohemian and a hooligan, as an eccentric and an outcast.</page><page sequence="19">Poggioli: Russian Futurism, Xlebnikov, Esenin 21 As we know, he also sought escape in the artificial par- adise of alcohol, into the hell of "firewater": and this is the main motif of Moscow of the Taverns. Yet the only way out he could find was self-inflicted death, and the double misery of his brief existence and of his violent end proves the truth of his statement that "the poet came on earth to understand everything, but to take nothing." The lesson we may learn from his fate, as from the fate of Majakovskij, is that in no country is the advance-guard artist so threat- ened with extinction, as in the land that claims to play on the stage of history the role of mankind's advance-guard. That death of art which Hegel once prophesied is now taking place not within the borders of bourgeois culture, but be- yond them. Note 1.
