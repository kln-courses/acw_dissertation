<plain_text><page sequence="1">VOLUME XLVIII, No. 11 MAY 24, 1951 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY THE PHYSICOMORPHIC CONCEPTION OF MAN' T HE terms "anthropomorphic" and "anthropomorphism" are accepted in scientific and everyday language. They even have a certain aura of emotionalism about them. If I tell you that your conception of causality is anthropomorphic you feel hurt. I have not only stated that your concept of causality in some sense arose out of human self-experience; I have also expressed op- probrium: your conception is primitive. I imply that it should not be anthropomorphic. The terms "physicomorphic" and "physicomorphism" are ac- cepted neither in scientific nor in everyday language. As a matter of fact, the mere attempt to introduce them will elicit raised eye- brows. A concept may be physical or physicalistic, but to call it physicomorphic would introduce some vague connotation of dis- approval. And who but some old fogey whose mind still belongs to the pre-scientific era could disapprove of a concept being physi- cal or physicalistic! Here, then, is an old fogey who believes that (1) the terms "anthropomorphic" and "anthropomorphism" have their exact parallel in the terms "physicomorphic" and "physicomorphism," with or without opprobrium; (2) anthropomorphism has as sound a function to fulfill in understanding the universe as physico- morphism has in knowing it; and (3) an undisciplined growth of the one is just as dangerous to man as that of the other. It is with the first and especially with the last point that this paper is con- cerned.2 Physicomorphism, I shall try to show, has implications of a moral or existential nature, and the danger consists precisely in these implications remaining hidden. I In defining the term " anthropomorphic, " I shall naturally focus on what we mean when we call a concept anthropomorphic. 1 A flrst version of this article was read, under the title "Physicomorphism and Anthropomorphism," at the meeting of the Western Division of the Ameri- can Philosophical Association, University of Minnesota, May 5, 1950. 2 For the second point cf. my paper on "IKnowledge and Understanding," Philosophy and Phenomenological Research, to be published soon. 345</page><page sequence="2">346 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY A concept is anthropomorphic, we shall say, if it refers to non- human beings in terms whose meaning is identical with, analogical to, or derived from that of terms whose proper and original sphere of reference is man's experience of himself and other men, in short, human self-experience. For the purposes of this paper, we shall use the term "anthropomorphic" in a more restricted sense. It will denote for us all those concepts referring to physical events that are derived through a process of subtractive substitution from concepts originally referring to human self-experience. The con- cept of causality as necessary connection can serve as an instance of anthropomorphism. It is derived from man's experience of him- self as producing effects by subtracting the idea that the effect has been produced by the cause and substituting for "production" merely "a necessary and real connection." This concept is, then, anthropomorphic or, as we can also say, an anthropomorphism. However, "anthropomorphism" has still another meaning, one somewhat different from that of simply being the noun of "anthro- pomorphic." It could, namely, designate a philosophical position according to which concepts should be anthropomorphic. This will become clearer, I hope, after we have explained what the terms "physicomorphic" and "physicomorphism" mean. Concepts of human self-experience such as pain, pleasure, are said to be reducible to, or translatable into, terms referring to physical events. These latter terms whose sphere of reference is physical events become physicomorphic when they are used with reference to human self-experiences. Hence, a concept is physico- morphic if it refers to human self-experiences in terms whose origi- nal sphere of reference is physical events. Thus it is physico- morphic or a physicomorphism to say that the statement "a bio- chemical event of a certain kind occurs at a certain time at a cer- tain place " means " I have a toothache. " "Physicomorphism," besides being simply the noun of "physi- comorphic, " may, however, have a more radical meaning. It could be applied to a philosophical position according to which concepts referring to human self-experiences should be reduced to, or translated into, terms referring to physical events. This is a perfectly plausible and acceptable position, if we add the limita- tion "for purposes of scientific research." Such a position could perhaps better be called "physicomorphistic" than "physico- morphic"; but the corresponding noun "physicomorphicism" is so awkward that it may be preferable to use "physicomorphism" in both ways, first as noun of "physicomorphic" and, secondly, as noun of "physicomorphistic."</page><page sequence="3">THIE PHYSICOMORPHIC CONCEPTION OF MAN 347 Here, again, the parallel with "anthropomorphism" is obvious. As mentioned above, "anthropomorphism" may not only mean the noun of "anthropomorphic," it may also mean a philosophical position according to which concepts should be anthropomorphic. And I do not hesitate to say that this position seems to me quite plausible and acceptable if we add a limiting clause: "for purposes of 'understanding.' "3 The history of man's physical conceptions is the story of their de-anthropomorphization. If there are any anthropomorphic con- ceptions left in the language of physics, they are only distant derivatives from the original conceptions that referred to human events. On the other hand, physicomorphism is relatively young and therefore radical. The process of de-physicomorphization has hardly begun yet. After two thousand years of watering down the naive and complete anthropomorphism with which human understanding of the universe began, we are now at the other ex- treme of a less naive, but equally complete, physicomorphism of scientific knowledge of the universe. Physicomorphism is ex- pressed most radically in the claim that propositions referring to "mental" events are reducible to propositions referring to physical events. There are, however, numerous indications of a less radi- cal position which, without giving up its basic claim, believes itself to be able to make allowances for certain differences. This, in our opinion, is the beginning of a healthy process of de-physicomorphi- zation. A notable instance of such incipient de-physicomorphiza- tion is the emphatic substitution of "translatable into" for "re- ducible to." However, because the effect of this substitution on the work of the scientist, for example the psychologist, is practi- cally nil-he will have to be a behaviorist in the one case as well as the other-I presume that it will not be illicit to use the term "physicomorphism" both for reductionism and translationism. The awareness of the anthropomorphic character of physical concepts was, as we all know from the history of science and philosophy, rather difficult to achieve, and, correspondingly, the process of de-anthropomorphization was a very slow one. From animism to Plato's ideas, from Plato's ideas to Aristotle's four causes, from the emphasis upon final and formal cause to the em- phasis on material and efficient cause, from this emphasis to the concept of real and necessary connection, how laboriously did thought and science proceed! How strong was the resistance to the last stages of the process that culminated in the complete elimination of all anthropomorphic residues in the modernistic con- 3 Cf. the author's article quoted above.</page><page sequence="4">348 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY ception of causality: causality as a sequence of events in a physical system such that from a mathematical function describing the initial state of the system expressions could be deduced which could be verified (confirmed) or falsified (disconfirmed) by future events! 4 Physical necessity, the last residue of anthropomor- phism, was replaced by logical necessity plus "sequence of events." The process of de-physicomorphization will probably be much faster than that of de-anthropomorphization, because our "sci- entific conscience" has become more sensitive and will permit no kind of dogmatism to rule longer than the moment in which we become aware of its being a dogmatism. The physicomorphist may shout till his lungs burst that, since causality means in the sphere of physics such and such a thing, causality will mean noth- ing else in any other science. Yet I am convinced that in the end the events themselves investigated in the various sciences and the unprejudiced, undogmatic attitude of research will force upon us the realization of different meanings of causality for different "ontological" kinds of events. There is little doubt in my mind that the psychoanalyst, for instance, when he tries to change the behavior of his patient by changing the status of some very deep- seated beliefs, entertains, in doing so, a conception of causality that in no way can be reduced to what the positivist tells us it means. II The main task before us is to bring to the fore the decisional nature of physicomorphism. It is decisional in two closely re- lated respects. Firstly, it is decisional in that it appropriates the Greek decision about man, the decision that man is a rational ani- mal. This decision is a meta-rational decision. By this I do not mean an irrational decision prompted by the non-rational part of man, by emotions or instincts; I mean by it a decision for which in principle no reasons can be given because the giving of reasons, rational or irrational ones, is made possible by that very decision. That man decided to be rational is itself a meta-rational decision.5 Secondly, physicomorphism is decisional in that it is a moral theory, in the widest sense of the term "moral" in which it be- comes synonymous with "exi'stential." It involves a decision about man in the form of a self-conception of man which is apt to 4 As with any concept, this de-anthropomorphized concept of causality is formed by man and, it is argued, therefore anthropomorphic. This is a completely illicit use of the term. A concept is anthropomorphic with respect to its objective reference and not at all with respect to its subjective origin. 5 For this concept of meta-rational decision cf. the author's "Philosophy and this War," in Philosophy of Science, Vol. 10 (1943), pp. 176 ff.</page><page sequence="5">TH:E PHYSICOMORPHIC CONCEPTION OF MAN 349 ehange the style of human existence. In one word, physico- morphism is, or may become, a program of human self-realization. Being decisional in these two interconnected senses, physico- morphism can not be debated, like the theory of relativity or any other scientific theory, merely on the basis of empirical evidence, internal consistency, etc. It may be acceptable in every such re- spect-and yet unacceptable as a decision about man. This is the difference, or rather one of the differences, between a theory in philosophy and a theory in science. The unscientific character of philosophy is based on this moral, existential, or whatever you want, involvement and impact of philosophy, and even those of us today who desire to make philosophy scientific in the sense of limiting it to the analysis of the language of science, are not able to avoid this fate. Not only is this limitation of philosophy to a particular subject a decision made by man, it is above all a deci- sion made about man. A theory concerning scientific theories is more than a theory. It is a decision about theorizing man. In the remainder of the paper I shall try to clarify these statements. The positivistic conception of causality in its appli- cation to psychology will serve as an illustration of the general thesis that hypotheses or theories concerning man are, or can be- come, programs of human self-realization. The positivistic conception of causality is, to repeat, predict- ability on the basis of a law which ideally is expressed as a func- tional equation. Causality means nothing but a sequence of events plus logical necessity. This, we are told, is what it means in physics and what it should mean in any science, however distant from reaching the ideal of functional equations psychology, history, and similar sciences may be. Supposing that we accept this analysis of causality for the natural sciences. Supposing, furthermore, that we accept the positivistic conception of what any "true" science, any truly sci- entific science ought to be and that, on the basis of this conception of science, we permit the psychologist to become a physicomorphist and to conceive of his subject-matter in terms of physical events. We have, then, been made to accept a certain general hypothesis concerning man. Man is to be conceived, at least for purposes of scientific investigation, as a sequence of (behavioral) events. Here as anywhere else it is the regularity in the sequence of events plus logical necessity, which gives the meaning of causality. Recently, the physicomorphist has permitted himself to intro- duce terms such as dispositional properties which would have been anathema, I believe, to the more radical early representatives. While this is another welcome indication of the beginning process</page><page sequence="6">350 THE JOURNAL OP PHILOSOPHY of de-physicomorphization, it changes very little with respect to the basic conception of man entertained by physicomorphists and physicomorphic psychologists. And it is this basic conception of man which interests us here. The physicomorphist will, of course, shake his head at so much wilful ignorance. Has he not asserted a hundred times that his only interest is in the language of science and that he says nothing about the nature of man or any other scientific subject-matter! It may suffice at this point to make him admit that ultimately his conception of philosophy as critique of the language of science is a true child of the Greek conception of man as rational animal and that, in this sense at least, his philosophy implies a conception of the nature of man. Later on, I shall point out why I believe that the disarming modesty with which he limits himself to an analysis of language is Tartuffean in scope, if not in character. In conceiving man as a sequence of events, the physicomorphist, I submit, has made a decision about man, about you, about me, about the style of every man's existence. And this for the simple reason which yet is so difficult to grasp, the reason, namely, that a theory about man is apt to alter man. . . .every application of the law of causality to the will of the individual and every information gained in this way is itself a motive acting upon the will, so that the result which is being looked for is continually being changed. Hence it would be a complete mistake to attribute the impossibility of forecasting the subject's actions on purely causal lines to a lack of knowledge which might be overcome if the individual intelligence were suitably increased. Such an in- ference is analogous to the process of ascribing the impossibility of simul- taneously determining exactly the position and the velocity of an electron to the inadequacy of our methods of measuring. The impossibility of foretelling the subject's actions on purely causal lines is not based on any lack of knowl- edge, but on the simple fact that no method by whose application the object is essentially altered can be suitable for the study of this object.6 Planck stresses the point that the methods applied in these non- physical sciences necessarily alter their object. My emphasis is different from Planck's. I could imagine that psychology and the social sciences develop methods whose application leaves the ob- ject unaltered. Even so, the theories which we would develop on the basis of these methods would alter the object; or rather, in entertaining these theories and in holding these beliefs we our- selves are altered. In the field of human facts and events theories concerning them can produce the facts that verify the theories. This is the main point of my argument. I should like to en- large upon it and compare different beliefs with respect to the ef- 6 Planck, Philosophy of Physi?s, p. 80.</page><page sequence="7">THE PHYSICOMORPHIC CONCEPTION OF MAN 351 fects they have, or can have, upon their objects and upon those who entertain them. The kind of belief that interests us most consists of beliefs entertained by man about himself; beliefs, that is, in which object of belief and believing subject coincide either par- tially or totally. For purposes of confrontation we shall begin, however, with a belief in which the object-about is a non-human being. "I believe that this is a table." The belief has no direct ef- fect upon the thing which I believe to be a table; but it may have effects upon me. I may behave towards the thing in certain ways which would have been excluded if I had believed it to be a chair. And indirectly, namely, through my actions engendered by my belief, the thing itself may be affected. In any case, this belief has had, or could have had, observable effects upon me. However, can we say that it has changed me'? The unsophisticated and, I believe, ultimately correct answer is no. I am the same person before, dur- ing, and after the actions which were the effects that the belief had upon me. We turn now to beliefs that man entertains about himself and begin with a group that in all important respects is still very close to the preceding one. This group is made up by beliefs concern- ing human facts on a merely biological level. Such is, for ex- ample, the belief that I have two big toes. Not only does the fact that I have two big toes remain unaffected by my believing it; the belief itself seems to be normally without any psychological impact upon me. It may, in certain situations, engender actions such as cutting their nails. But on the whole I would say that entertain- ing the belief or not entertaining it, being prompted to action or not being prompted by it, leaves me in the same sense unchanged as did the belief that this is a table. However, there are beliefs concerning biological facts whose psychological impact can go much deeper. This is the case when- ever the biological fact believed in is relevant to the social status or the more important interests of the believer. "I believe that I have blond hair. " The fact itself that I have blond hair can in no way be affected by my believing that I have blond hair. But under certain conditions the entertaining of this belief may have more or less strong psychological effects upon me, and what seemed at first glance a merely biological fact receives the status of a social fact. If I live in a race-conscious society and become race-conscious myself I may take the fact of my having blond hair as an indica- tion of my racial background and be filled with pride or self- contempt concerning it. I am not sure that this psychological im- pact of the belief is strong enough to permit me to say that I am no</page><page sequence="8">352 THE JOURNAL OP PHILOSOPHY longer the same afterwards. There is no doubt, however, that -the faet itself of my having blond hair remains what it was, a brute fact. Even more striking is the impact of beliefs concerning biologi- cal facts on the believer in those cases where the facts believed in are generated by the belief. Any doctor can cite examples of somatic facts produced by beliefs concerning them. The belief that I have ulcers may cause ulcers. Actual impotence may be the effect of believing oneself impotent. And the thought of having high blood pressure may change normal blood pressure to high pressure. Here we have come very close to what I would like to call the existential impact of a belief. Beliefs that have existential impact usually are, or imply, a self-conception of man. "St. Franeis is my ideal of a human being." It can hardly be said that this belief has, or can have, any effects upon St. Francis. But it has, or can have, effects upon me. In certain situations I would behave quite differently if I did not believe that St. Francis is my ideal of man. Even if there is only a moment's hesitation before I en- gage in an action contrary to that ideal, the belief has had its ef- fects. Has it changed me, or could it have changed me? I think it must be admitted that such beliefs can considerably change him who entertains them. Step by step I can translate the ideal into actions and thus St. Francisize myself, and this process will be the smoother the less resistance it finds in the "natural" tendencies of my person. But smooth as the process may be, at the end I am no longer the same person I was at its beginning. I have changed. Similarly, the belief that I am an American (and my beliefs with respect to what it means to be an American) are apt to make me an American, or to make me more American. The belief is, or can be, productive of effects upon me which make this belief come true. The facts that make the belief true are being engendered by the belief itself. This is what I would call the existential im- pact of a belief to distinguish it from the practical and psychologi- cal effects. A self-conception of man is being realized in the ex- istence of man. Somewhere in the middle, between a belief concerning a brute fact and a belief that holds before me what I should be or how I should behave, are beliefs such as "sex is at the bottom of our behavior" or "wars are imperialistic means to expand markets." It may be true to a certain extent that sex is at the bottom of our behavior and that wars are imperialistie means, but by acknowl- edging these beliefs as true principles we are apt to create the facts that verify them to an ever increasing degree. Such theories are</page><page sequence="9">THE PHYSICOMORPHIC CONCEPTION OF MAN 353 more than merely scientific theories. They change man 's self- conception and thereby man's existence. No scientific theory con- cerning non-human facts can have this existential impact. In other words, such theories are much less statements of fact than decisions. Although they may have the character of scientifically testable statements, they can have effects upon man which make them come true even though their truth was at best partial before the belief was entertained. In entertaining these beliefs we make ourselves live as if it were a fact that sex is the basic drive and war an imperialistic tool, and thus we create the facts that verify the statements. The result of this analysis of beliefs entertained by man about himself can be summarized in the following way: (1) There are beliefs concerning human facts or events which are in no important respect different from beliefs concerning physical events. The beliefs concerning these facts have no effect upon the facts themselves, and have, or can have, effects of only psychological and/or practical nature upon him who entertains these beliefs. (2) Beliefs which are, or imply, a self-conception of man, pro- duce, or can produce, the facts that verify them. The truth of such a belief consists in the belief making itself true by engender- ing the actions through which this self-conception is realized in the existence of man. This we have called the existential impact of a belief. (3) In between the first group of beliefs which have no effect upon the facts that verify them, and the second group which pro- duce the facts that verify them, is that group of beliefs which have at least some basis in brute fact and yet at the same time are apt to produce facts that may increasingly verify them. For the purposes of this paper, only the beliefs that have ex- istential impact are relevant. I would like to single out one par- ticular group, namely, beliefs concerning the nature of man in general. When they become rationally articulate these beliefs take the form of definitions: "Man is a rational animal." When they become emotionally articulate, they take the form of metaphors such as: "Man is made in the image of God." Consider a belief such as "man is a rational animal." Is there any doubt that in thus defining man Aristotle, and the Greeks altogether, meant to say that this is what every man, simply as man and quite apart from individual differences, really is, a rational animal? But is there any doubt that in thus stating what man is, they did much more? They started the whole trend toward ever</page><page sequence="10">354 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY increasing rationalization of the human animal. They not only stated what man is, but they set a program of human self-realiza- tion. They made a decision about man, a decision which gained the strange status of what I have at another time called a "peri- conscious horizon" within which two millennia of human history have moved. And the other basic decision expressed in the metaphor that man is made in the image of God is, too, both a de- vice of expressing what men felt man to be and at the same time a decision involving a whole history of human self-realization. Definitions and metaphors of this kind, intending to express what man is, become much more than definitions and metaphors. They grow into decisions about man, into programs of human self-realization, into peri-conscious horizons that form the abiding substance of the ever changing course of a culture. It is up to the historian and sociologist to explain why certain definitions have be- come such abiding horizons while others have disappeared with less traces left on man than the winds have left on the waters of Lake Minnetonka. I suppose that personal enthusiasm as much as the readiness of a community to recognize its deepest aspirations in the words and actions of an individual, the propitiousness of the occasion as well as the total constellation of political, social, and economic factors must all work together for one definition or one metaphor to become the substance of the ages to come. But it is up to the philosopher to insist upon the double-faced character of all statements concerning the nature of man; to insist that this is a basic "fact" about human facts, namely, that expressions con- cerning what man is are at once decisions about man; that man becomes what he believes he is-within the limitations mentioned above. The responsibilities of scientist and philosopher that accrue from the awareness that statements concerning man may grow into history-making decisions about man are grave. This is an issue we will not discuss here. Neither can we go into the thorny problem concerning the self-reference of our main thesis. If the basic fact about human facts is that propositions about man are at once decisions about man, then this very proposition has at once the impact of a decision. I return to physicomorphism to apply to it the result of our reflections. Avoiding the reductive fallacy of old-fashioned ontological materialism and embracing what might facetiously be called logi- cal materialism, the physicomorphists of today assert that all state- ments concerning mental events can either be reduced to, or trans- lated into, statements concerning observable behavior. And these</page><page sequence="11">THE PHYSICOMORPHIC CONCEPTION OF MAN 355 statements, in turn, can be reduced to, or translated into, terms defined in physics. Thus the methods used in the sciences concern- ing man would in the main be able to follow those standards, the adherence to which has brought enormous success to the natural sciences. In the end, the formulation of laws of human behavior would be achieved and the predictability of human behavior on the basis of these laws would bring under rational control a sphere of nature that has so far eluded it. Man's power over nature would reach its climax in man's rational control of himself and society. I do not want to question the possibility, nor even the desira- bility, of this Brave New World. Within the horizon of the Greek decision about man and within the equally decisional hori- zon of mathematics as the ideal of human knowledge, this final subsumption of the whole universe and everything in it under the concept of functional equations that permit extrapolation-or whatever else you may formulate as the essence of law of nature- is perhaps the supreme achievement into which the rational roots of Western culture have blossomed-or withered. Yet it remains a puzzling historical paradox that a development which begins with the Greek conviction of the divine nature of reason in man should end with the conception of man as a sequence of behavioral events. The physicomorphist may assert to his heart's content and his conscience's calm that he asserts nothing about man himself, but only about the language of the sciences concerning man. Common sense will rightly not let him get away with this hypocrite sophistication and will understand him to as- sert that man is nothing but a sequence of behavioral events. In whatever harmlessly logical form the thesis of physicomorphism is presented, it is more than a theory concerning the language of science. It can not help becoming a definition of the nature of man. If the sciences, and theories concerning the sciences, were as esoteric as abstract art, one could be satisfied and consider physicomorphism a harmless pastime, without major effects on man and society. During the last three centuries, however, science has become the most important factor in the formation of our world view, replacing religion, art, and philosophy. It still takes a long time before new scientific theories are sedimented into ingredients of the world view entertained by everyday-man. How many cen- turies were needed in the process of making John Doe's world Copernican and Newtonian? What matters is not the time con- sumed in the process, but the fact of the process itself. Today's</page><page sequence="12">356 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY scientific theory will be, tomorrow or a century from tomorrow, common credo. Physicomorphism, harmlessly beginning as a theory about the language of psychology, will mold psychology in its image, and once psychology has been convinced that its subject-matter can best be studied behavioristically, John Doe himself will begin to con- ceive himself as a sequence of behavioral and ultimately physiologi- cal events plus, perhaps, dispositional properties. The behavioristic conception of man, however justifiable it may appear from the viewpoint of the development of a "sound" psychology, is apt to become, like any such conception of man, a decision about man, a program of human self-realization. But it is not only apt to become such a decision. Under the enormous and ever-increasing impact of science upon man's conception of himself and his world, it is actually bound to become a program of human self-realization. It is in this sense that our central contention must be under- stood: physicomorphism has existential or moral implications. As a theory concerning the language of science it has had and is hav- ing a great influence upon the sciences themselves. The sciences, in turn, have shaped, and are shaping, man's conception of the nature of man. Such a conception, as we have seen, is productive of facts that verify it, and thus physicomorphism will finally be translated into a general style of human existence. The main task of the paper was to bring to the fore these ex- istential implications of physicomorphism and to make us aware of its decisional character. Further we can not go. Here the border is reached which we can never avoid whenever we engage in such problems, the border where we would have to enter the frightening field of the meta-rational. For where in the field ac- cessible to reason can be found the "reasons" that justify this or any other basic decision concerning the nature of man? WALTER CERF BROOKLYN COLLEGE</page></plain_text>
