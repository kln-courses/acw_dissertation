<plain_text><page sequence="1">REASON AND REVELATION IN THE THEOLOGY OF MAIMONIDES The Conflict Between Philosophy and the Torah BEN ZION BOKSER THE religious perplexities through which Maimonides sought to guide men had their origin in the conflict between the teachings of philosophy and the doctrines of the Torah. Philoso phy for Maimonides had a technical meaning. It was the attempt to interpret existence by means of reason alone, without reference to the truths deriving from the Torah, and even without refer ences to the process of revelation by which the truths of the Torah became known to man. Its central elements were natural science and metaphysics. The most distinguished représenta tives of philosophy were the Greek thinkers, particularly Plato and Aristotle. Maimonides had a great respect for the achievements of the philosophers. He hailed their method as invaluable in the investi gâtions of the natural order. Aristotle, he held, had carried reason to her supreme triumphs, and he ranked him second only to the prophets. But in the precious fruit of knowledge offered by philosophy there was also a worm. The philosophers taught that the universe was eternal, and they looked upon existence as a self-sufficient enterprise, where all events transpire by necessity, in accordance with the immutable workings of the laws of cause and effect.1 1 Moreh I 5, 17; II 21, 23, 26; III 17, 21; Letter to the Jews of Marseilles, KobetzKobetz Teshubot ha-Rambam ve-Igrotov, ed.

Maimonides confessed himself able to allegorize such pas sages and, if necessary, bring them into harmony with the views of of the eternalists. But, as he saw it, an eternal universe would allow no room for the entire body of doctrines which are funda mental to our religious faith. Aristotelians who taught the eternity of the universe, believed in the existence of God. But what was the Aristotelian concep tion of God? He was the unmoved mover, the first step in the chain of causation by which the sequence of events has its being. He generated motion and activity in all things by the fact that He drew them toward Himself through the love which He excited in them, but He performed no direct, transitive action. He was not a free agent pursuing plans and purposes freely willed by Him. In such a universe miracles are impossible. And if we dis believe in miracles generally, how can we believe in the resurrec tion of the dead? Prophecy in an Aristotelian system cannot be a free grace, conferred by the Divine Being, as it is in the Torah. Surely such a system allows no room for the unique revelation of Moses.

Be cause Aristotle was the most important philosopher he naturally felt it essential to defend the Torah primarily against Aristotelian teachings, par ticularly the theory that the universe is eternal. When he speaks of the "phi losophers" anonymously, therefore, he often has in mind Aristotle and his disciples, as in Moreh II 26. But the term "philosophers" was more general and he applied it to all who seek knowledge through logical demonstration. Thus he spoke of various schools of philosophy, including those who preceded Plato, and he of course regarded Plato as one of the very important philoso phers (in letters to R. Judah ibn Tibbon and R. Hisdai ha-Levi.) In the Essay on Resurrection he refuses to recognize the Mutakallemim as philoso phers because they did not pursue rigorous analysis in their studies. In the Letter to the Jews of Yemen, ibid, p. 1b, he cites the writings of various pagan thinkers, among them the Greeks, as adversaries of the Torah. Cf. Leo Strauss, "The Literary Character of The Guide." in Essays on Maimonides, ed. by S. Baron. N. Y. 1941, pp. 41 f.</page><page sequence="3">[3] REASON AND REVELATION IN MAIMONIDES 543 destined to be authoritative for all time to come and the selec tion of a particular people as the channel through which it was to reach the rest of mankind, implies a freely choosing God, act ing with design and purpose. In an Aristotelian universe prophecy can exist only as a necessary consequence of a certain perfection in the prophet, and it must recur in identical form with the recurrence of the circumstances which produce it. Divine providence, too, cannot mean in the Aristotelian sys tem what it obviously means in the Torah. If existence is eternal and God is merely the first link in an endless round of being, God's providence cannot extend except to what is eternal, and that is the species of each type of existence. The individual mem bers of the species who appear and disappear, lacking the element of eternity, must necessarily be outside of God's concern. They are, in other words, left to the workings of chance. In the Torah the individual person is the center of God's solicitude; the indi vidual man's destiny is the chief concern in God's providential ordering of the entire process of existence. If we accept the Aristotelian view, the individual person would be subject to the ravages of chance, rather than to the providence of God. The philosophical doctrine of God is seemingly at variance with Scripture in other respects too. As the philosophers por trayed God, He is incorporeal, free of all emotions and all attri butes, beyond the accidents of time and space. In the Torah God is frequently spoken of in anthropomorphic terms, and all these elements of corporeality are freely ascribed to Him.2 The awareness of these and various other elements of incom patibility between philosophy and the Torah created a perplexity in the minds of many Jews of his day. And Maimonides sought to remove those perplexities. As he saw it, the conflict was rooted in a misunderstanding. There was an area of conflict where the 2 Moreh II 25, and see below, pp. 9, 35. Maimonides believed that the bodies of the righteous would be resurrected at the beginning of the Mes sianic era, but that they would die again upon its termination to enjoy an everlasting existence in spirit only. A similar view was taken by Abraham ibn Ezra (Commentary, Dan. 12.2). Cf. J. Finkel, "Maimonides' Treatise on Resurrection," in Proceedings, American Academy for Jewish Research, N. Y. !939- P• 69.</page><page sequence="4">544 BEN ZION BOKSER [4] philosophers overreached themselves and taught doctrines that did not follow from objective evidence or the rigorous application of the postulates of reason. On the other hand, there was another area of conflict where men were simply misinterpreting Scripture. They followed the simple, literal text, whereas if they had a more authentic conception of what Scripture teaches, they would find no conflict. It was in the service of removing this conflict between phi losophy and the Torah that Maimonides wrote the Guide to the Perplexed Perplexed and carried on an extensive correspondence with vari ous Jewish leaders in other communities. As he put it in the introduction to the Guide: "The object of this treatise is to en lighten a religious man who has been trained to believe in our holy Law . . . and at the same time has been successful in his philosophical studies. Human reason has attracted him to abide in its sphere; and he finds it difficult to accept as correct the teachings based on the literal interpretation of the Law ... Hence he is lost in perplexity and anxiety . . ."3 The key in this labor of enlightenment for Maimonides lay in a clarification of reason and revelation, the respective sources of knowledge through which philosophy and the Torah derive their truth. Man's Gift of Reason Reason and revelation are for Maimonides two complementary phenomena. Each has its distinctive role to play in the enlighten ment of man toward the truth. And in the decisions that face us in life we must depend on both, if we are to act in conformity with our true end. The capacity to reason is for Maimonides man's greatest distinction in the hierarchy of life. While other creatures live by the exercise of instinctive vitalities, man can plan and analyze; he can extract from his experience principles of universal signi ficance and acquire a body of valid knowledge concerning the nature of things. His reason "analyzes and divides the component parts of things, it forms abstract ideas of them, represents them 3 Moreh, Introduction.</page><page sequence="5">[5] REASON AND REVELATION IN MAIMONIDES 545 in their true form as well as in their causal relations, deducts from the object a great many facts... ; it distinguishes that which is the property of the genus from that which is peculiar to the individuals — and no proof is correct unless founded on the for mer; the intellect further determines whether certain qualities of a thing are essential or non-essential." The rational faculty functions in various forms. It is prac tical and as such engineers tools for the service of human needs. Among the fruits of practical reason are such arts as architecture, agriculture, medicine and navigation. There is also the specula tive reason which reveals to us "things as they really are, and which by nature are not subject to change." The supreme idea which reason can formulate is "the unity of God and all the divine concepts associated with it." It is insofar as he uses his reason that man rises to the full dignity of his humanity. Thus he qualifies for the grandest of all his attributes. Scripture designates him as a creature made in the divine image. And thus he stands differentiated from the lower elements of existence. "Before he develops understanding and acquires knowledge, man is accounted as the beast. He is only distinguished from the rest of the animal creation by the consciousness that he is a living being possessed of intellect."4 Reason Is Not Enough By its own resources, however, reason could not guide man toward his highest end. What is man's highest end? It is a state of continuing fellowship with God, which is the esence of true worship. In its final character, it is an emotional reaction, but it is always based on an intellectual foundation. That foundation is the recognition of God's wisdom and perfection as revealed in the wisdom and perfection of creation about us, in the natural order as well as in the Torah. When this recognition is deep enough, it will in time produce an emotional response, an ecstatic 4 Moreh I I, 73; III 8; Commentary on Mishnah, Introduction; Eight chapters, ch. 1, 2; Millot ha-Higayon, section 9.</page><page sequence="6">546 BEN ZION BOKSER [6] eagerness to reach out for closeness with the divine source from which all the wonder of life flows.5 Maimonides described the transition from knowledge to wor ship in these terms: "At the time when one reflects on His works, and His wonderful and stupendous creations, and from them perceives His wisdom which is incomparable and unbounded, he immediately loves, praises, glorifies and yearns with an ardent longing to know the great God . . . And when one reflects upon these very things, he immediately starts back, is struck with fear and terror, and is conscious that he is a creature, insignifi cant, lowly and immature, standing with only slight and scanty knowledge. As David said, 'When I consider Thy heavens, the work of Thy fingers, what is man that Thou art mindful of him?' " (Ps. 8-44)6 5 Moreh III 51; Yad, Yesode ha-Torah 4:12. Among the Arabs there was a school of thought which held the Koran as eternal, in the sense of the eternity of Platonic ideas. Philo with his doctrine of the logos, as well as others, rep resented a similar view in Judaism. But Maimonides definitely denied this and taught that the Torah was a creation in time, and he called attention to many striking parallels between the characteristics of the Torah and of nature (Moreh(Moreh I 65, III 32, 34). Cf. Ch. Neuburger, Das Wesen des Gesetzes in der Philosophie Philosophie des Maimonides, Danzig 1933, pp. 17 f., 68. The kind of Torah study which would reflect on the greatness of its creator included a probing into the ultimate objectives of the commandments and an investigation into vital doctrinal matters, the "roots of religion." The simple, literal study of Torah, Maimonides regarded as insufficient (Moreh, Introduction, III 51). In Sefer ha-Mitzvot, Positive Commandments, 3, he explicitly links the study of Torah with the study of nature as a means of fulfillment the commandment to love God. 6 Yad, Yesode ha-Torah, 2.1, 2. This fear, derived from the sense of awe in contemplating creation is here taken as a fulfillment of the duty to "fear the Lord thy God" (Deut. 10.20). However, in Sefer ha-Mitzvot, Positive Com mandment 4, Maimonides applies this verse to the fear deriving from the prospect of God's punishment. The divergence becomes clear when we con sider the character of the Sefer ha-Mitzvot. As he makes clear in the introduc tion, this treatise was intended to defend his computation of the commandments as employed in the Yad, against the anticipated objections of the common people who had been habituated to follow the system of computations formu lated by Rabbi Simon Kahira in his Halakot Gedolot. The common people, of course, were incapable of reaching the fear of God at its highest level. It was a common doctrine of Maimonides that the prescriptions of the</page><page sequence="7">[7] REASON AND REVELATION IN MAIMONIDES 547 Can we by the resources of reason alone reach this end? Will reason in itself guide us to the knowledge which underlies the true experience of communion with God? Maimonides answered that it could not. For one thing, the processes of reason are elaborate and intricate and religious knowledge highly profound and subtle. Even the intellectually gifted must go through a long development before they will be duly equipped to pursue meta physical studies. They must master as preliminary disciplines logic, mathematics, and the natural sciences. The knowledge of astronomy and physics, for instance, is indispensable for a recog nition of divine providence. How else can we know how God manifests Himself in the ordering of nature than by a study of nature? And how can we guard against the pitfalls of fallacious reasoning than through a thorough training in the rigorous dis ciplines of logic and mathematics? And there are moral pre-requisites as well. The intellectual, the person who is to use his intellect effectively in the pursuit of knowledge, must have a sense of integrity and care for the truth more than for his private inclinations. He must have daring to break with convention and custom and pursue the truth wherever it leads, even if thereby he is forced to surrender long cherished notions. Maimonides attacked the Moslem theo logians who elaborated various theories without objectively Torah addressed themselves to the common people, at their level of under standing, while for the educated the same texts, in a more figurative rendition, conveyed a deeper meaning. See below, pp. 34 f. The fact that the Sefer ha MitzvotMitzvot was intended for the common people may explain the formulation of the first two positive commandment which call for the belief in God, and His unity, whereas in the Yad, he calls not for belief but for knowledge. Ch. Heller, in his edition of the Sefer ha-Mitzvot, notes this divergence and suggests that the Arabic אעתקאד used in the Sefer ha-Mitzvot may possibly be translated as know, thus paralleling the meaning in the Yad. Cf. also Sefer Sefer ha-Mitzvot, Negative commandment 365, which justifies the conceal ment of the rationality of certain commandments from the common people, while in Yad, Temurah, end, he urges the search into the reasons for all com mandments. On the two levels of the fear of God, cf. Albo, Ikkarim, III 33 and also Bahya in Hobot ha-Lebabot, III 3 where the distinction is explicitly made, with the lower level of fear corresponding to the capacities of the un educated. The lower level of fear is of course seen as provisional, to be super seded by the higher fear, as intellectual development progresses.</page><page sequence="8">548 BEN ZION BOKSER [8] studying the facts; they held those theories merely because they aided them in their religious apologetics. What man must do is "adapt his opinions to the true properties of things; he cannot expect the properties of things to adapt themselves to his opinions." And the intellectual must have a certain humility to know the limits of the human mind and not to insist on pressing with inquiry into realms where it cannot fruitfully operate. "I de clare," wrote Maimonides, "that there is a limit to the knowledge of man, and so long as the soul is in the body, it cannot know what is beyond nature. Since knowledge resides in nature, it cannot perceive beyond it. Therefore when the mind essays to contemplate what is beyond, it is unable to do so for the reason that the matter is too high for it." Above all, the intellectual must have patience and not hasten to a conclusion unless a rigorous analysis of the facts really warrant it. The most gifted mind may fail to qualify a man for the status of a true intellectual. "The intelligence of man is insufficient; for he is not endowed with perfection at the beginning but at first possesses perfection potentially, not in fact." And there is no guarantee that these potentialities will be realized. One cannot successfully achieve the required development, with all that it involves, without the peace of mind that comes from economic security, or without the opportunity of leisure to con template the world. And one must have, too, the mellowness and calmness of disposition which comes with a maturity of years. Ypung people generally make poor students of meta physics; "it is impossible for them to comprehend it on account of the heat of the blood and the flame of youth, which confuses their minds; that heat which causes all disorder must first dis appear; they must have become moderate and settled, humble in their hearts and subdued in their temperaments." The processes of reason would thus be a poor instrument of religious knowledge. It is a method by which only a few persons would be instructed who are intellectually well-prepared. If there were no other source of guidance for our lives, "we would have been bound to believe only what we could prove, a goal which could only be attained by long preparation. In such a case</page><page sequence="9">[9] REASON AND REVELATION IN MAIMONIDES 549 most people would die, without having known whether there was a God or not, much less that certain things must be asserted about Him, and other things denied as defects. From such a fate not 'even one of a city or two of a family' (Jer. 3.14) would have escaped."7 Reason, moreover, because it cannot operate effectively beyond the empirical world, will be unable to answer certain crucial questions. It cannot tell us, for instance, whether the universe was created or is eternal. The Aristotelians had taught the eternity of the universe, but Maimonides showed that on rational grounds alone the matter was quite inconclusive. Yet this was a most crucial question indeed. For in an eternal uni verse all events are pre-determined, in accordance with the necessities inherent in the nature of things, and God Himself is bound by such necessities. This would rule out such funda mental doctrines of our religion as the belief in miracles, the resurrection of the dead, a providential ordering of the lives of individuals, and the Scriptural doctrine of prophecy, particularly the unique prophecies of Moses. In the words of Maimonides, "If we were to accept the eternity of the universe as taught by Aristotle, that everything in the universe is the result of fixed laws, that nature does not change, and that there is nothing supernatural, we should necessarily be in opposition to our religion. We should disbelieve in miracles and signs and certainly reject all hopes and fears derived from Scriptures."8 ' Moreh I 31-36, 72; II 23; Letter to R. Hisdai ha-Levi, 23a. The distrust for the intellectual competence of youth appears in Plato, Republic, 7, where he objects to young men studying dialectics. The power of habit as a hindrance in the pursuits of reason is described by Maimonides as new, while the other difficulties were already recognized by Alexander of Aphrodisias. Leo Strauss, Philosophie Philosophie und Gesetz, Berlin 1935, p. 46, has made the plausible suggestion that Maimonides is referring especially to the habituated interpretations of Scripture, which he indeed mentions to illustrate his general point. The Greeks did not have an authoritative Scripture, whose conventional inter pretations could have impeded \heir speculations. 8 Moreh III 17, II 13-29; Essay against Galen, 22a, 22b, Essay on the Resurrection 10b, 11a. Letters to Marseilles Jewry and to R. Hisdai ha-Levi 23a, 23b, 24a, 25b, 26a. Natural law is not a very common term in medieval philosophy. According to the view which is more commonly maintained by</page><page sequence="10">550 BEN ZION BOKSER [10] Intellectual perfection, too, cannot operate without ante cedent perfections. Human life has its physical side, and a person will be unable to give himself to intellectual labors until his physical needs are satisfied. "A person who is suffering from great hunger, thirst, heat, or cold, cannot grasp an idea even if the medieval philosophers all substances are endowed with fixed properties from which flow certain types of activity, and they flow necessarily, because of the properties inherent in the essence of those substances, or because of their natures. The more general term nature, simply refers to the sum-total of natures. Maimonides believed in this doctrine of nature, but since God is the Creator of nature, He may respect those necessities but is not wholly bound by them. As he put it in Moreh II 29: "For we believe that this universe remains perpetually with the same properties with which the Creator has endowed it, and that none of these will ever be changed except by way of a miracle in some individual instances, although the Creator has the power to change the whole universe, to annihilate it, or to remove any of its properties." Miracles, how ever, do not abrogate nature, for the changes wrought by them "were not permanent; they have not become a physical property. On the contrary, the universe since continues in its regular course." From standpoint of Maimon ides the Aristotelian system would negate the super-natural. In Aristotle the term natural is confined to what is constituted of matter and form, so that anything immaterial is supernatural. From the standpoint of Maimonides the supernatural is the realm of God's free activity which transcends the realm of necessity. Cf. E. Gilson, The Spirit of Medieval Philosophy, N. Y. 1936, pp. 365, 472 f., n. 8. Maimonides was aware of the interpretation of the rabbis according to which "miracles are to some extent also natural; for they say when God created the universe with its present physical properties, He made it part of these properties, that they should produce certain miracles at certain times." It is significant that Maimonides calls this interpretation "strange," and that after the statement of his own position he adds: "This should be our belief." Why did not Maimonides accept the view of the rabbis which would bring him into closer harmony with the philosophers? And why does he find that view "strange?" Clearly he wanted a more explicit repudiation of the Aristotelian doctrine of determinism, in which God Himself is bound by the laws of cause and effect. Cf. Moreh II 25 where he rejects the allegorization of miracles as proposed by certain Moslem theologians identified by S. Munk, Le Le Guide des Egarés, Paris 1861, II p. 197 and n. 2 as the Batenis. In a created universe where God can act freely, miracles are possible. Nevertheless, because the universe normally acts in accordance with the nature of things, the burden is always upon us to seek a natural interpretation for events, including those recorded in Scripture, "for it is well-known that we are very eager to avoid notions involving an alteration in the order of creation" (Essay on Resurrec lion).</page><page sequence="11">[11] REASON AND revelation IN maimonides 551 communicated by others, much less can he arrive at it by means of his own reasoning." And the fulfillment of man's physical needs depends ultimately upon the creation of a just order of human relations in the world. A person, to reach his true goal, must also cultivate certain moral virtues. Without those moral virtues, he will be distracted from the life of the soul by a multidude of base passions. More over, it is only morally disciplined people who will know how to overcome selfish drives and help fashion a good society in which there will be justice, and which will enable men to concentrate on intellectual pursuits. "For by following entirely the guidance of lust. . . man loses his intellectual energy, injures his body, and perishes before his natural time; sighs and cares multiply; there is an increase of envy, hatred and warfare for the purpose of taking what another possesses."9 The Path of Prophecy Thus the steering of mankind toward its true end could not be effected by reason alone. Another pathway to truth was needed, and it is offered us through revelation or prophecy. The prophetic experience is a direct illumination concerning the nature of things, concerning the truths about God and about human destiny. Prophecy operates on various levels. In its most familiar form we meet it in the experience of a "call" which impels certain people to perform heroic deeds in the service of some good cause or to become creative in the fields of science, literature, politics or theology. Maimonides describes the "call" to creativity in these vivid terms: "A person feels as if some thing came upon him, and as if he received a new power that encourages him to speak. He treats of science, or composes hymns, exhorts his fellow-men, discusses political and theologi cal problems; all this he does while awake and in the full posses sion of his senses." This type of prophecy inspired the heroic deeds of the judges in the early history of Israel, as well as the books of Psalms, Proverbs, Daniel, Job and Chronicles, in fact י Moreh II 40, III 27, 33, 35.</page><page sequence="12">552 BEN ZION BOKSER [12] all those volumes which the Bible includes under the designation of Hagiogropha. But this is not prophecy in its highest manifestation. When it reaches maturity, prophecy is a mystical experience taking place in a vision or a dream. This is illustrated in the experiences of Ezekiel and Zechariah, which are so vividly described in the sacred Scriptures. In the course of his experience, the prophet may hear voices or behold angels. The angels may hold discourse with him. In his dream, he may even hear God addressing him. Various symbols and allegories may appear, with or without their accompanying interpretations, and a divine light will shine for him. All through this experience, the normal functioning of the body is suspended; a great bodily agitation ensues; and an immense illumination lights up the mystery of existence, as a flash of lightning lights up the darkness of the surrounding night. What normally requires laborious reasoning and, indeed, what laborious reasoning cannot establish, is grasped intuitively and with an overpowering sense of certainty. This is prohecy in its truly authentic form.10 What is the source of the illumination that comes upon the prophets? It is a divine influence, "an emanation sent forth by the Divine Being." It first reaches the Active Intellect, whence it descends on man. The manner in which the influence is exerted on man we cannot know. But clearly there is no material impact. The Bible describes the prophet's message as being conveyed through a speech process. But that is only a metaphor, intended to make the matter more comprehensible to people. Human beings employ speech as a medium 'of communication, and operating with the vocabulary of human experience, the divine communication is also described as speech. "When we are told that God addressed the prophets and spoke to them, our minds are merely to receive a notion that there is a divine knowledge to which the prophets attain; we are to be impressed with the idea that the things which the prophets communicate ta us come 10 Moreh I 10, 76 (2), II 44, 45; Y ad, Yesode ha-Torah 7.2, 3. The divine light is used synonymously with the Shekinah and the Glory of God. Cf. H. A. Wolfson, "Hallevi and Maimonides on Prophecy," JQR, N. S. XXXIII I. P• 77•</page><page sequence="13">[13] REASON AND REVELATION IN MAIMONIDES 553 from the Lord, and are not altogether the products of their own conceptions and ideas." Even when the prophets do hear voices, these voices are not the direct utterances of God. They are "created" voices, of which God is the first cause, as He is the first cause of all things in creation. But God is not corporeal, and He does not act in the manner of corporeal beings. Nor can we assume that the divine influence is set in motion at the time there is a prophet to be enlightened. The divine influence is always in action, except that there are not always men at hand fitted to receive it. Like the gushing waters from a living fountain, knowledge and insight are flowing eternally from God's being. But it takes certain sensitive spirits to receive that knowledge and to channel it to the rest of mankind.11 The faculties with which a prophet receives his experience of illumination are the intellect and the imagination. The intel lect acts in the process of prophecy essentially in the same role as it acts in a process of reason. It formulates concepts. Because of the intensity of the action involved in the illumination, these concepts will form more rapidly, eliminating many intermediate 11 Moreh I 65, II 12, 33, 36, 44; Commentary, Mishnah, Introd. to Helek. In Moreh II 44, Maimonides suggests that the voices heard by the prophet were part of the prophetic vision which had only a subjective existence; they were "created in the imagination" of the prophet, as the commentators (Shem Tob and Efodi) put it. However, it would be difficult to explain the voices heard by Moses on that basis, since he prophesied without the use of the imaginative faculty. See below, p. 18. In Moreh I 65 and II 33, he discusses the voice heard by Moses and treats it as though it had objective existence. Presumably "the created voice" wo Id then be a miracle. In his letter to R. Hisdai ha-Levi he admits that he would have preferred interpreting the hearing of voices by Moses as a metaphor for the process of contemplation, but the explicit declaration in Scripture made such interpretation far-fetched: "As for the sound heard by Moses, undoubtedly it was a created sound formed in nature. But many have said that there was no speech, body or sound in the process, except that the soul of Moses had become absorbed in the contempla tion of exalted intellectual concepts, and he comprehended and heard by means of true discourse, which is the contemplation of divine doctrines . . . Were it not that Scripture repeatedly states (Num. 7.89): 'And he heard the voice speaking to him,' I would accept the latter interpretation." Cf. Z. Diesendruck. "Maimonides' Lehre von der Prophétie," in Jewish Studies in Memory of Israel Abrahams, N. Y. 1927, pp. 124-132.</page><page sequence="14">[14] 554 BEN ZION BOKSER steps on which the process of reason normally depends. And because this intensity derives from the immense character of the influence exerted, the prophet's illumination is more potent even in relation to the volume of truth received. In the nature of things, however, the intellect which is sovereign in the recogni tion and formulation of concepts and ideas must be in a very high state of perfection. The function of the imagination in this process derives from its quality of conveying the truth with the vividness of pictorial and dramatic representation. In the agitation which comes upon a prophet in the wake of his experience, his entire personality is affected, including the imagination, which then proceeds to act on the truth, to clothe it in concrete and vivid imagery. The symbols and allegories, the appearance of angels in corporeal forms, the hearing of angelic or divine voices, all this transpires in the imagination. And thus is the truth brought within the comprehensive powers of the common people who normally live by sense perception, emotion, and customary notions. It is likewise the imagination which endows the prophet with the intuitive powers to foretell what lies ahead. The concepts upon which the imagination acts in this process are furnished by the intellect. Without the work of the imagina tion, however, these concepts would appeal only to the minority of those of high intellectual development. The imagination by endowing them with a pictorial quality, renders them far more comprehensible to the common man. And the vividness and cogency of the experience contribute to the sense of mission which overwhelms the prophet and sends him out to be a teacher and leader of other men. Where the imagination attempts to act as an instrument of cognition, directly to interpret reality in order to arrive at truth, it is bound to beget confusion and error. For the imagination is not a dependable tool for understanding the world. The imagina tion will readily accept the illusions of the senses and of dreams; or it may compound diverse phenomena without reference to the principle of relevance or consistency. Thus the imagination is constantly deceiving us in the illusory convergence of parallel lines. Men with highly gifted imaginations but with poorly</page><page sequence="15">[15] REASON AND REVELATION IN MAIMONIDES 555 developed intellects often go through experiences of "illumina tion" which they interpret as prophecy. But what they see is generally distorted and confused. "They fall into grave errors as regards important speculative principles and see a strange mixture of true and imaginary things." Such persons may, in their dreams, for instance, see forthcoming events, and some of their visions may even be true. But all this is undependable for the grain of such truth is always lost in the chaff of confusion and falsehood. The intellectual prerequisite for prophecy is for the most part a matter of culture, of training, of the acquisition of wisdom and knowledge. The prerequisite imagination on the other hand is largely an endowment. It has its physical basis in the quality of a bodily organ, of the brain, which is not materially affected by training. The functioning of the imagination is, however, affected by man's moral and emotional life. For the imagination will occupy itself with the matters in which a person centers his interests. "It is a well known fact that the thing which engages greatly and earnestly man's attention whilst he is awake and in the full possession of his senses forms during his sleep (or vision) the object of the action of his imaginative faculty. Imagination is then only influenced by the intellect insofar as it is predisposed for such influence." Thus a person may have great intellectual attainments but if he loves the sensuous life or is greedy for wealth and power he disqualifies himself from prophecy. His imagination will play in the realm of his interests; it will give him no light on the subjects of theology or morals; it will bring him no message for the general improvement of mankind. The functioning of the imagination will also be affected by the emotional life. Deep anxieties of the spirit, such as intense grief or anger will obstruct a prophet's vision. All the formal qualifications will avail him but little; he will receive no prophetic communication. Indeed, even the experienced prophet will find his prophetic powers gone when in wake of illness, or of some personal or social tragedy, he becomes demoralized and loses his sense of mastery over himself. These qualifications make a person eligible for prophecy, but they do not guarantee his actually becoming a prophet. There</page><page sequence="16">556 BEN ZION BOKSER [16] have been men who have met all the formal prerequisites, but they did not prophesy. The denial of prophecy to a duly qualified person is a mystery. We can observe it, but not explain it. Like any miracle of God, it illustrates the realm of divine freedom, where events transpire not in automatic fulfillment of the law of cause and effect, but where God acts in accordance with His own undetermined will. Because the process of prophecy is enacted by means of human faculties which are affected by circumstances and which differ in their states of perfection, the prophetic experience is a highly variable phenomenon. "As we have in wisdom one wise man greater than another, so do we have in prophecy, one prophet greater than another." Some may receive prophecies sufficient to broaden their own understanding, but insufficient, as far as becoming active protagonists of those prophecies before the world. With others a more intense experience sends them forth into the world as unyielding crusaders of the truth. With some, prophecy will come irregularly and on infrequent occasions. With others it will come more frequently and more regularly. In one of the most vivid passages of the Moreh, Maimonides thus describes the varying degrees of prophetic illumination: "At times the truth shines so brilliantly that we perceive it as clear as day. Our nature and habit then draw a veil over our perception and we return to a darkness almost as dense as before . . . On some the lightning flashes in rapid succession and they seem to be in continuous light. Some perceive the prophetic flash at long intervals .... By others only once during the whole night is a flash of lightning perceived . . . Others are in the condi tion of men whose darkness is illumined not by lightning but by some kind of crystal or similar stone or other substance that possesses the property of shining during the night; and to them even this small amount of light is not continuous, but now it shines and now it vanishes."12 12 Moreh, Introduction, I 46, 73, II 32, 36, 37, 38; Yad, Yesode ha-Torah 7.4, 5, 6, 7; xo.3; Commentary on Mishnah, Eight Chapters, ch. 7; Sefer ha-Mitzvot,ha-Mitzvot, Negative Commandments, 31; Letter to Yemenite Jews, 6b.

But it has taken on specific form in the course of its historic development. God has seen fit to bestow prophetic leadership to Israel. One does not have to be an adherent of Judaism to attain prophecy. Nevertheless it is in the history of Israel that the great prophets have spoken and acted. Why God has singled out a particular people for this distinction in prophecy we do not know; it is in the realm of the divine mystery which is beyond our comprehension. 108. Maimonides contrasts his doctrine of prophecy with the vulgar views of the "fools," among whom he includes some of his own people, and with the views of the philosophers. The vulgar view makes prophecy entirely a matter of God's choice. Training and preparation are not essential prerequisites. For the philosophers, on the other hand, prophecy is a necessary result of certain perfections to which the prophet has attained. These views on prophecy, Maimonides adds, all derive from the position taken on the origin of the uni verse. Maimonides does not indicate the relationship, but it becomes clear when we realize that the divisions on prophecy are in truth divisions on the manner in which natural law operates. The philosophers, by whom Maimon ides obviously understands the Aristotelians, teach the eternity of the universe, and as a consequence, hold the realm of natural causality as absolute. All events in nature transpire in inescapable conformity to the laws of cause and effect, and even God Himself cannot alter the necessities of nature. Prophecy would therefore likewise have to follow this general law of causation and it would have to be a result of a perfection in the prophet. By the "fools" Maimonides probably meant the Mutakallemim and their disciples who had denied all natural necessity. All events were for them direct interventions of God, Who acts in complete freedom without reference to any properties in herent in the nature of things. Prophecy would therefore likewise derive wholly from the choice of God, and the quality of the prophet's life had no bearing on the matter. Maimonides believed in a realm of natural causality, but this was not absolute. There was still a realm of freedom within which God could act temporarily to suspend the operation of natural causality, as is illustrated in miracles. In its normal functioning, therefore, prophecy follows the requirements of any natural process, and pre-supposes due preparation from the prophet. But God may still intervene temporarily to withhold prophecy from a person duly qualified for it. Cf. I. Abarbanel, on M or eh II 32 and Z. Diesendruck, ibid., p. 78. Arab philosophers had a special reason for relaxing in the requirements of intellectual perfection as a condition for prophecy in order to account for the prophetic gifts of Mohammed. Cf. H. A. Wolfson, ibid., p. 72, n. 182.</page><page sequence="18">[18][18] 558 BEN ZION BOKSER Among the Jewish prophets we reach the climax with Moses. There were prophets who preceded him and others who followed him, but it is in his career that prophecy finds its most trium phant manifestation. Indeed, Moses so outranked the other prophets that his designation by the same title becomes mis leading, and the term "prophet" when applied to him is really a homonym. He alone enjoyed a continuous illumination. And he was so at home in the constant light, that there was no bodily reaction to his experience. Even his imagination did not come into play in the process, and what he saw remained in a state of intellectual purity, without being pictorialized. Indeed, he was so completely emancipated from the claims of his bodily nature that he functioned veritably as a disembodied intelligence. As such he communed with God directly, without the mediation of the imaginative faculty. Because of his unique prophetic powers, Moses was able to do what no other prophet had done before him — he promulgated the Torah in which all the beliefs and practices essential to the perfection of mankind, for all time to come, found their expres sion. Other prophets functioned as teachers and preachers; they exhorted their fellow-men to the truth as they saw it. But they did not see themselves as the emissaries of a divine law which was to be enjoined upon all men. Certain religious laws and customs had their origin in pre Mosaic times. But the pre-Mosaic prophets who established them sought to benefit their own immediate family circle. They did not seek to give those laws universal scope. Abraham, for instance, performed the rite of circumcision upon himself and those of his household, "but he did not address his fellow-men prophetically on this subject." And those laws are authoritative for us only because they were re-affirmed in the Torah of Moses. Thus the proscription of eating the limb of an animal when torn from its living body remains authoritative for us not because Noah has established it, but because the Mosaic law forbids it. Similarly, we practice the rite of circumcision because the Mosaic law so instructs us, not because Abraham instituted it. The work of Moses was likewise decisive in relation to the prophets who followed him. They were primarily concerned with</page><page sequence="19">[19] REASON AND REVELATION IN MAIMONIDES 559 exhorting people to obey the Mosaic law or with criticizing them when they strayed from it. Their work was at no time a departure from what had been instituted by Moses.13 The Mosaic law exists on two levels, the written and the so-called oral Torah. The Pentateuch which is the written Torah includes the more general norms of law and doctrine. A body of interpretations and elaborations thereof were transmitted simul taneously as oral tradition. In time the oral tradition was re duced to writing as well, and it is the foundation of Talmudic literature. Taken together, this Mosaic law is an unchanging body of doctrine and practice by which mankind can steer itself to its true end. In describing the Mosaic law as an unchanging law, qualifi cation should be entered in several respects. Post-Mosaic teachers could of course continue to create a literature of interpretation based on the teachings of Moses, and they were equally free to make independent expressions in moral or doctrinal matters, where they did not conflict with the Mosaic teachings. Moreover, where they did not clash with the Mosaic law, rabbinic author ities were free to enact new legislation. Such new legislation might be in the form of independent enactments or through deduction 13 Moreh II 35, III 8, II 39, Yad, Yesode ha-Torah 7.6, 9.1; Commentary, Mishnah, Helek, 7, Hullin 7.7; Responsum to Joseph ben Gabr of Baghdad, KobetzKobetz II, 15b, 16a, Letter to Yemenite Jews, ibid. 4a, Letter to Joseph b. Judah, ibid., 30b; cf. M. Joel, Die Religionsphilosophie des Moses ben Mai mon,mon, Breslau 1859, pp. 30 f. In his Letter to Yemenite Jews, 4a, he affirms explicitly that "we believe a prophet or we reject him only on the ground of the nature of his prophecy, and not on the ground of his descent," and he cites Job, Zophar, Bildad, Eliphaz, and Elihu, who were all non-Jews and yet rose to prophecy. But this, according to H. A. Wolfson, ibid., pp. 73 f., is inconclusive since these men represented one of the lower levels of prophecy, as is indicated in Moreh II 45. However, elsewhere in the same discussion he seems to include non-Jewish prophets in the same class as Isaiah and Jeremiah. Similarly in Yad, Yesode ha-Torah 9.1, he appears to discuss the character istics of the genuine prophets, and he mentions the possibility of there being non-Jews among them. Such non-Jewish prophets would of course have to be adherents of the seven Noahite commandments. If they observed the Torah in full they would no longer be non-Jews. On the other hand they could not be the teachers of a new religion since any true prophet must conform to the teachings of Moses. See below, p. 22.</page><page sequence="20">560 BEN ZION BOKSER [20] from Mosaic precedents, by a special system of hermeneutics which Moses taught as part of his oral communication. This new legislation was authoritative, but it was known as Rabbinic rather than as Mosaic in character. And under conditions of emergency, individual prophets or Rabbinic courts could temporarily suspend the Mosaic law. "Whether it be to suspend a positive commandment or to trans gress a negative commandment," declared Maimonides, "if its purpose is to bring great numbers back to the faith or to spare many Israelites from stumbling over other pitfalls, they (the rabbinic authorities) are authorized to ordain so, in accordance with the demands of the times. As the physician may amputate a person's hand or foot in order to save his life, so may the rab binic authorities sanction at times the temporary suspension of some religious laws so that the system of religious law as a whole shall survive. In the words of the sages (Shabbat 151b): 'If it is a matter of healing an ill person, desecrate the Sabbath so that he may live to observe many Sabbaths'."14 The most conclusive evidence stands behind the prophecy of Moses, to authenticate its genuineness. All Israelites were present at the divine revelation before Mt. Sinai from which issued the ten commandments, and there they watched Moses as he communed with God. Because prophecy requires a high degree of intellectual perfection as a prerequisite, we cannot assume that the people as a whole shared in that experience. The significance of their presence at Sinai was not in their active participation, but in their serving as witnesses, to attest to the genuineness of the event in which Moses alone was the central 14 Yad, Introduction; Yesode ha-Torah 9.1-4, Mamrim 1, 2; Sefer ha Mitzvot,Mitzvot, Principles 1-3; Commentary, Mishnah, Introduction. The prophet as prophet was not authorized to promulgate independent enactments or to interpet the law. The Talmud ascribed many new enactments to various prophets, but in the institution of those enactments the prophets acted in conjunction with their "courts" as was the case with rabbinic authorities. On all matters subject to deliberation, the prophet's authority was no greater than that of any scholar. In an emergency, however, the distinc tive leadership functions of the prophet came into play, and he could act alone.</page><page sequence="21">[21] REASON AND REVELATION IN MAIMONIDES 561 figure. The people heard and saw what transpired but did not comprehend it. Moses alone received the message and then con veyed it to the people.15 True and False Prophets How can we distinguish the true prophet from the impostor? Men frequently appear proclaiming certain doctrines which they claim to have derived from a divine illumination. By what criteria shall we judge the validity of such claims? Many a would-be prophet has proven to be a pretender or at best an innocent victim of his own hallucinations. Some may even "plagiarize the word of others and proclaim things which, no doubt, have been said by God, that is to say, have been the subjects of divine inspiration, but not to them." Maimonides suggests various tests by which to judge claims to prophecy. The performance of miracles is no criterion; the so-called miracles may be feats of magic. One test is the charac ter of the claimant. To earn our respectful consideration we must know him to be of a noble character and of high intellectual endowments. "We must examine the merits of the person, obtain an accurate account of his actions, and consider his character. The best test is the rejection, abstention and contempt of bodily pleasures; for this is the first condition of men and, a fortiore, of prophets." The sensuality in a pretender to prophecy is the 15 Moreh II 33, Yad, Yesode ha-Torah 8:1, 2, 3; Letter to Jews of Yemen, 2b, 3a, 4a. On the basis of textproofs from Scripture and from Rabbinic writ ings, Maimonides held that in the case of the first two commandments the people heard the sound but did not comprehend it. In the case of the following eight commandments they did not even hear the sound. But Crescas in his commentary, ad locum, rejects the view of Maimonides as untenable, and insists that the people heard all the ten commandments. Halevi who did not require intellectual perfection for prophecy saw no difficulty in the notion that all the people heard all the ten commandments. Cf. H. A. Wolfson, ibid., p. 67. The sound heard by the people without comprehension but by Moses with full comprehension was of course the "created" sound, miraculously produced for the occasion, as has been noted above. Significant is the comment of Maimonides at the close of his discussion concerning the Sinaitjc revelation: "The truth of that conception and how the matter really transpired is very deeply hidden from us, for there has never been before nor will there ever be again anything like it. Note it."</page><page sequence="22">562562 ben ziON bokser [22] means by which God "exposes false prophets to public shame, in order that those who really seek the truth may really find it, and not err or go astray." Another test is a study of the prophetic message in the light of subsequent events. The prophet is essentially a teacher of moral and religious doctrine. In its more significant form his message is a clue to the future. When the future vindicates his predictions, we have a confirmation of his prophetic status; when the future fails to vihdicate his prediction he is exposed as a false prophet. This is particularly true if the prediction con cerned favorable developments. The divine forgiveness may withhold an impending doom foreseen by the prophet; and when history does not precipitate an expected disaster, the prophet's truth may not be impugned. But nothing can explain away a prophet's false optimism. The false optimists of history who have spoken with prophetic pretensions are impostors or madmen; they are not true prophets. Another test is an objective examination of the contents of the message proclaimed by the would-be prophet. His message must not contradict what has been established by reason. If, for instance, a claimant to prophecy would sanction any form of idol worship, we do not even examine any "signs" he might have to offer in confirmation of his mission; we know he speaks falsehood. "The mind that contradicts his testimony is more reliable than the eye that beholds his signs. For it has been demonstrated by rational proof by philosophers that one must not revere or worship except Him Who is the source of all exist ing things and in Whom is joined every type of perfection." The claimant to prophecy must also conform to what is ordained in the dispensation preceding him. He speaks false hood if he calls for any breaks with the prescriptions of Scripture. A prophet may call for temporary adjustments in traditional law, if circumstances warrant it. But he must not call for its for mal modification. Since the Mosaic revelation is the highest manifestation of prophecy, any departure from it would repre sent a deterioration, and God would surely not authorize it.16 16 Moreh 16 Moreh 16 Moreh II 40, III 41; Yad, Yesode ha-Torah, 9, 10; Commentary Mishnah, Introduction. Cf. Moreh I 65 and II 28.</page><page sequence="23">[23] REASON AND REVELATION IN MAIMONIDES 563 The Competence of The Torah How does the Torah meet the needs which reason could not supply? Maimonides subjected the Torah to analysis to indicate its competence in every field, where operating with reason exclu sively we should have met with failure. As the fruit of prophetic illumination, the Torah represents a more penetrating, a more direct comprehension of the world as a whole. "Prophecy can teach things beyond the reach of philosophical speculation." And the most crucial of all problems in religion, the question whether the universe is created or eternal, finds its decisive answer in the Torah. The universe, the Torah proclaims un equivocally, was created by God in time. Thus all the basic reli gious beliefs which hinge on the doctrine of creation, become firmly established. This includes the beliefs in miracles, the Torah's conception of prophecy, the unique revelation of Moses, bodily resurrection, and a divine providence acting on the lives of individual human beings. The cardinal doctrines concerning God, those elemental norms of faith which underlie all religious life, are taught in the Torah categorically without argument, and their opposites are negated. Long before one becomes capable of the intricacies of the processes of reason, one can know, by following the Torah, the fundamental ideas concerning the existence, the unity, the omniscience, the omnipotence, the will and the eternity of God, and "all this is given in the form of final results." The Torah thus reaches all men, with the more indispensable truths, giving them immediate answers to those questions which could not be left pending till pure reason do her work of demonstra tion. At the same time the Torah projects the doctrines and disciplines which will secure for men the perfections antecedent to the intellectual life. Maimonides cited the vast body of specific legislation by which the Torah sought to' create a har monious order of human relations and to establish justice among men. In addition, the Torah prescribes certain truths "the belief in which is indispensable in perfecting our social relations; such is the belief that God is angry with those who disobey Him, for</page><page sequence="24">564 BEN ZION BOKSER [24] it leads to the fear and dread of disobeying Him." A morality motivated by pragmatic considerations is not the highest type of morality. When we have risen sufficiently in our development, we know to choose the good because it is good and to shun the evil because it is evil, without any interest in the rewards of this world or of the hereafter. We choose the good and shun the evil because we model our lives after the manifestations of divine providence. The quest to be godlike, to imitate His ways, is a natural, disinterested quest for a spiritually mature person, and rewards and punishments do not figure in it. But in the preliminary stages of human development the principle of retribution is an important factor in man's moral motivations, and helps in the creation of justice among men.17 The Torah, also, employs a highly effective pedagogy in presenting these truths. Its language is vivid and simple. It concretizes its ideas through profuse illustrations, in parables and metaphors. Its doctrine of God, for example, is not stated in abstract, philosophic terms, but in terms drawn from human experience, which brings it within comprehension by most men. It marshals historic personalities who lived by the beliefs and practices which comprise its recommended pattern of life and others who defied that pattern. By the example of their lives and the consequences which resulted therefrom, it exhorts obedience to its mandates and forewarns disobedience. The pedagogy of the Torah, moreover, reckons with the important truth of human nature, that we learn more effectively by doing than by discussing. Thus it ordains a series of dis ciplines built around each major religious doctrine. By the "doing" of those disciplines these doctrines are bound to register profoundly in the consciousness of people. The awareness of God and of man's duties to revere Him, for instance, are amply enforced through the elaborate practices of piety, of religious 17 " Moreh, Introduction.

The doctrine of creation finds its most competent teacher in the observance of the Sabbath.18 The Torah, once more reckoning with the truths of human nature, did not demand a sharp break with the habits of people, adapting, where necessary, old culture patterns to its own ends rather than asking that they be superseded. Thus the Torah retained the cult of animal sacrifices as a mode of worship. That cult was universally prevalent in those days when the Torah was promulgated, and it would have been too difficult for the people to emancipate themselves from it. The Torah therefore retained it, but purged it of all pagan elements. "By this divine plan it was effected that the traces of idolatry were blotted out, and the truly great principles of our faith, the existence and unity of God, were firmly established. This result was thus obtained without deterring or confusing the minds of people by the abolition of a service to which they were accus tomed and which alone was familiar to them."19 The Torah also provides a technique for disciplining our emotional natures, to train us in curbing our physical desires. This is necessary in order to counteract the tendency to consider physical enjoyment "as an object to be sought for its own sake." The Torah accomplishes this end by such prescriptions as the laws of diet and the laws governing sex life. The forbidden foods, apart from certain specific values which they have individually,, "restrain the growth of desire, the indulgence of seeking that which is pleasant and the disposition to consider the appetite for eating and drinking as the end of man's existence." The laws regulating sex life aim "to restrain as much as possible indulgence in lust, and to teach that this enjoyment is not, as foolish people think, the final cause of man's existence." 18 Moreh I 26, 46, 52, 54, 59, 61, II 29, 31, 43, III 24, 35, 43, 44, 45, 50, 57; Yad, Yesode ha-Torah 1.9-12. Prayer and the various other religious rites are a means of intellectual perfection in that they teach important re ligious doctrines. But they may also help those who have attained intellectual perfection to concentrate on God and to avoid the distractions of the world. Thus they are a means to man's highest end, which is communion with God. 19 Moreh III 32.</page><page sequence="26">566 BEN ZION BOKSER [26] A character so disciplined has conferred upon a person a double blessing. It has made him a better citizen, a more co operative member of society, since good citizenship frequently calls for self-denial. The creation of justice in society requires that "we do not do everyone as he pleases, desires, and is able to do ; but everyone of us does that which contributes to the common welfare." Self-denial, moreover, is essential to intellectual pur suits, the domain where lies man's highest perfection. Maimonides, finally, called attention to the fact that in the elaboration of its moral disciplines, the Torah was careful not to impose undue hardships on people. It seeks to curb excesses, but it does not encourage ascetic withdrawals from life. Men of strong passions or of low moral inclination have found the way of life ordained in the Torah too hard. But they are not competent to judge. "We must not consider the law easy or hard as it appears to any wicked, low-minded, and immoral person, but as it appears to the judgement of the most perfect, who, according to the law, are fit to be the example for all mankind." If we thus judge the law, and see it from the perspec tive of the virtuous, we shall find it a perfect law, representing the happy medium between all objectionable extremes.20 The Torah thus meets the total needs of man. It thereby differs from systems of legislation that do not derive from prophetic inspiration. The latter concern themselves with man's physical perfection only. They endeavor to create a social order which will enable man to meet his physical needs. The Torah likewise concerns itself with the problems of the social order. But, in addition, it also tries to disseminate correct doctrines. Indeed it places the social order in its proper perspective, as the base from which men may proceed, unimpeded by material 20 Moreh I 34, II 39, III 8, 27, 33, 35, 54; Teshubot, ed. H. Freimann, section 370; Cf. B. Cohen, "The Responsum of Maimonides concerning Music," in Jewish Music Journal, II 2; Commentary, Mishnah, Eight Chap ters, ch. 4. The Maimonidean doctrine of the Golden Mean was undoubtedly influenced by Aristotle, but it had ample precedents in Rabbinic writings. Cf. S. Goldman, The Jew and the Universe, N. Y. 1936, p. 133; D. Rosin, Die Ethik des Maimonides, Breslau, 1876, p. 26, n. 1.</page><page sequence="27">[27] REASON AND revelation IN maimonides 567 wants, in accordance with the different levels of their intellectual powers, toward the acquisition of the virtues of the soul where lies man's highest perfection.21 The Scope of Reason The Torah, in other words, qualifies as a chart for the guidance of man in every area of his life. Nevertheless, the Torah is not self-sufficient. It must be complemented by the work of reason. We need the resources of reason to authenticate religious knowledge. As we mature in years and wisdom and continue to grow in our intellectual virtues we can discover increasingly the true and full meaning of what is only sketchily presented in the texts of tradition. "Scripture only teaches the chief points of those true principles which lead to the true perfection of man, and only demands in general terms faith in them. Thus Scripture teaches the existence, the unity, the omniscience, the omnipo tence, the will and the eternity of God. All this is given in the form of final results, but they cannot be understood fully and accurately except after the acquisition of many kinds of knowl edge." These many kinds of knowledge, we have already noted, includes especially the studies of mathematics, astronomy, logic and natural science. Even beliefs that appear to us self-evident require the valida tion of reason. For all kinds of sophistries frequently agitate the human scene, distorting the obvious and negating the self evident. Whether inspired by ulterior considerations or by in nocent error, the proponents of such views exert an influence over the minds of men. And unless our beliefs are reinforced by reason, we may be deflected from the most self-evident of truths. "There are many things whose existence is manifest and ob vious . . . and in fact they would require no proof if man had been left in his primitive state. Such are the existence of motion, of man's free will . . . and of the natural properties perceived by the senses . . . False notions, however, may be spread, whether Moreh II 37, 40.</page><page sequence="28">568568 ben ziON bokser [28] by a person laboring under error or by one who has some par ticular end in view, and who establishes theories contrary to the real nature of things . . . Philosophers are thus required to establish by proof things which are self-evident, and to disprove the existence of things which only exist in man's imagination." It is only when our religious beliefs have been substantiated by a careful weighing of all the evidence involved that they have been established in true certainty. For belief is only possible "after the apprehension of a thing; it consists in the conviction that the thing apprehended has its existence beyond the mind (in reality), exactly as it is conceived in the mind." The knowl edge which can form the basis of such belief cannot rest on tradition alone; it must be reinforced by the knowledge acquired through research and speculation. And thus, while "we must first learn the truths by tradition, after this we must be taught how to prove them." Intellectual perfection is attained only by those "who have succeeded in finding a proof for everything for which there is a proof and who know in matters divine the truth of everything whose truth can be known or who come near the truth of that whose truth can only be approached."" Maimonides heeded this imperative and he tried to prove the fundamentals of his religious faith. Since God as an essence is inaccessible to the human mind, our quest for religious knowl edge must necessarily proceed by drawing inferences from the nature of things. "For there is nothing else in existence but God and His works, the latter includes all existing things besides Him; we can only obtain a knowledge of Him through His works; His works give evidence of His existence, and show what must be assumed concerning Him, that is to say, what must be at tributed to Him either affirmatively or negatively." In his conception of the structure of the universe, Maimon ides followed Aristotle. He described the total universe as con sisting of three strata. The Intelligences, which are forms without matter, act upon the world of matter, to shape its character and destiny. The second stratum comprises the realm of corporeal beings which are constituted of matter and form. It comprises " Moreh I 50, 51; III 28, 51, 54.</page><page sequence="29">[29] REASON AND REVELATION IN MAIMONIDES 569 a a solid globe containing nine spheres, one within the other. Like the Intelligences, the spheres are indestructible. The third stratum consists of transient beings such as the bodies of men, animals, plants and minerals, which persist for a time and then decompose. The last of the Intelligences which is closest to and acts upon our own earth, is the Active Intellect. The ruling power in creation "emanates from the Creator and is re ceived by the Intelligences according to their order; from the Intelligences part of the good and the light bestowed upon them is communicated to the spheres, and the latter being in possession of the abundance obtained from the Intelligences, transmit forces and properties unto the beings of this transient world." Maimonides was fully aware that this theory involved "as sertions which cannot be proved." But he accepted it as did other Aristotelians because it seemed plausible. On the one hand no ready refutations could be brought against it, and it did bring system and order into the phenomena of the universe. He found it "the least open to doubt" and "more systematic than any other" theory.ננ In his proof for the existence of God, Maimonides also leaned heavily on Aristotle. The method of the Mutakallemim had been to infer the existence of God from the doctrine of creation, and they therefore concentrated on establishing a proof for creation. Maimonides showed that their arguments were open to grave objections. He conceded that once we assume creation, the existence of a Creator would necessarily be implied. But it was impossible to prove creation with any certainty, and it was therefore hazardous to have the proof for the existence of God hinge on a doctrine which could not be demonstrated conclu lively. The preferable method, as he saw it, was to follow Aristotle and deduct the existence of God from the nature of the universe as it is, without reference to the question as to its origin. For even in an eternal universe, the phenomena of existence in all their motions, pre-suppose an unmoved mover as their initiating cause. And this prime mover, to generate the. " Yad, Yesode ha-Torah 2.3; Moreh I 34, II 3, 11.</page><page sequence="30">570 BEN ZION BOKSER [30] eternal motions in the universe, would have to be an absolute Being, not subject to actions from causes beyond Himself, which would thus also make Him incorporeal and unitary.24 Creation cannot be proven, but Maimonides sought to show that it was at least as plausible as the doctrine of eternity. What were the objections of the eternalists to the doctrine of creation? Essentially they pointed to the experiential world where all production requires pre-existent materials. The doc trine of creation, they also argued, would involve God in a period of inactivity when He was only a potential rather than an actual agent, which is impossible. For all potentialities involve an agent in changes, and bring him into dependence on an ex ternal cause to effect the change from the potential to the actual. All this, explained Maimonides, rests on a fallacious analogy. It assumes that the character of the production process within an existent universe must necessarily parallel the process by which the universe initially came into being, which does not follow. Similarly the assertion that for God to have commenced creation in time would make Him a potential agent, subject to change and dependent on external causes, is a deduction based on an analogy between man and God. But what is true in the one case need not be true in the other, as God and man are two totally dissimilar realms of being. Maimonides, in addition, had positive arguments against the Aristotelians. The universe, as Maimonides understood the Aristotelian position, was the result of a divine emanation. It was was eternal because the process of emanation had gone on eternally. But emanation was a natural process and therefore subject to the laws of natural causality. Operating by necessity, how could the material world emanate from God Who is form without matter? In every process of natural causation there must be "some relation between cause and effect... A form cannot emanate from matter, nor matter from form." The fact 24 Yad, Yesode ba-Torah, 1.1-8; Moreh I 72, II Introduction, x, 2, 12, 13, III 17; Letter to R. Hisdai ha-Levi, Kobetz, 23a f.; Letter to Jews of Mar seilles, ibid., 25b. According to the fourth and fifth propositions in the Moreh II, Introduction, the term motion is applied "in a general sense to all kinds of change, including every transition from potentiality to actuality."</page><page sequence="31">[31] REASON AND REVELATION IN MAIMONIDES 571 that the material world emanated not directly from God, but from the Intelligences, does not resolve this difficulty. For is not the Intelligence immaterial and how could the very first level of material existence, the sphere, derive from it? The Intelligence, moreover, as a simple element, could not beget the sphere which, in the Aristotelian system, includes, in addi tion to itself, a star. "According to the laws of nature, the compound can only emanate from a compound." It would thus be impossible, on the basis of natural causality, to account for the variety of the spheres and stars, their number, their diverse positions and motions. It had been proposed that we regard this process of emanation as proceeding not by necessity but by the free will of God. Once we assume freedom in God, all things become possible. For an agent acting "with design and will and not merely by the force of the laws of nature, can produce different objects." But, argued Maimonides, volitional emanation cannot be an eternal process. "The true essence of the will of a being is simply the faculty of conceiving a desire at one time and not conceiving it at another." It might be maintained that this characterization is true only of the human will, that the divine will might act eternally, without changing the desires it conceives. But then the will is not really operating freely. "For it is the same thing, whether we say in accordance with the view of Aristotle, that the universe is the result of the Prime Cause, and must be eternal as the cause is eternal, or in accordance with these philosophers that the universe is the result of the act, design, will, selection and determination of God, but it has always been so, and will always be so . . ." The introduction of free will in the source from which the universe derives, will therefore help rationalize existence only if we assume that the process commenced in time and was enacted without the use of pre-existent materials.25 2s Moreh II 12-29, III 13; Commentary on Mishnah, Eight Chapters ch. 8; Letter to R. Hisdai ha-Levi and Marseilles Jewry, ibid. In Moreh III 13 Maimonides appears to infer creation from Aristotle's views concerning the teleology of all things within the sublunary world, which is strange since he generally held that the sublunary world could readily be explained in terms of the workings of natural causality. Maimonides apparently pre</page><page sequence="32">572 BEN ZION BOKSER [32] The clarifying resources of reason are likewise needed to authenticate the nature of tradition itself. The very texts in which tradition is preserved require careful scrutiny to free them from scribal errors which occasionally introduce corrupt and distorted readings. Even where the reading is authentic, it does not ipso facto become a valid element of our faith. For surely not every utterance by ancient teachers can be regarded as part of the authentic religious tradition, to be held authoritative by posterity. Some of these utterances were not derived from the prophetic revelation but were part of the cultural background of the teacher who pronounced them, or the result of his own intellectual labors; and they have no more validity than was inherent in current knowledge or in the rigor of his thinking. Thus we must "not expect that everything our sages say respect ing astronomical matters should agree with observation, for mathematics was not fully developed in those days; and their statements were not based on the authority of the prophets, but on the knowledge which they themselves possessed or de rived from contemporary men of science." The prophet's distinctive competence enables him to speak with authority on matters where, in the nature of things, proof is impossible. But where proof is possible, even the prophet is bound by that proof. He cannot negate what rational demonstra tion establishes unequivocally. And because they clashed with the dictates of reason, Maimonides rejected such popular beliefs as astral determinism, demonology and the various practices of magic. He was undaunted by the fact that some of these beliefs were shared by the highest authorities in the Talmud. supposes here the previously established argument concerning the character of the spheres, and their motions. Since these deviate from the workings of teleology, showing no useful purpose and eluding all explanations in terms of natural causality, we must assume creation. See H. A. Wolfson, "Hallevi and Maimonides on Design, Chance, and Necessity," in Proceedings, American Academy for Academy for Jewish Research, XI, 1941, p. 154. Dr. Wolfson has traced the theory concerning a volitional emanation proceeding eternally to Ibn Gabirol, FonsFons Vitae I 7. See H. A.

"In matters of a speculative nature," he declared, "everyone acts according to the results of his own study and accepts that which appears to him to be established by proof." Our religious tradi tion thus requires constant scrutiny to free it of non-authentic elements. This scrutiny is of course an enterprise of reason.26 We likewise need the resources of reason to establish the objectives of Scriptural laws. The significance of some (the "judgments") is explicit enough and no special interpretations are necessary to show their relation to the general purposes of the Torah. But there is a class of laws (the "ordinances") whose object does not seem clear, as the prohibition of enjoying the fruit of a tree in its first three years or of a vineyard in which diverse seeds have grown (Lev. 19.23 and Deut. 22.9). There were, of course, some who did not seek an object in the Scriptural laws. It was enough that God ordained them. It was ours to obey without probing into the reasons why. Maimonides rejected this view as altogether untenable. The Torah, according to the divine promise, is due to win the acclaim of the whole world for the wisdom and understanding which it embodies. But what wisdom and what understanding would it embody if its mandates were arbitrary and devoid of rationality? Moreover, God's acts would surely be no less perfect than man's acts. Man invariably seeks some object in what he does; and how can we assume that God would issue commands which have no object in view? As Maimonides saw it, all the commandments were designed to achieve specific benefits in human life. "Every one of the six hundred and thirteen precepts serves to inculcate some truth, to remove some erroneous opinion, to establish proper relations in society, to diminish evil, to train us in good manners, or to warn us against bad habits." Where the usefulness of a com mandment is not readily apparent, we shall find it if we probe 26 Moreh I 48, 71, II 8; Yad, Yesode ha-Torah 7.2, Ishut 1.13, Malvah ve-Loveh 15.2; Letter to Marseilles Jewry, Kobetz 25a; Commentary, Mish nah, Introd.; Erubin 4.1, Gittin 8.1.

Thus in the case of the "ordinances," we shall find their rationality when we study them in their his torical setting. Those practices and many others like them had been employed in various magic rites associated with ancient agriculture. The Torah prohibited them as part of its general struggle against ancient idolatry and superstition. The study of ancient culture, which is an effort of reason, therefore, becomes an aid in establishing the rationality of the laws in the Torah.27 Finally we require the resources of reason to interpret the texts of prophecy. For the language of prophecy had to be adapted to a highly specialized task. On the one hand it had to convey the basic truths of religion to all people, including the uncultured multitudes. The full truth the}' were incapable of apprehending. And it was indeed necessary to veil the full truth from them lest they suffer confusion under its impact. What they required was a simplified version of the truth, adapted to their level of comprehension. But simplification was not to be falsification. And it was no less important to speak the full truth to those who had advanced in their intellectual development and were capable of apprehending it. יג Sefer ha-Milzvot, Principle 9, Moreh III 26, 29, 30, 31, 34, 35, 37, 39, 50; Letter to R. Hisdai ha-Levi, 23b. This shows the keen appreciation of Maimonides for the study of history. It has been maintained that Maimonides deprecated history because in his Commentary on Mishnah Abot I, end, he brands as idle talk "the tales of most people on what transpired and what was and what the customs of that king are in his palace, and how that one died, or another became wealthy." But this is not history; it is idle gossip and Mai monides correctly brands it as such. In Moreh III 26 Maimonides admitted that within the general scope of the commandments which are rational there might be non-rational elements. Thus while we may find a good reason for animal sacrifice, "we cannot say why one offering should be a lamb, whilst another is a ram; and why a fixed number of them should be brought . . . It is almost similar to the nature of a thing which can receive different forms, but actually receives one of them. We must not ask why this form and not another which is likewise possible, because we should have to ask the same question if instead of its actual form the thing had any of the other possible forms." Cf. Aristotle, Nicomachean Ethics, V 7. In Moreh III 34, he likewise admitted that the utility of the commandments might not appear in excep tional individuals, even as in the case with the utility of the laws of nature; they are both addressed to the normal man.</page><page sequence="35">[35] REASON AND REVELATION IN MAIMONIDES 575 The prophets met their task by developing what is the dis tinctive literary style of Scripture. It is a kind of double talk, revealing a little and concealing a little, a language of hints, of allegories and parables, of metaphors and homonyms. The literal meaning is addressed to the common people, while the hidden meaning, offering a more profound level of truth, is ad dressed to the chosen few who are equipped to receive it. As Maimonides put it, Scriptural language is cast in metaphors "in order that the uneducated may comprehend it according to the measure of their faculties and the feebleness of their appre hension, while educated persons may take it in a different sense." The literal reading of the Biblical text would often bypass many invaluable doctrines of our faith. Frequently, moreover, it would even lead us to absurd errors. Thus we have noted that the Torah speaks of God in anthropomorphic terms. It asserts that man is made in the divine image. It describes God as speak ing to prophets, or as walking, seeing, working, resting, sitting, writing, hearing. Taken literally these assertions would involve us in the blasphemy of conceiving God as corporeal and finite. The Torah likewise includes many literary exaggerations which seem fantastic and clearly impossible unless we take them as figures of speech. The Torah similarly attributes emotions to God. It de scribes Him as being pleased with the righteous and indignant with the wicked. Emotions describe changes which transpire in an essence and they are clearly inapplicable to God Who is not subject to change. These expressions, too, are employed for pedagogic reasons. They concretize the qualities of divine provi dence, which manifests itself in the universal law of retribution, and, thereby, create incentives for obedience to the laws of righteousness. Acts of reward and punishment when performed by human beings are associated with certain emotions, and metaphorically these emotions are ascribed to God. "When ever any of His actions is perceived by us, we ascribe to God that emotion which is the source of the act when performed by ourselves, and call Him by an epithet which is formed of the verb expressing the emotion." And the same applies to various allegories, literary exag</page><page sequence="36">576 BEN ZION BOKSER [36] gerations or hyperbolic statements in prophetic literature. Thus nobody doubts that "May the Lord open to thee His good treasures, the Heavens" must be taken figuratively; "for God has no treasure in which He keeps the rain. The same is the case with the following passage — 'He opened the doors of heaven, He rained upon them manna to eat' (Ps. 78.23, 24). No person assumes that there is a door or a gate in heaven, but everyone understands that this is a simile and a figurative expression. In the same way must be understood the following passage—'The Heavens were opened' (Ezek. 1.1); 'If not, blot me out from Thy book which Thou hast written' (Ex. 32.32) ; 'I will blot him out from the book of life' (ibid. 33). All these phrases are figurative; and we must not assume that God has a book in which He writes, or from which He blots out, as those generally believe who do not find figurative speech in these passages." There is another peculiarity in the idiom of prophetic writings which reason will clarify, and that is the tendency of the prophets to trace the cause for all events to God. This notion seems in conflict with our experience which shows events as transpiring through more direct causes, "whether these causes consist in substance, physical properties, free will, or chance — by free will, I mean that of man —- or even in the will of another living being." But there is no real conflict. The prophets simply omit the intermediate causes and reckon with the ultimate Cause, Who is the cause behind all intermediate causes. Since God is the source of all intermediate causation, "it can consequently be said of everything which is produced by any of these causes that God commanded that it should be made, or said that it should be so . . ." Many people took Scriptural expresssions literally, identifying religion with doctrines that were intellectually untenable. It was above all to the emancipation of Scripture from this literalism that Maimonides dedicated his Guide: "This work seeks to ex plain obscure figures which occur in the prophets and are not distinctly characterized as being figures. Ignorant and superficial readers take them in a literal, not in a figurative sense. Even well-informed persons are bewildered if they understand these</page><page sequence="37">[37] REASON AND revelation IN maimonides 577 passages in their literal signification, but they are entirely relieved of their perplexity when we explain the figure, or merely suggest that the terms are figurative. For this reason I have called this book Guide to the Perplexed The use of figurative language in Scripture complicates its interpretation, but the prophets had no acceptable alternative. "If we were to teach in these disciplines, without the use of parables and figures, we should be compelled to resort to ex pressions both profound and transcendental, and by no means more intelligible than metaphors and similes." It therefore becomes a task of reason to define the true meaning behind each metaphor. And one of the impressive contributions of the Maimonidean classic is the formulation of the norms by which such expressions in Scripture may be correctly interpreted as well as the application of these norms to a multitude of specific cases, among them the most baffling in the whole range of Scripture study. Thus it takes reason to clarify what the true teachings of the Torah really are. In the words of Maimonides: "Employ your reason, and you will be able to discern what is said allé gorically, figuratively, or hyperbolically, and what is meant literally, exactly according to the original meaning of the words. You will then understand all prophecies, learn and retain rational principles of faith, pleasing in the eyes of God Who is most pleased with truth, and most displeased with falsehood; your mind and heart will not be so perplexed as to believe or accept as law what is untrue or improbable, whilst the Law is perfectly true when properly understood . . ."28 The Torah Sanctions the Use of Reason In his consideration of the place of reason in man's quest for truth, Maimonides was aware of Scriptural admonitions against it. In Scripture and particularly in the Talmud there are pas sages which clearly forewarn speculation as injurious to the 8־ Moreh, Introduction, I 26, 46, 52, 54, 59, 61, II 29, 30, 40, 47, 48, III Introduction, 1-8 25, 41; Yad, Yesode ha-Torah 1.9-12; Commentary on Mishnah, Introduction; Letter to Yemenite Jews, p. 2a.</page><page sequence="38">578 BEN ZION BOKSER [38] religious life. In the dominant piety of his day, those passages were taken as decisive, and those who gave themselves to specu lative studies, to science and philosophy, had earned considerable disapproval from the religious authorities. Those passages, Maimonides explained, do not propose "to close the gates of investigation entirely, and to prevent the mind from comprehending what is within its reach." They are directed against possible abuses in the pursuit of such studies. They are directed against people entering speculative pursuits without being adequately prepared for the rigorous processes of reason. They are likewise directed against pre-occupations with questions which are outside the competence of reason. We cannot answer such questions as what is the nature of the planetary worlds; why did God create the universe at a particular time rather than at another; why did He choose to give existence the spe cific form which He chose to give it; what is the nature of the "action" by which God sustains the universe; what is the divine "essence." Such questions are outside the scope of reason to deal with. For all we can know is the empirical world. God gave man "power to know the things which are under the heavens; here is man's world, here is his home, into which he has been placed, and of which he is himself a portion. It is in fact ignorance or a kind of madness to weary our minds with finding out things which are beyond our reach. We must content our selves with that which is within our reach." It is not only pointless to delve into matters which in the nature of things are outside the reach of our reason. It is bound to produce confusion and doubt and to deflect us from our true course. As the eye will be weakened in the perception of normal phenomena after it has wearied itself with attempting to see what is outside the range of its normal vision, so will the mind. "If a person studies too much and exhausts his reflective powers, he will be confused, and will not be able to comprehend even that which had been within the power of his apprehension." Within the sphere where it can operate fruitfully, on the other hand, the pursuits of reason are not only permissible, but mandatory. The duty to engage in such studies is included in the command to love God. Such love hinges upon a knowledge</page><page sequence="39">[39] REASON AND REVELATION IN MAIMONIDES 579 of His will and of His providential wisdom as manifest in creation. Love cannot be assumed at will; it comes as a by-product of comprehension. The command to love God, therefore, calls upon us "to contemplate His commandments and His utterances and His works till we comprehend Him and feel utmost delight in our comprehension of Him and this is the love concerning which we are obligated."29 Maimonides was anxious to establish that in his acknowl edgement of a wide area of authority for reason in religion he was not really an innovator, that he was not really bringing an alien element into his faith. He pointed to a Talmudic admission that on some problem in astronomy the pagan thinkers had shown greater competence than the sages of Israel, who there upon "abandoned their own theory in favor of the theory of others." He tried to show that many of the scientific teachings of Aristotle were not only compatible with the Torah, but were actually to be found therein, upon a careful reading of the Scriptural text. The Aristotelian doctrine of the Intelligences, for example, was nothing but another name for the Torah's teaching concerning angels. The Aristotelian characterization of the Intelligences parallels fully the characterization of angels in Scriptural and rabbinic sources. And he therefore felt justified in concluding: "When we assert that Scripture teaches that God rules the world through angels, we mean such angels as are identical with Intelligences." Various other doctrines in the Aristotelian system were to be found in Scripture. The creation account in Genesis and Ezekiel's visions of God, interpreted in a symbolic and allegori " Moreh I 32, 58, 70, 72; II 24, 25, III 1-7, 12, 13, 25, 28, 51, 52; Yad, Yesode ha-Torah, 2.1-2; Meila 8.8; Sefer ha-Mitzvot, Positive Command ments, 3; Negative Commandments, 47; Yad, Akum 2.3, Essay on the Resurrection, 10a. The teleology of creation is evident in the Torah no less than in nature. In Sefer ha-Mitzvot, Negative Commandments, 47, Maimonides regards the pre-occupation with speculations concerning matter beyond the competence of reason as a violation of Scriptural law. Cf. Abraham ibn Daud ha-Emunahha-Emunah ha-Ramah, Berlin, 1919, p. 100 who says explicitly, "It is impos sible that a person shall love anything with an intense love without knowing it," thus explaining why the commandment to love God must include the duty to pursue philosophical studies.</page><page sequence="40">580 BEN ZION BOKSER [40] cal meaning as intended, offer us respectively all the vital teach ings in natural science and metaphysics. These teachings were not stated explicitly because they were judged beyond the com prehensive powers of the common people. He likewise found support for his views concerning the meta phoric character of Scriptural anthropomorphisms. He pointed to the well-known rabbinic statement: "The Torah speaketh the language of man." There was a Midrash (Bereshit Rabbah ch. 27) which stated this truth even more explicitly. Comment ing on Ezekiel's portrayal of God in the image of a man (ch. 1.26), the Midrash asserts: "Great was the power of the prophets; they compared the creature to its creator." "Our sages have thus stated in plain terms that they are far from believing in the corporeality of God; and in the figures and forms, seen in a prophetic vision, though belonging to created beings, the proph ets, to use the words of our sages 'compared the creature to its creator'." Thus we have a clear recognition that in their anthro pomorphisms the prophets spoke of God by means of analogies borrowed from human experience, a device intended to make God more comprehensible to the common man. Considering the traditional recognition for the role of reason in religion, why was there such paucity of philosophic and scientific material in traditional Jewish literature? And why was there such distrust for the work of reason among contemporary religious leaders in Israel? Maimonides felt called upon to deal with these questions. In part, Maimonides suggested, this was due to the fact that such studies were not carried on publicly. They were confined to the select few who had the necessary prerequisite education, and they transmitted their findings orally, without reducing them to writing. Moreover, the conditions of living under foreign domina tion produced a cultural decadence among Jews, with the result that such studies were neglected and what had been achieved in the past was gradually forgotten. It was this cultural decadence, too, which produced the wide spread distrust of reason in contemporary Judaism. Living among people whose religion is hostile to reason, Jews tended to do likewise, forgetting that this is a departure from the</page><page sequence="41">[41] REASON AND REVELATION IN MAIMONIDES 581 authentic character of Jewish tradition. "We are mixed up with other nations; we have learnt their opinions, and followed their ways and acts . . . Having been brought up among persons un trained in philosophy, we are inclined to consider these philo sophical opinions as foreign to our religion, just as uneducated persons find them foreign to their own notions. But, in fact, it is not so."30 Reason and Revelation Thus we must fashion the edifice of our religion with the tools of both reason and revelation. There is an absolute and a relative need for the Torah, in addition to reason. Reason's competence is confined to questions relating to what may loosely be called the sublunary world. It cannot answer yes or no on the most momentous question, whether the universe is created or eternal. For this we are dependent on the Torah. The relative need for Torah derives from several considerations. Life is too short to enable us to reach the basic truths of religion through inde pendent inquiry. The intelligence of the common people is alto gether unsuited to undertake successfully the study of meta physics. The Torah employs a pedagogy which gradually leads men to the comprehensions of vital truths, in accordance with the possibilities of their natures and the state of their cultural development. The Torah, finally, does more than convey correct doctrines. It projects a law that makes possible the creation of a a just society, within which man's physical needs can be met, in addition to taking care of man's spiritual and intellectual welfare. The need for reason is no less important, though it is largely a relative need. We are dependent upon reason to prove our 30 Moreh, Introduction, I 26, 46, 71, II 6, 8, II, III Introduction, 1-7. In one sense the Guide was thus an attempt to reveal the secrets of the Law, what Scripture had intended to be veiled from the general public. To avoid the transgression he composed his work in the form of a letter to an individual, who, being duly prepared for it, was entitled to have the matter expounded to him. He also employed a method of hints rather than of explicit statement which would keep his ideas more or less obscure to an ill-prepared reader who might come upon his work. For this entire subject cf. Leo Strauss, "The Literary Character of the Guide," pp. 37-91.</page><page sequence="42">[42] 582 BEN ZION BOKSER religious doctrines to the extent that they can be proven, and to round them out in all their implications. Reason must stand guard against the accretion to our religious faith of false and superstitious beliefs. And reason must interpret the literary texts in which revelation expresses itself. And thus does the conflict between philosophy and the Torah resolve itself. To the extent that each teaches an authentic doctrine there is no conflict between them. For the capacity to reason and the prophetic illumination both derive ultimately from God and they must consequently harmonize. Truth, in other words, has an inner coherence and it cannot be in conflict with itself. Conflict arises when men distort the teaching of Scripture or when they carry their philosophies beyond the essential conclusions which flow from the processes of reason. Employed in their respective fields of competence, however, reason and revelation prove to be allies instead of adversaries. And when a person steers himself by means of both, he will reach his true end, living in constant communion with God, which is the supreme bliss in human existence. The Maimonidean Solution Maimonides did not originate a philosophical system. Indeed, he looked upon himself as an adversary, a critic of philosophy. Nevertheless, because Maimonides leaned on the teachings of Aristotle for the explanations of the natural order, and showed such marked respect for his views, it has been asserted that Maimonides was an Aristotelian, that he had to make Greek philosophy rather than the Torah the supreme interest of the religious life. Ahad ha-Am has even gone to the extent of declar ing that the Maimonidean theology teaches the very supremacy of reason. Our investigation fails to bear out this judgment. We have already noted that in all the crucial issues where philosophy and the Torah clashed he upheld the Torah. In vindicating the doctrine of a created universe, he held on to the conception of a God Who is above necessity, a God Who can inject Himself into the flow of events to produce miracles, to illumine the prophets, to cause the unique revelation of the</page><page sequence="43">[43] REASON AND REVELATION IN MAIMONIDES 583 Torah, and to exercise His providence over individual human beings. And it is clear too that in taking his stand Maimonides was not merely concerned with appeasing the Orthodox. On some of these issues, he had alternatives, with ample support in traditional Jewish sources, which would have brought him closer to philosophy. He could have followed the Platonic doc trine of the origin of the universe, introducing an eternal matter as the stuff out of which the universe was fashioned. This doctrine he held reconcilable with the teachings of Scripture, and he called attention to such a view in the Pirke de R. ElizerP On the question of miracles, he could have followed the Talmudic interpretation which asserted that miracles, instead of inter rupting the necessities of nature, had really been included in those necessities at the very time of creation. Indeed, he could have explained away miracles altogether by allegorizing their meaning as had been done by a school of Moslem theologians before him, the Batenis. Instead, he chose, in all those instances, a thorough going repudiation of philosophy in favor of the ex plicit doctrines of the Torah. Moreover, Maimonides makes it clear that he never sought to teach philosophy as such, that his occasional discussions of problems in philosophy were, incidental to another and, for him, a more basic task — the defense of the Torah. "It was not my intention when writing this treatise," he explains in a re vealing note to the Guide to the Perplexed, "to expound natural science or discuss metaphysical sytems . . . where you there fore notice that I prove the existence and number of Intelligences or the number of the spheres, with the causes of their motion or discuss the true relation of matter and form, the meaning of divine manifestations, or similar subjects, you must not think that I intend to establish a certain philosophical proposition . . . I only desire to mention what might, when well understood, serve as a means of removing some of the doubts concerning anything taught in Scripture . . ."32 The Maimonidean accommodation between reason and reve lation should be of more than historical interest to us. The phi 3J Moreh II 13, 25, 26. 2י Moreh 112.</page><page sequence="44">[44] 584 BEN ZION BOKSER losophy and science with which we must reckon in our religious life is radically different from the Aristotelian system. And we might not be inclined to read our scientific hypotheses into the texts of Scripture. But the challenge which faces us is essentially similar. Can we by reason alone comprehend all the realities about us? Is the universe, such as our scientific conceptions por tray it, an impersonal, eternal enterprise, knowing no more than the necessities of nature, and being wholly bound by those necessities? In such a universe there would of course be no room for a unique revelation such as is embodied in the Torah, and we would be denied the assurance of any significant realizations in the drama of human life. For in such a universe even God would be a helpless participant in a process over which He can exercise no initiative, a process that was endlessly repeating itself without seeking any wise or beneficent purpose. When men will seek an answer to these questions which will not rob life of its dignity and its hope, they will follow in the footsteps of Moses Maimonides.</page></plain_text>
