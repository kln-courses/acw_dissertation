<plain_text><page sequence="1">Atget and Man Ray in the Context of Surrealism JOHN FULLER Both in their lives and in their productions, the Frenchman Jean Eugene Auguste Atget and the American Man Ray are at poles, for one lived a nearly anonymous existence and prac- ticed straight photography, while the other enjoyed fame and pursued experimental imagery with and without camera. At- get's avowed objective was to produce only documents, while Man Ray deliberately sought something beyond the type of representation associated with the photographic process. Yet, Man Ray collected Atget photographs and got several of them published in La Revolution Surr6aliste, the first official review of the Surrealists. Atget, whom Ray described as "almost naive, like a Sunday painter," told him, "Don't put my name on it," referring to one of the photographs for publication.' Atget's strange wish for anonymity-a virtue from the standpoint of Surrealism- kept him essentially unknown except to artists, theater peo- ple, and others who purchased his photographs for docu- ments, but after his death, largely through the efforts of Man Ray's former assistant, Berenice Abbott, he has achieved a position that rivals, if not surpasses, that of Ray as a photog- rapher. Man Ray has been thought of as an "experimenter" and, therefore, somewhat outside the mainstream of early 20th-century fine art photography, but today he appears a forerunner of much of the current photography that by- passes the tradition fostered by Stieglitz. Man Ray, a neighbor of Atget on the rue Campagne-Pre- miere in the 1920s, takes credit for discovering him and describes his contact printing process by daylight from glass plates 18 x 24 cm. Ray claims the prints were like proofs which faded, since Atget fixed them in salt water.2 Abbott, however, talks of Atget's fine quality prints on "printing out" paper, probably gold chloride,3 which gave richer tones than the bromide papers Ray urged Atget to adopt. Ray found most of his thousands of prints uninteresting, but acquired 30 or 40 which he later gave to the George Eastman House Collection. He says, "They're the ones that have been the most reproduced, because they have a little Dada or Surreal- ist quality about them."4 Leroy and Abbott have likened Atget to a "Douanier" Rousseau and a Balzac, but Ray is much more reserved, saying, I don't want to make any mystery out of Atget at all. He was a simple man and he was using the material that was available to him when he started around 1900. An old rickety camera with a brass lens on it and a cap. He'd just take the cap off and put it back.5 World War I slowed the demand for Atget's work, and by June 15, 1925, when La Revolution Surrealiste published his photograph of a circus wagon showing a muscle man sticking his bald head between the pried-open jaws of an alligator, this some-time painter and third-role actor was a sick old man with little money. The following year this Surrealist review published photographs of a corset shop, Versailles (a prosti- tute), and a crowd watching an eclipse, but it was also the year his wife died. Leroy tells of Atget's mind wandering, his drinking, and finally his death at 70 years of age on August 4, 1927.6 Photography was a good source of income for Man Ray, who photographed works of art, artists, celebrities, and fash- ion models. His photographs, often given away to fellow artists and writers, commanded high prices from editors, and his camera gave him entree into the rarefied Parisian art- literature-social world. Commercial photography permitted him to paint and to live stylishly, though he could admit, "But I had already compromised myself with my photography in spite of some efforts to pull it out of the bread-and-butter or cheesecake limits."7 These efforts beyond the hack work included the photograms he called Rayograms and "solariza- tions," although certainly his unusual lighting effects and posing of subjects raised much of his commercial work above the routine. His photography, credited or not, appeared throughout La ART JOURNAL, XXXVI/2 130</page><page sequence="2">Fig. 2. Eugene Atget, Austrian Embassy, 57 Rue de Varenne, n.d. All the Atget photographs are reproduced courtesy of The Museum of Modern Art, Abbott-Levy Collection; partial gifts of Shirley C. Burden. Fig. 1. Man Ray, Self-Portrait. Revolution Surrealiste, and in the later review, Le Surrealism au Service de la Revolution, several notable photographs are reproduced full page, including a "solarized" reclining nude, Primacy of Matter Over Mind, in Number 3, December, 1931. Also in the Number 5, May, 1933 issue of this publication is his close-up photograph of buttocks around which have been drawn thin black lines to represent an inverted cross; the mixed media work is titled Monument a D.A.F. de Sade which, perhaps, reinforces the claim that the Marquis was Man Ray's hero.8 In the late 1930s and early 1940s, when the Surrealists collaborated with Albert Skira to produce the lush review Minotaure, Man Ray's work was frequently featured, including portfolios such as Aurore des Objects, in Number 10, 1937. By this time other photographers relatable to Surre- alism were frequently included in Minotaure, such as Raoul Ubac, who explored "solarization" and photo-collage, and Brassai, who provided a night-time view of Paris. Such recog- nition given photography among the arts was rare for that period, a time when Stieglitz in America was still fighting the cause of photography as art. Man Ray did make some attempts at street photography; the George Eastman House Collection has two of his street scenes, printed soft on bromide paper about 11 x 14 inches. One shows a rainy street lined with autos and a man semi- silhouetted in the extreme right foreground looking toward the Vendome Column, which is positioned at the extreme upper left. Sunlight barely penetrating the clouds gives a soft WINTER 1976/77 backlighting which makes water bubbles on the street spar- kle. The other untitled street scene seems to have been timed to record a somewhat triangular composition of three figures walking. Both works, however, suggest the type of efforts that serious amateurs in the 1930s and 1940s submitted to camera club salons, and it is by such images in comparison that we can measure the strength of Atget's vision. Man Ray, then, is a studio photographer, a manipulator of lights, people, objects, and photographic materials, rather than a photographer who discovers fragments of reality on the street and transposes them into visual experiences that go beyond mere recording. There is also a close interaction with the other media in which Ray worked, and he wrote, "... I photographed as I painted, transforming the subject as a painter would, idealizing or deforming as freely as does a painter."9 In regard to painting and photography he claimed, There was no conflict between the two-why couldn't people accept the idea that one might engage in two activities in his lifetime, alternately or simultaneously? ... I had declared flatly that photography is not art, publishing a pamphlet with this statement as the title, to the dismay and reprobation of photogra- phers. When asked more recently if I still held to my opinion, I declared that I had revised my attitude somewhat: for me art is not photography.10 This revised statement makes photography more compati- ble with Surrealist thought which opposed Art on the grounds that Art was too dependent on acquired technique. Artists had long vilified photography because it did not re- quire the skill of the hand and was merely mechanical. Man Ray said, " . . . photography, after all, is nine tenths mechan- ics and requires closer calculation than to paint and the result is more 'retinean,' as Duchamp would say."1 This mechani- cal element does not seem necessarily detrimental from a Surrealist standpoint, and it would appear to be equatable with "automatic writing," so that the photographer could, if 131</page><page sequence="3">inspired, function more as a medium than as a mechanic. This would seem to be supported by Max Morise writing in the first issue of La R6volution Surr6aliste: "What surrealist writing is to literature, a surrealistic plastic expression must be to painting, photography and everything which is made to be seen."12 Atget's and Ray's divergent approaches and philosophies, which seem to find a link within Surrealist theory, can be demonstrated through a Man Ray Self-Portrait (Fig. 1) and an Atget photograph, Austrian Embassy, 57 Rue de Varenne (Fig. 2), which may be considered a form of self-portraiture. Ray has used the Sabattier effect, which he calls "solarization," describing it as " . . . a process of developing by which the contours of the visage are accentuated by a black line as in a drawing."13 The alteration of tone, seemingly at random, greatly re- duces detail so that the forms are accentuated and the planes are compressed. Unlike another version, three-quarter length, this one is cropped closely so that back and top of head, as well as part of the large camera lens are bisected by the picture's edges. His face in profile close to the camera adds to the compression which is relieved by open space defining almost a rectangle in the upper left of the photo- graph and an irregular negative space of softly modulated tones below the chin. A form, presumably a finger, rests on the bottom of the lens and directs the eye to the face. Countering this claustrophobic scene without the Rem- brandtesque lighting of much portraiture, is the play of re- flection on the lens, which suggests not simply photogra- pher's floodlights but some planetary bodies orbiting in space. The cosmic-like relation of tones and shapes on the "eye" of the camera and the Sabattier effect, which demater- ializes the bellows and back of the camera and finger, are not highly controllable phenomena. Their effect is to elevate a rather standard pose for a photographer imaging himself into shapes that suggest dematerialization and spatial ambiguity. Berenice Abbott made a sensitive portrait of Atget shortly before his death, but somehow the study he made of his huge camera aimed toward a mirror-lined fireplace at the Austrian Embassy tells more about the man than any conven- tional record of his face. The ominous shroud he used for focusing seems at first to encompass the photographer, but a closer study suggests the man has stepped aside during the exposure. Amid this expansive Rococo salon the dark, simple camera and the heavy folds of drapery intrude upon a scene that emphasizes the curves, lightness, and elegance of the decor. The camera is in occult balance with a highly orna- mental clock, and while both mechanisms are involved with time, the more somber, cyclops-like machine seems more potent with myth than the clock, festooned with a cupid atop a shell-motif canopy. In a sense two cultures are juxtaposed, the 18th century with its clockwork universe still filled with frivolous putti and heads of classic gods, and the modern world with its instrument for capturing light and time. Atget photographed another mirror-lined fireplace, but he was careful to position his camera at an angle, so there is no trace of the machine. The mirror, instead, shows five chairs clothed with slipcovers and arranged as though engaged in conference. Visually present or not, Atget manages to leave his imprint on so many of his pictures that the term "docu- ment" seems an inadequate definition for such images that time and again take us to the other side of the looking-glass. Even on the Contents page of La R6volution Surrealiste for June 15, 1926, an uncredited Atget photograph of a crowd watching an eclipse has all the basic characteristics of a news photograph which quickly communicates the occasional rit- ual of viewing the sun through smoked glass. The camera is placed on the sidewalk and is aimed about eye level at the group; a curved stone railing appears on the right, and left of center is a streetlight, while office buildings are visible in the background. Yet Leroy describes this "document" as follows: "The surrealism of certain views still surprises, as in two particularly known photographs, one of a crowd at the base of the Juillet Column looking at an eclipse with smoked glass. ... "14 In line with the crowd's gaze is a darkened, curved shadow area in the upper left, which has been rather obviously dodged out in the black and white prints produced by Beren- ice Abbott as "20 Photographs by Eugene Atget, 1856-1927," in 1956. In the original print the vignetting effect of Atget's lens barrel works to advantage, for it seems to emphasize the fact that some two dozen people are looking through vir- tually opaque glass to see what will appear to be a black sun, an image which is appropriate to Surrealist sensibility. In the review the Surrealists titled this photograph Les Derniers Conversions. Man Ray makes a deceptively simple statement suggestive of universal forces, and perhaps their control, through not including people in a Rayograph of a gyroscope and magnify- ing glass against a black field (Fig. 3). The motion of the gyroscope pattern as it rides a thin white line is charted by its shadowy replica, which flaunts gravity above the dominant image, while the magnifying glass serves as a steadying force, a compass with pointer (nail) on the North-South axis. There is an important distinction between the forms in this image and those in the Atget, for the latter are produced by Fig. 3. Man Ray, Rayograph (gyroscope and magnifying glass). ART JOURNAL, XXXVI/2 132</page><page sequence="4">light rays reflected from the objects and gathered by a lens onto sensitive material, whereas with the Rayograph an opaque or translucent object has blocked light directly from exposing the sensitive paper. In this camera-less image we have a light tracing of objects, or what Alexandrian calls "the first 'nudes of objects' in the history of photography, possibly in the history of art."15 While other 20th-century photogram makers, such as Laszlo Moholy-Nagy, Christian Schad, and Francis Bruguiere, explored this camera-less imagery, this technique can be traced to early explorations of image making with light-sensi- tive substances, including those experiments of William Henry Fox Talbot (c. 1839). Ray, however, seems to be the one who has carried this process further to achieve a sense of depth and mystery through variance of tonal relationships, and with the exception of Bruguiere, the others' results seem more clinical. Thus, Alexandrian finds that in each rayography, Man Ray demonstrates that he is the scrupu- lous interpreter of the secret life of objects, the confidante of their inmost thoughts, the observer of their naive ambitions, the arbitrator of their conflicts, the witness of their platonic love affairs with the beholder.16 Alexandrian's generous response to these images certainly links them to Surrealism, but it should be recalled that Tristan Tzara saw the first results of Ray's accidental "discovery" and pronounced them pure Dada. These Rayograms led Tzara to joint experiments with Ray in this medium but while Ray created geometric forms, Tzara's imagery included broken matches and actual burnt holes in the photographic paper.17 lan Walker apparently considers all the Rayograms as Dada, for he writes, " . . . the mere physical fact that the paper is turned black provides an ironic Dadist joke; light can create nothing but darkness."'8 It seems reasonable, how- ever, to consider Tzara's nihilistic approach to photograms, along with Ray's simple, humorous, anthropomorphic Rayo- grams as Dada, while grouping Ray's more constructive fan- tasies of tonal modulation as Surrealist in spirit, even when they were created prior to the Manifesto of 1924.19 Ray's photogram of the gyroscope and glass has lost much of its original mystery through so many academic repetitions of this basically simple image-making process. An image still fresh is a Rayograph showing a cube form turned on edge, near the bottom center, so that it seems to balance a scene of shadow play above. Elongated black spots merging to form black streaks toward the top of the print suggest the spots from dice, somehow separated from their cube and moving across a cloud-covered sky, as though searchlights were pro- jecting these images to create Futuristic effects. A reading of the upper field of this print as "sky" is rein- forced by the undulating forms silhouetted against a band of white which strongly suggests city lights and the outlines of buildings at night. Ray made a sharply focused night scene of an equestrian figure and a brightly lit obelisk at the Place de la Concorde, while this photogram suggests the type of scene in which the photographer has unsuccessfully at- tempted a long, hand-held exposure. While the work func- tions as pure form, there is an underlying sense of motion, drama, and night which conveys the idea of city life. Of such images Tzara could write, "These are projections surprised in transparence, by the light of tenderness, of things that dream and talk in their sleep."20 Atget's photography could not feasibly manage the long exposures required of night photography, yet his street scenes are often "surprised in transparence." Atget positions his camera before a store window showing a chest of drawers piled with shoes, chairs, and pictures hanging in dark space. One unlit electric bulb seems to float above this balanced but unnerving scene. Atop the gaudy, rose-painted chest, there are two shoes of vastly differing sizes whose toes point toward each other. Two chairs of likewise differing scale stand above the shoes, while two pictures of varying size both show men of great and small proportion. Light reflect- ing from two other pictures is too great for the print to show detail, so they exist, except for a few traces in the original, as tabulae rasae on which the viewer might construct his own comparison. The work is titled Le Geant. Fete du Tr6ne, and in the lower left corner there is a black identification number, 86, which Atget scratched into the emulsion, so he probably intended it to be number 68.21 Although the numbers are frequently cropped in reproductions, these numbers have now lost all meaning and seem as illogical as the light bulb, which does not illuminate but only casts its shadow on the large framed picture. Man Ray also incorporated pictures within pictures in a Rayograph composed almost entirely of strips of movie film which have been bent and superimposed to give a modula- tion of tone which only hints at specific images, so that the pattern of the film sprockets dominates the picture area of the film, except where an occasional close-up of a nude can be observed (Fig. 4). Just below center left, Man Ray has placed a curled segment of film on the paper to emphasize the feeling of space. On the lower right inside of the film Fig. 4. Man Ray, Rayograph (strips of film). WINTER 1976/77 133</page><page sequence="5">Fig. 5. Eug6ne Atget, Newsstand, n.d. circle is a band of light tone which suggests the type of reflection frequently noted on a lens when a studio backdrop is used, while around this circle films seem to spin off, as though to suggest this circle is the source or gravitational center around which all the other images revolve. As a fresh image in its day, this incorporation of process and product and the destruction of images to create new ones, seems to parallel Breton's ideas of "convulsive beauty." Crime is a recurrent theme in Surrealism, and Atget's nar- row alleys are so often shown deserted that the vacuum created makes one wonder if the quiet will be interrupted by violence.22 Or, he can photograph simple street corners so they become highly charged, as in his photograph called Newsstand (Fig. 5).23 Though a mere shack on the street, such a building becomes visually interesting because of the ever- changing collage of items displayed. Atget photographs this kiosk from a slight angle concentrating on this crude struc- ture while giving hint of a park, le square Boucicaut, sur- rounded by fine buildings in the background. Behind the display of magazines and pictures there is a dark opening from which can be seen the head of a newsboy who stares at the photographer. Above and to the right of his cap hangs a magazine, "Femina," showing a smiling woman in evening dress, stage-lit and framed in an oval. The events of the day and Atget's lens-cap exposures, however, combined to make this routine scene something more than a document. On a direct diagonal from "Femina" to the boy to the lower left area of the picture is a broadsheet for Le Matin. During the exposure a breeze happened to 134 blow this one piece of freely hanging paper so that the message is blurred and illegible, except for the top headline which announces, "LE SABOTAGE A LA DYNAMITE." The purely photographic phenomenon of blurred motion and the verbal message have joined to ignite this mundane scene into drama. No fortuitous breeze or dramatic message transforms At- get's Rag-Picker, who functions as horse to his cart, as he poses to the side of a street. The rag-picker's eyes stare down and to the left of camera position, and depth of field falls off toward the back of the cart, so that buildings, trees, and other vehicles are rendered softly. The shadows of the vehi- cle and the man's legs break up the largely toneless, over- exposed road, but in no way do these shadows imply more than a simple pattern. Unlike the other Atgets considered, this is an example of the straightforward documentary photo- graph giving us knowledge of one of the menial forms of labor. Time and other images have a way of intervening, how- ever, and can cause a present viewer to add richer associa- tions to earlier images. In 1920, when Man Ray wrapped objects and titled the result L'Enigme d'lsidore Ducasse, the immediate associations were with Lautreamont's oft-quoted phrase concerning an encounter of disparate objects.24 These images, visual and verbal, then interact with a later photo- graph-like painting, La Rue F6rou (1952), showing a back view of a bent man pulling a hand cart down the narrow, wall-lined street from Man Ray's studio. The objects in the cart and the ropes holding them strongly suggest L'Enigme d'lsidore Du- casse. Juxtaposed with Atget's documentary photograph Rag- Picker, the photograph and painting enrich each other, for one tends to attach a face to the figure in the Man Ray painting and to envision something more than rags on the cart in the Atget photograph.25 Woman, Desire, and Love are recurrent themes in Surreal- ist writing and pictures. Breton in "Soluble Fish," for in- stance, writes: The aurora borealis in one's bedroom, that's one thing accom- plished; that is not all. Love shall be. We shall reduce art to its simplest expression which is love.... 26 In the country which developed the cult of the Virgin, the 14th-century image of the Queen of Heaven haughtily dis- playing her child in Notre Dame of Paris has given way to an older image of woman as the basis of the universe, the primitive conception of an Earth Goddess. Man Ray could envision woman this way-perhaps with some help from Beardsley's Venusberg in Under the Hill-in a drawing accompanying Paul Eluard's "Les Tours D'Elaine," from Les Mains Libres, where woman is not a relief decora- tion, but the embodiment and overriding spirit of a medieval fortress. Ray also made striking close-up portraits of women and achieved notoriety as a fashion photographer, entering that world of fantasy-commercialism through the design house of Paul Poiret.27 Elements of Dada and Surrealism combine to produce a forerunner of the fashion photograph, a full-page study in Minotaure, Number 5, 1934, of the exotic model in an implau- sible and potentially dangerous environment. Titled Ero- tique-Voilee, the photograph shows Meret Oppenheim pos- ART JOURNAL, XXXVI/2</page><page sequence="6">ing behind a huge printing press wheel, her left arm smeared with black ink. A thin black necklace counters the broken circle of the wheel, and her left breast is carefully suggested above the curved spoke, where shadow creates a curvilinear form on the body. To the right is the toothed outline of a gear wheel, which seems to relate this photograph to Dancer (Danger), 1920, an engraving on glass incorporating its title which also reads "Danger." Woman before Atget's camera finds a link with Surrealism in photographs of prostitutes, a commission he accepted for a documentary study of the brothels of Paris for a book on prostitution by Dignimont.28 An example is Cabaret, which shows a nearly head-on view of a facade with a woman in white stockings standing in the doorway at the left. On the second floor (premier 6tage) and slightly to the right, a woman in black leans over an iron grill railing which is flanked by open shutters. This window is balanced on the right with a closed window showing carefully arranged cur- tains draped to define an almost ogival arch; one of the shutters is missing a number of louvers which results in a black rectangular void. On the street level, courses of brick stretchers, rectangular paneling, and rough-textured glass present a neat, but closed-off setting which emphasizes fron- tality. The street pavement of square stones, viewed from the camera angle as diamond shapes, creates rows of diagonal lines which, with the slightly downward slope of the street and the diffuse lighting, leads the eye to the woman in the doorway. The catalyst which transforms these elements is the repeti- tion of number fives, one of which appears in thin dark lettering above the head of the street girl; the other number, large and shaded to give dimension, fills a wall space be- tween the two upstairs windows. In the transom windows above the entranceway two more number fives appear. Through scale and repetition these numbers no longer seem merely informational, but interact compositionally and myth- ically with the human subjects. The square glass areas on the street level and these numbers make one think of the magic number squares which fascinated medieval philosophers. One also thinks of Nadja, where Breton's female seer looks up at a window and predicts it will light up red.29 Atget's photographs of other women included rag-pickers' wives, peasants, shop girls, bronze and marble goddesses of parks, and store window mannequins. Of mannequins, J. H. Matthews in Toward the Poetics of Surrealism notes, Certain pages of Zola's, like those in Au Bonheur des Dames devoted to "apotheoses of half-dressed mannequins," anticipate the animism of the universe in metamorphosis, dear to the surre- alists. Like the latter, Zola tried to communicate his impression of the fundamental forces that rule human existence.30 The bulk of Atget's works falls between Zola, who died in 1902, and the Surrealist Manifesto of 1924. In his own way Atget, too, revealed the mannequins in ways the shopper does not detect when attracted to a store window. The glass pane becomes an imperfect mirror which suggests space behind both the camera and the mannequins, an effect com- parable to photomontage though stamped with the authority of the documentary image. The shopper's selective eye screens out a collage of signs, buildings, and trees which impose themselves on the window, whereas the camera faithfully records light and reveals these store dummies en- veloped in a cityscape. Mabille writing on the subject of mirrors in Minotaure says, "Since the mirror is susceptible of providing an image of things one sees, it may be capable also of providing entities ordinarily invisible."31 What Atget's camera does is to alter the normal planes of reality that we associate with the person standing on the pavement and the world beyond the win- dow. In Coiffeur, Avenue de I'Observatoire, Paris (Fig. 6), the blots against a light grey field read as reflections of leaves on trees and are less tangible than the plaster busts on pedes- tals, yet this record of motion implies a vitality denied the four figures. This sky area subverts the verbal message, for the key word, "Coiffeur," is practically obliterated and "Mes- sieurs" is now superimposed on the upper story of a building across the street, while "Salons" and "Dames" intermingle among leaves and patches of sky. The interior space, essentially mysterious because of the curtain and the darkness, does reveal a "baldachin"-like machine suspended above the central, seated mannequin, the only one possessing a complete body. There is no eye contact between mannequins and photographer, nor does the reflection of the camera intrude on this scene. The nor- mally plain, dark drapery acquires a scene of a well-lit pave- ment, which also tends to hover in space and "pass through" some of the mannequins, which adds to a sense of ambiguity and dematerialization. Again, Mabille suggests the type of transformation which Atget so often achieves: In effect the region of the marvelous is always located on the other side of the mirror and banished to a virtual domain. ... It is urgent to proclaim that Mystery and the Marvelous are not with- out but in the things and in the beings, and that one and another are being transformed at each moment, connected by continuous bonds.32 Man Ray also used reflections, mirrors, and glass, but in a controlled studio situation, where his effects seem more consciously endowed with psychological meanings. Using a plaster, classic head, a shaving mirror, and a photoflood reflector with bulb, he has arranged a still life similar to what will become a classroom exercise and what was, perhaps, a carry-over from de Chirico (Fig. 7). His lighting is not classic, in the photographic sense, and he crops the head tightly and adjusts the mirror at a slight angle to repeat a play of oval forms and also to reflect the head. The mirror image, show- ing edge reversal along the classic profile, reflects a different expression, almost suggesting a face other than that of the three-quarter view of the cast. The reflector is transformed by "solarization" from a light source to a dark, circular form with concentric rings of light which convey vitality to this otherwise placid grouping. With this very basic arrangement, which all but defies a creative result, Man Ray manages to make a reference to narcissism and metamorphosis, as well as to the photographic process. Through unusual cropping and lighting Ray can convert a live model into a store window mannequin (Fig. 8). A model leans her head back on a board, long hair extended its entire length. He photographs perpendicular to the face, posi- WINTER 1976/77 135</page><page sequence="7">Fig. 6. Eug6ne Atget, Coiffeur, Avenue de I'Observatoire, c. 1923. Fig. 7. Man Ray, Untitled. Fig. 8. Man Ray, Untitled. tioned near the top of the picture, on a dark background so that a sense of hovering in space is achieved. As we look directly down on the shoulders, arms appear amputated, giving further suggestion to the mannequin relationship. Inverted, the picture also suggests a ship's figurehead. Ray's lighting is never conventional, although here he does use a strong light from high on right, which casts a shadow from the nose across the cheek, a fairly basic effect. How- ever, when he presents the picture inverted, as it appeared on the ground glass, the lighting becomes more theatrical, ART JOURNAL, XXXVI/2 136</page><page sequence="8">even anti-gravitational. The film is incapable of resolving the brilliant light on the hair, and depth of field does not extend the full length of the hair. Neither of these technically imper- fect elements detracts, however, but instead creates forms suggesting the motion of water. Man Ray often spoke of Leonardo as his favorite artist, and one may see a parallel here with the waves in the da Vinci drawing, Leonardo Medi- tating on the Movement of Water (Royal Library, Windsor Castle). The closed eyes also connote death, perhaps an Ophelia image, which is a reasonable assumption, given Ray's interest in Shakespeare. Impressionism, Cubism, and Constructivism freed art from literary dependency, but the Surrealists brought word and picture together again, though in ways quite different from 19th-century anecdotal art. Photography and words have usually suggested reportage in which the photograph serves to "authenticate" and dramatize the text. The use of poems and photographs to complement each other is not the rule, though Breton wrote: The photographic print, considered in isolation, is certainly per- meated with an emotive value that makes it a supremely precious article of exchange (and when will books that are worth anything stop being illustrated with drawings and appear only with photo- graphs?); nevertheless, despite the fact that it is endowed with a special power of suggestion, it is not in the final analysis the faithful image that we aim to retain of something that will soon be gone for ever.33 In the 1930s Eluard and Ray collaborated through their respective media and produced Les Mains Libres, a book of Ray's drawings which had inspired Eluard's poems. Facile in 1935, however, was a joint effort in which photographs of the poet's second wife, Nusch, became part of a series of love poems.34 At the time the work was regarded as indecent,35 though today this kind of typographical layout with high key nude images helps sell bath salts or beauty cream in mass media. Ray's photographs present a flat, sensuous form boldly cropped and outlined by a thick shadow to create an effect somewhat similar to manuscript illumination. In the photo- graph accompanied by "A la Fin de I'Annee," the body is severely cropped, so that the torso creates a horizontal mass at the top with leg and arm extending downward on either side of the poem, a pose resembling that of an Egyptian tomb sculpture for Ramses VI of Nut, the sky goddess. Unlike the soap ad offspring of this photograph, however, word and picture do not directly illustrate each other. This type of marriage of word and photograph is quite different from Trottenberg's elegant attempt to link words of Marcel Proust with Atget photographs in A Vision of Paris. Fraser is rather harsh on this work, stating, "Mr. Trotten- berg's misguided notion of yoking Atget to Proust, and his concern for a nostalgic period charm and prettiness, led him too often to what was marginal or even boring in Atget's work... "36 The sense of imposing word with picture rather than achieving a sense of complement is suggested in Atget's photograph of a corset shop (Fig. 9) paired with the following from Proust: While as for her figure, and she was admirably built, it was impossible to make out its continuity (on account of the fashion WINTER 1976/77 Fig. 9. Eug,ne Atget, Corsets, n.d. then prevailing, and in spite of her being one of the best-dressed women in Paris) for the corset, jetting forwards in an arch, as though over an imaginary stomach, and ending in a sharp point, beneath which bulged out the balloon of her double skirts, gave a woman, that year, the appearance of being composed of different sections badly fitted together.... 37 "Badly fitted together" also describes this combining of text and photographs which neither author nor photogra- pher intended. A verbal description of the appearance of corseted forms is not helpful in reaching this photograph. Again, we are in the presence of mannequins, this time headless and armless torsos fitted with corsets. Outside the window near the entranceway, one such mannequin displays her wares in a state of levitation, while directly below an undergarment without dummy support waves in this other- wise frozen setting. Again, Atget's camera animates the mun- dane. The words that belong with Atget's photograph are not the ones Trottenberg has selected; the words are already present in the picture. Not all words are legible, and even the store's large sign, "Corsets," is cropped, though "A. Simon," "ouverts," "Dimanche," "Demandez," "Catalogue Illustre,' "Oktis," are some words which immediately catch the eye. These simple, yet emphatic messages, are subservient to the floating torso and waving garment which seem to have gone beyond the pragmatic world of commerce imprisoned be- hind the plate glass. For Man Ray contradiction was a way of life, and given his involvement in many media and styles, it is difficult to assess 137</page><page sequence="9">this artist. Atget produced a large body of straight photo- graphs, yet there is considerable contradiction within the small body of criticism of his work. Fraser talks of the poten- tial for dehumanization in the "haunting images of store- mannequins that caught the eyes of the Surrealists.... "38 He then concurs with Abbott that Atget is not a social critic and quotes her writing about the expression of human dig- nity in all of his pictures.39 Leslie Katz notes that Atget has been called a "primitive," and then suggests that he also can be called a "sophisticate," with the dubious reasoning that Paris street corners and prostitutes are "experienced."40 By confusing the basic pre- cepts of Surrealism, Katz separates Atget from the spirit of this movement, writing: Atget's photography is the antithesis of our contemporary fas- cination with the 'new,' the accidental, the fragmentary. Unlike Surrealism, it stresses the extremes of relation instead of disrela- tion, the objective thread that joins rather than the subjective chasm that separates. His images are not marred by conceptual fondness, or overclarified by sinister detail.41 In a letter in 1955, Man Ray says of Atget's work, "The blurred figures were not intentional, any more than the reflections in the window."42 Abbott, herself a master of the view camera, insists that Atget must have been aware of the reflections in a large ground glass, adding, "A man who knew so unfailingly where to place his camera knew very well what he was doing."43 Man Ray feels that Atget was an artist because he was not a perfectionist, though Minor White maintains "... Atget suffers from a lack of perfection."44 Outside the four photographs in La Revolution Surr6aliste and Man Ray's guarded statements, there apparently is no evidence to suggest that the Surrealists proclaimed Atget a forerunner in the way that Breton calls Henri Rousseau a "precursor."45 Certainly nothing is gained by forcing Atget into a Procrustean bed, especially a Surrealistic one. By con- sidering Atget in relation to basic precepts of Surrealism, however, richer insights into his work are possible, as op- posed to treating him purely as a documentarian with inade- quate technique. When placed next to Ray, who holds a historic place in Surrealism,46 his work does not suffer from possessing only a "little Surrealism," for there are often richer connotations in the seemingly direct statements of Atget than in the more extravagant images of Ray. At their best, Atget may function as a medium, while Ray may be the photographer-alchemist converting latent halide salts into pure silver images of beauty and mystery, with or without camera. e ' Paul Hill and Tom Cooper, "Man Ray," Camera, Feb., 1975, p. 40. 2 Hill and Cooper, p. 39. 3Berenice Abbott, The World of Atget, New York, 1964, p. xxviii. 4Hill and Cooper, p. 39. 5 Hill and Cooper, p. 50. 6 Jean Leroy, "Atget et son Temps," Terre d'lmages, May-June, 1964, p. 370.
