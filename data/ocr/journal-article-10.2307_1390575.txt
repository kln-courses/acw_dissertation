<plain_text><page sequence="1">ESSAYS Emptiness and Dogma Joseph S. O'Leary Sophia University The controversial Vatican document Dominus Iesus reasserts that non-Christian reli- gions are objectively in a defective situation as regards salvation. Etymologically, salva- tion (soteria salus) means health. Here I should like to reflect on apparent symptoms of ill health in Christian theology and ask if Buddhist wisdom can help us formulate a diagnosis and bring the issues into perspective in a healing way. I shall take as my guiding thread an idea familiar to readers of this journal, namely, that Christian the- ology has suffered from a delusive clinging to substance and identity, and that the Buddhist teachings of dependent co-arising, emptiness, and non-self may provide an antidote. Biblical and Christian traditions are rich in resources for a critique of substantial- ist conceptions of God and self. The God of the Bible is constantly shattering the fix- ated, idolatrous images his worshippers form of him, and the Johannine language of God as Spirit, light, love, locates God in a dynamic realm of communal contempla- tion from which it would be difficult to distill a well-defined divine substance suited to metaphysical analysis. As for self, Paul, and later Luther, present the Christian self as an existential and relational event, not a substantial self-contained soul. What of Christian theology as shaped from Greek metaphysics? Is it irredeemably substantialist, prey to naive reification and objectification? The definition of God as ipsum esse subsistens ("being itself subsisting") sufficiently eludes objectification to include the Plotinian sense of God as "beyond being." The idea adopted from Aris- totle that "the soul [as knower] is in a manner all things" suggests that metaphysical theology also developed a nonobjectifying conception of human being. The Christol- ogical debates of the early Christian centuries rely of necessity on substance language, yet in placing that terminology at the service of a revealed mystery beyond the grasp of language or thought, they introduce a ferment of paradox into the play of concepts and make of it a dance of traces, following the contours of a reality that cannot be brought under substantialist rubrics. Some might see the brilliant relational fireworks of Thomist trinitarian specula- tion as deconstructing logocentric images of divinity. However, the Trinity in itself is probably best seen as an abstract remainder concept, postulated as a dim background of the revealed phenomenon of Father, Jesus Christ, and Spirit, so that to spin stories of theories about it is futile, a form of misplaced concreteness.

O'LEARY Nagarjunian resonances in the trinitarian logic of the Council of Florence, notably in the decree it addressed to the Copts in 1442 (Magliola, 85-89). The Copts were given an extra dose of the logic that had caused profound unease among the Greek delegates three years earlier (see Gill, 227-232; 325). How much of this later logic did the Latins read back into the patristic texts they cited? Though unbeatable in the fifteenth century, how convincing is it today? Theology has to face the hermeneuti- cal task, and an ongoing one, of assessing the status and function of this trinitarian logic and referring it back to the biblical basis. The desubstantializing tendencies just noted can be drawn on in a contemporary "overcoming of metaphysics" in theology. But the mainstream of the tradition invested massively in substance and identity. It was by strong affirmations of sub- stantial identity that Christianity made its way in the world. Dogma determined the identities of Father, Son, and Spirit as consubstantial hypostases of the one God, the identity of Jesus Christ as true God and true man united in one hypostasis, the real presence of Christ in the Eucharist, the unity, sufficiency, infallibility of the Church and its Scriptures, the continuity of the episcopal and papal ministries as transmitted from the apostles. The substantiality of what was proclaimed was matched by the total conviction of the faith that proclaimed it. Theologians might tinker with spec- ulative elaborations, but the core of faith and dogma was untouchable, never sub- jected to doubt or questioning. It is a kind of metadogma that all this dogma was necessary. Adolf Harnack sought to dislodge dogma by a critical history of its formation, but he conceded that the charismatic wisdom of early Christianity would not have sufficed to sustain a univer- sal and enduring Church and that formal dogmas were a necessity, at least back then (Harnack 1927:88; Barth I/1:22). Dogma gave the Church its backbone, but apparently at a heavy price. It was dogma, not the earlier charismatic acclamation of Christ as Lord, that gave Christians their special sense of having secure possession of absolute truth. This, we now see, made them arrogant toward Jews, Muslims, and the peoples of the New World, Africa, and Asia, as well as toward fellow Christians in persecutions and religious wars. Affirmation about divinity translated so often into negation of humanity that Enlightenment critics could plausibly portray religion as a plague on the race (while their Pietist contemporaries sighed for a return to the pure nondogmatic Gospel). Had dogma been kept in strict subordination to the founding events all might have been well. But it took on a life of its own, claiming to be itself the foundation of Christianity and the most essential condition of salvation. Today we are able to contrast this history with the story of how Buddhism survived and spread in East Asia without any reliance on doctrinal intransigence. On guard against "attachment to views," Buddhists did not stress the inalterability or infallibility of their teachings. The teachings were kept subordinate to their practical purpose and given no auton- omy as pure theories. This contrast of the two religions may be an ideological sim- plification of the historical facts, as the Dalai Lama has recently hinted. Nonetheless, it points up the need to heal the dogmatic tradition by a genealogical account of ori- gins and its wrong turnings. 164</page><page sequence="3">EMPTINESS AND DOGMA CHRISTOLOGICAL HEADACHES One of the effects of the prominence of dogma was to shift the center of Christian vision from the event of Christ's death and resurrection to his unique ontological sta- tus as the incarnate Word. The Platonic structuring of the Christian vision gave to Christology a two-tiered structure. In the foreground were sensible events such as the crucifixion, but these were merely shadows of the all-important hidden background event: the assumption of human nature by the Word. In the New Testament the meaning of Christ centers on his death and resurrection; it is here that the divine Word is spoken into history. The "incarnation" in the sense of his ontological con- stitution prior to or independently of this saving event is barely hinted at. Yet as Aloys Grillmeier's vast history of Christology shows, reflection on the death and resurrec- tion of Jesus was overshadowed by disputes about the relation of his divine and human natures. "On the basis of'Christology' people forged their religious teachings into fearful weapons and spread fear and terror. This attitude still continues; Christology is han- dled as if the Gospel offered no other question; and the fanaticism that accompanies it is still living today" (Harnack 1913:79). As one bred in the tradition of Christol- ogical orthodoxy, trained to shudder at theologians thought to deny or dilute the true divinity of Christ, I find it difficult to recognize in this concern for "sound teaching" a form of sectarian fanaticism. Yet there is truth in Harnack's diagnosis. The impor- tance of dogma lies in its intention of preserving the truth about Christ, and it can perhaps be redeemed from its bloodstained career if it is converted back to its authen- tic function as a defense of the vision of God that Jesus opened up. The New Testa- ment statements that summarize the meaning of Christ-"God was in Christ recon- ciling the world to himself" (2 Cor. 5:19); "In him dwells all the fullness of the divinity bodily" (Col. 2:9); "The Word was made flesh and dwelt amongst us" (John 1:14)-are not so much propositional truth claims as the naming of a phenomenon. That phenomenon offers itself to our contemplation and cannot give rise to fanati- cal insistence or odium theologicum. In the dogmatic quarrels of the fourth century, the orthodox protagonists, when at their best, were aware of this contemplative aspect and expressed alarm at the prominence dogma and its terminology were acquiring; they had every reason to know how fragile and inadequate this terminology was and to sense the tension or mismatch between it and the more subtle and involving lan- guage of Scripture. But they were powerless to stop theological language from con- gealing into hallowed slogans with the result that zeal for correct thinking took the place of contemplative faith. Substantialism (astivada) slid into its opposite, nihilism (nastivada), as the fight about the substance of the Savior reduced his being to a word, a shibboleth, an iota. Today theological nihilism abounds just as much as its twin disease of substan- tialism, but it is by no means easy to apply these labels, though in the heat of theo- logical polemic it may seem so. The document Dominus Iesus (heartily promoted by John Paul II as an expression of his ecumenical ardor) condemns relativism and reductionism, and shows some diagnostic acuity in identifying the dangers and 165</page><page sequence="4">JOSEPH S. O'LEARY temptations incurred by revisionist theology. Its diagnosis may be partly confirmed by some of the responses it has drawn, insofar as they gloss over the all-important question of Christ's divinity, in a way that shows a deficit in theological and histor- ical reflection. Suppose one said: "We have encountered God through the teachings and example of the man Jesus, and we believe that other religious traditions equally encounter God or ultimate reality through their chosen teachers." That could be a beautiful simplification, solving all Christological and ecumenical headaches. But from the Vatican's point of view it is theological suicide, since it implies that Chris- tianity has been a very false religion, incapable of understanding the simple and uncomplicated truth about its Founder. This is an old quarrel. Karl Barth saw liberal Christology as having "made an unforgivable mistake, a mistake that rules out any understanding or even any dis- cussion between it and a Christology which does not wish to make that mistake" (1/2:145). In liberal theology the irreducible mystery summarized in the slogan "true God and true man" was conveniently simplified, making the complex Christological debates of the past seem otiose, and preparing the way for an understanding of Jesus as at best a supremely gifted moral and spiritual teacher. Both sides in the quarrel tend to give themselves a bill of perfect theological health and to regard the other side as profoundly sick. The spirited defense of orthodoxy against theological decadence feels so whole- some but can very easily show surprising signs of pathology, especially when it slings archaic language and imposes it violently on contemporary minds. Published just after the beatification of Pius IX, in a context of extreme Roman centralization and theological repression, Dominus Iesus carries the hue of its unhealthy context. Ecumenism has generally been experienced as a growth in Christian health and strength; rather than celebrate this fact, the Vatican document seems to relapse into a morose and jaundiced attitude to other Christian churches stirring troubled mem- ories of how French Catholic thinkers turned against the Huguenots before the revo- cation of the Edict of Nantes in 1682. In apparent contrast to the attitudes voiced by John Paul II in addressing Jews and Muslims, the document sees religious pluralism as dangerous and illegitimate rather than as enriching, and it confirms the suspicions of those who claim that for the Vatican today dialogue is only an instrument of mis- sion. A narrow theological logic prescribes these attitudes of mistrust. Convinced that the foundations of Christianity are imperiled and that the unique ontological status of Christ has to be defended against almost all theologians, the authors of the doc- ument are caught in a spiral of suspicion that spares no one, not even Paul VI, who dared to call the Anglican communion "our ever-beloved sister Church." Fear and mistrust are great sharpeners of the logical mind and can interpret more flexible pat- terns of thought only as betrayal, not as indices of a saner vision. Buddhism, which applies its arts to the illnesses of human thinking as reflected in language, could help clarify how an imprisoning logic has secured its grip on the ecclesiastical mind. But the roots of the illness lie in the old Christological language the document repeats. This language has become dysfunctional. It does not effec- tively state the truth about Christ for today. In a phobic manner, the Vatican, or its 166</page><page sequence="5">EMPTINESS AND DOGMA dominant conservative wing, has ignored or discredited all attempts to reinterpret that language, painting itself into a narrow corner. Polemic confrontation only acer- bates the unhealthy situation. What is needed is patient diagnosis and analysis in the Buddhist style. Neither side in the current theological standoff is in a state of perfect spiritual health. That is not a question of individual pathology, but concerns the shape that the history of Christian thought has acquired. It is not a question of teach- ing the Vatican fly the way out of the fly bottle, but of providing therapy for age-old theological constrictions that cause suffering wherever people think about Christian faith. The therapists must be careful not to be trapped in their turn by the mental- ity they seek to loosen up. Some Buddhist-inspired thinkers might say that to bother with such issues at all is futile or even morbid. But one must do so, not only in order to heal the theological suffering they cause, but also to attend faithfully to the valid claims of the tradition. The encounter with Buddhism should serve to transform Christian tradition, not to junk it. Yet one can sympathize with those who have given up on these dogmatic disputes. That life-loving genius, Goethe, dallied with theology long enough to discover its ill- ness. His Mephistopheles slyly remarks: Es liegt in ihr so viel verborgnes Gift ("There lies in it so much concealed poison"). He deplored the vast growth of Christology, which he believed had muddied the stream of European thought, and which one could neither attack nor defend without an appalling amount of scholarly endeavor. He pitied theologians, condemned like Sisyphus to mull over matters that had been debated for two millennia. However, between attack and defense there may be a mid- dle path, which may make Christology a less hopeless affair. It may be that thanks to historical scholarship, the questions of modernity, and the new lights coming from other religious traditions, the meaning of Christ is now falling into perspective in a way that cuts a great swath through the old controversies and allows the figure of Jesus to emerge in all his divine depth in a way that can be proposed to contempo- rary reflection and faith. At a time when the Christian faith seems to be undergoing an epochal change, a new style of Christological discourse may emerge that can do full justice to both liberal and conservative concerns, while healing the sickliness of both. What is needed is a richly phenomenological articulation of the meaning of Christ, one that will subtly and gently open out onto his divine dimension and thus recover in a persuasive form the truth intended in biblical myth and conciliar meta- physics. Such a theology "from below" might have to eschew the language "from above" used in Scripture and the Councils, while bringing into clearer focus the numinous realities testified to in that old language. Buddhist philosophy can play a powerful role in generating such an integral contemporary account of the phenom- enon of Christ, as John P. Keenan's books in particular have shown (see O'Leary 1997; Keenan 1998). Johannine and Chalcedonian Christology were in their day a resolution of chronic tensions, the emergence of a satisfying image of Christ. Today we need a similar moment of Christological resolution, overcoming the rigidity of uninterpreted dogma on the one hand, while on the other raising the low Christology diffused</page><page sequence="6">JOSEPH S. O'LEARY among liberal Christians to a firmer and richer apprehension of the mystery of Christ. The old kingpins of high Christology, such as the virgin birth and the empty tomb, have become too controverted to help here. Rather, it must be from within the most evident phenomena of the life and death of Jesus-such as his commandment of love, his healing presence, his self-sacrificing death, his Kingdom preaching, and his paschal spiritual presence to the Christian community-that an interpretation of his being is attempted. A Buddhist understanding of the nature and function of religion could be of key importance in bringing about such a Christological thaw, putting an end to the old quarrels, in a very welcome "quiescence of fabrications." Then we could reread the tradition, discerning how it testified to the meaning of Christ and at the same time how its culture-bound substantialist representations thwarted its artic- ulation of that meaning. The science of theology, in its subtler evolutions since Schleiermacher, has pre- pared the ground for this quite well. It has attempted to heal the tradition by step- ping back from dogmatic Christianity to its foundations in Scripture and by critical assessment of the diverse strands in Scripture itself (see O'Leary 1999). Instead of beginning with the idea of God acting as subject to reveal himself and save his peo- ple, a critical "theology from below" begins with Israel or with the man Jesus, and sees them as growing into an understanding of God that wins for them the status of "cho- sen people" or "incarnation of the Word." Thus Harnack (1927:82) diagnosed a wrong move in Christian theology when the Logos, at first a predicate of Jesus Christ, indicating the ultimate significance of his redemptive role and action, became instead the subject of redemption, with Jesus as its mere appearance. Barth replied (1/2:149): "Strictly speaking, the Logos can never be predicate or object in a sentence in which the subject is other than God. The Word became flesh, and only through this becom- ing of his, which is quite free and which is quite exclusively his becoming, did the flesh become Word." Liberal theology has dreamt up the historical Jesus in order to have "an access to Jesus Christ that bypasses his divinity" (15); it is the divine Word as subject that makes Jesus Christ who he is, so from the start our encounter with Christ has to be in this sense a "theology from above." Curiously, Barth also faults devotion to the Sacred Heart; its "direct glorification of the humanity of Christ as such bypasses and whisks away the divine Word" (151). But if we broaden the base of a "theology from below," it need not entail the reduction of the status of Jesus to that of a merely human teacher. It must be con- ceded to Barth that an integral phenomenological approach to Jesus Christ cannot reconstruct or even postulate a human nature of Jesus anterior to or independent of his special relation to God. The air is bristling with the divine power and presence from the start. A phenomenology of Jesus must begin with a phenomenology of God, as known in Israel, and then go on to discern how the human figure of Jesus appears within that divine milieu. But this discernment may open up many avenues of con- templation, which need not all be peremptorily brought under the rubric of divine Word as subject. The pluralism of New Testament Christologies is overruled in Barth's drastic imposition of the full-fledged incarnational schema of the Councils. In the phenomenological approach, the divine Word appears as an ultimate horizon of</page><page sequence="7">EMPTINESS AND DOGMA the meaning of Jesus. Still later it comes into view as the subject acting in Jesus, in the Johannine prologue. But this needs to be interpreted. God is the ultimate subject acting in and through the human actions of Jesus. God may be seen as speaking his Word in and through these actions. A phenomenological approach that sees Jesus from the start in his special openness to the intimacy with God implicitly co-appre- hends whatever will later be thematized as the Word made flesh. It grasps Jesus first as the event of the manifestation of God. Only as such is he Word made flesh. (Of course the notion of God as subject also needs to be recalled to its phenomenologi- cal base, a point to which I shall return.) This approach does not bypass Christ's divinity, but it does bypass the clumsy dog- matic constructions in which Barth is trapped. When Barth talks of the Word becom- ing Jesus, he reifies and anthropomorphizes the Word, projecting back onto it the personality of the human Jesus: "In appropriating this possibility [of fleshly existence] as its [or his] own and in actualizing it as such, in becoming Jesus, then, without ceas- ing to be what it was before, it became at the same time what it was not before, and now indeed was: a human being, this human being" (I/2:164). In personalizing the Word as the individual subject living and acting in Jesus Christ, this discourse ren- ders the humanity of Jesus unreal. Christology "from above" leads straight into doce- tism. "God himself in person is the subject of a real human being and acting" (165). The shrillness of the phrasing here suggests that Barth is conscious of the restora- tionist quality of what he is asserting. Instead, it would be enough to say that the true God acts in and through Jesus Christ, and in so exceptional a fashion that we can speak of Jesus, in the full range of his activity and being, as the "eschatological event" (Bultmann), and as the Word of God expressed in the fleshly historicity of the human condition. That is a more cushioned and subtle way of addressing the question of Christ's identity. It is about as accessible and as credible to the modern mind as the preexistence myths of Scripture of the metaphysical constructions of the Councils were in their time. Theological masochists who want faith to be a sheer skandalon are sacrificing their intellect not to what is revealed in Scripture but to archaic frame- works of thought. FROM SUBSTANCE TO SPIRIT Given its capacity to find Buddhahood in a mere blade of grass, Buddhism can allow us to see that a historical development that is thoroughly human, historical, contin- gent and error-prone, and that belongs to the register of conventional truth (samvrti- satya), can at the same time be the vehicle of divine manifestation, insofar as it has bent itself in obedient responsiveness to ultimate truth (paramartha-satya). This responsiveness is supremely enacted in the self-emptying of Jesus, who thereby becomes a unique sign of God's presence and vehicle of God's activity within human history. Buddhism radicalizes the theology from below by consigning all religious representations to the register of conventional truth, skillful means. But its sense of the nonduality between samsara and nirvana, conventional and ultimate, skillful means and wisdom, may allow it to do justice to the concerns of the theology from</page><page sequence="8">JOSEPH S. O'LEARY above, above all the concern that in the broken body of the human Jesus the fullness of God's wisdom and power is manifest. The Buddhist idea that nothing is hidden contrasts with accounts of Christian faith as a leap into the dark. There is no reason why Christian truth should not unfold as luminously and as accessibly as Buddhist truth. Buddhist wisdom reveals the nonsubstantiality of historic and religious identities that have served as bulwarks of self-assertion. Candrakirti observes that beings "have first generated self-infatuation through the thought 'I' and then attachment to objects through the thought 'This is mine,' so that like a paddlewheel they wander round and round devoid of self-determination" (Huntington, 149). The commentator Jay- tsun-pa adds: "The conception of true existence is an afflictive obstruction" (New- land, 82). Religions have become blindly flailing Leviathans because of their belief in their own intrinsic existence. They need to discover themselves as arising in depen- dence on a constantly changing array of contingent conditions and as having only a functional existence in their skillful response to these conditions. Buddhism is happy to see itself thus, but can Christianity accept such a view of its own existence as merely functional? Christian faith is bound to historical claims about Israel, Jesus, and the Church, claims that from the standpoint of Buddhist emptiness seem to be an absolutization of the conventional. We could attempt to reduce these claims to phenomenological terms as follows: Israel, Jesus, and the Church are loci of ultimacy, that is, places we go back to again and again in the con- fidence that there we will be enabled to break through to ultimacy, places where the ultimate has emerged within history, forged for itself an effective historical vehicle, a tradition to be used as a skillful means by its adherents. Thus the historical fabric of Christian faith is subordinated to the spiritual realities at work in that history. An active and interventionist God is correlated with the breakthrough of ultimacy. Conversely, Buddhist emptiness acquires the associations of a powerful breakthrough, almost a theophany. This way of talking might be seen as falsifying both Buddhism and the Bible, by making emptiness an active power while reducing God to a mere impersonal ulti- mate. But what is afoot here can be seen as a quite legitimate mutual solicitation of the two traditions. In contrast to coolly scholastic readings of Madhyamika that miss the liberating power of emptiness, reducing it to a Wittgensteinian dismantling of unwarranted conceptual fabrications, John Keenan associates emptiness with spiritual breakthroughs. He sees the "wilderness" in Mark 6:35 as "a place of spiritual empti- ness, where ultimate awareness can more easily break through the conventional structures which pattern human life" (Keenan 1995:161). The discovery of ultimate meaning is a breaking of shackles, a radical conversion from flesh to spirit, from bondage to law to the freedom of grace. Hence Keenan speaks of "the power of the otherness of ultimate meaning, threatening always to break through whatever limi- tations we set on our lives," and stresses how all are tempted, like Peter, "to bring its silent otherness back within the sphere of human fabrication [prapanca]" (210). The conventions of religion are meant to be seen as conventions pointing beyond them- selves as they indicate their own emptiness. Religious indoctrination encourages</page><page sequence="9">EMPTINESS AND DOGMA bondage to these conventions, instead of instructing people how to use them skill- fully. After the breakthrough to ultimacy, one reengages with the conventions but in a compassionate and creative way. The power of ultimate meaning is grace, Spirit, "the power of awakening, to the brightness of ultimate meaning and to bringing about the kingdom in the world" (211). How can emptiness be power? Perhaps the secret is that emptiness is the way things really are, so that to find it (or rather not to find anything) is to be put in energizing contact with the real. Emptiness is a way of living the conventional world, "an awareness of ultimate meaning expressed and embodied only in the presence of the everyday Jesus" (212). Keenan invokes the Yogacara idea of"worldly convention-only [samvrti-matraj] meaning that the bodhi- sattva empties even emptiness" (212), treading the middle way amid "ping-pong reverberations from epiphany to everydayness" (214). Jesus demythologizes religion-all the grandiose representations of Israel are recalled to the conventional everyday as the locus of the kingdom. Jesus "empties the role of messiah and reinterprets it as reengagement in the predictable dependently co-arisen conditions of his life"; "the Markan portrayal of Jesus is an emptying of all views of Jesus" (223). Can doctrinal tradition be reread (against its grain) as a similar schooling in emptiness? The poker-faced quality of the Chalcedonian definition of Christ as "made known in two natures without confusion, change, division or sepa- ration ... concurring in one person and one hypostasis" leaves the enigma of Christ's true divinity intact. To meet the truly human Jesus is to meet the divine Word, in a conjunction so intimate that the two realities cannot be separated or divided. Yet the two are not mixed or altered either: Jesus is consubstantial with us in his humanity; that is, he fully shares the contingent, dependently arising, fragile, conventional tex- ture of our history, of which he is part. And the Word remains what it always was, namely God. The human Jesus empties himself and in doing so reveals the empty ultimacy of God. One is tempted to say, echoing the quasi-adoptionist language of the New Testament itself (Acts 2:36; Rom. 1:4; Phil. 2:9; Heb. 1:4; 5:8-9), that it is by his self-emptying that he becomes the incarnation of the word, the visible his- torical trace of the divine emptiness. For Barth the human self-emptying of Jesus is only a reflection of a prior experi- ence, that of the divine Word as it condescends to assume human form: "Thus the death on the cross is only the explication of the incarnation" (1947:63). Phenom- enologically, it might make more sense to say that the death on the cross is the incar- nation; it is here that Jesus is manifest as eschatological event and that his ultimate identity as "the power of god and the wisdom of God" (I Cor. 1:24) is realized. Between the adoptionist model and the "explication" model, we can perhaps find another approach based on the idea that Jesus lived and died in the key of emptiness (and that the Jewish tradition out of which Jesus came can be read as a tradition of emptiness). The Word is present in Jesus Christ as the ultimate horizon of emptiness to which all his words and actions point. He lives a human life and a human death in such a way that they constitute a cipher of that realm of emptiness. Thus the "word of the cross" (I Cor. 1:18) is not an explication of the incarnation but is the incarna- tion itself. In the cross a word is spoken from out of the depths of the divine empti-</page><page sequence="10">JOSEPH S. O'LEARY ness and it is spoken in the midst of human history. It is this, and not some story of miraculous birth, that John refers to in John 1:14, "The Word was made flesh." What lights up in the cross of Jesus is the ultimate interplay between human finitude and divine emptiness, a powerful expression of the "form of God" (Phil. 2:6) or the Word of God in the forms of human, fleshly history. This view is not adoptionist, for the whole being of Jesus is involved in this role of being the manifestation of the Word in human history; nor does it entail a merely accidental unity of the man Jesus and the divine Logos (Nestorianism), for the ulti- mate identity of Jesus is not expressible except in terms of his specific role. But nei- ther does this view allow a docetist reduction of Jesus' life to the mere explication of a pregiven metaphysical arrangement. Jesus, acting from enlightened awareness, emp- ties out the Jewish tradition in such a way as to renew its power as a vehicle of ulti- macy. The Word that had been present in that tradition (ohn 1:11-13; 8:58) now finds full expression (John 1:14, 16-17), pressing into the world in and across the deeds, teachings, and death of Jesus. The phenomenological perspective we adopt here is incommensurable with the metaphysical perspective of the Chalcedonian debates, but it can claim fidelity to Chalcedon if it succeeds in not clearly falling into either of the extremes denounced by Chalcedon. Even on its own terms the teaching of Chalcedon was difficult to pin down, as shown in the flurry caused by Justinian's promotion of the formula "one of the Trinity has suffered" and in several other con- troversies. Justinian was one of those who diverted the European mind into Chris- tological fanaticism; his disgruntled chronicler Procopius offers a modern-sounding diagnosis: "I consider it a sort of insane folly to investigate the nature of God." In today's horizon the constraints imposed by Chalcedon have become rather fuzzier and are thus more easily satisfied. They survive more as challenges to the imagination of faith than as tricky protocols inhibiting all normal and natural discourse about the human Jesus. In the enfleshment of the Word that is realized in Jesus, what happens? We can perhaps phrase it thus: God makes himself known in his proper form (the Word) and in powerful immediacy (the Spirit) as an empty God, dissolving the fixated con- ceptions of God prevalent until then (and still with us). Christ as "the image of the invisible God" (Col. 1:15) opens up the true dimensions of the divine and opens up human receptivity of the divine; the Word is fully revealed and the Spirit is fully accessible. This opens up of a new relationship between human and divine centers on the self-emptying of Jesus on the cross. In the fleshly conditions of human life God is manifested as Spirit (John 4:24), as unconditioned freedom, no longer bound by the letter of Scripture, the Law, the cults at Jerusalem and Mount Gerizim, or any other religious conventions that idolatrously take themselves to be ultimate. THE EMPTY GOD In Madhyamika emptiness always has a conventional basis; it emerges in the analysis of this basis, and the emptiness itself is further analyzed so that it too is not allowed to congeal. Emptiness is always emptiness-of. Thus when we talk of the emptiness of God we mean that he is empty of the substantialist self-sufficiency we are so prone 172</page><page sequence="11">EMPTINESS AND DOGMA to ascribe to him. We must work on our conceptions of God and empty them of delusive substantialism. As we do so, there begins to emerge (in the light of Christ) an image of God as Spirit, grace, freedom, rather than supreme being, substance, power. This analysis extends to critical commentary on the legacy of discourse about God, a task that is endless. Such Talmudic theological labors should be a spiritual exercise for all believers. Indeed the parables of the Gospels are signal contributions to the task, and if we take them thus they become much more interesting and chal- lenging. But we have been so in dread of theological nihilism that we have preferred to forego this encounter with emptiness in favor of a brutally substantialist way of talking of God. Or we have favored mystical embraces of the divine on the under- standing that they leave the categories of dogmatic faith unscrutinized. Buddhism has not been so fearful of losing its hold on ultimate reality and has given free rein to the critical play of the mind. "With one voice all the Mahayana masters proclaim that analysis of objects, and not mere withdrawal of the mind from them, is the path to liberation" (Hopkins, 31). Similarly, religious bondage demands dissolutive analysis of the objects that cause it. Simply to "take leave" of God is to be fixated in the counterposition, constantly fight- ing with the shadow of God. Rather one must think through one's notions of God until they transform into traces of emptiness. Reification short-circuits the imagina- tive functioning of religious language and weighs it down with objects of clinging and defensiveness. When these are dissolved, religion becomes a style of discourse and practice that consistently heals, opens, and frees the mind. But their dissolution must be achieved through patient analysis, not iconoclastic rage. A desubstantializing the- ology may be set in motion by the nihilism along with that of substantialism. Analytical reasoning in Madhyamika, Tsong Khapa declares, is "only for the sake of sentient beings' attaining liberation" (Hopkins, 32). So the deconstruction of "God" is quite meaningless if pursued as a purely disinterested philosophical exer- cise; rather it must be a healing of painful and constricting conceptions accumulated in the course of a specific history of theistic imagining and thought. That nihilistic atheism is painful needs little demonstration, but in what manner is a reified theism painful? It is painful in that it is a projection of a basically deluded way of seeing things. The reification of God is on a continuum with the reification of self and of the data of experience. Conversely, if one acquired a fluid sense of self and a desub- stantialized awareness of being, the residue of older substantializing habits of mind in one's received concept of God would be felt as painfully dissonant. If God is massive substance, God is not an enabling foundation for the religious lifestyle of emptying oneself through nondiscriminating embrace of the neighbor in an inclusive community. It is not to give glory to a supersubstantial God that one dis- solves the false substantialisms of ego, but rather to tune in to the realm of Spirit and emptiness. The divine glory that is manifested in self-emptying love (as in the Old Testament the glory of God fills the temple at the hour of sacrifice) is not a substance but is aligned with the ultimate thusness (tathata) of things. For Buddhism a world in which all phenomena are understood to be empty would be a paradise, samsara itself would be nirvana. That idea of nirvanic joy is close to the Christian idea of the divine glory blazing out in the renewed creation. God is not an entity over against us 173</page><page sequence="12">JOSEPH S. O'LEARY who is intent on getting his rightful share of glory. "He fathers forth whose beauty is past change" (G. M. Hopkins). He is not to be fixed in place as the substance that founds the world, but manifests himself as the Spirit that reaks through whenever the conventional fabric of the world is seen, by enlightened eyes, as an empty vehicle of ultimacy. The reification of God is reflected in the processes of reification and fetishism that warp religious thinking at every level. The therapy of these replaces fixations with vital processes and communicative events. "Even a suspicion that emptiness-the lack of inherent existence-is the mode of being of phenomena disturbs the very causes that produce the rounds of powerless suffering" (Hopkins, 33). To season all religious cults and claims with the grain of salt of this suspicion encourages a reap- propriation of the religious heritage as an arsenal of skillful means aiming at libera- tion. Religious representations are flowers of emptiness, their entire raison d'etre, the air that they breathe, is emptiness, liberation. The elaborate constructions of Chris- tian theology, though heavily burdened with clumsy substantialism, are nonetheless pervaded by rumors of emptiness, liberation. The elaborate constructions of Chris- tian theology, though heavily burdened with clumsy substantialism, are nonetheless pervaded by rumors of emptiness, of God as Spirit. Perhaps only the encounter with Buddhism can effect the transformation of theology that has often been desiderated. (Barth in old age wished he had written a theology of the Spirit rather than a theol- ogy of the Word.) If the rumors of emptiness and Spirit swell to become the central all-pervasive melody of theology, then its old fabrications can find their quiescence in a serene focusing of the event wherein they are all contained and surpassed. God as Spirit is phenomenologically accessible as a dimension of joy, love, the peace that passes understanding. This dimension is the primary source of valid usage of the term "God" on the lips of such founding figures as Paul, John, and Augustine. Without such figures, who rooted the term "God" in contemplative vision, the word would indicate only the pallid, oppressive figure of an omnipotent creator and judge. To add to the apprehension of God as Spirit a metaphysical definition of God as substance or essence or being itself is to mix chalk with cheese, generating the equiv- ocal malaise that runs right through Christian theology. The whole point of the doc- trine of the incarnation is that this vision of God is definitively established in human history, accessible wherever the name of Jesus is called on. Jesus is savior because he wins us access to a saving God, one who is unambiguously "light" (I John 1:5). There is no need to add extra machinery to the phenomenology of this event. But are we not going too far in desubstantializing the divine at the risk of toppling over into nihilism? Following Madhyamika logic, will we not find ourselves obliged to make the further claim that God is dependently co-arisen, existing only "through the force of terms and expressions" (Hopkins, 37) as all other entities do? "Phenom- ena depend on thought in the sense that only if the thought that designates an object exists, can that object be posited as existing (conventionally)" (ibid.). This applies to all notions and constructions of God, but does it apply to God as such? Is there a place for God in a world where nothing exists inherently? Or have we reduced God to a merely conventional existent, which can still perform impressive functions?: 174</page><page sequence="13">EMPTINESS AND DOGMA "what is merely designated can be functional, just as a girl created by a magician can attract an unwitting audience" (Hopkins, 38). Emptiness arises in dependence on the conventional bases of which it is the empti- ness. God as Spirit is also always discovered dialectically, as Spirit overcomes what is opposed to it (sin, the Law, flesh and blood, or the letter). Madhyamika deabsolutizes emptiness by stressing the emptiness of emptiness itself. Perhaps we can analogously stress the spirituality of spirit itself, that is, that the divine freedom, which moves as it wills, cannot be frozen into an immutability that would be incompatible with free- dom. The presence of God is discovered again and again in breakthrough to freedom (spiritual freedom, creative freedom, political freedom, forgiveness of sin), all depen- dently arising. Yet the ultimacy of divine freedom itself cannot be conceived of as aris- ing in dependence on anything else (unless one is prepared to enter the murky waters of process thought). Further discussion of this point would need to establish how essential to the logic of Buddhism is the idea of the dependently arisen status of ulti- mate reality itself (emptiness, nirvana) and what precisely the idea entails. In the meantime we can take it as a warning against conceiving divine freedom and eternity in rigidly static terms, or perhaps against attempting to conceive them at all, beyond what is known phenomenally in our experience of the "the glorious freedom of the children of God" (Rom. 8:21). Jews, Christians, and Muslims have been dealing with God for thousands of years, not just in speculation, but in lived encounter. Their phenomenological witness to the nature of the God they have met cannot be discounted. When we overcome tra- ditional representations of God, we must do so in such a way as to validate and be validated by this phenomenological core of the biblical traditions. That is the test by which to assess revolutionary proposals such as the identification of God with a "serendipitous creativity manifesting itself in evolutionary and historical trajectories of various sorts" (Kaufman, 10) or the proposal that God cooriginates along with the cosmos out of an original Nothingness (Scarborough, 214). One thing that is clear throughout the traditions, even in the Yahwist, is that the encounter with God is an encounter with ultimacy. When we are asked to choose between a God who is "abso- lute, infinite, transcendent, utterly independent and unresponsive" and "one whose absolute self is exploded and plunged primordially into the life-world, beyond imma- nence and transcendence, with us" (ibid.), I should think the former sounds closer to the phenomena, except for the word "unresponsive." Even in that ancient formula of Dante's, "the love that moves the sun and the other stars," Aristotle's unmoved mover is no longer unresponsive. But neither do we demand of absolute love that it be responsive, as if it were a human lover; to do so would savor of anthropomorphism. Between Kaufman's reduction of God to a cosmic force and Scarborough's vision of a highly personalized God who shares our life-world, the middle way is God as Spirit, closer to us than we are to ourselves, yet infinitely transcending us. Just as when we cease to think of the self as a substance we are more in touch with it as a dependently arising continuum from moment to moment, so when we relin- quish the effort to objectify and identify God we rediscover God as the one who is "always to hand" (pantote, as in John 12:8: "the poor you have always with you") as</page><page sequence="14">JOSEPH S. O'LEARY the quite other, the transcendent whither of our trust. We relinquish a positive dog- matic discourse on divine eternity or speculative efforts to tamper with it, not in a spirit of intellectual capitulation, but from reasoned insight into the texture of our conceptions of God. God comes into view in the realm of the thusness or emptiness that is the ultimate truth at which all the conventional truths of the conceptual realm aim. This is a realm to be discovered again and again through analysis that clears away obstruction to its emergence, including the obstructions of our own ideas about that realm. Even so vividly profiled a figure as the God of the biblical and incarnational economy remains an ultimate to be encountered, not conceptually grasped. All speech about this God is doxology, kindled by that encounter, not objective discourse subject to metaphysical processing. Dogmatic statements about God are chiefly of negative value, ruling out ways of thinking about God that are incompatible with divine ultimacy, or with divine graciousness. Christ, as the event of the encounter with God, also eludes objective categorization. The dogmas about him are to be seen as guidelines to the full appreciation of this event, and chiefly consist of negative warnings against accounts that curtail a proper understanding of God's presence in Christ. A PARADIGM SHIFT One can uphold an objective referentiality for theological concepts, but only with the condition that the objective content of these concepts cannot be distilled out of their pragmatic function in a discourse of healing and liberation. The concepts refer us back to what is given in the lived encounter with God and can add nothing to this. Their referential value is oblique, parasitical on the encounter. The meaning of such a term as "God" is integrally embedded in the actual practices of invocation, trust, opening up to grace, wherein our existence is oriented to and from God. God as a notion or entity detached from this situational context is already a false God, a dead idol. Perhaps our affirmations need to be reformulated as optatives. When we say "God is good," we are not really claiming to have a clear idea of what God is, but are orienting ourselves to ultimate reality taking the notion of goodness as our guid- ing thread. The cognitive yield of our proposition is oblique and context-dependent, though that is not so say it has no truth value or that the proposition "God is not good" cannot be proscribed as objectively false (under the normal conditions of its enunciation). What is needed is a theory of the functioning of religious language that can allow it to perform in a lucid and demystified way this role of orienting us to "ultimate reality" (a phrase best kept "under erasure"), without prematurely fixing its referents. A paradigm shift condemns an old world to vanish, as Newton's did when Ein- stein came, yet the truth of the old world may be preserved in a sense, as Newton's is within Einsteinian cosmology: "According to Feyerabend, to say that Einstein's and Newton's theories (or paradigms) are incommensurable is to say that they principles for constructing concepts in one suspend the principles of the other. That is, the rel-</page><page sequence="15">EMPTINESS AND DOGMA ativistic ideas used to understand mass, length, and time do not permit the use of the alternative Newtonian ideas" (G. Munevar in Preston, 73). Likewise, we can no longer construct the concept of God along the lines of myth- ical narrative or ontotheological metaphysics. Rather, in the relativistic perspective of reflection on religious pluralism, monotheism emerges as one historical convention among others. If we continue to use the word "God" in our actual religious discourse, its meaning has changed somewhat as the meaning of the word "mass" has changed in Einstein's discourse. Newton's mass is conserved, Einstein's is convertible with energy. Classically "God" refers to a single immutable entity: Today "God" is a flex- ible pointer, used as a skillful means for indicating the empty realm of Spirit. One might say that "God," along with other highly charged religious expressions, is des- tined to be converted into a rhetorical stratagem for unleashing the energy of religious awareness, or for tuning in to the creative, transforming energy of Spirit that all reli- gious traditions have felt in one way or another. The biblical identification of God as the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, or as the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ points to places where God is encountered and thus identifies God at a sec- ond remove. One might say: "Supreme gracious reality was known as 'God' in Israel, and any quest for this reality can find secure bearings by linking to the Israelite tra- dition and its Christian development, tried and tested vehicles of ultimacy." The more direct identifications of God as Lord, creator, holy, just, merciful need not imprison the religious imagination. They are pointers only, clues to follow in seeking the dimension of Spirit today. They contain objective truth, but it cannot be distilled from the oblique and contextual conditions of its articulation. Even scientific concepts can be quite slippery and elusive, and this is much more the case with religion. So the demand for lucidity includes a demand for insight into the limits of lucidity in this realm. Religious thinking is an art of dealing with the mysterious and ineffable, and it is critically opposed to the crude slogans of religious propaganda. Such slogans may be scriptural catch phrases such as "God is love," torn from their original rich literary or contemplative context. Between a helpless floun- dering in the ineffable and the crudity of such false clarities, religion at its best focuses the inscrutable in gripping symbols and effective rituals. It provides a map of exis- tence within which one can orient oneself to the ultimate: the system of covenant and Torah in Judaism; the profiling of a path through death to new life in the story of Jesus and the sacraments that encapsulate it; the various maps of transition from sam- sara to nirvana in Buddhism. In these maps everything fits satisfactorily into place; but that very smoothness suggests that the maps are products of the imaginary, in which the opacities and rough edges of real life are smoothed away. The historical and prophetic books of the Old Testament show how powerfully such a map can deal with the tangles of history, but not without occasional adjustments of the map when the historical material shows itself resistant to idealization. It is not that the maps are false, but their truth is of necessity communicated in poetic, metaphorical, symbolic terms, and the effort to squeeze out a bluntly literal statement repeatedly falls flat. According to the classical logic of religion each such map would seem obliged to claim to be the only true map, or the map that integrates all other maps. Today such 177</page><page sequence="16">JOSEPH S. O'LEARY confident mapping of the other has become less and less feasible, and we are not even confident that our religious map remains entirely valid for the tradition that pro- duced it. Religious maps are vulnerable to correction in light of scientific findings and in light of alternative maps that in one point or other are more satisfactory. The maps have to be reimagined. Their value lies in the experience and practice they enable and from which they have been projected. This experience and practice will change as the maps undergo imaginative revision, or conversely revision of the maps may be prompted by new developments in experience and practice. Religious conceptions share the pervasive mobility or instability of human historical thought. The fixity of mythic and dogmatic maps often block awareness of this, and they are kept in place until the day when it is realized that they have long lost their enlightening and con- vincing power. We seem now to be passing from a religious culture of allegedly unchanging maps to one in which the maps are constantly being revised or expanded, and in which they are admitted to have only approximate and provisional validity. The dogmatic or skeptical sifting of religious utterances in view of their cognitive truth can distract from the task of an integral reflection on the life of faith. Knowl- edge of truth is presupposed in religious activities, but most of them are not primar- ily concerned with cognitive attainment. Even what sounds like a creedal claim can be an expression of moral, emotional, or spiritual experience or purpose, so that the question "true or false" fails to apply to it. A more comprehensive reflection would attempt to assess the healing (or "salvific") function of religious stories and activities, dealing with them in their total vital context, and within this context allowing ques- tions of cognitive truth to be formulated more subtly and richly and dealt with in a more salutary way. The rational justification of religion has less to do with its capac- ity to inform us about the way things really are than with its power to orient us to deeper levels of experience and of reality and to help us live better lives. Truth must be limited to its precise role within the religious economy and not be erected into a sacred cow that feeds egoistic self-assertion and hatred of the other. Seen in this perspective, Jesus Christ cannot be made the object of detached the- oretical statements. His identity, beyond talk of natures and hypostases, is that of a decisive event, divine as much as human, in which God makes Godself known and felt to human beings as Spirit. That event is renewed wherever his commandment of love is enacted. What makes him "ontologically unique" is that he is the one, in his full fleshly historical context, in whom the face of God has become manifest in so fully gracious a form that we speak of it as eschatological, that is, as proleptic of the ultimate vision of God face to face. That is why, writing on the last day of the second millennium, I may still repeat the astonishingly confident words of the author of Hebrews: "Jesus Christ yesterday and today the same, and unto the ages" (Heb. 13:8).
