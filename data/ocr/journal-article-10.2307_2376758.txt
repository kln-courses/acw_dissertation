<plain_text><page sequence="1">LIBERALISM AND ORTHODOXY. GEORGE ALEXANDER BARROW. AS the number of liberals in the orthodox denomi- nations daily increases, the issue which once seemed so clear is in danger of becoming confused. In the early days of the liberal movement, the controversy between the old and the new in theology was clear cut. The cham- pions of higher criticism or evolution were known to all to be definitely opposed to the ordinarily received views in theology. But to-day, when many are drifting rather than working toward the new views, there are many in- termediate positions. The center, too, of the conflict has changed. Whether from a feeling that debatable matters do not belong to the sphere of practical church adminis-</page><page sequence="2">LIBERALISM AND ORTHODOXY. 203 ration, or from a wish to keep the peace, we have reached an era of good-feeling. The epithet of heretic is becom- ing obsolete, and heresy-trials relics to be put away on a shelf. To many, undoubtedly, this means that the church is putting the emphasis where it belongs,-on the moral problems. Such persons are saying that the great con- troversy is with sin, and that minor differences of belief as to the best means of warfare should be forgotten in the presence of the enemy. At the same time, fundamental disagreements are none the less important, because they are concerned with methods only. If the controversy were concerning the final goal, discussion might be fruitless, be- cause neither party would be interested in the other's purpose; but where each party is striving for the same end and desires the other's help, the disagreement be- comes quite important. The best interests, therefore, of the movement to raise our moral standards demand that we examine carefully our ideas as to the means of realiz- ing the end. To be indifferent to differences of theological belief is not in the interest of real moral reform. A further and a personal reason for keeping the issue clear is apparent to those, who, like the writer, are in touch with the orthodox denomination to which they be- long, as well as with the radical thinkers outside the ortho- dox churches. It has often seemed to me that on one thing at least ultra-conservatives and ultra-radicals are agreed, and that is that the moderate, especially the mod- erate liberal, has no standing at all. In some form or other, the imputation of hypocrisy is sure to be cast on the liberal, especially the liberal clergyman, who remains in an orthodox organization. The conservative cannot see how the liberal can be sincere in his allegiance to the creeds of his church, and the radical shares in this in- ability. To be sure, our opponents of both wings are usually too polite to claim that we are knowingly in- sincere, yet the most that they will allow us is that we are self-deceived. Now, are the creeds of the churches such that the liberal can hold his new views and yet be</page><page sequence="3">204 INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ETHICS. sincere in his allegiance to the theology of a past age? The intelligent man is asking whether he cannot remain in his old associations and yet be progressive. This new attitude of the educated layman, who wishes to hold his liberal ideas and remain within the church, forces us to ask and face squarely the question, Can a liberal be truly orthodox? If orthodoxy is to be defined in the terms of the con- servatives, and liberalism in the terms of the radicals, the two cannot be brought into harmony. But it cannot be taken for granted that the ordinary idea of orthodoxy or of liberalism is the correct one. There have been many attempts to alter the ordinary definition of liberalism, in order to allow of its being orthodox, but there is also the other possibility, of so defining orthodoxy that it may be liberal. This is not so impossible as it seems at first. If we take orthodoxy, not as a closed system, but as that tendency of thought which the Christian church has taught as the true path to knowledge, we soon find that our whole conception is altered. This does not mean that all recent liberalism is orthodox, but that a liberal is not necessarily a heretic. We do not ordinarily realize that the closed system of truth was not the original idea of the leaders of the church. It arose not in the first flush of the pursuit of truth, either in the early Christian ages or in the first impulse of the Reformation; it was rather- the work of the militant controversies which followed. In the heat of conflict men could not stop to weigh fine points, nor afford to leave loose edges. Now this hard and fast setting of bounds may be militant orthodoxy; it is hardly orthodoxy true to itself. The looser systems of Luther or Zwingli, and the speculations of Athanasius and Origen have a better claim to the title of truly orthodox than the more dogmatic pronouncements of Calvin or the Roman See. Our remarks apply not only to the less important matters of the faith; the central doctrines of the Atone- ment, the Incarnation, and the Trinity, were by no means held in the vise-like grip of modern orthodox scholars.</page><page sequence="4">LIBERALISM AND ORTHODOXY. 205 A distinction between heresy and truth there has always been, but the distinction between heresy and orthodoxy is characteristic not of the creative age, but of the em- balmning age. When a great truth is being formulated, the test of truth is applied, and falsity is called heresy. It is only when orthodox development has stopped that the test of authority is substituted for that of truth. Liberalism, therefore, which insists on applying the test of truth, is at least not to be put out of court without a hearing when it seeks to prove itself orthodox. The question which merits discussion is whether the trend of modern liberalism is in harmony with the early trend of Christian orthodoxy. We are not here concerned with applying the test of truth of which we have just spoken, but only with asking whether, if applied, the an- swer must be a decided yes or no. The fact of applying the test of truth to the doctrines of the church does not prove us unorthodox. The general question becomes at once an historical one. If the modern closed system does not represent orthodoxy, we must be able to explain how it came to be substituted for the earlier truth. We need to see how the original constructive thought of the East came to be tied down to the limits of our modern western orthodoxy. In the days of classical Latin learning there was little in philosophic or religious thought that could be called distinctively Roman. The great names of Latin philoso- phy are either those of Greeks living in Italy, or those of followers of the different Greek schools of thought. Rome undoubtedly added something to the Greek development, but it was rather in the direction of a firmer moral stan- dard, a more vigorous outlook on life, than in the way of speculation. Every educated Roman of the period looked to Athens and Greece for his education, as every Englishman of a century ago did to Oxford or Cambridge. Athens and Alexandria, the latter coming into prominence later than the former, spanned the region of new thought. Rome came to take, not only her formal learning, but Vol. XXTI.-No. 2. 13</page><page sequence="5">206 INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ETHICS. even her new religions, from that eastern country which she had so lately conquered. Aside from the great in- fluence of the Greek religion on the old Latin cult, all the faiths that had vigorous life in the first Christian centuries, within the western part of the Empire, came from the East. The cults of the Syrian goddess, of Isis, and especially of Mithra, held western Europe in a re- ligious tutelage as firmly as Greek thought held Latin speculation. This eastern influence the first Christian propaganda increased. All the names of the early bishops, even of the Church of Rome itself, are Greek, and for years Greek was its official language, as it was of all the churches. Coming from the East, Christianity appealed first to the Greek elements in the population, and this still further increased the eastern influence within the church. It was to be expected, under these circumstances, that Rome should for a long time follow eastern leadership in the development of Christian speculative thought. Chris- tian Rome turned, as readily as had classic Rome, to the East for guidance and instruction. The whole history of the first four centuries shows the same thing. If we substitute Antioch for Athens, the statements concerning education in the East hold true down to the reign of Constantine, so far as education existed at all during these troubled times. Athens was too closely identified with the pagan learning to become a Christian center, but Syrian Antioch and Egyptian Alexandria, both become Greek, took its place. Not one of the leaders of the great heresies of these first four centuries is Latin. This is not because the Greek mind was more perverse than the Roman, but because the only thinking that could lead to heresy, the only constructive thinking, was being done in the East. The great rivals were Antioch and Alexandria; while Rome, influential as her church undoubtedly was, had very small part in these early controversies. What part she did have was rather that of a balance wheel than that of a qualified judge. She was subjected to harder trials than some of</page><page sequence="6">LIBERALISM AND ORTHODOXY. 207 the other centers, especially as the seat of government, so her judgment was often more practical than that of her eastern sister churches. The formative period in any movement is the time that stamps upon it most strongly those tendencies which are to influence and guide it in later periods. The formative period in Christian theology stood under Greek influence. It is to the Greek theology of these first four centuries, therefore, that we must go to obtain our definition of orthodoxy. In outlining the development of Greek theology it is well to consider somewhat the essence of the Hellenic mode of thought. As well known as the fact of the de- pendence of Rome on Greece, is the impulse to system- building which dominated the history of Greek philosophy. From the beginning to the end of the ilellenic intellectual dominance, systems of metaphysics continued to rise and fall. This was due partly to a desire to explain existence in as simple terms as possible, but especially to the desire to find a principle to explain the whole of existence. If each thinker had been intent on but one problem of reality, he would have evolved an explanation for that, but not a system to explain the whole. From the beginning, with the possible exception of Socrates, the object of the Greek was to give an account of the basis of all reality, and Socrates's work differed only because he was evolving a method. This bent of the Hellenic mind is seen in the ever-recurring cosmologies. They represented so many attempts to describe the universe in terms of the prin- ciple which each philosopher believed he had discovered as the basis of existence. When these Greek tendencies began to work upon the subject-matter of the Christian religion, history simply repeated itself. It is no surprise that the early Greek heresies centered around their cos- mologies. Later, when these first crude attempts were shown to be false to the Christian truths, the same meta- physical spirit expressed itself in the more subtle con- structions of Arius and the post-Nicean heresies. Each of these systems was concerned with the whole universe,</page><page sequence="7">208 INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ETHICS. and took man, and sought to explain him, as a subor- dinate part in creation. Quite foreign to them is the humanism of those whom the orthodox now call 'Arians.' The fact is, neither heretical thought nor early orthodox thought centered the attention upon man. The orthodox line, instead of building cosmologies, sought a central principle, simpler in operation than the emanation theory of the various heresies. This principle it found in the doctrine of the Logos. But orthodoxy had as little thought of personality as had the Gnostics: indeed, it cannot be too strongly emphasized that the Logos doctrine, taking its origin from Alexandria, scarcely resembled the later teaching, which insisted on the personality and individu- ality of the Christ. Arising in the midst of a great city, under the influence of a complex civilization that did not place the high value upon the individual which we have come to place upon him, this teaching of the orthodox in the time of Athanasius that the Logos is equal with God, and incarnate in Jesus, could not fail to fix its em- phasis more on the ideal Logos than on the actual Jesus. To this intellectual tendency is to be added the sense of empire. Under both the Macedonian and the Roman Empires, the impressive thing to the ancients was the whole, not the part. Principles rather than individuals grew more important as the units grew larger. Great forces, not the men who embodied them, claimed men's attention. So the Logos doctrine, not the personality of the Christ, held men's thoughts. Two factors, therefore, the tendency of the Hellenic mind to face world prob- lems and the pressure of a great civilization away from the individual influenced early orthodoxy to formulate its creeds in impersonal terms. What we mean by impersonal is plain when we read the decisions of the first four General Councils. Discus- sions of the equality of the Logos with God before the birth of Christ, of the equality of the human and the divine in Christ,-such problems scarcely emphasize the human side of Jesus, and his relation to human needs.</page><page sequence="8">LIBERALISM AND ORTHODOXY. 209 Yet it is not due to the exaltation of the man Jesus, for these early thinkers avoid the imputation, sometimes cast on later theologians, of tritheism. Their whole concern is not with the humanity of Jesus, but with his relation to the universe and to God. The human figure neces- sarily became abstract, and they worshiped, not the Nazarene, but the Logos. Because of this, because their thought was not of history but of metaphysics and specu- lation, they never closed their system. The stagnation of eastern religious thought came only when all thought stagnated. As long as there were any to carry on the development, orthodoxy in the East moved forward. This is not our mode of thought to-day, nor was it the way of the Middle Ages. Eastern orthodox thought laid emphasis on the world problem, and did not take itself as a closed system. The discussions of the councils were against existing and past heresies; they did not attempt to forecast the future. Also, the authority they sought to exert was that of truth and correct thinking. Partisan and violent though they often were, authority was never invoked as an ideal. The emphasis on human personality and on church organization had its primary growth else- where than in the primitive regions of Christianity. When the development of doctrine came in the west of Europe, it came, as it had come in the East, largely in response to heresy. To combat false doctrines, true doctrines had to be developed. Of course, Rome did not stand apart from the earlier evolution, but the earlier native theologians either merely reflected the eastern tendencies, or worked in harmony with them. When, how- ever, the intercourse between East and West became less, and with political separation each section came to have its own peculiar problems, the churches of Africa and of Rome began to develop their own theology. This hap- pened in the life-time of Augustine. The three great heresies, the Manichman, the Donatist, and the Pelagian, forced the orthodox of the West to formulate their own views; for while Manichoeism came from the East, it</page><page sequence="9">210 INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ETHICS. seems to have been especially strong in northern Africa, while the Donatist movement was confined to that region, and Pelagianism started in the West. Another reason that forced independence on the West was the lukewarm- ness of the East with regard to these questions. While Alexandria and Antioch never exactly lapsed into these heresies, they never so definitely condemned them as did the West. Rome and Carthage, therefore, began their independent doctrinal development at this point. This Latin development differing in its origin from the Greek, dealt with heresies of a different nature from those which had convulsed the early church. They were all, in some form or other, concerned with action, with moral- ity, and with man, not with the universe. The Manichaean theory, while it gave evil a large place in the universe, had its strength and its vogue because it presented a theory of conduct. It arose from the desire to explain sin, and was the forerunner of those theories of evil which have continued till to-day. While there had been explanations of evil in the Gnostic and Arian systems, that was not their chief interest; but with Manichaeism, the conflict raged around this problem. Augustine joined this sect before he became an orthodox believer, and his first controversy, after his conversion, was against his old belief. The next controversy of his life was more concrete still. The Donatist schism arose over the mat- ter of church discipline, and came to involve the theory of the church and her relation to the moral code. This limited Augustine's interest even more to the problem of sin, and to matters of conduct. Church organization being involved, the theory of the visible church was made a center of interest. The last of the three contro- versies, and the one which has colored the entire subse- quent history of western Christianity, was with the Pelagians. In response to the attacks on orginal sin and human freedom, Augustine put forth the theories of predestination and the impossibility of salvation with- out baptism. The eastern churches never accepted these</page><page sequence="10">LIBERALISM AND ORTHODOXY. 211 views; and from this time dates the definite drawing apart of the two halves of Christendom. With these doctrines came the development of the theories of the Incarnation and the Atonement to describe the method of salvation. The whole interest of theology was changed. Not the universe, but man; not God's need of revealing himself, but man's need of salvation; not the problem of the universe, but the problem of sin and evil, were men 's concern. Dealing thus with men, and men's government, theol- ogy became more concrete. While there has been de- velopment since then, even the Reformation has not changed the essential problems and doctrines of ortho- doxy. Luther and Calvin were better followers of Augus- tine in doctrinal theology than their opponents, and it has been well said, that the Church of Rome built its doctrine around one half of Augustine's teaching, and the Protestants around the other half. Practically all the controversies since Augustine have dealt with man, or with church organization. The radicals, mainly hu- manists, have only emphasized this the more. The theory of God has so far stood still that it is only in the sphere of modern philosophy, the work mainly of laymen, that there has been any advance in the study of the funda- mental problems of being. The whole strength of theo- logians seems to have been centered, so far as they have approached the problem at all, upon bolstering up the received views. The arguments for God's existence, and not that existence itself, have been the objects of study. This is very far removed from the condition of early orthodoxy with its whole interest in God rather than in man. With this concreteness and preoccupation with man has gone a growing emphasis on the personality of Christ and of God. The term 'personality,' which in our sense the Greeks never used, has come to be the test of ortho- doxy. God is conceived in more anthropomorphic terms to-day than by the pagan thinkers of two thousand years</page><page sequence="11">212 INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ETHICS. ago. Man has seemed to demand that God be like him- self, or at least like his ideals. This was perhaps natural in the days of stress in which Augustine lived, and in those days of equal storm which brought in the Reforma- tion. The sense of imperial destiny was gone. The area of men's thoughts and actions was circumscribed. The battle of life in many cases, especially during the Middle Ages, was a struggle for a bare living, and the task of the church the inculcation of the most primitive morality. Under such conditions, the individual came to the front, and the history of all that time, down to the rise of modern nationalism, is largely a history of the leaders. The forces acting through these leaders were not recognized, and even God could be thought of only in human terms. Where men's thoughts were tied down to earth, it is natural that their concern should be most with their own salvation, and with human organization in church as well as in state, and that they should tie their belief to definite historic facts. This insistence on the historic basis of Christianity, the concreteness of orthodoxy, and the emphasis of per- sonality and individuality,-all are the products of the same causes. The, Middle Ages may have been the time of great ideals, but they were concrete even when most fanciful. The ideal of religion for the Crusader was to reconquer the Holy Sepulcher by the sword, and he is the type of this age. The militant churchman of to-day is his true successor. To him and to the Crusader we have only to point to illustrate the distance we have traveled from primitive orthodoxy. I mean not merely nor prin- cipally his use of earthly weapons in a spiritual warfare, but his preoccupation with the problems of earth. The traditional question of some modern evangelists, "How is it with your soul? " is far different from the question of the orthodox of the age of the great councils, "What is your belief of the Logos?" Protestant orthodoxy has made even the doctrine of the Trinity primarily, as is sometimes said, 'economic,' and the chief use of the doc- trine has at times seemed to be as a mere corollary of</page><page sequence="12">LIBERALISM AND ORTHODOXY. 213 some theory of the Atonement. To carry these ideas into the creeds is plainly an anachronism. The creeds could not pronounce on questions that had never been raised. Augustinianism cannot preempt the whole field of orthodoxy. When we turn to study the tendencies of recent thought, we understand easily the revolt from the orthodoxy which we have just characterized. At first sight it may seem that we are equally far from primitive orthodoxy. Yet, when we look more closely beneath the surface, we realize that some of the opposition to the creeds is due to our interpretation of them in medieval terms, not to the meaning their own time gave to them. The chief charac- teristic that links us to the age of creedal formation is our search for the fundamental principles of action. In civil matters this nation of ours, given far more than many others to acting on mere expediency, is demanding more and more the underlying theory of the various reforms. The rise of socialism and its growing favor among moder- ates is due largely to their demand for some central prin- ciple; and socialism is the nearest at hand. It is gaining strength to-day because it presents to all the various ed- dies of political life certain rather fixed theories. The ethical culture movement, also,-seemingly the work of those who exalt humanity far above all religious impulses, not believing even in prayer,-yet seeks some central prin- ciple as a basis for conduct. Even pragmatic ethics deals with questions of the nature of man and of the universe, rather than with what man does, or what will be the result of his actions. In all the philosophic study of ethics we are seeking general ideas and general methods. The search for general terms is shown also by the growing sci- entific study of morals. The more we study the history and nature of morality, the, less inclined is the philosopher to separate man as widely from the rest of the universe as does current orthodoxy. Even the interest in morality turns out to be not an interest in man, but in those forces which are working in man. History is taking more inter-</page><page sequence="13">214 INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ETHICS. est in the motives that govern great bodies of people than in the history of the leaders. We are turning from the concrete,-the price of food or the biography of a Na- poleon,-to the principles of economics or of the expan- sion of a great nation. The emphasis is being laid on the nature of things rather than on their action. The same movement from the concrete to the general is apparent among the liberal theologians. They are not now content with opposing or recasting separate articles of belief. Nor are they content to have the controversy center around the facts of history. The victory of the higher criticism and of evolution as regards matters of fact is won. Recent liberalism is demanding that theology be recast throughout. It is not content with attacking the concrete dogma; it is challenging the fundamental prin- ciples of belief. Likewise the insistence on a study of the nature of phenomena as they really are, which marks pragmatism, joins hands with the general theories of ideal- ism in forcing upon us the new science of the psychology of religion, which is also requiring that theology be re- constructed. The preoccupation with the concrete dogma, Calvinistic or Anglican or Protestant, is being lost in the pursuit of a larger subject. There is even a question whether there is such a thing as Christian theology as distinct from a general theory of religion. The problem is once more where it was for the Greeks. We are asking questions about the fundamental nature of existence, not simply about man's fate and man's part. With this renewed study of general problems has come a lessened insistence on the individual. As our civilization has grown more complex, the individual realizes that he counts for but one. The pendulum is swinging fast from the extreme of individualism. The modern rapid strides toward cooperation and union, which are influencing the separated denominations, are putting the wishes and beliefs of the individual far into the background. Our concern comes to be more with the organization and widespread forces than with the individual 's concern for himself. The</page><page sequence="14">LIBERALISM AND ORTHODOXY. 215 turn of the liberal from interest in individual salvation to corporate service is the parallel to the growing power of the nation and of the realization of duty to the nation. If salvation enters at all into our interest in the Cross, it is because the Cross represents a, general principle, the power of self-saci~ificing love. We connect it, as the Greeks did, with the rest of the universe, not separating and applying it only to man. Putting it simply, we are more concerned with the salvation of the world than with the salvation of our own soul. Our explanations are not the same as those of the Greeks; we have neither their theory of emanation nor of the Logos; but the effort is the same. We seek a reason in all reality, a reason or reasons that will give man his place; we do not seek to make the saving of the individual soul our only interest in the incarnation. In this we are far nearer to primitive orthodoxy than is the individualistic evangelism of the recent past. These two movements, the renewed interest in general principles, and the lessened emphasis on the individual, have brought to the front as the main problems of theology the necessity, first, of world explanation, and second, of world government. The scientist has always striven after the former. It is not surprising, therefore, that the period when this explanation was not sought was the period of the decline of science. The Greeks brought scientific method to a fair development, but. medievalism took more interest in the philosopher's stone and the elixir of life, and it was not until the day of modern liberalism that sci- ence again really came to its own. In this, also, the liberal of to-day is nearer to the Greek than is the traditional theology. Even the interest in morality, which seems, from its preoccupation with man, to join more closely to the medieval interest, is not to-day the interest, in chang- ing the world to unworldliness, nor in seeking to be saved out of it, but the concern with the problems of sociology. We ask not how to be saved from the world, but how to live in it. It is true that in the East the ascetic life was more developed than in the West, but for this very reason</page><page sequence="15">216 INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ETHICS. it had less influence on the non-aseetic world. The hermit of the East, withdrawn into the desert, affected the or- dinary life of the church less than did the monk of the West, living in close touch with the life of his time. For this reason Greek thought reflects the desire to escape from the world much less than does western thought. Protestants have not had the desire to go into seclusion, but the estimate of life that led to this they have had. The modern appreciation of all that life holds which marks the revolt from Puritanism is far more Greek than west- erm. Here again, as with the desire for explanation, the modern spirit is nearer the East than is western ortho- doxy. There is more to say, however, than simply that we are nearer to primitive thought. Being more in sympathy with it, those problems which it attacked we are attacking, and we have taken up its work, after the neglect of cen- turies, where the primitive church left off. The liberal of to-day, therefore, can claim not only to be primitive in his spirit; he can assume the larger role, and declare that through him runs the line of ancient orthodoxy; not that all modern orthodoxy is heretical and untrue, but that the main line of orthodox development leads not to orthodoxy, but to liberalism. The liberal of to-day is pay- ing homage once more to the subtle and able work of the Greeks on the conception of God. This doctrine has at last a chance of becoming a living truth, worked over and recast, and not simply a relic of the past stored away. Our answer to the question we put in the beginning is answered, and emphatically. True orthodoxy not only may be liberal, as we mean liberal; to be true to its prim- itive history it must be liberal. The liberal is the true orthodox. GEORGE ALEXANDER BARROW. CHELSEA, MASS.</page></plain_text>
