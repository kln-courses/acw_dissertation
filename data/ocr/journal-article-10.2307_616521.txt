Guilders 96.</page><page sequence="2">614 REVIEWS Assessment of 'Abd al-Jabbdr's speculative theology has proceeded apace for some 20 years now, since discovery and publication of his JMughni ft abwib al-tawhid wa 'l-'adl. That study of this work, as well as of the same author's Muh.it, Tanzih, Mutashlbih, Dald'il al-nubuwwa, and Usfl al-khamsa, is unlikely to result in the discovery of new and/or unexpected materials has been more or less acknowledged from the start. The possible exception: sectarian reports from the Dald'il (see Pines, Proc. Israel Academy of Sciences and Humanities, II, 13, 1966; and Stern, JTS, xvIII, 1, 1967; xix, 1, 1968) is, or at least was, a matter of acute controversy. What one has, justifiably, come to expect is, rather, a systematic compilation of Mu'tazili thought together with the recovery of some earlier expressions of that thought, hitherto accessible only in the polemic of Ash'arite theologians. Peters's study corroborates that expectation and makes a useful addition to the growing corpus of scholarship devoted to analysis of Muslim kaldm. By way of introduction (pp. 1-38): a bio- graphical sketch, to which is appended an outline of the contents of the Mughni, and the observation (pp. 37-8) that its seventh part is not so much a discussion of the createdness (khalq) of the Qur'dn, but rather, an argument for regarding all of God's speech, like all of His acts, as designed for the benefit of His creatures and thus necessarily good. It is the seventh part of the Mughni which is the apparent object of Peters's investigation. I say ' apparent ' since the greater part by far of the book (pp. 39-277) is devoted to analysis of 'Abd al-Jabbdr's 'philosophy' [sic], sub- divided under' Logic ', ' Cosmology ', 'Anthro- pology', and 'Theodicy'. The exposition is essentially lexical, being a discussion of philosophical concepts and their respective terminology based on comparison with identi- cal and similar terms employed elsewhere in the work of 'Abd al-Jabbdr. I cannot help but think the long section on 'Logic' (pp. 39-104) might have been more aptly entitled ' Episte- mology' and its contents collated with the nearly contemporary Us~il al-din of 'Abd al-Qahir Baghdddi. But Peters's work pro- vides a foundation for such comparison and is enhanced by an exhaustive 'Index of Arabic terms ' (pp. 431-8). Discussion of' The Qur'dn and God's other speech' (Mughni, part vii) is contained in pp. 278-402, and involves justify- ing the notion of reciprocity implicit in takl?f, according to which utterance of God's word presupposed existence of a creature to whom it could be addressed (summarized p. 402). In a final chapter (pp. 403-21) 'Abd al-Jabbdr's 'theology' [sic] is characterized as pheno- menal, intuitional, discursive, and, curiously, ' Islamic ', just possibly an allusion to the con- cluding apologia (p. 421) in support of the Mu'tazili renascence, presumably conjured to impede if not altogether to eliminate sclerosis. Resuscitation of 'Abd al-Jabbdr might thus be seen as a timely, perhaps even urgent, exercise. Now, the variety of theology propounded here depends upon a structural rationale, that is, an epistemological system all of whose components are logically and consistently explicable in terms of one another. An example is the relationship between revelation and miracle (pp. 95-102): what cannot be known either through necessary knowledge or acquired knowledge based on intuition must be learned from revelation, whose corroborating witness (miracle) must, however, be recognized by intuition. The essential nature of this process is argued (elsewhere: Tanzih al-Qur'dn ad Q 105) in the proposition that there can be no prophet without a miracle and no miracle with- out (attesting) a prophet (see my Quranic studies, p. 74, n. 2). Again, the discussion of creation/production (pp. 113-19: muhdath/ maf'iil/makhlq) is derived from the explicit assumption of analogy between descriptions of human and divine agency (on muhdath- makhliiq see Wolfson, in Joshua Bloch memorial volume, 1960). Incidentally, the section labelled ' Cosmology ' (pp. 105-58) might more accurately have been called' Ontology '; there is little connexion between the material retailed here and the traditional contents of Islamic cosmological treatises (e.g. Ibn Sina or Rasd'il Ikhwdn al-Safd'). In his discussion of God's speech Peters rightly stresses the fact (alluded to at the beginning of his work and above) that 'Abd al-Jabbdr deals with that subject (kalam alldh) not, as might be expected, under Unicity (tawhAfd) but rather, under Justice ('adl), not merely in the MughnI, but also in the Sharh usiil al-khamsa and in the Muhi.t (pp. 280, 285, 289). From the point of view of dogmatic formulation this is a matter of considerable importance, and makes rather more sense of the Mu'tazili position than is usually done. Traditional explanations of that position, e.g. fear of compromising tawhid, rejection of logos and/or dabar exegesis, pre- suppose a rather simplistic anthropomorphism on the part of their opponents (cf. Quranic studies, 77-84). Far more sophisticated would be dispute about whether God is constrained (mukallif-mukallaf) to utter directives for the benefit of His creatures: that is of course precisely what, according to 'normative' Islam, He is not. Furthermore, that speech can only be intelligible, thus of benefit, if its articulation is analogous to human speech, a requirement always (and not surprisingly) acknowledged by exegetes, but seldom by theologians. 'Abd al-Jabbdr's analogy is set out here in detail (pp. 293-384), from which its remarkable complexity is evident. In his refutation of the Ash'arite employment of analogy (pp. 364-9) he is himself compelled to reject that device (or what he would regard as its misuse) in respect of the argument from dumbness/silence: 'First: the argumentation of the opponents is entirely based on the supposition that the subject is speaking through an instrument; he can either make speech through it, or refrain from using it while it is nevertheless possible to use it, or even be prevented to use it by an inability or unsoundness that affected the instrument. Since God does not speak through instruments, this analogical reasoning is not possible'. Now, in this marvellous labyrinth of linguistic pilpul it would probably be unfair to detect inconsistency, though one must certainly</page><page sequence="3">REVIEWS 615 acknowledge that by the time of 'Abd al- Jabbdr his Ash'arite opponents had moved a considerable distance from their humble Hanbali origins.
