He also demonstrates that Barlach's individual use of language, far from being stylized and remote, represents a vigorous attack upon stereotyped expressions. Barlach does not negate life in his dramas, he is advocating a sharper awareness of life, and this is the purpose of the language he employs. In his penultimate chapter Professor Chick issues a timely warning about over- estimating literary influences on Barlach. He makes the point that Barlach's philosophy and the characters he created were derived more from everyday experience than from reading. In his final chapter the author gives an account of Barlach's unhappy relationship with the German theatre. He shows how most producers have labelled Barlach an expressionist and insisted on treating his plays as abstractions, omitting the realistic elements. Sometimes they have done this in order to be modish, and sometimes in order to disseminate their own personal philosophies. There are only minor criticisms to be made against this book. The author correctly rejects most previous interpretations in his treatment of Der arme Vetter, but his thesis that the businessman Siebenmark is a positive hero is an over- simplification. Siebenmark is no more than the embryo of characters like Calan and Boll in later plays who undergo a much more radical metamorphosis. Professor Chick also ignores his own warning about exaggerating literary influences on Barlach when he states on page 113: 'By calling the two main characters in his novel Wau and Wahl, Barlach points unmistakably to the brothers Walt and Vult in Die Flegeljahre'. The book has an adequate chronology of Barlach's life, a good index, and a select bibliography. Of particular value is the account of reviews that performances of Barlach's plays received both in his lifetime and afterwards. . A D. J. AsNDREWS GLASGOW Zur Lyrik Paul Celans. By PETER HORST NEUMANN. (Kleine Vandenhoeck-Reihe, 286-7) G6ttingen: Vandenhoeck &amp; Ruprecht. 1968. Ioo pp. DM 3.80. Wort-Konkordanz zur Lyrik Paul Celans. By PETER HORST NEUMANN. Miinchen: Fink. 1969. 134 PP. DM 19.80. Celan addresses a varying audience, sometimes the poet's other self, sometimes the dead, sometimes the word, and sometimes even God; it is, therefore, improper to demand that each poem be explicit. On the other hand, in spite of its deceptive 'openness' caused by the nature of its metaphors, it is impossible to understand Celan's poetry without knowing the assumptions and associations on which it is based. There are two main themes running through it; that is to say it springs from two experiences which are, in the last analysis, one: the murder of his entire family in the calculated extermination of East European Jewry by the Germans under Hitler and the limitation of linguistic communication; the latter may well stem from the fact that Celan's mother tongue, the basis of his poetic language, is German. For Celan all common points of reference with the past have been swept away, with the result that he has perforce adopted an esoteric mode of utterance and gradually created from his experience as an exile and from his linguistic isolation his own world of symbols. A guide of the undogmatic calibre of Professor Neumann is essential: in his short and illuminating critical study, which deals with the five lyric collections from Mohn und Geddchtnis (I952) to Atemwende (I967), new beauties and connexions are revealed by means of a careful assessment of Celan's progressive use of different metaphors. Celan's metaphorical language explores possible experience by word-association of such a personal kind- 'Umstruktuierung der Normalsprache</page><page sequence="2">zur Dichtersprache' Professor Neumann calls it (p. Io) -that its significance can only be assessed truly if the whole body of his poetry is kept in mind. To help us in the teasing and rewarding task of working out the riddles presented by most of Celan's poems Professor Neumann has now published the word-concordance he prepared whilst writing his book; it provides in particular the basis for the opening two chapters. But his book does far more; for Celan is a learned poet, and a knowledge of many languages and literatures, as well as an acquaintance with the biological sciences, is a prerequisite for any elucidation of the poems; Professor Neumann devotes a long chapter to Celan's personal involvement with Jewish destiny and tradition and also gives detailed information about literary, historical, geographical, and personal references for many poems. In his opening chapter he discusses the kind of compounds created by Celan, whose anthropomorphic landscape is marked out by such directional adverbs as herzlinienhin, schriftfern, and blutabwdrts, and he shows how participles like umsommert, wundgeheilt, and weltherzdurchgliiht, depend on metaphors either assumed or already occurring in earlier poems. The increase in compounds is a corollary to an increasing terseness - in Celan's latest collection there is a poem consisting of two lines (Fadensonnen, p. 64); the sparseness of base-words demands a continuous creation of new compounds, which are employed in one context only and never repeated. The word-concordance includes compounds under the base-words and in the usual alphabetical positions, for example Sandkornritt appears under Korn and Ritt as well as after sandig. Celan's philological virtuosity is shown in the discussion of his dismemberment of the word Menschen, producing Men (English 'men') and Schen (Chinese 'shen'), both giving the meaning 'Menschen' (Niemands- rose, p. 35), a linguistic feat annihilating the distinction between sense and nonsense, between harmony and disunity; by similar distortions, such as wann ... Wahn and dies ... Dis-/parates (Niemandsrose, p. 73), the poet is shown at the utmost limits of human language; by the inspired resuscitation of Middle High German ihten, 'to create something from nothing' (Atemwende, p. Io3) he enacts linguistically God's first creation (see pp. 24 if.). The important second chapter deals with certain key symbols: 'Kriige', suggest- ing the region of shade and death, a word of anti-life, Professor Neumann associates with Latin urna, but it is also possible that Celan has in mind the 'Kabiren' of Goethe's Faust II (v. 8074 ff. and 8219 f.), mysterious Greekjar-shaped self-procreat- ing deities, or even the canopic jars of Ancient Egypt, which held the viscera of the pharaohs (see Mohn und Geddchtnis, p. 54). The word 'Mandel', recalling the almond- eyes of the Jews, Professor Neumann terms 'die augen-, die tranenf6rmige, die steinerne Frucht' (p. 3 I) enshrining the bitterness of the Jewish experience and the poet's own identification with it; by association with this word Celan links his own destiny with that of the Jewish poet Mandelstamm, whose fate was in many ways similar to Celan's: he was murdered by the Russians during the Stalin era. The concept of the almond with its bitter centre is subjected to a wider mystical interpretation, for at its heart is the 'nichts', the 'niemand', but at the same time 'etwas' and 'jemand', 'der K6nig', who exists by the very act of seeking; thus the 'Mandel'-image is a symbol of Messianic hope through the word. In Chapter Three Celan's rare references to the Jewish myth of the Golem are discussed (see Jiemandsrose, p. 40), a creature shaped from clay by human hand and given life by means of the name of God, a symbol of something created from nothing through the word, 'ein blihendes Nichts' (p. 54). The subject of political commitment is discussed in Chapter Four: Professor Neumann points out that Celan's poetry would be unthinkable unrelated to the fate of the Jews (p. 67); for this reason 'Todesfuge' (Mohn und Geddchtnis, p. 37) written in 1945, 'das Jahr nul', is a noble and terrible lament far removed from the Reviews 7I4</page><page sequence="3">Reviews 7I5 level of specific political accusation, whereas 'Einem Bruder in Asien' (Akzente (Dezember 1967), p. 485) fails precisely because it is specifically political and unmetaphorical. Celan succeeds when he links his own experience with that of suffering humanity in general: in 'Schibboleth' (Von Schwelle zu Schwelle, p. 55 f.) the defeat of the Spanish Republicans by Franco and the occupation of Austria by Hitler are fused in one vision; Professor Neumann shows how specific political events have here become true poetic metaphors for all human suffering under tyranny (p. 58 if.). The final chapter, 'Mystische Paradoxie' deals with the concepts 'Wort' and 'Sprache' and the polarity of their relationship to 'Eis' and 'Schnee', the latter symbolizing the realm of silence ('Schweigen'); here 'Kristall' represents the goal of absolute truth lying somewhere between. In Sprachgitter (I959) a new concept, 'Atem', common to both 'Sprache' and 'Schweigen', suggests a means or way towards truth; 'Wahrheit', as a 'Wurfholz', comes 'auf Atemwegen'; Professor Neumann puts it this way: 'Sie (die mystische Dichtung) begreift ihre Utopie als unerreichbare Transzendenz und wirft sich ihr doch in messianischer Hoffnung entgegen' (p. 78): it is therefore appropriate that the word 'Wahrheit' appear in a, for Celan, astonishingly direct statement: Ein Drohnen: es ist die Wahrheit selbst unter die Menschen getreten mitten ins Metapherngestober. (Atemwende, p. 85) Such an expression as 'Strahlenwind deiner Sprache' confirms the suggestion that truth appears in an unheralded pentecostal flash; this hope for an immediate password is subtly demonstrated in Professor Neumann's analysis of the poem 'Give the Word' (Atemwende, p. 89), where truth for King Lear may lie ultimately and paradoxically in Cordelia's silence (pp. 86 ff.). This study of an extraordinarily elusive and difficult subject is profound, illuminat- ing, economical, and unpretentious; discussion progresses from example to example, by analysis of detail to a satisfying general view of the development of Celan's poetic vision and use of language. As is to be expected, Professor Neumann in his final chapters is not easy to follow, but for anyone who wishes to read Celan's poetry with a deeper insight his book is of prime importance. Last year, in remarkably quick succession to Atemwende (1967), Celan published a new collection, Fadensonnen (I968); as its title, which derives from the opening line of a poem of the former collection, suggests, only threads of light illuminate the bemusing wilderness of seemingly disconnected words: . . . es sind noch Lieder zu singen jenseits der Menschen. (Atemwende, p. 22) Many of the poems break new ground and suggest new metaphorical associations, but the gap between arbitrary nonsense and poetry of the highest order seems to be narrowing; the poet appears to display a sovereign, even humorous, disdain for any cumbrous technique of interpretation one may use in attempting to follow his nimble leaps from one semantic foothold to the next, frequently swooping to the brink of dementia. Indeed, this collection has nonplussed some German reviewers: Wie vom Computer gesteuert stehen die Worter in einem schwer durchschaubaren Sinn- zusammenhang ... Teamarbeit von Tiefenpsychologen und intuitiv begabten Germanisten</page><page sequence="4">kann vielleicht manches Gedicht aufhellen und Symbole deuten. (Erich Lotz, Universitas, 24 (I969), 92) Wo das Wort nur im Rahmen eines mit dem Gedicht selbst nicht mitgelieferten Systems 'spricht', biiBt das Wort an Kraft ein oder kann keine sich aneignen. (Rudolf Hartung, 'An der Grenze zum Schweigen', Die Zeit, 22 November I968) Professor Neumann's book, with its perceptive exposition of Celan's 'system', and his word-concordance, in spite of its rather high price, should be required reading for those in a like quandry. Wilhelm Busch in prophetic parody of Celan's decompounding technique declares: Jeder weil3, was so ein Mai- Kafer fiir ein Vogel sei. (Max und Moritz) but we need all the help we can get to discover what is intended by a 'Gedanken- kaifer' (Atemwende, p. 42), let alone a 'Maikafertraum' (Fadensonnen, p. 8). CARDIFF GEORGE T. GILLESPIE Nordische Barockdichtung. Eine Darstellung und Deutung skandinavischer Dichtung zwischen Reformation und Aufklirung. By WILHELM FRIESE. Bern: Francke. I968. 320 pp. 82 Sw.Fr. Seventeenth-century Scandinavian literature is, for understandable reasons, rela- tively unknown outside the Scandinavian countries. Development in these countries was late, due to their location off the cultural main-roads of Europe. Not until Holberg and Swedenborg do Denmark and Sweden produce any writers of European standard. On this account, there is great reason for scholars in Scandi- navia to welcome the present work on seventeenth-century literature in Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland, made by their German colleague, Dr Wilhelm Friese. Dr Friese does not make comparison between Scandinavian and Central European literature, however. His concern is to suggest a definition of the concept of baroque and apply it to Scandinavian literature. He concludes that baroque cannot be identified with the Counter Reformation (in which case it would be impossible to speak of baroque in Scandinavia), that a strong church and absolute government are typical of baroque, that baroque involves more than an epoch of style, and that a juxtaposition of sociological and stylistical criteria is required (pp. 7 ff.). Dr Friese begins with a survey of society and intellectual life in seventeenth- century Scandinavia. In Denmark the aristocracy gradually loses its power. The middle classes gain considerable influence, and with their support absolute monarchy is constituted in I66o. Sweden, on the other hand, is dominated by the aristocracy during the greater part of the century. Until Charles XI in the I68os established himself as an absolute ruler, the social structure remains the same. Religious life is characterized by orthodox beliefs. The idea of order is the govern- ing principle in every field. After a brief introduction of the most important writers and their works, Dr Friese analyses the formal structure. A strictly disciplined form, using rhetorical precepts and patterns, is considered to be a major characteristic of Scandinavian baroque literature. In the last section of the book, Dr Friese discusses the function of literature in society. To a very great extent, the literary works of the period are written for a courtly audience.
