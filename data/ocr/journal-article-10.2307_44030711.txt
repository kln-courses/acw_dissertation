<plain_text><page sequence="1">Both Life of Pi and A Strange Manuscript Found in a Copper Cylinder juxtapose the narrative of a castaway's experiences with the later telling of the tale. Exploring the limits of "story," they present fantastic narratives that trespass upon credulity and that require - but do not always receive - a leap of narrative faith. The Limits of the Story: Reading the Castaway Narrative in A Strange Manuscript Found in a Copper Cylinder and Life of Pi DANIELA JANES Samuel Ancient with an Taylor Doctrine epigraph Coleridge's Concerning from 1817 Thomas the edition Origin Burnet of of The Things, s Rime Archaeologiae published of the Ancient in Philosophiae 1692) Mariner that begins makes ( The Samuel with an epigraph from Thomas Burnet s Archaeologiae Philosophiae ( The Ancient Doctrine Concerning the Origin of Things, published in 1692) that makes a case for belief in things that cannot be seen or proven. Faith itself, here framed explicitly in terms of belief in "invisible" beings, is valorized for the way it expands the human experience of being in the world, allowing "the soul to contemplate as in a pic- ture the image of a larger and better world, lest the mind, habituated to the small con- cerns of daily life, limit itself too much and sink entirely into trivial thinking" (qtd. in Coleridge, Rime 567). Coleridges supernatural poem then opens with a framing nar- rative rooted firmly within the constraints of daily life, as the Wedding Guest approaches the scene of the celebration only to be arrested in his path by the "skinny hand" (9) of the Mariner. This rootedness in the real world contrasts the spectral and supernatural possibilities in the Mariner's tale, a narrative in which "invisible" beings are rendered terrifyingly visible. In Coleridge's text, the realism of the frame narrative Mosaic 46/4 0027- 1 276-07/ 1 09 1 26$02.00©Mosaic</page><page sequence="2">110 Mosaic 46/4 (December 2013) and the fantastical status of the embedded narrative the Mariner relates to the Wedding Guest together create an internal tension that foregrounds the ambivalence of interpretation itself. The epigraph, importantly, makes a case for the value of belief, even as the embedded narrative challenges the Wedding Guest's credulity. Similar tensions between the frame narrative and the embedded narrative, between the world of the real and the world of the fantastic, are established in two Canadian castaway narratives published more than a century apart: James De Milled A Strange Manuscript Found in a Copper Cylinder and Yann Martel's Life of Pi.1 Sharing affinities with other maritime journey stories, including The Rime of the Ancient Mariner and The Odyssey ; and with other narratives of shipwrecks and castaways, like Defoe's Robinson Crusoe and Poes The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket , the two Canadian texts find their place in a larger literary tradition of adventures at sea. However, like Coleridge's poem, A Strange Manuscript and Life of Pi function on a second level as well. In addition to the primary narrative, which focuses on the cast- away's subjective and shifting perceptions of his perilous journey, there exists a sec- ond narrative level in which the story is read or listened to sometime after the main action has concluded. Through this double-narrative strategy, De Mille's text provides a proto-postmodern foray into questions of narration and of reading, as Janice Kulyk Keefer (130) and Linda Lamont-Stewart (34) have both observed, while Martel's text offers a postmodern meditation on the very nature of story. The novels focus, then, both thematically and formally, on storytelling and reception, as each makes use of a frame narrative in which multiple readers or interlocutors engage with the first-hand narrative of the castaway-narrator and must weigh the story, demonstrating either a capacity for the "willing suspension of disbelief" (Coleridge, Biographia 6) or a rejec- tion of the story. Both novels explore and test the limits of the story by presenting fan- tastic narratives that trespass upon credulity, and that require - but do not always receive - a leap of narrative faith. If Life of Pi stages the power of the story as some- thing that could "make you believe in God" (viii) (locating power within the story- teller to act upon the reader), A Strange Manuscript allows for the possibility of renunciation: of the reader simply closing the book, and walking away (locating power within the reader). The central formal device that links De Mille's and Martel's novels is their deploy- ment of framing narratives in which the main story is listened to or read by one or several embedded interlocutors. The effect is of a mise en abyme, of texts embedded within texts, of readings inside the narratives anticipating or challenging the readings that occur outside of the text. The embedded readers engage in the work of unpacking textual meaning and determining "truth," as both novels set forth the fantastic events</page><page sequence="3">Daniela Janes 111 that have befallen the castaway- narrators. Framing these embedded textual con- sumers as interlocutors deliberately foregrounds the active interpretive role that both texts assign to their listener or reader characters. As Roland Barthes notes in his dis- tinction between lisible (readerly) and scriptable (writerly) texts, "the goal of literary work (of literature as work) is to make the reader no longer a consumer but a pro- ducer of the text" (44). The writerly text thus simultaneously conscripts and frees the reader to become a creator of textual meaning. The embedded listeners' dialogue with the storyteller or with the manuscript draws attention to the collaborative work of producing meaning, carefully framing both the embedded and external readers as mutually engaged in the labour of interpretation. Noting the relationship between embedded and frame narratives, Mieke Bal observes postmodernism^ "special preference for the use of mirror- text" (71) because the relationship between multiple textual levels allows for meta-narrative self-reflexivity. BaPs comments emerge from her discussion of Bakhtinian dialogism, a "dialogue" which Bal frames as "a metaphor that underscores the heterogeneity of discourse" (69). As Bakhtin observes in "Discourse in the Novel," all discourse is inherently dia- logic. Describing a living network of language, Bakhtin notes, "On all its various routes toward the object, in all its directions, the word encounters an alien word and cannot help encountering it in a living, tension-filled interaction." While the figure of the castaway approximates Bakhtin's "mythical Adam," who alone may be said to "[approach] a virginal and as yet verbally unqualified world with the first word" (279), the castaway approaches terra nova through the lens of previous experiences and encounters with language, place, and custom. Thus, each new encounter, whether with an adult Bengal tiger or with a hitherto unknown race of death-worshipping cannibals, is filtered and framed by the castaway-narrator's conventional expecta- tions, codes, and discourse. There are no "first word[s]" and no virgin territory; there is only the application of known language to new material and circumstances. Further, when the raw experience of the castaway is shaped into narrative form, it is beholden to conventional modes of representation and to the storytellers anticipa- tion that his story will encounter a particular kind of reader or listener. Dialogism foregrounds ideals of reciprocity and exchange that occur at intra- textual, inter-textual, and extra-textual levels; however, Michael André Bernstein sug- gests that the notion of a Great Dialogue is "abstract" and "idealized" (200), and that it fails to take into account the potential perverseness of the interlocutor; it fore- grounds mutual interest and respect, while at the same time it elides a range of poten- tial responses, including disbelief, contempt, and even interruption. Similarly, in "On Style," Susan Sontag notes the "peculiar dependence of a work of art, however expres-</page><page sequence="4">112 Mosaic 46/4 (December 2013) sive, upon the cooperation of the person having the experience, for one may see what is 'said' but remain unmoved, either through dullness or distraction" (22). Sontag's framing of the art object as one not separate from or independent of the observer, but rather profoundly dependent upon the cooperation and engagement of the observer, dovetails with the relationship between storyteller and story-consumer that both texts stage. While the novels are formally dialogic, engaging the multiple narrative levels in conversation, neither text seems convinced that dialogue leads naturally and unequiv- ocally to a shared and mutual understanding. The texts create complex heteroglossic environments that allow for writer-reader interactivity, even while foregrounding the possible rejection of the story. Pi Patel, the protagonist of Martels novel, asks two early interlocutors, "Doesn't the telling of something always become a story?" (335). Pi's awareness of the inevitable gap between unmediated experience and the narrating of that experience foregrounds the constructed nature of histories, the limitations of language, and the vital role played by the embedded listener to help the storyteller surmount these lim- itations. Considering this gap between event and narration, Raimonda Modiano observes of Coleridge's poem that it "does not offer an objective account of an adven- turous voyage at the time when it originally occurred, but merely a later version of that voyage told by an old and lonely man who can neither explain nor fully describe what happened to him" (41, emph. Modiano's). While the Wedding Guest is initially an unwilling listener, held against his will by the power of the Mariner's "glittering eye" (13), it is clear, as Modiano argues, that the Mariner "desperately needs the Wedding Guest," since his narrative depends upon the embedded listener's "continuous atten- tion" (47). In this reading, the unwilling listener is denied the power to walk away, but also possesses a paradoxical agency in that his presence is essential and constitutive of the story; the narrative cannot exist in his absence. The Mariner, too, becomes a fig- ure of ambivalence: he possesses a control over his embedded listener that is at odds with his own self-fashioning as a figure of narrative compulsion who can only be relieved by telling his "ghastly tale" (584). While De Mille and Martel's novels foreground interpretation, they also allow for the possibility that a single tale may produce multiple readings. The texts' hermeneu- tic self-consciousness echoes that of The Rime of the Ancient Mariner, in which the Mariner proscriptively offers his interpretation of the meaning of his story: He prayeth best, who loveth best All things both great and small; For the dear God who loveth us, He made and loveth all. (614-17)</page><page sequence="5">Daniela Janes 113 The Mariner's interpretation fails to account for the gothic ambivalence of the embedded narrative in its haste to offer the Wedding Guest a simple tale of trans- gression, repentance, and penance through storytelling. While the Wedding Guest is left a "sadder and a wiser man" (624) for hearing the Mariner's tale, the external reader may stumble in interpretive darkness, wrestling with the poem's ambiguities; the moral clarity and starkness of the Mariner's interpretation is thus undermined by the external reader's lingering sense of its insufficiency. This sense of hermeneutic frustration is echoed by the textual gloss that Coleridge added to the 1817 edition of the poem. If we read the gloss as a paratextual layer or as another frame, written in the voice of a scholarly dramatis personae searching for elusive meaning with the poem, it offers us nothing less than a discourse upon flawed exegesis. The narrator of the gloss becomes simply another reader struggling to determine textual meaning. A focusing Strange Manuscript on four English Found gentlemen in a Copper aboard Cylinder a pleasure begins cruise. with a The frame yacht narrative Falcon focusing on four English gentlemen aboard a pleasure cruise. The yacht Falcon , belonging to the foppish young Lord Featherstone, is becalmed in the Atlantic Ocean between the Madeira and the Canary Islands, and the men are restlessly in search of some diversion. Like the Mariner's becalmed vessel, the Falcon is "As idle as a painted ship / Upon a painted ocean" (117-18). Critics such as Kenneth Hughes and Stephen Milnes have made much of the metaphor of the "ship of state," reading the stationary vessel as a metaphor for a decadent, anti-progressive society, while Karyn Huenemann suggests the text opens "the very foundations of Victorian culture" to interrogation, including the "imperialist project" itself (194). Maggie Kilgour notes the boat is the staging ground for no action other than "the conspicuous consumption of time, money, and food" (25). Indeed, the ship's name, Falcon , with its active and predatory connotations, serves as an ironic contrast to the languid yachtsmen who appear to have no other goal than the temporary relief of their boredom. Not simply a power- ful critique of class privilege, the frame interrogates waste: wasted intellect, time, resources, and opportunities. While Dr. Congreve's title, and his dual role as Featherstone's "friend and medical attendant" (47), suggest that he possesses an active profession, the other men are framed as idlers, their learning, intelligence, and skills put not to the service of society but to the pursuit of their own pleasures. They con- sume rather than produce. Featherstone and his three guests are in a state of "indolent repose," as the ship lies becalmed at sea. Featherstone, the representative colonialist, lies in an Indian hammock with "a novel in his hand, which he was pretending to read" (47). Before the structure of the novel makes clear the role of these four men as the embedded</page><page sequence="6">114 Mosaic 46/4 (December 2013) readers of the titular manuscript, we witness the feigned reading of an unidentified novel, a book which exists, in its very anonymity, solely as a physical object, devoid of both author and reader. Further to this, just as no one is reading during this time of calm, no one is writing. There is plenty of paper available, but Melick, the most ener- getic man aboard the Falcon , is busy transforming these coloured pages into paper boats. The purpose, he tells Featherstone, is "to have a regatta. [. . .] Anything to kill time, you know" (48). The regatta of the little paper boats concludes with the discov- ery of the floating copper cylinder that effectively disrupts the languor aboard the Falcon. The purpose of the regatta ("to kill time") anticipates the purpose of the men's reading, which is figured as similarly diverting. The men begin by identifying the cylinder as "foreign" in make, and speculating that the cylinder contains meat, provisions from Noah's ark, or possibly liquor (50- 51). There is, thus, the clear expectation of some consumable content within the cylinder. When several energetic blows of the axe reveal the contents to be two pack- ages containing papyrus-like papers, the men's expectations must be readjusted. As William New observes, De Mille's focus in the novel "shifts from the narrative itself to the processes of constructing narrative, and the equally problematic processes of interpretation" (101). The four embedded readers foreground their own interpretive work, while those outside of the text replicate this exegetical process. While Gwendolyn Guth observes that "the curious frame does not 'explain' More's manu- script," she argues that it does something perhaps even more significant: it emphasizes the reader's own interpretive acts (40). While the title of the novel focuses on a singular manuscript, it is not the only embedded text. The men begin by opening the smaller package, revealing several sheets of writing. The document is a letter, reproduced in English, French, and German, addressed "To the finder of this" (53). The letter writer presumes a recipro- cal relationship between writer and reader, constructing his ideal reader as a repre- sentative of "civilized" humanity. The implied reader is one who, the writer hopes, will accede to his request: "Oh, unknown friend! whoever you are, I entreat you to let this message be made known in some way to my father, Henry More, Keswick, Cumberland, England, so that he may learn the fate of his son" (54). The manuscript, we are told, is only secondarily intended for the reader who finds it. Its main reader is to be Henry More, Englishman. And, significantly, the novel concludes without any effort being made to advise Henry More about the fate of his son. The embedded readers ultimately fail in a material way to respond to the textual imperative, demon- strating the recalcitrant reader's capacity for both rebellion against and renunciation of the text.</page><page sequence="7">Daniela Janes 115 Adam More, his readers learn, had been a sailor aboard the British ship, Trevelyatiy transporting convicts to Van Diemen's Land. His manuscript identifies the year as 1843, a significant date, as it coincides with the end of Arctic explorer John Franklin's tenure as Lieutenant-Governor of Van Diemen's Land. In 1845, Franklin would embark upon his famous last journey to chart the Northwest Passage, so that by the time the four men aboard the Falcon are reading the manuscript in 1850 (47), energetic efforts were already underway to determine the fate of Franklin's lost ships. More's own misadventures begin when he and his crewmate, Agnew, against the urg- ing of their captain, leave their becalmed vessel to hunt seals, fail to notice the rising bad weather, and are borne far away from their ship by strong ocean currents. When More and Agnew stumble upon the emaciated remains of a sailor during their mis- adventures in the Antarctic it seems to foretell their own probable fate. More goes through the pockets of the sailor, looking for documents that may identify him and discovers a letter from the dead sailor's wife. The letter from Polley Reed stands as a significant counterpart to More s own letter and manuscript, as both documents are found and read by someone other than their intended reader. While More may be seen as a dubious hero, even perhaps a fool at other moments in the novel, here he shows a capacity for sincere feeling and deep perception: he unfolds the letter "with great care" and observes the "visible signs of long and frequent perusals, and marks, too, which looked as though made by tears - tears, perhaps, of the writer, perhaps of the reader: who can tell?" (64). More suggests here that the reader leaves a physical mark upon the text. He reframes the letter as a kind of palimpsest in which the act of writing and the multiple acts of reading are layered together. The indeterminate ori- gin of the tears that have marked the page testify to this sense of textual interactivity. More, who had begun by reading the letter aloud to Agnew, is forced to stop as "a lump in [his] throat" impedes him. Instead, the two men read together, and in silence. It is the letter rather than the body alone that seems to spur the men to action. Agnew asks, "Do you remember any of the burial service?" and More notes, "I understood his meaning at once" (65). The impromptu burial of the sailor demonstrates the power of a common text, here The Book of Common Prayer. The ceremonial act of burying Tom Reed does the men good, as Agnew says (23), because it reconfirms their shared values and implies a mutual understanding that links the dead man with those who read and respond to the textual imperative of his body. This short episode at the outset of More's adventures models an idealized rela- tionship between writer and reader, demonstrating the power of the text to convert the reader or listener. Knowing what kind of reader More himself is, we may expect that his own manuscript will fall upon a similarly receptive set of readers. If the</page><page sequence="8">116 Mosaic 46/4 (December 2013 ) humane burial of Tom Reed, with its recapitulation of Western European and Christian values, reminds Adam More of the spiritual life that awaits him beyond the earthly life, we may expect the men's reading of the manuscript to have a similarly conversionary effect. It does not, however. Mores manuscript has found a motley set of readers whose responses range from skepticism (Melick, for example, suggests the text is an elaborate hoax to launch a sensational novel upon the world), through enthusiastic endorsement (from Oxenden and Congreve, who support the linguistic, botanical, geological, and paleontological evidence within the manuscript), to near indifference from Lord Featherstone. As the men begin to read the manuscript, Melick exclaims, "Why, it'll take a month to read all this" (54). In fact, they spend only two days reading the manuscript, breaking up the reading to take their meals and pick apart the textual details. Building on this, a central motif in the text is cannibalism, or, more generally, the threat of being consumed. Kilgour describes cannibalism as "the image of absolute difference," transgressing "the strict boundary that divides the civilized from the sav- age, the human from the monstrous" (20). Cannibalism acts as a parallel to other forms of consumption, including the act of reading itself, and foregrounds the texts' self-reflexive engagement with the question of what it means to read or hear a story, what it means to consume or to be consumed. If, as Kilgour argues, A Strange Manuscript reveals an "affinity between criticism and cannibalism" (23), we may refig- ure the embedded reader-critics (as well as those outside of the text) as potentially monstrous figures, rather than assigning the role solely to the cannibalistic race of Kosekins. There is a clear correspondence between the literal acts of consumption aboard the Falcon as the men take their meals and their metaphoric consumption and digestion of the text. More refers to cannibalism as an "unspeakable" horror (145), suggesting that it evades narrative articulation. It is, however, a writable horror. More expresses an understandable terror of ending up on the sacrificial slab; however, he is not terrified so much of death as of being consumed. If we make the connection, then, between the embedded writer character and his text-as-body, we may see that More evades literal sacrifice and consumption among the Kosekin but cannot escape metaphoric consumption by his readers. The surprising - and, for some, maddening - end of A Strange Manuscript, which infamously concludes with Featherstone yawn- ing, setting aside the text, and calling for supper, leaving the reading of the manuscript perpetually unfinished, suggests the insufficiency of More's text to provide metaphoric nourishment for at least this one embedded reader. Featherstone, a figure of chronic appetite, is left unsatisfied by the text, and the reader is, arguably, left hun- gry as well.</page><page sequence="9">Daniela Janes 117 M as artel's I was Life hungry of Pi opens " (v). with As in the A writer-narrator's Strange Manuscript, declaration, we enter " This the book textual was world born as I was hungry " (v). As in A Strange Manuscript, we enter the textual world through a framing narrative, here titled "Author's Note," focusing on a writer figure that exists as a kind of double for Martel himself. The embedded Martel-like writer character finds himself literally and metaphorically adrift: he has gone to India to write his second novel after his first one has fizzled away to a lackluster reception. However, the planned novel fails to come to life; he realizes that "An element is miss- ing , that spark that brings to life a real story. [. . .] The discovery is something soul- destroying, I tell you. It leaves you with an aching hunger " (vii). The writer abandons his novel and instead finds himself wandering in the town of Pondicherry, in south- eastern India. At the Indian Coffee House he shares a table with a white haired man named Francis Adirubasamy, who declares, "I have a story that will make you believe in God" (viii). Stewart Cole notes that this "conversion" is predicated upon a prior condition of non-belief, remarking that "the narrator's response, 'That's a tall order' (ix), seems to confirm" his status as a non-believer (22). The opening frame thus accomplishes two distinct things: it identifies hunger with the lack of stories, and it defines this appetite in spiritual rather than material terms. The "Author's Note" is also polemical in its ambitions, ending with a declaration that "we, citizens " must pro- vide material support to our writers; if we do not, then, according to the Martel-like writer, " we sacrifice our imagination on the altar of crude reality and we end up believ- ing in nothing and having worthless dreams " (xi). The stakes are clearly high: to read the right story, in the right spirit, or risk a form of terrible idolatry (the worship of " crude reality"). Here the merits of faith are measured against the perceived taint of material secularism. As in Coleridge's epigraph from Burnet, the threat of habituating "the mind [. . .] to the small concerns of daily life" is measured against the potential expansion of the soul that comes from exercising belief and imagination. If the "Author's Note" foregrounds the struggle of the aspiring novelist to find the right story, the act of writing is still a limited one, contingent upon finding the right kind of reader. As the sage Adirubasamy cautions the embedded writer who listens to his tale (and, by extension, the readers outside of the narrative), " You must pay proper attention " (ix), a warning never given to Lord Featherstone and his fellow interlocu- tors in A Strange Manuscript. We may recall those references to the writer's first novel in the opening paragraph of Life of Pi: "Reviewers were puzzled, or damned it with faint praise. Then readers ignored it. [. . .] The book did not move" (v). In the view of the embedded author, the novel that bewilders its reviewers and is rejected by its potential readers is not the result of a failure of narrative but rather a failure of the readers who cannot make the sympathetic leap to understand it. The phrasing, it "did</page><page sequence="10">118 Mosaic 46/4 (December 2013 ) not move" (v), refers to merchandise moving off the shelf, but is also suggestive of a metaphoric stillbirth. His first novel ends, as A Strange Manuscript does, with renunciation. Life of Pi is divided into three unequal parts. The first part shifts between the point of view of an adult Pi implicitly narrating his story to the writer figure, inter- spersed with a series of short, anecdotal observations that the writer makes on Pi's appearance, disposition, home, cooking, and family life. It is the Martel-like writer who ends Part One with the reassurance that "This story has a happy ending " (103), undercutting narrative tension and encouraging the reader to focus attention on the process of storytelling rather than on the narrative outcome. The second part consists of "the story." It is written from the first-person point of view of Pi Patel and elimi- nates the textual intrusions of the writer character. While Part One foregrounds the process of the writer learning Pi's story, Part Two emphasizes the immediacy of Pi's first-hand experiences and his own subjectivity. While it may be read as the story that the writer crafts based on the material he has gleaned from his earlier interviews with Pi, rather than a transcription (of which we have an example, by way of contrast, in Part Three), the dominant feature in this section is Pi's distinctive voice as he appears to tell his own story in his own words. In the final section, Pi is interviewed by two representatives from the Japanese Ministry of Transport about the sinking of the Japanese registered cargo ship Tsimtsum aboard which he was travelling. Martel plays with language here, using typography to illustrate the multiple conversations taking place, in English between Pi and the officials, and in Japanese between the two offi- cials. Here, translation, too, becomes a metaphor for understanding or for potential misunderstanding. The conversational model emphasizes ideals of reciprocity since the success of the telling of the tale is dependent upon a receptive interlocutor. As Coleridge's Mariner frames this narrative imperative, he asserts, That moment that his face I see, I know the man that must hear me: To him my tale I teach. (588-90) While the Mariner describes the relationship between the one compelled to tell and the one compelled to listen to the story, Pi finds his own listeners are unable or unwill- ing to hear the story and believe it. Consequently, he shifts from a narrative mode to a rhetorical mode, and uses the language of religious faith to persuade his listeners of the value of narrative faith. He exhorts them, "Love is hard to believe, ask any lover. Life is hard to believe, ask any scientist. God is hard to believe, ask any believer. What</page><page sequence="11">Daniela Janes 119 is your problem with hard to believe?" (330). As Gregory Stephens observes, Pi's story offers "a meditation on the problematical nature of believability itself" (50, emph. Stephens's). Pi challenges his embedded listeners to overcome their skepticism and accept the story he has told. The thematic focus on language bookends the novel, appearing in the conversa- tion with the Japanese officials at the end, and in the opening pages of the novel in a small reference to linguistic variation in the global English language. Here, the Martel- like writer recalls the single piece of advice he is given before embarking on his first trip to India (a trip undertaken some time before the writing trip to India during which he meets Adirubasamy): a friend casually advises him that a "funny English " is spoken in India; " They like words like bamboozle" (v). We are told that this one piece of information " served [him] well " on his first trip. Quizzing a local railway employee, he says, "I didn't think the fare would be so expensive. You re not trying to bamboozle me, are you?" The response ("No sir! There is no bamboozlement here") suggests that the writer has managed to transcend the language divide and make himself properly understood (vi). Extending this claim further, we might note that bamboozlement, too, is predicated upon a trade in false narratives and suggests the risk or fear of being duped. The warning against bamboozlement applies not just to train tickets, but to everything, it seems, including narrative itself. The Japanese officials' anxiety about the nature of the story speaks to this fear of being swindled by narrative, cheated out of their dignity by believing too easily. Part of what makes the story with animals "the better story" is that it poses a challenge to credulity, which it then overcomes. After hearing Pi's story, Mr. Chiba and Mr. Okamoto react with skepticism; conversing in Japanese, Mr. Okamoto declares, "he thinks we're fools" (324). According to the men, to believe the story is to be made a fool, to be, in a word, bamboozled. They query the details of Pi's narrative, much like the embedded readers in A Strange Manuscript, measuring with the tools of science the plausibility of the narrative. While More's readers, like Oxenden and Congreve, present scientific, linguistic, and paleontological evidence to support the credibility of More's narrative to the more skeptical Melick, Pi's embedded listeners are not so encyclopedic in their knowledge. Some elements of the story may be tested, though, even within the limits of the Mexican hospital where Pi is convalescing. Determining whether bananas can float, as they do in Pi's story, the men are able to corroborate one small detail of the tale, but it is not enough to reas- sure them of the truth of the larger narrative. Pi's blind encounter with a cannibalis- tic French castaway, whose lifeboat drifts up against Pi's own, is judged to be a "far-fetched" coincidence (332). Pi's encounter with the Frenchman is undoubtedly a bizarre episode, one whose power of estrangement and defamiliarization comes, at</page><page sequence="12">120 Mosaic 46/4 (December 2013) least in part, from the tonal shift away from realism to absurdism in Part Two. Richard Parker, ostensibly Pi's tiger companion, is held up as a particularly objectionable nar- rative detail, eliciting another expression of the men's disbelief (328). A key episode of interpretive contention in the novel is the interlude Pi spends at the algae island. Pi's first listeners reject the possible existence of the island, with its carnivorous trees, aquatic meerkats, and strange freshwater pools, suggesting, "No sci- entist would believe you" (327). If the encounter with the blind French castaway shifts the narrative from realism to absurdism, Pi's description of his "exceptional botanical discovery" (284), which immediately follows, constitutes a restoration of the realist mode, albeit in a newly improbable setting. This restoration allows the narrative for- mally to insist upon its own reasonableness. He offers meticulous detail of his encounter with the island, describing the sensation of stepping ashore upon its "flex- ible but solid" mass. He notes, "The illusion would not give. I put my full weight on my foot. Still I did not sink. Still I did not believe." The language of disbelief here con- nects Pi to other figures of doubt in the narrative. It is not Pi's reason that offers the final confirmation of the reality of this island; it is, rather, his nose: "It came to my olfactory sense, full and fresh, overwhelming: the smell of vegetation. I gasped. [. . .] It was then that I believed" (286). This privileging of sensation over reason anticipates the interpretive climax in Part Three, as Pi challenges his interviewers to respond with imaginative feeling to the story that he has told. Pi tells his story several times throughout the novel. Placing the iterations of the story in chronological order, we may see him, at the very least, having told the story to the Japanese officials as they investigate the sinking of the Tsimtsum , to Francis Adirubasamy, and, more than twenty years later, to the Martel-like writer who tran- scribes Pi's stories. While Pi's narrative, in its pre-textual iterations, exists in an oral form that is inherently mobile and unfixed, it is the writer who translates experience into text, and thus fixes the narrative in its final form. The writer character may be read simply as a hungry novelist looking for a story, or as an amanuensis for Pi, trans- forming his traumatic narrative from lived experience into textual record. However, he is not the first to commit Pi's story to paper. In addition to the "yellowed newspa- per clippings" (x) that constitute an early textualization of the castaway's experience, Pi keeps a diary during his time at sea; however, the pen runs out before his ordeal is over. In any case, he claims it is a workman-like record, and he shares little of it in his narrative. It is, as Pi says, filled with "very practical stuff" (231). The writer observes in the "Author's Note" that Pi "showed me the diary he kept during the events" (x), and Pi later elaborates, "I talked about what you might expect: about things that hap- pened and how I felt, about what I caught and what I didn't, about seas and weather,</page><page sequence="13">Daniela Janes 121 about problems and solutions, about Richard Parker" (231). These are nominally the same topics that appear in the writer's treatment of Pi's ordeal. The status of the diary opens up questions about the relationship between the experience of an event and its multiple recordings (it is worth noting that Pi authors one more document: a mes- sage in a bottle, that staple of the castaway narrative [264] ). Pi disarmingly reduces his narrative powers, describing the journal as simply "Words scratched on a page trying to capture a reality that overwhelmed me" (230-31). This suggests an insurmountable gap between his experience and his capacity to narrate it. The most significant point of divergence between Pi's diary recording and the story as he later tells it to the writer is that the diary ends with the declaration, I will die today. I die. (266) Instead, Pi's life departs from his textual recording of it; rather than dying, he lives to tell a fuller version of his story. Despite his sense of his own narrative limitations, Pi insists upon determining the meaning of his experience. Rebecca Duncan suggests that in his "eagerness to interpret his survival story," Pi reflects the power of narrative ownership to aid in the recovery of the traumatized subject (181). As Pi advises Mr. Okamoto and Mr. Chiba in Part Three, "The world isn't just the way it is. It is how we understand it, no? And in understanding something, we bring something to it, no? Doesn't that make life a story?" It is his first audience, alone, that expresses doubt about the narrative plausi- bility of Pi's tale, repeatedly asking, "We would like to know what really happened" (335). After debating the nature of interpretation with his interlocutors, Pi requests, "Give me a minute, please" (336). This textual pause is a central crux in the narrative. Our interpretation of the second telling of the tale hinges on whether we read this as a pause for recollection or for invention. Pi proceeds to relate a second version of his story in which humans replace the implausible animals of the first story. The second version is a short, brutal telling that culminates in murder and cannibalism. Pi him- self occupies the role of the tiger here, and shows his own capacity for brutality and violence. As Cole argues, the men's reactions of distaste can be read "as both a visceral repulsion from the story's brutal violence and an aesthetic judgment condemning its relative underdevelopment" (34-35). In terms of narrative and aesthetics, morality and ethics, it is a horror. Pi accuses his listeners of seeking "a story that won't surprise you. That will con- firm what you already know. That won't make you see higher or further or differently.</page><page sequence="14">122 Mosaic 46/4 (December 2013 ) You want a flat story. An immobile story. You want dry, yeastless factuality" (336). Here, the language of stories as symbolic bread emphasizes motifs of consumption. But rather than the risk of being figuratively consumed, as we saw in A Strange Manuscript , there is the notion that a story - the right story - has the power to nourish the reader or listener, to satisfy the hunger or the appetite for something beyond our quotidian experiences and restore "a belief in the transforming power of story" (Stratton 19). Pi makes explicit connections between religious faith and narrative faith; both, he argues, are predicated upon a faith in things unseen, faith that requires an imaginative leap. This echoes Coleridge's notion of "the willing suspension of disbelief for the moment, which constitutes poetic faith" ( Biographia 6). The end of Martels text stages a con- version narrative in which the more skeptical of the Japanese officials, the conscien- tious, dutiful Mr. Okamoto, concedes in his official report that he believes the fantastical first version of the story featuring the animals. If we return to the opening section of the novel, and the "Author's Note," the writer describes his experience of hearing "the story" from Adirubasamy, interviewing Pi, and finally listening to the taped conversation between a teenaged Pi and the Japanese officials. It is this document that belatedly wins the writer's concession "that this was, indeed, a story to make you believe in God" (x). There is some ambivalence here, as it remains unclear which part of the taped conversation leads to the metaphoric "conversion" of the writer. Is it Pi's conviction, his arguments about story and the nature of poetic faith? Is it the conflict between the two versions of the story? Or is it the model of Mr. Okamoto's own expe- rience of textual conversion? Rather than believing the horrendous second version of the tale, he picks "the better story" (352) and in this way demonstrates his worthiness to be converted. Given the significance of appetite as a metaphor within the text, we may recall that the book opens with the frame narrator's assertion, "This book was born as I was hungry As the book concludes, the yeasty and nourishing version of the tale is triumphant and all of the embedded listeners' appetites are satiated. While Pi's narrative possesses an Aristotelian narrative architecture - a begin- ning, middle, and end - Martel's narrative is ultimately inconclusive; the question of whether the first telling of the tale or the second, abbreviated and horrific telling is the factual one is ultimately a narrative crux. Cole suggests that the ending of the novel does not, in fact, stage a conversion, noting that the two officials "merely concede that the story of Richard Parker is aesthetically preferable, without saying anything about its truth" (23). We may note, too, a significant moment of mishearing. As Pi, to his mind, definitively makes his case about "the better story," he proclaims, "And so it goes with God." This declaration is followed by " [Silence] ," before his interlocutors turn to each other:</page><page sequence="15">Daniela Janes 123 Mr. Chiba: "What did he just say?" Mr. Okamoto: "I don't know." (352) This dramatized mishearing provides some support to the claim that the men may, indeed, fail as listeners, both to hear and to understand. The novel ends, though, not with the words of Pi or of the writer, but rather with Mr. Okamoto s official report, which lends credence to the view that he has been persuaded to believe. The fact that his conversion is staged in textual form, as a written document intended for another reader, further formalizes and legitimizes Pi's first, fantastical version of his castaway experience. While Coleridge's notion of "poetic faith" is predicated upon the momen- tary suspension of disbelief while reading, this textualization of Mr. Okamoto's con- version offers an argument for belief that extends beyond the temporary act of listening to Pi's narrative. According to this reading, the end of the text offers a pow- erful instance of narrative conversion when the initially skeptical listener is drawn into the tale and accepts "the better story." In contrast, De Mille's text ends not with conversion but with renunciation. Adam More 's manuscript is ultimately set aside in favour of dinner, and the reading remains unfinished. Closure here is permanently deferred, and the ending of the text offers the readers outside of the text the oppor- tunity to meditate on the failure of Mores narrative to win over all of the embedded readers within the novel. Both narratives, to varying degrees, leave the reader figura- tively lost at sea as the texts recreate at a formal level the disorientation and loss of the castaway's experience. As in The Rime of the Ancient Mariner ; we may consider the idea that the embedded listener is the one who particularly needs to hear the tale. In Life of Pi, the skeptical Mr. Okamoto and the disheartened writer are both restored by the process of narrative conversion, and may be said to leave the story as wiser men. The ending of A Strange Manuscript , instead, offers a conclusion as disruptive and counter-conversionary as if Coleridge's Wedding Guest had simply stood up and turned his back, leaving the telling of the Mariner's tale forever incomplete. NQTES 1/ De Mille's novel was published eight years after his death. The novel, which appeared serially in Harper's Weekly between January and May 1888, was most likely written between 1866 and 1868. Daniel Burgoyne and Malcolm Parks provide detailed publication histories in their respective introductions to the novel. Of central critical interest has been the debate over the novel's completeness. De Mille's brother, Alfred, main- tained that the author "was never able to make a satisfactory denouement to the plot in it," and he thus considered his brother's novel to be unfinished, although he acknowledged that he was uncertain whether De Mille had continued working on the manuscript in the years before his death (quoted in Burgoyne's introduction to A Strange Manuscript [Peterborough: Broadview, 201 1. 13]). Camille R. La Bossière makes</page><page sequence="16">124 Mosaic 4 6/4 ( December 2013) a compelling case for reading the novel, as it exists, as "complete," claiming that by its end, the "novel of ideas ha[s] played itself and its author out" ("The Mysterious End of James De Mille's Unfinished Strange Manuscript." Essays on Canadian Writing 27 [1983-84]: 52. Print). Gwendolyn Guth, in the same spirit, suggests that the "simple truth" of the novel is that "it is finished in its incompleteness" (51).
