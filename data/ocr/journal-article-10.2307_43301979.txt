LAMBERT, Paris, France MOST of Genesis EXEGETES as the have product long of considered a single writer. the first At chapter most it of Genesis as the product of a single writer. At most it was believed to contain some unimportant interpolations and some few slight alterations. Yet, when one examines more closely the Creation story, one encounters numerous difficulties which relate to the whole of the narrative as well as to its details and which prevent one from admitting the unity of the authorship. It has been observed already by G. ďEichthal* that there appears to be for each day of the Creation a strophe con- sisting of two parts. In the first God commands that such and such a thing be; in the second He makes it. This order, however, is not regularly followed. In the creation of light and darkness the second part is lacking. How, then, can the two parts be reconciled? If God's word is all that is necessary In order that a thing exist, there is no need to say that God makes it. This contradiction is emphasized by the expression p 'T1, "and it was so", which almost invariably follows the divine command and indicates that in contrast to human acts, this command is carried out immediately. On the other hand, the second part of each paragraph seems to represent God as working in the manner of an ordinary workman. It is for this reason that F. Schwally* and, more recently * The basis of this article was formulated twenty-five years ago. I have since modified it considerably. * Mémoire sur le texte primitif du premier récit de la création , etc. Paris 1875- 3 In AR (1906) 159-175-</page><page sequence="2">4 M. LAMBERT J. Morgenstern 4 have recognized that the first chapter of Genesis contains two combined accounts, one of which is derived from a very lofty idea of divine power, while the other suggests a very marked anthropomorphic character. But it has apparently not been perceived that the anthropomorphic account, which I shall call A (acts), reveals a very great naivetè in cosmo- graphy, while the idealist account, which I shall call W (words), betokens in its author a relatively advanced scientific knowledge. In fact, A does not know that the sun is the cause of the day; he assigns to the fourth day the creation of the sun and stars, and he remarks that God created the sun to rule the day, while W writes that the sun gives light during the day; he knows, then, that the light of the day comes from the sun. Morgenstern believes the A account to be more modern than the W account and attributes it to the Priestly redactor (compiler), who took up the Jehovistic narratives in his com- bination of Biblical sources. But it is one thing to gather accounts and another to write from them. Nothing, moreover, compels me to believe that A is identical with the last redactor of the Bible (who perhaps was not Priestly but might have taken into account Priestly tendencies). More natural it is to believe that A is earlier than W, granting the anthropomorphism and the scientific naivetè of the former without, in addition, affirming that the progress of ideas is always in a chronological sequence. A enumerates seven works distributed over six days (according to the definitive text), namely, light, firmament, vegetables, stars fishes and birds, quadrupeds, man. According to W, God created the world by means of eight words s (to which it is undoubtedly necessary to add the two blessings for the first animals and man and the law concerning food). With a little attention, one may observe that the two accounts are distinguished from each other not only by background but also by form, a certain number of expressions being different in them. If one overlooks 4 In AJSL (1920) 169 - 212. 5 Abot V. i says: "Ten words", - which is exact if one includes the two blessings. With the law about food, there would be eleven. One would expect, besides, a blessing also for the quadrupeds, and there would then be, in all, twelve words, - which would give a sacred number.</page><page sequence="3">A STUDY OF THE FIRST CHAPTER OF GENESIS 5 this at first, it is because A and W after being united, influenced each other; but the borrowed words may generally be recognized because they are not in the place which they would have to occupy if they were in the original text. It is thus, for example, with the words and of verses 11 and 24, for they come from verses 12 and 25. To A belong the phrases commencing with PJTl, "and God made", or NWI, "and God created", then those which have HIB *0 KT1, "and God saw that it was gooď', and 'Ď ÙV "ipS Wl ny 'T1, "and it was evening and it was morning such and such day". To W belong the phrases com- mencing with D'"6n "and God said", and the expression p %T1, "and it was so" (in v. 3 "lì« VPl, "and there was light"). As for the denominations of "day and night, heaven, land and sea", which verses 5a, 8a, 10a contain, they seem to be an addition of a compiler, for they scarcely agree with W, because of 5 a, or with A, because of 10a, as will be seen later. From him would also come the phrase pertaining to the Sabbath. Having made these general observations, we shall proceed to a detailed study of the text of the chapter. Genesis com- mences with two sentences each of which forms the beginning of a Creation story, and it is the combining of them that has obscured the construction of verses 1-3. It is necessary, in the first place, to determine which of the two beginnings belongs to A and which to W. Now, the use of the word K"D, "to create", in v. 1 already indicates that we are in the account where God acts. The word JVBWD, "in the beginning", being certainly in the construct state with the verb (the perfect form is admissible but the infinitive ^5 would be more natural), the principal proposition is missing, for verses 2-3 belong to the other account. The creation of light ought to be mentioned in A as well as in W. In my opinion there ought to be some such phrase as *Jl?nn fiKl HKH HK ntPJJ. A, then, ought to commence thus: "When God began to create the heaven and the earth, He made the light and the darkness". Thus it is that in Isa. 45. 7 God is called NTÛ1 TIK *13 V, "maker of light and creator of darkness". For A, darkness is just as real as light, and God creates the darkness as He creates</page><page sequence="4">6 M. LAMBERT the light, while for W, who is much more advanced in natural philosophy, darkness is the absence of light; darkness, then, exists prior to light. The compiler must have suppressed the words which we have restored because they were not in accord with the divine command: "Let there be light!", which supposes the préexistence of darkness, attested to, moreover, expressly in v. 2. This suppression led to other changes: in the paragraphs that follow, the formula for divine satisfaction, *0 DTI1?« KT1, does not mention the object created and is placed at the close of each creation before the words indicating the day. Here is found: "And God saw the light that it was good and He separated the light from the darkness". Logically, if the light alone is good, God should have suppressed the darkness entirely instead of devoting the night to it. In truth, the separation of the light from the darkness is explicable only if the two things are coexistent. God distinguishes them and it is this distinction that God finds good, just as in the case of the separating of continent and sea (v. 10). By restoring the expression "God made the light and the darkness", by putting in afterwards "And God separated, etc.", and finally "And God saw that it was good", one renders the account clear and logical. But it is to be understood that the words, "God made the light and the darkness", being removed, the compiler attempted to account for the words, "And God separated, etc.", by placing them after the expression, "And God saw (the light) that it was good". He must have added "the light", because God's satisfaction no longer applied itself to anything except the light, and he did not concern himself with the difficulties which he caused through these alterations. If, as the moderns believe, the chapter dealing with the Creation was to be preceded by the half- verse 2. 4a: rÓN DN*Dî"D pNitt nvftin "These are the origins of the heaven and the earth, when they were created", then undoubtedly it would be proper to attribute it to account A, for there is no reason for suppressing DfcCUiTl. To account W belongs v. 2, the conjunction "and" being suppressed: "The earth was inert and uninhabited, and darkness was upon the face of the deep, and a breath of God was</page><page sequence="5">A STUDY OF THE FIRST CHAPTER OF GENESIS 7 astir on the face of the water". The expression by appears familiar to W, for it occurs again in v. 20. The verse, however, is not absolutely clear. It is observed that the darkness was on the face of the deep, although this deep has not yet been spoken of, and, moreover, it is difficult to see why W localizes the darkness, especially if, as we have already remarked, this author knows that darkness is only the absence of light. Lastly, the juxtaposition of the expressions Dinn by ļtfm and fiVll by rUDIVlû is somewhat bothersome, Qinn, "deep, mass of water" and D^D, "waters" seeming to be synonyms. One ought, in my opinion, to connect with what precedes and to write iTilD by "upon its surface (the earth's)", in place of by j and one ought to ask oneself whether has not been added, when one has interpreted HV1 as meaning "spirit", and one ought also to ask oneself whether the word does not merely signify "air". The meaning of verses 2 and 3 would then become: "The earth was solitude, void , and darkness ; upon its surface was the ocean and an air was astir upon the water. God said, 1 Let there be a lighť and a light was " V. 5*. as has been previously said, was apparently added by the compiler (C), who wished to state precisely the connection between the night and the day mentioned by A. These words cannot come from W, for whom the day and the night did not appear except with the luminaries, nor from A, for whom the separating of the light and the darkness is a general fact, not limited to day and night In addition, it would be strange that the word DV should have been taken by him successively in two different senses: "period of light" and "diurnal period". V. 6 belongs to W, v. 7 to A, except p 'T1, which was separated from v. 6 by the one who combined the accounts. V. 8 a is a new gloss establishing the identity of }^p*l with Although the Psalmist (Ps. 19. 2) draws a parallel between these two words, they do not seem to be synonymous. At least for W, who speaks of the firmament of the heaven (verses 14, 15, and 20 6), the firmament is a solid vault and the heaven the height of the atmosphere. 6 As to v. 17, it will be discussed later</page><page sequence="6">8 M. LAMBERT The separating of the waters and the continent is present only in W. The words "And God saw that it was good", which belonged to A have been misplaced. In the original they follow v. 7, but the redactor transposed them in order to put them at the conclusion of the account relating to the waters. The gloss of v. ioa identifies pN with flttO', although the word pN is employed in another sense throughout the chapter. Verses n (W) and 12 (A) were influenced the one by the other, especially the former by the latter. In v. 11 there was, no doubt, jnt JHÌ, as in v. 29, and }HÏ jntû comes from A. The words Wùb *lô 7W JJ are a copy of A with the word )î'yùb poorly placed and changed to an unusual form. The words Wiy "HS YV would be an indefensible pleonasm. Perhaps the original text was: ty ['T] U IJHT WK nft py[1]. As for the word 1îVôt&gt;, it is very usual and is correctly used in A to denote the different kinds of beings. In W it would be applied only to trees. In v. 24 (W) is borrowed from v. 25 (A), but employed in a peculiar manner (see below). It is not present in v. 20 (W), although it figures in the corresponding phrase of A (v. 21). In v. 12 (A) it is to be observed that, contrary to what is found in all the other creations, it is not God who acts; it is the earth which produces vegetables. It is difficult to believe that this exception was made by the author of the account himself. It is more probable that v. 12 was modified under the influence of v. 11 and that there was in the original text KSVl pKH ]ö "And God caused to come forth from the earth". One can compare to it the expression pKH p Dnî? "to cause bread to come forth out of the earth" (Ps. 104. 14). In every manner there is a stylistic difference between W, who says KBH ttt SHM, and A, who says Hdtm K*nn. The text of W in the paragraph that follows (v. 14-15) is intact, except that JTIìmA ought to be corrected to miKDil (the error is due to the influence of nnfcò Wn). V. 16 (A) did not undergo any more change and differs very perceptibly from the W account as to the rôle of the luminaries. For the latter, the sun lights up the day; it produces, then, the day. For A, the day and the night are in existence since the beginning of</page><page sequence="7">A STUDY OF THE FIRST CHAPTER OF GENESIS 9 Creation. The rôle played by the luminaries, then, is to rule the day and the night Sentences 17b and 18 a appear to come from the compiler, who would have wished with regard to the placing of the stars, to combine the ideas of W and A, so that the text repeats what has already been said concerning their creation. He took in W the idea that the stars serve to give light to the earth and in A the notion that' the stars rule the day and the night. With the words, "to distinguish between the light and the darkness", he returns to the text of W, but in putting "light" in the place of "day" and "darkness" in the place of "night", he has made a change which undoubtedly has as its purpose the avoidance of repeating the words, "day and night". But he did not take into consideration the fact that the expression thus modified, is found already in v. 5. The separating of the light and the darkness was indeed in effect from the first day. In the paragraph that treats of the creation of reptiles and birds, the words p 'T1 are missing after v. 20 (W). On the other hand, in A, in v. 21, the relative clause renders the parallelism with inrtó to AM less satis- factory; it seems to be imitated from W, who employs pfc? where A makes use of toûl. There was perhaps only after ntitoVT. Let it be noted that A, who distinguished the great luminaries from the stars, distinguishes here the sea monsters from the other aquatic reptiles (fishes). In the creation of the terrestrial animals, v. 24 ought to be relived of WEb and of IJVni. The first firtó has no meaning since the expression HT! is a whole of which BWI naro give the divisions. As for íWró 1JYÎÎ1, besides being the unexpected poetic form of livni, these words are very badly placed here, being separated from HDrQ by tflDI. They are manifestly taken from A. V. 25 (A) has not been altered, but it may possibly be necessary to place here the clause VW ŮV 'T1 VW, "It was evening, it was morning, a sixth day", and in v. 31 to restore DV in place of D1' In account A each day was to have its work, and, as Wellhausen thought, man was created the seventh day. The idea that God rested the</page><page sequence="8">IO M. LAMBERT seventh day seems comparatively modern. This is indicated by 22a; "And God completed His work the seventh day", while 2 b, "And God rested from all His work" appears to be a variant intended to introduce the idea of divine rest, developed in v. 3. The compiler, then, suppressed the final sentence of the paragraph dealing with animals, and at the end of the following paragraph, he put WH in place of The use of the article is understandable for the seventh day, which closes the week, but not for the sixth, which is an ordinary day. It was in this way that the creation of the terrestrial animals and the creation of man were brought together. The paragraph devoted to the creation of man in W (v. 26) has been greatly modified under the influence of A. There is no reason why, in this narrative, God should have worked more in order to form man than in order to produce the other beings. God's word ought to suffice in order to bring man into existence. It may then be granted that in place of DIN ntPJtt "Let us make men in our image according to our likeness" there would simply be pNH by Dì« VP, "Let there be men on the earth", or some thing analogous to it. The one who altered the W account thought he would be giving it more dignity by borrowing DIK ntyjtè from A (v. 27) and perhaps ttJTIDTD from v. 5. But the anthropomorphic tone of this sentence is not in accord with the severe idealism of W. On the other hand pNH must be an alteration of JVHD1 pNH, itself borrowed from v. 25, as well as pK in Vìi in v. 24. The blessing for man (v. 28) and the rule concerning food (vv. 29-30) belong to W. He (W) united in v. 28 all the terrestrial animals in the expression pnn by Jltfiftnn iTH bïî) (if, however, the word HůřlM was not omitted by accident). In v. 29 the word yy after seems inadvertently placed, if it is not a variant of pyn, which might have passed from the margin of the text to a poor place in it. On the contrary, in v. 30 the word WÜ is lacking before fltofcò. V. 31 naturally forms a part of account A. It has been seen above that WH DP should be changed to DP. 2. i is the conclusion of W, while 2 a is the conclusion of A. I have already remarked that 2 b seems to be a correction</page><page sequence="9">A STUDY OF THE FIRST CHAPTER OF GENESIS n of 2 a, introducing the mention of divine repose, while v. 3 is an amplification of it, proclaiming the law of the Sabbath in conformity with the Decalogue (Ex. 20. 1 1).
