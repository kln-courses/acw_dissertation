<plain_text><page sequence="1">On the Notion of Teleology in Contemporary Life Sciences by Franz M . WUKETITS* Summary The present paper is devoted to the problem of teleology in modern biology. Teleology is restricted to the phenomenon of goal-directedness, whereas goal-intended actions are denied. Thus, only the aspect of seemingly material teleology or teleonomy is required which paraphrases functions of certain value for the self maintenance of a system and is explainable without reference to vitalistic premises. Some aspects of evolution and selection are discussed and subsumed under a systems- theoretically oriented view. Furthermore it is stressed that teleological explanations are compati- ble with causal (mechanical) ones. The result of these assertions is the possibility of the reconcilia- tion of seemingly irreconcilable positions. This, last not least, means a plea for the re-assessment of an old and venerable problem. Résumé Cet article est consacré au problème de la finalité dans la biologie moderne, « finalité » étant pris ici dans un sens restreint de «comportement dirigé vers un but», écartant toute notion d'intention consciente. La finalité matérielle apparente ou téléonomie, qui dénote simplement des fonctions ayant pour effet la conservation de systèmes, suffit donc, sans qu'un recours à des prémisses vitalistes soit nécessaire. Quelques aspects de l'évolution et de la sélection sont discutés dans le cadre de la théorie des systèmes. L'auteur montre aussi que les explications téléologiques n'entrent pas en contradiction avec des explications causales (mécanistes), d'où une synthèse possible de positions apparemment incompatibles. Enfin il plaide pour une réévaluation de ce problème ancien et vénérable. Zusammenfassung Vorliegende Arbeit ist dem Problem der Teleologie in der modernen Biologie gewidmet. Die Teleologie wird dabei auf zielgerichtetes Verhalten eingeschränkt, während zielintendiertes Ver- halten geleugnet wird. Daher genügt der Aspekt der scheinbaren materialen Teleologie oder Tele- onomie, die lediglich Funktionen von systemerhaltendem Wert umschreibt und ohne Rückgriff auf vitalistische Prämissen erklärt werden kann. Es werden einige Aspekte der Evolution und Selektion diskutiert und unter eine systemtheo- retisch orientierte Betrachtungsweise subsumiert. Ferner wird hervorgehoben, dass teleologische Erklärungen nicht im Widerspruch zu kausalen (mechanischen) Erklärungen stehen, was in einer möglichen Synthese von scheinbar inkompatiblen Positionen resultiert. Dies bedeuted nicht zu- letzt ein Plädoyer für die Wieder-(Neu-)bewertung eines altehrwürdigen Problems. * Hauptstrasse 111, A-7111 Parndorf (Austria) Dialéctica Vol. 34, N° 4 (1980)</page><page sequence="2">278 Franz M. Wuketits 1. Introduction The notion of teleology has given rise to an embarrassing problem, nay it has become an emotionally obscured topic. The problem of teleology is the system of questions about plan, purpose and goal-directedness in nature, par- ticularly in living phenomena. It dates back to Greek philosophy and results from Aristotle's assumption of final causes. This assumption was the core of certain reflections on living systems and finally led to the wellknown vitalistic and neo-vitalistic doctrines. What does teleology mean today? Has the notion of teleology any mean- ing and is it of any value for modern biology? Well, for some biologists it seems to be an obsolete category, an emblem of outmoded philosophical styles of thinking. Since the establishment of Darwin's theory of natural selection biologists more and more have postulated mechanical explanations and have tried to eliminate teleological aspects. On the other hand it cannot be denied that organisms imply some features which prima facie apparently justify teleology and teleological explanations. Thus biologists are in the quandary, either to give up teleological aspects and to ignore certain phenomena (at the cost of the insight into some essential criterions of living beings) or to embrace the opinion of vitalists, i.e. to refer to vital forces like entelechy (at the cost of sufficient explanations). The dissatisfaction about this unpleasant alternative may be the reason why the discussion of teleology is still alive. In deed, "wherever there is ref- erence to part-whole relations (in morphology), to means-end relations (in physiology), or to goal-governed processes (in embryology), there is teleological discourse" (Grene, 1974 p. 174). And contemporary treatments of evolution - as far as they include philosophical issues - after all are devoted to the problem of teleology too (e.g. the textbook of Dobzhansky et al., 1977). Despite the still controversial nature of the notion of teleology, I am con- vinced that (i) teleological aspects in the life sciences cannot be neglected, but that (ii) these aspects are to handle without reference to classical vitalism or neo-vitalism. By making these assertions I am quite in accordance with Nagel (1961), Ayala (1968, 1972), Mohr (1977), and others, who stress the impor- tance of teleological aspects (respectively teleological explanations) beyond vitalistic doctrines and thus show the compatibility of teleological with causal explanations. This standpoint corresponds to Bertalanffy's systems theoretic considerations which boil down to an organismic view of life (cf. Bertalanffy, 1976) and to which I shall have to refer below.</page><page sequence="3">On the Notion of Teleology in Contemporary Life Sciences 279 2. Some aspects of teleology The concept of teleology has caused many misleading interpretations. Therefore it is rewarding to clarify the essential aspects of teleology and its ap- plications and to work out the ideas underlying those aspects. I shall now review two possible approaches to systematize teleology (see also Wuketits, 1978). One of these approaches has been exposed by Ayala (1968, 1972). Ayala has distinguished three categories of teleological phenomena: (i) Purposeful activities occuring in man, "when the endstate or goal is consciously an- ticipated by the agent" (Ayala, 1972, p. 9). (ii) Self-regulating systems, "when there exists a mechanism that enables the system to reach or to main- tain a specific property in spite of environmental fluctuations" (ibid.), i.e. homeostasis (like the regulation of body temperature in warm-blooded animals), (iii) "Structures anatomically and physiologically constituted to perform a certain function" 0 ibid .), e.g. man's hand or eye, man-made machines etc. From another point of view Ayala has set forth the distinction between ex- ternal and internal teleology. He has pointed out this distinction as follows: "The end-directedness of living organisms and their features may be said to be internal teleology, while that of man-made tools and servo-mechanisms may be called external teleology. It might also be appropriate to refer to these kinds of teleology as natural and artificial . . ." (Ayala, 1972, p. 12). The other approach has been elaborated by Stegmüller (1969), and that from the standpoint of philosophy of science. Stegmüller has classified the problem of teleology or rather the various types of teleology in the following way: He has distinguished basically between (i) "formal" teleology which means the reduction of the problem to a temporal relation between antecedens and explanandum, and (ii) "material" teleology, paraphrasing goal -intended activities ("pure" material teleology) as well as activities which are goal- directed but not goal-intended ("seemingly" material teleology). The term "goal-directed" means that there is a direction, but it does not imply a direc- tor (see also Braithwaite, 1953). Seemingly material teleology has resemblance to Wright's conception of " quasi-teleology " (cf. Wright, 1971). It is just that kind of teleology to which biologists refer nowadays when they are confronted with goal-directed phenomena concerning behaviour or ontogeny of organisms, whereas pure material teleology is to identify with the assumptions of vitalists and neo-vitalists. As I shall have to specify below, seemingly material teleology corresponds to a large degree to the conception of teleonomy. Furthermore, it is on principle the same which Ayala has in mind</page><page sequence="4">280 Franz M. Wuketits when he speaks about self-regulating systems and structures constituted to perform certain functions. The scope of teleology, consequently, is diminished then, for in that ver- sion it no longer implies the formerly supposed life forces and spiritual prin- ciples. It is a matter of fact that the notion of unobservable creative activities in classical sense is just an anthropomorphism of no scientific value. This is to stress at least in natural science and thus in biology. In the human sciences, probably, the teleological approach must be evaluated from another point of view, considering aspects of motivation, free will and so on. (For a detailed presentation of the problem of teleology in social and historical sciences the reader may consult e.g. Nagel, 1961 and Wright, 1971.) In the life sciences, however, teleology may be reduced to seemingly material teleology and to the aspect of goal-directedness. Hence we have to concentrate on this one aspect and have to ask for its explanation without recourse to metaphysics. Explanations of the phenomenon of goal- directedness, nevertheless, may be called teleological. Teleological explana- tions in biology have been discussed by severel authors, for instance by Mohr (1977, 1978), who has remarked that in the sciences of life explanations of this kind are required besides mechanical (causal) ones. It is the question "what for?" which elicits answers beginning with such locutions as "in order to" and "for the sake of" - answers which have the character of teleological ex- planations (cf. Nagel 1961)1 . (For an account of biological questions see Simp- son, 1963; Wuketits, 1978.) In some branches of biological investigation (ethology, developmental biology, functional anatomy) this question is of ultimate concern, whereas in physical sciences it is completely unimportant; it is, as Lorenz (1978) pointed out, alien to physicists. Since the question "what for? " is peculiar to biology, it underlines the specifity or biological research among the (natural) sciences. This is one reason tô State the autonomy of biological sciences and to claim that biology is irreducible to physics (and chemistry). We have to itemize now two comments on teleology given in this passage: (i) the notion of teleology in its broadest sense means the assumption that cer- 1 Nagel (1961) identifies teleological with functional explanations. This may be justified in some cases, but in general it is reasonable to distinguish between these two types of explanation. Functional explanations are assertions about the role of an element in a system, e. g. the statement 4 'the function of chlorophyll is to absorb light for photosynthesis". The developmental processes which make that function possible and so lead to the specific functional state of an element or- dinarily are not accessible to functional explanations (for further details see Mohr, 1977). In neurobiology Horridge (1977) has proposed the explanation via "mechanistic teleology" which "relates mechanisms to ends on the assumption that adaptive evolution . . . has evolved structures and physiological properties to be efficient for particular functions" (p. 731).</page><page sequence="5">On the Notion of Teleology in Contemporary Life Sciences 28 1 tain goals are setting (anticipated) by an agent (" creator ") which implies elements like consciousness, rationality, free will, values, propensity struc- tures and - in classical (vitalistic) bio-philosophy - vital forces, i.e. that goal-intended activities are supposed, (ii) In biological sciences teleology is to understand and to handle in another fashion: Biologists only have to refer to goal-directed (not to goal-intended!) phenomena and are thus concerned with the conception of seemingly material teleology. The quintessence of these statements is that teleology in the life sciences is reducible to that single aspect, while the other aspects match with metaphysics rather than with science and therefore have become useless. But this one side of teleology so much the more deserves our attention, for, last not least, it is proper to biology and causes - or gives rise to - specific biological expl'anations too, namely teleological explanations. 3. Adaptation and selection : Pre-conditions for an up-to-date approach to teleology Since Darwin (1859) the term "selection" has become almost a slogan. Although Darwin himself was aware of the incompleteness of his theory of natural selection, it is just that theory which - what is wellknown - has had the greatest influence imaginable to biology. Darwin'a epigones proclaimed the explanation of living systems and their diversity via natural selection rather enthusiastically. And up to now the principle of selection has been the guiding idea in evolutionary theory, nay it almost has become tacitly accepted by a great number of biologists - at least by all those biologists who have taken a darwinistic or neo-darwinistic view. Of course there are differences between classical darwinism and today's neo-darwinism or (better) "synthetic theory" which grows from darwinism and outgrows it. "The differences between the modern synthetic theory and that of natural selection as set forth by Darwin reflect advances in scientific knowledge and method since Darwin's day" (Stebbins, in: Dobzhansky et al., 1977, p. 18). These advances are based upon genetic research - especially on investigations concerning the molecular level of living systems (e.g. the decipherment of genetic code) - and, furthermore, on research work in almost every biological discipline. Selection is viewed by synthetic theory as an outer mechanism of evolution. Opposed to such a view some biologists and philosophers - 26 of them are listed in Riedl (1975, 1979) - considered evolution to rely upon internal principles which, in some cases, are similar to life forces of the vitalists. The controversy "internal versus external factors of evolution" finally led to a</page><page sequence="6">282 Franz M. Wuketits caesura in theoretical biology. But the discovery of feedback-mechanisms in living systems and the application of cybernetics and systems theory in biology oblige us to reevaluate the problem and lead us to a standpoint beyond " inter- nalism" and "externalism" - which is not yet held by all biologists, for many of them incline to "externalism" and thus to a somewhat one-sided view. The mechanism of selection neither operates merely as an outer mechanism nor as an internal factor: It is to be supposed that "there is no in- ner or outer evolutionary mechanism that is allowed to operate independent- ly " and that "the systems conditions which link different levels of complexity to feedback loops of cause and effect are responsible for the evolution of life " (Riedl, 1977, p. 358). Consequently we have to state: The principle of selection is indeed the major agent of evolutionary change, but it does not work ex- clusively in such a way as claimed by darwinists or the proponents of synthetic theory. In addition to an external selection we have to suppose an internal selection {cf. Riedl, 1975, 1979), i.e. selective forces initiated by functional in- terdependencies of organismic constructions (c/. Gutmann, 1979). The latter, of course, are not to identify with vital forces, but only should paraphrase ac- tions going on from a certain level (of an organic system) to the next lower one (e.g. from cellular to molecular level) and operating in some way selectively. Finally we have to plead for an expanded version of the theory of natural selection. This does not mean the principal falsity of darwinism or the syn- thetic theory, but - as Riedl (1975, 1979) has demonstrated - at least its in- sufficiency to explain some features proper to living systems. Thus, the theory of natural selection is to fit into a new conceptual scheme and to incorporate into a systems theoretic view. (I have discussed some of these problems elsewhere [see Wuketits, 1978].) Here we are content to remark that the con- ception of natural selection still implies some theoretical problems and is not yet completely free from fuzziness. But irrespective of these problems, there can be no doubt that evolution is only to explain with reference to selection. The same is true to the phenomenon of adaptation. Adaptedness, on the other hand, certainly provides the key for a solution of all the problems which we subsume under teleology. Ayala (in: Dobzhansky et al., 1977 , p. 506) writes: "The theory of evolu- tion by natural selection advances arguments of the following general form. Among alternative genetic variants, some result in features that are useful to their carriers as adaptations to the environment. Individuals possessing useful adaptations are likely to leave, on the average, greater numbers of progeny than individuals lacking them (or having less useful adaptations). " According to Darwin and to synthetic theory natural selection "is postulated to explain</page><page sequence="7">On the Notion of Teleology in Contemporary Life Sciences 283 adaptation - why organisms exhibit features that are end-directed" (ibid.). (Here again it is to add that natural selection - that's understood! - is to conceptualize with regard to internal selective mechanisms.) What does teleology and what do teleological structures or goal-directed events mean in respect to selection and adaptation? They mean - neither more nor less - structures, processes, or patterns of behaviour which are valuable or necessary for the self-maintenance of an organic system, i.e. an in- dividual system or a system above the individual level (e.g. a population). All those teleological phenomena are the result of the systems conditions of evolu- tion which include - to state it once more - both, external and internal selec- tive agency and embody patterns of interactions or, speaking emblematically, networks of causes (cf. Riedl, 1975, 1979). We are confronted, then, with the above-mentioned seemingly material teleology. An explanation of this kind of teleological structures, processes etc. is favourably provided with reference to adaptation and selection. The state- ment "fins have been developed by certain animals for the purpose of locomotion in water " does not mean the assumption of final cause (of Aristo- tle's causa finalis ), but merely presupposes the adaptedness of those animals to the medium "water" and implies an assertion about selective value of fins in this environment. And if a biologist for example states "that the cat has crooked, pointed claws 'with which to catch mice', he is not professing a belief in a mystical teleology, but succinctly stating that catching mice is the function whose selection pressure caused the evolution of that particular form of claws " (Lorenz, 1956, p. 24). Systems in general depend on antecedent pro- cesses of (natural) selection and their elements can be related to program- regulation (cf. Duchesneau, 1978). Therefore in teleological explanations we assume "that living systems are. . operating on the basis of rigid and op- timized program" (Mohr, 1977, p. 116), or, more precisely: "The necessary information is predominantly coded into the DNA of the organism and releas- ed sequentially during ontogenetic development. The optimization of the pro- gram has occured during the evolutionary process by natural selection. The' goal' has been adaptation to the particular environment. It is highly like- ly that any structure, process, or behavior of an organism will fulfill a positive function with a high degree of efficiency" (ibid.). By explaining teleological phenomena on the basis of selection and adapta- tion the causes of those phenomena do not imply any vital forces. But, on the other hand, it would be insufficient to reduce the explanation of such phenomena to mechanical or efficient cause (to Aristotle's causa efficiens) which is preferred by neo-darwinists. Neither metaphysics nor mechanics does justice to the property of living systems. These properties - including goal-</page><page sequence="8">284 Franz M. Wuketits directedness - are to explain with regard to systems conditions of evolution (cf. Riedl, 1975, 1979). Otherwise biologists would have the unpleasant choice, either to recourse to mysticism or to simplify the nature of living systems by reducing it to physical laws - the choice between the Scylla of metaphysics and the Charibdis of physics. Darwin's epigones (e.g. Haeckel) and the promoters of classical developmental mechanics (especially Roux) in- tended the mechanization of life sciences and hoped to find the verae causae of organic systems by explaining them in terms of classical physics, whereas - at the same time - Driesch and his disciples were on the point of reviving pseudo-scientific categories resemble to scholastic qualitates occultae (cf. Kaspar, in press). In order to eschew such unsatisfactory " solutions" of the central problems of life, we have to plead for a re-assessment of these pro- blems. Firstly, we have to avoid that phenomena like goal-directedness are minimized, secondly, we have to fit such phenomena into a conceptual scheme going beyond metaphysically bordered positons. Any attempt to do so calls for no apology. Let us take now a glimpse at some more properties of living systems which may provide further elucidation of our problem. 4. Self-regulation and teleonomy : The end of a venerable problem? Organisms are self-regulating systems. - This statement, I suppose, is widely accepted among today's biologists and compatible with cybernetical and systems theoretical analyses. Self-regulation, in general, can be defined as the tendency of a system to maintain certain characters in spite of en- vironmental fluctuations which threaten to disturb the system or, at least, the characters in question (cf. Stegmüller, 1969). "In the cell as well as in the organism physical and chemical processes are ordered in such a way that they achieve not only the self-preservation but also the development and evolution of a system. This self-regulation of living systems is especially striking in the restoration following disturbances, in the regeneration of lost parts and in the goal-directed behaviour of organisms" (Bertalanffy, 1976, p. 118). Since self-regulation or self-maintenance has been tried to explain, it has given rise to the famous controversy between mechanists and vitalists. It is needless to say that self-regulation today is not to ascribe to vital forces, but constitutes a problem explainable with reference to the above mentioned systems conditions and to optimization of genetic programs. However, the fact that organisms by definition imply the property of self-regulation is the real background of the notion of teleology. This, I think, is understandable by all means; and the nexus between the phenomenon of self-regulation and the</page><page sequence="9">On the Notion of Teleology in Contemporary Life Sciences 285 conception of seemingly material teleology can be made clear as well: Seem- ingly material teleology paraphrases nothing else but self-regulation! As I have already anticipated above, it, furthermore, is to put conceptually on a level with teleonomy. Some authors (e.g. Ayala, 1968, 1972; Mohr, 1977) have identified self-regulative mechanisms with teleonomic systems. The concept of teleonomy requires some elaboration, for, as I can see, it might be confused with teleology sensu latu . Let me try, therefore, to put for- ward at least some marginalia concerning the term " teleonomy This con- cept was established by Pittendrigh (1958) primarily with regard to the behavioural sciences. Pittendrigh's terminological assessment can be evaluated as a rapprochement in the matter of teleology. His concern was to describe some intrinsic features of organic systems in less obscured words and so to avoid confusions with metaphysical notions. For the same purpose the concepts "teleonomy" and " teleonomic' ' are used e.g. by Lorenz (1978). A profound analysis of these concepts has been supplied by Mayr (1974). Mayr's study amounts to a restriction of teleonomy to such systems2 which are operating on the basis of a certain program. Consequently, a process is said to be teleonomic, if it relies upon the efficiency of a program and therefore im- plies the property of goal-directedness. As a matter of fact there are two characteristical components proper to teleonomic events: On the one hand their regulation based on the program, on the other their dependence upon the existence of a certain goal (e.g. a physiological function, the achievement of a new geographic position etc.) which is appointed by the program responsible for the event (cf. Mayr, 1974). There are some other approaches to define teleonomy which deviate from those of Pittendrigh and Mayr. Simpson (1963), for instance, identifies teleonomic systems with products of evolution and selective value: "The teleonomic aspect is involved in the explanation of genetic information in organisms by adaptive processes, notably those of differential reproduction, or natural selection ... at the population level" (Simpson, 1963, p. 118/119). Similar to Simpson's definition is the conception of Davis (quoted after Mayr, 1974) who applies the term "teleonomy" to the development of valuable structures and mechanisms and equalizes it with adaptedness. 2 Mayr has avoided the term "system", because he has been convinced of the incom- patibility of the dynamics of teleonomic processes with systems. Latter appear to Mayr like static structures; therefore he argues that teleonomy is not appropriate to systems. But in defining systems only with respect to statics (as static structures), Mayr is not quite right, for systems im- ply dynamical processes too! (Remember Bertalanffy's conception of dynamical systems [cf. Ber- talanffy, 1976].)</page><page sequence="10">286 Franz M. Wuketits As Ayala (1968, 1972) has pointed out, teleonomy is rather the same as self-regulation and teleonomic systems are much the same as self-regulating systems. Moreover, I would identify teleonomy with structures or processes which are of certain value and importance to the self-maintenance of a system (c/. Wuketits, 1978). This standpoint corresponds to a certain degree to Ber- talanffy's view (cf. Bertalanffy, 1976). We have restricted, then, teleology to the aspect of seemingly material teleology or teleonomy; it may be useful on the level of explanation to substitute the phrase 4 ťteleological explanation" by that of "teleonomic ex- planation". In this way it might become possible to free the problem of teleology from mysticism definitively - to "de-mystifize" it. In contem- porary life sciences that aspect of teleology is the only one which deserves our attention and, perhaps, will bring us closely to the end of a venerable pro- blem.

Teleonomic aspects in biology are explained with reference to adaptation and selection. 5. The reconciliation of seemingly irreconcilable positions Now we have to encounter the query: Is teleology (teleonomy) and are teleological (teleonomic) explanations compatible with causality and causal explanations? This has been one of the most hotly debated problems in this</page><page sequence="11">On the Notion of Teleology in Contemporary Life Sciences 287 context. That teleological explanations are compatible with causal ones, has been stated by some biologists as well as philosophers. From the viewpoint of biology Ayala (1972, p. 13) writes verbatim that ' 4 teleological explanations are fully compatible with causal accounts" and that 4 4 in the first place, a teleological explanation implies that the system under consideration is direc- tively organized. " Mohr (1977, p. 117) - from the same standpoint - refers to the co-existence of causality and teleology as well and emphasizes that "the biologists resorts to . . . teleological explanations, not because a causal ac- count of life processes could not always be achieved in principle, but because . . . teleological explanations are demanded by the very nature of biological systems by the type of understanding we seek. " And Mayr (1974), one of the chief proponents of synthetic theory, states conclusively that the "teleological language" is justified in the life sciences and that it does not mean the rejection of physical or chemical (causal, mechanical) explanations, for, as far as identified with teleonomic explanations, it would not incline to the confession of vitalists. From the viewpoint of philosophy of science especially Nagel (1961) has focussed on the question, how to render possible the reduction of teleological to causal explanations and thus to equalize teleological explanations with non- teleological ones. A valuable distinction between causal and teleological ex- planations has been given by Braithwaite (1953, p. 324): " In a causal explana- tion the explicandum is explained in terms of a cause which either precedes or is simultaneous with it: in a teleological explanation the explicandum is ex- plained as being causally related either to a particular goal in the future or to a biological end which is as much future as present or past. " Of course there is a set of problems due to metascientific accounts on the notion of teleology and teleological explanations - problems which would re- quire further discussion. But we must confine in this paper to a few remarks only. (i) Teleological or teleonomic explanations are required in biology besides causal or mechanical (and functional) ones. More than this: Teleological language in biology is of certain heuristic value (c/. Ayala, 1968, 1972; Mayr, 1974). (ii) Teleological or teleonomic explanations are fully compatible with causal or mechanical ones; the one type of explanations does not exclude the other, (iii) Such an attitude toward the controversy "causality and teleology" (or "causal and [versus] teleological explanations") has the advantage that we no longer are in the dilemma of having two incompatible alternatives, but that we stand beyond the gap between almost dogmatically defended posi- tions. This point of view requires some theoretical outfit which might con- solidate the position and so constitute the theoretical paraphernalia for the</page><page sequence="12">288 Franz M. Wuketits sake of reconciliation of seemingly incompatible positions. Such theoretical equipment, certainly, must imply intergative principles, i.e. the means for syn- thesis. As I indicated above, a synthetical background of that kind is supplied by the systems view. It was Bertalanffy who took a decisive step by introduc- ing the organismic conception to biology and whose organicism has become the heart of the systems approach in the life sciences. (This approach I have sketched out elsewhere [see Wuketits, 1979 b].) The systems view does not constitute a new bio-philosophical position comparable to vitalism or mechanism; (i) it implicitely constitutes a new paradigm, i.e. a new theoretical background against the approximation to the complexity of living systems and (ii) it is embarking upon a phase of synthesis in the life sciences. The central assertion of biological systems theory is that "the whole is more than the sum of its parts" (cf. Weiss, 1969; Bertalanffy, 1976). This classical phrase has often been misunderstood and identified with metaphysical claims or even put under taboo. Since the establishment of cybernetics and systems research it has been made possible to ascertain the scientific value of that phrase by showing that elements when integrated in a specific manner lead to a completely new and unexpected pattern of organiza- tion and complexity which gives rise to a higher level of order than that of its elements. Analysing the relation between the whole (system) and its parts (elements, sub-systems) we attain to an understanding of the purpose of certain elements within a system: A system trying for stabilization and self-maintenance depends on the functionability of its elements which vice versa are depending on the stability of the system; the purpose of any single element is understand- able within the superior system, whereas the system is not able to exist and to perform certain activities without the activities on the level of its elements. The relations between whole and parts (systems and sub-systems) are interac- tions constituting feedback mechanisms and cannot be sufficiently explained without reference to functional and teleological explanations. Viewing at liv- ing systems by the means of mechanical analyses and explanations only (mechanism, reductionism) has at least the one theoretical disadvantage that we are restricted our search for understanding life to analysing causal chains. In addition to this analysis in biology we have to pursue the search for func- tional relations and to obtain a notion of "functional causality", i.e. of the circuits of causal relations. This notion is demanding feedback loops of cause and effect and refers to the cybernetical regulatory circles. Such a view recent- ly has been proposed by several authors (cf. Weiss, 1969; Bertalanffy, 1976; Mohr, 1977; Riedl, 1975, 1977, 1979; Lorenz, 1978; Wuketits, 1978; Kaspar, in press; and others). So it is neither mechanical explanation only, nor it is the</page><page sequence="13">On the Notion of Teleology in Contemporary Life Sciences 289 teleological one to be pursued in bio-science, but we have to link both ap- proaches! Finally some words about teleology and evolution: Since the establishment of evolutionary theory the question whether evolution is determined by rigid laws or the result of random events has been of paramount importance. This question has given rise to certain philosophical positions which often have been presented in a somewhat dogmatic fashion and have been apt to cement the doctrines of determinism and indeterminism. The approach basing on the study of systems conditions of evolution does not mean that evolution might be either the result of pre-determined laws or the result of chance. Contrary to the traditional alternative - law or chance, plan or aimlessness - the systems theoretically oriented approach prompts us to reform the venerable question and to seek for new answers. The insight into feedback mechansims and interactions on any level of organic systems is the reason for a theoretical innovation concerning the phenomenon of evolution. Such an innovation leads to a systems theory of evolution as it has been presented by Riedl and which amounts to the state- ment that evolution is a self-planning process, including both - law and chance (cf Riedl, 1975, 1979; Wuketits, 1979 a). Koehler (1972, p. 110) has formulated the same statement by the following words: "Evolutionary struc- tural and functional 'plans' are developed in a peculiar interaction of par- ticular causal necessities and statistically regular chance incidents on the one hand with necessity on the other." He has come, then, to the conclusion that "chance and necessity are for the biologist two aspects of the same causation" (p. 117). This, consequently, is the core of a new view going beyond determinism and indeterminism and making possible the reconcilia- tion of seemingly irreconcilable positions.
