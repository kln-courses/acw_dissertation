<plain_text><page sequence="1">REVIEWS 427 author's rich correspondence that offer key insight into Pavese, the man and the writer. In the letters that span the period of Pavese's youth until his political confinement in 1935, Prosio notes that from an early age the writer's native Langhe region is presented as "il luogo incantato dell'infanzia." Selected letters from this period reveal Pavese's attraction to the "periferia torinese, della 'barriera" and to the dialect and jargon of this world that serve as a vital source in the writer's search for popular realism and genuine local flavor. These features will later find their creative expression in the novel II compagno and in the short stories of Ciau Masino. For the period of confinement in Brancaleone Calabro, Prosio conjoins Pavese's letters with his diary II mestiere di vivere to illustrate the writer's need "di confessarsi, di conoscersi piu' a fondo, di combattere la solitudine" (192). The lyricism, thematic implications, and stylistic depth and agility of the letters to Fernanda Pivano in the early 1940s mark, according to Prosio, a significant moment in Pavese's evolution as a writer. Tunming to the Piedmontese author's correspondence during his final years (1945-50), Prosio suggests that, with Pavese having secured the literary means to transform his ideas and fantasies into fiction, "la lettera come canale piu' o meno surret- tizio di 'letteratura' (quasi uno sfogo, e un compenso, di quelle esigenze di creativita' che non si riesce a comporre e a compiutamente tradurre nell'opera scritta) venga a scadere, assumendo sempre piu' l'aspetto di pratico mezzo di comunicazione" (207). However, Prosio is quick to point out that there are numerous letters in these years that stand out for their "carica umana" and aesthetic effect. This reader would have liked the revisions to this essay, originally published in 1979, to have been a bit more current, particularly in reference to the much debated letter from Pavese to Davide Lajolo, which Prosio presents as "il sigillo di quest'affascinante e tragico epistolario" (217). In the second essay, Prosio offers a perceptive, thematic reading of Pavese's 1942 short story II mare. His analysis of this narrative piece as a "turning point" in the writer's mythological representation of the hill is especially illuminating and convincing. In the concluding essay, Prosio, ascribing to the common critical opinion thatLa casa in collina represents "la trasposizione piu' o meno immediata e veritiera dell'esperienza umana di Pavese durante la Resistenza" (235), per- suasively explores the character of Corrado in order to display two human and spiritual problems that obsessed the Piedmontese writer in those years: the sense of guilt that resulted from his inability to take part in the "armed struggle" and his religious "crisis." With Da Palazzo Madama al Valentino Torino e Gozzano, Prosio has weaved together an eloquent guide to the rich, literary world of Piedmont and to some of the most significant voices of twentieth century Italian literature. MARK PIETRALUNGA Florida State University Francois Orsini. Pirandello e l'Europa. Cosenza: Luigi Pellegrini Editore, 2001. With his latest volume, Francois Orsini provides a cogent discussion of Pirandello's work within the context of German Expressionism and French culture. Orsini's analyses of Pirandello's debt to Expressionism, both in its Italian and German manifestations, represent a welcome addition to an area of scholarship which, to date, remains relatively unexplored. However, Orsini's readings tend, at times, to repeat well-established critical assessments of both Pirandello and Expressionism in general, and therefore the new critical insights that one would like to see in the treatment of such an intriguing topic, is compromised. In the first chapter of the volume, titled "Drammaturgia espressionista: definizione sinte- tica," Orsini provides an almost encyclopedic entry of the category of expressionism by contrasting it with literary Naturalism and its pictorial analogue, notably Impressionism. Hence, drawing upon Worringer's discussion of abstraction, from his Abstraktion und Einfi- lung, Orsini engages in a long excursus to locate the defining traits of Expressionism in abstract stylization, violent deformations, mystical visions, and irrational representations.</page><page sequence="2">428 REVIEWS The remaining sections of this chapter provide a description of the themes, plots, and characters that recur in the work of Expressionist dramatists, including Ernst Toller, Georg Kaiser, Carl Sterheim, Frank Wedekind, Walter Hasenclever, and Fritz von Unruh. Regarding thematic concerns, Orsini mentions, once again, a number of well-established topoi, including the exploration of the effect of the metropolis on the individual, the epis- temiological doubts about the principles of science, justice, morality, reason, religion, and so on. More engaging is Orsini's discussion of plot-structures, which includes interesting descriptions of the autobiographical form of the "Ich-Drama" and of the loose assembling of episodes that is characteristic of the "Stationen-Drama." Both forms, Orsini argues, remain essentially static since characters are destined never to find a solution to their dilemmas. Finally, as regards characterization, Orsini notes a tendency to undermine the character-as- type of Naturalism for an archetypal being representative of a generic social role. For this reason, Orsini comments, Expressionist characters bear anonymous names such as "The Foreigner," "The Father," "The Officer," and so on. The remaining sections of this chapter address the importance of a number of semiotic systems in Expressionist dramas, including the use of deformed language, unrealistic color, as well discontinuous and abrupt movement. Orsini concludes by examining how grotesque modes of representation often engender par- odic laughter and therefore are important means to critique collective forms of behavior. In the second chapter of this volume, titled "Pirandello e l'Espressionismo," Orsini argues that Pirandello's permeability to Expressionist drama should be situated between 1910 and 1934. Orsini corroborates his claim by revisiting a number of studies and trans- lations that were published in Italy from the beginning of the century until the Twenties. Orsini also includes a long list of dramatic performances that occurred in Rome, mostly in the Teatro Sperimentale degli Indipendenti, from 1923 till 1930. Among this vast collection of exhibits, he dedicates particular attention to the role of the collaborators of the journal Messaggero verde, notably Rosso di San Secondo, Federigo Tozzi, and Amaldo Frateili, in having introduced Pirandello to German Expressionist aesthetics. Last but not least, Orsini also argues that a number of Expressionistic concerns were also present in the Futurist avant-garde and in the grotesque theatre of Chiarelli, Antonelli, and Cavacchioli. The chapter concludes by examining Pirandello's permanence in Germany in 1925, during his "tourne" with Teatro d'Arte, and in the years 1928-1933 respectively. In the third chapter, "Su un probabile influsso del teatro di Pier Maria Rosso di San Secondo su quello di Pirandello," Orsini examines Pirandello's debt to Pier Maria Rosso di San Secondo, whose work, from Sintesi drammatiche (1911) to Lo spirito della morte (1931), belongs to an Expressionist aesthetics. Going against the widespread critical judgement that Rosso was a follower of Pirandello, Orsini argues that the relationship between the two authors was one of reciprocal influence. Hence, without denying that there are elements in Rosso's drama that exhibit Pirandello's influence, Orsini illustrates how a number of Pirandello's concerns also derive from Rosso. These include the dualism between "Forma-Vita" and the themes of "gioco delle parti" and "illusione necessaria." Orsini's claims are also confirmed by a number of close textual comparison between Rosso's comedies and Pirandello's Come tu mi vuoi, I giganti della montagna, Seiperso- naggi in cerca d'autore, and Enrico IV Overall, this is an interesting chapter. However, since Rosso's mediating role within a larger European Expressionistic context remains, for the most part, unexplored, it is this reader's belief that the inclusion of this chapter does not reflect the general orientation of the volume. The fourth chapter, "Elementi espressionistici nel teatro di Luigi Pirandello," is devoted to a broad examination of Expressionistic elements in Pirandello's drama. Drawing upon a vast repertoire of dramatists, Orsini situates Pirandello's obsessive metaphors of the double and the mask in a context to which texts by Werfel, Schnitzler, Kokoschka, Kaiser, Stern- heim, and Goll belong. Further, Orsini also suggests that Pirandello's choice of concrete, anthropomorphic figurations situates his work in an area that is closer to the Expressionistic group "Die Briicke." Concerning formal traits, Orsini dedicates some attention to analyzing Pirandello's Expressionistic "mise-en-scene," particularly in regards to use of light and color.</page><page sequence="3">REVIEWS 429 In addition, he also identifies in a number of Pirandello's pieces, such as Come tu mi vuoi and La favola del figlio cambiato, the structural model of the "Ich-Drama." The chapter concludes with a short discussion of the Expressionistic elements of Pirandello's language. In his last chapter, titled "La fortuna del teatro pirandelliano in Francia," Orsini exam- ines how Pirandello became a fundamental point of reference for French dramatists who were looking for ways to move beyond the conventions of realism. To no surprise then, between 1922 and 1925, a number of Pirandello's plays were received with standing ovation by the French public. However, the year 1925 also marks a turning point in the Pirandello's reception. Pitoeff's Expressionistic production of Enrico IV was judged by many to be too abstract and, shortly after, Pirandello's plays began to be produced in smaller French theatres. In yet another turn, following his death in 1937, Pirandello became a "classic" and remained so even in the following decades, when elements of his plays continued to appeal to an audience conversant with philosophical existentialism, psychoanalysis, and neo-Marxism. The wide-spread, if uneven reception of Pirandello, explains, for Orsini, why French dramatists, from Anouilh and Ionesco, to Genet and Beckett, remained profoundly indebted to Pirandello. Yet, it is Jean-Paul Sartre, the author who profited most from Pirandello's dramatic legacy. Not only, as Orsini argues, did Sartre endorse the Pirandellian view of "Other" as a necessary and castrating presence but, perhaps more fundamentally, Sartre represented characters who, as in Pirandello's plays, are fated to wear the mask imposed by others. An interesting and well-argued book, Francois Orsini's Pirandello e l'Europa has the undeniable merit of having begun to fill a neglected area of criticism. Further, the acces- sible style of the volume is likely to render it a welcome addition to both scholars and students interested not only in Pirandello's work, but also in the complex cultural context of the European avant-garde during the first quarter of the last century. However, as I have previously suggested, this volume tends to rehearse familiar critical judgements and assessments, with the concomitant result that the novelty that one would expect from this kind of topic is often compromised. NORMA BOUCHARD The University of Connecticut/Storrs Guido Bonsaver. Elio Vittorini. The Writer and the Written. Leeds: Northern Universities Press, 2000. Guido Bonsaver propone in questo libro una rivisitazione awincente ed accurata della figura intellettuale ed artistica di Vittorini collocandone allo stesso tempo la vicenda umana e la produzione letteraria all'intero del panorama politico-culturale dell'Italia della prima meta del Novecento. In questo modo lo scrittore siciliano viene abilmente inserito da Bonsaver nell'ambito di un piiu ampio e complesso discorso critico che riguarda la dinamica del rapporto problematico tra intellettuali e potere e la difficile questione della definizione dell'identita storico-culturale italiana di quegli anni. Se da un lato quindi le scelte politico-letterarie, che pur attraverso contraddizioni ed incertezze contraddistinsero l'operare di questo scrittore, fmirono con l'influenzare un'intera generazione di intellettuali, d'altro canto, secondo Bonsaver, Vittorini rappre- senta emblematicamente, soprattutto in riferimento alla famosa polemica con il leader del P.C.I. Palmiro Togliatti, "an icon of the struggle between political commitment and artistic freedom" (1). Tenendo conto di questa impostazione critica, l'autore struttura il libro in maniera tale da non seguire unicamente un prevedibile sviluppo "orizzontale" e diacronico della biografia vittoriniana, ma indaga invece dei percorsi paralleli lungo i quali prendono forma sincroni- camente sia la variegata produzione artistica che l'instancabile impegno politico-intellettuale dello scrittore.
