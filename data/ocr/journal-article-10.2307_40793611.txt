The Ethnographic Museum, Göteborg, Sweden. June 1994-December 1996. This report has been prepared with the help of the Museum's English lan- guage guide to the exhibition; 'Paracas Textiles' by Anne Paul (1979), pub- lished in the Museum's Etnologiska Studier, is also a valuable guide. The Ethnographic Museum in Göteborg, which has a deservedly high reputation, was moved a few years ago to its present abode, the former Industrial Museum. Subsequent financial cutbacks threatened it with clo- sure in 1995 and 1996, though legislation was passed in December 1996 for it to acquire national status from 1999 (see my notes in MEG News, Octo- ber 1996 and February 1997). The effect of all this on the morale of the staff, reduced to half its former strength, must have been considerable. However, even with much of the stored material still unpacked after the move, the Museum managed to mount this major exhibition, of which the main focus was on the important collections from ancient and recent South American cultures. It opened with a display case holding a Sioux costume and headdress, and several information panels to put the European discovery of America into context. The next case had miscellaneous artefacts chosen to illustrate the diversity of American cultures. The next room, entered through a mock-up of stone walling from Cuzco, had various photographs of ancient sites in South America, and a giant enlargement photograph of the site of Macchu Picchu. This prepared the way for the next part of the exhibition, the 'American Treasure Chamber': a largish room roughly the size of that which the last Inka, Atahualpa, had to fill with gold (and two other rooms with silver) as the price of his life and freedom - a bargain that the Spaniards did not honour. The size of this room was a graphic demonstra- tion of the vast amount of precious metal looted by Pizarro and his men. While one case did contain some gold artefacts, the 15 wall recesses and most of the centre case contained things that Indians themselves have val- ued equally, or even more: massively long stone beads; shrunken heads from the Jívaro; Jívaro body ornaments of feathers and beetles' wings; mola blouses from the Kuna of Panama; ornaments made of beads and jaguar skin from the Chaco of northern Argentina; ancient grave goods from the high Andes; a head trophy from central Brazil, collected in 1924; ancient stone figures from the Rio Negro; and a ceremonial pot from the Santarém culture, over 500 years old. The list goes on: a Nazca pot, about 2,000 years 131</page><page sequence="2">Reviews old, ancient miniature items, various silver objects including a pair of scales, ancient knives from c. AD 500, and an Inka knife, about AD 1400- 1500. The centre case was filled with a large feather mantle, c. AD 800- 1200, and other feather artefacts both ancient and from recent times. The exhibition continued into a large hall with a curving wall showing the Americas in an outline map and, linked to the relevant geographical and chronological points, various pottery styles shown with actual exam- ples. They ranged from California to Chile, and from 2500 BC to AD 1500. Close by was a female mummy from Chile, wrapped in a woollen cover- ing, about AD 1000-1500, showing that the mummification practice was not confined to Peru; also other items from the desert area of northern Chile. There was a presentation of spinning, weaving and embroidery in various Peruvian cultures; the oldest human traces are dated to c. 10,000 BC, while the oldest textiles are dated to 8,600 BC, from the Grotto of Gui- tarrero in the Central Highlands. The first ceramics are from c. 7,000 BC, from Huaca Prieta on the northern Peruvian coast, and the earliest com- plex weavings appear as (relatively) late as c. 2,300 BC. The fibres used were cotton and camelid wools (i.e. llama, vicuna, alpaca, guanaco); the tools included spindles, spindle/shuttles, combs, beater blades, and the backstrap loom, one of which was set up to show how it worked. A series of diagrams showed the weaving techniques; a vase painting was flat- tened out to illustrate the process. Weaving seemed to have been done by women, and presumably embroidery also. In general, the results were achieved by painstaking attention to detail rather than by use of sophisti- cated technology; the backstrap loom is after all one of the most rudimen- tary loom types, with its tension regulated by the weaver's backward pressure, and with hand-operated heddle and shed stick. Ornamentation comes from embroidery, application of feathers, both real and artificial, slit tapestry in blocks of colour, and painting. The major part of the exhibition in this hall was given over to display- ing the museum's collection of Paracas textiles. Paracas is a peninsula on the coast in lea province, Peru, close to the Pisco river; the archaeological site is on the neck of the peninsula and comprises three areas: the Necrop- olis, the Cavernas (deep bottle-shaped tombs), and Cerro Colorado, the porphyry hill. The buildings of the Necropolis and the deep pits of the Cavernas each contained many mummy bundles, obviously those of important people, to judge from the immense outlay of time and skill required in producing the large numbers of textiles and grave wrappings that went with each mummy. The culture is dated to approximately 900 BC-AD 400 (Early Horizon to Early Intermediate Period), though the textile remains seem to belong to a shorter time-span, c. 600-120 BC. Scientific excavation, under Julius Tello, 132</page><page sequence="3">Reviews began in 1925; the finds are mainly funerary. A typical Paracas mummy bun- dle is about 1.50 metres across at the base and the same in height; it is shaped like an off-centre cone, and rests on a circular reed mat. Paul (1979:13-16) describes and illustrates a typical Paracas mummy. To begin with, the naked body, wearing a shell necklace and bracelets, was tightly tied into a seated foetal position. A gourd bowl with food, and other items were placed on and around the corpse which was then dressed with a turban wrapped round the body and a poncho doubled and placed on the back. All this was covered with a plain cotton cloth and set into a flat shallow-walled basket. Next, a number of woven textiles were folded and put into the basket around the corpse. These might include decorative ponchos and tunics and large, plain, but finely woven cloths. A stone-headed club was included among the cloths. Now the bundle was clothed in an elaborate mantle, with a loin-cloth over the neck and shoulders; a skirt was added, then two small ponchos. A plain cotton cloth around the head made a sort of top-knot, and another was wrapped over the whole body. The basket was still uncovered at this stage. Then the whole parcel, including the basket, was enveloped in several layers of coarse textiles sewn with overcast stitches, and with a cord tied round at the top to mark where the head was. This process was repeated to make the parcel larger; the lump marking the head was enlarged, and a headband wound round at the top. A staff was then laid against the bundle and secured with several embroidered mantles; a fox skin was set on the head, and a feather fan was added to the torso area. Lastly, a long cloth was wrapped round the whole mummy assemblage which could contain over one hundred items, including wrapping cloths. Paul (ibid.) publishes a selection of those textiles in the Göteborg Muse- um which were accessioned in 1935, and are said to have come from a sin- gle mummy, probably, by analogy with material in Peru, from the Necrop- olis site which held 429 mummies. Although this textile group is almost certainly the product of grave-robbing and what would now be illegal export, the Peruvian authorities are, I gather, very happy with the Muse- um's conservation, care and display of this remarkable assembly. There is no written account of the Paracas people. A typical Paracas cloth was mostly woven in plain tabby weave, often bordered by embroidery in '4-2 stem stitch' in which the yarn goes over four warp threads and under two; this gives a very solid edge. The stitch in general use is stem-stitch, appearing as tiny slightly twilled surface stitches. Embroidery is the main decorative technique which is used to create solid figures, often condors and anthropomorphic characters in bizarre distortion which may be imposed by the constraints of the textile medium, and which show affinity with the motifs used in Nazca ceramics. This embroidery is extremely fine, carried out in parallel rows in sequence, and either portrays 133</page><page sequence="4">Reviews the motif as a block, or fills in the background, leaving the motif as a virtual negative within its field. When the motif is a block, the outline is first defined, and then the background completed in parallel rows. There seems to be internal evidence that two or three embroiderers worked together on a large textile; any piece over one metre wide is made of two joined together; and the embroidery motifs are aligned by tacking. The colours are brilliant, in reds, blues, greens, yellow, orange, brown and black. There were numerous headbands, woven and embroidered and in what Anne Paul calls 'three-dimensional cross-knit loop stitch', which appears to be built up row by row, and looking like those looped tubes that children make (Trench knitting') from yarn wound round pins driven into the end of a wooden cotton reel. Ponchos, mantles and tunics, some elaborately fringed, make up the bulk of the textile display. The climax of the exhibition had to be what Anne Paul rather baldly calls a 'rectangular weaving' in 'three-dimensional cross-knit loop stitch' measuring 100 cm x 52 cm which was in a room by itself, with several giant colour enlargements of the principal motifs hung on the surrounding walls. This is reported to have been laid over the mummy's breast, and is made up of 32 squarish openwork images, all different, with a border of similar, but smaller repeated motifs. These are linked by what may per- haps be described as a series of double ladder strips so that the overall appearance is like an 'Afghan' throw-over rug in miniature. The design is the same on both sides, and is brilliantly executed in tiny stitches in red, pink, orange, yellow, greens, blues, black and white. It is an amazing piece of skilled craftsmanship which is the only one of its kind in the world. Plate 1 illustrates one square of this textile. After this, the rest of the display wound down towards the Nazca and Moche periods, 'after Paracas', with examples of bonnets and caps orna- mented in embroidery and feather appliqué, tunics and a textile in tie-dye and patchwork; a feather mantle from the coast. There were diagrams on how to select and recognise the elements in Tiwanaku motifs depicting foot, hand, mouth, eye and staff. Miscellaneous objects include a trophy head and a Nazca pot with the same theme, various clay pots and neck- laces, a work basket from Paracas, and a Nazca quipu, a record made from various coloured strings knotted in different ways.
