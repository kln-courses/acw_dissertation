<plain_text><page sequence="1">JOURNAL OF BIBLICAL LITERATURE would disagree with the argument, I think, while accepting the conclusion. Translation is a different problem from exegesis, but translation, being itself interpretation, depends upon a process of exegesis and presupposes it, where exegesis does not depend upon translation. Illman was right not to consider Buber's biblical translation, but he gives the wrong reason for the omission. The question, then, is whether Illman has his finger on Buber's exegetical theory, and whether Buber's own practice coheres with that theory. A thorough critique of the former would require repetition of Illman's theoretical investigations, which I have not done. Buber himself did not set forth his exegetical theory systematically, but Illman's three-level scheme seems workable and non-distortive as a theoretical reconstruction. I suspect that it is not the last word, since Illman can give only a qualified affirmative to the question of the cohesion between theory and praxis. A sentence fascinatingly dual in meaning closes his summary of the section on Buber's stylistic analysis: "Weil diese Interpretation oft als keineswegs zwingend erscheint, sind wir berechtigt hier von einer Tendenz zur Synthese bei Buber zu sprechen" (p. 94). The impression of that sentence is borne out in the book's concluding summary, where Illman speaks of Buber's using both the stylistic and Tendenz analysis in a synthetic way. The unity of the method as it appears in practice would not by itself be criticizable, were it not that Buber himself apparently thought of the stylistic approach and tradition criticism as "analytic" methods and the historical study as "synthetic" (cf. p. 225). If, as Illman proposes, the synthesis creeps over into the analysis, a circular argument is sneaking up on us. In fact, Illman himself finds that possibility more than remote. Buber's dialogical principle, says he, without being a "method," turns up very significantly in the actual interpretive practice. That could perhaps have been predicted, given Buber's fascination with the oral tradition as the ground of his search for the Leitwort. But it finally means, I think, that Buber's exegesis stands in the service of his theological-philosophical thrust. Such a perception in no way diminishes the remarkable insights into the text that this profound mind conveyed. It does much, however, to help us to be more precise in understanding just where Buber was going in his biblical interpretation. For the possibility of such heightened precision, Illman's thorough work deserves congratulation. EDWIN M. GOOD STANFORD UNIVERSITY, STANFORD, CA 94305 Epochen der jiidischen Geschichte, by Leo Baeck. Ed. by Hans I. Bach. Studia Delitzchiana, 16. Stuttgart: Kolhammer, 1974. Pp. 136. DM 39 (paper). During 1956, Leo Baeck delivered a series of lectures to the Monday Seminar of the Society of Jewish Studies in London, on the theme of "epochs of Jewish history." He was able to complete only the first epoch, that of the biblical period. These lectures, which were given largely in German, have been carefully reconstructed from tape recordings and from Baeck's notes. Thus we have available reflections by this great scholar and theologian upon the main movements of Israel. Unfortunately, the general title fails to describe the content adequately, so that the volume may be overlooked by persons interested particularly in the bible. Baeck views Israelite faith as a "revolution," a fundamental step beyond the established order. Specifically, in its literature, "history is written for the first time from the perspective of the defeated" (p. 26). Such a perspective is seen as inherently connected with monotheism, with its implication of a single morality for the powerful and the weak. Biblical concern with history is not contrasted with an interest in nature. Rather, following A. von Humboldt, Baeck describes Israel as the only people of antiquity which sang of the majesty of nature (p.44). He argues, a little too 288</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS boldly, that the geographical elements are the firm aspects of "all traditions regarding tribes and peoples," including those of Israel (pp. 44-45, 47). Baeck finds that Israelite prophets were similar to other figures but reveal also a special character. The prophets were instances of "genius" and developed a peculiar style for genius in the "monologue" (pp. 104-9). They shared paradox with other great religious figures and served by creating a "logic of paradox," namely the entry of the eternal into the earthly in the form of law, opposing despotism (pp. 114-18). According to Baeck, in Israel as elsewhere, personal reflection led to social sensitivity, so that both monologue and law are inherently involved in the epitome of prophetic style, the utopia. This creative integration of psychological, literary, and theoretical aspects of prophecy follows the lead of Hermann Cohen and Ernst Bloch. It deserves attention in its own right and can serve as a model for further work on the bible. Naturally, one can raise questions at various points. Comparisons with Buddhism can serve for illustration. On the one hand, the expression (p. 99, indeed qualified by "perhaps") that the prophets, like the Buddha, liberated religion from the state seems excessively modern; the similarity may be better formulated by saying that a major strain in prophetism, as in Buddhism, pointed toward an ultimate reality (or unreality) standing in contrast to the finite and imperfect world. On the other hand, the supposed contrast between the Buddha as "resigned" and the prophets as "strong" (p. 101) understates the element of individual and social activity in Buddhism and that of receptivity in the prophets.

Yet the strength and contribution of the volume lies not in these, but in its reach for understanding. Christian theologians may be aided especially by the Jewish cast of the reflections.

BSt 65. Neukirchen-Vluyn: Neukirchener Verlag, 1975. Pp. 127. DM 14 (paper). Jeremias has produced a study of nhm when the root is used to express Yahweh's change of mind concerning his action toward men. The author challenges the widespread assumption that the biblical notion of God's changing his mind began in the naive anthropomorphic view of primitive folk culture. On the contrary, Jeremias argues, the concept originated in the self- conscious reflective processes of theological narrators. In the two earliest appearances of the concept (Gen 6; 1 Sam 15) God's nhm does not appear in the earlier stages of oral transmission but rather at the later period of theological refinement. In both passages God repents concerning a Heilsplan which had already been accomplished. His change of will is not a recurring divine attribute. On the contrary, in each instance Yahweh repents only once. Although men continue sinning after the flood, God never again changes his will as he did in the time of Noah. Nor does he repent that he had chosen David and his descendants as he did with Saul, though the former were certainly as sinful as the ill-fated Saul. These once-for-all-time examples of nhm, Jeremias argues, are the narrators' theological rationalization for singular events of punishment. Besides, in the case of 1 Sam 15, the biases of a theologian sympathetic to the Davidic dynasty lie behind the use of nhm. In contrast with these two earliest usages of the concept, the vast majority of the instances of Yahweh's nhm have to do with his possible change of will concerning afuture plan ofjudgment. This understanding of nhm developed and changed over the centuries, Jeremias contends. In Amos and Hosea nhm is a decision in which Yahweh alone determines whether he should alter his intended act of judgment. No appeal is made to Israel's merit or to Yahweh's obligations; nhm is rooted purely in Yahweh's inner desire to change his course of action. By the time Exod 32 emerges, however, Yahweh's change of mind is motivated by outside concerns such as his oath to the patriarchs. In the Deuteronomistic portions of Jeremiah matters external to Yahweh's mind take on still greater importance; Israel's repentance becomes a virtual guarantee that God will alter his intentions to punish. Indeed, from the exile on, the expectation of Yahweh's change of mind serves as a warning to motivate repentance. In the post-exilic books of Joel and Jonah the Deuteronomistic-Jeremianic connection between God's nhm and Israel's repentance is maintained, but with one major difference; Yahweh's change of willdoes not happen almost automatically when the people repent, but rather the hearers are told that perhaps Yahweh will alter his catastrophic plan. A review is necessarily selective, but the reader should be able to detect that Jeremias has given us a provocative treatment of a theologically significant biblical motif. No one interested in biblical theology will want to miss reading this book. ROY F. MELUGIN AUSTIN COLLEGE, SHERMAN, TX 75090</page></plain_text>
