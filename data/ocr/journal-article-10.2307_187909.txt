Philip Kitcher has produced the anti-sociobiologist's bible. If there are any defects in the program of sociobiology that remain undetected by Kitcher, they can be neither sig- nificant nor easy to identify. Exponents of sociobiology can take some comfort from this searching indictment of the best as well as the worst of their work, however. For Kitcher's aims do not go so far as providing an impossibility proof for the enterprise he dissects. Though his tone mixes equal parts of mockery and raillery, and extends to occasional suggestions of scientific deceit, his aims are not wholly negative. He expounds and lauds the advances in our understanding already made in non-human sociobiology, and attempts to draw from them standards that a biological examination of human behavior should sat- isfy. He then goes on to show that almost nothing in the current literature of human so- ciobiology, from the popularizations of Barish to the high theory of Wilson and Lumsden, seems to measure up to these standards. Vaulting Ambition ends with the hope that in showing these defects, Kitcher may foster the development of a scientifically responsible sociobiology. Save for its last chapter, Vaulting Ambition is not primarily a work of philosophy, though philosophers will find its style of argument familiar. The work maintains a fine impartiality concerning issues in the philosophy of biology. On the other hand, the demands on readers' understanding of complex matters in biology, and the importance of Kitcher's fourteen "technical discussions," may daunt those who hope to skip over the introductory detail Vaulting Ambition is full of. This is noted, not as a point of criticism, but rather as a caution about what to expect from this volume. Kitcher begins with the recognition that sociobiology is more than just an abstract pos- sibility. The potential explanatory and predictive import of evolutionary theory for the behavior of many species has been established beyond question, particularly in the elab- oration of the concepts of inclusive fitness and evolutionarily stable strategies. But the adaptation of this theoretical apparatus to significant aspects of human behavior has been incautious at best. The attempt to explain xenophobia and aggression, differences in mating strategies, class-structures, etc., as the outcome of selection over genetic vari- ation Kitcher calls "pop sociobiology"-to indicate the popular fascination it has exer- cised, and not, Kitcher insists, to deride it as simple-minded or superficial. Pop socio- biology claims the relevance of Darwinian theory to particular types of human behavior on the strength of an argument Kitcher calls (E.O.) "Wilson's Ladder." The rungs of this ladder lead from the identification of some actual persistently prevalent behavior as adap- tive, on an evolutionary time scale, through the hypothesis of a genetic basis for the be- havior, to the conclusion that it is fixed within the range of environmental variables we can hope to manipulate. Kitcher's strategy is to show that all the leading applications of Wilson's Ladder to particular examples of human behavior are vitiated by one or another of a large range of mistakes, unargued assumptions, and methodological non sequiturs. Some of these charges have been made before, but rarely with so much care and diagnostic interest. For instance, Kitcher's discussion of the hoary charge of "anthropomorphism"- describing animal behavior in terms usually reserved for human action, and then turning back to explain the human action as mere behavior-greatly transcends the usual outcry about misdefining altruism and selfishness. He focuses on the terms animal and human sociobiologists employ to describe mating systems, showing that they do not sit well with animals, and so vitiate potential homologies to the human case. Similarly, Kitcher's dis- cussion of optimality arguments about adaptation in human and infra-human behavior does not throw out the baby with the bathwater, but cautiously circumscribes the limits of such arguments, while identifying exciting examples of their fruitful application in nonhuman cases. 607</page><page sequence="2">608 BOOK REVIEWS Those seeking arguments against sociobiology will be drawn to Kitcher's dissection of well-known sociobiological analyses of homosexuality, racial hostility, and the incest ta- boo. Aside from illustrating many of the lapses committed by those climbing "Wilson's Ladder," Kitcher also shows that for relatively small changes in initial conditions, the same adaptive behavioral strategies sociobiologistis cite, will lead to quite different outcomes from those they seek to explain. The best example of this sort of argument is to be found in Kitcher's treatment of the distinctive contributions of Richard Alexander. Thus, at- tempting to undermine Alexander's explanation of matrilineages as the result of uncertain paternity, Kitcher points out that the calculating power and genetic information attributed to men could, if attributed to women, lead to a female strategy that undermines the very existence of such matrilineages. Though, as Kitcher rightly notes, Alexander's program does not attempt to ascend "Wilson's Ladder" to genetic fixity of behavior; its explanation of behavior is little better than window dressing on potential participant folk-psychological accounts of why they act as they do. Kitcher hopes to clinch his argument against contemporary human sociobiology by a searching examination of the mathematically complex theory of gene-culture co-evolution that Lumsden and Wilson have constructed in order to extend the original sociobiological insights while accommodating the role of the social environment in the determination of human behavior. He argues that the verbal statement of gene-culture theory is obvious and unenlightening, while the mathematical version is unwarrantably complex, arbitrary, coun- terintuitive, and gerrymandered. In fact he stigmatizes the main results of the mathematical development of the theory as "juggling," "artifice," and "trickery." While these terms of abuse are not actionable, they are too strong both for propriety and for Kitcher's conclu- sions. The basis of these charges is that Lumsden and Wilson have chosen values for param- eters and coefficients of their formulae with an eye to deriving conclusions in agreement with data antecedently available. Yet, given the paucity of any good data supporting in- teresting generalizations in the social sciences, it is no wonder advocates of a new theory would attempt to incorporate as its consequences the slim body of conclusions generally accepted in the discipline. What Kitcher stigmatizes as pseudo-science, Lumsden and Wil- son will view as retrodiction, or, at least, as satisfaction of the demand that their theory accord with such clear data as are already at hand. Kitcher points out that all three of the examples of cultural regularities allegedly explained by gene-culture theory can just as well be accounted for by commonsense assumptions about preferences plus a little prob- ability theory. True enough, but it has been dissatisfaction with just such explanations that has made sociobiology attractive. It is therefore no surprise that sociobiologists should begin by trying to explain data that is already in, before we spend the time, money, and effort necessary to dig up new data that will test the theory more strongly, or help us improve its formalism. The values of coefficients and parameters in Lumsden and Wilson's formalism thus seem more like constraints on their theory than numbers fiddled to make it come out right. Indeed, if the variables must take on unreasonable values in order to derive the regularities sociobiologists hope to explain, then the obviousness of this fact belies the charges of trickery. Kitcher's last chapter is devoted to exploding the claims made on behalf of the relevance of sociobiology to ethics. His criticisms of the notion that ethical claims might follow from biological ones are unanswerable. At least on this last subject, Vaulting Ambition should be the last word. As for the rest, sociobiologists will not take it lying down. They had better not take it lightly. Alexander Rosenberg, University of California, Riverside</page></plain_text>
