<plain_text><page sequence="1">MATERIAL CULTURE STUDIES AT BRITISH UNIVERSITIES CAMBRIDGE Ian Hodder is a lecturer in archaeology at Cambridge It was as a result of Haddon's 1898-99 Torres Straits Expedition that material culture studies first came to play a significant role in the development of anthropology in Cambridge. Louis Clarke recalls that in the period up to 1900 hardly any students used the anthropological collections in the Museum, established in 1884. There was no Tripos in Anthro- pology and no Board of Anthropological Studies. Haddon, as a result of his expedition, was able to contribute to the attempt to convince the University that anthropology was a serious academic pursuit and the expedition provided the Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology with a well-documented and comprehen- sive collection. Haddon was appointed University Lecturer in Ethnology in 1900, and in 1903 a Syndicate of the University recommended setting up a Board of Anthropological Studies which embraced Prehistoric and Historic Anthropology, Ethnology (including Sociology and Comparative Religion), Physical Anthropology and Psychological Anthro- pology. Initially, then, material culture studies played an integral part in a broad conception of Anthropology. In 1920 the Museum was brought under a new Board of Archaeological and Anthropological Studies because, according to Haddon, 'it was considered desirable to coordinate the teachings of Archaeology and Ethnology with the museum ... since the latter was becoming increasingly an adjunct to the teaching'. Haddon's research policy was the intensive study of limited areas. There was an interest in the totality of material culture. The collection and study of objects in the Museum fitted well into this conception of the study of human society while it also helped to achieve the practical purpose of teaching the country's future colonial administrators something of what they might be dealing with. Through the 20s and 30s the Museum continued to play a role in an undivided Tripos. The main material culture con- cerns may have been with taxonomy, tech- nology and with how things worked. Undergraduates such as Grahame Clark in the late 20s obtained a solid practical training in objects. In the early 30s Glyn Daniel was given classes in making pots and casting, and practical examinations included the identification of archaeolo- gical and ethnographic objects. Material culture played a role (perhaps fifth of the :otal) in the teaching of archaeology and rnthropology students, and there were ssues both general and particular. Sayce's Primitive Arts and Crafts was used and here was discussion of skeuomorphs, liffusion and independent invention. In he 1940 examinations, for example, all -andidates, whatever their optional papers, iad to take a material culture paper which Lsked for accounts of slings, bolas and assoes but also showed an interest in ,eneral theories of cultural regression and ealism in primitive art. After the Second World War, the role of 13</page><page sequence="2">material culture studies diminished. Museum curators came to give only a few lectures in archaeology and anthropology and there was little integration of material culture studies into the teaching. Much of the theoretical relevance of material culture became lost. In the new 'divided' Tripos, material culture was still taught jointly to archaeology and anthropology students in the first year, but separately to the archaeologists and anthropologists in their second and third years. In the first year, through the 50s and early 60s, links between archaeology and anthropology were still often through the medium of material culture and there was a general concern with the use of ethnographic parallels to explain the past and with the joint use of archaeological and ethno- graphic material to confront general issues concerning, for example, primary and secondary diffusion. Material culture studies, themselves, however, were often restricted to problems such as how to make fire without matches. This descriptive atheoretical character finally led in the early 70s to the disappearance of all material culture teaching and ethnography practicals for the first year joint archaeology and anthropology course. Throughout the 50s and 60s material culture was involved in the teaching of comparative technology to second and third year social anthropologists. But the focus of discussion was on such things as stringed musical instruments and on basic technological processes. It was not until the teaching and collections of the Stratherns, Malcolm McLeod and Peter Gathercole in the late 60s and early 70s that broader theoretical issues, including questions of symbolism, led to renewed interest in material culture. Debbie Swallow and staff and research students of the Department of Social Anthropology continued this development in teaching and research and there is now a strong theoretical interest in material culture within Cambridge Social Anthropology. An indication that the aura of descriptive ethnography had been left behind occurred when the name of the museum was changed to the University Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology. A new MPhil, in Social Anthropology and the Museum, consolidates these links between anthropology and the material culture collections. Archaeological interest in material culture teaching for second and third year students also declined in the post-war period. Throughout the 50s and 60s there was no specific teaching in contemporary material culture. Despite considerable knowledge and use of ethnographic data in reconstructions of the past by, for example Grahame Clarke, students were not lencouraged to obtain first hand knowledge of ethnographic collections. In 1970 the interest in contemporary material culture from a theoretical standpoint was acknowledged by the teaching of a course on 'Ethnography for archaeologists' by Peter Gathercole. General philosophical and social questions continued to be central in the expansion of this teaching by Gathercole and the author and there is now a third year paper in ethnoarchae- 4 ology and a separate MPhil, in this topic. The general rise in popularity of ethno- archaeology in other parts of the world is seen in Britain most clearly at Cambridge where there are now 11 full time PhD students conducting ethnoarchaeology in Sudan, W., E. and S. Africa, India, Canada and the Mediterranean. Long-term field work is now standard procedure and students are prepared for this by under- graduate and first-year postgraduate teaching of field methods, participation in other ethnoarchaeological projects, and by advice and seminars given in the Depart- ment of Anthropology. Collections are frequently made for the Museum and displays provided. The decline in interest in material culture studies in Cambridge in the post- war period up to the late 60s can be associated with tendencies to see archaeology and anthropology as pro- viding a universal doctrine and philosophy, and with the search for universal laws. In the development of functional laws of society, it is clearly conceivable that laws of material culture organization might have been developed. But the historical concreteness of material culture which so attracted Haddon were too much in contrast with the abstractions of cross-cultural ahistorical laws. More recently material culture has again found a secure place in anthropological theory through semiotics, and the study of practice and power, and within a historical )erspective. In the current extensive reorganization of the Museum new dis- ?lays are being prepared under the lirection of the curator, David Phillipson, n which artefacts are presented in a liachronic perspective in the context of the ;ociety which uses or used them, rather han as individual art objects or echnological specimens. As in Haddon's lay the concern with historical and -ultural contexts seems to be encouraging l renewed interest in material culture and, hrough material culture, there is the ,ossibility of renewed integration between trchaeology and anthropology. ran Hodder LEICESTER rane Legget is a lecturer in the Department f Museum Studies, University of leicester. is repositories of material culture, nuseums hold primary evidence for esearch into this growing field of cademic interest. A greater understanding f the nature of material culture can only nhance the care and use of collections by urators and the publics which they serve. t is with this in mind that in 1979 the )epartment of Museum Studies, Jniversity of Leicester, introduced a new ourse devoted to material culture in the ne year postgraduate curatorial training rogramme. The curatorial training ffered is mainly interdisciplinary, Ithough students do take one option Durse from Archaeology, Geology, [istory, History of Science &amp; Technology, [atural History or Education; the choice nerally reflects undergraduate studies or revious museum experience. These different backgrounds bring a variety of perspectives to the course entitled Materials and Culture, in which different materials (both as raw materials and finished products) are explored. The course aims to enable students to identify the physical characteristics of the principal materials encountered in museum -ollections for the purposes of classifi- -ation, appropriate handling, storage and display methods, writing basic condition reports, description and documentation ind assigning historical, cultural and geographical origins. Properties, uses and technologies are considered. An additional Dbjective is to introduce the major theoretical approaches to the students to issess the significance of objects in their )riginal context and in their present-day ,ontext in museum collections. The ^elevance of the course to natural history md geology option students may not be mmediately obvious but items from latural sciences collections become part of )ur material culture in their new roles as nuseum specimens. Curators of such -ollections have a vital contribution to )ffer to their colleagues in human history lepartments in identifying the sources of iatural materials which have been utilized )y man in such diversity, particularly in -thnographic collections. Their special -xpertise is likely to be drawn on further as trtefacts from other museum disciplines tttract the attention of material culture cholars and students. The course is presented weekly by ectures illustrated with slides, objects, ools and raw materials; films and visits to nuseums, and student studies of selected naterials. Assessment takes the form of an ndividual artefact study which explores lot only the component materials and heir curatorial implications but also the ultural meanings embodied in the rtefact. In recent years a large minority of tudents (c 400/o) have come from overseas nd the interpretations of the artefacts eflect diverse cultural backgrounds. All his strongly reinforces the fundamental ioint that each individual museum visitor pproaches an artefact in his or her own 'ay and that curators must be alert to this act in every exhibition which they mount. It will be self-evident, therefore, that in 'rder to interpret artefacts in museum ollections in a meaningful way to a pecific intended public, a broader nderstanding of material aspects of ulture, beyond that of one traditional cademic discipline, can only benefit the ltending curator. The course continues to volve and it is hoped to increase the ieoretical material culture content in :ming years. .A. Legget OUTHAMPTON eter J. Ucko is professor of archaeology 'the University of Southampton t the University of Southampton, the )proach to archaeology emphasizes the iriety of information about past societies at can be gained by the study of their iltural remains. This information is covered through analytic studies guided theoretical frameworks and tested</page><page sequence="3">against exacting standards, including thos of quantitative analysis. It is used to interpret patterns of past behaviour, and to explain the mechanisms of cultural change and social evolution. Since its foundation in 1966 the Department of Archaeology had become well-known for a variety of different archaeological interests, including method and theory, ceramic studies and the study of animal remains from archaeological sites. The Department lays particular stress oi the inter-disciplinary nature of archaeology as the basis for achieving its aim of understanding past societies and their material culture. For this reason it is represented in both the Arts and Science Faculties and is currently negotiating representation in the Social Sciences Faculty. It has also developed links with many other departments in the University, including History, Geography, Classics, Geology, Sociology, Social Statistics, and the Department of Adult Education. As is well-known the aims of prehistory and archaeology have been changing rapidly over the last ten years. Archaeology is no longer concerned simpl, with reconstructing the culture history sequences of particular areas. It now takes as its domain the study of material culture irrespective of time and place, and its relationship to the social and economic organization of the groups which produce( it. Material culture studies provide access to many behavioural realms (symbolic, technological, social) in many different contexts (artistic, informational, religious, subsistence). In my Curl Lecture which was published by the Royal Anthropological Institute in 1969, I identified the future development of archaeology as examining the integral significance of material culture studies to a study of the past: 'If there is one thing which distinguishes the study of material culture from most other aspects of anthro- pological investigation, it is that its data are manufactured objects ... The essential quality of material culture studies is that re-analysis is possible at all times ... It is al this point that the artificiality of the present-day academic division between the study of present-day and past material culture becomes evident, for the qualities of the material under consideration are exactly the same in both cases and the methodology and many of the aims coin- cide. Despite all the sophistications of modern analysis of prehistory the essential tenet of any material culture investigation is, and must be, that the morphology of artefacts is a reality which reflects some cultural situation and that this level of social reality is not more or less meaning- ful than any other that may be discovered by analysis. It is the job of those who study material culture, whether in an ethnographic or in an archaeological con- text, to try to establish how social and cultural realities are reflected in the material evidence. ' The Department of Archaeology in Southampton is trying to respond to these changes by undertaking research in the broader aspects of the subject, and under- graduate courses have been altered so that they are now oriented around themes rather than around specific periods and areas. The exploration of general themes can only develop to their full potential if carried out on a worldwide basis so that a proper comparative approach may be developed. As soon as staffing will allow, new posts will be filled by experts who can concen- trate on widening the geographical scope of teaching and research in material culture. For example, an approach based on the theme of how material culture objects correspond to the recognition of social categories and social boundaries recognized by the cultures concerned could easily be formulated, and tested, within many areas of Africa or India. The South American continent would be an ideal one in which to examine the general theme of why particular technological innovations are seen to be advatageous or non-advant- ageous to the potential cultural recipients, especially if focused on the use of metals. The aims of the Department are exem- plified by existing and planned research by staff and postgraduates which, as well as covering many aspects of traditional archaeological enquiry, include the analysis of prehistoric art systems, the examination of the roles, preconceptions and politics of archaeological interpre- tation within the wider social context, and the study of Mediterranean pottery pro- duction and distribution within an economic framework. Peter J. Ucko UNIVERSITY COLLEGE LONDON Mike Rowlands is reader in anthropology at UCL. Material culture in an anthropological context is scarcely ever about artefacts per se. The term connotes instead the ambivalent feelings that anthropologists have had towards their evolutionist and diffusionist origins and towards museum studies, reflecting also their concern that the subject, in an age of specialization, should still aspire to be a totalizing and integrative approach to the study of man. The term is therefore metaphorical rather than sub-disciplinary and survived as a conceptual category to allow certain kinds of study to be practised that would not fit any of the canons established during the rise to hegemony of British social anthro- pology in the inter-war years. Anthropology at University College London is one of the few university departments in Britain where the com- bination of physical anthropology, social anthropology and material culture is still retained in an Honours degree. It con- tinues to attract every year a sizeable number of students who are presumably not attracted to go to departments where they would do only social anthropology; thus they indicate a preference for this breadth of perspective over the usual social anthropology courses. It is worthwhile therefore trying to understand how this came about. The first striking feature is that the Department is relatively young. It was established in 1945 by the late Professor Daryll Forde whom Ioan lewis rightly described in his obituary as 'a remarkable person, a true prodigy, with a width and wealth of knowledge and interests rarely encountered today'. 1 It may well be that UCL had already gained a certain notoriety due to its previous association with the anthropology of Elliott Smith, for whom incidentally Daryll Forde, at least in his earlier writings, had some respect. 2 But it is clear, from the documents prepared for the establishment of a new department in anthropology at UCL, that Daryll Forde had in mind a subject that reflected his own broad interests in archaeology, geography and what was then only an embryonic social anthropology. His friendship with Gordon Childe, whom he had first got to know as librarian of the RAI in the early 1920's and who was soon to become Director of the Institute of Archaeology in London, probably confirmed his expectations tht close links between the two subjects could be established. Moreover his association with Kroeber and Lowie and the California tradition of anthropology provided him with the totalizing model by which he could visualize a certain kind of synthesis where others would see only rags and patches. In addition, he was instrumental in establishing the University degree of anthropology on a similar wide basis such that until the mid 60's all anthropology students in London, not just those at UCL, combined studies in social anthropology, physical anthropology, archaeology and linguistics in the first two years of their degree. Since, in his view, ecology formed the mediator between the social and biological sciences, one can also understand the emphasis he placed on the teachings of 'primitive technology' and material culture in the Department, to complement courses given at the Institute of Archaeology. To develop these he fostered close teaching links with staff in the Ethnography Department at the British Museum and established a teaching ,ollection of material culture at UCL. It was, however, only in the early 60's, with the appointment of Peter Ucko, that Leaching in archaeology and material ,ulture was institutionalized within the Department. It was indicative of Daryll Forde's willingness to encourage others' mnthusiasm for their subject, that by the ate 60's Peter Ucko was teaching courses n all three years to complement the social md physical anthropology streams and iad initiated postgraduate research. vloreover, since there was no point in ,imply duplicating teaching in archaeology o be found elsewhere in the University, he term material culture was adopted to mphasize an approach which combined he study of both contemporary and past ion-literate cultures from the point of iew of the material record. Two rather inasic insights motivated this new synthesis. "he first, presented very clearly by Ucko n his Curl lecture in 1969, stressed that ttention to the construction of the laterial world in contemporary studies iould provide otherwise unobtainable ~sights into cultural life. 3The second, hiat anthropology would increasingly have come to terms with the past: for many -called non-literate societies that past tould be constructed archaeologically;</page><page sequence="4">with the end of their colonial role, anthropologists might return to some of the macro-sociological questions that had pre-occupied their 19th century forebears, and a renewed focus on historical and evolutionary questions would facilitate closer cooperation between anthro- pologists, archaeologists and historians. It can now be asked whether in the intervening fifteen years or so, any of these expectations have been fulfilled and what is the likely future of such studies? In the 60's and early 70's when structuralism was a dominant influence in British social anthropology, there was greater sympathy for contemporary material culture studies and, in particular, the anthropology of art. Peter Ucko, himself a prolific writer in this field, first established teaching in the anthropology of art at UCL in collabora- tion with Anthony Forge then at the LSE. Ucko's own research was on Palaeolithic cave art and rock art cross-culturally which he pursued in a three year pro- gramme in Spain in the early 70's and subsequently on Australian aboriginal art when he became Director of the Institute of Aboriginal Studies in 1972.4 Also his editorship of the 'Art in Society' series published by Duckworth produced some standard works such as the Stratherns' SelJ Decoration in Mount Hagen and Faris's Nuba Personal Art. More recent developments have already been summarized by Danny Miller and it is necessary only to stress two aspects of these. First, developments occurring outside anthropology in fields such as popular art and culture, the sociology of art (particularly Bourdieu's work), folklore studies and ethnoarchaeology, form a much broader range of experimen- tation and new insights than were available ten years ago. Second, there is a more secure theoretical base in cognitive studies for understanding the significance of the material world in objectification processes. The problems one had then of convincing any social anthropologist that such studies were worthwhile, given the dominance that structuralism gave to the language medium, seem rather quaint in hindsight. However, the image of material culture in anthropology remains one of isolated exotic artefacts and colonial bric a brac, which sometimes photographs on the front cover of RAIN do little to dispel. Equally I can't help feeling that some more recent ethnoarchaeological work starting with the premise of examining a living community as if it were dead and a suitable case for archaeological treatment, doesn't also result in the fetishization of the artefact. More exciting questions on the structuring of aesthetic response, the relation between aesthetics and politics, the rationality of the imagination, and objectification as a cognitive principle, are still in their infancy and promise to form the central focus to contemporary material culture studies in the future. With the resurgence of Marxist approaches in anthropology in the early 70's, historical and evolutionary problems became fashionable once more. Such questions seem to be on the wane again as social anthropology attempts to restructure its definition of the contemporary. But the intervening period has produced some exciting developments and the impact of anthropological and sociological approaches in archaeology is likely to have an enduring effect. Some of these developments were already foreseen in the late 60's with the establishment in London of the Research Seminar in Archaeology, Anthropology and related subjects. The first seminar, published under the editor- ship of Peter Ucko, was the first to bring together archaeologists, anthropologists and biologists and produce a synthesis of recent work on the transition to agriculture as a formative stage in the development of human society. Subsequent seminars and publications on urbanism, social evolu- tion, art, death and funerary ritual have continued this interdisciplinary tradition. Meetings of the joint committee on archaeology and anthropology of the RAI (a report of the first meeting was published in the June issue of RAIN) also offer another avenue for interdisciplinary work. Questions relating to historical social change, either long-term or short-term, and the role of historical consciousness in contemporary politics, thus promise to remain important issues in the social sciences for the foreseeable future, and a Department which has built up teaching and research expertise in anthropology, archaeology and history can rightly claim to have played a significant role in furthering such goals. At the beginning of this piece, I argued that material culture as a term had more metaphorical than sub-disciplinary connotations for anthropology. As a category it has played an important role as an intellectual refuge during periods of antipathy when anthropology's rupture with its 19th century origins threatened to abolish all questions that recalled a tainted past. It may always need to be preserved as such, since to rupture such a category is always to place its contents in danger. On the other hand, the themes I have described here have taken on a life of their own and in a period of reconsidering the aims and objectives of anthropology, we may need to consider whether the category does not act as a fetter on further developments. Undoubtedly, many of these solid achievements are the result of teaching and research in a Department that maintains a strong commitment to an holistic approach to anthropology. For this we can be grateful to the foresight and vision of Daryll Forde nearly forty years ago and to the energy and enthusiasm of Peter Ucko in establishing the material culture section in more or less its present form.
