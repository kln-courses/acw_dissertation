Hedley Hedley Design ABSTRACT The manipulator subsystem. an anthropomorphic device, has been analysed in terms of features and characteristics that are peculiar to its application. Extensive preflight analysis and testing [Fig. 4M ] using various finite analysis methods, computer programs, and techniques [Appendix A] has satisfied the unique and stringent constraints the remote manipulator system is required to operate under [Appendix B], The system is the pioneer of the space payload transportation system. Future generations will satisfy a diversity of needs through variations of design. Employment of this system will, through time, dictate the tolerances that may be relaxed or tightened. PREAMBLE SPAR AEROSPACE LIMITED OF WESTON. ONTARIO under contract to the National Research Council of Canada has developed the Shuttle Remote Manipulator System [SRMS] for National Aeronautics and Space Administration [NASA] Space Program. The SRMS is the Space Transportation Payload Handling System that is presently being developed for use on board space shuttles. This subject was chosen for the features and characteristics present and its relation to mechanical engineering. This report will be focused on the analysis of the Remote Manipulator Arm of SRMS [Fig. #2] in its mechanical aspects and related to the main system as necessary for clarification. The demand for Remote Manipulator Systems increases as resource development potential is realized utilizing satellite communication systems, specialized chemicals and fluids processing and crystal growth. [3) DISCUSSION Certain design criteria had to be met in the development of a remote manipulator system for on-board orbiter use in space. SAFETY - The crew's safety, orbiter and payload is the main factor in the design of the S.R.M.S. with the crew's safety as the overriding factor. The factor of safety is increased almost infinitely through the incorporation of redundant systems. Any single system failure will not render the arm inoperative; thus it is a fail-safe system. However. it will operate at a lower performance level. Built-in test - equipment [BITE] circuits alert the crew as a limit is approached that may produce a failure if that limit is exceeded. If a failure does not permit the backup systems to "re-cradle" the arm in the cargo bay. the arm may be jettisoned to save the orbiter crew. *Wagner-Bartak. O.G..

Pg. 5. 7.1251</page><page sequence="4">Design Parameters for the SRMS include: Provision for sufficient display for the required accuracy of control. The arm structure must remain within a dynamic envelope at elevated "g" forces during launchings and landings. The ease of control must remain constant in loaded and unloaded conditions. SOFTWARE SUBSYSTEM - This provides the translation from the operator commands to servo commands controlling the joint positioning. The operator commands are transferred from the control station to the Manipulator Controller Interface Unit [MCIU] to the General Purpose Computer [GPC] to the RMS software. The software controls the input to the GPC for payload translational and rotational velocities, maximum joint angle rates and payload mass properties. DISPLAY AND CONTROL SUBSYSTEM The subsystem provides the feedback and other necessary information to operate the RMS [Fig. 03 and Fig. #4). A keyboard input to the GPC operator panel displays and controls allows the operator to use one of three arm operation modes. Single - GPC supports hand controller inputs to individual joints. Direct - Hardwire command to each joint, bypassing the GPC. Separate - A dedicated backup system that provides a joint by joint on/off switch control. ELECTRICAL SUBSYSTEM - This controls the power flow to the appropriate motors for the given commands and relays verification data to the GPC for display on the operator control panel. Fig. #3 Simulator Control Panel^* Fig. #4 Computer Generated Scene Monitor^* 7.1252</page><page sequence="5">861795 MANIPULATOR ARM SUBSYSTEM This system is a structural member possessing six degrees of freedom CDOF] provided by six electromechanical rotary joints [Fig. 02). Location of attachment to the orbiter is on the port or starboard longeron of the cargo bay. The DOF is provided by [viewed from the cargo bay) shoulder yaw, pitch, elbow pitch, wrist pitch, yaw and roll. The manipulator arm subsystem is divided into the four groups. Close Circuit Television and Light Assemblies - The CCTV and Light Assemblies enhance operator control. One tilt, pan and zoom camera is mounted at the elbow joint viewing the position of the end effector. A second camera is mounted on the end effector, giving an image that the operator would have if he were flying on the end effector. Lights illuminate the field of vision for CCTV monitor viewing. Thermal Protection - This is provided to keep the electronic packages and electromechanical devices within the critical operating temperatures.

The worst case cold condition is with the orbiter tail to the sun. Twelve thermistors are placed in temperature sensitive areas allowing the crew to monitor the state of the parts. Heaters are automatically controlled to heat the required parts to the acceptable operating temperature. The heaters are a resistance silicone rubber variety. The heaters are strategically placed on the exterior of the joints, the interior of the joint electronic housing compartment and the interior of the end effector as the heat requirements servicing and maintenance aspects dictate. Insulating blankets protect the arm when it is exposed to a worse case hot condition. The blanket is manufactured from two layers of .3 mil. single goldized kapton (the kapton layer facing outward) and two layers of double goldized kapton with dacron scrim cloth separating the layers. A protective outer layer is a teflon coated fiberglass fabric. The blankets are attached to the arm by velcro tape. All metalized layers are grounded to the arm by flying leads. Degraded white paint is used as a reflective medium where it is not practical to shield it with the blanket; the full length of the electrical compartment, the exterior of the end effector housing and the retention fitting flanges that secure the arm in the cargo bay. End Effector - The end effector is located at the extreme end of the manipulator arm (Fig. 05). Its function is to snare the payload grappling fixture and cause the arm to become secured to the payload. As the end effector surrounds the grapple shaft (Fig. 06) the snare wires begin to close on the grapple fixture. These cables close much the same as the aperature of a camera. As the cables secure the fixture a "soft docking" occurs. (Fig. 07) The retracting carriage withdraws into the end effector forcing full contact with the fixture plate. Keyed orientation with the grapple fixture is provided with the cam lobes on the grapple fixture. The carriage (Fig. 0B) retracts with a force of 000 pounds providing a "hard dock" interface that allows maximum payload manoeuvring rates.

Bray grease 3L-3BRP wet is used to prevent clogging that occurred with the dry lubricant on small bearings. These bearings are required to accelerate 7000 r/min. in one second^ . Mechanical Arm - The mechanical arm has been designed to meet stringent constraints such as weight, geometry and stiffness. From theories of dynamics and control of flexible structures, it has been known that: Nl. Structural flexibility is capable of degrading a control system in the sense that it can make a stable rigid body system unstable. 2. Structural loads in response to a disturbance are higher in a flexible body that in a similar rigid body. 3. The dynamics of a flexible body are more complicated, thus more difficult to analyze, than those for a rigid body because of the larger number of degrees of freedom and the coupling between rigid body and elastic degrees of freedom. The arm structure is provided by the joint housing, electronics housing and the arm booms. From these come all inherent flexing."^* The arm booms are thin walled and circular in cross section. The walls are manufactured from an ultra high modulus material, graphite epoxy GY-70/93M to meet the high stiffness and strength requirements. *Wensley, P.C..

Internal stabilization rings manufactured from an aluminum alloy T2219-T6 are placed strategically along the inside of the boom arms. This application of rings reduces the brazier effect, increases the natural ovalization frequencies of the side wall *MacNaughton. J.D.. A Review of Canadian Space Activities.

Pg. 501. to a minimum value of 100 HZ. a value that is above the undesirable high energy acoustic range. The carbon composite booms are mated with aluminum end rings to form an interface with the joint housings. The A356 aluminum end rings reduce localized stress in the boom material. The end rings are bonded to the GY-70/934 graphite epoxy by a high strength epoxy T300/934 for a better union. The boom arms are protected by a bumper system. The protection medium 7.1256</page><page sequence="9">861795 Fig. #0 End Effector Cut Away^)* is composed of one layer of precrushed Nomex honeycomb surrounded on the outside by one ply of kevlar 102 fabric and bonded to the arm boom. This bumper system will absorb energy up to 5 ft. lbs. without damage to the structural member. The joints are the elements of the remote manipulator arm that allows its flexibility. The joints are six complex mechanisms manufactured on the modular concept. [Fig. #9] The modular build decreases cost per unit through interchangeability. design time, repair cost, and manufacturing and scheduling considerations. All joints are back-driveable to assist in dynamic braking. When the end effector snares the payload grapple fixture [Fig. 1(63. the joint brakes are released and low current is applied to the drive motors. This prevents large undesirable oscillations as the arm is a relatively slender member acted upon by free-flying high-inertia payloads. Data from the motor module is updated in the GPC every 42 milliseconds by a serial digital bus. The elbow joint axis is offset. .152*4 m. [6 in.) to provide the elbow joint with 160° of pitch. Maximum developed torque is specified by the high speed gear ratio, maximum speed is limited by the electrical flow to the motor. The joint motor module [Fig. #10) is a three phase, brushless optically commutated direct current motor capable of 100 oz. in. stall torque and a no load speed of 060 RPM. An induction synchronous tachometer measures the rate of joint rotation from pulses generated by the commutator disk. This data is modified by the commutator electronics and tachometer signal conditioning unit CSCLI) then transmitted to the GPC for analysis and display on the operator control panel. Joint braking is applied on the output shaft of the motor module [Fig. #10). The joint structure is manufactured from strong yet light weight materials. Titanium TÍ6AI-4. and aluminum alloys 7075-T735I and 7050-T6. The joint structure provides the interface between the booms. •Kumar. P. and Others. Systems Design Features of the Space Shuttle Remote Manipulator. 7.1257</page><page sequence="10">Fig. #9 Joint Configuration^* Fig. IMG Motor Module Configuration^)* The motor on each joint drives a compound epicyclic gear train [Fig. ÍM 13 that is identical in all joints, which in turn drives a high speed set of planetary spur gears different for each joint. The output of the gear train has been reduced at this stage to the required rotational speed of the joints [from O.OM rad/sec to .003 rad/sec - Table 03). On the output of the gear a 16K BIT resolution position encoder [Fig. 09) provides precise information for the joint angle position. The joint servo control system controls the input/output signals of the joint. The control system is comprised of the servo power amplifier [SPA) and two joint power conditioning units CJPC) located in the electronic compartment of each joint. The SPA produces a drive signal to the motor that is proportional to the demanded speed. The signal is attenuated by the tachometer feedback. The motor power amp. uses the pulse width from the commutator to determine the average voltage input requirement to each motor. The JPC units convert the orbiters +28V.D.C. power supply to regulated voltages for the electronics of each joint. CONCLUSIONS The RMS has proven it is capable of performing to the level required, although as user needs and experience develop, so will the system. Incertain arm configurations one DOF is lost when two joint axes are in line. Presently the operator has full responsibility to prevent arm collisions. The RMS will continue to thrive and grow as the communication and observation of the planet's activities increase. RECOMMENDATIONS Force feedback and force sensing of the manipulator arm will enhance the operator's manipulative abilities by producing a sense of "feel" for the payload. Proximity sensing would allow the system to capture payloads automatically. A collision avoidance system would reduce the possibility of mission failure. Variations of the manipulators functional abilities and parameters would increase its versatility and usefulness for future task requirements.

APPENDIX A To: Analysis of the Shuttle Remote Manipulator Arm Technical Report Programming Technique and Numerical Methods^ ^ The philosophy used in developing ASAD is to avoid unnecessary machine computations wherever possible, to provide flexibility to modify the system with ease and to provide a rather low-cost-yet reliable simulation. To achieve this goal, the following techniques are used: [i] Analytical expressions are written in a recursive form wherever possible. [ii] Multiplications of a string of matrices and vectors are performed with the least number of operations by selecting the proper order of multiplications. *Hinde, C.M.. ASAP - A Non Real Time Simulation Program for RMS Dynamics, Pg 2. [iii] Multiplications of a matrix by a vector with on non-zero element are done simply by multiplying the non-zero element by the appropriate elements in the matrix. [iv] Unless the matrix multiplications are too involved, the matrix expansion is done by hand before coding. [v] A number of flags are provided which can be accessed by input data cards. Cvi] Any system degree-of-freedom can be suppressed by inputting a proper data card. The suppressed degree-of-freedom is deleted from the state vector and from the system equation. Basically, the system equations can be written in the form A X + K X - Us + Uf - u [I] J&lt;£ -T [2] where A - inertia matrix of the Orbiter/Arm/Payload; JK - linear stiffness matrix of the arm. The non-linear portion of the arm stiffness is lumped into the right-hand side of equation CI]; &gt;&lt; - angular displacements of the Orbiter, and the arm rigid and flexible degrees-of-freedom; u - torques on the Orbiter/Arm/Payload including motor torques, non-linear inertial torques, energy dissipation torques, ACS control torques. The subscripts f and s denote the fast and slowly varying components of U respectively; J_ - inertia matrix of the motors [about their axes]; $ - motor shaft angles; T^ - motor torques, seen at the motor side. Due to the amount of computation involved and to the slow variations of and with time, they are considered quasi-static and are updated in a selected time period. 7.1260</page><page sequence="13">861795 APPENDIX B To: Analysis of the Shuttle Remote Manipulator Arm Technical Report Example of typical release velocities for different mass payloads.
