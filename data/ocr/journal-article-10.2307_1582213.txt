<plain_text><page sequence="1">NOTES ON GNOSIS BY ROBERT M. GRANT 1. MARCION AND THE OLD TESTAMENT It is a well known fact that in his Antitheses Marcion delivered a vigorous attack on the character of the God of the Old Testament, the creator of this world. This attack involved a good deal of searching the scriptures, as we learn from Tertullian, Adversus Marcionem 2, 21-24, Origen, De principiis 4, 2, 1 (p. 307 Koetschau), and Clementine homilies 2, 43-44 (pp. 52-52 Rehm).1 The lengthy Clementine list may be an expansion made by later Marcionites, though it is impossible to reach certainty in the matter. Most of the texts cited or alluded to are concerned with the activities and attitudes of Yahweh, as might be expected in view of Yahweh's more anthropomorphic character as compared with Elohim. These are the texts usually criticized by ancient critics of the Old Testament and defended by such allegorizers as Philo. Thus the anger, jealousy, and inconstancy of Yahweh were denied by Philo, especially in his treatise Quod Deus sit immutabilis; Philo argued that Yahweh's regret for having made man was allegorical;2 he proved that Yahweh was not ignorant by treating the questions "Where are you, Adam?" and "Where is your brother?" (Gen. 3, 9; 4, 9) as calls to repentance ;3 and he explained away such problems as Lot's relation to his daughters, and the plundering of the Egyp- tians, seemingly approved by God.4 These instances show that the questions raised by Marcion were 1 Cf.

GRANT not new. What was new was the intensity with which Marcion raised them, and his absolute refusal to admit the possibility of allegorical exegesis as a way out.5 Along with this attack on Yahweh's character there is an incon- sistent theological doctrine which later Marcionites seem to have abandoned. This doctrine is to the effect that the unknown supreme God is good, while the creator is just (dikaios). It is difficult to see how Marcion can have maintained this doctrine, in view of his criticisms of the Old Testament, but it is a fact that he did so. Where did he get it? The answer to this question is probably to be found in the Judaism to which Marcion was so hostile. According to Philo, God's name theos (Elohim) refers to his creative power and to his goodness, while kyrios (Yahweh) refers to his royal power and to his punitive actions.6 As Marmorstein has shown, this teaching corresponds to the older haggadic doctrine that the name Yahweh is used of the judgeship or rulership of God, while Elohim refers to his love and mercy.7 Here, then, we find the source of the distinction which Marcion made. And it is significant that, as Marmorstein also notes, later rabbinic teaching reversed this analysis. Yahweh was the name indicating God's love and mercy (cf. Exodus 34, 6), while Elohim referred to judgment.8 The change apparently took place in the age of R. Meir, in other words, in the time of Marcion. It has sometimes been observed that in Marcion's mythology should we call it haggada ? - there is a singular story which resembles Cainite teaching. This is the story of the Savior's descent into the underworld, where Cain and other Old Testament sinners gladly heard him while Abraham and other saints thought that God was as usual testing them.9 The Cainites too held that Cain and other Old Testament sinners were redeemed, but they took the further step of arguing that they were really saints. They were saints because they were opposed to Yahweh, the creator of the world. 5 Origen, In Matt. Comm. 15, 3, p. 356, 28 Klostermann; Harnack, op. cit., 260*. 6 H. A.

Once more we find ourselves in the realm of haggadic exegesis, for in Exodus 34, 5-6 we read of Yahweh's "descent" to Sinai-a picture philosophically disreputable-and then of his saying "Yahweh, Yahweh, El rachum." But rachum sounds like rechem, "womb." Therefore, the Cainites would triumphantly conclude, Yahweh himself calls him- self "womb." And he does not call himself "merciful and loving" - as rabbinic teachers were beginning to argue. From this analysis we should conclude that the Cainites were probably later in date than Marcion, and that they represent a gnostic counterattack on those rabbis who were themselves opposed to Marcion. This conclusion is to some extent supported by the fact that Cainite teaching was unknown to Justin, while it is reported in Irenaeus' discussion of heresies. The main point with which we are concerned, however, is the influence of rabbinic haggadism on gnostic teaching. 2. PTOLEMAEUS TO FLORA Who was Flora? In his edition of this letter (Paris, 1949), Quispel has suggested that Epiphanius left out the address and thus deprived us of interesting information about her. An alternative suggestion may be in order. In his important study of the Romzan Oration of Aelius Aristides," J. H. Oliver has drawn attention to a statement by Johannes Lydus (De mensibus 4, 73, p. 125, 3-9 Wiinsch). Lydus tells us that Rome had three names, ritual (Amor), hieratic (Flora), and political (Roma). In his oration Aristides himself refers to the hieratic name when he says that "the whole earth is adorned like a park." 12 It seems possible that Ptolemaeus may then be making a similar allusion when he refers to Flora as "like beautiful and good earth" (7, 10). Such an allusion would be especially appropriate if he were addressing his appeal to the Christian church of Rome. The situation of "Flora", a Christian waiting to be saved from ordinary orthodoxy, Marcionite doctrine, and more dualistic doctrine, would 10 Ibid., 1, 31, 1, p. 242. 11 The Ruling Power (Transactions of the American Philological Society, N.

GRANT thus correspond to that of the Roman church in Justin's time, when the apologist refers to Marcionites, Valentinians, Basilidians, and Saturnilians.l3 For the idea of addressing a church as a woman we may compare the Second Epistle of John, where a church is addressed as the "elect lady." 3. THE NAME IALDABAOTH This mysterious name of the creator god, found in several gnostic systems, has given rise to a good deal of modern speculation. Salmon favored a derivation from yalda bahoth, "son of chaos" ;14 Ganschi- nietz rejects this explanation and says the meaning is "nicht klar" ;15 Ginzberg suggested yalda b'osh, "progenitor of shame." 16 The Old Testament uses the root yalad both of God (Deut. 32, 18) and of idols (Jer. 2, 27). But the expression baoth might mean "in respect to a sign" such as the luminaries of Genesis 1, 14. Such conjectures do not seem to lead to any very convincing results, and it may be more satisfactory to consider the context in which we first encounter Ialdabaoth's name. We meet it in the Apocryphon of John,17 in Irenaeus,18 and in Origen (not in Celsus),19 where the seven planetary angels are being listed. Both Irenaeus and Origen regard most of the names as derived from the Old Testament, though Origen says that Ialdabaoth and two others come from magic. It is quite true that the name is found in magical texts, but this fact does not prove that it is not ultimately derived from the Old Testament. Ganschinietz gives two examples which may give us a clue, for the name occurs as Ialdaza5 and as Aldazao; else- where in magical texts we encounter Iaol, Iael, I5l1, and Iouel, not to mention Iao El and Iao Sabaoth.20 13 Dial. 35, 6. 14 W.

Nilsson, Bulletin de la soc. royale des lettres de Lund 1947-48, II, 62-64. 148</page><page sequence="5">NOTES ON GNOSIS It seems to me that Ialdabaoth is derived from Yahweh Elohe Zebaoth, "Yahweh God of hosts (armies)", found in 2 Samuel, Amos, 1 Kings, Jeremiah, and Psalm 89, 9. The name is thus Ia-el-zebaoth. For the development from "z" (tsade) to "d" parallels can be found in Aramaic, where both teth and daleth are sometimes substituted for tsade. So while the Septuagint sometimes renders tsebaoth as Sabaoth, it could also be transliterated as Debaoth. 4. THE ODES OF SOLOMON AND THE GOSPEL OF TRUTH In 1909, when Rendel Harris published his editio princeps of the Odes of Solomon, he was much impressed by the mysteriousness of Ode 23, which describes the reception of a letter from heaven. As he said (p. 121), ,,some book may have been published, claiming Divine Authority.... It appeared suddenly, unexpectedly, and met with opposition rather than universal acceptance .... (It) conveyed a message to those below from one above, and it interpreted the region below to include the invisible world .... It contained some pro- nounced statement concerning the Trinity, for we are expressly told that it had the name of Father, Son, and Holy Ghost upon it." Since other features of the Odes correspond fairly closely with Valentinian doctrine,21 we shall be inclined to look for this mysteri- ous book among the Valentinians. And a striking resemblance is found at once. The Ode begins with these words: Joy is of the saints, and who shall put it on but they alone? Grace is of the elect, and who shall receive it but those who trust in it from the beginning? Love is of the elect, and who shall put it on but those who have possessed it from the beginning? Walk in the knowledge of the Most High .... When we turn to the Gospel of Truth, we find that it begins as follows: The Gospel of Truth is joy for those who have received the grace of knowing from the Father of Truth him who through the power of the Word is come forth from the Pleroma .... (p. 16, 31) 21 E. Preuschen ap. H. Gunkel-H. Gressmann, ZNW 11 (1910), 328; W. R. Newbold in JBL 30 (1911), 161-204 (what Newbold refers to Bardaisan suits the early Valentinus just as well); W. Stolten in ZNW 13 (1912), 29-58 (the best parallels are Valentinian). 149</page><page sequence="6">ROBERT 1. GRANT And then when we read in verse 16 of the Ode that "the Son of Truth is from the Most High Father", and in verse 20 that "the name of the Father was on it, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost, to rule for ever and ever," we think at once of the discussion of the Son as the Father's Name in the Gospel (pp. 38-40), and of the description of Truth as the Father's Mouth and of the Spirit as the Father's Tongue (p. 26, 34-36). Another important parallel occurs in Ode 38, where we read how Truth became a haven of salvation to the writer; it went with him and brought him to rest (3-4). Error fled away from it and met it not, but the Truth proceeds in the right way. Whatever I did not know, it showed me, all the poisons of Error and the plagues which pass for the fear of death and the destroyer of destruction. I saw how the corrupted bride is adorned, and the bridegroom who corrupts and is corrupted. I asked the Truth, "Who are these ?" And he said to me, "This is the deceiver and the Error, And they are alike in the beloved and his bride, But they lead the world astray and corrupt it, And give them to drink of the wine of their intoxication .... (7-13). Later on, salvation is described as the laying of a foundation, planting a root, and causing it to spring up and bring forth fruit. This too is the doctrine of the Gospel of Truth, where Error (plane) is the foe of mankind; it works over matter in the Void (p. 17, 15) and made a "formation" in imitation of the Truth (p. 17, 19). It is thus the equivalent of the Demiurge, which as Malinine, Puech, and Quispel note 22 is absent from the Gospel. Error "annihilated" Jesus (p. 18, 24), but he showed men the right path, "and that path is the Truth which he taught them" (p. 18, 20). They find their true root, which is his root (p. 41, 17, 26; 42, 33-35); and from other Valentinian documents we know that they bring forth fruit.23 These examples, to which many more could be added, suggest that the Odes later entitled the Odes of Solomon (nothing in them has any 23 E. g. the end of Ptolemaeus' Letter to Flora (7, 10). 150</page><page sequence="7">NOTES ON GNOSIS reference to Solomon) are actually Valentinian and come from the same stage of the school as that represented by the Gospel of Truth.24 5. HYPPOLYTUS AND THE PSALMS OF VALENTINUS From Hippolytus (Ref. 6, 37, 7) we possess a quotation from a psalm of Valentinus, along with exegesis of it which is perhaps from Ptolemaeus. The psalm has been carefully interpreted by Festugiere in this journal (Vol. 3, 1949, pp. 205-7), and we should subscribe to his interpretation except that we should prefer to regard theros, "harvest", as the title of the psalm. The last two lines are especially interesting. "In spirit I see.... fruits rising from the abyss, the child (brephos) rising from the womb." It is not possible that Hippolytus gives us more of this psalm at another point? In Ref. 6, 42, 2 Hippolytus says, "Valentinus says he saw a new-born child and asked it who it might be; it replied that it was the Logos." Could not this information be based upon what we might expect to find in the rest of the psalm? "In spirit I see Fruits rising from the abyss, The child rising from the womb. I asked the child who it might be; It answered, 'I am the Logos'." For the question-and-answer form we could compare the 38th Ode of Solomon, quoted in section 4 above. Hippolytus' notion that the Valentinian system arose out of this vision is presumably not correct; according to Clement, Strom. 7, 106, 4, Valentinus possessed the true meaning of Jesus' teaching from a certain Theodas, a companion of Paul; and on the other side the Gospel of Truth is not a revelation given by a child-Logos. University of Chicago 24 The parallels in the Qumran Psalms of Thanksgiving deserve attention. 151</page></plain_text>
