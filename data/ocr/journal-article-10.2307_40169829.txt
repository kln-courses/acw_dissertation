<plain_text><page sequence="1">From Montezuma to San Francisco: The Wiigita Ritual in Papajjo (Tohono O^odham) Religion Jacques Galinier Translation by Adelaide Bahr and Donald Bahr Once a year, the silence that envelops the immensity of the desert is pierced by rising songs and cries. They announce the celebration of the wiigita,1 an intimate experience in which Papago2 Indians meticulously repeat the very gestures taught them by their ancestors. What reunites Indian families in this remote place in Sonora, Mexico, far from the indelicate glances of those who do not share their world view, is nothing less than a careful celebration of the death of the neibig, the monster of the Quitovac lagoon. The aim is not negligi- ble. It is to assure well being and prosperity for all, to enhance hunt- ing, and to end bodily sufferings. Paradoxically, this important ritual remains clouded in mystery. Its enigmatic character, according to Fontana (1987:259), stems from many causes. It is not mentioned in colonial sources, which is not entirely surprising in light of the exceptionally inhospitable character of this section of the Altar Desert. Not even an ephemeral trace permits one to postulate a historical depth greater than that attested by the Papago calendar stick with entries that go back only 1. To assist readers in pronunciation, wiigita, the phonological spelling of the name of the ritual, will be used throughout instead of the more familiar vikita as used by Davis, Fontana, Hayden, and others. 2. Tohono O'odham (Desert People) is the official designation for members of the tribe in the United States, as well as the term of self-reference. The word Papago, used in this text, is still common in Mexico and is the traditional term of reference in anthropological literature. Jacques Galinier is professor of anthropology at the Universite de Paris X, Nanterre and a member of the French Anthropological Mission to Mexico. He has published extensively on the Otomi of central Mexico, most recently a book on Otomi body imagery and cosmology, La Mitad del Mundo (UniversidadAutdnoma de Mexico, 1990). In the late 1980s, he began research with the Papago of Sonora. This article is the first of Galinier^ writings to be translated into English.</page><page sequence="2">Wi:aita Ritual * 487 to the mid-nineteenth century (Fontana 1987:260). Furthermore, non-Papago eyewitnesses of the wirgita are, as mentioned by Fon- tana, very few. Among the sources, it is useful to separate those who, like Lumholtz and McGee, relied on informants and whose interest was not specifically Papago religion, and those like Davis ( 1920) and Hayden (1987; illustrations by Isabelle Pendleton), who describe the 1936 and 1945 wi:gitas as a result of direct observation. Hayden's publication in 1987 under the auspices of the Journal of the Southwest is of inestimable worth. Photographic documents of the wi:gita are very few. For Gu Achi, Arizona, one of the two villages in which the ritual was practiced, the pictures attributed to Rosamond Norman taken in 1921 are the most spectacular (Griffith 1983:770). In the case of Quitovac, So- nora, the other place of celebration, only J. Menager's pictures of 1920 are available (Davis 1920). Scenes of the preparations were photographed by Romos Navarro and a text was written by Gonza- lez, who witnessed the ceremony in 1981 under the sponsorship of the Instituto Nacional Indigenista (1981:10-12). Cano Avila like- wise wrote a brief description of the Quitovac ritual of 1978 (1979: 138-44). The present article describes a wi:gita that I observed in July 1986 in the company of the archaeologists F. Rodriguez and N. Silva, members of the Sonora Interdisciplinary Project of the Centre d'Etudes Mexicaines et Centramericaines (Mexico). The participa- tion of two archaeologists and an ethnologist permitted an exchange of knowledge and points of view that aided me in the writing of this text. The choice of Quitovac as the focus of multidisciplinary research has been discussed in the progress report of the Sonora Project (Ro- driguez and Silva 1985). Isolated in the midst of arid Sonora, Quitovac appears exception- ally privileged by nature. It is, in the felicitous expression of Nabhan, a true "oasis in the desert," a microenvironment assembled around an artesian spring ringed by abundant vegetation, sheltering more than sixty-five species of birds (Nabhan 1982:96). In truth, this place, favorable to humans, has only one equivalent in the region, Quitobaquito, on the other side of the international boundary, a watery place with exuberant vegetation that enchanted Lumholtz in 1910. With San Francisquito village and the annual pilgrimage to its patron saint, Quitovac constitutes one of two great "sanctuaries" in the western part of the Altar Desert. The ritual of the wi:gita that</page><page sequence="3">488 * Journal of the Southwest drawn hy Don Bufkin</page><page sequence="4">Wugita Ritual * 489 will be discussed here no longer has an equivalent in other Papago communities. It is the last expression of a custom that has now disap- peared from Gu Achi village, from which, fortunately, descriptions remain. My observation of this wi:gita was made possible by the support of several organizations: local and border authorities, the Instituto Nacional de Antropologia e Historia, Instituto Nacional Indigenista, and in addition the population of Quitovac provided unreserved cooperation. Nonetheless, it is necessary to point out the particular conditions under which the wi:gita was performed. As will be shown later, the celebration of this ritual is entirely under the authority of Papagos who reside on American soil on theTohono Obdham Reser- vation near Sells, Arizona. The leaders of the wiigita consented with good will to our request to attend the ritual, but they qualified their consent with certain restrictions. We could not be present at night, take any pictures or notes during the wi:gita, and we had to stay at the edge of the ceremonial area. These conditions were also imposed upon the inhabitants of Quitovac. Such limitations, frustrating to the ethnologist, nevertheless in- spire a feeling of respect. That is to say, the wi:gita is one of the last authentic forms of ritual expression among the traditional cultures of the Sonoran Desert. Now at the end of the twentieth century it seems only right that the Papagos, like other Southwestern Indian groups, should elaborate strategies of resistance to an anthropology that is often invasive and unresponsive to Indian aspirations. The struggle is not without legitimate basis, and it has a considerable history. One can hope that from now on Papagos will write their own ethnographies, alone or in cooperation with specialists from another culture, as they have already begun doing; note examples in the work of Bahr, Gregorio, Lopez, and Alvarez (1974). Fbr the present article, it has seemed useful to first sketch the Quitovac ritual, then to present reflections that derive from interviews conducted be- fore and after the performance with Papagos and Mexicans in Quito- vac and in other Papago villages. The fieldwork took place in Sep- tember and October of 1985 with N. Silva, in July and August of 1986 with E Rodriguez and N. Silva, and in April 1987, February 1988, and February 1989, alone. Information was collected from men and women whose lives have been affected by the ritual and who wished to speak freely about it and its origins. The present work, therefore, is a preliminary construction of native recollections</page><page sequence="5">490 * Journal of the Southwest of this version. What remains unknown to me are the ritual texts of this Quitovac wiigita. It is hoped that some day they may be known, if this is the wish of those whose task it is to transmit them to future generations. This article will not study the wiigita as a closed universe of en- tirely internal meaning. Rather, the wiigita will be related to a variety of beliefs and rituals that, like it, have survived the influence of the Mexican and American cultures. First, and of great methodological interest, the wiigita is explained by a fascinating myth that mirrors it and affords us an opportunity for decipherment. Next, a preliminary, brief discussion reveals symbolic connections between the wiigita and a seemingly unrelated ritual concerning mule deer. Finally, this paper will demonstrate a Papago pantheon that is dominated by two deities, Montezuma and San Francisco. The wiigita is therefore at the meeting place between the mythology, the religious beliefs, and the ritual practices of the Papagos. Let me repeat that there are still many obscure points that can only be illuminated by more systematic investigation, and that the present work is preliminary. THE MONSTER AND THE HERO At the beginning of the wiigita was the myth. Like other societies in the region, especially the Pueblos, the ritual that will be discussed is justified by an origin myth. The wiigita text has the advantage of being known by all. It is not the specialized property of a shaman or the memory of an isolated old man. Furthermore, it presents indi- vidual variations which are useful in understanding the native meth- ods of interpretation. Thus, we approach the ritual by presenting two versions of the myth that were collected in Spanish in Quitovac. They will serve as background to the narrative and the interpretation of the ritual. The first version is as follows. Formerly the sea covered all the region of Quitovac. In the middle of the water was a dragon. He killed the Indians one after another. To escape him, people ran away to the mountains. The people of Quitovac decided to appeal to a man who lived in the Pinacate Mountains. This man let himself be swallowed by the monster. He entered his body, which was the size of a</page><page sequence="6">Wt:gita Ritual * 491 house. The victims that had been swallowed stood upright in- side. The monster had four hearts. Montezuma pierced them one after the other with a knife of ironwood. Inside one of the hearts he found a human figurine. When the hero decided to be swallowed by the monster, he said that a cloud coming out from the mouth of the beast would indicate that he was alive and well. When the cloud came out, the people knew that the hero was safe and the monster was dead. A voice then asked that every year a feast in honor of Montezuma should take place in Quitovac to celebrate this happening. The above text is the current standard version of the origin of the wiigita. It refers to a cosmology that has existed since the eighteenth century, as attested by Velarde. This missionary knew the Jesuit Manje, who accompanied Kino throughout the Pimeria and stopped at Quitovac. In the tenth chapter of the Luz de Tierra Incognita, he wrote of Pima beliefs: 'Their religion is none. They neither know God, the universal cause, nor do they think or talk of other than the material and present." Later, he says, cThey have, however, some notion of the deluge, and they tell how their ancestors were freed, and also how they know and remember Jitoy who, they say, with two other families, freed himself of the deluge and [freed] them after other calamities" (Manje 1985:131-32). This reference should be attributed to Velarde and not to Manje, as it already appears in the former's Primera Relation (Gonzalez 1977:56). The interesting point is that the account was implicitly accepted by Manje. Neither of the two authors indicates the origins of these beliefs, and there is no mention of the heroic combat with the monster of Quitovac, which, according to local traditions, took place after the deluge when the local region was again covered by water. Nevertheless, Velarde lets us note the extent of the magical ability of Jitoy (Fitoi, Montezuma) and his role in founding the world. A second version of the origin myth that I collected in 1989 at Quitovac states: One day the world began to be covered with water. The water rose little by little, and the Indians fled to the mountains. At Quitovac the water reached the middle of the village. For this reason the low part of the village is the "black half," and the high part is the "foam half." The Indians decided to escape</page><page sequence="7">492 * Journal of the Southwest towards the Pinacate Mountains. With the group was a Yaqui who said that he would go to notify the other Indians. A Papago man decided to throw himself inside the monster that swallowed the people. He said that if they saw a red cloud, it would mean that he was alive. A black cloud would mean the opposite. He threw himself inside the monster and killed its five "spirits." The water began to recede. At a moment before it had completely receded, the Indians saw a wood rat (kosuri) who was going through a tunnel towards the water; then he brought the water back behind him. Concerning the origin stories above, other native texts give impor- tant supplementary details (the cloud is said to be white according to Davis). This version also convincingly explains why the name "Foam Hill" is applied to a mountain near Quitovac. The notion of foam is also found in songs celebrating this place. Underhill men- tions foam in reference to the Quitovac wi:gita. Yonder stands Foam Mountain, Elder Brother, With foam on its head, Elder Brother; Distant it stands, Elder Brother, With foam on its head, Elder Brother. (Underhill 1969:158) Another point, particularly remarkable, is that the function of transporting water is attributed to the kosun, a wood rat. One notes the causal relationship between the death of the dragon or monster (nr.big in Pima-Papago) and the end of the flood, as if the monster stood for the watery element. This is supported by the Davis version of the Quitovac myth: ccThe monster thrashed and threw his great body around until, in his dying agony, he had splashed all the water out of the pool, since which time there has been no water in that place" (1920:161). An important detail emerges from Davis's version. The monster had a blocked anus (1920:160). This singular reference is consistent with the idea of the monster's innards as the ultimate residence of the dead, almost as if he held a village inside him. A belief persists in Qui- tovac that a monster still resides in a mountain within the Pinacate range, a spectacular volcanic zone to the northwest of the village. It is said that this monster could come to the surface during new volcanic activity, and threaten the inhabitants. That is why the informants add that the purpose of the wi:gita is to avoid the return of the monster.</page><page sequence="8">Wiyita Ritual * 493 Whether presented as the master of Baboquivari Mountain (as in Underhill \969b: 135) or of the Pinacates (in Quitovac mythologies), whether he is Montezuma or Fitoi or both, the hero maintains a privileged relationship with the inside of the earth and with tribal ancestors. According to a Sonoyta informant, in the Pinacate moun- tains there was a passage that allowed "Sand Papagos" to reach the lower layers of the earth with the aid of pegs planted in the wall; thus these ancestors could go to and from the underworld. Such a belief calls to mind the better known Papago narrative of the resurrection of Fitoi, "Elder Brother," and his journey into the underworld, where he found the tribal ancestors together with Earth Shaman (Bahr 1975:32). Underhill gives an important detail concerning the mythic origin of the wi:gita. During his wanderings in Papago country, Fitoi planted sticks decorated with turkey feathers around two chosen sites: "Archie" (Gu Achi) and Quitovac. The majority of Papagos went to the former, where they celebrated a quadrennial ritual. A minority went to Quitovac, where Fitoi ordered that they would gather once a year (Underhill 1969^:135). We now return to the origin myth of the wi:gita. Inside one of the four (or seven) hearts of the monster, Montezuma found a "dia- mond" which he gave to the Papagos. Local informants mention, with more or less detail, the existence of a pair of male and female objects. Thus, Davis's version states that Montezuma divided the single heart of the monster into halves which he gave to the people. According to Davis, at the time of his visit to Quitovac the male half had long disappeared (1920:162). There are contradictory state- ments as to the nature and disposition of the remaining half. Accord- ing to some, it was either an anthropomorphic stone or one with a hand etched on it, but it is more commonly said to be a frog. All agree, however, that this stone, elevated to the rank of santito or, more frequently, santa or virgin, was an object of fear and had to be hidden from view. Whoever dared look at it risked death. This belief may be compared to another version of the flood, which refers to the Cerro del Muslo as the sanctuary of the tribal ancestors who fled the flood. At the top of this hill the men found a rabbit and chased it. They dug a hole where it entered the ground, and a great number of rabbits came out. At this very spot, they say, there is a stone incised with frog designs. The sacred stone of Quitovac was kept in a pet oca, or, as its Papago name wasa indicates, a plaited cane basket lined with eagle down. It</page><page sequence="9">494 * Journal of the Southwest was kept in the Cave of the Petaca located close to the Hill of Quito- vac. In the same cave were placed white, red, black, and yellow silk ribbons, and all the paraphernalia of the wi:gita. At the time of the celebration, the basket was taken from the cave and carried by a man on his head to the ceremonial house (&amp;;, "house"). From there a woman was delegated to bring it to the shelter (watto, "shelter, shade, ramada") of the musicians. During this journey, she could neither touch the stone with her hands nor say a word. Finally, in the after- noon, she made the return journey, from the shelter to a small cere- monial building called queso^ which has since disappeared. This task has been performed for many years by the same woman. The man who fetched the basket from the cave had to bring it back unaccompanied. During the 1940s the basket was stolen, apparently by a Quitovac Mexican who took it to Sonoyta. Today the costumes and accessories are kept in trunks in a house at Quitovac. But if one believes Gon- zalez, in 1981 the actors still went on the first day of the wiigita to the Hill of the Petaca, where the masks and instruments were hidden in a cave, and returned them to the same place at the end of the ritual (1981:10-11). Until its disappearance, this basket was a link be- tween Montezuma and humanity, the tangible proof of his power, particularly through the mediation of the santa. In spite of its ab- sence, the memory of the object adheres to the wiigita and gives it authority, ultimately, one may say, because of the origin myth. THE RITUAL SPACE The wiigita has as its backdrop the village of Quitovac, situated forty kilometers from the international boundary that separates the states of Arizona and Sonora. Quitovac encompasses a territory of 19,000 hectares. Its population fluctuates at fewer than two hundred people (the last census counted only ten female and twenty-five male heads of households). Since 1974 the village has had the status of "In- digenous Community," but in fact its population of Papago speakers is fewer than five individuals. The rest of the inhabitants are mestizos who have come to live in the village since the time of its recognition as an indigenous community. In 1974, when only one mestizo family lived there, Quitovac had a rebirth in which the actual local popula- tion was mestizo and the "true" Papagos came from the outside. Before 1950, as shown on a map from the time, the village houses</page><page sequence="10">Wi:£fita Ritual * 495 Reconstructed Wi:gita ceremonial house (kesu), Quitovac, Sonora. Drawing by Jean-Marc Chavy. were built along a T-shaped axis conforming to a road, now aban- doned, from Quitovac to Sonoyta. Another group of houses was close to a spring and the ceremonial house (kesu) of the wi:gita. The present distribution of houses is semidispersed, with large unoccu- pied spaces. Now there are twenty, while at the time of Davis's visit, around 1920, there were twenty to thirty houses. The different types of present-day houses show multiple adaptations to the desert. They are all rectangular, but of different sizes and floor plans. The tradi- tional houses of adobe bricks have communicating rooms. Some of them have walls of ocotillo with saguaro-rib stringers. The wooden roofs, of single or double pitch, are covered with stones. Today more durable constructions of cement brick outnumber the traditional adobes, especially public buildings such as the boarding school, in- stalled by the Instituto Nacional Indigenista for the Indian children of Sonora. The most remarkable holdovers from traditional architecture are the ramadas placed in front of houses and covered with grease- wood branches. Sometimes they are separate structures sheltering the hearth, for Papagos are accustomed to cooking outside. The ramada is also used for sleeping. Its space is generally dominated by a broken refrigerator, the symbol of a new Indian aesthetic of consumption. Beside the domestic ramadas there is a communal structure under which, formerly, important public decisions were made. Now tat- tered, this ramada stands in front of a recently built community- government house. There are also sacred ramadas. In Quitovac such</page><page sequence="11">496 * Journal of the Southwest constructions are located near the "Plain of the Kuku." This name designates the cry that accompanies the ceremony held there, ku'uh, that is locally explained as the origin of kuku. Underhill compares this cry to that of the Pueblo Kachinas (1969&amp;: 169). The area, about a kilometer west of the village, and approximately eighty meters by sixty in size, is set apart for the annual celebration of the wi:gita. Its space is defined by three ramadas, one to the west to shelter musi- cians, and two on the east which are reserved for companies of actors. These actors' ramadas are separated from each other by twelve me- ters, and positioned asymmetrically in relation to the ceremonial area. All three ramadas are constructed of ironwood or mesquite posts with roofs of mixed organ pipe-cactus ribs and greasewood branches. CHRONOLOGY OF THE WIlGITA Friday afternoon is marked by the arrival of the American Papagos at the ceremonial grounds. Some cars and trucks follow a direct dusty road that crosses a wash and leads to the ceremonial area. Others make a brief stop at the village to exchange greetings with relatives and acquaintances. The governor of the Papago tribe, who lives at Puerto Penasco, is courteously welcomed. The cars park on the pe- Ramada, Quitovac, Sonora. Drawing by Jean-Marc Chavay.</page><page sequence="12">Wi'.aita Ritual * 497 riphery of the ceremonial ground, forming a semicircle. This provi- sional encampment will stand for three days. The initial preparations begin. Two enclosures are built, one for the ceremonial group from Quitovac and one for the American Papa- gos. The latter group supervises the building of both structures. Each year the inhabitants of Quitovac offer their help, which is politely refused by the American organizers. The enclosures are temporary, and they are torn down after the ritual, while the three ramadas remain, although they have no extra-wi:gita functions and are aban- doned to the weather. During these preparations the village inhabi- tants place five mounds of earth in front of their homes, four at each point of a square, with one mound in the center upon which they arrange edible offerings, mostly flour cakes and drinks. At five in the evening on Saturday the costuming of the actors begins next to each ramada. The first group (seven individuals from Quitovac) goes first to the house of the sole Papago resident of Qui- tovac, who is the head of the local ceremonial group. The men then cross the village baseball ground to reach the house of the governor of the Papago tribe. When the group reaches the five earth mounds in front of his door, the leader pokes his spear in front of each mound. His assistant erects a stick decorated with eagle down above each. When this is done, a third man, who is masked, throws a handful of corn flour from a shell that he carries; then he shoots an arrow into each earth mound and utters a long lamenting cry. The act is repeated for each mound, terminating with the central one. Once finished, the group proceeds to the next house, where the same thing is en- acted. At six o'clock, the second group follows an identical circuit. This group wears the same costumes as the first. A little before seven in the evening, the two groups place them- selves about ten meters from their respective enclosures. Each group is now composed of eight men standing on either side of a cloth that is stretched between them and raised above the ground. On the cloth are placed the paraphernalia of the ritual. The groups advance slowly towards their enclosures and stop a few meters from them, waiting for the sun to set. Then the groups enter the enclosures and place their cloths on the ground. On them, jumbled together, are displayed many objects: sticks decorated with eagle down (these will be used to bless the actors), a "solar disk" of red cloth with eagle-feather rays, drinks and cornmeal offerings collected during visits to the houses of Quitovac, a rainbow of wood, a bow and arrow, and parts of cos-</page><page sequence="13">498 * Journal of the Southwest tumes for two actors - masks, belts, scarves, and necklaces. Some dozens of spectators face the two enclosures. In the first row are sick people, several of whom are paralyzed. The ritual inside the enclosure starts with the dressing of two actors. Facing each other above the cloth that lies on the ground, one of them begins to sing a musical theme without words. Stomping on the ground, the singer raises his arms alternately, brandishing a feathered stick in each hand. After a few minutes, he walks toward the center of the ceremonial ground, which is located behind and west of the enclosure, accom- panied by his assistant. There, eagle feathers are planted in a small mound of earth. The singer circles them counterclockwise, then re- turns to and enters the enclosure. Afterwards, the same operation is repeated by singers from the second group. When the singing of the two dressed actors resumes after an inter- mission, two spectators approach the paraphernalia, kneel, scratch the soil before them, and cover their faces and chests with dust. Then they address the ritual objects, kiss the earth, and stand up again. They raise their arms several times, pass their hands over their faces, and cover their faces with earth. By eight o'clock the inhabitants of Quitovac retire in silent accord. Only the American Papagos remain. No strangers are tolerated, including anthropologists. It is said that the nighfs activities repeat the curing activities of the dusk that have already been described. Songs intermittently accompany the blessing of the spectators all night long. Before sunrise, a blanket and a disk representing the sun are held out toward the east. The two groups, each with this pair of objects, go in turn onto the ceremonial ground. With outstretched arms the actors of the two parties raise the blanket holding the sun representa- tion. Then they return to their enclosures, where their leaders bless them. For this action, the two groups leave their enclosures at the same time, cross in the middle of the ceremonial ground, and return to their respective enclosures. The solar disk, hidden by the blanket, is uncovered little by little. It is then lightly covered once more before it is completely unveiled. This is said to reproduce an early morning phenomenon ccwhen the sun rises and then seems to set again." Songs issue from the enclosures throughout the morning. In the meantime, three musicians come and sit under the ramada reserved for them at the west end of the ceremonial ground. From time to time the two actor groups proceed towards the ceremonial ground</page><page sequence="14">Wi:aita Ritual * 499 in directions opposite from their points of departure. They do so repeatedly until afternoon. At two o'clock the kosun (wood rat) hunt begins. Two masked men emerge from each enclosure, dressed in modern clothes - pants and jackets. Holding bows and arrows, they place themselves before an earth mound in a corner of the ceremonial ground. Miming, they roll on the ground, gesticulate, and argue. According to the specta- tors, they are chasing an imaginary animal up to a spot marked by eagle feathers. After some more clowning they return, running to their respective enclosures. The two groups of actors/dancers then proceed again around the ceremonial ground, always following the same path. Shortly after three o'clock, another procession forms, led by a man whose head is encircled by a scarf and surmounted by feathers. He is hidden by a covering tied at his waist with a scarf. Two masked actors appear. One holds up a cloth panel that is deco- rated with a rainbow design and a raining cloud. A last masked character completes the procession. On his back hang flowering branches of ocotillo. After the procession reaches the center of the ceremonial ground, it returns to the enclosures. The wi:gita ends; the spectators begin to leave. It is four o'clock. PARAPHERNALIA AND SYMBOLS The wi:gita is difficult to interpret for many reasons, first of all because of the incompleteness of the above observations, and second due to conditions imposed upon the anthropologists by the Papagos. In 1981 Gonzalez was able to follow a wi:gita in its entirety and has written a brief description supported by short native commentaries (1981:10-12). His unpublished notes confirm my own information that the nighttime events repeat those of the preceding dusk and that, due to fatigue, there are periods of inactivity during the night. This is consistent with information gathered elsewhere (Bahr 1986: 177). Strangely, Gonzalez does not mention the episode celebrating the sunrise. Yet it is hard to believe that it could have been omitted that year. The important morning event that he mentions is the instal- lation of musicians under the ramada at the west end of the ceremo- nial ground. These differences will be discussed below. In the wi:gita ceremony of 1986, the groups in the enclosures were</page><page sequence="15">500 * Journal of the Southwest composed of seven people each; the individuals are distinguished by details of costume: • The ceremonial leader is an unmasked man in city clothes. He carries a spear on top of which are fixed two eagle feathers. The spear has the function of showing the way and guiding the steps of the actors. • The second actor is the sprinkler of corn flour. He wears a deerskin mask in the form of a cap with fringes that reach to the chest and openings for the eyes and mouth. Around his neck he wears a pearl necklace and two scarves, red and blue. His body is covered by a blanket that is tied at the waist. From the blanket hang small bells, tinklers, and shells. • The third actor, in city clothes, simply holds a bow and arrow. He is, they say, the nawicu, the "hunter." • The last four actors are unmasked assistants wearing city clothes. In the 1978 wi:gita, which was observed by Cano Avila, the corn- flour sprinkler was called kuku, from the Spanish name for the ritual. The sprinkler was used to make a line of corn flour on the earth. Only three dancers may follow that line. The sprinkler's gesture indi- cated a stop. The Quitovac wi:gita differs in many ways from that held at Gu Achi, including the number of actors and the ceremonial costumes. The illustrations of Pendleton and Hayden demonstrate the extreme simplicity of the costumes at Gu Achi (Hayden 1987). Unfortunately, native interpretations are no longer available there. In particular, the symbolism of the colors has been forgotten. An informant from Quitovac, however, says that the handkerchiefs must always be red or blue. The prayer sticks used during the therapeutic sequence are marked by black and white bands. One of them, pre- served by an elder, has red and white spirals. Today at Quitovac the character that attracts the greatest spectator attention, and the only one with a native name, is the pack rat hunter, the nawicu. His costume differs from that at Gu Achi in that he does not wear the headgear of eagle feathers and feather horns. The central portion of the mask, as well as the leather wristband and anklets, and the band of cloth falling down the back, are decorated with feathers. The body paintings have disappeared. Without doubt the sketches of Hayden and Pendleton correspond exactly to the pictures of Men- ager, probably taken at Gu Achi in 1920 (Fbntana 1983:138). A Pima told Hayden that a ceremony similar to the wi:gita existed among these Indian relatives of the Papagos at the turn of the century</page><page sequence="16">Wiiaita Ritual * 501 (Hayden 1987:323). Russell, who wrote an accurate ethnography of the Pimas, maintains that the origin of the nawicu is Sonoran, citing technical criteria such as the type of cottonwood-carving mask that he was able to examine. He considered the mask to have been carved by a member of the Yaqui tribe (Russell 1980: 109). His descriptions of the Papago wi:gita indicate the double nature of the nawicu (Nawitco) who is at the same time an "evil spirit" (he causes swelling of the knees and inflammation of the eyes) and a priest of the wi:gita with therapeutic powers who is able to attract rain. He is portrayed by a masked dancer and is assisted by characters called Kakspakam (Russell 1980:266). It is he who cures the spectators by wiping them with eagle feathers. Russell insists on the idea, also held by the Papa- gos of Quitovac, that objects touched by the nawicu can cause sick- ness. This shows that the energy surrounding this actor is doubly polarized. Chona, Underfill's informant, states that the ceremonial clowns (Nawitco) of her youth were endowed with therapeutic pow- ers, but she also implies that only effective shamans were given this role (Underhill 1985:82). Chesky confirms that the clowns (nana- wicu) at Gu Achi had shamanic powers for as long as they wore their costumes (1942:4). Mason states that the nanawicu of Gu Achi sym- bolized saguaros. On their heads they wore turkey feathers which were believed to represent the fruits of the plant. They held the long sticks that are used to harvest the fruits of the saguaro (1920:18). The Quitovac clowns might have done similarly, but we have no record of that. According to Hayden, the origin of the nawicu is probably Pueblo. The anthropologist argues for a cultural continuum among the Hopi, Zuni, Sobaipuri, and Papago - at least the Papagos of the Santa Rosa (Gu Achi) area. This actor's gestures certainly evoke Pueblo parallels. This is particularly true of the counterclockwise movements prac- ticed at Gu Achi and at Quitovac, and of the handling of the bow with the wrong hand (Chesky 1942:42). At Quitovac the brief ap- pearance of the nanawicu only hints at a complex choreography. One can say that both the formally programmed actions and the improvi- sations have been greatly reduced. Given the fleeting nature of their performance, one cannot say, as about theTanoans, that their actions are balanced around a notion of transgression or, according to the elliptical expression of Handelman, that "they are ambulatory man- ifestations of boundariness" (1987:548). Moral connotations that might have existed among the Hopis are barely discernible here.</page><page sequence="17">502 * Journal of the Southwest Everything suggests that the Quitovac wood rat-hunt episode has been divested of content to a point where only a few humorous elements remain. Moreover, the acts of the nanawicu are confined to the ceremonial ground and do not involve the participation of assis- tants. In the Gu Achi ritual, there are nocturnal performances of the clowns that are absent at Quitovac. For example, there is a sortie into mock fields where the clowns imitate horticultural workers (Mason 1920:21). Nothing suggests that at Quitovac there were burlesque activities other than the wood-rat hunt. This implies that the hunt itself is a form of cultural play with strong sexual connotations that persist in explicit or dissimulated form. Let us not forget in addition that the nawicu is a numen of fecundity. Russell says that the Papagos believe that the nawicu was responsible for the introduction of the gourd, a phallic symbol. Among the Pimas, women were warned that they should not touch gourds lest they anger the nanawicu (1980:175). THE TIMING OF THE RITUAL An important temporal aspect of the wi:gita is the role of the moon in setting the date of the ceremony. According to custom (but the local witnesses are sometimes inexact, the rite takes place on the third night following the new moon of July. This fixes the internal timing of the rite whose different parts or "grades" (grades in the local Spanish) pertain variously to curing, hunting, and rainmaking. External to the ceremony is still another factor in timing; it is said that the wi:gita should come a few weeks after a mule-deer ritual. The date of this ritual coincides with the beginning of the new year in the native calendar, marked by the darkening of the seeds of the saguaro fruit (Fontana 1981:37). Formerly, the families camping in the cactus forests, northwest of Quitovac, returned to their village for the deer ritual at the time of the disappearance of the moon (Jones 1971:16). This was the beginning of the month called "rain month." At that time, the governor (kmvinal, from Spanish goberna- dor) of Quitovac began each day by making a notch on a stick. The last two notches would be the days of the wi:gita ceremony. Once the first day had been marked, a similar stick was sent to the gover- nors of the Papagos at Caborca, Sonoyta, Represo Enrique, La Ango- stura, La Espuma, and San Francisquito. Jones also lists two more</page><page sequence="18">Wi.aita Ritual * 503 localities, La Lesna and Los Camotes, which have now lost their cere- monial ties with Quitovac. Each governor gathered the Indians in- volved in the wi:gita (the governor of La Angostura, called "Mena- ger's Dam" in English, invited the people of Pisinimo and Gu Vo). This custom of notching a stick to count days is similar to the practice noted by Jones for Gu Achi; in 1932 the ceremonial leaders made long sticks to signal the number of days remaining (1971:8). The native obsession with time in the wi:gita is evident in the repetitiveness of the ritual. Thus we understand the actors5 vows to participate during four consecutive years. The number "four" is very important in Piman symbolism and sense of direction. One finds this frequently in Southwestern mythology and rituals (Lamphere 1983:760). In the myth of Fitoi and the Ho'ok Oks, told by Ventura Jose, Elder Brother (Fitoi) orders people to sing during four days and four nights in order to be freed from the frightful Htfok Oks, "Witch" (Jose 1983: 117). Similarly, a young man vows to participate in the salt pilgrimage for four successive years (Underhill 1969^:213). Once he arrives at the ocean, he has to run four times around the salt beds (Underhill 1969^:234). Furthermore, as Saxton, Saxton, and Enos tell, a young man passed through four grades of initiation in attaining adulthood; the first was killing a small animal, the second was the salt pilgrimage, the third was a visionary meeting with an animal or bird, and the fourth was killing an enemy (1983: 122). The notion of grades is also important for the actors of the wi:gita. Unfor- tunately, it cannot be said that the salt pilgrimage still exists as a rite of passage, even though there are certain phases in today's salt pil- grimages corresponding to the ancient initiation rite. The quadren- nial repetition of the wi:gita at Gu Achi is a theoretical time schedule, because the 1919 wi:gita was six years later than the preceding one (Mason 1920:14). One can imagine an unknown procedure that would guarantee the continuation of the wi:gita in the hypothetical instance where all the actors fulfilled their avowed four years at once. The rule of the four years of service seems to be a cultural response to the need for con- tinuity in the ritual. The great burden of this task is obvious, and candidates sometimes renounce it. The supernatural sanctions gov- erning rightful performance must certainly frighten people. A pecul- iar sickness, the "wi:gita sickness" that can only be cured by native specialists is a consequence of these sanctions. Fear of this sickness supports an energetic interpretation of the ritual. The actors are in a</page><page sequence="19">504 * Journal of the Southwest field of force with determined entrance and exit points, similar to the beginning and end of the four-year cycle. The force is ambivalent, and only ritual manipulation can channel it. This belief is expressed in the therapeutic sequence in the enclosures as well as in the cure of "wiigita sickness." Moreover, it is possible that the coercive aspect of wi:gita partici- pation can be traced to the final request in the founding myth: "A voice then asked that each year a feast in honor of Montezuma would take place in Quitovac to celebrate the event." There are two pos- sibilities. One can consider the wiigita as the symbolic enactment of the fight against the monster of the lagoon, which would support a thesis both meteorological and sacrificial. Or one can consider the wiigita functionally, as distancing the present from a primordial chaos. In either case, the problem is to avoid the return of the mon- ster and to prevent a regression to a fragile society menaced by primi- tive genocide. Is it possible to associate each participant's four-year vow with the four hearts of the monster? Local explanations do not include an answer to this question. The knowledge of a founding myth in Quitovac convincingly sup- ports the idea of a votive constraint. In effect, we surmise that it is less a question of honoring the memory of the ancestors than of presenting a valid solution to the survival of humankind. In placing the origin of the wirgita within a warlike episode, the Papago explica- tion raises the idea of the wiigita as a combat against nefarious forces, first focused on the figure of the m:big, "sea monster," then against pathological influxes that add to the ills caused by the watery envi- ronment. In a way, it seems that the ritual death of the ncbig offi- cially seals an annual account. Not to observe the wi:gita would be in a sense to end the march of time. Now, an ordered world is that in which time is regulated, where the intervals between different "markers" are respected, and in which commemorative actions are subject to chronological constraints. These constraints are the same as those that govern a space which is oriented and crossed with fixed paths and changing positions. Therefore, time is not simply evoked, but is reproduced through procedures which, to be effective, require a high degree of ritualization. Another index of the wiigita's rootedness in the social frame of time is the discussion of the organizers that takes place at their tradi- tional meetings. During the night in the ceremonial house they com- mented on the rules of execution and the ordering of sequences. It</page><page sequence="20">Wiiaita Ritual «fr 505 seems that technical elaborations, more than symbolic explications, were problems for the governor and his assistants. Their principal concern was the calendar, in order to make the dating contingent on the moon (the thin sliver of light marking its appearance served as a reference for the counting). It must be explained, however, that these nocturnal reunions, concerned with the perfect execution of the wi:gita, were also occasions for discussing community affairs. The meetings occurred every month at full moon, and each time the date for the following one was fixed. It is not surprising that the wiigita functions as a measure of time, and that it initiates a phase of growth based on that of the moon. The ritual also marks a time of death by the "crepuscular" and noctur- nal character of its first phase, with a following phase of plant germi- nation. The fact that there is an obligation to celebrate the wiigita is illustrated by a report from the citizens of Quitovac in 1987 that states: We perform the ceremony of the wiigita in order to beseech the creator (Pitoi) for rain in the celebration. Dance and traditional song are employed by thcjefe tnayor, who is the direct descen- dant of God and who has the obligation to see to it that the rules that control us through teaching be respected. This text is of double interest. On the one hand it reveals a tele- scoping of Montezuma/P*fcw and God (tiosh), "the Creator," in which the culture hero merges with the demiurge. In a certain sense the assimilation is justified by the civilizing action of Fitoi, "direct de- scendant of God." This expression thus specifies an ontogenic re- lationship between the founder and the enforcer of the ritual. On the other hand, it shows a link between the order of the human group and the supernaturals. This ritual necessity is not derived from any commonplace revelation, but is established through direct patrilineal descent. Thus is affirmed the origin of authority, founded on a char- ter, and whose force derives precisely from the fact that the myth is also the code for the organization of society. Therefore, the wi:gita appears as a kind of hymn celebrating might, and as an instrument for governing and controlling violence. In the beginning it was by these means that Montezuma was able to assert his authority over people. Later the text stresses the teaching of the ceremonies. Para- doxically, it is at a time when the latter are disintegrating that the pedagogic activity ofxhcjefe mayor of Quitovac is considered of the</page><page sequence="21">506 * Journal of the Southwest utmost importance. Because all the details of the ritual have great importance in the preparations, to explain the ritual is to maintain the sources of power. The role of the moon in the wi:gita calls for an examination of similarities in other ritual practices. An appropriate example is the ritual seclusion of young girls during their menses in a place of de- contamination. In former times this was a hut on the side of the house, or, according to present Quitovac informants, a spot inside the main dwelling. In everyone's opinion, the regular cycles of the moon had a dangerous aspect. Other events with irregular cycles were even more dangerous; for instance, during eclipses, women had to remain hidden. Indigenous accounts state that the dangers as- sociated with the eclipse came from the fact that the sun and the moon perform a sexual act, thought to be violent, that could result in the mutilation or deformity of an unborn child. Velarde, at the beginning of the eighteenth century, described the terror that eclip- ses caused among the Pimas: "When there is thunder or an eclipse of the sun or moon they raise many cries" (Gonzalez 1977:60). This belief underlines the sacrificial aspect of the mating of the twin celes- tial bodies and can in turn explain the esoteric symbolism of the wi:gita. To wit, this ritual reveals the asymmetric character of the sun/moon relationship. All the ritual actions in effect are aimed at celebrating the moon and distancing the sun. Velarde also noted that the Pimas had little interest in the sun: 'They recognize the sun in some way, but not as a deity, and thus they do not worship it nor do they observe any special reverence, and it seems that they regard it merely as the source of their fruits, that lights them and warms them, without further reflections or arguments" (Gonzalez 1977:60). The importance of the moon in the native cosmology can be guessed at in spite of the silence of the early chronicler: "They observe other superstitions that I omit because they are more the silliness of un- couth people than anything else" (Gonzalez 1977:60). RULES OF EXECUTION, FREEDOM OF INTERPRETATION The wi:gita should not be thought of as an intangible ritual event, crystallized over centuries into immutable forms. Therefore, evaluat- ing its variations is an arduous task. To start with, Hayden's work lets</page><page sequence="22">Wi:aita Ritual * 507 us perceive the principal modifications of the past fifty years. His comments also raise important technical questions about the staging of the wi:gita, in that he juxtaposes the fixity, rigid adherence to detail, and immutability of Pueblo rituals to the "fluidity55 of the performances that he observed among the Papagos (Hayden 1987: 312). This dichotomy does not hold up entirely. To be sure, Hayden establishes the difference between the "primary characteristics55 of the wi:gita and the details of execution. The changes noted in the Gu Achi wiigita between 1936 and 1945 involve not only the actors (the death of a ceremonial leader) but also personal preferences in the choice of costumes - for example, the aprons of the nanawicu. In addition, in the 1945 performance, new paraphernalia were used, called for by innovations in songs. Concerning the latter, Hayden makes the interesting observation that the changes resulted from dream experiences. He shows that each wi:gita contained new songs, learned in dreams, that promoted changes in the ritual sequences. Hayden rejects Jones's idea that the dramatic sketches of the sowing with clouds and the growth of the young corn shoots occurred in the same sequence. Hayden observed, on the contrary, that the introduc- tion of new songs in each wi:gita caused changes in the ordering and content of sequences (Hayden 1987:225). The ceremonial leaders are dream specialists, and it is through their dreams that the sequences are defined. On the other hand, according to my informants, in the contemporary Quitovac wi:gita, the emphasis is on repetitive and stereotyped songs, with no innovations. We must recognize that the present situation at Quitovac is very different from that described for Gu Achi by Hayden, in that the wi:gita is maintained by only two groups, and that the repertory of songs is greatly decreased. The reduction in the number of songs implies a retreat and a defensive desire for the preservation of knowl- edge through the memorization of the few texts that remain in the keeping of ceremonial leaders. This is even more important because the songs are the "scripts55 for the daytime choreography and accom- pany the actions of the nighttime, therapeutic part of the ritual. The repetition of the songs, intermixed with cries, paces the movements of arms, alternately raised, and of feet, stomped in cadence. At Quitovac, a count of the totality of the songs is impossible, since singers are more the keepers of a tradition that is dwindling away than specialists in a particular area of knowledge. The success of the</page><page sequence="23">508 * Journal of the Southwest the wiigita rests on the determination and willingness of these lead- ers rather than on their competence as practitioners in a disappearing oral tradition. Therefore the wiigita has a partly fixed but still manipulable struc- ture that allows the incorporation of new elements. Despite this fluidity it must not be forgotten that certain aspects of the wirgita correspond, as in many Pueblo rituals, to fixed criteria that make it, as Hayden said, a "minutely detailed, fixed and unchangeable ritual" (1987:312). Correspondingly, Hayden states that at the end of the 1945 wi:gita, the ceremonial leader announced that the entire ritual had to be repeated the following year because the twentieth song had not been completed before sundown. This remark echoes the concern of the Quitovac participants about the rules and movements within the ceremonial area. Probably in all wi:gitas protocol imposes a formal structure on some operations without whose meticulous enactment the ritual would be void. Moreover, songs were the object of three types of sanctions: tem- poral (as I was told, to sing them outside the ceremonial period would be to risk death), spatial (songs can only be sung within the ritual area), and, finally, sexual (women were excluded from knowing them) - an observation confirmed by Underhill (1969^:137). Such rules, which link the wi:gita with Pueblo rituals, are also expressed in the ceremonial leaders' anxieties concerning the faithful reproduc- tion of songs. The demand for perfection during the performance concerns fidelity in reproduction rather than aesthetics. It seeks spe- cific ends, namely physical and moral well being, and the attracting of rain. The notion of transgression seems to be dominant. For example, while crossing the ceremonial area, the assistant to each group has the task of sprinkling cornmeal over the path. The resulting footprints must not be erased, so spectators are forced to walk around them. The leaders' movements are particularly important, and their tracks are carefully protected. It is also forbidden to drop ceremonial ob- jects, for this risks misfortune. In general, Pimas and Papagos believe that sicknesses can be unleashed through the mishandling of danger- ous objects, in disregard of the commandments of Montezuma/Elder Brother (Bahr 1983:176). The wi:gita thus becomes a generater of sickness. Guided by the statements of the shaman Gregorio, Bahr makes an interesting point concerning this matter, confirmed by information from Quitovac;</page><page sequence="24">Wtiaita Ritual * 509 the energy of the ritual is transferred onto the wi:gita paraphernalia, as in the case of the cloud effigies used in the final procession. Bahr points out that such images are not pathogenic in themselves, but only as elements of the wi:gita (Bahr et al. 1974:23, 32). This con- ception of disease is echoed in therapeutic procedures. In fact, the patient is not cured by means of clouds, but through s reproduction of the wi:gita in modest and simplified form (33). Although shamans diagnose this pathology, they do not treat it. The cure is in the hands of "blowers" who are specialists in the liturgy (Bahr 1988^:76). We can conclude that the ceremony releases two processes: one pathogenic and one orthogenic, linked by an animating force. In either aspect, the ceremony raises a question about the causal link between ritual and origin myth. The monster of Quitovac, despite being a cannibal, seems to be an energetic fortifier. Thus, Mon- tezuma's gift to the Papagos of a piece of the monster's heart - "dia- mond" or "saint" - symbolically expresses the transmission of a force from generation to generation. One senses an ambiguity in this devo- tion which both celebrates Montezuma's exploit and honors a certain energy that is necessary for human survival. Therefore, we can per- ceive the hidden logic of the wi:gita by examining two of its basic concerns: prosperity (of individuals and the community) and physi- cal illness. To return to the theme of the transgression of rules, a misdeed both voids the ritual and releases an abundance of harm- ful energies. Because unconscious fears regulate today's Quitovac wi:gita, one can understand why women, as dangerous creatures, are excluded from instruction in rituals. They are obliged to keep silent and are not permitted to question the meanings of the rituals that they observe (Underhill 1985:82). As for the songs, the question of the relationship between the programmed and the improvised parts of the ritual appears crucial. According to Jones, during the Gu Achi wi:gita a unique custom combined regulation with improvisation. Each village participating in the wi:gita (four, perhaps) presented songs composed by a group of eight persons. Once learned, the songs were performed ne varietur. This custom permitted the integration of groups from different vil- lages into the same ritual (Jones 1971:27). Jones also hypothesized that in the past the village of Gu Achi followed the custom of repeat- ing a fixed corpus of songs, as is the rule at Quitovac. Informants at the latter place give the impression that the role of composer has never existed and that the persons charged with transmitting the</page><page sequence="25">510 * Journal of the Southwest songs were much more repeaters than originators. Actually, the infor- mation on this point is too feeble to establish the relationship be- tween repetition and invention. Jones's functional argument, that the actions of Gu Achi composers were means of regulating an other- wise unmanageable complexity, is plausible in that it lets us see the native solution to a double difficulty: that of establishing a ritual program, and of allowing the tradition's enrichment through the in- dividual creation of new songs. The Quitovac example, on the other hand, shows how two small local groups maintain a threatened custom by following ritual in- structions and song texts to the letter. In this community, the main problem is not to add to an ensemble of songs, but to save texts from oblivion by faithful recitation and rigid teaching. Unfortunately, stylistic and lexical obscurities, often in archaic form, make the in- terpretation of the Papago liturgy almost impossible. The ritual kinesthetics and miming are a mode of communication between ac- tors. Especially important in this regard are the spearing of the mounds of earth and the wood-rat hunt. Both require long-term training and provoke the reticence of those who feel that they are insufficiently trained. The latter's objections are not just a formality, since mistakes during the ritual, as we have seen, can have the serious consequence of ccwi:gita sickness" for actors and spectators alike. In a Gu Achi version of the wi:gita origin myth, a nawicu, perhaps the original one, simultaneously established rules of execution for the ritual and initiated the founding of Gu Achi and four other vil- lages which would celebrate the harvest and attract rain (Hayden 1987:275). Thus does myth justify the formalization of the ritual. To my knowledge, there is no longer any recollection in Quitovac of any instructions by Montezuma concerning the performance of the wi:gita. Actually, the present-day origin myth is probably simpler than earlier versions. It is also possible that Papagos from reservation villages in the United States know the "northern" nawicu myth and have spread this knowledge in the Quitovac region. Concerning the execution of the ritual, Jones insists that the activities of the ten days preceding both wi:gitas are merely rehearsals. According to him, this period is used to train the replacements for deceased actors (repeated by Hayden 1987:294). Among other functions, this liminal rehearsal phase gives final form to the repertory and assures the coordination of the songs. Quitovac informants have told me that wi:gita appren- ticeship lasts several years and follows definite pedagogical rules.</page><page sequence="26">Wt.aita Ritual * 511 Thus one can see two methods of initiation for wiigita participants. One, codified, subjects its candidates to progressive steps and teaches a definite corpus of songs. The other, improvised, is oriented to prob- lems caused by defections, unwillingness to participate, and conflicts. Nowadays, here and elsewhere among Indians, the learning of songs is aided by tape recorders. Frisbie notes that, in Southwestern groups, curing songs are carefully studied through the replaying of tapes be- fore they are performed (1980:332). This technique is not yet com- mon among Mexican Papagos. The oral testimonies gathered in this century attest to an incessant remodeling of the wiigita. This reformulation occurs in the syntax of the ceremony, the commitment of actors, the methods of appren- ticeship, and in the social structure. The testimonies cover two periods: the 1930s and 1940s (Jones 1971; Hayden 1987) and the 1980s. Bahr, however, attempts to go back to the nineteenth century in studying the relationship between Christianity and "state spon- sored Indianism," and the role of the wi:gita in establishing Papago ethnic identity (1988#). These observations are inserted in a regional comparative scheme that includes the Yaqui Easter, the keruk of the Riverine Yumans, and the wi:gita: three rituals interacting with each other, either to integrate with or to oppose Christianity (1989). ENCLOSURE GROUPS AND LINEAGE AFFILIATIONS In his comparative study of the Quitovac and Gu Achi whgitas, Jones explains the greater complexity of the latter by the larger number of villages participating in it. The simpler character of the Quitovac ritual does not derive, in my opinion, from demographic considerations. Until the 1950s the Quitovac rite drew participants from a vast area with many villages. But only a portion of these par- ticipants played ceremonial roles. The rest - relatives and guests - were present as onlookers. Older Papagos maintain that the number of onlookers used to reach a thousand, but the simple division into two enclosure groups and the total number of ceremonial actors did not change from the 1920s (Davis 1920) until the present. The two wi:gitas, thus, were differently organized (dual, simple; and multi- ple, complex) even though their ideologies were basically the same. The Quitovac wi:gita is dualist, both cosmologically (the opposition between the celestial twins, sun and moon) and sociologically (divid-</page><page sequence="27">512 * Journal of the Southwest ing the villages into two groups). However, it is not possible to link the enclosure groups either to the traditional Papago moieties or to any smaller order unilineal descent groups. Let us now relate the descent group issue to directional symbol- ism. The disposition of space in the wiigita reveals a double organiza- tion of ritual space: north-south and east- west. The first concerns the relationship between the enclosure and the ramadas. At present this axis is associated with two dissimilar social groups, one of local ori- gin and one from the United States. Counter to actual geography, however, the U.S. group occupies the southern ceremonial position, and the local group takes the north. Local informants indicate that this arrangement has changed over the years. In the beginning, one enclosure was occupied by the inhabitants of Quitovac, and the other was for the inhabitants of nearby villages or mncherias. In the 1940s, the Quitovac group maintained its enclosure, but the other enclosure came to be occupied by Papagos from the Sells (United States) reser- vation. Finally, at present, the so-called Quitovac group has come to consist of American Papagos of whom only some maintain real or fictitious ties of descent from the original Quitovac families. Through all this is an insistence that one group of people be tied to the local place. Paradoxically, the very lineages that are foreign to Quitovac are the ones that attempt to establish a genealogical relation with the location. In this we see a manipulation on the part of the foreign Papagos of both genealogical and residential criteria. But faced with the impossibility of claiming either, the American Papagos establish a new criterion of belonging, one that excludes the true residents of the community from participating in the wiigita. They define partici- pation in the group by criteria of affiliation of a "territorial" type, in a religious sense. The myth of the foundation of the wi:gita partly explains the importance of this gambit. It is, in effect, a question of consolidating the affiliation established by Montezuma, whose chil- dren the Papagos consider themselves to be. This genealogy is estab- lished in a particular spot - Quitovac. In this fashion the magical character of the wi:gita is inseparable from the place where the exploits of the hero were accomplished. From the actors' point of view, the ritual would lose its efficacy if there was not a clear state- ment of a link between the performers and the territory. Therefore the wi:gita does not seem to be a universalizing ritual. On the contrary, it fixes on and charges descent groups with the task</page><page sequence="28">Wi:aita Ritual * 513 of celebrating the tribal ancestry. Bahr considers the celebration of the wiigita, in the absence of a centralized priesthood, to permit the coalescence of all Papago groups into a kind of nationhood (1988&amp;: 136). But as we will see later, there are additional special considera- tions arising from the migration of Papagos to the United States and the attendant fear of the loss of ceremonial territories in Mexico (most of all, the village of San Francisquito, for annual devotions to Saint Francis, and Quitovac for the wi:gita). EAST- WEST ALIGNMENT We now address in more detail the question of east- west symbol- ism. This orientation corresponds, as has been said, to a celestial opposition: sun- moon. To this is added an opposition between two types of rains: those of the mountains (violent), which fall in the dry season of June and July and are eagerly awaited and those of the sea (soft), which fall sporadically in a wet season from October to De- cember. The Papagos5 special interest in the west is shown in a detail of the wi:gita, the carrying of a cloth decorated with the solar disk. According to a woman from Pozo Prieto, the procession must ap- proach three different positions located on the west side of the cere- monial ground. The two extreme positions may represent the solstice points, and the middle, the equinox of the sun's path. But such expla- nation was not given by this informant. On the other hand, Bahr stresses the importance of the east for all Pima-Papagos as the resi- dence of the souls of the dead (1988^:76). That the wi:gita assigns the moon to the east is in accord with this belief. Another element of the wi:gita that may relate to cardinal points is the arrangement of earth mounds in front of houses. One may specu- late - Papagos have not said so - that the mound patterns are cos- mograms. In support of this is the fact that in the arrangement of the five mounds, as a cross with a point in the middle, the central mound corresponds to the one topped by eagle feathers in the center of the ceremonial ground. In addition, the actions in front of the houses duplicate more simply those performed on the ceremonial ground. According to the participants, these actions, and those on the cere- monial ground, are blessings for the householders. Moreover, the acts before the houses pertain both to hunting (the group leader shoots arrows at the mounds) and to farming (corn flour is sprinkled</page><page sequence="29">514 * Journal of the Southwest on the ground). Thus the housefront acts comprise a ritual within the ritual. One can hypothesize that the fivefold mound arrangement repre- sents both the universe, with its cardinal points, and the ceremonial ground which itself, by metonymy, stands for a house. Finally, each mound might also represent a residential or kinship group, or even - if one compares the above with Underfill's exegesis (1969:139) - a cultivated field. The shared element of spearing the mounds would support this idea. Finally, it is important to grasp that the miniature wiigitas performed before the houses connect the village households both to the ritual and to the kinship relations represented by the visiting families. As Cano Avila has observed, the dancers, after stop- ping at the actual houses, also check in at the temporary campsites next to the ceremonial ground (1979:138). The fact that these visits are understood as curative highly emphasizes their importance. THERAPEUTIC PETITION, SACRIFICE, AND APPEALS FOR RAIN All informants agree that an essential function of the wi:gita is the maintenance of environmental energies in homeostatic equilibrium. Not surprisingly, however, the ritual is also a vector of sickness, caused by the ineffectual manipulation of these energies. Among the therapeutic sequences is one in which the participants scratch the soil, then smudge their bodies and faces with dust. These actions are locally interpreted as a cleansing with water, for which earth is a symbolic substitute; one rubs the hands and face as if with liquid. This seeming curiosity can be compared to a later episode in which a clown shoots an arrow towards the sun, to release a gush of water. The connection between earth and water is validated and mediated by the lunar figure that presides over the movements of fluids. Every- where Papagos are attentive to this type of phenomenon to which is linked, for example, the secretion of sap. According to local custom, trees are only felled during the full moon to avoid rot. When there is a new moon and when the sap is rising, the plants are engorged with water. Moreover, horses are castrated only in the last quarter of the moon, when their blood is thick. During the first quarter, the blood is considered to be fluid, and the operation involves risking hemor- rhage. Menstruations are similarly related to the lunar cycle.</page><page sequence="30">WvMtta Ritual * 515 Thus, the moon appears tied to the dynamic of fluids, particularly water. It is possible that the healing functions of the wi:gita are de- rived from these hydraulic functions. The fertilizing rains invoked in a wi:gita thus have curative powers. One recalls that at the end of former ritual deer hunts, the actors bathed in the Quitovac lagoon. They ran to it, and the first to arrive, they say, was rewarded with a young girl. Confirmed or not, this belief highlights the relationship between speed and erotic activity or fecundity. Earlier I have de- scribed how the gesture of covering the body with dust equates the ceremonial ground with a body of water. Thus, there are many signs that the physical space in which the wi:gita is performed reproduces the primitive lagoon where Montezuma killed the monster - a vic- tory celebrated in the ritual. In fact, the hunting behavior of the ceremonial clowns supports this thesis, both because their shooting of arrows brings rain and because their gestures and their striking of each other's buttocks make it seem, according to one informant, "as if they are bathing each other in the pond." The discrete sexuality of this episode is reinforced by explicit symbols, such as the coati tails that the nanawicu formerly wore hanging around their necks. The coati (Nasua nasua) , or chulo in local Spanish, is also known locally as the "great koson" (koson grande). This taxonomic assimilation of coati to koson is in accord with the ritual use of the tail in the "koson hunt." The same practice of decorating the chest with the tail or skin of an animal also occurs in the Gu Achi wi:gita, where the dancers use the skin of the "ringtail" (Bassariscus astutus), an animal known in Mexico as cacomixtle. In the previous decades the jokes of the nanawicu were essential to the wirgita. Now greatly reduced, they still preserve a symbolic code. The purpose of the final running of the two clowns, in the past, was the separation of the winners. The ethnography of running among Pimans and other Southwestern societies (Pueblos in particular) shows a constant relationship between speed and the search for cos- mic fertility. This relationship, as we have seen, is implicitly moti- vated. For instance, in the remembrances of Chona's father, running is thought to bring about mind alteration, in particular "visions" (Underhill 1985:47). The sacrifice of the koson appears in some way to be the focus of the wirgita. This act serves to promote the arrival of rains, symbol- ized by the carrying of a rainbow and a drawing of the sun, and by</page><page sequence="31">516 * Journal of the Southwest the piling of ocotillo branches on the back of the last dancer in the line. Seeds of the ocotillo plant, put aside and later eaten, symbolize all cultivated plants. The word koson applies to different rodents, in- cluding the muskrat (ondrata) and pack rat (neotoma). Nabhan, Rea, Reichardt, Mellinck, and Hutchinson restrict the term koson to the white- throated pack rat, Neotoma cdbigula (1982: 137). The difficulty in identifying this rodent was noted by Russell among the Pimas. He observed that the animal locally called koson was formerly eaten (1980:80). It was also eaten among the Papagos, although they con- sidered it a sacred animal. The use of the koson as food is clear in the miming of the nanawicu^ who quickly kill it with a blow of the lance, butcher it, and consume it (Cano Avila 1979: 142). We will next consider the kosotfs "ocean pumping" function, rep- resented by an informant as an addition to the version of the wi:gita origin. This function is elucidated by the myth of the Children's Shrine from the northern wi:gita area (Underbill 1944:12). Briefly, this myth states that a young hunter chased a badger into its hole. The hole grew larger and filled with water, which caused a flood that threatened to destroy everything. The people consulted shamans who advised making offerings of bird down and turquoise. These items did not lessen the flood. It was then decided to sacrifice two boys and two girls. When they were sent into the hole, the flood stopped. Ever after, these children, who are considered still to be alive, have been the objects of petitions for prosperity, well being, and the germination of crops. In the story, the badger appears as the vector of the sea and the harbinger of the flood. The sacrifice of the children, in this case, is a necessity for human survival. One can discern here a transforma- tional system, in Levi-Strauss's sense, in which the badger occupies the place of the koson. The northern myth's initial offering of down feathers to stem the flood helps elucidate the use of eagle down (wi:g) in the southern ritual drama. With this in mind, we can see a global system of meaning for both myths, but with a built-in vacilla- tion between a demand for rain and an imperative of hydrological control. At present there is no absolute evidence that there was a past relationship between the Quitovac wi:gita and the myth of the Chil- dren's Shrine. In favor of the connection is the fact that the Quitovac people now know about the Gu Achi wi:gita and its associated sac- rifice myth.</page><page sequence="32">Wr.aita Ritual * 517 Wi:gita musicians' shelter, Quitovac, Sonora. Drawing by Jean-Marc Chavy. The purpose of wi:gita songs and music is to attract rain. Gon- zalez writes that the cowbells, tinkle bells, and seashells of the Quito- vac wi:gita costumes are intended to "frighten" desert animal spirits who would prevent the coming of rain ( 1981 : 1 1 ) . This curious detail implies that some desert creatures have a function opposite to the koson^ which seems surprising and may not be true. I was unable to confirm Gonzalez's theory through further discussions with Quitovac people. At the llano del kuku (Plain of the Kuku), three men, sitting side by side, with a fourth one behind them, make music throughout the ritual. Their only instrument is a basket, corita in the local Spanish. This term is only used for the Papago baskets they call hw.ha. Held between the legs, it acts as a resonance chamber for the scraping of a bone (deer mandible or front tibia) on a notched stick. The songs, inaudible to spectators across the ceremonial ground, are thought to bring rain. Only the musicians know the words. They sit with legs extended as if petrified under the ramada, leaving only for brief in- stances throughout the night and until the end of the ritual the next day. Formerly the woman in charge of the ceremonial bundle brought them fermented drinks (tepache). The songs required a long learning period. Underhill gives the translation of one of them:</page><page sequence="33">518 * Journal of the Southwest All kinds of clouds together Their heads upreared And with it, they did go. Pulling white feathers from their breasts, they went. ( 1979 : 5 1 ) In this fragment one sees the importance of feathers, probably down feathers, as cloud substitutes. Chona told Underhill that, in her opin- ion, the down under the eagle's tail, thought to bring water, was "almost the same as rain" (1985:49). In the salt pilgrimage, accord- ing to the same author, eagle down was offered at the volcanoes of Pinacate and at other places where people stopped for water (1980: 163). One asked for the assistance of these volcanoes before drink- ing. In the myth oiVitoi and Htfok Oks, Elder Brother (Fitoi) decapi- tates an eagle whose feathers float to the eastern sky and change into clouds, thus marking the victory of the hero (Jose 1983: 121). Hence the significance of placing eagle feathers on the kosorts burrow, where seawater was supposed to emerge, is clear. Actually, the howling of the wi:gita actors in front of the Quitovac houses could be inter- preted as the cry of a bird, possibly an eagle. Furthermore, the word "m;/j," meaning "down feather," is thought to be source of the cere- monial name "wi:gita." Many pieces of lore portray the eagle as dangerous, but possessing powers useful to humans. Therefore, the feathered sticks are never destroyed after wi:gitas. SMOKING AND EMETIC CONSTRAINTS Tobacco is crucial to ritual practices. According to Underhill, the ancient Papagos cultivated this plant in secret spots (1965:250). In Quitovac this custom was formerly respected in relation to the wi:gita (Rodriguez, personal communication). Today, during the prepara- tions under the ramada, the actors and assistants maintain a constant cloud of smoke. In fact, one can relate the symbolism of smoke and water by recalling that clouds, as bringers of rain, are drawn on pieces of cloth and paraded during the final wi:gita procession. Further- more, rains are propitiated by blowing four puffs of smoke. The aquatic element has curative properties. Thus it is not sur- prising that clouds of smoke are credited with therapeutic virtues. Formerly in Quitovac lived shamans whose reputation extended throughout the region. One of their techniques was to blow tobacco</page><page sequence="34">Wiigita Ritual * 519 smoke over the pained part of the body while shaking a rattle - recall that in the wi:gita the small bells attached to the body were said to attract rain. Two of these shamans, Cachito and Ratonto, were also "governors" (jjobernadores) of the village, and they controlled the wiigita, a privilege that shows the overlap between the shamanic (therapeutic) and sacerdotal (ceremonial) functions. The importance of drinking during the wiigita has considerably diminished in recent years. According to local sources, a ritual con- sumption of saguaro cactus wine occurred ten days after the begin- ning of the notched-stick day count. The fermented drink was placed in large jars inside the ceremonial hut. They were covered with a cloth (ixtle) that was wetted with water, on which grains of corn were quickly germinated. The governor watched over the ceremonial liquid contained in the jars. This saguaro wine (called tepache in Qui- tovac Spanish) had inebriating powers, and its consumption was reg- ulated. Today these jars have disappeared, although one example re- mains in a private house at the village. No alcoholic beverages were tolerated during the wiigita itself. Only water, carried by a young girl, was available for the actors and musicians. Today it is recalled that she was forbidden to place the water jar on the ground. Winemaking in Quitovac has disappeared along with the destruc- tion of the ceremonial house. We can understand its meaning, how- ever, by comparing it with a practice on the Sells reservation in the United States. According to informants in Quitovac, during the har- vest of the saguaro fruit, a circular house covered with creosote branches was built. As with the ceremonial house, one entered this structure through a narrow opening. Inside, the syrup of the saguaros fermented in pottery jars. Three days were devoted to con- suming the finished wine. In an open space in front of the house, men and women sat in a circle for each entire day, swallowing huge quantities of the liquid. Four shamans had the task of keeping them seated. Any drinker who toppled over was replaced, while the others continued to drink and to evacuate the liquid through their mouths and bowels. According to the same informants, the purpose of the ritual was to purify the body and spirit. The evacuations were destined to fer- tilize the earth, a concept similar to that proposed by Underhill, in which a saturation of the body was necessary to bring about a satura- tion of the earth (1969^i41). Songs, long and numerous, were sung throughout the three days. They celebrated the wine and also made</page><page sequence="35">520 * Journal of the Southwest statements about the performance of the ritual. Today this feast has nearly disappeared. The gathering of saguaro fruits is no longer an occasion for village meetings; the Papagos of this reservation place priority on cattle raising. At Quitovac there was never a ceremony identical to the more northerly Papago wine feast. Yet, the drinking that formerly preceded the wiigita expressed the same ideology, namely, the fertilization of the earth through emetic processes. Thus, there is a common seman- tics of bodily orifices, especially the mouth, which liberates both smoke and wine, which returns to the earth as a rain of vomit. A PROLOGUE TO THE WHGITAl THE RITUAL OF THE MULE DEER Certain obscurities in the wiigita can be explained if we examine the deer-hunting ritual that immediately preceded it in former Quitovac practice. Because of Mexican regulations against deer hunt- ing, this ceremony ceased in Quitovac in the 1950s and in Sonoyta in 1938 (Cano Avila 1979:138). Still, many elderly informants have clear memories of the hunt, and it still occurs at La Angostura (Men- ager's Dam) on the Sells Reservation. The deer hunt takes place ten days before the wiigita. The gover- nor of Quitovac kept a stick of greasewood marked with ten notches. Each day he either obliterated a knob or marked a notch, according to local sources. The first notch marked the beginning of the deer hunt, while the last two notches stood for the two days of the wiigita. A month before this ritual, the governor called the inhabitants of Quitovac together to explain the protocol of the deer ceremony and to review its songs and actions. The upcoming wiigita was also dis- cussed, for to be leader of the deer hunt was also to be leader of the wiigita. According to my informants, the double office seems to have been hereditary. Several of them remember that ten days before the deer hunt, the Papagos in distant villages (e.g., Caborca, La Nariz, and La Angostura) received packets of sticks, "the letter" with which to count the days until the ritual. Formerly the sticks seem to have been enveloped in a reed tube. Besides simply informing the villages, these packets bound them to attendance at the feast. This custom is still followed at La Angostura. Let us consider the scenario of the deer hunt. The first act took</page><page sequence="36">Wr.aita Ritual * 521 place at dawn, a horseback chase of a deer to the Cerro Colorado (Red Mountain). The animal was captured alive, killed by a pond near the village, and suspended between two tree forks erected under a ramada. Then the meat was boiled and saved in sacks, to be distri- buted to the dancers on the following day. During the intervening night, there was an unusual association between men and women who were neither lovers nor married to each other. A dance began at nightfall. Facing lines of men and women, holding sticks, danced as follows: the men stomped the ground with one foot and the women genuflected. As many informants attest, from time to time, couples retired to a dry riverbed for lovemaking. Apparently this behavior was tolerated and even expected. At dawn the last songs were ad- dressed to the clouds so that rain would fall. During the ritual the governor remained inside the ceremonial house, making smoke clouds to favor the rain. Saguaro wine, placed next to him, was dis- tributed after dawn. The ritual ended with a race to, and subsequent bathing in, the village pond. The deer meat was distributed with many precautions, one of which was that it had to be consumed without salt. Only some Mex- icans, who lived in Quitovac and attended the dance, added salt and pepper before eating. The tail of the deer, fixed on a stick by the governor, and jealously guarded, had prophylactic properties. It was used to care for sick people during this ritual and also for healing sicknesses caused by the wi.gita. Fbrmerly, shamans rubbed the tail on the stomachs of the patients to cure various other diseases. Deer could cause many maladies, especially bodily swelling (Un- derbill 1985:49). Thus, the special danger of the deer-hunt ritual can be understood if we place it in the context of the general Papago taxonomic practice of matching rituals and animals to the causal agents of sickness (Bahr et al. 1974:33). We can observe that if ritual paraphernalia such as bird feathers are believed to be elements of greater forces, this would also apply fully to the deer tail which, through its magic properties, permits acts of healing and the casting of spells. For comparative purposes, it is important to examine the deer ritual as practiced at Pozo Prieto. Again, the rite remains only in the memories of very old people. It was celebrated after the feast of San Juan, in the first days of July, in an isolated space close to a dry river by the road that went to Las Calenturas. The celebrants were Papagos from the two villages, and from the village of Las Norias. This rite</page><page sequence="37">522 * Journal of the Southwest preceded the wi:gita, celebrated at Quitovac. (There is no memory of a local wi:gita.) Under the authority of the governor, the kuash tosh (deer day) started with a chase in which the hunters tired the animal by pursuing it on horseback. During planned rest periods, the men passed around a cigar, each man taking four puffs. Once the deer was lassoed or captured by hand, a song was addressed to it while it was gently caressed from nose to tail. It was killed by an old man appointed by the governor, then skinned and gutted. The in- nards were saved, however, and carried to the ceremonial grounds. A runner brought the deer tail on a lance to the governor who was guarding pots of tesquin (wine) at the ceremonial grounds, an open spot near the village. (There was no ceremonial house at Pozo Prieto.) The deer meat was cooked without salt by two (or four) women appointed by the governor. Anyone who blew on it during the cooking would acquire deer sickness. The dance to ask for rain was held at night. Men and women formed a line perpendicular to the east. In front of them an uncross- able cornmeal line was drawn on the ground. Facing them were four musician/singers who played the corita. The dancers, with their pant- legs rolled up, wore cloth aprons. Their arms and torsos were deco- rated with clay lines, imitating deer. They held arrows in one hand and lances in the other, both apparently being means to obtain rain. The women's faces were streaked with dust, and their arms were spotted in intimation of young deer. Four intermissions in the danc- ing during the night gave opportunity, as at Quitovac, for lovemak- ing. During shorter pauses, a cigar was passed around for each in attendance to puff four times. In the morning the actors held hands and circled four times around the ceremonial space. The leader of the procession wore a belt with a bell. Next, the men went to the Rio Asuncion for a purifying bath, and finally, a wine of saguaro or pitaya fruit was passed among all the participants. One man had watched over it through the preceeding night. At dawn, at the end of the ritual, the musicians who had played the corita, as in the wi:gita, turned their baskets face up to receive the deer meat. The ceremonial paraphernalia - actors' clothing, musical instruments, and a basket with eagle feathers - were stored during the rest of the year under bushes in an out-of-the-way place. Informants emphasize the strict rules that governed the ceremony at Pozo Prieto. Any error in the sequence of events, or in the choreog- raphy (such as overstepping the line drawn on the ground), could</page><page sequence="38">Wi:aita Ritual * 523 produce deer sickness. As at Quitovac, a shaman could be called in to ward off such sickness by blowing smoke on the actors and strok- ing their bodies with the tail of the sacrificed deer. Again, a therapeu- tic ritual appears to be tied to, and in affirmation of, shamanic and political power. The deer tail is a means of curing and also a symbol of authority; the governor, and not the shaman, holds it during most of the ceremony. The date of the deer hunt varied from community to community. At Sonoyta it was held on the night of June 23; at La Angostura, it was delayed until August. More generally, as Underhill has indicated (1979:46), there was a difference in timing between the southern region of Papagos, where the rite was celebrated at the beginning of the rainy season, and the northern region, where it immediately pre- ceded the migration from summer to winter villages. Until the 1940s the deer-hunt ritual was undoubtedly important in the south. Elderly participants remember events attended by more than a thousand persons drawn from the far corners of the Altar Desert. Once the ritual ended, they returned home, only to recon- vene in a few days for the wirgita. The massive emigration of Papagos north to the United States and the Mexican prohibition on deer hunting caused the feast to disappear. It survives at La Angostura in southern Arizona, where a group from Quitovac eventually settled. Examined closely, the ideology of the deer-hunt ritual has many similarities to that of the wi:gita. For example, as Bahr points out, the eagle feather and the deer tail are explicitly equated in a deer song: "This tail of mine: eagle feather similar is" (1979:256). As a hunting ritual, the "deer day" (kuasb tosh) shows the therapeutic value of deer, especially of deer meat, the consumption of which is both a festive event and an occasion for spiritual strengthening. This is the food that in the myth was procured by Fitoi for his people (Underhill 1969^:85). The sacrifice and consumption of the deer has a "gastronomic" concreteness which is absent in the mimed koson hunt of the wi:gita. Yet both rituals have the same purpose, that of attracting rain and increasing crops. Thus the ritual leader, the "keeper of the smoke," continuously makes clouds of tobacco smoke inside the ceremonial house throughout both events. According to Underhill, four puffs of smoke allowed a human to make contact with the god of rain (1980:164). Like the wi:gita, the deer ritual creates a field of dangerous forces. Underhill remarks on the importance of a four-day fast after the Gu</page><page sequence="39">524 * Journal of the Southwest Achi wi:gita (not carried out at Quitovac), to free the actors from the "magic" of the dance (1979:47). In this northern ceremony, she says, special care was also taken in removing the actors' body paintings, an act that was effected in the south, in both the deer rites and the wi:gita, by bathing in a lagoon. At present the only recollection of such painting is from Pozo Prieto. Curious similarities can be noted between the Pozo Prieto descriptions and the designs on the limbs of the nanawicu, as represented by Hayden (1987, plates 1 and 2). Another analogy between the wi:gita and the deer ritual, but more explicit in the latter, is sexual arousal through dancing. Underhill's informant, Chona, remarked on the importance of physical contact in dances, especially the harvest (generally including deer hunts) dance, when males shook rattles with one hand while resting the other hand on the shoulder of bare-breasted women (1985:60). Un- derhill states that at these times the normal matrimonial bonds were relaxed so that women in particular could exalt their sensuality (1969^:197). In the Pima creation myth, Elder Brother (Fitoi), who bathed to regain his strength, was so interested in adolescent girls that mankind needed to hunt and kill him (Shaw 1968:6). Chona mentions similar beliefs about Elder Brother (Underhill 1985:60). These mythic us- ages recall the practice at Pozo Prieto, where in effect humans imitate animals in a vast ceremonial mating. By metonymy, the erotic character of the dancing sheds light on the deer-hunting ritual and the act of removing the tail as a trophy. Is the deer slaughter a metaphor for castration, and the myth of the killing of Elder Brother a weak echo? Is there an overtone of "sac- rifice" in the actors3 ceremonial copulation? These questions may re- main unexplained because of the reticence of the informants. The deer ritual takes place either on a moonless or weakly moonlit night. Bahr revealed the opposition in some song texts between a daytime rule of predation (that of men chasing deer) and a nocturnal rule of atonement (that of men singing songs) (1979:266). Furthermore, zoologists attest that deer are most active on moonless nights (Olin 1982: 10). At Pozo Prieto, eclipses are considered to be occasions for couplings between celestial beings. During eclipses women are kept secluded to avoid the scorching or deformation of their unborn chil- dren. This conception of thermal disequilibrium recalls the injunc- tion at Pozo Prieto against blowing on the deer meat as it cooked, a prohibition, that is, against premature cooling. One can say that the</page><page sequence="40">Wi:nita Ritual * 525 excessive heat caused by dancing is countered by a cool bath in the arroyo. All the Sonora informants agree that the deer ceremony can only take place near water where the dancers can refresh themselves in a final purification and cooling. Some beliefs about the devil will clarify the deer ritual symbolism. In Pozo Prieto it is said that he can appear in the form of a deer. The story is told of a man who went hunting. He shot a deer but did not fell it. When he looked, he found no trace of the animal; in its place he discovered a gold deposit, proving that the animal was really a devil (jiawul). It is not surprising to find the figure of the devil con- nected to a ritual request for rain. The devil also governs the subterra- nean space at San Francisquito, where another ritual of curing and rainmaking takes place through the veneration of a Catholic saint. SALT, BLOOD, AND SEA The prohibition against eating salt during the ritual, which is men- tioned by all informants, provides a path into hidden aspects of the Papago world view. The Quitovac Indians formerly specialized in extracting blocks of salt from flats along the Sea of Cortez. They used some of the salt in the village and sold the rest of it at a store run by an American on the U.S. side of the border. Other Papagos traded farther north, among the Pimas, for beans and grain (Webb 1982: 65). The Quitovac people's route to the sea went by Los Medanos ("The Meanders"), the sand dunes area, "los medanos de arena" men- tioned by Kino (Ives 1989:29). Salt collecting was formerly ritualized, but there is no longer any trace of this at Quitovac. Prayer sticks were planted along the way; cornmeal was thrown on the waves, and more prayer sticks were cast into the water. The trip, said to require three days, was understood as a trial of manhood, since all sources state that the ocean was con- ceived as a dangerous power (Underhill 1969^:232). The menace of the sea was classed as feminine. Underhill says that, according to belief, the ocean would reject cornmeal offered by a man whose wife was "dangerous" (menstruating) - but the man whose wife was not in that state would be granted a magical vision (1969^:235). Further- more, first-time salt pilgrims were enjoined to take new equipment, in order to avoid carrying objects contaminated by pregnant or menstruating women (1969^:213).</page><page sequence="41">526 * Journal of the Southwest In the deer ritual, the prohibition against using salt kept that dangerous female substance from destroying the power of the male deer meat. We can compare this prohibition upon males with a simi- lar one imposed upon females at the time of their first menstruation. They were confined to the home and subjected to drastic dietary restrictions, including absolute salt abstinence. A female shaman gave the young girl a drink of crushed earth in order to purify her body. Consequently, the salt prohibition seems to correspond directly with a taboo about blood. Salt, it seems, implicitly causes the excessive retention of danger- ous feminine blood. In the deer ritual, the meat's strength and therapeutic power are maintained by forbidding contact with im- pure, feminine salt. This belief shows a polarity, between the mas- culine (deer, health giving), and the feminine (women, salt, illness, sorcery). Here we note a difference in these matters in the two ritu- als. In the wi:gita, women assist but cannot participate in any key actions, whereas in the deer ceremony their presence is necessary, but only after the animal is captured. Paradoxically, the deer seems to acquire efficacy only after it dies, since the saving of its tail maintains its supernatural life. Behind these admonitions are certainly the dangers of female sex- ual physiology. The deer ritual demonstrates the necessity of protect- ing oneself both from menstrual blood and salt. This thesis is con- firmed by the sexual prohibitions at the time of menstruation. Russell says that, for the Papagos, the prohibition against eating salt ex- tended for four days after the ritual (1980:266). As we have seen, the entire ceremony is a metaphor for the pairing of the sexes, both animals and humans. In Quitovac people were advised not to have sex before the hunt; local belief held that the vaginal smell would repel the deer. At Pozo Prieto, men whose wives were menstruating had no luck in hunting. Notable also are Chona's comments on men's avoidance of war while their wives were menstruating (Underhill 1985:41). The in- junction against a menstruating woman's touching or even seeing her husband's arrows subtly accents the opposition between menstrual blood and manly power. This rule also explains the prohibition of women from the deer hunt and the subsequent ceremony. As in the wi:gita, the basic issue is growth: germination must be protected. Thus menstruating women are prohibited from gardens or fields so that the plants will not dry up. Similarly, spectators at the wi:gita are</page><page sequence="42">Wi.aita Ritual * 527 forbidden to eat plants growing near the ceremonial area, especially mesquite beans. The addition to the Quitovac wi:gita origin myths, in which the pack rat draws the sea through the ground, confirms the relationship between salt and menstrual blood. Could we say that the rule against eating salt is a symbolic precaution against a sea flood? And to what extent is salt the "blood of the sea"? Recall that during the ritual purification after a girl's first menstrual period, the girl is decorated with tokens brought by the men from their salt pilgrimages (Under- hill 1985:61). Therefore, the juxtaposition of salt and blood is not arbitrary. This hypothesis of the identification of menstrual blood with salt, which I formulated with hesitation in 1989, is strengthened by additional information that I obtained in Quitovac in the follow- ing year: ocean shoals become red at regular monthly intervals. Thus, the informant explained, "the sea is just like a woman" because it submits to the same rhythm. In this context we can also quote Chona on menstrual sequestration: "I had to stay four days and then I was not dangerous any more. Everything goes by four with our people, and Elder Brother arranged it that even this thing should be the same" (Underhill 1985:59). As a good hermeneute^ she notes the occurrence of the number four in ritual procedures. Therefore, it would be tempting to propose a kind of philosophy for the forma- tion of ritual rules from this casual remark: if everything goes in four in Papago culture, it is because of the four days of menstruation. Young girls during their first period must avoid using salt because of the relation between this condiment and the flow of blood. Since salt is "blessed" and must be handled with care (like blood), it must not be wasted. Now let us examine the Quitovac belief according to which men- struating women cannot enter the ocean. I suggest as a hypothesis that this precaution is reinforced in order to avoid contact with a polluting substance (seawater), and perhaps to avoid doubling its effect. During the salt pilgrimage, the men, despite their fears, had to throw themselves into the waves four times. Was this fear a mea- sure of their avoidance of a pathogenic flux, or was this act an entry into an amniotic environment? We cannot say. Conceived as a steriliz- ing fluid, salt water is like the desolate landscape that borders the local sea, the inhospitable region of the coastal Medanos. The distanc- ing of the marine element appears to be a response to a need to obtain optimal conditions for the sexual intercourse essential for</page><page sequence="43">528 * Journal of the Southwest reproduction, without risk of sickness transmitted by the ocean. This is the essence of the prohibition concerning blood. If the sea is the source of atmospheric disorders, so is menstrual blood. In Pozo Prieto, people believe that such blood causes whirlwinds and tor- nados. Thus, the fears of salt and blood encase the wirgita in rules designed to avoid contact with these elements. In the final analysis, the water symbolism has two aspects. As energy, sweet water fertilizes the earth and purifies the body. At the end of the wi:gita, a bath in the arroyo purifies the dancers after their erotic games. As pathology, salt water is associated with sterility and sorcery (since the salt pilgrimage was an occasion for acquiring dreams, being blessed by miracles, and acquiring spiritual powers that could be used to harm others). For this reason, entering the ocean needed to be ritualized (Pozo Prieto). The first origin story of the wirgita represents a kind of neutral version on which modifying elements can be grafted. Another version states that the sea assumed its present geographical position due to the work of ants. This dis- position of the sea is precarious, it is said, for the world could be covered by water at any time. By this logic we can imagine the nc:\ng ("sea monster") as a metaphor for the ocean, for a thing that swal- lows, and gives rise to turbulence. These ideas could have been for- malized into a general "menstrual paradigm." FROM WIIGITA TO THE CULT OF SAN FRANCISCO The waning of the wi:gita in the last two decades makes tradi- tional Papagos bitter. They think that effective participation in the ceremony would immediately increase the rainfall. This preoccupa- tion has two components: that there is a causal link between the ritual and the rain, and that human action is required to close this link. Thus, not only a simple acceptance of a rule, but also an active participation in the ritual is required. For this reason the elders per- sist in teaching the wi:gita to the young Papagos. But since they no longer participate in farming, most young people do not find these ceremonial activities compelling. The stakes are high for the old people. They unanimously com- plain about the scarcity of rain, which they blame on the decline of the wiigita. According to them, the abandonment of the ritual will</page><page sequence="44">Wi^ita Ritual * 529 be followed by natural calamities or acts of sorcery. (To be sure, some sicknesses derive from animals, especially the deer, which is said to be "like a saint.") The old people also remember that Papagos were formerly strong and relatively free of sickness. The loss of "be- liefs" is accompanied by a waning of vital "strength," a homeostatic disequilibrium which makes people more vulnerable to pathogens. Let us now shift attention from ritual to pantheon. Of all the saints that Papagos venerate, San Francisco is the only object around which a true cult has developed. Nolasco mentions a veneration of San Ignacio, but I have heard nothing about this (1979:19). Cer- tainly San Francisco makes rain. Papagos, always sensitive to climate, note that a fine rain normally begins in the days preceding the saint's feast day on October 4. A second rain normally falls several days after the feast. The pair of rains is popularly called the "Cord of San Fran- cisco" (Cordonazo de San Francisco) or kipata in the local Mexican Papago. As is well known, the Papagos celebrate the feast of San Francisco Xavier on October 4, a date normally reserved for the veneration of St. Francis of Assisi. The feast has long been celebrated at Magdalena de Kino, but according to Spicer, the cult greatly expanded in the years following 1890 (Spicer 1981:139). This multiethnic pilgrim- age brings together Mexicans, Yaquis, Pimas, and Papagos from the eastern part of the Sells reservation and from San Xavier del Bac. Those from the western part of the Sells reservation (Pisinimo and Angostura) and from Ajo prefer to go to San Francisquito, a place in the municipio of Caborca. In the chapel at San Francisquito there is a reclining statue of the saint. They believe it to be the authentic San Francisco, while the one at Magdalena is considered to be a wooden copy. The village of San Francisquito is thought to be inhabited by dangerous forces and to contain buried gold. Therefore it is rigor- ously kept free from human soiling, most notably defecation. An informant who went there on a pilgrimage was seized by the need to defecate, and as he squatted he had the vision of an ancestor. The episode reminds one of a similar belief, that of a supernatural person who appears to people while they travel at night. This figure walks noiselessly and refuses to speak. Furthermore, the belief in the pres- ence of gold in the village assumes also the presence of the devil. He is said to have eyes of burning coals, a long tail, feet like a dog, and to live at the village of La Proveedora. (Bahr has shown how the</page><page sequence="45">530 * Journal of the Southwest devil is linked to mines and cattle as well as gold [1988**: 78]. This echoes beliefs reported throughout rural Mexico since colonial times.) Several mythic accounts describe a fight between Fitoi and the devil over the division of the world. Perhaps there are also stories in which the devil confronts San Francisco, but I have no information on them. Even without these stories, we can see that the saint is charged with a dangerous energy. Thus, the shaman Gregorio classes this saint among the world's dangerous objects (Bahr et al. 1974:33). We have seen that San Francisco abhors physical pollution (defeca- tion). He also abhors sin. As in Magdalena, his reclining statue in a chapel at Sonoyta is worshipped by kissing the hands and touching the face. People raise the head in order to caress it, and it is said that those whose sins are too great cannot lift it. At San Francisquito, where the saint is transported from house to house during the feast, it is also said that people who are in a state of sin cannot lift him. The prayers for the saint's feast, in October, are a mixture of re- quests to heal sickness and to request rain. At Sonoyta the story is told of a cattleman who prayed for rain. When it fell the next day, this man sacrificed a calf. It is said that early in this century offerings of food were a major aspect of the devotions at San Francisquito. Part of the food was distributed to the visiting pilgrims, since no mone- tary transactions were permitted at the site. Nowadays devotions to the saint take many forms. First, there are adorations of small images kept in people's private houses. Second, at Sonoyta the saint is visited throughout the year in a chapel situated in the Papago Ejido. On the night of October 3, a large crowd attends a mass for this saint. Be- sides the mass, there is a night-long vigil with rosary and novena prayers. The crowd files by the reclining saint and then spends the rest of the night dancing to the music of an orchestra from the Papago village of Santa Rosa. THE TWO PILLARS OF THE RELIGION Although the rituals seem to belong to two different religions, the wi:gita and the devotion to San Francisco show signs of mutual influ- ence. The Papagos think of themselves as Christians, variously Cath- olic and Protestant. As Bahr points out, these latter are slightly differ- ent inflections of a common "Sonoran" folk Christianity (1988&amp;:</page><page sequence="46">Wv.gita Ritual * 531 150-51). The whole Papago religion is syncretic, as exemplified by the application of the ostensibly Christian word "God" (Papago tiosh, from Spanish dios) to the culture hero Montezuma/fVfctt. In truth, the figure of Montezuma stands at the meeting point between colo- nial elements and indigenous traditions of the Greater Southwest. Informants from Quitovac and Sonoyta identify Montezuma with the figure of a powerful demigod protector of the Papagos. The pre- cariousness of the state of the human world is revealed in the precau- tions, prohibitions, and constraints with which ritual bristles. Every ritual action carries a reminder of the possible failure of the whole. This sense of a fragile universe derives from a notion that original chaos is bound to recur because time is cyclical. Accordingly, Bahr observes that the Piman world view lacks the notion of a definitive creation, and that the elements that comprise nature and humanity remain necessarily in a state of interaction (1975:77). In this universe menaced by disequilibrium, Montezuma has a role of great importance. Not only is he a dispenser of rain, but he can prevent the formation of clouds. He also controls the marine element, which has a force of its own, for it swallows men in its vortex. Meanwhile the sea has a redemptive quality, for it sweeps away sinners (San Francisco, lord of the rain, is also the patron of fishermen). These beliefs conform with the role of the wi:gita in regulating rain. In 1937 the ceremony was not performed. For the next two years it rained to the point of deluge, so the Papagos de- cided to revive the ceremony in the following year. A final notion emerges from comparing the wi:gita and its various founding myths. This is the notion of a dynamism of fluxes which men attempt to control under directives from Montezuma, an invisi- ble creature, an espiritu. Within all forms of belief he watches over all Papagos. (In this region, the term "Montezuma" takes precedence over IHtoi in referring to this god.) At Quitovac people say that Mon- tezuma/Tftoi was, in ancient times, the master of the mountain Babo- quivari. When he was chased away from the mountain for stealing a woman, he found refuge in the Pinacate mountains, where he still makes his home. Do the two names and traditions refer to a single character? Local opinions differ on this point. Most people merge them, but a few uphold a distinction, indicating one or the other as the master of Baboquivari. All who make the separation ignore the episode of the flight. (Some, however, distinguish between Montezuma and Fitoi,</page><page sequence="47">532 * Journal of the Southwest and hold that the former lives in the Pinacates and the latter at Baboquivari.) In the local myth of the flood, the Indians went to the Pinacates to ask aid from Montezuma. It is said that the elders first asked the "Sand People" (nomads residing around the volcanoes) to deliver them from the monster, then later directed their requests to Mon- tezuma. Present-day Papagos believe that now humans also live deep below the Pinacates. These people travel to the other side of the Sea of Cortez by means of a tunnel. It is thought that when a Papago dies and is properly buried, his soul rejoins Fitoi inside his abode. No object or symbol in the wiigita refers to Christian practices. Similarly, the cult of San Francisco is free of any reference to indige- nous practices. Moreover, in his description of the wi:gita in Gu Achi, Steen was astonished to find no trace of Christianity (1987:319). The same situation prevails today at Quitovac, but this absence should not lead us to underestimate the particular functions of the Catholic religion. The avoidance of mutual reference should not mask a profound identity of intention. Both cults combine healing with the request for rain, and this affinity between the two devotions is explicit in actions. Thus, once the wirgita is finished, scores of Papagos travel to San Francisquito to effect a "promise" (promesa) before the statue of the saint. The combination of the two rituals manifests a desire to accumulate energy through the two figures, Montezuma and San Francisco. But what genealogical links unite those two supernaturals? Granted that if MontcxamaJFitoi has been assimilated with God (hus- band of the Virgin and father of Christ), then Montezuma's relation to San Francisco becomes imprecise. The two are kin to each other, proven by the fact that they have identical powers. The Papagos vouch for their Christianity primarily through the image of San Francisco, and the rest of their religious practice is rather peripheral to this cult. In fact, the problem of the cultural "purity" of the wi:gita is made all the more interesting by the Papagos5 attributing to San Francisco functions similar to Mon- tezuma. It is perhaps through this configuration that we can explain their attachment to this "Christianity of the Desert." Of Catholicism only a form is retained: a protective divine image on which are pro- jected preoccupations and uncertainties that have no place in Chris- tian history. Papagos make concessions to Christianity only to the extent that it meets their therapeutic and meteorological concerns. Thus, the figure of San Francisco does not appear fundamentally</page><page sequence="48">Wi.nita Ritual * 533 different from that of Montezuma in regard to environmental inter- ventions. This saint overshadows the rest of the Christian pantheon, and only the virgin of Guadalupe also receives particular devotions from the Papago. There was a chapel consecrated to her at Quitovac, but when it collapsed, no one repaired it. The images from this chapel were transferred to a private house. Since 1988, a disused private house, transformed into a chapel, again shelters this saint. Before the saint's September 12 feast day, the image is transported on a frame from house to house by two young girls. From the first to the twelfth of September it stays in a different house every night. Pilgrimage to the principal sanctuary of Guadalupe at Tepeyac, in Mexico City is not considered to be important. Besides the feast of Saint Joseph, unobtrusively honored at Quitovac, and the feast of the Sacred Cross (May 3), only the feast of St. John receives special attention. This latter was observed by horseraces in which the object was to snatch the head of a rooster that was buried in the ground (an expression of a widespread Spanish-American custom of ritual chicken decapitation). The St. John feast also featured a game of gomi, that is, a race to kick a wooden ball from the Hill of Quitovac to the wi:gita ground. (Although such races have religious import elsewhere in the American Indian Southwest, nothing of that was remembered at Quitovac.) Velarde's "First Relation" of the Upper Pimas, in the seventeenth century, mentions an identical ritual called xhcguagu mari. Obviously, one notes the analogy to the final race at the deer-killing ritual, discussed earlier, but no informant has stated that xhcjjomi race has a similar ideological background. (At Sonoyta, as has been described, the deer ritual was celebrated on the feast day of St. John.) To understand the fundamental differences between San Francisco and Montezuma, we must return to the latter's position in the Papago pantheon. This raises a historical problem that reaches from the Pueblos to the central Mexican plateau. In the Quitovac tradition there is a dominant idea, also present among the Pueblos, of a re- demptive hero. According to a version collected in the late nineteenth century, Montezuma is opposed to the Great Spirit who in the end makes Montezuma disappear through an alliance with the Spanish (Parmentier 1979:621). This account recalls Pueblo myths which as- sign to Montezuma the role of a historical leader for a tribal migra- tion, a theme that has disappeared from Quitovac. A version pub- lished by Dumarest in 1919 is closer to the local belief, since it in-</page><page sequence="49">534 * Journal of the Southwest eludes a resurrection. This myth also mentions a giant and a bird that ate men (Parmentier 1979:621). Curiously, while evoking Pueblo themes, such as the notion of a world in equilibrium and the teaching of humans, the Quitovac Montezuma is different because of his participation in the complex figure of "God." Following Spicer's notion of "compartmentaliza- tion," which rigorously separates the Native from the Spanish, Par- mentier suggests that Montezuma is the point of contact and hence of conflict between Pueblo religion and Spanish Christianity (1979: 619). It is different among the Papagos who use the word "God" to designate a distinct semantic field. At Quitovac the assimilation of God and Montezuma is widely acknowledged. It even includes the heart of the monster killed by the hero. Even more troubling is the fact that the term tiosh, the Papago variant of dios^ designates the royal eagle, one of the central divinities of the wi:gita. The enigma disappears when we recall the existence of the sun as a mediating figure: both powers merge with the sun. The two crowning figures of the Papago pantheon, Montezuma and San Francisco, have the interchangeable attributes of curing and weather control. In contrast to the Pueblo rendition, they are neither in conflict nor completely separate. Their interchangeability extends to pathology. Thus, images of San Francisco brought back from pil- grimages must be purified, lest their owners be afflicted by "Saint sickness" (Bahr 1983:199). The nativization of San Francisco is evi- dent in the saint's portrayal as a capable technician serving people's personal preoccupations, while at the same time, he represents the Catholic church. For his part, Montezuma occupies a position of leadership. He defines a modus opemndi on the basis of which the world can be maintained in balance, especially through the wi:gita. Thus, the Papago religious system appears today to be entirely domi- nated by this entwining of the symbolic configurations of Monte- zuma and San Francisco. Through this, Christianity and the native religion undergo a complex process of substitution of status and function. CONCLUSION A precious relic of a drifting cultural tradition, the wi:gita of Quitovac offers a dramatic view into the major preoccupations of the</page><page sequence="50">Wt:gita Ritual * 535 hunting and gathering cultures of the American Southwest. To these preoccupations the wi:gita brought a global solution, indicating how to treat biological illness, to guarantee success in hunting, and to regulate the rain. This was accomplished by the formation of a sacrificial logic according to which death gives birth to life. Old Papagos, scattered in the immensity of the Sonoran Desert, still find identity and faith at Quitovac. Not without pain, they try to maintain the fundamentals of their belief by involving the young, who are poorly motivated because they have been absorbed into the American culture of consumption. Bahr notes that the imposition of the modern calendar, with its division between workdays and weekends, is a further factor in the secularization and waning of the wi:gita. The ceremony is pushed to the periphery of the week, where it maintains itself with difficulty (1988^:166). Moreover, the parti- tioning of Papago territory between the United States and Mexico decentralizes the wiigita, since it is currently organized by people who live north of the international border. For their part, the inhabi- tants of Quitovac struggle to reconstitute a lost language and reli- gious patrimony. Thus, the sheer act of maintaining the wiigita at Quitovac brings about new duties and power relationships which challenge the future of a ritual caught between the demands of native and Catholic tradi- tions. Two heroic figures symbolize that double constraint: Mon- tezuma, lord of the wi:gita, guide to the intimate, the secrets, and the native lore; and San Francisco, patron of the public religion and protector of a faith without which the world would return to the chaos of its origin. * REFERENCES Bahr, Donald 1975 Pima and Papago Ritual Oratory- A Study of Three Texts.
