WILBUR SCOTT* United States Air Force Academy DAVID MCCONE United States Air Force Academy GEORGE R. MASTROIANNI United States Air Force Academy U.S. soldiers deploying to Iraq in 2003 were told that the war was necessary to rid Saddam Hussein of weapons of mass destruction and had expected to fight a near-peer enemy using conventional tactics. Instead, they encountered a very different battlefield and, to date, no weapons of mass destruction have been found. This paper focuses on this apparent violation of soldiers* expectations. We analyze oral histories collected from two units of Ft. Carson-based soldiers who served in Iraq during 2003-2004 and were on the verge of redeployment in 2005. Our findings suggest that soldiers maintained a high level of commitment to their units and the Army. We offer an explanation of the factors at work in maintaining commitment under disconnects between expectations and realities and speculate about the application of them to full-spectrum warfare. *Please direct all correspondence to Prof. Wilbur Scott, Department of Behavioral Sciences &amp; Leadership, DFBL, Fairchild Hall, 6L101-B, United States Air Force Academy, USAFA, Colorado 80840; Wilbur.Scott@usafa.af.mil 301</page><page sequence="2">302 SOCIOLOGICAL FOCUS During the Second World War, social scientists of various stripes interviewed soldiers in the field (Stouffer et al. 1949), conducted focus groups with soldiers recently returned from combat, and collected oral histories from them (Marshall et al. 1946; Marshall 1947). These classic studies sought not only to document what took place within the combat zone, but to analyze patterns and contingencies and, ultimately, to produce theoretical schemes to account for them. Recent research by Wong (2004; 2005) and Ender (2005a; 2005b) extends this tradition to soldiers in Iraq. Wong's analyses emphasize the complexity of what some term Fourth-Generation Warfare (Lind et al. 1989; Lind 2004) - war in which at least one of the sides is a military force not organized and controlled by a nation-state - and the corresponding requirement for U.S. military personnel to perform multiple roles and tasks, often ones for which they were neither socialized nor trained. In this paper, we describe and address some key features of these complexities, focusing on the "psychological contracts" soldiers form with their units and the military. PSYCHOLOGICAL CONTRACTS AND MILITARY UNITS In the fall of 2004, the authors had the opportunity to collect oral histories from soldiers assigned to the 3rd Armored Cavalry Regiment (hereafter, 3rd ACR) and the 3rd Brigade Combat Team, 4th Infantry Division (hereafter, 4th ID) stationed at Ft. Carson, Colorado. As its name suggests, the 3rd ACR is a highly mobile reconnaissance unit of approximately 5,200 soldiers equipped with more than 320 armored vehicles and 80 aircraft. In a conventional war against a "near peer" enemy, the 3rd ACR's job would be to advance forward of friendly mechanized infantry and armor divisions in search of enemy units and armor. The 3rd ACR expected to perform a mission of this sort against the Iraqi Army in OIF. However, by the time it crossed the border from Kuwait into Iraq in April of 2003, the 3rd Infantry and 1st Marine Divisions had already captured Baghdad and the Iraqi Army had collapsed. The 4th ID is an example of one of the mechanized infantry units referred to in the preceding paragraph. Its roughly 4,000 soldiers are distributed across two infantry battalions equipped with tanks and Bradley fighting vehicles and other assorted units. Like the 3rd ACR, the 4th ID expected to engage the Iraqi Army's armored units. Originally, the 4th ID was to enter Iraq from the north, crossing the border from Turkey. However, in March of 2003, the Turkish government rescinded permission to use this route. By the time 4th ID vehicles - loaded on ships off the Turkish coast and awaiting final permission to come ashore - were rerouted and unloaded in Kuwait, the fighting war they had expected had largely ended. In short, both units expected to fight, as the soldiers say, "tank on tank." What they encountered instead was a very different battlefield with varied missions. Further, the rationale provided by the President and his associates for the invasion of Iraq centered around claims that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction and was in a position to use them. While the pre-emptive strike by US. forces did topple Saddam's government, later resulting in his capture, to date no weapons of mass destruction have been found. Hence, a central theme in our inquiry is the apparent violation of soldiers' expectations in terms of both the rationale for the war and the type of war they would be fighting in Iraq.</page><page sequence="3">PSYCHOLOGICAL CONTRACTS IN TWO COMBAT UNITS IN IRAQ 303 In such circumstances, the rubric of social exchange theory provides direction on how soldiers might subsequently view their immediate unit, the Army, or even the civilian government. Organizational support theory (OST), represented in the works of Eisenberger and his associates (Eisenberger et al. 1990; Eisenberger et al. 2001; Rhoades and Eisenberger, 2002; Aselage and Eisenberger 2003), and psychological contract theory (PCT), articulated by Denise Rousseau (1995; 2001), are two main variants of the social exchange paradigm. OST posits that members form "globalized beliefs" about the extent to which the organization "cares about them" and, in cases where they feel valued, repay the organization with high levels of commitment and performance. PCT emphasizes members' perceptions of things the organization expects them to do in return for the goods and benefits they receive, material and otherwise. Thompson and Bunderson's (2003) ideological currency (ICT) theory adds a further refinement - organizational members often are motivated to serve rather selflessly because of commitment to a cause. The nature of this "contract" between person and organization always is in the mind of the beholder. All these theories have an interest in what happens when, in the eyes of its members, the organization fails to deliver as expected. Generally, they predict that organizational breaches of contract produce dissatisfaction and declining performance, i.e., members' commitment and efforts rise and fall in response to perceptions that the organization is reciprocating with desired goods and benefits. As indicated above, these goods and services are not restricted to the material - they might include a range of potent socio-emotional, personal, and ideological motivators. Further, research findings make clear that organizational members with different types of psychological contracts react differently to violation. Indeed, in the case of military service in a war zone, the latter three motivators may be dominant. However, approaching our interviews, we did not know specifically what these might consist of for soldiers at Ft. Carson. Hence, our general approach to studying their experiences was drawn from the grounded-theorizing perspective articulated first by Glaser and Strauss (1967) jointly, with more recent updates by Strauss (1987) and Glaser (1992) separately. Common to all its usages is an iterative posture of allowing an interplay between theoretical thinking and data collection/ analysis. Our approach therefore called for us to allow our respondents to articulate these experiences in their own words as a way of guiding us toward deriving meaningful generalizations. SAMPLE AND METHODS The authors conducted the interviews for this study as part of a larger service project at Ft. Carson, Project Enduring Memory (PEM). The end purpose of PEM is to create commemorative videos of Ft. Carson-based soldiers who died in Iraq.1 PEM invited Ft. Carson soldiers who had served in the immediate units of deceased soldiers to recount their memories in videotaped sessions. Soldiers who volunteered to contribute to these memorial videos also were invited to do oral-history interviews. In the fall of 2004, 168 Ft. Carson soldiers took part in PEM, and most consented to both memorial video and oral history interviews. Some, however, did only memorial-video interviews, and a smaller number came in only for the oral-history interview. Of the 122 oral-history interviews, 64 are available to us at this time.</page><page sequence="4">304 SOCIOLOGICAL FOCUS Of course, our self-selected sample of soldiers is not statistically representative of those from Ft. Carson, much less the totality of soldiers who served in Iraq. Nonetheless, there is an especially strong substantive reason for using this sample. These soldiers not only served in Iraq in combat units, but also lost close comrades to injury and death. Hence, the questions we raise pertinent to psychological contracts with their units and the U.S. Army would seem especially relevant in studying these respondents. We developed an open-ended, semi-structured interview using as a guide the U.S. Army Institute of Military History questionnaire for collecting oral histories from veterans. We modified some questions to make them relevant for respondents on active duty and also added items to tap expectations and perceptions of the battlefield in Iraq. As we began to detect themes in the course of the interview sessions, we expanded the interview to pursue these topics more fully. Oral history interviews lasted between 45 minutes and two hours, depending upon the inclination of the respondent. Interviews were recorded on both audio- and videotape.2 We analyzed the transcriptions of the interviews using the software program, NVivo (Gibbs, 2002).3 In presenting the findings we enumerate "mentions," i.e., opinions expressed about an issue. The number of mentions often exceeds the number of respondents because a soldier could express more than one opinion about an issue.4 We also present verbatim snippets from the interviews to illustrate and flesh out the empirical basis for each category of mentions. Our analysis focuses on the following issues: 1) why the soldiers joined the military, 2) the effect of 9/11 on soldiers' decisions to join or remain in the service, 3) soldiers' perceptions of why the U.S. is involved militarily in Iraq, and 4) similarities and differences between what soldiers thought they would be doing in Iraq and what they actually experienced. Why Join the Military? Rousseau (2001: 515-519) has argued that an accounting of psychological contracts should begin with pre-employment experiences and expectations. Hence, it is important to know something about why our respondents joined the Army in the first place. Reflections on this question should provide insight into the first set of expectations of FINDINGS Table 1 Why in Military, Mentions by Rank Officer NCO Enlisted Adventure, mil. life style Family history Serve country Utilitarian concerns 15 18 9 41 11% 22% 20% 47% 27% 22% 5% 46% 10% 20% 10% 60% 18% 21% 12% 49% 83 100% 100% 100% 100%</page><page sequence="5">PSYCHOLOGICAL CONTRACTS IN TWO COMBAT UNITS IN IRAQ 305 what military service might consist of and in the future. Table 1 contains the categories of reasons given for signing up for military service. The modal response category, irrespective of rank, is that of "utilitarian considerations." Just under half of the officers and noncommissioned officers - NCOs, in popular parlance, sergeants - give such a reason (47% and 46%, respectively), while 60% of the enlisted (lower-ranking) soldiers cite such a consideration. Typical among the reasons given are the desire to pay for schooling, stabilize an otherwise bleak job outlook, or to acquire a different set of occupational skills. For example, the following is representative of the accounts given by a number of enlisted soldiers: "I was working construction and I had gotten [laid off]. I...went to go stay with my mom, [was] cleaning out my wallet and seen I still had my recruiter's card in there. Gave him a call and pretty much just enlisted." Similarly, an NCO who had decided to make the Army a career stated: At the time I think I was more worried [about] providing for my family more than anything else, and, I mean, I was married for a little over a year and just had a daughter and mainly just wanted to make ends meet. The military is one of the most secure jobs that you can get, so to speak. Finally, an officer stated: [II originally enlisted for the college benefits. At the time I was coming out of high school I wanted to go to college, but my family wouldn't have been able to support me. I would have had to get a lot of loans. So I thought, go into the Army for a few years and earn some money. And then it just worked, worked out that I got accepted into the United States Military Academy. So my goal of me going to college was attained. Among the remaining response categories, adventure and the lure of the military life-style is cited most frequently by NCOs (27%), while about equal percentages noted a family history of military service (about 20%). Finally, about 20% of the officers give "to serve our country" as the primary consideration; the corresponding percentages for NCOs and enlisted soldiers are 5% and 10%, respectively. This, of course, does not mean that the notion of service is unimportant among most of our respondents. The findings, however, do point to the crucial role played by occupational and monetary opportunities in coloring pre-employment expectations. Many commentators are concerned that these material incentives might hold up in peacetime but attenuate psychological contracts in time of war. For example, it is possible that a person might have signed up for military service prior to 9/11 in anticipation of college benefits and then encountered unexpected deployments to a war zone. Conversely, others might have signed up or remained in the service precisely because of a desire to serve in time of war. In other words, Thompson and Bunderson's (2003) ICT theory would seem tailor-made to address motivations for military service in time of war. Hence, we asked respondents to reflect upon whether the events on September 11,2001, had any effect on their decision toj?in or to remain in the military. Between two-thirds to three-fourths of the soldiers said that the events of 9/11 had either a profound or extenuating impact upon their thinking (see Table 2). For example, an enlisted soldier summarized his reaction: Well, (Joining the military] was something I had been thinking about for awhile and then September 11th came along. That really kinda pushed me, tike, my mindset more towards, hey, you know, maybe, I should go on and do my part And so now here I am.</page><page sequence="6">306 SOCIOLOGICAL FOCUS Table 2 Effect of 9/11 on Being in Military, Mentions by Rank Officer NCO Enlisted Profound effect Some effect No effect 18 27 14 44% 28% 28% 26% 56% 18% 21% 50% 29% 31% 46% 23% 59 100% 100% 100% 100% An officer recounted it this way: Absolutely. I remember the morning it happened. I was actually at Fort Leavenworth?.. I was eating breakfast when we watched the first plane, you know, they had the big screen TV in there. And we watched everything happen right there. And...all of us pretty much knew at that moment...there was no doubt we were probably going to go to war. So, yes, it did have a pretty profound effect on me. Among those who commented that 9/11 had no effect on their being in the military, the common theme was that they already were committed to the military and ready to serve whatever occurred. Taken together, these accounts point to the role of both monetary and ideological considerations in forming the decision to join or remain in the military. The financial inducements for enlisting in the All-Volunteer Force military are considerable, especially in comparison to the scant salaries and bonuses associated with a draft-based military. However, service in time of war also incurs a willingness to risk one's life in service to the country, a dangerous proposition for which it is difficult to provide adequate monetary inducements, especially among potential service members strongly motivated by a cost-risk-benefit analysis. In any case, these are "computations'' that organizational members make for themselves. Why is the U.&amp; in Iraq? As noted above, organizational support theory (OST) posits that members form globalized beliefs about the organization and their place and role within it, a strikingly anthropomorphic process. Aselage and Eisenberger (2003: 492-493), for instance, note the tendency of members to assign almost "humanlike'' characteristics to the organization and their relationship to it. Included, therefore, in these globalized beliefs are notions about whether the organization utilizes them properly, treats them fairly, values their contributions, cares about their well-being, etc. For soldiers in a war zone, this includes a range of issues from "why are we here?" to "are we properly trained and equipped?" to "are our personal and family needs being taken care of?"; we address these issues below and in subsequent sections. Table 3 summarizes the categories of mentions for U.S. military involvement in Iraq. The most commonly expressed reason for U.S. military action is "to remove Saddam from power," closely followed by "to fight terrorism" and "to find weapons of</page><page sequence="7">PSYCHOLOGICAL CONTRACTS IN TWO COMBAT UNITS IN IRAQ 307 mass destruction." These opinions account for just over three-fourths of the stated reasons, but vary by rank. Among NCOs, there was a clear modal category (45%): to get Saddam. The words of one NCO are typical: "I thought, and I still think today, that the guy who was in power needed to go. Um, I don't care what the politicians Isayl, they're gonna give us reasons to do whatever they want. But, bottom line is to me, Saddam needed to go. That's fine." The patterns were more varied for officers and enlisted-rank soldiers. Still, a focus on Saddam Hussein predominated as a prime reason for military action. For example, Table 3 Why Militarily Involved in Iraq, Mentions by Rank Officer NCO Enlisted Bring stability to region 6 6% 5% 8% 6% FindWMD 23 30% 13% 28% 24% Following orders 12 6% 16% 16% 12% Remove Saddam 32 25% 45% 24% 32% War on terrorism 26 33% 21% 24% 26% 99 100% 100% 100% 100% one officer stated: "I believe that, you know, history has shown that Saddam Hussein and his regime were bad for the world and bad for the U.S., bad for stability.... It's a good thing to have stopped him." Similarly, an enlisted soldier commented: "Well, I'd like to say that if Saddam Hussein wasn't taken out of power, that I would definitely every day think about, you know, how vulnerable and whatnot we'd be." More officers and enlisted ranks than the NCOs, many soldiers linked military involvement in Iraq to the search for weapons of mass destruction and to the larger war on terrorism. In the words of one officer: Well, you know, there was the weapons of mass destruction, but I always thought we were just, it was a larger part of the global war on terrorism, because I just figured, you go in there and clean up that and move on to somewhere else. We just haven't left yet. Several soldiers tempered considerations leading to U.S. intervention in Iraq with caution. One officer noted wryly: "Hindsight is 20/20. At that time, we believed they had weapons of mass destruction." Another officer qualified his position with the observation, "I don't necessarily put Iraq with 9/11, but I can definitely understand the President's reasoning following that, 'cause, [I] wouldn't have wanted to be in his shoes and risk another 9/11 with the intelligence he was given." Finally, another officer offered the following assessment: Um, I did agree with weapons of mass destruction. And I don't know if I can give my full support to some of the other reasons, just because if you want to use the human suffering argument, you could look at a place ?ke Africa where true human suffering is.... If you want to use that argument, then, you know, we should probably be in the Sudan right now.</page><page sequence="8">308 SOCIOLOGICAL FOCUS Finally, a small percentage of respondents did not articulate a rationale for military involvement in Iraq. A solider remarked, "Honestly, I have never really thought about it. To me, it was just, we got orders to go over and that was it." In a similar vein, an NCO succinctly stated, "I was, well, I'm in the military. I do what I'm told, so I don't really question it too much. Fm not a diplomat, you know." What happened once in Iraq? As indicated above, the situation on the ground in Iraq changed quite dramatically by the time the 3rd ACR and 4th ID arrived in Iraq, unloaded their tracks and other vehicles, formed up, and moved across the berm from Kuwait toward Baghdad. The tank-on tank battles they had expected had vanished. What do the soldiers themselves have to say about what took place next? Table 4 Expectations vs. Realities, Mentions by Rank Officer NCO Enlisted Different than expected job situation mission/tactics people/culture other situations Things as expected 27 68 13 14 25 148 26% 43% 13% 3% 15% 100% 15% 52% 5% 9% 19% 100% 11% 36% 11% 21% 21% 100% 18% 46% 9% 9% 18% 100% Mission shift. Table 4 contains a summary of "iP and "how" the realities differed from what they expected. About half of all mentions express the position that the mission and tactics were quite different from expected (46%). This percentage was slightly higher for NCOs (52%) and slightly lower for enlisted soldiers (36%). Several respondents noted specifically that the type of war they expected disappeared before the 3rd ACR and 4th ID got there and into position. An officer in the 4th ID stated somewhat wistfully: [AJctually when we were flying over, we stopped in Germany and saw on television that the 3rd Infantry Division was pushing into Baghdad. So we initially thought our mission was going to be, continue to fight, and probably just pick up where they left off.... But at that point we [found] the war was pretty much over. We were kinda disappointed actually. Similarly, an NCO in the 3rd ACR commented: "The unit's mission, well, of course, you know, actually it changed. It kind of flip-flopped, 'cause initially it was, okay, we're going in to fight the enemy. Well, initially, there was no enemy to fight." Soon, however, there was plenty to do. In the words of an enlisted soldier in the 4th ID: "Well, I'd say, you know, we were an on-task type of [mechanized infantry] company..., you know, when you got trouble in Samarra, let's go! You know, and then we just kept on moving and moving." What ensued was a kind of urban, guerrilla warfare which, though not totally foreign to armored cavalry and mechanized infantry units,</page><page sequence="9">PSYCHOLOGICAL CONTRACTS IN TWO COMBAT UNITS IN IRAQ 309 nevertheless called for considerable adjustment and adaptability on their part. A 3rd ACR officer explained: The regiment normally is the eyes and ears of the Third Corps in a major high-intensity conflict role. We tended at the time to focus on that versus dismounted operations in the city. We're just not equipped for [the latter! and that wasn't the intent behind our formation. But as all the units [quickly] figured out, you gotta be more flexible and have a broader range of base skills, so. But what did these operations consist of? Though there were some important variations by unit, area of operation, and periods during the deployment, there were many similar components of what are called "stability operations." An NCO in the 3rd ACR summarized stability operations in this way: Basically, just keep the roads clear from BEDs [improvised explosive devices], land mines, and make sure that there was peace, urn, confiscate weapons. Basically, do the same thing a police department does. You know, just make sure everything is in order and, of course, you know, to do some raids in houses and shake down what we could, confiscate [weapons], and try to eliminate the bad people and put the fear in them. We did a pretty good job of that. An important part of performing these and other tasks is setting foot on the ground. For tankers and for scouts in Bradley fighting vehicles, this meant dismounting, i.e., climbing down out of those well-protected armored vehicles during potentially hostile situations, something they are neither inclined nor trained to do. As an NCO in the 4th ID explained: Once, once we got over there and there was no real tank threat as far as like tank battles and stuff, ...we had...dismounted [missions], . . . what else, a lot of raids, you know, something we normally support for. .. [Y]ou know, we're not used to dismounting.... So that was a lot, that was different! Similarly another 4th ID NCO stated: "We started to get into the dismounted infantry tactics. We're tankers, you know, we don't ever really get off our tanks. At least that's the old mentality. That's changed now." Yet another 4th ID NCO, this one in a mechanized infantry outfit, cautioned: With mechanized.. .training [you get ready] to go up against other [tanks] and stuff like that. And then when we got there and it didn't happen, it was kind of more like being a police officer and stuff like that And really, you know, infantry ain't, you know, too good as police officers. You know, [we're] not trained for that. If mission shift and changing operations were a stretch for scouts and infantrymen, it could be even more challenging for artillerymen, engineers, and support personnel who were at times converted into infantry or dismounts. A 3rd ACR-artillery NCO described the conversion: Urn, well I was expecting to do a hell of a lot more of artillery work, which we were proficient at, so. ...[W]hen we went out there we had to do, like, TCPs (traffic control points), raids and stuff like that You know, things we weren't really trained for, but of course, we adjusted to it</page><page sequence="10">310 SOCIOLOGICAL FOCUS An enlisted soldier in the 4th ID described the role conflict this could produce: It turned out to be a lot different than everybody expected. Being in field artillery, you expected to shoot a lot of rounds and we shot some but not near as much as we thought. ...[W]e were kind of, like, I would say MPs (military police) after a while. Some of us dealt with it pretty well. Some of us didn't, just because of the stress. Didn't want to do it out of, I suppose, fear. Some of [usi didn't really care one way or the other. And, for some, including those in support roles, infantry duties supplemented their usual work, a common occurrence during combat operations. Adaptation to mission shift. These quotes suggest another theme that runs consistently through the comments on expectations: though a significant shift in mission often called for soldiers to do many things they had not counted on doing or had not been trained to do, the soldiers by-and-large felt they made effective adjustments to these demands. The comments of this NCO are typical: What we ended up doing was totally different from what...we trained, [sol what we did.. .was on-the-job training. I mean, ...we had to dig out the manuals and make sure we were doing it right to standard and then apply it and learn it as we went. ...I think we did an excellent job. Similarly, an officer explained how adjustments were made in his unit: And my platoon sergeant was a very experienced NCO, and I was able to rely on him to train our guys how to do room clearing and some urban operations and things just from his own expertise [in Bosnia and Kosovo], so. We were able to prepare the guys in the platoon a little bit better than they otherwise would have been. Finally, several of the soldiers noted that the mission-shift necessitated an emphasis on training while in Iraq. In the words of one NCO: We trained and we'd come up with a plan and we'd practice. We'd have lots of rehearsals to where it was just like we just knew off the back of our hand [what to do]. Just leadership, plain and simple. I mean, I can't really say it much better. Other expectation-reality gaps. Several other trends in Table 4 are worth noting. Officers, more so than NCOs and enlisted ranks (26%, 15%, and 11% of mentions, respectively), reported that the job situation they encountered in Iraq was different from what they had expected. For officers, there were often rotations between staff and line positions, and line positions?being the leader or commander of a platoon, squadron, or company?-were highly coveted. Hence, officers in staff positions at the time of deployment typically were anxious, particularly if there were some delay in receiving a line assignment. For example, a lieutenant in the 4th ID stated remorsefully: "But my expectation was that... I would go over there, be a platoon leader. That obviously didn't happen. I didn't get a platoon until [we were back at Ft. Carsonl ." Enlisted soldiers would not have rotated between staff and line positions - typical changes in position for them would have been moving from driver to gunner, often in the same armored vehicle. Among the enlisted ranks, the most frequent mentions other than mission/tactics address "other situations" (21% vs. 3% and 9% for officers and NCOs), i.e., observations about day-to-day conditions, especially the climate. An enlisted-rank soldier described his first few days in Iraq: "I mean, it was, like, hot! It was like 120 degrees when we got there. And when you're wearing, like, all your gear .. .it was overwhelming. Bugs, were bad ,.. sand, so it was tough. But, you know, you learn to adapt." Similarly, an officer</page><page sequence="11">PSYCHOLOGICAL CONTRACTS IN TWO COMBAT UNITS IN IRAQ 311 said of the heat: "[Y]ou really can't explain how hot that is. You, you just can't. It's [as] if someone were to open the oven and that blast of heat that you get, that's what's like all day long." Intense heat and gritty sand created special problems for maintaining and repairing armored vehicles. A maintenance NCO recalled an instance working on a tank's engine: "I remember doing tank services..., which is pulling the engine out and running [it] and setting [it] back in, and it was 140-something degrees! Well, you gotta alternate your people in and out, get H20 in 'em, keep 'em hydrated. [And] you had to wear gloves!" Finally, officers and enlisted soldiers were more likely than NCOs to comment on the differences in the people and culture (13% and 11% vs. 5%). We also should note that about one in five of the respondents (18%) found things to be pretty much as they expected. This position, however, usually was tempered by the observation that the respondent had expected things to be "different than expected." As one soldier stated, "Flexibility is my MOS (military occupational specialty)!" Personal and family needs. Mission considerations aside, few things can more directly challenge the soldiers' globalized beliefs about the extent the organization cares than the failure to address personal and family considerations. Across the board, the soldiers report satisfaction with the efforts and results of both the 3rd ACR and the 4th ID in this area. For starters, these Ft. Carson soldiers assumed that some sort of deployment to the Middle East was inevitable for them after 9/11 - it simply was a matter of when and where. In anticipation of deployment to Iraq, both units had activated plans to get soldiers' personal, financial, and family affairs "squared away," known formally as the Soldier Readiness Program (SRP). One NCO commented: We had plenty of time from the time we were notified. They kept putting off [our deployment date], so. Urn, plus we had to go through SRP, making sure we had powers of attorneys, and wills and all that stuff for our family. And we had a chance to sit down with a chaplain (and other counselors) and talk over problems and stuff. Nonetheless, there were important differences among the soldiers in direct experiences with deployment. The officers and NCOs who had been around for awhile had deployed before and some already had a routine for handling this eventuality. For example, a highly seasoned NCO stated: My wife, she's a pretty good military wife, like 'cause we'd been in the military a while by the time Iraq came up, so. She takes care of everything usually already, so all I had to really do was make sure she had a power of attorney...[S]he's pretty good at it. For others, it was their first deployment. If married, decisions had to be made if the spouse would remain in the Ft. Carson area or return home to be closer to relatives. For those not married or without partners, household goods and automobiles had to be placed in storage. For single parents, childcare arrangements - usually involving their parents or a sibling who would assume temporary custody - had to be finalized. Finally, in some cases, both wife and husband were in the Army and were deploying to Iraq, either with the 3rd ACR or 4th ID or with other units. For example, one officer in the latter group described his family situation: Well, my wife is also a Captain and she also deployed. So, we had my mother-in-law, we had given her power of attorney. I was definitely happy about that part of it. But I worried a lot [in Iraq] 'cause I knew [my wife] was out on the same roads that I was out on moving around. She was company commander at the same time [I was], so I knew she had to be out there, you know, checking on her soldiers and those things.</page><page sequence="12">312 SOCIOLOGICAL FOCUS In Iraq, the two units made special efforts to provide connections with loved ones at home. As operating bases became more formally established, it became possible for soldiers to call home by phone and to set up e-mail connections. These opportunities were unevenly distributed - some could use them daily, others only weekly or once a month - and were widely available only toward the end of the 12-month deployment to Iraq. Also, both units were able to implement mid-tour leave programs in which a certain number of soldiers were able to come home for a week around the sixth or seventh month of the tour. Priority was given to soldiers with families. Ft. Carson also had a Family Readiness Group (FRG) in place, staffed mainly by spouses of deployed soldiers, whose task it was to monitor problems families might be having while the two units were in Iraq. This does not mean that the time in Iraq did not cause significant personal and family disruptions. Yearlong separations strain any family. Several soldiers recounted instances of family problems, divorce, or adjustment problems by their children. Further, instant communication from the war zone to the home front had some downsides. For example, in the event of a casualty, telephone or e-mail could deliver the bad news instantly but informally - a spouse could learn of a casualty through the grapevine before any official word had arrived. Units, therefore, often shut down e-mail operations immediately following a casualty to allow time for word to be delivered officially to the family at home. Consequently, e-mail shut-downs due to technical or other reasons sent Shockwaves of concern through family communities back home. Finally, by most accounts, the homecoming to Ft. Carson was efficiently and effectively handled. One NCO commented: "I think it was the neatest experience coming into the Special Events Center and, you know, everybody there screaming and hollering and you're just standing there. So it was a pretty great feeling." Another recalled: "When we walked into the Special Events Center, it was just, it was like being in a football game and, you know, it was like one second left and a guy throws a touchdown that's 100 yards long that's completely unexpected and you're the winning team. That's what it was like." Of course, this euphoria quickly gave way to the realities of a readjustment period for both soldiers and their loved ones. One officer described the situation this way: You don't comprehend what people back here have been through and they don't comprehend what you've been through when you're over there.... And so you try to do this, like, instant download of everything and it, it just doesn't work. It's such a slow process.... As a result, Ft. Carson provided a range of classes and programs to ease the readjustment process. These included orientations in what issues and symptoms to expect during this time and specialized help in family dynamics, financial management, and grief counseling. Some of these were mandatory, while others were optional. Commenting upon the overall effort, one NCO concluded: At first you're just, like, oh man, this is bunk, this is ridiculous, I don't need this. But then after I sat there and listened to it, I actually talked to my wife about it and we attended other classes after that. So, I think it's been great, it's been awesome, I don't think they have overlooked anything. No matter what the soldier needs, there is a program out there to help them, no matter what.</page><page sequence="13">PSYCHOLOGICAL CONTRACTS IN TWO COMBAT UNITS IN IRAQ DISCUSSION 313 The tone and content of the findings detailed above suggest that soldiers in the 3nl ACR and 4th ID maintained a high level of commitment to their units and the Army as an institution during their deployment to Iraq and thereafter. This observation invites some analysis and explanation of the factors at work in maintaining such commitment under challenging conditions, and with frequent apparent disconnects between expectations and realities. A dynamic underlying the three social exchange theories cited here - Organizational Support Theory (OST), Psychological Contract Theory (PCT), and Ideological Currency Theory (ICT) - is the norm of reciprocity. This principle states that organizational members are motivated to pursue organizational goals when there is a match between members' expectations and organizational rewards. OST and PCT differ in emphasis, but share a common focus on perceptions by members of the contributions they make to the organization in comparison to derived rewards and benefits, both material and relational. The contribution of ICT lies in its specific emphasis on devotion to a cause as a specific motivator of performance within an organization. While these theories have been subjected to empirical test in civilian employment settings, we can speculate on their application to military situations in combat. In the era of the Second World War, Stouffer (1949) and Marshall (1946:1947) caused quite a stir with their research-based claims that, in the final analysis, soldiers fight and die for each other rather than for their country. Since then, other military sociologists have reinforced the salience of patriotic sentiments in combat units (Moskos, 1970; 1976), while others have noted a convergence between civilian and military organizations in factors that motivate members since the advent of the All Volunteer Force (Segal and Segal 1984). As the soldiers quoted in the findings section reveal, soldiers in our two combat units are motivated by a range of considerations - financial, ideological, and relational.5 All three would seem to figure simultaneously into psychological contracts formed by soldiers, although the valences attached to each entry certainly would vary from soldier to soldier. The findings also show that these considerations vary consistently by rank, a pattern no doubt reflecting differences in career contingencies. For example, at the time of our interviews, re-enlistment bonuses for non-officers, depending upon a soldier's military specialty, could be as high as $40,000 for an additional commitment of four years. Officers, on the other hand, do not receive re-enlistment bonuses but were extended other career inducements to remain in the service, such as the opportunity to obtain an advanced degree at the Army's expense. Further, soldiers may look to different levels of their organizational hierarchy for different kinds of rewards in return for their service. For instance, unit leaders have little or no discretion in determining how much members are paid or what their general mission will be. We know from our oral histories that financial and larger ideological considerations provide important incentives for joining the military. Hence, the larger organization of the Army and civilian authorities that oversee the military may be seen as responsible for maintaining these rewards. The unit level therefore may be the prime source of socio-emotional or relational rewards and certain ideological incentives, e.g., commitment to others in the same unit (internal cohesion) and carrying out the mandates of one's chosen profession. Our findings also document that the mission, the tactical situation, job assignments, and other situations were at odds with what soldiers in these units had been led to</page><page sequence="14">314 SOCIOLOGICAL FOCUS expect. However, these observations frequently ended with phrases such as wbut we learned to adapt," "of course, we adjusted," or "somehow we made it happen," suggesting the presence of conditions that mediate the disconnect between expectation and reality and mitigate the effects. PCT, in particular, focuses on the consequences when an implicit contract is violated and offers a consideration that may mediate the likelihood of negative responses - the perception of why the breach has occurred. There are several possible perceptions:' that the organization deliberately acted in bad faith (reneging), that there was a misunderstanding of the contract's actual terms (incongruence), or, finally, that the breach occurred because of circumstances outside the control of the organization (disruption). If one considers this as a kind of continuum ranging from high to low "organizational fault," we would posit that a disconnect between expectation and reality leads to negative organizational outcomes only when there also is high organizational fault (see Figure 1). Figure 1 Negative Organizational Consequences by Disconnect between Expectations and Reality, under conditions of High and Low Perceived Organizational Fault Percehed Org Fault - H y-' y" Perceived Org Fault - Lo lo Expectations/Realities Disconnect hi o o S I In our data there is little evidence of perceived organizational fault, i.e., the opinion that the breach is attributable to factors within their unit's or the Army's control. The many changes in mission, tactical situations, and the like, represent for the most part things that, in the words of one soldier, "could [not] have been briefed prior...." Hence, soldiers seemed to have no feelings that they had been deceived, used, or ignored by the institution. The perception of low organizational fault also is consonant with the</page><page sequence="15">PSYCHOLOGICAL CONTRACTS IN TWO COMBAT UNITS IN IRAQ 315 general requirement for adaptability in military life, as reflected in maxims such as "SNAFU" (Situation Normal, All F#%$ed Up) or "adapt and overcome." Nonetheless, military units are configured and trained to do certain things and fight certain kinds of wars. As we have seen, the 3rd ACR and 4th ID are most suitably configured and trained to fight a near-peer in conventional tank-on-tank battles. However, the realities of the war in Iraq are much different and, indeed, have aroused a rethinking of warfare within the military. For example, a recent article by Maj. Gen. Peter Chiarelli, former commander, and Maj. Patrick Michaelis (2005), an operations officer, both in 1st Cavalry Division, reviewed the activities of Task Force Baghdad, a 39,000-soldier, 62-battalion force centered in and around Baghdad during 2004, of which they were a part. Their assessment stresses the necessity for what they call "full-spectrum" warfare, i.e., the simultaneous implementation of "lethal" combat operations and of "non-lethal" efforts such as infrastructure, community relations, and nation-building projects. The intention of full-spectrum warfare calls for the ordinary soldier to have a skill-set that extends far beyond combat operations. Chiarelli and Michaelis (2005:15) acknowledge that the Army's current "regulations, bureaucratic processes, staff relationships, and culture," while well-suited for lethal tasks, mitigate against carrying out the non-lethal dimensions of the equation effectively. As we have seen, soldiers and small-unit leaders have been forced to improvise on the spot in order to carry out any version of full-spectrum warfare in Iraq. To this point, they have done so largely without attributing fault to the organization for the dangers, stresses, and inconveniences this entails. However, as the war in Iraq grinds on and as units rotate to and from the war zone, the willingness by soldiers to accept the disconnect between expectation and reality stoically certainly will decline unless it is addressed more systematically through adjustments in organization and training. Given the strong internal cohesion of most combat units in today's Army, much of the potential negative organizational consequences may be directed against civilian authorities or the Army's higher echelons. This situation clearly would be exacerbated further by an ambiguous conclusion to the war that calls into question the utility of all the service and sacrifice. We hope that these truly ugly potential outcomes will be avoided. NOTES 1 During 2003-2004, 66 soldiers assigned or attached to the 3rd ACR and 4th ID died in Iraq, 47 of whom were based at Ft. Carson. Most of the 66, thirty-eight, were killed in action, i.e., died as a result of hostile action by the enemy. The remaining 28 died as the result of accidents while conducting military operations or of some other cause unrelated to military action. 2 Respondents were told that the audio-tapes would be transcribed for analysis and that both the audio- and video-tapes would be stored at the Mountain Post Historical Museum at Ft. Carson and would be available to the public under the Freedom of Information Act. Hence, respondents were advised that, though we would not use their names in our analyses, they should consider their responses neither anonymous nor confidential. Further, we told soldiers before beginning an interview that we were required to report</page><page sequence="16">316 SOCIOLOGICAL FOCUS any mention of mistreatment or killing of prisoners, sexual assault, or other serious violations of the Uniform Code of Military Justice. 3 NVivo is designed for the tasks specific to grounded-theorizing, i.e., it allows the analyst to tag, organize, and retrieve snippets of interview material on the basis of themes detected in the material. 4 The number of officers, noncommissioned officers (NGOs), and enlisted soldiers is proportionate in both units, and the number of soldiers in each of the two units is roughly proportionate. Hence, differences in our analysis by rank are not due to differences among them in unit composition. 5 Similarly, Kellett (1982) reviewed a range of motivations within combat units and was unable to pin down a single overriding consideration.
