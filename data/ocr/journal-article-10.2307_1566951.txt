This misses the issue completely: the value and relevance in the first place of Visual Order6 as a cultural system. In answer to secondary arguments on the manipulation of solids and voids, on the so-called priority of spaces and volumes versus the decoration or articulation of structure, on the rectilinear, on the curvilinear or on the organic,7 the "modern style"8 was created and considered the answer to the essential basic need of a human Kenneth E.

Given the fact that the Modern Style failed in a manner similar to all styles, we face a dilemma: to accept either that the system of Visual Order is relevant, and the environment we are producing is becoming more 3 5T 1 unpredictable and uncontrollable (3) (and thus potentially human-destructive); or that the frame of reference used in the first place has failed." In the latter case other systems may be available not only to shape the man- made environment but to guarantee its prohuman nature.2 In contrast to the belief that to abandon the Visual Order of physical objects results in a state of environmental laissez-faire, destructive- ness and the elimination of art as a human activity, an alternative can be proposed. The System of Visual Ordering had a special but limited use in the past. It is not only obsolete but in some respects an obstacle in the contemporary use of the environment and its organization. If we consider the uses rather than the manifestations of objects,'3 we find ourselves dealing with two parallel cultural systems instead of one. The System, to use the terms of Mary Douglas, of Visual Order is now joined by the System of Dirt and Purity.14 They shared the same use but they had a different environmental expression. They organized the exterior environment from very similar points of view. Studying the phenomenon of Dirt and Purity we observe first of all the classification of matter and then the rejecting of inappropriate elements'" from a defined territory of space, time, conduct, people or activities, together with the acceptance of appropriate ones. In the . -1 -- 1. - - . M- i 4- System of Visual Order (4) we observe the selection of appropriate three-dimensional interrelationships between elements of matter within territories which it defines. In both cases certain changes are applied to the exterior environment according to conceptual structures. From all the possible alternatives certain patterns of territorial continuity or 5 discontinuity are established (5), coupled by groups of properties which could be found within these and only these territories. With this physical transformation of the external world one can observe an internal psychological change of the human. Relieved from a state of anxiety and tension the human becomes satisfied and secure. The attempt to change physically the environment into a prohuman one is preceded by the conceptual humanization of the environment. It is the initial battle by the human being to relate an unfamiliar situation to a familiar one; to the most basic and universally familiar one, the psychological mastering as a preparation for physical mastering.' This humanization is more complex and abstract than simple anthropomorphism. In the roots of the "infantile model""'7 are not only the concrete 9Gyorgy Kepes, Language of Vision, Paul Theobald, Chicago, 1947, pp. 98, 107. '0Edward Sekler. The Function of Architectural Theory and Criticism," Architectural Design, Aug. 1968. 'In Prof. Kubler (George Kubler. The Shape of Time, Yale Univ. Press, New Haven. 1962) is envisaged a study of the history of art (including the System of Visual Order referred to here) which would contain "unexpected potentialities as a predictive science." But art considered within the system of visual order does not provide enough real continuity as a body or consistency as a process, in its use, for such a purpose. I2The function of a prohuman environment is dual: to assist human existence and to shape human behavior so that it does not threaten (directly or potentially) human existence. 13L. Wittgenstein. Lectures &amp; Conversations on Aesthetics, Psychology and Religious Belief, Cyril Barrett. ed.. U. of California Press, Los Angeles, 1967, pp. 8, 9. 14We apply the term "System", as in the case of the phenomenon of art, to indicate that visual patterns or works of art are not unique, isolated, individual events, but exist within 'a set of ordered relations and a contravention of that order," Mary Douglas, Purity and Danger, Frederick A. Praeger, N.Y., 1966, p. 35. SMary Douglas, op. cit., p. 35. '6Sigmund Freud. The Future of an Illusion, Doubleday &amp; Co., N.Y., 1927, p. 31. S 7bid., p. 31. 6L physical characteristics but the abstract behavioral characteristics as well: the basic internal principles of consistency and completeness.'" When internal principles of consistency and completeness are introjected into the exterior world,'9 they are translated into interrelationships of its elements (6). These are the structures we find in the System of Visual Order and in the System of Dirt and Purity. They involve: 1. the establishment of territories (kinds) of relative consistency and completeness 2. the establishment of their boundaries (in and out, prerequisite of expressing consistency and completeness) 3. the establishment of what is permitted and what is prohibited to enter those territories (manifestation of consistency and completeness) 4. relative or cross-boundary interrelationships and their properties creating over-all orders of consistency and completeness. Food prohibitions, decoration patterns, the removal of certain objects from a territory as dirt, shaping a wall in a certain geometrical configuration are actions that reduce the uncertainty and fear of mixing and confusion.20 Visual Order and Dirt and Purity are environmental controls in the stage of the ritualization of the environment. They injected the structures of the myths in the environment through their complex semantic systems. Doing so they did not generate a practical prohuman environment. They made a hostile situation more bearable. On the other hand the creaticin of environmental semantic systems assisted the establishment of the human community. Like money in later societies, its structure became the primitive fixed eternal, a recognizable sign for what could otherwise be confused and conflicting operations. From Chaos, a k-d-sh or temenos2' is offered not as an end-product but as a hope, a promise and a blueprint of action.22 The system of problem-solving processes is only a complementary part of the culture of magic. The System of Visual Order and the System of Dirt and Purity can be considered from this point of view almost arbitrary products of the human mind, actions to relieve tension and confront ambiguity aroused by what was perceived as environmental inconsistencies. At the next stage, the Systems or their parts which are proven by experience (as much as mathematical theories can be tested by reality), start showing characteristics of problem-solving processes. A kind of applied magic develops out of the theoretical magic as applied mathematics is derived from the theoretical. Thus the System of Visual Order, like the System of Dirt, is applied consciously or sub-consciously for purposes of IsMary Douglas, op. cit. "1Mary Douglas. op, cit. 20The Biblical tebhel.

The structures of magic which are not used for such utilitarian or practical purposes and which do not disappear are either conserved behind a reactionary force of conservatism and superstition, or they become redefined and reinterpreted through a new use as in the case of the Visually Ordered pieces which were adopted by the System of Art. Here the identities of the System of Visual Order and the System of Art are confused. The phenomenon of their transformation in time is taken as their congruency. The transfer of the use of the same objects from the Visual Order to Art is possible because of the similarities of their internal structure as environmental units. What distinguished the System of Dirt and Purity from Visual Order was in the structures that each one offered: rigid, simplistic, general, for Dirt and Purity; flexible, complex, full of individuality for Visual Order. Form making through the System of Visual Order, valued as art, could be something spectacular but cleaning up is only respectable. Thus their fate was different. But as much as they are different, they come very close in their first application being equally irrelevant to the System of Art. Works of art are made up of selected elements, assembled in a certain structure according to certain interrelationships. They form a semantic system within the existing systems with identifiable properties, (defined by their boundaries) which tend to have attributes of completeness and consistency. One of the reasons that the System of Art borrowed objects from the System of Visual Order together with several of the methods producing them is that both systems share the attributes of completeness and consistency. Art assemblies serve as models of the exterior world in some ways not unlike scientific models. Art, indeed, like science is a form of knowledge. Like the body of a scientific theory it is made up of a set of interrelated elements. Like a scientific theory a certain set of interrelationships can be extrapolated out of the familiar art object as a model and projected to unfamiliar situations.23 However in a scientific model a minimum of ambiguity and unpredictability is desired, while a work of art generates the maximum of interpretations not rationally connected. A work of art generates the most unpredictable structures and interrelationships out of its body. Thus the work of art is in this respect opposite of a scientific model and to a problem-solving process. Art generates strategies rather than tactics. It creates problems, questioning and establishing goals, rather than solving them. Art is an activity that induces randomness and desirable ambiguity. While games have the same effect through concrete activity as outcome, art functions as an agitator of structure production in culture. Works of art are not random assemblances. They build in randomness within their components and their interrelationships (7), a randomness which is revealed when works of art are interpreted and used. This initial internal structure (a minimal pre-established determined order) traps, limits, excites and squeezes a new set of structures (an undetermined outcoming order). Thus the use "Karl W. Deutsch, The Nerves of Government, The Free Press, N.Y., 1963, pp. 3-72, for definition of the function of models in relation to familiarization. 13 9 7 of art is the performance of structure extrapolation. My thesis here is that art as a system is one of the tactics of culture. It is not an internal psychic need. It is a temporary semantic system still in operation.2 The system of Visual Order in its turn was, temporarily, tactics to art. Art which once used visual form for its purposes is abandoning it at this moment. Art scatters and hides itself behind several physical manifestations and systems 8 I.&amp; - - -a - --- - J_- %Lf&amp;Af __ (8). It changes dress at convenience. Visual Order may be irrelevant to the manifestations of the System of Art as it develops in our time. The problem-solving applications of Visual Order for purposes of information or identification are inefficient, unreliable, or redundant compared to communication signals that serve this purpose better. Deprived of the above uses Visual Order is ordering very little. While in the culture of 24Wittgenstein, in 1938, found "very funny, very funny indeed", the "idea that psychology is one day going to explain all our aesthetic judgments" (op. cit., p. 19). Instead he urges the definition of it by its use within a culture. magic, together with the System of Dirt and Purity, it was the fixed eternal for the man- made environment, it is becoming now, when faith is shaken, more like useless currency.25 Visual Order, in a situation of self-defense, conservatism, and superstition, becomes petrified into a hoard.26 The production of its insignificant and irrelevant forms is formalism, the fetishism of form, a process of populating the man-made environment with the components of alienation and ultimately of suppression (9). Following this idea, any revolution against a particular visual form for the sake of another visual form is an attempt to "practice nonrepressiveness within the framework of the established order" (10), but even the "wilder paraphernalia of hot or cool life" remain a "vehicle of stabilization and conformity rather than change".27 The designer of the man-made environment is faced with the situation of: total negation of any formalization (dropping out), total 10 submission to the system of repressive- deformation, continuing the acceptance of visual order; or the search for a non- repressive formalization; relevant and prohuman. The next step to be taken is the investigation of a way to organize the man- made environment which will be more effective through a system more explanatory, descriptive and predictive. A profile of the use of the environment can be developed starting from the use of the objects or places, recording as closely as possible the different interactions between persons and environment at a point in time. We can select space and time limits for such observations. We can repeat this process in other areas of time and space until we get enough facts to form a kind of constant pattern, a group with its permutations, a life style, and from it the most primitive level of a theory, "a field theory.'28 We can make our study even more dynamic, sending questionnaires and asking people for alternatives to what was recorded, things they wished, which were frustrated. This description is empirical and objective. We minimized the values of the observer carried to the observed. Besides positive facts, there are negative aspects also in such approach. The more we try to induce universality in our picture by broadening the sample, the more the facts will constitute a body so complex that it will become useless.2 We can attempt to reduce this tendency by using a higher level of representation, using structures 2'Mary Douglas, op. cit. 26Marx's expression for the alienated System of Money. 27Herbert Marcuse, Eros and Civilization, Random House, N.Y., 1955, pp. 1577, ix. 28F.

But it is the principle of this technique which reduces all to synchrony, which bounds it to be limited. The facts that "have got an irreversible order ... will escape the analysis".' This is the fate of all strictly behavioral and structural models. I 12 .tts Diachrony and prediction (which is our concern) can be developed through an alternative model; a model that includes normative strategies. A model is needed showing, in strata, the connections to normative levels through alternative means. Those norms and means will constitute the variables of the model. Their selection and arrangement will be subject to a surrounding meta-strategy, affecting both the level of norms of the model and the structure of its levels. It is up to this meta-strategy to proclaim the prohumanity of the model. 13 The acceptance of variables which describe economic growth according to existing definitions can be fatal;32 a submission of humanity to a plan that few demand and nobody understands (11). Increase in speed could mean more vicious cycling (12). Increase in technological interaction could 14 mean more puppet action (13). Increase of the efficiency of the technological infrastructure 3olbid. 3Mary Douglas, The Meaning of Myth in the Structural Study of Myth and Totemism, Toristock Publication, London, 1967, p. 67. 32E. J. Misham, The Costs of Economic Growth, Staples Press, London, 1967. could mean a strait jacket of oppression and terror (14). More suburban protection would mean more insularity and display (15). All of which could result in more alienation, more aggression (16), more manipulation (17). 15 On the other hand, a different strategy is conceivable, the model of which will include variables whose dimensions measure the qualities of interactions, the kinds of human contact."3 the mixture, the number, the 16 duration frequency under which they occur."' The selection and arrangement of those variables will thus structure the choices of interaction. This probabilistic relationship of people through available niches of interaction and the network of movement looks similar to the arrangement of an army on a terrain in the traditional art of war (a perfect antihuman interaction model (18). It was determining the probable outcomes of confrontations through ordering terrain, weapons and groups. 33See S. Chermayeff and C. Alexander, Community and Privacy, Doubleday and Co., N.Y., 1963. The importance of the proposal described there lies in trying actually to measure the urban environment in terms of the variable of privacy as a dimension. 34Serge Chermayeff, Alexander Tzonis, Advanced Studies in Urban Environments, Yale University, New Haven, 1967. 17i 181 When we measure or order the man-made environment, in terms of such criteria, we impose on the three dimensional visible reality a hypothetical overlay (19); "an abstract hyperspace, every coordinate of which corresponds to a relevant variable in 19 ' 30set the structure"35 of community.36 Reversing the process when we want such criteria to be the controlling factors of the man-made environment, this hyperspace becomes the initial structure of the three dimensional unit form, which will grow on it in multi-functional 20 components" (20), followed later by the third overlay,3" the pattern of human behavior (21). 3sWe use here the hypothesis of the ecological model. The choices of human interaction depend on the Urban Niche, the abstractly inhabited hypervolume." See G. Evelyn Hutchinson, The Ecological Theater and the Evolutionary Play, Yale Univ. Press, New Haven, 1965, p. 26. We remain very careful, however, in applying superficial analogies in terms of how efficiency is defined. 361in this arrangement the variables should not be "minimaxed". One can speculate about an application of games theory where every variable is maximized with the minimum of interference and loss of the others. Within a stratification model this, I think, is possible, always referring the "game" to a "metagame". See Anatol Rapoport, Escape From Paradox, "Scientific American", July, 1967. "3Each component should be a solution to a multiple set of variables of the initial structure. See Rapoport, op. cit., p. 33. 38The model of this process resembles the model of biological "histogenesis" as described by C. H. Waddington, The Strategy of the Genes, George Allen &amp; Unwin, London, 1967. 14</page><page sequence="5">21 The three levels are interrelated in a stochastic order the initial structure constituting the only necessary and sufficient control3" (22). 22 What is proposed here is a kind of microzoning, a matrix of stochastic processes. It is very different from the traditional zoning (a term famous for its crudeness and cruelty): 1. It provides a finer grain in a micro-space structure. 2. A different set of variables through which the process of differentiation will act, not by institution (superficial structuring)40 but by the dimensions of the qualities of human interaction, or the movement system4' (23). 23 3. An undetermined, probabilistic allocation (24), bounding activities in interaction through time and space. The initial urban structure, like the structure of a myth, is an intermediary entity between a statistical aggregate of molecules and the molecular structure itself.4'2 A basic hypothesis underlying this argument (a General Systems hypothesis) is that a structure or organization is an entity of its own which can be abstracted from an object or a model. It can further be injected into another object or environment, thus transforming it. Thus the possibilities of structure transplantation lies in the understanding of the limitations and potentials that the transplanted structure offers. The models of each particular system are characterized by a set of outcomes, permissible interrelationships prescribed by its structure.43 Bounded by those interrelationships is the degree of its ability to cope with the unfamiliar." This ability constitutes the threshold up to which the model within each system performs. Abandoning one system in favor of another means that the possible interrelationships that it could offer through its models were overdetermined. Confrontation with a new situation can develop the preference of another kind of system; but in the process of undergoing this change some desirable characteristics of a system can be lost completely from the environment. A quantification of a quality can be simultaneously a reduction of its reality (25). "Myth is an obscure way of writing history,41 perhaps (26)" but simultaneously it gives the liberating and sacramental strength of creative imagination.46 When components of the culture of magic are removed from the environment, such as the objects designed according to the System of Visual Order, the environment's redundancy and unreliability is reduced. On the other hand the value of their disappearance should be measured against the resulting reduction of desirable ambiguity and indeterminance in the environment. In an open undefinable universe, the total refusal of randomness in the man-made environment deprives it of certain opportunities to face unexpected alternatives.4? To ostracize ruthlessly randomness from our environment (27) excludes the possibilities for re-orientation and redefinition.48 A further argument against the acceptance of a problem-solving system as an organizing principle of the man-made environment is that its optimization tactics serve strategies whose selection is always an act of human 25 repression and submission (28), no matter what the variables involved. (6y An alternative internal organization for the man-made environment can be proposed whose structure is borrowed from the System of Art. It is a hypothesis of an internally (structurally) "esthetic environment" similar to Schiller's "esthetic state".' The initial structure of this environment, will be similar to the initial structure of a work of Art, their components being interrelated in a similar manner. 26; This hypothesis depends on the possibility of a non-repressive society where the inter- human relationships do not have to be based on the principle of exploitation. The technological progress which can make the man-to-man relations of exploitation and oppression obsolete can establish art as the organizing principle in human interrelationships. It can reorganize the interrelationships between the components of the man-made environment as well, 27 28 L dissolving the tyranny of the problem-solving system, the authority of optimization and determination of use and production.

The advance of desirable randomness and freedom in decision will evolve not only in the innovating open matrixes applied in works of art (30) but in the organization of the model that structures the man-made environment. The future man-made environment in a free society will definitely have a form, a new multidimensional form; but this form and this newness will neither be demonstrated in objects that picture it, in models of it, or in works of art. It will be demonstrated in its internal organization, in its use, and in the way this suggests to the participants new human interrelationships. In this process the disappearance of art from one aspect of the man-made environment is actually its resurrection in another. Its body is destroyed in terms of the discontinuous entities; the objects of art, the aesthetic parcels, statues, facades, entrances, or city 30 29 outlines. The organizing principle steps out and survives in activity. The new world will be slow and painful in its emergence, "the spirit of the time, growing slowly and quietly ripe for the new form it is to assume, disintegrates one fragment after another of the structure of the previous world."' The new components will first appear elliptic and enigmatic. The old components will disappear slowly and painfully. For those who were educated in the good manners of the peaceful and reassuring form of the obsolete Visual Order, of the works of art, their skills will be atrophying every day. A universal picture of the environment will evolve where for the sake of "meaningful form," any "general Zenish sense of why bother" will prevail for some time in the complexity and contradiction of the "no style" style for style's sake.

The project was submitted by Donald and Marja Watson with my collaboration to the International Competition for a Town Plan for Espoo, Finland (1967). Location: Immediately west of Helsinki, 15 miles. Projected population: 300,000 (2000 A.D.) 3 The Espoo river valley, crossing the competition area from northeast to southwest, is scenically, topographically and historically important. A railway station and a ring road offer access to the main national routes, projected harbors, the city of Helsinki and the airport. For the details of the competition see: "Arkkitehtuurikilpailuja", Journal Finnish Architecture Competitions, 1967-68. SAFA, Helsinki, Finland. In the Espoo project only the structure of the initial level was proposed. The project did not present any visual form, which seems to be what the jurors were more interested in as they describe the winning project (1): "architecture... a voluntary expression suggesting undefined stereometric volumes 4 which remind one of the character of Finland's lakes and forests crystal-clear and rocky." The Espoo New Town was considered as a unit of urban fabric within the multi-unit chain of stops along the mass transit (electric train) network on which Helsinki is growing. 2 5OHerbert Marcuse, ibid., citing Schiller, op. cit. sG.

The sustaining amenities, natural or technological (3), are placed 5 outside the urban fabric' connected in a network of movement (4). The direction of growth perpendicular to the valley preserves the valley floor as a natural and historical conservation area. It is connected to the region by: 1. Regional public transit train and bus linked directly to the urban transportation system. 6 2. Private vehicles collected at the peripheral parking units or distributed through the peripheral collector road to the service streets. The internal network of movement consists of: M 7 1. "Boulevards" for the pedestrians (5) coinciding on a linear series of activities with a horizontal transportation system that functions (like an elevator) push-button safe, 'See Search for a New Urbanity, a pamphlet on work done by the Masters class with Prof. Serge Chermayeff, Yale School of Architecture. 1962. free, publicly owned, available 24 hours a day (promised for New York in 1930),2 stopping every 200 meters. Beginning stages of such a transit system can be accomplished first by buses. The boulevards are connected at every 200 meters3 by 2. Cross-boulevards and a cross mass transit line that ties all transit lines to the outside parking units. Between the boulevards are: 3. Galleries (6) for pedestrians, partly open or controlled climatically connecting the transit stops and the parallel boulevards, and 4. One-way service streets. 8 A dual bipolar access (7) is provided for all the components to reduce potential conflicts and assist a high degree of alternative options through environmental differentiation.' Each of such differentiated options represents a differentiated quality of human interaction. Dual access is particularly necessary (8) since the traditional concept of zoning - i.e. separating - conflicting activities in terms of civic, commercial, etc. is abandoned. The city hall for example has a dual access even for demonstrators. (Demonstrations of solidarity on the front plaza where the major's balcony probably should be and demonstrations of opposition placed in front of the windows of the bureaucrats and on the slope of the hill. The opposition will thus have opportunity to picnic while they demonstrate.) The density is uniform through the whole fabric, like an eighteenth century town (9). Rarely more than four levels or stories are used unless there are topographical peculiarities. With escalators the use of all levels by the public can be intensified at certain desirable points. Housing is available everywhere on the side or on the top of other activities, 75% of the units have direct contact with the ground (one, two and three-story dwellings). The density varies between 200-250 people per acre. Commercial units are available everywhere on the way. The multi-purpose short-term use components (drugstores, kiosks, coffee stands) are near the transit stops, while the uni-purpose long-term components (movie houses, schools, department stores) are between stops. 2Thomas Adams, The Building of the City, N.Y.

"Ibid. 17 r Whenever a major institution is to be located (such as a university), it runs across a galleria perpendicular to the boulevards to increase its public interaction through meeting all the transit lines. The same principle was applied to pieces of nature, conserved and included, the Central Park of Espoo (10). 10 The initial structure of Espoo was in several aspects inspired by Manhattan (11). age .1 11 , . . g .
