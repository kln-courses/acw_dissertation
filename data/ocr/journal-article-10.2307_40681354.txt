<plain_text><page sequence="1">R. F. Dietrich SHAW AS DRAMATIC ICON: A BIBLIOGRAPHY OF IMPERSONATIONS* Bernard Shaw's "sedulous advertisement" of himself resulted in one of the more recognizable of literary icons. The letter that reached Shaw in 1934 despite having nothing on it but "London" and a cartoon likeness of him (see RE. Lowenstein's Bernard Shaw through the Camera [London: B.H. White, 1948], p. 61) is an impressive example of the power of Shaw's icon during his life. Evidence of that icon's endurance these days is to be found at the Shaw Festival in Niagara-on-the-Lake, Ontario, where one sees the cartoon outline of Shaw's head and figure every- where, on mugs, stationery, T-shirts, sweatshirts, caps, posters, etc., and even occasionally projected in emerald light onto the curtain of the Festival Theatre. In 1991 the Shaw icon appeared in the Shaw Festival production of This Happy Breed in another guise - as the MGM lion that roars. Another, more worthwhile dimension of Shaw's iconographie pres- ence and staying power is to be found in dramatic impersonations of him, a fact impressed upon me when Aubrey Hampton asked me to write an introduction to his play, GBS Â£sf Company, that would set it in the I regret that I cannot list everyone deserving of thanks for assisting me in the research for this article, particularly all the libraries, but thanks, at least, to Sidney P.

At first I thought to include poetry and fiction as well, but cursory research showed that there were plenty of examples of use in dramatic forms alone to fill the space allotted me. When Fred Crawford invited me to produce as com- plete a list as I could of Shavian impersonations in dramatic form for SHAW: The Annual of Bernard Shaw Studies, I soon found myself over- whelmed with examples, eighty-four in all, and left with a suspicion that even more exist. Of course some of the Shavian impersonations were minimal. The actors in Dear Liar, for example, are not required to look like Shaw and Stella, but, even so, their speaking of the lines inevitably evokes something of the Shavian voice, manner, and atmosphere, and by the end of that piece one sees Shaw where the actor stands. Attempts to dramatize Shaw's character no doubt have their source in Shaw's own successful theatricalization of himself when he discovered that, to be effective in the world, he needed a public persona. From there it was an easy step to actors' impersonations of him in his own plays, C. Aubrey Smith's impersonation of Shaw as a policeman in The Admirable Bashville in 1903 and Gran ville Barker's making up Jack Tanner to look like Shaw in 1905 being among the first. About the same time "Shaw" began appearing in the plays of others, J. B. Fagan's Shakespeare vs. Shaw (1905) and James Barrie's Punch (1906) apparently being the first. After Shaw's death the one-man shows began springing up as nature abhorred the vacuum created by his absence. Although most of the first wave of impersonators have passed on, there seems to be a second wave in Donal Donnelly, Malcolm Wroe, Donald Moffat, and others to see Shaw into the twenty-first century. These dramatizations tend to fall into certain types or patterns. Episto- lary dramas predominate, as Shaw's letters have provided a rich mine for dramatization, particularly his love letters. Almost as popular is his rela- tionship with Shakespeare, Shaw sparring with Shakespeare in about a dozen plays, the two forming some sort of artistic yin and yang; the irony of Shaw's fame depending on his antagonism to Shakespeare is evident. Appropriately, many of these plays fall into the form of the "discussion play" or "drama of ideas" in which Shaw debates some worthy opponent (besides Shakespeare - Wells, Thoreau, Chesterton, Wittgenstein, etc.). Another set of plays is of the biographical-chronological sort, following Shaw's life either from beginning to end in highlights or through a specific episode, with the Fabians or the Ibsenites, say, or a certain ro- mance or family matter. Several follow him right into the afterlife, mostly by authors who want Shaw to receive his just deserts. Another set provides him a different sort of afterlife by projecting him into current events, often showing how relevant his views still are, or by introducing</page><page sequence="3">SHAW AS DRAMATIC ICON: A BIBLIOGRAPHY 127 him as a character into his own works to give them a self-reflexive, postmodern resonance. Often he is used as an introducer of and bridg- ing device between excerpts from his plays. In all these types, Shaw usually is a central figure, but there are many in which he is not. Not all the dramatizations are full-blown plays, many being sketches or skits, and there are as many of the "reader's theater" sort as of the fully staged play. Perhaps the majority were written for special occasions or for spe- cial groups, the various Shaw Societies at their meetings, for example, making a natural audience. The attitude toward Shaw displayed in these dramatizations is mixed, appropriate to the icon of "The Wise Fool" whose ambiguous appear- ance elicits ambivalent response. Even the most satirical dramatizations project something admirable about Shaw, and even the most eulogistic ones find something to disparage. Mostly they follow Shaw's view of reality as problematic. The greatest surprise to me was how good many of the dramatizations are. I expected amateur work, and found it, but many of the plays make fine reading, and the half dozen or so that I have seen even make good theater. The ones that rely heavily on Shaw's own writing have surefire material, but some of the best rely little or not at all on his writing (except perhaps to parody it). Some first-rate pens have kept the Shavian icon well polished, even when they tried to tarnish it. In the following bibliography, I left out works I was not sure about. J.M. Barrie wrote scripts for some films he had made in 1914, in at least one of which Shaw played himself, but this list of impersonations is confined to those of other actors. Noel Cummins (probably in 1986 and 1987) wrote two plays for a Dublin theater group, A Touch of the Irish and Love, Passion, and Sorry, I've Got a Headache, in which Shaw may have appeared as a character, but I have been unable to confirm this, although advertising leaflets indicate that passages from his writings were read. The BBC could not confirm Shaw's appearance in a radio script in Arabic (1948?) to which Leon Hugo alerted me. The recordings of Rob- ert Shaw and Margaret Webster reading from Shaw's works do not, strictly speaking, involve impersonation, although it is hard to avoid the Shavian voice when reading the Shavian lines. Karin Wells's play, Shaw's Women: He Liked Eggs (broadcast by the CBC in 1988), unsuccessfully sought, appears to contain no impersonation either, although he is appar- ently constantly referred to as if he were a presence. Finally, Charles Berst advises me that although the play Molly Tompkins wrote seems to have modeled a character partly on Shaw, there probably were no direct impersonations in it. In this bibliography I have given what facts I know about these very</page><page sequence="4">128 R. F. DIETRICH elusive and sometimes ephemeral works, whose manuscripts were often hard to come by. If facts of publication do not appear, that probably (but not necessarily) means that the work was never published. If no produc- tion history is indicated, that probably (but not necessarily) means that the work was never produced. In a few cases dates, authors, or titles were ambiguously recorded or are simply unknown to me, in which case I either omit them altogether or follow with a question mark. Annotated Bibliography of Dramatizations in which Shaw Appears as a Character Anderson, Porter. George Bernard Shaw: Weeding the Garden, a Dramatic Lecture for One Actor. First performed in Sarasota, Florida, in 1979 in partial fulfillment of the M FA in acting from the Florida State University/Asolo Conservatory of Professional Actor Training. Presents Shaw lecturing on religion, largely using Shaw's own words. Part of the lecture takes place while Shaw gives God five minutes to strike him dead for the blasphemy of disbelieving in Him. That anthropomorphic God and other superstitions needing to be eliminated before mature religious thinking can take place, Anderson takes as his theme Shaw's insistence that "somebody must take the Garden of Eden in hand and weed it properly." Angel, Leonard. Isadora fcf G.B. Toronto: Playwrights Canada, 1978. First pro- duced in May 1977 at the Vancouver East Cultural Centre. Isadora Duncan was supposed to have proposed once to Shaw that they have a child, for surely this superchild would have her beauty and his brains. Shaw ques- tioned whether it might just as well have his beauty and her brains. Leonard Angel has imagined the scene of this repartee to be Isadora's studio in London, where the proposal to procreate is made quite seriously by an aging dancer whose three children have died. Shaw (played by Anthony Holland) wiggles out by declaring the imagined love affair superior to the actuality. Barling, E.M. Back to G.B.S.: Shaw Tercentenary Celebration Malvern a.d. 2156. Malvern, Worcester: Panton House, 1932. Reprinted in a Malvern Festival Book, 1936. Written as a curtain raiser for the Malvern Festival of 1932, this one-act play imagines a distant time when "Shawdolators," American tour- ists, and drama critics reverentially or debunkingly gather to celebrate Shaw's tercentenary. Shaw having become as mythological as Shakespeare, and as much a bore in school, the talk about Shaw is confused and inaccu- rate, one drama critic insisting, for instance, that only H. G. Wells could have written Shaw's plays. As darkness descends and all enter the "Talkiedrome" to see a film of Widowers' Houses, outside the shades of Shakespeare and Shaw lament how misunderstood their plays are, crying in unison, "How long, Î Lord, how long!"</page><page sequence="5">SHAW AS DRAMATIC ICON: A BIBLIOGRAPHY 129 Barnes, John. Shaw vs. Shakespeare. An Encyclopedia Britannica Film, 1970 (Don- ald Moffat as Shaw). A three-reeler, this educational film, in color, has Shaw presenting and discussing the differences between Julius Caesar and Caesar and Cleopatra. Reel one is devoted to a discussion of contrasting scenes in the two plays to support Shaw's contention that his vision of Caesar is superior; reel two shows scenes from Julius Caesar, "the most splendid political melo- drama ever written"; and reel three shows scenes from Caesar and Cleopatra, illustrating Shavian views on vengeance and political genius. The words Shaw speaks are from various sources, but mostly from the Preface to Three Plays for Puritans. Richard Kiley is Caesar in both plays. A very useful film. Barrie, J.M. Punch: A Little Tragedy in One Act. Published in SHAW 10 (1990): 63- 72. Produced at the Comedy Theatre 5 April 1906 as part of a triple bill. Since the text at the British Library is contradicted in some details by the program of the performance (for example, Shaw is called "The New Man" in the text and "Superpunch" in the program), it is likely that the perfor- mance differed from the text in other respects as well. The text shows Punch and Judy, representatives of the old-fashioned action-oriented drama, being booed off the stage in favor of a new fad, "The New Man" (or "Su- perpunch"), a red-bearded Irishman who enthralls the public with a drama of ideas. See Leon H. Hugo's "Punch: J.M. Barrie's Gentle Swipe at 'Su- pershaw,' " SHAW 10: 60-62. Berkman, Stephanie, and Denis Rodgers. Let There Be No More Marriages. Al- though Shaw did not appear in the first version, produced at the Vancouver Fringe Festival in 1989, the second version did include Shaw (played by John Murphy) at the Kitsilano Neighborhood House in January 1990. A "memory play" centered on the relationship between Henry Irving and Ellen Terry in which Shaw appears briefly in negotiation with Irving for The Man of Destiny. Not seen. Blow, Sydney, and Douglas Hoare. His [or The] Wild Oat. First performed in Portsmouth 29 November 1926. Not seen. The play seems to have been an adaptation from a French play in which three noted French authors were impersonated and named, with Shaw and Hall Caine substituting in this English version. Actor Ronald Simpson was instructed personally by Shaw in how to impersonate him, and Shaw even provided a few lines of self-satire (see the Shaw Review 7.1 [January 1964]: 29). Bristow, Douglas, adapted by. Shakes versus Shav: An Evening of Comedy from the Pen of G.B.S. Televised by the South African Broadcasting Corporation on 22 November 1984 (Hugh Rouse as Shaw). Sandwiched between produc- tions of The Dark Lady of the Sonnets and Shakes versus Shav was an interview of Shaw by a television personality, Christopher Dingle, in which Shaw deliv- ered his usual opinions of Shakespeare's lack of brains, barren pessimism, etc. Britton, Lionel.

Two cockneys, having won the sweepstakes, are biking in the country on their first real holiday when they collide with the luxury car of rich and</page><page sequence="6">130 R. F. DIETRICH powerful people. At the moment of impact, apparently, the cockneys, sus- pended in space and time, experience some sort of judgment day. They find themselves in an old country inn where, though treated with traditional hospitality, they become objects of debate about the uses and worth of the common man by the likes of Shakespeare, Shaw, Marx, Samuel Johnson, Napoleon, Queen Victoria, and the Queen of Sheba, with Shaw generally cross-examining the others as well. The ignorance of the cockneys makes them impervious to all the arguments, and they end by mistaking the inten- tions of the others as wicked. Escaping, they threaten to set off explosives. Whether they actually do so is not clear, for the explosion that ends the play is the completion of the collision between the plutocratic car and the cock- neys' bikes, in some sort of allegorical clash between capital and labor proba- bly meant to presage the coming war. Butt, Michael. Imitations. Produced on BBC Radio, 26 April 1987 (Allan Mc- Clelland as Shaw). Not seen. The Independent Shavian 25.3 (1987): 49 reports a radio performance of an exchange between Shaw and Lady Kennet (the former Lady Scott), widow of the Arctic explorer, as she painted his portrait. Callen, Howard. The Bashful Genius. First produced at the Nottingham Playhouse on 12 February 1964 (John Neville as Shaw). Focused on Shaw's ambiva- lence toward Charlotte from their meeting in August 1896 to their marriage in June 1898, this play employs the clown-with-a-broken-heart theme, show- ing Shaw, headed for mental and physical breakdown, rescued only by his resolving his ambivalence in marriage. It reveals the machinations of the Webbs in this romance, tangles the plot with the amusing entrances and exits of Frank Harris and Uncle Walter, among others, and works in some pathos with Shaw's mother. The play ties Shaw's wit to specific human contexts as Shaw wittily struggles to adapt to a hostile, heartbreaking world. Churchill, Sarah, and Edward Thommen, arranged by. Affair of Letters. Per- formed in Buffalo, 12 March 1952, with the authors in the lead roles. Not seen. A dramatization of the correspondence of Ellen Terry and Shaw, with "Mr. Preface Footnote" serving as narrator.

Original production by the Young Vic in London, 1980-81. Believing that My Fair Lady had "drawn the fangs of the original," Denise Coffey decided to try putting the fangs back in by installing Shaw as a character in his own play. Shaw begins this Pygmalion with a stern prologue on the English having no respect for their language, ends the play by delivering the famous antiro- mantic Epilogue, and in between interferes with the action at transitional points to summarize matters, underline the problematics, and introduce the next scene, all of which creates the impression of the playwright involved with a work in progress and being as surprised by his play as Higgins is by Eliza's independence.

Performed at the Nottingham Playhouse in 1968 (John Neville as Shaw). In two acts and seventeen scenes, most with song and some with dance, Shaw's life is highlighted from his lonely arrival in London to his lonely last days at Ayot St. Lawrence, with much company, mostly Fabian and female, in between. Scenes satirizing the Fabians are interspersed with scenes dramatizing Shaw's major love interests - Ellen Terry, Charlotte, and Mrs. Patrick Campbell - the recurrent theme being sounded by the latter when she recites a nursery rhyme and improvised doggerel (some from Shaw) about a madman who cleans his boots with strawberry jam, which summarizes the practical world's view of Shaw's peculiar sanity.

This episode counter- points Eleanor Marx-Aveling's socialist preaching, particularly on the sub- ject of a more open and honest marriage, with the frustration of those ideals by her caddish philandering husband, Dr. Aveling. Shaw is listed in the cast in a nonspeaking role(!), apparently to appear in the background of some group scene (perhaps in the Avelings' famous reading of A Doll's House, when Shaw played Krogstad), but he is not mentioned in the TV script that follows.

Shaw makes a brief appearance in this film dedicated to showing how Disney cartoons are made. Robert Benchley arrives at Disney Studios to try to persuade Disney to film a children's book, The Reluctant Dragon, and ends up touring the studios and witnessing various works in progress. One episode involves the making of a series of still frames for the story of Baby Weems, a prodigy who is born talking. As an instant celebrity, Baby Weems is visited first by Albert Einstein and then by Shaw, who come to learn from him. Baby Weems says to Shaw, "It's not only the things you say, Mr. Shaw, but the cute way you say them." Shaw comments: "Why! Two thousand years ahead of his time!" The person doing the Shaw voiceover is not identified. Duncan, Ronald. The Death of Satan in Satan, Socialites and Solly Gold: Three New Plays from England. New York: Coward-McCann, 1961. First performed at the Royal Court Theatre, 15 May 1956 (John Welsh as Shaw). In this two-act play, Hell is a place much like The Waste Land. At the opening, Shaw, Wilde, and Byron are consigned to a Hell they would not have been caught dead in - a gentleman's club with a cozy fire where time is spent playing cards and reading the newspapers, an environment intended to leave the soul alone with its remorse but which the moderns find quite comfortable. A disap- pointed Satan sends Don Juan, one of the old-fashioned remorseful sorts, back to earth to discover why Hell is no longer hellish for moderns. Re- turned to earth, Don Juan appears at a modern luxury hotel in Seville and discovers that modern world T. S. Eliot so disliked - a world without spiri- tual dimension, devoted to the purposeless pursuit of comfort, democracy, and self-expression, with tolerance, indifference, and boredom toward all. Don Juan returns to Hell with the news that Hell is no longer effective because the moderns have become used to its boredom on earth, having so flattened all values that nothing matters and no remorse is required. Utterly discouraged by modern disbelief, Satan dies, but not before laying a curse on Byron, Wilde, and Shaw for creating disbelief.

Shaw throughout is made to speak very un-Shavian lines and behave in a very un-Shavian way. Edipus by Shaw. Performed at the Shaw Festival Theatre in Niagara-on-the-Lake, Ontario, 20 July 1986 (Herb Foster as Shaw). A dramatization of Shaw's letter to Gilbert Murray in which Shaw proposes that Murray translate Oedi- pus Rex. Shaw helpfully provides a skeleton of the play to illustrate Sopho- cles's crude stagecraft and his "brains of a ram" that better illustrates how brevity can be the soul of parody. After the opening address to Murray, Shaw also speaks the stage directions of this play, as, for example, "Enter Hermit." Eulenberg, Herbert. Against Shaw. German title: Gegen Shaw: Eine Streitschrift mit einer Shaw-Parodie des Verfassers. Dresden: Carl Reissner/Verlag, 1925. See the Shaw Review 7.2 (May 1964): 64-65. Among other satiric treatments of Shaw in this volume, "Against Shaw" concludes with a dramatic sketch depicting Shaw's entry into the Elysian fields, where he meets other artistic greats and ends with the Devil. Ewens, Eric. Henrik Ibsen: The Tryptych [sic]. Produced on BBC Radio, February 1969. Not seen. A dramatization of the writings of Shaw, Yeats, and Joyce, three Irish writer who fell under the influence of Ibsen and who might have launched an Ibsen School of Thought but who diverged too much in their views of Ibsen and their own artistic beliefs to do so. Shaw is presented as the evangelist of Ibsen the Messiah. See The Shavian (Summer 1969): p. 31. Fagan, J.B. Shakespeare v. Shaw. Published in the Shaw Review 13.3 (September 1970): 105-31, ed. Leon H. Hugo. Performed in May 1905 in London as a benefit for actor H. B. Conway (Edmund Maurice as Shaw). This revue skit finds Shaw the defendant in a libel case brought by Shakespeare, whose indignant spirit had visited a lawyer at a sÃ©ance. Shaw's debunking of Shake- speare is cited, and then actors testify for and against, none very convincingly. The foreman of the jury, impersonating J.M. Barrie, concludes that it is a choice of evils. The jury, composed of modern dramatists, awards Shake- speare only a farthing in damages (perhaps in echo of the award Whistler received when he brought suit for damages against Ruskin). Angered, Shake- speare takes Shaw down with him to the eternal punishment of listening to Shakespeare's plays performed "by the swollen ghosts of actor managers." Fell, James B. Bernard Shaw Arrives: A Fantasy in One Act. London: Samuel French, 1953. Shaw arrives in Hell, here not boring as Shaw presents it in Man and Superman, but more intellectually stimulating than Heaven, and is intro- duced to Shakespeare. As the two playwrights critique each other's work and politics, they are revealed to be alike in their self-absorption. Fletcher, Bramwell. The Bernard Shaw Story. First performed at the Gate Theatre in Dublin, December 1964, but toured mostly in America. In revised form presented as A Ghost from the Future and You Said It, Mr. Shaw! This one-man show, which originally consisted mostly of Shaw's answering questions on cards supposedly provided by the audience, was in its You Said It, Mr. Shaw!</page><page sequence="10">134 R- F. DIETRICH version turned into a dialogue when Bramwell Fletcher's wife, Lael Werten- baker, posed as a reporter asking questions. This format allowed Fletcher to roam over a broad range of material and to capture the spontaneity of Shaw's wit as he reminisces about family skeletons and old friends or delivers pronouncements on the usual Shavian topics and ends with "a message for America." In its several versions, this show toured for many years, particu- larly to American colleges. Garrick Gaieties, 1925 and 1930. In the 1925 version, in October, Shaw (played by Philip Loeb, the director) appeared in the "Finale" with such of his charac- ters as Bluntschli, Raina, Saint Joan, Dick Dudgeon, Caesar, and Cleopatra (music by Richard Rodgers; lyrics by Lorenz Hart - see The Complete Lyrics of Lorenz Hart [New York: Knopf, 1986], pp. 53-54). In the 1930 version, in October (not seen), Shaw (played by Sterling Holloway), along with Eugene O'Neill and Ferenc Moinar, appeared in the "Opening Number," captioned "the Strange Interlude that gave birth to the Garrick Gaieties" (music by Rodgers; lyrics by E. Y. Harburg). Although missing manuscripts make this difficult to verify, Shaw may also have been a character in the second num- ber, "Shavian Shivers" (music by Vernon Duke; lyrics by Harburg) which is captioned, "Which proves that Shaw will not leave the stage once he gets it," and Sterling Holloway (presumably as Shaw) and the chorus are listed as cast. This number, after revision, was apparently moved from its earlier position as number 17, where it was captioned "A song about Shaw which is expected to make Shakespeare turn in his grave with envy" and where Shaw does not appear in the cast list.

To Be Shaw: A Dramatic Portrait of Bernard Shaw, Based on His Own Wnting. Short version produced on the fringe of the Cambridge Festi- val and the Edinburgh Festival in 1986. Full version first produced at the Man in the Moon Theatre in London, October/November 1986. Beginning with the opinion of a National Trust official at Shaw's death that Shaw would not last as a literary figure, this bare-stage play allows four actors to roam over the entire Shavian world to question that assertion, questioning as well the whole idea of fame with typical Shavian irreverence. In an impressionist collage of short scenes, evoking the immense range of Shaw's experiences, the actors sometimes speak in Shaw's voice, sometimes in the voices of oth- ers, and sometimes as Shaw's characters to create an impression of what it was like "to be Shaw," an impression that emphasizes how intensely Shaw lived in the moment, undercutting "posterity" as he undercut everything else, with a joke. Home, William Douglas. Portraits. Performed at the Savoy Theatre in 1987 after a national tour (Richard Wordsworth as Shaw). See The Independent Shavian 25.3 (1987): 48. In a play about Augustus John, which consists mainly of a series of conversations that characterize his life as an artist, John in the second scene invites Shaw over to talk to Viscount Montgomery, who is sitting for his portrait, John hoping that Shaw will bait the field marshal into a more lively expression. Shaw succeeds admirably by discoursing irritat- ingly on matters military and political. Hotchner, A. E. The White House: A Presidential Entertainment in Two Acts. New York: Samuel French, 1964.

A series of free-form vignettes depicting the presidential doings and backstairs moments at the White House from Wash- ington to Wilson, emphasizing the curious humanity of presidents and their wives. Shaw appears briefly, answering a call from Theodore Roosevelt, who objects on racial grounds to Shaw's advocacy of birth control: other races may need thinning out, but not the white. Shaw concludes that he would like to put Roosevelt in a play some day if he could find a way to make him believable. Huggett, Richard. The First Night of Pygmalion: A Comedy for Two People.

Television productions in 1966 and 1969 starred Max Adrian as Shaw. A play about events leading up to the opening night of Pygmalion, depicting the stormy relations among Shaw, Beerbohm Tree, and Mrs. Patrick Campbell. Tree's trying to turn Pygmalion into My Fair Lady before its time, Mrs. Campbell's inclining to let her fascination do the acting, and Shaw's struggling to see his play acted as he wrote it, all complicated by behind-the-scenes hanky-panky between Shaw and "Stella," made the re- hearsals a potpourri of rows, tantrums, walkouts, no-shows, silent treat- ments, abuse, cajolery, and cheerful insults, here well salted with the most</page><page sequence="13">SHAW AS DRAMATIC ICON!

The Trials of Oscar Wilde (a film retitled for American distribution as The Man with the Green Carnation). Great Britain, Warwick/Viceroy (Harold Hughes), 1960. In this account of Wilde's life, a red-bearded Shaw appears briefly in two scenes. In the opening scene, as Wilde sweeps triumphantly through the crowded lobby of the theater after the success of the opening of Lady Windermere's Fan, Shaw says to Wilde, "I've always admired your plays, Mr. Wilde," and Wilde replies, "I've always admired them, too, Mr. Shaw." Later Shaw is glimpsed in the lobby after the successful opening of The Importance of Being Earnest. Hutchinson, Gertrude Press, author and narrator. The Fabians and I.

In this stage version of Shaw's fable, Shaw as a quick-change artist played Jehovah, the God of Job, Ecclesiastes, Micah, Christ, and an Irish gardener, making the postmodern point that Shaw as puppetmaster is more interest- ing than his puppets.

Boston: Little, Brown, 1957. First produced at the Dublin Gate Theatre Studio in 1929 (which at that time was the Peacock Theatre). This expressionist play about Robert Emmet, satirizing the gap between his idealism and present and past reali- ties and given a title calculated to annoy Lady Gregory and the Abbey Theatre (who had rejected the play under its original title, Shadowdance), contains a brief appearance in Part II of Shaw as a shadow saying, "Every dream is a prophecy; every jest an earnest in the womb of time."

The Daily Herald (21 Decem- ber 1941) reported that Der Chronoplane was scheduled for a Berlin produc- tion but also that the Kerrs had been exiled from Germany when Hitler came to power, so it is not clear whether the production occurred. It is also not clear whether this is an opera since the manuscript sent by the Berlin Akademie Der KÃ¼nste has no musical notation.

Most refuse, but Shaw and two others go along, Shaw because he wants to meet Saint Joan. Unfortunately, the Chronoplane crashes in about the year 1800, where they encounter a young Byron chaf- ing against his age's lack of liberty. Byron returns with them to the present, eager to experience a more liberal age, which Shaw praises with ironic hu- mor for its progressiveness. But after an encounter with the "liberated" great-granddaughter of a woman he had wooed in his own time, Byron becomes disillusioned with the modern world's unromantic approach to love, as well as with the destructiveness of modern weapons combined with modern capitalism, and he asks to return to his own time. The idea, appar- ently, was not to attack modern times but to show the difficulty, even for superior minds, of bridging the gap between different ages. Einstein con- cludes by declaring the necessity for going on with the human experiment. Kilty, Jerome. Dear Liar: A Comedy of Letters, Adapted from Correspondence of Bernard Shaw and Mrs. Patrick Campbell. New York: Dodd, Mead, 1960. A Samuel French edition (1960) is subtitled A Biography in Two Acts. First produced in Chicago in 1956 (Kilty as Shaw). One of the most frequently produced of these plays, Dear Liar asks of its two actors only the suggestion of imperson- ation, leaving it to the words to charm the audience into imagining the originals as they were in their varying moods, from loving to combative, from poetic to witty, of their moments of spirited correspondence. Act I covers 1899 to 1914 and Act II 1914 to 1939. The letters begin with Shaw typically trying to recruit a famous actress for his New Drama, but he very soon finds himself increasingly enchanted by her and eventually roused to sexual desire, even to the point of being willing to commit adultery; but "Mrs. Pat" ducks out of an assignation and marries another George. Impov- erished in old age, she asks Shaw to let her publish their love letters, but Shaw refuses "to play the horse to your Lady Godiva." Krutch, Joseph Wood. G.B.S. Enters H eaven(f). In Lauriat Lane, ed., Approaches to Waiden (San Francisco: Wadsworth, 1961), pp. 96-101. Reprinted from the Saturday Review, 24 May 1952. A "dialogue of the dead" between Shaw and Thoreau, contrasting their philosophical beliefs. "I talk, therefore I am," says Shaw. But all the collectivist and evolutionary talk in the world will not budge Thoreau from sitting on his pumpkin and contemplating his special muse. Langner, Lawrence. Saint Bernard and Saint Joan. Published in the Shaw Review 17.3 (September 1974): 114-23. Performed at an annual Theatre Guild dinner. A clever parody of the Epilogue to Saint Joan by the man who headed the Theatre Guild and produced Back to Methuselah and Saint Joan, and whose objection to the length of Shaw's plays becomes the principal joke of this parody. Shaw, visited in his bedroom by the Saint Joan characters to announce his ascension to sainthood and to praise him, concludes that with such success he must write another, even longer play - "But my next play . . . how long, oh Lord! How long?" Laurence, Dan H. GBS in Love: A Dramatic Narrative. Originally titled The Wicked Failure and the Ill-Used Saint: A Love Story. First performed, untitled, 19</page><page sequence="15">SHAW AS DRAMATIC ICON: A BIBLIOGRAPHY 139 September 1958 for the Shaw Society of England in London. Performed at a meeting of the Shaw Society of America in New York, 19 March 1962. First public performance 4 February 1963 at the Donnell Library Center of the New York Public Library. Title changed in 1976. This one-man show by Laurence dramatizes the Pygmalion-like relationship between the young Shaw, frustrated novelist, and a student nurse named Alice Lockett. In their correspondence, Shaw in 1881 initiated his lifelong habit of sublimating love into letters, in this case less because he preferred it that way than because Lockett's prudery made it necessary. Her dual personality, both seeking and fearing emancipation, drove Shaw to write goading letters that would en- courage the New Woman in her as he strove to rescue modern "Alice" from Victorian "Miss Lockett." Her replies were usually quarreling and wounding as she mistook his strengths for weaknesses. Laurence's impersonation of Shaw is suggestive rather than literal. Luke, Peter. Married Love: The Apotheosis of Marie Slopes. First performed 1 Octo- ber 1985 at the Thorndike Theatre in Leatherhead, near London (Peter Whitbread as Shaw). Transferred to London's Wyndham's Theatre 12 May 1988 (John Moffat as G.B.S.). Another Pygmalion story, this two-act play focuses on the disastrous sex life and successful public career of Marie Stopes, early advocate of birth control and sex education, who is portrayed as having been set on her path by G.B.S. Shaw steals many scenes with his witty advice to her, and his use of her as a model for Saint Joan seems to show that he sensed her potential for martyrdom, which she only narrowly averted.

"Scandals," episode 7 of Nancy Astor. Recorded by BBC-TV in 1982(?) (Stuart Latham as Shaw). Shaw appears briefly at the end of this episode when he and Lady Astor banter with the press before their trip to Russia in 1931. Lady Astor alludes to Shaw's playing Santa at Cliveden the previous Christmas, after which he has not been the same. McCracken, Rowland. "Galatea": A Sequel to Bernard Shaw's "Pygmalion." 1986. Existing in one-act and two-act versions, this play has Shaw opening the first act with a long speech to the audience, mostly derived from his "postscript" to Pygmalion, and then chatting briefly with Eliza (now called Elizabeth) and Freddy, who run a combined flower shop and greengrocery, before leaving on a train. It is the day before their fifth wedding anniversary in 1918, only a month after the end of the Great War (in which Freddy lost a leg), and the Eynsford-Hills are preoccupied with finding better housing for Freddy's impecunious mother and sister and with preparing a speech that Freddy is to make to Higgins that they hope will serve as a comeuppance for Higgins. The second act, sans Shaw, finds the Pygmalion characters congregating at Mrs. Higgins's place to celebrate the anniversary.</page><page sequence="16">140 R. F.

Mitchell, Robert. The Match Girh. Produced at the Unity Theatre in London, 1947. An episodic play that imagines what the strike of the workers at a match factory (based on the Bryant and May strike in 1888) must have been like. Episode 9 shows one of the strike's leaders, Annie Besant, discussing with Shaw the plight of the striking match girls as they ride in a hansom cab back to the girls with the collection from a West End meeting. Shaw alludes to the writing of Widowers' Houses, which he expects the Lord Chamberlain to ban as he had recently banned Ghosts, thus making it impossible for a peo- ple's theater that deals honestly with social injustice to gain a fair hearing. When a copy of this play was sent to Shaw, he denounced this episode as "utter rubbish," "false in its facts," and interrupting "the story of the strike at its most exciting moment." Morgan, Elaine. Downstarts. Broadcast on BBC Radio 4 and Radio Eireann, 1987. An older Shaw (played by Denys Hawthorne) narrates, and a teenage Shaw (played by T. P. McKenna) acts in this play set in the Dublin of Shaw's adolescence. Designed to illustrate the wretched lot of the "downstart" in society, this play focuses on the tensions in the Shaw household resulting from the mÃ©nage Ã  trois among Shaw's parents and Lee, complicated by the drunken father's having to depend on the rascally, opportunistic Lee for the support of his family. Although charges of charlatanism have been brought against Lee, threatening his career and the family's financial well-being, Shaw's father is delighted. The action covers the breakup of the family with the departure to London of Lee, and then of Bessie and Lucy (other sister Agnes being cut), and it ends with Shaw's resolve to follow them to escape the misery of life with a downstart. Moss, Arnold. Shaw's "Back to Methuselah," Adapted for a Single Evening's Presenta- tion. London: Samuel French, 1956 (revised 1957). First performed in 1946 in a tour of forty-one cities. Shaw's original "metabiological pentateuch" taking ten hours or more to play, Moss cut the play to make it accessible in an evening's viewing. After many scenes and characters were cut, Moss sewed the remaining pieces back together by using the character of "The Drama- tist" to provide continuity and coherence, Moss himself playing Shaw.

The Shaws of Synge Street. Ed. by Robert Hogan. Dixon, Calif: Proscenium Press, 1966. Produced by the Abbey Players at the Queen's Theatre, April-May 1960 (Shaw played by Barry Monaghan). Picking up on gossip about a nonrelated Mrs. Shaw named Ellen who, like Shaw's mother, was enamored of Vandeleur Lee, O'Donovan weaves a complicated plot of compulsively philandering and womanizing music teachers (Ellen's teacher Joseph Robinson being Lee's rival in both music and seduction) and spouse abuse (the two Mr. Shaws and Robinson being abusive to their wives, Ellen's husband by beating her, Shaw's father through drunken mismanagement of his married life, and Robinson by driving his wife to suicide). All of which provide reasons for Shaw's view of love and marriage. But "Sonny" never utters a word in this play, appearing only at the end of the last act. Others refer to his playing the piano in the next room to cheer himself up as his mother prepares to leave home, and reference is made to how much he is like Lee, but his only appearance is to enter the room after his mother has left, at which he seems to be about to speak to his abandoned father but instead wordlessly goes out, leaving his father in gathering darkness.

With several actors speaking Shaw's actual words in sequence, "Shaw" introduces topics and provides bridges between the acting out of excerpts from several of his plays. Pettet, Edwin, arranged by. My Speciality Is Being Right When Other People Are Wrong. First performed at the Hedgerow Theatre in Moylan, Pennsylvania, in October- November 1975. Cut version produced for TV by WGBH, Bos- ton; presented on PBS 1 August 1981. First impersonating Shaw in 1960 during one segment of a TV series called "Laughter Is a Funny Business," Edwin Pettet developed his impersonation, with his wife's assistance, until he had created a two-hour pastiche of Shavian views that presented Shaw in his late seventies delivering a lecture in typical Shaw style but ranging over a lifetime of opinions expressed, especially on sex, women, and marriage. Toured widely. Pollock, Channing, Rennold Wolf, and Gene Buck. Sketches in the Ziegfeld Follies of 1915.

The New York Dramatic Mirror</page><page sequence="18">142 R- F. DIETRICH of 23 June 1915 lists a scene called "O. Shaw Androcles" and alludes to "Granville Barker's 'high-brow' jungle." The overall title for this segment may have been "Barker's Jungle," with various dances and songs within it called "The Birth of a Chicken," "O. Shaw Androcles," "Prof. Alsoranville Barker," and "The Lion," which probably reflects recent productions of Androcles and the Lion and the publication of the play in a New York magazine the year before. Prebble, John. "The Artisan," episode 6 of The Love School. Recorded for BBC- TV in December 1974 (Struan Rodger as Shaw). In a series about the Pre- Raphaelite Brotherhood, Shaw appears in the final episode when William Morris turns from aestheticism to politics to achieve his Utopian dream and finds Shaw a promising but somewhat cynical comrade in revolution. Shaw tries to distinguish cynicism from "realism," but the idealistic Morris is un- comprehending. The episode concludes with Morris returning to aestheti- cism after disillusionment with political action sets in. Python, Monty. Sketch in Matching Tie and Handkerchief. Arisple or Charisma Records, 1973. In a rather inconsequential bit, Wilde, Shaw, and the Prince of Wales are formally announced at a party, Whistler already being present, and a game of witlessness ensues. Wilde first exercises a rather lame wit with simple mechanical inversions - "There is only one thing worse than being witty, and that is not being witty" - which receive prolonged, uproarious laughter. Then he insults the Prince, claiming that Whistler or Shaw did it, which forces Whistler and Shaw to nimbly turn insult into flattery. Shaw speaks with a pronounced brogue.

London: William Heinemann, 1954. Produced first on 26 July 1952 at the Royal Court Theatre in London. Written supposedly as a birthday tribute to Shaw, this play consists mainly of taking Shaw to task for mistaken ideas and acts; it is accompanied by a preface by St. John Ervine taking Rubinstein to task for mistaken ideas about Shaw. Candidamaniac Rubinstein imagines Shaw on the day of his death being met in Heaven by his angel-muse, Candida, who encourages him to drop "G.B.S." and allow his true and better self to emerge. After a tempting by a Mephistophelean Frank Harris, who urges him to remain true to G.B.S. , Shaw is visited by Shakespeare, who is to be his guide to Heaven, and Rosalind, Shakespeare's angel-muse. Despite Shakespeare's acknowledg- ment of some common ground, Shaw is charged with having written a lesser drama and created a mistaken philosophy. Shaw, who improbably is contrite and apologetic through most of the play, is led off at the end to elementary school. Sackler, Howard, adapted by. The Shaw-Terry Letters.

In this joking version of a joking play (which has Aeschylus besting Euripides), Dionysos descends into Hades to retrieve Shaw, who is needed to save the theater, not to mention the country. Finding Shaw bested in a contest with Shakespeare (although both strike many palpable hits), he decides to take Shakespeare back instead. Smith, J. Percy. G.K.C. and G.B.S.-A Conversation. Produced for the CBC in Toronto in 1956 (Barry Morse as Shaw). A dramatized conversation, in which Shaw and Chesterton eloquently insult and disagree with each other.

Says Chesterton, "You can hardly expect me to accept your verdict that beer was not made for man but for watering cauliflowers." Some Doctored Dilemma: A New Epilogue for the Last Performance of Mr. Shaw's Play. Published in the Academy, 9 February 1907, edited by Lord Alfred Douglas. Reprinted in the Shaw Review 7.3 (September 1964): 87-91. This mock- epilogue, offered as a substitute for Act V of The Doctor's Dilemma, was published anonymously in the Academy (the Shaw Review speculates that Rob- ert Ross was the author, possibly with the help of Douglas, but their enmity makes this questionable). The scene is the Bond Street Picture Gallery where Dubedat's works are being sold. Famous critics are there exchanging banter, and we learn that Jennifer Dubedat has "married Dr. Schutzmacher, the specialist on bigamy, only this morning."

This video series consists of seven thirty-minute tapes, the first four of which dramatize Shaw's life in a rough chronological fashion, the next two of which contain testimonials to and views about Shaw from various actors, friends, and neighbors, and the last of which dramatizes a trial scene in which Shaw is judged. In the dramatizations, the old Shaw is played by Ivor Brown, serving as an introducer of and commentator on various scenes from Shaw's life, and younger Shaws are played by Sean Mulcahy in Part I, Mel Tuck in Part II, and Colin Fox (or Eric House) in Parts III and IV.

Performed for the Shaw Society of England in London, 1985. Performed as a prelude to a reading of the Preface to John Bull's Other Island, it contains a brief ex- change between Shaw and Wittgenstein on the nature of truth and reality, with Shaw urging the philosopher to get his head out of the clouds and deal with real issues, like the Irish problem, and the philosopher pointing to the example of Bertrand Russell's dubious involvement in politics.

Taylor mentions, how- ever, that Florence Farr thought the triangle in Candida referred to her, Yeats, and Shaw. Thomas, Gwyn. The Ghost of Adelphi Terrace. Recorded for BBC-TV on 30 March 1975 (Joseph O'Conor as Shaw). Set in 1911, two years after J. M. Barrie's divorce and one year after the death of his mother surrogate, Mrs. Sylvia Davies, this play finds the lonely Barrie haunted by his long-dead mother, whose emotional vampirism in his childhood continues to drain him. Bar- rie's equally famous neighbor at Adelphi Terrace, G.B.S., has the perfect antidote to Barrie's mother fetish in an attitude of irreverence toward paren- tal ties, Mrs. Shaw's indifference toward children having fostered in Shaw an independent spirit. But Shaw's attempt to rescue the melancholy Barrie by taking him out for a night on the town ultimately fails, for Barrie is only appalled by the pub girls they meet, and sentimental songs heard in the pub only reinforce his longing for his lost mother, whose ghost returns at the end to prove once again that the brotherhood of wit Shaw offers Barrie is no substitute for a mother's love. Titley, Neil. An Intelligent Golfer's Guide to Bernard Shaw: An Entertainment from His Works. 10 December 1987. Revised as Shaw's Corner (Malcolm Wroe as Shaw) in a 1990 London production. In two parts, framed by BBC announcements of Shaw's death, the first part is presented as a lecture by Shaw on economics during or soon after World War I, and the second is set in 1946 with Shaw at his desk looking back over a long life. Titley's script follows the typical wandering path of Shaw's ruminations on the usual Shavian subjects with the usual Shavian wit and deep earnest. Torn, Jessie. A Fig Leaf in Her Bonnet. Opened at the Gramercy Art Theater in New York 14 June 1961 (Henderson Forsythe as Shaw). See the Shaw Review 5.2 (May 1962): 61-68, for a preface to the play and an excerpt. Although the Webbs, Tree, and Shakespeare are characters, this play is mainly about Shaw's relation with Mrs. Patrick Campbell from 1912 to 1914, when the famous romance heated up until Stella took the pot off the stove. Torn presents Shaw as evading her marriage proposal by attempting to have her as mistress while keeping his wife to fulfill his needs for mother-love. A good deal of invented dialogue, but occasionally one hears a familiar line or two, as when Shaw says to Stella, "With your temperament and my disposition, our marriage wouldn't have lasted a week; but what a week!"

Volker, Francine. Ibsenites. Workshop reading at the Academy of the Shaw Festi- val, Niagara-on-the-Lake, Ontario, 23 September 1989 (Michael Ball as Shaw). A promising work in progress, whose subtitle might be "Critics in Love." Shaw and Archer, compatriots in the Ibsen campaign, seek backing for an 1 896 production of Little Eyolf which will star the four New Women they have invented and fallen in love with - Janet Achurch, Elizabeth Rob- ins, Mrs. Patrick Campbell, and, as understudy, Florence Farr. But profes- sional rivalry, philandering, booze, drugs, and crankishness divide the Ib- senites, until Janet ends up shooting Shaw by mistake and Shaw concludes that the New Woman must be stamped out before she goes any further. It ends in doubtful reconciliation and the performance of the play. Voysey, Michael, devised by. An Evening with G.B.S. (or just G.B.S.). First pro- duced at the Edinburgh Festival, 1966, followed by a London season at the Criterion Theatre. Later revived as By George. Issued by Angel Records in 1967 with Max Adrian as Shaw. Revised as My Astonishing Self for Donal Donnelly, opening 11 March 1976 at the Theatre in the Park, Bracknell. Appearing under several titles as it was revised over the years and adapted for Max Adrian and Donal Donnelly, this famous one-man show, with words excerpted from various Shavian sources, provided a living autobiography and brief compendium of Shavian wit and wisdom, emphasizing Shaw's vitality and humanity, his impish sense of fun and mischief, and his capacity to surprise. Whitemore, Hugh. The Best of Friends. London: Amber Lane Press, 1988. Opened at the Apollo Theatre, London, 28 January 1988 (Ray McAnally as Shaw). A dramatized version of the three-way correspondence, beginning in 1924 and ending with Shaw's death, among Sydney Cockerell (director of the Fitzwilliam Museum in Cambridge), Dame Laurentia McLachlan (the Abbess of Stanbrook), and Shaw, it illustrates how three very different peo- ple could vehemently disagree on all the fundamental issues, particularly religious issues, and yet remain respectful friends. Sometimes the three speak to each other directly, and sometimes they soliloquize or speak to the audience. This is not a final list but the start of one.
