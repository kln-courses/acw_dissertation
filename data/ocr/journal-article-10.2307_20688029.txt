<plain_text><page sequence="1">BOOK REVIEWS Sobchack, Vivian. The Address of the Eye: A Phenomenology of Film Experience. Princeton UP, 1992, 330 pp. Vivian Sobchack's existential phenome nology of the cinema is based on the work of Maurice Merleau-Ponty and thus pur sues a significantly different project than the transcendental phenomenology of Ed mund Husserl, the "founding father" of phenomenology. There are some areas of agreement between existential and tran scendental phenomenology, such as the notion of "intentionality," which states that consciousness is never empty in any experience. Existential phenomenology also draws out certain aspects of transcen dental phenomenology that have received marginal emphasis either in Husserl's work itself or in the subsequent readings of it. For example, phenomenology insists that the world is not available to us in a way other than its engagement with con sciousness, but it does not claim that the world is constituted by consciousness. The idea of the intentional structure of consciousness does not deny the objective status of the world. The world exists not in, but for, consciousness. This reading foregrounds the life-world, which always provides a horizon for experience. It also affirms the "natural attitude," the store of habitual presuppositions, as the basis of all experience. Beyond these agreements, Sobchack's existential phenomenology assumes a critical position toward Husserl's tran scendental phenomenology, most strongly by rejecting Husseri's "phenomenological reduction." Husseri's rationale for the re duction and for putting the natural attitude "out of play" was to question our taken for-granted reality of conventional as sumptions about given phenomena (i.e., to get "to the things themselves"). But these "things" are not really "things" in the sense of concrete material objects but rather "pure ideas of things." The phe nomenological reduction is supposed to enable us to experience phenomena as they appear to consciousness in their orig inal possibilities, freed from habitual be liefs. This would allow for a description of the invariant nature of phenomena in their virtual, rather than their actual, existence. Ultimately, subjectivity would become in tersubjectivity. It is Husserl's goal and method that make this procedure problem atic: to become objectively available for any experience, the assumed invariant es sence of phenomena is universalized and the subjectivity of experience is turned into an ideal essence. As a result, inten tionality belongs to no particular exis tence; it is bracketed outside existence and becomes located in a transcendental subject. The sum of Sobchack's critique of Husserl is that the transformation of subjectivity into an objective modality contradicts the original aim of phenomenology?that is, to ground itself in the lived-world. Since the only invariant correlation between con sciousness and phenomena is direct expe rience, intersubjectivity cannot be known transcendentally, outside of existence. Husserl's notion of the transcendental subject, an abstraction from the life world, is called an unnecessary paradox. Within Merleau-Ponty's existential phe nomenology, however, the subject is con ceived as embodied, situated, and finite, rather than as abstract and transcendental. Therefore, Sobchack claims, phenomenol JOURNAL OF FILM AND VIDEO 46.1 (Spring 1994) 61</page><page sequence="2">ogy can accept Husserl's notion of the intentional character of consciousness but must reject his idealist conception of the transcendental subject. The framework of existential phenomenol ogy drawing on the work of Merleau Ponty indeed provides a useful basis for a critique of transcendental phenomenol ogy. Merleau-Ponty emphasizes the lived body and proposes a concept of intentionality that is dynamic, concrete, and situated, both materially and histori cally. The transcendental and static struc ture of intentionality in Husserl's model accounts for the possibility of sense and meaning; whereas conceived as a dynamic existential function, it manifests itself in the ways in which it actually constitutes a signification. A primary issue in Merleau Ponty's writings is perception, as in Phe nomenology of Perception and The Primacy of Perception. He defines percep tion as an organizing activity of an embod ied intentionality; it is always already an expression of intentionality and as such an interpretation. Perception is also synaes thetic and synoptic?that is, there are dif ferent modes of perception, such as seeing and hearing, that are unified in the lived body as an entity. Modes of perception are co-present, co-operative, and commut able. Vision, which is only one particular modality of perception?one form of ac cess to the world?is differentiated from other modes, such as hearing, but not isolated from them. Seeing never occurs in a "pure" state, as it were, since modes of perception co-exist and co-operate in the living subject, who does not only see a world but inhabit it. This way of understanding perception has crucial consequences for theorizing repre sentation and signification in film. Much of this theorizing has deployed methods and metaphors, such as frame, window, and mirror, that focus on vision and the visual and thus ignore those aspects of the film experience that cannot be described in visual terms, although they are signifi cantly present and interactive with the visible. Existential phenomenology, as it is ap plied to the cinema, proposes an active viewing subject and advances a method that describes the subject not from with out but from within. Observed from the outside, the spectator may appear to be passive during the film experience. Yet, seen from within, the subject is neither empty, for it is informed by life-worldly experience and charged with intentional ity, nor passive, because it cannot be so readily manipulated by the film. Furthermore, existential phenomenology emphasizes the primacy of the life-world. One must understand the act of viewing and the viewing subject as situated in a social and historical world. Every subject lives a perceptual encounter with the world it inhabits; and this encounter pro vides the ground for the perceptual expe rience of the film. These are some of the major ways in which existential phenomenology criti cizes and modifies transcendental phe nomenology. Yet existential phenomenology itself may and must be subjected to critical examination. Sob chack's critique of Husseri's transcenden talism is justified, but a legitimation for an existential film phenomenology requires not only a critical distanciation from the original source but, most of all, a valid and convincing application of the established terms. In this respect, the substance of Sobchack's book falls far behind the tran scendentalism it sets out to criticize and supersede. In the end, Sobchack's work appears as a mystical metaphysics. The core of one major problem is im planted in the very definition of the film experience?as a dynamic and transitive engagement of an object of vision, an act of viewing, and a viewing subject. This definition is spelled out more concretely and boils down to the notion of a mutual 62 JOURNAL OF FILM AND VIDEO 46.1 (Spring 1994)</page><page sequence="3">Constitution of the viewing subject and object in the act of viewing: the intending gaze both affirms the object of the gaze and the subject of the gaze. It is convincing to argue, at least in the framework of phenomenology in its broad est sense, that the constitution of the film as a meaningful object requires the subject to engage in the act of viewing. But it is problematic to conclude that because see ing is intimately entwined with being, see ing incarnates being and that the viewing subject is constituted by the act of seeing. The underlying rationale for this conclu sion is the notion that vision includes both an inflective and a relective/reflexive mode. As Christian Metz has explicated in The Imaginary Signifier in discussing his notion of the "double movement" of pro jective and introjective modes of vision, vision provides access not only to the world but also to oneself as a subject. Metz's observation is accurate, but there is a crucial difference between having vi sual access to a constituted entity on the one hand and constituting this entity through the visual capacity on the other. One difficulty with this notion is that it contradicts Sobchack's definition of the lived-body/subject as "being in existence" rather than being through vision. It ig nores the definition, proposed by existen tial phenomenology, of perception as synaesthetic and synoptic. In so doing, the concept of vision is reaffirmed in the monolithic sense it assumes in contempo rary film theory, which Sobchack's exis tential phenomenology attempts to challenge. Furthermore, the notion of the mutual constitution of subject and object in the act of seeing undermines the claimed primacy and priority of experi ence in the life-world as that which pre cedes and informs any encounter with a film. Finally, in a more general sense, it seems questionable to propose, within film theory, concepts of the subject and its experience that claim, or at least imply, universal validity (i.e., as within and out side the cinema). In other words, if the notion of filmic experience is superseded in the sense that a film theory attempts to exceed the frame of reference established by its own terms, then this notion inflates the description of the film experience to a general description of human existence. There is a tendency in contemporary film theory, particularly in the work of Jean Louis Baudry and Stephen Heath, to transform the relationship between theory and its object. Sobchack's book falls into the same trap. These are some of the internal paradoxes and inconsistencies within the concepts and methods of Sobchack's study. My major objection, however, concerns the ends to which these methods are applied. Considering the existential phenomenolo gist's interest in the life-world and the lived-body, one would expect Sobchack's work to turn toward the spectator engag ing in the viewing experience that is situ ated in the life-world. But her argument actually proceeds in a quite different direc tion. Her central goal seems to be to establish the cinema itself as an embodied subject. This is achieved both conceptu ally and rhetorically. Throughout the text, film and cinema are personified, in an obvious mode of anthropomorphism, as quasi-living beings and subjects. Sob chack understands a film as literally being able to "see"; its vision implies a "body"?meaning the camera, projector, and accompanying mechanisms (else where referred to as "organs")?and its visual nature constitutes the "film as spec tator." As Sobchack says, "The camera and projector and all the intervening en abling mechanisms and technology are synaesthetically synopsized as the film's body" (206). In a lengthier quotation, Sob chack elaborates: A film possesses its own being, has being in the sense that it behaves. . . . Finally, the frame?that "invisi ble" trace of the activity of the film's seeing?actualizes both the film's op JOURNAL OF FILM AND VIDEO 46.1 (Spring 1994) 63</page><page sequence="4">erational and deliberate desire to see and to show, to perceive and ex press?at its "highest level," actual izing through the reflective vision the deliberative intentionality that trans forms the operative and signifying ex perience of consciousness into the signification of conscious experience (135). A central question should be whether and where in film we might have a moment of intentionality, since this question hinges on whether and how the film might trans form traditional concepts of the aesthetic experience. But certainly this question is not solved by merely assuming, as Sob chack does, an "intentional view of tech nology, a view which animates mechanisms with human function and sig nificance." Such a view is suggested by Merleau-Ponty in his essay "Film and the New Psychology" and is taken up in Sob chack's book. But even if it were appro priate to draw an analogy between the correspondence of film and cinematic technology, on the one hand, and the relation between human perception/ expression and human physiology, on the other, it is illegitimate to draw a cross analogy that equates filmic and human perception, or cinematic technology and human physiology, for such a view can never escape mystical anthropomorphism. Yet this is precisely what Sobchack does. She confuses and collapses human and cinematic consciousness to the point that she sees in cinematic ontogeny a recapit ulation of human phylogeny. In a section titled "Film's Body: A Brief Intentional History," Sobchack draws parallels between the development of cinematic technology and the devel opment of the human lived-body from infancy to adulthood, because both are involved in the similar existential and intentional projects of perception and its expression. Both enable profi ciency and competence in the realiza tion of signifying power and its possibility (250). The author moves from a fallacious an thropomorphism to an erroneous teleol ogy when she writes, "The film's body matures in its perceptive grasp of the world, in its physical hold upon being, in much the same manner that the human body matures" (168). The film is made into an analogue of human existence and is imputed with a psyche. Sobchack seems to suggest that it makes no difference in our encounter with an "other" whether it is a human being or a film. A related danger in this fallacious anthropomorphism is the tendency, im plied in Sobchack's approach, to super sede filmic genre theory by a psychological theory of personality. This is suggested when the author compares certain film styles with the mentalities, for instance, of the exuberant physical adoles cent or of the merely autoerotic and nar cissistic type. This critique of Sobchack's project dem onstrates that we need to be very careful with our methods, analogies, and meta phors. The Address of the Eye is a para doxical case of how the cinematic medium, despite the explicit endeavor to theorize it in concrete material and phys ical terms, is first abstracted into a mere idea, and how this transcendental concept of the cinema suddenly comes alive as a metaphysical being. Harald Stadler Munich, Germany Vivian Sobchack responds: I am compelled by Harald Stadler's ex tremely careful misreading of The Address of the Eye to respond to his charge that the book offers a "mystical metaphysics" and "anthropomorphic" description of the cinema, inflating this description to en compass human being. First of all, the book is hardly a metaphysics; it is grounded in a materialism that Stadler ignores completely, given that he nowhere 64 JOURNAL OF FILM AND VIDEO 46.1 (Spring 1994)</page><page sequence="5">acknowledges my lengthy insistence on the material differences between human embodiment and cinematic embodiment, as well as the intentional similarities of their common projects in the film experi ence: that is, the fact that in that experi ence both spectator and film perceive and express the world in an organizing and organized presentation and representa tion. Indeed, in an extended phenomeno logical analysis of Lady in the Lake (taken as paradigmatic of all cinema), I take pains to demonstrate that the common project (not embodiment) of visually perceiving and visibly expressing the world through vision materially realizes itself quite dif ferently in the humanly embodied specta tor and the technologically embodied film. The result is that the cinema's vision can not be seen visibly?materially?as hu man vision even though its essential structure and function (the intentional cor relation of the visual and the visible that irreducibly links the seeing to the seen and implies a reciprocity between them) are enough like that of human vision to allow for the cinema's intelligibility. Indeed, I find Stadler's oversight of the major semiological and hermeneutical project of The Address of the Eye a blind ness that seems determined by his own Husserlian desire to get to some "pure" description of "the things them selves"?in this case, "the cinema itself." Rather, I am bent on describing the "film experience"?an experience that irreduc ibly links human intentionality through mediation (of one's own body and an other's technological body) to an orga nized and thus meaningful vision of the life-world. Previous film theory has not been able to explicate the original capacity of the cinema to signify; it has dealt only with secondary codings and taken as given the fact that films signify anything at all beyond their brute play of light and shadow. My purpose in The Address of the Eye was to ground the original signifying power and essential intelligibility of the cinema in the medium's ability to make objectively visible for the first time the way in which our own ever-active and mobile human vision?materially embodied and there fore always situated, finite, and perspec tival in its grasp of "the things themselves"?perceives and expresses meaning in relation to its interests in the world. Thus, rather than inflating my de scription of the cinema to encompass hu man being, my project is just the reverse. I describe cinema as a visible model of the dynamic and directed structure of inten tional human being (of which vision is only one modality). It is this modeled correla tion between film and spectator, that en gagement of two "viewing views" and "viewed views" (the spectator's and the film's), that makes a film intelligible and gives the film experience its meaning as such. And it is this correlation that consti tutes the film in our experiencing of it as a "subjective object"?or "quasi-sub ject"?with whom we engage in meaning ful dialogue. If this is a metaphysics, then I am guilty?although, given the time I spend on explicating the similarity of structure and functions and the difference in material realization of humans and films, I am hard-pressed to see how mys ticism enters this picture. Even my discus sions of the "invisible" in the film experience are grounded in the material limits imposed on vision by its concrete and situated (though mobile) embodiment. Stadler seems particularly upset that I have discussed the film experience's ma terial premises for commuting seeing to showing, or perception to expression, as embodied. Because I suggest that not only the spectator, but also the film is embod ied, he charges me with "anthropomor phism" (and, in a cheap shot, takes a passage out of its modifying context to prove it). Again, Stadler seems purpose fully to neglect an early and major section of the book in which the term "lived body" is defined very specifically in terms JOURNAL OF FILM AND VIDEO 46.1 (Spring 1994) 65</page><page sequence="6">of a functional materiality that I demon strate is available to filmmakers, specta tors, and films alike. In the chapter titled "The Act of Being with One's Own Eyes" (which details a phenomenology of embodied vision in the human subject), I refer to Richard Zaner's description of the four fundamental ways in which the body perceptively engages us in the world: First, the perceptive body is the "bearer of the orientational point, O, with respect to which other objects are organized in the spatio-temporal sur rounding world." Second, the perceptive body serves as an "organ of perception," that is, as a single technology with several sensory fields, that provides "that means of which" we have access to the world and it exists for us. Third, the perceptive body is an organ of perception that, by virtue of its corporal unity, synthesizes the several sensory fields as the place "on and in which my fields of sensation are spread out." Fourth, and last, the percep tive body is that which actualizes volition and signifies through gesture and language the intentionality of consciousness. This is a phenomenological description of human embodiment that I find particularly useful and open in that it enables us to understand how we come to understand the film's technological body (camera, projector, and screen) in the film experi ence as conscious and intentional in its organization and motility in relation to the world it sees and shows us. Thus, the following chapter, called "Film's Body," deals with a phenomenological description of the technologically embodied vision of the film, a vision sufficiently modeled on the human lived-body to manifest, how ever differently materialized, the visible, visual, and motor behavior of an inten tional subject (however anonymously and transparently perceived). Stadler would reject this description as anthropomorphic. Yet all of us who expe rience that "object" we call a "film" do so not as if we were experiencing the technological mediation of a slide under a microscope. The microscope is experi enced as a technological object and we see through it. A film, however, is also expe rienced as a technological subject. That is, we see with it. (And here it is important to point out that this doesn't mean we see with the filmmaker, for the latter's human vision is objectively transformed by tech nological mediation and can no longer be said to "belong" just to the filmmaker). In sum, Stadler's distaste for my recognition of the similarities as well as the differences between films and the human beings who make them and see them leads me to wonder where he thinks films come from and how he would explain not only their intelligibility but the visual (and some times audible) dialogue we always have with them.</page></plain_text>
