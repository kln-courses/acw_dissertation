<plain_text><page sequence="1">Identification in Bereavement * Thomas D. Eliot Northwestern University The Concept "Identification."?The term identification refers to all mental processes in which a sense of self as distinct from other, or of other as dis tinct from self, emerges. If one recognizes or absorbs an experience as part of that which he accepts, controls and defends as "self," the operation or experience may be called introjection, following early psychoanalytic terminology. If one re fuses (consciously or unconsciously) to recognize, include, or accept, or if one cannot control, some experience as part of the self or ego, it is considered as out side, alien, or is imputed to the environ ment or to another being. Processes in volving such rejections, exclusions or im putations are called, following Jung, pro jection. This inclusive use of identifica tion (as literally "identity-making" or demarcation of self and other) was de veloped by the writer in a paper appear ing in 1927V1 Subsequent (sociological texts have unfortunately limited the term "identification" for the most part to its introjective meanings and contrasted it with "projection," while "projection" has been limited to situations of illusory im putation. In bereavement one becomes aware of how much a part of him was the one who is now apart from him. Bereavement is here defined as referring to those situ ation processes in which a person sud denly feels separated irrevocably from any natural communication with some person to whom there was affect-attach ment. Here we are concerned with family bereavement by death. The literature of bereavement is as ancient and perennial as that of self hood, but modern systematic psychologi cal analysis of grief seems to begin with Freud's Totem and Taboo (1918) and Mourning and Melancholia (1925). In Totem and Taboo, Freud, writing of the repressed ambivalent hostilities detached from their object by the latter's death, said: "This unknown hostility, of which we are ignorant and of which we do not wish to know, is projected from our in ner perception into the outer world and is thereby detached from our own person and attributed to the other." F. A. Shand's The Foundations of Character contained an extensive analysis of behaviors in volved in the emotion of sorrow.2 Identification and Role Theory.?One * Abridged from paper presented before the Annual Meeting- of The Midwest Sociological Society, 1953. iCf.

ELIOT variety of fear of death or of the dead seems attributable to the subject's il lusory empathy (or "introjection-projec tion-introjection") with the corpse,? imputing to the corpse as "actual" an awareness of cold, corruption, and so forth, which actually originates within the mind of the living subject. One is reminded of a macabre marching ditty of the first World War ("The worms crawled out . . ."), chanted perhaps as a bravado effort to rid or "callous" the feelings by projection, rejection and pur gation (catharsis). Subjectively, both re sistance to and acceptance of cremation, embalming vaults, and so forth, may be similarly motivated by illusory or pro jective empathy. Formal (and religiously correct) burials are said "to lay the ghost." But perhaps this is a projection of the actual process in which a guilty memory-imajge in the bereaved is allayed and the tension "appeased," or "exorcis ed," or repressed. Animism (anthropomorphic projection), which imputes life to what we would call inanimate objects, is easier still in the case of a body, recently alive, especially if the culture already provides a belief in a separable anima or image-self for each person. If there is in the bereaved some floating anxiety, hostility, guilt, envy, and/or fear toward the deceased, the latter's spirit may easily be endowed (by projective identification) with a spiteful, hateful, or punishing role. Some preliterates may attribute (i.e., project) to the "disembodied" but still humanoid shade a wish to repossess a body (i.e., to introject a new identity). Such beliefs might operate as both cause and effect of the mediumistic "possessions" called "controls" and "communicators," usually "identified" as deceased spirits. The present writer has, in another place,3 noted secondary (delayed) re sponses of the bereaved which correspond to "well-known" personality mechanisms named by the psychoanalysts. Thus: "(5). Identification (introjective). E.g., stepping into the role of the deceased, or carrying the spirit of the deceased on into life. (6) Transference and substitution (in volving projection). E.g., reattachment of affections to new mother, child, or spouse; espousal of charities or causes." ilntrojeetive identification accentuates bereavement trauma, a point which Wil lard Waller made thus: "Where the in teraction between a pair is such that one depends upon the other for decisions, for his hatreds and his passions, this one be comes a sort of feeling organ for the other; this is a common enough relation between a pair. The dependent one lives the better part of his life by taking the role of the other person; now the one in whom he has lived vicariously is tak en away. When the dependent one is left alone, his life is blank indeed. The emo tional dependence may be one of love alone, so that one person lives in the other almost completely, and that other is very much a part of him; such a per son has a most difficult problem of re adjustment, perhaps can only readjust by finding another love object."4 Here, prior introjection makes self-equilibrium dif ficult to restore. It is important to note that in bereave ment both introjection of new roles for themselves, by the bereaved, and their projection of new roles upon others, oc cur.5 Memory of the role of the deceased, a previously introjected experience, may now be projected as the continuing role of a "real" other.

Competing images of the lost one may accentuate a family change."6 The work of mourning consists in part of accepting as lost the loss which the bereaved has at first had difficulty in accepting. Such psychic assimilation is introjective identification as contrasted with denial, rejection, repression, which are forms of projective identity-defense. It was the great psychiatrist Adolf Meyer who, referring to a bereaved woman's recovery, said: "I am glad to hear that she has been able to assimilate her ex perience." In terms of role theory, one might say that recovery consists in so redefining (i.e., setting the limits of) one's role, as to re-motivate conduct in an actual situ ation recognized as now minus the loved one. The self does not remain fixated as of the bereavement date. Aboulia, anomie, lack of interest or will may now disap pear. Protectively regarded, the process involves the reconditioning of responses toward a new or substitute love-object, literally projecting upon the new object traits or memories derived from the ear lier love-situation. The new love is con ceived in a similar role or alter-identity. This identification may or may not be confirmed in actuality. One form of readjustment, noted by Waller,7 is the regression of an ego-iden tity to an aggressively ego-centric role. Waller further noted the tendency to glorify the former role and personality of a deceased person, especially if a child. "The good do not die young. The young die good." A child who lives con tinues human with changing imperfec tions; a child who dies (as Gunther's), is appreciated like a truncated statue; its imperfections are conceived (projective ly) as perfect in posse.8 Mourning as Catharsis.?Turning to mourning as a gradual catharsis, we should note that it is projective, by con trast with the introjective (gradual ac ceptance) aspect of the processes pre viously stressed. What no longer is or can be is normally extruded as present fact, though as memory it is re-accepted as a new reality.9 In so far as one's pre vious identifications have introjected one's family as such?i.e., as an entity and identity transcending any member's identity?there is a possible fly-wheel in the mechanism of personality, the momentum of which under bereavement may serve to carry the bereaved past the "deadpoint." Acceptance of a death as real is itself a form of introjective identification. However, acceptance of death as real may be accompanied by one or another form of projection: i.e., repression, sub stitution, and so forth.10 These projective mechanisms include such pardonable tendencies as considering every dead soldier as a hero, wishful thinking about war reports, reducing the sense of loss by devaluing the thing lost, or by re moving from consciousness the event of loss by removing from consciousness the thing lost, escape from the fact of death by forgetting, distraction, pretenses, fan tasies, and suppression of all reminders. These facts suggest a paradoxical quality of grief, the ambivalent conflict of impulses to introject and impulses to project, in a confusing situation-process where the bereaved is groping for a re vised identity and/or attempting to maintain or restore his former role by fixating the status quo ante.11 Beliefs in immortality are clearly based on wishes for continued identity ?one's own or others'?projected into a spatialized future or not-yet-land. Occa sionally people will justify such beliefs by the evidence of almost universal 6 Ibid. 7 Waller, op. cit., 510. 8 Of.

A final stage of recovery for the bereaved con sists in re-orientation of his self-role in the community. What the culture expects of the be reaved creates roles which may be accepted (introjected), or rejected, or merely feigned. 10 This theme has been developed by the present writer in "Of the Shadow of Death," op. cit. 11 "Note, please, a distinction between efforts to perpetuate one's sorrow and the very dif ferent effort to perpetuate either the love-object itself or the purposes and s:ernificance of the deceased. The former seems like futile morbidity to most of us ; it is bad mental hygiene. Per petuation of tne love-object, on the other hand, may be attributed to the natural wish for re union, i.e., the 'wish for response,' or to a fear of admitting- one's own mortality, or to iden tification of the body with the person." Eliot, in Becker and Hill, op. cit., 649. If one has sincerely projected a heaven and one's lost friends therein, or accepts the validity of spiritual ist seances, it may serve a useful therapeutic purpose.</page><page sequence="4">10 THOMAS D. ELIOT craving for continuity as relief from fear or loneliness, or by the argument from God's alleged omnipotence-plus-omni benevolence. The need for control by threat of revenge or by promise of re ward may also "keep alive" our de ceased fellow men: if evil prospers, we need continuity of identity for its per petrators as a deterrent of their be havior patterns.12 Another aspect of the ambivalent con flict of impulses toward introjection and projection may be seen in the phenom enon of bereaved spouses reverting to the role of affectionately dependent son or daughter. This may be interpreted as revealing that the role as spouse was a transference of filial dependence from the parent to the other spouse, in whom were "found" (or projected) the identi cal or similar traits or role found in the previous father- or mother-image. It may also be interpreted as revealing the existence of latent repressed or suppress ed roles in a fissible personality which, painfully shocked by bereavement as spouse, escapes from the spouse role into its former self, introjects this former role, and identifies its ego therewith. The phenomena of sorrow are illum ined by the identification mechanisms being described in these pages.13 One type of sorrow may be called "combat ive," in which anger is directed upon an external "cause" or scapegoat, i.e., doctor, nurse, relatives, or God; in addi tion, boss, government, or the "system" might be mentioned. This is projection again: intention is imputed. Another type of sorrow is directed against one self: self-blame. Here one part of the self projects intention and (guilt upon another part. The self that blames is cleared. The spontaneous choice of such mechanisms may be based on tempera ment or on life-habits; they rest on the underlying projective assumption that "somebody willed to injure us," and per haps on the assumption that punishment will somehow slake one's intolerable craving to vindicate the deceased or oneself.14 In this connection, it is im portant to understand the role of iden tification reactions as therapy. As Rog ers had indicated, introjectively "The be reaved person needs to accept the pain of bereavement in order that grief work may be done." Projectively, "That he may release the tensions which distress him, he needs an expression of sorrow and loss, the verbalization of feelings of hostility and guilt, and catharsis of the fear of insanity. Before he can resume a meaningful existence, he needs eman cipation from the deceased." 15 He notes that identification with the deceased may take the form of imitating his last behaviors, or even of discovering in one's self disapproved traits of the deceased. The bereaved then hates himself for these traits. Rogers also cites the opin ion of psychiatrist, Dr. Henry Brewster that the bereaved's feeling of worthless ness, of aboulia or of a meaningless world may give him a sense of his own self dying,?a variety of introjective identification (empathy) with the de ceased. Rogers has listed a number of process es, both pathological and therapeutic, in which we can see (or project!) one or another aspect of identification. This list, corroborating the findings of the present writer and of Fulcomer, may serve as a convenient summary of this discussion of the introjective and projec tive character of identification in be reavement.16 1). A counselor who is "acquainted with grief" can really sympathize? i.e., introject the experience of the bereaved. The bereaved, sensing 12 Naive efforts to comfort a corpse?by clothing-, food, honor, and so forth?are further evidence of projective imputation. Mothers bereaved sometimes stubbornly or comnulsively try to warm or nurse a child's body, their own responses and need-satisfactions being con ditioned to the previous living-, i.e., responsive, identity of the child's role. The wished-for re sponsiveness and need are fantasied and projected upon the body. The living, interacting ge stalt is illusorily perpetuated by "filling in the gap." 13 This discussion of sorrow follows that of Becker, A Social-Psychological Study of Be reavement, op. cit.,: Becker's study in turn was indebted to Shand, op. cit. 14 In this connection it might be noted that for voluptuaries of grief there may even be a sort of masochistic pain-pleasure. Fulcomer (op. cit.) reports cases of this type which de liberately fixated on a painful memory, forswearing- "present" and "future." Here we may have a kind of identification resembling that which Becker earlier dubbed empathy or even "unipathy" ; or, a desperate wish to maintain the lost relationship at the expense of one's own now seemingly worthless role and identity. 15 Rogers, op. cit. "Rogers, Ye Shall Be Comforted, op. cit., 56, 29, 31, 32, 39, 43, 44, 45, 46, 53.</page><page sequence="5">MIDWEST SOCIOLOGIST 11 this identification, can give his con fidences more freely. 2). When the bereaved idealizes the de ceased, there is projection of and fixation upon the memory-image role. 3). When the bereaved expects a child to grow up in the likeness or role of the deceased, there is projected identity. 4). When resentment or self-blame for the loss is displaced on (e.g.) the doctor or the "exploiting" employ er, there is projection of willful neglect or malice. 5). In self-blame one self may hate the other for secretly hating the de ceased, and one's identity is split. 6). Viewing a loss "objectively" pro jects the deceased back in the time dimension: he is no longer an ac tual part of the bereaved's present self. But as loss, the event is now assimilable: the fact is accepted as a part of experience and is now in corporated in the self in a new way. 7). Immortality is a projection of a role into the unknown?by a map which may not correspond to the territory. God, as used in therapy, may be conceived as a projected complex or self, with a wish-fulfilling or prob lem-solving or goal-providing role. 8). "Making others' prayers our own" is a form of introjective assimila tion. 9). Concessions by the bereaved are projective catharsis or expectora tion?with a sense of riddance of tension or burden. 10). In renewal of the spirit, rebirth, one discards (projects) the soul's earlier mansion and identifies himself with (introjects) the new role. 11). "Delayed grief" identifies a second loss with the first loss, and at last introjects it, subjectively.</page></plain_text>
