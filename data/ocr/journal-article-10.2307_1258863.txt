<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE NEW OXFORD HISTORY OF MUSIC, Vol. I, 'Ancient and Oriental Music'. Edited by EGON WELLESZ. O.U.P., 1957. Pp. xxiv, 530; bibliography; illus. THIS, the first volume (but second to be published) of eleven in the great series which will survey the history and development of music throughout the world, should be examined by every serious folklorist. The English folklorist, who has come to regard folk-song and dance as territories distinct from lore, may often be heard to say he knows nothing about 'music', and to ask why should he know anything of it? Neverthe- less, divesting himself of the metropolitan conception of the term, he will find in this book a ground which he will recognize as common to his own studies, the ground from which music rises as a magic power, wherein the stock and stone give forth the voice of the spirit animate with- in them, where the instrument fashioned by man may, at its humblest, speak with the voice of the tree and the reed, and at its most august with the voice of the deity. There is scarcely a chapter which does not deal in one respect or another with these magical aspects of music, whether amongst primitive 207</page><page sequence="2">REVIEWS AND NOTICES people (by Marius Schneider); in the poetically evocative, and difficult study of Far-Eastern music by the Cambridge biologist, Laurence Picken; in the immensely detailed descriptive histories of Sumeria, Ancient Egypt, the Middle East and Islam by Dr H. G. Farmer; the technical and philosophical examination of the music of India by Dr Arnold Bake; or the brilliant reconstruction from much theory and a handful of musical fragments of the nature and use of music in Ancient Greece by Mrs Isobel Henderson. Through all these, also, runs that other capacity of music, the aphrodisiac power of certain sounds, in which the sound of the flute everywhere predominates; and, by a trans- ference of idea, there runs parallel the sexual symbolism of instruments, which, since it follows a naive anthropomorphism, provides a language of amatory metaphor understood the world over, surviving to this day even in the idiom of the English people. The History is intended for the layman as well as for the professed student of music: but the layman will not find the contributions of the nine different authors equally apprehensible, nor the bibliographies equally systematic. Much additional bibliographical material is, in fact, relegated to the copious footnotes. While each chapter is furnished with illustrative plates, the reader, bewildered by terms which in different countries have different significance, needs to have at hand a lavishly illustrated and descriptive compendium of musical instruments, such as Curt Sachs', to which to refer. In connexion with The History of Music in Sound H.M.V. (in the United States by R.C.A. Victor) have issued a companion volume of 78 r.p.m. discs providing musical illustrations related to those in the text. MARGARET DEAN-SMITH</page></plain_text>
