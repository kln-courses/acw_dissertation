Abstract - Resume In this article, we have tried to incorpo- rate acoustics, together with music, within the framework of the genealogy of science (phys- ics). We have also stressed the insufficiently noted contribution made to physics, acoustics and musicology by the Croatian-Bohemian physicist, Vinko Dvoifk; we have tried to por- tray him in detail. In including acoustics in the mentioned model, we have used the philosophi- cal and historical method of research, with spe- cial respect to modern tendencies in science, even taking them as our basis. We have pointed out the necessity to stop the general trend of ne- glecting acoustics, formerly a branch of physics, and, within the framework of the mentioned model, re-establishing its importance. In this way, the unique essence of science would be expressed. Key Words: Genealogy of Science; Acoustics; Music; Sound; Light; Space; Time; Terminology 1) On Genealogy One of the first scholars to introduce the term 'genealogy of science' in the Croatian history and philosophy of modern science (from 1800), and to present it in the form of a model, was the distinguished Croatian scientist-physicist and phi- losopher, Ivan Supek (1915) (SUPEK 1974). He used an original term, genealogy of science (in Croatian &gt;&gt;rodoslovlje znanosti&lt;&lt;), and it referred to natural sciences. The global scope of the genealogy of natural sciences means a system of laws: the 183</page><page sequence="2">184 B. HAN2EK: GENEALOGY OF SCIENCE AND ACOUSTICS, IRASM 35 (2004) 2, 183-210 Euclidian System, Newton's Principles, Geometric Optics, Thermodynamics, Chemical Elements and Textures, Maxwell's Equations and Theory of Relativity, the System of Biological Species and Evolution, Quantum Mechanics, and Molecu- lar Biology. The author nevertheless stressed that he did not aspire to give the completeness of the data, and that the multiplicity of scientific discoveries is scat- tered along that genealogical tree. Globally, one of the best known books in which the development of physics is brilliantly shown in the historic model from Greek cosmology to Galileo-Newton-Maxwell-Einstein physics is Max Born's Die Relativitatstheorie Einsteins und ihre physikalischen Grundlagen&lt; (BORN 1922). It was excellently translated by our distinguished mathematician and physicist, Danilo BlanuSa (1903-1987) (BORN 1948). Equally valuable, but considering par- ticularly the mechanistic aspect of Nature and the world, is the book by A. Einstein and L. Infeld, &gt;Die Evolution der Physik (EINSTEIN - INFELD 1950). The key characteristic of scientific genealogy is that any given field of science could not have developed before some other did. That means, for instance, that Newton's mechanics could not have developed without the existence of the Euclid system and astronomic times, Maxwell's equations without Newton's concept of force, etc. After determination of the scientific genealogy, the explanation follows. I. Supek points out that the thinking of a human being is connected with his/her complete activity. Humans move, move objects, build, observe, listen, and all that labor has crystallized in certain concepts and words. Supek stressed that the epis- temology is an act of creation, that is, that all knowledge is more than a reduction of a given set of events or statements to known principles. Knowledge does not only result in new systems of laws that can be reduced to known ideas or percep- tions, but widens the world that Humankind is a part of. In his other book, Supek revealed his ideas under the term 'genealogy of physics' (SUPEK 1979). He em- phasized that different branches are organically grown together making a unique tree or genealogy, stressing the role of mechanics. From mechanics, as the base, electrodynamics, etc. develop and grow. It could be said metaphorically that me- chanics is the root of the complete tree of physics. Supek answers a crucial ques- tion in this connection: was such a development of the tree necessary? He points out that it was, and regards the sequence of scientific laws as being deeply deter- mined. I. Supek stresses in the Introduction to his book that the first branches of re- search - geometry, statics, optics, thermodynamics, mechanics, astronomy and technology - are closely connected to everyday human work, as is determined by biological structure and voluntary activities (SUPEK 1980). However, as Supek points out, physics did not remain at that first level. Discussing the interconnec- tion of the branches, Supek emphasizes that Newton's mechanics is the basis of comprehension, but that Einstein's and Heisenberg's mechanics is comprehended with the aid of Newton, with the result that even classical mechanics is differently comprehended from what Newton thought would be the case. Supek points out that one of the aims of the historical viewing is to show that physics has its geneal- ogy, and its model is open modeled«.</page><page sequence="3">B. HANZEK: GENEALOGY OF SCIENCE AND ACOUSTICS, IRASM 35 (2004) 2, 183-210 In the book by Ivan Supek and Miroslav Furid (1941), the interconnection of some of the branches of physics is emphasized, within the genealogy of physics, with the explanation that they provide the basis for each other (SUPEK-FURIC 1994). They included the modern development of physics in that model through the quark structure of matter, based on the Standard model of physics of elemen- tary particles and their interaction. It is pointed out that what was first developed (mechanics and geometry) permanently remains the source of the whole geneal- ogy of physics, and the science of Nature as a whole. It is emphasized that the branches can not be reduced one to the other. Lower branches (mechanics) are independent and developed, without references to higher branches. Nevertheless, that does not mean that development of higher branches does not influence the modern understanding of the lower ones. The book stresses that the ideal is to achieve the unity of physics through interactions of all its components. Stating that physics originated from daily phenomena or processes, the authors stress that, in this way, the development of physics influenced the history of the world. They claim that with our biological structure as human beings, and especially with our senses, we are connected to Nature so that, through certain activities within our environment, we were bound to develop classical mechanics and optics (and acous- tics, which is my expansion of the model). Taking all this into account, the authors emphasize that such a genealogy was the only possible one. I. Supek points out in his book that his approach differs from those of philoso- phers of science who try to reconstruct or reduce research to certain models (SUPEK 1994). The author stresses that the genealogy of science is what gives us an impor- tant criterion in judging what are true, and what are false leads in research, when we discuss the philosophy of science and its consideration of human history with already developed research. Supek emphasizes that science is not sufficient, and in order to understand better human culture, imagination, creativity and motiva- tion, we have to turn to art. Without music, literature, and the visual arts we could not understand human everyday speech and Man himself. It is well known that expression through everyday speech is one of the aims of the philosophy of sci- ence, that is, the aim is to find a common expression of global human activity. The distinguished Croatian scientist - philosopher and historian of science - Jasmina Lelas (1939-1998), points out in her article that Supek's genealogical model is a good illustration of what has been created in science throughout his- tory, that is, that it is a good illustration of the so-called philosophy of the history of science (LELAS 38/1992). She also introduced the term 'historicity of science' into the Croatian methodology of the research into the history of science. In the cited article, J. Lelas has shown the genealogical model of development of (natu- ral) sciences, pointing out that this model is a special explanation of the history of science. Emphasizing the role of the historicity of science, J. Lelas pointed out that it leads to the historicity of the understanding of science. The author compared Supek's genealogical model with Toulmin's concept of continuous genealogy of science, emphasizing that there are differences between the two. J. Lelas compared Supek's and Toulmin's evolutional continuity with Kuhn's socio-psychological 185</page><page sequence="4">186 B. HANZEK: GENEALOGY OF SCIENCE AND ACOUSTICS, IRASM 35 (2004) 2, 183-210 model, in which Kuhn regards the development of science as a revolutionary process of the alteration of paradigms« as a discontinuous sequence of specific units of development, disputable and temporary. Jasmina Lelas stated in another article that I. Supek managed in his work to bring closer the perception of the scientific enterprises we observe through human characteristics (LELAS 40/1992). It is im- portant that many human active abilities are embodied in science, and the geneal- ogy of science is a specific history of human experience, as J. Lelas points out when speaking about Supek's genealogical model. A distinguished Croatian scientist, philosopher and historian of science, Srdan Lelas (1939-2003), dedicates an off- print from the conclusion of his book (LELAS 2000) to the genealogy of science. He points out that I. Supek got the idea of the genealogical tree of science in 1974, when, without referring to evolutionary analogy as Toulmin and Hull did, he ex- plained his idea through insights characteristic only to him. S. Lelas emphasizes that Supek's genealogical tree of science does not grow out of either spiritual or populist concepts, and not even out of proto-theory. That tree springs, just as sci- ence does, from human co-existence with the world. As Srdan Lelas points out, the question of whether the genealogical tree should branch in this manner was raised not only by Supek, but also by Heisenberg as well. Nevertheless, without any doubt, I. Supek pointed out that the key determinant of scientific genealogy is a certain determination of order. And Supek's answer to the question of whether the gene- alogy of natural sciences could be applied to the Humanities and Social Sciences is negative. Despite the unity of science, Supek points out, the role of human will&lt;, its freedom, prevents us from analogously extending the genealogy of science to human psychology and history&lt;&lt;. It should be pointed out that Heisenberg, more than anyone else, discussed the concept of the responsibility of a scientist&lt;. Supek emphasizes that human survival as we developed through history is unique, but perhaps one could speak of two separate trees (natural and humanities-social) with roots and branches sometimes interlocked. S. Lelas indicates that the genealogy of science seems different from actual historical development, as does Heisenberg's development of physics, which relies on major, complete theories as units of de- velopment. What makes the difference between these two ideas and real historical development is ignoring abandoned theories (for example, Aristotelian physics). Generally, though, there are no obstacles to giving a hint about those big dry branches. Srdan Lelas thinks that the genealogical model as a model of develop- ment, with appropriate addition, could turn out to be closest to real history, and points out some other advantages. These are: not supposing ultimate purpose, not leaning on deductive but parental unity, allocation between rationalistic and anar- chistic models, and, in that way, avoiding their extravagance and one-sidedness. S. Lelas compares the genealogical model with Kuhn's model, pointing out that, in spite of all the similarities, there are differences, because Supek, contrary to Kuhn, allows social relativism. And from Supek's model and the fact that it originates from human practice, it is transparent why the development of science is cumula- tive, besides being irreversible. From it we can see why geometry precedes me- chanics, mechanics precedes electrodynamics, and classical physics precedes quan- tum physics.</page><page sequence="5">B. HAN2EK: GENEALOGY OF SCIENCE AND ACOUSTICS, IRASM 35 (2004) 2, 183-210 2) Why Acoustics and Genealogy Agree - Philosophical Insight a) The Present Situation In the present times of growing diversification of science (including physics), some not very positive tendencies are appearing. Due to the loss of the sense of a wider concept, physics neglects not only some questions arising from other fields of science (for example, the history of physics), but, as it seems, neglects its own disciplines. Does that not happen with the physics of sound (acoustics)? The an- swer is probably yes. Due to the mentioned characteristics that are growing stronger, physics itself is the cause that only technology is concerned with acoustics. Physi- cists show no enthusiasm for acoustics and are actively engaged and digging deeper in other fields of physics. It seems as if they have no strength, or intention, to bring other fields of physics closer to acoustics. Modern acoustics is not in danger (con- trary to other techniques) of separating humans from Nature or from other hu- mans. Quite the opposite, in fact. The fact that people like music is a sufficient reason for acoustics needing music, because acoustics without music lacks sub- stance and is empty, while music without acoustics is almost blind - to para- phrase Kant. With the help of music, acoustics orients Man back to Nature (every- thing is full of sounds - except a deaf Universe - a place not designed for a pleasant life) and to other people (music is created for as many people as possible and is appreciated by almost everyone). Acoustics helps music in orienting Man back to Nature with its technical aspect, with the expressed common goal of com- pleting human life with hi-fi technology, either analogous or digital, easily accessi- ble nowadays, by help of which noise as such is eliminated by technology itself. And all of that requires collaboration between musicians and acoustic physicists. If the subject of physics are the external circumstances that invoke the sense of sound in us - and the sense and experience itself are not - then we can find ourselves in an unusual (and unpleasant) situation. Namely, combination tones (especially difference tones) arise when two strong tones whose frequencies are not close enough for the ear to differentiate them as sound beats, and then we hear a third tone. As if it is assumed that this tone is issued only in the ear, and the difference of frequencies can not appear in Fourier's sequence, it turns out that there is no difference outside our ear. The problem arises in how we sense this different tone, because we can not connect it to the source. Namely, in the sound field, the tones that are the result of application of Fourier's procedure can not be described. So we feel that there is a source of the sound somewhere outside us, but still have to accept the explanation that different tones are created within us, that is, by our ear drum itself. We can state that this is due to vibration, which is the result of difference in elasticity towards the inside of the ear and the bulge towards the outer part of the ear, but that brings us into the field of physiology. Here again, the idea appears of the necessary correlation between subject and object, even prior to quantum mechanics and Heisenberg, because we must assume that change of elasticity was brought about by change of pressure, necessarily connected with the 187</page><page sequence="6">188 B. HANZEK: GENEALOGY OF SCIENCE AND ACOUSTICS, IRASM 35 (2004) 2, 183-210 source of the sound. Everywhere that combination tones are mentioned, it is em- phasized that they were first noticed in 1714 by the musician Giuseppe Tartini (1692-1770), and later described in 1744 by Georg Andreas Sorge (1703-1778). They were again noticed by Tartini in 1754, so, after him, we now use the term Tartini's tones. But, there are also subjective tones which, as has been pointed out, were discovered by scientists - but there is no mention of which ones. These subjective tones come about as a result of the action of the ear, when the source sounds indi- vidual tones. The sliding tone (original term: der Schleifton) discovered by the Croatian physicist of Czech origin, Vinko Dvorak, who worked from the late 19th to the early 20th century, also belongs here. It is worth mentioning that an impor- tant factor in the development of physics was the so-called modern end of the 19th century&lt;, which refers to the blossoming of the science of electricity and acous- tics. V. Dvorak was a disciple of the well-known Ernst Mach (1838-1916), and is famous in these disciplines. As is known, the positivistically oriented physicist and philosopher E. Mach reduced all objects, and even processes in Nature, to only sensory perception of the subject. His great authority inspired and initiated formation of the famous Vienna circle, which is noted for its neopositivism (or logical positivism). Popular philosophers of mathematics and logic in philosophi- cal circles are the positivists L. Wittgenstein (1889-1951), R. Carnap (1891-1970) and the Englishman B. Russell (1872-1970). K. Popper (1902-1994), who was very important in the philosophy of science (together with the above mentioned T. Kuhn) (1922), did not belong to the Vienna circle, but was connected to it through his work (SARDAR 2001). It is not so well known that E. Mach was a spokesman for a simpler end-user adapted science, directed towards ultimate human goals. And that occurred when physicists were included in industrial and military research. In science, nevertheless, Max Planck's (1858-1947) idea predominated, and that was a more autonomous science not hindered by any adaptation. Who would in present times, when acoustics is mentioned, think of it as a part of physics? Who, not to mention students of physics or engineering, knows of the Croatian-Bohemian physicist Vinko Dvofrak? Should history of physics be written by professional historians, or should this task be taken over by physicists (even if they are called amateurs)? Questions arise, but the point is that we should know what to do to answer them in part - even if we are not able to answer them fully. One must admit that a professional historian has more to say about causality in history, but it is doubtful whether he can surpass an amateur in judging the im- portance of a given historical event when the subject is physics, and its importance within the framework of global history. Physics, when classic disciplines were in question, used to be classified with reference to sensory manifestations: direct per- ception, movement and tactile perception - mechanics, tactile perception and sen- sations of warmth, caloric and thermodynamics; sight - optics; hearing - acous- tics, electromagnetism - for which Man does not have direct senses, but which still belong to classic disciplines. Modern disciplines in physics (the theory of rela- tivity, quantum mechanics, atomic and nuclear physics, solid state physics) have no problems with neglecting some disciplines, because they are still scientifically</page><page sequence="7">B. HANZEK: GENEALOGY OF SCIENCE AND ACOUSTICS, IRASM 35 (2004) 2, 183-210 attractive and can be utilized in any respect. In its beginnings acoustics was, apart from physics, also connected with music. At present, the connection between mu- sic and acoustics is only partially certain. Acoustics today is largely connected with electro acoustics, and not physics. Nevertheless, as far as musicians and admirers of music are concerned, there are even fewer people (fewer than before) who con- nect acoustics with music. In trends of democratic and global commercial proc- esses, acoustics comes with domestic hi-fi. That speaks for itself. Unfortunately, it is becoming more and more obvious that the same is valid even for physicists and musicians. Taking that trend into consideration, the questions arise: does physics need acoustics and does music need acoustics? It is for physicists to decide which branches of physics are more important than others? Are the tendencies (viewpoints) of modern physicists gradually to forget acoustics, or will the development of sci- ence need acoustics again? Yet another question to answer: does the modern ten- dency to explain everything by fractals give a final standpoint? Is such effort really required for that purpose, and does it all have any use? This holds especially if it is almost certain that the future could bring some advanced points of view. These questions are very hard to answer. The prejudices of modern Man encircled by mass-media connect the concept of acoustics only with sale of hi-fi lines of better quality. However, if we can not deal with prejudices, let us try mending the conse- quences. To claim that modern Man does not require understanding of acoustics because it is the arbitrary product of acousticians makes as much sense as if we claimed that only musicians understand music, even without acoustics. And the key point is that everyday people and acousticians should separate techniques from ideas, which would not be all that complicated. And by constantly neglecting the fact that acoustics belongs within the framework of physics, we deny ourselves one source of knowledge, and slowly but certainly lose understanding. We lost the meaning when we divided physics into disciplines (branches) and started empha- sizing the differences. It is a mere unestablished delusion that, by over-emphasiz- ing other disciplines in comparison with acoustics, we acquire any more signifi- cant knowledge, and all that due to the fact that modern physicists who regard acoustics as being interesting are rare. It is like trends in fashion. Even Nobel prizes are awarded for disciplines that proved most futile, that is, for which top scientists showed most interest by publishing scientific works more than abundantly. Some even find interesting the physics of golf, as can be seen in some published books - since golf is popular and in fashion in some parts of the world (JORGENSEN 1999). Momentary interest in physics should not throw shadows on other disci- plines, and consequently on scientists dealing with them, even from narrow spe- cialist-professional circles. For them (disciplines and men) that is not simply the end of history, regardless what others think about the almost forgotten ideologies they belonged to. There still exist common people and top scientists who do not share that opinion. But the problem is that the majority of them are silent for the present. Only integral physics will have appropriate meaning and understanding, based on amateur physicists writing the history of physics, and on competent pro- fessional dealing with the science. The process of education of young scientists 189</page><page sequence="8">190 B. HANZEK: GENEALOGY OF SCIENCE AND ACOUSTICS, IRASM 35 (2004) 2, 183-210 should be such as to make them historians on the one hand, who talk about the past while also foretelling the future, and, on the other hand, scientists who observe development and accurately determine the degree of achievement of associated sciences. And this would only be made possible by making personal contributions to both. In this way, we have answered previous questions and shown that we know what to do, and yet another question arises: Do we do that? In order not to proceed at the same pace: question, answer, question, answer - let us break that chain and return to the beginning, to the pre-scientific research age of antique times. b) The Pre-scientific Research Age of Antiquity - PROTOSCIENCES From ancient times people have been occupied with listening and watching. As pictures from ancient Egypt show, music and music-making were popular, and the instruments used were the harp, flute or lute. However, we do not know much about Egyptian music; more relevant records were left by the ancient Greeks. Auditory and visual perception are mentioned. But, sense of hearing and sight are connected with sound and light. And why do we emphasize hearing in this arti- cle? Here is the answer! Although it is known today that the information capacity of sight is a hun- dred times greater than that of hearing, what justifies primarily visual orientation, the major communicational form of understanding among people, has developed connected with auditory perceptions. The fact that the ear is approximately a hun- dred times more sensitive than the eye (in the meaning of required energy for sense) contributes to it. Besides, it can be argued that, from the very beginning (birth), it is more important for intellectual and emotional development to hear properly than to see (JELAKOVIC 1978). People who used speech in communicat- ing with each other gained the advantage over those who used the optical system (gesticulation and mimicry). It is as if people were aware of the fact that, unlike other organs, the ear is an excellent analyst, very sensitive to changes of pressure. Apart from that, a man can be heard without being seen, so any other special outer source, such as an optical system, is not required. Humans soon perceived that the possibilities of acoustic speech were such that, together with all that has been pre- viously mentioned, it also became an instrument of the human mind. However, together with speech, humans have always appreciated music as well. All that tells us that acoustics should have been paid more attention from the outset. c) Comparison between Sound and Light In spite of the fact that the way light and sound spread is similar, sound is in the strictly scientific and philosophical sense different from light. In the scientific sense, hearing differs from sight because acoustic theoretical laws are less in har- mony with knowledge of these laws than optical ones. For example, why do we</page><page sequence="9">B. HANZEK: GENEALOGY OF SCIENCE AND ACOUSTICS, IRASM 35 (2004) 2, 183-210 hear combination tones that are incurred in the ear, and can not detect them by instruments (they have no resonance!). It is not the same case with light, since everything we see can also be detected by instruments. In the philosophical sense, acoustic laws differ from optical laws because, in some instances, we can claim that the source of sound is outside us, and inside us in others. That means that we have a philosophical aspect of the law, where the source of knowledge of reality is immanent - rooted in us and transcendental - and goes beyond us, that is, is outside us. In the transcendental sense, we go beyond reality that can be exactly measured by instruments. When speaking about optics we can only say that the source of light is outside us, that is, the transcendental side of the truth, since we can not feel the source of light inside us. Here we leave aside some mystical effects connected with light, and remain on the solid ground of science. If we consider the historical aspect, it is interesting that it is in acoustics where philosophy can ex- press its credibility in relation to science. And do it better than any other discipline of physics, disregarding acoustics itself, since the knowledge of quantum physics is not required for explaining acoustics, but it is required for electroacoustics. Hence, if it is close to the truth to state that there is no knowledge of philosophy without knowing its history, then it is even closer to the truth - according to modern concepts - that without the knowledge of electroacoustics there is no knowledge of acoustics. But, even if we used electro-experimental methods supported by math- ematics to explain, for instance, Dvoiak's sliding tones, we still can not give a more comprehensive answer than Dvorak had prior to discovering these tones. Is that not reason enough for sound (acoustics) to become the subject of study for philosophy, when its susceptibility to experimentation and mathematics is not evident? We can hope it is. d) Comprehension of Space and Time with the Accent on the Essence of Time (What is time? Does it actually exist?) Space and time, as fundamental forms of existence of the real world, have always attracted the attention of scientists (and, prior to scientists, of philosophers). And philosophers have always asked questions about space and time. We are es- pecially interested in the puzzle of time, because it has special importance in rela- tion to space. The big question is: What is time? It could be said that the concept of time includes a unique sense of secrecy, which makes our challenge even greater. If we accept this challenge and try to answer the question of what time is, we will be undertaking an impossible task. Namely, nobody has ever given a complete answer to that question, although many have tried to define time. With the at- tempt to answer why everything does not happen simultaneously, all attempts to explain time perish. In the simple meaning of the word, the way one understands it, we grasp the concept of time by comparing the duration of various phenomena. Here, duration means a measured time interval that can be added and subtracted. 191</page><page sequence="10">192 B. HANZEK: GENEALOGY OF SCIENCE AND ACOUSTICS, IRASM 35 (2004) 2, 183-210 This comprehension is the only possible way by which we gain practical use. Meas- uring of time is the only purposeful activity. The exactness of physics is reflected in the fact that how time is defined is not crucial to physics, but rather how it is measured. In brief: time is what is determined by measuring - its own picture of the world of physics, as real science, expressed by its own concepts defined by operational definitions (HOFSTETTER 1997). By comparing different durations, different relationships are accomplished. To make those derived relations certain, physics requires the help of mathematics. But, after reaching certainty, we retire from our real world and lose something in doing so. And that something is the expression of our world. So, it is necessary to define time as a sequence of intervals of arbitrary dura- tion, where, for example, heartbeats, trickles of water, or seconds can be taken as units of measurement. Still, some details are common in spite of the fact that we do not know what time is, but can try to measure it. Strictly speaking, there is no measuring of time in the metrological sense. The reason is that time can not be compared with some other time«, which means that the time interval between two events will never occur again (BREZIN(iAK 1971). Here we tacitly apply the assumption (follow- ing the mathematical concept of time) that we always calculate time in relation to a given time null point« which we regard as a source. In this way we define the direction (the arrow) of time. Tomislav PetkoviC has written studiously and inspir- ingly about topics connected with time (PETKOVIC 2001). However, any attempt to measure time basically leans on periodic (cyclic) events. That is already an essential step away from the mathematical concept of linear time (that also appears in some interpretations of historical development). Still, with periodicity we avoided one problem: from history, that is, the linear flow of time that carries our present, we can not see the connection between before and after, that is, we can not see the directedness of our momentary existence simply because there is no interval. All linearity springs from the assumption not to stop time&lt; that flows inevitably and regularly. Only the creation of a periodical repetition that stops linearity makes it possible. In the root of this historically old idea is the conviction that time in its essence is cyclical (WHITROW 1885). In other words, completely equal time intervals between events must be created. In mod- ern terminology: to create seconds. The modern concept of time is still mathematical, due to universality and fun- damentality, although people first measured time intervals using - in their opin- ion, the invariably stable - periodical process (change of day and night, rotation of the Earth around the Sun, etc.). Precise modern clocks perform periodical proc- esses as well, and the ultimate goal is to create as many identical repetitions of certain periods as possible. So there are mathematical, astronomical, philosophi- cal, musical, physical, thermodynamical, biological, historical, psychological, and cosmological concepts of lapses of time. The book by Moritz offers an interesting discussion about the last five arrows of time« (MORITZ 1998). And even after</page><page sequence="11">B. HANZEK: GENEALOGY OF SCIENCE AND ACOUSTICS, IRASM 35 (2004) 2, 183-210 quoting all those concepts of time, we still can not be sure that there is not yet another. We actually speak of moments on an axis, and we suppose that a scale that measures time is defined, so we speak about all the quoted times (scales - that define change of course of time in a certain direction). But, the music scale is special, even in this division. When music is discussed, one usually points out that it is based on a sort of scale, as an ordered sequence - from low to high tones, or vice versa, with intervals between them. But, the music interval in question here is more a pause in frequency than in time, from the scientific point of view. From the artistic point of view, and that is more important, tones, that is, music notation that represents those tones, are arranged in such a way as to result with the maximum and, at the same time, optimal number of pleasant tones - which is a mystery that art successfully keeps hidden from the strict eye of science. And while physicists measure their time with clocks, musicians measure their feeling of rhythm with metronomes (a mechanical device, that is, in fact, a clock with a pendulum, so that the course of time can be heard and seen, as opposed to a digital one, where time intervals can only be heard). The periodicity of flow can be seen through the fact that the pendulum swings from left to right, swinging from and arriving at one fixed point in space. The time measured in that sequence is called a cycle or period. By counting the left-to-right swings in one second, one arrives at the number of vibrations to which we attribute physical value called frequency. It is useful to note that one vibration includes two swings. If we suppose that the arrow of time points only in one direction, that is, that time passes only in one direction, we can conclude that time is what is determined by measuring of time. But, to tell the truth, it would be more accurate to admit that we do not measure time, but measure frequency connected with periodical repeti- tion of time intervals. Albert Einstein (1879-1955) pointed out that space and time are interlocked into space-time, but, with homogenization of physical dimensions, he pointed out the particularity of time in relation to space. Musicians also wel- comed the connection between space and time, the particularity of time in relation to space. In music notation, tones have duration that can be precisely represented on one axis (time), while pitch of the same tones in the diagram could be repre- sented as a space dimension on the other axis. Tone (frequential, thus time deter- mined) has yet another important dimension - height, that is expressed as space dimension. Recent music theories operate with the terms null-time and null-space (ALEGRIJA 1987). For those theories, time is not only a sequence of present mo- ments that are separated, but open towards one another. And as one dimension of space goes in two directions, time should behave in the same way, so that space and time would again be encompassed and interlocked together. The historical dimension in connection of tones with space should be emphasized (because with time this connection becomes obvious), as it existed even before instrumental mu- sic. From the beginning of Humankind, music was the human voice that surpassed and dominantly enlarged its range in space, depending on effort. Even today that characteristic of voice is emphasized, so that distinguished singers overpower« 193</page><page sequence="12">194 B. HANZEK: GENEALOGY OF SCIENCE AND ACOUSTICS, IRASM 35 (2004) 2, 183-210 the whole orchestra - all the instruments. Due to the progress of science (acous- tics) we know that we speak of the formant of the voice as the term that can de- scribe as briefly as possible what we have stated above. At this point, the role of astronomy should be pointed out, because the fact that we measure time with a clock does not mean that we determine time as well. After measuring a time interval with the clock, we still do not answer the question of what the starting moment of measuring was (LOPA§Id 1991). Astronomers de- termine time as the moment of transition of the observed star through the merid- ian of the observer's position (one exactly determined unprovoked event). Later, the process continues with calculating and transferring calculated time to an astro- nomical clock (which can be a combination of an atomic and a quartz clock). We are governed by signs of exact time with respect to that combination. In this man- ner, our clock becomes a reservoir of time when stars are invisible, or when astro- nomical observations are not performed. This remark about astronomers only emphasizes the historical importance of the question of who first started to meas- ure time, and how, and, since astronomy is the oldest science, it is obvious that this primacy belongs to astronomy. Today we regard the second as the basic unit of time, and it is determined per definitionem in atomic physics, by introducing the caesium frequency standard, so that the periodical process can be almost endlessly repeated and counted with great precision, giving an incredible margin of error: 1 second to 3 million years (COLOMBO 1995-96). Consequently, physicists can uniquely (by agreement) meas- ure time intervals as accurately as possible, so that astronomers can record time as well as possible, so a definition of the SI second is agreed upon (the physical or atomic second). And thus, by measuring, we gain that important time interval. Of course, interval here means the time span between two events that forms the basis for measuring of time. If we again take history to be the witness of truth, one must admit that musi- cians were the first who tried to determine the duration of one second (POHL 1958). During the 17th century in a monastery in Bologna, two monks attempted to measure one second. They had a trained sense of time, since they conducted the orchestra during mass. Their task was monotonously to count: one, two, three in such a manner that the pronunciation of each number was to last exactly as long as ten swings of the pendulum clock. In that way, due to their excellent sense of the time span of one second, that second was measured rather accurately. e) Some Remarks Regarding Language and Terminology To make acoustics understandable to everyone by way of analogies and pic- tures, some hypotheses of acoustics must be translated from abstract to our every- day language. Terminological expressions as substrates of scientific language that were is- sued by separation from everyday language, also show, to some extent, an absurd</page><page sequence="13">B. HAN2EK: GENEALOGY OF SCIENCE AND ACOUSTICS, IRASM 35 (2004) 2, 183-210 lack of precision. For example, the term technology« was used originally to mean a method of processing raw materials into final products, while today it means applying scientific methods and results to the manufacturing process. So, instead of becoming more specific, that is, precise, the term technology« by transforma- tion from generally intelligible language to a specialist one, becomes less intelligi- ble. That imprecision inheres in the tendency to idealization, in other words, the expression of essential categories to which we do not yet have satisfactory an- swers. Namely, we still can not answer with certainty the question of what science is. But, if we compare science with philosophy, we find that science educates by means of textbooks, while the use of textbooks is not the only necessity for phi- losophy, where the original works are also used. Is it an advantage or disadvan- tage for the scientist that writing textbooks has a by-product as well, and that text- books become a kind of standard for terminological expressions - and one should adhere to them strictly and irrevocably. Another question arises here: does the need for such standards exist in philosophy, or not? In connection with the ostensible need for a new language that would include new terms (especially in quantum physics), I. Supek believes that everything con- nected to the world of atoms must in the end be expressed by everyday language (PETKOVII 2002). Supek's teacher, the Nobel Prize winner Werner Karl Heisenberg (1901-1976) also gave a negative answer to the question of the need for a new lan- guage, when concepts of atomic physics are being considered. In relation to quan- tum mechanics, everyday language with added precision and correctness (that only quantum mechanics can yield) is the best possible one. We know as regards acoustics that, in its first literary appearance, the Greek word (akustikos) had a strong anthropomorphic meaning, and was directly con- nected to people, music and music instruments. It is common knowledge that the Greek philosopher Pythagoras (born in the 6th century B.C.) did some practical experiments with a monochord that was very similar to music instruments of that time. Ancient Greeks knew that sounds are derived from the air, which could be felt from empirical attempts at observation and contact with vibrating surfaces. However, let us try to put the question in the modern sense: What is acous- tics? Prior to attempting to give an answer, it should be pointed out that acoustics can be comprehended in a wider and in a narrower sense. But, let us start by con- sidering the term in the modern sense. In its one-time sense, the word acoustics first appeared in 1657 as the title of a book, but its meaning included hardly any- thing that we today would call acoustics. As late as 1693, Samuel Reyher (1635- 1714) used the word acoustics in the sense that encompasses the present meaning of the word in his work De natura et jure auditus soni« (BRUDERLIN 1978). But, it was Joseph Sauveur (1653-1716) who in 1701 interweaved the word acoustics into modern scientific language, speaking about the tones of the music scale, and thus introduced this word into common use (KORBLER 1957). The title of his work was Principes de acoustiqe et de musique«. The most unusual circumstance was that J. Sauveur was born deaf, and was mute till the age of seven. Nevertheless, due to a miraculous development, he performed important acoustic experiments. 195</page><page sequence="14">196 B. HANZEK: GENEALOGY OF SCIENCE AND ACOUSTICS, IRASM 35 (2004) 2, 183-210 Sauveur was the first to suggest the name acoustics for the science about sound. He paid attention to the natural accord of the major scale from the basic tone, and founded the music study of harmony and parallel tones. By use of scientific de- scription of mathematical form, he discovered the method to determine the number of vibrations of the unknown tone, when the number of vibrations of the second tone, and the number of vibrations of both tones when sounded simultaneously are known. 3) Interdependence of Acoustics and Genealogy - Historical Insight a) Interplay of Science, Music and Acoustics The universal science in ancient Greece was philosophy, and differentiation between music and acoustics was far away. Then, with the approach of modern times, the permanent divisions we discussed earlier took place. Individual sciences (e.g. mathematics, physics, etc.) separated from philosophy with expanding branches (amongst them acoustics). As far as physics is concerned, it was used to study Nature. Later, the scope of interest gradually expanded and focused, but narrowed as well, while other sciences appeared and developed as fields of au- tonomous research (astronomy, chemistry, etc.). Physicists today do not investi- gate Nature generally, but only some of its separate sections that largely include energy. The contemporary physicist does not limit himself to simple description of objects and phenomena, but tries to explain them. As acoustics became more com- prehensive, and interest in it more lasting, other sciences and arts regarded acous- tics as a point of contact. In short, new divisions resulted with, apart from physical and music acoustics, many other acoustics as well. And so, while considering com- mon features of music and acoustics, we closed the circle in such a manner that, through historical analysis, we were in the situation to accept the inevitable cur- rent divisions. So, as mentioned earlier, written scientific research of music began with the efforts of the ancient Greeks. Historically, the most popular among them was Py- thagoras, whom we mentioned earlier. In accordance with his philosophical be- liefs, Pythagoras and his disciples regarded the whole Universe as harmony and number. Regarding the number as the essence of everything, Pythagoras gained a great reputation among contemporary mathematicians, most of whom thought he was the first who seriously dealt with mathematics and developed it. Pythagoras studied and compared the proportions of lengths of string of the monochord, at- tributing them to certain intervals (in the sense of music)! It should be pointed out that the ancient Greeks introduced the notion of proportion, and that the Babylonians knew the concept of quotient (i.e. the proportion of equal values of the same sort), but not of comparison (i.e. equalizing two ratios, which is what proportion actually is). Pythagoras discovered that by shortening a tight string by half (i.e. by pressing it in the middle), we heighten the tone by an octave, and by</page><page sequence="15">B. HANZEK: GENEALOGY OF SCIENCE AND ACOUSTICS, IRASM 35 (2004) 2, 183-210 shortening it by 2/3 heighten it by the fifth, or 4/5 heighten it to the third, or in short, if lengths of strings are in simple ratios, pleasant tones are produced, or we would say that the tones are in harmony (HONDL 1940). Here the difference (in- terval) between two tones is produced separately in time. An interval can also be produced simultaneously. The ancient Greeks did not discover that the mentioned ratios represent ratios of frequencies, that is, that frequency of the string as op- posed to frequency of the string for the tone an octave higher 1/2) and, similarly, for the fifth and the third. Thus, the ancient Greeks spoke about harmony of numbers. But, if we want to examine and view music and acoustics together, we have to emphasize some curi- osities in connection with the music interval. Acoustically - to use music termi- nology, and according to modern scientific perception - intervals are invariant (constant) melodies. If we align intervals from the basic tone (which is the basic and the weakest tone of lowest frequency) to higher values, we gain a range of intervals that form a music scale. It is not our intention to point out details about Dorian, Phrygian, Lydian and Mixolydian, or the natural or chromatically tem- pered scale, because people with music education are familiar with it. We will point out some less stressed, but still interesting details. Natural intonation is good, but that advantage is lessened in transposition (skips are not uniform). The aim is to achieve uniform skips, or, as musicians would call it, uniform tempering. The modern uniformly tempered twelve-tone scale has an interval of approximately 1.059 (21/12), that is, the numerical value for which each one of the twelve half- tones is increased in relation to the previous one. That means that if frequency for the basic tone C is 1, then Cis is 1.059, d is 1.059 x 1.059 = 1.122, etc. ending with c, which is 2 (octave interval). But Weber's experiments from 1820 have shown that the human ear differentiates relative frequencies in the ratio of 1 001 : 1000, for example, 1.001, which is 50 times less than the accepted interval. With a fairly simple mathematical algorithm it can be proved that, for example, 8 more keys could be put between c and d, and the ear would still register well newly created intervals (or, it would register 2 tones, one of which is by approximately 5.4 savarts higher than the other). The mathematical theory of continued fractions resulted in the best approximate solution of the problem of optimal numbers of tones in the octave, as the practical optimum, 12 tones in one octave (with the seventh tone as the perfect fifth - because our intention is to preserve harmonious fifths). Two other solutions of the optimal number of tones in the octave are: 29 tones (with the 17th tone as the fifth) and 41 tones (with the 24th as the fifth) can not be utilized due to technical problems. But, electronic performance is not burdened by such difficulties, and so-called micro-tone composers of electronic music use a scale with 41 so-called micro-tones (§IKIC 1999). The range of the human voice is gener- ally two octaves, and only tympana among music instruments have a smaller range, while uniformly tempered machines with 88 keys (52 white and 36 black) have almost the broadest range. Musicians will immediately recognize this machine as the piano. Only large organs have absolutely the greatest range. Their range reaches the range of sensitivity of the human ear, and is over 10 octaves. 197</page><page sequence="16">198 B. HANZEK: GENEALOGY OF SCIENCE AND ACOUSTICS, IRASM 35 (2004) 2, 183-210 So it was music that brought to acoustics the demand for invariance of the interval. In order not to be trapped by measuring the same music effect by differ- ent numerical values (as would happen if we assumed the interval to mean the difference between tones), musicians demanded introduction of intervals in the sense of the ratio of frequencies of two tones. Here, musician versatility enabled acoustics to develop. Although nowadays we know a lot more about acoustics, the question arises as to how deep&lt; our knowledge is, that is, as to how sound our understanding of our knowledge really is. Namely, it is not clear that we, sup- ported by racing development of mathematics and the analogy of electrical type, have the advantage in explaining acoustic phenomena. In spite of piling up knowl- edge, it is not clear whether it enables us to understand better. The question arises as to whether the science about acoustics has developed sufficiently to make con- sideration of general questions about the mode of epistemology a guarantee that we understand those phenomena better (connected with source of sound, the me- dium through which the sound wave spreads, the sensation that is transmitted and thought about sound). b) Duality of Historical Development of Acoustics It is important to note two kinds of historical development: development of concepts in acoustics and elements of application of acoustics in analysis of phys- ics, which is the subject and form of acoustics as a separate science. Acoustics strives to limit its field of research. Acoustics penetrates into the picture of the world it strives to create alongside inheritance of scientific research and perception arising from the world of music. In music, as everywhere else where we strive for general accessibility, one should differentiate technique from ideas. No one can play Bach properly without previously mastering the technique. But, everyone who listens to Bach's music can feel its greatness, in spite of not knowing how to play. Contemporary science admits the necessity of the historical approach for edu- cational aims, but regards it as insufficient, since further development requires more than necessity. One must practice science seriously because the fundamental characteristic of progress is forecast, based on continuous re-examination of new discoveries. It is not important to know the historical factography of tendencies, but to be scientifically sure in forecasting the tendencies - as is the view of the majority of contemporary scientists. In spite of the fact that in some sciences there is an attempt to abandon the historical approach, a better (not to say more ideal) substitute is yet to be discovered. It is common knowledge that the ubiquitous Galileo Galilei (1564-1642) ex- perimented with slopes. He studied the motion of spheres down a slightly sloped smooth incline. Only slightly sloped, because then the motion is slower, and thus easier to measure. But, since his incline was approximately 2 meters long, and its end raised only 10 cm, the time of the rolling of the spheres had to be measured (LEDERMAN-TERESI 2000). But, such short intervals require a chronometer, and</page><page sequence="17">B. HAN2EK: GENEALOGY OF SCIENCE AND ACOUSTICS, IRASM 35 (2004) 2, 183-210 it was only invented 300 years later. Thanks to his musical education, Galileo, with the help of observing musical rhythm, reached a sense of error through practice, as soon the rhythm became faster or slower by 1/64 second. Further, he stretched strings across the incline at certain distances. How can one stretch a 'string'? While rolling down the slope the sphere passes over cords, which is accompanied by sound. Galileo rearranged the cords until he achieved the sounds that, according to his music impression, were in exactly equal rhythm. When he later measured the distances between the cords it was obvious that they increased with geometric progression. Although the time interval between the sounds was always the same, the distance from the beginning to the second cord was four times larger than the distance from the beginning to the first cord, 9 times larger to the third cord, and 16 times to the fourth cord. Collaboration between scientists and musicians can be seen from the example of the French physicist Felix Savart (1791-1841). Savart loved the violin, was edu- cated in music, and was the first in history who regarded the violin as an acoustic apparatus. He was also the first to use the term resonator« for its body (ANFILOV 1966). He even purchased a Stradivarius violin and experimented with it. He was the first to discover that the resonator of the violin from Cremona is tuned to the C of the first octave (also to knocking and blowing, even without chords). But other parts of the resonator sounded differently. He experimented with the newly-in- vented steam siren and was the first to determine the limits of the sound we can hear by the unconstrained ear. He noticed that Stradivarius's violin was incredibly well-tuned. He tried to make a prototype himself, but had to seek help from a French craftsman. It was a straight untwisted violin, without gentle bulges (in the form of a trapeze). But, in spite of the fact that it sounded well, musicians decided not to play on it, because it reminded them of a coffin«. And this was despite a positive opinion from the French Academy of Sciences. Nonetheless, Savart is, to- gether with Biot, known for his law in the field of electromagnetism. It is only rarely known that he performed experiments in acoustics, and stood for absolute determination of frequencies of tones. In the era of Vinko Dvorak we mentioned earlier, the analysis of sound was carried out with Helmholtz resonators (hollow, metal or glass spheres) of varying sizes and slots, that were brought close to the ear, and in that manner, with excel- lent hearing, the frequency was determined. Nowadays, due to the forceful devel- opment of electroacoustics, harmonic analysis is carried out with selective devices - harmonic analyzers - with which we read our frequencies and amplitudes of members of the harmonic sequence. Finally, if we know all the members in the Fourier's sequence (i.e. all amplitudes and frequencies), we can foretell the form of vibration of the cord for an arbitrary future moment with certain physical limita- tion (given the initial displacement and speed of the cord). And the 1960s gave us a synthesizer that can produce different combination of higher harmonics for each frequency, and thus simulate any music instrument. Since it can be programmed digitally, the synthesizer can be played by pressing certain commands only. 199</page><page sequence="18">200 B. HANZEK: GENEALOGY OF SCIENCE AND ACOUSTICS, IRASM 35 (2004) 2, 183-210 c) History of Acoustics in Antiquity The first tone man noticed most certainly was that of a tight cord of a bow. The oldest musical instrument, the harp, is actually nothing else but a tight bow with one or more strings. In music it was always an important issue when more tones sounded together harmoniously. Musical harmony is also in parental rela- tionship with the laws of physics. Ancient Pythagoreans conjectured that long ago. But, they did not experiment in the modern sense of the word, and that is why they could not grasp the relationship between length of strings and number of vibrations. The only thing they perceived was a relationship between the pitch of sound and length of the strings of a monochord. In the times of the ancient Greeks, Aristotle thought that phenomena that cause a sense of sound can be described, that is, represented by the idea of thickening and thinning of the air, what was in accordance with his idea of continuity and infinite divisibility (discussed in his famous work Physics), and movements are actually transmissions of infinitely small jerks. Aristotle (384 B.C. - 322 B.C.) asserted that sound is transmitted by means of the air in totality, and not that only some parts of air are required. He was also aware of, and mentioned, the observations from which a conclusion was drawn that lengthening of the pipe results in generating deeper tones. Aristotle gave an exact description of reflection of the sound in his work &gt;Problems&lt;, pointing out that, as with sound, reflection occurs with every wave motion. Vitruvius in the 1st century B.C. compared sound waves with waves on the water, enhancing Aristo- tle's idea of the role of the air, but still not considering the waves. In the 2nd cen- tury B.C. Heron was also close to understanding what sound waves were. He thought that there was thickening and thinning of the air that is transmitted through the medium. But Aristotle's physics had the wrong doctrines. One of them is that high tones expand through the air faster than low ones. d) History of Modern Age Acoustics The famous Galileo Galilei noticed that the number of vibrations (frequency) is a determining factor for the pitch of the tone. However, that was insufficient for discovering a mathematical relation between given values. The monk Marin Mersenne (1588-1648), a follower of Galileo, Newton's student and a friend of Descartes, studied the poorly known Galileo studies of sound, repeated Pythago- ras research and showed that the pitch of the tone of the vibrating string is also in relation with the density of material it is made of, as well as with its tightness. In his work Harmonicorum libri XII« published in Paris (1627-1637), the mentioned Marin Merssene also describes upper tones (overtones). Mersenne was the first to determine the speed of sound by applying the cannon method in 1636. And as far as the pitch of the tone is concerned, it was Brook Taylor (1685-1731) in 1715 who expressed in mathematical terms the relationship between frequency, tension force and length mass of the string.</page><page sequence="19">B. HAN2EK: GENEALOGY OF SCIENCE AND ACOUSTICS, IRASM 35 (2004) 2, 183-210 In his work Advancement of Learning&lt;&lt;, Francis Bacon of Verulam (1561- 1626) pointed out in 1605 that sound spreads in a similar manner as light does. In the foreword to his book about light, Traite de la Lumiere (1690), Huygens explained that light spreads in waves, and matter that can be weighed is the media through which the waves spread, contrary to light that spreads in waves in ether, which we can not weigh. Otto von Guericke (1602-1686), known for his magdeburgica« ex- periments and the air pump, proved by experiments around the year 1650 that sound spreads not only through air, but through water and solid matter as well, despite Aristotle. Athanasius Kircher (1601-1680) in his work Phonurgia nova&lt; described the laws of the reflection of sound and echo, and assumed that it is in its essence similar to light. Besides, through immediate practical insight it was known that sound waves have the ability to press thin leather or a membrane, and thus set it in motion. This was used to measure the strength of sound. The capability of such membrane to start the motion with more or less difficulty, is called specific acoustic impedance. If it is greater than that of the surrounding medium, the mo- tion of the surrounding medium piles up in front of the membrane, thus creating the pressure that rises or falls on the membrane. Our ear drum behaves in the same way. That means that the specific acoustic impedance is the ratio between pressure and motion. We also call the specific acoustic impedance - acoustic resist- ance. And we can point out that we can be grateful to V. Dvorak for all that acous- tic terminology. He noticed the effect of sound on surrounding objects, the impor- tance of giving accent to pressure, and, by mechanical measuring of intensity, cleared the way for electroacoustics. J Sauveur, whom we mentioned earlier, has also proved the truth of what the famous Ren6 Descartes (1596-1650) intelligently foresaw. This was his hunch that the cause of neighbouring tones of one vibrating string is vibration of one part of it. Christian Huygens (1629-1695), writing about light in his work of 1690 (Traite de la Lumiere), taught that sound also spreads in waves, and does that in the form of disturbance that spreads in all directions in the form of waves (KORBLER 1957). In formulating his famous principle he pointed out that the source is what causes disturbances, and every point of the wave can be regarded as the source of a new wave and disturbance. The acoustic fork was in- troduced into research of acoustic phenomena by John Shore in 1711. The specific problem of acoustics was determining, that is, measuring, the speed of sound. Pierre Gassendi (1592-1655) was the first who managed to meas- ure the speed of sound with considerable accuracy, and he also discovered that the speed does not change in relation to the source of sound or the pitch. The physi- cian Bianconi (1717-1781) discovered the influence of temperature on the speed of sound in Bologna in 1746, and that it is greater in summer that in winter. Similarly to Marsenne, he used the cannon method. Today we know that we can accurately measure the speed of sound with Kundt's and Quinck's tube. And speaking of Kundt's tube, it should be pointed out that the role of V. Dvorak has been insuffi- ciently emphasized, since he is rarely mentioned. Modern Age acoustics developed as a branch of mechanics, and that was pre- cisely and scientifically expressed by the famous Lord Reyleigh in his classic work 201</page><page sequence="20">202 B. HANZEK: GENEALOGY OF SCIENCE AND ACOUSTICS, IRASM 35 (2004) 2 183-210 The Theory of Sound«, where he described acoustics as a separate field of me- chanics. Unfortunately, from the beginning of the 20th century, acoustics has been theoretically and experimentally regarded as a closed field of science, with only problems of secondary importance remaining unsolved. All that experimental research on the nature of sound enabled us to explore music scientifically, to determine its essential components more precisely and ex- actly, and we are not far from the notion that certain development of music can occur in this way. The assumption is that other sciences should also serve in this development, musicology being a relatively recent one. The research of human speech has shown that, besides harmonic tones, there exist non-harmonic ones produced under the influence of the resonant mouth cav- ity. We call the first formants, because they form speech. When A is sung, one formant of 5000 Hz is produced, in spite of the fact that A is sung with 435 Hz. It is important to mention that even Leonardo da Vinci knew of the occurrence of reso- nance. In 1907, the pianist and composer Ferruccio Busoni wrote that the develop- ment of music is hindered by music instruments. There was an attempt to explain the stagnation of the development of music by the fact that the possibilities of known music instruments had been exhausted, and that new instruments should be invented. This hypothesis seems to be proved by the discovery of the saxo- phone, because music gained a new stimulus with its introduction. An attempt was made to introduce electric instruments. In 1811, even Beethoven wrote his Opus 91 called Wellington's Victory or Battle near Vittorio for a musical machine. After the telephone was invented in 1876, the phonograph in 1877, magnetic re- cording in 1901, and radio was developed, Dr. Thaddeus Cahill constructed the electric organ in 1906. The Clavoline&lt;&lt; music instrument can replace the cello or violin in a piano trio. The pianophon« instrument with its steel tabs produces tones that simulate magnets with their vibrations, and effect loudspeakers in the form of electric impulses. It was discovered that our ear can endure electronic music for 20 minutes at the most, and after that period it tires. The tones are too clear for our ear to feel them as pleasant (KORBLER 1957). On the other hand, such tones can be electronically produced that no other mechanical instrument can repro- duce. It is still uncertain what electroacoustics can yield, and in which way it will influence music. 4) About Vinko Dvordk and His Important Role The E. Mach we mentioned earlier sent his young assistant from Prague to Zagreb in 1875 as the first full professor of physics at the (then) Faculty of Philoso- phy of the re-established University of Zagreb, establishing the Chair of Physics. Who was Vinko Dvorak? He was born on January 21,1848 in DuSejovo, in the Nemecky Brod district in Bohemia, he finished grammar school in 1886 in Jihlava, university studies in1871 in Prague, and obtained the position of E. Mach's assist- ant. His PhD thesis (1873) was in philosophy, he habilitated the next year in gen-</page><page sequence="21">B. HANZEK: GENEALOGY OF SCIENCE AND ACOUSTICS, IRASM 35 (2004) 2, 183-210 eral physics, was appointed private assistant professor&lt;, and took over duties of the honorarium assistant professor of the University of Prague in the 1874/75 school year. The Emperor Franz Josef I appointed Vinko Dvorak full professor of the Faculty of Philosophy of the Franz Josef I Royal University of Zagreb on Septem- ber 26, 1875, the university having been established in 1874 through the efforts of Archbishop J. J. Strossmayer (1815-1905). On November 1,1875 V. Dvorak took up his position as professor of physics at the Faculty for Philosophy of the re-instated University of Zagreb, established the Chair of Physics (now the Department of Physics), and headed it up till his retirement in 1911. In that period he was the only professor of physics at the University of Zagreb. On Saturday, May 6, 1922 termi- nal gastric illness ended his tireless work and fruitful life. Two days later he was buried at the Mirogoj Graveyard in Zagreb. But, some thirty years later his grave was destroyed, so that his remains and those of his beloved wife were transferred to the paupers' field of Mirogoj, together with those of his most indigent poorest fellow citizens. The first important discovery that gave Dvorak great international recogni- tion was an article published in 1875 in Vienna. It was his explanation of the ap- pearance of gathering of particles of powder in knots of occurring standing waves, in Kundt's tube with a whirling flow of air. Kundt's tube is a glass tube of the required length and diameter, one end closed with a removable cork; through the other end a glass stick is placed and fixed in the middle of its length, while its free end is rubbed with a wet cloth. Standing waves can be produced in this way. In order to visualize standing waves, light powder is put into the tube - particles of finely ground cork. In the knots of vibrations, the occurrence of standing waves accumulates powder in small heaps. Kundt noticed all this in experiments with his tube. However, Dvorak explained this accumulation of powder in Kundt's tube with circuit flow - circulations of air caused by vibration, and the circulation is such that the air in the middle of the tube moves from the knots towards the nodes/ antinodes of the standing wave, returning vice versa along its edges. The Nobel prize-winner John William Strut (1842-1919), the physicist, better known as Lord Rayleigh, called this discovery the Dvoi~k phenomenon« in his book The Theory of Sound&lt; (which is highly esteemed even today and used in university education, although its first edition dates as far back as 1877, with reprints up to 1945). Eight years after Dvofak's explanation, Rayleigh offered the theoretical background to it, so that the described occurrence of circulation today is called Dvorak-Rayleigh circulation, that is, circulations of air in Kundt's tube. We should also mention for a complete explanation of the circulation, that the friction between the vibrating air and the edges of the tube plays an important role. If, in addition to the linear term, we introduce the term of the second order, by averaging we obtain forces that cause circulations of air. According to Rayleigh's book mentioned earlier, Dvorak's rotational sound wheel is also original. It consists of several Helmholtz resonators - relatively vo- luminous glass spheres, with small slots especially designed by Dvorak - fixed with wax to light horizontal crossbars whose central parts are supported by a ver- 203</page><page sequence="22">204 B. HANZEK: GENEALOGY OF SCIENCE AND ACOUSTICS, IRASM 35 (2004) 2, 183-210 tical spike. A special wheel is the one with three resonators with its horizontal cross- bars set up at angles of 1200, with the slots in the direction of the rotation. When such a wheel encounters the influence of standing waves of air, it will spin fastest on the points of knots vibration around the vertical axis, because the changes of pressure are greatest there and, consequently, the flow of air through the slot of the resonator is the strongest. Based on this wheel, Dvorak developed instruments with the intention to use them as gauges, that is, selective gauges of sound intensity. An extremely important discovery by this scientist is called Dvofak's reflec- tion of resonator from the source of sound, and this brought him worldwide re- spect. A suspended Helmholtz resonator in the form of a cylinder is hung on two threads and roused to resonate by an acoustic fork and resonator box, upon which the fork is placed. The air flows out of the Helmholtz resonator in the form of a ring, and flows in from all directions around the gorge of the resonator. The result is that the average force is such, due to changes of the impulse during vibration, that the resonator moves away from the acoustic fork, and the force grows propor- tionally larger with amplification of the intensity of vibration. Dvorak became popu- lar for his acoustic radiometer, too. The acoustic radiometer is an instrument adapted to measure the pressure of acoustic radiation with which the sound wave affects the surface. DvorAk's radiometer has two designs. The first one consists of three light round metal wings with slots that have a raised edge on one side in the mid- dle, and the axis of the radiometer is placed vertically on the spike. When such a radiometer is placed on the spot where the vibration of particles is strong, it starts to spin around the vertical axis. In the case of standing waves, the radiometer will spin fastest in the node/antinode of the vibration. The other design has round plates replaced with square ones, and they have 25 slots each, the intention being to strengthen the rotation phenomenon with their regular surface distribution. Dvorak's experimentally determined mechanical effects of sound are recog- nized, and, as we mentioned, have been evaluated appropriately. Another impor- tant discovery he made was that a small square plate made of cigarette paper, which can be rotated around its vertical axis, tends to take a vertical position with regard to the direction of vibration of the particles of air while rotating, although, prior to the vibration or sound waves, its surface was positioned alongside the expected vibration of air. Rayleigh re-discovered this Dvorak discovery, theoreti- cally elaborated it, and applied it in such a manner that, with the combination of a resonator and small plate, it was possible to measure the intensity of sound either selectively - only for resonance frequency of the resonator - or absolutely as well (HANZEK 2000). Some distinguished Croatian scientists have written about Dvorak (LOPAIC 1962, SINDLER 1981, DADIC 1982, ILAKOVAC 1996, HENC- BARTOLI 1997, MULJEVIC 1997). Dvor~k's standing grew when his work &gt;About a New Type of Sliding Tone&lt; was published (DVORAK 1874). Inspiration for that article came from listening to a bird (a thrush), whose very loud chirp expressed an unusual and unexpected property of the tone. When the pitch of the tone varied, then, besides the original tone, the sound of a new neighbouring tone could be heard. The thrush would</page><page sequence="23">B. HANZEK: GENEALOGY OF SCIENCE AND ACOUSTICS, IRASM 35 (2004) 2, 183-210 slide from one tone to the other so that one tone would merge into another smoothly, and not in jerks. Dvorak heard that tone again while experimenting with a pipe, changing the length of the column of air in the pipe with varying speed. By precise measuring, he determined the explicit dependence of the pitch of the tones on the length of the column of air in the pipe, comparing the tones produced by the pipe with the tones produced by jerking the cords of different lengths on the monochord. In his article he also represented that dependence graphically. After processing the results of measuring numerically, he concluded that the sliding tone (a new kind of tone called so because of its shortness) had the same pitch as the combina- tion tone, but that there were some differences. One of the components in their similarity is that they are both issued in the ear and can not be magnified like other tones. The difference between them is that, as in the case described in the article mentioned, the combination tone causes the sliding tone not to be heard, and the pitch of the sliding tone, within certain limits, is independent of the changing height of the column of air in two pipes, as opposed to the created combination tone, which is issued only by the growing length of the column of air in the pipe, and not by shortening. The most unusual characteristic of the sliding tone is that its pitch, within certain limits, is not dependent on the speed of lengthening or short- ening of the column of air in the pipe. In case of very slow lengthening and short- ening of the column of air in the pipe, the sliding tone becomes so low and weak that it is impossible to determine its pitch. Dvorak discovered that particular tone while playing the violin. He heard the sliding tone playing on the E string of the violin, thus proving the theoretical hypotheses of his teacher, E. Mach, that the sliding tone can occur when two tones of different pitches follow skipping one another. Further, Dvorak proved that he knew his music instrument very well, because in the mentioned article he pointed out that, with a violin of great quality and a strong tone, it would be possible to achieve a sliding tone even by continu- ous transfer from one tone to the other. He could not achieve this on his violin, in spite of knowing how to play it. Here he pointed out an important characteristic of sliding tones: produced tones should be as strong as possible, and that occurs only with violins of the highest quality. V. Dvor~k intensively studied electroacoustics and made several versions of acoustically damped forks that continuously give stable tones. That is especially important if we take into consideration the vibration clocks that are highly es- teemed today, where very persistent frequencies obtained by acoustic forks owe their long duration to electrical influence, and are used in many observatories. 5) Instead of a Conclusion The notion that something important can be achieved widens the human world view. And to make the basis of that worldview a growing number of accumulated facts that will, like a beacon, light up the way to the general welfare of Human- kind, one has to take into consideration integral knowledge, while not neglecting 205</page><page sequence="24">206 B. HANZEK: GENEALOGY OF SCIENCE AND ACOUSTICS, IRASM 35 (2004) 2, 183-210 certain fields in which interest has been lost and have not developed in the sense that technics, rather than natural science, have enabled their development. Per- haps the most recent research into sonoluminescence (emission of light from bub- bles in liquids roused by sound) will lead to a turnabout, and once again promote interest in acoustics, even if it be through research connected with high tempera- tures and controlled nuclear fusion. And perhaps the most recent discoveries of electrotechnics, where we speak of acoustic control of electronic devices, will be crucial for science dealing once again with acoustics, or maybe some third event will occur. In any case, the question still remains: How can one differentiate the true from the false in history, the real from the illusionary? One could expect phi- losophers of science to be close to the true answer. Even here, in acoustics, we could apply Bohr's modern complementarity principle. If we search for that essen- tial characteristic of science, that would be unique - but not in the sense of uni- formity - we must know what we will gain. The diversity of the branches of sci- ence lies not only in the expansive field of natural science, but in the set of mechan- ics (the diversity of roots). In this way we confirm the insufficiently underlined fact that none of the branches (roots) can alone express reality. But, by not ignor- ing any of the branches (roots), which is especially valid for acoustics, we can reach the goal that, with togetherness, we do not lose that powerful unique essence of science. That essence will be the more strongly expressed, the more all the diversi- ties of the branches (roots and fruit) unify with their irreplaceable characteristics. But, one should bear in mind that overemphasizing acoustics as a specialty within mechanics would move science further away from truthful expression of its es- sence. The proverb that one can not see the forest for the trees sounds wise - a game with words, which in our case can be.paraphrased into one can not see the tree for the roots. And again, as S. Lelas and Z. Vukelja nicely expressed in their book Philosophy of Science, science can not come out of itself to find a stronghold - for that philosophy would be required (LELAS-VUKELJA 1996). Namely, to see the forest one should rise above it, but then one should pay attention to the impor- tant thing, and that is that all trees are visible, because in all their diversity, but also in the completeness of every particular one, trees reflect light in the same way. In our case science will express its essence and demonstrate the union of the strong- hold of its knowledge only if, in the terminology of physics, each of the diverse branches (roots, fruits) radiates the richness of its expression, and that is what un- ion of expression would consist of.</page><page sequence="25">B.

Saietak GENEALOGIJA ZNANOSTI I AKUSTIKA UZ PRIKAZ ULOGE VINKA DVORAKA Prvi odjeljak dlanka navodi da je medu prvima koji je u hrvatsku povijest i filozofiju moderne znanosti (od 1800. godine) uveo izraz genealogija znanosti, te ga prikazao u obliku modela, istaknuti hrvatski znanstvenik-fizicar i filozof Ivan Supek (1915.). Imenovani je to uinio originalnim izrazom rodoslovlje znanosti, a odnosilo se to na prirodne znanosti. Bitna karakteristika znanstvenog rodoslovlja je to da se neko znanstveno podrucje nije moglo razviti prije nekog drugog podrucja. Ivan Supek i Miroslav FuriC (1941.) u svojoj knjizi isticu povezanost pojedinih grana fizike, unutar modela genealogije (rodoslovlja) fizike, s objasnjenjem da su jedna drugoj podloga. U taj su model ukljudili i suvremeni razvoj fizike kroz kvarkovsku gradu materije na osnovu Standardnog modela fizike elementarnih testica i njihovih medudjelovanja. Ugledna hrvatska znanstvenica filozofije i povijesti znanosti Jasmina Lelas (1939.-1998.), naglaSava da je Supekov genealoski model dobra ilustracija onoga sto je covjek stvorio u znanosti tijekom povijesti, tj. da je dobra ilustracija tzv. filozofije povijesti znanosti. Ona je, takoder, uvela termin povjesnost znanosti u hrvatsku metodologiju istraZivanja povijesti znanosti. Istaknuti hrvatski znanstvenik filozofije i povijesti znanosti Srdan Lelas (1939.-2003.) u pogovoru knjige posebno poglavlje posveCuje rodoslovlju znanosti. Imenovani istice da je I. Supek dosao na zamisao o rodoslovnom stablu znanosti jos godine 1974. kada je bez pozivanja na evolucijsku analogiju, na koju su se pozivali Toulmin i Hull, s nekoliko samo njemu svojstvenih uvida izloZio svoju spomenutu zamisao. S. Lelas istice da Supekovo rodoslovno stablo znanosti ne zapoinje niti duhovnim niti populacijskim pojmovima, pa cak niti proto-teorijom. To stablo, kao i znanost, izranja iz covjekove usade- nosti u svijet. 209</page><page sequence="28">210 B.
