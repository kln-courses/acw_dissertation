Gbttingen/Fribourg: Vandenhoeck &amp; Ruprecht; Universitits- verlag, 1987. Pp. xiv + 553; illustrated. SwF 130. The dissertation (Fribourg, 1986) was written under O. Keel's direction. Its goal is the demonstration "that the Old Testament contains surprisingly many references to representative art and to the existence of pictorial art objects in Israel/Palestine, and that these references can very well be related to archaeological finds of pictorial art originating in Israel or in its environs" (p. 423). By doing so the monograph seeks to support the broader thesis that "neither Israelite civilisation nor Israelite religion were hostile to pictures. On the contrary, the latter were able to manifest, in a manner accessible to the senses, the experience of divine fellowship with human beings... " After all, Schroer maintains that "religion derives its vitality essentially from visions and not only from auditions ... from visible, sense-perceived message and not from abstract ideas" (pp. 16-17). The monograph is based on the collection of texts which in one way or another refer to representative, visually perceived art or craft objects. It is made up of an introduction (including a brief history of research), seven chapters of discussion of relevant OT texts and related matters, a bibliography of 35 pages, indexes of authors, texts, and subjects, and 146 ink-drawn and documented illustrations. The first four chapters are the central part of the book. Here the ordering principle is phenomenological in that the discussion proceeds from representations employing forms derived from flora and fauna to those drawing on anthropomorphic or astral forms. Thus the first chapter (pp. 19-66) deals with shapes related to trees and with decorative blossom and fruit motifs. Here ashera as "holy tree;' at times combined with the "cow with calf" motif, and the various plant ornaments of Solomon's Temple are explored. The second chapter (pp. 67-158) concerns itself with animal shapes, notably those of lions, bovines, snakes, and birds, and with mixed forms, such as the cherub. Then teraphim and ephod are discussed. The third chapter (pp. 159-253) relates mostly to (partial or complete) two- or three-dimensional representations of deities in human form: the crown of Milkom, the statue of Dagon, the incised pictures mentioned in Ezekiel, the images of deities against which Isaiah and Jeremiah direct polemic, the comparison with images of the divine found in Canticles and Daniel, and references to statues of foreign gods. Finally, the fourth chapter (pp. 255-300) explores shapes derived from celestial bodies, such as sun, moon, and star constellations, but also the cakes baked for the queen of heaven, and the chariot of the sungod. The last three chapters deal with related matters, expanding and supporting the preceding discussion by setting it into wider contexts. Thus the fifth chapter (pp. 301-53) discusses more than a dozen terms which constitute the semantic field "image/image of deities,' covering both descriptive and derisive references. The sixth chapter (pp. 355-419) relates to the materials which are "carriers of images:" stone, ivory, ceramic, textiles, seals, and amulets. Finally, the last chapter (421-31) answers the question whether artists and artisans were a foreign element in biblical Israel by arguing that they were by and large indigenous to biblical Israel, acknowledged connections to extra-Israelite nations notwithstanding. The contribution of the monograph to biblical research is its comprehensive order- ing of OT texts on the topic and their judicious discussion in the light of relevant other</page><page sequence="2">748 Journal of Biblical Literature biblical and ancient Near Eastern (occasionally also classical Greek) evidence and of the (in some cases extensive and theologically freighted) secondary literature. Moreover, in relation to this topic the archaeological evidence is of unique impor- tance because it allows the visual perception of that about which the texts can merely speak, limited as they are by the medium of language. The author succeeds in illuminating salient points of her discussions through reference to the relevant draw- ings in the illustration section - a welcome but also necessary feature. Her book thus becomes an informative and reliable work of reference for various aspects of pictorial representative art in the Hebrew Scriptures. In conclusion, a comment on the relation of the monograph to the scriptural prohibition of images is in order. As indicated in its introduction, the book deals with the latter only indirectly: it demonstrates the range of visually perceived representa- tions of the divine with which the prohibition of images must have been concerned. By the same token, the author recognizes that the "word-centered" (Schroer) prohibi- tion texts are deuteronomic. As such they seek to place the divine name given to Israel at Horeb in the place of various images of divine presence which were bound to become, especially when taken into exile, primary carriers of the uprooted commu- nities' identity. In order to counteract fragmentation and to ensure a sense of the dispersed people's identity, deuteronomic texts put the (one) name of God in the place which inherited (and competing?) images of the divine must not be allowed to claim. In other words, exilic theology is by definition word- and name-centered. However, this observation merely seeks to make a case for the reasonableness of the deuteronomic word- and name-theology in situations of exile, but does not deny Schroer's emphasis on the general importance of the visible and the tangible in religion.
