Future Anterior Volume 1, Number 2 Fall 2004 Given more than twenty five years of writing and built work, arguing to undermine the sovereignty of the author function and intention in architecture, Peter Eisenman's latest collection of his past essays, Eisenman: Inside-Out, is a curious attempt at preservation of precisely these two characteristics: his authorship and his intentions. But perhaps more peculiar is Eisenman's declaration that this theoretical work, produced mostly during the first twenty years of his career as an aca demic, is a "probing into the heart of architecture by an archi tect, not a historian or an academic theoretician, in an attempt to explain its interior discourse, its inside, as something other than a study of essences or dialectic strategies."1 The book is a reclamation of this inside-out space of the architect, against two accusations of the historian and the academic theoreti cian: "Many critics complain that my work reflects two cultural problems," Eisenman declares in the opening sentence, "one, an unregenerate internalized formalism; and two, the prolifer ation of models from outside of architecture."2 For Eisenman, then, the collection of essays is a correction of a certain myopia of architectural discourse about its own interiority, its normative conditions, assumptions it holds as natural, expos ing "its manifold conditions.Jn a way that has rarely been for mulated by either architect or critic...[saving it from being] smothered in the claustrophobic rhetoric of a so-called natural or classical language of architecture."3 This statement begs the question, why is Eisenman's approach so uniquely critical? The answer appears to be hidden in one of three footnotes to the introduction. Defending his turf against the contemporary competition from Rem Koolhass and Frank Gehry, Eisenman declares that Koolhaas' writing, which deals with the relation ship of culture to architecture, depicts "a belief that architec ture can manifest the myriad social, economic, and political problematic at any given time."4 Gehry, on the other hand, Eisenman argues, does not have an explicit body of written theory. Instead, Gehry's work argues, through the force of per sonal expression, "that architecture can manifest the aesthetic sensibility of a culture at any particular point in its history."5 In contrast Eisenman's work is the "revealing of deep belief and ideology to show the structure of architecture as cultural com mentary or aesthetic sensibility at work [emphasis added]."6 This claim to exposing a meta-discourse, which deals not with 67</page><page sequence="2">the politics of architecture but the very possibility of architec ture's politics, is tied to a project of identifying a history of "unconscious repressions" in architecture. This is the story of architecture's interiority, or perhaps to put it more accurately, "Architecture's Interiority", which holds the key to all possibili ties of meaning and its expressions in form, be it classical notions of transcendental principles, Renaissance rules of rep resentation and historical precedence, or modernist revisions of these relationships. Unraveling from Vitruvius to Alberti to modernism to the digital age, this trans-historical interiority forces us to define architecture in such terms as historical precedence, the normative condition of the present, the corre spondence between form and function, human experience, and expression of culture and politics. For architecture to gain a critical autonomy, it must expose the normative condition of this interiority. Only then can it open up possibilities for untheorized futures, and necessary revisions of the past that reflect new relationships of form and meaning. Eisenman's claim brings us to another question: how is this meta-interiority identified? This time the answer comes from a short piece Eisenman wrote as an afterword to the client's commentary on his famous House IV.7 Here Eisenman defines the project's criticality as resistance to the discourse of preservation. Monuments, Eisenman argues, represent a certain "nostalgia for the status quo." Restoration of the building to its "original state" is worse. "While the monument attempts a preservation of the present into the future, restora tion attempts to return the present to the past."8 Both the construction and the preservation of monuments are based on a "static" conception of architecture. In contrast, the House IV is an example of a "dynamic" notion of architecture. It denies any reference to a historical origin. Even the preservation efforts have only changed the "nature" of the house to new states. This notion of criticality, as an escape from the desire for an origin, assumes the presence of an escapable origin, as well as knowing what constitutes references to that origin. Criticality defined in this way attributes, to use Eisenman's own term, an "essence" to the very notion of the origin that it seeks to displace. This presumed certainty of identifying the "enemy," is reflected in the current book as well. "Certainly," Eisenman claims "there are enough references to what architecture is, or concerns itself to be, and to what it could or should be, to lead one to the possibility that architec ture too has such an interior discursive formulation [emphasis added]."9 Eisenman's framing becomes problematic in the shadow of the presumed certainty of uncovering a meta-interi ority, forgetting the lesson learnt from dealing with particular historical problems in the book, that is, that the inquiry itself 68</page><page sequence="3">cannot not shape the object it seeks to uncover. A subversive work is critical not because it escapes the past, but because it shows that we cannot not want to return to the past. The question of criticality lies not in escaping preservation, but in the manner of preservation itself. All preservations, to put a twist on a much used pun, are not preserved equally. It should be the primary lesson of deconstruction that the difference between the inside and the outside of any dis course is never annulled, and must not be annulled. In our desire to undermine the primacy of the signified, we should not end up privileging the signifier. In seeking out the interior ity of architecture, we should not end up privileging inquiry as a means to an origin, thereby only reproducing the interiority in another direction. Deconstruction must take into account the lack of sovereignty of the critic herself. The desire for an exposed interiority must never be fulfilled. The difference between the inside and the outside in which the project takes hold must also decompose. Eisenman's consequent use of semiotic and structural the ory and Derridian deconstruction in his writing over the years have certainly introduced new stakes into the debate around the evolving relationship of form and meaning in a particular tradition of western classical architecture, and to that end his contributions are invaluable. Yet to claim that this debate determines all possible histories of architecture would be a disservice to his own arguments. Eisenman's claim to a meta interiority leaves no room for those "academics and critics" for whom Rem Koolhaas' framing of the relationship between architecture and culture does not meet the bill of current glob al politics, except as particular instances of that interiority. This rules out the gains made through cultural, feminist, and Marxist theory in architectural history as mere instantiations of some meta-interiority of architecture. The collection of essays can be divided, according to Eisenman himself, into two parts, representing two phases in his intellectual career. Even though the two approaches blend into each other through a uniform transition, the two attitudes toward history can be differentiated at the poles. The essays from the early 1960s, perhaps almost to the mid 1970s, char acterize Eisenman's attempts, as he himself acknowledges, to fashion an "ur-formalism," a certain autonomous discourse that, using "linguistic analogies," returns meaning, figuration, and representation to architecture without reference to norma tive standards of rules and styles. This, Eisenman had thought, would displace architecture's interiority from a classi cal language paradigm to a linguistic one. This framework was later abandoned because of the realization that the linguistic/semiotic paradigm was also predicated on "stable 69</page><page sequence="4">conceptions of structural relationships," similar to the classical ones that it sought to displace. In these essays, linguistics was seen as an outside that could open up the unconscious repressions of the classical and modern paradigm. In this regard Eisenman accepts Derrida's later caution ?issued in the controversial exchange between the architect and the philoso pher in the mid 1980s?that the correspondence between architectural and linguistic metaphors cannot be guaranteed. In "Toward an Understanding of Form in Architecture" (1963), Eisenman challenges what he considers the two sides of the then-contemporary debate on the question of historical prece dence in architecture: the "English Revisionist Functionalism" stressing the insignificance of form (spanning the arguments of Reyner Banham, Cedric Price, and Archigram), and John Summerson's classicist proposition that all form is based on primary solids. Compounding a structuralist tilt with an incli nation toward Gestalt psychology, Eisenman contends that a we can identify a third way, a certain critical language of form that can provide a shared criteria for design and criticism by uncovering the author's original intentions. Eisenman identi fies a meta-language of intention, function, structure, tech nique, and form to show how these categories can combine building and surrounding environment towards a clarity of expression. This desire towards a meta-language of form continues in "Notes on Conceptual Architecture" (1971). Here Eisenman attempts to delineate a conceptual language of architecture in response to developments in conceptual art, one that can invoke a kind of nihilism about the efficacy of a designed object and bring out the object as a "thing in itself." The proj ect of an abstract language of architecture becomes more pro nounced in the essay, "Cardboard Architecture" (1972), on the architects' famous House I and House II projects, arguing for the possibility of form as a pure marking or a notational sys tem. This possibility is further explored in the work of Alison and Peter Smithsons and James Sterling in "From Golden Lane to Robin Hood Gardens" (1973). Toward the end of the 1970s the project of pure abstrac tion began to give way to a more nuanced approach of employing existing elements of a discourse and complicating them to expose their construction. The essay, "Post Functionalism" (1976), focuses on the "neo-functionalist" claim of a natural correlation between form and function. Drawing on Foucault's notion of the episteme, Eisenman would describe the functionalist argument as a humanist nos talgia out of sync with its historical moment. Renaissance humanism had sought to correlate formal arrangement with a moral imperative, by placing man as the originating agent of 70</page><page sequence="5">history. Modernism displaced the notion of the authoritarian subject as well as the conception of a linear and continuous history. Functionalism's insistence on the correlations between form and function therefore results in a mere positivism with out its attending moral imperative. Modernism and functional ism are incongruent. Functionalist correlation between form and function must be perceived as a dialectal relationship between evolution of form itself, a development within mod ernism that represent its non-corroborating and non-sequen tial tendencies. Though this development can have humanist tendencies?be it seeing architectural form as recognizable transformation from platonic solids or as a collage or frag ments of signs pointing to a transcendental signified ?both the tendencies define the inherent nature of the object and its capacity to be represented. This, Eisenman, argues, is an exclusively modernist conception. This deconstructivist approach leads to the idea of an architectural "text," itself a Derridian theme. Eisenman would perhaps most succinctly describe this idea in an essay on Mies' work, "miMISes READING" (1986). A "text," Eisenman argues, can be distinguished from an object. Even though an object (architectural or written) may be a text, a text differenti ates itself from an object by being an "approximation or simu lation" of another object, "reveal[ing] or stimulat[ing]" its structure.10 Mies' work constitutes an architectural text. Mies contaminates the modern with classical references but dispels any anthropomorphic references, displacing the whole human ist symbolic discourse based on a certain relationship between man and object. This re-inscription of the classical in a non-classical manner creates a certain simulation of signs, frustrating the expectancy of the classical system as it is "betrayed by an order which itself is broken apart."11 The later essays, Eisenman claims, explore strategies that avoid a reductive analogy to language or the normative rule based paradigm of the classical lexicon of architecture. The assumption that architecture's interiority is either historically or semiotically determined is abandoned in these essays. Derrida argued in "Of Grammatology" (1974), that there can be no preferred relationship between the signifier and signified in language, challenging Ferdinand de Saussure's notion of tran scendental signifier in the spoken language. One of the strate gies explored in the later essays stems from Eisenman's claim that the Derridian insight has important implications for archi tecture. Architecture embodies a particular relationship between the sign and its reality. Unlike language, the sign and the signified are always in the same present in architecture. Eisenman's favorite, and often repeated, example of this archi tectural simultaneity is the column. A column is both its reality 71</page><page sequence="6">(being a column and performing a function of holding some thing up) and a sign of that reality (a sign of something hold ing something else up), in the same present. Even if the col umn is just a sign, not performing a load-bearing function, it still appears doubly present in our normative assumptions. For Eisenman, this quality is unique to architecture. Because of the simultaneity of sign and reality, architectural sign "is always already embodied with meaning as an object different ly from other manmade objects."12 For Eisenman, the realiza tion of this simultaneity differentiated Alberti's interpretation of Vitruvius' classical lexicon, from Vitruvius' own conceptual ization. For Alberti, architecture not only had to fulfill the requirement of standing up (what Vitruvius called the quality of firmness), but also had to look like it is standing up. Architecture needed not only to be a reality but also to be the sign of that reality. This quality of architecture becomes Eisenman's primary preoccupation in the later essays. The pri mary question for architecture, according to Eisenman, was how to displace its historical anteriority and its traditional modes of representation lodged in the necessity of meaning, function and aesthetics, to claim a certain critical autonomy, or singularity. As the essays show, Eisenman is well aware of the aster isks to any deconstructive strategy we mentioned earlier when he is complicating the status of meaning, sign, and subjectivi ty in architecture at particular geo-political moments in histo ry. As an index of these moments, the book is an excellent resource on the history of architectural theory. Those cautions only become hazy when these inquiries are presented as a his torical project about the historicity of architecture itself, uncovering a meta-interiority that determines the possibilities of all other inquiries in architectural history. It has been said that deconstruction is not the exposure of error, certainly not other people's error. It is a persistent cri tique of necessary truths?of what one cannot not want. To neglect one's irrevocable complicity with the object of one's critique is to wield the violence of deconstruction itself. As an anecdotal aside to his lecture at MIT in 2002, where this read er happened to be, Eisenman quipped that one just needs to read the first hundred pages of Derrida's "Of Grammatology" to know all he had to say about deconstruction. This Derridian caution about the violence of deconstruction itself happens to be most pronouncedly expressed in the second section of "Of Grammatology", which begins on page 101. 72</page><page sequence="7">Author biography Ijlal Muzaffar is a PhD Candidate in History, Theory, and Criticism of Art and Architecture at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge, Massachusetts.
