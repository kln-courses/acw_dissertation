By Gerhardt Von Bonin and Percival Bailey. The University of Illinois, Urbana. $3.00 (paper). xii + 163 pp.; ill. 1947. This splendid study of the cellular architecture of the cerebral cortex of the rhesus macaque monkey furnishes those neuroanatomists and physiologists who study primates with a thorough and presumably very useful work. Its scope includes almost the entire cortex (except the allocortex), and its methods involve the study and analysis of sections of 20,u in thickness, cut in various planes (horizontal, frontal, parasagittal, and oblique) and stained with thionin. A superb series of 62 photographs of selected sections reproduces for the reader the raw material on which the study was based. The author's conclusions regarding the distribution of the distinct cellular areas are graphically incorporated in a colored "brain-map" that serves as frontispiece. The text is given over chiefly to a discussion of the cell arrangements shown in the sections, but there is in addition a chapter on the gross fissural patterns of the cortex, and some data are given on the growth of the brain and its weight relative to body weight in the macaque. The cream of originality of this type of study was of course realized by Brodmann and by Campbell more than forty years ago, and to the former in particular every subsequent worker has been enormously in- debted. The present work in many ways supplements and also corrects that of Brodmann, which was done in 1905 on a different but closely related species of monkey. The close agreement of the present study with that of Brodmann, which was achieved with less material prepared by less adequate histological meth- ods, is at once a signal tribute to Brodmann and an immeasurable relief to everyone else. The matter of terminology in such a study as this, where the results are translated into a useful code or map, is both a difficult and an important one. The authors have chosen to use the symbols of Economo rather than the more widely used numerals of Brod- mann. They have done so because the former scientist has published the most detailed description of the hu- man cortex, and they felt that the present study would have greatest anthropomorphic value if the macaque brain were similarly labelled. Economo's terminology has a certain logic not possessed by Brodmann's. For example, Economo has labelled contiguous areas of the frontal lobe FA, FB, FC, FD, whereas Brodmann's equivalent numbers are 4, 6, 32, 9. In addition, if one wishes to recognize two distinct strips within area FA, they may be tagged FA a and FA 3. Thus the system is more flexible that Brodmann's, where the only re- course is to add another number that will of necessity be serially separated from the previous one. On the other hand, the terminology of Economo becomes cum- bersomre if piled too high, and it is difficult to use orally, in such designations for areas as FCBm and FCop. In any case Brodmann's numerals have become in- grained in the literature to an extent where the other system, regardless of its value, will be resisted by the majority of workers in the field. The value of this work will rest upon its usefulness over a period of years, and any present judgment would be premature. It bears the marks, however, of an exceptionally capable piece of work.
