<plain_text><page sequence="1">ARTS AND LETTERS IN THE COMPANY OF THE UNIVERSE DAVID MILLER This summer I almost forgot the sesquicentennial of Thoreau's first day of residence in the cabin by Waiden Pond. It was a small step for a man when he crossed the threshold on July 4, 1845, but may well have been a longer step for humanity than that first airy bounding on the moon. His uniquely elliptical description of his experiences there took him al most a decade to perfect. Unfortunately curiosity about his life in the woods was not widespread. Waiden flopped. Now, according to Law rence Buell, professors consider it the single most important book in nineteenth-century American literature. Thoreau even has a fan club, the Thoreau Society, which celebrated its semicentennial in 1991 with a two-week jubilee attended by a wonderfully motley assemblage of literary scholars, nature writers, Thoreau imitators, ornithologists?in deed all manner of -ologists?and not a few eccentrics-without-portfolio. What is it about this book, this man, that excites so much reverence? Lord knows, Thoreau didn't mean to flatter us. In The Environmental Imagination Lawrence Buell?who spoke at the Thoreau Society jubilee?provides as much insight into Thoreau's appeal as we're likely to get for some time. Conceived as a "modest" literary history of Thoreauvian writing?that's modest by Harvard stan dards, I guess?Buell's book expanded during gestation into a full-scale analysis of the role of environmental writing and thinking in saving Lawrence Buell, The Environmental Imagination: Thoreau, Nature Writing, and the Formation of American Culture.

He groups the essays in this book into three sets. The first set aims to establish the radical potential of environmental literature. As a version of pastoral Thoreauvian writing risks being dismissed (with cause) as bu colic daydreaming. Critics such as Leo Marx believe pastoral works, Waiden included, neither confront the ills of society nor truly portray the natural world. Buell explores a wide range of contrary examples, then chronicles Thoreau's development from garden-variety transcen dentalist into dedicated natural historian. The third set of essays focuses on Thoreau himself. Aside from some highly metaphysical academic harrumphing ih defense of an unorthodox methodology, these essays of fer a solid history of Thoreau's rise from village crank to cultural hero. Buell thinks the current view of Thoreau has him fairly well in focus as a combination literary artist, natural historian, and social rebel. The second set, which makes up the core of the book, is a group of five essays deimonstrating how to read (environmental literature critically. Each essay focuses on an "imaginative structure" used by Thoreauvians to help us envision an ecological community in which we are participants rather than sole masters. The "aesthetics of relinquishment" advocates simplifying our lives materially and reducing the claims of the ego. It asks us to wonder if "the world would become more interesting if we could see it from the perspective of a wolf, a sparrow, a river, a stone." Or as Thoreau put it: "Nature . . . invites us to lay our eye level with her smallest leaf, and take an insect view of its plain." In "Nature's Personhood" Buell offers a kind word for anthropomorphism as a means of fostering kindred feelings toward our nonhuman neighbors. The sub sequent essays describe ways of thinking about nature: season, place, and catastrophe. Th? cycle of the seasons provides a loose literary struc ture that derives from nature itself rather than the writer's projects. Similarly books that explore a developing attachment between a writer and a particular place?Waiden again, Barry Lopez's Arctic Dreams, and several books considered later in this review?focus our attention outward and instruct us in practical ways of entering a communal rela tionship with nature. Finally Buell traces the development of the idea that human interference in nature's web may lead to a global catas trophe. Merely suggested in Waiden, the idea of ecological apocalypse achieves maturity in Rachel Carson's Silent Spring and Leslie Silko's Ceremony. The image of apocalypse is in Buell's view the "single most powerful master metaphor" in environmental writing. If we can truly imagine nature's end, we may rouse ourselves to forestall it. Frank Stewart's A Natural History of Nature Writing complements Buell's analytic method with a more down-to-earth approach. A natural history essayist as well as a professor of English, Stewart establishes nature writing's main line of descent through lively portraits of Tho</page><page sequence="3">ARTS AND LETTERS 615 reau, John Burroughs, John Muir, Aldo Leopold, Rachel Carson, and Edward Abbey, with a profile of the genre's British progenitor, Gilbert White. Stewart's main emphasis is on natural history. For example he recounts in blow-by-blow detail the "nature faker" controversy that pitted Burroughs and Theodore Roosevelt against William J. Long. Long was a Congregational minister turned nature writer who developed a large audience for tales of animal ingenuity. In attacking Long's cred ulous sentimentality, Burroughs became uncharacteristically nasty? and sounded rather like those who criticized his own enthusiastic ap proach to natural history. Naturalists can be rather sensitive about their scientific credentials. As for Roosevelt, Long's rebuttal hits close to home: "Every time Mr. Roosevelt gets near the heart of a wild thing he invariably puts a bullet through it." Intramural feuding about the ethics of hunting still rages in such journals as the Audubon Society's magazine. The profile of Aldo Leopold is a fine study of intellectual tenacity and courage. Stewart traces his growth from avid killer of wolves to advocate of a "land ethic" that, in his own words, "changes the role of Homo sapiens from conqueror of the land-community to plain member and citizen of it." Rachel Carson was just plain heroic, and you're a steelier soul than I if you can read without a lump in your throat the account of her struggles with cancer and the chemical indus try as she publicized the dangers of pesticides. "Like Coleridge's ancient mariner," Stewart concludes, nature writers "pull on our sleeves with something urgent to say, compelling us to action." In Seeking Awareness Scott Slovic, a younger professor of English in Texas, focuses on Thoreau, Annie Dillard, Edward Abbey, Wendell Berry, and Barry Lopez to prove the decidedly contrarian thesis that nature writing is not primarily about nature. Instead, Slovic asserts, the major focus of the genre is on "awareness," also identified as "awaken ing" (Thoreau), "seeing" and "stalking" (Dillard), "watchfulness" (Berry), and simply "paying attention" (Lopez). So topsy-turvy did this approach seem to me at first that I scribbled numerous hostile rebuttals in the margins of early chapters. If you are occupied in the attempt to see your self seeing, you won't notice nature, I objected, whether it's erosion on Wendell Berry's Kentucky farm, or the frog sucked suddenly, horribly, symbolically empty by the water bug on Tinker Creek, or the scorpions and surveying stakes in Abbey's desert. Though I still think Slovic rides his thesis too hard on occasion (perhaps to jolt us into awareness) his enthusiasm for the writers won me over. Nature writing is, in fact, a serious, even devout, attempt to find the right angle of vision from which to see the world anew. Moreover, this "seeing" and "stalking" is not just about knowing nature factually; it's about approaching the earth with respect?about ethics as well as epistemology and psychology. De scribed thus, the search for awareness looks like a version of Buell's "aesthetics of relinquishment." Slovic's final chapter integrates the con</page><page sequence="4">616 ARTS AND LETTERS elusion to his argument with a personal essay in which we see him teach ing awareness to (or learning it from) his son Jacinto, who has the last word in the book: "I wish we could see wolves." Instead of beginning with Thoreau, Bruce Greenfield in Narrating Discovery ends with him. Greenfield's purpose is to trace the impact on romantic literature, including Waiden and The Maine Woods, of one type of travel writing, which he calls the discovery narrative. It is an argument not meant to be kind to Thoreau. Proceeding historically, Mr. Greenfield analyzes firsthand accounts of exploration, books about ex plorers (especially Washington Irving's), and "romantic" versions of the discovery narrative created by Poe (The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym) and Thoreau. In Greenfield's view, when Thoreau "traveled a good deal in Concord" or hiked up Mt. Ktaadn, he was in part re-creating the expeditions of earlier explorers. But these romantic reenactments eliminate the natives, with their claims to the land, along with the com mercial and imperial motives of those who sponsored the original expe ditions. What remains is the isolated individual and the virgin land which he, of all people, is uniquely qualified to appreciate. Greenfield portrays Washington Irving as a mediator between the early explorers and the later romantics. In his biography of Columbus, for example, Irving describes the horrors perpetrated after the Europeans landed, but he elevates a visionary Columbus above the fray. This allows us to claim Columbus as our hero while absolving him?and us?of respon sibility for our history. Greenfield argues his case perhaps a little too well. He drives Thoreau into a corner, shaves close, and reduces his work to one form and message. Pastoral has, as Buell demonstrates, other possibilities. Nevertheless, what Greenfield says rings all too true, and should be taken as a warning against the darker side of loving nature. As if in response to Washington Irving's view of Columbus, Barry Lopez weighs in with The Rediscovery of North America, a seethingly revisionist pamphlet that marks the five-hundredth anniversary of the first European visit to the Bahamas. Lopez absolves neither the great navigator nor us for what followed. After detailing the horrors perpe trated during that first incursion, he identifies the continuation of that tradition in current abuses of people and nature. How should we redeem ourselves? He suggests several models, among them Oscar Romero (the murdered archbishop of El Salvador), the Amish, and the Kentucky farmer and nature writer Wendell Berry. Celebrated by Slovic for the "tolerant" perspective of his books on distant landscapes, Lopez is in a very good position to remonstrate with his countrymen. He has paid close attention to the lives of those who step more lightly on the earth; he has earned the right to preach, and does so with considerable grace and power. Another angry traveler, Peter Matthiessen, provides a sobering close-up of the same sorry imperial aftermath in Africa. In African</page><page sequence="5">ARTS AND LETTERS 617 Silences he recounts two journeys, one a West African wildlife survey in 1978, the other a survey of forest elephants in the Congo Basin in 1986. Although he reports on contacts with birds, monkeys, gorillas, elephants ?not to mention a pet mongoose that bites him as he showers?he also discovers too much silence where once there was wildlife. Matthiessen's often hazardous travels bring us into vicarious contact with many of the varied groups that mingle uneasily in the new Africa?villagers who have preserved ancient ways of life and those who have turned their back on the past in disdain; dedicated scientists, park rangers, and poachers; fair-minded, postcolonial whites and insensitive tourists. If much of the old Africa has fallen silent, the new Africa resounds with (sometimes chaotic) life. You won't find a better guide and interpreter than Matthiessen, who comes neither to conquer nor to transcend, but to pay attention, to learn, to report truly, and if possible to help. During his abbreviated life Thoreau complained (unfairly, Buell dem onstrates) of his treatment by publishers. He might be ruefully pleased to know that the great publishing houses pay more attention to him now. Thoreau on Birds and Faith in a Seed are handsome illustrated selections from manuscripts left unpublished when Thoreau died. Thoreau on Birds, which first appeared in 1910, consists entirely of entries from Thoreau's voluminous journals. Arranged by species and date, the en tries range from shorthand descriptions to brief polished narratives. They show Thoreau struggling to identify birds (no Peterson guides back then); finding verbal analogues for songs; measuring wing span, egg diameter, nest sizes; railing at the abandon with which his neigh bors shoot birds?but accepting the corpses they bring him to study. Sometimes he waxes transcendental: "The wood thrush is a more modern philosopher than Plato and Aristotle." But most of the book is descrip tive, sensual, the record of Thoreau's passion for his subject: "Saw a tanager in Sleepy Hollow. It most takes the eye of any bird ... the deep est scarlet of the red wing spread over the whole body, not on the wing coverlets merely, while the wings are black. It flies through the green foliage as if it would ignite the leaves." Faith in a Seed contains several of Thoreau's natural-history essays, including the first publication of The Dispersion of Seeds, a draft of a book he was working on when he died. Seeds shows us where Thoreau lived and why?he is still traveling a good deal in Concord, notebook in hand. It is not organized primarily to recount personal adventures but to document various methods of seed dispersal?burial by squirrels, transportation by birds, flight on their own wings (like maple-tree seeds), and so forth. Waiden you can read with no particular concern about the details of natural fife. To enjoy The Dispersion of Seeds, you have to care about the intimate details of vegetable reproduction as well as the style and philosophy of the author. Nevertheless the voice is still vintage Thoreau, pungent and highly personal. Nor has he abandoned his</page><page sequence="6">618 ARTS AND LETTERS metaphorical magic act. A willow twig in winter lifts his spirits "as if it were an oasis in the desert. The very name 'sallow' (salix, from the Celtic sal, near' and lis, water') suggests that there is some natural sap or blood flowing there. It is a divining wand that has not failed but stands with its root in the fountain." Fairly priapic, for a noted prude, wouldn't you say? Perhaps the aging philosopher had begun to regret his chastity. Bernd Heinrich, a zoology professor at the University of Vermont, hews about as close to a Thoreauvian marriage of science and art as any living nature writer. A Year in the Maine Woods chronicles his observa tions and adventures during a sabbatical spent mostly in his rustic cabin. The book is based on selected journal entries divided into seasonal sec tions. When it comes to roughing it, he makes Thoreau look like a frock coated picnicker. For company Heinrich keeps a raven named Jack. He runs one-hundred-kilometer races. He eats road kill. Imagine an out house in winter in Maine. Yet there's no showing off in his prose. Well, maybe a little. But he's nakedly honest about his emotions, which run the gamut from loneliness to euphoria. His curiosity extends to all phe nomena, including those seeds that fascinated Thoreau. Intrigued by the winged samaras from maple trees, he calls the Vermont Maple Lab oratory to ask about the scientific literature on the subject and is sur prised to find there isn't much. (Someone should send him Thoreau's book.) Next, he speculates on the evolutionary utility of the wonder he feels when contemplating the seed: "Any partnership requires love. . . . The more I depend on the forest, the more I'll love it. I have depended on the forest now for many things for a long time, even for the enter tainment of watching samaras in the wind." In the next entry he records his amazed realization that he has begun to think like Jack: "My mind still noticed all the common things but no longer focused them into articulate thoughts. I had become like the raven." Talk about relinquish ing the ego. In his introduction to Thoreau on Birds John Hay remarks that, "Birds lead Thoreau toward the true nature of their world." In his own book, The Bird of Light, Hay studies the world according to terns. An emeritus professor of environmental studies, Hay lives in retirement on Cape Cod and knows these raucous, handsome birds from years of observation and wide reading. He shows us how terns thrive in every season of the year; describes courtship, birth, and death; and explores the community of life to which terns belong?other creatures and the whole globe they traverse in flight. Some of his more mystical passages leave me earth bound, but the depth and breadth of his empirical knowledge lends credibility even to those rhetorical flights. He is almost always sensuous and crystal clear: "A dog races in [the terns'] direction, and a big flock instantaneously divides in two, each part skimming low, wheeling away, and settling down out of reach. . . . When they flip over on their sides,</page><page sequence="7">ARTS AND LETTERS 619 reflecting the sunlight, it is as if they were deliberately courting it. Such dazzling unanimity is as much a puzzle to those who try to unravel it as are the currents of a running brook." In A Beginners Faith Hay pursues similar themes in essays on varied species and landscapes, from Atlantic alewives to prairie grasses, from seacoast to desert mountain, and backward along the path of his own life from the high vantage point of eighty years. After a lifetime of study, he retains the humility and passion of a beginner. "America is as yet undiscovered," he writes. And "I think all the plants and animals are more literate at reading a continent than I am." He laments lost landscapes, species, individuals, and ways of life that bound human beings together with nature instead of walling us off. His goal is to be lifted "into the company of the universe" as were the Sioux Indians in the Sun Dance. "We can find neither home nor direction without par ticipation." What kind of participation? We can't eat wonder or ceremony. "In wildness is the preservation of the world" makes a nice slogan; but the trick is to have our world and eat it too. We preserve (in part) to consume. Peter Svenson's Preservation is a long autobiographical med itation on the title subject?with due attention to participation. His primary project is preservation of his creative self. For many years Svenson put painting ahead of money-making and went hungry. Along the way he acquired a farm that includes a part of a Civil War battle field. Now he preserves his creative self by painting, writing, and play ing the piano while preserving the fertility of his land with the help of a variety of old-fashioned farming implements. Meanwhile he tries to organize his neighbors to preserve the battlefield. Along with all this he selectively preserves childhood memories, which he records in chap ters that alternate with the narrative of his adult life. He has a pond on his property, but unlike Waiden it was created by damming a stream. He calls himself president of this humanly created retreat, where he goes to feel "at one with nature"?rather self-consciously perhaps. But his memoir rings true, alternately humorous and poignant, with a deep appreciation of the complexities of simultaneously preserving and re linquishing the ego. Add him to Barry Lopez as a model to emulate, together with Wendell Berry and the Amish. Buell notes that environmental writing has a male bias. There are those bloody discoverers and hunters like Roosevelt. Thoreau was a bit of a misogynist. But the genre also incorporates characteristics cul turally associated with women. There is something domestic about na ture writing?even Waiden. It advocates taking care of things?preser vation. (Bernd Heinrich, tough guy that he is, throws in a recipe for baking bread.) Many fine nature books are by women?Rachel Carson, Annie Dillard, "woodswoman" Anne LaBastille, Sally Carrighar, Gretel Ehrlich. A case in point is the novelist and essayist Brenda Peterson,</page><page sequence="8">620 ARTS AND LETTERS represented here by Nature and Other Mothers. Peterson expands the scope of the nature essay by bringing in friends and family. (Waiden never names Thoreau's favorite companion, his sister Sophia.) Peterson's passionate entanglement with her human family seems all of a piece with her love for nature. The final essay in this book, "Killing Our Elders," is a piece of poetic outrage prompted by the clear-cutting of Douglas firs in the Cascade forests where she lived as a child. She knew those trees intimately: "The snap of pine sap against my tongue woke up my nose, face, brain." The trees were "silent neighbors," ancestors of a sort, taller and older than grown-ups. Thinking of the trees reminds her of her grandfather, of his funeral. Watching the steady succession of logging trucks, she weeps, and asks herself if we would treat the trees differently if we saw them as people. She decides we would not: "We deny our own human elders a place in our tribe. If an old tree, like our old people, is not perceived as productive, it might as well be dead." Don't misunderstand. For Peterson trees are useful as well as sacred. But they will not be useful for long if the forest itself is destroyed. Participation and preservation must be in balance?like solitude and society, science and art, male and female. All this is easy to say, much harder to put into practice. Whether thinking like a nature writer will preserve us and our elders from ecological catastrophe I really don't know. We'll at least need a green political party to translate awareness into action. But I'd be hard pressed to point to another element of our culture that offers as much passion, knowledge, poetry, and hope as the kind of literature inaugurated by Henry David Thoreau.</page></plain_text>
