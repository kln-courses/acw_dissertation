<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Prospect Before Us Herbert Blau This issue moves, not exactly in sequence, from a retrospective on the happening out of the scene of action painting to the situationist critique of "the society of the spectacle" to the extremities of performance in body art and autodestruction, including the aesthetics of paroxysm among the Viennese actionists, to the voice with no body of radiophonie art to rede- ployment of the body through the logic of computer program- ming to the projection of a "virtual reality" on the edge of cyberspace. If there is a high-tech magic to that reality, which offers the prospect of a changed identity, the riskier limits of performance are examined and redefined through the trickery of the transference in the Challenge Act of Houdini, which brings us back - by way of the actionists, Artaud, and Gilles de Rais - to the most aboriginal excesses of art and thought. Mean- while, there is some anxiety in mid-volume about the current status of performance art, not only as scandal but as oppositional practice. The question posed there is whether performance is "dominant but dead"; or, if still alive and even ubiquitous, about the degree to which its experimental drive and antithetical func- tion in the seventies, in symbiosis with critical theory, was muted during the eighties either by "mediafication" or its acceptance in the artworld as merely another genre , with recidivist tendencies toward the conventional theater. Actually, all of these phenomena occurred - in the anti- formalist passage from abstract expressionism through "the dematerialization of the object" in minimalism and conceptual- ism to the return of the figure by means of performance - within the precincts of the artworld, with ups and downs of equivocation</page><page sequence="2">2 Discourse 14.2 about its market economy. That was true even when that world stretched (beyond) the gallery system to the desert or spiral jetty or back to the urban landscape and thence into photography or the video screen, the market expanding by satellite transmission. That also circumscribes, I suppose, the postmodern condition, where "the superfetation of image" in the age of simulacra (Baudrillard) confirmed once more the mere redundancy of theater, while producing an anti-aesthetic that signaled (not for the first time, to be sure) the imminent death of art. There was an early point in these developments when the incursion of the- atricality upon the arts was declared to be the certain cause of that death. The debate on that charge, made by Michael Fried toward the end of the sixties,1 still resonates in cultural critique, most particularly in reassessing the crux of minimalism in rela- tion to modernism2 and, in the tradition of Duchamp, myriad varieties of conceptual art, which is still the matrix of much performance. Taking all this into account, let me be a little retrograde, rehearsing for a moment what, among the arts, has become a minor genre, if not quite dead itself, or entirely disdained: There was a time, in a simpler world than this, when if you thought about performance you were thinking about the theater, focused upon the actor developing a character from a dramatic text, with more or less verisimilitude or psychological realism. There might have been deviations into historical "style" or bor- rowings from other cultures or experiments with space and time, but even the most rigorous alienation or radical extremities of disjuncture, in the actor's performance or the staging, seemed but an illusory warp of the same measure of credibility. As with the actor, so with the spectator: the habits of mind were derived from the Cartesian frame of the proscenium stage even if the performance were thrust into the audience or taking place in the round or, with the dispersion of the text into a participatory mystique, spilling into the streets.3 For those who were seeking during the sixties an "alternative theater" within the theater, that was particularly disheartening. But among the things that had to be (re) discovered is that the habits of mind are obdurate, and so they were even when an ideological distinction was being made between the actor and the performer. This dissociated figure in the theater anticipated certain qualities that were to emerge, through the postmodern crossing of genres, in what came to be known as performance art. (Certain performers, like Spalding Gray or Eric Bogosian,</page><page sequence="3">Spring 1992 3 are identified with performance art but have never really left the theater, even though Bogosian made his first appearances at Franklin Furnace, an avant-garde performance space.) If the actor in the "bourgeois theater" was impeded by the psychology of the character, and the factitious emotions of interior process, the performer was to be self-determining, libidinal, vatic, auton- omous, "not a shaman or an acrobat or an athlete," but sharing the attributes and powers of all these (Schechner 53): supple as a contortionist, able to turn a headstand into an ideograph or make a tongue-twisting speech on a trampoline or, as in th√® ascetic regime of Grotowski, send out psychic energy ( taksu , prana , bayu , chi) to isolated muscles everywhere in the body, and to all the vocal resonators, performing in chant and trance. If there were shamanic affinities to the dance/drama and spiritual disciplines of Asia and Africa, there were also prece- dents in the Western tradition (Yeats, Witkiewicz), with diverse energies from the historical avant-garde, surrealism or construc- tivism, including the critique of interior process in the biomechanics of Meyerhold. Excepting, however, the rarest of deferential gestures, none of this was on the scene when I first began working in the theater, just before the turn of the fifties. The actor might be inspired, but not very much by the arts. A performance was still shaped by the necessities of character or, since the Method was more or less the source of most acting technique, the immersion of character in the depths of "emo- tional memory." What was called "the private moment" at the Actors Studio might have been a narcissistic indulgence, but it seems in retrospect as if it were preparing the ground for Vito Acconci's Seedbed (1971), where the artist masturbated under a ramp, with his breathing amplified into the gallery. Whatever the filiation, there was a conceptual difference, and whatever the method (or its absence), there was likely to be in such acting a quite limited repertoire of sound production and body parts: face first of all, eyes (if close up), mouth (of course, fountain of speech), hands and arms, a sometimes expressive ankle, and then, if the actor were particularly resourceful, the imposing or forbidding back. That would be turned to the audience for a profoundly moved or ambiguous moment upstage, with a time- liness of absence discretely timed, so that the reappearance of the face were like a Second Coming. This was not yet the era of the labial body, plangent flesh and sphincter control, mouth to anus, anus to mouth (cloaca of speech), the whole "carnal stereophony" (Barthes), no less a "body without organs" (Artaud) or the "epidermic play of perversity" (Foucault) or,</page><page sequence="4">4 Discourse 14.2 with all the orifices open, accessible, the ''communicating vessels" (Breton) or erotic vesicles of a surrealist dream. It was, moreover, a matter of principle that the actor be "line perfect," true to the text as it was written, and the freest of spirits among the actors were more likely than not to be very dutiful. But with a liberating regimen of psychophysical exercises and a new rhetoric of the body, the performer was another breed that might have been theorized by deconstruction: a sort of alterna- tive "lesson in writing,"4 undoing the mutually supportive fanta- sies of the actor's internal truth and the organic production of an artistic whole, breaking down the delusion of inner and outer and the apparencies of a unitary vision, thereby confronting a problem, making distinctions, maybe starting from scratch, and with or without a (sacred) text converting the trial and error and repetitive momentum of rehearsal - whose motive power is the ideology of desire - into the exemplary model of performance. As for the authority of the playwright or director in the anxious hierarchy of power, that was always a mere semblance, with con- siderable paranoia. We should have known as far back as Six Characters in Search of an Author that the playwright and director were in servitude themselves to the repressive economy of the theater, in which acting method was inscribed with the price of the ticket and the box office remained - even when the box set was pushed into forced perspective, skewed, sliced, or taken down - the psychosexual command center of the long-standing oedipal plot. As we've also learned, however, from the intersection of psy- choanalysis and deconstruction, the plot is obdurate too. In this regard, see the plaintive ending of Derrida's essay on Artaud, that tutelary figure of theater and theory, where "to think the closure of representation is to think the tragic: not as the repre- sentation of fate, but the fate of representation. Its gratuitous and baseless necessity" (250). It was that other tutelary figure, Brecht, who told us early on just how thick the plot really is, even as he urged removing the "teasers" and the "tormentors," and the dramaturgical mechanism that they disguised, with the inef- fable barbarism of its transfiguring metaphysics. The objective was to open up a "dialectic-in-the-wings," as Althusser put it in an essay on Brecht. The dialectic continues in theory, with mixed feelings about the ontology of the form, but so far as any institu- tional theater is concerned, the prospect before us has been determined by an apparatus of reproduction that, according to recent critique, is programmed only to reproduce the Same; or, as Brecht said of the capacity of the apparatus to thwart conver-</page><page sequence="5">Spring 1 992 5 sion to all other purposes, to "theater it all down," any play whatever, classical or modern, any "foreign body within the appa- ratus," any form of resistance (43). As we think over the widening parameters of performance in a period where cultural theory has been dreaming (with more or less fervor or alarm) the end of representation, or that system of representation, the presence of theater in our habits of mind may be, nevertheless, if not the virtual, the spectral reality in our most expansive or prosthetic visions of performance. As it turns out, the only essay in this issue that has anything to do with the theater is concerned with foreign bodies within the apparatus: corporeal bodies and textual bodies, classical, modern, feminist avant-garde, all of which suggest that the the- ater itself (in the originary and consummate deceit of theatering it all down?) has staked out from the beginning the grounds of its critique. So, too, the theater itself seems to point to the "binary terror" in its system of representation, what Vivian Patraka explores as she tries to imagine, in the relation of mod- ernist drama and feminist performance (reading both ways), another sort of "twinned physical presence ... on the other side of a nonexistent proscenium." The truth appears to be, if the canonical drama is any evidence - obsessed as it is with the insidiousness of appearance - that the theater has always been suspicious of theater, so far as theater is nothing more than appearance. We might, of course, say the same of life, but so much the worse for theater, which appears to double the fault. This appears to be no less so even when the theater tries to keep things distinct, drawing the line, as in the Alienation-effect of Brecht, between life and theater, keeping the theater nothing but theater. Which returns us, tautologically, to the double bind, to be rehearsed, perhaps, another way: There was a time when if you thought about performance you were thinking about the theater in which the thought of performance, with its self-reflexive actor in the center of the stage, might even be hostile to the idea of theater, as the unreal border of the reality of life, which was presumably prior to or other than theater, whose reality has been considered over the generations so much the model of otherness that it couldn't be trusted or, in one of those periodic reversals of the an ti theatrical prejudice, a model of resistance precisely because of that. In the critical theory of recent years - as in artistic practice - it has been first one, then the other, sometimes both simultaneously, although it may have been a matter of keeping one's bearings</page><page sequence="6">6 Discourse 14.2 about what kind of theater was being talked about in the carnival- esque of theory that (not as frequently today as in the days of √©criture) might even resemble performance. That becomes an issue in the essay by Gerhard Lischka - on performance art as "life art," resisting mediafication - as he distinguishes the the- atricalization of social exchange in the dramaturgy of Erving Goffman from the more radical performativity in the mediascape of Marshall McLuhan. To the extent, however, that performance is now being derived from theater, asjosette F√©ral contends in her essay, that's partly because of its new generic status and panache in media culture, including a reciprocal impact on MTV. Whereas it once encouraged, and in its dissidence even preferred, a certain ama- teurism (anybody can perform, and everybody did, as Goffman was saying), it now requires more professional skill. What televi- sion demands is increasingly true of "live" performance, not only in its proliferous use of camcorders, vocoders, manifold monitors, and Dolby sound, but in the requisite technologies of the body. Some early performance art came from the conscious- ness raising of the seventies, as at Womanhouse in Los Angeles, where one didn't expect a polished performance. In the course of time, however, some of those performances did become more polished as they were repeated more than once at therapy ses- sions elsewhere, urged on by hugs and embraces - yes, it hap- pened to me, too! - this incident arousing a tear, that one a laugh, things sharpened or eliminated in the storytelling, maybe even somewhat misrepresented as it became performance art, the loose ends pulled together to assure the expected response. In short, as performance itself became more familiar, and dra- matic material introduced, there was a demand for better acting. Which in the ironies of authenticity, an early concern of some performance, returns the reality of the "life art" to the practiced art of deceit. As for the participation mystique, which abated in the theater after the euphoria of the sixties, it still persists in the hybrid varieties of performance developed in the other arts, and in the cybernetic promise of a rich interaction with personal computers and videodiscs. The final essay in this issue, by Ann Lasko-Harvill, examines the electrobodied dimensions of that promise, but even as we think about it there is once again the shadow of theater with its obdurate habits of mind, the human image reappearing in the infinite "composability" of the video screen, perhaps with a new identity, but with elements of the Same.</page><page sequence="7">Spring 1992 7 There was, it appears, a similar composability in "the knowl- edge of identities, differences, characters, equivalences, words . . . that made it possible," as Foucault says in the anti- humanist coda to The Order of Things, "for the figure of man to appear." He then conjectures in a series of wish-fulfilling condi- tionals that if that dispensation of knowledge, its arrangements, were to disappear, then the image of man (a recent invention) might be mercifully "erased, like a face drawn in sand at the edge of the sea" (387). One can imagine, of course - and the sub- junctivity of the passage almost solicits such imagining - that in the recursive cessions of the sea, its circumscriptions, the face might reappear in the sand as it disappeared. (Shakesp√´are sug- gested as much in a sonnet [60] , and Beckett in Imagination Dead Imagine. ) Foucault shifted attention in his later work to the micro- physics of power, but in this rather Nietzschean book he was still dreaming, if not the end, then the suspension of representation, "on the edge of itself, open," just a hair or a breath away from "the naked opening of Desire," and there - in the recovery of a language emerging "in all its nudity, . . . when Desire reigns in the wild state" - as close as thought can be to what was always unthought (374-75). In a previous issue of Discourse , my co-editor Valie Export (before films and installations, a performance artist herself) wrote not of the suspension but the extension of representation, by means of the prosthetic body or "the triumph of technology as body, which is also a triumph over the body" (5) . It remains to be seen whether there will be such a triumph in virtual reality, or whether it will become, in the wildest accessions of desire, the projective site of the always unthought. In her own prefatory remarks to this issue, Export is concerned with that movement of thought in art which, at the time of the happening, freed the concept of action from painting and turned it not to virtual but to concrete reality, and from action to activism: art as intervention t which at its extremity, in situationism, Fluxus, and certain action- events, attempted to abolish the distinction between art and life. Or, in the emergence of "feminist actionism," undid the social coding of the body, particularly the woman's body as represented in the media. Or, as in certain media-oriented types of perfor- mance, recovered the body as subject, "hypertext of its own agenda," by a sensuous conversion, or transubstantiation, of the technology itself. At the far end of the spectrum of (on-again off-again) rela- tions between technology and performance, the distinction between art and life seems to be maintained by Lasko-Harvill, in</page><page sequence="8">8 Discourse 14.2 her account of virtual reality. She is also concerned with the body as subject, but describes the dramaturgy of virtual reality in humanistic terms, drawing as in conventional acting upon the experience of the performer. Those who work with virtual reality apparently speak, moreover, like ordinary theater people about gesture, timing, and the orchestration of sound and motion with image, though as with performance and video art the emphasis is upon "real time" and not merely dramatic time. Hardware and software are required for the figuration of virtual reality but, as Lasko-Harvill sees it, human experience is the mainspring and the mainframe. If there is power in the modeling of a virtual reality, it comes from something like extra-mimetic capacities in the machine, its facility in dissembling, which opens up the possi- bilities of designing a virtual self in a modified environment. This may involve exchanging physical attributes with another per- former, taking his eyes, giving him breasts, but in something more than a painless cosmetic surgery altering the cultural norms for beauty, status, gender, or race. As in the butch-femme theater described by Patraka, this draws upon techniques of masking or masquerade, but with a mechanism of exchange in which there is, so far as body parts are concerned, virtually no limit to what is exchangeable; as with African or pre-Columbian masks, there is virtually no limit either to the fragmentation, derangement, or extensibility of features. Nothing like this would be possible without the computer, but what Lasko-Harvill suggests is that however the altered identity is achieved, there is no prosthetic for the human form that is not inhabited by the human form. What, however, about that anthropomorphic thing? Is it there as mere contagion, like a computer virus itself? Or, worse, that arch-dissembler Iago, a virtuoso of virtual reality, getting under the skin by mere appearance, invading identity like a thief? The issue of the body invader seems like the cautionary subtext of Lasko-Harvill's essay. She is aware that in the seeming limit- lessness of the electronic mimesis, the swap-meet of virtual real- ity, there is the liability of being thoroughly altered or separated from oneself, with something like the nausea once associated with the Absurd. Actually, the nausea may be more literal than that, as in simulator sickness, or with body parts and senses at cross purposes, the sensory gridlock of synesthesia. But it's as if she had Iago in mind when, on the basis of her experience, she speaks of a particular virtue in the theatricalized scene of virtual reality: a shift from credibility in self-dramatization to security in</page><page sequence="9">Spring 1992 9 the projection of an identity, and protection from invasions of privacy. Is virtual reality an art form, as Lasko-Harvill claims? That will be a recurring question about various events or activities or practices described in these essays (though it should probably be said that there are those theorizing postmodern culture who, about the question of art, couldn't care less). Given my own experience, and predilections, I suppose the computer here is like the empty stage itself, not empty at all, but an imminence, a prospect of form that remains to be inhabited, hopefully by those with, whatever the software, imagination to boot. If virtual reality has the capacity to reconstruct the body in order to give it a new identity, the concept of radiophonie art confronts us with a body that seems beyond the pale. Some of us may remember the days when the invisible body sanctioned a form of knowledge that only the Shadow knows. By way of Rabelais, Allen Weiss looks more closely at the Shadow's shadow, or puts his ear to its truth, that "the phantasm at the origins of radiophonie art" requires not only its invisibility but the vastation of the body that sanctions "an eternal return of the voice." In developing this notion, Weiss turns to the formidable if neglected French playwright, Val√©re Novarina, whose belief in the uncensored materiality of the lived body is the basis of a critique of radio drama as we've known it (for this generation, the past tense would seem to be required). For what Novarina has in mind is the audible consummation of the spectacular vision of Artaud, a physiology of the theater purged of mere speech, and s√∂ far as the body is wholly voiced no pristine editing of its excremental usages: farts, gurgles, gutturals, suckings, coughs and hiccoughs, respiratory gaspings, salivations over the word, and in the "terminal loss of the body" the rattle in the throat, which would seem to be the dominant of radiophonie art. The materiality of the minutest vocable, phonemes split apart, has been explored in sound poetry, in experimental the- ater, and with desire in the wild state (exponentially so) on the quite incredible vocal cords of Diamanda Galas. Even so - beyond even the vascular, voluptuous frenzy of that voice, totaled, torn out of the throat - we know that it might be stun- ningly expanded, like some reverberant outgrowth of virtual real- ity, by the sound engineering of radiophonie art, amplified to begin with in the harrowing power of absence, the impossible body itself, bereft, evacuated, with its glossolalia of pain. What Weiss focuses upon, like certain avant-garde musicians, is the voice lived "as a simultaneous density of bodily overtones,"</page><page sequence="10">10 Discourse 14.2 though more often than not avant-garde music goes no further than that. It appears to be the pain that in the laminations or overlays of amplified feedback turns our attention from "the grain of the voice" in The Pleasure of the Text - "the pulsional incidents, the language lined with flesh" (Barthes 66) - to the Hamletic "rub" itself, with its metaphysical abrasions on this "too, too solid flesh." Or is it "squalid flesh"? If that remains a textual crux in the soliloquy (editors differ) it's not hard to guess what choice Artaud would make, and so far as his own self-mor- tified body is the fantasy text of radiophonie art, it leads to what Weiss describes as a "deboning effect," its want of "corporeal thickness." Given, in any case, the electronic magnitudes of perfor- mance possible in the sound studio, we are confronted with the prospect of a human voice that is the voice of nobody , which may become a model of the body liberated from pain, and the fate of representation. In Novarina's own theaterwork, the site of per- formance is conceived as a devastation of names for an act which does not yet exist, except as uniquely named, appearing thus but once, and then forever lost. Yet, as we switch from the voice in the theater to the radiophonie voice, not a body without organs but "organs without a body," it may be possible to imagine, as Weiss does in his essay here, "an electro-prosthetic resurrec- tion," the annunciation of the body once devoutly wished, the body which is nothing but voice. That may be more than suspect in the critique of phallogocentrism (Export reminds us, through Freud, that man is "a kind of prosthetic God" [5]); but as with Artaud himself, this view of the radiophonie resurrection is not easy to categorize ideologically, as it doubles back upon modern- ism, deboned, in a synesthetic warp of vision, or inspiration - "INSPIRATION CERTAINLY EXISTS, ' ' Artaud declared (1: 72) - as if the Logos were reversed. Imagination. Vision. Inspiration. In my own reversed approach to the essays in this issue, the last coming first, Tve found myself using words not in vogue today, at least in critical theory, where as "transcendental signifiers" they suggest certain unique and originary powers, a dubious authenticity, therefore elitist - a far privileged cry from a materialist view of art as made by social forces in the relations of production and redistributions of power. While I'm aware that "there can be no totalizing defi- nitions of originality or imagination spanning the complexly demarcated spheres of modern cultural practice," where the idea of art is "increasingly sustained by post-market institutions" (Tagg 18-19), the prospects of performance as appropriated by</page><page sequence="11">Spring 1992 11 or appropriating technology would seem to require something more than what's suggested by a reference book I recently sent for, DOS for Dummies , with a quick fix on what empowers the computer. Call it what you will, we are talking of expanding powers, human powers, as in the most subversive and even viru- lent prototypes of performance earlier in this century, in futur- ism, dada, surrealism, which also proclaimed the death of art so that, as with Yves Klein's leap into space some years after, it might be reborn again. Regina Cornwell does not suggest, no more than my useful book, that one must become a "DOS wizard" in order to engage in "interactivity," but she took the term from computer science, and her discussion of six "interactive video" artists, who "turn away from matter-of-fact button-pushing, menus, or the click of a mouse," circulates around the Cartesian dualisms of body and mind. As she summarizes the various installations of these artists - Sharon Grace, Lynn Hershman, Jim Campbell, Ken Feingold, Grahame Weinbren, and Jeffrey Shaw - she indicates that most of them (all except Grace) refuse to be drawn to the mise-en-ab√Æme in the division of body and mind. Instead, they enlist the body on behalf of cognition and argue "for the connection between imagination and reason." She approaches those artists, however, through what appeared to be the regime of unreason in the historical avant-garde, and the later manifestations in Fluxus, actionism, and proto-pop, which were breaking down the bina- ries, particularly that between art and life, as well as the aesthetic formalism that persisted in the modernist tradition, from cubism through abstract expressionism. As Cornwell sees it, interactive video is in a line of descent within the alternative tradition, but without the renegade quali- ties or shock tactics of the dissident avant-garde. Instead of out- raging the bourgeois, this art invites them to become friendly "users" of the computer in a participatory performance, as if the technology had brought to fruition the communitarian idealism of the sixties. As it turns out, the invitation is more problematic than that, if not threatening, labyrinthine, in its proffered fanta- sies of intimacy and adventure. Cornwell's essay "interfaces" with Lasko-Harvill's description of virtual reality, insofar as both are concerned with the performative uses of a seductive technol- ogy. With interactive video, however, the interfacing between viewer/participant and technology is prepared for in diverse ways by the artists, with various challenges or opportunities for the subject who performs, including - as in the videodisc instal- lations of Grahame Weinbren - an editorial or directorial fune-</page><page sequence="12">12 Discourse 14.2 tion, the capacity to orchestrate, interpret, and analyze "the dense, rich, and sensuous materials" made available by "slave monitors" and a "touch screen." These controls, or temptations, are at the disposal of the viewer. If voyeurism is avoided here, it is more or less solicited elsewhere. In the work of Lynn Hershman - known for her personal "biography" of Roberta Breitmore, an identity she assumed for a period of time in the seventies - the sensitivity of the screen offers the user the prospect of late-night cable sex, in complicity with the media, while there is also, at a touch, dis- course that makes it clear just how women are used. Cornwell explains that Hershman (and her collaborator Sarah Roberts) have converted the software for information management into an occasion of ambivalent play, in which the viewer's relation to the body (on the screen) is itself brought into question. As in the art of Duchamp, there is in such video installations a transforma- tive relation of body, sexuality, and machine, in which the uses of the body "break down the logic of the computer and what it represents metaphorically." If in the process, as in Weinbren's Sonata , the participant becomes aware of "the body in the mind," that would not seem to preclude, in the still unresolved Cartesian split, the mind in the body; nor, wherever it is in the cognitive process, the imagination that, with "crimes, heroics, fears, pas- sions," sensitized the screen for the anticipatory touch. Jon Erickson is a performance artist who, in this issue, theo- rizes the happening by backing up in time and considering it, as more or less contemporaneous, with the situationist d√©rive (a technique of transient passage, with experiential behavior, in urban space) . In the course of his essay, he also rethinks the participatory ethos that, as we have seen, survived the potential solipsism of solo performance in the seventies, "the serious and individualistic focus that emerged from seventies conceptual- ism," and, in recent years, the theoretical emphasis on social construction of the individual. He goes on to examine the degree to which participation in performance amounts to anything more than a nostalgic carryover from the sixties, with its appar- ent theatricalization of everything in sight: fashion, therapy, pol- itics, lifestyle; to use Goffman's terms, the "interaction rituals" and "the presentation of the self" in everyday life. To focus this exploration Erickson compares the benign and collective anar- chy of happenings (in Kaprow's mode) to the ruthless critique of the spectacle by the Situationist International (SI) , particu- larly in the writing of Guy Debord, for whom the spectacle is the</page><page sequence="13">Spring 1992 13 apotheosis of commodity form, the vacuous incarnation of cap- ital itself. Referring to the emergence of the happening from action painting, Erickson discerns a certain ambivalence among the "happeners" toward their progenitors, what Harold Bloom calls a clinamen or swerve, in the direction of the conceptualism of the seventies. By dematerializing or utterly temporalizing the art-object (that is, theatricalizing it), conceptual art was, theoreti- cally, resisting appropriation by the bourgeois economy of exchange, "shifting from product or process-in-product (e.g. Pollock) to pure process." As Erickson sees it retrospectively, however, the theater of conceptualism was the correlative of a major shift within capitalism itself, from a production-oriented to an information/service economy. A major question at stake in the conceptualist event that, objectless, doesn't exist without participation is whether there is anything collective about it, or just chancy, for anybody who happens to be there. The happening as it evolved was, however, meant to be col- lective. In the metamorphosis of the passive spectator of the ''culinary theater" (Brecht) into the active viewer/partici- pant/user, the happening was one of its communitarian mani- festations; not only the single viewer but, as Kaprow eventually desired it, no viewer at all, everybody participating, making the performance at its best into something like a festival. Erickson reminds us, though, that communitarian ambitions could acquire an aggressive aspect, as they did in certain happenings. So far as the happening may have been derived from dada or futurism, and was a performative inflexion of action painting, there was already aggression in the medium , which might be directed toward that residuum of spectatorship: the audience. To the extent that they knew anything of happenings - perhaps through Jean-Jacques Lebel's events in Paris - the SI was contemptuous of them as vainly communal or team projects whose ultimate logic, according to Raoul Vaneigen (quoted by Erickson), was to supply "the society of masterless slaves, which the cyberneticians have planned for us, with the spectatorless spectacle it will require." (One may wonder how dated this appraisal is as we think through the potentiality of the newer forms of participation or interaction made possible by the cyberneticians. The question that never seems to go away in a consumer economy whose major commodity is the image: is the user being used?) If SI has a claim to being, even in its anonymous floating passage through the city, more of an art of intervention than the happening, that has to do, as Erickson sees it, with the</page><page sequence="14">14 Discourse 14.2 happenings largely occurring in acknowledged art spaces, or occasions. Those who participated in a d√©rive were not fl√¢neurs:. there might have been no sign that an event was taking place, but those involved did not keep their distance as observers, and whatever happened happened within the actual space of every- day life. Wherever it happens, Erickson is not persuaded by the ideal of spontaneity in either the happening or the d√©rive , nor in the notion of performance itself. For it implies a dissociation from what he considers an important sense of cause-and-effect, and a repression of historical consciousness. If performance has become the prototype for an anti-aesthetic that subverts the mod- ernist object, with its criterion of authenticity, he sees the spon- taneity of the absent object in the happening as representing an "idealist authenticity," and in the d√©rive a "materialist authentic- ity." Both types, he might add, have been discernible in perfor- mance and theory since. What Erickson understands, whether one thinks the authentic or distrusts it, is that the material needs and demands of one age are not necessarily those of another, and that even spectacle as representation can be, provisionally, relative to certain material conditions, "an enabling illusion as well as a disabling one." What is, of course, likely to be disturbing in a demystifying age is to think of "signifying practice" in terms of enabling illusions. The next thing you know we'll be back to the supreme fictions of a capable imagination. The trouble is that there are always artists around, some very powerful, who claim to be signifying nothing, if not life as a tale told by an idiot, with a nihilistic view of it that's not exactly a correct politics, though it's by no means unpolitical or collabo- rating with Jesse Helms. The question of nihilism merges with the question of commodification in Ferdinand Schmatz's reflec- tions on Viennese actionism and the poetry of the Vienna Group, its texts, montages, and ideograms. The essay concludes with judgment of certain subcultural forms, pop and punk, that trans- formed the energies of actionism into a nihilistic vitalism, only to succumb to "economic exploitation." Whatever his reservations about actionism, its quasi-mystical sensuality and ethos of excess, Schmatz admires its unrelenting pursuit of a reality unbound by behavioral or linguistic conven- tions. He sees the dynamism of action-events, its games, mutila- tions, obscenities, pissings, shittings, eviscerations, as part of a worldwide assault during the sixties upon calcified institutions, especially the repressive apparatus of the linguistic system itself. Reality, as thus construed, had to be broken, even at the risk of</page><page sequence="15">Spring 1992 15 breaking the body encoded by it. By proceeding into the psyche through the charged stratifications of the body, actionism would presumably lead to an eruption of symbolic force, to a liberation of the drives themselves, by a kind of reversal of sensory depriva- tion, overloading the senses, arousing them to a pitch of revul- sion and dismay. This is not merely lowering the barriers between art and life, but at the level of the nervous system leaving no space between the spectator and the performance. As an art of intervention, the movement might be described as going from action to activism to atavism. Direct reality was the watchword, without mediation, as bodies themselves became, with increasing violence in the abandonment of painting, the expressive material. Or, if painted with abandon, there'd be a better pigment: saliva, urine, feces, vomit, blood, sweat, sperm; the certification of life as art in the form of its excretions; sym- bolic waste instead of language and its hollowness of signs. Schmatz questions the hyperbolic enterprise of self-desecration and its brutalizing depredations upon the idea of art; the disgust piled up, but what surfaced in the waste was another romantic testament to individual creativity. In this context, moreover, the scattering of paint or piss, or an incision in the body, were of similar consequence. Sensational it may have been, but what it obscured is the functioning of conscious acts in a supportable politics. That is where Schmatz himself draws the line. So far as he can see, the intoxicated dismemberings of the Orgies Mystery Theater, presided over by Hermann Nitsch, far from being demystifying, remained only mythological. As for the suicidal Rudolf Schwarzkogler, his performances "pushed alienation into proximity with a social-mystical truth." Shocking as they were, they were subject to a ruthless formalism, in which castra- tion was made sacred. As for the poets of the Vienna Group, they were among those proclaiming the death of the author, while endorsing an alogical gesture aroused to an "act of extraordinary beauty," if not the "convulsive beauty" of Breton's ideal in Nadja. What actionism radicalized, however, in psychophysical terms, the Viennese Group still tried to contain, linguistically, within a conformation of meaning. The two groups had much in common, but among the poets there was still a grammar of motives, scored, fully so, both phonological and phonetic, with rhythm, pitch, noise con- tributing equally to the syntactic progress," hovering still "above a semantics of experience." If there was an incipient nihilism, risked or even sought, its possibility was not in the abrogation of consciousness and its laws, but in the investigation of those laws,</page><page sequence="16">16 Discourse 14.2 "against which nihilism first turned. " In all this, language remained a critical resource, as it was not in the nihilistic sensu- ality of the actionists whose ecstasies, according to Schmatz, com- promised "the ability to act." But was that really so? and to what degree, among actions really possible, was any particular artist compromised? Schwarzkogler, I suppose. Yet even the myth of his methodically slicing off his penis may remain in the perversity of cultural transmissions a generative model of performance, as Artaud's madness has been, though few would care to live it, or the agony of his last unspeakably self-consuming performance at the Vieux Columbier, astonishing Gide and others. This is an inevitable issue in the aesthetics of excess, as it has always been in the politics of art: what exactly is compromised or disempowering? for whom? where? under what circumstances? and however con- scious acts may function, or the vanities of ecstasy, its dissipations, what are we to make in our cultural theory of the apparently disempowering practice that seems, now or later, to empower others? In the body of practices rehearsed by Kristine Stiles, known as "destruction art" - connected by its violence to Viennese actionism - the ability to act is a matter of survival, with the artist-as-survivor bearing witness to the collective. Drawing on Robert Lifton's study of a "genocidal mentality" and the aesthet- ics of Gustav Metzger and Rafael Ortiz, the essay by Stiles focuses on a thoroughly invested but still little-known form that, by means of autodestruction, attempts to convey the ontological effects - and with it the direct sensation, the unevadable feeling - of a culture destroying itself. Strategically, this art requires being "culturally invisible," obscurity allowing the artists to dis- seminate messages on survival without being drawn into the mar- ket system which otherwise jeopardizes their mission. The liability is that in being undetected autodestructive art is, like the ecstasies of the actionists, subject to solipsism, self-mystification, and what the de(con)structionists fear to begin with: disappear- ance. This is not exactly the kind of performance made by Chris Burden - who has wounded his own body but survives in the mainstream of art - when he announced he would disappear, and then did. Burden reappeared (after three days, as I recall), and despite its underground ethic, destruction art hasbeen seen. When it is, according to Stiles, it intensifies the vast if subliminal experience of the immanence of disaster into the "temporal duration" of a manageable representation. What came from the work of Metzger and Ortiz, as from other practitioners of the art</page><page sequence="17">Spring 1992 17 of risk or self-abuse (Burden, Stuart Brisley, Gina Pane, Jochen Gerz) is a paradigm of the "resisting body" in a state of emer- gency. It was, however, not only body art or actionism that shaped the commitment and values of autodestruction. Whatever its theoretical linkage with deconstruction - and therefore the critique of the humanist tradition - autodestruction is still very much invested in that tradition, as Stiles points out. Violating the body is, in the paradox of performance, a testament to the human: not only a sign of its endurance but, in either the impla- cability or mania of self-determination, an inviolable respect. The resisting body is the subject of performance, and always has been, even when the body is absent (as Beckett perceived in his synoptic Breath) . And what does the body resist except dehuman- ization. That's why the return of the human figure could be anticipated in painting once the painters themselves moved into performance. "The artists who shifted from figuration to the medium of the body itself," Stiles writes, "not only appended the representational model of the visual arts to a presentational form, they also contributed to the revitalization of representa- tional figuration in the late 1970s and 1980s." There are those who are somewhat jaundiced about the return of figuration, and what that actually represents in the marketplace of signs. Yet there is a linkage between that return and the developments in performance art. So far as body art or autodestruction are concerned, the heavy investment in bodies, and the body's pain, brings up what seems a more significant issue: with all the theoretical emphasis today on historically con- structed bodies, it is the body in pain that invariably returns us to the body we all share, the essential body , threatened all over the world by the genocidal mentality and embraced as it has been by humanistic thought. If the body is, as Stiles writes, "the privileged signifier of the social, material, and historical conditions of the body," the presence of an actual body in the art of autodestruc- tion does not so much cancel as "quicken and intensify the dialogue on survival on which all issues of humanism . . . turn." And the issues turn, through the quite justifiable critique of humanism, back to its terms (as we see, now, almost everywhere in the world where the body has been abused by gratuitous power) , so long as the human figure, and not ciphers, robots, cyborgs, or other technological surrogates, remains at the heart of perfor- mance or in the center of the stage. There may, of course, be mutations of that figure, as in virtual reality or gender-bending, or the psychosexual masquerades of</page><page sequence="18">18 Discourse 14.2 certain kinds of feminist theater, with the performer, maybe, looking like an actor again. What is there for women in the modern theater? Patraka introduces that question at, so to speak, the wrong end of the telescope, at the moment when Brech≈•s Galileo responds to his daughter's asking whether he'd found anything in the sky by suggesting (inadvertently?) that there's nothing there for her. What Patraka explains, by rethinking the accepted path from modernist drama to feminist performance, is the completer nothing that comes of that nothing in the wid- ening mimicry of a feminine space, "putting the cunt back in the country," as one of the women says in a play by Holly Hughes. Nevertheless, Patraka asks, must this repossession of female space take place, as ever, in the Name of the Father? In short, is the nothing itself gendered, or is it the same at the doubly windowed zero of Beckett's Endgame as it is in the lesbian revels of Hughes's Dress Suits to Hire , with its tentative promise of a "world without end" rather than - as if the terminus of phallogocentric logic - "the end of the world"? Whatever the prospect of answering that difficult question, what is clear in feminist performance is that survival is not enough. Patraka attempts to show how, in a theater work like Dress Suits or the performance art of Karen Finley, "the empty laboring space of female representation" is filled to overflowing (at least at the level of desire) with other narrative possibilities and, in the variable costume of gender, another mode of perfor- mance, charged not only with alternative (ob-scene) sexuality, but in the parturient play of perversity, maybe the unforeseen. Patraka recognizes, however, that Hughes does not see (like, for example, Luce Irigaray) any inevitable escape from an economy of the Same, nor from the binarism rejected in a butch-femme aesthetic. As for Finley, Patraka sees her work as the performance of damage , the stream of filth and rage being not, however, a pure semiotic, but (an interpretation of) history issuing from a woman's body; in that respect, so long as the "binary terror" persists, a form of damage control. Reading forwards and backwards, in the configuring of a feminine space, Patraka ends up actually on the Areopagus, where at the end of the Oresteia , terror begetting terror, the goddess Athena proclaims a "just terror," the reign of law, with the jury system itself, as another form of damage control. That's exactly where we are in the prefatory note of David Crane's essay, the jury about to convene on the trial of Jeffrey Dahmer, as if the verdict of either sanity or insanity could conceivably be - any- more than with Gilles de Rais - the justice that fits the crimes.</page><page sequence="19">Spring 1992 19 Were he not warning us in the note that the revelation of the Dahmer murders had occurred as he was writing, Crane would be leading us into the grislier matters of his essay, whether in Viennese actionism or Gilles de Rais, with a conceptual sleight of hand. As it is, he moves us into that terrain through the trick- ery of Houdini and "the reality of [that] trickery as it presages the trickery of the unrealizable Lacanian real," with the shadow of theater in his scrutiny of "the moment of impossibility." Such a moment, he points out, is vital not only to the magician's rep- ertoire but to the reality of illusion accounting for plausibility in any "performed revelation." The essay doesn't address the the- ater directly - not as a social institution, twinned at the Areop- agus to the judicial system - but it carries along its own testament to the dismembered god of the tragic theater, where the body's pain is transfigured, or invested by mimesis with tran- scendent value. The tragic theater is constructed around taboos broken with various degrees of terror or terrorism by Dahmer, the actionists, and Gilles de Rais, but what, Crane asks, "if the taboo is itself a magic box, with mirrors and false bottoms, cap- turing expectation and belief in the reality of its illusions?" What Crane does overall is to evoke through a series of unex- pected conjunctures out of history and theory, from the eruption of Vesuvius to the magic of Houdini to Lacan's borromean luiots, the supreme intensity of the illusion of transcendence. Appall- ingly, it is an illusion arising from horrors that, beyond revulsion, become legend. In the process, another kind of perversity is examined: the desire in performance for a cleansing atrocity that might heal a diseased world, what is subliminally recorded in the dramatic theater, like the feast of Thyestes, or released into the theater yet to be born, like Artaud's plague. What Artaud was after, or later Nitsch, in the bloodletting mythopoeia of his orgi- astic theater, was a "totalizing ritual," homeopathic, that shatters abreaction in the encounter with the real. If the taboo is shat- tered with it, is the performer still human? The monstrous Gilles de Rais is the consummate master of a theater of cruelty in which every desecration may be performed, even those that would have been censored by the actionists, like the cannibalism and lobot- omies of Jeffrey Dahmer, which were to have - though banalized by the press (as I write) and the monotone of the trial - their own ritual temple, a space of power and control, "a center for gathering energy," as he said. After Brech≈•s critique of the "barbaric delights" of tragedy - its incapacitating destiny, divesting us of the energy for social change - we theoretically withdrew from the master narratives</page><page sequence="20">20 Discourse 14.2 or etiological dramas that would seem to make sense by preserving the mystery of the criminally insane. The curious juxtapositions of Crane's essay confront us, however, with this perdurably dis- tressing complex of thought: so far as we are still fascinated by excess, wanting to hear more about it almost in proportion to the revulsion, endowing the worst atrocities with description and explanation, drawing them (out of fear?) into the circuit of our own self-understanding, even veiling the crime with (absurd) orders of guilt (sanity? insanity? or just terrori ), maybe feeling (unimaginably?) compassion or pity, then we are back to the prospect of a form like tragedy, which - without minimizing the horror, or image of that horror - shifts attention from the bar- baric dead to the "phantom of forgiveness" that was, perhaps, the ultimate trickery of reality itself, or the "human nature" in which, theoretically, we no longer believe. The banalization of performance by the media is at the mar- gins of the essay by Josette F√©ral, but intrinsic to Gerhard Lischka's. While F√©ral sees performance as having emerged, in the seventies, as a function of critical theory, Lischka works his way toward the conception of it as a life art by approaching it to begin with as a creature of the media. It was McLuhan who first alerted us to the immanence of the media, which shadow perfor- mance as a virtual reality. For Lischka, it is the conversion of McLuhan's adage that "the medium is the message" into the surfiction of mediafication, with its quasi- or pseudo-events, that defines our needs and desires, even when we're unpersuaded by the message. Thus, the media must be rethought rmiedially, so that they may not continue to function as a kind of collective unconscious. If there appears to be a contradiction here, that occurs to the extent that there is any consciousness of being persuaded by what we know is more than a massage, that we are being worked upon seductively even by what we don't believe. In a sense, the media have the status in Lischka's thought that ideology has with Althusser, so far as it is inseparable from the scene of the unconscious, not merely the subject position interpellated, but the life spontaneously lived. Which leaves us with the question of how to undo it, assuming an equally spon- taneous distance that makes us feel we want to. Mediafication in Lischka resembles commodification in Debord, who defined the spectacle (for the situationists) as our major commodity, " capital to such a degree of accumulation that it becomes an image" (paragraph 34). Lischka doesn't speak of the spectacle, but for him performance is always happening somewhere within the</page><page sequence="21">Spring 1992 21 network of commodification, as part of its feedback system, including the world's misery, which happens at a safe distance because of mediafication, of which it could be said that it 4 4s fed by the reality whose blood it sucks only to leave it behind as if it were unreal." Yet, according to Lischka, the mediascape of mediafication can be doubly understood: either from the perspective of the actor or agent who happens to be in the scene (the actors acted upon, the agent without agency) or from that of the actor choos- ing to be there, with a critical sense, apparently, of where and why. For Lischka, this is the difference between performance in gen- eral - omnivorous performance as it seems to possess and dis- possess us of life - and performance art , which is, in the spiral of fascination that is the media, the medium between , what blurs the distinction between "art/poetry and life and an artistic (or whatever) transformation." Before he comes to this in-between state of performance art, he speaks of it as if defining the Noh drama of the Japanese theater, the word Noh meaning an accom- plishment, or with a nuance from the word jfrƒçrformance itself, the completion of an accomplishment. It is an accomplishment that "fascinates and enchains us." Lischka wants, however, to pre- serve the fascination and throw off the chains. With the body as ground zero, performance art is seen "as a floating instance of bodily poetic presence." Once again he seems to be describing the drifting and ghostly figures on the poetic stage of the Noh, but the presence he has in mind is not the tethered otherworld- liness of a hieratic form. It is rather one which acts as a guarantee of the persistence of human values in dialogue, being "the global embodied language of poetic freedom." F√©ral does not deny the freedom, and it may even be poetic, but she is not so sanguine about the material consequence of the global embodiment. In her view, the end of the eighties seems to have signaled the death of performance, so that we're now conducting - even perhaps in this issue? - something like the autopsy of function. As indicated earlier, she sees the death signal as something of an illusion, as performance shifts from its sym- biotic relation with an oppositional discourse to an artistic genre widely accommodated, even in the media, from which it may have been born, but which may very well be its grave. F√©ral and Lischka are speaking mainly of performance art, but this might be the time to remind ourselves that performance can also be approached as a phenomenon so multifarious that no genre could contain it, and not only because it is crossing the arts or mixing the media, which still contains it within the con-</page><page sequence="22">22 Discourse 14.2 cept of art and the boundaries of the artworld. As I said at the outset, most of the phenomena considered here developed within those boundaries. We might also have considered, how- ever, with an ethnological slant, the range of occurrences cov- ered by what was once, really, The Drama Review, now subtitled "A Journal of Performance Studies." Its ever-widening compass inscribes the whole known world, virtually seeing the world in the image of performance. In any case, one might find articles there on circus, sports, the martial arts, the Macy's parade, Hasidic dancers, Sufi whirling, voodoo rites, harvest ceremonies or circumcision, fantasy sex, and not only fantasy sex, but the real thing, that performance, which may suggest, however, that all sex is merely fantasy. Even this widening, however, of the consciousness of perfor- mance was born, as F√©ral says of performance art, out of the movement of contestation initiated by the sixties and reaching its apogee in the seventies. Within the artworld, the making of performance was invested during this period with enthusiasm and instrumentality not only by the merging of various disci- plines, but by a practice whose authorization seemed divided or shared among the artist, critic, and the spectator. Performance itself became a heuristic principle in other disciplines, and a methodology of critique. "At bottom," F√©ral writes, "all dis- course on performance, all the more so on its disappearance, remains a discourse around performance, a discourse on critical discourse itself." With a view of performance as emerging not from mediafication but from theorization of an artistic phenom- enon itself, she asserts that to understand the evolution of the practice and its engagement with theory requires moving the interrogation into the larger problematic of modernism itself, which may be the paradigm (suggested by Habermas) for what is dominant but dead. That may account for a tone of mourning in the postmodern condition. In the arts, all of which are recurrently dying, the mourners gather most acutely today, and paradoxically, around the return of painting,5 out of which the happening came, bring- ing with it the enlivening momentum of the idea of perfor- mance. What happened? (It's important to remember, as the conceptualists did, that performance occurs as an idea , as a pre- cipitation of thought, though when the body is caught up in it, what happens then is blooded thought.6) Baudrillard updated, or compounded, the question by asking, what happened after the orgy? An adequate response may take another issue of Dis-</page><page sequence="23">Spring 1992 23 course , because what has been happening to performance has been happening to critical theory, which is enlivened now by its movement toward cultural studies. This is likely to turn attention, with multicultural variants, to what are by now quite recognizable modes of performance, perhaps not merely artistic genres, since often attached to tribal rites and religious worship, which are already severely threatened by world tours or by video cameras at all the festivals or, unto the heart of darkness, in every jungle, desert, or bush. We shall nevertheless be seeing forms of theater and dance by people of (other) color, with techniques that have already been absorbed in the forms of Western theater, or in performance art. This doesn't mean that such forms won't bring renewed energy with them, or oppositional practice, but so did the theater of realism and naturalism, whose techniques, as we might have guessed, are being merged with both traditional and avant-garde practices elsewhere in the world. Meanwhile, if the history of modernism seemed to require an apocalyptic myth, the recurrency of its dying, that came about in painting, we might remember, with the birth of photography, that memorializing form which seems a function of mourning. Like the theater. (A connection that Roland Barthes made use of in Camera Lucida , a book of mourning.) There may be some reason now, if we follow F√©ral, to start mourning performance, but it should be no surprise that in recent years the body of the performer has been flattened into the photograph, most notori- ously by Cindy Sherman, who started with the movie stills and has been drawing upon the theater, which is the form of disap- pearance suffusing all performance, now you see it now you don't, as if the trickery of Houdini came from the sacred grove, or wherever Oedipus went to when, in the critique of binary terror, he was not merely flattened by theory. Wherever things may be going now, with or without prosthesis, it's not clear that the thought of performance has been always enlivened by that. Notes 1 Fried's polemic, "Art and Objecthood" (first published in Artforum in June 1967) , was influenced by his study of Diderot and the pejorative view of theatricality in the art and theory of mid-eighteenth century France. The essay was one of the focal pieces in Gregory Battcock's well-known anthology, MinimalArt (116-47), and as recently as 1987 the Dia Foundation organized a symposium around it, which Fried himself led off by remembering his first encounters with the</page><page sequence="24">24 Discourse 14.2 highly charged mise-en-sc√®nes of minimalist installations by artists like Robert Morris or Carl Andre. What disturbed him at the time was the "surefire" effect of such theatricalized experience, which was precisely for that reason "essentially ¬ø^artistic" (Foster 55-56). 2 See Hal Foster, "The Crux of Minimalism," in Singerman 169-93. 3 The participatory mystique was a primary motive in the experi- mental theater activity of the sixties, with the Living Theater or the Performance Group, but the concept was articulated by Norman O. Brown in one of the gospels of the period, Love's Body 245. 4 This is actually the tide of Roland Barthes's essay on the Bunraku theater of Japan, in which the puppet performing "does not ape the actor, it rids us of him," in particular our concept of the naturalistic actor of the bourgeois theater, whose body "borrows from physiology the alibi of an organic unity, the unity of 'life' " ( Image-Music-Text 171) . 5 See, for instance, Yves-Alain Bois, "Painting: The Task of Mourn- ing," in the catalogue entitled Endgame, ed.Joselit and Sussman 29-49. 6 On thoughts being bloody or nothing worth, as Hamlet insisted, see Blau, Blooded Thought.
