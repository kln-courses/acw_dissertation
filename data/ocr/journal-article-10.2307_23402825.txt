<plain_text><page sequence="1">Charles Theodore Russell: Source of "A Walk to Wachusett" Robert Young £ £To the observer from the top, the whole state lies, spread out like a map." While this passage may seem to originate from Henry David Thoreau's journal, or from his essay "A Walk to Wachusett" (1843), this quote comes from Charles Theodore Russell's book The History of Princeton, published in 1838.1 By comparison, Thoreau's signature line in "A Walk to Wachusett" reads, "Wachusett is in fact, the observatory ot the state. There lay Massachusetts, spread out betore us in its length and breadth, like a map."2 The connection between the two is clear, and it is worthy of investigation. Charles Theodore Russell was born in Princeton, Massachusetts on November 20, 1815, the eldest son of Charles Russell and Persis Hastings. Besides his brother Thomas Hastings, Charles also had a sister Sarah Ann, although she passed away at the age of fifteen. They were of the sixth generation in the Russell family, descendants of the family patriarch David Russell born about 1775.3 Both Charles and Thomas attended Harvard College where Charles graduated as a member of the Class of 1837. Another member of that class was none other than Henry David Thoreau. There is little doubt that Thoreau "was closely acquainted with Russell" and that they "often exchanged volleys at the debating club." In the class book, it is reported that Russell "once burst into Thoreau's dorm to harass him and a newly arrived Concord freshman because of their town pride."4 As this anecdote suggests, both Russell and Thoreau were interested in the history of their respective towns. For his part, in 1838 Russell took it upon himself to compile a history of Princeton that was subtitled "A Sketch of the Present Religious Controversy in that Place." Though concentrating heavily upon the beginnings of the town and its ecclesiastical history, he nonetheless included a section on the "scenery" of the countryside. Therein, he wrote of the hills, their natural beautv. and—of course—"the Wachusett."5 It is as beautiful a written review of the mountain as one might find, and it resonates with the vision and the depth of natural beauty still in residence on the mountain. The writing styles of Russell and Thoreau are quite similar. Specifically, in their writings about Mount Wachusett, their words are not only similar, but, in some cases, identical. Timothy Dwight, in 1821, was the first to describe the shape of the mountain as conical when he describes it as "a single eminence of an obtuse, conical figure."6 While this description might be accurate, it is also passive and without energy. Russell, on the other hand, breathes life into the conical shape by creating an anthropomorphic entity that must have resonated with the poetic mind of Thoreau. For Russell, "The mountain rears its conical head 1900 feet higher."7 In "Wachusett," Thoreau polishes this image further in a four-line, unnamed poem; he deletes the depiction as a conical shape while retaining Russell's image of the "rearing" head of the mountain: Not unconcerned Wachusett rears his head Above the field, so late from nature won, With patient brow reserved, as one who read New annals in the history of man.8 The summit experiences of Russell and Thoreau also indicate Thoreau's indebtedness to his classmate. Russell sets the scene, and his words are simple and to the point: "To the observer from the top, the whole state lies spread out like a map."9 Photographer: Herbert Gleason, from The Writings of Henry David Tltoreau (Houghton Mifflin, 1906).

A Walk to Wachusett</page><page sequence="2">Thoreau Society Bulletin, Number 272, Fall 2010 Thoreau reworks those words for dramatic effect by splitting them and forming two sentences—the first of which is the powerful signature statement. A well written but secondary statement follows to complete Russell's thought: "Wachusett is, in fact, the observatory of the state. There lay Massachusetts, spread out before us in its length and breadth, like a map.'"0 These may be Thoreau's words, but the thought is clearly that of Russell. From his summit observatory, Russell surveys the landscape and guides the reader through a detailed tour of the state. From one end to the other, with specific mention of a number of notable landmarks, he is clearly the expedition leader. In fact, this piece of writing by Russell is perhaps his finest effort. He notes that "[o]n one hand, is visible the harbor, distant, in the nearest point, forty eight miles. On the other, the Monadnock is seen rearing its bald and broken summit to the clouds, while the distant Hoosick [sic] and Green mountains fade away in the distance.'"1 Viewing the lands of the Commonwealth from Wachusett as a circumferential picture, as Russell does here, would have attracted Thoreau, and he might very well have used that image in an independent report. But the landmarks Thoreau will mention are not his; he cites the identical sights and the same horizon as Russell: There was the level horizon, which told of the sea on the east and south, the well known hills of New Hampshire on the north and the misty summits of the Hoosac and Green Mountains . . . blue and unsubstantial. . . . But Monadnock, rearing its masculine front in the northwest, is the grandest feature.12 These links are beyond mere coincidence. While Thoreau did not accompany Russell to the summit in 1838, it is obvious he read him before 1843. It is unfortunate that Thoreau did not give credit to Russell, but it is also well known that he frequently neglected to give credit to his sources, as Walter Harding and Michael Meyer have argued.13 Robert Sattelmeyer even suggests that this habit was not without purpose; Thoreau borrows without attribution "in order to preserve the bloom of originality in his works.'"4 To be fair, it was not likely an intentional slight of his ex-classmate or one in which Thoreau, with full intent to deceive, crafted a "new thought" from Russell's contribution. The ethics of writing was simply not a subject to which people gave as much consideration in the nineteenth century as we do today. In fact, there are other examples in "A Walk to Wachusett" in which Thoreau uses the words or concepts of others yet fails to indicate the source.15 In any case, we now know that, beyond writing "a mere hasty sketch" of his town, Russell must be credited with a significant mark on the heritage of American literature.16 But let the evidence also state, very clearly and with no malfeasance toward Russell and others who preceded Thoreau to Wachusett, that only Thoreau could mold those source words and thoughts into such lasting prose.
