BRYANT Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University With very few exceptions, sociologists have ig- nored human-animal relationships and have taken only cursory notice of such related topics as animal liberation and the animal rights move- ment. Keith tester's book Animals and Society: The Humanity of Animal Rights provides soci- ologists with an opportunity to catch up on this very significant social movement. The outcome of the movement will likely have profound so- ciological implications for the structure and dy- namics of the social enterprise itself. The book is not a handbook of ideology about the animal rights movement but is an introduc- tion to the sociology of understanding the ani- mal rights movement. In this regard, the author appropriately begins his exposition with an over- view of the three books that were the progeni- tors of the movement. These were Peter Sing- er's Animal Liberation (1976), Tom Regan's Case for Animal Rights (1984), and Stephen Clark's Moral Status of Animals (1977). Tester feels that these three books were the ideological basis of the animal rights move- ment and that the movement revolves around four major concerns: vegetarianism, opposition to hunting, opposition to the use of animals in science and medicine, and the general welfare of animals. Tester concedes that the animal rights movement is less concerned with animals than with society and humans and the social posture toward animals, and he cynically observes that animal rights seem to apply only to "nice cud- dly mammals." In this regard, he raises the question "Why are rights only accorded to the animals which are most easy to anthropomor- phize?" In his wide-ranging discussion, Tester includes such disparate topics as Walt Disney and anthropomorphism, Edward 0. Wilson and sociobiology, Karl Menninger's psychoanalytic notions concerning attitudes toward animals, Konrad Lorenz's ethological contentions about the human posture toward animals, and Claude Levi-Strauss's structural anthropology. Tester takes particular interest in the historical evolution of human attitudes toward animals and examines the writings of various social historians and historical personages. Some writers have tended to view history as a "civilizing" process. Thus, the seeming mistreatment of or cruelty toward animals in earlier times is seen by some writers, notably Norbert Elias, as an illustration of humans having not attained full civility, and today's "regulated and pacified nation-states," natu- rally more prone to embrace animal rights and kindness to animals, as the result of the civilizing process. Tester rejects such a thesis and instead suggests that the real understand- ing of human attitudes toward animals can be found in the culture of a particular period. Tester concludes his essay with a discus- sion of the flowering and development of the animal rights movement and its various groups. Animals and Society is a splendid exposition of the philosophy of animal rights. It is difficult to fault the book for what it attempts to do. It informs the reader of the growing social sentiment to change the human posture toward animals radically. The animal rights movement, however, is but one position on one dimension of the human- animal relationship. What is needed is fuller documentation and a more detailed analysis of the different human conceptualizations and so- cial meanings of this relationship. Understand- ing the circumstances and rationalizations of the animal rights movement is a step in under- standing the larger topic of animal-related hu- man behavior. Animals and Society is a good guidebook for the former and should prove very useful to the scholar interested in the latter.</page></plain_text>
