Hough ä-AYNE STATE UNIVERSITY/ LIBE ARIES ii</page><page sequence="3">PREFACE At the Saint Louis meeting of the Classical Association of the Middle West and South, which occurred April 22-24, 1954, the suggestion was made by Bert H. Narveson of St. Olaf College that the Classical Journal Index, prepared for Volumes I-XXV by the late Franklin H. Potter, be continued for Volumes XXVI-L inclusive. This suggestion was adopted, and at a subsequent meeting of the Execu tive Committee Dorrance S. White was appointed Editor. At the Chicago meeting in December 1955 and at Lexing ton in April 1956, the Executive Committee of C A M W S and fellow associations approved the form and nature of the present Index. They decreed that it should be less profuse than the preceding Index but should contain all important referable material. They asked the Editor to exercise careful judgment as to what articles should be chosen from Current Events, Hints for Teachers and Teachers' Scrapbook, Notes, Trends and Events, and "We See By the Papers." This has been done. The Editor hopes that nobody has been slighted, in the interest of economy, and that every important item will be found be tween the covers. It might be interesting to note that, whereas 101 clas sicists had to leave the vineyard during the previous quarter of a century (1906 - 1929), 140 departed during the period from 1930 - 1955. Whether those of the latter period had a feebler hold on life or whether those of the earlier period were of an average younger age, it might not be profitable to inquire. The Editor would like to conclude by quoting the final paragraph of the late Professor F. H. Potter in his Pre face of Dec. 1, 1930: "The roster of officers of the Associa tion, to be found on the last pages of the book, will con stitute a monument to those men and women who have unselfishly given their services to the work of the associa tion and to the making of the Journal."
