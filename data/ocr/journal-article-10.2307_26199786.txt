(Madrid: Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas, 2005), 2 vols, li, 1230 pp. Price €69.00. ISBN 84-0008395^. Of the nine-centuries long history of Muslim presence in the Iberian peninsula (711-1614), it is not surprising that certain periods attract more attention than others. We want to know about the initial conquest of 711, the great days of the emirate/caliphate of Cordova, and how the story ended—the circumstances under which the political independence of al-Andalus came to be lost in 1492. The intervening four and a half centuries may be less familiar, and yet the period of the Almohads (approximately mid-twelfth to mid-thirteenth century), the subject of these volumes, is certainly not lacking in intrinsic interest, and of importance in the history of Islam and in that of Western Europe. Al-Andalus during this period was firmly integrated into a North African state ruled by Berbers. Compared with the earlier periods, for which our sources are frankly poor, sources on the Almohads are quite good. Yet it was only in the second half of the twentieth century (with the work of Huici Miranda and others), that serious progress was made in disentangling the complexities of this most idiosyncratic polity. The need to understand the interlocking of North African with Iberian phenomena presents special challenges. Between 2000 and 2002</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 119 a seminar at the Casa de Velazquez in Madrid under the title of 'The Almohads: problems and perspectives' brought together many of the leading experts in this field. The Casa de Velazquez is the residence in the University of Madrid for scholars from French universities, and the work is a monument to Franco Spanish intellectual collaboration: 18 papers in Spanish, 17 in French, plus two in English from the US, and one in Arabic by a colleague from Morocco, following a succinct 'Presentation' by the editors (38 pp. in Spanish), which draws the various themes together. (Passages quoted from the non-English papers have been translated by the reviewer.) There are roughly equal numbers of papers in the fields of (a) archaeology, epigraphy, architecture etc., (b) political and military history, and (c) philosophy and theology. Were the editors wise to include so many detailed studies on architectural or archaeological technicalities? That their decision was justified is well illustrated by Rafael Azuar's paper on a particular feature of Almohad military architecture—'False bonding {el falso despiece) in masonry and cross arched vaulting' (pp. 123-48). That sounds, and is, narrowly technical in the extreme. However, by learning that the 'masonry' in question is (mostly) not stone at all but adobe with lines superimposed on it to give the look of carefully jointed stonework, the reader grasps very directly the sheer urgency of Abu Yusuf Ya'qub al-Mansur's enormous programme of frontier castles and fortifications. (That the walls were structurally sound all the same is evident from photographs showing them, after more than eight centuries of relative neglect, still standing!) Among other papers in this section, all of high quality, I will mention only 'Textiles of the Almohad period' by Cristina Partearroyo. One would have thought material so relatively fragile would not have survived in a state to permit detailed analysis. However, Partearroyo's professional persistence enables her to present a very complete survey. The sensational defeat of the Almohads at las Navas de Tolosa (al-'Iqab) in 609/1212 meant that the captured banners were carefully preserved as trophies in the chapel of the royal monastery of Las Huelgas (Burgos). Other interesting specimens come from the collection of the Instituto de Valencia de Don Juan, and churches over the north of Spain supply specimens of Almohad luxury silks acquired by wealthy prelates, some of the finest craftsmanship available at the time. Perhaps most striking are the decorative elements from the ornate ceremonial vestments of the renowned archbishop Rodrigo Ximenez de Rada (author, inter alia, of a Historia Arabum). The question of their Berber heritage and its impact must figure somewhere in studies of the Almohads. Constant Hames contributes 'The Almohad dynastic power: between Berber, Arab and Islamic family structures' (pp. 425-50). Manuela Marin in 'The Almohad Caliph, an active and a beneficent presence'(pp. 451-76) shows how 'interventionist' (to use a modern term) these Almohad rulers were—surprisingly ready to take up cudgels on behalf of their subjects in detailed cases of maladministration etc. Hisham al-'Aliaoui's 'The Almohad Chancery' (pp. 477-503, with Pascal Burĕsi) shows that the decisions sent through the chancery to commanders in the field were very much those of the caliph at the centre—he alone, for example, could commit troops to battle. In a state spread over vast distances with limited</page><page sequence="3">I20 BOOK REVIEWS means of communication, the restricted autonomy of action at its peripheries created obvious problems. El-Mostafa Benouis' 'The organization of the qada under the Almohads' (pp. 505-23) is particularly good on the tensions arising between, on the one hand, this centralizing authority and, on the other, the measure of regional decision-making left to local dignitaries in order to keep their loyalty. The centralizing trend led, for example, to local qadl courts having their independent powers to vary waqf settlements taken away and placed in the hands of other levels of the Almohad hierarchy, the huffaz and the talaba. The latter are studied by Emile Fricaud in 'The place of the Talaba in Almohad society' (pp. 525-45). We are helped to understand how such an odd institution as the talaba functioned by an annex in which Fricaud sets out chronologically the career of one Abu 1-Hasan 'All b. al-Qattan, (562-628/1167-1231). He entered royal service at the beginning of Abu Yusuf Ya'qub al-Mansur's reign in 580, making a good impression as a bright young student—tdlib in our sense of the word. He continued under various monarchs as one of the talaba. By the end of his life, he was qadl of Sijilmassa. At one stage he had been shaykb of the talabat al-hadar, i.e. those associated with the court, and he in fact never ceased to be a member of this important 'estate of the realm'. Jean-Pierre Molĕnat on 'The military organization of the Almohads' (pp. 547-65) reaches this surprisingly negative conclusion: 'Mirroring the dimensions of the empire itself, the Almohad army appears as a body that one might well describe as 'elephantine' in its dimensions, and which, because of its heterogeneous make-up, was rendered incapable of efficacious action. The contrast with the Hispanic Christian armies, which were remarkable for their mobility, is striking' (p. 562). Against this argument one might point out that, although this army did lose the one vital battle in 1212, it had proved itself highly efficient on many previous occasions. Christophe Picard's parallel study of 'The naval policy of the first Almohad caliphs: a system of governance and of sovereignty' (567-84) concludes with an extremely positive evaluation: 'Never again was the Maghreb to be the home of an equivalent naval power, or one with a similar determination to establish mastery over the seas. In this respect too the Almohad dynasty stands out as unique, in contrast to its predecessors and successors.' Rejae Benhsain Mesmoudi and Pierre Guichard study 'The Sultan's wealth: fiscality and coinage in the Almohad period' (pp. 585-615). One of their firm conclusions surprised me and them: 'The Almohad period appears to stand out not only insofar as the types [of coin] are concerned (the famous square dirhams and the modification of the weight of the dinars) but also in the [metal of the] coinage in circulation. There occurred a remarkable, if not radical, discontinuity as compared with preceding periods. Whereas under the Almoravids gold coins had circulated in quantity and had been imitated in Christian lands, this seems not to have happened to the same degree under the Almohads [...] Might one conclude that it was to Almohad silver coinage that people normally had recourse, and that it circulated in spite of the ideological conflict between the regime of Ibn Mardanlsh and that of the Almohads?' Vincent Lagardĕre in 'The Almohad Jihad: theory and practice'</page><page sequence="4">BOOK REVIEWS IZI (pp. 617-31) argues that with the Almohads the concept of jihad underwent a modification. From being a collective obligation discharged by the State, it became an individual one, laid upon every Muslim, Andalusi or Maghrebi—all should contribute to the jihad by payment of a supplementary tax (ma una), and be ready to sacrifice 'even the religious obligation of pilgrimage to Makka' (p. 617). What is more, 'According to Ibn Tumart (524/1130) jihad ought to be prosecuted not only against non-Muslims but also against Muslims [meaning, principally, the Almoravids] who refused to adopt Almohad doctrine' (p. 618). Yassir Benhima's, 'The evolution of the population and organization of land-use in the region of Safi in the Almohad period' (pp. 651-84), at first sight narrowly local, brings out a number of the broad themes of North African history of this period—the sedentarization of nomads, the Arabization of certain Berber populations, potentially disruptive arrival of immigrant Arab (badu) groups from the east, not to mention numerous other motives for strife and conflict. Benhima assesses the Almohad handling of these multi-dimensional administrative problems as very successful. His study shows them behaving not in accordance with any narrow racial or tribal Berber loyalties, but with broad wisdom and statecraft. 'Stopping the movement of the [Berber] tribes down from the High Atlas, and then blocking off in a sustained way the settlement of Arabs, demonstrated the [Almohads'] determination to rescue the agricultural wealth of a region that was the true bread-basket of the Moroccan south from the harmful consequences of endless warfare' (p. 664). Maria Jesus Viguera studies 'The reactions of the people of al-Andalus to the Almohads' (pp. 705-33). One potent myth, seeking to explain the relatively rapid collapse of the Almohad regime in the thirteenth century, stresses the resurgence of a nationalist Andalusi pride rejecting 'foreign' Berber hegemony, alongside the resentment of the Maliki ulema of al-Andalus at the imposition on them of Almohad orthodoxies and ritual practices. Viguera, aiming to 'break out of the ring of the published generalizations', presents some striking examples of anti-Almohad sentiments from her Arabic sources. One—from al-WansharlsI, al-Mi'ydr al-mu rib (ii. 467)—must suffice to illustrate the raw violence of these polemics. 'One important personage in the congregation [clearly a supporter of the Almohad regime], noticed that the imam, Ibn Mujahid by name, had omitted the dud, and so this man instructed the imam to put it back in, which the imam refused to do, adhering to the old ways. Just outside the mosque, this personage was heard to say: "I told that man not to omit the invocation: if he persists in doing that tomorrow, I will cut off his head with this sword" (and he gestured toward the sword he had in his hand.' The crowd went to warn Ibn Mujahid, but he would not do things differently. The next day he was arrested by servants of the government, taken to the Jawhar gate of Seville and there beheaded. Dominique Urvoy in 'Ibn Tumart's professions of faith: textual and doctrinal problems' (pp. 739-52) presents a relatively brief, authoritative survey of the debate on whether Ibn Tumart's texts should be regarded as basically in harmony with Ash'ari teachings, or whether they were syncretistic [Ash'ari/Mut'azili/ falsafa] innovations, as some would claim (without, as Urvoy acidly observes,</page><page sequence="5">IZ2 BOOK REVIEWS being troubled by the contradictions in what they claim). Urvoy seems to have little patience with the short version of Ibn Tumart's creed, the Murshida. This is merely, he says at one point, 'an unrefined statement of dogma directed at the uneducated masses (vulgaire inculte)' (p. 745). On Ibn Taymiyya's view of such credal statements, Urvoy's dry observation is: 'One wonders whether he had read anything other than the Murshida'. The next paper (one of the two in English) by Frank Griffel, 'Ibn Tumart's rational proof for God's Existence and Unity' (pp. 753-813), takes a much more charitable view of the Murshida, and clearly admires Ibn Taymiyya's analysis of Ibn Tumart. Griffel's own view is in summary that 'all his [Ibn Tumart's] teachings should still be considered Ash'arism, albeit not "classical Ash'arism".' Delfina Serrano in 'Why did the Almohads call the Almoravids "anthro pomorphists"' (pp. 815-52) points, in the Book of Ibn Tumart, to the chapter dealing with 'the Almoravids who tell lies'. To go into explanations of the anthropomorphism of the mulaththimun [i.e. the veil-clad Almoravids] Ibn Tumart judges to be otiose: 'They will not enter Paradise'.. .'it is obligatory to wage holy war against them'. Serrano cuttingly remarks: 'This manner of presenting the case invites the suspicion that reasons in support of what was being affirmed were lacking', (p. 817). She sees through the underlying motivation of Almohad propaganda: 'with these motives in mind... it did not hesitate to present a manipulated and distorted view of the theological and juridical positions adopted by their enemies the Almoravids' (p. 846). Marc Geoffroy 'Concerning the Almohadism of Averroes: Anthropomorphism (tajsim) in the second version of Kitdb al-Kashf'att manahij al-adilla' (pp. 853-94, of which 886-94 are an edition of a later redraft of the Arabic text of this work from MS Kopriilii 1601). As Geoffroy puts it, the revised text that he presents from the Kopriilii MS 'invites one to reconsider' (p. 882) such views as that Averroes, 'in the early years of the dynasty, was, with the enthusiasm of youth, an Almohad militant, who then in the works of his mature years seems to have continued to adapt the teachings of Ibn Tumart to his own purposes, but was doing so more discreetly, because the doctrine had more or less lost credit.' Geoffroy now suggests, thanks to a fresh text he is able to bring to our attention, that: 'towards the end of the reign of Abu Ya'qub it was the ruler himself who invited Averroes to make a redraft (rĕĕcriture) of the text of his work, for at that period the State was still headed by the protector (gardien) of a strict and uncompromising Almohadism unwilling to tolerate any straining of the principles enunciated by its infallible Mahdi.' Maribel Fierro, 'Juridical Doctrine and Practice under the Almohads' (pp. 895-935) is a comprehensive, magisterial survey of a large subject. 'The important aspect of these attempts at radical renovation—presented as a return to doctrinal roots—was to identify where the authority lay for what Muslims do and what they believe' (p. 925). Jean-Pierre Van Staevel's 'Almohads and Malikites in Tunis: Some thoughts on relations between civil elites and ruling elites in Ifriqiya in the VI/XII—VI11/ XIV centuries' (pp. 937-73) provides a revealing analysis of the 'paradox that the renovation of Maliki law was strengthened precisely when the military and tribal</page><page sequence="6">BOOK REVIEWS 123 caste of the Banu Hafs were ruling Ifriqiya in the name of a heterodox ideology, that of the Mahdi Ibn Tumart' (p. 937). Teresa Garulo, 'The panegyrics of the Almohad period' (pp. 975-94) picks up on recent revisionist work (largely appearing in English—Meisami, Stetkevych, and others), according to which the act of recitation of the panegyric is to be seen (rather than as an exercise in servility) as 'collective reaffirmation of loyalty to the monarch', and she successfully applies similar approaches to the Almohad period (Ibn Sahib al-Sala, Ibn 'Idhari etc.). Ahmad 'Azzaoui, taking up where Levi-Proven^al had left off in 1941, edited (in two volumes in 1995-2001) a further 'New collection of Almohad letters' (Rasail muwahhidiyya, majmu a jadida). Here, in 'Religious references in Almohad letters' (in Arabic), pp. 995-1012 he shows the range of subject areas (much wider-ranging than what is strictly 'religious') to be found in such documents. Miguel Vega, Salvador Pena, Manuel C. Feria Garcia, 'Almohad doctrine through numismatics' (pp. 1013-49) argue against the alleged sharp discon tinuity between Almohad coinage and what had gone before, and are reluctant to accept that elements of an administrative nature (such as dates) were eliminated from the inscriptions on coins for religious reasons. Such an idea is dismissed as 'fictional' (ficticia). Changes in coin design, it is suggested, were not due to the intervention of Almohad rulers or ideologues, but to requirements arising naturally out of practical design decisions. The authors have undertaken a thorough reappraisal of coin-production in this period that must be taken seriously by specialists. The six illustrations to this paper are well-selected and competently photographed so that the words are clearly legible. (As much cannot be said, sadly, of some plates earlier in the work.) Mayte Penelas in 'The precept of al-amr bi-l-ma ruf wa-l-nahy 'an al-munkar in the Tafsir of al-Qurtubi' (pp. 1051-73) shows that al-Qurtubl probably did not leave his native Cordova until after the Christians conquered it in 1236. He subsequently lived in Egypt until his death in 1271, that is—as Penelas points out—well after the end of the Almohad period. Penelas investigates whether Almohad influences are discernible in his commentaries. In 'The organization of the Sufis and their limits in the Almohad period' (pp. 1075-90), Halima Ferhat tells us how she began with a view that there was a straightforward dichotomy between (state) power and Sufism. Her study shows us why she now sees 'the situation as much more complex': 'Under Almohad rule Sufism became one of the essential ingredient elements of social and political life in Morocco' (p. 1088). Sarah Stroumsa in 'Almohad philosophers? Averroes, Maimonides and Almohad ideology' (pp. 1137-62) confronts the two opposing views: the Almohads as, on one hand, 'fanatics' and 'ultra-puritans' seeking to keep Islamic thought on a tight rein, and, on the other, as rulers of al-Andalus during the period that saw the great flowering of falsafa there. (As she points out, certain of those who have studied the period have gone so far as to see philosophy as forming an integral part of Almohad ideology, and to see Ibn Tufayl and Averroes as fully active participants (participants actifs et a part entiĕre) in the Almohad project. With this last viewpoint Stroumsa disagrees radically: 'One must stress</page><page sequence="7">124 BOOK REVIEWS that the philosophy of Averroes, and that of Maimonides too, remained completely alien (ĕtrangĕre) to Almohad ideology.' This logically brings her into disagreement with some of the ideas expressed, here and elsewhere, by Fierro, Fricaud and others. As for the key anecdote that it was Abu Ya'qub Yusuf himself who ordered Averroes to undertake writing a commentary on the Aristotelian corpus, that is dismissed as a belle histoire. In 'Almohadism: an Islamic context for the work of Saint Thomas Aquinas' (pp. 1163-226, in English), Madeleine Fletcher speaks of Aquinas as 'balanced, optimistic and intellectually omnivorous'. She argues that 'It is the collaboration between Saint Thomas Aquinas and the texts of Averroes which saves Aristotle for Europe' (p. 1217). And of course behind Averroes she sees the Almohadism of her title. 'Averroes is the primary influence behind the development of a positive view of the laws of nature as the expression of God's governance of the world, which became a constituent part of the Western European outlook from the time Saint Thomas first gave it expression until the present day.' The editors (Cressier, Fierro and Molina) have done scholarship a great service by making these wide-ranging studies available in this impeccable form. L. P.
