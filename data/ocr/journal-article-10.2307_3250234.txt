<plain_text><page sequence="1">BALAJI MUNDKUR THE ENIGMA OF VAINAYAKI i mong sculptures of the numerous goddesses of the Hindus, one of the least represented di vis an elephant-headed deity whose precise identification is problematic. She is also one of the least encountered in their religious literature. She is neither known by a consistent name nor are her iconographic attributes clearly specified in mythological lore. Her appearance strik- ingly suggests a connection with the immensely popular elephant-headed god, Ganesa. For this reason more than any other, the very few recorded images of the goddess are currently given names which are the feminine forms of a variety of ethets applied to Ganesa. Thus she is automatically assumed to be the latter's female form or sakti, or his consort- assumptions justifiable only on the basis of recent liturgical evolution. Though the origins of this goddess are mysterious, there is little doubt that her lineage parallels that of the many theriomorphic diviniities and godlings of Hinduism whose roots go back to pre-Vedic times. We shall examine her antecedents so as to understand the significance of one of her recently discovered figural representations as a cult object. Today the names Stri Ganesa, Vainayaki, Gajanana, Vighnesvari and Ganesani would link her explicitly with the god Ganesa. Hence, it is proper to recall the origins of the latter. The literature on this point has been discussed penetratingly by Getty, but that on the goddess is neglected. Getty's most salient conclusion, which follows views expressed earlier by Bhandar- kar,2 is that the cult of an elephant-headed Ganesa cannot be traced back earlier than the fifth century A.D.; this date is clearly supported by archaeological evidence. An illuminating background of his cult, and of the goddess in particular, is provided by certain religious literature which has not previously been cited in this context. One of the ear- liest invocatory references to 'Ganesa' occurs in the Sama-Veda, in the sentence opening the entire work: "Aum ! Glory to the Sama-Veda; to Lord Ganesa, Glory, Aum !" The personage addressed is Rudra-Siva, as the leader of the gana, his celestial attendants. Siva thus acquires the honorific Ganesvara or Ganapati. The title is later extended to several chieftains. Similarly, the name Vinayaka is originally borne by one of Rudra-Siva's 'spirit' companions. Both Ganes- varas and Vinayakas are mentioned in later texts such as the Atharvasiras-Upanisad and the Mahabharata,3 the Vinayakas particularly being regarded as genii who, if propitiated, can expel sin and evil. With these titles as roots for a feminine appellation, it is clearly with Siva that an incipient goddess would have to be identified. I Getty, A., Ganela.

Whether an anthropomorphic, elephant-headed deity, male or female, existed at all in pre-Aryan India is the enigma. We cannot solve it in the absence of archaeological evidence, nor dismiss the possibility of its occurrence as a minor step in the evolution of pri- mitive religious cults splintering off from early Brahmanism itself. Hathivatikas (Hastivratikas) or worshippers of elephants are mentioned even in Buddhist literature ca.4oo B.C., such as the Niddesa (Khuddaka-Nikaya). But the earliest known representation of an elephant-headed personage occurs on a much mutilated terracotta plaque from Rairh, Rajasthan, not earlier than about the first century B.C. to the first century A.D. (fig. ). The body is in a standing posture, lithe and with two hands, and is considered to represent a goddess. Female breasts are not evident, possibly owing to the damaged condition of the plaque. Hand attributes are not discernible; the proboscis is curled to the proper right. Symbols which could associate this figurine with Siva or other gods are completely lacking. One may next turn to the very useful Vayu-Purana. Opinions on its age differ, some believ- ing that it was begun as early as the fifth century B.C. and completed at the latest by 5oo A.D.4 The consensus is that the Vayu-Purana is the oldest of the Puranas5,6 and possesses the best text.6 It is also the only Purana mentioned in the Mahabharata and the Harivatmsa,7 and is a more reliable source of information for reconstructions of historical events than the highly fanciful Puranas which follow it. The recent scholarly work of Patil8 should be consulted for details. The Vayu-Purana specifically refers to elephants, known to have been domesticated and greatly esteemed in Vedic times, as ayajniya animal of ritual significance and as a gift suitable for Brahmans for sraddha or post-funerary obsequies.9 Thus factors favorable to the eventual deification of an anthropomorphized elephant were present early in Hindu culture. Yet, this Purana mentions a Ganesa (Ganapati, Ganesvara) who is neither elephant-headed nor a son of Siva but merely one of Siva's attendants. He is also known as Ksemaka and Nikumbha. It should be noted that he is referred to as a Raksasa, a term which reveals his aboriginal, jungle origins and opens up the possibility of the elephant as the totem of his tribe. Ganesa-Ksemaka was commanded by Siva (perhaps a historical figure elevated to divine status, not to be con- fused with Rudra-Siva of the much earlier Vedic period) to arrange the expulsion of King Divodasa of Varanasi and the destruction of that city; there is the Puranic record of a barber named Mankana who installs at the city gates an image of Ganesa-Ksemaka, doubtless an event presaging the euhemeristic rise of a valiant hero. For it soon becomes an object of veneration to women desiring sons. The cult of Gadapatya could have had such an early beginning, for the Vayu-Purana mentions Siva granting the status of Gdnapatya to favored individuals, of 4 Dikshitar, Some Aspects of the Vayu Purana, (p. 46 f.). s Bhandarkar, R.G., Early History of the Dekkan, I895 (p.

The earliest mention of a female deity bearing a proper name-'Vainayaki'-which could confuse one into linking her with the contemporary god Ganega (by that time known as Vina- yaka) occurs in the Matsya-Purana, compiled ca. 5 so A.D. For Vainayaki, used as an adjective, means "belonging to Ganesa". She is listed in this Purana amid nearly two hundred goddesses,I presumably as a manifestation of one of Siva's jaktis. Their origins very probably lie in the innumerable folk divinities which increasingly creep into the Puranic literature as 'Aryanized' goddesses of the common people. Since the iconographic attributes of the Vainayaki of the Matsya-Purana are unknown, it is difficult to identify one way or the other the few known figural representations of an elephant- headed goddess Iz2 I3, I4 5, I6 with the specific personage mentioned in this Purana. Except for the solitary, pre-fifth century terracotta image from Rairh, all of these representations date from the tenth century or later. Only three bear an emblem-the elephant-goad, rat mount, or a bowl of batasa sweets-which clearly links them with the elephant-headed god Ganesa, whose ascendancy coincides with the era of the Matsya-Purana and of the artistic prolificity of the Gupta emperors and their cultural heirs. Specific indication of the feminine divinities ritually associated with the god Ganesa occurs in a comparatively late work, the Agni-Purana,7, 8, 9 compiled about the tenth century A.D. It is clear that they are to be regarded as his saktis even though, in theory, in the sakti-god consortium it is the former who is dominant and always mentioned first, as in the examples Laksmi-Narayana and Gauri-Safikara. This convention is relaxed in the chapter detailing the ga.napatya ritual, where the image of the god is the initial focus of attention; the feminine divini- ties are invoked only after preliminary prayers to the god, and their names are recited as a part of these and of Mantra or BIja, i.e. mystic syllables forming the essential part of the worship. These female divrinities are conceived as seated on a lotus pericarp, in a group of eight circled around the throne of the ninth. Vainayaki is not one of these nine divinities, who are named Kamarupa, Jvalini, Suryesa, Nanda, Kamavartini, Uda, Vighnanasa, Gandhamrittika and Satya. A puja in the same Purana refers to seven, retaining only Jvalini and Nanda, while introducing Suyasa, Tivra, Ugra, Tejovati and Vindhyavasini. Their iconographic attributes are not de- scribed, suggesting that they were worshipped only conceptually rather than in image form. Io Patil, op. cit., pp. I 6, 38, 64, I87-188 and fn. I 57.

In the case of only the last two are descriptions given, even if incompletely. Tripura is to be contemplated during the Ganesa-puja as seated on a full-blown lotus emerging from the navel of a lifeless Siva-her four hands displaying abhaya (front right), a book (rear right), an aksamald (rosary; rear left) and varada (front left). The mantra to Gauri pictures her as red in complexion, her four hands display ing (in the same order): abhaya, a pasa, a sakti (spear) and varada. There is no hint anywhere in the Agni-Purana that any of the numerous saktis mentioned are to be visualized as having an elephant's head The omission of Vainayaki glaringly contrasts with the use of the appellation Vindyaka for the elephant-headed god in the only passage in the Agni-Purana where his well-known iconic attributes are described.2I It should be stressed that neither Vainyaki nor any of the numerous names of female divinities associated with Ganesa in the Agni-Purana appear among the sixty-four Yogins cited in each of its two lists. 9 But both of these lists contain the name Ksema, intriguingly recalling Ksemaka (GaneSa), Siva's attendant in the Vayu-Purana. On the other hand, an independent list of the sixty-four Yoginis does include Vainayaki.22 Vainayaki is not listed in the Tantrasara, which names nine saktis of Ganesa much like the Agni-Purana list, but a new name, Bhogada, displaces Suryesa. In the Tantrasamuccaya, Satya is displaced and Malya introduced in her place. Of the names mentioned so far, only Vainiyaki occurs intact among the Matsya-Purana's list of about two hundred folk deities; the latter include a few names (Kamarupini, Jvalamukhi, Bhogananda) which may be variants of the Agni-Puranic appellations. In the Bengali recension of the Padma-Pura.na23 (60-II00 A.D.) there is a verse which prescribes homage to Suresvari and Vighnesa. These are probably variant names for two of the saktis appearing in the Agni-Purana; but Vindhyavasini, who could be interpreted either as Siva's sakti or as Ganesa's, is also mentioned. We shall continue with these complexities only briefly. Vindhyavasini and Jvalamukhi in the Visnu-Purana24 are pithasthdnas or sites of temples consecrated to the saktis of Siva. Legend recounts how Siva carried the dead body of his akti, Sati, after her sacrifice to Daksa, until the gods conspired to tear it limb from limb and dropped the pieces at such sites. We have here a contradiction with the Agni-Purana, which mentions Vindhyavasini and Jvalini (= ? Jvala- mukhi) expressly as Ganesa's saktis. There is a similar contradiction in the Kalika-Purana which glorifies Siva, naming Kamarupa (recall that Kamarupa is Ganesa's fakti in the Agni-Purana) as a stronghold of Siva-saktism.25 In the colourful accounts of the preparations for, and the actual battles against the Asuras, 20 Probably the Bengali recension, though this is not indicated by its translator - M.N.Dutt, A Prose English Translation of the Agni-Purdaa, Calcutta, 9Igo04 (cf.

She is joined by various saktis: "Whatever was the form of each god, and whatever his ornaments and vehicle, in that very appearance his Energy advanced to fight the Asuras." One looks in vain through the pages of this Purana for the sakti of Ganesa to materialize, under any name27; indeed it is odd that the god himself-the remover of obstacles- is nowhere mentioned by any epithet. The Silparatna,28 a sixteenth century work from Kerala, is unique in referring to an elephant- headed deity with swelling breasts and feminine hips ("he holds a golden chain in his two hands") as Ganesa. The sense that the deity is the lattert's female form or a composite of Ganesa and sakti is clearly conveyed while leaving the semantics of both nouns unresolved. In today's folk religion, devotees would perhaps name Laksmi (not Sri-Laksmi) as Ganesa's consort or remember that he has three wives-Siddhi, Buddhi and Pusti-whom he won from his brother Skanda in a wager. These bewildering situations can be enlarged, but the information we have is sufficient for some conclusions. From the beginning, the goddess's entry in myths is so overshadowed by the popularity of her consort Ganesa that she is frequently ignored or known by various Puranic names. In contrast to the immense popularity of the images of Ganesa she is not often represented by an icon, not even in human form. She is at no historical period given as much personal adoration as is accorded to Devi as Siva's sakti. Let us decide upon an acceptable name before we discuss a few icons of the elephant- headed goddess. Vainayaki has the advantage of the earliest appearance (in the Matsya-Purana) to the ex- clusion of other feminine variations of the epithets for Ganesa. But its primary value is that its etymology yields a clue as to the goddess's origins. In the context of these origins she may with equal ease be seen as a sakti of Siva,28 or of Ganesa, or as an independent goddess wor- shipped by Buddhists29 and by Jains;30 thus the clearest advantage in retaining Vainayaki as 26 Pargiter, F.E. (trans.) Markandeya-Purana. Calcutta, I904 (pp.473-487; 5OI-509). 27 The Matrikas, according to a commentary of Utpala (ca. 900-9 5 A.D.) on Varahamira's sixth century Brhatsamhita, include "Vainayaki", though Varahamira himself is silent about the names and numbers of these goddesses ! [cf. Banerjea, J.N., The Development of Hindu Iconography. Calcutta, 19 5 6, p. 5 04.] The customary seven or eight Matrikas or saktis defini- tely do not include a sakti of Ganesa, though the latter figures as their "leader," along with Virabhadra, an aspect of Siva. 28 Trivandrum Sanskrit Series, No. XCVIII, part 2, chap. 25, verse 74, quoted by Bhattacharya, D., The composite images of Vasudara and Laksmi. Jour. Asiatic Soc. VIII (4), 26 x-266, I966 [p. 26 5]. 28A Dr. Stella Kramrisch has kindly drawn my attention to the Bodhgyana G.rhya Sutra (3. 9. 3, 4, o) which mentions Jyestha as one of the aspects of the Indian Universal goddess. She is cited briefly in Dr. Kramrisch's recent, illuminating article in History of Religions I4, I975 (p.25 4 and fn.3) as being elephant-faced. This description is consistent with the literal meaning of 'Hastimukh,' one of JyeStha's several epithets. However, it is almost certainly hyperbolic, for it is not borne out in Sanskrit texts; these describe her merely as having a "raised nose" or "long nose," "sagging lips," "flabby belly," etc. Indeed, extant icons identified as Jyestha show her as human-faced (cf. Gopinatha Rao, op.cit., ref. 40, vol. I, pt. 2, pp. 393-399; Banerjea, J. N. Development of Hindu Iconography, Calcutta, I956, p. 382-384). I should add that Jyestha figures also in the Garuda Purana (chap. 23) and in the IsAdrnasivagurudevapaddhati (III, V, I2-14) as one of the nine Jaktis of Sadasiva, but, as one of the conceptual Mandala deities, she has no apparent iconic attributes. 29 Bhattacharya, B., Buddhist Iconography, 2nd ed. p. 349 [In Buddhist literature she is referred to as Ganapatihridaya]. 30 Agrawala, V.S., Prachin Bhdratiya Lokadhatma (in Hindi), pp. I48-149 [original not seen; cited by Sharma, 1970, op.cit., p. 172]. 295</page><page sequence="6">a generic term is that it may flexibly be applied to the image of any elephant-headed female deity who cannot be precisely identified owing to inadequate knowledge of the image's history and cult associations or to discordances in iconographic features. That 'Vainayaki' has aboriginal connotations is apparent from the suffix yaki (jakkhi, jakkhini) the Prakrit for yaksl or yaksii-the feminine generic term for any chthonic semi- divinity. The etymology of the prefix is less certain. It may be traced to 'vana', forest. This derivation is consistent with the fact that in Indian sculptureyaksis are almost invariably de- picted either as humans mounted on an animal, or as partially theriomorphic. The former are well known from decorative elements on the railings and gateways of Buddhist stupas; examples of these are the graceful Culakokayaksi from Bharhut, who stands on an elephant, in her role as a fertility goddess, and a similar bracket figurine from Mathura.31 Examples of theriomorphic yaksis are less well known: a fragment from the Amaravati stupa (ca. third century, A.D.) bears the decorative motif of ayaksa-yaks! couple depicted as garland-bearers with human bodies and elephant heads (fig. 2). Theyaksit has prominent breasts, and though her head is partly damaged her rotund proportions and stance complement the form of her partner. Such early figures doubtless represent an intermediate stage in the evolution of deities from the completely theriomorphic objects of primitive animism to the stage where they become fully anthropo- morphic and acquire iconographic identity. Examples of such paired figures are too infrequent to allow the construction of an evolutionary series which could indicate the dropping popularity of a female, elephant-headed personage and the rise in that of the male partner. As we have noted, the emergence of the god Ganesa, as we know him by his attributes today, occurs abruptly in the fifth to sixth century A.D. Let us turn to a recently discovered icon of Vainayaki (fig. 3), now in the art collection at the Chitrapur Saraswat Math at Shirali, in Western Karnataka.32 This remarkable icon is only sixty-four mm. in height, establishing it as one intended for worship in the household as a family deity. Its history is unknown except that it very likely was the gift of a devotee to the ancillary Saraswat Brahman Math at Kadle, where it was stored away and forgotten for countless decades. It is the first and only metal icon of the goddess yet reported. It is intact except for minor damage to the prabhdvali, which is cast integrally. The metal is 'brassy', but seems to have some gold admixed. The Chitrapur Vainayaki is seated in padmasana on a circular lotus throne supported by a simple, rectangular pitha. She has crinkled, flappy ears. The crown, face and proboscis are smoothly continuous; their details are not cut in the metal, probably deliberately, so that the face is convex and mask-like. The proboscis is ribbon-like, rather than rounded, and its tip curls to the proper right, i.e. to the devotee's left-hand side. In contrast, the naked torso is modelled naturalistically, being full-breasted and svelte at the waist, unlike Ganesa's. There are two neck ornaments, delicately chased despite their small sizes. She wears a yajn-opavita thread across the chest and left shoulder. A looped hip girdle (katisutra) is evident. She is clothed below the waist. The hem of her dress is gathered into folds over her crossed legs. Her four hands have an 'unfinished' appearance, but again this may be intentional as the discussion below might suggest. The front right and left hands are clearly in abhaya ("fear not") and 31 Coomaraswamy, A. K., Yaksas. Smifhsonian Miscellaneous Collections, Vol. 80, No. 6 [Plate 4 (2) and plate 22(1)]. 32 A fuller account of the collection of icons at this Mafb will be published elsewhere by this author. 296</page><page sequence="7">varada (boon-granting) mudrds, respectively. The rear right hand grasps a sword of ancient design, its curved blade ending in an asymmetric flare. The rear left hand grasps apasa, or noose. It is doubtful that this icon is of indigenous manufacture; I would tentatively assign it a prov- enance and date in north-western India-Gujarat or Rajasthan-ca. ioth century A.D., on historical suspicions to be discussed elsewhere, rather than on stylistic grounds alone. Comparisons of the Chitrapur Vainayaki with other known sculptures of the goddess un- fortunately are hampered by their paucity and the seriously damaged condition of most of these stone sculptures: the specimen from Satna33 is potbellied like Ganesa and not narrow in the waist as are most other Vainayakis. Like Ganesa she holds an ankusa (elephant goad) in the right hand. In addition, the Satna Vainayaki differs in that she is merely a minor figure in the composition, dominated by the central figure of an unrelated goddess and hence scaled down in size. Her ankus'a contrasts with the sword carried by the Chitrapur Vainayaki-the latter feature is hardly, if ever, encountered in Ganesa images. Two relatively undamaged specimens exist:34 A fine Pala Vainayaki from Giryek, Bihar, is seated in padmdsana. She is not pot-bellied. She is four-armed, the attributes (in the usual order) being gadd, ghatam, parasu and what appears to be a radish. The other, a Pratihara image, is pot-bellied, standing, four-armed and carries a gadd-parasu combination, lotus bud, an in- distinct object, and a bowl of modaka with the proboscis dipping into it. It should be noted that in both images the proboscis is turned to the proper left and that abhaya and varada mudrds are absent. The sculpture from Ranipfir Jhariyila, Orissa,34 once four-armed, carries in the only sur- viving, rear left hand not apasa, but a paraJu. In a four-armed image from Gujarat3s the only remaining hand, also the rear left, is in adhaya mudra, whereas the Chitrapur goddess shows this mudrd by the front right hand. A very badly damaged two-armed Vainayaki from Rajasthan36 has no right hand but appears to have a bowl (skull?) in her partly broken left hand. A sculpture of Vainayaki from Bhera-Ghat, Madhya Pradesh37 has all four hands severed at the elbows but is otherwise noteworthy among the stone images because she is a seated, not standing, figure unlike the rest. However, she is in the lalitdsana posture, 'relaxed' or at 'regal ease' with one leg pendent and the other drawn up horizontally, in contrast to the 'serious' posture of the Chitrapur Vainayaki. The proboscis in all these cases is either broken off or is apparently curled conventionally towards the proper left side. Thus though each of these damaged stone images possesses some distinctive feature, their value in comparative iconography is limited. The excellent condition of the Chitrapur Vainayaki offers a fortunate opportunity for evaluation of the icon. In summary: with the exception of the padmdsana posture, found in only one other image, all features of the Chitrapur Vainayaki are unique-the sword and noose, the pacific front hands, the mask-like face and the unconven- tional direction of curl of the proboscis to the proper right side. What may have been the nomenclatural identity of the Chitrapur Vainayaki? The religious 33 Sivaramamurti, C., "Parallels and Opposites in Indian Iconography." Jour. Asiatic Soc. (Letters) Calcutta.

Its small size strongly suggests that it was worshipped privately rather than as a major temple deity, but there is very little known of its background to allow more than guarded surmises. One may reasonably assume from the circumstances of its discovery that the icon was the property of a Saraswat Brahman, a member of a Rg Vedic, Saivite, Smdrta clan of Western Karnataka believed to be of Northern Indian, probably Kashmiri, descent. This circumstance would appear strongly to preclude previous use of the icon in ceremonies such as those of the Gdaa- patya, one of the six, now extinct, sects of Saivism. The strong Tantric leaniungs and often de- based, erotic rites of some of these sects which regard Ganesa as the supreme deity do not har- monize with the traditional Saraswat Brahma n emphasi nVedic worship. Yet, the Chitrapur Math also includes in its properties an icon of one of the sternest Gdnapatya sects-a rather rare image (height, 89 mm) of Dasabhuja Maha Ganapati, ten-armed, with his sakti, fully an- thropomorphic, seated on his left lap (fig.4). The image, as far as I have been able to deter- mine, was probably an unknown devotee's ex-voto offering which was stored and forgotten long ago and never publicly worshipped at the Math. There are records at the temple of Daksina-Kedaresvara, dating 1 I I 3 A.D., which identify a certain Somesvara as a "distinguished Saraswat" and as a member of the now extinct Kila- mukha sect of Saivism. And though there are several instances of temples in the Belgaum, Dharwar and other districts of western Karnataka where mildly erotic sculptures (sringara.na) reflect the prevalence of Tantric beliefs, "despite the testimony of Ramanuja, there is little evidence that Kalamukha worship was in any sense Tantric.'38 Thus it is difficult to imagine the extent to which Tantric practices were, in centuries past, shunned or tolerated by lay members of the Saraswat Brahman community. But almost surely such practices, particularly the esoteric Tantric rites, must have been rejected by their Maths. With these qualifications in mind, we may dismiss the thought that the Chitrapur Vainayaki was a cult object of the Gdnapayas.39 As pointed out earlier their practice of contemplating the various saktis of Ganesa as mere abstractions or mental images obviates the need for icons of the goddesses; this is the reason for the multiplicity of names and the absence of iconographic descriptions. In the relatively infrequent iconographic representations of his sakti, her form, as in fig.4, is fully human and subordinate to Ganesa. What, then, do the elephant's head and hand attributes of the Chitrapur Vainayaki mean? The pasa and head immediately suggest a link with Ganesa, but it should be recalled that the pasa is also an attribute of the god Varuna. The unconventional direction of curl of the pro- boscis is hence the most significant clue. As Gopinatha Rao40 observes, it is "generally turned towards the left; only in rare cases do we meet with figures [of Ganesa] with the proboscis turned to the right." These rare images were to be approached only with utmost ceremonial 38 Lorenzen, D.N., The Kapalikas and Kalamukhas.

To the devotee viewing the Chitrapur Vainayaki frontally, the curl of her proboscis to the proper right is of course a curl towards his left hand side. Thus she was most likely venerated by the proponents of "vdmdcdra," or the Sdkta cult of "left-handed practices." It is beyond the scope of this article to discuss details of Saktism. Certain practices of this Tantric doctrine were indeed repugnant, earning for it a bad reputation and obscuring its original philosophy; the intensity of these practices varied greatly between individual devotees as well as in different parts of India. "In Saktism, indeed, as elsewhere in Hinduism, we have two orders of religion living side by side. They are mutually tolerant, indeed each assumes the other to be a phase of itself; one is philosophic, the other popular; one universalistic, the other local; one spiritual, the other magical. Too often Westerners have concentrated their attention on the second."4I In the words of Mahadevan42 Sakta philosophy "makes much sense in the principles taught therein... [it is] non-dualistic (advaita)" agreeing in theory with the ideas of Sankara and in this respect its teachings are "identical with those of Kasmira Saivism" [for] "there is a very near kinship between Saktism and Saivism, especially that form of Saivism which is associated with Kashmir... For both, reality is Siva-Sakti," that is, these ideas are compatible with Chitrapur Saraswat precepts. The Sdkta cultists differed, however, in the mode of worship, adopting vamacadra or unconventional ("left-handed") means to symbolize their belief that release (moksa) of the soul could be achieved by routes other than the ordinary or traditional prayers and rites (daksinacara, "rightist").42 In addition, the actual modes of vamd- cdra worship (also observed by Ga.napatya and other sects) varied greatly from the most benign use of symbols compatible with conservative Brahmanism to excessive behaviour where tradi- tional caste barriers were dissolved and sexual licenses included. It is these excesses which have come to typify Tantrism, with its confusing array of feminine divinities drawn from the Vedas and Puranas. Some of these, though associated with Siva, were reassigned to Ganesa who was glorified above all other gods by Ganapatya cultists. These excesses were never universally ac- cepted by Brahmanism and have no place in the ceremonials of the Smdrta, Saraswat Brahmans. Viewed from this perspective, it may be that the Chitrapur Vainayaki was merely an iconic expression of such Sakta beliefs as were admissible by IKasmira-Saivism and that she was wor- shipped without the florid details of ritual antinomianism which characterized uninhibited vdmcadra Tantra. Suggestive support for this view is seen in the hand-attributes of this image: Sakta-Tantra philosophy classifies souls according to three ascending groups-pasd , vira and divya. Pasu, the soul, akin to that of animals, in bondage, is symbolized by the pasa (noose) in her rear left hand. The soul's progression to the two higher levels by sddhana (meditational accomplishment) takes it through the heroic, vira stage, here symbolized by the sword in her rear right hand; and finally to the level of divya, the divine, symbolized by the mudrads of the two front hands. Still, why the elephant's head, all so rare in the icon of a female? Here, we can only draw upon Saivite myths and speculate: In one of their frequent erotic episodes, Siva and Parvati happen to watch a pair of elephants in sexual intercourse. Their desires aroused, they transform themselves into elephants and give vent to their lusts. The elephant-headed Ganesa, according 4I Payne, E.A., The Saktas. Calcutta/London, I933 (PP.4, 5). 42 Mahadevan, op. cit., p. 203-2 I; also cf. Bhandarkar (Vaisnavism, etc.,) p. I29-131. 30I</page><page sequence="12">to one of the myths accounting for his birth, is the product of this union. In this connection the padmdsana posture of the Chitrapur Vainayaki is consistent with the numerous situations where Parvati's tapas (intense meditation) is disturbed by Siva, erotically aroused by her beauty.43 There is of course no episode portraying an elephant-headed Parvati in tapas; we can only count on the iconmaker's occasional latitude in the labyrinths of Hindu mythology to improvise and produce an image serving the needs of philosophy as well! We return briefly to the ceremonial worship of Vinayaka, the appellation used in this con- nection in the Agni-Purana for the elephant-headed Ganesa, to consider the possible relationship of Vainayaki as his sakti. Let us recall the exceptional instance in one recension of this Purana20 where the attributes of one of his conceptual saktis, Gauri, are described. Note that these attri- butes are completely at variance with those prescribed for Gauri, one of the forms of Parvati, as the consort of Rudra-Siva.44 Now, the Gaurl of the Agni-Purana lacks an elephant-head but displays in her four hands all the attributes possessed by the Chitrapur Vainayaki, except that instead of the sword, Gaurl is imagined as holding a spear and the hands holding this and the pasa are interchanged. In a final twist of irony the Mantra invoking Gauri, sakti of Ganesa, concludes with a long list of mystic syllables ending with an obeisance to "Gauri, beloved wife of Rudra... Hung, Fut, Obeisance !" 43 O'Flaherty, W.D., Asceticism and Eroticism in the Mythology of Siva, Oxford, 1973 (pp. I5 2-155). 44 Gopinatha Rao, op.cit., Vol. I, pt. 2, p. 360.
