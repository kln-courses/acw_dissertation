Whereas his perforated canvases of the early 1950s had once provoked controversy and outrage, at the 1958 Biennale several critics argued that Fontana's most recent canvases had lost their power to shock. In response, Fontana immediately launched a new series of works titled Concetto spaziale, Attese (Spatial concept: expectations) in which he answered his critics by raising the stakes: his new, monochrome paintings were sliced open in large gashes with a Stanley knife. Over the following ten years up to his death in 1968, Fontana would produce hundreds of these savagely minimal paintings, com- monly known as the Cuts, the works that have brought the artist the most renown. Less well-known is the logic underpinning the artist's shift to the cut canvas, which arose out of a critical response to key developments in postwar art in Italy during the late 1950s. This essay proposes that through his Cuts, Fontana demonstrated that the dominant tendency of contemporary art - toward the glorification of human gesture - amounted to that gesture's eradication. By virtue of this insight, Fontana was able to develop an alternative visual language that memorialized the Utopian origins of modern painting. I. The organizers of the 1958 Venice Biennale dedicated an entire room to Lucio Fontana, with space for forty works spanning his entire career, thereby acknowledging the artist's growing reputation. Fontana had for many years been recognized as a highly accomplished sculptor and ceramicist. However, by the late 1950s he was chiefly renowned for a series of works that, in fidelity to the artist's theory of "Spatial art," questioned the boundary between the art work and the space around it. In 1949 he had produced the Ambiente spaziale OCTOBER 124, Spring 2008, pp. 98-124.

(Spatial environment), an architectural installation of modern lighting technol- ogy in which the space around the sculptural object became part of the art work. Subsequently, Fontana had exhibited a series of monochrome canvases punc- tured with holes, introducing an element of real space into the illusory space of painting. In both the installation and the paintings, he employed materials drawn from the world beyond fine art. In Ambiente spaziale, he employed fluores- cent paint and ultraviolet light; at times he installed colored lights behind his paintings or sprinkled them with glitter. These materials, which enhanced the connection between the work and the space around it through radiating or reflected light, also reminded the contemporary viewer of the worlds of fashion, advertising, and commodity display and served to debunk the seriousness of the conventional art work, bringing it down to earth.1 Throughout the 1950s, the radical nature of Fon tana's work and the sheer unfamiliarity of his techniques had attracted its share of critical invective. At the 1954 Venice Biennale, for example, his punctured paintings were described as 1.

"intellectual masturbations" and "atrocities."2 Although many commentators remained disapproving about his 1958 Biennale exhibition, the tone of the criti- cisms had now changed. Renato Barilli, who acknowledged the importance of Fontana's earlier achievements, was disappointed by the later work: "The last series of works dated 1958 is definitely unsuccessful, impressed with a pictorialism in a surrealist key most unusual for the artist."3 In Fontana's most recent paint- ings, rather than an absolute opposition between monochrome canvas and patterns of holes, several compositional elements competed for the viewer's atten- tion, including pieces of collaged canvas, highly worked surface texture, and fitful drawing. The startling contravention of the medium caused by the punctures in the canvas was lost in an elaborate pictorial schema. By October 1958, Fontana had come up with a new type of painting: the cut canvas. Notably, the first public appearance of these works was on the cover of La Biennale, a periodical published by the Venice Biennale. With an ultramarine blue monochrome canvas opened by several gashes, Fontana threw down the gauntlet in a challenge to the cool reception given him that year at Venice. He abandoned the 2.

Although the Cuts that the artist began in 1958 reprised his earlier punctured paint- ings, in the new series of works Fontana also took account of several recent developments in contemporary art that required him to re-orient, rather than simply re-iterate, his earlier practice. Among these developments were the decadence of European Informel painting, Yves Klein's 1957 exhibition of blue monochrome paintings in Milan, and Jackson Pollock's retrospective in Rome in 1958. Informel painting was ascendant in 1950s Italy. like its French cousins, lyrical abstraction and tachisme, Italian Art Informel was inspired by Surrealism's automatist techniques and emphasis on painting materials.4 As the term "informer suggests, its proponents sought to escape the constraints of traditional artistic form by rejecting rational compositional techniques and emphasizing the process of artistic creation. The transition that many Italian artists went through in this period is exemplified by the work of Mattia Moreni, who shifted from a neo-Cubist shuffling of color planes to full-blown gestural painting during the 1950s. Direct, corporeal interven- tion on the canvas was understood to defeat the alienating condition of modern industrial society by emphasizing the unique individuality of the spontaneous cre- ative gesture.5 As the Italian critic Gillo Dorfles commented in 1959, Informel painting, in spite of being superficially abstract, was in fact a "new figuration" that projected the "inner formative will of man" onto the canvas surface.6 By the late 1950s, however, there were growing signs that the Informel move- ment's opposition to industrialization had been unsuccessful. The critic Edouard Jaguer, in the 1957 issue of the Milanese art journal // Gesto, argued that Art Informel had surpassed neither Surrealism nor pre-war abstraction: Today we are witnessing a reiterated orgy of colored blotches, always more aleatory, as well as an assault of repeatedly identical modes, which are nothing more than "mechanical liberations," the shock value of which is ultimately obscured. The gesture, having lost every quality of direct, emotional testimony, becomes more and more simple reflexes . . . these stains and scribbles have become nothing but formal tics - 7 Jaguer condemned what he saw as the increasingly repetitive character of the Informel movement, which was thereby disconnected from any possibility of 4.

Informel painting's quest for authenticity through a polemi- cal refusal of conscious premeditation had fallen into a mechanical, formulaic art. The destiny of gestural painting was in the machine. In spite of being associated in several critics' eyes with Informel painting, Fontana insisted that his Cut paintings were clearly distinguished from the move- ment that had come to dominate European art in the 1950s. "They put me among the informal painters," Fontana once complained, "but it is a confusion, I am not informal."8 From the time of his earliest punctured paintings in the early 1950s, the machine-gun appearance of Fontana's individual marks had refused the sub- tle differentiations in handling made possible by the paintbrush, distancing his work from that of the gestural painters. The same holds for the Cuts: in opposi- tion to the virtuoso performance of self-expression, any sign of inspired creation is extremely attenuated by Fontana's allover layer of monochrome paint, which betrays almost no trace of painterly application. Whereas Italian Informel painters such as Moreni emphasized the casual effects created by organic elements of the painting process in the belief that this would allow a more authentic self to emerge, in Fontana's Cuts the unyielding, metallic edge of the Stanley knife blade neatly split the canvas fabric with an action similar to a device such as a guillotine, inhibiting the complex inflections of traditional painterly technique. Although retaining the outward form of the gesture, the artist reduced it to a mechanical operation, undermining the cult of individuality in painting and allowing machine-like attributes to infiltrate gesture painting's rhetoric. In so doing, Fontana proposed that such art, far from being in opposition to industrial society, was mechanical in its very essence. Fontana was not the only contemporary artist in Europe questioning the indulgent expressionism of Informel painting. In January 1957, the French artist Yves Klein exhibited eleven monochrome blue paintings, of identical dimensions and format, at the Apollinaire gallery in Milan. Fontana, who purchased one of these unusual works at the exhibition and met the artist there, would remain in friendly contact with Klein in the years to come. As Fontana recounted in a 1968 interview, whenever the two artists met, Klein would show a certain deference to the older artist: "[Klein] was very generous, very respectful also for my age. Each time that I went to Paris, he waited for me at the station."9 Given Fontana's sup- port for Klein's work, and that Fontana's first published Cut painting was a blue monochrome, it appears that the respect was mutual. Fontana's new series of paintings beginning in 1958 were certainly in dialogue with the younger artist's 8. Fontana, quoted in M. Valsecchi, "L'uomo ora e nello spazio e l'arte viaggia con lui," Tempo (Milan) May 9, 1964. 9. Lucio Fontana, "Fontana," interview, Art et creation 1 (1968), p. 78. Dino Buzzatti's review of Klein's Milan exhibition, "Blu, Blu, Blu," Corriere d'Informazione (Milan), January 9-10, 1957, records Fontana's purchase of a Klein monochrome at 25,000 Italian lira.

This dialogue was grounded in the fact that Fontana would have noticed several similarities between Klein's work and his own canvases of the early 1950s. Klein had rejected several elements of contemporary gestural painting. Through his use of highly saturated blue pigment applied to the surface of the can- vas in an even, allover technique, Klein unified the picture surface. In so doing, he eliminated the distinction between figure and ground upon which Informel paint- ing depended to make physical artistic gesture appear. Moreover, the paint surfaces of Klein's blue monochromes were applied with paint rollers, thereby avoiding painterly gesture and detaching his painting from the psychic and corporeal authenticity of Informel painting. By completely removing composition and almost all evidence of manual intervention, Klein had gone much further than Fontana's own monochrome pictures of the early 1950s. Another important element of Klein's work would have greatly interested Fontana. Although the highly saturated</page><page sequence="9">106 OCTOBER blue color defies perceptual definition and encourages the sensation of deep space, the allover composition, rounded corners, and extension of color onto the sides of the panels were all factors that asserted the physical presence of the paint- ing as an object. As Nan Rosenthal has observed, this creates the impression, however momentary, that the boundary between the virtual world of pictorial space and the actual world in which the viewer moves has been transgressed. In these works, therefore, Fontana would have seen a compelling depiction of the unity of aesthetic and real space, an idea that had obsessed the artist since the late 1940s. A further reason that Fontana took an interest in Klein is the irreverent sense of inauthenticity the latter's work creates.10 The intense hue of artificial ultra- marine blue that Klein preferred belonged to a new spectrum of synthetic colors employed by the fashion and design industries in the 1950s. It impregnated his art with a commodity character in a similar fashion to Fontana's earlier use of ultravio- let lignt, glitter, and fluorescent paint. Given that in all these respects, Klein had equaled or out- done Fontana's mono- chromes of the 1950s, it is understandable that Fontana would have taken* great interest in the French artist's work and sought to respond to it in his own practice. However, there was one direction in which Klein had gone much fur- ther than Fontana, and where the latter refused to follow: the elaborate apparatus of chicanery Fontana.

These included the 1954 Yves Peintures, a book of repro- ductions of nonexistent monochrome paintings; patenting his ultramarine blue pigment "1KB" (International Klein Blue); declaring that the varying prices assigned to his virtually equivalent blue monochromes reflected profound differences in quality between them; Le Vide (1958), an empty gallery space lavishly supplemented by the overt trappings of art promotion and advertising; and an increasing emphasis on the artist's public performance in the personae of judo master, medieval knight, 10.

The significance of this aspect of Klein's work has been the subject of debate. Benjamin Buchloh has described it as an aesthetic of "total spectacularization," which relegated preexisting paradigms of modernist criticality to the status of pure commodity; Yve-Alain Bois, who argues that Klein's deliberate frauds were an attack on the pompous mythologies underpinning French Informel painting, reads it as demonstrating that "only the spectacularization of myth and spectacle can contain a parcel of truth: as their indictment."11 Although Fontana never commented on this element of Klein's work, it is safe to assume that his read- ing was close to that of Bois: after all, Fontana's own canvases covered with fake metallic paint, glitter, and Murano glass chips positively reek of falsity and outra- geously trash the high seriousness of Informel painting. Nevertheless, the evidence of the Cut paintings demonstrates that the older artist had no interest in evacuating gesture from art and transplanting it to the supplementary realm of the work. On the contrary, for Fontana, artistic gesture - gesture in the traditional, physical sense, and not Klein's more modern, theatrical one - remained indis- pensable. When Fontana faked his cutting technique for the photographer Ugo Mulas, this was no deliberate staging of fraudulence; he simply avoided exposing his actual working process to the camera.12 In spite of frequent remarks about art as "concept," or "idea," Fontana remained resolutely an art maker, and preserved an artisanal element in his practice, which can be traced back to his early training in Milan's Fine Art Academy and his father's commercial sculpture studio in Argentina.13 As Giulio Carlo Argan has argued, in an astute summary of the artist's postwar practice, Fontana "was the defender of the concept of art as cre- ation and even as beauty" who "demonstrated the limits to which those concepts had to be reduced in order to coexist with the new value concepts introduced by industrial culture."14 In 1958, there were several further moves in this strategy of defense and reduction that the artist wanted to play out. Fontana's response to Klein, therefore, was ambivalent. He was certainly emboldened by the younger artist's work to return to the allover, monochrome surfaces of his early punctured paintings. He intensified them with a broad spectrum of novel, water-based pigments - such as the burnt pastel orange of the work catalogued as 59 T 134 - which were extremely difficult to categorize within the existing natural referents for color and made direct reference to the 11.

Even Fontana's Cuts were to some degree motivated by Klein's example. By collapsing the idea of painting as window with that of painting as object, the French artist had shown one way of integrating physical and virtual space in painting: by simultaneously negating and preserving illusion. Similarly, in his Cuts, Fontana drew attention to the materiality of the canvas by cutting into it while retaining the impression of pictorial depth: the monochrome surface invited the viewer to read the cut, paradoxically, as figure on ground. In this way, Fontana created a form within painting that consists of real space.15 At the same time, by slicing the canvas, Fontana strongly resisted Klein's evacuation of the gesture. Instead of revealing the vacuousness of the Informel paradigm by negating painterly gesture and transferring it to the supplemental realm of documents, advertising, and public performance, he highlighted the sin- gular quality of the artist's intervention in the canvas, reviving an element of the corporeal engagement, however attenuated, that Klein's monochromes had sud- denly rendered outmoded. Fontana evoked the figurative modality of the expressive painterly stroke - its elongated, tapering form and its slight curve. In this way, he gave notice that, in spite of the painterly gesture's mechanization at the hands of Informel painting, the solution was not to eradicate physical human gesture by fiat. Maintaining a tension between the gesture's bodily immediacy and the seeming inevitability of its disappearance, Fontana kept the artist's corporeal intervention on center stage. The precise role such intervention would ultimately come to play in his work was something Fontana discovered after visiting Jackson Pollock's 1958 retrospective at the National Gallery of Modern Art in Rome. In a series of interviews in the 1960s, Fontana made several critical remarks about Jackson Pollock. Describing him as a "post-Impressionist" who had tried but failed to "go beyond the canvas," Fontana argued that Pollock was an artist whose prices were artificially inflated by American advertising strategies.16 By the late 1960s, Pollock's reputation was growing astronomically and Fontana had reason to be envi- ous and dismissive. Ten years earlier, however, Fontana had almost certainly visited the 1958 retrospective of the American artist's work in Rome and taken heed of his example.17 Although there is no recorded verbal or written impression of Fontana's reaction to the Pollock exhibition, the evidence of Fontana's subsequent work demonstrates that the impression was a powerful one. As I will outline, this impres- sion, which was highly relevant to the problem posed by the decadence of Informel painting and Klein's monochromes, was crucial to the genesis of the first Cuts. 15. Fontana also drew attention to the canvas by using water-based paints, which, applied directly to untreated canvas, would allow the fabric texture to remain visible.

Fontana had three separate exhibitions of his own work opening in Rome during 1958, includ- ing one at Rome's National Gallery of Modern Art.</page><page sequence="12">Industrial Painting's Utopias 109 One lesson in the Pollock retrospective for Fontana was the indexical char- acter of the American artist's drip technique.18 As has often been remarked, Pollock's dripping technique evinces an indexical deposit or trace, leaving a clue to the author's presence as at the scene of a crime. However, when the painterly or gestural mark is read as a sign of the author in this way, as Rosalind Krauss has argued, that author is figured as radically absent. Maintaining that Pollock's drip was an indexical debasement of form, Krauss turns to discuss the work of Cy Twombly in terms of the graffito. The mark of the graffitist, she argues, has a peculiar character in that it marks an event by "cutting the event off from the tem- porality of its own making."19 Vandalistic or graffiti marks, registering a subject that can only be spoken in the language of the past, divide the mythical presence of the autographic gesture with an irreconcilable split. Similar to Twombly, in his Cuts Fontana attacked the fiction that the painterly mark embodies the author's presence. The vandalistic trace of Fontana's gesture, while avoiding the annihila- tion of gesture in Klein's monochrome, instantiates a presence under erasure. Indeed, the voids of the cut canvas are the markers of a presence that has taken stock of its prior exclusion and internalized it. Denying the mythological identity between maker and mark, Fontana's indexical cuts homeopathically inject a sense of the gesture's deadening. The most startling revelations for Fontana about the Pollock retrospective, however, would have been Out of the Web. This 1949 work is a relatively large paint- ing covered by the American artist's dripping technique, from which large areas of canvas have been sliced away with a knife, revealing the Masonite support. While these excised areas were not strictly "holes" in the sense that the punctures in Fontana's earlier pictures were, Pollock's lacunae were comparable to those in Fontana's work: both physically disrupted the canvas. In reviewing the Rome exhi- bition, a writer for the Socialist newspaper Avanti! - who described Pollock as "The Presley of Painting"- argued that, "In Out of the Web . . . [Pollock] cuts out the crust of color to reveal the Masonite underneath, as if in an impotent need to grasp a more profound reality beneath the woven texture of color in which his obsessive temperament gets entangled."20 Pollock was by no means attempting to grasp "reality" in the sense meant by this Italian left-wing critic, for whom the term would have inevitably implied neo-realism. Nevertheless, Pollock's Out of the Web showed a way of both having the figure and negating it too, of retaining the inevitably figurative character of gesture while demonstrating the necessity for its interrogation. Pollock helped Fontana find an artistic language through which he could respond to Informel 18. In semiological terms, indexical marks, such as the footprint, depend upon a "real, existential contiguity" between sign and object.

There was a prevalent sense in Italy during the 1950s that the figurative lan- guage of form inherited from modernist painting had become trite. "The bourgeoisie goes for charm to Paul Klee, for geniality to Picasso," observed Piero Dorazio in 1956. Dorazio also noted that the curvaceous and attenuated forms of canonical modernism had been warmly welcomed into the living rooms of the middle class through furniture design: The practicability (not to mention the simple aspect of the newest industrial shapes) of lively colors and elegant contours have won the Italian consumer completely. In these few years they would seem already to have supplanted old tastes and the demand for traditional handicraft forms . . . [and] modern shapes in useful objects and in architecture have conquered our reactionary public.21 This idiom, which by the late 1950s was looking shop-soiled, was precisely that deployed in the excised forms in Out of the Web. As T. J. Clark has argued, these forms are best described as a "glib, biomorphic comedy," just as the whimsical, Klee-like quality of the related Cut Out series is "indistinguishable from a type of 21.

This aspect of Pollock's work was the most important lesson for Fontana from the Rome exhibition; and it is from here, parting company with Twombly, that he took off in his Cuts. II. Where Twombly had burrowed into the subcultural characteristic of the graf- fito to objectify the mark and thereby fissure the image from below culture, Fontana shows the gesture in the process of reification through culture as style. At the very same moment in which his paintings were first used as backdrops in fashion shoots for Elle magazine, Fontana adopted the position that no gesture is completely immune to the kinds of reification introduced by the art market.23 Further empty- ing out the gesture by overtly stylizing it as an elegant, aerodynamic form, he 22.

Artists and critics in 1950s Italy not only felt that Informel painting was grow- ing more and more mechanical, they felt that like the modernist idiom it sought to replace, it too was turning into a commodity. The artists of the Milanese Arte Nucleare movement, in their manifesto, "Against Style," of 1957, directly addressed these problems. This text, signed by Enrico Baj, Yves Klein, and Piero Manzoni, among others, drew attention to the fact that the newest painting tech- niques were rapidly commercialized: We have used every technical resource - from tachiste or objective automatism to that of the subjective kind, to graphism, Action Painting, gesture, calligraphy, emulsions, flottages, and polymaterial- ism But every invention now risks becoming the object of stereotypi- cal repetitions of a purely mercantile character, which is why we must begin a vigorous antistylistic action. . . . Wallpaperers or painters: we must choose which to be.24 Similarly, in 1958, in the pages of the Milan review Direzioni, Edouard Jaguer con- demned Informel painting's "sacrosanct monotony of smears by the kilometer" as the sign of a world that "confuses revolution with fashion."25 This tendency of Informel gesture toward an enervating mass production was connected by critics to a flight into the frivolously decorative. This concern was voiced in a 1959 review of Roberto Crippa's painting, where the critic hilari- ously condemned that artist's decadence: Crippa works for the lovers of the superficial in his painting boutique, where every type of fashion accessory is on show: the dripping tech- nique of Pollock, feminized and reduced to pure calligraphy; the signs of Sugai, cut away from their meaning; the incision-like mode of Hartung, deprived of its urgency. Everything becomes so gracious! . . . This incapacity to resist the temptation of arbitrary embellishments has ruined many Italian artists . . . For them, beauty is something that is measured off by the meter and applied, from a Capri sunset to the fig- ure of Sophia Loren.26 The erstwhile Nucleare artist Piero Manzoni would react to this situation by follow- ing Klein's lead in radically denying painterly gesture. In his 1959 Achromes, monochrome paintings assembled out of grids of gesso-soaked canvas squares, 24.

Fon tana's response to the problem of style, unlike Klein's and Manzoni's, was to accept it as a given and aggressively incorporate it into his own work. This is evident in the overt stylization of Fontana's lacerations of the canvas visible in an example from 1959. The organically shaped curves sliced into the sur- face certainly have the potential to manifest the living presence of the author's body. The slightly angled, tapering forms, which progressively open as the eye fol- lows each slash through its trajectory and then close again before trailing off into the monochrome canvas, evoke the downward stroke emanating from the physical body of the author. An example from 1962, where the marks are more curvaceous, shows how Fontana's slashes refer to the handedness of the painter. The natural, ergonomic movement of drawing the right hand in toward the body is signified by the forms that gently slope as they descend the canvas. Furthermore, the bulges that have been formed in the canvas on either side of each cut evince the sympathetic response of the material to the slicing action, as the picture surface appears to have pulled back from the site of the rupture in a manner similar to what one would expect from a fleshy membrane. In a formal sense, too, they bear comparison with the work of those European gestural painters, such as Hans Hartung, whose work purported to record the physical trace of the author's intervention on the canvas. However, Fontana's slashes have none of the rugged appearance of randomness or spontaneity seen in the work of Informel painters; indeed, in spite of all these overt references to the body, in Fontana's hands the painterly mark is a crisp, stylized sign of the organic that patently fails in its claim to signify the body or the psyche. The mark is fissured from within due to its identity as trace or index, and it is addressed outwards to the idea of style, a form of spectacular alienation. These curves, which have a lifeless quality comparable to the cutout frozen smiles attached to the faces of Willem de Kooning's women, remain disconnected from the intentional matrix by reifying the body's trace as a commodity. This aspect of Fontana's Cuts parallels contemporary developments in indus- trial design. In an effort to make household products more attractive to the potential buyer, the industrial designer of the 1950s was no longer concerned with the rational organization of the object's function but rather with stylish appearance. As Penny Sparke has documented, in the early 1950s Italian products began to demonstrate "a new expressiveness, a sensuousness and an individualism" that drew on the organic, abstract sculpture of artists such as Henry Moore and Alexander Calder.27 However, this sensuousness was fatally connected to commodity fetishism. As Sparke recounts, product design was moving away from satisfying practical needs and focused on "sta- tus symbolism and stylishness." Designers who borrowed from the modernist 27.

Rather, they turned such items into swank objets de luxevnth an added aes- thetic value gleaned from the world of high art.28 Similarly, Jean Baudrillard connected the fanciful biomorphism of house- hold objects in the 1950s to an increasing enervation of human gesture. By the term "gesture," Baudrillard largely refers to the manual operations performed by the user of appliances and implements in everyday life. An older pattern of ges- tures requiring muscular effort involved the person in a rich symbolic order connected to the integration of physical labor and objects in the world. The new system that he saw dawning, and which he described as the age of "buttons, levers, handles, [and] pedals," had been hilariously parodied in Jacques Tati's 1958 film Mon Oncle, where encounters with automated household appliances and form- fitting furniture reduce the protagonists' actions to slapstick dysfunctionality.29 As Kristin Ross comments, Tati's films "make palpable a daily life that increasingly appeared to unfold in a space where objects tended to dictate to people their ges- ture and movements," bringing about a "burlesque malleability" in the individuals supposedly empowered by new consumer goods.30 For Baudrillard, this system had a darker side, in that the physical effort and involvement of the physical body in the human relationship to objects had now been almost completely elided. Speaking of the "contoured" and "dynamic" character of contemporary designed functional objects, Baudrillard argues that the "stylizatiort" of such forms cannot be disentangled from the styliza- tion of the human gestural systems which correspond to them. The style of such gestural systems always implies the suppression of muscu- lar energy, of labor . . . this is the turning point at which a status enjoyed by objects for millennia, their anthropomorphic status, is definitively terminated 31 Referring to what he calls the new "abstractness of human praxis," Baudrillard argues that whatever physical involvement there is in the relationship to these new objects is mostly a matter of an abstract psychological or connotative connection, a signification of human gesture that is merely decorative in the sense of being unnec- essary to their functioning: "Today the human body would seem to be present only as the abstract justification for the finished form of the functional object."32 In the contoured form of the modernist designed object, a contouring ripe with allusions to the organic body, Baudrillard sees the extreme attenuation and even disconnec- tion of the object from any properly physical link to the human organism. 28.

Fontana's response to this condition of painting was to memorialize the idea of muscular energy and psychic outpouring in the slash's violation of the canvas. At the same time he deliberately flaunted the ges- ture's enervation through industrial design's new order of styling, in which the human body is compelled to conform to the rapid rhythm of the commodity's fash- ion cycle. By giving the trace a very specific form, converting it into an image, and repeating it across individual canvases and across an entire oeuvre, Fontana warned that the gestural mark is highly susceptible to reification. As one critic noted in 1962, while there was an "element of naked sensuality in all this ... his international success is not entirely to be trusted. These canvases fit too readily with chi-chi mod- ern decor."33 The agent of that reification was the flagrant stylization of the cut, its closeness to the artificial elegance of art nouveau and the aerodynamic form of con- temporary automobile tailfins, its conversion of an ostensibly organic swoop into a frozen image of natural gesture. The highly attenuated crescent forms in a work from 1963-64, wherein the slashes are particularly narrow and long, possess a uncanny elegance that alludes to bodily movement while deflecting it at the same time. Desiccated by the rapid consumption of artistic languages, human physical gesture is exhumed by Fontana like a corpse and paraded in its ghastly emptiness. The body returns in the form of a grinning death's head, a ghastly peeling back of the pictorial flesh, like the anamorphic skull haunting the rich, veridical portrayal of status in Hans Holbein's The Ambassadors (1533).34 He evoked the form of the expressive painterly stroke only to empty that gesture of its content, to make it the bearer of absence. By asserting the gesture in a manner that underlined the invalid- ity of the genius creator, however, Fontana also recalled what the Utopian function of art could be. Insisting on the decrepitude of the artist's painterly mark, he gave rise to an alternative that pointed to a dream of art released from the death sen- tence of artistic genius. The mechanical repetition of Fontana's gesture, which robs the art work of its semantic depth and authenticity, can be aligned with the work of the unskilled and anonymous operator of machinery. As Antonella Negri has argued, the slashes do not embody the manual effort and know-how of traditional craft skills; rather "they appear to be able to be executed in little time and by everybody."35 The Stanley knife, after all, is a mechanical implement normally employed in the relatively mun- dane task of preparing lengths of canvas for stretching.36 Combined with their evocation of the marginalized but righteous gestures of the iconoclast, Fontana's Cuts exploit the critical potential of a brutal vernacular, associating the artist with the ranks of disenfranchised people to whom art's privileges are normally denied. 33.

The draining of deep, psychic content from these works means that their creation is potentially the property of all people and not only that of a unique and supernatu- rally gifted creator. In their mechanical emphasis they bear comparison with the screen-printing technique used in the 1960s by Andy Warhol, who, when asked to explain why his studio was called a "factory," argued that "This is where I make or build my work Mechanical means are today, and using them I can get more art to more people. Art should be for everyone."37 However, Warhol's rhetoric was matched by works in which, to paraphrase Benjamin Buchloh once again, the eman- cipatory potential of desublimatory artistic techniques was reduced to the condition of travesty through a process of trivialization.38 Fontana's work, by contrast, retained a more profoundly Utopian element. This element can be highlighted through a comparison not with Warhol but with the work of Pinot Gallizio, a friend of Fontana and to whom one of the earliest Cuts is dedicated.39 During 1958, Gallizio mounted exhibitions of Industrial Painting in Turin and Milan. This unusual body of work grew out of the collaborative discussions produced in the context of Asger Jorn's Movimento Internazionale per un Bauhaus Immaginista, an early manifestation of the Situationist International that was briefly associated with the Nucleare artists from Milan. Gallizio produced rolls of canvas up to seventy meters long, covered in abstract blotches and stains applied through various processes involving resins and spraying techniques. The rolls were presented unwound in exhibition, and the artist cut off lengths of painting with a large pair of scissors for the waiting clientele, as one might sell a length of cloth at 37.

A yardstick was even provided at the exhibition, making the point that painting was being sold by the meter. Mirella Bandini's lucid commen- tary on this work neatly sums up the Utopian purpose behind the antics of Gallizio's exhibitions: No longer paintings of centimeters, framed, under glass, preciously exhibited and collected . . . but meters, tens of meters, kilometers of painting for everyone, to cut in pieces, to wrap up, to make sofas, car- pets, clothing, to decorate tables and environments; to be used, con- sumed, lived and therefore destroyed in collective behavior . . . "Industrial Painting," an artistic product banalized and devalorized that everyone can acquire for subjective and imaginative use.40 Gallizio mimicked the techniques of industry in order to produce large quantities of painting. Exploiting the increasingly mechanical nature of Informel gesture, Gallizio undermined the artist's importance, devaluing traditional painting's semantic depth. Gallizio's scissoring of the painting into separate elements for dis- tribution at rock-bottom prices is especially significant. By being cut into fragments at the request of the buyer, aesthetic largesse is converted into consumable pieces of fabric for individual use.41 In this way the broader public could obtain the eco- nomically inaccessible, high-cultural monument of Informel painting. Fontana's Cuts evince a similar devalorization of painting in several respects: through pigments drawn from the realm of fashion and design, through their vio- lation of the pristine canvas surface - in many ways comparable to Gallizio's painting "cut by the meter" - and in their repetitious production. Although the number of Cut paintings reaches as high as 160 per year, compared with a maxi- mum of 30 or 40 in previous years, there is no evidence that Fontana deliberately increased his output to deflate the price of his work, and the price of his work today (like that of Gallizio for that matter) is well beyond the reach of the average person. Nevertheless, by calibrating his physical gestures to the rhythm of indus- try, and significantly expanding his output, Fontana, like Gallizio, eroded the distinction between the unique artisanal artifact and the output of mass produc- tion. By producing dozens of substantially similar works, he demonstrated the serial nature of his oeuvre, disconnecting it from the deep subjectivity normally suggested by the painterly mark. This abdication of singularity through mechani- cal repetition is a Utopian element in his work. With their large production runs and garish industrial colors that strip painting of its aura of uniqueness, Fontana's Cuts - which have become his most popular works - show how painting might compete with the wide dissemination of the industrially designed object. Now, in spite of this mass-produced quality, there is artistry in these works. However, it is best described by the somewhat degraded term artiste that refers to 40.

The deftness of Fontana's slashes has all the physical dexterity of the circus acrobat, combined with the appearance of effortlessness essential to all public demonstrations of gymnastic agility. Connecting his operation in this way to the skills possessed by performers in proletarian spectacle, Fontana associates his mechanical art with the joyous and liberated bodily intensity celebrated in the graceful arc of the trapeze artist and the rhythmic patterns of music-hall dancers. Thus a comparison with the French post-Impressionist painter of acrobats and circuses, Georges Seurat, can be fruitful. This is especially the case given that Fontana's work demonstrates a similar rejection of traditional facture to that wit- nessed in Seurat 's pointillist technique. As Felix Feneon noted in 1886, His immense canvas, La Grande Jatte, whatever part of it you examine, unrolls, a monotonous and patient tapestry: Here in truth the acci- dents of the brush are futile, trickery is impossible; there is no place for bravura Whether it be on an ostrich plume, a bunch of straw, a wave, or a rock, the handling of the brush remains the same.42 Fontana's monochrome paintings, with their uniform series of slashes, exhibit a similar standardization of touch. We can imagine the creator of such paintings asking, like Seurat did, to be paid by the day, similar to an industrial laborer.43 However, the comparison becomes even more pertinent when we examine Seurat's Chahut of 1890, to which Fontana's Cut canvases bear more than morpholog- ical similarities. This late work by the post-Impressionist has been interpreted as expressing the debasement wrought on popular entertainment by the onset of indus- trialization. In an insightful analysis, Jean-Claude Lebensztejn argues that the painting records how a once scandalously erotic dance akin to the cancan had been reduced to a lifeless commodity: Seurat painted the functionaries of dance, anonymous beings with forced smiles, in regulated steps, who are paid by the night to satisfy the bour- geoisie who come to get an eyeful ... it represents a modern Montmartre, imbued with touristic exploitation, and an era when the pure expendi- ture of the festival has been fixed in its mercantile simulacrum.44 Lebensztejn maintains that the painting's mechanization of joy extends so far as to invade and annul any spontaneous pleasure viewers might take in the experi- ence of the painting.45 However, there is another side to this work that can be teased out by considering the argument of Max Horkheimer and Theodor 42.

They gave an inkling of what the body would look like if the demands for individual gratification nor- mally promised by idealist, autonomous art were fully integrated into the life-world on the basis of "a real transformation of the material conditions of exis- tence, for a new life, for a new form of labor and of enjoyment."48 Rather than seeing works such as Seurat's and Fontana's as the repressive industrialization of pleasure, we can read them as providing a space in which mechanized and serial production is shown to be compatible with a joyous over- coming of the monotony and exhaustion produced by the brutal conditions of industrial labor. The gravity-defying aerodynamism that Fontana's Cuts evoke is one of the most persistent themes of postwar culture, evident in the countless streamlined tailfins encountered in a wide variety of designed objects in this period. When Reyner Banham argued that such designs "link the dreams that money can buy to the ultimate dreams of popular culture," he strictly limited the range of those dreams to the "world of sports-cars and aerodynamic research."49 However, more profound desires could be embodied in such forms. Hans Magnus Enzensberger, noting that private car ownership and tourism both exploit and answer mass needs for "nonmaterial variety and mobility," argues that the spectac- ular consumer festival of goods, shop windows, and traffic presented by commodity culture should not be dismissed as merely false consciousness. Rather it can be understood as based in desires that have a physiological basis, and as "containing the promise that want will disappear."50 This is how the apparent effortlessness of Fontana's Cuts can be compared to the streamlined design of contemporary consumer goods: although they remain within the space of illusion and even compensate for needs that hitherto have remained unsatisfied, they embody a genuine desire for overcoming the drudgery and grind of industrialized labor. The Cuts propose a Utopian moment of uplifted grace that nevertheless remains entirely contained within the materiality of muscular energy.

The material interruptions of the ideal surface should cancel the paint- ing's capacity for illusion. The shadows and highlights that sometimes form on either side of the cut - an effect that depends entirely on the lighting condi- tions - should insist on the stubborn materiality of the canvas fabric. Nevertheless, as several commentators have observed, there is a strong compul- sion to read that material as empty space, and the apertures cut into it as figures.51 This double character of the artist's painting is no accidental effect but is central to the significance of his work. Since 1949, the date of his Ambiente spaziale, a walk-in art work employing modern lighting technology, Fontana had struggled against the positivity of the art object. In a 1954 interview, he argued that "Sculpture and painting are both things of the past. . . . We need a new form. Art that's movement. Art within space."52 For him, breaking down form and integrating it with space was the proper destiny of the art work, an ambition he inherited from the avant-garde wish to integrate the art object with the space of real life. However, faced with the difficulties of achieving this integration through the medium of environmental installation, during the 1950s he unexpectedly turned to painting, for the first time in his career, as an alternative means to pursue that goal. In the contempo- rary climate of Informel painting, the mark of the gestural artist had become the new form, the positivity against which a new campaign of negation would have to be waged. By reducing his painterly intervention to a mechanical and stylized trav- esty of itself, Fontana leaves us with a lifeless emblem of the gesture, hollowed out, full of nothing. The intrusion of the mechanical negates the imperious interven- tion of the authorial subject, opening the painting onto an empty space. In this way he brought nothingness onto center stage. But what was the significance of this nothingness? Consider the analogy between Fontana's Cuts and modern technologies of photography and film. Although the comparison may seem surprising, there are several reasons to draw it. Fontana's Cuts share with the photograph an indexical character, in that both are to some extent causally linked to their object as trace. Significantly, Fontana wrote enthusiastically of the photogram - a shadow-like photograph created by placing objects between light-sensitive paper and a light source - in the very same year that his hole paintings were first exhibited.53 The case for comparing Fontana's work to photographic techniques becomes even more persuasive when we consider his projected light installations of the early 1950s. In these works, a punctured painting was shown propped on a stool with a light placed directly 51. As Gillo Dorfles once observed, the aperture in the canvas "allows the void behind the canvas to project in front of its surface."

Several luminous images of the electric lamp's glowing filament, focused by an array of holes in the canvas that worked as pinhole lenses, were pro- jected onto a darkened wall as in a camera obscura. In this work the canvas became part of a photographic device for producing lighting effects in architec- ture, thereby directly linking his punctured paintings with the Ambiente spaziale. More importantly for the present argument, when Fontana first published a pho- tograph of this work in the Italian architectural magazine Spazio in 1952 - under the title "Immagini luminose in movimento" (Luminous images in movement) - he presented it as the prototype for a television broadcast. Luigi Moretti wrote in the article to accompany Fontana's images, "All the arts that live in space can find in television the language and arguments appropriate and comprehensible to the broadest strata of culture."54 This was the first year of regular television program- ming in Italy, many years before viewers in that country had the opportunity to appreciate where television was actually heading, and over two decades prior to Pier Paolo Pasolini's condemnation of it as "the most authoritarian and repressive communication medium in the world."55 In 1952, it was still possible to imagine in Italy that television, a technology largely dependent upon the media of photogra- phy and film, could have genuine democratizing power. For early photography theorists such as Walter Benjamin and Siegfried Kracauer, it was the photograph's indexical nature that had liberating potential. As Miriam Hansen argues, Kracauer viewed the photograph as an "arbitrary moment of exposure, the moment of chance that might capture an aspect of nature at once alienated and released from the tyranny of human intention."56 It was this anonymous, mechanical arbitrariness that for Benjamin allowed the indexical trace of the photograph, through shock, to reveal a hidden, historical side to objects, freed from the nightmare of a present fully mediated by the com- modity, and redolent with the memory of repressed Utopian dreams. When he turns to discuss the radical potential of film in his 1936 essay "The Work of Art in the Age of Its Technological Reproducibility," Benjamin extends this argument. In one section of the essay he contrasts the painter and the cinematographer by way of an analogy with the comparison between a magi- cian and a surgeon. Whereas the magician - who heals by a laying on of hands - keeps himself remote from the sick person by confronting him "person to person" and assuming great authority, the surgeon, avoiding this personal approach, physically penetrates the body to perform an operation, thereby greatly increasing his or her proximity. Equally, argues Benjamin, whereas the painter remains removed from his subject, creating a complete image of reality, the cinematographer penetrates into reality, breaking it apart and reassembling 54.

Instead of remaining distant, Fontana literally breaks into the canvas with his cutting operation; and although the canvas is not literally dismembered and put back together in the manner of film editing, the finished work is no organic vision of wholeness. Rather, by colliding the perception of a hole in a surface with a vision of figure on ground, Fontana requires the spectator to reconstitute radically differing, incommensurable elements in the process of viewing. In the aforementioned essay, Benjamin continues his discussion of film by comparing the live theater to the film studio. Both mediums offer an illusion of reality; however at the theater there is a place where a hypothetical audience member could sit without being fully aware of the mechanics of that illusion. In the film studio, by contrast, there is no such position, except that occupied already by the camera lens itself. As a result, even though film's illusion of the real offers a vision of the world that appears to be completely unmediated by equip- ment, because that illusion is the result not of the removal of apparatus but rather the complete integration of lens, camera mechanism, and the cutting process of editing into that vision, it is utterly artificial. From this he concludes the following: The presentation of reality in film is incomparably the more signifi- cant for people of today, since it provides the equipment-free aspect of reality they are entitled to demand from a work of art, and does so precisely on the basis of the most intensive interpenetration of reality with equipment. For this reason, Benjamin dubs filmic illusion "the Blue Flower in the land of tech- nology."58 In this peculiar phrase, the legendary blaue Blume, the unreachable object of desire immortalized by the German Romantic poet Novalis, is realized in the grip of a completely mechanical medium. Benjamin's paradoxical formulation, which locates Utopian desire in techno- logically advanced forms of cultural reproduction^ needs to be understood as part of the critic's broader project during the 1930s. Benjamin knew full well that film was being exploited by capitalism to reinforce its hold over society. He also claimed that certain technical aspects of film, such as the camera's presence and the editing process, were features promoting an active, skeptical type of viewing that corre- sponded to changes in human perception experienced "by each fighter against the present world order."59 Underpinning Benjamin's account was his conviction that film was the revolutionary art form of the proletarian masses par excellence: in cin- ema the members of the collective would be capable of "understanding themselves 57.

Although the artist's paintings of the 1960s increasingly took on the look of mass-produced objects, Fontana did not set great store in the literal fact of art's mechanical repro- duction. As he remarked in 1967, "Reproducing the art work in thousands of copies ... to print a drawing a thousand times, what does that mean? Fatigue, and the wish to impose on the public a thing that they don't want to accept."61 For this reason it is important to carefully distinguish his thinking from the revolutionary tenor of Benjamin's writing on technological reproducibility. In spite of this differ- ence, I argue that Fontana's Cut paintings can be compared to Benjamin's concept of cinema as much as a highly mechanized, commercialized art form could be described as resurrecting distant memories of Utopian wish fulfillment. As Hansen notes in her brilliant analysis of the German critic's thinking on cin- ema and experience, in his writing Benjamin sought to simultaneously "destroy the fetishistic illusion while preserving the promise of happiness it allowed to sus- tain."62 By insisting equally on the liquidation of illusion and its preservation, through memory, as the key to an alternative future, Benjamin provided a termi- nology for understanding the doubleness within Fontana's painting. Fontana's mechanically executed, indexical cut opens the canvas onto a repressed memory, the dream that the art of painting would provide not just a window to look through as in a daydream, but a passage to a beyond where the objectification and commodification of the art work never existed. In a 1968 inter- view, Fontana proposed the advent of a new art along these lines: "Not an object, nor a form Nothing more to do with bourgeois consumption, beauty attached to a sellable object."63 In pursuit of this goal, the open canvases, particularly those examples with a single, vertical slash, promise the ecstatic fulfillment of the art work's integration with real space. At the same time, by producing paintings in which negative and positive space turn endless somersaults, and thereby prohibit- ing a coherent position from which to view his work, Fontana allegorizes painting's capacity to suggest a beyond. A deep incoherence is lodged at the heart of this Utopian vision by Fontana's cutting operation, or what we might call, fol- lowing Benjamin, its "intensive interpenetration of reality with equipment," which throws the constructedness of the illusion into high relief. In this way, resurrecting the outmoded notion of painting as granting access to nature, being, or the divine, he retrieves painting's dream of a better world, while simultaneously can- celing that dream's tendency to sublimate the art object's concrete existence. To believe in the arrival at space that these canvases promise would be to engage in the ersatz reconciliation of subject and object essential to all kitsch. 60. Ibid., p. 115. 61.
