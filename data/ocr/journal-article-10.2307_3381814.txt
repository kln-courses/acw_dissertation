<plain_text><page sequence="1">REASONING IN ISLAMIC LAW: PART ONE* Mohamed Abdel-Khalek Omar INTRODUCTION lwhe main purpose of this ariicle is to offer a detailed and clear analysis of the different aspects of the process of reasoning to form legal and judicial opinions and rulings according to the principles and rules of Islamic Law (SharlNah). The core of IslaIIiic legal science (jurisprudence: fiqh) consists of legal opinions which are supported by one or more of the primary or subsidiary sources (masadir) or proofs (adillah) of the Sharlsah. There is almost unanimous agreement among the scholars of the different schools of jurisprudence that the Qur'an and the Sunnah (the Traditions) of the Prophet (peace be upon him) are the only primary sources. In view of the extreme complexity of the possible sources of legal provisions, there can be no complete consensus on the subsidiary sources. It emerges however from the different schools of jurisprudence that the most commonly accepted subsidiary sources are: Consensus of Opinion, Reasoning by AIlalogy, Equitable Discretion, and finally Interests. The article is divided into two parts. Part One consists of five sections, and Part Two, to be published in a subsequent issue of the Arab Law Quarterly, is divided into three further sections, a Conclusion and a list of References. The first section introduces the ShanNah and its main characteristics. The second and third sections address the verification and audentication of the texts of the Qur'an and the Sunnah. Sections four and five underline the importance of the scientific tjurisprudential) understanding and study of these texts and briefly sets out the subsidiary sources which complement them. Sections six and seven are devoted to the examination of the theoretical and practical aspects of the process of reasoning snd forming legal opinions (idjtEha4. Finally, section eight is dedicated * The original idea of writing on the process of forniing legal opinions according to the Shansah relates back to the years 1979-1984 dunng which I was assigned to give lectures in English on chosen topics of Islamic Law to the students of the Faculty of Sharia and Law of the United Arab Ertiirates University at al-'Ain. Although this ariicle could be described as an outgrowth of the notes I prepared for the lectures they have been completely rewntten, expanded and updated, and I hope that this arecle will help students, lawyers and the general reader have a better understanding of and insight into the legal systems which consider the Shanah as "a" or "the" pnncipal source of legislation. I would like to add that some of the material and information contained in this work has been built up from my own identification of the special need for certainty and predictability of businessmen who wish tO plan their business relations with Muslim countries tor communities) with good knowledge of how and on what basis some basic business issues will be dealt with in accordance with the principles and detailed rules of the Shanfflah. It is not sufficient to know what is the Islamic legal ruling with respect to a certain issue; it is equally important to know how, by whom, for whom, and on what basis such a ruling is sought, given and irnplemented. 148</page><page sequence="2">149 REASONING IN ISLAMIC LAW: PART ONE to the analysis and review of the various trends, whether old, modern or current, in respect of the role of iditihad as a means to achieve the goals of the Sharzsah under varying and changing circumstances. 1. THE SHARI'AH: THE LAW OF ISLAMIC FAITH Historical background MusIim scholars say that Islamic faith ('aqtzdak) has its own law: the Islamic SharzNah. Both Islamic law and Islamic faith are derived, on the strength of belief (lman) and reason ('aql), from two basic sources (masadir) or proofs (adillah). The first basic source of Islamic law and Islamic faith is the Qur'an: the Book (al-Kitab) revealed by God (Allah) to His chosen last Prophet (Nabiy) and Messenger (Rasul) Muhamrnad ibn 'abdil-Lah (peace be upon him) through the Angel Gabriel (Djibril). The second source is the Sunnah of the Prophet which consists of his sayings (aqzoal), actions (af al) and confirmations (tavrt^rat). The faith is definitive and all-embracing. It provides guidance for the assessment and judgment of all beliefs and actions of all men and women in all places and at all times. The SharGah, like the faith of which it is the authentic expression, is also definitive and all-embracing. The domain of the Sharzsah is not limited to the regulation of the lives of the people in this world, but it extends to the regulation of their destinies in the hereafter. It is the duty of all reasonable persons, who are the addressees (makhatabun) or obligors (makallafun) of the precepts of the Message (Risalah) to comply with these precepts and to adjust their veritable and variable needs and interests according to the rules and principles derived from the sources of the Shansah. The ascertairlment and authentication of the sources of the SharzÂ¢ah and the formulation and deduction from these sources of the principles and rules which are most appropriate for the regulation of the changing needs and interests of the makallafun insrolve an integrated snd continuing process of well-informed and careful constructive thinking and reasoning (idjtihad). Reasoned rule-making and reasoned mle-application m accordance with the sources of the SharzNah are the life-blood of the science of jurisprudence (figh) and its sister science of foundations of jurisprudence (2zstulul-fiqh). Throughout its long and rich hlstory, Islamic jurisprudence offers a very fine example of the outcome of the humarl (bashard effort to understand and implement the divine (ilahzO texts of the Qur'an and the Sunnah of the Prophet:l l For a simple and straight account of the different phases of the history of Islamic jurisprudence, cf. al-Khudan, 80, 100, 126, 232, 266-267; Shi_atah, 9-15.</page><page sequence="3">150 ARAB LAW QUARTERLY (1) The work of the founders of jurisprudence (11-40AH) was entirely original and illdependent. The scholars ('ulama') and jurisprudents (fuqaha') who followed their lead laid the firm foundations of legal methods (40-1OOAH). Then the principles and rules of the different schools of jurisprudence (madhahib fiqhiyyah) took their final shape (100-350AH). (2) The jurisprudents of later ages (350-900AH), the muta'akhkAirun, devoted much of their time and efforts to the devising of rules for the making of a choice (tardylh) from the conflicting and opposing opinions of the leading jurisprudents of the earlier ages, the mutaqaddimun. The view prevailed that such choice should be made from the well-established opinions of the recognised masters of the jurisprudent's own school. As a matter of principle, the juxtaposition (talfzq) of the views of the schools irl respect of a certaill question was not perniitted. (3) The jurispmdents of the tenth, eleventh and twelfth Hidjri centuries concentrated on matters of form and failed to maintain a strong and renewed link with the books which dealt with the original sources of Shar&lt;ah. (4) The thirteenth and fourteenth Hidjr; centuries witnessed the revival of the scholarly and well-orgnnised studies of the rich heritage of the past. This paved the way for the direct recourse to the original sources without being bound by the views of the schools. The stage was set for the restoration of the methods of absolute reasoning not limited by the teachings of any pariicular school. (5) Most modern scholars admit that absolure reasoning by well qualified absolute muditahids or scholars (muditahidin mutlaqu^n) should be fully restored. Old ideas however die hard. The old methods of limited reasoning and imitation (taql^g) of the old masters of the schools of jurisprudence, very much cherished by limited mudjlahids (mudjtahidun muqaiyadun) and imitators (muqallidun) may come to the surface from time to time. The foundations of Islamic faith Theologians say that Islam is a simple and intuitive faith. It is based on clear foundations which are valid at all times and in every place. As these foundations are the core of the Muslim's belief, it follows that disbelief in any one of them is equivalent to disbelief in all of them. The more a Muslim gains in his knowledge about them, the more he will gain in ie strength of his belief in Islam. The said foundations of the faith are the following:2 (1) Belief in the oneness of God (Allah) and rejection of all forms of idolatry. (2) Belief that Muhammad is a Messenger of God and that he is the last such Messenger. (3) Belief in divine revelation and in all the Prophets, whether they are mentioned in the Qur'an or not. "We have sent revelations to you 2 M. 'A. al-Khfili(c), 28-29; 'Uwais(f), 9-10.</page><page sequence="4">REASONING IN ISLAMIC LAW: PART ONE 151 (Muhammad) as We sent revelations to Noah and the Prophets after him; and We sent revelations to Abraham and Ishmael and Isaac and Jacob and the twelve sons of Jacob, and to Jesus and Job, and to Jonah and Aaron and Solomon, snd to David We gave the (Book of) Psalms" (4 sn-Nisa) 163). "And to Messengers We did not relate to you about, and to Moses God spoke directly" (4 an-Nisa', 164). (4) Belief in the divinely revealed books, in their pure original form, free from distortions and forgeries. (5) Belief in the Angels, in their characteristics, assignments and functions as set out in the Qur'an and the Sunnah. (6) Belief in resurrection, judgment, reward, punishment, paradise, hell and fate: "The Messenger (Miammad) believes in what has been sent down to him from his Lord, and so do the faithful. Each one believes in God, His Angels, His Books and His Messengers. We make no distinction between one another of His Messengers - and they say: We hear and obey, (we seek) Your forgiveness, O Lord, and to You is ffie return (of all)" (2 al-Baqarah, 285). The attributes of God God is the Supreme Law-Giver and all the rules of ShartNah are based on His orders, prohibitions and permissions. A proper understanding of the SharlNah requires therefore the review of the attributes of God and their meanings as revealed in the Qur'an and the Sunnah and interpreted by Muslim theologians. In IsIamic faith, God has no equal: "There is nothing like Him" (42 ash-Shura, 11). Suratul-Ikhlas describes God in four concise verses: "Say: He is God, One. God, the Eternal Refuge. He begets not, nor has He been begotten. And neither is there any equal to Him" (112, 1-4, Khatib, 826). Other descriptions of God are the following: (1) The Creator: "God is the Creator of earerything and He takes care and disposes of all things" (39 az-Zlumur, 62). (2) The Omniscient: "All-Knower of the unseen (ghaib) and the seen (shahadah), the Great and High" (13 ar-Ra'd, 9). (3) The Giver of Everything: "God, it is He who has made for you the earth a dwelling place and the sky a canopy, who has given you shape and made it the best shape. That is God, your Lord, so blessed be God, the Lord of all the Worlds" (40 Ghafir, 64). (4) The Originator of everything: "He is the Originator of the heavens and che earth, how can He have a son when He has no wife? He has created all things and He is the All-knower of everything. That is God, your Lord. There is no God but He, the Creator of aIl things. So worship Him alone and He looks after and disposes of everything. No vision can grasp Him, but He can grasp all visions. He is subtle and all-knowing" (6 al-An'arn, 101-103). The oneness of God does not allow any form of incamation or anthropomorphism. God, and God alone, is divine. Any allegation that God may get tired, relax, fight, assume a</page><page sequence="5">152 ARAB LAW QUARTERLY certan form, prefer a certain human race, ignore certain Prophets, grieve or repent, is a false allegation, because it is contary to the majesty of God. God does not have offspring, and therefore He is free from the feelings and duiies counected with fatherhood. All creatures are His senrants (worshippers: 'ablFduh) and dependents (Â¢iyalah). He chooses His Prophets from among them as He pleases and His critena for jlldging their virtues are the same for all. God is One and Almighty and has no equals. No one of His servants (worshippers) of whatever elevated rank he may be, even Jesus) Muhammad or Abraharn (the Father of the Prophets), has ever ceased to be a servant (worshipper) in his relation with Him. All Prophets are His servants (worshippers); their submission and obedience to Him only add to their pnde and honsur.3 The analysis and understanding of the true meg of the attributes of God has always been one of the most difficult subjects for Muslim philosophers and scholasiic ieologians (mutakallim). Ibn Tabiyyah, in a book dedicated to the prevention of conlradiction (ta'dZ between reason (aql) and reqveQled texts (nagl), expressed the new that a fait Muslim should accept the attributes of God as revealed in the texts without attempting to make fuier inquiiries about how these attributes exist in fact and without trying to compare or liken them to anything he knows: ... ibn Tyyah believes that the attributes of God are realX not metaphorical or allegorical, because God exists in reality and not in a metaphorical or allegorical sense. He rightly points out that these attibuees are not in any way slar to the attributes of human beings. Since the reality of the attnbutes follows in the reality of the subjea described and since we do not krlow the exact essence of God (adh-Dhatul-IMhEyyah), it follows that we cot know the exact meaning or condition of the attributes of God .... Inability to understand is in itself understanding; exploring the essence of God is a kind of idolatry .... Glory be to Him who has made the impossibility $o lulow Him the only way to know Him.4 The absolute is nowable: 'CEverything that comes to your mind is perishing, and God is different from that" (kullu ma khatara bi balika fa hawa halik; wal- Lahu bi khilafi dhalik).5 It does not befit God the One, to be content with the submission of men in respect of their feelings and to rerwounce their submission to Him in respect of their actions and behaviour. Besides, the assertion of God's dominion in the Hereafeer does not mean that He has relinquished His domirlion un this world.6 3 'Uwais(f), 11. 4 al-Djulaixiid, 55; cf. ibn Tauniyyah: 5, passim, where he set out his defence against his detractors who accused him of ascribing human forms and attributes to God (andropomorphism). 5 Macdorlald, 38, 1st col. On de premise dat it is beyond the reach of the mind to grasp the true meaning of the reality of the atzbutes of God, it is improper to deal with the texts revealed by Ged by follonving the same methods of dealing with ordinary human texts. Some scholars say that for this reason it is wrong tO consider or ty to understand the reasons behind the revealed texts, dlus praciically excluding the use of analogy and all other forms of reasoning, al-Milik;, 162-163. The majonty of jurisprudents reject this rigid approach arg that it is preasely the divirle nature of the ters which calIs for the use of differerlt forms of reasoning to ensure the continuance of their application to de new events and arcumstances, al-Mali, 164-166; cf. seciion 8. olnder the heading "Balanang change and immutability", second para.

It is revealed to me that your God is One God. Hence whoever yearns for the meeting with his Lord, let him do a righteous deed, and let him associate none with his Lord in serving Him" (18 al- Kahf, 110, Khatzb) 395). In this respect, Muhammad's human nanlre is the same as the human nature of all the Prophets (peace be upon them) who had preceded him. And We have not sent before you (Mu_arnrnad) except men to whom We revealed (ask them, the people of knowledge, if you know not) with plain proofs (baiyinat) and books (zabur) and We harre sent down to you the dhikr (i.e., the Qur'an or exhortation to remember) chat you may elucidate to the people what has been sent down to them and that perhaps they may reflect (16 an-Nahl, 43-44, Khatib, 351). On the 13th day of Rab;'ul- Awwal in the tenth year of the Hidjrah (8 June 632 AC) the Messenger of God uttered his last words: "The Highest Compariion", and the stunning news was heard that he had died. People at first refused to believe, but when abu-Bakr came before them he said: "O men, those of you who worshipped Muharrunad must know that he is dead. But for those who worship God, He (i.e. God) is alive and never dies". Then he recited the following verse: "Muhammad is but a Messenger, preceded by other Messengers. Will it be that, if he dies or be slain, you will turn back on your heels? But whoever turns back on his heels will not harrn God in any way; God shall recompense the thankful" (3 Al-'Imran, 144). People looked at each other as though they had only heard these words for the first te; realisation sank in that Miarnmad was no different from other men and that indeed he had passed away.7 As a human being, the Prophet is not infallible, but in matters of religion he is guided by God through revelation. It is reIated that the Prophet had said: ';You know better than me your worldly affairs and I know better than you your religious affairs". The Prophet uttered this Had1th when he realised that it was wrong to tell the people of Madmah not to pollinate their date palm-trees.8 The above shows that not all that the Prophet said, did, or confirmed should be considered as part of his binding Sunnah. His social habits of greeting, eatzg and drinking, and dressing, as well as his tactics in battles set good examples for others to follow, but they are not legally binding.9 Most scholars are of the opinion that the verses of 53 an-Nadim, 3-4, "Neither does he (the Prophet) speak out of whim. It is naught but a revelation (zuaty) inspired" (Khatib, 700), refer to the revelation of the Qur'an and do not mean that everything said, done, or confirmed by the Prophet should be considered as inspired, directly or indirectly, by God.lÂ° 7 Kh ib S lih^ 9 8 Sshth2w Muslxm: 4, nos. 5830-5832, 1259 Cf. al-'Umarl(b), 83; Waf2, 232-233; Yamam, 51. 9 abu-Zahrah, 89.

"Is it, therefore, the rule of the age of ignorance (djahilEyyah) that they desire? But who is better for judgment than God for a people of firm faith?" (5 al-Ma'idah, 50 Khaiib, 147). The way (shar') of God should be strictly followed by the faithful, No other way devised by man can be better than the way of God, the omniscient. However, man is the appointee, agent or viceregent (khalxfah) of God on earth (2 al-Baqarah, 30) and as such, he is directly responsible to his Lord. This responsibility is based on the ocme intentions behind the actions rather than on the actions themselves. For example, the Qllr'an disapproved the building of a mosque by some people only because the true intention of these people was to do hallll by creating cleavage arnong Musluns: Those who established a mosque to cause harm and disbelief and disagreement among the believers, and to llse it as an observation pOiIlt for those who had earlier waged war against God alld His Messenger, will swear that their interltion was nothillg but good. But God is wimess that they are certaialy liars. Never perform prayer in it. The mosque whose foundaiion was laid from the first day on fear of God is worthier for you to perforrn prayer in it. You will find therein men who love to purify themselves, and God loves those who make themselves pure (9 at-Tawbah, 107-108). It is significant to note that the first Hadlth in the collection of Hadzths by al- Bukhari reads as follows: "The reward of deeds depends upon the intentions and every person will get reward according to what he has intended": (innamal-a'mal binniyyazzi wa li kulli-mri'in ma nawa^).ll A learned scholar summarised oche tenets of Islam as follows: The word Islam . . . means the complete surrender and veneranon of God. As a religion it is meant to complete and seal all heavfenly religions, to embrace them and to supplant all previous holy laws. Islarn is bliilt on five pillars, namely; the belief in the oneness of God and that Miamrnad is His Messenger (la ilaha illal-Lah wa MuJzanwnadur-RasiGlul-Ldh): the observing of prayer (salah); the paying of the purification dues (zakah); the fast of (the month of) Rarnadnn (swawm); and the pilgrimage to Maldrah (hadidy). Two aspects, therefore, a creed and ntual obligations reqliinng action, are the central core of Islam. The creed itself rests on the belief that Muhammad's revelations (waAy) are the true and immutable word of God . . . to teach people the correct aIld virtuous path in life in order to create a proper harmony for man refleciing the harmony, balance and inter-dependerlce of all God's creation.l2 The etymology of the word Shan'ah The word SharzNah in Arabic means "the apparent and clear source of water" (al- Misba_ ul-MIlnir; al-Qamusul-Muhit) or "the road leading to a source of water".l3 As translated by M. M. Khan, Sahihul-Bukharf: 1, 1. 't Khadb, xxxix-xl. Cf. Shihatah, p. 15 et seq., for a complete and simplified account of ese pillars. 13 al-Baidawi: 2, 153</page><page sequence="8">REASONING IN ISLAMIC LAW: PART ONE 155 The word was used to mean the law made by God because He made it apparent and clear (Cf. the Latin words lux and lex, the English light and nght and the German Licht and Recht) or because that law is as necessary for the life of the faithfill as a source of water is necessary for the life of all living thlngs. The word Shanah occurs only orlce in the Qur'an: "then when We put you on the road (Shari'ah) of the matter (of religion), so follow it" (45 al-Djahiyah, 18). The word Shir'ah, which is equivalent to the word SharaNah, also occurs once in the Qur'an: "to each of you We have made a road (Shir'ah) and a way (minhadJ)" (5 al-Ma';dah, 48). The verb Shara'a occllrs twice in the Qur'an: "He made apparent (Sharaa) to you of religion that which He has bequeathed to Noah and that which We revealed to you" (42 ash-Shura, 13);14 "or do they have partners who made apparent to them (Shara'a) of religion that which God did not permit?" (42 ash- Shura, 21). The continuity of Islam as religion Muslim theologians say that the true religion in the view of God is Islam (3 Al- 'Imran, 19, 85). "Do they wish to embrace a religion other than the religion of God where all who are in heavens and in earth have, willingly or unwillingly, surrendered (aslamu) to Him?" (3 il-'Imran, 83). "I have perfected my blessing and accepted Islam a religion for you" (5 al-Ma'idah, 3). The revelation of Islam to Muhammad was preceded by many messages throughout the ages. "Muharnmad is but a Messenger who has been preceded by other Messengers" (3 Al-'Imran, 144). "Abraham was neither a Yahudz^(Jew) nor a Nasranz (Christian), but was a Hanif Muslim" (3 Al-'Imran, 67). Literally, the word han2^f means a person who tums sideways, but in the context of this verse it means a persorl who has abandoned the belief in associated Gods (shirk) and embraced the belief in the oneness of God (tawhZd). Exert your efforts for the cause of God as it rightly deserves (by establishing His religion). He has chosen you (for His religion). He has not imposed on you any hardship in religion. The religion of your father Abraham. He (God) called you Muslims before (this Book) and in this (Book) so that the Messenger may be a wimess on you (in the day of resurrection that he has infolllled you) and you wimesses on people (that their Messengers nforrned them). So perform saldh (prayer) and pay zakah (alms-ux, etymologically: pfication of one's own material assets by giving out of chem to help others) and have faith in God. He (God) is your Lord (and Support). He is surely the best Lord and the best Support (22 al-Hadjdj, 78). On the other hand, Islarn, as revealed to Muhammad, is the last divine revelation. "Muhammad was not the father of sny of your men, but he is the Messenger of God and the seal of the Prophets" (33 al-Ahzab, 40). This verse refers to the repeal of the institution of adoption and at ie same time pomts out that there will be no more Prophets from among the issue of Muhaad (or Both He and We in the verse refer to God. Such conversion from one person (here the third person singular) to another person (here the first person plural) is termed: iltifar.</page><page sequence="9">156 ARAB LAW QUARTERLY indeed the issue of anyone else), as it was the case with the issue of Abraham, the Father of the Prophets. The word seal refers to the authentication by Mu_ammad, the last of the Prophets, of the precedmg revelations.l5 The essence of religion does not change with the change of the roads leading to it (Shara'i'). In fact, Muslim scholars agree that the different preceding SharVahs (shar'u man qablana) are binding on Muslims to the extent of the provisions of those ShanNahs which have not been repealed or varied by the provisions of the ShanKah revealed to Muhammad. 16 "Islam states that religion is one in consideration of God and that all creatures should submit and surrender tO Him. However, religious laws and rules differed according to the time and society in which each message or religion is revealed''.l7 According to al-Baidawi, the common Shar&lt;ah consists of havirlg faith in that which should be believed and obedience to the decrees of God. In addition to this common root (asl), each SharzNah has its own branches or ramifications (furu'). In support of this view, al-Baidawl cites 5 al-Ma'idah, 48: "to each of you We have made a road and a way''.l8 It is obvious that it follows from conceding the inclusion of the Shar's of the preceding nations (man qablana) in the shar' of the Muslim nation that the road (shir'ah) and the way (minhaFdy) peculiar to each nation relate to the branches, not to the common root. If interpreted in this way, the said verse provides only a weak argurnent in support of the view that denies that preceding divirle revelations can constitute a source of divine Islamic Shansah.l9 Call to Islam The call to Islam (da'wah) is based on persuasion and conviction, gained through discussion and good example. "Call (people) to the way of your Lord with wisdom and good advice and argue with them m the best possible way" (16 an-Nahl, 125). "Had your Lord so willed, all people on earth would have believed. Would you then compel people to believe? No one will believe except with the leave of God and He will put the wrath on those who are heedless" (10 Yiinus, 99-100). "There is no compulsion in religion. Disiinct is the right way from the wrong way" (2 al- Baqarah, 256). The Qur'an is explicit that the mission of the Prophet is to convey the Mesaage. 15 'A. Y. 'Ali^, 1069, n. 3731; A. 'Ali, 359; Wadjdl^, 89; ibnus-Salah(c), 73. 16 ibnul-'Arabi, 23-24. It is noteworthy that there were in Arabia before the advent of Islam a small group of fait people (the "Hamys") who professed the old faith of Ibrahim (Abraham) based on de belief in the oneness of God and the rejection of all forms of idolatry, 'abdul-Karim, 25-26. 17 Khaiib, sli. 18 al-Baidam: 5, 52; cf. Isma'il, 29- l9 al-Baidawi: 5, 153. Athen the Shansah is referred to as the pnnapal source of legislanon (e.g., art. 2 of the Egyptian Constitution of 1971 as amended in 1980) it means the Qur'an, de Sunnah and all the subsidiary sources; the legislation thus derived from or based on the SharRah will be an instance of Islamic jurisprudence, an-Nabhan(d), 60. In such context, it would be inaccurate., as some writers suggest (Mustafoa 'A. al-Khiili, 99), to consider the Islamic jurisprudence as the principal source of legislation.</page><page sequence="10">REASONING IN ISLAMIC LAW: PART ONE 157 C&lt;The idolaters say: If God willed we would not have worshipped anything apart from Him) nor would our fathers have done, nor would we have forbidden anyching without His leave. So had the people done before them. Therefore, it is binding upon the Prophets to convey the Message irl cIear terms" (16 an-Nahl, 35).2Â° Besides, God has pledged that His Message shall reign supreme.2l The preachers of Islam (du'ah) should always remember that they should follow the great example of the Prophet in communicating with others for the purpose of explaining the mearling of the Message. "You have a paradigm in the Messenger of God' (33 al-Ahzab, 21). Tes have changed. The duah should live up to the requirements of change and the new problems of the people. For this purpose, they should be aware of ie latest developments in the fields of science and technology and of the different social and economic doctrines. Most important of all, they should nelrer lose faith or courage in the face of ie formidable difficulties which are the legacy of long years of stagnations ignorance and loss of direction.22 The way of life of Islam Muslim theologians and scholars say that Islam is a faith and a way of life. The history of the Muslims) with its glories and setbacks, is rich and instructive. The Muslims of today are fully aware of the great achievements of the first Muslims who laid down the practical foundations of a system of government based on tolerance, justice and equality. Modern Muslim thinkers take pride in pointing out that the institutions and concepts which can be directly ascribed to ie first three cenalries of Islam constitute a valuable contribution to the theories of economic and social development.23 Islam, as a matter of faith, is a religiorl, not a mere ideology, and as a matter of practice, a way of life, not a mere compilation of legal r1lles.24 The SharRah is concerned with the relations between man and his Creator as well as with e relations between man and his fellow men. The first are far more important ian the second. Those who fear God have the ability of distinciion between right and wrong (Cf. 8 al-Anf^al, 29) arld will find a way out of hardship (65 at-Talaq, 2). In Islam, the substance of justice prearails over legal forms.

The purpose of this rule is to inhibit the faithfil from taking advantage of a judicial error.26 Islam is based on consultation in all mauers of religion and life.27 The free exchange of views is bound to cultivate temperance, tolerance and moderation. Muslims have been described as a middle people (ummatan wasatan) by de Qur'an (2 al-Baqarah, 143). From this descripiion the scholars deduced a general principle of wasatiyyah which mea;rls juslice, goodness or the nght middle path: The method of the middle paoch belongs to the texts of the Qur'an and the Sllnnnh, but not necessarily to the interpretations of these texts by the jurisprudents That is why we find some extreme and fanatc views in all the schools of jurisprudence. These views should be considered as a mere reflection of the reaciion of their proponents to the circumstances prevailing at a certain e or irl a certain place. But in the end, the rniddle or jUSt views of the texts will prevail.28 Islam is a practical religion which takes into consideration the various aspects of human nature: "God does not burden a soul beyond capacity" (2 al-Baqarah, 286). For example, the Qur'an states that "avance is part of man's nanare" (4 an-Nisa, 128), but at the same ame urges people to be lenient in the claim and enforcement of their legal rights and to be generous in the perfbrmance of their legal duties and obligations (jrartiba'um bil-ma'ruf wa ada'un ilaihi ba iAsan: let the pursuirlg be honourable, and let the payrnent be with kindliness, 2 al-Baqarah, 178, Arberry, 23) and categorically asks people not to forget to be bountifill one towards sIloier (2 al-Baqarah, 237, Arberry, 34). Moreover, the Qur'an describes the God-fearing people (mutraq^n) as those who spend in prosperity and adversity) restrain their rage and forgive people (3 S-'Imran, 134, Khatlb, 84). In Islam: "Realism coexists with idealism, this ensures that realism is not unduly suppressed and that idealism is not relmquished under the pretext that it is too difficult to attain".29 For example, there are no specific forms for the realisaiion of the Islamic ideals of unity and justice through closer co-operation of 25 As translated by M.

And hold fast all together, by the rope which God (stretches out for you), and be not divided among yourselves (3 Al-'Irnran, 103, 'A. Y. 'Al;, 153). O believers, stand up as witnesses for God in all faimess, and do not let the hatred of a people deviate you from justice. Be just, this is closest to piety (5 al-Ma'idah, 8, A. 'Al;, 99). There is a growing awareness among Muslims that their success m irnplement- ing the ideals of Islam in achieving justice and progress will ultimately depend on their ability to benefit from the lessons of the past to face the challenges of the present and ensure that there will always be a firm ground for improvement and continuing success m the future. Reason and freedom of faith and thought Islam, in its dual role as faith ('aqxdah) and law (Shartsah), is addressed to reasonable people whom God has endowed with the capacity to understand and to distinguish between what is good and what is bad. The Qur'an lays much stress on the necessity of making use of one's own reason both in matters of belief and action: "We have created for Gehenna many jinn and men; they have hearts, but understand not with them; they have eyes, but perceive not with them, they have ears, but they hear not with them. They are like cattle, nay, rather they are further astray. Those - they are the heedless" (7 al-A'rif, 179, Arberry, 165). This verse describes the people who apparently have all the faculties of reason and perception, but deliberately refilse to make use of them. Such people deserve to go headlong into hell. They are, as it were, made for hell.31 Everyone shall be caIled to account for the use, suse, or non-use of the faculties accorded to him, including his intellect. ''AIld pursue not that thou hast no knowledge of; the hearing, the sight, ie heart- all of those shall be questioned OfrX (17 al-Isra', 36, Arberry, 278).

A well-known dictum of abu- Hanifah, the founder of the Hanafi school, corlfiluls this view: "This kIlowledge of ours is (based on) our opinion (ra'y): but we are ready to accept any better opinion of anyone else". The understanding of the faith and of the Sharlsah is not an exclusive monopoly of any person or group of persons: "The mere idea of a separate order of priesthood to stand between God and man and to be the repository of God's secrets is derogatory to the goodness and all pervading grace of God".34 Free thinking should be well organised d for good purpose, as there is no use in chaotic or aimless thinking: Islam prescnbes that the believers should thirlk independently in order to form their own judgments, free of the iMuence of predecessors (salaf), pnests (ahbar) or tyranny (istibdad). At the same iime, Islam prescnbes an obligation to respect the parents (Arld do goced to parents, 4 m-Nisa', 36); an obligaiion to seek infortnaeon from the wise people (Ask of those who possess the Message, 16 an-N6, 43) and an obligation to obey the people in authority (O you who believe, obey God and obey the Messenger and those charged mrith authority among you; if you differ in anything among yourselves, refer it to God arld His Messenger, if you do believe in God and the last day. That is best, and most suiitable for fmal determinaton, 4 an-Nisa', 59). The rales of the SharzNah are intended to be complied with by reasonable people who should be capable of understandirlg their meaning, objectives and the circumstces and conditions for which they are made. Reasonable people are diSerent from robots and axiimals whose role is confmed to just receiving orders and discharging them without y intellectual or creative effort.

Reasonable people should seek the advice of the people who know, but they should be able to realise that it is futile to consult the people who lmow if it becomes apparent that those people are unwillirlg (or not prepared) to rnake any proper use of what they know. A lay person, endowed wich the gift of reason, should be able to krlow whether a certairl scholar is sincere or a hypocrite.

But the group of people who devote themselves to the study of religion should not form a separate clergy or priesffiood: "The Islamic way of life does not admit the kind of asceticism or seclusion which is peculiar to monks or darwishes; it iS based on work, toil, production and strong motivation to achieve the best in every aspect of life".36 The people who devote themselves tO the study of the religion should pard themselves against the danger of fanaticism and all other forms of excess: "Islam is the religion of the middle path; there should be no excesses in the practice of Islarn. The real problem is that the Muslims are either lax and careless about the implementation of the teachings of their religion or very strict about the literal application of what they believe to be the teachings of Islam. The truth lies in between these two extremes".37 It is quite evident that the excesses of the fanatics are OUt of context, whether in respect of time, as when they merely reflect a nostalgia to relive the past, or place) as when such excesses are intended to be practiced in non-Muslirn countries.38 Fanaticism leads to the suppression of freedom of thought and to tyranny. The fanatics do not accept even to consider the opinions of others, however faithful and well-founded dose opinions may be. It is almost a universal practice arnong t:he farlatics to accuse any person who has the courage tO express a different view, of being a disbeliever or a renegade. Besides, the fanatics, in order to impress others by appearing as the most devoted believers, tend to select and adopt the most difficult views and solutions.39 The SharRah is against all these forms of fanaticism. The Qur' imposes on people the duucy to consult with each oder (3 Al-4Imran, 159; 42 ash-Shura, 38) and not to argue except ln oche fairest manner (29 al-'Ankabut, 46). The Prophet warned against accusing each oder of infidelity. A v7Sid Hadzth of the Prophet states: "If any one tells his brother that he is a disbeliever, one of the wvo will bear the consequences". This means iat if the person accused of disbelief is not m fact a disbeliever, the person accusing him of disbelief will hirnself be guilty of disbelief.40 Those who select intentionally to follow the path of hardship, overlook the fundamental principle of the SharlNah that hardship (haradj) should be alleviated or 36 al-Qaradaw;(b), 116; cf.

A person can defend himself against the tyrsnny of physical force by disapproving it in his OWD thinking or by seeking refuge in a safer place. The tyray of religious thought suppresses the desire, snd consequently the very ability, of thinking freely. It is true that the tyranny of physical force tends to generate a systematic obstinacy of rejection; an evil by no means less harmfill than the evil of constant complacency and blind conformism, but at least the mind is left free to choose the course of action it prefers: resistance, subterfige, migration or even, as a last resort, wlful submission.42 Just as fanaticism and extremism, if left unbridled, will result in tyranny and despotism, freedom of thought, if well protected, will stem de evil effects of fanaticism and will ensure that all forms of excess be detected and remedied as they appear. Free exchange of views and ideas is the best guarantee for che development of construciive thought.43 2. THE QUR'AN: TEXTUAL INTEGRITY AND AUTHENTICITY The 'Uthmarli copy or Mushaf The Arabic form of writing and spelling the words of the Qur'an is called the 'Uthmanz^ form (ar-rasmul-'UthmanS), after the name of the third rightly-guided Caliph 'Uthman ibn 'Affan who was the first to arrange for the making of complete copies of the Qur'an and sending them to the major centres of the then newly- established Islamic State. All reliable sources agree that the 'Uthmanf Mushaf, or the 'UtAmam copy of the Qur'an, has been trsnsmitted uninterruptedly from one generation to another till the present day. For this reason, the 'UthmaAn1 Mushaf is usually called the "Master Mus7zaf ' (al-Muswhaful-Im).44 The original 'Uthmanz^ orthography (rasm) made scarce use of long vowels and had no diacritics to represent the short vowels. For a long time the correct reading aIld recitation of the Qur'an depended on oral traditions. But when it became apparent that it was extremely difficult for the increasing number of Muslims whose mother tongue was not Arabic to depend entirely on oral traditions, the scholars (al-Khalil ibu Ahmad and abul-Aswad ad-Du'al;) introduced signs and diacritics to make it easier for all, whether Arabs or non-Arabs, to read and recite the Qur'm correctly.45 Other improvements were made, for example, special 41 'A.

These rules are strictly observed in the making of the M2zs7taSs. Though Arabic orthography has developed much since the days of 'Uinan ibn CAffzan, all the modern Muswhags are still made according to the rules of the old ( UthmanzA orchography. It is common knowledge that though the rules of the current Arabic orthography is more consistent and simpler than de 'Uthmani orthography, the use of the former in the making of the Mushafs will not bring about any significant change in the number of forms) signs and abbreviations which still have to be used to represent the rules of tadjwzAd. Orl balance, most scholars are of the opinion that the simplicity which will be achieved through the use of the current Arabic orthography will not produce any worthwhile practical effect, since the elaborate and complicated rules of tadjw^d should always be included m the MuswhaSs, regardless of the type of their orthography, ( Uthmanz^, modem, current or otherwise. Therefore, it would be better to continue and sustain the usage of the ' Uthmam orthography. Why should de certainty of the ' UthmanzA orthography be given up in retum for the uncertain simplicity of de current orthography? The GeneraI Presidency of de :Directorates of Scientiflc Research and Legal Advice in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia examined the question of Qur'anic orchography and issued the foIIowing legal opinion: First: It is well proven that the {Uthman:^orthography was used in the writzg of the Qur'an dg the reign of 'Uthman who requested e master eopy makers to give preference, in ease of differenee, to the language of Quraish. This indieates that he had a firm 11 that the master eopy makers should use a fixed orthography. The aetion of 'Uthman was approved by the Companions of the Prophet (as-Sahabah), their Suceessors (at-Tabi'iin) and the Sueeessors of the Sueeessors (Tabi'ut-Tabi'in) and all subsequent generations to date. The orthography used in the M2XGhaSs was not ehanged as and when improvements were made in the Arabie orthography used in ordinary books and treatises. It is proved that the Prophet had said: '&lt;You should follow my Sunnah and the sunnah of my nghtly-guided sueeessors". It follows that it is a duty upon us to use the ( Uthmans orthography in the MuswhaCs; that was the sltnnala followed by 'Uthrnan and 'Ali (the third and fourth rightly-ded Caliphs) and the ocher Companions of the Prophet and thus amounts to an authentic consensus of opinion (idima). Second: The current orthography now in use is the outcome of coniinuous development d improvement in the methods of wriiing Arabic. The Arabic orthography, as mdeed the orthography of any other language, can siill be filrther deareloped and improved. If we adopt in the iing of the Qur'an the current orthography, we shall have to change from iime to iime the text of the Qur'an in order to keep it constantly in line with new developments and improvements. Such constant change in the form of the text of the Qur'an may lead to 46 A pause (waqf) dunng the recitanon of the Qur'an is either permissible ('tZ), prohibited (1s yadRjazal-wagf), preferable (al-waqfu awid), not preferable (al-wastiu awid, i.e., continuation is preferable), mandatory (lazim3) or akernauve (ta'dnaqul-wa&lt;0.</page><page sequence="17">164 ARAB LAW QUARTERLY impercepiible errors and mistakes in that text; a great evil which should be avoided by all possible means. . . It is one of the main aims of the Shar2&lt;ah to prevent evil by blocking the roads leasSing to it (saddudh-dhara'i') and to eradicate it in case it sets in. Ihird: Accepiing the principle of change in the orthography of the Qur'an may inspire people to apply to this orthography any new suggestions or ideas that may occur to them from time to tirne and may also give a ready justificaiion to those people who wish to use the Hebrew and Latin characters in the writing of the Qur'an. The proponents of such undesirable innovations as the use of foreign characters may invoke the same arguments which are invoked by the supponers of the use of the easy and simple current Arabic orthography; namely: the bging of ease, the removal of hardship, and the enlarging of the circle of the people who may be noiified of the evidence of the true faith.47 The most important modern development is the history of editing the Mus71af took place in the year 1923 AC (1342 AH) when a special committee norninated by King Fu'ad the First of Egypt finished its work under the supervision of the Grand Shaikh of al-Azhar and published a fine, elegant, and accurate edition of the Muswhaf based on the recitation (qira'ah) of 'Asim as narrated by HaSs. This new edition, with its improved signs and abbreviations, is considered by an expert in the sciences of the Qur'an as the best edition ever made of the Muswhaf in the 'UthmanzA form.48 No wonder therefore that the millions of the Musthafs printed and distributed on the order and at the expense of the Custodian of the two Holy Mosques King Fahd ibn 'abdil-'Aziz Al-Sa'ud, are based on the said edition which, for this reason, is more and more accepted as the standard Mushaf. Though the use of the 'Uthmanz orthography is mandatory in the Mus71afs, it is permissible to use the current orthography in writing the verses of the Qur'an in books and newspapers and other publications for the purposes of interpretation, discussion, or education. However, it is always preferable (as Sandi publications do) wherever possible, to use the 'UrAmanzForthography in all printed citations of the verses of the Qur'an. The mandatory use of the Arabic original of the Qur'an The Arabic original of the Qur'an is the only authoritative version of the Qur'an. No other version in any other language cnn be considered as equivalent to the original Arabic version. It is common knowledge that translations, however accurate they may be, can never express the fnesse and nuance of the terrninology and style of the original text except in a very approximate manner.49 This is true of the Qur'an more dan any other book.

The scholars, in order to reconcile the need for the preservation of the integrity of the Arabic original of the Qur'an with the need of the non-Arabic speaking persons to learn and study the contents of the Qur'an, have agreed that as it is permissible to explain and interpret the meaning of the Qur'an in Arabic, it should be permissible, by analogy, to explain and interpret the meaning of the Qur'an in any language other than Arabic. Any translation of the Qur'an should be viewed as an interprerative or explanstory version of the Qur'an, but never as a substitute for the Arabic text of the Qur'an.5l It is noteworthy that the Islamic Research Academy of al-Azhar in Egypt requires for obtaining its authorisation to publish a translation of the meaning of the Qur'an that the translator and the publisher be comrnitted in every copy to the following points: It should be mentioned in the preface or introduction that it is a translation of the meaning of the Qur'an as understood by the translator.

The prayers of persons who cannot recite the Qur'an in Arabic "lohe prayer is a duty on the faithful at fixed hours" (4 an-Nisa', 103). For the prayer to be valid and acceptable, the faithful are required to recite passages from the Qur'. This requirement applies to all Muslims. Muslims whose mother tongue is not Arabic leam by heart some verses or short surahs of the Qur'an for the purpose of saying or performing their prayers. abu-Hanlfah, the founder of the Hanaf; school of jurisprudence, said that the Muslim whose mother tongue is not Arabic may recite in his prayer the opening Surah of the Qur'an (Fatihah) in his own mother tongue. abu-Yusuf and ash- Shaiban;, both of the same Hanafi school, said that the reciting of the openirlg Surah of the Qur'an in a language other than Arabic is perlllissible only in case of necessity, i.e., if the performer of prayer cannot memorise the Arabic words of the 50 Arberry, ix, xii: "I have called my version (of the Qur'an) an interpretation, conceding the orthodox claim that the Qur'an . . . is untranslatable; in making this interpretation I have considered the opinions of the learned cornmentators and when . . . they have differed, I have been eclectic in deciding between alternaiive explanations".

Later Hnnafi scholars claim that abu-Hanifah changed his niind and a&amp;ered to the view of his two companions.54 The scholars of the other schools of jurisprudence (the Malikis, the Shafi';s and the Hanbalis) are unanimously of the opinion that the principle of not allowing any translation of the Qur'an should be strictly followed without any exception on the ground of necessity (darurah) or ease (taiszzr). The person who cannot memorise the opening Surah of the Qur'an, can, on the ground of necessity or ease, say in his prayer any simple Arabic words in praise of God. If he is incapable of doing this, he should remain silent. But on no account should he recite the opening Surah of the Qur'an in his native tongue, otherwise his prayer will not be accepted.55 3. THE SUNNAH: TEXTUAL INTEGRITY AND AUTHENTICITY The preservation of the Sunnah The second divine source of the ShanNah, after the Qur'an, is the Sunnah of the Prophet, i.e., his legally binding sayings (aqwa^l), actions or deeds (afal), and confirmations (laqr*at). The legislative Sunnah was expressly or tacitly confirmed by the Qur'an and for this reason is considered as God inspired.56 Thought the Sunnah is considered as part of revelation (waAy) in the wide sense, there has always been, from the very beginning, a great concern to distinguish between the Sunnah and the Qur'an, so that people may not coduse the one with the other. The Prophet permitted the recording in writing of the Qur'an as and when it was revealed to him, whereas he emphatically (as related by Muslim) prohibited the recording in writing of his own sayings: "Anyone who wrote anything I said should erase it except the Qur'an.

Two generations later, the Umaiyad Caliph 'Umar ibn 'abdil- 'Aziz instructed abu-Bakr Muhammad ibn 'Amr, who was the judge and governor of Madinah, to collect and record the HadsAths of the Prophet. Later on, the Umaiyad Caliph Hisham ibn 'abdil-Malik assigned the same task to az-Zuhr;. But the first real systematic written collections of HadsAths were al-Muwatta' by Malik (d. 179 AH) and al-MIlsnad by ibn Hanbal (d. 241 AH). Then followed the six great compilations of HadEths by al-Bukhari (d. 256 AH), Muslim (d. 261 AH), abu- Dawiid (d. 275 AH), ibn Madjah (d. 273 AH), at-Tirrni&amp;; (d. 279 AH) and an- Nasa'; (d. 303 AH).58 Successive generations of scholars laid down precise criteria to check the accuracy and genuineness of the reporting of the Sunnah.59 Many of the noticeable differences of opinion arnong the jurisprudents arose from their different approaches to the critical examination of the reporting of the texts of the Sunnah. The reporting (Hadzth) of the Sunnah soon became a science having its own techniques, terms and rules ('ilmul-HadzAth).60 The science of Hadith and its terminology The main purpose of the science of Had:^th is to lay down the criteria and rules for distinguishing between the HadzAths which should be accepted (maqbul) and the Hadzths which should be rejected (marfu). The accepted (maqbul) Hadzths are classified into two main categories: the valid Hadz^ths (sahz^h) and the good HadzSths (hasan). The valid (sahzh) Hadz^th is the Hadzzth whose support (sanad59 is an unbroken chain of narrators who were, down from the last narrator up to the Elrst narrator, just ('udul) and accurate (dabitun) and which is free from inconsistency (shudhzidh) with a more reliable narration or from any latent defect ('illah).6l The good Hadzzth (hasan) is the HadzAth whose support is sn unbroken chain of narrators who were just but not quite as accurate as the narrators of valid HadzAths. The good HadzAth, like the valid Hadlth, must also be free from inconsistency with a more reliable narration and from any kind of latent defects.62 A HadzXth may be described as good and valid (hasanun wa sahz^h). This description is usually used when dere are two supports, one good and the other valid, or when the same support of the HadzAth is classified as good by some scholars and as valid by others.63 The rejected (marfz%) Hadzzth is also termed weak (da'zf) Hadzth.

This explains the pariicular importance of the study of the terrninology of HadtAth (mustalakul-HedtAth). At first sight it might appear to the person who does not have good knowledge of the science of HadSh that the scholars of this science concentrated their efforts on the study of the supports of Hadzoths without giving equal attention to the study of the substance or the wording (matn) of HadShs. This is not true. The scholars of HadzFth, quite on the contrary, were fully aware that the main purpose of conducting thorough investigations in respect of the supports of HadaFths was to ascertain that their wording represented what d}e Prophet actually said (Sunnsh Qawliyyah):, did (Sunnah Fi'liyyah) or confinned (Sunnah Taqri^rayyah)*65 The meticulous criticism of the supports (asna) of Hadzth led to the following descriptions: The Hadz^th is described as slrange (ghan) or lonely (farS) if its chain of narrators contains only one person in any generation (tabagah) or if it is related only by the people of a certairl city or region.66 The Hadtoth is considered as loose ended (mursf), if its chain of narrators does not contain in its upper end the name of any person who belongs to the first generation.' The Had:^th which is ascribed to the Prophet is called a raised (marfu') HadIth.68 When the upper end of the chain of narrators stops at one of the Companions of - the Prophet (Sahabl), the Hadz^th is descrtbed as halted or stopped (mawquf) Hadiih.69 When the upper end of the chain of narrators ends at one of de Successors of the Companions of the Prophet (Tabi';), the Had^th is called a cur-off (maqtu') HadtSth 70 A raised (marfu') Hadazth supported by an unbroken chain of narrators in the three generalions (tabaqat) of the Companions (Sahabah), the Senior Successors (barut-Tabi'a^n) and the Intermediate Successors (at-Tabi'un al-Mutawassitun) may also be called a supported (musnad) Hadfth.7l Any Hadzth, even if it is halted (mawquf) or cut-off (maqtu'), may be called connected (Murtasa;), prourided it is supported by an unbroken chain of narrators up 64 as-Silih(a), 165; ibnus-Salih(a), 20. 65 Cf. n. 123 and n. 377 infra and their related texts. t ou at-Tshlzan, 28- ibnus-SalahEa), 36-37, 41. 67 as-S(a), 166; ibnus-Salah(a), 25.

This term applies also to the Hadlth whose chain of narrators contains an unidentified person (mabham).74 The HadtAth is termed enigmatic (mu'da[) if two successive persons are dropped from the chain of its narrators.75 A chained (musalsal) HadzAth is a HadzAth whose pattern of relaying was repeated by every relator. For example, "Relator A said: 'Relator B took my hand in his hand and said': 'Relator C took my hand in his hand and said': 'The Prophet took my hand in his hand and said': (then follows the actua1 text (matn) of the HadIth)".76 In case the relators do not specify the way of their knowledge of uche Hadz^th, the Hadzth will be considered as loosely connecred (mu'an'an or mu'annan). For example, the relator A through ('an) the relators B, C and D said that the Prophet had said: s&lt;(the text of Hadl^th)", or the relator A said that the relator B had said that the relator D had said that (anna) the Prophet had said: "(the text of Hadlth)". The words through ('an, hence the description: mu'an'an) and that (anna, hence the description: mu'annan) in the statement of the chain of relators do not indicate the precise manner in which the Hadzzth was communicated by the Prophet to the relator D (at the upper end of the chain of narrators) or by the relator D to the relator C or by the relator C to the relator B or by the relator B to the relator A (at the lower end of the chain of narrators). In this form of narration there is no certainty that the relator D had actually heard the Hadzzth directly from the Prophet or that each subsequent relator had actually heard the Hadz^tSt directly from his irnmediate predecessor.77 The Hadtth is termed misrepresented (mudallas) if one relator stated that he had heard the Hadzoth from a certain person where in fact he could not have met with that person and therefore could not have heard the HadxAth directly from him.78 The Hadfth is considered also as misrepresented if a relator, in order to give credit to his relation, gave a wrong information about the status or the name of the person from whom he had heard the Hadlth.79 72 as-Salih(a), 220. This Hadfth is called also mawsul, ibnus-Salah (a), 21. 73 as-Salih(a), 221. 74 as-Salih(a), 168; ibnus-Salih(a), 26-27. 75 at Tahhan, 75i ibnus-salah(a) 28- 76 ibnus-Salah(a), 138-139; as-Salih(a), 249; cf. an-Naisaburi, 30. 77 at-Tahhan, 86-87; ibnus-Sala_(a), 29.

This term describes a HadzSth which had been invented and falsely ascribed to the Prophet.83 The scholars of Hadzzth made extensive inquiries in order to detect the false stories which were propagated by unscrupulous liars. The forgery of the Hadlth is apparent where the subject matter of the Hadsoth is contrary to established historical evidence or to comrnon sense and decency or to the provisions of the Qur'an and authentic Sunnah. The HadtAth which contains an exaggerated punishment for a hated (makrah) action or an exaggerated reward for a recommendable (mandub) action is a forgery. The false HadzSth can also be recognised by its inelegant wording and poor style.84 The scholars of HadSh have rightly pointed out that the relators who narrated or propagated false Hadtlhs were swindlers and liars or, at best, extremely naive or inaccurate and reckless persons.85 The forgery of the Hadz^th can be deduced from any serious irregularity in its support, such as the fact that the person from whom the relator pretended that he had heard the HadAh had died before the birth of that relator.86 If the HadzAth was related by a person who was notoriously known as a liar in his dealings with people, the conclusion was drawn that the HadtAth was fabncated by that person.87 It is clear from the above that the knowledge of the persons who participated in the narration of Hadzoths was of considerable importance for the purpose of authenticating the true and valid HadzAlhs and distinguishing them from the fake and weak HadtlAs.

The first and second generanons belong to ie first century of Hidjrah. The generations from the third to dwe eighth belong to ie second century of Hidjrah. The generations from the ninth to the twelfth belong to ie iird century of Hidirah.88 In addiiion to de study of the generanons (tabaqat) of relators, the scholars of IIadIth gave pride of place to de study of the character and condition of each irldividual relator in order to know the relators who were just and accurate and the relators who were not just or accurate. This branch of the science of Hadz^th ('ilmul- HadzAth) was called by ie scholars woundng and authenticatirW (al-djarhu wat-ta'dz^I). A relator was considered as wounded (madirah) if there was a serious and well- bunded criticism against his character, integrity, reliability or trustworthmess. A relator was considered as just ('adE) if there was no proven serious objection to or criticism of his character, integrity, reliability or trustworthiness; but there must also be positive evidence in support of his good character.89 The process of irlvestigation and criticism by the scholars of Had2^th of the character and integrity of the relators was not confined to drawing general conclusions about the accuracy and justice of the relators, but was extended filrther to the exaniirlation of the actual state of the concemed relator at the time of receiving the Hadilh (tahammul) as well as at the time of relaying (ada') it to another person. The scholars thought that such factual examination was absolutely necessary in order to ensure that the person who received or propagated ic Had^th was not adversely affected or impaired, at that time) by old age, illness or any other exceptional circumstances or conditions. The scmtiny of the special circumstances or conditions of the reIators at the time of receiving or relaying the Hczdlths was termed the science of fi nding fauks (ilmut-tarlt) or more simply the science of faults (ilmul 'ilal) 90 88 al Rhasht, 23-24. 89 al-Khasht, 35; ibnus-Salih5a), 49-60. 90 'Awadain, 167-174; ibnus-Salih(a), 42-M; n. 82 supra, and its related text.</page><page sequence="25">172 ARAB LAW QUARTERLY The relevance of the numerical strength of the relators of Hadith The valid HadtAths are classified into two main categories according to the number of its relators in each generation: The successtse (mutawatir) Hadlth is the HadtAth which was related by a large mlmber of people in the generations of the Companions, the Successors, and the Successors of the Successors. The one-man HadtAth (khabarul-wa_id) is the HadxAth which was related by a small number of people in any of the generations of the Companions, the Successors, or the Successors of the Successors. The Hanafi school of jurisprudence added a third category which lies between the successive and the one-man Hadlths. If the HadtAth was related only by one Companion or by a small number of people in the generation of the Companions, but was transmitted afterwards by a large number of people in the generations of the Successors and the Successors of the Successors, thus becoming well-known (masAh2xr) or famous (mustafi^d), its rank should be higher than that of the one-man HadzAth and slightly lower than that of the successive Hadlth. As it is highly unlikely that a large number of people would conspire to tell false stories or reports about what the Prophet said, did or confirmed, the successive Hadzth, in view of its being supported by successive large numbers of people in the different generations, is accorded the highest degree of authenticity. Whereas the authenticity of the successive Hadlth can be considered as final, deEmitive or conclusive (qat'0, the authenticity of the one-man Hadith can only be considered as being supported by mere thought or presumption (zann), i.e., by the inference that trustworthy and reliable people, even ill small numbers, were unlikely to conspire to propagate false narrations about the sayings, actions and corlfirlllations of the Prophet. The authenticity of the Hanafi category of well-known or famous HadzAths is less than conclusive but more than presumptive. The reason is that the presumption of the authenticity of such HadzSth is based on its having been related by a Companion or by a small number of people in the generation of the Companions as well as on its having been corroborated by concurring reports by a large number of people belonging to the generations of the Successors and the Successors of the Successors.9l There is no consensus on what should constitute a large number of relators. The prevailing view fixes on the minimllm large number at ten.92 Some fix it at 313 men and two women on the analogy of the number of participants in the battle of Badr, in view of its historical relevance as the first battle fought and won by the Muslims against the Quraish. Others fix it at 70 on the analogy of 7 al-A'raf, 155, or at 50 on the analogy of the number of the faithful in 8 al-Anfal, 64, or at 20 on the analogy of 8 al-AnfXal, 65, or at 12 on the analogy of 5 al-MS'idah, 12, or at five on the analogy of 24 an-Nur, six-nine referring to the number of oaths to be sworn 91 Khallaf(b), 41-42; abu-Zahrah, 84-85. 92 at-Tahhan, 20. It is obviously difficult to set the figure of what consetutes a large number of relators. Some scholars say that the mixiimum figure required to constitute tawatur can only bc derided in the light of the prevailing custom at the time of the report in question, ash-Shiraz;, 295.</page><page sequence="26">REASONING IN ISLAMIC LAW: PART ONE 173 by the husband who accuses his wife of adultery, or at four on the analogy of 24 an- Nur, 13. Though all these views try to flnd support by analogy in some verses of ffie Qur'an (which refer to certain numbers for different purposes or on certain occasions) or irl some important historical events, it is evident that the said verses of the Qur'an and the number of the Muslim participants in the historical battle of Badr have in fact nothing to do with what should constinlte a large number for che particular purpose sf distinguishing between the one-man and the successire Had^ths.93 The large nurnber of relators should be made up of persons who were unlikely to conspire to fabricate or forge HadShs to achieve political or factional gains.94 The fact that the relators of the same HadEths belonged to different countries or ethnic groups or schools of law corroborates the inference that those HadzFths are auochentic.95 On the other hand, the relation of a HadaSth by a large number of people dispenses with the need to investigate the justice ('adlU) and accuracy (dabt) of each individual relator.96 The school of Hadith and the school of Ra'y (Opinion) Two main approaches were adopted by the jurisprudents in the early formative period of Islamic jurisprudence. While Malik and the jurisprudents of Madinah were very careful to found their opinions on Hadthths, abu-Hanifah and the scholars of Iraq were inclined to found their opinions on pure reason. In retrospect, it is now very difficult to assess the full implications of this basic difference of approach as there has always been, in the course of time, extensive exchange of views and ideas among the jurisprudents belonging to the two schools. The two schools in principle admitted the binding authority of the valid HadShs, whether murawatir (successive), mashhur (famed) or ahad (one-man). The difference between the two schools relates to the conditions for accepting the one- man Hadxths. The school of Hadiih does not accept a one-man Hadzoths unless it is consistent WIth lhe practice of lhe people of Madl^nah (amaZu ahlil-Madlonah). Malik believed that such practice was more expressive of the authentic Sunnah of the Prophet than the reports by a small nurnber of persons) as the Prophet and many Companions lived in Madlnah for many years.97 The school of raXy does not accept the reports by one person or by a small number of persons in the first generation unless these reports became famed in ie following generations or satisfied certain supplementary conditions: (1) l7he one-man HadSh should be consistent with e Qur'an, the successive or well-known or famed HadShs or with the general principles derived from any of these sources. 93 al-Khasht 53-54. 94 at-Tahhan 20 n 2 95 Id- ' 96 al-Khasht, 54. Djadul-Haqq(a), 43.</page><page sequence="27">174 ARAB LAW QUARTERLY For example, abu-Hanifah refilsed to accept the one-man Hadlth related by abu-Hurairah: "The buyer of an animal which has not been miLked for some time (mustarrah) has the option to retum it with a plateful of dates (as compensation to the seller)". This Hadzth deals with the case of a buyer who is deceived by the appearance of a sheep or camel as a good producer of milk and ien discovers, after delivery, that such appearce was created by the seller's deliberate refrainmg from milking the animal for some time before offering it for sale. The Hanafis argue that the capacity of an anunal to produce a large amount of milk is IlOt an implied condiiion and that the buyer is entitled at any rate to keep the actual amount of miLk produced by the animal he bought, as such milk is a natural product of the thing whose property becarne vested in him on sale. Even if it was conceded that the buyer should compensate the seller for his loss resulting from the buyer's exercise of his option to retum the animal, such compensation should be, in view of the nature of milk as a fungible thing, an in-kind compensation (in the form of de same arnount of milk) and not in the form of dates (or wheat, as per another version of the Hadlth). In support of their opinion, the Hanafis adduced two proofs (adillah): (a) the Hada^th which states that the benefit of the thing accrues to the person who bears its risk and responsibility (al-kharadju bid-daman); and (b) the Qur'anic principle of equal reciprocity (tit for tat) as stated in 2 al- Baqarah, 194. The _anafis concluded that the buyer of an animal which had not been milked for some time (musarrah) was entitled only to recover the excess resulting from the difference between its market or real value and the price he paid for it to the seller.98 (2) The provision of the Sunnah contained in a one-man Had^th should not be contradicted by the aciion or practice of its relator. Such contradictory action can be considered as a presumpiion that the relator becarne aware of a reason, argument, or proof in support of his acton or practice. Thus abu- Hanlfah declined to accept the HadBh re}ated by 'A'ishah: "(There shall be) no marriage (nikah) without the consent of the guardian (waliy)" on the ground that CA'ishah herself contradicted this HadSh when she arranged the marriage of her nephew _aSsah without the prior consent of HafRah's father 'abdur-Rahnian. (3) The olle-man Hadxth should not be denied by any one of its relators. Sulaiman ibn Musa reported, taking his report from ('an) az-Zuhr; who took it from 'Urwah who took it from 'A'ishah, that the Prophet had said: "The marriage of any woman without the consent (idhn) of her guardian (waliy) shall be null (batil)". When ibn Djuraih asked az-Zuhri about this report) az-Zuhrl's answer was that he had no knowledge of it. abu-Hanifah rejected Madub, 97; cf.

(4) The subject-matter of a one-man HadI^th should not relate to a matter of general public concern (fima ta'ummu fzZil-balwa). abu-Han^lfah remarked that it was highly improbable that a HadEth of the Prophet on a matter of importance to people at large could remain known only within the circle of a small number of people. Usually, the Prophet in matters of public or general importance would talk to as many people as possible, so that what he said might well be known to all.99 Historically, it was the founder of the Sh;afi'; school of law, Muhammad ibn Idris ash-Shafi';, who seriously attempted to and largely succeeded in bridgmg the gap between the school of Hadtzth and the school of opinio?z (ra'y). In his major book, ar-Risalah, ash-Shafi'; brought method and consistency to the school of Hadlth and demonstrated that there shouId be no inconsistency between opinion and Hadfih as each, by its very nature, has its own specific sphere.lÂ°Â° ash-Shafi'l's method of reconciling the contradictory Hadiths The meanings of most valid Hadz^ths are secure or firmly sertled (mahkamah) in the sense that they are not contradicted by the Qur'an or by other HadShs. ash-Shafi'; said that in case of contradictory (makhtalifah) Had2^ths, the main concern should be to reconcile ieir contradictory meanings. Failing this, the Hadlth uttered on the later date should be preferred, in as much as it could be considered as repealing or varying the Hadzth uttered on the earlier date. If there was no evidence showing which one of the contradictory Had*hs was the latest in terrns of chronology, then all the circurnstances relating to each Hadlth, such as the number, character and status of its relators, the formula indicating how it was received (tahammul) and relayed (ada), the extent of its conformity with other provisions of the Qur'an and other Hadlths, shouId be weighed very carefillly.

"But no, by your Lord, they will not believe until they make you settle their disputes and think that there is no hardship in your decisions and submit to them in filll'' (4 an-Nisa', 65). The work of the scholars of HadtAth complements the work of the jurisprudents, and vice-versa. Once the scholars of Hadtoth reach the conclusion (whether certain and final in the case of successive Had1lhs, or presumptive and tentative in the case of one-man Hadxths) that a certain Hadzzth is rightly traceable to the Prophet, it will be incumbent upon the jurisprudents to interpret that Hadlth and put it in its right context within the frnmework of the rules, principles and ends of the SharlNah.l03 The majority of jurisprudents (djumAur) are of the opinion that the one-man Had2^ths are not considered as authority in matters of faith, as these matters should be supported by such definitive or conclusive proofs (adillak qat'iyyah) as those furnished by the Qur'an and successive Hadlths and could not be supported by the presumptive proofs (adillah zannEyyah) furnished by the one-man HadtAths. Faith can only be based on certainty which is lacking in one-man HadtAths.l04 4. JURISPRUDENCE OF THE QUR'AN AND THE SUNNAH Jurisprudence and its foundations The real task of the jurisprudent does not end at the establishing of the authenticity of the texts of the Qur'an and the Sunnah. These texts need to be properly urlderstood and applied in accordance with certain principles based on the knowledge of the Arabic language and the general ends and purposes of the SharRah (the protection of: religion, life, reason, progeny and property). This has always been clear in respect of the Qur'an; in fact many interpreters of the Qur'an as, for example, al-Djassas and ibnul-'Arabi, focused their attention on the explanation of the legal verses of the Qur'm (Ahkam-ul-Qur'an). In theory the same need has always been recognised in respect of the texts of the Sllnnah. In practice however, in view of the practical difficulty of referring simulta- neously to all the different compilations of HadtAths, there is still a probability to fall into the trap of relying on certain texts of the Sunnah without giving due attention to its other relevant texts or even to the Qur'anic texts or to the relevant general principles and ends of the ShartNah. The texts of the Qur' and che 103 Khallaf(b), 43; ash-Shawkarii(a), 29, states that it iS religious necessity tO recognise the authority of the Sunnah as an independent source of legal provisions, cf. also, al-Bim, 41. 104 Hl^tU, 305; abu-Zahrah, 85.</page><page sequence="30">REASONING IN ISLAMIC LAW: PART ONE 177 Sunnah are one whole; no text can be filly understood in isolation from the other relevant texts. This integrative approach for the study of the texts is the cornerstone of the science of jurisprudence ('ilmul-fiqh) and its sister science of foundations of jurisprudence ('ilmu usulil-fiqh). No wonder that the two sciences are closely interrelated to each other, though in theory each has its own independent domain. The science of jurisprudence means the acquired knowledge of the practical legal provisions as deducted from their detailed proofs or sources. The word acquired excludes the knowledge of legal provisions by the Angel Gabriel and the Prophet Muhammad.l05 The science of follndations of jurisprudence means the knowledge of the prirlciples of deducting the practical legal provisions from their detailed proofs or sources.l06 The epithets practical and legal in these two definitions indicate that belief and faith (i'tiqadWyyat: dogmatics) and scientific knowledge acquired by reason, experience or senses, are distinct from the sciences of jurisprudence and follndations of jurisprudence.l07 Though the word fiqh, which literally means understanding, bears a striking similarity to the Latin word jurisprudentia, it is remarkable that the Romans never perfected a science of law.l08 It is therefore highly speculative and utterly without solid proofs to claim that the Mllslim jurisprudents in the countries which were part of the Roman and the Byzantine Empires were influenced by Roman law in the pursuit of their scientific and systematic elaboration and development of the sciences of jurisprudence and foundations of jurisprudence.l09 The Qur'an and the Sunnah: the primary and ultimate sources of jurisprudence The Qur'm and the Sllnnah are the only (exclusive) primary and ultimate sources of jurisprudence. All other sources are based, directly or indirectly, on these two basic proofs or sources.llÂ° Understanding or fiqh of the revealed texts of the Qur'an and of the God inspired lO5 H1X 26; cf.

Obviously, the exclusions referred to in the text relating tO n. 105-107 are for the purpose of definitions only and do not mean that de excluded types of knowledge are not relevant for both sciences. 108 Cf. Dias, 2, n. 1: "Ulpian's remark in the Digest, quoted as the opening of Justinian's Institutes: 'junsprudentia est divirzarum arque humanarum notitia, justi atqzle inj2fsti scienha' (D. 1. 10. 2; Inst. 1.1.1: jurisprudence is the concept of things divine and human, knowledge of the just and the unjust), was only a piece of rhetoric not pursued by the Romans". 109 Cf. 'abdul-Haniid, 43-99, for a detailed discussion of the historical relations between Islamic jurisprudence and Roman law and the allegations by some Orientalists (Goldziher and Schacht) that Islaniic jurisprudence was in fact influenced by Roznan law and the denial by some other Orientalists (Nallino and Fitzgerald) and by some modern Muslim comparative lawyers ('abdul-Mun'im al-Badrawi and Sfifi abu-Tilib) of such allegations. Some writers believe that the truth probably lies somewhere in the niiddle, but concede that there was no conscious and methodical renepeon of foreign legal insiitutions during the formative period of Islamic jurisprudence, Liebesny, 32-34. 110 abu-Zahrah, 58.</page><page sequence="31">178 ARAB LAW QUARTERLY Sllnnsh depends on reason ('aql). The Muslim philosophers (falastifah) and scholastic theologians (mutakallimun) thought that reason was part of the SharNah and consequently ranked reason as the first and primordial source to be depended upon in the process of deducting or ascertsining the legal rulings and concluded that any criticism of the ability of reason to deduct md then apply the legal provisions would be equivalent to a criticism of the SharRah itself. The jurisprudents rejected this view and argued that reason should be considered as a mere means to know the Shansah.lll In the Hadzoth of Mu'a&amp;, the Prophet corlfirmed de use of reason as a means to know the legal provisions to be applied to cases IlOt covered by de texts of the Qur'an and the Sunnah: It is reported that when the Prophet sent Mu'adh ibn Djabal to act as judge in Yemen, he av,ked him: "How will you adjudge the cases brought before you?" Mu'adh answered that he would apply the Book of God (the Qur'arl). The Prophet asked again: "And how will you adjudge if you do not fmd an applicable provision in the Book of God?" Mu'adh answered that he would apply the Sunnah of the Prophet. Then the Prophet further inquired: "And how will you adjudge if you do not find an applicable provision in the Sunrlah of the Prophet?" Mu'adh answered that he would exert his best efforts to forrn an opinion. The Prophet's COIlflRmirlg comment was: "Thank God that the emissary (Mu'a&amp;) of God's Messenger found the nght answers to the satisfaciion of God's eniissary.l'2 This Hadlth of Mu'adh is the basis of the distinction between the transmitted sources (masaAdir naglEyyah), represented by the Qur'an and the Sunnah, and the other subsidiary sources derived from reason (masadir 'aglEyyah). This distinction is not meant to exclude the use of reason in respect of the transmitted sources, but to serve to identify the legal provisions which are directly deduced from the Qur'an and the Sunnah and to distinguish them from the legal provisions which are indirectly based on these two sources. Semantics (al-mabahilhal-lafziyyah) are as important in respect of Fe transmitted sources as they are iIl respect of the sources dependent on reason. It is obvious that reason plays an important part in deciding such matters as whether the meaning of a text (nass7 of the Qur'an or the Sunnah is definilive (qatl) or specalative (zannz^); general ('amm) or restricted (makhassas7; absolute (mutlaq) or qualified (muqaWyadS); broad (mudimal) or derailed (mufas- sar).ll3 Reason however has its own lirxiits and cannot be entirely relied upon in the regulation of human affairs; guidance and directions should always be sought from the revealed texts of e Qur'an and the Sllnnth:ll4 al r)jullainid) 60 2 al-Qa(b), 104; ash-Shawkini(c), 412; Isma'il, 316. 13 al_MaWardi@) 1, 282- 114 W.

Irnitators (muqallidun) are sinners because they do not make use of a gift given to them by God. Texts are esserltial, because the intellect, being a part of the IJniverse and existence, cannot by itself undersd or fully grasp all the realities of life and existence. But the texts should be understood and applied through the use of one's own intellect. In other words, the texts, once authenticated and confirrned as fog part of the Qur'an or the Sllnnsh of the Prophet, should be properly understood and interpreted.lls The role of reason in the assessment of change of circumstances Reason is not only the means to check the audenticity and deterrnine the exact meaning of e text, but it is also the means to detennine the circurnstances in which the texts should be applied. It is well settled that any legal opmion (fatwa) should be developed) varied or adapted in the light of changing conditions and circumstances at different times and in different places. This fundamental principle is as old as the early formative period of islamic jurisprudence.ll6 The second rightly-guided Caliph 'Umar is well known for his method of giving due consideration to changes of circumstances. For example, he saw no point in continuing the practice of giving money or material benefits to those whose hesrts are to be conciliated (9 at-Tawbah, 60) because he believed that there was no need, after the spread of Islam in the Arabian peninsula, to gain new sympathisers through such practice.ll7 'Umar also took the decision, after consulting with the Companions, not to distribute the arable lands of Iraq arnong the Muslim soldiers who participated m the conquest of that country. 'Umar argued that the non- conr. are effectively checked by well-defined and widely accepted social values, al-Biblawi, 132-134; ct. al- Kawakbi, 11, 40-50. t5 an-Nabhan(a), 60. Man should not be discouraged by the proliferation of opposing views on the interpretation of revealed texts or by the errors in the use of his own reason. ". . . (O)ut of the atiiion of diverse minds there is beaten something which has a constancy and uniforIxiity and average lralue greater than its component elements.... The flaws are there as in every human insiituiion. Because they are not only there but visible, we have faith at they will be corrected. There is no assurance that the rule of the majority will be the expression of perfect reason when embodied in constitution or in statute. We ought not to expect more of it when eInbodied in the judgrnents of the courts. The tide nses and falls, but the sands of error crurnbles", Cardozo, 177. "The work of a judge is in de one sense enduring and in another sense ephemeral What is good in it endures. What is erroneous is pretty sure to perish. The good remains the foundaiion on which new structures will be built. The bad will be rejected and cast off in the laboratory of the years", id., 178. "I sometimes t that we worry ourselves over-much about the enduring consequences of our errors. They may work a little confusion at a time.

The future takes care of such things In the endless process of testing and reteseng, there is a constant rejection of the dross, and a constant retenton of whatever is pure and sound and fine.", id., 179. The Qur'an gives assurance that the good shall renzair and that the bad shall perish. "He (God) sends out of heaven svater, and the wdd* (Â¢hannels) flow each in its measure, and the torrent carries a swelling scum; and out of that ourer which they kindle fire, being desirous of ornawnent or ware, out of that rises a scllm the like of it. So God strikes (a similitude of) both the true and the false. As for the scum, it vanishes as jetsam, and what profits men abides in the earth. Even so, God strikes His sirriilitudes" (13 ar-Ra'd, 17, Arberry, 241). 116 al-Qaradaw;(a), 82. 117 ibnul-'Arab;, 966; ash-Sharqawl, 33</page><page sequence="33">180 ARAB LAW QUARTERLY distribuiion of those lands would ensure irt the long run the eaming by che treasury (baitul-mal) of a renewed income in che form of ie taxes which could be levied on the native holders of those lands.ll8 'Umar was also known for his firm stand on considering the repudianon (talaq) pronounced thrice at one time as thrice valid, not only as once valid as was the prevailing view, in order to discourage people from pronouncing thrice divorce lightly or without careful thought.ll9 Even m matters of ritual worship ('ibadat) the conditions prevailirlg in certain places should be taken into accourlt. For example, many scholars say that the Muslims living in the places which do not have a daily sunrise and a daily sunset should perform every 24 hours the five daily prayers and should fast and break the fast during the holy month of Ramadan according to the iimes of prayers and the times of fasiing and breaking the fast in the nearest place which has a daily sunrise and a daily sunset.l20 The importance of legal mterpretation of the Sunnsh The readers of the Qur'an can rely on the help of different kinds of interpretations, ranging from the short (such as TafsxArul-Djalalain) to the expanded and lengthy (such as TaSslrul-Qurtubi or TafsX^N ibn Kalhir). The readers of Hadzhths have also a very wide range of books dealing with de interpretation of Hadtoths, but in view of the large number of HadxAths, there is a real danger for the unwary to Iliisquote or to misunderstand them: The work of junsprudents is, m faet, m irldispensable complement to the work of the seholars of Hadtths; the forrner guards the Sunnah aganst the consequenees of inadvertence or earelessness.l2l . . . Our eorleem as jurisprudents is to draw the atteniion of the scholars of Had*hs to the relevant words and meanings of the Qur'an. In fact many scholars of Hadiths do not give due eonsideraiion to che study of the Qur'an. They divert their attention to other maners and dus end up fmdiIlg themselves ineapable of understanding the proper meaning Of revelaton (waty). The method of work of a verifying jsprudent (mu}zaqqiq) who has to fmd a legal provision applicable to a certain matter consists in collecong all the relevarlt matenal available in the Qur'an or the Smnah, verifying the presurnpiive provisiorls by comparing them with the conclusive provisiorls anbd reconaling and rarlking the different prooEs.

In fact, both groups, the jurisprudents and the scholars of Hadlth, are in need of each other. There can be no junsprudence without the Sunnah and there can be no science of Hadlth without the science of jurisprudence. The greatness of Islam can be attained through the close cooperation between the scholars of these two sciences. The trouble starts when the two groups ipore each other; it will become even worse if they allow obstinacy and lack of vision to intervene in their work.l22 We have already seen that the scholars of HadSh have spared no effort to exarnine the contents of HadzFths to ensure that they are correctly categorised and ranked. The purpose of the above passage is to draw the attention to the importance of continuing co-operation between the scholars of HadtAth and the jurisprudents in the form of exchange of information, as well as to the importance of mutually acknowledging the nature and limits of competence of each group.l23 Change of circumstances and Hadi^th Change of circumstances, prevailing customs or conditions should be taken into consideration in order to avoid the distortion and misapplication of the Sunnah. Closely related to the change of circumstances is the question of determining whether the HadzAth was uttered by the Prophet in his capacity as legislator or in his capacity as an ordinary hurnan being. It is always possible to differ in the assessment of change of circumstances as well as in the determination of the capacity in which the Prophet uttered the HadzAth. This gives jurisprudents the opportunity to weigh the different views and choose from them the one which is more in line with the provisions, aims and principles of the SharzNah. The following illustrations show the impact of change of circumstances on deducting legal rules and guidelines from Hadtoths: (1) The scholars expressed the opinion that the HadSh which forbade any woman to travel alone and required that she should be accompanied in her travels by her husband or by any man from among her relatives within the prohibited degree of relationship, such as her father, son, brother, uncle, was based on the then prevailing unsafe conditions of travel and aimed at erlsuring the protection and safety of travelling women. The jurisprudents then stated that if travel is safe, the woman can travel alone or in the company of other women; de Hadfth applies only if the travel is unsafe.l24 (2) When the Prophet was asked how stray camels should be disposed of, he answered that they should be left (unattended) until they were picked up by their owners. The Prophet based his answer on his knowledge gained through his own personal experience that camels, if left on their own, Id., 24-25.

But when later on many persons complained that they were llnable to recover the possession of their stray camels, the third rightly-guided Caliph 'Uthman ibn 'Affan decreed that stray camels should be picked up and attended to until they were claimed back by their rightful owners.l25 (3) A HadxAth of the Prophet stipulated that blood money (diyah) should be paid by the supporters or protectors ('aAqilah) of the wrongdoer. In the beginning, the term supporters was interpreted to mean the kin of the wrongdoer. As an increasing number of people had to do their military service in faraway lands, the word supporters was given a new additional meaning: the army unit (djund) to which the wrongdoer belonged.l26 (4) The Prophet is reported to have said that the barren land (mawat) belongs to the person who first cultivates it. The Maliki and Shafi'; jurisprudents interpreted this Hadzzth to mean that the ownership of the barren land could be acquired through first cultivation without any further requirement or condition. The HanafF jurisprudents said that the Hadlth was uttered by the Prophet in his capacity as leader of the community of Muslims and concluded that the acquisition of the ownership of the barren land through first cultivation cannot be completed without the permission of the competent auchority.l27 (5) It is a widespread custom among the Muslims to save a portion of the meat of the animals slaughtered on the occasion of the Feast of SacriElce ('Idul- Ad'ha). In a year of penury and famine, the Prophet said that no sacrifice meat should be saved. When the conditions were back to norrnal, the Prophet said that people could consume, give out as charity, or save the sacrifice meat as they pleased.l28 (6) The Prophet said: "Fever is a breath of hell; cool it by water". rhe jurisprudents remarked that this Had^th took into consideration the rather hot and warm climate of Makkah and Madinah and the fact that many kinds of fever in these two places were caused by excessive heat The jurisprudents concluded that the Hadtzth was applicable to other places of similar climate, but not to other places of cool or cold climate. 129 (7) In his instructions to Mu'adh, his emissary to Yemen, the Prophet fixed the rate of poll-tax (djiziah) to be levied at one di^nar per person. 'Umar ibnul-Khattab, the second rightly-guided Caliph, saw the difference between zakah (alms-tax), which as a religious obligation should have a 125 al-Qaradawl(c), 143-144; al-Miliki, 135-136. 126 al-Qaradawi(c), 145-146; al-Qunawi, 296.

He accordingly adopted a system of flexible rates for djiziah ranging from a minimum of 12 dirhams to a maximum of 48 dirhams.l30 (8) The Prophet declined to accept the proposal made by some of his Companions to set the prices of certain items. He is reported to have said: "It is God who sets the prices; it is He who causes abundance and penury". The Prophet then added: "I do not wish to meet God while I am burdened with the grievance of anyone". The jurisprudents interpreted this Hadzth to mean that it is not permissible for the ruler or the government of the day to set the prices of any goods or commodities in an arbitrary manner by intervening in the interplay of normal supply and norrnal demand. On the other hand, the jurisprudents asserted that it is the duty of the Ruler or the government to intervene to prevent any manipulation or speculation by greedy traders who, for the sake of making excessive profits, cause, through the use of artiElcial methods, any kind of disruption in the normal supply and demand, for example, by storing for a long period a certain merchandise and thus tighten its supply and provoke a rise in its price.l3l (9) The provisions of certain Hadl^ths were made assuming the prevalence of a certain custom, usage, or practice. For example, the Hadzhth purporting to prevent usury (riba) by the prohibition of any disparity of weight in the exchange of gold and silver and of any disparity of measure in the excharlge of dates, barley, wheat and salt took into consideration that gold and silver were exchanged or sold by weight and that dates, barley, wheat and salt were exchanged or sold by measure. abu-Hanifah expressed the view that the parity (ramathul) of gold and silver should always be assessed on the basis of weight and the parity of dates, barley, wheat and salt should always be assessed on the basis of measure. The Hanafi jurisprudent abu-Yusuf expressed a different view. He said that the reference in the HadzFth to weight in respect of gold and silver and to measure in respect of dates, barley, wheat and salt was only a reflection of the prevailing practice in the market at the time of the Hadtzth. If a change of practice occurs and people prefer to deal in dates, for exarnple, by weight rather than by measure, parity will be deemed to exist between two similar weights of dates.l32 (10) The Hadlth which stipulated that the leaders (a'immah) of the nation should be chosen from among the Quraish was understood by the majority of the Sunnl jurisprudents as a reflection of the dominant position of the 130 al-Qaradawi(c), 147-148; id. (d), 62; al-Djassas: 3, 98. The Hanafls adopt the opinion of 'Umar. The Shifi'ls said the rate of the tax should not fall below one dinar. The Malikis expressed the opinion that the Ruler should have discretion in fixing the rate of the tax, Khallaf(a), 120-121. 131 al-Qaradawi(c), 152-153; az-Zuhail;(a): 3,588-590; ash-Shukairi, 95; an-Nabhan(c), 380 et seg,; cg.

The jurisprudents therefore laid down the principle that what really mattered was that the leaders should have sufficient prestige, power and ascendancy so that they niight be able to lead the nation without friction or serious challenge by others.l33 (11) The Umaiyad Caliph 'Umar ibn 'abdil-'Aziz who was well known for his piety, justice and strict adhereIlce to the teachings of the Shar2tah, was of the opinion that the Prophet's prohibition of writing the Had1^lhs was based on the concem that people might easily confuse the Qur'an with the Sllnnsh, if both were allowed to be recorded in writing at the same time. On the basis of this 1lnderstanding 'Umar ibrl 'abdil-'Aziz drew the logical conclusion that, after the completion of the writing down of the Qur'an and its editing in the form of the ' Uthmant Muswhaf which in due course became well known and duly accepted as authoritative by all the Muslims, there was indeed no harm at all in starting the work of recording the Sunnah in writing. This opinion of 'Umar ibn 'abd-il-'Aziz was accepted and acted upon by the narrators of HadiYhs.l34 (12) Sometimes the change of circumstances was not assessed with due regard to its proper context. The Prophet was reported to have said: "Do not prevent women (who wish to worship God in mosques) from going to mosques". A few years later, as-Saiyidah 'A'ishah, was reported to have said: "If the Prophet had lived to this day to see the behaviour of women, he would certainly have prevented them from going out to mosques". Though this view of as-Saiyidah 'A'ishah was objected to by such a venerable Companion (SahabS) as ibn 'Umar, the freedom of women to go to mosques, or indeed to any other place, was severely curtailed. This result was due to the failure of the jurisprudents to put the words of as- Saiyidah 'A'ishah in their proper context. They failed to see that as- Saiyidah 'A'ishah intended no more than expressing her strong dissatisfac- tion wich the behaviour and conduct of certain women during the period which followed the death of the Prophet. It is remarkable that nowadays a very lirnited number of women go to mosques regularly or at all ffiough the principle that they should be allowed to go to mosques has been fully restored. 135 33 al-Qaradawi(c), 140-141; Khallif(a), 28-29, 57-58; Rosenthal, 29-30. al-Qaradaw;(c), 143-144; cf. abdul-Khaliq, 430 et seq., ciong certain reports that the Prophet himself had given permission to some persons to write his Hadiths. 135 al-Qaradaw;(c), 153-154.

THE sussIDIARY SOURCES OF JURISPRUDENCE The need for subsidiary sources Each event (hadithah, nazilah) is subject to a legal (sharrz9) provision (h2xkm). As the events are limitless and the texts (nususi) of the Qur'an and the Sunnah are limited, the subsidiary sources are essential for determining the legal provisions applicable to new events. The most important subsidiary sources accepted by most scholars are the following: consensus of opinion (idjma'); reasoning by analogy (qzyas); equitable discretion (istihsan); interest (mastlahah); ways and strategems (saddudh-dhara^'i); custom and usage ('urf wa 'adah); opinions of the Companions (aqwa^las-Sahabah); preceding revelations (shar'u man qablana) arld presumption of continuance (ististhabul-hal) . Consensus of Opinion (IdjmaC) Consensus of Opinion (Idima') means the unanimous agreement, after the death of the Prophet, of all the learned scholars having the capacity of independent and original legal reasoning or thinking (mudjtahidun) or of all the people having the power to loosen and bind (ahl?ll-hallf wal-'aqdS), i.e., the leading personalities having the power of decision-making, on any matter of religion or worldly affairs. The consensus thus reached cannot be varied or repeaIed by a subsequent consensus. The possibility of an agreement of all the jurisprudents of any historical period is not easy to materialise. Some scholars say that the only possible consensus of opinion was the consensus of the Companions of the Prophet l36 Some others say that even in the generations of the Companions there had never been an agreement of all the Companions on any certain question: Has there ever been an agreement of opinion of all the muditahidoin after the death of the Prophet? The answer is no. A review of the events upon which the Companions forrned unnnimous opinions shows that those opinions were expressed by the Companions who were present and who were consulted about those events. The truth is that the real charactenstic of such opinions which distinpsh them from other jurisprudeniial opinions, is that they express the outcome of consultation and not the view of an individual.l37 Furtherrnore, since consensus of opinion should be based on a proof (dalzl),l38 such proof may either be conclusive (qatvz8), and ill such case iere is no need for consensus of opinion to give to it more weight (as such proofs are the weightiest proofs), or merely presumpiive (zannS) and in such case it is highly improbable that all the mudjtahidun would agree on it.l39 136 M.

For example, the prohibition of drinking wine (khamr) prescribed by 2 al- Baqarah, 219 and 5 al-Ma'i dah, 90, is extended by analogy to the drinking of any alcoholic drink, such as whisky and beer, on the ground that all these drinks cause irltoxication. 14O The analysis of deduction by analogy shows that it comprises fbur elements: (1) The principal event (drinking wine); (2) The derived event (dnnking beer or whisky); (3) The legal provision applicable to the principal event (prohibition); and (4) The cause which is comrnon to the principal event and the derived event (intoxication or scupefaction) 141 Equitable discretion (Istihsan) Equitable discreiion (istiAsan) means the application of jtldicious discretion to exclude the application of a certain rule, established by analogy or by a text, to a certain situation or event, on the ground that such application would lead tO injusuce or hardship.l42 For example, it could be inferred from the texts relating to succession that the wife who has been repudiated irrevocably (talqaran ba'inah) during the terrninal illness of her husband, is not eniitled to a legal share in his inheritance. But as this result is too harsh for the repudiated woman, the majority of jurisprudents (of the HanafX, Malikl and Hanbal; schools) give to her, on ie ground of istiAsan, a share iIl the estate of her former husband provided, according to the Hanafis, he dies during the waitiIlg period ('addah) or provided, according to the HanbalIs) she does not remarry.

As a source of legal rules, ways and means (dhara'i') mean that a means shall be lawful if it produces a Iawfil (halal) result and that it shall be unlawil if it produces an unlawfill (haram) result. The criterion for judging the means is objective; what matters is that the means used will, in the normal circumstances, lead to a certain result. For example, the Qur'an prohibits the Muslims from abusing idols, as such behaviour may trigger a reciprocal abuse of God by the idolators (6 al-An'am, 108).145 The good intentions of the person who uses a means which nollllally leads to unlawful results are irrelevant in assessing this means. In the exanple just cited, the believers who attack the worship of idols and the idols themselves may do this m complete good faith and with 1:he good intention, from their own point of view, of showing their deference to God, but they should refrain from doing so if such attack should provoke a veIlgeance by the idolators. 144 KhaIlif(b), 8s85; 'A. an-Nimr, 121; al-B;rrl, I48.

If it is clear that in the normal circumstances it should not lead to the unlawful result, the means should be considered as lawfill and permissible. For example, cultivation of grapes is a step towards making wine, but it is lawful and permissible to cultivate grapes, because, in the normal circumstances, grapes are not necessarily cultivated for the exclusive purpose of making wine.l46 0n the other hand, the sale of grapes, though lawful in itself, will be considered as unlawful if the sale is made to a wine merchant or manufacturer. Here the good intention of the seller is immaterial: it is normal that the wine merchant or manufacturer will use de grapes to produce or sell wine.l47 The intention of the users of means to achieve certain results is relevant in certain cases which are discussed by the jurisprudents under the heading of legal fictions or stralagems tiyal). Hiyal is the plural of hl7ah and is derived from tahazvwal. Ht?ah is a certain kind of transaction or aciion which means the transformation (tahauszvul) from one condition (hal) to another. Then by usage ht?ah came to designate the subtle means used to achieve a certain purpose. If the purpose is lawil, the hilah is lawfil. If the purpose is unlawil, the hlGah is unlawful. If the word hilah is used without qualification, it means the method of making halal (lawil) what is irl fact haram (unlawi1).148 Some scholars say that the essence of hz?ah is the creation of a lawful appearance to achieve a concealed unlawfill purpose.l49 Very close to this view is the view of ash-Shatib; who says that the hzSlah consists in perforrning an act which is apparently lawful for the purpose of transforming a certain legal provision (in appearance only and not in reality) into a different legal provision. The actual result will be the non-application of a legal provision which otherwise would have been applicable. An example of htlah is the making of a donation by a person at the beginning of the year to evade the payment of zakah (alrns-tax). Donation is certainly permissible and lawful and so is the non-payrnent of zakaAh when its conditions are not met. But if the donation and the non-payment of zakaAh are combined together within the scheme of evading the payment of the zakah, it becomes apparent that the benefit of donation does not outweigh the detriment of non-payment of zakah.l50 The lawfil hiyal may be divided into two main categories according to whether they raise or do not raise any doubts about their lawfi ess. The first category comprises the arrangements adopted for the purpose of proteciing a lawful iIlterest or right or redressing an injustice or alleviating or removirlg an undue hardship. This category of hiyal is pessible because it does not contradict any interest or right protected by the Shar:&lt;ah.l5 146 Id., 230. 147 sabdlll-Hamld, 232. 148 ibnul-Qaiyim(a): 3, 240-241; ibn Taimiyyah: 3, 190-192. 149 ibnul-Qaiyim(a): 3) 335- 50 aSh Sh5.tibi: 2, 379- 151 ibnul-Qaiyim(a): 3, 337.

Examples of these obligations and prohibitions are the obligation to pay the zakah; the obligation to fulfil the expiation penalties (kaffarat); the obligation to fulfil vows (nudhur); the obligation of the seller of real property to grant his neighbour the first opportunity to buy it (preemption: shufah); the prohibition to use spoiled property or stolen things and the prohibition to remarry the same person after three repudiations. If the person to whom the obligation or prohibition applies (makallaf) interferes with the case of the obligation or prohibition with the intention of relieving himself from the performance of the obligation or the observance of the prohibition, he will be considered as culpable of using a hfilah. ash-Shatib; cites in this connection the examples of the person who travels only for the purpose of reducing the number of the rak'ahs (bowings) of the noon, afternoon and night prayers and of the person who eludes the prohibition of charging interest on lending money through a sham trsnsaction consisting in concluding an agreement with the borrower whereby the borrower seIls to the lender a certain thing at a certain price to be paid immediately by the lender, and then the lender sells the same thing to the borrower at a higher price to be repaid by the borrower at a certain filture date.l52 The differerlces of the scholars in respect of the use of hiyal are all related to the second category of hiyal, i.e., the hiyal which are not conducive to the vindication of a right or the redress of an injustice. Two basic trends are noticeable:l53 (1) The first trend, represented by the Hanaftls and the majority of the Shafi'ls, maintains that if the intention of USiIlg the hllah is to avoid expressly the effect of a legal rule, the hx7ah will be lawful. For example, the majority of jurisprudents are of the opinion that a bequest to one of the heirs is unenforceable unless it is ratified by all the other heirs. On the basis of this opinion, the Hanafis say that an acknowledgment (iqrar) by a debtor of a debt of one of his heirs, made during the terminal illness of the former, shall be unenforceable unless and until it is ratified by all the other heirs. In order to dispense with the necessity of such ratification, the debtor can mSe a fictitious acknowl- edgment of debt in favour of a stranger who should agree in advance to repay the anourlt of the debt to the real creditor upon receipt of such amount from the estate of the debtor. cont. Law no. 100, 1985 giving the first wife the right to seek divorce for harm in case her husband takes a second wife does not contradict the permissibility of taking a second wife and is not viewed as a means (dharfrah) leading to an unlawful result (hardm) or to the fulfilment of a specific purpose imbued with or related to sin (ithm). 152 ash-Shaiib;: 2 379-380 153 'U i (t X</page><page sequence="43">190 ARAB LAW QUARTERLY (2) The second trend, represented by the Malikis and Hanbalis and some Shifi'is, maintains that this kind of hiyal is not permissible. It is noticeable that ash-Shafi'i, in line with his method of preferring to rely upon objective criteria rather than to uphold subjective inclinations, adhered to this trend.l54 The Shafi'ls who dissociated themselves from the view of their eniinent master were obviously under a very strong Hanafi influence. It was precisely to resist such strong influence that prompted the Hanbali jurisprudent ibnul-Qaiyim to launch a fierce attack on all the persons who indulge in the use of this kind of hiyal.l55 The arguinents of the first trend are as follows: (1) Hiyal have been mentioned in the Qur'an. God said to His Prophet Aiyiib: "Take in your hand a bllndle of thin grass and strike with it and do not break your vow. We found hirn (Aiyub), patient and excellent devotee ('abc[), always returning (to Us) iIl repentance (awzvab)" (38 Sad, 44). From this verse it could be deduced that God has permitted His Prophet Aiyub to get round his vow of striking his wife by the use of a bundle of herbs or straws (dighth) as an instrument for striking. Thus in appearance Aiyiib did rlot break his vow, though in reality he actually did. (2) The Prophet Yusuf resorted tO hzSlah when he asked his servnnts tO pUt a cup in the bag of his brother in order to keep his brother with him in Egypt on the pretext that the brother was guilty of stealing the cup. "He put the cup in his brother's bag" (12 Yusuf, 70); "then produced the cup from his brother's bag, that is how We planned an excuse for Yusuf, for under the law of the King (Pharaoh) he could not detain his brother unless God so willed" (12 Yusuf, 76). (3) The Qur'an relates the plot against the Prophet Salih and how God has saved Salih by a counter-plot. "In that city there were nine persons spreading mischief in the land and did not reform" (27 an-Narnl, 48). "They said: 'Let us swear by God that we will attack him (i.e. Salih) and his household at night and afterwards we will surely tell his near relatives that we witnessed not the destruction of his household and that verily we are tellmg the truth'" (27 an-Naml, 49). "So they plotted a plot, and We planned a plan, while they perceived not" (27 an-Narnl, 50). "Now see how was the end of their plot! Verily! We destroyed them and their nation all together" (27 an-Naml, 51). These verses show that scheriing against eviIdoers or for the attaent of jusiice is not forbidden. (4) It was related, with valid support, that when the prophet was travelling in company with some people, he met with a group of idolators who asked him: "Therefrom do you come?" The Prophet answered: "We come from water 154 abu-Zahrah, 2 1 4. 155 ibnul-Qaiyim(a): 3, 159 er seq.; cf. al-Miliki, 166-169; cf. ibn Nudjaim, 405-416, for detailed examples of the hiyal permitted by the Hanafis.</page><page sequence="44">191 REASONING IN ISLAMIC LAW: PART ONE (ma')" (echoing 21 al-Anbiya', 30: 'sWe made from water every living ching"). The idolators were astonished and one of them said to the others: "There are so many tribal names in Yemen: perhaps these people (the Prophet and his group) come from a tribe which we neither know nor have heard about before". The idolators then left the Prophet and the people in his company in peace and went away. The arguments relied on by the supporters of the second trend are as follows: (1) God said: "This day I have perfected your religion for you, completed My favours upon you, and have chosen for you Islam as your religion" (5 al- Ma'idah, 3). Perfection of religion does not allow any manipulation of the divine texts to achieve a purpose other than their original one.l56 (2) There are many Hadz^ths of the Prophet which indicate that the hiyal should not be used. Most instructive in this respect is the Hadfth: "I have left you on the clear path where there is always light day and night". More generally, the Sunnah of the Prophet closed the door of artful machinatiorzs; stralagems and deceit; blocked (sadda) the ways (dhara'i') to evil ar}d corruption; distinguished between the lawfill (halal?) arld the unlawful (haram); set out the legal punishITlents (hudud) and requested ie Muslims to do their best to heed the distinction between what is lawful and what is unlawful through steering clear of the dubious matters (mutashabihat) which lie between what is clearly lawful and what is clearly llnlawful.l57 (3) The SharRah cannot tolerate inconsistency (tanaqu by imposing an imperative rule and then allowing the use of hiyal to restrict or exclude its . . . appllcatlon. (4) As prevention is better than cure, any ways (dhara'i') leadmg to the defeat of the purposes of the SharRah should be blocked (tusadd). In sum, it is forbidden to use the hiyal to exclude or restrtct the imperaiive rules of the SharRah or to prevent or weaken the protection of the interests which it validates according to its ends and purposes. The use of hiyal should therefore be restricted to the vindication of a right or the prevention or the redress of an injustice. 158 Custom and usage ('Urf wa 'idah) Custom and usage ('urf wa 'adah) as a source of Sharf ah means oche formulation of a legal provision or criterion, or the interpretaiion of a text of the Qur'an, the Sunnah or consensus of opinion in accordance with a prevailing model of behaviour or social understanding or mode of expression, whether general to the t56 ibnUl-Qaiyirn(a): 3, 207. 158 ash-Shatibi: 2, 387; cf.

What is established by custom (ma'ruJ) is considered as equivalent to what is equitable and fair. For example, the statement in the Qur'an (2 al-Baqarah, 228) that women shall have rights, as well as obligations, according to custom (bil-ma'ruf) means that women shall have such rights and obligations as are not censured by the shar' and the usages of the people.l60 This implies a mutual relationship based on fair treaullent and freedom from harm or the intention to do harm.l6l Some scholars distinguish between custom ('urj) and usage ('adah). While in usage the repetition of a certain model of behaviour in certain circstances is purely mechanical, in custom such repetition implies reasonable acceptance or conviction of such model of behaviour.l62 This distinction is linguistic; the jurisprudents give usage ('adah) the same meanmg as custom ('urJ) and make no distinction between these two terms in their writings.l63 The custom, in order to be recognised, must satisfy the following conditions: (1) The model of behaviour must have been constant and consistently followed by the people at large (in the case of general custom) or by the people of a certain locality or a certain trade, profession or calling (in the case of special custom). The jurisprudents do not require for the recognition of a custom that it should have been in existence for a long period of time. In fact, what matters for the existence of a custom is that it should be followed consistently and without fail. The model of behaviour, if not followed consistently, does not establish custom.l64 The custom, as it may vary from time to time, applies only to the events which occur at the time of its existence; it does not apply in respect of the events which occurred either before its coming into existence or after it ceased to exist.l65 (2) The model of behaviour should not contradict any defmitive (qat'l8) rule of the ShanAsah.l66 Arly custom which is contrary to any such rule is called a defective custom ('urf fasid) and therefore should not be upheld or recognised. 167 Three remarks are here in point: (1) The texts of the SharsÂ¢ah which were made in the light of the prevailing custom should be interpreted as incorporag any new superveniIlg custom. For example, the HadzSth which considered the non-objecton of the virgiI 59 'abdull-Had 142. 160 an NaSafi: 1, i47- 161 Tafsi^rul-Djaldlain, 2 al-Baqarah, 228. 162 Cf.

This custom has changed in many places and, therefore, express consent to marry should be required for the validity of marriage of virgin girls.l68 (2) The customs which reflect the wishes of people to satisfy their legiiimate necessities (daruriyyat) and their legitimate needs (hadFiyydr) should be affirmed. 169 (3) As custom is based on the implied consensus of people, it will apply to deir contracts by implication. The contractirlg parties have however the right to exclude the application of the custom by their mutual express consent.l70 Optnions of the Companions (Aqwalus-Sahabah) The opirlions of the Companions of the Prophet (aqwalus-Sahdbah) carry great weight because of che special status of ie Sahabah who had the unique privilege of direct and personal access to jche teachings of the Prophet.l7l The jurisprudexlts make a basic distinction between the opinions of the Sahabah which were based on reasoning and their opinions which could not have been based orl reasoning. The jurisprudents cIte as an exarnpIe of the latter the opinion expressed by as-Saiyidah 'A'ishah that the maximum duration of pregnancy is two years. The jurisprudents argue that as-Saiyidah 'A'ishah could not have reached such a conclusion depending exclusively on her personal reasoning (iditiha): she must have heard the said HadzAth from the Prophet. Though the said HadSh of as-Saiyidah 'A'ishah is technically a stopped (mawquf) HadSh, it should be given the rank of a Hadz^th expressly ascribed (marfu) to de Prophet; i.e., should be considered as part of the binding Surmah.l72 The legal principle derilred from this Hadlth is dat a maximum duration of pregnancy should be fixed for legal purposes such as inheritance and legal descent. But the actual fixirlg of such maximum is a worldly matter depending on medical evidence and therefore is not part of the legislative Sllnnah. This explains why modern Islamic legislation, e.g., in Egypt, Sudan and Syria, has set one year (365 days) as the maximum duration of pregnancy.l73 In respect of e opinions of de Sahabah which were clearly based on personal reasoning, the jurispnadents make a furcher distinction between the opinions which becasle immediately known to all the other Compamions and were not contradicted by any one of them and the opinions which were not known to all the other Companions: 168 al Khaiyi 49 169 Khatlif), 90.

IShe Hanafis say that one of the conflicting opinions of the Companions should be chosen and considered as authority; it is not permissible to discard all such opinions. The Shafi'is argue that it is not imperative that any one of the conflictmg opinions of the Companions should be considered as binding and that it should therefore be permissible either to adopt any one of those opinions or to form a new opinion on the basis of the other proofs or sources of the ShanNah.l76 It is universally agreed that the opinions of the Successors of the Companions (Tabi'tAn) are only persuasive. abu-Hanlfah is reported to have said: "They (the Successors) are men and we are men", meanirlg by this that there is no reason why their opinions should be given a preference over the opinions of other jurisprudents of later ages.l77 Precedillg revelations (Shar'u man Qablana) Reference has already been made in the first section of this article to the Islamic concept of the continuity of Islnm as the true religion since the beginning of creation. The revelation of the Qur'an to Muhammad was preceded by different revelations to different Messengers. In the course of examining this basic concept, the jurisprudents have considered the question of whether the preceding revealed provisions (shar'u man qablana) should be considered as a source of Islarnic SharzNah. All jurisprudents agree that, for the purpose of authenticating the provisions and rules of the previous revelations, reference should be made orlly to the Qur'an and the valid Sunnah of the Prophet.l78 It is obvious that there should be no difficulty where the texts of the Qur'an and the Sunnah iIldicate expressly the intention tO collflrm the previous revelations (as, e.g., the corlfirulation of the obligation to fast during the holy month of Ramadan referred to in 2 al-Baqarah, 183) or to repeal or to vary them (as, e.g., the repeal of certain duties and prohibitions in relation to food referred to iIl 6 al-An'am, 145- 74 Khallif(b), 95 175 M S al-Ashqar, 116- 176 Kamsli, 240 (cig al-Ghazil; and al-Amidi); Khallif(b), 95-96. 177 Matlub, 197 178 Kamali, 230; M.

The majority of jurisprudents are of the opinion that the statements by the Qur'an of the rules of preceding revealed religions should be considered as forllling part of the ShanXah.l80 For example, the principle of prohibiting the Muslims from committing excesses in their religion is derived from 4 an-Nisa' 171; the principle that a promise of reward is legally binding is based on 12 Yusuf, 72; the legality of agreeing on time-sharing of irrigation rights finds its support in 54 al- Qamar, 28; and the regulation of retaliation (qisasD follows the scheme set forth in 5 al-Ma'idah, 45. Presumption of continuance (Istishabul-Hal) Presumption of continuance (istishabul-hal) is more a mle of evidence than a rule of substantive SharRah. This presumption means that a legal provision or condition which is prevailing at a certain original point of time will be presumed to be existing at any later time until it is proved that such provision or condition has ceased to exist. The presumption of continuance is usually classified into four main types or kinds: (1) The presumption of continuance of the original freedom of action enjoyment of all pleasures and utilisation of all things and resources. The origin of things is freedom from restrictions (al-aswlu fil-ashya'il-ibahah).
