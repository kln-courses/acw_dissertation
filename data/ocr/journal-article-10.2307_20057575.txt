<plain_text><page sequence="1">Virginia Woolf and the Flesh of the World Louise Westling A human being is part of the whole, called by us 'Universe'; a part limited in time and space. He experiences himself, his thoughts and feelings as something separated from the rest?a kind of optical delusion of his consciousness. This delu sion is a kind of prison for us, restricting us to our personal desires and to affection for a few persons nearest us. Our task must be to free ourselves from this prison by widening our circle of compassion to embrace all living creatures and the whole of nature in its beauty. Nobody is able to achieve this completely but the striving for such achievement is, in itself, a part of the liberation and a foundation for inner security. Albert Einstein1 Virginia Woolf would have agreed with Einstein's surprisingly ecological call for humanity to abandon its fictions of separate ness and embrace the whole of nature. As we have learned in recent years, she was much more attuned to his thinking than earlier readers would have supposed. She rejected the reductionist dualism of Western philosophy and worked progressively in her novels to resist and expose the sterility of the kind of rational humanism that came down to us from Plato and triumphed in Cartesian and Newtonian mechanistic models of the cosmos.2 At the same time as she wrote against sterile systems of logic, however, Woolf also recognized the efficacy of science and mathematics in opening windows upon the workings of Nature. She knew about Einstein's work in the 1920s, discussing him with friends, and referring to him in her 1925 novel, Mrs. Dalloway.5 She absorbed central concepts of the New Physics as soon as James Jeans and Arthur Eddington began explaining them to nonspecialists in the early 1930s, and she remained interested in their consequences until the end of her life.4 Far more than most modernists, she integrated the radical onto logical and epistemological perspectives suggested by quantum physics into her writing, because they accorded so well with her own lifelong awareness of the indeterminacy of consciousness. If, as Daniel Albright New Literary History, 1999, 30: 855-875</page><page sequence="2">856 NEW LITERARY HISTORY maintains, Einstein's physics became "a serious literary anxiety" for many modernists in the 1920s, for Virginia Woolf his work brought instead an exciting confirmation of her sense of the world.5 As a young woman in 1908 she had defined for herself a new kind of rhetoric that could "achieve a symmetry by means of infinite discords, showing all the traces of the minds [sic] passage through the world; &amp; achieve in the end, some kind of whole made of shivering fragments."6 In 1919 she described perception as composed of atoms falling disconnectedly upon the mind, and in 1925 she claimed that "Life is not a series of gig lamps symmetrically arranged; life is a luminous halo, a semi-transparent envelope surrounding us from the beginning of consciousness to the end."7 Each of her novels was a distinct epistemological exploration of that "semi-transparent envelope," part of a series of experiments seeking a crepuscular looseness and lightness of form that eschewed the tradi tional scaffolding of plot and increasingly placed human ambitions and systems of meaning against the backdrop of enormous geological forces and vast reaches of time. Increasingly she sought to portray the non human, or what David Abram calls the "more than human" world within which we are tiny and only momentary presences.8 Her experiments with point of view and narrative structure absorb the epistemological lessons of relativity, wave theory, and the interdependency of observer and phenomena observed from quantum physics into a new fictional ontology that reaches its most radical form in her final novel, Between the Acts. As Michelle Pridmore-Brown explains, there Woolf presents a vision of the world "as a pulsating field of mind and matter in which everything is interconnected" (WG 411). Woolf s dynamic, participatory vision of the real is very close to the thinking of French phenomenologist Maurice Merleau-Ponty, who was responding from within the same modernist intellectual milieu as Virginia Woolf, to the same developments in physics, and the same twentieth century impulse to overthrow or move beyond the Cartesian separation of subject and object, and its complicity with the Newtonian mechanistic metaphors of the cosmos.9 Others have called attention to the usefulness of Merleau-Ponty for articulating the theoretical implications of Woolf s fictional practice.10 Laura Doyle offers the fullest justification for this connection in her discussion of Woolf s novel To the Lighthouse, by resisting the postmodern "demotion of phenomenology to a philosophy of the falsely integrated subject" by appealing to Merleau-Ponty's treat ment of embodiment to show the body "not as a fixed or positivistic referent, not as that which escapes history and contingency," but rather as embedded within the flux of timespace. For Merleau-Ponty and for Woolf, Doyle suggests, the body "survives with and in language and</page><page sequence="3">VIRGINIA WOOLF AND THE FLESH OF THE WORLD 857 narrative, partly because language's physicality extends the phenomenal world's physicality" (TE 45-46). I want to make a somewhat different point: to emphasize the likeness between Woolf s fiction and Merleau Ponty's philosophy as the mark of a cultural ecosystem in flux. The wholeness of their cultural moment is enacted by serious participants within a variety of discourses dialogically responding to each other in a web of interrelations. Gillian Beer emphasizes the speed of assimilation and reworking of ideas from the new physics in Woolf s fiction, but she also points to the way that "scientists must think with the materials available to them in their culture" (PS 118). Albright claims that "Physics, biology, literature, music, painting, each has its separate technique and separate purpose; but they radiate out of some common center" ( QP 9). Philosophers of course are part of the mix. Merleau Ponty's description of the situatedness of perception, the mutuality of influence between observers and the things or beings observed, and the intertwining of space and time?all these central elements of his ontology are explicit discursive extensions of quantum physics. And as Liliane Papin has recently shown, quantum physicists for their part were keenly aware of the metaphoric, culture-bound limits of the scientific concepts they derived from mathematics.11 I shall argue that Virginia Woolf s fiction?and particularly Between the Acts?was part of an enormous change in cultural orientation which Merleau-Ponty's philosophy also participated in and can help to articu late. This Kuhnian paradigm shift has not yet been fully accomplished, but it has been in progress for a century and is beginning to become publicly explicit through ecological thinking. Environmental philoso pher Michael Zimmerman describes central elements of the new para digm: "recognition that humanity emerges from and is thus part of the rest of life; affirmation that life is a self-organizing web that we must cease controlling mechanically; acknowledgment that the Earth commu nity is itself sacred; realization that morality must be attuned to the 'languages' of the larger Earth community; recognition that we must encourage the flourishing of all life, human and nonhuman."12 While other critics of Virginia Woolf have commented upon the effects of her interest in physics or the closeness of her thinking to Merleau-Ponty's phenomenology, the connections between these relationships have not been examined. Ecocriticism is the only perspective that can provide a coherent account of the "center," in Albright's terms, from which they radiate, or the larger body they cooperate in articulating. An ecocritical consideration of Between the Acts in relation both to quantum physics13 and Merleau-Ponty's concept of sacramental engagement within the body of the world, suggests what that whole might be?an ecological humanism that parallels physics and voices a new paradigm. Such a new</page><page sequence="4">858 NEW LITERARY HISTORY humanism involves "the recuperation of the incarnate, sensorial dimen sion of experience [and] brings with it a recuperation of the living landscape in which we are corporeally embedded" (SS 65). This is Husserl's lifeworld or Lebenswelt, "the biosphere as it is experienced and lived from within by the intelligent body," a very different entity from that abstracted by mechanistic science (SS 65). Woolf s fiction is the closest enactment we have of this new humanism. She makes the radically interrogative turn toward Being for which Merleau-Ponty called, and which he came to think would open out upon the complex living flesh of the world.14 In order to delineate the vision of human embeddedness within the flesh of the world that Virginia Woolf presented at the end of her life in Between the Acts, I need first to establish her long concern with the nonhuman world, and her dismissal of abstract philosophy and human istic presumption in her 1927 novel To the Lighthouse. I will then briefly describe the main tenets of Merleau-Ponty 's ontology as a background for understanding her radical vision in Between the Acts. From the beginning of her career, Virginia Woolf was acutely attuned to the dynamic bodily fullness of the nonhuman world. Her diaries are full of descriptions of landscape, commentaries on the weather, and musings about the vast natural forces that surround and embrace the land and its life. In 1903 she likened the English Downs "to the long curved waves of the sea. It is as though the land here, all molten once, 8c rolling in vast billows had solidified while the waves were still swollen 8c on the point of breaking. From a height it looks as though the whole land were flowing" (PA 192). Humans seem to her to have had no effect on the real shape of the place, and villages seem to have sunk into hollows between the waves. The fields around Salisbury strike her as rising, swelling, and falling, "like some vast living thing, 8c all its insects 8c animals, save man, are exquisitely in time with it. If you lie on the earth somewhere you hear a sound like a vast breath, as though it were the very inspiration of earth herself, 8c all the living things on her" (PA 203). For her, writing was an activity so fused with the experience of earth and sea and sky that she thought of it in terms of landscape or waves. On a trip to Italy in 1908, for example, when she looked out at the hills above Florence, she thought at once of the Renaissance literature that had been produced in that setting: "I positively saw the long smooth sentence [of classic prose] running like a ribbon along the road . . . &amp; curving freely over the bare slopes of the hills" (PA 397). She thought of style as physical?a simple matter of rhythm: "A sight, an emotion, creates this wave in the mind, long before it makes words to fit it,"15 and she always associated writing with walking. Such comments express a sense of the commingling of the life-world and human perception that</page><page sequence="5">VIRGINIA WOOLF AND THE FLESH OF THE WORLD 859 Merleau-Ponty would later emphasize in his description of the unity of the senses or synaesthesia as "the formal expression of a fundamental contingency: the fact that we are in the world."16 This is "a primary layer of sense experience which precedes its division among the separate senses" by self-conscious analysis (PP 227, 229). Underneath the generally conventional narrative surface of Woolf s first novel, The Voyage Out (1915), she was experimenting with points of view outside ordinary human awareness, and thus challenging positivis tic assumptions of permanence, progress, and transcendence in echoes of those early diary musings. In that novel the ground shifts from time to time, perspective slides beyond stable categories and opens out into a strange, flowing primal reality like that conjured by Merleau-Ponty in his final writings, "a description of the man-animality intertwining" (W212, 274). The novel's protagonist, Rachel Vinrace, has a sense of the vast life beyond present human apprehension or control?of "mammoths pas tured in the fields of Richmond High Street" many thousands of years before London existed, or of "something alive" under the streets, in the sewers, in the wires surging through the modern city.17 Human distinc tiveness suddenly dissolves as the narrator's gaze moves away from the ship on which her characters sail the Atlantic, until the people on board look like insects or lumps, cormorants or cows (VO 87). Later her narrative presence floats through a sleeping hotel, describing the life of the night flowing through when all its human inhabitants are sunk in sleep, while outside wild animals are abroad and the wind blows purer and fresher over the hills and woods than under human eyes in daylight ( VO 111). Thus Woolf explored the nonhuman and the porous, the metamorphic boundaries between forms and species, and our deep enmeshment within this dynamic, shifting reality. Later novels continue this kind of exploration of the living world outside human structures and cultural constructions. In Jacobs Room, for example, at the end of the first chapter the narrative gaze travels along a beam of light from a house out into a storm and eventually fixes on a crab weakly trying again and again to climb out of a bucket half-full of rainwater.18 The end of another chapter attempts a glimpse of night airs and creatures in a world temporarily free of human consciousness, similar to that evoked in The Voyage Out (?l 84-85). In Mrs. Dalloway there is the much-remarked image of the old beggarwoman by the Regent's Park Tube Station, whose singing bubbles forth sounds "with an absence of all human meaning," like the voice of an ancient spring. Looking like a weatherbeaten tree, or a mere muddy hole in the ground, this figure suggests the continuation of elemental forces from ages past when the same place was a swamp full of mammoths (MD 88-89). In To the Lighthouse Woolf focuses full attention upon the energies of</page><page sequence="6">860 NEW LITERARY HISTORY earth's life without human beings, in a radical rejection of Victorian humanism with its heroic ideals and progressive ideology. This comes in the twenty-page transitional section called "Time Passes," between the opening portrait of the Ramsay family at the end of the Victorian era, and a picture of the diminished remains of that family after a ten-year hiatus including the First World War. "Time Passes" begins as the lamps are extinguished one night in the Ramsay household after a day rich with family life and close exploration of the intense personalities and subjectivities of its members. Almost immediately little airs and damp nesses begin to loosen the human structures of the house, night extends to night, and finally year to year as seasons pass, rains pour down, and rats scrabble and gnaw, mildews rot, and weeds poke up inside the house. The vast forces of the nonhuman world flow over and erase all the intricate structures of the human community. In such a context, the tragedies of the novel's human protagonists appear only as belated parenthetical asides, and centuries of humanist assumptions are overturned. "The Window"?the long opening section of the novel?carefully establishes the transcendent Platonic heritage of Western culture through the figure of Mr. Ramsay, a quintessential Victorian patriarch and philosopher who is a satiric portrait of Woolf s own father, Sir Leslie Stephen. Stephen's writings about the philosopher David Hume and his work as first editor of The Dictionary of National Biography are parodied in the novel's description of Mr. Ramsay's work,19 most obviously through his doubts about whether he can move his logical system from Q (the point he has succeeded in reaching) to R and onward toward the Z faintly glimmering in the distance far beyond his mental capacities. The qualities required for this exacting work are identified with heroic virtues gleaned from Homeric epic and applied to the conquest of nature?qualities implicitly associated with the neat categories and linear, causal reasoning of traditional philosophy.20 Stevie Davies sees To the Lighthouse as Woolf s "most deeply and consistently Platonist work," filled with yearning for the transcendent reality of the Ideas or Forms behind the shadows on the cave wall in Republic 7.21 But I would argue to the contrary, that Woolf s treatment of Mr. Ramsay's work is thoroughly satiric, a sustained attack on the Platonic tradition seen through the eyes of artist Lily Briscoe. When Lily asks Andrew Ramsay to explain his father's work, Andrew first says that it is about "subject and object and the nature of reality," but when Lily cannot understand this abstrac-tion, Andrew suggests, "Think of a kitchen table then, when you're not there" (TTL 28). From then on Lily carries in her mind the picture of a scrubbed kitchen table lodged in the fork of a pear tree. Woolf thus alludes to the well-known passage in Plato's Republic 10,22 where Socrates asks his disciple about the formal essence of a table or a bed. Lily's vision</page><page sequence="7">VIRGINIA WOOLF AND THE FLESH OF THE WORLD 861 of the table in the tree could only have been meant to be ridiculous, demonstrating the deadness and rigidity of human structures made from living things. "Naturally," thinks Lily, "if one's days were passed in this seeing of angular essences, this reducing of lovely evenings, with all their flamingo clouds and blue and silver to a white deal four-legged table . . . one could not be judged like an ordinary person" ( TTL 28). The narrator's wry irony captures the gulf between the artist's embodied response and the philosopher's insistence on rigid selectivity. The long philosophical tradition Woolf is mocking stretches back to Plato's mistrust of the mutable world of earthly things, but takes its distinctive modern form with Renaissance humanism. The triumphs of Enlightenment rationalism and mechanistic science developed from this secular faith in man's ability to conquer all the world and achieve something like divinity. As critics such as Merchant and Ehrenfeld have powerfully argued, enormous contempt for the embodied world has always lain just beneath the surface of humanistic claims. Renaissance formulations such as Pico della Mirandola's Oration on the Dignity of Man voice optimistic new claims about human possibility yet carry with them a revulsion against bodily existence upon "the fermenting dung-heap of the inferior world."23 In Pico's little creation parable, man has been placed in the center of creation and described by the Supreme Maker "as the free and proud shaper of your own being, [who can] fashion yourself in the form you may prefer" (7). The ideal for Pico is a Platonic escape from the body to become "a pure contemplator, unmindful of the body, wholly withdrawn into the inner chambers of the mind, . . . neither a creature of earth nor a heavenly creature, but some higher divinity, clothed with human flesh" (10-11; compare SC 39-62). This presumption of human transcendence has remained at the heart of subsequent philosophy, as well as functioning as the metaphoric ground ing of modern science and technology, which are predicated on human superiority to all other life and our right to control the natural world, of which we are assumed not really to be a part. Gillian Beer sees To the Lighthouse as largely focused on Hume's questioning of "subject and object and the nature of reality," upon which Sir Leslie Stephen himself wrote. In this view, Woolf is using the novel to struggle with her father's philosophical adaptation of Hume. Where Leslie Stephen moved "away from individualism to a confidence in communal development" Beer finds Woolf questioning "the tendency of the human to allow predominance to the human," and moving by the end of the novel to eschew the referential and the idea of permanence (HS 42-43, 47). I want to stress a somewhat more particular point?that Virginia Woolf raises these philosophical issues in order to dismiss them and turn in a different direction, toward a phenomenological sense of</page><page sequence="8">862 NEW LITERARY HISTORY embodied, participatory reality. Lily Briscoe's incapacity for abstraction signals Woolf 's own effort in the novel to re-embody human conscious ness, or, in Laura Doyle's words, "to turn inside out the unnamed, body transcending core of traditional Western philosophy and narrative" (TE 42). Hume, Leslie Stephen, and Mr. Ramsay work directly in the tran scendental Platonic tradition that assumes the separation of mind from body, and human consciousness from physical nature?hence the very formulation of subject as distinct from object, and the concept of "the nature of reality" as an object of speculation. The philosopher in such a system is a man above other men. Hume himself spoke of "that forlorn solitude, in which I am plac'd in my philosophy," expelled from all human commerce. "Fain wou'd I run into the crowd for shelter and warmth; but cannot prevail with myself to mix with such deformity" (quoted in AH 215). Woolf s object in "Time Passes" seems to me to be the complete dismantling of the transcendental abstractions which lead to such separation. As an alternative, she celebrates human community and its continuity with all the world which sustains it. "Time Passes" plunges her narrative into the very energies flowing through the sea of being?the more-than-human Lebenswelt?in which people are no more consequential than brief flashes of light. As the forces of wind and rain gradually invade and question, then begin to eat away the structure of the house during the first year of the Ramsays' absence, the narrator first mocks sentimental assumptions about the divine goodness of providence, then makes it clear that transcendental philosophical inquiries into "subject and object and the nature of reality" are completely out of place (compare TE 62 and HS 42-43). Peace reigns in the deserted house with the passage of years, with only the clammy sea airs moving among the shrouded forms of furniture, with light and shadow playing along the walls and across the blank mirror that once reflected human forms. Only the nonhuman remains, wrapped in an indifferent "air of pure integrity" (TTL 141). As the seasons and years flow by, the narrator questions the Romantic notion of nature's sympathy with humanity, then dissolves it in a bewildering confusion and interp?n?tration of forms that parodies anthropomorphic projections of order upon the nonhuman world. In passing, we learn that Mrs. Ramsay, the central creative force in the family, has died, as well as her two most promising children, all merely parentheses in the flow of seasons and destructive weathers that include muffled resonances of artillery from across the English Channel. Thus the Great War makes itself known in a sardonic aside that brings the narrator to muse again about the possibility of Nature's sympathy with human beings: "Did Nature supplement what man advanced? Did she complete what he began? With equal complacence she saw his misery,</page><page sequence="9">VIRGINIA WOOLF AND THE FLESH OF THE WORLD 863 condoned his meanness, and acquiesced in his torture. That dream, then, of sharing, completing, finding in solitude on the beach an answer, was but a reflection in a mirror, and the mirror itself was but the surface glassiness which forms in quiescence when the nobler powers sleep beneath? Impatient, despairing yet loth to go (for beauty offers her lures, has her consolations), to pace the beach was impossible; contemplation was unendurable; the mirror was broken" (TTL 146). This flat denial signals the end of Romantic optimism and ushers in another succession of seasons and the return of spring, this time strange, eyeless, and terrible. The universe seems to be ruled by brute confusion and wanton lust, and the mind of man cannot reflect it with any comprehension. The house seems to settle into an eternal night in which toads nose their way into the kitchen, thistles begin growing in the larder, swallows nest in the drawing-room, and rats settle in behind the wainscots while plaster falls by the shovelful. What the narrator calls the "fertility, the insensibility of nature" has taken over. But suddenly two old cleaning women come back and shore up the house for its returning inhabitants. The Ramsays who come back after ten years are a sadly depleted lot. Their lives are shadowed by loss and dwarfed by the interlude that "Time Passes" describes?those ten years in which the enormous forces of the nonhuman world and the carnage of World War I have torn away the illusions of knowledge, control, and transcendence. Mr. Ramsay had assumed himself to be a heroic free intellect in the long opening section of To the Lighthouse, but the final section of the novel ushers in a new world and delivers a chastened, humbled Mr. Ramsay who no longer strikes heroic poses and who places great importance on simple physical things like his boots. As Gillian Beer observes, he modestly refrains from grand gestures when the long planned trip to the lighthouse is finally completed. "At the moment when highest mystification is expected we are offered a complete d?mystification," with Ramsay sprinkling his sandwich crumbs into the sea and acknowledging to himself that it is only water after all, in which sailors naturally drown from time to time (HS 45). Through the portrait of Mr. Ramsay, Woolf has rejected humanist pretensions of separation and transcendence, returning to a focus upon embodiment and thus reversing her culture's long dismissal of the living world. As we have seen, Maurice Merleau-Ponty worked toward a similar result, inverting Platonic idealism by following Husserl in claiming that the body is the locus of knowledge. He developed an ontology that completely erases traditional distinctions of mind and body, spirit and matter, human and natural. "We have relearned to feel our body," he writes in Phenomenology of Perception', "we have found underneath the objective and detached knowledge of the body that other knowledge</page><page sequence="10">864 NEW LITERARY HISTORY which we have of it in virtue of its always being with us and of the fact that we are our body. In the same way we shall need to reawaken our experience of the world as it appears to us in so far as we are in the world through our body, and in so far as we perceive the world with our body" (PP 206). Later he concluded more emphatically, "It is to experience that the ultimate ontological power belongs" (V78). That experience is immersed in Being, formed and continuing in dynamic participation with things and beings, all coextensive together, displaying themselves and calling us into relation with them. Thus our sensations are the active expression of relationship, a continuing com munion with the living world. Merleau-Ponty uses colors as exemplary of this relationship: We must therefore stop wondering how and why red signifies effort or violence, green restfulness and peace; we must rediscover how to live these colours as our body does, that is, as peace or violence in concrete form.... [R]ed, by its texture as followed and adhered to by our gaze, is already the amplification of our motor being. The subject of sensation is neither a thinker who takes note of a quality, nor an inert setting which is affected or changed by it, it is a power which is born into, and simultaneously with, a certain existential environment, or is synchro nized with it. The relations of the sentient to the sensible are comparable with those of the sleeper to his slumber: .... In the same way [as I fall asleep,] I give ear or look, in the expectation of a sensation, and suddenly the sensible takes possession of my ear or my gaze, and I surrender a part of my body, even my whole body, to this particular manner or vibrating and filling space known as blue or red. (PP 211-12). Elements and forces in the world "radiate around them a certain mode of existence" with the power to cast a spell upon us in a sacramental sense "because the sentient subject does not posit them as objects, but enters into a sympathetic relation with them, makes them his own, and finds in them his momentary law" (PP 214). That is how we move in the world, and our active bodily being is the source of all our thoughts: "Space and perception generally represent, at the core of the subject, the fact of his birth, the perpetual contribu tion of his bodily being, a communication with the world more ancient than thought" (PP 254). But because these sources are so pervasive and so deeply buried, they are invisible to us, "impenetrable to reflection." Ideas of space and time alike grow out of our bodily life and remain embedded in it. By the time of his sudden death in 1961, Merleau-Ponty had come to think of space and time as simultaneous, intertwining with each other and making each other possible ( V7117). They are qualities we apprehend and distinguish within what he came to regard as "the Flesh," which includes the body of the whole world. David Abram calls</page><page sequence="11">VIRGINIA WOOLF AND THE FLESH OF THE WORLD 865 this "the mysterious tissue or matrix that underlies and gives rise to both the perceiver and the perceived as interdependent aspects of its own spontaneous activity" (SS 66). Such an embeddedness is what Virginia Woolf conjured in the "Time Passes" section of To the Lighthouse, but on so cosmic a scale that individual human lives are only droplets thrown briefly into the air by the vast sea of dynamic being. Her imagery there anticipates Merleau-Ponty's later assertion that "we are the upsurge of time" (PP 428) ,24 Woolf s final novel, Between the Acts, represents a dramatic extension of this perspective, developed in the decade of the 1930s and influenced by her reading of Arthur Eddington's and James Jeans's writings on the new physics.25 Between the Acts concerns the events of a June day in 1939, at a country house where a village pageant is performed. Woolf must have got the idea for the pageant from her friend E. M. Forster's England's Pleasant Land, a work that was performed three times in July of 1938 and pub lished by the Hogarth Press in 1940. Forster's purpose was to celebrate the landscape and inveigh against its degradation by real estate develop ers.26 However, Woolf wrote her pageant when the far more destructive forces of warfare were at work, with bombs smashing cities into rubble and falling planes from both sides plowing up the landscape. She imagined the total destruction of the world she knew. Against this implied catastrophe, which readers still expected when the novel was posthumously published in 1941, Woolf s narrative persona and her characters question the meaning of their lives as the pageant reflects them. The pageant itself is fragmented and sometimes seems incoherent to its audience. One of its central refrains is the phrase "scraps, orts, and fragments" which seems to indicate all we can know and all that culture can preserve. Yet meaning is shaped from these fragments by the characters in the novel and by ourselves as readers negotiating the silences and confusions, as well as the various propositions and symbolic suggestions of the text. Among these are a radically democratized and feminized view of English history in the pageant, which dwells on the reigns of three queens and omits warfare completely; the landscape's embodiment of history from the era of the dinosaur through the Romans and up to the present; and the sustaining natural rhythms of the land and its creatures which outlast all human effort. The novel posits nonhuman forces and beings as crucial players in the human drama, both in the village pageant written by Miss La Trobe and in the world of its audience. Swallows, butterflies, trees, cows, clouds, and rain interweave with human activities and are shown to be especially important in the pageant's performance. Woolf has made clear from the novel's prelude that these presences are integral to the conversations of her human characters, insisting on the participatory community of life</page><page sequence="12">866 NEW LITERARY HISTORY from the very mud to all kinds of animal and human activities. The novel begins with a discussion of a cesspool, a seemingly humble, even indeco rous, subject for polite society, but it is one which turns out to represent the basic workings of life?mutability, decay, and regeneration?which underlie human affairs. As the novel unfolds, Woolf returns again and again to this or similar images (cesspool, lily pond, primeval mud or swamp), comically deflating humanistic pretensions. The major charac ters, old Bart Oliver and his widowed sister Lucy Swithin, Bart's son Giles and his wife Isa, and neighbors Mr. and Mrs. Haines are likened to animals. Conversation in the opening scene includes the coughing of a cow and the chuckling of birds over worms and snails, and the humans hear and respond to these animal sounds. Later, during the pageant, again and again the wind blows the words away as the chorus of villagers chant their lines. And from time to time, cows lend their voices to fill up the silences when the wind rises and trees rustle. At one particularly crucial point when Miss La Trobe is paralyzed with despair that her play is failing, "From cow after cow came the same yearning bellow. The whole world was filled with dumb yearning. It was the primeval voice sounding loud in the ear of the present moment. . . . The cows annihilated the gap; bridged the distance; filled the emptiness and continued the emotion."27 Such relations illustrate Merleau-Ponty's assertion that, "Like the flesh of the visible, speech is a total part of the significations, like it, . . . endowed with a natural magic that attracts the other significations into its web, as the body feels the world in feeling itself ( VI 118). Woolf suggests the radical sense in which language belongs not only to the animal community but to the whole of the natural world, when a gap Miss La Trobe has left in her pageant for "ten minutes of present time" without speech or action from her cast is suddenly filled by a shower of rain. The rain is described as "the other voice speaking, the voice that was no one's voice" (BA 107). This idea is very close to a later claim of Merleau-Ponty's about the original source and existential reality of language: "in a sense, as Val?ry said, language is everything, since it is the voice of no one, since it is the very voice of the things, the waves, and the forests" (V7155). In this same sense, all of Woolf s speakers are part of an interwoven, participatory community that lives not just on the land but within it, as Woolf signals on the first page with Bart Oliver's references to the signs of history still inscribed in the land?"scars made by the Britons; by the Romans; by the Elizabethan manor house; and by the plough, when they ploughed the hill to grow wheat in the Napoleonic wars" (BA 5). Time is thus embodied in the space of the land and will later be playfully re</page><page sequence="13">VIRGINIA WOOLF AND THE FLESH OF THE WORLD 867 embodied by the performers of Miss La Trobe's pageant as they march through a panorama of English history. As one after another illusion of the artist's (and any human director's or maker's) control is stripped away during the pageant, with players forgetting their lines, the gramophone malfunctioning, the wind mak ing voices inaudible, the audience misunderstanding or fidgeting in their chairs, and Miss La Trobe fuming and cursing her failure behind the scenes, it seems more and more that the only certainties are ele mental rhythms of the nonhuman community?the primeval stability of returning seasons, the creative bubbling ooze of the cesspool or the mud in the lily pond, the return of the swallows each year from their southern migrations. What people consider emptiness or silence, Woolf s narrator reveals to be full of small, busy lives. At the interval between the first two parts of the pageant, for example, just before the audience arrives in the barn for refreshments, the narrator announces, "The Barn was empty." But immediately thereafter we read: "Mice slid in and out of holes or stood upright, nibbling. Swallows were busy with straw in pockets of earth in the rafters. Countless beetles and insects of various sorts burrowed in the dry wood. A stray bitch had made the dark corner where the sacks stood a lying-in ground for her puppies. All these eyes, expanding and narrowing, some adapted to light, others to darkness, looked from different angles and edges. Minute nibblings and rustlings broke the silence" (BA 61-62). The carnivalesque finale of the pageant is a paean to the kinship of the living. Swallows dance the waltz played on the gramophone, and the trees around the open grassy space that functions as stage seem "massed and hoarded," preventing what is fluid from overflowing: "And Lord! the jangle and the din! The very cows joined in. Walloping, tail lashing, the reticence of nature was undone, and the barriers which should divide Man the Master from the Brute were dissolved. Then the dogs joined in. Excited by the uproar, scurrying and worrying, here they came!" (BA 109). By the end of the novel, this is the proper context for rethinking human destiny: a giddy tangle of forms and beings within each kind dances its own rhythm, irrepressibly intertwined. Between the Acts is intrinsically dramatic, a more intensely dialogic work than any other novel Woolf wrote. Its title has multiple referents: the broadly public and historical interlude between the two "acts" of the World Wars, or the intensely private inner thoughts of Woolf s charac ters between their spoken interactions with each other. Or the title can refer to life in the Oliver household before and between and after the several acts of Miss La Trobe's pageant. The ending lines of the novel? "Then the curtain rose. They spoke."?suggest that the acts are the</page><page sequence="14">868 NEW LITERARY HISTORY intimate scenes between the young married couple Giles and Isa Oliver, with all of the novel's events merely an interval. All of these possibilities and more seem to function simultaneously,28 so that we participate in a vibrantly complex series of conversations all echoing with and against each other. Woolf was determined that the novel should be about community, with "I" rejected and "we" substituted (DW5:135), and thus her narrative embraces dramatic cacophony; more, it anticipates Merleau Ponty's emphasis on interrelationship as central reality. For Merleau Ponty "we are collaborators for each other in consummate reciprocity. Our perspectives merge into each other, and we co-exist through a common world" (PP 354). This is the social world we all carry with us unconsciously, and which is inseparable from us (PP362). As Woolf s treatment of animal, plant, and meteorological linguistic contributions suggests, this social world is not only human but collaborates within the much larger matrix of earthy life and energy. Similarly, Merleau-Ponty wrote near the end of his life, "No one thinks any more, everyone speaks, all live and gesticulate within Being" (Vf 119). Yet if all are speaking and gesticulating in different voices, how is there to be any coherence? In the case of the multiple perspectives offered by characters in Between the Acts, Woolf provides repeated refrains for emphasis, such as the "scraps, orts, and fragments" already noted, and the repeated rhythmic alternation of "Unity?Dispersity" becoming "un ... dis ... un ... dis" toward the end of the play and sug gesting the dual reality of group unity and individual consciousness, as Pridmore-Brown and others have pointed out (WG 414). From the perspective of quantum mechanics, however, various local events, or the alternating appearances of unity and dispersity, can be simultaneous or equally potential states of a given entity, as a subatomic entity can be either a particle or a wave, depending on circumstances and observation. Such seems to be the case for individual humans and other animals in the novel, with their multiple voices which are both separate and part of the group, sometimes affirming and sometimes rejecting (WG 418-19). Near the end of the novel, Isa expresses this paradox when she answers Lucy's question about whether the pageant made her feel that "we act different parts but are the same." Isa answers, 'Yes," then "No." "It was Yes, No. Yes, yes, yes, the tide rushed out embracing. No, no, no, it contracted" (BA 127). The key here is that such alternations, as well as the scraps and fragments making up the pageant and casual conversa tions, are part of a whole reality, no matter how disjointed, contradictory, or chaotic they may appear from particular vantage points. The indeter minacy of our access to accurate knowledge, which Heisenberg's Uncer tainty Principle clearly established early in the century, does not neces sarily indicate a meaningless universe. Rather, what seems uncertain</page><page sequence="15">VIRGINIA WOOLF AND THE FLESH OF THE WORLD 869 from the human point of view could feel like dynamism and possibility from the point of view of a particle or "quon" in the quantum world (QR 110-11). Furthermore, theoretical physicist John Stewart Bell developed a theorem in 1964 that disproves claims of relative truths or purely local, unconnected realities (QR 211-31). In recent decades Bell's Inter connectedness Theorem, as it has come to be called, which implies that there is one unified though concealed superluminal underpinning, has been amply supported by the work of other physicists. As Herbert explains, "Bell's theorem shows that the holistic grammar of the quan tum formalism reflects the inseparable nature of reality itself. Beneath phenomena, the world is a seamless whole" (QR 242; see also 50-52).29 Virginia Woolf suggests through the placement of two key characters that such a wholeness exists, and it is the same kind of Being to which Merleau Ponty refers in The Visible and the Invisible as the flesh of the world. Commentators have often focused on Miss La Trobe as the author's representative, and therefore expected her pageant to deliver a cryptic message that will speak for the whole novel. Her pageant does lie at the heart of the text, taking up about twenty percent of its pages. And La Trobe's mind is described in terms of the elemental muddy matrix of creation linked to the cesspool and the fertile ooze of the lily pond: "she was the one who seethes wandering bodies and floating voices in a cauldron, and makes rise up from its amorphous mass a re-created world" (BA 92). But La Trobe's "vision" is fragmentary, parodie, and never fully explained. The fullest commentary within the text is offered by the slightly ridiculous village clergyman, the Rev. Streatfield, and it is only a string of platitudes. Readers must seek their own access to meaningful interconnections, but Virginia Woolf has shaped our appre hensions by placing the vague but generous musings of Lucy Swithin at the beginning of the day's events and then again at their end as a commentary on the whole. Because Lucy does not herself presume to summarize her philosophy, all we have to guide us is the generosity of her impulses, her attitude of reverence for the world, and her fascina tion with prehistory. Lucy's religious faith is mocked by other characters and has usually been dismissed by the novel's critics as well. Neverthe less, it is she more than any other character who shares the narrator's attention to the nonhuman world, and she who is full of the kind of wonder at natural energies and creatures that animates the whole novel. Lucy's immersion in descriptions of prehistoric London full of rhodo dendron forests and "elephant-bodied, seal-necked, heaving, surging, slowly writhing" monsters may be comic, but her sense of prehistory haunts the novel from its beginning and ends up reflected in Miss La Trobe's plans for her next pageant, as well as animating the narrator's final vision of Giles and Isa Oliver (BA 8).</page><page sequence="16">870 NEW LITERARY HISTORY At peace with vagueness, Lucy's acceptance of uncertainty provides a parodie version of the stylistic indeterminacy which informs the whole novel and illustrates Merleau-Ponty's definition of the proper use of language for philosophy. In The Visible and the Invisible, he claimed that perspectives upon "ultimate and primary being" offer themselves "only to someone who wishes not to have them but to see them, not to hold them as with forceps, or to immobilize them as under the objective of a microscope, but to let them be and to witness their continued being." This is a tentative, interrogative attitude "which lets the perceived world be rather than posits it, before which the things form and undo them selves in a sort of gliding, beneath the yes and the no" (VI101-102). Language most charged, in his view, is language which opens energeti cally upon Being, words that "most closely convey the life of the whole and make our habitual evidences vibrate until they disjoin" (V7102). Such is the effect of Woolf s language in Between the Acts, as the narrative voice seems to suggest in describing Miss La Trobe's relief when the play is over, with an echo of Prospero 's reflections in Shake speare's Tempest, upon his "insubstantial pageant faded," drifting away like our lives, and like the clouds that leave "not a rack behind."30 Miss La Trobe "could straighten her back. She could open her arms. She could say to the world, You have taken my gift! Glory possessed her?for one moment. But what had she given: A cloud that melted into the other clouds on the horizon" (BA 124). At many points in the novel, art and indeed all human effort has been seen in such transitory terms, and after the pageant Woolf continues the cloud imagery for several pages. The characters who understand and communicate what seems the central vision of the book?Lucy Swithin and Miss La Trobe?reempha size the kind of interrogative mood, or modesty and respect toward Being, that Merleau-Ponty advocates. Indeed, Woolf implies that Miss La Trobe is comforted almost immediately after her despair at the vanish ing of her art, by another kind of living creation, this time the wild music made by the brief appearance of a flock of starlings in the tree behind which she had stood to direct the play. It seems as if the birds have come to applaud or celebrate in a parallel kind of art: "The whole tree hummed with the whizz they made, as if each bird plucked a wire. A whizz, a buzz rose from the bird-buzzing, bird-vibrant, bird-blackened tree. The tree became a rhapsody, a quivering cacophony, a whizz and vibrant rapture, branches, leaves, birds syllabling discordantly life, life, life, without measure, without stop devouring the tree. Then up! Then off!" (BA 124). This celebration of mutability and cacophony is much like that conjured by Miss La Trobe's pageant, as a carnivalesque, incon gruous group of villagers danced and processed across the lawn, parody ing English history and culture. In short, Miss La Trobe's pageant has</page><page sequence="17">VIRGINIA WOOLF AND THE FLESH OF THE WORLD 871 been a temporary infestation of the place by noisy animals not very different from the starlings. Woolf is suggesting the kinds of alliances that Merleau-Ponty asserts, when the starlings arrive and startle despon dent Miss La Trobe. The birds behave like Merleau-Ponty's "habitual evidences that vibrate until they disjoin" and burst back into the air. They are m?tonymie representatives of the mysterious invisible energies coiled up within the visible world, energies about which philosophy (and literature) can raise a question "consonant with the porous being which it questions and from which it obtains not an answer, but a confirmation of its astonishment." Thus "we ourselves are one sole continued question, a perpetual enterprise of taking our bearings on the constellations of the world, and of taking the bearings of the things on our dimensions" (VI102-103). Between the Acts ends as a curtain rises on Giles and Isa Oliver, alone in the dark living room after Bart and Lucy have gone to bed. But the curtain rises on people who have been returned to the kind of "brute existence" that Merleau-Ponty claims is the essence of our being, the only environment we know ( V7117). It is the environment Miss La Trobe has just been imagining for her next play as she sits drowsing over her drink in the pub, and it is also the prehistoric world Lucy has just re encountered in her book on English history. "England was then a swamp," she reads. "Thick forests covered the land. . . . Prehistoric man, half-human, half-ape, roused himself from his semi-crouching position and raised great stones" (BA 129). This setting has taken over the room when Giles and Isa are left alone: "Alone, enmity was bared; also love. Before they slept, they must fight; after they had fought, they would embrace. From that embrace another life might be born. But first they must fight, as the dog fox fights with the vixen, in the heart of darkness, in the fields of night. . . . The house had lost its shelter. It was night before roads were made, or houses. It was the night that dwellers in caves had watched from some high place among rocks" (BA 129-30). Our basic being is like that of the fox or the cave dweller. Its brutality and violence cause wars that strip away illusions of transcendence and restore our realization of who we really are, unchanged from the ancient selves who lived among the mastodons and saber-toothed tigers. Woolf foresaw that we would bring ourselves literally back to those circum stances with our wars and destructive technologies. Indeed the brute existence defined at the end of Between the Acts was the literal context of Virginia Woolf s life while she was writing the novel, for the Battle of Britain was raging over her head. Nazi bombers and fighter squadrons droned over Southern England in wave after wave to smash London and bring the English to their knees. With all of Europe virtually in German hands and the extermination of the Jews common</page><page sequence="18">872 NEW LITERARY HISTORY knowledge among people who cared to be informed, no wonder she imagined the end of English history, the destruction of European civilization (or at least liberal democracy), and her own and her husband Leonard's deaths under Nazi cleansing of Jews and left-wing intellectuals. Between the Acts is a meditation in time of catastrophe, upon the meaning of history, of human accomplishment, and more particu larly, of English traditions and culture measured against prehistoric savagery and the oblivion of death. Across the Channel in France, Merleau-Ponty witnessed the holocaust of modern technology har nessed by that same war, yet he, like Woolf, affirmed the sacramental integrity of life and the wholeness of the world in spite of the horrors it included. Neither could have known how apt their considerations would be for the threat of ecological collapse that now faces not only humans but all the rest of life on earth. This time, however, there is not a simple human enemy to combat with the familiar technologies of warfare; instead we must resist the long ideological habit resulting from our species' apparent success in control ling nature. Woolf consoled herself under siege by commenting that "thinking is my fighting" (DW5:285). Her thinking went much beyond the specific threat of war, to shape a view of human destiny radically different from the traditional Platonic/Cartesian ideal of transcendent control over nature. The ecological humanism she modeled rhetorically in Between the Acts, in parallel with the understanding of the world offered by quantum physics and by Merleau-Ponty's phenomenology, restores humanity to its place within the bodily community of earth's life and refocuses attention upon the limitations and responsibilities that must humble our species if we are to survive.31 The University of Oregon NOTES 1 Quoted in Nick Herbert, Quantum Reality: Beyond the New Physics (New York, 1985), p. 250; hereafter cited in text as QR 2 This well-established lineage can be found in such studies as Carolyn Merchant, The Death of Nature:Women, Ecology, and the Scientific Revolution (New York, 1980); David Ehren feld, The Arrogance of Humanism (New York, 1978), hereafter cited in text as AH; Max Oelschlaeger, The Idea of Wilderness (New Haven, 1991); Neil Evernden, The Social Creation of Nature (Baltimore, 1978), hereafter cited in text as SC; and Rebecca Solnit, Savage Dreams: A Journey into the Landscape Wars of the American West (New York, 1994). 3 Virginia Woolf, The Diary of Virginia Woolf ed.

Forster's England's Pleasant Land (London, 1940), which Virginia and Leonard Woolf published at the Hogarth Press which they had founded soon after their marriage. Although the Diary's editor Anne Olivier Bell explains that the Woolfs did not attend any of the three performances of Forster's pageant, so many parallels exist between Miss LaTrobe's pageant in Between the Acts and Forster's that Virginia Woolf must have used his text as a jumping-off point. Of course the uses she made of such devices as the parade of villagers and the panorama of history are quite different, and her exploration of threats to the English countryside are more searching. Woolfs interest in the archaeological history of England is evident from her earliest publications, as Gillian Beer demonstrates in "Virginia Woolf and Prehistory," Virginia Woolf: The Common Ground, pp. 6-28. The deep history reflected through Lucy Swithin's musings is a central motif of the novel. This kind of historical backdrop is at once more particularized, more ancient and archaeological, and more philosophically pregnant than Forster's. 27 Virginia Woolf, Between the Acts, ed. Stella McNichol (London, 1992), pp. 84-85; hereafter cited in text as BA. 28 Gillian Beer, "Introduction," in Woolf, Between the Acts, p. xxix. 29 Herbert explains that Bell's theorem necessitates a "rainbow reality"?a superluminal rainbow world. "The phenomenon in this hypothetical world, whether [a rainbow seen by a person in one world] moves or not, is completely local: Suzie's rainbow [on one planet or Earth] doesn't move when Joe [looking at a rainbow on a counter Earth] changes places. However, this world's reality?the array of little dots that make up both rainbows?is non local: Suzie's dots [the random array that makes up her rainbow] change instantly whenever Joe moves his chair." But the rainbow seems not to have changed, while Joe's rainbow does move when he moves his chair, "because a rainbow's position attribute is contextual, not innate" (Quantum Reality, p. 230). And "physicists have discovered that the very atoms of our bodies are woven out of a common super-luminal fabric" ( Quantum Reality, p. 250). 30 William Shakespeare, The Tempest, in The Riverside Shakespeare, ed. G. Blakemore Evans, 2nd ed. (Boston, 1997), 4.1.148-58. 31 Recent developments in biology further articulate the new paradigm that has been forming. Steven Rose, for example, offers a view of genetics that sounds much like the quantum world of physics, with genes "in constant dynamic interchange with their cellular environment" (Lifelines: Biology, Freedom, Determinism [London, 1997], p. 125). Such a description runs counter to reductionist descriptions of mechanical processes from popular journalism and such best-selling books as Richard Dawkins' The Selfish Gene and its sequels (The Selfish Gene [New York, 1976]; River Out of Eden: A Darwinian View of Life [New York, 1995]; Climbing Mount Improbable [New York, 1996]; and Unweaving the Rainbow: Science, Delusion, and the Appetite for Wonder [Boston, 1998]).
