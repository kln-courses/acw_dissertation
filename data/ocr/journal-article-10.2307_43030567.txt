Martin Edge Robert Pearson Research in Scotland has described a paradox in the UK planning system as it tries to encourage tradition and vernacular architecture in the rural built environment. It is suggested that the paradox, which is demonstrated to be at least partially instigated and perpetuated by much of the literature on vernacular local architecture , emanates from a flawed implicit definition , in the minds of many planners , of the nature of vernacular built forms. The thesis of this paper hinges around a discussion of the true nature of appropriate vernacular form in relation to changing , culturally driven , contemporary tradition. It is supported by evidence from the literature on the subject , demonstrating shifting perceptions of "place " and the use of symbols in our appreciation and planning of built environments which reflect a strongly historicist perspective. Empirical evidence is presented which demonstrates that many of our mental constructs of tradition in the rural built environment are based on a partial , historical view which does little to accommodate evolution and necessary change in rural systems. It is proposed that a systems-based, broadly "ecological" approach to the way in which built environments address local economic, social, resource, and environmental criteria is a more appropriate response to the control of rural architectural form than current models, based as they are largely on conformity to a " checklist " of visual criteria constructed around an "inauthentic" view of "place.

Moreover the evolution of architecture is usually dealt with only in its late phases ... Architectural history is ... biased on the social plane. It amounts to little more than a Who's Who of architects who commemorated power and wealth; an anthology of buildings by and for the privileged - houses of true and false godsy of merchant princes and of princes of the blood - with never a word about lesser people ... such self-imposed limitations seem absurd. (Bernard Rudofsky's introduction to the 1963 exhibition "Architecture Without Architects" at the Metropolitan Museum of Modern Art, New York [Quoted in Farmer, 1996]). While a house today must still shelter , it does not need to symbolize or romanticize its sheltering function, to the contrary such symbols are today meaningless and merely nostalgic. (Peter Eisenman, on the "Tradition of housing and the housing of tradition" [Quoted in Benjamin, 1991]). INTRODUCTION This paper argues that policies ostensibly designed to conserve and encourage the use of vernacular built forms in Britain's rural areas are, in some senses, directly in conflict with actual vernacular traditions. It is suggested that in the UK there is a fundamental paradox in planning processes, emanating from ad hoc definitions of traditional built form, which are subjective and based on flawed premises. The fairground "bouncy castle" is employed as a metaphor for the misinterpretation of vernacular form by planners and others. A more ecological approach to the definition of vernacular architecture, it is proposed, can offer more rational, forward looking, consensual approaches to the evolution of the rural built environment. The paper has arisen from and reports on research which investigated the disparity between actual vernacular forms and published works on the subject in an area of rural Scotland. The results show that the vision of appropriate rural buildings portrayed in the literature and adopted by the planning system is a long way from the reality of vernacular architecture on the ground. These results form the basis of a discussion of the defining nature of vernacular architectures and some of the reasons for their misinterpretation within literature and in planning ordinances. The research, carried out at the Faculty of Design at Robert Gordon University, Aberdeen, was linked to a major commission on affordable rural housing, funded by Scotland's national housing agency, Scottish Homes, and a local authority, Gordon District Council. PLANNING AND ACCEPTABLE BUILT FORM IN THE COUNTRYSIDE Nowadays, no British fairground or village fete would be complete without the ubiquitous inflatable "bouncy castle" to keep the kids amused. Arriving folded up on the back of a truck, the huge plastic sack, with its crenelations and painted-on arrow slits, is inflated for the day, and then moves on. Bouncy castle "architecture" is of course a kind of cartoon architecture. Indeed it is a microcosm of that archetypal symbol of the "Disneyfication" of much of our built environment, the theme park (Relph, 1976). The bouncy castle has a shape and a colored veneer which is reminiscent, and only reminiscent, of a kind of architecture from a previous time. It is a caricature of a sort of generic medieval castle. It is not even a pastiche of any particularly genuine architectural form. Beyond the basic visual cues given by the overall form and the painted-on stone courses, the resemblance between a real castle and its modern, inflatable, bouncy counterpart ends. For example, a fundamental functional requirement of many castles, distinguishing them from most other buildings, is that they should be able to fulfill a defensive role. A medieval castle which went into melt-down if you spilled a drop or two of boiling oil on it would be considered a seriously dysfunctional building. It would not withstand the most perfunctory of post-occupancy analyses. Much of the British</page><page sequence="3">Journal of Architectural and Planning Research 18:2 (Summer, 2001) 93 FIGURE 1. Images of rural Scotland: A "chocolate box" castle happened to fall within one of the sampled areas. FIGURE 2. Images of the vernacular: Estate-built stone cottages form a template around which to build criteria for the control of new housing. countryside, particularly Scotland's more remote countryside, is romantically supposed to be full of castles. Indeed, some of the most abiding, universally recognized, chocolate-box images of the land, those images by which we are known abroad and which serve to attract the tourist, are of its castles. At one time such castles had a functional, local purpose. Now much of their value is as historic versions of what Jackson called "other-directed architecture" (Zube, 1970). Most of us would be some- what perturbed if there were plans to litter the countryside with per- manent "bouncy castles." The image is bizarre and unthink- able, but there is a serious intention in the metaphor. This paper argues that the planning system in the UK has adopted a vision of appropriate rural development which is little more than caricature. Thus, paradoxically, a system which has been endeavoring to support the traditions of vernacular built form has, in reality, been encouraging the implementation of an architec- ture which has many parallels with the inflatable, bouncy fairground castle. It is an approach which has done little, over the years, to as- suage widespread concerns over the direction in which development in Scotland's countryside is head- ing (Scottish Office, 1991; Alldridge, 1993; Richards and Richards. 1994). The results of this misdirected pursuit of "heritage" have much in common with what Relph (1976) and others have termed "Disneyfication" in the United States and elsewhere, and which Rowntree and Conkey (1980) have identified with the "cultural stress" induced by the pressure for change in historical urban en- vironments. Adorno (1979) relates such cultural stress to a valid, if reactionary, fear of technological change, suggesting that: This anxiety reflects a common childhood experience ... the longing for castles with long chambers and silk tapestries , the utopia of escapism. Something of this utopia lives on ... It is heightened by outward appearances. Symptomatic of the flawed and partial approach by the planning system to the retention of the tradi- tions of vernacular built form is the often confrontational relationship between planners and architects involved in developments in rural areas (Fladmark, 1988). Both professions have a remit which in- cludes the visual aesthetic of the built environment, the retention of unique aspects of "place," and building functionality in relation to users and the wider community (Eco, 1986). Yet the methodology</page><page sequence="4">Journal of Architectural and Planning Research 18:2 (Summer, 2001) 94 of the planning system, requiring conformity to "checklists" of fixed criteria, often leads to conflict between the two (Young, 1997). Whilst this paper is primarily concerned with the particular, pragmatic reasons for different percep- tions of the Scottish rural environment, others have concerned themselves with the more fundamental differences in the theory and practice of the professions. Relph (1976), for example, develops Heidegger's ideas about authentic and inauthentic views of "place," two alternative viewpoints which, Heidegger stresses, merely differ, one not being of a "higher order" or "better" than the other. Relph suggests that inauthentic experiences are casual, superficial, and partial, whilst places are seen only in terms of more or less useful features, or through an "a priori' model deriving from rigid habits of thought and behavior. He further suggests that, whilst architectural space is seen as three dimensional and experiential, planning space, or the focus of planning activity, is related to two dimensional maps and the allocation of resources. The building facade, it might be said, represents a vertical extension of such a map; the rule about its form, or the material to be used in it, and part of this allocation of resources. In the face of such a perception of place on the part of the planner, Pawley (1971) stated that: "... any empathetic feeling he may have possessed is lost outside the scope of the tunnel vision forced upon him by his methodology." Of course planners and designers are not the only parties involved in the development process. It is recognized that perhaps the key influence comes from developers, especially those responsible for the standardized "brochure" house designs which are so popular in Scotland's rural areas (Richards, 1994). With around 85% of houses in some rural areas procured on an individual basis (Shucksmith, 1990), in contrast to 9% of houses in Scotland nationally (Clapham, 1991), the developer is very often a householder with no design or construction experience. There are of course issues surrounding the nature of these individuals' engagement in a vernacular architectural process, be they indigenous rural people or urban incomers (Rapoport, 1969), as well as concerns over the preferences of mortgage lenders. Yet the current paper is more concerned with the attitudes and priorities of the professionals involved in the design and development control processes. If professional planners and designers cannot reach a consensus, there is little chance of being able to communicate a strong and consistent message to the driving forces behind development in the countryside. The research reported here suggests that, whatever the influence of different training on the percep- tion of place, there is a fundamental paradox arising from the misinterpretation of the nature of tradition within the built environment by planners. This misinterpretation leads to the UK planning system implementing policies which are diametrically opposed to some of the basic tenets of plan- ners. The research project concentrated on the built environment of a part of northeast Scotland. It is suggested that if the built environment is looked at more holistically, or "ecologically," as part of wider natural, social, and economic systems, whatever the differences in perception of "place," there is no fundamental contradiction between the precepts of architecture and other built environment disciplines and the conservationist aims of planners and others who seek to apply rules of historical precedent to determining the appropriateness of developments. THE CENTRAL PARADOX: PLANNING AND TRADITION IN THE BUILT ENVIRONMENT As regards the development of the built environment, a central plank of the British planning system has always been the sensitive incorporation of buildings into local environments (Fladmark, Mulvagh and Evans, 1991). Only the most superficial view would limit this sensitivity to the visual, aesthetic impact of buildings. Yet aesthetics are undoubtedly an important, perhaps disproportionately impor- tant, aspect of the process. For planners, perhaps the central measure by which the success of proposed buildings is judged in this regard is precedent. The appropriateness of built form is</page><page sequence="5">Journal of Architectural and Planning Research 18:2 (Summer, 2001) 95 measured against, not a single precedent, but long lines of precedent. It is judged by its ability to conform to, or at least meld with, local tradition. It is often unclear what particular historical period is referred to in this construction of a tradition which seeks to express a temporal continuity. Indeed Lowenthal (1985) suggests that this apparent continuity is often not a continuum but a "diachrony," the reconstruction of a moment in the relative- ly distant past in the buildings of the present. He employs an anthropomorphic metaphor for the built environment and suggests that, whilst the world of our parents may appear "admonitory" and con- straining, images from our grandparents' era are both charming and under our control (Lowenthal, 1985). The metaphor certainly has some credence in Scotland's rural environment where "tradition" repre- sents an interrupted continuity with a past which, like the formal definition of an "antique," came to an abrupt end a hundred years ago. Lowenthal goes so far as to defend such reconstructions of a supposed past. He considers that even the most superficial renditions of "tradition," the "mock- Tudor" and "ye old-English" cottage, represent an, albeit misinformed, homage to a plural historical heritage. Their very lightheartedness, he suggests, may commend them over more serious and laborious attempts to reconstruct the past (Lowenthal, 1985). Many of course, including most planners, who would not like to see themselves as champions of "Disneyfication," might balk at the amusement of the kitsch as the driving force behind the creation of our built environments. Others have argued that the basing of our rules and standards for built form on historical precedent is not a prescription for good architecture. Adorno (1979), for example, is dismissive of: ... professions who , with their eyes raised to heaven , spew forth formalistic laws of eternal and everlasting beauty, which are no more than recipes for the production of ephemeral , classicist kitsch. Beyond the somewhat theoretical, aesthetic judgments of some academic commentators on architec- ture, there may seem to be little wrong with a model which follows tradition and establishes itself through precedent. Emulating tradition will be likely to produce results which are both consistent with that tradition and, since the tradition has evolved to meet local circumstances, are appropriate to their immediate environment. At the same time it is not, perhaps, fair to criticize planners for being Lud- dites, overly occupied with potentially stagnant preservation. To conform too rigidly to tradition would, of course, be counter-productive, so the planning system recognizes changing technology, standards, and aspirations. Adherence to tradition is therefore largely confined to predominantly visual criteria. Yet it is suggested that this very confinement of precedent to visual aspects of the surface patina is serving to stifle necessary change and innovation in the rural environment. New buildings are likely to be required to conform to certain constraints regarding placing; overall form; and some detail design such as the design of windows, materials, and color. Such constraints have, in the past, been codified in numerous design guides, be they advisory or more stringently applied, which typically make liberal reference to precedent, often including specific historical ex- amples (Moray District Council, 1993; Perth and Kinross District Council, 1990; Gordon District Council, 1980). Such guides are, of course, open to Heidegger's charge of "inauthenticity" in their attempt to reflect the particularities of place at a regional scale (Relph, 1976). Where they attempt to replicate anachronistic features from the past they may open themselves to Ruskin's more scathing criticism: As for direct and simple copying , it is palpably impossible ... There was yet in the old some life , some mysterious suggestion of what it had beeny and of what it had lost ; some sweetness in the gentle lines which rain and sun had wrought. There can be none in the brute hardness of the new Carving. (Ruskin, n.d.)</page><page sequence="6">Journal of Architectural and Planning Research 18:2 (Summer, 2001) 96 Perhaps more substantially, the results of the research reported on here suggest that the blinkered, historicist perspective is positively damaging in its opposition to genuine local vernaculars and the natural, social, and economic systems which continue to evolve them. It is clear that planning decisions on matters of architecture are strongly guided by the perceived nature of local vernacular architecture. There is, of course, in Britain as elsewhere, no objective, immutable data base available to tell people precisely what this vernacular tradition consists of in different local areas. Instead, planners and others rely on two broad types of information for their definitions: personal, ad hoc , anecdotal observation and published material on the nature of the build- ing stock. In the areas of rural Scotland in which the research was based, this published information consists predominantly of a number of key texts by respected academic commentators (Naismith, 1989; Fladmark, et al ., 1991; Brunskill, 1982; Fenton, 1981; Morton, 1976; Walker, 1979). These texts serve to define the landscape of appropriate rural built form. They are drawn on both subliminal- ly, in the formation of perceptions of the rural built environment, and overtly, in the construction of planning guidelines (The Scottish Office, 1991; Moray District Council, 1993; Richards, 1994). These and other texts do not, of course, have the power to legislate on matters of "good taste," but they do, it is argued, have a profound effect on the perception of what constitutes the vernacular architectures of our rural areas. They serve to disseminate images of a historical tradition and describe these images in terms of local vernaculars. It is argued that such a visually driven, historicist percep- tion of the vernacular is fundamentally flawed. It stems from a misinterpretation of the real nature of vernacular architecture and leads to the imposition of standards which owe little to, indeed may be diametrically opposed to, the reality of the vernacular tradition and to sensitive, ecologically ap- propriate development. This central paradox is compounded by a number of other apparent or actual paradoxes which serve to ensure that vernacular architecture is actively discouraged by the agencies of development control in the UK. These paradoxes are in the interface between the planning system and other arms of governance. They lie in the well rehearsed arguments about the inability of the British planning system to be proactive and its restriction to being a mere prophylactic on development. They lie in contradictions between the aims of planning and, for example, fiscal measures (Edge and Duncan, 1996). Yet the heart of the problem lies in the fact that the planning system itself willfully legislates against appropriate, vernacular, ecologically sound modes of development. To understand why this should be the case, it is necessary to explore the real nature of vernacular architecture as it has evolved over time in contrast to the way in which the planning system has sought to impose its own view of the vernacular. AN ECOLOGICAL PERSPECTIVE ON VERNACULAR ARCHITECTURE Architecture has its origins as a community-based craft. Yet the Greek meaning of the word architek- ton , referring to one who directs craftsmen or tektons was lost in the early middle ages, and these links both to craft and community have become progressively weaker. Most definitions of vernacular architecture incorporate ideas about local provision for local need, and lay involvement in design and building (Edge and Milner, 1996). Typically, the vernacular building is occupied and managed by much the same sort of people who designed it and built it (Rapoport, 1969). As the world has become more complex and pluralistic, roles have become more specialized and professionalized, and "amateurism" has become a pejorative word. Following the Renaissance, which championed the ar- chitect as individual, by linking the discipline to the rational or "higher" sciences and disassociating it from more "lowly" building work, architecture became codified until, steeped in a Beaux Arts tradi- tion, it retained few traces of its practical origins in self-provision of locally appropriate buildings (Favro, 1989).</page><page sequence="7">Journal of Architectural and Planning Research 18:2 (Summer, 2001) 97 This process, and the process of the internationalization of architecture, was what demanded the inception of the idea of vernacular architecture. The vernacular, the older rural vernacular in par- ticular, becomes, by implication, the "non-professional," the "ordinary." Remaining within this earlier tradition of architecture then, local vernacular forms developed around the need to optimize the economics of the time. They were local in the sense of meeting local need and local economic circumstances, not through a desire to reflect any local aesthetic. Whilst in many parts of the world certain aesthetic criteria may have infiltrated the local vernacular, for cultural or religious reasons, these criteria were rarely the driving force behind the evolution of built form (Eco, 1986). Vernacular forms arose in response to local criteria as regards social need and organization, climate, technology, materials availability, local economy, and the local skills base. In so far as these criteria may have changed little over periods of hundreds of years, the evolved vernacular form may also have changed little. Where there were changes in these criteria or in the local autonomy of economic and social systems, the vernacular evolved to meet these changing demands. Thus, in rural Scotland for example, local turf may have been abandoned as a roofing material in favour of slate from farther afield, whilst windows became larger with the regional availability of glass and joinery techniques relied on steel nails and screws imported into the local area (Richards and Richards, 1994). In this sense, few vernacular forms in the UK are truly local in the sense of being created out of an entirely autonomous local economy. This is clearly also the case elsewhere in the world. Upton (1982), for example, writing about the farm buildings of Virginia, noted that a persuasive definition of vernacular architecture is that vernacular buildings are localized versions of more widely known forms. Vernacular forms grow out of tradition in the sense that their evolution has generally been over many generations and that they were rarely codified; their techniques were not written down and legislated for. They are also traditional in the sense that their definition precludes the idea of fashion. Theoreti- cally at least, "pure" vernacular architecture, if such a phenomenon can be said to exist, is delimited by practical and local considerations, not by externally inspired trends and subjective criteria. We should not forget that many old buildings in many countries are, by contrast, primarily products of the fashion of a particular time. Crucially, vernacular forms have evolved to meet the circumstances of particular times and, of course, they are still evolving. Local traditions in building are specifically contemporary; they are of a par- ticular time. Any overall definition of the vernacular must be able to accommodate the idea of change over time to meet changing local criteria. This requirement that buildings reflect contemporary local need begs two questions: How appropriate is it to judge vernacular form in terms of the strict applica- tion of visual precedent? What sorts of buildings constitute the vernacular of the Scottish rural areas of the 1990s? The key thing about vernacular buildings is that they are able to respond to the changing, contem- porary needs of local communities in the context of particular places. Even those with a historicist approach to the built environment can appreciate this need to accommodate change. For example, Lowenthal (1985) draws a parallel between our cultural and biological legacies. He points out that both are inheritable yet both are undergoing necessary continual revision and that we require both stability and change. We must transform or replace the values we inherit from the past, yet if we are to cope with change we also need considerable continuity with that past (Lowenthal, 1985). Thus true vernacular buildings are able to interface with changing local natural, physical, social, and economic environments. A holistic approach needs to be taken to the definition of what constitutes the vernacular in relation to these criteria. In the sense that vernacular architecture relates so strongly to place and evolves in response to complex, changing local systems, it is fundamentally ecological in its approach (Odum, 1959). If our understanding of the vernacular is to encompass more than simply a visual image of a building facade, if the built environment is to be truly fitted to the landscape, or rather the land, then it must be seen to respond holistically to this wider ecological system. In this endeavor, ecological design has come a long way since Habermas (1982) characterized it as "the 'Alternative Architecture' which is based on the problems of ecology and of the preservation of</page><page sequence="8">Journal of Architectural and Planning Research 18:2 (Summer, 2001) 98 historically developed urban districts." He considered this "alternative" to be backward looking and lumped it in with trends towards "neo-historicism" and "the language of stage-set architecture." To discuss ecological approaches to design in the same breath as mere preservation of the old is to ignore the possibility of radical change in local natural, social, and economic environments, implicit in ecological systems thinking. In the words of Van der Ryn (1996): "Thinking ecologically about design is a way of strengthening the weave that links nature and culture." It is argued that the current regulatory system in Scotland, overall and in the minutiae of its im- plementation, is not suited to a developing, contemporary, non-professional vernacular built form. It seems certain that the same failings exist in the parallel systems elsewhere in the UK. Further re- search would need to be carried out to confirm the existence of similar problems in other countries where regulatory systems are not necessarily so constrained by visual criteria. THE PLANNING APPROACH TO LOCAL VERNACULARS In contrast to the holistic definition, which considers whole buildings within a complex and changing system, it is suggested that the approach to the vernacular taken by the planning system, within the UK at least, is reductionist, fixed in a partial historical view and based too simply on the inadequate visual images criticized by Relph (1976) and Pawley (1971). The system is reductionist in the sense that it seeks to render vernacular form into a series of simple, prescriptive rules about the specification of parts of a building. A dormer window must conform to a particular design, walling materials must conform to a supposed historical norm, roof tiles must be of a particular color, buildings may be no more than two stories high, and so on. In the extreme, timber framed houses heated only by electricity are required to have a timber framed fake chimney at either end to conform to this reductionist vision of a cottage aesthetic (Young, 1997). Jarman (1993) sug- gests that tinkering with an inherently poor design usually leads to an unsatisfactory result, citing the use of false stone quoins on the corner of suburban kit bungalows, whilst in the words of McKean (1993): "In desperation some planners ... reacted by imposing restriction; the invention of a ver- nacular, of keeping in keeping-of, in short, faking up the past." Too often these rules and guidelines are generated in isolation from wider, contemporary local systems and architectural issues. An under- standing of and respect for local vernaculars may provide a sound basis for policy, but applying a list of vernacular details cannot be expected necessarily to produce designs of quality (Richards and Richards, 1994). As has been stated, perceptions of what constitutes the vernacular may often be generated by refer- ence to the only universally available baselines, the published works on the subject. In this sense, it is argued, rational definitions of local building traditions are reduced to two criteria: vernacular build- ings are old buildings and vernacular buildings are those which have survived the ravages of time. Our vision of this historical heritage will depend on where in the world we live. Lowenthal (1985) suggests, for example, that there is a peculiar continuity of historical perspective in the politically stable environment of England, with a thousand years of architectural heritage relatively uninterrupted by major destructive upheavals. An Egyptian, on the other hand, may very well be able to separate the buildings of the present from the historical monuments of four thousand years ago, to which they bear not the slightest resemblance. Scotland differs from England somewhat in the respect that rela- tively few of the vernacular structures dating from before 1750 have survived (Dunbar, 1966), leaving a relatively closely defined temporal window through which to view history. A corollary of this view, based on the survival of buildings, is that the vernacular may, perversely, become redefined to en- compass almost exclusively professional buildings. According to Steinitz (1983), published studies on vernacular architecture are not egalitarian but are involved largely with the architecture of an elite. They deal with surviving historical buildings, which are the largest and most substantial, the truly ordinary structures having vanished.</page><page sequence="9">Journal of Architectural and Planning Research 18:2 (Summer, 2001) 99 Ideas about vernacular as they are disseminated into design guides and the actual control process on the ground become limited to a flawed vision of supposed tradition. This vision manifests itself only as a preference for particular visual images or symbols. These environmental symbols, as Rowntree and Conkey (1980) suggest, have strong potential to create and communicate temporal depth. In this context, a symbol is a part of the design that has the power to suggest a whole and calls to mind a succession of phenomena that are related ontologically and metaphorically (Tuan, 1974). No account is taken of contemporary need to respond to local economics, materials availability, skills base, or technological change. The roots of tradition, in the non-professional self-provision of housing, are forgotten. Buildability is not a planning consideration, and the modern exponents of local vernacular building are thereby discouraged. Architecture is clearly a matter for the professional who knows how to create buildings which will conform to the current rules about tradition. Local economic systems and affordability are not variables in a system which tries to emulate a built environment created in the economic cir- cumstances of previous centuries. The authors identified the need to explore this dichotomy, between rational constructs of continuing vernacular tradition and the way in which such traditions are enshrined in our regulatory systems, perhaps as a response to the real or perceived cultural stress occasioned by the pressures of develop- ment (Rowntree and Conkey, 1980). As Lowenthal (1975) notes: "In times of stress, nations safeguard the physical legacy that embodies their communal spirit." PRACTICAL VERNACULARS: A STUDY OF RURAL BUILDINGS It was decided to carry out a study of the nature of vernacular buildings in one area of Scotland, in rural Aberdeenshire. The researchers were concerned that published information presented a skewed view of what constituted this vernacular. It was therefore decided to draw information from two sources. Firstly, a literature review was carried out from which was drawn a sample of literature which professed to portray a view of the vernacular buildings of rural Scotland and, in particular, northeast Scotland. The criteria determining the choice of this sample were that the literature should overtly claim an interest in what constituted a rural vernacular and present drawn or photographic visual evidence of such buildings. The use of photographic and drawn material does not, of course, allow the study to take account of the subtleties of the argument contained in the text of the documents studied. It was, however, considered to be an appropriate methodology to portray the overall view of what was felt to be "good practice" in rural design. The choice of visual imagery in this literature betrays, it is argued, subliminal views of what constitutes the rural vernacular, independent of any theoretical arguments. The use of such visual imagery, as opposed to written text, also permits com- parison with buildings in the field, which do not, of course, have a textual component. The buildings thus portrayed were then categorized in terms of a number of simple variables which described their overall natures. These variables were the following: overall building use, age, plan size and shape, number of stories, roof shape, and predominant walling and roofing materials. Secondly, the same methodology was mirrored on the ground. A series of ten sample areas were selected, each area equidistant along a sixty mile linear transept leading west out of Aberdeen. This region was chosen because it contains areas of particular natural beauty and conservation interest. One of the sample areas drawn from this regional population, for example, was within a mile of the Queen's house at Balmoral. This choice of population was felt to be important in order to avoid the potential charge of pandering to the lowest common denominator - of choosing areas of no architec- tural or historical interest. Each sample area was delineated to encompass the same number of build- ings. It was felt that this structured sampling method was best able to reflect a possible range of building types from urban fringe areas, through smaller villages, to very remote locations. Each of the</page><page sequence="10">Journal of Architectural and Planning Research 18:2 (Summer, 2001) 100 two hundred buildings in the sample areas was photographed and exactly the same information ex- tracted as for the survey of publications. With the proviso that it contains a particularly large number of sites of historical interest, the field study area can be considered to be typical of the wider geographical area in which the literature studies are set. More work would be required to confirm the results over a wider area and in other countries. The study was, of course, itself both reductionist and restricted to simple visual charac- teristics of buildings, reflecting a desire to target the key, expressed concerns of the authors of the building studies. It is argued that whilst appropriate vernacular forms cannot be constructed through such a patchwork approach to the visual appearance of buildings, a simple empirical study can pro- vide valid evidence for current constructs of the vernacular. This approach revealed very considerable differences between the reality of the built environment and its portrayal in the literature. How much of this environment can be considered to consist of genuinely vernacular buildings is a moot point. IMAGES OF THE VERNACULAR: THE SNAP-SHOT VIEW OF HISTORY Analysis of the data from the sample of publications revealed a very consistent set of characteristics in the buildings portrayed, both within and between the different works. To summarize the key results of the study, the sample of five key publications (Naismith, 1989; Fladmark, et al ., 1991; Fenton and Walker, 1981; Brunskill, 1987; Morton, 1976) concentrated heavily on certain building types which, though common enough in the countryside, in no sense represent the norm of vernacular architecture. Firstly, in terms of overall building use, despite a professed interest in "farm buildings," houses were grossly over-represented in the publications by a factor of more than three. The houses were mostly old, with over twice as many buildings in the publications as on the ground dating from before this century. In particular, change in the built environment between around 1900 and 1980 is under-repre- sented. In so far as it is mentioned at all in these texts, it is often to be deplored as the death of good vernacular design. In addition, the publications sampled buildings which, on average, were much larger than their counterparts in the field study, thus tending to emphasize more professional, rather than truly vernacular buildings. The vast majority of the buildings portrayed in the literature had pitched roofs clad in slate, a stereotypical image which, in reality, only represents about a quarter of the buildings on the ground. In particular, the books studied took little account of the many unusual roof profiles and coverings found in the rich and varied building stock on the ground. Similarly, masonry walling was over-represented in the publications by a factor of exactly two. With 80% of the received images consisting of masonry buildings, Richards and Richards (1994) are able to write, "Undoubtedly the main contributor to the Scottish vernacular has been the use of stone for walls." Later they expand, "The character of local vernacular housebuilding varies across Scotland. It is generally based on the dominant influence of load-bearing stone masonry construction. In settle- ments, and sometimes over a wider area, this often results in consistency in scale, shape, proportions, materials and color." The reality is that only 40% of buildings in the sample areas are constructed of masonry. In terms of "materials and color," only 22% have unrendered stone finishes. One of the most significant results of the study, the details of which make the dangers of such inaccuracies clear, was the difference between the proportion of timber clad buildings in the field and that represented in the literature. Only 3% of the buildings from the published works were clad in timber, whilst in the field timber formed the most common single walling material, making up 38% of the sample. We are presented with an image of Scottish vernacular traditions which almost exclusively comprises substantial, old masonry constructions. These are, of course, the buildings with the greatest physical "staying power." They are, as physical entities, if not necessarily as habitable buildings, longer lived without maintenance than other constructions. On the other hand they do not represent, and have not represented for centuries, the primary vernacular tradition of the area. Again buildability, the pos-</page><page sequence="11">Journal of Architectural and Planning Research 18:2 (Summer, 2001) 101 sibility of non-professional self-provision, change in material availability and economic circumstance are ignored in favor of a fixed historical vision of tradition. It may have been that, as Rowntree and Conkey (1980) noted in their urban study, in the generation of the original, traditional vernacular forms, the primary agents of symbolic action were individuals, ad hoc groups and populations at social margins. In our legislation for the reconstruction of the symbols of that tradition, however, the symbols are widely understood, accepted, and sanctified. Structural and institutional changes have taken place to maintain the symbol system through the enforcement of legal, political, and other sanctions (Rowntree and Conkey, 1980). Though by no means a panacea, there are many sound ecological and other reasons for using, for example, timber in construction. There is much to be said against the creation of a built environment which is solid, fixed, and immutable, leaving us, in the long term, with monumental hunks of rotting concrete littering the countryside, to be dealt with throughout the next century. Yet the message being handed down to us is clear: "Tradition is good and tradition means solidity and permanence, 'proper' buildings, properly built by 'professionals,' not wooden sheds knocked together by farmers!" Again the vision of the vernacular runs directly contrary to actual vernacular tradition. Overall, the vision presented by these few publications is remarkably consistent. For example, 84% of the buildings presented exhibited four or more common characteristics in the eight variables detailed above. In the field there was more diversity, with only 55% having four or more common variables. This simplification of the rural building stock is made easier by taking a historical viewpoint which, like the arbitrary definition of an "antique," places a buffer zone of a century between ourselves and what can be classed as our vernacular tradition: desirable tradition is the province of our grandparents and great-grandparents, not our "merely unfashionable" parents (Lowenthal, 1985). With increasing age comes decreasing diversity, not because such diversity did not exist historically, but because only certain kinds of buildings have survived. Those which have survived and therefore provide us with a touchstone for the vernacular are large, substantial, masonry constructions, mostly professionally designed and built, often by the larger estate owners. Many exhibit some characteristics of the inter- national, fashionable architectures of their time, or make sentimental reference, of the type that Ador- no (1979) would have abhorred, to local, apparently vernacular forms. These then are the images of buildings in the countryside which are passed into the collective psyche. Or rather, these are the images which, we are persuaded, constitute good, appropriate design. There is little to define this appropriateness other than that the precedents exist and precedents which do not fit the historical view are glossed over or ignored. What then does constitute truly vernacular built form, particularly in the region in which the study was carried out? Whilst carrying out the buildings study near Aberdeen, the researchers were puzzled to find, in one of the sample areas, an unusual material used as cladding for many walls and roofs. It was roughly flattened sheet steel, not corrugated but with several low, regular ridges, spaced apart, running down the length of each sheet. It was found on quite new buildings, but also on buildings dating from the turn of the century. Despite being common in one survey area, it was not found at all in any of the other nine. Some local enquiries established the source of this material. The sample area is a couple of miles from an old, recently demolished paper mill. For generations, local people used the redundant steel drums, formerly containers for the variety of chemicals imported to the mill, as a building material. They would cut them open, beat them flat, and use them for covering walls and roofs. This is a truly local vernacular. It makes efficient use of locally available recycled materials. It is economically driven and involves self-pro vision by local people. It has the weight of history behind it. Yet it owes nothing to the clichÃ© of a "cottage vernacular." Most of our vernacular styles grow from such oppor- tunistic beginnings. The fact that the source of the material is originally external to the area and that it is overtly industrial changes nothing. Flattened steel drums are as much a part of local vernacular tradition as stone rubble walls; far more so than, for example, Welsh slates. Ironically, the existence of this particular local supply chain makes a building clad in steel sheet more essentially part of the</page><page sequence="12">Journal of Architectural and Planning Research 18:2 (Summer, 2001) 102 vernacular, in this one heavily forested rural area, than the build- ing next door, clad in timber im- ported from Scandinavia. VERNACULAR BUILDINGS IN A RURAL LANDSCAPE If we want rural built environments to reflect any more meaningful qualities than simple conformity to a "checklist" of visual criteria based on dubious historical prece- dent, then we must address the issue, not only of what vernacular traditions are or have been, but what they will be. We must accept that some of the change which oc- casions cultural stress is inevitable and to be desired. Rowntree and Conkey (1980) suggest that, in its broadest sense, stress is synonymous with selection pres- sure and that, given that human en- vironments are always changing, some degree of stress is always present within our socio-cultural systems. We must approach tradi- tion and "appropriateness" from a holistic, contemporary standpoint, accepting necessary change at a fundamental level. We should not just be forcing the technology, society, and economics of now and the future into "bouncy castle" ar- chitecture of make-believe farm cottages with a patina of supposed tradition thinly applied to them. This is not, particularly, an appeal for radical architecture in the countryside. Rather it is an argu- ment in favor of tradition and the vernacular. FIGURE 3. "Bouncy castle architecture": Fake stone, concrete roof tiles and a "Georgian" front door on new housing which bears little relation to any true vernacular architecture. FIGURE 4. Vernacular architectures: Timber is the most common wall cladding material, particularly for buildings not controlled by planning legislation, such as these large agricultural buildings. At the moment, the flawed, piecemeal, and partial analysis of a supposed vernacular results, in Scot- land at least, in particular types of structure on the ground. In the area where the study was carried out, as elsewhere, this means new houses with particular characteristics. They are generally of rectan- gular plan with a chimney at one or both ends. They have an outer concrete block skin and are colored gray; any shade of gray will do. This is felt to reflect the natural color of stone. They have gray concrete tiles, again to imitate the color of stone slates. They have double glazed plastic win- dows, with fake astragals in imitation of buildings of the last century. The reality is that they often do not have open fires, the chimneys being redundant. The local stone through much of the area is pink granite. The masonry skin may in fact be redundant since the</page><page sequence="13">FIGURE 5.

Vernacular architectures: Much of the truly vernacular architecture of the past has not had the permanence of some more professional buildings. Journal of Architectural and Planning Research 18:2 (Summer, 2001) 103 structure is of timber frame. The concrete roofing tiles add further to the weight of imported, environ- mentally inappropriate, non-tradi- tional materials. The plastic win- dows imitate tradition only visual- ly, and even then only if seen from a distance of over a hundred yards in bad light. The fake astragals are, of course, also redundant. In all other respects they do not approach any vernacular tradition. Their scale is utterly different to that of older buildings in the landscape. Their width in plan, and the pitch of their roofs, is determined by the optimum span of manufactured timber trusses. Typically they are raised a meter or more above ground level, making them entirely out of scale with what went before. Often they are positioned in a wholly different way to former buildings on the same site. They may be sited so as to optimize the view from the living room, for ex- ample, rather than to maximize shelter from the wind. Yet if the developer has been able to satisfy the requirements of the checklist of pseudo-vernacular characteristics, the building will be deemed to be appropriate to its rural setting. It is no more a building in sympathy with its environment and ver- nacular traditions than an inflatable, bouncy castle would be. It is a building which arises from a whol- ly "inauthentic" experience of the place in which it exists. To reiterate, vernacular tradition cannot be rendered down into a checklist of visual characteristics. The vernacular is much more about process than about product. It arises from the complex natural, social, and economic systems within which it exists. It has its roots in the non-professional, locally appropriate provision of shelter. Often this has been self-provision. It is fundamentally economically, not aesthetically, driven. It therefore is contemporary; it accommodates change to meet the particular circumstances of particular times. For hundreds of years rural areas, in Britain as elsewhere, have not operated as autonomous economies. Their connection to the wider national and international economy has grown over the years. This has resulted in the predominant form of construction for isolated houses in Scotland's countryside becoming manufactured, standardized, timber frame "kit" housing. In the sense that this form of construction is driven by economics, procured locally, and the most common form of self- provision and self-build, it might be said to represent a new vernacular form, despite its national and international uniformity. The standard timber kit is widely vilified as a blot on Britain's rural</page><page sequence="14">Journal of Architectural and Planning Research 18:2 (Summer, 2001) 104 landscape, and to describe it as a vernacular tradition is a serious heresy in the eyes of both planners and architects (Alldridge, 1993). Yet the primary way in which the proliferation of these "blots" on the landscape is resisted is their regulation in accordance with the visual checklist (Richards and Richards, 1994). A form which has grown through local preference and economic circumstances is forced, kicking and struggling, into the mold of a supposed cottage vernacular with the attendant problems which Ruskin (no date) associated with the copy, Adorno (1979) with formalistic laws, and Pawley (1971) with the "tunnel vision" of methodology. The form of construction, still proliferates, but is made less economically viable, less environmentally appropriate, and less open to local self- provision. Such artificial regulation is no substitute for good architecture which recognizes change in vernacular tradition. Contrast current practice with the use of the most common walling material found in the buildings study, for example. Timber cladding can be, though it is not necessarily, an environmentally, locally appropriate material. Many designers have raised questions about the substances used to preserve much of it (Liddell, 1997), and some 86% of timber in UK construction is imported (Varley and Pendlebury, 1997). Yet timber has the potential to be a much more acceptable material than its alternatives. Designers with an interest in appropriate, local provision of buildings, who would describe themselves as ecological designers, are looking for ways of employing local timber without preservatives (Van der Ryn, 1996). This kind of design is consistent with the economics of the cheapest available structural forms, local availability of materials, the idea of local self-provision, and wider, global environmental concerns. It is also consistent, in the area studied in the research, with the predominant vernacular tradition. It does not, however, conform to the "checklist" approach to design favored by planners whose view of vernacular tradition is conditioned by biased, partial im- ages of the rural built environment. So planners and architects find themselves in conflict with one another. The concerns which drive them, their deeper, philosophical aims, are identical. Yet the directions from which they approach the problem are diametrically opposed, and the ways in which they conceive of place, as experiential and three dimensional or as an allocative resource, are incompatible (Relph, 1976). That vernacular tradi- tions are alive, if not necessarily entirely healthy, is testified to by the continuing growth of self-build and other forms of self-provision of housing. Though the UK has less self-build than many other European countries and much less than countries in other parts of the world, it is a growing phenomenon (Daligan, 1996). What these kinds of vernacular tradition require is not resistance from planning authorities which are pushing to professionalize rural building, but encouragement. Such encouragement must arise from a deeper understanding of, and empathy with, the realities of chang- ing vernacular tradition. If the rural environment is filled with corrugated iron shacks, we do not need to shrug our shoulders and admit that, therefore, such shacks are an appropriate form of development. We do, however, need to recognize the strength of real vernacular traditions. Planners and designers with an interest in environmentally sensitive buildings need to work together to ensure that such traditions can move forward in creating an appropriate, locally responsive rural built environment. The systems approach of ecological design, in particular, is working towards this end and may offer mechanisms for the more sensitive application of precedent to planning decisions. In particular, it is important to recog- nize that ecological design is neither, as in Habermas' (1982) conception, preoccupied with "preserva- tion," nor solely concerned with natural environments. Rather it is an evolutionary systems approach which aims to take account of the connections between local economic, social, as well as biological systems. CONCLUSIONS The research reported on here strongly suggests that the vision of acceptable rural development presented by literature and transferred to the development control process is a flawed and partial one,</page><page sequence="15">Journal of Architectural and Planning Research 18:2 (Summer, 2001) 105 based on a limited view of historical precedent. The broad cultural rationale for such an approach is also clear. Lowenthal (1985), for example, suggests that: Many literate societies ... cling to supposedly timeless values and unbroken lineages that link them with history. Restoring lost or subverted values and institutions is a ... mode of validation. A remote past legitimates and fortifies the present order against subsequent mishap or corruption. Thus Renaissance humanists looked beyond the dark ages of evil and oblivion to the classical glories they aimed to reanimate. Foucault (1985) describes such a strategy as the pursuit of "Heterotopias" in cultures under stress: The idea of accumulating everything ...of creating a sort of universal archive , the desire to enclose all times , all eras , forms and styles within a single place , the concept of making all times into one place , and yet a place that is outside time , inaccessible to the wear and tear of the years , according to a plan of almost perpetual and unlimited accumulation within an irremovable placef all this belongs entirely to our modern outlook. The purely architectural cost of such a backward looking, historicist approach to the idea of the vernacular is clear, as are the costs in terms of economic and social development. For many years practically all serious thinking on the whole range of rural development issues throughout the world has stressed the need for local control, sustainability, and "bottom-up" approaches (Pearce, et al ., 1989; Harrison, 1987; MacPherson, 1982). Only the most sentimental of opinions holds that such development should be based in a static, historicist view which precludes change and appropriate elements of modernization. Ecological approaches to the design of the built environment reflect this and are as concerned with issues at the interface between buildings and the wider environment and community as are planners. This extends beyond building as process and product, to social and com- munity involvement, in such fields as community architecture, design participation, and universal design. Yet the British planning system reacts by pulling in the designers' reins. Arguably, it also puts on the blinkers and limits vision of the building to a thin facade. This facade represents a highly inauthentic vision of "place" on the part of the planning system and leads to a preponderance of inappropriate, "other-directed" architecture (Relph, 1976). In Scotland, faced with increasing development pressure from one particular, economically driven, and universal design type, the "off-the-shelf' timber framed "kit" house, continuing concern about the rural house is now manifesting itself in a search by central government for alternative principles upon which to base the planning decision-making process (Scottish Office, 1998). The approach of appeal- ing to a partial historical precedent based on a "checklist" of some simple visual criteria is increasing- ly being seen as a flawed one and a more "ecological," systems-based view of the idea of precedent is one alternative being put forward. Under this approach the principle of precedent can still be applied to ensure the retention of fundamental aspects of "place," but in a much more holistic yet flexible way, respecting the past without stifling change and innovation. A possible mechanism for the application of this alternative method of regulating development relies on the consideration of particular rural environments as consisting of a series of different functional systems. For example, one might consider a locale to consist of an ecological system, comprising the biological and physical natural environment; a social system; an economic system, including local agricultural and land management structures; and an "architectural system," comprising the entire built heritage of an area. The idea of precedent and hence the appropriateness of a particular develop- ment proposal might then be applied to any or all of these systems. For example, the rationale for the use of a particular material, say local timber cladding, might lie not in the architectural system, that is extant historical buildings, but in the ecological system that is the existence of a sustainable local resource. Similarly, the use of an atypical architectural form might be partially justified by an appeal to precedent in the local economic system, where the designer is aiming for buildability in a crofting area with a history of self-build and self-provision of housing. If, let us say, a development can be justified by reference to two of these systems - either the ecological or the architectural system, as well as either the social or the economic system - then a</page><page sequence="16">Journal of Architectural and Planning Research 18:2 (Summer, 2001) 106 series of alternative routes for gaining planning permission opens up. We are still able to prescribe acceptable architectural form, but in a more holistic way, whilst operating a more liberal, less dic- tatorial system which recognizes innovation and the fact that there is a variety of valid rationales for carrying out development. The possible alternative systems suggested by the research are still at an early stage of development, but in broad terms the ecological approach offers a rational alternative to current methods in rural environments experiencing unprecedented conflict between the desire to retain a sense of place based on continuity with the past and the pressure for change. Truly vernacular activity is characterized by an authentic view of place and a genuine, uncodified concern with all the aspects of that place. In the words of Nietzsche, "It makes all the difference in the world whether a thinker stands in personal relation to his problems, in which he sees his destiny, his need and his higher happiness, or can only feel and grasp them impersonally, with the tentacles of cold, prying thought" (quoted in Relph, 1976). If we choose not to be driven by such lofty sentiments, then perhaps we can be embarrassed out of our sycophantic predilection for supposed vernaculars of the past by Julian Barnes (1984), who wrote in Flaubert' s Parrot : The present looks back at some great figure of an earlier century and wonders , was he on our side? Was he a goodie? What a lack of self-confidence this implies: the present wants both to patronize the past by adjudicating on its political acceptability , and also to be flattered by it, to be patted on the back and told to keep up the good work. At their foundations, and despite differences imbued in their training, the aims of planners and responsible designers are not really so far apart. Together they must look long and hard at what the real strengths of our vernacular traditions are, if they do not want the countryside littered with the concrete equivalents of bouncy castle architecture.
