<plain_text><page sequence="1">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2006-2007 By James Whitley, Sophia Germanidou, Dusanka Urem-Kotsou, Anastasia Dimoula, Irene Nikolakopoulou, Artemis Karnava and Don Evely INTRODUCTION In previous issues of Archaeology in Greece I have tried to draw attention, not so much to individual discoveries, as to trends. I have argued that it is the aggregate picture, more than the unique find, that summaries such as Archaeology in Greece are best at drawing attention to. Previous issues have drawn attention to the explosion of MPal finds in Greece, to the slow accumulation of evidence for the colonization of the Cyclades in the Neo and for widespread settlement during the MH; not to mention the significance of the cluster of EIA sites on either side of the Euboic gulf (Oropos, Eretria, Lefkandi and Mitrou). This emphasis on the aggregate picture in no way invalidates individual discoveries. Indeed, sometimes, the finds from a single site can change the terms of some very longstanding debates. In this issue of Archaeology in Greece there are four such sites, whose excavation and subsequent interpretation challenge longstanding views on at least four periods in Gr prehistory and history. In chronological order, these are: the Theopetra cave in Thessaly; the site of Daskalio-Kavos on Keros in the Cyclades; the sanctuary of Kalapodi in anc. Phokis, mod. Phthiotis; and the anc. city of Tegea in Arkadia. The strata in the Theopetra cave, carefully investigated by Nina Kyparissi-Apostolika, reveal continuity of occupation (perhaps not uninterrupted) from the MPal through to the ENeo. It is one of the few occupation sites in Greece which has a well-defined Mes stratum, a stratum that seems to precede the earliest ENeo. It is in this Mes stratum that some coarse pottery has turned up. Pottery, of course, is usually thought to be a Neo technology, introduced into Greece along with the whole Neo technological and cultural package from the Near East. That 'the Neolithic' was introduced wholesale, as a cultural/techno logical package, probably as the result of a migration (or 'demie diffusion'), remains the majority (if not quite the orthodox) view. These finds from the Theopetra cave, especially if their date is confirmed by thermoluminescence dating, would point either to the independent invention of this technology, or to a period of acculturation and co-existence between native Mes and immigrant Neo groups. The 'Special Deposit' from Kavos on Keros, currently being investigated by Colin Renfrew and his team, is also proving controversial. The deposit represents the largest concentration of Cyc marble figurines anywhere. These figurines, highly esteemed by the major art museums of the world, are often interpreted as either burial goods or cult images. The figurines from Kavos were all found carefully broken - the excavator thinks, first, that they were broken in antiquity, and, second, that they were broken elsewhere (and not in situ) before being deposited in Kavos. Colin Renfrew believes he can exclude the possibility of their being the product of a looting of a nearby cemetery, and that their breakage and deposition represents an E (and uniquely Cyc) form of EBA cult practice (or 'structured deposition'). It does not follow, however, that Kavos itself was a cult site. To the Cl archaeologist, the analogy that presents itself almost irre sistibly is the purification trench on Rheneia, the island next to the sanctuary of Delos. The purification trench, conducted under the supervision of the Athenians in 425 BC (Thuc 1.8.2; 3.104-1-3), and the broken state of the objects (often originally from graves) was not in this case the result of primary ('cult') but secondary ('purificatory') deposition. In any case, Cyc figurines can no longer be viewed as objects whose function was single ('burial' or 'cult') and value primarily aesthetic, but as artefacts with complex biographies and social lives in the EBA Cyclades. The third site is the sanctuary of Kalapodi, once thought to be that of Artemis Elaphobolos and now re-identified as that of Apollo at Abai. Before the DAI renewed its interest in the site under Wolf Niemeier in 2004, Kalapodi was already well known, through the work of R. Felsch, as being the sanctuary that best demonstrated 'continuity of cult' between the LB A (LH IIIC) through the El A and into Ar times. It was often remarked, however, that the earliest cult practice demonstrable at the site dated to the LH IIIC period, that is after the destruction of the Myc palaces. Kalapodi therefore represented a new configuration of cult, more characteristic of the later EIA and Ar periods than of the palatial BA. Recent excavation has confounded this comforting view. Kalapodi has strata going back through the 'palatial' LH IIIB and LH IIIA periods and stretching as far back as the MH. These strata contain objects (primarily figurines of one kind or another) that can plausibly be interpreted as cult objects. The fourth site is anc. Tegea, which, since 1999, has been investigated by the Norwegian Institute under the direction of its outgoing director, Knut Odeg?rd. Tegea has been subject to two kinds of surface survey: systematic, intensive field walking with sherd pick-up and geophysical prospection. Combined, these two techniques seem to show that the city of anc. Tegea was founded no earlier than the L6th Ct BC. But, when founded, it was conceived and laid out as a whole, on an early version of the grid plan with space allocated to an agora. This is the kind of pattern we might expect for a colonial foundation such as Megara Hyblaea, but not for what, until recently, has been thought of as a well-established political community that played a fairly important role in the Persian wars. The foundation of the city is also very much later than the foundation of the sanctuary of Athena Alea, where cult goes back to at least the Geo period, and a substantial temple had been built by the end of the 7th Ct BC. In this case, it seems likely that some notion of political community, perhaps based on a common cult site, preceded a major episode of urbanization. None of these claims is uncontroversial, and none will be accepted without some degree of criticism and some very animated discussion. Here I take the opportunity of my final Archaeology in Greece to express some purely personal views. Keros and Kalapodi both raise, in rather acute form, the fundamental theoretical question of how we recognize 'cult' in material terms, and how should we interpret it. While each claim has important historical implications, the tools of 'source criticism' one must use to evaluate each claim are those of the archaeologist and not the historian. Only an archaeologist is competent to judge whether the stratigraphy at Theopetra is sound and the thermoluminescence dates realistic; whether we can rule out looting as the explanation for</page><page sequence="2">2 JAMESWHITLEYETAL. the special deposit on Keros; whether any of the signs of BA cult at Kalapodi are well founded; and whether the surface finds and the geophysics at Tegea really support the picture of L6th Ct urbanization. There is no lack of Neo and BA specialists in British universities, mainly in departments of archaeology, and the Theopetra and Keros finds will be much discussed in the journals. Evaluating the claims of either Kalapodi or Tegea however requires a mix of historical and archaeological knowledge, and here there has been a worrying decline in the 'skills base' within departments of Classics in the UK. There is, for example, one department in one of England's ancient universities which has no archaeologist who specializes in the period 1000-30 BC in the E Mediterranean, and no epigrapher at all (not even a Rom one). The department in question though has plenty of historians, and no lack of scholars who are happy to call themselves 'Classical art historians'. If so, is this decline in the skills base really so worrying, so long as we have scholars who study 'art'? For is not the study of art one of the principal objects of what used to be called Classical archaeology and Classical studies? This is the traditional view, and it retains considerable appeal within modern Greece. Modern Gr newspapers and modern Gr politicians have been much exercised in recent years about the loss of their art through illicit looting and the trade in antiquities. Last year the discovery of a collection of objects with no clear provenance found in a villa on the island of Schinousa in the Mikres Kyklades (parts of the Cyclades just S of Naxos which also include Keros) occasioned much comment. Recently, the new minister of culture, Mr Voulgarakis, has had some success in recovering Gr art both from Swiss private collections and from American museums, institutions which have always coveted Gr art. Much was made of the recovery of four objects (a Hel gold athlete's wreath from Macedonia; an Ar marble kore from Paros; an incised Cl funerary stele from Thebes; and a marble relief from Thasos) from the Getty Museum, and more recently the Cl marble torso stolen from Gortyn some fifteen years ago and allegedly the work of Praxiteles has been returned. In speeches given at such occasions, the word klironomia (inheritance or heritage) is invariably used - these objects in themselves represent the heritage of Greece and should not have left the country illegally. This view of the Gr heritage however - one that focuses primarily on things arty and things Cl - is already somewhat dated. That educated Greeks have a more complex, and nuanced, conception of their own heritage, and of their place in the world, than many in Britain might imagine should be clear from the trouble taken to conserve and restore mosques in N Greece, particularly Thrace, recorded in the Deltion. The Bayezit mosque in Didymoteicho, for example, is clearly one of the wonders of EOt architecture, in every way comparable to examples in Bursa or Edirne, and (in a broader sense) to the Perpendicular churches of E Anglia. But still it does not, it seems, count as 'art' in quite the same way as the Parthenon marbles, and does not quite have the same value to politicians. The trouble is, of course, that before 146 BC, there was no such thing as Gr art. There is no anc. Gr word for 'art' - no word that is that covers the various categories of object that have traditionally been included (statues, temples, vases, gems, mosaics, etc) but also excludes other material things (pins, coarse pots, houses) thought to be merely banausic. Greek art is a Roman invention. It is the product of the very practice of looting and subsequent de-contextualization that scholars now profess to deplore. To quote an authority from Oxford, attempting a definition ofthat category, the statue: [statues] were big lumps of bronze or painted marble, fashioned in human form, wearing real-looking clothes and hairstyles, standing in life-like positions. They were set up on separate inscribed bases that gave their identity and specified the role and occasion they marked. A statue without its inscribed base became a piece of anonymous art [emphasis mine]. With its inscription, it was a functioning image in a particular setting (R.R.R. Smith, 'Pindar, athletes and the early Greek statue habit' in S. Hornblower and C. Morgan (eds), Pindar s Poetry, Patrons and Festivals: From Archaic Greece to the Roman Empire (Oxford 2007: 84). If there is no Gr art (or it only exists insofar as it is a product of Rom taste) it follows that there can be no history of Gr art. How can one write a history of a set of de-contextualized and looted objects, objects deprived of their setting and their meaning? Collections of 'Gr art' shed very little light on the anc. world, a fact which is evident even to journalists. As Souren Melikian of the New York Times says of the new Gr and Rom galleries in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York: the haziness surrounding the precise character and provenance of much of the art on view is astonishing (International Herald Tribune 26 May 2007: 10). No-one who has followed the activities of the Metropolitan Museum over the past 40 years or so should be astonished by this. Art and haziness about character and provenance are part and parcel of one another. What turns a statue into art is precisely its Rom de-contextualization. It should be no surprise then that the idea of a 'Cl art history' has been promoted most vigorously in recent years by Romanists. It may be a useful subject as a history of Rom taste, but it should play no part in Hellenic studies, properly understood. For this - and for the proper understanding of the vast quantities of new material that come to light every year in Greece - we need more archaeologists. A word on our sources: as in previous years, not everything is quite up-to-date. The Deltion is the second volume for the work covered by the Archaeological Service in 1999 (ADelt B Chr 54 [1999]) covering the area from Macedonia through Thrace, the Aegean Islands and Crete; AEMTH 19 (2005) covers various activities of both the Archaeological Service and Gr universities during 2005 in the area of Macedonia and Thrace. Only the Ergon, the reports from Gr newspapers and reports from Foreign Schools and other individual scholars actually reflect the archaeological work undertaken in Greece between 1 April 2006 and 31 March 2007. This year has seen some changes to our contributors. While Sophia Germanidou has continued with the Byz, Dusanka Urem-Kotsou and Anastasia Dimoula with Macedonia and Thrace, and Artemis Karnava and Irene Nikolakopoulou have done sterling work with the islands, Don Evely (Knossos Curator) has replaced Eleni Hatzaki in covering Crete. This is for the very good reason that Eleni Hatzaki is leaving the British School at Athens to take up a new position in Cincinnatti, as I will soon be returning to Cardiff. I would like to thank all our loyal contributors from the Foreign Schools, Gr universities and the Greek Archaeological Service, and everyone here at the School who have contributed this year: Helen Clark for her continuing support; Vicki Tzavara for arranging the contribu tions as they come in electronically; Penny Wilson for compiling the list of publications; Robert Pitt, Heinrich Hall and Jo Caldicott for help in compiling images; and Heinrich Hall for the final 'clean up'. Since this is my last Archaeology in Greece I would also like to thank Russell Shone of the Society for the Promotion of Hellenic Studies and Gina Coulthard (the production editor) for their patience.

Particularly noteworthy are the additions to the Egyptian galleries (400 objects), the glass collections (250 objects), the new terracotta galleries (600 objects, dating from Geo to Rom times), the C collections (160 objects) and the Vlastou collection (640 objects of Geo to Rom date, including fine examples of Cl wg pyxides and gold jewellery). Epigraphic Museum Eleftherotypia (01/11/2006) reports on an exhibition of Spartan inscriptions relating to the Peloponnesian war of the 5th Ct BC. One inscription consists of two fragments joined in 2006; the first fragment of which was found in 1730, the second in 1987. The reconstructed inscription has been brought to the Epigraphic Museum from Sparta; it refers to communities and individuals who 'sponsored' (i.e. gave contributions towards) the Spartan war effort. This inscription is to travel to New York, where it will form part of the 'Sparta-Athens' exhibition. Private Collections Maria Kazanaki-Lappa (Ephoreia of Private Collections) provides a report (ADelt B Chron 54 [1999], 1033-43) of several collections which have been exhibited, published or simply reported. Highlights include: of the 23 anc. objects in the collection of George and Anna McCabe, a 6th Ct BC bf amphora showing the birth of Athena (unattributed), the body of a bronze Rom statue of a horseman and a Cl (5th Ct BC) bronze hydria; of the 123 anc. objects in the collection of Socrates Kalkanis, several marble torsos and one head of Hel or Rom date; a 4th Ct BC funerary stele in the possession of Michael Erginos; a Rom inscribed stele in the possession of Alexandra My lonas; and another in the possession of Demetrios Sakelion. Paul and Maria-Smaragda Apostolides reported 177 objects bought in Cyprus, dating from BA to Cl times, and Konstantinos Politis exhibited an EBA (EC) vase, among other objects. The principal piece of the eight objects owned by Theodoros Aravanis is a L4th Ct rf krater. Demetrios Alain Nikolaidis-Nicolas reported 81 objects of Ar to Rom date. Theodoros Samourkas exhibited an Ar helmet of Cor type and six Myc vases of LH IIIA2-IIIC date. Finally, Vasiliki Sophianou owns a MGeo II pyxis. Many Byz objects, principally icons, in these collections are also noted. Conservation works A general report has been published: Aa|aTrpivou5?Kr]S, B. (ed.)

Anc. Agora. To Vima (25/07/2006) reports on events celebrating 75 years of American excavations in the Agora, and the 50th anniversary of the restoration of the Stoa of Attalos. Ethnos (23/05/2006) reports on the techniques used by the ASCSA director, Professor Steve Tracy, to date inscriptions using precise mathematical principles. Professor John Camp (ASCSA, Agora director) reports on the 2006 season of excavation. In the course of the past winter, three of the four mod. buildings acquired in recent years were demolished, and the fourth is about ready to come down. Excavation in one of the new plots was begun this season as part of Section BH. Otherwise our efforts were concentrated on two areas excavated last year: NW of the agora and in the old excavations at the SW corner of the square (Fig. 1). In this area S of the Tholos we continued to explore the remains of the building often identified as the Strategeion, or office of the generals. The discovery last year of a hoard of about 400 silver tetradrachms threw more doubt on that iden tification, already called into question by the discovery years ago of a pyre in the building. Fifty of the 51 known pyres are found in houses or commercial buildings, never in sanctuaries or public buildings, with this one possible exception. In addition, hiding 1,600 drachmas in a public office, while conceivable, seems somewhat unlikely, and the hoard, like the pyre, perhaps points to a commercial function for the building. Excavations this season concentrated on the E half of the building and were very productive, especially in terms of architecture. The W half, explored last year, was cut into the base of the Kolonos Agoraios hill, leaving virtually no floor fills and only the slightest traces of interior walls. The E half, by contrast, had deep fills to be investigated, and considerable new information about the plan of the building emerged. Three new crosswalls were encountered, along with a stretch of the wall which separates the E rooms from the rest of the building. While the exterior walls are made of large ashlar blocks of poros, the interior walls are of small fieldstones, set in clay, some 0.40-0.45m w., resting on shallow foundations</page><page sequence="4">4 JAMES WHITLEY ET AL. // ^ y Y -y t**/ ?ai COIN : HOARD found' in 2O05 QRAiN I W / \ ^^/y * A g. o r ;-i E x c avatio n s A t li e n s "STRATEGEION'* AREA P 1 ex. ri et t E n d of 2 O O 6 Se a s o 11 :-3 O O 0 e ?Mi? oa 1.

In addition, several terracotta drains were recovered; these carried water eastward through the E wall of the building to empty into the great drain. The mixed construction of the walls and the drains leading out of individual rooms are both paralleled in the commercial buildings being excavated behind the Painted Stoa in Sections BZ and BE and add their weight to the accumulating evidence that we should interpret the building as commercial, either public or private, rather than as an official public office building. In one of the N rooms we encountered a patch of plaster floor and beneath that a thick layer composed of almost nothing but marble working chips, of the sort found overlying most of the 'State Prison', which also may be better understood as a commercial building. Pottery found in the fill beneath the floor levels confirms a date in the 1st half of the 5th Ct BC for the original construction of the building. Deep in this fill we found the articulated, tightly-flexed skeleton of a mid-sized arthritic dog. In section BZ, W of the road, we excavated in various fills. Removing the bottom of a large round tile-floored cistern, we came down on a smaller one, immediately below. From the pottery, both seem to date to the 10th Ct AD and later. Further W, we excavated fills alongside a large water line associated with the bath in use in the area in the 2nd and 3rd Cts AD, and closer to the road we cleared more of a pebble Hel mosaic. Deep down to the N we uncovered what seems to be yet another EHel pyre. Within the road itself, we cleared more of the L water channels, particularly in the N. A second full section of the lead pipe was exposed, measuring, like the first, 2.10m /. In addition, a second lead pipe, of smaller diameter, was found at a slightly lower level. The big L drain running along the E side of the road was also more fully exposed. It shows signs of repeated repairs, with a variety of materials used to cover the actual channel, including amphorae and wall-tiles. Some of the amphorae date to the 5th Ct AD, as do a pair of intact lamps, including one with a Ch cross (Fig. 2). E of the road, we reached depths sufficient to bring to light earlier walls. Some of these seem to indicate the Cl commercial building, investigated to the S several years ago, continued this far N. Within what should be one of the rooms of the building we recovered two more pyres buried beneath the floors of the building (Fig. 3). One, with a coin associated, seemed to date to the E3rd Ct BC, while the other, found lower down, seems only slightly earlier. They increase the number of pyres found in this building to ten, by far the largest single concentration from anywhere in the Agora, Their purpose and meaning is still being studied by Susan Rotroff.

Behind the building we recovered a fair amount of Hel pottery (Fig. 5) and from ERom levels around the building we recovered many more fragments of terracotta figurines and masks. E of the building we also excavated Ar layers at elevations higher than floor levels within the Cl building, suggesting that it was set into a slightly rising slope.

In a relatively small area wre had an abundance of features: walls, pithoi, pits, a burial and two wells. Generally what we recovered seemed to date to the period familiar to us from the adjacent areas: the coarse-ware pottery and brown-glazed pieces are hard to date precisely, but most of the material should date to the years around 1,000 AD. For the most part we excavated beneath the floor levels of the buildings, presumably houses. Large pithoi were encountered, both stone-lined and mortared pits and large ceramic vessels, set with their mouths at floor level. In the corner of one room we found a coarse-ware cooking pot with the skeletal remains of a foetus of about 32 weeks, also buried beneath the floor. This is the second such internment found in the Byz settlement N of the river, and may be the accepted manner of disposing of such remains in this period. Two wells were excavated to a d. of 2.00-3.00m. Both are lined in the upper part with stones, and with proper well tiles lower down. Both seem to have been used in the Byz period, and it is not yet clear if either was in use at an earlier time. A large stone-lined pit was excavated down to a very hard-packed surface which seems to have served as its floor. In its NW quadrant, the pit incorporated a poros block which seems to rest on this same surface. From the orientation and elevation it seems entirely possible that the block and perhaps the surface can be associated with the E part of the Stoa Poikile, just within its N wall, though far more excavation will be necessary before this hypothesis can be confirmed.

To Vima, Eleftherotypia, Kathimerini (04/07/2006) and Eleftherotypia (02/07/2006) report on the exhibition at the Vailer building of finds from excavations at this plot. These include an assemblage of LRom amphorae and jugs from a well; lamps, one of the 1st Ct BC with an erotic scene; a LRom (4th_5th ct AD) spoon; an ERom gaming die; coins; marble heads; and an assemblage of black-glaze EHel tableware (plates, cups and jugs). Kathimerini, Ta Nea, To Vima and Eleftherotypia (20/10/2006) add further details, particularly on the abundant evidence for religious syncretism and the worship of 'foreign gods' found here and in other areas S of the Acropolis. These include a fragment of a small statue of Isis; the belly of a (Rom?) statue of Ephesian Artemis in white marble, h. 9cm; the top half of a Rom (1st Ct AD) statue of Zeus Heliopolites (Zeus of Baalbek), 0.7m h.; and a complete Rom (2nd-3rd Ct AD) statue of Isis Panthea, 0.6m h., showing the attributes of several other deities (the aegis of Isis-Athena, the snake of Hygeia, the roses of Aphrodite, the ivy leaves of Dionysos and the sun-disk of Helios). To Vima, Eleftherotypia, Kathimerini and Ta Nea (24/10/2006) report on the discovery of several fine marble Rom portrait heads of the 2nd Ct AD. These include the head in Thasian marble of the philosopher Aristotle, 0.46m h., from an over life-sized statue estimated to be 2.1m h., clearly of the same (Lysippean?) type as two examples from Rome; and the head of a bearded young man found in the Plateia Lysikratous, 0.34m h., interpreted as a priest of Dionysos.

Kerameikos/Votanikos. First Kathimerini and Eleftherotypia (24/05/2006) and later Ethnos and To Vima (13/09/2006) provide further reports on the pathological study of skeletons from the so-called 'plague pit' at the corner of the lera Odos and O. Peiraios (see AR 52 [2004-2005], 10). These skeletons are among the 87 individuals known to have been buried in this pit, excavated in 1994-1995, which may have contained as many as 130 individuals, whose rapid and informal burial indicates that they may have been victims of the so-called 'plague' of 430-428 BC described by Thucydides (2.49-54). The pit itself forms part of a much larger cemetery, dating from the 7th Ct BC until Rom times, where 1,191 individuals are known to have been buried. Pathological study and DNA analysis of the teeth from these three skeletons (one of an eleven year old girl) suggests that they died of typhoid fever - suggesting in turn that Pericles and many other Athenians must have died of this disease.

At Plateia Estavromenou in Aigaleo a 30m stretch of the anc. lera Odos, with retaining walls, was revealed. Nearby, at the entrance to the new Aigaleos metro station, a double pyramidal structure can in future be viewed under a perspex cover (see also AR 52 [2005-2006], 11). Nearby, at the Geoponiki well, another 9.3m stretch of the lera Odos, with eight successive layers dating from Cl to LRom times, can be seen. At the well of Prophitis Daniel an anc. apothetis, beside another 10m stretch of the lera Odos, contained numerous Eleusinian kernoi and other finds indicating the cult of Demeter, Kore, Athena Mor?a and Poseidon Phytalmios. Near the Elaionas metro station (see AR 51 [2004-2005], 8) the foundations of a bridge over the Kephisos abut remains of Hel workshops, part of a Hel cemetery (including a funerary per?bolos).

Central and Southwest Attika (once 2nd EPCA, now 26th EPCA; 1st EBA) Piraeus, Harbour of Mounichia. Eleftherotypia (08/03/2007) reports on investigations which have revealed at least four anc. shipsheds for triremes, measuring 40m by 5-6m. These date from the 4th Ct BC, though some remained in use until the time of Pausanias. On this basis, it is estimated that 82 shipsheds may originally have been in use in Cl times here. Alimos. Ta Nea (04/07/2006) reports on recent finds in this anc. deme associated with Thucydides. Discoveries include part of the small Myc settlement of the 13th Ct BC; a Myc chamber tomb; an EH settlement (circa 3000 BC) on the hill of Pani; and an EC1 (5th Ct BC) marble sphinx which must have formed part of a cemetery on the junction of the mod. avenues of Vouliagmeni and Alimos. Voula. Apogevmatini (04/03/2007), Kathimerini (06/03/2007) and To Vima (13/03/2007) report on the excavation of a large Cl (5th-4th Ct BC) complex in the centre of the anc. deme of Halai Aixonidai, in a plot bounded by the mod. streets of Athenais, Mystra and Leophoros Varis. The rectangular complex comprises a large central court, with a cistern, surrounded by twelve rooms. The size of the complex (0.15ha) and the finds (45 lead and one silver coin, fifteen of which are from a hoard, and numerous lead weights) suggest that the complex might have served as the 'agora' of the deme. Outside one of the twelve rooms was a small altar, suggesting that this room served a 'rural cult'. Other finds from the complex include plain pottery and loomweights. Southern Attika (Lavreotiki) (2nd EPCA; 1st EBA) Thorikos. Roald Docter (Ghent) reports on the short campaign of cleaning and restoration carried out in the theatre of Thorikos and its immediate surroundings on behalf of the Belgian School at Athens. Vegetation not only obstructed the monuments from view but also posed a real threat to their preservation. It is particu larly striking to compare the present situation of the koilon with the detailed photogrammetric record from 1974. Apart from the obvious anastylosis of the E section of the koilon, completed in 2001 by the Directorate for the Restoration of Ancient Monuments and the 2nd EPCA, the central and W sections have suffered considerably since, especially regarding the central part of the upper rows of the older koilon. Careful manual cleaning was undertaken. With a view to future cleaning operations, two different strategies were employed for the lower koilon. The central and E sections were not only freed from the overgrowing weeds and bushes, but great care was taken to remove any humus, seeds and roots that might prompt the renewed growth of the vegetation. In the W part only the surface weeds were removed, leaving humus and roots in place. In 2007 it will be estimated to what extent these different cleaning strategies may have influenced the vegeta tional overgrowth of the theatre.' Robert Laffineur (Belgian School at Athens, Universit? de Li?ge) reports on a short season of cleaning, planning and excavation carried out in 2006 in the area of the Velatouri of anc. Thorikos. In the area of the Myc cemetery, four trenches were opened up (A, B, C and D) in an area surveyed in 2005. The combined planning and excavation provided a more accurate understanding of the layout of the Myc cemetery, and will enable scholars better to contextualize the finds from earlier Belgian excavations here, especially for Tomb V The only significant finds were from trench B, where a deposit of ProtoGeo pots was found - a period rare at Thorikos, and previously unknown at Velatouri.

Many finds, ranging in date from Neo to Byz times, have been covered by the road. Particularly noteworthy are a LCI marble grave stele; a Cl building complex at Pallini; and a Cl clay figure of a Hermaphrodite from the site of the new airport. Menidi (anc. Acharnai).

Salaminos 21. At least thirteen levels of limestone seats of the cavea have been revealed, the skene and orchestra being covered by 2m of deposit. Finds (sherds) and architecture indicate a date of construction certainly by the M4th Ct BC, and possibly as early as 450 BC, making it one of the earliest theatres known. Residual obsidian also indicated earlier, probably EH, activity in this area, and the absence of Rom finds suggests why Pausanias (while noting a cult of Dionysos [1.31.5]) fails to mention a theatre. The Minister of Culture, Mr Voulgarakis, has ordered the immediate expropria tion of the site. An inscription uncovered at the site of the Rom bathhouse at Ai Gianni confirms earlier epigraphic evidence from the Saranda Martyres that Athena Hippia (see also Pausanias 1.31.5) was worshipped in this deme. Other recent finds in the general area include a cemetery at Leophoros Demokratias, with graves (pyres, sarcophagi) dating from Geo to ERom times. Ethnos and Ta Nea (18/09/2006) report on the small archae ological collection here, now established at O. Philadelphias 76. Finds include an EC1 rf column krater attributed to the Florence painter (470-460 BC; see J.D. Beazley, Athenian Red Figure Vase-Painters, ed. 2 (Oxford 1963), 540-46) discovered at Monopati. Acharnai/Dekeleia area. Eleftherotypia, Kathimerini and To Vima (16/11/2006) report that the so-called 'tomb of Sophocles', at Megali Vryssi or Panagitsa near the present-day Plateia Varymbombis and 150m E of the road between anc. Acharnai and Dekeleia, is to become an archaeological site. The Cl tumulus, which originally measured 40m di. and stood 13m h., contained a funerary per?bolos and four sarcophagi. The identification with the tragic poet, who died in 406 BC, is supported only by an anecdote in the L and anonymous Life of Sophocles.</page><page sequence="9">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2006-2007 9 Northern and Northwest Attika (2nd EPCA; 1st EBA) Nea Makri/Marathon, Brexiza, Sanctuary of the Egyptian Gods.

Marathon, Tsepi. M, Pantelidou-Gkofa (ASA) reports (Ergon, 11-18) on the completion of the excavation of tombs 45,47 and 68 at this EH-MH cemetery (see AR 52 [2005-2006], 14). All these tombs were rectangular cist graves made out of river pebbles. Tomb 45, which had an entrance to the N, was marked by an upright stone rather than a stele, and contained three levels. The lowest contained a child's skeleton, as did the middle layer, which also contained an obsidian blade (the only 'grave good'). The highest contained the remains of a young individual. Human remains, but again no real grave goods, were recovered from tomb 47. Tomb 68 also contained multiple burials, the skulls of the earlier burials being moved to the W part of the tomb. This tomb also contained the only undisturbed child's skeleton so far encountered (Fig. 7). The only grave goods were two obsidian blades and some bone beads. The general paucity of grave goods, particularly pottery, is a distinctive feature of this cemetery. Skala Oropou. A. Mazarakis-Ainian (ASA) reports (Ergon, 19-24) on three trial trenches made to the E of the EIA-EAr settlement, following earlier geophysical prospection. Trench A revealed only residual Hel and Rom sherds. Trench B uncovered a possibly Ar wall and an elliptical pit containing burnt material, broken Cor tiles, animal bones and broken LC1 EHel pottery. Shapes included perfume flasks, plaques, kantharoi, skyphoi, cups (kylikes), unpainted amphorae and lamps. Other finds (lead joints, nails) and some bronze coins confirm a date for the deposit in the L4th-3rd Ct BC. ISLANDS OF THE SARONIC GULF with KYTHERA (once 2nd, now 26th EPCA; 1st EBA/2nd EBA) Salamis Kanakia. To Vima (07/04/2006) notes a claim by the excavator, Giannis Lolos, that the Myc settlement here (see AR 51 [2004-2005], 10-11) was the palace of the Homeric hero Aias (Ajax). Kamatero. Eleftherotypia, Kathimerini Apogevmatini (05/07/2006) report on the discovery of cloth remains within an EC1 (5th Ct BC) bronze cinerary urn (kalpis) found at Kamatero. Impressions on the inside of the vessel indicate that the cremated remains were wrapped in both a woollen and a separate linen cloth. Evidence for the use of cloth had already been found in the Myc cemetery of Ag. Kyriaki and on a Cl (5th Ct BC) bronze mirror from Ambelakia, both on Salamis. Aigina Portes. Eleftherotypia (02/02/2007) notes the discovery of a further Myc chamber tomb from the known cemetery and settlement at Lazarides, near Portes, on the E coast of the island. Finds from the tomb generally date to the 14th Ct BC, and include terracotta figurines (possibly from a local workshop), as well as terracotta imports from the Argolid. Other finds include lead and bronze tools and weapons, and a silver bead. Of particular note is an iron dagger, one of the earliest such known. 7.

Louise Schallin (Director, Swedish Institute) reports on geophysical prospection conducted in 2006 in hitherto unexplored areas both inside and outside the Sanctuary of Poseidon at Kalaureia, Poros, by Apost?los Sarris from the Institute for Mediterranean Studies, at Rethymnon, Crete. The investigation's aim was to define the sanctuary and its relationship with the city. As in the case of the survey conducted by the same team in 2004, the results confirm the existence of several large structures outside the sanctuary. Traces of settlement-like remains were detected SE of the sanctuary in what has been considered the anc. polis of Kalaureia. The 2004 survey is now published by N. Papadopoulos et al. in Archaeological Prospection 13:2, 2006. Galatas Megali Magoula. Ethnos, Ta Nea and Eleftherotypia (03/07/2006) report on the excavation of three Myc tholos tombs, situated a little below the MH cemetery, on this hill overlooking the harbour of Pogona (today's Vidi). The largest of these tholos tombs measures 60m d., and contains a circular chamber 1 lm di., as large as the so-called 'Tomb of Aegisthus' at Mycenae. This tomb was built in the 15th Ct, and remained in use until the 13th Ct BC. Finds from this partially looted tomb include gold jewellery, terracotta figurines and a Canaanite jar, indicating trade with the Levant.</page><page sequence="10">10 JAMES WHITLEY ET AL. Kythera Kythera Island Project. Cyprian Broodbank (UCL) and Evangelia Kiriatzi (Fitch Director, BSA) report on the 2006 study season of the Kythera Island Project (KIP). Study by Cyprian Broodbank, Alan Johnston, Evangelia Kiriatzi and Joanita Vroom focussed on the large amount of pottery from ca 1,100 collection squares set out in 1999-2000 over the major coastal site of Kastri. The individual study of 5,143 feature sherds and the bulk fabric analysis of a much larger statistical sample fully documented the size of Kastri, covering ca 10-11 ha overall, less than 1% of which has been excavated. Furthermore it allowed phase-by-phase exploration of site size and functional differentiation, in collaboration with Varina Delrieu using probabilistic GIS techniques. Some examples of these explorations will be presented here. The settlement was already fairly large in the Final Neo EBAI and especially EBA II periods (Fig. 8). E Minoanising material is widely scattered, but First Palace remains are, as usual on Kythera, elusive or genuinely rare. Second Palace material is abundant; the settlement area expands to ca 5-7ha, plus peripheral, possibly destroyed funerary, areas (Fig. 9). Third Palace pottery is patchily present, and there are a few possible EIA finds, plus limited Ar. Cl is widely represented, as is LRom, with little Hel and ERom. Activity then declines very sharply until the return to the coast during the last two centuries. Similar probabilistic GIS techniques were used by Delrieu to define period-specific site sizes for a large selection of KIP's surface sites. A geological survey was also undertaken by Ruth Siddall, Vangelio Kiriatzi and Myrto Georgakopoulou, in Kythera and S Laconia, with some assistance by Ian Whitbread, aiming at the comparative characterization of pottery and metallurgy resources from the two areas, to complement the ongoing analysis of ceramic and metallurgical finds from the Kythera Island Project survey. Antikythera Kathimerini, Eleftherotypia (01/12/2006) and Ta Nea (30/11/2006) report on a recent symposium on the Antikythera mechanism, the Hel (2nd Ct BC) astronomical device originally discovered off the island in 1901. Several new reconstructions have been put forward, including one by Michael Wright of the Science Museum in London. KORINTHIA Isthmia. Elizabeth Gebhard (ASCSA/Chicago) reports on the 2006 study season of material from the main sanctuary area (Chicago excavations). The site is scheduled to reopen in 2007 after renovation and modernization of the Isthmia Museum, reinstallation of displays and new paths and signage in the archaeological area. Studies of the collection continued. Martha Risser in her work on Ar and EC1 ceramics from the great circular reservoir observed that the large dining services identified last season were not intended for a single use but were collected and stored, probably for reuse at the next festival. New vessels were added as needed. In the Rachi settlement Virginia Anderson-Stoj ano vie documented all visible remains on the S side of the ridge where there was extensive development in antiquity, not visible from the sanctuary. The features included terrace walls, a ramp, steps, floors, niches and beam holes in the bedrock between houses IX and X. Fritz Hemans continued study of the Ar Temple. He found that the fragments from Doric columns that may have been used in the pronaos had a maximum lower di. of ca 0.55m. It is likely that the wooden columns of the colonnade were similar in size, less than Oscar Broneer's estimate of ca 0.70m. They suggest a h. of around 3.30m based on a proportion of ca 1:6. Fragments from fluted stone pilasters are oval in shape and may have been added to the walls during a renovation to the temple. The base for the marble perirrhanterion was almost certainly set into the floor of the E pteron instead of resting on it as previously reported. Stella Bouzakis completed conservation of an iron discus that Oscar Broneer had recovered from the great circular reservoir. From the context, it belongs to a period before ca 450 BC, and was probably a dedication of 550-450 BC. Tim Gregory (ASCSA/Ohio) reports on the study undertaken in 2006 of material from the Ohio excavations at Isthmia. Study of material from the Rom baths continued, while study of material from the so-called E Field, located between the Temple of Poseidon and the Byz fortress, and partially excavated between 1970 and 1972, was renewed. Elsewhere, cleaning continued on the edge of the S boundary of the excavated area of the Rom bath, in order to stabilize the earth and even out this line, which has been eroding seriously since it was exposed in the 1970s. Cleaning continued almost to the SW corner of the Rom bath. In addition, it is planned to fill some of the old trenches left exposed since the 1970s and complete work along the S side of the building. In 2006 a new phase of investigation was begun in the NE corner of the Rom bath, at the point where the Rom building meets up with the EByz fortifications (the Hexamilion) as they run E toward the fortress. It has long been known that there were several buildings of Rom date in this vicinity, and a project was begun to record the architectural pieces that remain in this area and attempt to associate them with the existing foundations. Kenchreai. Joseph L. Rife (ASCSA/Macalester College) reports on the 2006 study season and final excavation season of the Kenchreai Cemetery Project. The cemetery consists of 30 subterranean Rom chamber tombs and 28 individual Rom cist graves cut into the bedrock along the E slope of the Koutsongila ridge over an area of ca 220m N-S by 60m E-W (Fig. 10). Research this season involved further work on the site plan; inspection of the natural terrain; the exploration of five tombs; the study of wall painting; the study of all classes of artefacts from the site; and the examination of human bones. A composite topographic plan of the site is currently under preparation using digital technology. Team members finished recording several features on the ridge, including wheelruts from a coastal cartroad and several ashlar blocks, probably from an E fortification wall. In documenting traces of looting, we found that extensive clandestine excavation has occurred since 2005. One freshly opened grave (G27) was recorded on the W part of the ridge. We also discovered two previously unknown burial sites, another slab-covered cist grave on the E edge of the ridge (G28) and a collapsed chamber tomb (T30) directly behind tomb 4. The examination of the natural landscape by Rick Dunn (Norwich) focused on the distribution of colluvium across the ridge and the taphonomic processes in the subterranean tombs. He found that variable colluvial depths across the ridge reflect the presence of burial structures, especially the large rectangular building (a temple?) at the ridge's S end that was</page><page sequence="11">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2006-2007 11 Site 064 (Kastri): collection grid Site 064: Number of diagnostics per collection unit Early Bronze Age II (EBII+) 0 &lt; 1 : 2-3 (.; 4-5 O 13 -66% Volume contour -99% Volume contour Site collection grid 8.

Professor Dunn also began examining the environmental history of the tombs. He found that, in many cases, large amounts of water had repeatedly entered chambers over the centuries, sometimes pooling to a considerable depth. During further exploration of the chamber tombs we discovered that a rectangular tomb building completely covered the dromos of tomb 6. We also developed a better understanding of the collapses of the structures over tombs 10, 14 and 22, which apparently were catastrophic events followed by long periods of gradual sedimentation. The investigation of the interior of tomb 10 revealed the presence of several discrete funerary deposits containing cuisine-related vessels. The loculi of tomb 10 contained well-preserved skeletons buried one over the other in distinct phases, sometimes identifiable by diagnostic artifacts. Our study of the new tomb 30 revealed the loculus in the dromos, the only example of this configura tion among the known tombs on Koutsongila. Apart from these advances in understanding tomb design and use, Florence Monier continued the study of wall-painting. She identified highly fragmentary painted plaster in tombs 1, 2, 3 and 23. Douglas H. Ubelaker continued his study of the human bones. He examined fragmentary skeletal remains from six tombs (nos 4, 9, 10, 11, 13, 22), including several discrete deposits of cremated bone. His observations shed light on the obscure process of cremation in Rom Greece: corpses were subjected to extremely intense, sustained heat (well over 800 degrees Celsius), after which point mourners extracted a selection of cremated bone from the pyre for deposition in urns. His conclusions on the number, age and sex of individuals have shown that numerous individuals were buried in the tombs over time - in one case at least 52 - and that men, women and children were deposited in both loculi and niches. These discoveries support our interpretation of the chamber tombs as burial sites for both families and generations of their household dependents. Because of the fragmentary condition of the bone asssemblage, we do not yet have a clear picture of skeletal morphology or paleopathology in the local population. The most important component of the 2006 campaign was the study of finds from activities at the site in 1956, 1976, 1988-1990 and 2002-2006. Professor Morison completed her examination of ca 25,000 artefacts from funerary contexts, of which ca 500 have been inventoried. This study has generated numerous important results, such as dating of the initial use of the cemetery to the M-Llst Ct BC, recognizing that most imported wares are of E rather than W origin, and interpreting many vessels as elements in commemorative ritual, particularly food-offerings or funerary banquets. Josephine Shaya completed the documentation of hundreds of small finds, including iron nails from tomb structures, hobnailed footwear, and coffins or biers and a substantial collection of glass vessels from burials. Christopher A. Faraone began the study of four fragmentary inscribed lead tablets found in the cemetery. His examination of one from tomb 22 (KM043) determined that the text was a Gr prayer for justice against a clothing-thief called the 'son of Caecilius', first invoking chthonic deities for assistance and finally cursing the culprit with the force of a supernatural agent, Lord Abrasax. Professor Rife studied the epigraphic corpus from the site, which includes ca 60 discrete texts of Rom and Byz date from the area of Kenchreai, from American excavations at the anc. harbour in the 1960s and from our recent work on Koutsongila. The most significant texts pertain to religion, civic life and the ECh churches. Alongside this research on the Koutsongila ridge, Professor Rife explored the larger context of burial in the Rom Korinthia through the investigation of other cemeteries at Kenchreai and in the region. He located two sites excavated in 1976 by the Archaeological Service E of the Kenchrean harbour (an ERom chamber tomb and a series of LRom cist graves) and the ERom cemetery ca 500m S of the harbour, which had been excavated by Demetrios Pallas in the 1950s and by Henry Robinson in 1962. East Korinthia Archaeological Survey. Tim Gregory and Dan Pullen (ASCSA) continued study of finds from earlier seasons. Corinth, museum. Eleftherotypia, To Vima and Kathimerini (31/10/2006) all note a recent exhibition of finds from the Argolid at the museum.

Excavation at Corinth concentrated on Geo to Hel contexts to the N of the long concrete pool of the LRom domus in the Panagia Field. A fifth Geo grave (grave 2006-04, Fig. 11) was excavated. It was found cut into colluvium about 17m NW of the line of three graves excavated in previous seasons. Architecturally, the new grave is the most sophisticated of the group. It consists of a rectangular pit with an apsidal niche cut on the S side. The niche was completely blocked off with a large slab of limestone. In the middle of the pit a smaller cutting contained 11. Corinth, Panagia Field: Geo graves</page><page sequence="14">14 JAMES WHITLEY ET AL. 12. Corinth, Panagia Field: pottery from MGeo I grave a large, rectangular, monolithic oolitic limestone sarcophagus. This was closed with a single slab of limestone. No trace of the body survived. The burial assemblage was deposited within the niche and along the E side of the sarcophagus (Fig. 12). It consisted of nineteen vessels, including seven oinochoai, four skyphoi, three amphorae, two kraters, two plates and an aryballos, which date the grave to MGeo I. Since both the EGeo I sarcophagi are sandstone, the new find represents the earliest oolitic limestone example at Corinth. A faceted columnar block embedded in a Rom wall that cut the N end of the grave is of a type noticed elsewhere at Corinth in loose association with Geo graves and is reminiscent of architectural fragments found in the LGeo fill of a well. It may have been used as a grave marker. It appears as if the graves originally flanked a path which remained in use down into the Hel period. The track in its latest phase has been found in two patches and consists of a hard packed cobbled surface and flanked the W end of the ashlar foundations of a long building (Fig. 13). Six rooms of this structure have so far been revealed. It probably dates to the 4th Ct BC and it continued in use well into the Hel period, to judge from an amphora stamp in the latest fill, probably down to 146 BC. A cistern in the NW room, buried beneath the latest Hel fills, was partly excavated. It has a step ladder cut into a leaning ashlar in its NE corner. The cistern was filled in the M3rd Ct. A well on the S side remained in use during the Rom period when it was filled and sealed off sometime in the 3rd Ct. How it relates to a large cistern partly excavated in 2005 is unclear. The cistern had a stair descending from the W and appears originally to have been quite deep. A cantilevered horizontal beam supported at one end by a pillar is reminiscent of the system used to support the roof of the double apsidal cistern at Perachora. This cistern was closed in the L3rd or E2nd Ct BC. A complete sample of the fill was wet-sieved to recover a substantial quantity of carbonized grape pips. These will help to establish a stage in the domestication of the grape. After the long building went out of use and had been abandoned for some time, a later Hel structure was built on a different orientation over the W end. One room of this structure had a destruction deposit covering the earth floor. Among the finds were an almost complete mould for a Hel mouldmade bowl (Fig. 14) and an amphora stamp. Although the form of the bowl mould and the stamp traditionally have been dated to before Mummius, a mendable E Sigillata A plate dates the horizon no earlier than the L2nd Ct but before the re-foundation of Corinth as a Rom colony. Elsewhere fills produced a range of Ar and Cl material. This material indicates cult activity, probably relating to the Geo burials in the area. 'Cult' material comprises a stone altar fragment, miniature vessels, a fragment of a perirrhanterion base with a painted palmette and banded lekythoi. Signs of industrial production include bronze and iron slag, and ceramic 'oven mitts'. Corinth publications, a new volume has appeared: Merker, G.S., The Greek Tile Works at Corinth: The Site and the Finds. Hesp. Suppl. 35 (Princeton, N.J., ASCSA 2006). Dorati. J. Marchand (ASCSA/Wright State) reports on the second study season of the Dorati Survey Project. This season the database documenting all the pottery recorded in survey was completed and updated, with date ranges provided for all of the material. Statistical searches required for the survey report are now in order. Additionally, 64 representative items were chosen and researched for full publication in catalogue form with the survey report, prior to the publication of the individual pottery groups. Kleonai. T. Mattern (DAI Athens/Marburg) reports on further investigation undertaken in 2006 in collaboration with the 36* EPCA (represented by A. Mantis). Two research campaigns were conducted in 2006 on the lower acropolis of Kleonai. Architectural remains had already been noticed by 'early travellers' on the lower acropolis, a saddle on the E side of the city, below the acropolis. In recent years, an Ar sanctuary (SI) with an EByz basilica was excavated in this topographically well-defined area. The N of the lower acropolis is defined by the so-called Terrassenbau (terrace building). In spring, a geophysical survey took place, with the aim to clarify in what architectural context the Ar sanctuary on the lower acropolis stands with the area of the Terrassenbau. Since excavation took place in both areas, this provided an opportunity to verify the survey results, and furthermore to compare the suitability of different techniques. The week-long survey was concluded with good results. It located a courtyard area with structures, some useful information for interpreting the anc. access to the acropolis, as well as two roads, but was especially useful in allowing us to recognize and follow the architecture of the Terrassenbau S of the area excavated in 2005/2006. In the summer, an excavation campaign uncovered the Terrassenbau. The remains, partially visible above the surface, were thus named because the terrain slopes steeply here and had to be retained by a terrace wall, the lower courses of which survive. The preliminary exploration in 2005 had already revealed a Hel wall and the geophysical survey had suggested a sizeable complex. A Hel propylon was indeed uncovered, abutted in the S by a somewhat later wall (possibly the posterior wall of a stoa with wooden supports?; see AR 52 [2005-2006], 24-25) (Fig. 15). The terrace wall could also be dated as Hel(?), certainly anc. A surprise find in the same area is the entrance to a spring (h. 1.7m, interior measurement), witnessing the lack of water in this urban area located high above the water table, and the constructional efforts it led to. The area of the propylon and the hall also contained three cisterns. In the N of the sounding, a Byz structure built of anc. spolia was revealed; as it is severely damaged, its function remains unclear. In any case, it underlines the continuing importance of Kleonai, already indicated by the aforementioned basilica, and will certainly help to improve our understanding of the N Peloponnese's population densities in L antiquity.</page><page sequence="15">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2006-2007 15 13. Corinth, Panagia Field: Hel architecture The Hel propylon gave access to an area located below the acropolis slope, now covered with much sediment.

Nonetheless, the urban context of the lower acropolis with its main architectural features is now mostly understood and will be prepared for publication. Nemea, Sanctuary of Zeus. Kim Shelton (ASCSA/UC Berkeley) reports on the 2006 season of study and conservation at this panhellenic sanctuary. Activities at Nemea in 2006 consisted of maintenance and research both on site and in the museum, restoration in the Temple of Zeus and an archaeological field school during the month of June. Study was begun on the ceramic material from past seasons of excavation in the Sanctuary of Zeus for publication in Nemea X: Chronology. Examined and analysed in detail were sherds from deposits in association with the Temple of Zeus, the Sacred Square, the 4th Ct BC Xenon and the ECH Basilica, and an area further to the E with reported concentrations of PH material. Additional studies were conducted in the museum by Robert Knapp on the coins excavated since 1996 and by Shelly Wiles on site and in the museum on the so-called Nu structure (Hesperia 47 [1978], 59-64). Knapp identified issues of mints until now unattested at Nemea, such as Heraclea Trachinia and Phalanna in Thessaly. There are also four more coins from Asia Minor, adding to the significant presence of coins from that</page><page sequence="16">16 JAMES WHITLEY ET AL. 14. Corinth, Panagia Field: Hel bowl mould distant area. The Nu structure is a statue base just off the SE corner of the temple and related marble and limestone blocks, presently collected near the Basilica/Xenon foundations for study. The blocks can be reconstructed as two tiers of a monumental statue base set on the poros limestone euthynteria, still in situ. A partial inscription on one face of the top marble course suggests that the sculptor may be connected to the 4th Ct BC sculptor Kleon of Sikyon. Two fragments newly connected to this piece may help to clarify the identification further. Chance surface finds were made during the weeding of the site, including three coins and a circular bronze fragment. Significant work has been completed in the reconstruction project of the Temple of Zeus (Fig. 16), on the foundations and krepidoma of the E end and pronaos. Two columns, K-30 and K-29, in the centre of the E side colonnade have been almost completed. All of the drums are in place and the final carving of the exterior surfaces is nearing completion. The epistyle will be positioned only after the next two columns to the N are finished. Nemea, Agia Sotira cemetery. Jim Wright (Bryn Mawr/Canadian Institute) reports on the 2006 season of excavation of the LBA chamber tomb cemetery on the hillside of Agia Sotira, outside the village of Koutsomadi near anc. Nemea. Several of the tombs in this cemetery have been looted in the past and there is continuing danger of further looting. The cemetery was discovered in 2002 and E. Pappi, on behalf of the 4th (now 36th) EPCA, salvaged a looted LH IIIB1 tomb (tomb 1). The location and alignment of the tombs discovered in 2006 suggest that there are others yet to be discovered. p&amp;S? g Kleonai 2006 ?? sog.

Kleonai: plan of Hel structures</page><page sequence="17">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2006-2007 17 We believe these tombs are those of the inhabitants of the nearby settlement on Tsoungiza hill, excavated between 1981 and 1986 by the Nemea Valley Archaeological Project. We are undertaking a systematic recovery and analysis of the human skeletal remains in order to make an assessment of the social make-up of the tombs and the diet, health and occupational activities of the occupants. Comparison of this mortuary information with the domestic evidence from Tsoungiza, as recorded in habitation structures, artefacts, and food remains, will provide an unprecedented picture of life and death in a Myc settlement. Additionally, because of the proximity of Tsoungiza and Agia Sotira to the much larger cemetery to the W at Aidonia and its unexcavated settlement, we think the evidence from our excavation of these tombs will enable us to assess the relationship between Myc settlements in these two adjacent valleys. The team this summer conducted a survey of the area with ground penetrating radar, carried out extensive test trenching and excavated three more tombs. Two of these (tombs 2 and 3) were found to have been disturbed. One (tomb 2) had been thoroughly looted, although careful excavation of the chamber, dromos and robber's dump revealed at least three episodes of opening and refilling as well as fragments of LH IIIA2-B1 unpainted carinated kylikes and a LH IIIB1 unpainted shallow angular bowl. The other (tomb 3) was also devoid of human remains, save two adult teeth found in a slab covered pit in the dromos. Other finds included a single complete vessel from the chamber provisionally dated to the end of the 8th Ct BC, as well as sherd material from the dromos dating from LH IIIA1 to LH IIIB1. Among these were fragments of a LH III A1 goblet with painted ivy decoration, and a LH IIIA2 pattern painted conical rhyton. Preliminary analysis of the dromos revealed at least five episodes of opening and refilling. The final tomb (tomb 4) was undisturbed, and contained at least eight individuals in the chamber and a probable neonate in a side niche of the dromos, with material ranging in date from LH IIIA2 to LH IIIB2. The dromos revealed at least six episodes of opening and refilling, and the stomion was entirely preserved and blocked by dry wall. The side niche in the dromos was blocked by large upright stone slabs. It contained a LH IIIB feeding bottle and over 90 miniscule drilled stone beads, each about 1.5mm in di. The main chamber had collapsed, but was otherwise undisturbed. Burials took place in two primary strata. The uppermost stratum contained two pairs of burials which included three adult males and one female with pottery that dated from LH IIIB1 to IIIB2, including a LH IIIB1 stirrup jar decorated with dot rosettes, a LH IIIB2 pattern painted hydria and LH IIIB2 rosette deep bowl. Beneath these burials three pits were cut into the chamber floor and contained a lower level of earlier burials, including a young female aged sixteen to seventeen, a male in his late 30s and secondary burials of two adult males. Very few grave goods were associated with these lower burials. The date of the burials excavated so far corresponds to the major period of occupation at the nearby settlement on Tsoungiza. Although only preliminary analysis of the skeletal remains from the cemetery has been conducted by S. Triandaphyllou, it is clear that the two tombs with skeletal remains contained infants, children and adults interred over several generations and that tomb 3, though robbed in antiquity, originally contained at least one adult burial. The discovery of additional tombs should provide a good demographic sample of the people who lived and died in the area of Tsoungiza during as many as two centuries of its habitation. This would be invaluable for comparison not only with the habitation remains from the settlement but also with the remains from the much 16. Nemea: Temple of Zeus under reconstruction larger cemetery at nearby Aidonia. This research will improve the picture of human settlement in the Nemea valley and the wider region comprising the Asopus (Phliasian) valley to the W, all of which can be assessed in relation to its powerful neighbour at Mycenae. Sikyon. Kathimerini, To Vima, Ta Nea and Eleftherotypia (08/08/2006) all report on plans by the local demos to construct a museum of the works of the anc. Cl sculptor Lysippos, who was from Sikyon. It is not yet clear whether any 'original copies' of such works will grace the museum, or whether the museum will be filled with 'copies of copies'. Titane. Christiane Tytgat (Belgian School), Alain De Wulf, Rudi Goossens, Marc Hennau and Daniel Van Damme (Ghent) report on the 2006 survey season. The survey concentrated on the slopes of the acropolis hill and of the adjacent NW plateau. Due to heavy surface vegetation present on most of the area, finds were rare and predominantly limited to the rocky parts. Terrace walls were located on the higher levels of the NE and the SW slopes of the NW plateau; all vegetation was removed from these walls. Rows of anc. stone blocks similar to those used for the construction of the acropolis wall and for part of the NE section of the town wall provide possible evidence for the location and direction of the town wall. Two gaps, one in the NE town wall, the other in the SW wall, may represent access to the NW plateau. Soundings will supply more information on this hypothesis. Wheel-tracks indicating an anc. road to the SE of the acropolis can be traced over a distance of 56m. They are part of a path that, after following the NW slope of the NW plateau, then bends around the SE edge of the acropolis and continues along the SW side of the hill. A probably mod.</page><page sequence="18">18 JAMES WHITLEY ET AL. enclosure wall built of anc. stone blocks was located on the SW slope. Fragments of tiles and bricks, and sherds of domestic Rom pottery were located as well as a concentration of LGeo sherds on one single spot, SW of the acropolis. The building situated on the plateau to the SE of the acropolis and its surrounding area was cleared from vegetation. Meyer called this structure a 'temple' and presumed it to be the Altar of the Winds mentioned by Pausanias. This identification is not accepted by all scholars and is still not authenticated today. The construction proved to be longer and larger than it was first perceived during the 2004 campaign. The long S wall runs further towards the E, with a downward inclination into a trapezoidal platform. The smaller E wall continues to the S. The identification, function and use of the building remain obscure. It is hoped that the soundings planned for 2007 may help to solve the problem. Anc. stone blocks were used for the construction of the terrace walls located to the S of Meyer's 'temple'. They separate two plots of land, but it is yet uncertain whether they rest on anc. foundations. At the W end of the field, they border the small path located in 2004 that was still in use half a century ago. Mapping was extended in 2006. New measurements were carried out on the SE plateau and in the sector of the survey which regroups the upper W areas of the site. These data were added to the results of the previous campaigns. A spatial photogrammetry study, using satellite imagery, was used to produce digital elevation models, a viewshed analysis, two land use maps (1962 and 2003) and a map showing the changes in the land use. Consolidation of the acropolis wall continued after all vegetation was removed from its exterior side in 2005 and certain areas showed to urgently need such work. The proposal was accepted by the Directorate for the Restoration of Ancient Monuments of the Ministry of Culture and by the 37th EPCA, in collaboration with which it was carried out.

Professor Banks was in Athens and Argos in the autumn to do final checking. The volumes on the Small Objects of Lerna III-V and the Neolithic Settlement and Small Objects are in preparation. B. Erickson (UC Santa Barbara) completed the first stage of research on the Geo through Hel material. M. Lindblom and his team arranged for NAA, p?trographie and chemical analyses of Lerna VI (MH and LH I) sherds. The catalogue entries and drawings of the pottery were completed in Argos in March, and study continues on the analysis of shapes and preparation of plans and sections of relevant graves. David Reese (Yale) has continued his restudy of Lerna animal bones stored in Stockholm and in Argos. K.D. Vitelli's volume (V) on Neolithic Pottery is in press. C. Zerner's study of Lerna V (MH) settlement and pottery is nearly completed. S. Voutsaki (Gronigen) and her team (S. Triandaphyllou et al.) have had good results from their re examination of the Lerna V human bones, especially with the DNA analysis. They have had '80% success rate in recon structing nuclear DNA'. C. Shriner (Indiana) and her team continue their study of clay sources (integrated petrologic approach) in the Aegean area, a study which developed out of earlier work on Lerna EH clay sources. The Lerna Excavation Archives are now stored at the ASCSA in Athens, where they can be accessed (thanks to the work of archivist Natalia Vogeikoff-Brogan) at www.ascsa.edu.gr. Argos, Aspis. Gilles Touchais (Paris 1/EFA) reports on the 2006 season of excavation, cleaning and study. The season had several aims, amongst which was the completion the topographic plan of Aspis (a project begun in 2005; see AR 52 [2005-2006], 31-33). A second was to carry out complementary excavations in the SE part of the site. Our object was, on the one hand, to collect a sufficient quantity of well-stratified material in order to get reliable data on several ceramic categories and, on the other hand, to improve the pres entation of the site, rendering the succession of several building phases more visible or legible. The excavation allowed us to make clearly visible the level of the last MH occupation phase (sector 1), revealing with a greater degree of clarity the series of structures of the 3rd phase of the apsidal house (whose walls, at least in the main room, were covered with a white coating) and the neighbouring tomb (sector 2). This year we also conducted a systematic cleaning of former excavations, within the context of the production of a global architectural survey of the MH settlement of Aspis. Cleaning activities were concentrated on the E sector of the hill where the constructions were very dense and where their traces are still visible. In the S half of the sector we cleaned three buildings: the only preserved segment of the 'interior surrounding wall', house N (this one being the largest) and house O. At the end of this first cleaning campaign, we may affirm that the MH remains (previously investigated by Vollgraff) were in a much better state of preservation than expected. Finally, we continued our study of the ceramic material. We focused on the Minyan pottery, present in number during all phases of the MH settlement of the Aspis. Minyan pottery is remarkably similar to the corresponding classes of Boiotia (Eutresis, Thebes, Orchomenos) and Attica (Agora of Athens, Eleusis). Having said this, the material from Aspis shows some very specific peculiarities which betray the existence of a local Minyan shop, with a range of products exceeding the widely known small group known as Argive Minyan. Argos, Nannopoulos plot. Anne Pariente (Lyon/EFA) and Christos Piteros (4th EPCA, Nauplion) report on the 2006 season of excavation and cleaning (Fig. 17). After the demolition of the series of nine vats left in place during previous campaigns on the W part of the plot, the focus of this campaign, which was conducted in collaboration with the Ephoria of Nauplion, was on the N sector, i.e. the area of the krepis and the central basis of the orchestra (including immediate surrounding areas). At the junction of the krepis and the central basis, we unearthed a series of layers which yielded pottery of the 3rd-6th Ct AD and which covered a layer which was extremely rich in ceramic material of the lst-4th Ct AD. To the S of the krepis, in the N sector of the orchestra, we unearthed a series of five blocks of poros (reused) which complete the E part of the central basis of the orchestra. To the E of the central basis, we recovered a type of material previously common in this sector of the agora. The fragmentary, and diverse, condition of this material suggests that it is rubbish, discarded in an abandoned area of the former agora. We carried out extensive cleaning operations on the</page><page sequence="19">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2006-2007 19 Hi ! .m. w 17. Argos, Nannopoulos plot: general plan concreted soil of the basin, protected by well-preserved areas of hydraulic mortar. This area was covered partly by a compact layer whose marbled texture indicates stagnation. We also cleaned a gray-greenish clay layer, a large sector of the bottom of the basin, which may possibly be the remains of a clay settling facility, although our interpretation remains uncertain. In the SE sector of the orchestra, we recovered the layer of fine and homogeneous brown soil, the so-called 'garden-soil'. This layer, which had been already identified in 2004 and 2005, was poor in material. The presence of several glazed pottery sherds suggests a Byz or Ot date. Seven funerary pits dug in this layer, which belong to the necropolis 'of the agora', contained the remains of three adults and four newborns. Argos, Sanctuary of Pallas Athena. Eleftherotypia (04/12/2006) provides further comments on the finds from Plateia Staropazarou already noted (AR 50 [2003-2004], 19 20; AR 51 [2004-2005], 23; AR 52 [2005-2006], 29). It is not clear whether any new evidence has come to light. Mycenae. Sp. Iakovidis (ASA) reports (Ergon, 25-31) on continuing excavation in two areas. In the N area of the acropolis three further rooms of building K, measuring in total 26m by 4.5m, were investigated. The third room contained what appears to be the base of a stairway. All three rooms had Myc painted pottery and small finds. In the N room, an upper layer contained LH IIIB2 pottery, and a lower LH III A2-B1 pottery mixed with burnt objects indicating a destruction horizon. In the Petsas house, excavation of the W wall of room E was completed. Remains of burnt wooden joists along the length of room T probably represent remains of a wooden floor. Investigation of a well in room T7 was continued down to a d. of 10.5m. Finds include pottery (especially kylikes and drinking vessels), figurines, fragments of gold leaf and an elephant's tooth. Of particular importance were two fragments (Figs 18 and 19) of tablets in Linear B in a lower, LH IIIA2, stratum. One fragment reads J*-no-e | ne-to-30 (in two lines), the other ti-sa.

The Greek-Swedish excavations on the Myc acropolis of Midea continued in 2006 under the direction of Katie Demakopoulou with the collaboration of the Director of the Swedish Institute, Ann-Louise Schallin, and Nicoletta Divari Valakou. Katie Demakopoulou reports on the Gr excavations. The Gr team excavated in the SW part of the lower acropolis and on the upper acropolis, while the Swedish team concen trated on the area E of the E gate. The Gr team worked in three sectors: on the NW terrace of the upper acropolis; in the W gate area; and on the lower W terrace of the acropolis. Furthermore, the major project, financed by the EU and the Greek Ministry of Culture and conducted by the Gr team for the site conservation, maintenance and arrangement of the entire area of the acropolis, continued and was concluded by the end of 2006. On the NW terrace of the upper acropolis excavation continued in both neighbouring trenches A and Aa where remains of the Neo and EH periods had been found in previous campaigns. Large bedrock outcroppings were uncovered in trench Aa enclosing a stone terrace that is associated with a street consisting of two parallel lines of boulders retaining a filling of stones packed together to make a stone pavement. To the E of the street and on a lower level, the floor of a room was found, which was covered by piles of stones, probably coming from ruined walls. Abundant pottery was recovered, ranging from LNeo to Myc times. The bulk of the pottery is dated to the EH period, for the most part to EH I, although a considerable quantity of sherds belongs to EH II and III. It is important that all three phases of the period are represented in Midea. Most of the EH I pottery was found in the area of the room NE of the street. It includes fragments from typical vases of this pottery phase, such as stems and body sherds of fruit stands, sherds of so called cheese-pots with perforations under the rim and flat bases of storage vessels with mat impressions. This pottery has good parallels in the EH I Talioti ware known from Tiryns and other sites in the Argolid. The EH II pottery found was associated with the stone terrace and the street. It comprises dark-painted sauceboats and bowls, handles of ladles, stands and coarse storage vessels. Found in the upper layers of the trench was some fragmentary EH III pottery, including part of a bowl or ladle with handle and rim, decorated with incised wavy, zig-zag and horizontal lines. Other finds are a fragmentary deer horn recovered from the floor deposit of the room and a considerable number of obsidian and flint blades found dispersed in the entire excavated area together with cores and flakes of the same materials. The abundance of these finds strongly suggests the existence of a workshop for the manufacture of blades in that area. In the N corner of trench A a small space was excavated with a closed deposit containing a group of Myc pottery and other objects. The pottery is of LH IIIB2 date and includes a fragmentary rosette bowl of very fine quality, part of a Group A deep bowl and fragments of other Myc decorated and plain vases. Fragmentary terracotta figurines, spindle whorls of steatite and scraps of mother-of-pearl were also recovered. Worthy of mention is a very well-preserved, large globular bead of blue glass with polychrome decoration. It is most probably an import from Egypt to the Argolid of the 13th Ct BC. Excavation continued in the W part of the building complex that abuts the fortification wall in the W gate area. Two new rooms against the wall were uncovered, rooms XIII and XIV. To the N of the rooms a sloping rocky area was cleared. Room XIII is almost square and fairly spacious with a floor of trampled earth, which is on a lower level than that of the neigh bouring rooms Villa and VHIb, which had been excavated in previous campaigns. The walls of the room are almost destroyed, with the exception of the wall shared by both rooms VHIb and XIII. It is tilting and distorted, however, and many stones have fallen out of its faces. The floor deposit of room XIII contained abundant LH IIIB2 pottery. Many fragments of decorated vases typical of this period were recovered, such as deep bowls of all types, kraters, mugs, jugs and stirrup jars, as well as fragments of fine plain vases, transport stirrup jars and other coarse storage and cooking vessels. Some vases were partly restored from fragments: a deep bowl of Group B, a plain conical kylix, a dipper and an oval vat. Other finds include an unfinished lentoid sealstone of green steatite, three fragmentary clay figurines, an obsidian arrowhead and a spindle whorl of steatite. Of room XIV only a small part, adjacent to the fortification wall, could be fully excavated during the time allotted. A thick destruction deposit contained a group of smashed vessels including a tall pithos and roof tiles, which were found in situ on the floor level. Noteworthy is the discovery of fragmentary human bones, the examination of which showed that they belong to the skeletons of an adult and a child. These skeletal remains most probably represent two victims of the earthquake that struck Midea at the end of the 13th Ct BC, an event which resulted in the destruction of the building complex and other structures on the</page><page sequence="21">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2006-2007 21 acropolis. Of the many ceramic fragments found in the excavated part of room XIV some vessels were partly restored: the tall pithos, a kalathos, a wide-necked amphora and other decorated and plain vases of LH IIIB2 date. An intact whetstone and two stone pounders were also recovered. A new trench was opened on the lower W terrace of the acropolis, against the W section of the fortification wall, with the aim to reveal the line and its entire width. In this area deep accumulated deposits, washed down from higher up the summit and the slope of the acropolis, have almost completely covered the fortification wall of which only the outer face is partly visible. By the removal of thick accumulated deposits the inner face of the wall was exposed along with a large part of the filling. The cleaning of the sloping area W of the trench resulted in the identification of the outer face of the fortification wall. Against the inner face of the wall two rooms were partly uncovered. The floor deposit of both rooms has not yet been reached. Abundant Myc fragmentary pottery was recovered from the accumulated deposits of this trench, mixed with some EH and MH, as well as Rom and Byz sherds. There are few EMyc sherds. Most of the pottery, however, can be dated to the LH IIIB2 period, comprising fragments of deep bowls of Group A and B, mugs, kraters, jugs and stirrup jars. There are also fragments of plain and coarse vessels. The fragments of a large jar of Handmade Burnished Ware may also be mentioned. The decorated pottery of the upper layers of the trench include some LH IIIC fragments. These come mostly from kraters with coated interior and elaborate decoration with spirals on the exterior (Fig. 20), as well as from monochrome deep bowls and kylikes. Some fragmentary Myc human figurines were also recovered. Special mention must be made of the head of a large wheelmade figure, the surface of which has suffered in places. Remains of its decoration in red paint, however, are still visible. Anne Louise-Schallin reports on the Swedish excavation season here in 2006. Swedish efforts were concentrated to the area of the E gate and on the upper plateau SE of the E gate. This season's work was concentrated in three areas: the removal of the wide baulk between trench 3 and room 9; the removal of wall A within the E gate area; and the exploration of archaeological remains within the circuit of the excavated suite of rooms, i.e. trenches 13:NE, 13:S and 15. The baulk that separated the excavations of room 9 and the recently investigated trench 3 was considered to pose a danger to visitors in the eventuality that they got too close to the trenches. It was therefore decided that it should be taken down. 20. Midea: fragments of LH IIIC krater from Gr excavations 21. Midea: LH IIIB2 narrow-necked jug from Swedish excavations After the dark brown topsoil had been removed, it became evident that the light grey soil of the Myc destruction layer had been cut in later times. Finds of pottery sherds of Byz-Med date indicate that activities took place here at that time. Pottery fragments and other small finds were rather common in the Myc destruction layer, but they had probably been washed down from higher up the slope. However, some archi tectural features were discovered. The extension of the long wall in room 9 was seen, but instead of continuing in a straight line, it appears to make a right angle towards the slope. At wall A in the E gate area, some flimsy walls uncovered during excavations in the mid 1990s have suffered greatly from erosion despite attempts to solidify them. These walls are post Myc, resting on destruction debris. One such wall is not known from any published plans, but it is now named wall A. It was subsequently removed. Trench 13 was extended towards the S in order to investigate the platform-like feature found last year. It continues another 1.50m to the S (the width of the extension) and probably a little further. The function of the platform is not yet clear. It rests not only on the Myc destruction layer, but also on dark former topsoil and could therefore be a historical remnant. To clearly see the stratigraphy beneath the platform in trench 13, in addition to investigating the Myc layers, trench 13 was extended to the NE (trench 13:NE). In the dark brown soil, just beneath the level of the platform, were many loose small stones, possibly the eroded remains of a stone packing seen at other places in the area. Fragments of a LH IIIB2 narrow necked jug were excavated here (Fig. 21). E of trench 13:NE is the triangular trench 15. Along its longest side is a stretch of stone packing that connects with one found earlier. It follows the slope of the hill and ends, or continues, just under the platform in trench 13. In the remaining part of the trench, the Myc debris was excavated. As in the neighbouring trench 13:S, pottery was plentiful. Tiryns. Joseph Maran (DAI Athens/Heidelberg) reports on the 2006 season of excavation. Archaeological investigation of the W lower town, which had been interrupted since 1974, was resumed with a first season of excavation in grid squares L51 and L52. The</page><page sequence="22">22 JAMES WHITLEY ET AL. excavation is scheduled to comprise three seasons and aims not only at improving the basis for the interpretation of the finds as well as the stratigraphy of the previous excavation (1969 1974), but also at contributing to a clarification of the long-term settlement history of Tiryns. The following objectives in particular are pursued: to gain new insights into the development of the exterior settlement of Tiryns between the EMyc (LH I?II) and the E Palatial periods (LH IIIA); to complete the ground-plan of the significant LH IIIA building complex uncovered in the earlier excavation and to investigate its integration into overall building concepts; to interpret the joint appearance of EIA graves and domestic remains in this area, and to create a basis for an assessment of domestic archi tecture and economy of the EIA. Shortly before the end of the excavation in certain parts of grid square L52 undisturbed Myc sediments dating not later than LH IIIB1 were encountered. The high percentage of LH IIIA, EMyc, MH and even EH pottery shows that a long chronological sequence is to be expected. In contrast to this, pottery of LH IIIB2 and IIIC date appeared only very rarely and exclusively as re-deposited finds in sediments of the 1st millennium BC or the Byz period. For yet unknown reasons, in this area of the lower town neither architectural remains, nor sediments of these periods seem to be represented. Among the finds from the undisturbed Myc sediments there are not only fragments of ceramic wasters, but also a small fragment belonging to the pierced floor of a kiln or a furnace. It seems as if in this area of the W lower town, pottery was produced during LH IIIA or IIIB1. Due to an extensive later disturbance, in most parts of grid square L52 no architectural remains and ground surfaces of SubMyc, ProtoGeo or Geo date were preserved. The one exception is a pavement consisting of small stones and some big pottery fragments, which reached into the SE-most corner of grid square L52. Among the sherds used for the pavement there is one belonging to a Geo vessel. In grid square L51 excavation stopped before the EIA levels had been reached, and thus there is hope to uncover better preserved features of the E 1st millennium BC there. In grid square L52 it was noted that in certain areas EIA pits cut deeply into the Myc sediment. Towards the end of the excavation it became evident that at least some of these disturbances can be attributed to the construction of graves. In the last days of the excavation two covering slabs of a large EIA cist grave were uncovered in front of the E profile of grid square L52 (Fig. 22). On top of the S edge of the slabs runs a narrow wall consisting mostly of small sized stones and a few stone slabs. Only its S edge follows a straight line, probably because the wall was built against the shaft of the grave. In the neighbouring profile, however, no disturbance by a shaft was visible in the earth above the grave. Currently, this is interpreted as a sign that the upper edge of the narrow wall corresponds approximately to the level from which the grave was cut into the underlying sediment. This view is supported by the observation of a thin layer of small sharp edged stones covering the E slab and approximately linking in with the upper edge of the narrow wall. The layer could represent the uppermost part of the fill inside the shaft. Between the stones of the layer there were chunks of 'asprochoma', and in the earth immediately above the layer the fragment of a human skull was found. This may indicate that the grave was opened, either for a new burial or for looting. In order to ensure a careful investigation of the grave, it was decided to postpone its uncovering until the next season. The centuries between the end of the Geo period and the beginning of the Byz period are only represented by fragments of a curved wall probably belonging to a building of oval or apsidal shape. The accompanying ground surface was nowhere preserved, but according to tile fragments found inside the wall the structure has a taq non dating to Cl or Hel times. At two places rounded openings were observed in the outer face of the wall, of which the E is distinguished by the use of a stone with a natural curved edge, thus emphasizing the wish to give the opening a round shape. That these openings were used for integrating posts into the masonry is suggested by their shape and position as well as by the discovery of small amounts of charcoal inside both of them. In between the stones of the wall several fragments of lime plaster were noted. This probably indicates that for the construction of the building a Myc ruin was dismantled and its stones used as building material without completely removing their plaster coating. M. von Aufschnaiter continued in October and November 2006 the investigation of the Myc systems of drainage of the upper citadel and lower citadel. In the course of the tachymetric measurements, which were conducted together with B. Tobias, another shaft of drain OB 9 was ascertained. Two drains (UB 7 and UB 8), of which hitherto only the lower openings in the exterior fa?ade of the E Cyclopean wall had been known, were identified inside the lower citadel. Moreover, the last preserved remainder of drain OB 12 was localized. In August 2006, in cooperation with A. Papadimitriou (4th EPCA) and U. Thaler, a new project of restoring and investi gating a large corpus of frescoes found between 1999 and 2001 in an excavation of the Greek Archaeological Service in the 22. Tiryns: EIA cist grave</page><page sequence="23">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2006-2007 23 area of the W staircase was begun. The new finds belong to the same fresco complex as the famous frescoes from 1910, and will add important new information to our knowledge of the fresco programme of the palace of the LI 3th Ct BC. The project is carried out in the framework of the Research Cluster 'Political Space' of the German Archaeological Institute. Eleftherotypia, To Vima and Ta Nea (01/03/2007) all comment on the problems of the erosion of the E galleries of the palace of Tiryns. Tumble from the walls has injured visitors, and immediate restoration work is needed. Salandi Didymon. A. Dellaporta (EMA) reports (ADelt B Chron 54 [1999], 1028-29) that the known EH site here is to become a registered archaeological site. The EH settlement, which extends for 400m along the beach to a d. of 3.5m, comprises several buildings with stone foundations but with curved walls. Recent finds include a quernstone and pounder. ARKADIA (once 5th, now 39th EPCA; 5th EBA) Eva Kynourias, Villa of Herodes Atticus. Eleftheros Typos (24/01/2007) and Kathimerini (09/03/2007) summarize the results of research at this extensive MRom (2nd Ct AD) villa, located 2km from Kato Doliana which shed light on the life of its owner, Herodes Atticus (103-179 AD). Finds include low reliefs; one of the largest mosaics known in Greece; an inscription giving details of the games organised by Herodes; many portrait busts, including one of Herodes himself in old age and another of the co-emperor, Aelius Verus. The reliefs from the so-called Heroon of Antinous, in an 'atticising' style reminiscent of the 5th Ct BC, are particularly noteworthy. Tegea. Knut Odeg?rd (outgoing Director, Norwegian Institute at Athens) provides the following special report on investiga tions (principally fieldwalking and geophysical survey) conducted in and around anc. Tegea. The Norwegian Institute at Athens has since 1990 concen trated an important part of its fieldwork on the Sanctuary of Athena Alea and the anc. city of Tegea. The Norwegian Arcadia Survey 1998-2001 had as one of its main aims the investigation of the extension of the anc. city through mapping and collection of surface finds (for a preliminary report see Odeg?rd, K., 'The topography of ancient Tegea: new discoveries and old problems', Ancient Arcadia, Papers of the Norwegian Institute at Athens 8, Athens 2005: 209-21). From 2003 a programme of magnetometric survey in the area of the anc. city has documented important parts of the plan of the city and what follows is a short, preliminary report on this new information. The area of anc. Tegea is today mainly agricultural land under cultivation. The centre of the city has since the LI9th Ct AD been located at Palaia Episkopi, where the remains of the Hel theatre are still visible under the MByz church. The Archaeological Service excavated what they interpreted as the agora to the NW of the theatre under the direction of T. Spyropoulos in the 1980s. The magnetometer survey, carried out by T. Smekalova of St Petersburg University, concentrated initially on an area to the W of the theatre and the so-called agora excavations. Very clear traces of rectilinear streets were immediately documented as positive magnetic anomalies, presumably because of pottery fragments used as paving for the streets. Through subsequent seasons of magnetometric survey in 2004 to 2006, several parallel and perpendicular streets were documented. The street grid seems to be based on a module (or ?nsula) of 75m by 25m, enclosing long, rectangular blocks in a per s trigas pattern (Fig. 23). The extension of this grid seems to coincide closely with the results from the archaeological survey, except in the N, where another grid with a different module has been traced (see below). Important new information has also been gathered on the location and the layout of the agora of Tegea. The agora must have been located in a large, rectangular space stretching W from the theatre. On the N side, the magnetometer images suggest that the street grid stops at a long, narrow building, probably a stoa. The street grid reappears to the S of the agora, with the same module (75m by 25m), albeit on a different rhythm of spacing. A similar stoa of Hel date was found by the Greek Archaeological Service aligned with the N wall of the theatre in the so-called agora excavations. This stoa evidently faced S and had several statue bases placed in front of it. The new stoa, documented by the magnetometer survey is, however, 25m further S, which probably means that the E end of the agora was extended to the N when the theatre was constructed in the 2nd Ct BC. Numerous furnaces, presumably for burning lime in the post Cl period, have been documented in this area. With this new and more precise location and layout of the agora, it is also clear that the 5th Ct AD Basilica of Thyrsos was constructed in the S part of the agora. New evidence has also been collected for the fortifications of the Tegea, which have for long remained an enigma. A double line of walls has been documented in the N part of the area of the anc. city and the street grid described above clearly stops at this line. There is also evidence for a series of square towers. So far, only one gate can be identified. The city evidently at one stage extended beyond this line, as indicated both by surface finds and streets on a different module identified by the magnetometer survey. The fortifications found by V. B?rard in the E 1890s further N are presumably a later enlargement of the circuit (see V B?rard, 'T?g?e e la T?g?atide I', BCH 17: 529-49). The street grid did not extend as far S as the Sanctuary of Athena Alea. This was also the impression given by the distri bution of surface finds from the Norwegian Arcadia Survey and it is by now virtually certain that the Sanctuary was located outside the city. The new information gathered by the magnetometer survey clearly documents the regular urban plan of Tegea. Without systematic excavations, the date of the plan must rely on surface finds and the characteristics of the grid itself. From the material collected during the Norwegian Arcadia Survey, the earliest conspicuous amounts of material from the area of the anc. city could be dated to the 2nd half of the 6th Ct. This impression has also been confirmed by the excavations conducted, but still unpublished, by the Greek Archaeological Service (I am grateful to Anna Vasiliki Karapanagiotou and to Th. Spyropoulos for this information). Perhaps even more significant were the fragments of architectural members collected in the agora area during the survey, including Doric capitals of the L6 Ct. The street grid itself is also of interest, as it shows aperstrigas system more at home in the Ar than the Cl period. The urban plan of Tegea is of great importance as one of the earliest, regularly planned cities of Greece. This is probably due to the relatively late appearance of urbanized settlements in Arcadia compared to neighbouring regions. The urbanization of Tegea was attributed by anc. authors to synoikism of several smaller and earlier settlements, presumably located on the hills around the plain. The urbanization in the LAr period therefore also involved a drastic change in the settlement pattern and a new exploitation of the fertile plain, which probably necessi tated a system of drainage for this flood-prone area that is</page><page sequence="24">24 JAMES WHITLEY ET AL. 23.

Mt Lykaion, Sanctuary of Zeus. Anastasia Panagiotopoulou (5th EPCA), Mary E. Voyatzis (ASCSA/Arizona) and David Gilman Romano (ASCSA/Pennsylvania) report on the 2006 season of excavation and survey. The work was divided into several parts. A topographical and architectural team continued the work of documenting the remains of the 67m /. stoa at the site. The architects are creating the first stone-for-stone actual-state drawing of the building. A series of steps or seats, ca 40m /., exposed to the N of the stoa and at a lower elevation, will also be drawn. Yanis Pikoulas (Thessaly) began his historical survey of the sanctuary and the general region of mount Lykaion. Mark Davison (Oregon) began a cultural landscape study of the region of the Sanctuary of Zeus at mount Lykaion, including considerations for the proposed national cultural park. Four trial trenches were opened in the area of the anc. hippodrome and its immediate surroundings. Working at the S aspect of the anc. facility a trench was opened to look for the S limit of the racecourse floor. A second trench was opened to look for the E limit of the racecourse floor near what may be the SE area of the hippodrome. A third trench was dug in the hippodrome floor, looking for evidence of the floor itself as well as looking for what may have been the dromos floor of the stadium (which is set inside the hippodrome). Bordering the SW side of the area of the hippodrome, on a slightly higher terrace, a fourth trench was dug and anc. levels were discovered. These four trenches yielded a large amount of anc. pottery sherds, roof tiles and some metalwork, including bronze coins and an iron blade. The finds have all been cleaned, conserved and are currently housed in the nearby Lykosoura Museum. The project website is http://lykaionexcavation.org. LAKONIA (5th EPCA; 5th EBA) Kouphovouno. C. Mee (BSA/Liverpool), W.G. Cavanagh (BSA/Nottingham) and J. Renard (EFA/Clermont Ferrand) report on the 2006 season of excavation at this MNeo to MH tell site. Excavation in 2006 was focused on three related areas: opening up an extensive sector in area C, concentrating on the MNeo architectural features; exposure of more MNeo architec ture in area G; a deep sounding, also in area G, to trace the LNeo to MNeo transition and to complement the deep sounding in area C which had been taken down to the natural soil in the 2005 season.</page><page sequence="25">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2006-2007 25 During the course of 2006 we exposed 121m2 of archaeo logical deposit in area C, partly uncovering features excavated previously but mainly by further extending the area of excavation to the N, E and S. A number of significant domestic installations and architec tural details were revealed in the N sector of area C, including a series of walls oriented N-S and E-W, at least one complete room and the remains of a building which was exposed only in part. The E wall of the building, 4.8m /., consisted of a foundation of rounded river stones set in an extremely compact, light yellow mortar and reaching up to 0.70m in h.\ its super structure had not survived, but a post setting at its N end and a number of other settings in the thickness of the wall indicated a wooden framework for the structure. A pivot stone marked the entrance at the N, in front of which was a porch enclosing a circular setting made up of flat cobbles, evidently a working area (Fig. 24). Similar settings, also of MNeo date, were found elsewhere in area C and in area G. The S wall seems to have been cut by a pit which apparently also destroyed the W wall of the complex. A good part of the interior of this room was covered by pebbles closely set into a compact clay cement; perhaps the bedding for a floor rather than the floor itself, as few artefacts were found resting on its surface. Similar pebble settings were also found elsewhere on the site in MNeo contexts. A sounding through the S wall, and through the floors on either side of it, revealed that the stone foundations of the wall rested on a dark surface, on which numerous finds lay flat. Above this were three further floor levels 3-5cm thick and all made up of a mix of materials, whose most marked character istic was that they were all burnt to a uniform colour. They were laid down after the construction of the wall, but whilst it was still in use. On the latest floor were found resting sherds, bone, chipped and polished stone tools. A further wall, belonging to another construction, formed the W edge of the latest aforementioned floor. This wall stopped just short of the S wall mentioned above, and in the corner between the two walls was found an oven, its floor and walls of reddened clay. In general the MNeo architecture in the S sector of area C had been subject to much more severe, later disturbance than was the case in area C N. After the removal of the surface plough soil a complex of inter-cutting stone rubble features was revealed, whose separation and excavation proved particularly problematic. Especially along the S edge of the area a number of levels were found to contain LNeo, Final Neo and some EBA material, as well as MNeo, these were interpreted as dumps, presumably due to levelling operations during the later history of the site. 24. Kouphovouno: setting of cobble stones within MNeo level In the centre of the trench a long linear stone feature was recorded running NW to SE. Composed of irregular and poorly sorted limestone and schist rocks and cobbles (0.03-0.48m), it was quite substantial (covering an area roughly 5m by 1,4m). At most it was four courses deep. On its N side it appeared to be delimited by rather large stones. On its S side the edges of the feature were not so clearly demarcated. Within it two postholes (0.54m by 0.46m, 0.24m d., and 0.37m by 0.17m) were noted. It appears that the first held a large upright timber and the latter a supporting post. What seemed to be the remains of clay plaster or rendering to this wall was also uncovered. The later phases of the MNeo period were also well represented in area C, in both the N and S. In some of the contexts here there were more coarse vessels, in particular bowls and jars with massive pedestal bases and also character istic cooking vessels, one of which was complete (Fig. 25). 25. Kouphovouno: MNeo cooking vessel There was also LNeo pottery from contexts in area C S, mixed with Final Neo sherds, which were mainly coarse and often decorated with finger-impressed cordons, and some EH I, again mostly coarse and occasionally red-slipped and burnished. EH II pottery, fine and coarse, was associated with a context in area G. The Rom pottery from the stone rubble dump on the W side of the area consists mainly of storage vessels but there was some table ware. The presence of combed sherds suggests a LRom date for this phase of activity. A figurine from area C is an example of the split type discussed by Talalay. The polished and chipped stone artefacts include a very fine flint blade, 9cm /. (Fig. 26). 26. Kouphovouno: MNeo flint blade</page><page sequence="26">26 JAMES WHITLEY ET AL. In area G, likewise, two distinct focuses of activity were the deep sounding and the extension of area G to the W, During the 2005 season, a 2m by lm sounding had been opened in area Gl, from a d. of 197.20 asl. MNeo to LNeo transitional pottery was found in the sounding, and it was decided this year to extend the sounding in order to get a fuller and more detailed sequence. The sounding was extended to measure 2m by 2m and this was excavated in four lm by lm grid squares by a series of spits (normally 0.10m deep). As the sounding was taken down changes were observed in the nature of the fill, and certain specific features, including pits, dumps of material and stone features, were distinguished; but none of these could be defined very closely as floors, post-holes or walls, as they tended to grade slowly into each other. As in the case of the upper, LNeo levels in this part of the site, we were led to speculate that these soft earth fills indicated that much of the architecture may have been of timber construction, resting here and there on stone pads and props, whose recognition is only possible through wide, open-area excavation. On the other hand the sounding yielded very much the sorts of information we were hoping for: a very rich ceramic repertoire, starting in the LNeo and stretching back well into the MNeo. Frequent rich deposits of carbonized matter yielded excellent samples of seeds and charcoal for bio-archaeological analysis. The sounding also provided an excellent series of chipped and polished stone tools, as well as rarer finds, including the terracotta female figurine described below (Fig. 27). By the end of the season the sounding had been taken down to a d. of 196.19 asl (site datum), that is to say 2m below the original ground surface, but without yet reaching the natural soil. The earliest pottery came from the deepest contexts in this sounding in area G. This is MNeo and predominantly fine with relatively few coarse sherds. A very high proportion of the pottery is painted, mainly monochrome but patterned decoration is also common, more so than scribble burnish, though this does occur. Evidently the pottery was principally used for the presentation or consumption of food and drink. As we had hoped, the MNeo-LNeo transition could be followed in this sounding. An increase in the proportion of coarse vessels is one feature of this transitional phase. Monochrome pottery is also very common but it can be difficult to distinguish Urfirnis and Black Ware. The linear decoration often looks LNeo but is lustrous rather than matt-painted, so this is a hybrid style. In due course the LNeo wares become predominant, particularly Black Ware, with Grey Ware, Matt Painted and some Polychrome as well. Of particular note was a terracotta female figurine from the sounding. This is reminiscent of the MNeo figurine found in 2002 but the decoration is in the transitional MNeo/LNeo style. Area G was also extended to the W in order to follow up the MNeo architectural elements which had been identified in 2005. Over the 2006 season an area of 35.2m2 was exposed. After clearing the plough soil, it became clear that the W half of the trench was taken up by a major stone rubble dump and related deposits, which were part of the fill of a cut or terrace. It seems likely that this is connected with the similar feature, uncovered in 2002, some 25m to the N in area E. The features in both E and G are part of a major reconfiguration of the W half of Kouphovouno dating to the LRom period. These fills were taken down sufficiently to allow, without fear of contam ination, the excavation of the MNeo levels, which were our main object. The central part of this MNeo area was occupied by a rectangular structure, marked by four walls; the N wall of the structure was curved. It appears that the floor in the centre of the room was largely destroyed by ploughing, but to its N was found a hardened surface with sherds lying flat on it, 27. Kouphovouno: MNeo figurine interpreted as a trampled clay floor, together with a cobbled area, similar to that found in area C. The NE corner of the room was cut and disturbed by an EH pit. The clearance of the Rom material enabled us to expose a N-S section through these MNeo deposits. This revealed that some depth of MNeo deposit had accumulated. This in turn had been cut by a circular pit, whose distinctive fill was clearly visible in section and in plan. None of these earlier MNeo levels was excavated. Into the pit-fill had been cut a foundation trench, into which had been placed the stone packing which formed the stone foundation of the superstructure of the room. The cobbled area, associated with, and to the N of the room, rested on top of the same pit fill. Careful excavation revealed that the other wall foundations in this complex were set in trenches, with larger stones at the centre of the trenches, and smaller stones, set vertically, filling the edges of the trenches. In the S part of this sector of area G, the corners of three other structures met with a cross-shaped rectangular space between them. Unfortunately the later destruction caused by LNeo, EBA and Rom activities left the MNeo remains in this part of the excavation fragmentary. Ian Whitbread continued to develop the methodology for his work on the pottery fabrics. The following is a brief summary of his fuller report. Fabrics were divided into a range of groups, defined in the first instance by wall thickness (&gt;4mm, 4-8mm, &gt;8mm), and were further divided on the basis of clay colour and inclusion</page><page sequence="27">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2006-2007 27 frequency and composition. It is anticipated that wall thickness is likely to correlate with inclusion size. Inclusions generally reflect the local geology: phyllite/schist for metamorphic rocks, limestone/calcite for calcareous regions and quartz for terrigenous sediments. Fabric properties were recorded with the aid of a hand lens (xlO) and stereomicroscope (xl8). Quantities of inclusions were assessed using a comparator chart, for which a fair degree of tolerance must be allowed. The ware definitions do not necessarily identify discrete pottery fabrics, but are a working model to be verified through further analysis and by correlation with other ceramics attributes, such as vessel shape, decoration and context. MNeo pottery is primarily oxidised and it is possible that 'orange' fabrics may be fired red under certain circumstances. The high quality of much of the pottery in manufacture, decoration and firing suggests that potters were careful in the production of their ware, and thus colour differences may be significant. This may be tested in terms of consistency of specific firing results against fabric, shape and decoration. Grey-fired pottery may reflect reducing conditions during firing or the remains of carbon from 'incomplete' firing. Some vessels appear to have oxidised external surfaces and grey interiors ('orange' and grey, red and grey wares), which are likely to reflect upside-down stacking and the resultant production of localized environments within the firing. This effect is likely to have been intentional since changing the stacking arrangement could easily have eliminated it. The reddish-brown fabrics appear to reflect a different clay body given distinctions in feel and hardness. The soft, coarse fabric would be consistent with cooking wares, although evidence of soot seems to be on internal rather than external surfaces. Geraki (anc. Geronthrai). J. Crouwel and M. Prent (Amsterdam, Netherlands Institute) report on the 2006 season of study and testing. The season was largely dedicated to the study of material excavated during earlier years, with particular focus on the EH II deposits found in different areas on the acropolis and on the Hel deposit from room 1 in building C. Moreover, one week was devoted to test excavations in trench 17/13k, which had been opened in 2005. With regard to the EH II period, study of the pottery confirmed a date of L EH II, contemporary with Lerna IIIC (L) for the destruction of the fortified settlement. While much of the fine ware pottery follows the EH II koine, it also seems that some shapes are particular to Geraki. Examples are what we have called 'kraters' and 'baking dishes'. There are also the coarse 'Geraki ware' storage vessels with their distinctive plastic surface treatment. In addition to the study of major pottery assemblages, a beginning was made with the study of the Ar to Hel terracotta votives. Also, most of the soil samples gathered during previous years of excavation were processed. The purpose of the test excavations was to remove the remaining collapse N of EH (fortification) wall 30, to define the hillside at the time of the construction and use of this wall and to gather dating material from below the level ofthat hillslope. The collapse consisted of large architectural stones fallen in a matrix of eroded mudbrick and wall fill, made up of cobble, gravel and sherd. The asociated pottery includes a mixture of Final Neo/EH I and EH I pottery with some clearly recogniz able EH II material in varying proportions. It was tentatively concluded that the two faces of wall 30 were constructed and filled early in EH II. Its construction may have been accompanied by a certain degree of leveling, with material from preceding occupation levels being used in the wall fill. Southern Laconia, coastal finds. A. Dellaporta and I. Spondylis (EMA) report (ADelt B Chron 54 [1999], 1023-25) on underwater finds along the coast. These are (from E to W, following the coast): at Kremmydi Monemvasias, Ayios Pavlos, Neo, BA and later (down to Ot times) finds, including pottery and obsidian, and three Rom shipwrecks; at Monemvasia, Leipsona, a PH stone anchor; by Prophitis Ilias in the demos of Neapolis (anc. Boiai) at a d. of 6-9m remains of a Rom wreck with numerous amphorae; by cape Zombola, remains of a submerged ECh basilica with three apses; in the area of Elafonisos, on the small island of Ailiotis, LRom finds; and between the small island of Pavlopetri and the cape of Elafonisos, a small anc. cist grave; near Archangelos, at Daliani, a limestone quarry, house remains with associated Cl pottery and tile; in the bay of Xyli some submerged house remains at Plytra and at Asprochortias a 500 ton wreck of a 2nd World War vessel; at Pounta to the W of cape Xyli, some submerged apparently Pal levels and stone tools; at Boza a little to the N, PH walls associated with MBA pottery and obsidian blades; at Epano Vatheio, at the Hotel Belle Helene, submerged LRom walls possibly associated with the known ECh of Ayios Nikolaos; at Trinaso, Valtaki LRom or Byz structures; at Gytheio, Ageranos Rom walls; at Porto Kagio in the Mani a Rom wreck; and finally, in the harbour of anc.

Papathasaniou (EPS) reports (ADelt, 1009 11) on the osteological examination of skeletons associated with the Myc (LH IIIA-IIIC) chamber tombs here (see AR 49 [2002-2003], 33; AR 51 [2004-2005], 30). The minimum number of individuals per tomb were: seven for tomb 2; fourteen for tomb 3; and fifteen for tomb 4 (with a minimum of 36 for the whole cemetery). Of these, only fourteen adult skeletons (six males and eight females) were in a sufficiently good condition to determine sex. The majority of skeletons (28) were of adults over eighteen years of age, only eight being juveniles under eighteen years of age. There were no juveniles under four years of age. The dental and other pathology of the skeletons was also studied. Monemvasia. A new study of this Byz and Med city is published: Ka??iya?, AT., X.A.

Forster BSA 13 [1906 1907], 299). Gytheio, Lakonis cave. E. Papayopoulou, P. Karkanas, E. Kotzabopoulou, K. Charvati and G.

Excavation concentrated on the micro stratigraphy of a lm2 area around a hearth, where 379 stone and 230 bone fragments were recovered. Dating of the earlier, predomi nantly MPal, levels of the hearth yielded a C14 date of earlier than 45-40,000 years BP, a date confirmed by additional radiometric dating methods (ESR, IRSL and U-series), all undertaken by the Kimmel Center for Archaeological Science, Weizmann Institute in Israel.

Gytheio, Lakonis cave: MPal Levallois flake general date in the MPal (90,000-35,000 BP). Stone tools from the upper levels, including some in a distinctive black flint, were typologically characteristic of the Upper Pal, particularly the EpiGravettian phase of Greece and the Balkans. In the study of the animal bones, several ox and deer species (Bosprimigenius, Cervus elaphus and Capreolus capreolus) could be identified. Alepochori, A Kouveleiki. E. Stravopodi (EPS) reports (ADelt, 1005-07) on further excavation of this cave. More fragments of pottery, stone (flint and obsidian) and human bone were recovered. A clearer report is given by Eleftheros Typos (31/08/2006) and Ethnos (06/09/2006), who summarize the investigations of this and one other cave, both occupied in Neo times (5300-3900 BC). Finds include flint and obsidian tools, marble figurines and some pottery, and animal bones (principally sheep/goat). These are interpreted as evidence for a mixed herding and agricultural way of life. Mani, Pal survey. A.

Moschou (5th EPCA) corrects two mistakes in AR SI [2005-2006], 41. The koinon of the Eleutherolakones [not Eleftherolakonoi] was founded in 15, not 146 BC, and the finds date after that. At the sanctuary of Kionia, the remains of two Doric structures (temples or heroa) are to be found, one peripteral (LHel) and one distyle in antis (Rom), both previously published by L. Moschou. MESSENIA(7th EPCA; 5th EBA) Anc. Thouria. Emmanuele Greco (Director, Italian School) and Xenia Arapoyianni (37th EPCA) report on the results of the 2006 season of collaborative survey at this anc. site. The survey has employed the 'urban survey' model, i.e. an analysis done within the limits of an urban centre. An ample portion of the city has been examined. Together with the results of the geophysical surveys and the analyses of the structural remains in situ, the investigation has provided a meaningful base of knowledge from which to begin a programme of stratigraphical analysis.

Petros Themelis (ASA) reports (Ergon, 32-43) on excavation in the agora, in the area of the theatre and the sanctuary of Artemis Limnatis during 2006. In the agora work concentrated on the examination of a rectilinear Hel underground structure built of limestone ashlar blocks held together with iron clamps covered in lead. Entrance was through a narrow opening, covered apparently by a stone lid (Fig. 29). This building is tentatively identified with the thesauros, or treasury, mentioned in Plutarch's life of Philopoimen (19), when the Messenians seceded from the Achaian league in 183 BC, which was then at war with Rome (see also Ta Nea 18/10/2006). The Messenians imprisoned and thereby suffocated the 70-year old Achaian general, Philopoimen, in this treasury. Further excavation in the NE corner of the agora confirmed the earlier hypothesis (AR 51 [2004-2005], 31) that the stoa had an exterior Doric row of columns and an interior colonnade in the Cor style. A further niche (2.58m by 6.5m) in the NE corner had two pilasters flanking two columns. Opposite the niche, a Byz kiln had been constructed from earlier spolia. Near this kiln but within the stoa two stone measuring devices for dry goods were found in situ, suggesting that this area was the agoranomion of Messene. In the theatre more re-used Hel pilasters were found incor porated in the Rom proscenium. Amongst the re-used material was a Hel inscription commemorating the Olympic victory of a Messenian in the boxing. In the E parodos the body of a Rom statue with a toga (Fig. 30) and in the W parodos a re-used fragment of a Cl (5th Ct BC) relief showing the head of one of the Dioskouroi, another fragment of which had been found in 2002 (Fig. 31), were found. Further seats and statue bases were also found. 29. Messene: Cl/Hel thesauros</page><page sequence="29">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2006-2007 29 30. Messene: body of Rom statue with toga 31. Messene: fragment of 5l Ct BC relief of Dioskouroi Cleaning, excavation and restoration took place in the Sanctuary of Artemis Limnatis, first excavated by Philippe Le Bas in 1842-1843 but subsequently covered by vegetation and partly looted. Le Bas recorded a Cor temple, distyle in antis, the remains of an altar and other architecture. The remains of a stoa and spring can still be seen. Cleaning revealed remains of a badly damaged pebble mosaic (decorated with spirals and maeanders) covering the floor of the celia of the temple (Fig. 32), the base of the cult statue and the altar. Isle of Sapienza, Porto Longo and islet of Boba. A. Dellaporta (EMA) announces (ADelt, 1029-30) that these underwater sites, some of the first to be investigated in Greece by Throckmorton in the 1960s, are to become protected sites. Methoni. I. Spondylis (EMA) reports (ADelt, 1025-28) on a survey of an underwater, certainly PH, archaeological site opposite the campsite here. Survey was undertaken in an extended area, close to where a small funerary structure containing two infants' graves associated with MH, principally Minyan, pottery had been investigated in 1993 and 1994. Survey revealed a total of four 'horseshoe'-shaped structures, surviving often to four courses, some with 'herringbone' construction thought to be characteristic of the MBA. The site is interpreted as a MH settlement, extending over an area of 12ha, later submerged after an earthquake. Iklaina. Michael Cosmopoulos (ASA) reports (Ergon, 43-49) on further survey and excavation in this area during 2006. A further 4.5km2 was surveyed in the SW, completing the survey which has been undertaken since 1999 in the area between Ano Englianos to the NW and Koukounara to the SE. This season's work turned up more LH III A-B sherds, but nothing that can be identified as a settlement. Excavation began at Traganes, where Marinatos had earlier uncovered remains of houses and wall paintings. Seven 5m by 5m trenches were opened to the NE of the tymvos, uncovering a long wall, a destruction horizon to the SE and a stone layer to the NW. Finds from the destruction horizon include animal bones (sheep, goat, pig, sea molluscs), flint and obsidian blades, and abundant MH III to LH I?II pottery (Fig. 33). Though no floor levels were found in association with the 23m /. wall, there were indications of its use in LH times. 32. Messene: Sanctuary of Artemis Limnatis after cleaning 33.

Davis (ASCSA/Cincinnatti) reports on the 2006 study season of finds from the survey and from Blegen's excavations at the Palace. Sharon Stocker and Jack Davis completed study of MH finds from two soundings conducted on the property of Giorgios Petropoulos in 1939. Headway was also made in examining post BA remains found in Blegen's excavations. The Englianos ridge, including the site of the palace, was the locus of activity in several periods after the BA. Additional study of fragments of wall-paintings from the palace, first identified in 2004 as part of a 'naval scene', has allowed significant parts of three ships to be restored. It has now been determined that this composition was originally located on the wall to the right of the doorway between hall 64 and lobby 66. Preparation by Joanne Murphy and Lynne Schepartz of a comprehensive published report on human skeletal remains and their contexts continues to progress. The results of recently completed stable isotope analyses of samples of human bone from graves show that males from higher status burials at Pylos consumed greater amounts of meat. Paul Halstead and Valasia Isaakidou's examination of faunal remains is nearing completion. Deborah Ruscillo studied all shell this year; the majority consists of murex that seems to have been crushed for the production of pigment. ELEIA (7th EPCA; 6th EBA) Olympia.

At Tripoptama a kiln was found and pithoi at Paliophyties, but the kiln was not for pithoi, and gives no clear indication of the location of the W cemetery of anc. Psophis. Leochorio is not to be identified as anc. Leontion. The sanctuary of Koria Athena is securely located at Agios Athanasios, a hill that forms part of the defensive circuit of anc. Kleitor. Lousoi. Veronika Mitsopoulos-Leon (former Director, Austrian Institute) and Georg Ladst?tter (Director, Austrian Institute) report on the 2006 season of excavation of this polis of anc. Arkadia. As in previous years, work concentrated on the public centre of the polis, where explorations of terrace I and of the peripteral temple were continued (AR 52 [2005-2006], 48-49). On terrace I, W of the peripteral temple, the preserved remains of a LCI oikos building and those of a Hel orthostat structure above it were fully excavated (Fig. 34). Of the rectangular oikos building (5m by 7m), lacking any internal subdivisions, the lowermost foundation course of local limestone and flysch rubble is preserved. Remarkably, the impact of the later orthostat structure on it is represented by punctual disturbances rather than complete demolition, which suggests an intentional respect for the older building. The deeper deposits in the interior of the oikos contained a handmade (cooking) pot with a vertical handle which can be contextually dated to Cl or earlier. The same context yielded a miniature krater, to be added to the LCI assemblage found in 2005, as well as a 4th Ct Arcadian coin. 34. Lousoi: Hel orthostat structure The orthostat structure (5.7m by 8.1m), now fully exposed, has an E entrance and is subdivided into a square E and a narrow transversal W room. A layer of green clay had been spread to support the floor level; it contained a LHel balsamarium and a Hel lamp. Together with two further Hel lamps from disturbed contexts, these should be seen as part of the 2004 assemblage which indicated that the structure served a cultic function. The close architectural connection between the oikos and the orthostath structure, as well as the fact that the LCI votive assemblage (2005) and the LHel ensemble with balsamar?a and lamps (2004) both suggest cult activities, strongly indicate continuity. Vessels found here throughout recent years have indicated banqueting, thus perhaps suggesting a hero cult. Work on the Hel peripteral temple with a peristasis of 6 by 15 pillars (15.8m by 42.35m), including a sekos (9.7m by 34.5m) with a pronaos to the E, concentrated in the E (Fig. 35). Architectural and stratigraphie evidence of the S peristasis proves that the sekos and the individual foundations of the portico were erected in one unified building phase. The lack of walling between the limestone slabs of the peristasis' supports, the unsettled floor level in the pteron area and the absence of any architectural elements of a superstructure all indicate that the portico, which was probably meant to be of wooden pillars, was never completed. In the fully exposed E hall of the sekos, a clay slab flooring is preserved in its entirety, except for some secondary modifi cations. As the E wall of this room displays a different walling technique from the rest of the sekos and contained a broken</page><page sequence="31">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2006-2007 31 floor slab in its foundation, it must postdate the initial phase of this hall (15m by 18m) with its five pairs of internal supports. It divided the hall in the middle. The E room thus created contained two large limestone slabs aligned with the supports of the pronaos or the E peristasis. The bases of the two S internal supports were removed to lay these slabs. Thus, the sekos of the intial Hel phase consisted, from E to W, of a pronaos with two supports in antis, an elongated E hall with the bases for a cult statue at its W wall, a square three aisled W hall and, finally, a transversal room. At an undeter mined point in time, the E hall of the sekos was shortened by 8m, so as to move the pronaos W. To this end, the original pronaos is dismantled down to its foundations, a new pronaos is created by adding a W wall in the E part of the original E hall, and bases for the supports in antis are laid to the E ofthat wall. The final abandonment of this apparently incomplete structure should be dated to the 1st half of the 1st Ct AD at the latest. Earlier architectural remains predating the Hel peripteral temple are indicated by an E-W running foundation noted intermittently under the W wall of the later pronaos. They appear to be unconnected with the original Hel temple. A lower-lying floor level of horizontally spread broken roof tiles in the S pteron also appears to belong to an earlier structure. Soundings down to natural level contained, for the first time, purely Ar ceramic assemblages, including larger fragments of a footless bowl. Together with fragments of an Ar Laconian roof found in previous years, the 2006 finds indicate a pre-Hel use of the area and suggest a predecessor to the Hel temple. Gremoulias-Kalavryta. Georgia Alexopoulou (6th EPCA) and Georg Ladst?tter (Director, Austrian Institute) report on the 2005 and 2006 collaborative archaeological investigations on the saddle of Gremoulias, 3.5km SE of Kalavryta. After a preliminary survey in 2003 (AR 50 [2003-2004], 35-36) excavations on the site took place in October 2005 and May 2006. So far, large sections of the substructure of an E-W oriented peripteral temple have been uncovered. Its peristasis measures 13.9m by 34.75m at the level of the euthynteria. The foundation is constructed of large limestone slabs; some areas of the bedrock had been prepared by cutting steps for the location of the foundation slaps. Several worked limestone blocks discovered at foundation level in the area of the NW corner had been moved here as spolia when that area was modified at some later point. In some places, the poros blocks of the euthynteria survived above the foundations. In the SE corner area there survives an ensemble of blocks laid as headers and stretchers. Above, the lowest step of the crepidoma in the same ensemble of poros blocks, set 0.12m behind the euthynteria, is preserved. The vertical joints in these two layers of blocks are finished with neat anthyrosis cutting, some are joined by iron clamps set in lead. The spoil from the topsoil immediately below the mod. surface contained numerous poros fragments from the super structure of the temple. Broken column drums, architraves, triglyphs, metopes and geisa indicate the Doric order of the colonnade. Immediately E of the peristasis about half of a poros architrave block has been found in its collapsed position (preserved /. 1.53m, h. 0.71m, w. 0.5m) (Fig. 36). The preserved lateral joint edge features anathyrosis and an axially placed clamp hole; on the heavily damaged posterior surface a clamp hole indicates a parallel placed second layer of blocks, thus indicating a total width of ca lm for the architrave. On its outer face, considerable portions of the stucco cover survive. The taenia, the side and middle regulae and the conically cut guttae are nearly undamaged. The measurements and **"?s? ,.%if^':' Mfrif*'?* 35. Lousoi: Hel peripteral temple foundations proportions of these small surfaces suggest that the recon structed length of the block, and thus the intercolumnation of the E fa?ade, was 2.5m, as deduced from the poros geison examined in 2003. The upper face shows a system of incised lines, which indicate the position of the triglyphs and metopes corresponding with the regulae below. Mixed with the poros fragments was a multitude of small broken pieces of pan and cover tiles from a Cor marble roof which should be assigned to the temple; a near-complete cover tile (21.1m by 69.6cm) was found underneath the collapsed architrave. Fragments of marble ridge palmettes and of two marble lions' head waterspouts have been recognized as well. The measurements of the euthynteria and the intercolumna tion of the E fa?ade, as deduced from the architrave, suggest a peristasis of 6 by 14 columns. Evidence for the sekos is still lacking. Two symmetrically placed E-W oriented stone settings revealed by soundings inside the building would produce a too narrow sekos than should be expected from the reconstructed column placement on the E fa?ade; thus, they cannot yet be interpreted. The elongated peristasis, the details of the finish of the Doric architectural elements and especially those of the Cor marble roof suggest the foundation of this peripteral temple in the L6th Ct BC. The re-used limestone blocks in the NW 36. Gremoulias- Kalavryta: fragment of architrave</page><page sequence="32">32 JAMES WHITLEY ET AL. section suggest later repairs to the building. Part of a rubble built E-W foundation 1.5m S of the N peristasis also represents a later modification, as indicated by its building technique and its higher level. Although the study of this building is only at its very beginning, the architectural evidence already known from the peripteral temple on the Gremoulias saddle indicates the construction of an experienced workshop. It is the first known evidence for canonical doric monumental architecture of LAr date in the NW Arcadian region of the poleis of Kynaitha (?) and Lousoi. Aigialeia. Angela Pontrandolfo (Italian School/Salerno) and Michalis Petropoulos (6th EPCA) report on the fifth season of collaborative survey work in the area, that is in the valley of the river Krios in the territory of the mod. municipality of Egira. As regards the PH period, the survey has demonstrated that the valley enjoyed consistent periods of occupation in the EH II period, especially on the left slope of the Krios. During this phase, three sites have been identified in the territory of Ambelokipi and four in the area of Vlachos - the existence of both was entirely deduced on the basis of the presence of potsherds. In the area of Kassaneva (Devinou-Paliomilos) remarkable archaeological sites have been identified thanks to their monumental character. The density of the settlement and the plans of the hypothesized residences can be compared with those of Lerna and Lithares. One such place is on a terraced plateau (220m asl): the settlement of the EH II is documented to an extent of 1.5ha, but is probably much greater, perhaps up to 6ha. For the periods from EH to the Ar there is a complete absence of documentation. In Hel times, however, traces of occupation on both sides of the valley are remarkable: on the right side, much evidence has been identified in the Oasis area; on the left side of the valley at the foot of mount Evrostina, in the Plakopetra area, remarkable wall structures, as well as areas with a high concentration of pottery, have been identified and may have been connected with agricultural installations. In the zone of Vovloka, on the right side of the valley, the survey has led to the identification of an installation of rural character, used up to LRom times. A Rom site has been identified on the left side of the valley, in the territory of Ambelokipi, in the Agios Ioannis area. The finds, together with the remains of a building of at least three rooms, lead us to hypothesize the existence of a rural installation of large dimensions, from the 1st Ct AD to the high Med period. Aigeira. Fieldwork in Aigeira (Achaia), directed by Georg Ladst?tter (Austrian Institute) continued, as in previous years, on the structures on the Solon terrace at the N of the acropolis (AR 52 [2005-2006], 49-50). Topographically belonging to the pre-Hel city, the structure in question is a guesthouse from the M4th Ct BC, which was enlarged elaborately towards the end of the 3rd Ct. About half of a functionally connected ensemble of rooms in the SE part of the enlarged building, first touched upon in 2005, could be excavated in 2006. This group of rooms consisted of a feeder room giving access to a waterproofed room to the S, and andron to the E, and a room of so far undetermined function to the NE (Fig. 37). The fully preserved floors of the feeder room and the andron/banqueting hall, took the form of hard terrazzo poured onto a supporting gravel layer, as well as a similar floor preserved in the S corners of the waterproofed room, these indicate the architectural and functional unity of this group of rooms. The roughly square feeder room (6.4m by 4.6m) is entered from the W and gives access to the other rooms through three doors. Robbing pits indicate that all three had thresholds and were closable. The andron (6.4m by 4.6m), diagnostic for the function of this ensemble of rooms, contains a slightly raised pedestal (h. 0.03m, w. 0.9m) in front of all walls, which indicates the canonic placement of nine klinai. Drainage of this room was achieved by an open drain in the SW corner of the pedestal and a further pipe whose mouth was located in the NE corner. Regarding the building's overall plan, this andron was placed in its external SE corner. A channel for clay piping, cut into the natural terrain immediately outside its E wall, of large conglomerate blocks clearly indicates that this is an external wall. The S wall was excavated only partly, but is built using the same technique, thus also representing an external wall. The remarkably large NE room (8m by 4.5m) is badly preserved. Its shape can be determined from a few preserved foundation blocks, but the floor had been removed entirely, so that its function cannot be assessed. Judging from our current level of information, the 4th Ct structure (270nT), interpreted on the basis of its large andron (eleven klinai) and four bathtubs as a public guesthouse, is enlarged in the L3rd Ct by the addition of further rooms to the S (30m by 13m), of which a functionally connected ensemble in the E is now mostly uncovered. The enlarged Hel building (630m") contains two andrones and, it appears, two bathrooms. In analogy to its LCI use, the Hel addition lacks the oikos or hearth room obligatory for a domestic dwelling. Therefore, a public function should also be assumed for the enlarged Hel structure with its two representative andrones as dominant architectural features (Fig. 38). To the W of the feeder room came the first evidence of a later use that took place after the intentional abandonment of the Hel guesthouse. Excavation partially revealed walls of rubble and broken brick, delimiting at least three rooms, with the substructure of a clay floor. The foundations and the floors are clearly at a higher elevation than those of the feeder room to the E; one wall directly abuts its blocked door opening. Future examination should clarify this post-Hel activity. In 2006, W. Gau? continued his study of Wilhelm Alzinger's 1972-1981 excavations on the SE plateau, below the acropolis. So far, the stratified material indicates periods from LBA to Hel. This topographically important area promises important answers to the question of how PH and EIA Hyperesia developed into historic Aigeira. 37.

KEPHALLENIA with ITHAKA (6th EPCA; 6th EBA) Kephallenia (Kephallonia) Poros, Drakaina cave. G. Stratouli and E. Chatziotou (EPS) report (ADelt, 1007-09) on further work at this cave, inhabited in Neo times and later re-used. Signs of Neo habitation were concentrated in trenches Z5 and E4 (already opened in 1995; see ADelt B Chron 50 [1995], 837-38; AR 47 [2000-2001], 45). Radiocarbon dates from the lowest levels indicate a date in the 2nd half of the 6th millennium BC for the earliest human habitation. Snail samples were taken for environmental analysis. Finds from these levels include animal bones and archaeobotanical samples. Pottery comprises Neo plain wares in both open and closed shapes, and a very small quantity of painted wares. The chipped stone (flint mainly) includes blades, arrowheads and possible fish-hooks. Other finds include ground stone axes and other tools (Fig. 39), some with scratch marks, bone bracelets and finger-rings, possibly made out of spondylus shells (spondylus gaederopus), and other stone and bone decorative objects. Later finds were more abundant in the new trenches opened. These comprised burnt animal bones, other burnt material and pottery of the 6th to 3rd Ct BC, which have been interpreted as signs of cult. There is also a small amount of residual PH, probably BA, pottery mixed in with these levels. Ithaka Eleftherotypia (17/11/2006) reports a claim that a stone object discovered in 1996 at the site of Ayios Athanasios is inscribed both with an image of a ship and with a sign in Linear B, which together are supposed to provide a link with the Odyssey. On a related theme, Ethnos (29/04/2006) reports the discovery of an EBA (EH II?III, 2500-2300 BC) wreck off the coast of Ithaca, containing over 40 ceramic vessels, indicating maritime trade well before the supposed date of Odysseus. AITOLIA/AKARNANIA (once 6th, now 36th EPCA; once 8th, now 22nd EBA) Playia survey. Franziska Lang (Darmstadt/DAI Athens) reports on the final last season of the German-Greek survey on the Plaghi? peninsula which took place in August/September 2006, under the direction of Lazaros Kolonas (General Directior of Greek Antiquities) in cooperation with the department of Classical Archaeology, TU Darmstadt (F. Lang), the architectural historian Ernst-Ludwig Schwandner and the Department of Ancient History of M?nster University (Peter Funke). This final season was devoted mainly to those areas that had been inaccessible in previous years for a variety of reasons. This comprises of the E part of the Plaghi? valley towards mount Prophitis Elias, the areas N and E of anc. Palairos and some areas in the NW of the peninsula. Furthermore, the processing of the small finds was completed and the study of a variety of sites was continued. As in previous years, we were able to improve our knowledge of the peninsula's settlement history through the discovery of hitherto unknown sites. The earliest such finds were Neo, while the most recent, as previously, were from the 20th Ct. Although the N slope of Palairos is very steep in places, some roads had been built here. They are aptly placed topo graphically, so that the lake can be reached by passing the steep slopes quite fast and relatively easily. W of the city gate, one reaches the so-called sanctuary of Artemis and then, through the Great Remma, which is terraced and rests on supporting walls, the suburban farms and, further up, the temple plateau. The area to the N of anc. Palairos, extending as far as the lake to the N and mount Tampia to the E, contained, amongst other things, a large anc. necropolis of Palairos. Its extent of nearly 2km, from the harbour gate E, was unknown so far. The finds are dated Ar to Hel. Cist graves were cut into the rock and covered with tiles. Occasional graves were entirely constructed of tiles. Extensive looting pits have destroyed many of the graves. Further evidence for the necropolis is provided by numerous fragments of grave stelae, mainly of local limestone, some of which bore inscriptions. On a plateau by the edge of the necropolis, halfway up the N slope, remains of walls and well-preserved buildings were found. The houses were erected in the 19th Ct, some of them on anc. walls.</page><page sequence="34">34 JAMES WHITLEY ET AL. \J\ ?&gt;??? P 0&lt; ?Q ?,B ?J 8 " 13 14 ~ ?H ~0 39. Kephallenia, Drakaina cave: Neo polished stone tools and bone ornaments The processing of the Palairos urban survey has shown that the acropolis was already settled in EH/MH. Evidence for a LH phase is still lacking - a phenomenon that applies not only to the Plaghi? peninsula, but to large swathes of coastal Akarnania. The plain to the E of Palairos was the location of anc. farmsteads, its slight rises were also the locations of 19thCt farms. One of the anc. ones belonged to the villa rustica type and was of generous scale, A probable peristyle is indicated only by column drums; there are also remains of a heating system. Another large building is indicated by well-hewn orthostaths with lifting holes. No further evidence of their original shape could be gained. Evidence of a Byz phase or any material up to the 19r Ct is absent so far. In contrast, the edges of the plain yielded Med material. The known anc. quarry at V?riko in the S of the peninsula was measured systematically; its extent was thus determined. The quarrying areas could be followed considerably further S then hitherto recognized; in some places, enormous worked blocks were located under water. The mod. bay is probably the result of extensive quarrying. A small plateau above the bay contained some areas of red soil that contrasted markedly with the general yellow-brown clays. Closer examination showed that they contained handmade pottery. Perhaps they are the results of an EH/MH urn cemetery. After the completion of fieldwalking in the E Plaghi? valley, it is clear that this area was used for settlement especially in L antiquity Hardly another area in the peninsula has such a concentration of sites from that period. The position of sites, however, indicates dispersed settlement or individual farmsteads rather than a coherent settlement. Numerous amphorae, presses and mills are evidence for agricultural activity. Once more, a small post 16th Ct village (Palaich?ri, E of mod. Peratei village) was discovered, hidden in the interior of the peninsula. Similar topographic locations having been encountered already in earlier seasons, this supports the conclusion that 1611 to 18th Ct villages were not located coastally, but far inland, in places not easily visible from the sea. A small hilltop church is from the same period. Since no further building remains were in its vicinity, our typology places it in the group of rural churches outside settlements, which are quite common in the peninsula. Survey of the high summit of Lamia, the striking NW terminal of the peninsula, contradicts earlier views which claimed no trace of human activity could be found here. The summit is encircled by a wall that forms part of a mod. bastion. From it, there are strategically optimal panoramic views of the Ionian Sea, Levkada and Preveza. A further site was discovered on the coast, NW of Peratei?/Ag. Barbara village. It is characterized by a large scatter of Cl material (pottery, tiles, cut stone). The extent of this site suggests a hitherto unknown large anc. settlement. Palairos. A. Dellaporta (EMA) reports (ADelt, 1022-23) on work undertaken by D.

Apogevmatini, Ethnos (29/03/2007), Vradyni (22/03/2007) and Eleftheros Typos (23/03/2007) report on a summary of five years of investigation of this walled city, which may be anc. Mitropolis, situated next to the river Acheloos. The city is surrounded by a formidable outer fortification wall, 1.65 km /., enclosing an area of 7.5ha overall. Within this is a fortified inner enclosure (1.4ha) and a fortified acropolis and refuge (0.5ha). The outer wall has a sophisticated gate ('court gate') similar to the Arcadian gate in anc. Messene. Differences in the style of masonry (polygonal in places, isodomic in others) indicate different phases of construction of the fortification from the 5th to the 3th Ct BC. Little remains on the surface of the Cl-Hel houses within the city, though one building with multiple rooms can be distin guished. Finds of Geo-Ar pottery, bronzes and graves of the 8th?6th Ct BC, various Ar inscriptions (some from tombs and one important 6th Ct inscription) indicate that the settlement is of some antiquity.

Similarly, investiga tion of deposits around the EIA Megaron B, constructed in the 11th Ct BC and abandoned around 800 BC, revealed no definite traces of burials or cremations underneath or around the structure. A deposit of ash with iron weapons, which the excavator had earlier (Ergon [1993], 56) interpreted as indicating a possible cremation, turns out to be a dump created by Soteriades, the contents of which probably relate to activity at the sanctuary from 800 BC onwards. He concludes that there is no positive evidence for either ancestor worship or hero cult here at Thermon. Analogies between either of these structures and the Toumba building at Lefkandi are illusory. PHOKIS and WEST LOKRIS (10th EPCA; 7th/lst EBA) Delphi.

Area of Karystos, Kampos Survey. Zarko Tankosic and Donald Keller (Canadian Institute/Toronto) report on the first (2006) season of a new survey project in the alluvial Karystian Kampos (plain) located W of the town of Karystos, S Euboea. The goals of the survey are: to examine a hitherto archaeo logically poorly known part of the Karystia; to methodologi cally and spatially connect the previously surveyed areas in the region where different survey methods were employed; and to test the hypothesis that some of the mod. roads or trails were also used in anc. times. The survey methodology during the first season consisted of following non-random transects that were predetermined either by natural features of the investigated landscape, such as streambeds or by man-made alterations, such as roads and trails. These transects were supplemented by two long artificial transects encompassing the limits of the survey area, which followed the natural boundary of the Kampos at the foothills of the surrounding hills N and S of the plain proper. The transects were ca 10m to 30m wide, with investigators</page><page sequence="36">36 JAMES WHITLEY ET AL. spaced 10m from each other. In addition, some discrete features of the landscape adjacent to the transects were surveyed in their entirety if they looked promising as potential fmdspot locations. A total of twenty findspots were discovered during the first field season with about 75% of the planned transects investi gated. Their exact location was recorded on the map using a GPS navigation system, material from the surface was selectively collected, and each fmdspot was assigned with a number. Most of the findspots consist of material scatter on the ground surface (fifteen), while several also have accompanying features (five), in this case defined loosely as architectural remains, altered natural features, pits, cairns or similar. On four occasions, findspots consist only of features without any accompanying material. Chronologically, the most numerous group of findspots contains material identified as L Rom in date (twelve). In addition, three findspots have a Byz component to them, and one, or possibly two, are definitely identified as Cl in date. Finally, there are four findspots that contain material of likely PH date (mostly identified by pottery, obsidian and several PH quern stones typical for the area). Two findspots are undated at the moment. As particularly significant finds of the 2006 season we can point out a Cl rural sanctuary and a large PH (most likely Final Neo or BA) obsidian scatter with little other accompanying material (06N16). The preliminary results of the survey suggest that at least the route of the main mod. road connecting Karystos to Marmari (which, more or less, follows the route of the older road that dates to at least the beginning of the 19th Ct) could have been used as a thoroughfare in anc. times, since there are a number of findspots located along its course, supplemented by a number of stray finds (e.g., random pottery sherds, sandstone Rom building blocks, etc.). Also, our finds indicate that most of the alluviation in the Kampos plain happened sometime before the Rom period, regardless of whether it was in the form of a single event or a long-term continuous process. Naturally, these observations are preliminary and a lot more study is required. Amarynthos. Thierry Theurillat (Swiss School) reports on test trenches near Amarynthos undertaken in 2006. After a geoelectrical survey carried on in 2003 in the E vicinity of the mod. village of Amarynthos, test trenches were opened at the foot of the hill of Paleoekklisies. The goal was to discover the location of the Sanctuary of Artemis Amarysia. No archaeological remains clearly related to religious activities were found. Instead, a few MH walls and structures were discovered that could belong to the MH settlement excavated on top of the hill of Paleoekklisies (sqqAAA 12-1 [1979], 3-14; Archeion Euboikon Meleton 28 [1988-1989], 91-104). An adult inhumation with no finds associated was buried at the junction of two MH walls. Nearby, a coarse ware pot was found intact, carefully placed into a pit and its bottom inten tionally pierced. The function of this structure and its relation ship with the burial are not clear. Layers covering the MH settlement have revealed a rich stratigraphy with LH III, ProtoGeo, SubProtoGeo and LGeo pottery. No structures can securely be associated with these periods, except for a LGeo-EAr bothros filled with stones and pottery, among which was found a complete pithos of large size. A long wall, poorly constructed and built upon a thick layer of Cl-Hel pottery, was followed in several trenches N of the investigated area. It is interpreted as a retaining wall or a limit bordering an anc. road. Eretria. Thierry Theurillat (Swiss School) reports on the re excavation of a sanctuary on top of the acropolis undertaken in 2006. In 2006, Sandrine Huber in collaboration with Sylvian Fachard conducted an excavation on top of the acropolis of Eretria. Previous excavations in 1993 and 1995 (AKunst 38 [1995], 108-19; AKunst 39 [1996], 107-11) brought to light a Neo, MH and LH settlement and an Ar-Hel sanctuary (7th-2nd Ct BC). The goals of the 2006 campaign were to extend the perimeter of investigations around the sanctuary, to identify the divinity to which it was devoted and to assert its connection with the fortification wall (Fig. 42). Excavations were stopped above the PH layers. The Hel sanctuary consists of a large esplanade (A), carefully cut horizontally in the bedrock at the end of the 3rd Ct BC. It was extended to the W by an important fill limited by two parallel walls and closed by a wall and a rectangular structure, partly destroyed by the erosion of the cliff. The latter . consists of three long blocks retaining an internal fill whose function remains unclear. The whole EW terrace is 28.20m /. and some 7m w. Numerous votive objects from the Ar-Hel periods were found from the beginning of the excavations in the natural crevices as well as in the fill of the terrace: more than 100 terracotta female statuettes, among which were a few papades, Ar miniature hydriai and high-necked pitchers, two bf epinetra, fragments of bronze objects (dipper, oenochoe, tripod), as well as dozens of spindle whorls and loomweights. The main discovery of the 2006 excavation is a fragment of an Ar Cyprio-Ionian limestone sculpture representing a lion, with the name of the goddess Athena (AGENAIEZ written in retrograde) carved on its back (Fig. 43). This inscribed object together with an EC1 terracotta appliqu? showing the lower part of a feminine figure probably wearing an aegis encircled by snakes leave no doubt that the sanctuary at the summit of the acropolis was dedicated to Athena. N of the rock-cut terrace (B) was excavated a layer containing Ar pottery (including some fragments of small bf lekythoi), seven Hel walls poorly preserved and a few Hel female terracotta statuettes. This ensemble remains difficult to interpret and its connection to the sanctuary cannot be clearly determined. A lower terrace (C, 27m by 15m) lies to the S, limited by an E-W wall (Ml3), carefully built, which re-uses the bedrock to form a large and well leveled stylobate. Several walls and rich material were brought to light within the terrace. Worth mentioning are several fragments of Ar terracotta reliefs showing a frieze of warriors fighting on horses and on foot (Fig. 44), which probably adorned the walls of a public building. The excavation of the whole S terrace is planned in 2007. Some 20m NE of the sanctuary, a trench was opened through a wide platform between the highest point of the acropolis and the city wall, near the N tower. The objective was to assess the extent of the religious area and, if possible, to verify the chronology of the fortification, thought to have been constructed in ca 400 BC. The excavation reached a d. of 2.20m and exposed walls dating to the MH period (?) as well as a multiple grave containing the remains of at least two children. The Cl fortification is composed of a double-face wall 2.10m w., filled with packed rubble. The masonry is polygonal and reached ah. of 1.20m. It was not possible to establish a more precise chronology for this section of the city walls; the stratified pottery suggests a construction in the 5th CtBC.</page><page sequence="37">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2006-2007 37 ERETRIA - Acropolis N ion \&amp; "North tower *2P 42.

Irene Lemos (BSA/Oxford) reports on the 2006 excavations at Xeropolis: This year we have made a number of significant discoveries in both regions (I and II); they allow us to appreciate better the great importance of the settlement during the end of the LBA and the early stages of the EIA. The 2006 excavation brought to light unexpected finds never encountered before on Xeropolis. In region II, a substantial 'wall1 running NW/SE was discovered, dividing the area into two zones (see below for a detailed report). N of the 'wall', the soils slope down in a depression; it was there and mainly in ProtoGeo contexts that a number of clay figurines were found broken amongst stones: we found among them two bulls, the model of a boat and the head of a probable centaur. It is clear - because of its structure and size - that the 'wall' was not that of a building; it could have been a 'terrace wall' or a city wall. Equally important were the results of the excavations in region I: by the end of the season it had been shown that the substantial wall found in 2004 belongs to a ProtoGeo/Sub ProtoGeo 'megaron', resembling in construction - though not in its scale - the monumental building at Toumba. In region I the focus of the excavation was in area M and especially in the area around the substantial wall found in 2004. Area P was further investigated; it is located SW of the LGeo house excavated by Popham and Sackett in the 1960s. This year the excavations in area P revealed several LBA and EIA structures and soils. In area M the N/S passage-way was called the 'Sunken Way' in the 2004 reports. However, further excavation in this area considerably affected our understanding of the passage and its surrounding region. First, it became clear that although we have overestimated its depth, we did not misunderstand its overall purpose and character. Moreover, it was revealed that this N/S passage-way was not only used in the EIA but it had a LH IIIC predecessor. The main reason for our earlier assumption considering its depth was that in 2004 we were excavating the part of the passage where a LGeo pit was later dug. The opening up of the area around the N/S passage-way revealed that the substantial wall to the E of it, which was discovered in 2004, was not just defining and marking the passage but was the W wall of an edifice of ProtoGeo/Sub ProtoGeo date ( 10th-9th Ct BC). This building, now called the Protogeometric 'megaron' (Figs 45 and 46) is clearly of a higher quality of architectural construction than any of the EIA structures recovered on Xeropolis so far. Most interestingly, the way it is built recalls the ProtoGeo building at Toumba, though it is smaller: the associated ceramics provide a ProtoGeo/Sub-ProtoGeo date. The internal size of the 'megaron' is at least 13m N/S by some 7.5m w. E/W, with the walls' widths adding lm more. The 'megaron' is defined mostly by its excellent W wall, and to a lesser extent by its E wall. The S limits are only partly known: they involve both a small fragment of walling and a number of postholes. At the N end, all traces of walls are removed by erosion of the tell in that part of the hill; thus it is not clear whether this was an apsidal or a rectangular building. The E wall - much robbed to the S - offers a different picture in part: here, as in the W, flat basal slabs were used, but it appears that the E wall was set on the top of an earlier LH IIIC wall. So far a number of postholes have also been uncovered inside the building. The postholes were circular (some 0.2m di.); there are none, however, perfectly aligned with the two N/S walls. Further internal divisions can be seen by a series of smaller postholes found in the N part of the building and running E/W (these are also circular and about 0.15-0.2m di., but not so convincingly arranged in a single straight line). Accompanying them are at least two larger circular pits discovered in the same area (some 0.7-0.8m di. and 0.6m d.). It is possible that these were receptacles for large storage vessels (similar to those found in the apse of the Toumba building). If the E/W line of postholes divided the building into a N and a S part, then it is interesting to note that these two sections might have had different types of floors. It is probable that the N part was strewn with pebbles which provided a compact surface, whilst in the S part, a mud-brick surface was used Other furniture inside the building is limited to a number of large stones, mostly set in the W half of it. At least two of these have been roughly worked into their present sub-circular outline: they are both directly set on or above the 'megaron' floors. It is possible that both are re-used LH IIIC post-pads. The absence of finds other than ceramics suggests that after it ceased to be used, the ProtoGeo building was cleaned out. Interestingly, while the E wall was much robbed over time, most of the W wall was kept standing to a degree. The reason for this must be that the wall continued to mark a boundary to the W where the passage-way was still in use for a time. 45. Lefkandi: ProtoGeo 'megaron' plan 46. Lefkandi: ProtoGeo 'megaron'</page><page sequence="39">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2006-2007 39 The 'megaron' was built almost directly above an earlier LH IIIC structure: the use of the same space and the re-use of earlier walls and features cannot be coincidental. Area P (region I) was first excavated in 2004, when a pair of E/W walls was uncovered along with associated finds and a pit. These finds were dated to EIA occupation levels and some immediately to earlier phases covering the transition from the LBA. In 2006, the excavation yielded within a space of a mere 6m2 a palimpsest of overlying buildings (up to nine separate structural phases), several of which show re-use of the same physical lines and walls. The earliest phases of occupation in area P are dated to LH IIIC. Noticeable features discovered in this stage are the use of a series of mud-brick containers along wall 94 and the discovery of one burial below the floor. The latter is a common practice on Xeropolis during the LH IIIC period. Above that level, a house built during the LH IIIC period suffered a destruction accompanied by fire. The next use of the area is associated with the appearance of a series of postholes; at present they form part of an apse, suggesting that an apsidal structure was erected into the remains of the earlier LH IIIC levels. Alternatively, the postholes might have been part of a cross wall of a larger building. Further excavation to the W and to the S is necessary to fully understand the architecture and the history of these structures. Their importance is great when we take into consideration that it was on the floor of one of these houses that a figurine - possibly of a centaur - was found in 2004, dated to the EProtoGeo period. Next came another building which is found a little offset to the N. It is represented by a single wall, very little of which has survived, though some very fine ProtoGeo and SubProtoGeo pebble spreads are most likely associated with it. The complexity of the archaeology in area P is obvious and it was clearly caused by the constant re-use of it without much contemporary build-up of soils. It is thus necessary to extend the excavation to the S where, by having a larger area to investigate, the chances of reconstructing the architectural sequences of the area will be increased. Region II is located some 150m to the W of region I. Two main areas were investigated: area Q to the SE, and area R, to the NE. Region II was one of the areas where a geophysical survey was carried out in 2005. The excavation of 2004 in this region revealed that the tell here appeared to drop away to the N, well within the confines of the mod. hilltop. An extensive geophysical survey by A. Saris in 2005 (see AR 52 [2005-2006], 62-63) showed potential wall lines running straight over extensive distances in this area: the possibilities of a boundary wall located in this area were clear. The same survey also indicated a wealth of unusual alignments and features to the S of the possible wall. Accordingly two adjacent areas were opened up this year: area Q to the S was expected to reveal traces of the settlements; and area R the possible boundary wall to the N. It became swiftly apparent that the geophysical survey was not reliable in area Q. However, in area R, the results are far more accurate, if only because there are not the same stacked underlying features. The excavation area Q came down at once upon a N/S road apparently flanked by an area of domestic use and defined by low periboloi. This year, a zone to the E of the road was first chosen for excavation. A total of eight trenches were excavated (some 200m2 were ultimately opened). These revealed a house, structures which might have belonged to sheds or been auxiliary to the main houses and open spaces, most probably yards. All walls have been damaged and reduced by plough, but are also of a very low standard of construction. The main house now comprises a 4m by 4m rectangle, defined mostly by three walls. Its N side is missing and it is not certain that it had one. Some very large blocks of stone appear to offer terminations to both the N/S wall-lines, as might a posthole at the E one. Its S wall is also the N wall of another room/space to the S, made up by a further three walls. It is a rectangular room of 3m by 1.89m. At present it has no obvious means of entry, but as the walls are now low and comprised mostly of small stones, it is possible that some part might have acted as a raised threshold. Another possibility might be that this was a basement room, though the poor quality of the walls makes it hard to determine whether they were ever fit to support an upper storey. The 'floor' of the room in its interior was distinctly different in colour - browner - than that of the greyer-dominated soils found outside. This room also makes evident that here too earlier LH IIIC walls were partly demolished, and at the same time were also pressed into use to provide footings and actual wall stones. To the W of the house, an open space or yard contains two ancillary structures: one, a rectangle of 3m by 1.8m, is attached to the S side of the main unit. In the outside space to the SW of the house another wall must have been part of another structure erected in this open space. A further wall may represent the N side of this structure. The discovery of a low basin of clay at the W and a hollow (? pit) near here with many large ceramic fragments and bones in it, taken together with the grey/pebble flooring, suggest an exterior work-place, perhaps roofed in a simple manner. Many spindle-whorls of clay were found in the general yard area, showing typical domestic activities. These levels and structures represent the first clear horizon of this period (very L stages of LH IIIC and SubMyc) found on Xeropolis. Area R yielded interesting results this year too. First, it is noticeable that a remarkable change in the archaeology occurs immediately below the mod. top-soils. This appears only 10m to the N of area Q. First, in an area of some 9m E/W by 1 lm N/S, there is hardly a single standing structure. This is unpar alleled elsewhere on Xeropolis. Instead of any evidence of standing structures, there is first a broad zone (some 6-7m N/S) which gently slopes down to the N and then, further to the N, a substantial wall. The zone is made up of small stones and pebbles, broken LH IIIC pottery and bones. Some wall stubs and other features to the S of this zone indicate that perhaps there were once some buildings there, but apparently these were removed deliberately to create this empty space. The zone ceases some l-2m S of a wall which was discovered to the N. The NNW/SSE part of the wall is wall 118, which turns at its W end into a N/S spur, wall 121. The main wall continues to the E out of the end of the trench excavated this year. The anc. landscape drops gently down to the N of the wall over 6-8m into a hollow where again no structures have been found. The wall divides the area into two regions, topographically as well as in the nature of the deposits. The wall is set into an extensive spread of relatively light brown soil - a chalky/limestone marl. This at present does not appear to be a naturally occurring band of geological deposition; it does contain very small numbers of sherds and fragments of mud-brick. What we have here is a massive work of engineering; a deliberate landscaping was undertaken in order perhaps to facilitate the approach to the settlement from the isthmus to the N. The main wall was inserted into these paler soils described above. The courses below the ground surface of the time were set broader to provide a wider base, and were not faced.</page><page sequence="40">40 JAMES WHITLEY ET AL. Above the contemporary ground level, the wall has proper facings in and out. How high it once stood is not obvious - some 0.5m now remains. It was reworked in later stages and it was then provided with a slightly broader base on the then ground surface. So far, the excavation has revealed soils of ProtoGeo date which were deposited in the 'depression' on two occasions. The first, deposited from the W, is marked by smaller stone sizes and considerable amounts of pottery. On its surface and in the accumulated stone-free soils above it were retrieved some remarkable clay figurines: two of bulls, but, more importantly, a model of a boat with remarkable details (Fig. 47) and the head of another centaur (Fig. 48), perhaps double the size ofthat recovered from the Toumba burials. Lastly further stones came in from the E side, partly covering the earlier deposits. Over all this were strata more reminiscent of top soils, in an apparently more or less continuous process of deposition. If this deposition indeed represented deliberate human action then it may be that the deposit marks a deliberate 'ritual' destruction. PHTHIOTIS and EAST LOKRIS (14th EPCA; 7th EBA) Halai and E Lokris project. John E. Coleman (Cornell/ASCSA) reports on the 2006 season of study and conservation. Study continued on the architecture and finds of the Neo period from the acropolis of Halai, particularly the pottery. We also carried out cleaning of our excavated trenches and erected a temporary protective roof over the Neo remains in area F. Mitrou. Eleni Zahou (14th EPCA) and Aleydis Van de Moortel (ASCSA/Tennessee) report on the third (2006) season of excavation and study at this important BA-EIA site. Excavation in 2006 primarily focused on two areas in the NE (plots 10, 12) and NW (plot 6) of the islet. In the NE area we opened two new trenches, and we excavated deeper in many previously dug trenches to a maximum depth of ca 1.60m below the mod. surface. In the NW area of the islet we opened four new exploratory trenches. In the three seasons of excavation at Mitrou (2004-2006) we have exposed a total area of 446m2 or 1.2% of the site. Before excavating each trench we conducted a close-grained pick-up vacuum survey of its surface as well as of the adjacent area. The total area surveyed from 2004 to 2006 covers 4,075m" in the N part of the islet, representing 11.3% of the site. The material recovered from the surface survey has been stored for future study. In addition, an area 20m /. of the E sea scarp of the islet was cleaned and its stratigraphy documented. A total of 25 occupational levels were identified in this scarp. A limited strati graphical excavation produced material for dating those levels. Our excavations in 2006 uncovered a rectangular monumental structure, labeled building D, underneath LH IIIC building B in the NE part of the islet. Constructed in the MH/LH I transitional phase, building D measures 13.5m by 8.25m and its walls are on average lm thick, built with roughly cut rectangular stones. The function of building D is as yet unknown, and neither do we know whether building D was free standing or part of a larger architectural complex. Some time in the LH II phase, an infant was buried to the E of building D in a pit grave protected on one side by a large pithos fragment (grave 21). With the infant a corroded small bronze disc (LP784-091-013) was found, but no pottery. Building D was destroyed by natural or human causes during the LH IIIA phase. 47. Lefkandi: ProtoGeo boat model in situ 48. Lefkandi: head of ProtoGeo centaur figurine To its N, building D was bordered by a pebbled area of as yet unknown width. To the W of building D was a 3m wide pebbled street separating building D from building F. Building F had thinner walls built of smaller stones than building D. It was destroyed in the LH IIIA2 E phase, perhaps contemporary with building D. In the subsequent LH I1IA2 and LH IIIB phases we have detected only limited human activity in the NE area of the islet in the form of informal surfaces and pottery dumps. In 2006 we also uncovered the SW part of LH IIIC building B, the large structure discovered in 2004 that had been built on top of building D. The very corner of building B is missing, so we do not know whether its W wall formed a corner with the S wall or extended further S to form a porch. In a new trench to the N of building B we uncovered the corner of a structure of LH IIIC date.</page><page sequence="41">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2006-2007 41 At the transition of the LH IIIC to the EProtoGeo phase, the settlement area to the N and W of building B was turned into a burial plot, mostly for children's graves, but with one adult grave. In 2004 and 2005 we uncovered nine cist graves ranging in date from EProtoGeo to MProtoGeo. In 2006 we found four more cist graves dating to the MProtoGeo (graves 11, 13) and LProtoGeo (graves 26, 27) periods. Grave goods were confined to pottery vessels, a bone tool, a pig jawbone and a few shells. Asmall folded gold leaf (LM783-015-012) found in a disturbed area E of grave 13 may have come from this grave. Three more cist graves are probably ProtoGeo in date because of their stratigraphie position (graves 14, 16, 17). Over the NW corner of building B we had found in 2005 small structure C, which contained 22 miniature handmade vases and a cooking pot. Our study of the pottery has now shown that this building went out of use in the EProtoGeo phase. Excavation below the earthen floor of this building in 2006 uncovered a small pottery deposit consisting of three miniature handmade vessels of similar style to those of the floor deposit, as well as a handle that joined with a miniature bowl of the floor deposit. These finds suggest that the lifetime of building C had been relatively short. Built inside the S part of building B was apsidal building A, which we had found during the 2004 season. A 2005-2006 sounding dug below the apse of building A showed that it had been constructed in the EProtoGeo phase. The building went out of use in the MProtoGeo phase. In 2006 we excavated more of the MProtoGeo floor deposit, including a restorable handmade amphora sunk into the floor just E of the two transversal rows of support bases that closed off the apse. We also determined that the crosswalls to the SE of these support bases do not belong to building A but to a LProtoGeo building which appears to have destroyed part of building A. Thus the last substantial occupation that we have uncovered on the islet can now be dated to the LProtoGeo phase. In the NW area of the islet four ProtoGeo cist graves were found. Grave 12 contained the bones of an infant and an adult buried with ceramic vessels. Grave 18 held an infant buried with a bronze fibula and seven ceramic vases. Cist graves 22 and 28 held burials of adults without grave goods. Also here the graves had been placed among the ruins of LH IIIC buildings. Our 2006 excavation confirms the widespread expanse of occupation in the N part of the islet in this period. A rectangular room of the LH IIIC period was found in trenches LE795 and LF795, and walls of the same period were found in trenches LH792, LG789 and LD791. It is clear that in all trenches in the NW part of the islet, LH IIIC buildings were constructed on top of LH IIB-IIIA buildings, adopting the same orientation but using a different building style. LH IIB-IIIA buildings have socles made with flat stones, whereas the later buildings were constructed with small stones. Trenches in the NW part of the island went deep in order to expose the stratigraphie sequence. In trenches LE795 and LF795 a rectangular room was uncovered with a clay surface at +4.61, on top of which were a clay portable table, stone grinders and pithos fragments. From the same depth we gathered LH I polychrome pottery of northern style. Wall socles and surfaces were also found in the other trenches (LH792, LG789 and LD791), but no room plans were exposed. The remains of the LH I settlement cover a L MH burial plot, which was first encountered in 2005 when cist grave 10 was found. In 2006 we exposed two more cist graves constructed with four slabs and covered with a fifth slab. One of these contained a ceramic juglet. On the surface of the LH I room in trench LE795, the intramural burial of an infant was found interred with a small cup. To the SW of this room, two more burials had been placed on a hard clay surface. An intrusive infant burial was found in trench LG789 between two walls ofLH II date. Atalanti. A new guide to the museum has been published: AccKopc?vicc, O., Apxaio?oyiK? Mouoe?o ATa?avTq? (Athens, T.A.P.A. 2006). Kalapodi. W.-D. Niemeier (Director, DAI Athens) reports on the third (2006) campaign of the new excavations at the sanctuary of Kalapodi (see AR 51 [2004-2005], 55-56; AR 52 [2005-2006], 68-69) which he now identifies as the Sanctuary of Apollon of Abai, and not, as previously suggested, the sanctuary of Artemis Elaphebolos at Hyampolis. For the high to LAr, excavations have brought to light the N and W parts of the still missing and extensively burnt stylobate of the S temple which was built around 570/560 BC and destroyed by the Persians in 480 BC. The columns in this case were also made of wood, as can be inferred from the wedge-shaped indentations for their upright placement (see R. Felsch, Jdl \\6 [2001], 9-10, figs 5-6). Only the columns of the E side and the first column of the N (possibly also that of the S) long side of the colonnade were made of stone. The Ar S temple is thus of great architectural-historical interest. In terms of typology, it stands between temples with wooden colonnades, which existed until the 1st quarter of the 6th Ct BC, and the fully-fledged stone temples of the M6th Ct BC onwards. In the W part of the temple, to our surprise, we came across another, this time narrower, ramp, which lies directly opposite the one situated exactly on the middle axis of the temple on the E side. The Persian destruction layer, which we were able to investigate in 2004 and 2005 between columns 5 and 9 in the area of the N pteron (AR 51 [2004-2005], 55-56; AR 52 [2005 2006], 68), had been destroyed by a Rom pit in the area of column 9, but survived further to the W, in the N half of the W pronaos. Underneath collapsed roof tiles, charred wooden beams of the roof and burnt mud-bricks, the iron fittings of another four chariot wheels, including bosses for mounting the spokes and partly twisted rim segments, were discovered (Fig. 49). The 49. Kalapodi: LAr chariot wheels outside temple</page><page sequence="42">42 JAMES WHITLEY ETAL. remains of two wheels lay close to the spot where once stood the NW corner column, whereas those of another wheel were discovered on the spot of the first W column to the N. This suggests that the wheels -just as the ones discovered in 2004 in the area of the N pteron (AR 51 [2004-2005], 56, fig. 98) - were suspended on the columns as votives. The fourth wheel lay in the middle of the W antechamber. The open-air provisional sanctuary, established on the levelled mud-brick collapse of the LGeo-EAr temple's last phase, which was discovered in 2005 under the High Ar S temple (see AR 52 [2005-2006], 68), was completely revealed in this year's campaign. In the course of the works, further votives were recovered, amongst others an iron spearhead. The limestone Doric capital with burn marks, that had been re-used in the provisional sanctuary as an altar, was removed and inves tigated by architect N. Hellner. The capital is an exceptionally interesting discovery since it constitutes one of the oldest known Doric capitals in Greece and the only one of those which was recovered from a well-dated stratigraphie context. It was relocated to the temporary sanctuary immediately after the destruction of the LGeo-EAr S temple by earthquake, datable to between 595/590 and 570 BC on the basis of MCor pottery, and therefore must antedate this destruction. A noteworthy feature of the capital is the downward reduction of the column shaft at an angle of 2.5 degrees, an element that up to now is known only by two E Doric capitals from the Argive Heraion. Just as these two examples, our capital stands in the tradition of M Myc architecture, for which columns reduced downwards were characteristic. For the EAr, in the area below the provisional sanctuary, excavation revealed further the burnt floor of the third and last phase of the LGeo-EAr S temple. This led to the observation that the Doric capital, the altar of the provisional sanctuary, was placed exactly over a round plastered pit, which had been sunk in the ground and the position of which must have been known to the builders despite the fill of collapsed mud-bricks. Metal votive offerings recovered from the floor include mainly bronze rings, but also a bronze phiale which was presumably used in sacrificial practice. During our 2004 excavation in the area of the E end of the S temple, which had been cut through by the Rom temple, we encountered a sequence of three floor surfaces belonging to the LGeo-EAr temple (AR 51 [2004-2005], 56), and therefore we expected soon to discover yet another one under the uppermost floor in the area excavated further to the W. Instead, we came across a large eschara that contained a massive deposit of ashes; approximately 380 litres have been excavated and wet-sieved to date. Apparently, the eschara took up almost the entire width of the temple. Until now, a floor of the second phase has been encountered only close to the wall of the N long side. An iron obelos which was discovered on this floor provides, along with the recovered animal bones and ashes, evidence for the performance of ritual meals in the temple. With the destruction of the temple's second phase, as in the case of the third phase, probably through an earthquake, the S mud-brick wall, which was plastered on the inside, collapsed into the eschara. An unexpected and enormously exciting discovery lay in the fact that at least some of these plaster fragments were painted (see also Ethnos 26/08/2006), In particular, we were able to recover parts of a wall-painting with a battle scene: the largest fragment (Fig. 50) shows part of a helmet with its plumed crest and behind it two raised arms, the hands of which carry spears. One of the arms belongs to the warrior with the helmet, the other to another warrior standing behind him. We are here faced with the section of a phalanx, as depicted on a frieze from the near-contemporary ProtoCor Chigi vase, datable to about 640 BC (Boardman, J., Early Greek Vase Painting [1998], 95, fig. 178.2). As in the latter case, the wall-painting also included an opposing phalanx, from which the helmet with its plumed crest and one spear-holding hand of a warrior in the opposite direction could be identified. During 2006, only a small part of the find context of these wall-painting fragments could be excavated and, therefore, it is hoped that in 2007 we will be able to recover more fragments of the mural composition. The importance of these fragments for the history of Gr wall painting, which after the Myc period fell into oblivion and was apparently revived from the M7th Ct BC, can hardly be overstated. The only evidence for its existence was furnished until now by the poorly preserved (and thus difficult to understand) fresco fragments from the Ar temple of Poseidon at Isthmia (Broneer, O., isthmia I [1971], 33-34, pi. A-C). The Kalapodi fragments are an important addition to the available evidence and provide proof for the influence of free painting on vase painting, as argued by H. Payne (Necrocorinthia [1931], 94-97), M. Robertson (Greekpainting [1959], 43-47) and G.R Schaus (JHS 108 [1988], 107-17). For the Geo and ProtoGeo, at the NE corner of the Ar S temple, to the N of the Rom temple's N wall, works began to extend the excavation up to the section investigated during the older campaigns slightly further to the E (see AA [1987], plan p. 5, fig. 3, K 25-26, p. 6, fig. 4). In the course of these works, a levelling layer under the burnt exterior floor surface of the LGeo-EAr temple yielded pottery sherds of the Geo and ProtoGeo periods. For the LH IIIC, underneath the levelling layer mentioned above, excavation in the last days of the campaign reached the uppermost Myc horizon. This produced sherds of several pictorial LH IIIC-M kraters with warrior and combat scenes (Fig. 51). Another krater fragment shows a pair holding hands in a ritual dance. Fragments of other vessels, such as deep bowls and cups from the same layer, were associated with ritual meals in the sanctuary. An index of cult activity is provided by the fragments of terracotta bull figurines with wheel-turned bodies. Similar artefacts had been discovered already during the older excavations slightly further to the E (Felsch, R., in Sanctuaries and Cults in the Aegean Bronze Age [ 1981 ], 87, 89, fig. 22). The krater fragments demonstrate connections to a language of self-representation by means of such prestige vessels, which was common to both sides of the Euboean gulf and which the aristocratic ?lites that rose to power after the collapse of the palaces, invoking the heritage of the old palatial rulers, used to articulate their status (see Crielaard, J.P., in Ancient Greece. From the Mycenaean Palaces to the Age of Homer [2006], 282-84, fig. 14.4). In the 12th Ct BC the sanctuary at Kalapodi was thus apparently a place where 50.

Kalapodi: fragment of LH IIIC-M krater members of this ?lite met for communal ritual meals and sacrifices. These krater fragments, finally, enable the warfare symbolism of the Geo and Ar periods, as manifested through, amongst others, the numerous votive weapons and the wall painting of the 7th Ct BC, to be traced back to the LMyc period. LH 1IIA2-B. The view expressed by the previous excavators that the sanctuary at Kalapodi was established only after the collapse of the Myc residences in the 12th Ct BC has been shared by numerous authors. F. de Polignac (in Placing the Gods [1994], 9) saw in its foundation in the LH IIIC, 'only one of the many signs of the changes which affected social and religious life at the time', while R. Felsch (in Potnia. Deities and Religion in the Aegean Bronze Age [2001], 197? 98) even regarded it as possible that the sanctuary was founded by newly arrived populations in Phokis and therefore should not, in strict terms, be counted among Myc cult places. In a deep sounding begun in 2005 at the E part of the S temple, which had been cut through by the W foundation of the Rom temple (AR 52 [2005-2006], 68-69), a levelling layer under the LH IIIC horizon yielded fragments of LH IIIA2 and LH IIIB pottery, mainly kylikes and deep bowls, as well as the fragment of a LH IIIA2 Ladder Type terracotta animal figurine (French, E.B., BSA 66 [1971], 157-58), faience beads and a small cone of steatite. These discoveries confirm our previous suspicions (AR 51 [2004-2005], 56) that the sanctuary is older than the 12th Ct BC. The sanctuary may in fact reach as far back as the MH period. The deepest levels of this levelling layer produced grey Minyan pottery fragments as well as, surprisingly, a M seal of the Old Palace period, a four-sided prism made of green serpentine like those of the MM IB?II so-called Mallia workshop complex (Fig. 52; see Yule, P., Early Cretan Seals: A Study of Chronology [1980], 65, 143-44, 212-13). Whether the sanctuary actually began to function in the MH period will be established by the results of the forthcoming campaigns. Should this prove to be the case, it will be of great importance since our knowledge about sanctuaries and cult in the MH period has, until now, been extremely limited. Similarly, there can be no clear answer at present as to whether the M seal was dedicated at Kalapodi as an heirloom in the Myc period or already by the MBA. Fragments of Kamares pottery discovered at Volos, at Pevkakia Magoula near Volos (see Rutter, J.B., C. Zerner, in The Minoan Thalassocracy: Myth and Reality [1984], 82, nos 6, 9) and in 2006, very close to Kalapodi, at the port settlement Mitrou in Opountian Lokris (Van de Moortel, A., pers. comm.) suggest the existence of a M maritime trade route of the Old Palace period between Euboea and the middle Gr mainland to Thessaly (see Niemeier, W.-D., in Traffici micenei nel Mediterr?neo [1986], 246-47, figs 3-4). The seal could have arrived at Kalapodi in these times through one such port site, either Mitrou or Livanates (Kynos). Maliakos Gulf, Ayios Konstantinos. Ta Nea, Eleftherotypia, Kathimerini and Ethnos (15/03/2007) report on the discovery of a building interpreted as an anc, hostelry at Ayios Konstantinos, Isiomata. The building, measuring 30m by 15m, had at least three rooms and was in use from LCI (4th Ct BC) until Rom times. Many finds seem to be associated with one room interpreted as an andron. These include drinking and other sympotic vessels, one marked HI[APON, others marked with the name of the dedicator. The building is therefore thought to belong a sanctuary in the vicinity, probably associated with anc. Daphnous. THESSALY with NORTHERN SPORADES Nomos of Magnesia (13th EPCA; 7th EBA) Mount Pelion. Niels H. Andreasen (Danish Institute) and A. Darlas (EPS) report on the first (2006) season of the Pelion cave project. The overall aim is to explore the uses of space in and around caves and to identify and explain changes and continuity in the human activities at caves in the Emod. (L historical period) and mod. periods on mount Pelion in Magnesia, E Thessaly. A subsidiary goal is to establish a testable correspondence between cave use in the recent past and its archaeological consequences. This, in turn, will help archaeologists understand better pastoral behaviour and other activities in caves and their material correlates and thus to contribute to a better understanding of site-formation processes in the past. Identification of site function and use is pursued within an interdisciplinary framework using historic, archaeological and ethno-historic sources. We combine collecting of artefacts from the cave floors and the recording of surviving upstanding architectural structures in and around the caves with inter viewing local cave-users in the interpretation of single caves and regional patterns within the project area. Work in 2006 was focused at three geographical regions on mount Pelion: the Aegean or NE side of the mountain (munici pality of Mouresiou); a wider area SW on the mountain, E of Volos (municipalities of Artemidos, Makrinitsa and Volos); and 0 _ _ 2cm 52. Kalapodi: M seal of the Old Palace Period</page><page sequence="44">44 JAMES WHITLEY ET AL. the Pilion foothills around lake Karla (municipality of Karla). The main objective of the field season was a preliminary study and definition of the main types of cave-sites and environ mental zones on mount Pelion. During the three weeks of fieldwork, 56 visited caves and rockshelters were documented by basic measurements and photographs. Location of the caves was established by hand held GPS. Field interviews with local informants not only led to the discovery of new caves but also provided detailed information on husbandry practices and local history related to cave use. The tree cover on most of the mountain severely limits exposure and visibility and assistance from local guides is essential to locating new caves. Portable artefacts encountered on the cave floors were collected regardless of their age. This strategy resulted in 382 individual artefacts and faunal remains from thirteen caves, representing a wide range of artefact types from different periods including PH, Rom and Byz ceramics, and a broad range of mod. material residues. 70.2% of the finds are ceramics or roof tile fragments and 14.1% are bones (human and animal). 15.7% of finds are of other materials (plastic, iron, glass). In one rocksheiter at Goritsa E of Volos, we mapped in detail all domestic debris left there recently by local goat/sheep herders. These included mainly personal effects (e.g., clothing, shoes, duvets) and effects related to leisure activities (smoking, consuming snacks, listening to music). We encountered figure carvings in four caves and rockshel ters. We believe all of these to date to the historical or mod. periods. In two cases there were drawings associated with Ch symbolism as they depicted angels with outspread wings and a four-armed cross. We noted at least thirteen different types of use (past and present) of caves and rockshelters on the mountain and its foothills. Identification of use was reached as a result of collection of artefacts from the cave floors, observation of architectural remains and oral testimonies from local informants. At a single cave, we documented multi-functional use in mod. time (habitation, resting place, shooting covert and goat-pen). The survey on Pelion presents a unique opportunity to address a number of key questions of both anthropological and historical interest through archaeological means. The complete lack of artefacts on the floors is a character istic of many caves in the research area. While people probably used these caves at different periods, the absence of visible material remains may be connected with short stays combined with no or few activities leaving artefacts on the surface. But natural processes can be responsible too, since strong and rapid build-up of goat pellets and dung cakes make artefacts invisible. What we observed in some caves was a sort of horizontal stratigraphy in which different activities in mod. times have produced their own particular patterns of material remains within the confines of the caves. The detailed plotting of artefacts at the Goritsa rocksheiter revealed significant spatial patterning, which indicates that even small shelters may display some degree of partitioning of space. Rather than spatial size and shape being a determinant for the function of caves and rockshelters, the most important reason whether they are used or not and how they are used seems to lie in their relationship to villages, fields and grazing grounds and therefore their position in the cultural landscape. As an aside, we learned that most cave names refer to specific local events, local topographies, or physical character istics, vegetation, or to their specific use. More rarely are names connected to local/general mythology. Caves that are only used by one or very few people usually do not have names. Only caves that function as a point of reference for several users or a community usually have names. The Persian War Shipwreck Survey (PWSS). Shelley Wachsmann (Institute of Nautical Archaeology at Texas A&amp;M University) reports on the Persian War Shipwreck Survey, a collaborative project of the Canadian Institute in Greece (CIG), the Greek Ephorate of Maritime Antiquities (EMA), directed by Katerina Dellaporta, and the Hellenic Centre for Marine Research (HCMR), directed by George Chronis. The project aims to locate, map and record shipwrecks, their cargoes and related artefacts in areas where historical sources indicate that large fleets sank due to weather or battles during the Persian War. HCMR's research vessel, the 62m R/V Aegaeo served as the base of operations and the team used the ship's deep-water equipment (sidescan sonar, bottom profiler, Thetis submersible and remote operated vehicles [ROVs]) in the survey. The fourth (2006) cruise examined the Magnesian coast and the S side of the Artemision channel. Along the Magnesian coast the expedition collected sidescan sonar targets and acoustic profile data. Our scans covered a linear distance of over 200km and we examined some 75 sidescan anomalies, while we employed the submersible to survey regions closer to shore and around rocky headlands. This survey may have contributed to our understanding of the geography related to the location Herodotus (VII, 179-92) gives for the losses to the Persian fleet off the coast of Magnesia. We visually inspected the coast from mod. cape Sepias N to the plain that divides the massif of mount Pelion from that of mount Ossa. In this area we searched for remains of Xerxes' ships destroyed by a nor'easter that lasted three days while the fleet anchored between its base at Therma (mod. Thessaloniki) and its stations at Aphetae, opposite the Gr fleet arrayed at Aretemision. One of the challenges in searching for these ships is determining the precise location of the beach where they had anchored when the storm hit. According to Herodotus, the beach was located, 'between Kasthanaia and cape Sepias' and was too small to pull all the ships ashore, causing the fleet to anchor, 'eight-deep'. He reports some 400 warcraft lost to the storm along with numerous support vessels, and notes that the wreckage scattered to sites that included the Ipnoi ('Ovens') near mount Pelion, as well as Sepias, Miliboa and Kasthanaia. Gr lookouts on Euboea witnessed the conse quences of the storm on the Persian fleet. Mod. nautical charts identify cape Sepias as the headland at Magnesia's SE tip. If this is correct, it implies that the short stretches of beach immediately to the N should be where the disaster occurred. Pritchett and other scholars have expressed doubts about this identification, however. They note that mod. cape Sepias lies close to the beaches at Aphetai; the Persians' intended destination and a coastline protected from NE winds. It seemed unlikely that the Persians would have preferred to stop just short of their goal on an unsuitable beach. Although it appears that no researcher surveyed the entire Magnesian coast from the sea to establish the location of all possible beaches, some spectacular caves near the coast's N end convinced Pritchett and others to identify them with the 'Ovens'. The editors of the Barrington Atlas of Classical Antiquity agree with this identification, and follow the revi sionists in identifying a nearby site as 'Kasthanaia' and an apparent promontory to the S as 'Sepias'. Our survey revealed many caves at the water's edge. Additionally, a few miles N of Pritchett's proposed site for the narrow beach where the disaster occurred we noted a</page><page sequence="45">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2006-2007 45 spectacular beach, over 9km long, that could have easily accommodated the entire Persian fleet. Furthermore, it seems unlikely that the Gr lookouts would have known of the disaster if it occurred so far N. Nevertheless, we did conduct sidescan sonar and ROV searches in this area, encountering here (as elsewhere on the Magnesian coast) a heavily-sedimented bottom with no visible remains. We agree with the localization of cape Sepias on mod. nautical charts, which place it at the SE headland of Magnesia and believe that the beach at Agios Ioannes may conform best to the geographical considerations given by Herodotus. We hoped that the survey of the S side of the Artemision channel would not have to contend with deep sediments as this area has yielded some of the most spectacular antiquities recovered from the sea. In the 1920s the famous Artemision bronze statues of the striding god (Zeus or Poseidon), the racehorse and the jockey came from a shipwreck site about 500m offshore from Pevki bay, the anc. station of the Gr war fleet at Artemision in August 480 BC. These statues, dating from the 5th Ct BC and the Hel period respectively appear to have been part of the cargo of a ship that sank during the Hel or Rom periods. It seemed reasonable, therefore, to anticipate that other antiquities might lie exposed on the seafloor in this area. Neither sidescan nor ROV searches revealed any anc. remains here in 2006, however. Perhaps currents running through the channel scour the seafloor in unpredictable ways here. One Thetis dive discovered a cluster of some 20 amphorae at the SE end of the Artemision channel, strongly suggesting the presence of a shipwreck there (Fig. 53). EMA archaeolo gists recovered one amphora for cleaning and further study. Although the amphora was heavily encrusted with marine growth, precluding identification, the amphora may be dated to the Cl or Hel period. 53. Persian War Shipwreck Survey: Cl/Hel amphora 54. Alonissos, Peristera: amphorae from a shipwreck The 2006 fieldwork season concludes the Persian War Shipwreck Survey. In previous years we surveyed the coastlines of the Athos peninsula, the N shores (Magnesia) of the Artemision channel and the SE coast of Euboea, which is generally identified with the 'Hollows of Euboea'. Thus, the survey has examined, albeit small, portions of all the locations at which Herodotus places fleet losses, with the notable exception of Salamis. Unfortunately, the Salaminian channel is unavailable for research as it has served as Athens' sewage dumping ground for decades and because it remains a particu larly active waterway.

A. Dellaporta (EMA) reports (ADelt, 1020-22) on the 1999 season of this underwater survey, conducted in collaboration with M. Wedde and M.

Finds include 50 amphorae dating to around 450 BC. The second known shipwreck investigated was at Agio Petro off the coast of Peristera (off Alonissos, see above), first investigated by Throckmorton. Thirty five M Byz amphorae dating to ca 1050 AD were recovered. Nearby, at a distance ca 1.8m from another known Cl shipwreck earlier investigated by E. Hatzidaki (see ADelt B Chron 48 [1993], 586 and above), sonar detected a mass of Byz amphorae, from a later shipwreck, and 1.7m further away another mass of MByz amphorae dating to the 12th Ct AD, from a further shipwreck.

Nomos of Larisa (15th EPCA; 7th EBA) Kallithea (anc. Peuma). Athanasios Tziafalias (15th EPCA), Sophia Karapanou, Margriet J. Haagsma (Canadian Institute/University of Alberta) and Sean Gouglas report on the 2006 season of intensive survey at the Kastro (see AR 52 [2005-2006], 76-78). The focus of the archaeological survey this year was on the W part of the city, 'outside' the diateichismata and the team surveyed this area using the unit system laid out over the site. A total 239 units have now been surveyed. This year, a total of 12,685 sherds were counted in 114 units. The diagnostic artefacts dated mostly to the LCl-EHel periods. In some units no artefacts were found at all due to the fact that these units consisted entirely of bedrock. On the other hand, some areas, especially the one just above the W city gate, proved to be even more densely covered with pottery than the habitation area on the E part of the site surveyed in 2005. In some units 300-600 pieces of pottery were counted, especially in steep locations with so-called 'wash-outs', where part of the wall foundations had disintegrated due to rainwater. The character of the artefacts found this year indicated that certain areas in the W part of the site were intensively in use as habitation areas and religious, defensive and/or workshop areas. Diagnostic artefacts consisted mostly of 4th and 3th Ct pottery, some of which have close parallels to local vessels found in ritual contexts elsewhere in Thessaly. This year, the architectural survey focused on two structures: one located in the E part of the site (building 10), in the housing block area and one building in the W area of the city (building 11). Building 10 was already noted and cleared by the Gr team during the season of 2005, because of its well preserved architectural foundations which were clearly visible at the surface. The location of building 10 and its situation in a housing block suggested a domestic function. In the course of this season it became clear that the building was indeed a house. The building had been partially looted in the recent past, suggested by two small pits measuring ca 0.5m w. and 0.3m d. Fragments of a large pithos were lying about in the N section of the building, together with a flat stone which probably functioned as a pithos lid. The team cleared the visible architectural remains of excess soil and revealed several courses of internal wall foundations and possible doorways. The excavation team excavated a test pit in room 2. The building is large: it measures 19.45m by 14.60m and consists of at least seven separate rooms or areas. The exact spot of the main entrance of the house is still unknown, but since the house is located at the SE corner of a housing block, the entrance should be located either at the S (entering from the avenue) or at the W (entering from the street). The courtyard is represented by a large area facing the S. In the SW part of the house is a room which might have functioned as an entrance hallway giving access to the courtyard. N of the courtyard two small rooms are situated and one more room is located in the NE corner of the building. This last room protrudes S into the courtyard, thus creating a space between the courtyard and the two small N rooms, which could be interpreted as apastas. Building 11 was also cleared by the Gr team in 2005 and continued to be studied during the 2006 season. The building is a large rectangular structure, consisting of three separate areas and no clear boundary towards the S. It faces one of the main avenues of the site. Clearing the building revealed roof tiles, indicating that the structure was originally covered. No other finds were found at all, which is interesting considering the range of artefacts revealed at this part of the site. The function of the building is as yet unknown, but it is clear from the ground plan and the lack of household items that it did not have a domestic purpose. The GIS team worked in two groups employing two total stations. One team concentrated their efforts on the W part of the site and was able to shoot in all walls W of the diateichis mata, while the second team laid out the unit system in that part of the site. It became clear that, in contrast to the housing blocks area that formed the E part of the site, the W section of our city was far less densely covered with architecture. Yet, preliminary study of the orientation of foundations, streets and walls shows that most of the architectural remains line up with the street and avenue system E of the diateichismata and that most of the site, except for the acropolis, was divided up in (housing) lots measuring 45m by 39m, with streets and avenues measuring 3.70m and 5.80m w. on average. The only building in the W section which did not line up with the city plan is located just N of the W city gate. It looked very similar to the building that we identified in 2005 as a potential guardhouse situated just above the E city gate in the E section of the city, and it is very possible that both buildings served as watch posts guarding the roads up to the two gates. The team excavated trial trenches (lm by lm) on the acropolis (acropolis building 1), the agora (buildings 2 and 4) and in the E area of the site (buildings 8 and 10). The stratig raphy in buildings 2 and 4 was pretty straightforward and suggested a short-term occupation which ended with (a) sudden event(s), based on a condensed pack of roof tiles on top of crushed pottery in both buildings and extensive traces of fire below the roof tile level in building 2. Diagnostic finds consisted of a coin (Larissa) dated to the L4th Ct BC, a bronze arrowhead and domestic pottery. Results from the test trench excavated on the acropolis does not support our earlier conclusions that the acropolis was dated much earlier (EC1) than the rest of the planned city. However, this conclusion can only be definitive after the trial trench adjacent to the acropolis fortification wall has been excavated, which is planned for next summer. Finds in the upper stratum suggested that the acropolis was re-occupied during the EByz period. The earliest finds in this trench dated to the 4th Ct BC. The domestic buildings 8 and 10 had a more complicated stratigraphy and seem to have been abandoned at a later stage (L3rd Ct BC) than the buildings in the area of the agora. Some of the walls of building 10 were covered with plaster painted in white and bright yellow. Nomos of Trikala (15th EPCA; 7th EBA) Kalambaka, Theopetra cave. N. Kyparissi-Apostolika (EPS) reports (ADelt, 1002-03) on further excavation (see AR 50 [2003-2004], 41) within this cave, which has strata indicating human activity from the MPal to the Neo. Excavation took place within four areas. In trench Z10, the MPal deposits were taken down a further 4.8m. Finds include numerous flint and quartz tools and burnt areas (possible hearths) with burnt tools. The stratigraphy from the neighbouring trench Z8 suggests these date to soon after 48,000 BP. In trench 011 the MPal levels were taken down a further 2.8m from the point reached in 1995, stopping at an extensive burnt horizon, estimated to date to 46,000 BP. Finds include flint and quartz tools and burnt areas, which have been sampled for radiocarbon dating. In trench 111 Upper Pal strata dating to between 25,000 and 12,000 BP were excavated.</page><page sequence="47">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2006-2007 47 The most significant discoveries were in trench TlO, where Upper Pal and Mes levels span the last Glacial period and the beginning of the Holocene (12,000-6,700 BC). Finds were mainly flint tools. Of particular interest are the undecorated, plain potsherds and lumps of unburnt clay found in the Mes strata (see Kyparissi-Apostolika, N., 'The Mesolithic in Theopetra cave: new data on a debated period in Greek prehistory' in N. Galanidou and C. Perl?s (eds), The Greek Mesolithic: Problems and Perspectives [BSA Studies 10, London 2003], 189-98). These seem to antedate the earliest Neo in Greece, and suggest that pottery production of some kind was an indigenous innovation of the Gr Mes, and was not introduced as part of a Neo 'package' from the Near East. These sherds have been sent for thermolumines cence dating. EPIROS Nomos of Thesprotia (once 7th, now 32nd EPCA; 8th EBA) Thesprotia Expedition. B. Fors?n (Finnish Institute at Athens) reports on the 2006 season. The third consecutive field season of the Thesprotia Expedition consisted of intensive field survey, a geological survey, geophysical prospection, topographical mapping, as well as trial excavations at two sites. So far we have searched intensively close to 3kitf and documented 35 places of special interest, most of which constitute archaeological sites. The work in 2006 expanded our knowledge of the diachronic settlement history of the valley. The new sites recorded include another EBA to MBA site (PS 28), two LCI to EHel farmsteads (PS 29, PS 35), a LRom farmstead (PS 32) and two find concentrations (PS 31 and PS 36) dating to the EIA through Cl period. The geological survey of the Kokytos river valley continued in the same way as in 2004-2005, i.e., by collecting soil and rock samples. A special emphasis was put on studying the surroundings of PS 36 and PS 31, which are located in an area called Mavromantilia on the valley bottom next to the Kokytos river. With the help of a hand auger the extent of the sites was pursued. The results indicate that both our find concentrations, together with a third find place discovered in 2005 and explored by the 32nd Ephorate, all belong to one and the same EIA site, part of which is covered with as much as 1 1.5m of alluvium. The geophysical prospection, conducted by Tatyana Smekalova, revealed several house foundations next to a ECh basilica, around which we had collected LRom pottery (PS 27) in 2005. It now seems fairly certain that there existed a village next to the basilica. This is an interesting result as it differs from the common settlement pattern during this period, which usually is characterized by isolated farmsteads/villas. The topographical team this year concentrated on mapping the small (0.5ha) fortress Kioteza, which prior to our arrival had been partially cleaned by the 32nd EPCA. The walls, which can be dated to the 4th or 3rd Ct BC, are in a very bad stage of preservation. However, we identified a square tower and possibly also a gate, both on the E side where the fortress is connected by means of a small saddle to the Paramythia mountain range. In 2006 the Thesprotia Expedition proceeded to the second stage of the project, which includes trial excavations in places of special interest. Trial trenches were opened at the fortified hill Agios Donatos of Zervochori (PS 25) and one of our EIA find concentrations (PS 36). In PS 36 we found remains of fire places and/or shallow bothroi (rubbish pits) consisting of dark soil mixed with charcoal, ash, animal bones and large amounts of broken pottery (Fig. 55). The features can, on the basis of C14 analyses, be dated to between ca 1100 and 700 BC. Part of the pottery, dating to the 9th and 8th Cts BC, was well preserved. We also found daub, or clay lining, which indicates the existence of huts in the near vicinity, built in the wattle and daub technique. A preliminary study of the pottery sequence of the site shows that it continued in use as late as until the 4th Ct BC. Cor roof tiles indicate that there must have existed more durable houses somewhere at the site during the Cl period. On Agios Donatos of Zervochori we excavated two trial trenches, the first one at a gate identified during the 2005 season and the second one in the only tower belonging to the fortification. The fortification walls can be dated on stylistic grounds to the very end of the 4th Ct or the 1st half of the 3rd Ct BC. However, as the surface finds mainly dated to the 1st and 2nd Cts AD, the aim of our trial trenches was to gain a better understanding of this final phase of usage as well as to find earlier layers belonging to the construction of the fortifi cation itself. The excavations on Agios Donatos revealed that the ERom re-use of the site had been very extensive. We did not manage to find any earlier stratified layers. Scattered finds dating to the earlier periods, such as a Korkyrean coin dating to the 4th Ct BC and a lamp dating to 325-250 BC, seem to support the date of construction of the fortification to around 300 BC, which is the general period of urbanization in Thesprotia. However, most of the finds from Agios Donatos date to the ERom period. Apart from bronze objects, large amounts of glass and coarse ware, as well as Italian terra sigillata pottery was found. A total of six planta pedis stamps give the names of some of the workshops in Arretium producing the pottery. The workshop of Lucius Avillius is represented by several stamps, but also by characteristic applied decoration motifs, such as a dolphin, a Cupid playing aulos (Fig. 56), and Eros and a bow. The stamps and the rich pottery indicate that the settlement had close contacts to central Italy during the 1st half 55. Thesprotia Expedition: EIA kanthariskos</page><page sequence="48">48 JAMES WHITLEY ET AL. 56. Thesprotia Expedition: terra sigillata fragment of the 1st Ct AD. Apart from the ERom pottery, a handful of probably LRom sherds were documented, but on the basis of the information available today the site does not seem to have been intensively settled after the E2nd Ct AD. WESTERN MACEDONIA Nomos of Florina (once 17th, now 29th EPCA; 11th EBA) Anc. Fiorina. M. Lilmbaki-Akamati and I. Akamatis (AEMTH 19 [2005], 569-77) report on conservation and restoration works conducted in the Hel city, which has been open to the public since June 2006, as reported in To Vima (26/06/2006) and Apogevmatini (29/06/2006). Agios Panteleimonas, Anargyroi Amyntaiou and Vegoras Filota. P. Chrysostomou, in Kathimerini, To Vima (01/03/2007), Navtemporiki, Imerisia, Apogevmatini (05/03/2007) and Ethnos (18/03/2007) discusses the PH finds in the region of the four lakes (Vegoritida, Chimaditida, Zazaris and Petron), where excavation research and survey located 51 sites. In Vegoras an ENeo site was located. In Aghios Panteleimonas 1 two trial trenches unearthed part of a post-framed house and another square house. In Anargyroi three successive ellipsoid ditches were revealed, as well as the wooden floor of a post-framed house, covering an area of 5m2. On the floor a mortar, stone tools and a female figurine were found in situ, all dated to the LNeo period. In addition, six MNeo burials of adults and infants in a crouched position were found. Portable finds include clay figurines (53 of the MNeo and 25 of the LNeo period, presenting humans and animals), jewellery (noteworthy a gold pendant), tools and pottery, along with a wealth of charred archaeobotanical remains (wheat, lentils, peas, pomegranate pips, raspberry and elderberry). In Aghos Panteleimonas-Pateli, research in twelve tumuli revealed 358 cist graves in circular and radial arrangement, dated to 950-550 BC. Grave goods included metal and clay vessels (460 in number, with matt painted or incised decoration, deriving mainly from local workshops,) jewels and cloth implements (with evidence of their position on the deceased females), iron and bronze weapons and tools. Agios Vartholomaios. Ch, Ziota (ADelt, 640-41) notes the excavation of a LRom-ECh settlement. The scant architectural remains include a clay floor with traces of fire, while the portable finds include everyday pottery, loomweights, iron tools and coins. Mikri Prespa-Agios Achileios Island. E. Psarra (ADelt, 641 ? 44) reports on both the survey which aims to locate remains of the historical periods and the excavation in the Hel settlement, in the W part of the island. In trench I remains of ECh graves were revealed. In trench II deposits with dense traces of fire were found. In the NE corner a concentration of stones and tiles covered three incensories preserving charcoal residues, along with a fish plate and a coarse vessel that was also used as incensory. Furthermore, a hoard of seven bronze coins was discovered, all of the 'Macedonian Commonwealth', dated to the 2nd Ct AD, as well as parts of at least two silver sheets, probably offerings to a deity. One depicts a pair of eyes, the second a temple with a figure. The remains possibly belong to a sanctuary. Prespes, church of Agios Germanos. K.

Karamitrou-Mendesidi (AEMTH 19 [2005], 495 509) presents the new thematic exhibition in the Archaeological Museum, dedicated to public and private life in anc. times. In the E cemetery fifteen pit graves were investigated, already looted in anc. times. Apart from two cremations, all the other graves contained inhumations on wooden klines, accompanied by clay vessels (skyphidia, lamps, kantharos, kalyx and local hydriae, prochoi and kantharos), bronze vessels, iron strigils, arrowheads, spearheads and knives. Leivadia. G. Karamitrou-Mendesidi (ADelt, 617-19) reports on the excavation of a LBA double oblong structure (/. 18.50m, w. 5-8m). Two stratigraphie layers were distin guished. The first includes two cremations in cists constructed with stone slabs, yielding handmade matt painted pottery and wheelmade Myc pottery (kantharoi, kyathoi, prochoi, four handled amphorae, Myc skyphoi and alabastra, Fig. 57). To the 57. Leivadia: Myc pottery</page><page sequence="49">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2006-2007 49 second layer belong two pit graves dated to LNeo-EBA. The first contained an inhumation in crouched position without any offerings, while the second was accompanied by a two-handled matt painted vessel, a Myc alabastron, a bronze spearhead and amber beads. Trial trenches in the wider area confirm the existence of an extended LBA cemetery. Spelia Eordaias, Aghia Paraskevi. G. Karamitrou Mendesidi (AEMTH 19 [2005], 495-509) reports on the excavation of a vaulted single-spaced chamber tomb, hewn into the natural bedrock (see also AR 52 [2005-2006], 86). The chamber contained a table for offerings and four cremation burials in three pithoid-stamnoid vessels. The grave goods include 30 perfume vessels, nine fish plates, six 'Macedonian' amphorae, four lamps, two small skyphoi, a kantharos and a salt cellar, eight terracottas depicting female figures and Cupids, a bronze fibula, an iron strigil with a suspension loop, a gold lozenge stomion, 255 bone astragaloi, two glass, a clay and a faience bead, the remains of a wreath with bronze tubular pieces, gilded clay beads, gold laurel leaves and two bronze coins, one Neapolitan from S Italy (250-225 BC) and a second from Pella (187-161 BC), which date the burials to the 3rd and 2nd Cts BC. Polymylos. G. Karamitrou-Mendesidi (ADelt, 619-29) reports on the extended excavation in the settlement (see also AR 51 [2004-2005], 69). In the N sector, architectural remains dated to the BA were found. These include a stone foundation, part of a floor with destruction layer and four postholes. Two BA tumuli (Fig. 58) were investigated, each containing one pit grave and yielding as offerings a handmade kantharos (Fig. 59), glass, bronze and stone beads. An LIA-Ar pit grave was also investigated, accompanied by two bronze pins, a necklace with bronze beads, a clay spindle-whorl and three bronze sheets. The main settlement developed in the Hel period. Houses seem to have a central roofed area, around which develop rooms with stone foundations, hearths, storage areas with pithoi and pits and clay pipes for water supply, while a square room covered with hydraulic plaster is interpreted as a sanitation room. At the SE limit of the settlement, workshops are found with remarkably well-preserved square, circular and pear shaped pottery kilns (Fig. 60). There must also have been a workshop for processing stone objects, as evidenced by an unfinished stele and a statue (Fig. 61). The presence of these workshops suggests that stelae depicting Zeus Hypsistos and Athena (Fig. 62), a mounted hunter and several statue bases might be local products. Numerous slags and iron artefacts testify to the existence of a metal workshop. To the LHel period belong a building complex with a semi-open yard, a hearth altar and a surrounding stoa interpreted as a sanctuary. Finds from this complex include the above mentioned stele, marble lekanai, clay models of tables and a bone plaque depicting a female figure. The settlement was surrounded by three circuit walls. It was abandoned in Rom times when the inhabitants moved to the S and set up a new settlement (see below S sector). To the S of the PH tumuli 10 LHel pit graves and a jar burial were investigated. Burials yielded vessels ('Macedonian' amphora [Fig. 63], oinochoai, fish plates, relief skyphoi [Fig. 64], perfume and salt vessels, a relief krater and kantharos), jewellery (gold earrings with depictions of Nike [Fig. 65]), gilded quartz beads and coins (Phillip V, Perseus and Bottiaion). In the S sector, the 'newly established' settlement was excavated, with remains of buildings dating from the 1st Ct AD to the 4th Ct AD. An extended destruction layer with charred wood covered floors with structures, hearths and hand mills. Finds include large quantities of everyday pots, terra sigillata, glass vessels and loomweights. Numerous iron and lead slags indicate workshop activities. The settlement is identified as anc. Evia, where, according to Diodorous, the troops of Olympiada and Eurydike fought. ? *?Q&gt; 'W'F 1 %: i .,S?*^ 2 ..^ &gt;.?* * 4TA |^? ** ^'^?^&lt;\ M '"V *ft v3:&gt;^ C?58^ $&amp;&lt;* ?/?e ?.dB?- . &amp; w tf-y ^ "fe KA?paKO nOAYMYAOI BOPEiOI TOMEAX TYMBOI 1 : Tacp?? 12 2: Ta&lt;p?? 1.2.3.4 3: Ta?pn 1 4.Ta&lt;p?? 1,2 E: EAArjViaT?K??

Karamitrou-Mendesidi (ADelt, 629-32) reports on extensive excavation in this area. In sector A, exploration of the Neo and BA settlement was completed (see AR 51 [2004 2005], 69). In sector B there were further PH remains, among which were two burial periboloi containing pit graves with inhumations in the crouched position. The remains of the Sanctuary of Apollo, comprising three walls, were investigated. The ground plan of the building measures 3.50m by 7m. NE of the building an extended destruction layer was located. Large quantities of animal bones along with LHel and Rom pottery suggest that this area was the sanctuary's refuse dump. Finds, such as a bronze statuette of Dionysus (Fig. 66) and an inscription referring to Artemis, indicate that other deities were also worshiped here. In total, 3,500 coins were retrieved (seventeen silver), deriving mainly from N Greece (Pella, Thessaloniki, Epirus). The earliest coin is a silver half drachma from Aegina, dated to the 4th Ct BC. Sculpture finds include marble heads and legs, a stele depicting an ear and votive relieves with inscriptions. One votive relief is inscribed KAEONIKOI AAMT7POMAXOY / BEPOIAIOI AT70AAQNI NOMIQI, while another bears the words AMYNTAI ZABYTTIOY / ATTOAAQNI MEIIOPIIKQ/KATA ETTITArHN. In sector C a 3rd Ct AD cemetery was located. In total, sixteen pit graves, containing mostly cremations, and a dump pit were investigated. Grave goods include everyday clay vessels (oinochoai, ladles and kettles), bronze vessels, jewellery and various implements (bracelets, chains, buttons, belt fibulae), glass beads, iron objects (knives, scissors, spearheads) and coins. Mavrodendri. G. Karamitrou-Mentesidi (ADelt, 632-34) reports that at the site of Stasa the remains of a LNeo settlement covering 1,100m2 was investigated through trial trenches. Architectural features are rare and include daub with wood imprints, stone concentrations and a few postholes. Pottery is mainly coarse monochrome, while fine wares are represented by black topped, black, brown and red burnished vessels, sometimes decorated with incised ornaments. Two figurines were also collected, along with numerous ground, polished and chipped stone tools. The settlement is situated in the wider area of the Kitrini Limni basin, where occupation was dense in Neo times. Pontokomi. G. Karamitrou-Mendesidi (ADelt, 634-37) reports that on the site of Vrysi four buildings were investi gated. Building A had two rooms surrounded by a stoa, in one of which a cistern was found. Building B was itself a cistern, its sides covered with hydraulic plaster, its bottom with clay plaques; clay and iron pipes conducted the water. Next to it a clay pipe was unearthed for a /. of 45m. Building C was elongated (/. 13m), with two rooms. Pottery finds from this area include Neo sherds (with incised or painted 'red on cream' decoration, black burnished and black topped ware), LBA matt painted pottery, Ar, Cl and Hel wares. Noteworthy is an Ar Attic kylix of type C with inscribed name MAXATA (Fig. 67). To the remains of building D belong two parallel walls, W of which two pithoi and scattered tile fragments were located. Although the disturbed layers of the buildings make their dating difficult, a proposed date is lst-2nd Ct AD. In addition, two Ar pit graves were investigated, with a female burial accompanied by bronze bracelets and a hydria, and a male burial by a grey kantharos, an iron sword and a spearhead. Finally, eighteen LRom pit graves yielded clay vessels (oinochai, lagynoi, fish plates), coins, jewellery and an iron mattock. 66. Xerolimni: Hel bronze statuette of Dionysos 67.

Karamitrou-Mendesidi (AEMTH 19 [2005], 511-39) published a catalogue describing 27 archaeological sites in the area, which are going to be destroyed by the newly opened lignite mine. The sites were either located by surface survey or excavations. Eleven of them date to the PH period, the rest are Hel. Noteworthy are the surface finds of a Neo stone figurine from the Tetralofos Toumba and a LNeo gold ring-shaped pendant from Phyllotsairi (Fig. 68). The excavated sites include Kastro, where Hel houses were investigated, Argorema, where remains of houses and burials were dated by pottery to the 3rd-2nd Ct BC, Agios Markos, where workshop and storage areas were located, and Agios Markos Kastro, a hill with a fortified acropolis on top. These sites, along with some others located by surface survey, comprise the upper and the lower part of an Hel city (ADelt, 638-39). Excavation research, also reported in Eleftherotypia and Apogevmatini (26/03/2007), was conducted in the ENeo settlement of Phyllotsairi (also see AR 52 [2005-2006], 86). The site belongs to the settlement network of the Kitrini Limni basin. The settlement dates to the 7th Millennium BC, according to C14 dates. In the centre of the settlement, a dwelling with three successive phases was revealed. In its older phase the house was subterranean, in the second semi subterranean, while in its last phase it was built on the ground level. The size of the dwelling also changes through time from 25m2 to 100m2. In the last phase, the roof of the house was reinforced with posts, while an impressive limestone marl floor is preserved over an area of 15m2. On the floor a circular hearth and a stone mortar with a pestle were found in situ. By the end of this phase a pit was opened in the floor to bury two children. Both were found in a crouched position, accompanied by stone beads and charred seeds. In the W-NW area, parts of successive floors were located, along with rows of postholes and two limestone marl hearths or ovens. To the NE of the dwelling three burials in pits were uncovered. Two belong to adults (one accompanied by a large vessel) and one to a child. To the NW an ellipsoid pit (20m2) was located, in the interior of which was found a stone ellipsoid object probably used for processing seeds or tools. 68, Mavropigi, Phyllotsairi: LNeo gold ring-shaped pendant Seven further post-framed rectangular houses were inves tigated, six of them with complete ground plans. Their dimensions vary from 50irf to 90m". The houses were built in wattle and daub technique, along an N-S or NE-SW axis, with the entrance either on the S or E side. About 100 pits used for food preparation, storage and refuse were located both inside and outside the dwellings, while hearths were located in the interiors of some houses. In all, subsequent habitation phases were recognized. Two burials were revealed outside house 4. One of these belongs to a child accompanied by an assemblage of animal bones and stones, a stone figurine depicting a frog, a pierced piece of limestone, a stone axe, a bone tool and two large flint blades. In total fifteen burials were investigated, all but one in the crouched position. Pottery is mainly coarse monochrome, occasionally red, brown-red or black polished or burnished. Decorated fine wares include painted vessels (red-on-cream or white-on-brown or red surface), impressed wares with fingernail and barbotine decoration, as well as incised wares with a variety of motifs. Shapes are typical of the ENeo period: hemispherical and open phialae, deep bowls, often with pierced lugs, and flat, ring or concave bases. Noteworthy are the anthropomorphic vessels. Other finds include ground, polished and chipped stone tools, clay spools, spindlewhorls and rounded sherds used as loomweights, bone tools, jewels (stone, bone, clay pendants and beads). Noteworthy are 100 chipped stone tools probably deriving from the same core, found in a pit preceding house 1. Also, 132 clay figurines were collected, depicting humans and animals (three of which are bovines), and part of a marble figurine, along with six stamps with linear and spiral motifs. Asvestopetra. G. Karamitrou-Mentesidi (ADelt, 639) notes the investigation of deposits dated to the LNeo and Final Neo period at Mourtsouvades. Mainly small pits were found. Pottery includes coarse monochrome cooking and storage vessels, fruit-stands with painted red-on-white decoration, fine brown and black burnished ware, carinated phialae, with petal or button shaped lugs. Noteworthy is the large quantity of ground, polished and chipped stone tools. Koilada. A. Chondrogianni-Metoki (ADelt, 639-40) reports on the excavation of the Neo settlement in the Toumba Kremastis-Koiladas site (see also AR [2004-2005], 69). A total of 300 refuse pits, a long ditch (/. 100m) and another short ditch (/. 6m) were investigated, all hewn into the natural bedrock. Concentrations of vessels (including miniature ones) and many isolated vessels, accompanied by animal bones and grindstones, all as a rule placed in small pits, are interpreted as the remains of ceremonies related to the fertility of the earth and of animal stocks. Moreover, 23 cremation burials were unearthed, belonging to a cemetery dated to the last phase of the use of the area. All phases are dated to the LNeo period, prior to the Dimini phase. Knidi and Prionia. G. Karamitrou-Mendesidi (AEMTH 19 [2005], 542-62) produced a catalogue describing eleven archaeological sites in the area of Knidi. The sites were located by surface survey and some by excavation. They date from PH to Rom times. Rescue excavation was conducted at the Matsouka Rahi site (see also AR 52 [2005-2006], 86). Part (869m2) of the the L ENeo period (1st half of the 6th millennium BC) settlement situated on the flat part of the hill was investigated. The deposits, which are separated into two stratigraphie layers, are no more than 0.70m thick and contain building remains, such as parts of successive floors and small accumulations of stones. Pieces of clay bearing imprints of</page><page sequence="53">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2006-2007 53 branches testify to the use of wattle and daub techniques for the construction of dwellings. Shallow ellipsoid pits were also investigated. Pottery is mainly brown and red monochrome. Decorated vessels include painted ware (white-on-red and red on-white), impressed, barbotine and incised wares. Shapes are represented mainly by closed spherical and open phialae, with vertical handles or pierced lugs, while their bases could be flat, ring-shaped, conical or concave. Miniature vessels and fragmented miniature tables were also found. Other finds include numerous ground, polished and chipped stone tools, rounded sherds used probably as spindlewhorls and fifteen clay figurines representing humans and animals. A catalogue presenting six archaeological sites in the area of Prionia dating from IA to Rom times is also cited. They are also presented in Eleftherotypia, To Vima, Vradini and Ethnos (27/06/2006). Rescue excavation was conducted at the Ivani or Prionia 1 site, where a Hel settlement was located. A destroyed pottery kiln was investigated and some artefacts were collected, such as part of a Hel clay lekanis, bronze sheets of vessels, iron knives and nails, and part of a pithos. The excavation at Palaiomonastiro, near Prionia, revealed part of a Hel settlement, with walls belonging to two houses or building complexes. To the E of these, the remains of two circular pottery kilns were located, while six pit graves were investi gated in the wider area. The graves, all but one dating to the Rom period, contained clay vessels, iron weapons and coins. One grave is dated to Hel times. Kastri Polyneriou. S. Drougou, Ch. Kallini and L. Trakatelli (AEMTH 19 [2005], 563-68) and Eleftherotypia (24/05/2006) report on limited excavation in the fortified acropolis, where the circuit wall, a stoa, a temple and public buildings organized around a yard have been located (see also AR 51 [2004-2005], 68). The foundation of the buildings dates to the L4th Ct BC, their destruction to ca 150 BC. The Grevena Palaeolithic Survey. Katerina Harvati (Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology/New York) and Eleni Panagopoulou (EPS) report on the third and last season of the three-year Grevena Palaeolithic Survey. This season's aim was to establish the provenance of the stone tool assemblages located in the 2005 season, as well as to locate new Pal and palaeoanthropological/palaeontological sites in areas previously not explored (such as the normally submerged part of the Aliakmon valley, exposed in L autumn due to the lowering of the artificial Polyphytos lake). The broader purpose of this project is to help test hypotheses about the earliest colonization of the European continent by adding currently lacking evidence from SE Europe. Preliminary findings of the survey were presented at the 18th Annual Symposium for Archaeological Work in Macedonia and Thrace in 2005 and published in the proceedings, and at the Paleoanthropology Society and UISPP annual meetings in 2006. The Aliakmon river basin holds exceptional promise for Pal and palaeoanthropological research. The region has previously yielded Pal artefacts, including one of the two Lower Pal bifacial stone tools known from the country, and rich Pleistocene fauna. The present survey is the first systematic survey for this time period in this area. It focuses on the terraces of the river Aliakmon, which preserve Upper Pliocene to Pleistocene fluvial sediments and a rich Pliocene and Pleistocene fauna. Following the findings of the 2005 season, the survey area was expanded to include the exposed areas of the artificial Polyphytos lake of Aliakmon near Aiani, the river terrace surfaces around the lake and the longitudinal profiles near Axiokastro. Intensified survey was also undertaken on the terrace surfaces in the area of the new dam construction S of Grevena, near Karpero and Dimitra villages. Finally, all localities yielding fossils or lithics in previous seasons were revisited and surveyed. These areas had been considered as the most promising for preserving Pleistocene palaeontological and archaeological sites. Further indications of potentially additional Pal sites in the normally submerged (by the artificial Polyphytos lake) parts of the Aliakmon plain included a possibly Lower Pal bifacial tool recovered by the local archae ologist Areti Chondrogianni in 1999 (housed in the Aiani Archaeological Museum). Such finds are extremely rare in Greece. Only two similar artefacts have previously been reported, one recovered by Higgs in the Palaiokastron area of the Grevena region. Visibility was optimal on the terrace surfaces because of the stage in the annual cultivation cycle: most fields had not been sowed yet, while some had been recently ploughed. As in the previous seasons, GPS coordinates were recorded for each search area, and also for each major archaeological and fossil finding or concentration of findings. These coordinates were plotted on 1:5,000 topographic maps. Field observations were logged for each area searched and photographs were taken of both the areas and the specimens collected. Specimens were catalogued daily. Approximately 30 localities were searched. The previous seasons confirmed the existence of the terrace systems at the levels proposed previously, but concluded that the dating of the individual terraces was much more complicated than originally proposed due to the fact that most terraces are erosional rather than depositional in nature. Thus previous fossil finds at specific elevations are not necessarily correlated with the formation of a particular terrace but could be part of an older depositional event which was eroded down to a similar level. The depositional or erosional nature of the terraces was found to vary from locality to locality due to the complex depositional history of the river, with isolated patches of Pleistocene fossiliferous depositional terraces (such as the Kostarazi locality Lagoura) preserved in between the main erosional system. In the 2006 season we continued our geological evaluation focusing mainly on the areas of the Polyphytos lake, Karpero and Dimitra, and Palaiokastron (the presumed fmdspot of Higgs's handaxe ). An additional lithic assemblage was recovered from the area of Skitario, on the normally submerged parts of the Aliakmon plain on the SE shore of Polyphytos lake. Further lithics were recovered on the terrace surfaces around the lake and in the Karpero area, but in low frequencies. The highest fossil accumulations were again found in Kostarazi and Livakos, where several additional localities were searched. As in the previous seasons, no lithic assemblages were found inside the longitudinal profiles. All lithics collected were surface finds. Forty three lithic artefacts were collected in 2006. Thirteen artefacts were recovered from the beach among the river pebbles at the Skitario locality. All were fashioned from river pebbles of a green, coarse-grained volcanic material and may be assigned morphologically to the MPal. They consist mostly of flakes and some cores. Fifteen additional artefacts were collected from the surface of the terraces in the wider Karpero area. Notable among them were two quartz artefacts. The remaining lithics were fashioned from volcanic material. All can again be characterized as MPal based on their morpholog ical characteristics. Forty three fossil specimens were collected. These were for the most part representatives of the fauna collected in 2004 and 2005, with an emphasis on equids and proboscideans. These were mainly collected at the localities of Kostarazi (Lagoura)</page><page sequence="54">54 JAMES WHITLEY ETAL. and Livakos. Our total faunal list comprises equids, bovids, cervids, canids, proboscideans, rhinocerotids, suids and rodents, and possibly hippopotamus. Based on the fauna, these localities appear to date to the E Pleistocene or later. Byz Kozani. A. Petkos (ADelt, 670) reports on the restoration of murals at several churches.

A large ditch appears to have surrounded the settlement. This was confirmed later by trial trenches. G. Stratouli (AEMTH 19 [2005], 595-606) discusses the architectural features of the Neo settlement. A wide ditch (w. 5.50-1 lm, d. 2.15m) encircled the settlement, while a narrow one (w. 1.20m, d. 1.20m) is found inside the settlement. The former was filled with clay deposits rich in organic material and pottery, while the latter yielded a compact layer of burnt clay, possibly the remains of a wall. Pieces of clay with wooden imprints, mud-bricks and postholes provided information on building techniques. Moreover, narrow ditches that delineated the houses served as foundations for the walls, as evidenced by rows of postholes and stones used to reinforce the corners. Byz Kastoria. A.

Nomos of Pella (17th EPCA; 11th EBA) Pella, cemeteries. M. Lilimbaki-Akamati (ADelt, 601) reports that in Papargyriou plot a marble funeral stele showing Attic influence was recovered, dating to the E4th Ct BC. The excavation conducted after that in the plot unearthed thirteen tile graves, dated to the L4th-E3rd Ct BC according to pottery, terracottas and coins. In the W part of the plot a dump pit was located, filled with pottery and figurines. In a plot in the area of the anc. city's E cemetery (AEMTH 19 [2005], 391-406), a chamber tomb was discovered. A partially vaulted dromos leads to a central hall surrounded by seven chambers, all bearing plaster decoration, particularly the N one, with coloured lines. In three of the chambers the klines were placed on built pedestals, while in two others the klines were placed on stone blocks. The finds include a large number of vessels (lamps, skyphoi, perfume jars, Macedonian amphorae), figurines (one depicting Apt?odite or Cupid), jewellery, coins (Alexander III, Antigonos Sonatas, Philip V), two inscribed relief stelae and an altar (referring to Antigona, to Kleonike and Nikostrate). The tomb was in use from the E3rd to the M2nd Ct BC (see also AR 52 [2005-2006], 87). It is one the largest of this type in Greece, bearing influence from Egyptian and C funeral monuments. In the area of Fakos (see also AR 51 [2004-2005], 87) part of a fortifying wall surrounding two buildings was found, interpreted as military installations according to the anc. sources. Furthermore, in the area of the mod. village of Nea Pella trial trenches brought to light the W and probably the E wall of the anc. city, along with parts of buildings, graves of both the W cemetery and the cemetery of the Rom colony of Pella. Pella, palace (Fig. 70). P. Chrysostomou (ADelt, 601-04) reports on the ongoing excavation (see also AR 5\ [2004 2005], 70). In building I trial trenches were opened in order to estimate the yard dimensions (/. 32m, w. 28m, total 900m2). In the centre of the yard an altar was found, while in front of the peristylion three exedrai were revealed, probably for votives and statues. In building V (palaistra), W of the ephebeion, a room with a mosaic floor was investigated, hypo thetically interpreted as epistasion. To the W of it there is another room which could be interpreted as elaiothesion. Building Via proved to have a yard with peristylion, with rooms behind the N, W and S stoa. The rooms had floors of compact soil, the walls were decorated with plaster and the roof had tiles of Laconian type. They are interpreted as a dormitory complex for the 'royal youth'. Doric architectural pieces suggest that the stoas were ofthat order. Portable finds include Hel pottery, a lamp, sealed amphora handles and three coins (one of Kassander). Pella, agora. I. Akamatis (AEMTH 19 [2005], 407-25) reports on the 2005 excavation season. In the NE corner of the agora trial trenches were opened in order to investigate the stairs and the adjacent drainage system, all dated to the last quarter of the 4th Ct BC. In building block 7, SE of the S stoa, which is demarcated by four roads, sixteen rooms were located in the W and eight in the E part, organized around two yards. In the S part small rooms facing a road are interpreted as magazines. In one of them tiles of Laconian type were found stored. Also, the S central drain, which collected water from the stoa roofs and the central court yard, has been investigated and restored. In the S part of the agora, fills were removed from above the roads, yielding a variety of portable finds: stamped amphora handles of diverse provenances (noteworthy is one handle with the inscription T7EI2I/?HMOY), ivory styluses, stone and ivory decorative pieces, a gold ring, a silver earring, metal keys, daggers and tools, lead weights, faience pendants, glassware fragments, seals, clay moulds for the production of pyxis lids, terracottas, clay vessels (a fragment of a panathenaic amphora, pelike, rf vessels, lekanidai with lids and a kantharos bearing the inscription ?IOJ. OIAIOY), coins and pieces of sculptures. To the W of the central drainage fourteen graves were investigated, hewn into the bedrock. The grave goods</page><page sequence="56">56 JAMES WHITLEY ET AL.

Lilimbaki-Akamati, in To Vima and Ta Nea (01/03/2007), Hemerisia and Express (03/03/2007) and Apogevmatini (05/03/2007) reports that architectural remains, dated to the lst-4th Ct AD, were revealed in the S part of the anc. city, near the port. This evidence shows that the city was inhabited until the 4thCt AD and not abandoned after the destructive earthquake in 90 BC, as was previously believed. The remains belong to building complexes incorporated in the urban plan. A Rom bath was richly decorated with mosaic floors, marble inlays and colourful plaster, and yielded a wealth of portable finds. Agrosykia. P. Chrysostomou (ADelt, 604) reports on the rescue excavations on Peliti or Kastri hill (see also AR 51 [2004-2005], 70). The settlement dates from LNeo to ECh times. After 380 AD, due to invasions, it was fortified with a thick wall (w. 1.30m), while its destruction and abandonment dates after 474 AD. Messiano Giannitson, (anc. Archontiko). P. Chrysostomou and A. Zarogiannis (AEMTH 19 [2005], 427-34) report that pits opened by looters E of the mod. cemetery revealed part of the E cemetery of the anc. settlement. Ten pit graves were located, while one was excavated, revealing an Ar male burial accompanied by three iron spearheads and three clay vessels (exaleiptron, Ionic kylix and kantharoid kotyle). To the N, two Ar graves and one Hel grave were uncovered. The Ar graves had as offerings a gold stomion, bronze vessels (lebes and phiale), clay vessels (exaleiptra, Ionic kylix, krater, bucchero oinochoe) and iron weapons (sword, spearheads and knife). W of the cemetery pit graves, densely placed, were investigated. Thirteen of them contained inhumations in wooden sarcophagi and two cremations, dated to the 2nd and 3rd quarter of the 6th Ct BC. Finds include bronze and iron jewellery (earrings, rings, fibulae, pins, pendants, beads, belts), ivory and glass beads, bronze phialae and clay vessels (local, Cor and Ionian phialae, hydriae, lebes, kotylae, exaleiptra, oinochoe, kylikes, prochoi, aryballoi, ladles), weapons (swords, spearheads, knives). Noteworthy is that all female burials were accompanied by an iron knife. Ten Cl-EHel graves yielded metal jewellery (gold and bronze earrings, bronze rings, fibulae), bronze coins (Kassander, Amynta III, Phillip II), clay vessels (pyxis, pelike, kanastra, lekythia, boisai type skyphoi, perfume cruets), bone astragali and weapons (spearheads). Archontiko. P. Chrysostomou (ADelt, 605-06) reports that the N part of the settlement wall was investigated (/. 7m, w. 5m). Portable finds include pottery and small finds from PH and historical times. P. Chrysostomou and A. Chrysostomou (AEMTH 19 [2005], 435-47) report on further investigation in the W necropolis, dated to IA, Ar, Cl and EHel times (see also AR 52 [2005-2006], 88). In total, 142 graves were investigated in five excavation sectors. The 49 graves dating to the IA were mostly pit graves and rarely cist graves, yielding as offerings jewellery, weapons and pottery. Noteworthy is grave 507, where the deceased female was adorned with iron and bronze rings, bronze bracelets, gold, glass and amber beads, and accompanied with an oinochoe, a cup and a phiale. To the Ar period belong 66 pit graves. The graves of male 'warriors' were accompanied by weapons (helmets, shields, spearheads, knives, swords) often decorated with gold sheet, gold, silver, bronze and iron jewels (rings, sheet, pins, stomia - three deriving from the same mould and depicting lions), clay vessels (exaleiptron, an Attic kylix depicting male figures, an Attic banded kylix depicting deers, an Attic kylix of type C, aryballoi, prochoi, a lekythos of the 'Departing Warrior' type, an Attic bf skyphos depicting a soldier and a horse rider, an Attic bf kylix-skyphos depicting a lion and a male figure), bronze vessels (lebes, oinochoe, phiale, prochoi), iron models of carriages and furniture, terracottas depicting animal and human figures, a faience figurine in the shape of a hedgehog. Worth mentioning for its rich finds is grave 443, dated to M6th Ct BC, where the warrior was accompanied by a helmet and a shield, a sword decorated with gold sheet, spearheads and knives, a gold stomion decorated with lions and rosettes, a double iron pin with a gilded head, gold sheet for decorating footwear, iron models of a rural carriage and furniture, seven bronze vessels, three faience miniature oinochoe, an Ionian kylix and exaleiptron and eight terracottas depicting female figures. Female graves yielded gold, silver, bronze and iron jewellery (gold mouth stomia, rosettes, sheets, diadems, pendants, beads, earrings, bracelets, pins - some with gold or amber heads - fibulae, rings, glass and faience beads, a necklace with glass and amber beads and pendants), weapons (iron knives), bronze vessels (skyphos, phiale, lebes, oinochoe, kantharoi), clay vessels (kylix, hydriae, bucchero vessels, kotyle, exaleiptra, skyphoi, kylikes of the Siannon type, prochoi, lebes, aryballoi depicting a Siren and a lion, Cor alabastron, kotyle, trefoil-lipped oinochoe and amphoriskoi, Ionian kylikes, an Attic amphora depicting a panther and a second depicting a Sphinx, a bf kylix-skyphos depicting Maenads with Satyrs, a bf kylix depicting bulls, trefoil-lipped black glaze oinochoe, a banded kylix depicting a lion attacking a wild boar and another depicting a lion and a male figure, a lekane depicting Sphixes), iron models of carriages, terracottas depicting human and animal figures. Also worth mentioning is the female burial from grave 458, dated to the 3rd quarter of 6th Ct BC. The deceased was accompanied by 28 terracottas, faience figurines depicting deities and hedgehogs, iron models of carriages and furniture, seventeen bronze vessels, faience vessels, clay vessels (a cut neck jar, a Cor pyxis and an Attic banded kylix-skyphos depicting swans), amber beads and pins, gold sheets for decorating garments, a gold ring and necklace, gold discs with rosettes, silver pins with gold heads holding a silver chain ending in gold snake heads, gold diadems depicting riders and wild animals, a gold face mask with elaborate decoration of terrestrial and marine animals, floral and geometric motifs and stellar symbols. To the Cl and EHel period belong 28 graves, mainly pit graves and some tile graves. The offerings included clay vessels (Cl skyphoi, lekythia, kanastra, skyphidia, pelike, boisai skyphoi, pyxis and EHel boisai skyphoi, lamps and perfume vessels), bronze coins (Amyntas III, Phillip II, Alexander III, Kassander and successors), bronze wreaths, strigils, weapons (iron spearheads and knives), jewellery (gold pendants and earrings, bronze and iron fibulae and pins, iron, bronze and silver rings), clay female busts, terracottas, lead pyxis and bone astragali. All of these luxury items confirm the commercial relation ships between the Macedonians and the W and the E parts of the Mediterranean world (E Aegean, Asia Minor, Phoenicia, and Egypt), as well as the cities of S Greece (Athens, Corinth, etc).</page><page sequence="58">58 JAMES WHITLEY ET AL. Edessa. A. Chrysostomou (ADelt, 606) reports that in O. Stenimahou three rooms of a bath were investigated. The first was an auxiliary room, while the other two were probably parts of the caldarium. The destruction of the bath dates to the 2nd half of the 3rd Ct AD. At the junction of O. Stenimahou and Kapetan Garefi 70 (ADelt, 608) graves were investigated, dated to Rom and postByz times. Noteworthy is one tomb of Macedonian type with an arch roofed dromos leading to its entrance. In a plot in the area of the N cemetery of the lower city (AEMTH 19 [2005], 449-63) five graves were investigated, mostly looted in anc. times. Three are cist graves hewn out of the bedrock, two are subterranean chamber tombs. One cist grave (number 90) yielded a boisai skyphos and a rf pelike depicting a Cupid between two female figures, dating to the L4th Ct BC. Grave 88 yielded a gold stomion, a lamp, a fish plate and a perfume vessel, dating to the 2nd Ct BC. Chamber tomb 91 had a dromos on the S side (/. 5.5m, w. 2m and 4.10m in the entrance) with eleven curved steps leading to the entrance. In the interior were two built bases where the wooden klines rested. Portable finds include clay vessels ('W slope' skyphoi, skyphidia and unguentarium), part of a bronze strigil and a pin. The finds date the tomb to the 2nd Ct BC. Chamber tomb 93 had also a small dromos with steps leading to the entrance. Finds such as amphoriskoi, kantharoi, a megaric skyphos, skyphidia and coins (of Phillip V and Macedonians) date the grave to the L3rd-2nd Ct BC. Also, traces of an earlier use of the area (prior to EHel) have been revealed. These include parallel channels hewn into the bedrock (possibly traces of anc. roads), cuttings in the bedrock for the extraction of stone and a subterranean storage pit containing two pithoi. Aridaia, Loutraki. E. Kambouroglou, Th. Xatzitheodorou, D. Bouzas, N. Zahariades and I. Mitsis (AEMTH 19 [2005], 293 308) present palaeontological-sedimentological research in cave A, conducted by the Ephorate of Palaeoanthropology and Speleology of S Greece. Six archaeological deposits dated to the Neo period were distinguished. C14 dates suggest an age of 5900 BP. The methods employed to establish the chronology of the site (i.e., OSL, E.S.R, C14) exclude the use of the cave prior to the Neo period. Aloros. A. Chrysostomou (ADelt, 609-10) reports on the investigation of the W wall of the fortified settlement SE of the mod. village. On the N side the existence of a gate was confirmed. Also, the two construction phases of the wall were clarified, with the upper LRom part built of limestone and the earlier part built of stone, mudstone and mud. Apsalos. A. Chrysostomou (ADelt, 610-11) reports that at Grammi, NE of the mod. village, remains of a Neo settlement were located. The settlement belongs to the flat, extended type of sites, covering at least 5ha, as the surface finds suggest. The houses were post-framed, with food processing and storage facilities. Portable finds included pottery of various types, stone and clay sling bullets, ground and polished stone tools, bone artefacts and figurines. Byz Pella Nea Pella, ECh basilica. A.

Koukouvou (ADelt, 611) reports that in O. Feidiou and Persefonis two graves were located. One is a large chamber tomb that contains a cist grave with three inhumations. At O. Egnatias (ADelt, 611) a Hel grave was investigated. Remains of three wooden klines were found. Grave goods include clay vessels ('Macedonian' amphorae, ladles, lamps, perfume vessels, pyxis, skyphidia), bronze coins, iron strigils, bronze needles and lead pyxis. At O. Pontou (ADelt, 611-13) a rock-cut grave was excavated, bearing traces of white plaster on the walls and red colour in the entrance. Grave goods were exclusively clay vessels (pyxis, ladles, lamps, perfume vessels and amphorae). At O. Komninon 16-17 (ADelt, 613) another rock-cut grave was found. Although looted, it still contained some offerings (clay vessels, a bronze coin and a terracotta figurine). All the above graves date to the 2nd Ct AD. Paliomanna site. A. Koukouvou (ADelt, 613-15) reports on the excavation of the W and E limits of a large Rom building (35m by 25m). Three cisterns hewn into the bedrock belong to the building. The first (2.70m by 4.15m) had a stone desk on the N and a pithos on the E side. The second (3.42m by 4.10m) was plastered with hydraulic plaster and had pipes for water. Six clay vessels were incorporated in two walls serving the fish-farming needs for which the cistern was supposedly used. The third cistern is separated by a wall into two spaces. The building had a storage room with pithoi, storage pits, hearths and ovens. Pottery finds include cooking, storage and terra sigilata vessels. Other finds were clay lamps, figurines, bronze jewels, loomweights, slags and lead pieces, numerous nails and bronze coins. The first phase of the building dates to LHel times, but it continues to be in use from the 1st Ct BC to the 4th Ct AD. The building is interpreted as the pars rustica of a rural villa. Asomata. A. Koukouvou (ADelt, 615) notes a brief excavation in an area with remains covering lha. Rooms with walls of local limestone were revealed, dated by pottery and coinage to Hel times. Lefkadia. M.

Vergina. A. Kottaridi (ADelt, 615-16) reports on investigation of 40 burials found in various plots. A 1st Ct AD grave, located at the NE end of the necropolis, was marked with a stone per?bolos. On the NW side of the necropolis a 9th Ct BC tumulus was excavated, covering the burials of two women and a girl. In the Cl necropolis, pit and mud-brick built graves were revealed, dating to the L5th and 4th Cts BC, along with some</page><page sequence="59">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2006-2007 59 graves dating to the 2nd Ct BC. Grave goods include jewellery, perfume vessels, exaleiptra, terracottas, skyphoi, kraters, kantharoi, strigils, gilt bronze wreaths and coins. Most of the graves, however, were found looted. Remains of funeral ceremonies were also traced. On top of a large pit grave of the 5th Ct BC a stone base serving as a funeral mark was found upside down. S. Drougou (AEMTH 19 [2005], 475-81) reports on further excavations which focused on the area W of the anc. theatre, as well as on the dromos of the large Macedonian tomb with the Ionic fa?ade near the mod. town hall. In the former area poor remains of walls were unearthed. In the area of the Macedonian tomb the stone-built S wall of the dromos (/. 15m, w. 10m, h. 3m) was revealed. Noteworthy is an enagismos, yielding mainly black-glazed pinakia, dating to the L4th Ct BC. To the SE of the tomb a dump pit was found filled with large quantities of Hel pottery of the M2nd Ct BC, mainly tableware likely to be used in a burial ceremony. M. Manoledakis (AEMTH 19 [2005], 483-94) presents a method for studying the Geography of Claudius Ptolemaios, the 2nd Ct AD geographer, regarding the co-ordinates he gives for many anc. cities, including Aigai. According to a mathe matical reconciliation with contemporary maps it is concluded that in the 2nd Ct AD Aigai was situated a few km S W of mod. Vergina. This implies that the anc. Macedonian capital was originally built somewhere else in the general area and was destroyed before Ptolemy's time, as archaeological evidence supports. The inhabitants probably moved SW and established a new city to which Ptolemy refers. A. Kottaridi, in Kathimerini and Eleftheros typos (03/03/2007), Eleftherotypia and Ethnos (05/03/2007) reports on the excavation in a plot in the area of the anc. cemetery, SW of the tumulus cemetery. A total of 80 Ar pit graves were inves tigated and yielded, although looted, a wealth of grave offerings such as vessels for funeral ceremonies (cups and jugs), symposium vessels (krater, denos, oinochoe), bf skyphoi, perfume vessels often in the shape of a bird, Cor aryballoi and exalieptra, alabasters, mouth pieces, terracotta figurines often from Samos, carriage models, a sword and a helmet of the 'illyric' type. Furthermore, she argues that the 'Tomb of Romaios', the tomb discovered by K. Romaios in the NW part of the anc. city, actually belonged to Thessaloniki, the sister of Alexander the Great. Sfekia, Keramaria site. A. Kottaridi (ADelt, 616-17) reports on a rescue excavation here. A large ditch of irregular shape was investigated (/. 11m, w. 8m, d. 1.50m), filled with archi tectural features, like pieces of floor and hearths with remains of charred seeds, but also with large quantities of pottery (noteworthy is a pot containing snails), animal bones and stone tools. The ditch is interpreted as an ellipsoid semi-subter ranean house, dated to the MNeo period. Polished and chipped stone tools, along with figurine fragments and clay table legs, were found scattered in the N and E side of the suggested house. Clay sling bullets, beads, bone tools and two stone human figurines were also unearthed. To the E of the house three shallow dump pits were found, while a fourth larger and deeper pit was located to the SE. The latter was found filled with stone tool fragments, clay lumps and traces of fire. Byz Imathia Veria, church of Agioi Petros and Pavlos. A.

Sawopoulou and E.Tsagaraki (AEMTH 19 [2005], 227-38) report on excavation in a plot where construc tion works damaged part of a monumental grave. The excavation revealed a single-chambered vaulted grave, built with tiles. The walls were covered with white plaster. Two beds adjoined in the corner and an edranon for offerings was found in the interior. The grave contained six burials: four inhumations and two cremations. Grave goods include a 'West slope' pyxis, a 'Macedonian' amphora, a perfume cruet, ladles, skyphoi, coinage, gold spear-shaped leaves and a bronze ring, all dating to the 2nShalf of the 2nd Ct BC. In the same plot a workshop installation was also revealed, with an ovoid-shaped pottery kiln, a pithos fixed in a pit and a large cobbled area. The finds include abundant wheelmade pottery (hydrias, pan-shaped vessels, phiale, trefoil-lipped oinochoe, a perfume cruet and mainly unpainted everyday vessels), tile fragments, a few glass fragments and iron small finds. Finds date to ERom times. Noteworthy are the numerous unusual clay objects, which are elongated, oblong in cross-section and with a cylindrical pipette. They are interpreted as the products of the workshop, while their use is related to apiculture by analogy with mod. objects. Nomos of Thessalonike (16th EPCA; 9th EBA) Thessalonike (centre) Archaeological Museum of Thessalonike. P. Adam-Veleni, in Eleftherotypia (01/07/2007) and Ta Nea (07/07/2006), presents the five thematic exhibitions that constitute the new display proposal of the Museum, inaugurated on 08/09/2006. The museum narrative, organized chronologically, begins with the exhibition '5,000, 15,000, 200,000 years ago ... An exhibition about life in PH Macedonia'. This thematic unit is enriched with audiovisual discussion on the PH household by three distinguished archaeologists. The exhibition 'Towards the birth of cities ...' presents the material remains from settlements and cemeteries in the region between mount Athos and Olympus dating to the IA (1100-700 BC). The exhibition 'In Macedonia from the 7th Ct BC until L antiquity' highlights aspects of the public and private life of the anc. Macedonians from the Ar period until the 3rd Ct AD. Some of the objects exhibited are on public display for the first time. Interactive touch-screen multimedia applications introduce the visitor to the form and functions of anc. Macedonian cities and Macedonian tombs. A video presents mod. theatrical productions of anc. drama, and for the first time the visitor has the chance to listen to an anc. melody, following the transcription of the musical symbols from a 3rd Ct BC inscription found in Vrasna (Asprovalta). The exhibition 'Thessaloniki, the Metropolis of Macedonia' stresses the unique role Thessaloniki played during the Rom period. The multimedia presentations 'Where is the ancient</page><page sequence="60">60 JAMES WHITLEY ET AL. city hidden?' and 'Take a tour of the Galerian complex' accompany this exhibition. The exhibition is completed by the reconstruction of an Ar Ionian temple, transported to Thessalonica's sanctuary area during the Rom period. The statues of emperors found inside the temple suggest that it was connected with imperial worship. The forthcoming (2007-2008) periodical exhibitions of the Museum are: 'The Derveni papyrus and Orphism in Macedonia', 'The Museum narrates its history' and 'Ancient Kalindoia'. K. Tsantsanoglou, G, Parasoglou and Th. Kouremenos, Eleytherotypia (12/10/2006) present the first complete edition of the Derveni papyrus, published by the Italian scientific press Corpus dei Papyri Filosofici. The volume includes the reconstruction of the cylinder and an edition of the whole text, accompanied by translation, comments and images. The augur Euthyphron is believed to have been the author of the 5th Ct BC text. The multi-spectral digital imaging of the papyrus by the team of A. Pieris and D. Obbink has been completed (see AR 51 [2005-2006], 90). A report on the anc. inscriptions in Thessaloniki has appeared: NiyS??ri?, FT.M., EmypaciK?

Adam-Veleni (ADelt, 517-21 ) reports on rescue excavations in the anc. agora undertaken on the occasion of restoration works. In the Odeion, the sections between the brackets and the surface of the mod. road of O. Agnostou Stratioti were investigated. Between the brackets b-c, the interior of the SE corner of the 'longitudinal building' was explored, dated to the M2nd-lst Ct BC. To the N of this building and between brackets c-d, as well as d-e, lay part of a water pipe constructed carefully with tiles, schist slabs and mortar, accompanied by LHel pottery. W of the water pipe a cistern was revealed. Between brackets d-e, two pipes covered with architectural features were unearthed, dated by pottery to Imperial times. Between brackets e-f, part of a mosaic floor of colourful tesserae was unearthed, it appears to be earlier than the two above-mentioned pipes. In sector K, a thick destruction layer was revealed, with abundant Hel pottery ('West slope' kantharoi, pyxis lids, spindle-shaped perfume cruets, etc). In the area of the 'Krypte Stoa', a lime kiln, pits and a system of pipes were investigated. Although dated to later periods, their layers yielded abundant Hel pottery, terracottas, moulds and lamps. P. Adam-Veleni, H. Zografou, D. Kaluga and N.

Kotsakis (AEMTH 19 [2005], 157-71) summarize the investigation of the storage spaces found on top of the BA settlement. The results of the morphological and the technological study of pithoi found in the buildings of this area are discussed in comparison with the material from the Toumba Kastanas. An estimation of the space occupied by pithoi in building complex A is given, which allowed an inference on the internal organi zation of the group that lived there and its socio-political relations with other inhabitants of the settlement. R. Veropoulidou, S. Andreou and K. Kotsakis (AEMTH 19 [2005], 173-86), discuss the archaeological evidence of purple-dye production in the settlement, based on the analysis of the shell assemblage and its spatial distribution, particularly the crushed murex shells and the context in which they were found. The data suggest the purple dye was produced already from the L MBA, an activity which continued until the L LBA. They also indicate that it was a small-scale production aiming at satisfying the local community needs.</page><page sequence="62">62 JAMES WHITLEY ET AL. Toumba bank. K. Soueref (ADelt, 525-26) reports on the rescue excavation at O. Elaias 4, where Ar and Cl building remains were unearthed. The first phase dates to EAr times. From the M to the L6th Ct BC intense building activity is observed. To this period belong storage areas, a circular stone structure and another ellipsoid one. In the NE corner of the plot three metal vessels were found in situ, placed on the traces of the fire, along with stone tools. To the W of these a large disposal pit was excavated, partially covered with mud-bricks and filled with abundant pottery, shells and bones. The Ar phase is sealed with a destruction layer, above which the 5th Ct BC phase follows. In this phase the circular stone structure was filled with stones and the workshop was used as storage area, evidenced by fragments of amphorae and pithoi. The last phase dates to the 4th Ct BC and is very fragmentarily represented. Pottery finds include Ar bf, Cor and local vessels, as well as Cl black glazed vessels. At O. Dryos 5 (ADelt, 527-29, see also AR 51 [2004-2005], 75) walls dated to the 5th and 4th Cts BC were revealed in the W part of the plot, covered by a destruction layer with a large amount of tiles. In the E part a square room with a floor of compacted soil and a stone threshold was revealed. A storage area was also investigated with at least sixteen pithoi found in situ, dated to the 5th Ct BC. The pithoi were placed in pits dug into the 6th Ct destruction layer. Below this 6th Ct BC destruction layer pottery dating to the 7th Ct BC was found. In the S part of the plot EIA layers were located. Pottery finds include 6th-4th Ct BC black glazed and unpainted vessels, Cor and bf pottery, fragments of an amphora depicting sphinxes, handmade vessels and pithoi. Small finds include loomweights, spindle-whorls and stone tools. Toumba cemetery. At O. Kizikou 38-40 (ADelt, 529), eight IA pit graves (five with schist covering) were investigated, accompanied by vessels (phialae, grey wheelmade cups, two handled kantharoid vessels, two handled phialae, a fine red slipped vessel with very thin walls) and jewellery (bronze earrings, fibulae and rings, iron rings). At the junction of O. Isidorou, Abderon and Megakleous (ADelt, 529-30) a pit grave with schist covering was investigated. The offerings included a bf kylix-skyphos, a lekythos, an iron sword and a dagger, two bronze fibulae, a bronze ring and a small glass pointed amphora. In the E part of the plot an assemblage of four vessels was revealed: an Attic plemochoe of type B, two Attic bf on white background lekythoi and a small close-shaped ribbed vessel (probably Cor). The finds date from the 5th to the 3rd Ct BC. The vessels must have been placed there in mod. times. At O. Ostrovou 29 (ADelt, 530) four pit graves with schist coverings were investigated. The graves were poorly furnished yielding only two handled red-slipped phiales. At O. Neapoleos 15 (ADelt, 530) four pit graves with schist coverings were investigated. Among noteworthy the grave goods are IA grey wheelmade one-handled cups. Pylaia, Finikas area. M. Tsimbidou-Avloniti, A. Kaiafa and H. Lykidou (AEMTH 19 [2005], 197-209), report on the excavation of the Cl-EHel cemetery at Kis-Toumba. In total 21 graves were investigated: seven pit graves, three tile graves, a sarcophagus and nine cist graves (some looted in antiquity), dating to the period from Archelaos (413-400/399 BC) to Antigonos Gonatas (277-239 BC), according to coinage. Noteworthy among the offerings are a tiny silver key and caduceus (kerykeion) in a male burial, while a child's burial contained twin theatric terracottas depicting Hercules with a slave. Of particular interest was cist grave 4 which, though looted, still contained a number of grave goods, including clay vessels, a gilded iron strigil, a silver kantharos, remnants of a gold myrtle wreath and of an elaborately decorated wooden bed (with ivory and glass items, gilded clay figures of griffins tearing up deer and discs with a relief Athena head), along with a gold coin of Philip II. The interior of the grave was colourfully decorated with a band of dentils, palmettes in pink and blue, and tendrils emerging from acanthus leaves painted on a deep blue ground. This subject was very popular in the iconography of sepulchral monuments of the 2nd half of the 4th Ct BC as the flowering tendril implies constant rebirth and the triumph of life over death. At the Ligaria site, M. Tsimbidou-Avloniti reports (ADelt, 530-31) on the rescue excavation in a plot where 57 graves were investigated, dated from the E5th to the E4th Ct BC. The grave types include three sarcophagi, ten pit graves, 21 mud brick cist graves and 22 tile graves. Among the grave goods are black glazed and rf skyphoi, aryballoid lekythia, gold and silver jewellery, terracottas and clay busts, as well as coins. In the same plot remains of two buildings were uncovered, one having one room and the other three rooms with a hearth and pits. The buildings possibly belong to a farmhouse which must be later in date than the cemetery. In O. Antistaseos (ADelt, 531) she notes two Hel tile graves yielding poor grave goods. Kalamaria, O. Th. Sofouli. M. Tsimbidou-Avloniti (ADelt, 531-32) reports that due to drainage works two areas of archae ological interest were investigated. In the area with LRom building remains, seven refuse pits and three child burials were located. Amounts of shell and pottery were found (mostly unpainted vessels, with rippled or grooved decoration, red painted fish plates and lamps). Also, walls probably related to the coastal settlement were located. In the second area, 39 graves (pit and cist graves) were excavated. Grave goods include vessels and bronze jewellery (multi-spiral bracelets, 8 shaped fibula, gilded omphalion), dated from the EIA to Geo and Ar times. E environs of Thessalonike Karabournaki. M. Tiverios, E. Manakidou and D. Tsiafaki (AEMTH 19 [2005], 187-95), discuss the excavation in the anc. settlement where parts of residential and storage spaces were found, along with semi-subterranean structures. Geo and Ar pottery was found in large quantities, either local or deriving from workshops around the Thermaic gulf (e.g., Mende, Torone, Polychrono, Olynthus), as well as various workshops of the anc. Gr world (Euboia, E Greece, Thessaly, Corinth, Attica, NE Aegean). The presence of EIA pottery testifies to an earlier occupation of the settlement in the Elst millennium BC. Thermi. E. Skarlatidou (ADelt, 532-36) reports on the rescue excavations in plots in the area of the anc. cemetery. In plot 158a eight graves were investigated: four cist and four pit graves. One female cist grave (dated to 540-530 BC) yielded numerous gold jewels, a bronze hydria, fourteen bronze phialae, Attic and Cor vessels, figurative vessels and E Greece terracotta. Another cist grave of the same date was looted, resulting in bronze offerings (e.g., phialae and a bronze shield) being severely damaged. Other finds included Cor (mainly exaleiptra) and Attic vessels, as well as terracotta. One of the pit graves contained the burial of a girl, accompanied by a silver bracelet decorated with lion head terminals (Fig. 72), dating to the 2nd half of the 5th Ct BC. In plot 286a a total of 70 graves were explored: mostly pit graves, but also five cist graves, a pithos burial, a sarcophagus and two tile graves. Although most of the graves were looted</page><page sequence="63">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2006-2007 63 3cm 72. Thermi: 5th Ct BC silver bracelet with lion head terminals in anc. times, they still contained a number of grave goods such as clay vessels (spouted phialae, jugs, skyphoi and black-glaze kantharoi), jewellery (bronze bracelets, earrings, pins, glass and bone beads) and bronze coins. In a child burial, a gold earring, a bronze mirror, a clay female bust, two terracottas and 40 astragali were placed. The graves date from LAr to EHel times. In plot 29f, 146 graves were investigated. Most of them are pit graves, but there were also seven cist graves, seven sarcophagi (Fig. 73) and 21 jar or pithos burials. Noteworthy is the case of six large pithoi placed in a pit and covered with schist slabs, dated to the LIA or EAr period. To the same period belong numerous narrow pit graves. Among the grave goods clay vessels dominate (phialae, kanthroi, cups, cut-neck jars with painted decoration, small spouted lekanai) and bronze jewels (bracelets, pins, rings, fibulae). Male burials were often accompanied by weapons (iron spearheads and daggers). In the Ar period burials in pithoi and amphorae, as well as pit graves are common. Cist graves date to LAr times and they are usually accompanied by clay vessels (Attic and Cor, along with local), bronze jewels and weaponry (iron swords, iron and bronze spearheads). Stone sarcophagi date to the LAr period and the 5th Ct BC. The pit-type graves appeared until LCI times. 73. Thermi: Cl sarcophagus grave with contents In plot 387a, a total of 58 graves was investigated dating from Ar to ERom times (i.e. 6th Ct BC to 1st Ct AD). It seems, however, that the space was not in use as a cemetery during the M and LHel period. Although many graves were looted, some yielded as offerings local and imported vessels, gold, silver and bronze jewellery, as well as weapons. The commonest find in Rom graves is the perfume cruet. In plot 374, 103 graves of various types were located. Due to financial problems they were not investigated. V Allamani (ADelt, 536-43) reports on the rescue excavations in plots in the area of the anc. cemetery. In plot 385, 161 graves were investigated: 90 pit graves of various types, dated from the IA to Ar and Cl times. Noteworthy is an Ar female burial accompanied by two bronze bracelets, glass beads, a Cor kotyle, a bronze diadem, an ape terracotta and a local bucchero of kernos type. The finds suggest that the deceased was possibly a priestess. The finds from Cl graves include mainly black glazed vessels (skyphoi, boisai kylix, kantharoi), bronze coins, silver and gold jewellery (a wreath, mouth pieces, earrings, rings), clay female busts, iron weapons (spearheads, daggers) and strigils. The 45 cist graves date mainly to Ar times and yielded Cor vessels (skyphoi kotylae, spherical aryballoi, exaleiptra), local bucchero vessels, bronze jewellery (beads, rings, bracelets, pins, fibulae). The sarcophagi, which date to the L5th-E4,h Ct BC, yielded Attic pottery (Fig. 74), clay alabastra, glass vessels, gold, silver and bronze jewellery, coins, iron weapons and strigils, terracottas and clay busts. Six cremations were also investigated, five in LAr urns and one in a pit dated to the E4th CtBC. In plot 379, 117 graves were unearthed: 67 pit graves, 38 cist graves, three sarcophagi, four jar burials and five cremation urns (Fig. 75), dated from the L7th to the E4th Ct BC. Noteworthy is the presence of Attic and Cor pottery, along with local vessels, while one of the cist graves contained a bf hydria depicting sphinxes, three Cor vessels (aryballoi and kotyle), a bf kylix, a local gray exaleiptron, along with bronze jewels and a gold mouth piece. Other finds include a bronze phiale, bronze jewels (bracelets, rings and fibulae), glass and amber beads and weapons in male burials. Furthermore, in the S part of the plot the remains of two buildings were revealed, dated to the 4th-E3rd Ct BC. They might be interpreted as parts of a sanctuary (according to terracotta finds), or simply residences of people related to the needs of the cemetery. The buildings could also be a farmstead, as there were rooms with evidence of household activities (loomweights, storage jars). 74.

Among the five pit graves are a female burial accompanied by a double axe pendant, two bronze bracelets, a bronze fibula, a silver sheet and a Cor exaleiptron, and a male burial accompanied by an iron shaft and dagger, a Cor kotyle and a silver coin of Akanthos, dated to the 5th Ct BC. The most carefully constructed pit grave dates to the 2nd half of the 4th Ct BC, according to the type of a black glazed kantharos found. The two cist graves contained child burials accompanied by a gold sheet, two iron double pins, a female terracotta, a black glaze kylix and a salt cellar dated to the last quarter of the 6th Ct BC. The only sarcophagus yielded an E5th Ct BC Attic bf kylix and black glazed footed pinakion, a L6th Ct BC black glazed kylix of type C, a painted exaleiptron, an iron dagger, two gold pendants in the shape of an amphora and a double axe, glass beads of marguerite shape and bone beads.

Lagyna: Ar/Cl pottery from a grave Nea Philadelpeia. V. Misailidou-Despotidou (ADelt, 552-53) reports on the excavations in the IA table settlement and cemetery. In the N sector of the settlement stratigraphie trenches were investigated, while in the S sector a support wall was unearthed (/. 20m, w. 0.60m). To the S of the latter a series of successive rooms was found along with part of a building. IA pottery includes large pithoi, prochoi, amphorae, phialae and cups, often bearing incised or painted decoration. In the cemetery 322 graves were investigated, the majority dated to the IA, apart from sixteen graves dating to the 4th-3rd Ct BC and seven graves dating to the 1st Ct AD. The common burial practice is inhumation in pit and cist graves and pithoi. Cremations in urns comprise a minor group. To the Cl and EHel times belong pit and cist graves, while to the Rom times tile and pit graves. The IA finds include clay vessels, bronze and iron jewels and tools, some gold stomia and one sword preserving part of its leather case. The Cl and EHel graves contained black glazed and rf vessels, terracottas, jewels and coins. The Rom graves yielded glass vessels, perfume cruets and bronze coins. Anc. Kalindia. K. Sismanidis (AEMTH 19 [2005], 145-55) reports on further investigations in the Sebasteion (see also AR 51 [2005-2006], 91). Two more adjacent rooms were explored, in front of which six bases of monuments were found attached. Room IV had an entrance opened in the centre of the fa?ade, while two stone bases were found in the centre of the room in situ, presumably to support wooden columns. Along the three walls lay a structure interpreted as a thranos - a long bench for symposia. Supporting evidence for this interpretation is provided by huge quantities of broken cooking vessels and symposium utensils, along with amounts of bones from large and small animals, birds, seashells and snail shells. Among the noteworthy finds from the room is a round clay tile depicting in relief a Nike with a naked seated Hermes. Behind the figures is the name 'Parnasou\ Also, many sculptural members were recovered, mainly from statues. Room V originally had a long marble pedestal built on the back wall, which was later removed leaving only two marble cornerstones in situ, while pebble paving covered the entire surface of the room, with the exception of the pedestal area. The room appears to have been used for Imperial cult activities from the Llst Ct BC to the M 1st Ct AD. At that time the pedestal was removed and a thranos was built along the walls. An inscription testifies that this renovation was done by Flavia Mysta and her children. According to the 1st Ct AD Kalindoia Decree, sacrifices took place in the Sebasteion monthly, followed by rich symposia for citizens, both en masse and in triclinia. The rooms above were obviously the triclinia, the place for the citizens' feasting and banqueting. In Kathimerini (02/03/2007) the discovery of the marble head of a statue is reported, which belongs to the 2nd Ct AD replica of a statue depicting Meleagros, attributed to the sculptor Skopas. A votive inscription dated to 88 AD provides information on the exedra, the bouleuterion and the stoa. Portable finds include bone stylus and vessel fragments used for voting, along with a slab belonging to the cashier of the bouleuterion. Stavros. P. Adam-Veleni (ADelt, 552-53) reports on the excavation in a plot, in the area of the LHel-ERom cemetery. Nine graves were investigated: seven tile and two cist graves. The grave goods include clay vessels (fish plates, olpe, oinochoe), lead pendants, lamps (one depicting a gladiator), glass vessels, terracottas (depicting a cock, Eros and Phsyche), gold and bronze jewellery and coins. The graves date from the lstCtBCtothe lstCtAD. Nymphopetra-Rentina. In Ethnos (03/02/2007) the excavation of a Neo settlement is mentioned. In total 138 pits were investigated, some of them serving as storage pits while others belonged to semi-subterranean houses, dated between 6500-5700 BC. Among the small finds are stone chipped and ground tools, three stone pendants depicting human figures and other jewellery. In the same area part of a Rom cemetery was investigated, with 98 cist graves, fourteen pit graves and an arch-roofed grave. Byz sites Arethousa, Paliambela site. A.

Halstead (Sheffield) report on the excavation of this Neo settlement. The overall aims of the Paliambela project are to explore the emergence of the 'village' and 'household' as basic social/residential units in Neo Greece, and also to investigate the possible relationship between these two processes. Paliambela Kolindrou is an unusual Neo site, in that (like the classic but atypical site of Sesklo) it appears to comprise both a large 'flat-extended' settlement (extent as yet uncertain, but evidently to be measured in tens of hectares) and a compact 'tell1 mound of ca 2ha. The site thus offers exceptional potential for exploring the emergence of the village community. Some insight into the extent of the flat-extended part of the settlement is afforded by chance finds reported by local residents, while geoarchaeological sondages by Krahtopoulou have revealed MNeo circuit ditches beyond the tell component of the site. Five seasons of excavation on the tell component have uncovered 660m2 of ENeo, MNeo, LNeo, Final Neo and Emod. deposits, with a few traces of BA activity. MNeo and</page><page sequence="66">66 JAMES WHITLEY ET AL. LNeo arc represented by a series of circuit walls and ditches, enclosing burnt rectangular wattle and daub or pis? structures of MNeo date and more enigmatic walls and cobbled surfaces of LNeo date. ENeo deposits include a series of 'pit-dwellings'. Our focus on the changing rela tionship between 'household' and 'community' requires analysis of contextual variation in artefactual and bioarchae ological remains and this in turn presupposes an under standing of formation processes on the site. To this end, the project has devoted considerable effort to developing efficient procedures for recording contexts and sampling their contents. As a result, contextual variability has been recognized in several different classes of finds and a preliminary model of site formation processes has been developed. The summer of 2006 was devoted to study and limited excavation in two areas: in the N sector of the tell and in the C sector of the tell. During excavation in the N sector of the tell, remaining ENeo deposits were removed in the existing trenches 6 and 21, exposing two additional pits and yielding further modest quantities of bone and ceramics and a few small finds including an ENeo enotio (earring). Two narrow new trenches, opened to the E and S of the existing trenches, indicate that the ENeo pits must indeed, as previously suspected, have been dug from some form of artificial terrace cut into the natural hill slope. In each case, the inner edge of this terrace must be inside the lm w. baulks that we initially left. The S extension trench is mainly taken up with yet another deep and narrow ditch running NNW-SSE. On preliminary scanning of finds, this ditch was probably re-cut in the LNeo, but the date of its initial cutting is as yet unclear. Excavation in the C sector of the tell involved close examination of the burnt debris of the rectangular MNeo houses, uncovered in 2004, which revealed that at least one of these was overlain by the shallow stone foundations of a LNeo house. Gradual dismantling of the best-preserved burnt MNeo house revealed that its plan had been correctly identified by colour enhancement of the final excavation photographs taken in 2004. The outer walls of this house are built with clay and chaff pis? on a framework of light posts; inner partition walls appear to be even flimsier. Both inner and outer walls had fallen over in large blocks during the burnt destruction, although ploughing has damaged these blocks to varying degrees. In the SW corner of the house, a large stone mortar was embedded deeply in the floor; a clay surround may have been intended to reduce the scattering of items pounded in the mortar. Otherwise, the house floor was largely devoid of finds, suggesting abandonment before the burnt destruction. A very small sondage into the floor, however, indicated that this overlies another burnt house and, as the sondage encountered a complete vessel, this earlier house may have been abandoned more suddenly with richer floor contents. Stratigraphie and ceramic analysis of key chronological issues continued. We are increasingly confident that the ENeo 'pit-houses' in the N sector are of E ENeo date; painted decoration is absent and the shape repertoire is extremely limited (see below). These pits are cut by a narrow E-W palisade ditch (of L ENeo to initial MNeo date?), which is in turn cut by a broader N-S ditch of E MNeo date. Although both ditches contain relatively few finds, they seem to represent earlier phases than the burnt MNeo houses in the C sector or the MNeo ditch in the SE sector. These latter two areas exhibit significant differences in MNeo pottery styles, but it is too early to state whether this represents a contextual or chronological contrast. The repertoire of ceramic types is becoming much clearer and exhibits significant changes through the Neo. The E ENeo deposits have yielded a very narrow range of shapes; essentially, spherical bowls of medium size and an askos. No trace has been found of storage vessels, but a few sherds with burnt carbon deposits on the inner face imply some use of ceramics in cooking. The MNeo repertoire of shapes is much wider than that of the E ENeo and includes bowls in a variety of shapes and sizes (raising the possibility that a narrow range in the MNeo ditch in the SE sector may represent a particular context of consumption). Cooking vessels continue to be recognized only from traces of food residues rather than from distinctive shapes and fabrics. Storage vessels are absent from the excavated burnt MNeo houses, but this might be because the floor was emptied prior to the conflagration. It should also be recalled that accidentally burnt, unfired clay bins have also been found in mixed MNeo/LNeo levels. Change is dramatic in the LNeo repertoire. Table ware includes open 'family sized' bowls and dishes and also similar but smaller vessels that might have been for individual use; these vessels expose their contents more ostentatiously than their more closed MNeo counterparts, suggesting greater emphasis on sharing or hospitality (Fig. 79). 'Drinking sets', comprising amphorae, small jugs and a variety of cups, are also found for the first time, while vessels coated with birch bark tar may indicate provision for storage of valued drinks. Cooking pots are now readily recognized for the first time and include a range of open and closed pots, with and without feet, and also flat baking trays apparently used (from residue analyses) for plant-based foods; this diversity of forms implies a range of ways of preparing food. 'Imports' (on the basis of visual inspection only, so far) also exhibit temporal change: these seem mostly Thessalian in the MNeo, whereas C Macedonian types are also well represented in the LNeo. Study in 2006 also focused on material from the burnt MNeo houses in the C sector. Identifiable impressions included cut beams (probably wedge-split), round wood of both broad ('beam') and narrow diameter ('wattle'), and rare examples of stone cobbles and perhaps reeds. Tempering material was most commonly chopped straw. A few specimens exhibited more than one external surface or impressions of two layers of wooden framework (light wands at right angles to heavier beams). K. Kotsakis, M. Katsianis and Sp. Tsipidis (AEMTH 19 [2005], 309-16) present the digital documentation of the archaeological record using GIS, which aims to systematically manage, visualize and analyze the available archaeological material (see also AR 52 [2005-2006], 91).

In plot 951, a total of 74 graves was investigated; mostly pit graves, seven tile graves and ajar burial. In addition, the investigation of parts of ditches and a tunnel (/. 25m) indicate their fortification character. In plot 587, part of the Hel cemetery was located. M. Pappa (ADelt, 562) notes the excavation on the SW borders of the LNeo settlement and W of the beach. A large pit (di. 11m, d. 6.50m) was investigated, containing pottery, small finds, shells, animal and human bones, as well as fragments of clay structure. The pit is dated to the E LNeo (Makrygialos I phase). To the N of the pit, part of the system of ditches of the Makrygialos I settlement was found. Limited research located a crossing point of two ditches suggesting a complex system of bordering the settlement. Alikes Kitrous. M. Besios (ADelt, 562-63) reports on the rescue excavation in a plot where three graves were investi gated. In a monumental cist grave traces of the wooden kline with parts of its decoration (glass plaques and leaves) were found. The second cist grave contained a funeral pyre accompanied by iron spearheads. A large pit grave had a wooden sarcophagus accompanied by clay vessels, a glass kalyx and bronze jewellery. All three graves date to the 2 half ofthe4thCtBC. Louloudia Kitrous. M. Pappa (ADelt, 566-67) reports the discovery of a LNeo/EBA marble figurine, remarkably similar to some ECyc examples (Fig. 80). Dion. D. Pandermalis (AEMTH 19 [2005], 374-79) reports on further excavations in the anc. city (see also AR 52 [2005 2006], 92). In the Sanctuary of Asklepios a system of walls dating to Hel and Rom Imperial times was investigated, without discerning their use. In the Hydraulis sector two oblong rooms were investigated, dating to the 2nd-3rd Ct AD, as well as the succession of the related stoa and the stylobate. In the NE corner of the anc. agora part of the bath complex (caldarium) was investigated. In the NW corner of the anc. agora, the succession of a pipe for draining the water from the public hall was revealed, along with a large oblong room with an opening to the stoa. During the enhancement works of the anc. wall of the city, sculptures and architectural members came to light, used as building material: the lower part of a Zeus statue that was an offering of the priest Postoumios, the lower part of a large marble eagle, a relief depicting Zeus, a head of Hephaistos with his characteristic conical pilos, a hoard of bronze coins, architectural members of buildings from various periods and inscriptions. Noteworthy is the large marble Hel head with elaborate hairstyle attributed as Dionysos, as well as a female head with eccentric hairstyle and a laurel wreath, dated to Imperial times. Finally, inscribed slabs and reliefs 80. Louloudia Kitrous: LNeo/EBA marble figurine were used to cover ECh graves (e.g., a large Latin inscription referring to the Imperial house of Rome and the patron gods, Zeus, Nike and Mars, as well as a relief depicting the hero rider Kandylidas with the snake).

The statue, dated to the 2nd Ct BC, shows similarities in material, size, typology and style to the statue of Zeus Hypsistos (see also AR 51 [2004-2005], 77), leading to the hypothesis that the two statues were placed together in a temple. Furthermmore, near the Dionysus villa, a house with a four-columned atrium was explored, while in the extension of the W street a small bath was located, with a mosaic floor and two basins with colourful marble pieces and reliefs from the Sanctuary of Asklepios, as well as the inscription AIKAHTN? 2QTHPEI.

Klaga (AEMTH 19 [2005], 239-48) report on the rescue excavation in plots on the borders of the E cemetery of the anc. settlement. Fifteen pit graves, dated to LGeo and EAr times, contained inhumations with a few clay vessels, iron daggers and bronze jewellery. To the first half of the 4th Ct BC belongs a mound with eleven graves: four pit graves, four tile graves and three cremations in pointed amphorae. Child and juvenile burials were accompanied by miniature vessels (kyathoi, skyphoi, phialae, pyxis), terracottas, jewellery, bone astragali, shells and coinage (noteworthy is a bronze coin of the Dikaiopolitai). In another plot 163 burials were investigated: six stone and three clay sarcophagi, eight cist graves, ten jar burials, two funeral pyres and 98 pit graves, all dated from the EIA to the 4th Ct AD. To the LAr-ECl period belong sarcophagi, funeral pyres and some pit graves. The offerings (Fig. 81) included clay vessels (local Chalkidician pottery, Attic bf vessels of the Megaira and Aimon painters, rf vessels of the Bowdoin and Sabouroff painters, Cor pottery), terracottas, gold, silver and bronze jewellery, remains of an egg shell (probably goose) decorated with black bands. Also to the LAr-ECl period belongs the 'burial of an athlete' which was accompanied by a bronze strigil, an iron disc and two lead dumb-bells.

Part of the room of a house with an oblong hearth was investigated, yielding everyday vessels, two pointed amphorae, small black glazed vessels and loomweights, all dated to the 4th Ct BC. NE of this house four rooms of another house were explored, two of them having a hearth. The finds in the latter house were similar to those found in the former house. Bronze Athytos coins date the latter house to the 1st half of the 4th Ct BC. In addition, remains of a farming or workshop installation were investigated in the coastal area. These include a circular paved area, three rooms and a channel. Finds include sherds from pointed amphorae, unpainted and black glazed vessels. Finally, in a plot on the N border of the anc. cemetery, eight graves were investigated: a stone sarcophagus, five pit graves and two cist graves. Among the grave goods are Cor aryballoi, a Cor kotyle, a kalyx from Chios, an Ionian kylix, Cor exaleiptra and black glazed skyphoi. The finds date the graves to the 3rd quarter of the 6th and the 1st quarter of the 5th Ct BC. Kallithea cave. G. Tsokas, P. Tsourlos, M. Vaxevanopoulos, F. Georgiadis (AEMTH 19 [2005], 279-92) present the geophysical research conducted by the Geology Department of AUTH and the Ephorate of Palaeoanthropology and Speleology of N Greece. The aim was to investigate the succession of the stoa in the W end of the cave-sanctuary of Dionysos and the Nymphs. The results show that the artificial stoa lead to the slope of the hill, a few meters E of the entrance of the cave and was probably used for managing the water of the sanctuary. Kallithea, sanctuary of Ammon Zeus. E. Tsigarida and S.

The caldarium, the tepidarium, part of the frigidarium and auxiliary rooms were investigated. Coinage dates the bath from the M2nd Ct BC to the L4th Ct BC. The dimensions and the characteris tics of the bath, as well as its public character in the sanctuary support its interpretation as balaneion. Kassandra, Megali Kipsa. I.

EH deposits were investigated in trench M, layer 18, where autonomous household units with food processing structures were found. They develop gradually on the tell slopes, separated by walls which created restricted access to the houses. This phase ends with destruction by fire. MH deposits were investigated in trenches B and M, layers 17-14. The houses of this phase had many rooms and were organized along the vertical or parallel axis of the tell. The walls were thick, constructed in pise technique. In layer 16, which had a long duration, a house with three rooms and a house with more spaces were investigated. In the latter postholes of the stairs were located. In layers 15-14 two multi-spaced complexes were found. In layer 13, although the arrangement of the houses remains the same, the building material for their construction changed. Now stone and mud-bricks are used.

Trakosopoulou (ADelt, 558-61) reports on rescue excavations in the cemetery and the anc. city. In plot 119, a total of 320 graves was investigated, dating from Ar to Rom times. Apart from 29 cremations the remainder contained inhumations. The most frequent type of grave is a pit grave, but there were also 90 jar burials, some tile graves and clay larnakes with relief or painted decoration. Some of the finds are pierced skyphoi which serve for closing jar burials and clay offering tile pipes. Noteworthy is a lead katadesmos in a wealthy Cl grave. In plot 109, a Hel infant burial was excavated. In plot 12, eighteen graves were investigated: two shallow pit graves and sixteen pithoi burials. The grave goods include jewellery (bronze fibulae, beads and bracelets, gold earrings), iron knives, an oinochoe and a glass ring-shaped bead. In the area of the anc. settlement, in plot 15, a Cl private house (8.20m by 3.10m) was investigated. The W square room was revealed, while an improvised paved area surrounded the house on the N and W sides. The finds include 60 coins (among them some from Akanthos), jewellery, stamped amphora handles, loomweights and needles. A. Panti (AEMTH 19 [2005], 347-58) discusses the Ar pottery from the cemetery, attributed to N Gr workshops. The 'silvered' and SubProtoGeo amphorae, a rare amphora with double handles and the sipye are examples of painted pottery produced by the workshops of the Thermaic gulf. Unpainted burnished wares testify, however, to a different coexisting tradition in the same area. The local products of the Akanthian pottery workshops differ considerably. In some cases they imitate the products of Thasos, which are also present as imports, but the majority show clear influences from E Ionia and the islands. EASTERN MACEDONIA Nomos of Serres (28th EPCA; 12th EBA) Argilos. Z. Bonias (ADelt, 689-90) reports on the excavations in the S sector and the 'port sector' of the anc. city (see also AR 51 [2004-2005], 82; AR 52 [2005-2006], 95). In the S sector parts of two houses were explored. In house B, room B2 was investigated, where a hearth, a basin and the base of a pithos where found, indicating food processing activities. In house E, which had three rooms, floors dated to the L6th-E5th Ct BC where investigated. In the second sector a trial trench revealed a floor with postholes, paved with pebbles, which yielded Cyc pottery of the 2nd half of the 7th Ct BC. J. Perreault and Z. Bonias (AEMTH 19 [2005] 81-87) report on the last season of the excavation in the above-mentioned sectors. In the S sector part of the central paved road to the W was investigated, while new trenches S of the road revealed remains of walls and floors dated to the 6th and 5th Cts BC, suggesting a densely inhabited area. In the area of the harbour a floor dated to the 2nd quarter of the 6th Ct BC was investi gated, where a small pottery kiln has been recovered. Sykia Lakkou, Nea Kerdyllia. D. Malamidou and A. Salonikios (AEMTH 19 [2005] 89-96) report on a rescue excavation in a plot ESE of Argilos hill. The area was believed to have been outside the limits of the city of Argilos. Parts of three parallel large oblong buildings separated by two stone paved streets have been uncovered. The middle building, which is also the most fully investigated (/. 19.3m, w. 18.7m), seems to be a house with courtyard having pastas, an andron, a kapnodoke with loutron and oikos, bedrooms, as well as a room that served as a workshop or a shop. The portable finds (pottery and coins) date the buildings to the M5th Ct BC and suggest abandonment in the 1st half of the 4th Ct BC. This new evidence supports the hypothesis that the anc. city of Argilos expanded to the SE in the 5th Ct BC, with a layout of the new sector based on the Hippodamean grid system. Anc. Amphipolis. D. Malamidou (ADelt, 691-92) reports on excavations in the E cemetery. In the Ali Pasas area two tile roofed graves with child burials were found without offerings. To the E of the mod. village ten Hel and Rom graves were explored: three tile roofed graves, four pit graves and three cist graves. Among the offerings are a bronze mirror, clay perfume vessels, a black glaze lekythos of the Talcott type and a rf lekythion with an anthemion, part of a 'West slope' pyxis, glassware fragments and a Rom bronze coin. S of these graves part of Rom building was investigated. In another plot (ADelt, 695), E of the acropolis, three Rom graves were explored: one cist grave and two roof tiled graves, yielding bronze coins, a glass vessel, an iron strigil and a trefoil-lipped oinochoe. SE of the graves a small part of a Rom building was unearthed. D. Malamidou and P. Malama (ADelt, 692-94, see also AR 48 [2001-2002], 82-83) report that in the area of the Macedonian tomb A (sector B) 219 graves were investigated. They include inhumations in pit, tile roofed, cist and chamber graves, cremations in pit graves or urns, dated from the 5th to the 2th Ct BC. Some horse burials were also explored. Remains of architectural structures related to grave monuments include: an oblong building (/. 5.5m), a grave monument pedestal (2.20m by 1.50m) with an assemblage of terracottas found in its base, an angular grave wall with two construction phases dated to the 4th-3rd Ct BC. In the A and C sectors part of the Rom cemetery was excavated. Thirty six burials include inhumations in cist, tile roofed graves and lead sarcophagi or</page><page sequence="70">70 JAMES WHITLEY ET AL. cremation burials, ranging in date from the 2" Ct BC to the 2n Ct AD. In sector C a stone sarcophagus and four cist graves date from the 1st Ct BC to the 1st Ct AD. E of these graves part of a LRom water tower was investigated (preserved h. 2m), with anc. stone material found in secondary use. In sector A pits dug into the bedrock were revealed, containing cremations accompanied by Hel terracottas and coins. The area is interpreted as a place of worship, possibly an open air rural sanctuary. H. Zografou, Ethnos (03/03/2007), reports on the investiga tion of a double-chambered vaulted Macedonian tomb looted already in Rom times. Inside the tomb two stone sarcophagi were found, while the portable finds include a vessel lid depicting Cupid embracing Phyche, iron small finds (keys, strigils, spearheads), bronze and stone artefacts, gold sheets, leaves, acorns and a pair of child earrings with lion heads.

A total of fifteen graves were investigated; six cist graves and nine cairn graves. The predominant mode of burial is inhumation, with the exception of one cremation, while the orientation of the bodies is determined by sex. The graves are clustered in parallel rows, one of which is adjacent to a stone enclosure. The grave goods include bronze jewellery (types known mainly from central Macedonia and the Balkans; Fig. 83), handmade and wheelmade clay vessels (Fig. 84; pithoi, amphorae, kantharoi, kylikes, cups, prochoi and skyphoi, many of them decorated with painted lines and bands).

Various pits were investigated, among them a large circular pit (di. 1.70m, d. 1.65m) filled with thick layers of ash and charcoal, containing animal bones, a boar terracotta, loomweights, along with pottery sherds dated to the L6th-E5th Ct BC. Worth mentioning are the Geo kylikes and the coarse white fabric lekanai, deriving from the Ar Thasian pottery workshop in Pharo. The pits are interpreted as 'megara' of a thesmophoreion. Next to this area parts of stone walls are preserved, dated to Hel and Rom times (3rd Ct BC-lst Ct AD). In another plot in Neos Skopos, in the area of the anc. cemetery (see also AR 51 [2005-2006], 94), a total of 38 graves were investigated. Twenty eight graves belong to the 3r Ct AD, and ten pit graves to the L3rd-E2nd Ct BC. The latter yielded gold and silver jewellery (gold wreaths with oak leaves, bands with olive leaves, stomia, earrings, pendants with semi precious stones, a diadem with a bust of Artemis), clay vessels, lamps, terracottas, lead and clay pyxides, an iron strigil, iron spearheads, bronze mirrors and bronze coins. One child burial contained ten terracottas, three clay pyxides, two perfume cruets and a skyphidion. M.

In the entrance, two niches were located, where Neo pottery and animal residues were collected. On the left side of the gorge in another niche a wall associated with 2nd Ct AD finds was revealed. To the E of the latter and 5m above ground level, an arched worship niche was investi gated, access to which was provided by a staircase carved in the rock. In its interior a semi-circular pedestal was found with five carvings for placing sculptures, which were found fragmented and scattered on the ground. Pottery and coins date the niche to the 2nd Ct AD. At the base of the stairs there is a natural carving where a three stepped exedra was revealed. Part of an inscribed marble base dedicated to Apollo, part of a bust of Apollo and a headless statuette of Pan (Fig. 86) were uncovered. Other finds include tableware and cooking pots, animal bones, iron knives and many bronze coins. The site appears to be an important cave sanctuary dedicated to Apollo, the Nymphs and Pan, dated to the 2nd Ct BC and destroyed probably by Chs in the 4th Ct AD, as implied by the thick destruction layer.

The NE wing hosts the reception, dining and residence halls, along with a triclinium. On the SE side of the house storage and workshop areas were identified, along with open and semi-open areas for agricultural and domestic activities. Two small ovoid shaped pottery kilns found in a yard, along with two pits for the preparation of clay testify to the existence of a pottery workshop in this area. Portable finds include everyday clay vessels, loomweights, oil lamps, glass vessels and metal artefacts. Spring of Angitis cave. K. Trandalidou, V. Skarkaki, E. Kara and M.

Groups practising transhumant pastoralism used a rock shelter with two small flat areas (ca 10m by 12m) situated on the left bank of the river Angitis. Four circular hearths, two on each level, were found, all constructed of rough stones. Ash and charcoal were retrieved from all the hearths along with pottery (open-shaped vessels for preparing, consuming and storing food, jars, monochrome sherds with plastic or incised decoration, graphite painted ware), animal bones, spindle-whorls, chipped and polished stone tools and bone tools, as well as jewellery made of seashells and a canine tooth. A detailed report on the archaeozoological data is cited. Nomos of Kavala (18th EPCA; 12th EBA) Nea Karvali (anc. Akontisma). M. Nikolaidou and I. Patera (AEMTH 19 [2005], 25-34) report on further investigations of the fortifying wall situated on top of the hill E of Nea Karvali (see also AR 52 [2005-2006], 95). The site is identified as anc. Akontisma, mentioned in Rom literary sources as a station on the Via Egnatia, 9 miles E of anc. Neapolis (mod. Kavala). Part of the anc. wall (W side: /. 53.5m, w. 2.20m, h. 2.50 m; S side: /. 13.10m, h. 2m) along with four square towers that protected its N and S gates were investigated. According to the portable finds, mainly fragments of Thasian pointed amphorae and bronze coins of Kassander (319-297 BC), the construction of the wall dates back to the 4th Ct BC. Kassander apparently fortified this rise in order to control the anc. road that pre-dated Via Egnatia. The wall has undergone various interventions, mainly in the Byz period and in the E20th Ct, during World War I. In a fortified coastal settlement interpreted as a Thasian commercial station, which is situated on the hill W of Nea Karvali, part of the S fortifying wall, re-used later as the wall of a large warehouse, has been investigated. Pottery (mainly cooking and storage vessels, but also Thasian transport amphorae, Ionian and Attic vessels) dates from the L6th to the M4th Ct BC. Kargany. P. Malama (ADelt, 681-82) reports on the rescue excavation in a plot where parts of a building (/. 21m, w. 7m, h. 0.60m), interpreted as a storage area, were unearthed.

In one part of the plot a square building (/. 18m, w. 9m) with water supply conduits, a semi-circular cistern and part of a paved road (/. 20m, w. 3-5m) were unearthed. In another part of the plot the foundations of houses with paved courtyards and alleys were found. Most of the finds date to the 16th Ct AD. A Rom headless bust of a male figure attributed to Dionysus and a few pottery sherds comprised a small group of finds belonging to anc. times. Ofrynio, Kalamoudia. D.

Nikolaidou-Patera in Ethnos (01/03/2007) reports on the excavation of 50 graves dated from Neo to Rom times. Four Neo pit graves contained inhumations in the crouched position. In a marble Hel cist grave (2nd Ct BC) the burial of a young girl was found, accompanied by rich jewellery and cosmetic items (a gold necklace, two gold diadems, gold earrings and a ring and an elaborate bronze mirror depicting Nereis sitting on the back of a sea dragon). Another grave of the same period contained a marble cist with charred bones along with a perfume vessel and a lamp, as well as five intact clay pyxides and five perfume vessels. Samuel Provost (Nancy, EFA) and M. Nikolaidou-Patera (18th Ephoria) report on survey conducted in the area of Philippoi, which is part of the collaborative programme for the study of the plain of Philippi. Being concerned, primarily, with the study of anc. farming around the city of Philippi, work was concentrated on the following: a GPS survey of all known archaeological (or supposedly archaeological) structures, as well as of all of the topographic coordinate points; coring and collecting of geological samples to determine the extent of the swamp around the city and the palaeogeography of the streams (Zigakis and Gangites); surface surveys and trial trenches to identify anc. traces observed in aerial photographs: the removal of land for the fortifications of the Battle of Philippi, the Via Egnatia and the division of the land (to the SE of the city). Our initial results have demonstrated the utility of the method in the palaeo-geographical investigation of the three investigated sectors. In the sector of the Kiemer arch the literary sources (Appian) locate the republican fortifications of the battle of 42 BC. This was confirmed by the first archae ological investigations undertaken by Heuzey and Collart. The fortification line was preserved within the organization of the Rom colonial territory, perhaps to create a visible pomerium. Although nowadays there are no fortification remains on the surface the fortification line leading up to the Kiemer arch could be still traced on aerial photographs. A series of trenches opened along the anc. traces of the fortifications give an insight into the anc. topography of the area.</page><page sequence="73">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2006-2007 73 In the sector of the Gate of the Swamp the topographical organization of the anc. city of Philippi, the manner of commu nication with the out-of-town zone (and more generally the colonial territory) largely depended on the extent of the swamp and on its possible variation during historic times. Prospection indicated that the relationship between the swamp and the city varied through time depending on the alluvial formations of the river of Kephalari. Some denser probings will permit the establishment of a precise chrono-stratigraphy of these alluvial and swamp formations. The observation of ceramic material on the surface confirmed the importance of the Gate of the Swamp in the MByz period, when it acted as an access point to the main district (still inhabited) of the anc. city, suggesting the existence of a suburb. Future geophysical prospection will help to specify the size and possibly the organ ization of the suburb. The main aim of the prospection in the sector S of the cone of Krenides was to determine the extent of the swamp and the anc. territory to the S of the city. The trenches confirmed the complexity of contact between the alluvial cone and the swamp. The fluctuations in the swamp's edges could have reached several hundred metres. The establishment of the chronology of these fluctuations would help to better understand the changing relationship between the swamp, the city and the out-of-town agricultural zone. Unlike the two previous sectors, prospecting in this area revealed little archae ological material. It also allowed us to eliminate from the study some visible traces indicated by aerial photographs, traces which were caused by contemporary operations of regional development and not by any anc. division of the land.

In O. Pavlou Mela and Demetriados parts of the wall with its square towers were investigated, along with the 'Fish Gate' and the 'Aslant Gate' with the stairs leading to the battlements. In O. 18 Oktovriou, E of the Sanctuary of Artemis Soteira, a square tower was located. To the S a corner of the wall was revealed. E of the Kalogerikon the W side of the N wall was revealed to a /. of 13m, reaching the interior of the city, while behind the Kalogerikon the wall continues up to the 'Gate of the Goddess with the chariot' (ADelt, 685). In the latter area the findings included: a female terracotta, a terracotta theatre mask, a female terracotta mould, a triangle tile, stamped Thasian amphora handles dating to the 4th Ct BC and everyday ceramic vessels. The stone finds include: a pedestal bearing the inscription ATTAAOC HPOAOTOY EPMEI0E?M?- , part of a relief with a funerary banquet scene, part of the anthemion crowning of a stele, part of a marble male statue, small marble window columns, small marble columns with their bases and capitals, and the zoomorphic leg of a table.

Arthur M?ller (Lille 3/ EFA), Francine Blonde (CNRS/EFA) and Stavroula Dadaki (12nd EBA) report on the excavation of the great ECh house located in 1971 in the Delkos plot, where three rooms of the N wing of the house were revealed and on the excavation in Valma plot, where thermal baths and a part of the S wing were revealed during 1979-1985. The 2006 season mainly aimed to complete the investigation of the E wing. By the end of the season the old excavations were connected with the new excavation. Also, we clarified a series of aspects of the plan generated in 2004. Although the existence of a peristyle still remains hypothetical we did unearth the NE corner of what must have been the internal court and therefore the S limit of the N wing. It is for the E wing, however, that we have the greatest amount of new information. The central part of the E wing is marked by a large room which must have been a triclinium (10.80m by 5.30m internal meas urements). The room overflows into the rest of the wing while encroaching on the former street. The E part of this room is formed by an apse, inserted into a rectangular masonry block. It has a large opening to the W (? 4m) toward the internal court and three windows to the N, E and S respectively. This room is edged to the S and to the N by two series of two rooms which are of more modest dimensions. Apart from this complex of five rooms, the E wing also had corner rooms which are of larger dimensions. Most of the rooms have large openings (doors) towards the court. The rooms show at least two building phases. The oldest is represented by door chocks and carefully built windows, with the most recent phase by constructions in coarse masonry without cement in order to close the doors and, in one case, to divide a large room. The stratigraphy confirms the general chronology proposed in 2004. The construction of the building dates to the L5th Ct AD. The first destruction (accompanied by the complete removal of valuable materials: marble floor and wall coating) occured around 560-570 when some rooms were roughly refitted suggesting partial re-occupation of these places. The tpq of the final destruction is AD 619. Noteworthy architectural remains include a palmette antefix (which represents the most complete copy of a series of architectural terracottas; Fig. 87), two Doric capitals and some fragments of a pebble mosaic collected in the destruction layer of the building.

Jean-Yves Marc (Strasbourg/EFA) reports on the study, restoration and cataloguing of the material found in the macellum during the 2005 excavations. We have begun to analyse only some categories of objects. Very rich wall decoration in opus sectile on all the walls of the macellum, the walls of the fa?ade of the rooms which edged the court and those of the two monumental entries were the subject of a detailed study. Primary analysis has allowed for the iden tification of several decorative elements, in particular the appliqu? mouldings, the plinths and the pilasters or the capitals of pilasters. Regarding ceramics and terracotta lamps, priority was given to the material discovered in the old and well-known layers. It seems that the lowest layers contained pottery older than the date first proposed for the original phase of the macellum (i.e., the 1st half of the 3rd Ct BC) suggesting an older phase which preceded the Hel building. The objects of animal origin have been counted. Even though they form a small assemblage (72 objects), this material has been the source of interesting information, in both chronological and technolog ical terms, which supports the hypothesis that this district had some artisan or craft function in the latest phases of the occupation (ca 3rd-5th Ct). The rampart. Yves Grandjean and Manuela Wurch-Kozelj (EFA) report on the study in two areas. In the Maritime Gate sector, a study of a group of more than 160 blocks allowed us to recover two notable rectangular pillars of a door of the tower, the frame of a gunloop-type window for catapults or ballista, the corner blocks, as well as several perpends. One of these blocks bears an inscription which relates to the construction of the entire defensive works. We continued the re-reading of the marks of quarrymen or entrepreneurs in the plain. More than 80 marks have been read. The study of the description of the rampart and the analysis of the stratigraphical data is complete.

The grave gave the impression of a stone sarcophagus, with its perfectly bonded sides and a single-piece of stone cover. A piece of an iron strigil was the only grave good found. Byz Abdera, Polystylo. S. Dadaki (ADelt, 723-24) reports on the clearings that were carried out at the archaeological site. The fortified enclosure, as well as the transverse wall that divides the town into upper and lower, became visible. Nomos of Rhodope (19th EPCA) Maroneia, Ag. Haralambos. N. Kokkotaki (ADelt, 711-12) reports on the excavation of a monumental building (/. 46m). In the centre of the building three square pillars were found with two corresponding buttresses on the N wall, while on the S wall two triangular light openings were preserved. To the N of this building another similar structure was partially investi gated. The two buildings probably belonged to the same complex. To the N of this complex a paved area with an underground drainage pipe was located, possibly part of the road that led from the propylon to the agora. The disturbed deposits yielded finds suggesting the use of space from Rom to Byz times. Worth mentioning is the 2nd Ct AD marble torso of a Satyr (Fig. 88). 88.

Vaxevanopoulos and G. Lazarides (AEMTH 19 [2005], 1-11), in a collaboration between the 19th EPCA, the Northern Greece Ephorate of Palaeoanthropology and Speleology and Aristotle University of Thessaloniki (School of Geology), report on the study of the neogene mammalian remains unearthed during works on the occasion of the construction of the road which links the area with the Egnatia highway. About 45 fossil fragments found scattered in sandy sediments were derived from PH mammals and wood remains. Four upper tusk fragments, two lower molars and bone fragments of proboscideans can be attributed to the mastodont Choerolophodon pentelici; four teeth, two astragali, tibia and bone fragments of small-sized horses belong to Hipparion cf. macedonicum and a mandible fragment of a medium-sized bovid to cf. Tragoportax. This material, not common in this area of Greece, can indicate an age of LMiocene. Mesimvria, Zone. P. Tsatsopoulou (ADelt, 713) reports on excavations in two areas in the anc. city. Parts of two roads were unearthed, along with part of the infrastructure of an unidentifiable large building. Portable finds (pottery and coins) date the area to the 5th-4th Ct BC.

SAMOTHRACE Samothrace. O. Pallagia in Ta Nea (05/03/2007) and Ethnos (06/03/2007) argues that the famous statue of the Nike of Samothrace was a Rom offering to the Sanctuary of the Great Gods after their victory against the Macedonian king Perseus. She also suggests a date 166-156 BC instead of 190-180 BC. Sanctuary of the Great Gods. James R. McCredie (New York/ASCSA) reports on the 2006 study season. Work continued on the documentation of material on the E hill for publication as volume 9, The Monuments of the Eastern Hill, in the series, Samothrace. Excavations Conducted by the Institute of Fine Arts of New York University. A draft of the chapters on the description and reconstruction of the monuments was completed. Finishing details were added to the block drawings and the restored plans and elevations documenting the monuments and architectural development of the E hill. Additional drawings comparing the profiles of triglyphs and Doric geison blocks from buildings within the sanctuary were completed. The lamps to be included in the publication were selected, examined, catalogued, drawn and inked. Work continued under the direction of Laura Gadbery on the catalogue of coins from the E hill. Conservation to protect the surface of the inscribed epistyle blocks from the Dedication of Philip III and Alexander IV was continued. Work continued on documenting the architectural blocks associated with the Milesian Dedication on the W hill. A database was created for all the marble blocks found on the W hill and those recovered by the Gr Archaeological Service from the central ravine. Key blocks belonging to the monument, including column drums, wall, epistyle, threshold and geison blocks, were drawn. NORTHEAST AEGEAN ISLANDS (20th EPCA; 14th/3rd EBA) Lemnos (14th EBA) Myrina. L. Acheilara (ADelt, 763-66) reports that at Tourkikos Gialos, O. Moschidi 13 (Vafea plot) part of a Rom bath complex with two building phases was revealed. In the S area of the plot, part of the hypocaust was found, with a system of two pipes, walls, parts of six floors and a marble-lined octagonal tank to its N. In a later phase, a small well was opened in the floor of the tank and an exterior circular buttress wall was added. Finds include coarse and terra sigillata pottery, fragments of tiles and glass objects and four damaged bronze coins. At Kentriki Agora, O. Kyda (Vamvoukou plot, former Choleva plot) part of a Rom building with two rooms was investigated (see ADelt 52, 911). Finds include an oinochoe, a clay bird figurine, a marble tool and a Rom lamp. At Androni, O. Varnali (Tsaptsinou plot) building remains dating to the EBA (Blue Poliochni phase) came to light. From a surface level came finds dating to the Green Poliochni phase, while in the W sector of the plot the habitation area was back filled with stone piles and sherds dating to the Black Poliochni phase. In the N sector of the plot part of a room with three successive floors was uncovered. In the SE part of the plot a wall of a circular building was found (interior di. 6.10m). In the W area of the plot nine circular structures came to light (di. ca 2m), which must have been used for storage. In the central area of the plot three aligned circular structures were excavated at different depths; they may have served as wine or olive oil production facilities. Finds from the excavation of the plot include fragments of Final Neo female seated figurines, stone and flint tools, pottery, a clay hook and a crucible. At O. Karatza (Papadopoulou-Apostolopoulou plot) parts of two parallel walls were uncovered; finds include Rom pottery and three bronze coins. Koukonisi. L. Acheilara (ADelt, 765) reports on investigations at the SW area of the islet, where a complex of walls from successive periods and a cobbled area were excavated. Part of a cobbled area defined by a retaining wall came to light in the E part of the trench, and also an earlier wall. In the W area of the trench a room defined by three walls was revealed, contem porary to the cobbled area. In the SW area of the trench a floor was found, which sealed a destruction layer consisting of fallen stones and traces of fire, dated by sherds to the SubMyc and Geo periods. Under the destruction layer a wall was found. The excavation finds include numerous sea shells, vases, a stone vase, obsidian and flint tools. C. Boulotis (ADelt, 766) reports on investigations aimed at the clarification of building phases of the MBA. Finds include architectural elements, pottery (including large pithoi), clay spindle-whorls, bone, stone and obsidian tools. Hephaestia. E. Greco (Director, SAIA) reports on the exploration of the area of the walls of the isthmus with the collaboration of E. Fouache (Paris XlII/Cr?teil) and the excavation of the L antique house under the direction of E. Papi (Siena). The mission continued the exploration of the area of the walls of the isthmus. E. Fouache contributed to the project with his knowledge of the geomorphology of the site and excavated two small trenches behind the Ar wall and at its base, between the upper parts of the LH walls and the virgin soil. A series of trenches was excavated to the N of the Ar wall, as well as between this structure and the surrounding later circuit walls. It has been possible to investigate a new segment of the Ar wall to verify once more that it overlaps with the summits of the walls of the LH settlement. We also explored a further section of the fill between the Ar wall and a wall of a later period. To the S, at the base of the Hel tower, where in 2005 we discovered a small wall made of small stones and the upper part of a wall built in regular blocks of poros, we investigated the remains of a new telesterion similar to the ones unearthed by L. Beschi at the foot of the Klas mountain and, more recently, by A. Archontidou below the theatre. Of this new building only the upper parts of the walls have been explored, together with the remains of typical stone benches. A violent event, perhaps an earthquake or a landslide, caused a fracture in the soil and the consequent loss of most of the S part of the monument.</page><page sequence="77">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2006-2007 77 Excavations have provided us with an understanding of all the characteristics of the L antique house, the building phases and the functions of the rooms. In four trenches all the layers have been dug down to the bedrock to identify the building phases and the occupation phases of this part of the housing block. All the excavated layers have been sampled (in particular, some vases recovered in situ have been sampled in order to identify their content through DNA analyses). All the excavated structures (foundations, walls, thresholds, etc) have been investigated in order to reconstruct building techniques and building typology, assess the materials used and investigate the technologies employed in the different phases of occupation. We have drawn in detail the tiles and the re-used architectural elements (i.e., pieces which were originally produced for other functions such as marbles, millstones, etc). The structures of the last building phase of the 4th-7th Ct AD have also been investigated in order to prepare a virtual 3D reconstruction. A particular study, typological and archaeometric, has been devoted to the amphorae of the Rom and Byz periods. A detailed topographical map of the whole promontory and the site (for ca 80 ha) was completed. We continued the magnetometer survey in an area of 47,600m2 to the S of the theatre and to the W of the residential area, which was dug by Adriani, in order to integrate the zones already investigated in previous years. Byz Lemnos Myrina, Fortress. A.-C. Loupou (ADelt, 111) reports on the restoration of the NW enclosure of the fortress. She also reports (ADelt, 779) on the recording of the majority of the postByz churches of the island. Ayios Efstratios. A. Dellaporta and Th. Demetriadou (EMA) report (ADelt, 1030-31) on the handing over of a further dolium pithos from the known shipwreck off this island. Agios Efstratios. A.-C. Loupou (ADelt, 779) reports on the declaration of Agios Basileios church, dated to 1527. It bears the peculiarity of lacking an apse and being the only monument to survive the earthquake of 1968. Lesbos (14th EBA) Mytilene (anc. city). L. Acheilara (ADelt, 736-62) reports on excavations conducted during works of the State Service for Sewage and Drainage. At Gipedo or Tarlas, O. Vostani, 103 Hel and Rom tombs were excavated, of which 28 were cist tombs, seven loculi, two sarcophagi, 24 plain burials, seven enchytrismoi and five shaft graves covered with fragments of tiles and large vases. Most were inhumations, while eight were cremations; in one of the loculi, the urn, a hydria, was found. Burial goods include clay and glass bulbous ung?entar?a, bronze vases and other bronze and gold objects. At Gipedo or Tarlas, O. Skamandriou, two damaged tile graves and one enchytrismos in an amphora came to light. At Chrysomallousa, O. Myrogianni and Varnali, a structure which included a large stone drain and a clay pipe was uncovered, dated by a few sherds to the Hel and Rom periods. At Foros, O. Venizelou and Moura, 27 Hel and Rom cist tombs within a rectangular enclosure were uncovered. Burial goods include mainly ung?entar?a, other clay vases, figurines, bronze coins and mirrors. At Kioski, O. Mikras Asias, more rooms of a Rom building, first investigated in 1993 (see ADelt 48, 415), were uncovered. Walls, two floors laid with pink plaster and one damaged mosaic floor were investigated, and also the continuation of a tunnel, which dates to a later period. At O. Ermou, at the section from O. Agiou Therapontos to O. Alkaiou, a system of a main, covered, stone drain and smaller auxiliary stone and clay pipes of the Ot period was found. The floor of the drain constitutes the Hel-Rom floor of the 'quay', which included in its substructure a built drain. Part of a wall was uncovered in the E side of the trench. At O. Alkaiou, an apsidal Ot drain and a few Hel vases were found. At O. Ermou, at the section from O. Alkaiou to O. Saphfous, wall foundations and part of the central sewage system of the Ot period were uncovered, as well as a few Hel vases. At O. Ermou, at the section from O. Saphfous to O. Voutsika, a large marble block with incised marks was found, presumably a kind of map. Part of a Rom building was excavated, which consists of four areas, with one floor made of grey marble polished stones, two mosaic floors with parts of inscriptions and other lime plastered floors. At O. Ermou, at the section from O. Voutsika to O. Pittakou, part of the anc. quay, the W border of the S trireme port of the anc. town, was uncovered. Four block layers and built buttresses were found. Two building phases, one Rom and the other earlier (after the 5th Ct BC), can be distinguished. At the E side of the uncovered part of the quay seven wooden poles were found, apparently used to reinforce the foundations of the structure, while at the W, inner, side of the quay five parallel Rom walls were uncovered. At O. Ermou, at the section from O. Dikeli to O. Adramyttiou (Yeni Tzami), another part of the central rectangular sewage drain of the Ot period was uncovered. A LRom building was excavated, with abundant architectural elements from the upper part of a Rom Ionian building, and also a LRom wall. At the junction of O. Ermou and Symandiri the lower part of the structure from one of the bridges over the Euripos river was found, made from blocks of local red limestone. To the E of this structure, the W fa?ade of a wall was uncovered, which presumably served as a watershed. Between the bridge structure and the wall three large pits were found, which may indicate the position of poles for boat mooring. Also at O. Ermou, under structures of the Ot period, a plethora of archi tectural elements from Gr and Rom buildings came to light. At O. Ermou, at the section from the junction with O. Dikeli to O. Naymachias Ellis, stone drains, two wells, walls and tombs from the Ot period were found. At O. Ermou, at the section from O. Nikomideias to O. Naymachias Ellis, part of a Rom building with slabbed floor came to light. Under the floor a wall was found, built of large worked blocks, which probably defined the E shore of the Eyripos river. At Epano Skala, O. Lesvonaktos, part of a Hel stoa came to light. The plan of the stoa is not clear; two rooms are preserved to the N, and also one of the pillars from the interior colonnade, a low wall to the S and the base of the stylobates of the exterior colonnade. The stoa was uncovered to a /. of 7.80m and to a w. of 20.50m. In the S part of the trench part of an Ar cemetery was excavated, immediately to the S of the interior colonnade of the Hel stoa, with seventeen plain burials, one sarcophagus with burial goods (mainly pottery) and 31 enchytrismoi of adults in large pithoi and children in smaller vases, mainly amphorae. Two grave stones were found fallen in the interior of two pithoi, apparently in secondary use. In the area of the cemetery, apart from Ar pottery, many finds of the LCI and Hel periods (pottery, loomweights, 213 coins, figurines and bronze objects) testify to the subsequent expansion of the city after the cemetery went out of use. At Epano Skala, at the junction of O. Lesvonaktos and O. Naymachias Ellis, the excavation at the W part of the Hel stoa reached the bedrock. The S wall of the stoa consists of seven layers of stone blocks, the W wall measures 1.50 in h., and the</page><page sequence="78">78 JAMES WHITLEY ET AL. N wall was revealed to a h. of 1.50m, 9.30m /. and 3.60m vv. Many of the stone blocks of the N wall bear incised letters, tectonic marks: A, Tl. The pillars were revealed to a height of six rows. To the S of the W pillar a wall was found (/. 7.20m, max. vv. 2.74m, h. pr?s. 0.50m). Finds include pottery, loomweights (many with impressed scenes) and fragments of figurines. At Epano scala, O. Naymachias Ellis, at the section from O. Mikras Asias to O. Lesvonaktos, surface finds of the Ot period came to light. At the junction of O. Mikras Asias with O. Naymachias Ellis, under remains of the Ot period, a wall was uncovered, which may have been part of the city wall or the quay of the N harbour during L antiquity. Large blocks of grey stone apparently belonged to a built structure, presumably the dock, which incorporated in its structure a marble geison with plant decoration in secondary use. A life-size naked male torso (h. 0.90m) was also found. At the W side of the junction of O. Ermou and O. Naymachias Ellis harbour installations of Hel date, repaired in Rom times, were uncovered. Finds include pottery, stone architectural elements, a gravestone, part of a marble inscription, a stone lion's head, loomweights, tiles and one coin dated to 377-326 BC. At O. Krinis, at the section from O. Kydonion to O. Kioutacheias, part of a Hel house was excavated; a wall and a window opening. Along the S side of the trench the N fa?ade of a wall was uncovered, which must have functioned as part of a retaining wall for the banks of the nearby torrent. This wall is founded on earlier damaged structures. Between O. Krinis and O. Mirinis a built tunnel covered with large rectangular slabs was found. To the NE of the tunnel two rooms of a Rom house were excavated, with mosaic floors (Fig. 91). 91. Lesbos, Mytilene: Rom mosaic floor At Synoikismos, O. Kydonion, at the section from O. lliopoulou to O. Naymachias Ellis, remains of a large Rom house were revealed; four rooms and a basement area. A stone staircase led from the main entrance to the first floor of the house. The door openings, thresholds with holes for the door pivots and the floors were well preserved. The finds include stone architectural elements, ung?entar?a and figurines. Two Rom tile graves were found in the area where part of the N cemetery was located (ADelt 53, 773-74). Only one of the graves, which contained two burials, had burial goods (clay and glass bulbous ung?entar?a, two coins and a fragment of a figurine). At Synoikismos, O. Kydonion, at the section from O. Krinis to O. Iliopoulou, a retaining wall was investigated. To the NE of the wall a vertical drain and remains of a LHel-Rom bath complex were found (walls, floors, pipes, a built tank and part of the structure of the hypocaust). At Tampakaria, (Stavrianos plot), part of the N cemetery of the anc. city of Mytilene and part of the cobbled road that led through the cemetery from the city to the N komai were revealed. A Hel rectangular burial monument (11.75m by 5.92m, h. pr?s. 1.26m) was uncovered, with a burial structure in its SW corner, both founded on damaged LCI tombs. A monumental staircase (4.48m by 1.29m) was found to the SE of the burial monument and a rectangular building to the S (building B), with two areas, with three and six tombs. To the W of the burial monument tombs of different types were inves tigated (tile tombs, cist tombs, shaft graves, cremations, plain burials, urns, enchytrismoi), with grave goods which included LCl-Hel pottery, metal and bone objects and jewellery. Two cist tombs were found to the N of the burial monument, lined with slabs covered in pink plaster. To the E of the burial monument, part of the anc. cobbled road was uncovered to a /. of 13.60m. At the S part of the plot, the central part of a Rom tank, lined with marble slabs and pink waterproof plaster, as well as a built drain, were found. Byz Mytilene. A.-C. Loupou and E. Rokos (ADelt, 111) report on the conservation of the ceramics found at the Psarelli plot, as well as the conservation of murals at several churches. A. C. Loupou (ADelt, 779, 780) reports on the clearings carried out at the fortress of the city. She also reports (ADelt, 780) on the excavation activities undertaken at the courtyard of Yeni mosque, dated to the 19th Ct. 73rd national road Mytilene-Thermi. At the Mavrovouni (Kara-Tepes) area, during works for the expansion and improvement of the national road, opposite the 'ENA A.E.' buildings, part of the anc. cobbled road was uncovered, among the tombs of the N cemetery of Mytilene. An oros, a plain column drum and an inscribed tombstone (CAMATPOYXAIPE) were found in secondary use. The road was repaired at a later period. The finds consist of a few sherds and a Lesbian coin of the 2nd Ct AD. At the junction of the national road with the road to Moria four tombs were excavated, three rock-cut and one cist stone-built. The tombs contained cremations and very few burial goods. To the E of the tombs another part of the anc. road was uncovered, 58m /. and 2.90m w. Opposite the buildings of EYP seven tombs of the N cemetery of Mytilene were investigated, most of them looted, with only some golden wreath leaves and fragments of iron strigils preserved. Gera. At Perama, area of Chalatses (Vousvounis plot) excavations continued in the two sectors (A and B) E and W of wall 5 (see ADelt 49, 655; 51, 600; 52, 907-08). Continuous habitation in the area is attested from the LH IIIA1-B2 to LRom times. A Myc building was uncovered with two building phases, of which the earliest dates to the LH IIIA1-A2 period. On the ruins of the Myc house pottery workshops for amphorae were built dating to the 1st Ct BC to the 1st Ct AD. Parts of two kilns are preserved, and also part of the apothetis with wasters and a hoard of 868 coins dating to the 3rd, 2nd and 1st Cts BC. In sector A room I was investigated, where Myc and LCI to Rom sherds were found. A wall and a drain were found outside the N wall of the room and parts of another two walls were uncovered to the NE of the room. In sector B a pottery workshop and a Myc house came to light. The workshop consists of four rooms, in one of which, the NE, the kiln was found. A second kiln was</page><page sequence="79">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2006-2007 79 found to the W. The deposit of the workshop contained clay lumps, wasters and LCI to Rom pottery. The earliest phase of the area consists of walls dated to the Myc and EGeo periods. At the E side of the workshop walls were uncovered dated to the EGeo-Ar and LCI-Rom periods, and also two rectangular built cists made of marble and schist slabs. One trefoil jug contained a hoard of 860 bronze and silver coins from Mytilene, of which the earliest date to 350-300 BC and the latest to the 2nd-1st Ct BC. Other finds include pottery, loomweights, a type Psi figurine and the head of a male figurine. Eresos. At Skala (Achliopta plot) part of a LHel-Rom building was uncovered; a room and a later expansion or repair of the main area. Finds include Hel to postByz pottery and Ar pottery from the lower levels, and also the upper part of a tombstone with a relief scene of a standing male figure and a Hermes stele.

To the later belong two LRom built drains. To the earlier belong two covered built drains and two walls. At Agios Thomas, O. Zois kai Theodoras Aytokratoron (N. and G. Delliou plots) part of a LHel building was uncovered, as were four clay pipes and a covered built drain. Finds include mainly pottery of the 3rd-1st Ct BC, among them a fragment of skyphos with a dedicatory inscription to Aphrodite. At Agios Ioannis Theologos, O. Delagrammatika (Golemi-Chatzinikolaou plot) ten EHel to ERom tombs were excavated; one tile grave, five cist graves, one stone Sarcophagus, a burial and three loculi. Three tombs contained cremations in urns, one of which was a bronze hydria with a scene of Eros and Psyche on the handle, dating to the 2nd half of 4th Ct BC. The other two urns were a clay basin and a stone vase with lid, both dating to the Hel period. Finds include Hel pottery and bronze coins. At Vounaki, O. Pachnou 14 (N. and K. Vagianou plot) a wall dated to the 3rd quarter of the 5th Ct BC came to light. At Vounaki, O. Kaloudi-Gymnasiarchou Anastasiadi (Municipality of Chios plot) investigations continued in the N half of the plot (see ADelt 53, 762). Building remains of three successive phases define five rectangular areas, rooms 1-5. The earliest phase was ended by fire; during this phase the rectangular areas were larger. The finds, dated to the EAr to EC1 periods, include a basin, a bf kylix and a jug. The pottery from the fire destruction layer dates to the beginning of the 5th Ct BC. After the destruction, the building was repaired and smaller rooms were formed. The beginning of the 3rd phase is dated to the L5th Ct BC. The finds suggest that habitation ceased at the end of the Cl period and the area was backfilled. Two apothetes were excavated, in rooms 2 and 3, with rich pottery finds. Kato Phana. Lesley Beaumont (BSA/Sydney) reports on a programme of deep soil coring, undertaken as part of a collab orative fieldwork programme with the K' Ephorate of Prehistoric and Classical Antiquities and Yiannis Bassiakos (NCSR Demokritos).

An oblong building of the megaron type was revealed, apparently belonging to the settlement. Finds include pottery, three stone spindle-whorls and two flint arrowheads.

V Giannouli reports on the continua tion of the excavation of the 'palatial type' building (ADelt 1998, 796-78) with cleaning of its W section (walls of the per?bolos of the Ar fountain, part of the irrigation and drainage systems, the W wall of the andron, the construction phases of the retaining wall to the N of the complex). It became evident that, although the presently preserved remains belong mostly to the Hel period, it was probably during the Ar period that the building was founded, in conjunction with the Eupalineion tunnel and the Ar fountain. Rom wall-paintings discovered to the E and N of the W section of the building, in combination with a mosaic floor, testify to later (than Hel) long-term usage of this space; the discovery of a 4m. h. niche with two large columns on either side, as well as the proximity to the monumental fountain, suggest the identification with a Nymphaion. Cleaning operations between the suggested Nymphaion and the andron revealed that mosaics of the 2nd Ct BC cover walls of the 3rd Ct BC or even of the end of the 4th Ct BC. The Ar retaining wall to the N of the complex was probably built along with the fountain. A four-sided closed space (with three walls dating to the Hel period and the N wall to the Rom period), partly leaning against the Ar retaining wall, was discovered to the N of the E room of the complex and it is suggested that it might have served as a cult place for the Ephestian gods (lararium). Future excavations will hopefully clarify the nature of this complex, which occupies a central position in the anc. city of Samos. Andreadakis plot. V. Giannouli reports on the 4th and final season of excavations (ADelt 1998, 798-99), which revealed part of a Byz cemetery (ten cist graves), a stoa-type building (an architectural member, probably from its epistylion, is inscribed ANTIT7ATPOZ, after Alexander's general) dating to the LHel-ERom period, a built triple drain with at least two construction phases, a probable wine or olive press consisting of a circular structure with an opening to a 'cistern' and a well of a d. of 5.20m, all dating from the Antonine period down to the 7th Ct AD.

Televantou (ADelt, 786-87) reports that the 2nd excavation season (see ADelt B Chron 53 [1998], 789-91; AR 51 [2004-2005], 91) of this extensive LNeo settlement, located atop a plateau in the W part of the island, between Palaiopolis and Zagora, provided important evidence for at least two habitation phases. Three rooms were unearthed, one with a four-sided built structure in its SW corner, with plentiful finds such as pottery, two triton shells, leaf-shaped obsidian arrowheads, a bronze needle. Another building, measuring 10m in /. and 6m in w., with an apsidal plan, consists of two rooms and is so far unique in the Cyclades (Fig. 97). The apsidal building was founded during LNeo II, an estimate based on pattern burnished-type pottery collected under the floor and inside rock cuts. Outside the building, on the street, abundant pottery of the same period was collected, as well as the head and neck of a small marble figurine with traits obviously heralding ECyc figurines. To Vima (28/01/2007) reports on the significant finds of rock art in the Final Neo/LNeo settlement. The motifs depicted are either iconographical, even in narrative scenes, such as boats, fish, birds, hunting scenes, or schematic/symbolic, such as ring shaped and figure-of-eight motifs. The rock engravings were found on the external fa?ade and the bedrock along the circuit wall and on the floor of an area inside the settlement, to which the excavator, Ch. Televantou, assigns cult significance. The excavator believes that the engravings testify to the mixed economy of the settlement, agricultural and nautical, while the iconographical and symbolic motifs apparently constitute an advanced and widely known communication system. Similar rock engravings have also been uncovered at Plaka. Palaiopolis. Ch Televantou (ADelt, 782-86) reports that systematic excavations continued at the stoa (N. Kontoleon 's old excavations), revealing a large part of the marble krepis of this building consisting of five steps, which now reaches a length of 19,50m. A marble rectangular base, which probably served as a votive base, was found in situ. Finds include pottery, glass vessels, a fragment of a bronze lebes and an Andrian coin. The orientation of the stoa is NE-SW and it is assumed that it reaches a final /. of 53m and a w. of 15m. Ch. Televantou (ADelt, 781) reports on the progress of reor ganizing the exhibition of the Archaeological Collection of Palaiopolis, on excavations at five different sites revealing evidence of occupation from the LNeo to the EByz period (ADelt, 782-87), on the cleaning of visible antiquities in five different sites (three within the acropolis of Palaiopolis, a fourth in the area of the E cemetery and the walls, namely in Tourlos, and a fifth within the acropolis of Ypsili) (ADelt, 810? 11), on the collection of antiquities from the wider area of Palaiopolis, such as a grave stele dating around 400 BC and a 97.

The excavations testify continuous habitation on the E and S side of the hill from the 11th until the 4th Ct BC, when the large settlement became the administrative seat of the island. A Cyclopean wall protected the settlement during the DAs (EIA); outside the wall there are burial and cult buildings and structures, possibly associated with a chthonic cult. At the end of the 6th Ct BC, under the threat of the Persian invasion, a new wall was constructed, partly over the cult area. Movable finds include many weapons, a few jewels, many animal bones, coins and pottery. Syros Chalandriani (Kastri). Mariza Marthari (ASA/Ephor, 21st EPCA) reports (Ergon, 54-59) on new survey and excavation undertaken at this fortified ECyc settlement with associated cemetery, first investigated by Tsountas in 1898. Finds from the cemetery excavated by Tsountas have generally been taken to be characteristic of the Keros-Syros culture (ca 2700-2300 BC). New trenches in 2006 shed new light on the semi-circular wall, 55m /., 1.5m w. and 2m h., at the very top of the hill (from which the site takes its name) (Figs 98 and 99). Pottery from these new excavations associated with the wall dates to the L ECyc II period, and is consistent with finds from earlier investigations. The entire complex of settlement and fortification seems to have been conceived and built as a whole, in one phase. Excavations of the area between the upper (inner) and outer (lower) walls shed new light on the settlement. Finds included storage vessels (pithoi) with plastic decoration, cups with conical bases, pyxides with incised decoration, a small spherical vessel, obsidian blades, quernstones and grindstones, goat bones and mollusc shells.

Siard (Lyon/EFA) reports on the survey and excavation. The back wall of shop 4 (situated below the sanctuary of Sarapis) is about 1.30m in w. and supports the fill of the S terrace of the Sarapieion. The upper part of this wall, which had been restored in the past, had to be disassembled, rebuilt and strengthened. A large trench (trench XIV) was opened from the N to the S to cover the total width of the shop (about 6.30m) and, towards the E, up to the wall of the Sphinx Alley (about 4m). The excavation did not reveal undisturbed anc. layers, only excavation debris from after 1910. At the end of the cleaning, the lower limit of the excavation trenches appears to have been reached. Trench XIV also presented us with the opportunity to observe the foundations of the W wall of the Sphinx Alley, which demonstrate a peculiar feature: the row of foundations is discontinuous, and they do not seem to cover the total visible length of the wall of alley D. The hypothesis of a discontinuous foundation, of the type of the Hypostyle Room in Delos, where only the column bases have been found, could explain the unexpected finds of this trench. In order to verify this hypothesis we will have to open complementary trenches; the results could change the way we view the elevation of walls of alley D. 98.

Etienne (Paris I/EFA) reports on the survey and excavation. During the course of this year we achieved three goals: cleaning and investigation works on the terrace of the temples, cataloguing of blocks from the Sanctuary of Apollo, architec tural works in the zone of the altars (GD 23) and the bouleu terion (GD 21). Our investigation allowed us to understand the organization of space in front of the Great Temple. A trench was opened in front of the temple in order to study its foundations, to examine the foundation of the basis inscribed with a dedication to Ptolemy III (IG XI 4 1073) and to understand the organization of the massif situated to the W of the euthynteria of the temple. We concluded that at the centre of the massif there was a passage (steps and a ramp) giving access to the Great Temple, which had on both sides terraces for the display of important monuments. These structures are contemporary with the construction of the temple, since the marble courses (which supported a monument) were equipped with double-T sealings, identical to those of the krepis of the Temple of Apollo. We continued cataloguing the blocks of the Sanctuary of Apollo carrying on the work of Ph. Fraisse (1990-1993). Our aim was to gain a general overview of the remains, which were accumulated inside the sanctuary through the ages, to suggest new attributions for the blocks and to devise a research and management method for future archaeological research in the sanctuary. We concluded our investigation in the area surrounding altars GD 23 and GD 21 to the W of the prytaneum and the bouleuterion. We completed our study of five altars in this area: two altars with barriers (A and E); an altar with a low triglyph frieze (C); a Hel altar with a quadrangular table and pediments (D); and the hypaethral sekos to the W of the Prytaneum. These monuments belonged to the public area of Delos in the 2nd half of the 6th Ct. Finally, we carried out an architectural study of the bouleuterion (GD 21); already well dated by pottery finds to the end of the 6th Ct (R. Etienne in 100. Mykonos, Castle of Chora: icon</page><page sequence="84">84 JAMES WHITLEY ET AL. M?langes Lambrinoudakis, in press). Our study focused on the marble ceiling beams and the doors (of which we have counter threshold and fragments of Doric entablature) which were replaced in Hel times. We may now also assign to this building a fenced window sill. Heraion. H. Sarian (Sao-Paulo/EFA) reports on the excavation. The aim of this season was, firstly, to establish the relation between the 'Ar' retaining wall, at the point where it turns toward the E, and its Sbound Hel extension; secondly, to understand the relation between this Hel wall and the roughly built stairs which lead to the terrace of the Heraion. Three trenches ( 1.50m by 1.50m) were dug in sector C. The collected material confirms the existence of two entrances to the Sanctuary of Hera: an 'Ar' entrance, the more precise date of which is still to be defined, and an Hel entrance, which corresponds to a widening of the terrace of the temples towards the S, which can be dated to the moment of construction of the stairs providing access to the Heraion. Sanctuary of the Aphrodision of Stesileos. C. Durvye (EFA) reports on the 2nd excavation campaign. Research focused on oikoi 2, 3 and 4. The results of the excavation of oikos 2 are the most spectacular. Stratigraphy indicates two phases of occupation, both of which are related to craft work. In the first phase we recovered the debris of a glassware workshop (pearls, dishes, sticks and manufacturing debris; Fig. 101), along with those of a bronze workshop (fragments of oxidized moulds and bronze scrap; Fig. 102). In the second phase the floor is considerably elevated and the connection of the new level of occupation with the glassmaker's workshop is indicated by the discovery of hundreds of glass fragments, as well as by several moulds of glass bowls. This is not to say, however, that the workshop was confined to the oikos itself, as we found no trace of an oven or a hearth. The excavation of oikos 3 yielded less material. Under the very damaged remains of the Rom aqueduct we unearthed a floor at the level of the threshold of the oikos. The small quantity of material discovered does not allow us to identify the function of the building. As with the other oikoi, this floor is separated by a thick layer of an older occupation level (floor and walls), the material in which can be dated possibly to the beginning of the Hel period. Finally, the excavation of oikos 4 (under the zone occupied by the aqueduct) allowed us to reach similar conclusions: a ground level consistent with the threshold of the oikos which yielded very little material and then, under a thick layer, a previous occupation phase (floor and walls) with small amounts of material. We concentrated on the L aqueduct, a cut in which allowed us to understand, if not the chronology, at least the construction method (previously poorly understood). Paros G. Kouragios and S.

Renfrew (Chairman BSA/Cambridge) reports on the first season of renewed excavation at the site of Kavos opposite Daskalio on Keros, which has already attracted notice in the Gr press (Apogevmatini (29/12/2006) and To Vima (03/01/2007). The Associate Director was Olga Philaniotou (Gr Archaeological Service) and the Assistant Directors Neil Brodie (Cambridge) and Giorgos Gavalas (archaeologist). Archaeological work on Daskalio Kavos (on Keros island, facing the islet of Daskalio) began after extensive looting of what is now termed the 'Special Deposit'. Rescue excavations first under Professor Doumas (1963) and later under Photeini Zapheiropoulou revealed EBA structures on Dhaskalio and Kavos, and recovered material from the Special Deposit. This was followed in 1987 by an inter-university project (Athens, Ioannina, Cambridge) at the invitation of the Ephor (Mrs Zapheiropoulou), led by Professor Doumas, Professor Lila Marangou and Professor Renfrew, conducting limited excavations in the disturbed areas on Kavos, and a surface survey of the Kavos area supervised by Todd Whitelaw. These confirmed the richness of the Special Deposit, and indicated the need for further work. The final report of the 1987 investiga tions is now in press. The richness of the finds, nearly all of them very fragmentary, clearly establishes this as one of the most important sites of the Cyc EBA, dating principally to the period of the Keros-Syros culture (ECyc II). The intention of the 2006 project was to establish the nature and functions of the different areas of Dhaskalio and Kavos, and investigate the nature of the centrality of the site in the Cyclades and beyond. At the outset, the indications from the 1987 survey were explored: that there might be traces of a further Special Deposit, in the area of Kavos S, located more than 100m S of the Special Deposit - which rapidly proved to be the case. It was clear that the Kavos S area had not been disturbed by recent looting, and the excavation had the unpar alleled opportunity of investigating in situ deposits including broken pottery, fragmentary marble figurines and broken marble vessels closely resembling those which had been disturbed by looters in the main Special Deposit further N. The main focus of the 2006 excavation season therefore became the systematic investigation and recording of the Kavos S area, and more than half of the Special Deposit there was excavated to bedrock. The remainder awaits excavation in the 2007 season. Excavations and investigations were carried out also on other areas of the site, but on a more limited scale than had originally been planned. Daskalio island. The first undertaking was to extend the GPS grid for the Kavos area to the island, to provide the basis for future topographic survey there. Collections of surface materials were then undertaken by 10m squares. Consideration was given to the desirable location of future excavation 106. Keros: Daskalio viewed from Paros trenches. There are indications of major walls, already briefly investigated by Doumas, which may turn out to be fortifica tions. But the steepness of the slope makes terracing necessary, and the matter needs further investigation. Indications of recent and presumably unauthorised excavation were noted on the NW side of the island, overlooking a steep cliff to the sea (Fig. 106). These suggest that EBA walling may be preserved in places to a depth of several metres. The materials recovered were exclusively of EBA date. They did not comprise the ?lite materials so frequent in the Special Deposit. The domestic nature of the finds makes clear that this was the principal settlement of the area. Kavos S: the Special Deposit (areas B, C, D and F). At the beginning of the project the Kavos S area was partially covered by a dense scrub vegetation of Mediterranean maquis type, with gaps where the surface was so stony as to prevent root formation. The area was surveyed and divided into 10m squares. Excavation began first within the area which the 1987 survey indicated might yield ?lite materials of the kind recovered from the main Special Deposit 150m to the N. There were rich finds immediately, and the area excavated was expended in order to investigate the extent of this new Special Deposit. Throughout this area there was a superficial layer of stones, of the order of 0.15m, which might originally have formed an irregular cairn, but which could equally be the result of downwash from the steeper slopes above. These covered a dark soil, in some areas with numerous stones, among which the pottery and other broken objects were found. The bedrock had deeper fissures, which likewise contained culturally rich materials. No clear indications of walls or of other structures were found in this area, although in some squares, notably F3, there were two or three stones in line which might have been deliberately placed. Surface collection in the 10m squares to the N (G, H, J and K) indicated that the Special Deposit did not extend that far. The question arises as to whether the deposits and cultural materials in these 10m squares could have slid down from further upslope to the E. Careful examination in declivities in that slope seems to exclude that explanation, and a 5m2 trench, Gl, upslope to the NE, yielded no comparable finds. It is therefore concluded that the materials recovered were deliber ately deposited in the locations where they were found. In some cases figurine fragments and other materials were found in small discrete assemblages. It is hypothesized that these materials were brought to this area in containers, such as baskets, whose contents were systematically emptied in this location.</page><page sequence="87">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2006-2007 87 Much remains to be learnt about the practices represented by this remarkable deposit (see below). But it is clear that the breakages, the absence of structures and the absence of evident and strong patterning in the deposition of finds are not the consequence of subsequent disturbance. They are a product of the original deposition procedures as practised. Kavos S: area A. The sloping but reasonably level area of Kavos S ends at its S edge with a scarp or cliff produced by faulting, where a drop of about 3 m goes down to a narrow natural platform some 3m w. before again falling steeply to the sea. In this area, excavated as trench A, there are small caves or natural recesses in the cliff at the N. Here excavation recovered EBA artefacts, disarticulated or partially articulated human bones and also teeth. No traces of human remains were located in the Special Deposit of Kavos S in squares B,C, D and F, despite the practise of water sieving, where teeth would have been recovered (as indeed they were in trench A). Kavos S: trenches P and Q. No clear built structures were found in the Special Deposit, and indeed the whole area of Kavos S seems remarkably devoid of indications of deliberate construction. It is notable therefore that some 30m NE of the Special Deposit area, and considerably upslope, traces of rough walling were observed and excavated in trenches P and Q. The lines of stones observed were not dressed or squared in the manner observed on Dhaskalio, but were decidedly irregular. They require further investigation. Although some EBA sherds were found near them, the date of these structure remains to be established stratigraphically. Kavos: the central area: trench L. In the central area of Kavos, which lies S of the original Special Deposit and N of Kavos S, there are some indications of structures. The most notable of these is the house excavated in 1963 by Doumas close to the shore. It is constructed of small, reasonably regular stones with flat faces, generally laid horizontally. The structure thus resembles in character the walls already noted on Dhaskalio, and differs in character from the indications in trenches P and Q. Looting trenches have revealed traces of further structures in the central area, most of them of what seem rather irregular stones. Immediately to the S of the original Special Deposit, a trench, trench L, running E-W was opened to explore one of these surface indications. The depth of soil at this point did not exceed 0.25m and it is not yet possible to decide whether the wall is of EBA date or perhaps much later, and conceivably associated with the herding of animals. Water sieving and recovery. In general a 20% sample of all material recovered was subjected to water sieving, through a mesh of 3mm. All the remaining soil was dry sieved through a 7mm mesh. Smaller quantities of soil were also selected for recovery of plant remains by flotation. The water sieving exercise was particularly informative. In the first place it showed that trench recovery itself was good. But smaller pieces of various materials, including obsidian, were recovered, as well as much pottery. Several very important conclusions emerged from wet sieving the Special Deposit. In the first, place few beads and no metal objects were recovered. And secondly, no human bones or teeth were recovered from those deposits, although they were quite frequent from trench A1. And thirdly, there was no debris that could be regarded as deriving from the working of marble. There were no burials and no workshop in this location. Kavos N. Brief surface collections in 1987 in the area designated Kavos N produced slags which have already been studied by Myrto Georgakopulou. The opportunity was therefore taken during the 2006 season to explore this area more systematically, and to collect further slag samples. Much of the sherd mat rial in this area is of EBA date, but well stratified materials have not yet been recovered. Concentrations of slag were noted at the N end of the area. The finds from Kavos S (Special Deposit), The profusion of finds from the Special Deposit was entirely unexpected, although the possibility of some material of ?lite character had been clearly indicated during the 1987 survey. Again there was abundant pottery, similar in general character to that recovered from the original Special Deposit, including painted and stamped and incised wares of the Keros Syros culture. These have been studied by Peggy Sotirakopoulou, who reports that the preservation is not as good as in the main Special Deposit. The average fragment size appears smaller, and the surface is in general less well preserved (Fig. 107). No material characteristic of the Grotta-Pelos period was found, and it is clear that the Special Deposit of Kavos S, like the main deposit, began during the Keros-Syros culture, with a few finds attributed to the Kastri Group. More than 200 marble figurine fragments, generally in very broken condition, were recovered. It is at once clear that these are old breaks, and that the material was originally deposited in broken condition. Since there is no sign of recent disturbance, the breaks cannot be attributed to recent causes. Nor can they in general be attributed either to seismic activity or to soil movement. The figurines are generally of the 'folded-arm' variety, char acteristic of the Keros-Syros culture (Fig. 108). There are also fragments of the schematic Apeiranthos type, also in use at that time. No figurines attributable to the earlier Grotta-Pelos culture were found. Fragments, including heads of the Spedos and Dokathismata varieties were frequent (Fig. 109). Rare forms, such as a fragment of a double figurine, were also represented. Detailed study remains to be undertaken to look for possible joins among the fragments. But already it is quite clear that there will be few if any such joins, and that few if any complete figurines are represented. It is already evident that in most cases the figures were not broken in situ in this location, but that they were brought, already broken, from elsewhere, and deposited in this location. The fragmentation is very systematic. Nearly every folded arm figurine will have been broken into at least four pieces. In few cases was the figurine broken by a single blow. Usually there has been deliberate further breakage, with at least three deliberate blows per figurine. 107. Keros: ECyc pottery</page><page sequence="88">88 JAMES WHITLEY ET AL. ;^^||lfi^|g||i||||; 108. Keros: 'composite' ECyc figurine 109. Keros: ECyc figurine head The marble vessels are likewise broken into quite small pieces. The most common form is again the marble rolled-rim bowl, although again other forms are found. No joins have yet been found, although these will later systematically be sought. One of the most characteristic forms among the finds is the spool or pestle, often of a specially attractive stone, or of the shell Spondylus gaederopus. It has recently been recognized that at a number of EH and ECyc sites these 'spools' served as weights. In nearly every case those at Kavos were deliberately broken. But their geometry is sufficiently regular to allow in the future estimation of the original weight of each piece to be made. Considerable quantities of obsidian, mainly in the form of fragmentary blades, were recovered. The stratigraphy suggests that there may already have been some spread of obsidian at the site before it came into use as an area of special deposition. The almost complete absence of metal finds from the Special Deposit is of particular note. Similarly there are few if any ground stone tools, such as are normally found on settlement sites. Several large flat discs, of the kind usually described as 'pot lids' were recovered. Although most were broken, they were not in the highly fragmentary condition of most of the other finds, and their role in the Special Deposit remains to be further considered. Geology and geomorphology. John Dixon, during his visit, began the more detailed study of the geological history ^ the site. It has clearly, in the geological past, been subject to significant seismic activity, but it remains to be established whether that has significantly changed the nature of the site since its occupation. This is of particular importance, since a fall in sea level of about 5m would make Dhaskalio a peninsula attached to Kavos, rather than an islet. Sea level change on this scale or more would reveal areas of potential arable land, which are at present so conspicuously lacking in the immediate vicinity of the site. There is also a freshwater spring, now located 2m or 3m below sea level, some 30m S of Kavos S which may have been a significant resource in earlier times. The Special Deposit at Kavos S appears to be the result of in situ deposition. The possibility that it is the product of downwash from higher upslope was investigated by the excavation of trench Gl. The marble question. The source of the marble used for the marble figurines and marble vessels so profusely recovered in the Special Deposit is a matter of considerable interest. Already the studies of Dr Broodbank and Dr Hilditch of ceramic material from the 1987 project have shown that a high proportion was imported. The same is likely to be true of the marble. Interpretation. We were exceedingly fortunate to discover an extensive and rich Special Deposit which has not been disturbed in recent times. This at once allows us to resolve several of the questions which have been described as the 'Keros Enigma', arising mainly from the disordered and looted state of the original Special Deposit. We can now assert that the breakage is anc, that it was deliberate and that it took place elsewhere - whether elsewhere on Keros (which seems unlikely) or perhaps at different locations in the Cyclades. Another important issue which remains to be investigated is the nature of the so-called central area lying between the two Special Deposits. It is our first impression that the nature of the structures there may be different from that seen on Dhaskalio or the Doumas house on Kavos. The 1987 survey undertaken by Dr Whitelaw suggested that this may also have been the location of an extensive settlement. That hypothesis remains to be tested by excavation. What is already clear, however, is the exceptional nature of the site. No evidence for burial was found in the Special Deposit of Kavos S and the water sieving employed would have found human teeth had they been present, even if the bones had decayed. Moreover, if it proves to be correct that the 200 figurine fragments represent nearly 200 figurines, the scale of the rituals of breakage and deposition documented becomes very considerable. In due course joins will have to be sought also with the figurine fragments recovered from the main Special Deposit. If joins there are likewise few, the total number of figurines documented at Kavos will run into many hundreds, or more. This is comparable, as an order of</page><page sequence="89">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2006-2007 89 magnitude, with the total of figurines that have been recovered from all the Cyc cemeteries taken together (and far in excess of those recovered during controlled excavation). These arguments could lead one to suggest that Keros Kavos was a unique ritual centre within the Cyc islands, perhaps the earliest regional ritual centre of the Aegean. Thera (Santorini) Ethnos (03/05/2006) and To Vima (29/08/2006) report on the underwater investigations carried out by the oc?anographie vessel Aigaio in the area of the caldera and at the crater of the Koloumbos volcano, in the NW area of Santorini. The research project is a collaboration between Rhode Island University, the Gr Centre of Maritime Investigations and the Gr Institute of Geological and Metalliferrous Explorations (IGME). It aims at the investigation of the thickness and the distribution of the volcanic material depositions in the seabed of the wider area and the exploration of hydrothermal shafts located around the crater of Koloumbos volcano. Akrotiri. C. Doumas (ASA) reports (Ergon, 76) on further conservation work undertaken here, especially after the unfortunate accident of 2005. To Vima (24/05/2006) and Ta Nea (24/07/2006) report on new evidence from the recent excavations at Akrotiri presented by C. Doumas in a conference held at Ohlstadt. Based on the archaeological testimony, C. Doumas suggests that gold, pome granates and the vine had already reached the Aegean from the area of the Black Sea by the end of the 3rd millennium BC, a process that might be linked with the myth of the Argonauts' travel to Colchis and the Golden Fleece. Eleftherotypia (29/04/2006 and 18/06/2006), Ta Nea (28/04/2006 and 04/05/2006) and To Vima (28/04/2006) present extensive accounts on new data for the chronology of the volcanic eruption. W. Friedrich published the results from the radiocarbon dating of an olive branch found trapped in volcanic material in the caldera walls, which assign an early date for the eruption from 1627 to 1600 BC. A similar date is proposed by S. Manning, who analysed 127 organic samples from Akrotiri. The repercussions of the proposed high chronology of the eruption, ca 100-150 years earlier than previously estimated, are significant not only for the history of the Aegean civilisations but also for the external correlations with Egypt. To Vima (12/01/2007), Eleftherotypia (12/01/07) and Ta Nea (12/01/2007) report on a public lecture by C. Doumas on the cultural benefits which derived from the existence of the volcano for the inhabitants of PH Thera. These are significant in the field of architectural design for protection against earthquakes, in the use of volcanic materials for the construc tion of stone tools, in cultivation and especially viticulture, in the use of mineral pigments and the artistic inspiration expressed in wall-paintings. To Vima (28/02/2007), Kathimerini (28/02/2007), To Ethnos (28/02/2007), Ta Nea (28/02/2007) and Eleftherotypia (28/02/2007) report on a public lecture by the volcanologist G. Vougioukalakis on the early chronology of the eruption of the Thera volcano (ca 1614-1613), its mechanism and duration and its impact on the S Aegean. Moreover, pollen and seeds trapped in the ash material suggest that the eruption occurred most probably in spring time. Byz Thera Foinikia-Oia, church of Agios Georgios. Ch.

Klima, Kabouris plot. A rock-cut tomb along with two rock cuttings of unknown date and purpose were excavated in the area where the port of the anc. city of Melos was situated. Three walls, a well and two four-sided rock-cut pits were found in the vicinity. Under the rock-cut pits lie large cave openings which were deemed too dangerous to investigate. The excavated area was refilled. Movable finds include three marble statuettes, a headless marble bust of the Rom period and various objects dating from the Hel to the EByz period. Surface finds, which include rf and black glazed pottery, were seemingly transported from an unknown spot along with a superficial mod. backfill. Aveltion Shipping Company Ltd plot.

Ch. Televantou (ADelt, 811-13) reports on the continuation of the cleaning and restoration works in the Myc acropolis of Agios Andreas. The already excavated buildings C and D were cleaned. Also, cleaning between building complex A and buildings B, J and H revealed a so far unknown building of significant dimensions (17m by 14m), which dates, with all probability, to historic times. The new discoveries were inserted in the topographic plan of the site. Z. Papadopoulou (ADelt, 813-14) reports on the restoration of the Acropolis of Kastro, which started from the NW sector, where postByz houses and a paved road came to light; their discovery caused the preliminary restoration study to be modified, in order to preserve these elements. The wall of a Med building also came to light, which will, from now on, constitute the SE limit of the BSA excavation, which took place in the 1930s. The cleaning of the anc. wall revealed a N corner belonging to an earlier phase that diverges by 2.70m to the NE of the N corner, which post-dates the former. Three building phases of the wall are visible: the anc; a second, at a distance of 2.30m from the exterior of the anc; a third (Med), which initially coincides with the anc, but then rises higher towards the interior of the acropolis and ends on top of the aforemen tioned most recent N corner. Movable finds include objects dating from the Geo to the postByz period. Anaphi Ch. Televantou (ADelt, 815) reports on the restoration of the archaeological sites of the island, which continued (see ADelt 1998, 811-13) with the hill of Kasteli, where the anc city of Anaphi and its cemetery lie.

Archaeologists from the EMA retrieved fifteen domestic vases dating to the 3rd Ct AD, while hundreds more vases are estimated to be buried in the sand of the seabed. No parts of the ship are yet visible. At least four shipwrecks have been located in the area until now. E. Pharmakidou (ADelt, 956-58) reports on on-going excavations in the cemeteries of Astypalaia Chora. Kylindra, Phoivos EPE plot. 126 enchytrismoi were uncovered in three strata (I-III) of different consistency; the majority of the jar burials were found in the deepest stratum, placed in shallow rock-cut oval pits and secured with stones (Fig. 110), A common find in these deposits is crushed shells. Some of the burial jars were covered with small stone heaps. The majority of the jars are amphorae, from various areas in the N and E Aegean, dating from the Ar to the Hel period. Hydriae were also used in the Ar period, while small cooking pots were used for a limited number of burials. In most cases, the jars had an oval or rarely square break in the belly; one of the jars was covered by a pithos fragment, which was mended with lead clamps. A trial trench in the NE area of the plot revealed another six enchytrismoi in Ar hydriae and confirmed the continuation of the cemetery in this area. Pottery finds from the deposits, especially those of stratum II, include large amounts of Ar and Cl sherds, among which many Attic. 110. Astypalia, Kylindra: child amphorae burials Katsalos At Petrinolis plot, three trial trenches (A-C) revealed disturbed burials and cremations in rock-cut pits. Three cremations in oval pits were found in trenches A and B. Finds include a considerable amount of carbonized almonds, an unguentarium dating to the end of the 4th Ct BC, small fragments of burnt bones, two metal sheets, one bronze and one lead, and a bronze nail. Four rectangular shallow rock cut burial pits were found in trenches B and C. The graves were disturbed by mod. cultivation. They were probably built cist graves. Lumps of clay plaster with traces of wood were found in two of the burial pits. One of the pits contained most of the retrieved finds, which include a fragment of a clay figurine, a cylindrical marble fragment and two iron buttons. Outside the SW corner of this grave, in a rock-cut pit, two small bowls, three small bronze rings, bone fragments and egg shells were found. At Pilatou plot, six trial trenches revealed disturbed burial pits. At Katsalos-Provarma, during works for the construc tion of the municipal road, Ar pottery and some disturbed burials were found, among which were three almost destroyed enchytrismoi in closed vases, placed in rock-cut pits, and also a rectangular rock-cut pit.

To the W of the road part of the NE corner of a LRom building came to light. At the junction of O. Konstantinou Palaiologou and Megalou Konstantinou (Diakogeorgiou-Spanou plot) parts of the anc. roads P30 and P20a and extended remains of ?lite buildings were uncovered. In the W sector K. Bairami (ADelt, 930) reports on excavations at the junction of O. Grammou and Vas. Irakleiou (Pipinou plot). At the N part of the excavated area the S border of the anc. road PI8 was uncovered, built of dressed blocks, and also parts of superimposed road levels. To the S of the road, at the W part of the plot, LRom building remains were found. At the E part of the excavated area, to the S of the anc. road, LHel building remains were uncovered, possibly associated with a neighbouring workshop. Anc. cemeteries. In the W cemetery, P. Triantafyllidis (ADelt, 930-31) reports on excavations at O. Peiraios (O.T. 267a, Mamma plot), where 31 rock-cut rectangular shaft tombs and ten circular rock-cut loculi were uncovered. Most of the tombs were looted or re-used; a few burial goods suggest that the cemetery was in use at the end of the 4 -E3rd Ct BC, and also in the LHel period. At the W side of the plot, three cremations in shallow trapezoid rock-cut shafts were found. Apparently, the shafts were used for the cremation of the bones, deposited in the hydriae buried in the neighbouring loculi. In the SW part of the excavated area, the vaulted roof of an underground rock-cut tomb was found (/. 7.20m, w. 2.10m, h. 2m). Along the narrow sides of the tomb, rock-cut tombs were opened. Five were investigated at the E side, all looted, with finds dating from the EHel to mod. times. Two rock-cut burial klinai-sarcophagi were also found in the tomb; white plastered and dated by burial goods to the L4th Ct BC. Over the interior rock-cut tombs small loculi were opened, some of which contained urns. K. Bairami (ADelt, 932) reports on excavations at O. Kameirou (Fotaki plot), where five rock-cut shaft tombs and a rectangular rock-cut pit used as a cremation area were uncovered. The tombs were looted. In a later period tile graves were constructed over the earlier tombs. E. Karatzali (ADelt, 932-34) reports on excavations at O. Kameirou (Parassou plot). In the W part of the plot two burial areas and a series of LHel rectangular rock-cut tombs were uncovered. The W underground burial area was partly rock-cut and partly built, and had a small built niche to its S. Finds include fragments of stone ossuaries, some inscribed, a glass unguentarium and Rom sherds. To the W and S of this burial area, underground rectangular tombs were found, built by square slabs. Inside tomb 4, dated to the LHel period, a pit was investigated, which contained a fragmentary inscribed base of a</page><page sequence="93">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2006-2007 93 LHel bronze statue. At the NW side of the tomb, another pit was found full of bones and fragments of ivory plaques and lead sheets that probably belonged to a small box. To the NW area of tomb 4 a small shaft grave was uncovered; a fragment of a Rom inscribed plaque was found. To the S of tomb 4 and along the SW side of the plot, three rectangular underground tombs came to light, partly rock-cut and partly built of large plastered blocks. All were looted in the Rom period, as the pottery indicates. To the E of the tombs two loculi were uncovered, one rectangular and one circular; the latter contained an urn, a Hadra hydria, with burnt bones, and a thin bronze sheet. The pottery from the disturbed deposits of the W burial area and the other burial areas mentioned above dates to the L3rd-E2nd Ct BC. Rom walls and the bedrock set the boundaries for the W burial complex. Burial area Al was uncovered in the NW area of the plot. In the SW side of this rectangular area a pit was found, which contained five ossuaries with their lids. Four of the ossuaries were inscribed (APIITOBOYAOY, FfPQTAPXO Y etc). Finds include ung?entar?a dating to the Ist half of the 3rd Ct BC. To the E of the W burial area a large underground built tomb (tomb 9) was excavated (/. 2.70m, w. 1.25m, interior h. 1.30m), covered by four slabstones found in situ. No bones were found; the pottery dates to the end of the 3rd Ct BC. To the W of tomb 9, another rectangular built tomb (tomb 31) was found (/. 2.05m, w. 0.90m, h. 0.60m). A few sherds were found dating to the end of the 2nd Ct BC. At O. Apoll?nos (Alvanaki plot) part of a LRom building was uncovered in the E area of the plot. Parts of two large rooms were excavated, with walls built of stones and architec tural elements from tombs in secondary use. To the SE of the complex a wall was found with a fragment of a clay pipe in its interior. To the E of the wall a stepped entrance was formed by large marble blocks. Pottery from the rooms dates to the LRom-ECh period. To the NE of the complex a long wall was uncovered, which must have been part of a per?bolos or terrace. In the central cemetery, F. Zervaki (ADelt, 934-35) reports on excavations at O. Kon. Ydraiou (O.T. 324, Katsara plot), where part of the extended cemetery with shaft graves dating to the 2nd half of the 4th Ct BC came to light. In the plot, thirteen rectangular rock-cut tombs and two circular loculi were found, all looted. A few burial goods were preserved, including pottery, coins, a bronze mirror, a pin and nails. One of the loculi contained a burial hydria, while the other contained a cremation. In the SE area of the plot, two multiple rock-cut tombs were investigated; tombs 4 and 5. Tomb 4 consists of a central chamber and two rectangular loculi at the narrow ends. All areas were used for secondary burials. Eleven skulls and other bones were found, and also pottery, burial hydriae, an inscribed cylindrical altar with relief bulls' heads, an inscribed ossuary, an iron ring and 45 small beads. Tomb 5 consists of an antechamber and a chamber and was found covered with slabs; both areas were used for burials. A few vases served as burial goods, dating to the 2nd half of the 4th Ct BC. K. Bairami and P. Triantafyllidis (ADelt, 935) report on finds uncovered during works of the State Service for Drainage and Sewage at O. Iroidos Anastasias. Part of a porphyry (purple dye) producing workshop was uncovered, consisting of a small kiln, at least three tanks built of dressed blocks covered in waterproof plaster and two small built structures with cobbled floors. The deposit was disturbed and contained Hel and Rom sherds. P. Triantafyllidis (ADelt, 936-38) reports on excavations conducted during works of the State Service for Drainage and Sewage. At O. Dim. Anastasiadi four ossuaries were found, one with lid. At the junction of O. Valia Semertzidi and Agathonisiou a broken inscribed ossuary was found, containing a few burnt bones and an Hel bowl. At the junction of O. Dim. Anastasiadi and Agathonisiou two LHel inscribed stelae were found. At the junction of O. Dim. Anastasiadi and Chiou two ossuaries were found, one inscribed with lid. At the junction of O. Salaminos and Agathonisiou an inscribed base of a tombstone was found. At O. Agathonisiou remains of Hel and ERom tombs were uncovered. In the W area of the trench a layer of black soil was reached, which contained a large amount of bones and LHel pottery, apparently from secondary burials. A base of a tombstone was also found. In the S area of the trench a burial structure came to light (tomb I), partly built and partly rock-cut, which was looted and contained a few bones and finds of the LHel and ERom periods. On its floor bones from secondary burials were found, and also fallen rectangular slabs which served as lids for the loculi opened on the S, E and N sides, all looted. It seems that the burial structure originally formed part of an earlier tomb, which was later used as an ossuary in LHel and ERom times. To the N of tomb I, a vaulted tomb was uncovered (tomb II), partly built and partly rock-cut. Two inscribed tombstone bases were found outside its N fa?ade, while from the tomb deposit came bones and various finds dating to the Hel-ERom period, including fragments of an ivory box, fragments of bronze mirrors, a tombstone base, fragments of clay and glass ung?entar?a, a lamp with an erotic scene of the Rom period, two coins, one silver and one bronze, and a gold earring. To the W of tomb II, tomb III was excavated, which was apparently used for secondary burials and cremations in kalpes and cooking pots, dating to the 2nd half of the 3rd Ct BC to the 1st Ct AD. Finds include pottery, a glass alabastron and silver coins. Adjacent to the NW corner of tomb II, part of a burial monument was identified (max. /. 2.40m, max. h. 0.64m, max. vis. w. 0.50m). To the N of the tombs a column drum and an inscribed ossuary with lid were found. At the junction of O. Zakynthou and Kefallinias a broken ossuary with fragments of its lid were found. At O. Kon. Tsaldari part of a rock-cut rectangular shaft tomb came to light, which contained an ossuary and Hel vases. To the S of the tomb, a fragment of an inscribed tombstone was found, and part of a road was uncovered. The road forms the continuation of anc. road P27, which led from the S sector of the anc. city to the cemetery and the countryside. To the S of the road a tombstone base was found. N. Christodoulidis (ADelt, 938) reports on finds uncovered during works of the State Service for Drainage and Sewage at O. Kon. Ydraiou. Twenty one rock-cut rectangular tombs and a rectangular rock-cut loculus were excavated. Most of the tombs were looted. Finds include pottery dating to the 2nd and 1st Cts BC, while the loculus contained a burial hydria, two amphoriskoi, a bronze mirror and an iron spearhead. At the E cemetery, F. Zervaki (ADelt, 938-39) reports on excavations at O. Atavyrou (Kladogeni plot). At the E part of the plot a Hel burial peribolos was uncovered. The burial complex measures 8m by 9m and was surrounded by a low wall with an entrance to the N. Inside the complex a wall podium covered a series of partly rock-cut and partly built loculi. At the S side of the peribolos, burial platforms were found. In total, four rectangular rock-cut tombs and 31 6r)K?s were investigated, most of which were found looted. Seven intact vases dating to the E3rd Ct BC were found in one of the loculi. A plaster floor was constructed at a later stage over the burials. It appears that the area of the peribolos was subsequently used for burial feasts, as testified by the burnt deposits containing pottery, mainly small bowls and plates. Some architectural elements were found, including tombstones and small altars, among which is an inscribed altar with relief wreath and ivy motifs.</page><page sequence="94">94 JAMES WHITLEY ET AL. K. Bairami (ADelt, 939-41) reports on excavations at O. Philerimou (O.T. 406, Giannikou plot). At the S sector of the plot a rock-cut area was uncovered, with sides lined with dressed bocks. It is suggested that these are the foundation remains of a small burial temple. In its interior, inscribed grave altars and inscribed stelae were found. To the N of this area six tombs with built plastered sides were found, most looted. In one of them two ossuaries with cremations were found and a silver bowl. At the N part of the plot a deposit was excavated, which contained many inscribed broken tombstones. In the E part of the plot seven rock-cut small tombs, seventeen loculi and three built vaulted tombs with antechambers were investi gated. The built tombs were looted. The rest contained burial hydriae and ossuaries with cremations. All tombs are dated to the Hel period. N. Christodoulidis (ADelt, 941-42) reports on excavations during works of the State Service for Drainage and Sewage. At O. Ikarou, four rectangular rock-cut tombs were investigated. All but one were looted. Finds include pottery dating to the 3rd Ct BC. In the same trench a cylindrical rock-cut loculus was found with a burial hydria. Another two burial hydriae were found to the E. At Leoforos Kallitheas, six tombs were found, one rock-cut, two built and three consisting of one large stone sarcophagus with lid. One of the rock-cut tombs belongs to a child burial. The three sarcophagi date to the end of the 4th Ct BC. Finds from the sarcophagi include pottery, a silver bowl, bone necklace beads, a bronze mirror, two iron rings and a bronze coin. Finds from a built tomb contain a series of clay pots and an iron ring. At O. Akramitou, in the E part, four marble tombstones and three bases were found. One stele was inscribed (AIOKPITOY).

Trianton (K.M. 668A, Paraskeya plot) investigations focused on the following areas. LB IA/LM IA road between the Xeste building and the S polythyron. The subsequent road levels were investigated to the N of the S polythyron. Along the N side of the road there is a pebbled floor, on top of which, at its W end, part of a slab paved area is preserved, with a rock-cut channel along its S side. It seems that before the ash fall and after the pre-eruption earthquake the inhabitants had started covering th? pebbled road level with a new slabbed one, works which were never completed. The N end of this road, which coincides with the N wall of the S polythyron, was found disturbed, possibly after the volcanic eruption, as suggested by ash and mature LBIA/LMIA sherds found in the excavated deposit. Trial trench W-SW of the corridor border W of the Xeste building and S of the volcanic ash baulk. The wall that borders from the W the W part of the Xeste corridor is based on a layer of pebbles, which covered the W wall of the W MBA room. Ash deposits uncovered to the W and SW of the wall suggest that the area was disturbed during repairs after the earthquake. Part of another parallel wall came to light immediately to the W under the ash levels, and also a pebbled area and carbon remains to the W of this new wall. MBA remains. Two rooms were investigated under the corridor to the S of the Xeste building. The E room measures 2.70m by 4m and its walls are found under the foundations of LB IA/LM IA walls. On the E part of the floor three intact triton shells, two jugs, part of a carinated cup and two closed vases were found. A large area of the W room was investigated. The W and N walls, a door opening and a small pit in the floor, possibly for the foundation of a wooden column, were uncovered. Thick deposits with MBA pottery and other finds were excavated to the N of the N wall of the room. The levels under the volcanic ash, W of the N preserved end of the W wall of the Xeste building, were excavated. Building remains of the E phase of LB IA/LM IA were uncovered, a rectangular room and a floor. In deeper levels, parts of MBA rooms were found. SE sector of the LBA settlement. At Parodos Grigoriou Lambraki (K.M. 6671"", Margariti plot) the investigation of a LH IIIA2 rectangular area continued. In the S part of the room, two rectangular bases of baked clay were found. In between these bases seventeen discoid loomweights were found. The clay bases and the loomweights point to the identification of a loom installation in this room. To the N of the loom area two piles of stones were revealed; the E pile must have been formed after the destruction of the N end of the E wall of the loom area, while the W pile is probably associated with the collapse of earlier LH IIIA1 walls. To the N and NW of the corner of the walls and the stone piles, an area with large fragments of rectangular slabs of baked clay came to light. Traces of fire at the NW part of the area, around an oval pit, suggest that the area belongs to a pottery workshop. MBA habitation levels. At O. Trianton (Mavrothalassiti plot) the excavations were completed (see ADelt 1998, 954 55). Two rooms were explored, A and B, one with red and the other with white plastered walls and floors, and also a probable outdoors area in between the rooms and other walls with thick secondary depositions rich in pottery. Some of the walls of the rooms were constructed with a fill of raw clay bricks or clay with organic inclusions. The W wall of room A, to the N of the monolithic threshold, had a fill of stones in three layers. The W wall of room A joins a clay brick wall, similar to the S wall of room B. On the floor of room B thick deposits with pottery and dark red-colour lumps were found. Secondary deposits excavated in the SW area of the plot contained much pottery and were covering an area with fallen baked clay bricks. Inside room A, apart from the elongated pink plastered bench along the E wall, another taller rectangular bench or podium was uncovered to the W and parallel to the E bench (/. 2.05m, w. 1.05m), also red plastered as the rest of the room. Traces of three long carbonized wooden rods were found near the E wall of the room (/. 1.65m, 1.25m, 0.54m, di. 0.20-0.30m). Soroni, Naos Ayiou Louka. V Patsiada (ADelt, 947-48) reports on finds uncovered during works in the area of the church. A Doric geison was found, as well as building remains and a drain, which was probably covered by the geison in secondary use. The geison measures 1.80m by 1.1 lm by 0.45m and preserved traces of its colour decoration. It is not possible to identify the building to which it originally belonged. In one of the three trenches opened in the area E of the drain, fragments of tiles and two bulbous ung?entar?a from a tile grave were found, while human bones were identified in another trench. Kritinia, Fragma Lirou. A. Alexandropoulou (ADelt, 948) reports on excavations conducted during works for the construction of the river dam. A small cemetery and rural building were uncovered in the area where the water basin will be formed. To the W of the Lirenos river, four broken urns were found (hydriae and kalpes) and two destroyed tile graves with bones. Another two destroyed tile graves were found to the NE of a bedrock area near a slabbed pavement bordered by walls, possibly parts of a peribolos. The cemetery is dated by pottery finds (terra sigillata, ung?entar?a) and a bronze Rom coin to the Hel and ERom periods. To the SE of the cemetery, remains of a rural installation were uncovered. Five rooms were excavated; the E part of the complex must have been a later addition. Pottery and a Rhodian coin date the remains to the LHel/ERom period.

CRETE In the Abstracts (ACC) volume handed out at the 10th International Cretological Congress (Chania, 01-08/10/2006) are very many references both to excavations of the recent past and studies being made now on earlier discovered material. Inevitably, much is reported but briefly and is lacking in detail. Where entries are not explicitly linked to a particular or recent year, they are not remarked upon here. Where the excavation can be seen to have been conducted within the past three or so years, it has been included. The volume is well-worth consulting.

Minoan Roads Survey. S. Chrysoulaki (Ministry of Culture; ADelt, 871-72; ACC 50) reports on the work of 1999 and later. Studies of the finds from the excavation of test trenches at the Choiromandres guard-house were directed at elucidating stratigraphy and room functions. The S part of area II, below LM IB material, had a floor of trodden earth, with a concentration of pottery: all were set above a level with a tpq of MM III-LM IA. In this last was a sealstone (sun and seated lion; Fig. 114) that recalls a similar one recovered from another guard-house at Chamaitoulo, Siteia. Earth used to fill irregularities in the bedrock contained EM and MM sherds. From the N part of area IV, below floor trials confirmed the walls were built in LM IB. With comparable evidence coming from space II, it is clear that the N and E parts were extensively re-organized in LM IB. Surface surveying was carried out at Skalia and both Epano and Kato Zakro. At Kinigakia and Peristera possible open-air shrines were located. Protopalatial pottery and some animal figurine fragments come from the first, and from the second seashells, fine wares and a plastic-decorated MM II tripod table. Did they act as boundary-markers for the territory of Kato Zakro? At Schoinares part of a potter's wheelhead, together with remnants of a kiln, argue the place was a ceramic manufacturing workshop. Demos Siteias Petras. M. Tsipopoulou (24th EPCA) reports on the MM IB IIA cemetery, excavated between 2004-2006. The burial area lies on a high plateau, E of the palace and settlement: so far five house tombs are known (one completely, two part dug), comparable but not identical to other such cemeteries in E Crete (e.g., Gournia, Mochlos and Palaikastro). Built of rough stone and set directly on the bedrock, they present more than one phase, so that finally they may comprise six or more chambers and corridors. Burials were placed on the floor, at times in clay larnakes. Some evidence was found for an open area beyond the tombs, where vases were deposited, and a possible boundary wall. Three fragmentary and imported Cyc figurines could show an EM inception, but otherwise in situ finds belong to MM IB-IIA (before the palace at Petras was built). Clay and stone vases, metal finds (gold and bronze) and seals of stone make up the funerary goods. Close by is a rock shelter. Over \m d. of deposit contained grave goods and redeposited bones, probably cleaned out from the house tombs: a similar set of finds of the same broad date range was made (with silver goods and bone seals too). Interestingly, the first material deposited clearly started in EM I, and later included vases of Cyc type and/or manufacture like those at the closeby Hagia Photia cemetery. 114. Minoan Roads Survey, Choiromandres: sealstone Mochlos. J. Soles (North Carolina, Greensboro/ASCSA) and K, Davaras (24th EPCA/Athens) report in 1999 (ADelt, 877) on publication programmes (Mochlos II and ///: now out), and on the cleaning of the site and preparations for visitors. For 2006, they further describe the study season and additional site-conservation. Most progress has been connected with the publication of the M settlement. The final manuscripts of Mochlos HA (on the Myc settlement and cemetery) and for Mochlos IIB (on the LM 11?111 pottery) are with the publisher, the INSTAP Academic Press. Mochlos IIC lacks only the floral and faunal reports. Work began towards Mochlos III (The House of the Metal Merchant and other Houses in Block C of the Neopalatial Settlement on the Island of Mochlos) and Mochlos IV (The Manufacturing Centre in Block C of the Neopalatial Settlement on the Island of Mochlos). Locus lists were prepared and the stratigraphy of each building was examined. Architectural drawings were completed for most of the block C buildings. The pottery for the first was also strewn and studied: a little remains still from houses C.3 and C.6. A LCyc I jug decorated with a bird in standard fashion is one of only a few Cyc vases identified at Mochlos. The cataloguing of bronze objects was completed. From residue analysis taken from unwashed ceramics in building C.7 (Mochlos IV), it can be said that rock rose (cistus) was used as an aromatic in the production of perfume here. Work was initiated on Mochlos V (on building B.2, the ceremonial building of the LM IB town). Architectural plans were drawn up, including that for the newly discovered 'th??tral area' attached to the S fa?ade. N. Vogeikoff-Brogan (ASCSA) continued her study of the Hel remains, completing a manuscript on the 1st Ct 'beam-press house'. At the 10th Cretological Congress, T. Brogan (INSTAP EC; ACC 57-58) presented a picture of MM I-II Mochlos from the 2004-2005 excavations. Even though this phase of the town had been largely removed in the Neopalatial rebuilding campaigns, work in block C yielded evidence. One stratigraphie sequence spans EM III to MM I; excavation along the S and E sides of LM I house C.7 recovered several primary MM I-II deposits. For MM II, there exists a foundation deposit for an MM II house, and two more MM II dumps below the E rooms of the LM I house C.3. Finally, and again from below house C.7, was material from an MM II destruction: that from one room indicates it was a kitchen. Pottery studies indicate a significant increase in the amount of imported pottery in EM III-MM II, mostly from about Gournia and Priniatikos Pyrgos.</page><page sequence="98">98 JAMES WHITLEY ET AL. Pseira. P.P. Betancourt (Temple/ASCSA) and K. Davaras (24th EPCA/Athens) report in 1999 (ADelt, 878) on forthcoming publications. In 2006, they describe study in the field. Cleaning, drawing and photography were started for M domestic buildings in block AF, located at the tip of the Pseira peninsula: the work was undertaken in preparation for final publication. These are some of the best preserved houses on the island; some walls, of fieldstones, stand over lm high. The block also has the best stratigraphy in the town, from MM II to LM III. Among the most interesting rooms are an E pillar crypt from LM IA with a rustic (local) pillar in the basement room and a large room used as a kitchen in LM II (with the hearth still in situ). Off Pseira. Ethnos ( 11/07/2006) reports on a MM II shipwreck being explored by E. Hatzidaki (EMA). Its cargo, buried in sand at a d. of 45m, was carried in vases (87 so far recovered) that suggest it was liquid in character: these include dozens of amphorae, as well as jugs, pithoid jars and cups, one of the last being paralleled at Vasiliki. Eleftherotypia (03/10/2006) reports the recovery too of a clay kantharos, paralleled at Gournia and with Anatolian metal precedents. A report was also made at the 10th Cretological Congress (ACC 49). Demos Ierapetras Ierapetra (Viglia). V. Apostolakou (24th EPCA; ADelt, 869 70) reports on the excavation in 1999 (in the Pagkalou plot) of a Rom house complex from the lst-3rd Ct AD. Of at least three phases in close succession, the walls are aligned to the compass axes and preserve one to three courses only above the foundations (Fig. 115): the earlier set are better made, with rectangular worked stones and plaster remnants, the later contain more re-used material. The W side has five rooms in a better preserved state; in the central room was found a mass of daily pottery (over 21 items), an animal vessel, a small gypsum table, a bronze ring and seven bronze coins in a small clay pot. To the W was a slab-covered tomb, with a TT-shaped hearth to its S (ash lay inside and ash and bone outside). To the E were parts of another structure. Loutra. Eleftherotypia (23/08/2006), added to at the 10th Cretological Congress (ACC 101), reports on a lst-2nd Ct Rom cemetery, to the W side of Ierapetra. Discovered by a farmer and excavated since 2001 by V Apostolakou (24th EPCA), the 32 known tombs had been 115. Ierapetra, Viglia: Rom house complex robbed: only one amphora still held its contents, the skeleton of a small child. The tombs are of tile, or built of stone (gypsum, limestone and even a porphyritic stone) as tholoi or as chambers. Four of these are of monumental proportions, the first in E Crete: built of gypsum slabs, the underground chamber measures between 2.50-2.70m /. by 2-2.20m vu Ceramic vases used as ash urns are frequent; other finds include vases of clay and glass, bronze coins and mirrors, gilded, gold and silver funerary items and figurines. Debris from funerary feasts was identified: ovens, hearths and cooking equipment. Hierapytna. M. Baldwin Bowsky (Pacific; ACC 126) reports at the 10th Cretological Congress on a series of inscriptions. The nine involved record the work of the Rom quaestor Q. Paconius Agrippinus, early in the reign of Claudius. They assist in defining the territory of Rom Hierapytna, giving details of the quality of traffic the roads could bear. They constitute some early evidence for the development of a road network, and illuminate the economic and social recovery of the city before its Flavian floruit. Kavousi. G. Gesell (Tennessee; ADelt, 877-78) reports comprehensively in 1999 on study of the sites at Kastro and Vronda. Work on the pottery from Kastro is proving especially valuable as it is leading to new interpretations of SubM and EProtoGeo, the critical period between the LBA and EIA. In 1998 and 1999 a number of displays were set up in the Museum of Hierapetra: all the phases of habitation from the 12th to the 7th Ct are represented, as will be a cremation burial from Vronda. V Apostolakou (24th Ephoreia; ADelt, 870) reports on the excavation in 1999 of a pithos burial of Geo date: some bones were retrieved but no other finds. Chrysokamino. P. Betancourt (Temple/ASCSA; ADelt, 878) reports on the study season in 1999 for the two main sites: the EBA metallurgical one and the longer-lived M farmstead. The first of three volumes (Chrysokamino I The Chrysokamino Estate) went to publication. Much work was done on the ceramics: these date from LNeo to Ot. The most important phases are EM III at the metallurgical site and LM I?III at the farmstead. Great effort was also put into understanding the furnaces: their form and functioning. Also published is Betancourt, P.P., The Chrysokamino Metallurgy Workshop and its territorv. Hesperia Supplement 36 (Princeton, N.J., A.S.C.S.A. 2006). Gournia. L.V Watrous (Buffalo/ASCSA) reports on the 2006 study season of the Gournia Survey Project. Emphasis was on the Venetian and Ot period pottery. It was studied from the point of view of provenance (i.e., the clay fabric, its colour, inclusions and surface treatment), function (shape and decoration) and artistic style (by comparing the survey material to published examples and to vases on display in the historical museums of Crete and elsewhere). The pottery was then drawn and photographed for publication. Azoria. D. Haggis (North Carolina at Chapel Hill) and M. Mook (Iowa State) report for ASCSA on the 2006 excavation season. The primary target areas were on the W slope of the S acropolis, where public and domestic architecture of the 6th to E5th Ct are known (Fig. 116). To the NW, excavation produced parts of three separate houses. No complete plan was recoverable, but the rooms provide important comparative data for houses exposed earlier (S houses; NE building; SW house; and the N acropolis house).</page><page sequence="99">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2006-2007 99 116. Azoria: plan of site</page><page sequence="100">100 JAMES WHITLEY ET AL. Of the N houses, a single room (D800) was exposed on the far NW point of the S acropolis, apparently built against the outcrop of bedrock that forms the foundations for the N extension of the spine wall and the NE building on the terrace above. The floor is clay (internal dimensions ca 4.60m E-W by 3.40m N-S), bedded to level off the bedrock which protrudes slightly in the centre of the room. Evidence of burning appears best preserved in the SW corner, where carbon, ash and burnt red clay indicate the presence of a fallen roof beam. A round beach-rock quern, embedded in the floor, was exposed there too, near the S wall. Fragments of a skyphos, bowl, cookpot and krater stand were among the contents of the room. SW of this on the terrace below are two rooms (D1200, 1300) of another house; most likely an adjoining pantry/storeroom and main hall. The main hall is characteristi cally large. The internal /. is about 8.5m N-S. Although the W wall is no longer extant, the clay floor is preserved to over 3m E-W. Two schist pillar bases, located on the room's central axis in line with the preserved N doorway into the room (2.45m from the E wall), suggest a w. of 4.7-5m (ca 39m" in area). The centrally-placed doorway in the N wall leads into a peculiar oval-shaped room cut into bedrock (2.50m by 2m), ostensibly a storeroom or pantry containing a considerable amount of pottery including cups, cookpots and a large (LGeo-type) loomweight. SW again and about 6m below is evidence of an adjoining storeroom and hall in the NW house. The storeroom, containing two large schist pithos stands, is to the E (ca 4.80m by 2.80m) and connected to the hall via a doorway in the N end of the W wall. The N, S and E walls of the storeroom are very well preserved; in the N and SE corners they stand to over 2.70m h. above the floor level. The hall, which contains a single centrally-placed pillar base, is oddly shaped, narrower at the E (4.90m w.) than at the W where the internal w. is over 6m. The preserved /. of the room is about 5.50-6m. A well fashioned doorway in the N wall of the hall provided access into one or more rooms which remain unexcavated. The rooms show evidence of the LAr burnt destruction; two well preserved pieces of carbonized wood, perhaps remains of roof beams or wooden lintels, were found fallen in the doorways. The area N of the monumental civic building and W of the andreion complex produced evidence of ritual activity in a series of shrines. Immediately W of and below the andreion is a segment of wall, 8m /. N-S, bordered by a long low bench (ca 0.27m h. and 0.42m w.) constructed of cobbles. The bench is preserved for about 5.50m; a cut-bedrock bedding along the wall face indicates its continuation up to the S wall of the room. The S return wall is extant for some 2m to the W. The remains appear to form part of a typical bench shrine of LM IIIC. Four fragments of a large terracotta figure with upraised arms were found on the bench; one other fragment lay on the bedrock/clay floor surface preserved to the W of the bench. SW of and below this shrine is another small two-room Ar shrine. It consists of two small interconnected rooms on the E side of a terrace formed by a rise in the bedrock, about 13m /. (N-S) and ca 6m w. (E-W), thus being situated immediately N and about 1.20m above the floor level of the monumental civic building. The southernmost room (ca 2.40-2.80m w. and 5.40m /.) has a clay floor and a rectangular bench or altar (0.80m by 0.60m) in its S half. The altar, about 0.40m h., is built of regular courses of schist and occasionally limestone (sideropetra) blocks or slabs. A low stone-lined hearth abuts the N face of the altar. A number of objects were found directly on top and around the altar: two miniature skyphoi, a miniature bronze bowl, three ribbed stands and fourteen terracotta female figurines or figurine fragments (Fig. 117). Among the figurines there are two hollow cylindrical wheelmade types; two daidalic wheel/mouldmade types; one daidalic mouldmade type; one zoomorphic (bovine hind quarters); four course handmade Geo types. Additional finds from the room include a glass bead fragment, a spindle whorl, a piece of folded bronze and a number of marine shells of several sorts (triton, clam, limpet and murex) and a boar's tusk and cranial fragment. A doorway in the N W corner of the room has a step up to a small irregularly shaped storeroom, ca 4.5m /. and preserved to only about 2.5m w. Three boulders (?work-platforms) and a quern lay in the NE corner. Burning on the floor and a fallen roof beam in the S half of the room are indications of the LAr destruction, which left a well-preserved assemblage including a pithos, a Geo krater (Knossian I 117. Azoria: figurines from Ar shrine</page><page sequence="101">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2006-2007 101 118. Azoria: monumental civic building ProtoGeoB), three transport amphorae, a lamp, an Attic exaleptron, a bronze awl, an iron knife blade, an iron nail or obelos, a loomweight and a schist lid. Work continued to the S in the monumental civic building with the aim of exposing an area (7.5m by 5m) in its NW corner (Fig. 118). Removal of the overburden revealed wall tumble, collapsed roofing material and a burned floor surface with four possible pillar bases, suggesting an irregular intercolumniation. Two sondages, one against the N wall and the other against the S, revealed two successive LAr floor surfaces and packing. A large two-room building (D 300) on the W side of the olive-press room and storeroom was recovered. The structure is clearly part of the service complex, sharing its S and E walls with the Ar storeroom/workroom; it projects to the N about 2m further than the last. The largest room (ca 8.30m /. and 5m vu) has two well-fashioned pillar bases on the central N-S axis and a small U-shaped stone-lined hearth near the N pillar base. In the S part is a large basin constructed of angled schist slabs and a pithos fragment, ostensibly held together with mud mortar. It both abuts a cylindrical limestone platform, with three impressions or sockets on its top surface (probably for a door), and is situated against the makeshift bin and a rectangular limestone block, probably the doorjamb. In the LGeo building at the SW (Fig. 119), is an oddly shaped room (B 3700), narrower (3.50m) on the W than on the E (5.30m), and about 4.30m /. (E-W). In its LAr phase the room had a stone bench and seat/work platform in the NE corner and an oven in the NW, just W of a doorway. Three pillar supports are preserved in the central area. It seems to have functioned primarily for food processing. Another single square room (B 3800; 5.40m N-S by 5m E W) is accessible via centrally placed doorways from the room just discussed to the S and a further one to the N. The room appears to have industrial functions - several querns and handstones suggest food processing - while several loomweights and spindle-whorls clustered to the N near the doorway indicate the presence of a loom. The size and juxta position of these two units suggest communal/public rather than private/domestic usage. An abandoned drain channel on the E side of the first room runs, at the SE corner, over the stomion of an EIA tholos tomb (Fig. 120). The tomb's dome and capstone, as well as the slabs forming the stomion and lintel blocks, remain intact. The structure is ellipsoidal (1.42m by 0.90m) and 1.25m in h., from part-paved floor to a single schist-slab capstone. The burials - three inhumations - appear to be intact. The finds consisted of a handmade juglet (SM-Geo?), a flask (Geo), a stirrup jar fragment (LM IIIC-SM), a skyphos (EProtoGeo), a juglet (EProtoGeo) and a bowl (LM III), two conical ceramic beads and a bronze (ring?) fragment (Fig. 121). Excavation revealed three architectural phases in the area of these rooms. At their very N edge, and of the initial EIA (LGeo-EOr) phase, is an unusually large building, whose S wall and doorway were recovered. Its estimated internal w. is between 5.50m and 6m; a centrally-placed doorway is 1.20m w. During the 7th Ct, a retaining wall was constructed perpendi 119. Azoria: SW terrace with LGeo building 120. Azoria: EIA tholos tomb</page><page sequence="102">102 JAMES WHITLEY ET AL. I 121. Azoria: finds from EIA tholos tomb cular to the building, to contain a deep layer of fill that supported a corridor providing access to another room added on the E side. By the end of the 6th Ct, a curved retaining wall had been built against the S wall of the EIA building, abutting the W side of the doorway and extending to the S end of the EOr retaining wall. The function of the wall seems to have been to support fill that buttressed the earlier EOr wall. Excavation at Azoria in 2006 has expanded the sample of domestic areas, providing data that will permit comparison of the economy and storage and consumption patterns in houses in the 6th and E5th Ct. The area immediately N of the monumental civic building seems to have accommodated ritual activity in LM IIIC and LAr. The finds from the Ar shrine, however, include a number of ProtoGeo-EOr artefacts, perhaps indicating continuity of cult in this area, or perhaps cognizance of the history of the sacred landscape. The location of the Ar shrine is situated in the middle of the civic complexes immediately below the andreion, but directly adjoining the monumental civic building. Access to both the shrine and the building would have been from a street or corridor on the W; the juxtaposition of shrine, andreion and public banquet hall is certainly significant. The recovery of the complex stratigraphy of the lower SW terraces has significantly affected understanding of the E history of the site; it has revealed the extent of the site's trans formation in its topography at the end of the 7th Ct. The abandonment of an unusually large LGeo-EOr building, with possible cultic functions, occurred during phases of rebuilding at the end of the 7th Ct. Thus the evidence indicates that the radical rebuilding of the settlement at this time was a deliberate process not only of expansion beyond the limits of the EIA settlement, but of spatial reorganization and the creation of civic architecture at the expense of the EIA topography. A deliberate disengagement from the past is so represented, with the possible exception in the shrine area. Architectural conservation continued at Azoria in 2006, employing the same methods and materials used in 2005, in accordance with the request of the Directorate of Conservation of Ancient and Recent Monuments. This work was conducted at the request and direction of the 24th EPCA. Demos Agiou Nikolaou Vrokastro. B. Hayden (Pennsylvania/ASCSA; ADelt, 879-80) reports on study in 1999, which was centred upon sorting out the later ceramic groups by period from the general mass collected. B. Hayden (Pennsylvania/ASCSA) and J. Moody (Texas, Austin) report on the study season of 2006. Investigating 'Granodiorite (GD) resources in the Mirabello region: their variability, distribution and use from Neo to mod. times', J. Moody examined first BA and Gr sherds in order to assign them to fabric groups previously defined during the Vrokastro Survey Project. Continuing with Rom and post Rom material, she located very little GD: instead most Rom 'coarse to med coarse' fabrics are tempered with siltstone/claystone. This paucity of GD fabrics in Rom times is interesting as they are common again in later periods (Byz, Venetian and Ot). Lato. A. Farnoux (Paris 1V/EFA) and H. W?rmser (EFA) report on the survey and excavation of 2006 (Fig. 122). Work</page><page sequence="103">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2006-2007 103 122. Lato: general view with mainly Hel walls restarted (following that between 1967 and 1971 ) with the aims first to prepare documents needed for expropriation, and then to manage the site. A topographic survey, begun in 2005, builds on the plan published by J. Demargne in 1901, adding contour lines, for example. The 2006 campaign first checked the Demargne plan (in terms of positioning and identification of the buildings) and then conducted a GPS survey, including transversal sections. An analysis of the circulation pattern within the settlement allows the following observations. A space between the summits, not far apart, of the two terraces both permitted movement along the contour lines and supported the soil banks. The transverse streets, cutting across the contour lines, gave access from one terrace to the other (they are sometimes identified by a system of rectangular pillars). Three trenches in the W sector were dug to understand the structure, extension and orientation of the terraces in a contentious area. The most striking morphological aspect newly revealed in studying the geography of this area is the presence of five sinkholes: Lato itself is sited around one. New remains too were encountered: excavation in the central sector revealed a thick anc. wall and close by the remains of a drainage or irrigation system. Other walls were now made visible, together with a great quantity of Myc sherds. At the W foot of the site is a deep ravine, yielding intermittent water: this had been closed by a wall, probably erected in antiquity. Effort was also spent on reviewing the epigraphical corpus, replete, as it is, with toponyms of a geographical nature, and on analysing the access points of the city (building on the observable circulation routes in its territory); a record of water sources was also compiled. Demos Oropediou Lasithiou Hagios Charalambos Cave. P.P. Betancourt (Temple/ASCSA) reports on the 2006 study season. Work included the study of pottery, human bones, animal bones, and small finds from the M burial cave. The catalogue of the human bones is progressing: a little over 10,000 separate entries have now been made. Work in mending the skulls and femurs also continued this season. Broken bones were found scattered through several levels in the rooms of the cave, and some were mended up from fragments excavated from different rooms. This information is important because it shows that the bones were mixed by the Ms at the time that they made the deposit in the cavern in MM IIB. The larnakes (moved from the INSTAP Study Centre to the Hagios Nikolaos Museum) were also mended from fragments found distributed throughout the cave; both from the front rooms and in the lower parts. Much of the work with the pottery involved sorting, drawing and photography of individual pieces, as well as the compilation of statistics. At the 10th Cretological Congress, S. Ferrence (INSTAP) reviewed the evidence of the figurines. Ten were recovered, of anthropomorphic, abstract and zoomorphic types: half were pierced so as to be worn as amulets. The materials include hippo ivory, bone and shell, as well as marble, a green igneous stone and one blue/white soft stone. Their details tie in the Lasithi plain with the wider M and off-island worlds: two are derived from Cyc FAFs, other stylistic ties are with the Trapeza cave on the same plateau and with the Mesara tholoi (e.g., at Koumasa, Porti and especially Hagia Triada). Karphi/Magoulas-Kaminaki. A. Kanta (Institute of Cretan Studies) reports on a programme of cooperation with V Apostolakou (24th EPCA), running since 2004, to clean and conserve tombs at these sites. A number of tombs around Karphi were cleaned, including those dug by Pendlebury. Between the villages of Magoulas and Kaminaki, by the main road, a M tholos tomb was investigated between 2004-2006. Despite its looting in Rom times, and subsequent use as a rubbish dump, it preserved important finds: beads of gold, glass paste and faience (Fig. 123), various objects of ivory, including a female figure, and seal stones. The excellence and quantity of the finds suggest this is a 'royal' tomb. Its date is provision ally placed at LM IIIA1/2. Demos Mallion Malia, Anc. Town. J. Driessen (Louvain) and A. Farnoux (Sorbonne, Paris IV) report on the study of the M Quartier Nu in 1999 (ADelt, 873). Work on the stratigraphy of the N zone showed that they had been dumping grounds for material after the first destruction of the building. Three sherds carried Linear B inscriptions, as did a stirrup-jar from room 13. The latest occupation is fixed as LM IIIB or B2, with no LM IIIC; at least as defined at Chania. Samples for fabric analysis and to elucidate technological matters were taken: some imports from the Mirabello area were recognized. 123. Karphi: glass paste bead</page><page sequence="104">104 JAMES WHITLEY ET AL. Smaller scale cleaning around the hypostyle crypt and the NE approaches to the palace were also undertaken (ADelt, 873-74): details of walls and pavements were recovered. In the Quartier Delta, I. Bradfer-Burdet and M. Pomadere (both EFA) report on the study carried out in 2006, following the 2005 excavation season, on building TT in the M settlement. Examination of the stratigraphy and the architectural remains has confirmed the succession of at least three Neopalatial archi tectural phases. Some clay pieces carry prints of branches or rushes laid in a row and may have come from a light roofing. From the walls came many fragments of plaster in solid white, blue and red; some had a figurative motive (indiscernible in detail because of their small size), others were simply decorated in red or black stripes. Different soil types were represented in making the floors. Registration, study and restoration of the pottery and the small finds commenced. Initial work on the stone vases has revealed that they are, in essence, typically M shapes, with the exception of one likely Egyptian import. The paleo-environ mental remains included shellfish, bones and seeds, alongside much carbon. Their sorting by flotation revealed both a seal of a marine animal (the second Neopalatial one recovered in the building) and a small piece of gold leaf (4.5mm in /.). This last seemingly has the shape of a shellfish, with embossed details. A survey of the E part of the 'Street to the Sea' was carried out, so completing the plan of the urban zone surrounding building T7. This permits a better understand of its relationship with the surrounding buildings and with the W court of the palace, where this street ends. Finally, a restoration campaign on buildings A? and Ay successfully completed the work begun in 2005. Malia Valley Survey. S. M?ller-Selka (CNRS and EFA; ADelt, 874-76) reports on the work in 1999. The aims of completing the topographical record and starting the artefact studies proper were overtaken by matters arising from public works in the area. After some sites had been damaged by the construction of the new national road, the cave of Fragkandoni, 500m S of the mod. village, was surveyed. The access corridor and the vaulted entrance had been shaped, and a cutting made into the ceiling of the main chamber. There were found a small bench fitted to the S wall, a pillar and walls of small stones. Originally the space was enough to accommodate a standing person. Surface sherds are later in date; a coin of Constantine was found. A rescue excavation was planned for the following years. The M sandstone quarry at Hagio Pnevmatos was completely destroyed by the construction of a marina at Malia. At the Hellenic Palace hotel at Hagia Varvara, a layer of pumice associated with LM IA vases has been disturbed (Fig. 124); elsewhere damage has been sustained to the House of the 124. Malia Valley Survey: LM vase with pumice inside Fisherman. Study of remains (lithic and ceramic) from central and E marshy areas reveals that occupation began there in L EM, continued down to LM IIIB and was revived in the LRom and ECh times, 4th-6th Ct AD. Quarries. S. M?ller-Selka (CNRS/EFA) reports on the 2006 season in the continuing survey of the sandstone quarries (ammouda), focussing on the two most extensive examples hereabouts, at Pyrgos (between the archaeological site and the mod. village) and Potamos (immediately to the W of the Mill beach). Examination of the dimensions of the architectural blocks left at their removal was followed by a companion campaign, detailing the elevations of the W stores of the palace, almost exclusively composed of sandstone blocks. Some rectangular pits (very probably used as tombs) were discovered under a half metre of water in the E part of the Potamos quarry. These can be compared with similar pits identified in 2004, situated to the E in the same quarry: their date is impossible to specify. Work on material recovered in the survey also continued.

Demos Chersonisou Chersonisos. K. Galanaki (23rd EPCA; ADelt, 844-48) reports on the rescue excavations undertaken in 1999 in the harbour area. Seven areas and oikopeda were investigated, of which five were of relatively minor importance. In each of these last were found structures of Rom date in the form of walls and, at times, rooms, some with up to three phases of development. Arrangements for water supplies were common enough. One also had two Rom tombs: a tile grave in poor condition and a cist which, though damaged, yielded ten glass vessels, a ceramic lamp (Medusa), three bone pins, a winged item of bronze and four coins, and a piece of lead. A similar range of goods accompanied the buildings: vessels of clay and glass; items of stone, including statue fragments; clay lamps; bone pins; clay objects (loomweights, plaques, lamp moulds); lead and bronze pieces, with bronze coins. In the Apostolakis plot, 150m NW of the Rom theatre, a variety of material came to light. At the E, two tombs had been dug into the bedrock: of LCl-EHel date, they are part of a known larger cemetery. To their W was a horse burial. Further W still were uncovered structural remains: a large part of a temple-like building, orientated E-W, had some of its N and S</page><page sequence="105">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2006-2007 105 walls standing to 5m h. Floor and wall (red) plasters were found. Cisterns for water and various pipes for its transport are noted, by one of which lay a life-size marble statue of Trajan (Fig. 125). Nearby in pits was recovered pottery of LCl-EHel and Rom times, of exquisite quality. Finds included clay lamps and daily-use vessels, and also of glass; clay loomweights of two sorts and spindle-whorls; clay plaques and figurines; bone pins; and bronze coins. At the Navarchos Nearchos Road plot, eleven walls, associated with floors of tiles, stamped soil and lime plaster, form perhaps part of some harbour installation of the Rom and Hel periods. Finds included a marble column base and another stone architectural fragment (with ivy carvings); clay loomweights, whorls; objects of glass paste; and items of lead, iron, bronze and gold. Three box-like tombs of ECh date (aligned E-W) were found: though looted, they had sherds of clay (jugs and aryballoi) and glass vessels. S. Mandalaki (23rd EPCA) reports on excavations made in 2005 and 2006. In 2005, a rectangular cistern of Rom date was excavated: the biggest so far found here (15m by 3m by 4m), it probably supplied the nearby baths in the area of the theatre. Its water supply was carried from the central reservoir at 'Palatia' by a channel that ran on its S side. In 2006, seven Hel graves, dug into the bedrock, were opened: they are part of a larger cemetery. Some had rich offerings: rf pottery, gold and bronze jewellery and glass necklace beads. 125. Chersonisos: Rom statue of Trajan 126. Galatas: LM IB pithos within destruction level, room 60 127. Galatas: foundation deposit Demos Thrapsanou Galatas. G. Rethemiotakis (Herakleion Museum; ADelt, 850 52) reports first on the 1999 excavation season of the M Palace. Work was undertaken in two sectors: building 2, which was completed, and a start was made on the interior of the N wing of the palace. In building 2 rooms 10 and 11 were excavated: a burnt destruction level yielded pottery, mainly conical and semi spherical cups, as well four pithoi (Fig. 126), some with small feet and one with a Linear A inscription. Thus building 2 consists of eleven spaces: nine rooms and two staircases. Its date is LM IB as the pottery shows (marine style). In the N wing of the palace, work begun at the W, and eight areas were opened. These have been damaged due to later agriculture. Tests below the floors show walls and sherds from MM IB houses (so differing from the E wing which has material of MM IIIA date below it). Construction seems to have been carried out at the N and W during MM IIIB/LM IA. Abandonment may have occurred earlier in LM IA in the W wing than at the N, with its mature LM IA. This last has cups with wavy bands, a hemi-spherical one with spiral decoration and examples of the floral style (papyrus and crocii). The final destruction deposit, as a result of an earthquake, left slabs from the upper flooring in the lower rooms: some of schist measured 0.80m by 0.80m by 0.16m.</page><page sequence="106">106 JAMES WHITLEY ET AL. At the NW corner, involving a fissure in the bedrock, was a foundation deposit: 60 vases of MM III, mostly cups, but also basins and jugs (Fig. 127). With them were burnt organic matter, a few animal bones and goat's horns. Set above was a rectangular table of offering, from serpentinite. Areas 37,38 and 39 contained few finds: pithoi pieces and a conical lamp of serpentinite. Access to these and then to other areas to the N and E was gained through a large hall (40), behind the main N entrance. Room 42 yielded a gourna; room 44 a generous amount of good quality wares, a pithos and pedestled stone lamp. Considerable observations on the architectural techniques and finishing can be made. Many masons' marks were recovered (80 in total for the site): tridents and stars in particular, with rarer cross and 'dumb-bell'. There was extensive use of wood; white plaster floors (rooms 39, 40 and 42); plastered fresco associated with the N exterior wall (bands of blue - light and dark, red and cherry-red); and some low relief associated with windows and doors. Architectural elements show a limited occupation in the N wing in LM IIIA2-B, after the destruction. A potter's wheel and a fragmentary bronze vessel (recalling others recovered in 1996 from S of room 22 in the W wing) argue for workshops in these crafts at this time. W of the N wing, a strong-built wall was found: part of another building. The two rooms sampled produced a pithos, a ceramic female figurine and a steatite sealstone. One hundred and fifty sherds from the excavation were sent for residue analysis. In 2006 work was conducted in two sectors. The first, in the palace, involved the E part of the N wing, revealing the exterior wall on the E and the complex access way to the central court and the M hall in the N wing. The M hall played a key role in regulating all the circulation in a local web of corridors, spaces and stairways: of the last, there exists one on each side. That abutting the external E wall of the N wing is especially noteworthy. Arranged in two flights, it provides passage from the hall first down to a stepped access and finally out to a road running outside the W and N wings; it also deals with the difference in elevation caused by the considerable slope away to the E. Retaining walls in this last area hold firm the fill of a ramp and a terrace that are also part of the access system to the central court from the N and E. The room fills and further destruction debris accumulated upon them contained abundant MM III pottery and fallen ashlar blocks from the exterior walls of the palace. A footed table of offerings, circular and of serpentine, resembles those found at the sanctuary of Syme Viannou. In the NE corner a pit-like structure went deep into the foundations: over 100 intact vases were recorded and also fragments of many more (cups, jugs and rhyta for liquids, shallow plates), a rectangular offering table (again of serpentine), an abundance of carbonized wood and burnt soils, as well as animal bones (mostly sheep, some cattle). Perhaps burnt offerings were part of the ritual alongside libation and drinking rituals? The bulk of the pottery dates to MM III with some LM IA lying over it: the pattern of deposition suggesting continuity of the offertory practice. In the second sector, the focus was S of the palace, in the court of the baetyl. A large platform was uncovered, abutting the external face of the S wing. The face opposite the baetyl was in ashlar, set on a slighter lower course, with remnants of a flagged surface stretching towards another platform discovered earlier. Taken as a whole, this open-air area acted as a venue for viewing the ceremonies that took place in the paved area and on the elevated platform of the baetyl; the stepped exedra served as a seat for the viewers. This combination of baetyl and platform fits the cult scenes portrayed on the metal rings, as with that from Archanes. A dense scatter of sherds on the bedrock attests to libation rituals as well as the consumption of food and drink, though much may have derived rather from the nearby (and unexcavated) building 6. Many shapes are represented, albeit in a fractured state: communion cups, libation jugs, cylindrical vessels, bridge-spouted jugs, pithoid jars and pithoi, amphorae, kalathoi, plates, large trays and tripod cooking pots. Also retrieved were the head of a hollow animal figurine, the base of a stepped libation table of serpentine, a bronze dagger and many animal bones, including an ibex horn. Whilst consolidating building 2, a small limestone model of a 'horns of consecration' was found wedged into the masonry. The horizontal and vertical striations under the horns proper seem to reflect dressed ashlar masonry, on top of which the horns were placed. Galatas Survey Project. L.V Watrous (Buffalo/ASCSA) reports on the 2nd field season of the systematic survey around the palace of Galatas. The area surveyed in 2006 was located between the villages of Thrapsanos, Apostoli, Sambas, Filissia, Hagia Paraskies, Astritsi and Alagni. The project found or investigated 78 sites in this area, ranging in date from LNeo to Venetian/Ot. This brings the total number of sites in the area to 124. Several sites deserve special mention. A large Neo settlement with seven well-preserved structures was discovered on the hill of Platilas overlooking Stironas to the S. Surrounding the village of Sambas, a large E-LM settlement was mapped: a massive fortification(?) wall is preserved at the W edge of the settlement. An EM I?II and Neopalatial site was found on a hilltop S of Filissia: at its edge and on the highest spot a M platform with traces of mud-brick(?) and burning was found. This structure, with a clear view N to Jouktas and Episkopi, may be a M signal tower (sows). NE of Thrapsanos, a small M structure was discovered situated amid Neopalatial pottery and an enclosure wall. N of Alagni the excavated M farmhouse was noted. A cave located on the W edge of the gorge between Voni and Zophoroi produced Neopalatial, LM III and ProtoGeo/Geo finds, some of which (conical cups, a pilgrim flask, fine ware vases and a seashell) look like votives. The IA site at Astritsi Kephalas was measured and mapped. In the area of Limnes, N of Thrapsanos, a tholos-like Rom? building was found next to an anc. road. N of Zophoroi on the top of a hill, another circular built platform with traces of fire was found: based on the pottery, this structure appears rather to be a Venetian period signal tower. In an attempt to determine the size of the M settlement at Profitis Ilias Archalochori the site was divided into sectors and material collected. At the end of the season we returned to the settlement of Galatas to try to measure the size of the settlement in the Protopalatial and Neopalatial periods. In addition, some ten sites found in 2005 were revisited to clear up specific questions of chronology and function. On one the measurement of walls revealed a large (60m by 16m preserved) M building, constructed with an inset and supplied with magazines and pithoi. Finds recovered include: Neo black burnished pottery, stone axes, chert and obsidian blades, cores and scrapers; EM wiped wares and MM IA? handmade vessels; Protopalatial straight sided and carinated cups, pithoi and jars; a range of Neopalatial vase shapes, as well as a stone bowl and drill-bit guides; LM III kylikes, goblets, an octopus stirrup jar, a stamped amphora/jug handle. Material of ProtoGeo, Geo and Or date; Ar relief pithoi, cups, loomweights, skyphoi, mortars, kraters; Cl and Hel black glaze cups, bowls, plates, imitation West Slope ware; Rom plates (E, but mostly L), cups, bowls, roof tiles; Byz, Venetian and Ot glazed wares.</page><page sequence="107">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2006-2007 107 The pattern of settlement (from LNeo to Venetian/Ot) in the area of Galatas is becoming clearer. The earliest sites date to the Neo period (but not its latest phase), frequently located on hilltops at strategic places that could control the movement of animals between valleys. EM sites are found on hilltops, often on the N edge, so providing an extensive view toward the N. Protopalatial sites increase in number and size, and occupy different types of locations. Some 85 are on defensive locations; others, however, are established on prime agricul tural positions, near arable land and a source of water. At the beginning of the Neopalatial period many new sites are founded in the area immediately surrounding Galatas. The location and density of these sites suggest that they played some sort of support role for the palace at Galatas: one probable such role is the production of agricultural surplus intended for the palace. In LM III many sites are deserted; few new ones are established. By LM IIIC the population of the area has dropped further and is severely nucleated at a few sites. This pattern continues through the Geo, Ar, Cl, Hel and ERom periods. In the 3th Ct AD some small sites, probably rural farms and hamlets, are tentatively established across the landscape. Settlement during the 2nd Byz era, e.g., the village of Galatas, probably continues this practice. Only in the Venetian period, perhaps by the 13th Ct, is this pattern reversed. After that, land use and settlement, especially around present day villages, such as Thrapsanos, becomes more intense. Demos Gouvion Gournes. K. Galanaki (25th EPCA; ADelt, 853-56) reports on the excavations in 1999 at the I0ABIK site on the former American base. An EM I?II cemetery of 36 tombs was found. It has strong similarities with that known at Hagia Photia, Siteia. Most are ellipsoid chambers with an antechamber dug underground into the kouskouras, the entrance closed by slabs of sandstone or limestone with other stones used in the construction of the tomb chamber proper; some are more in the nature of shallow pits. Three were located under the MM-LM house. Skeletal material was lacking in all but one tomb. The finds were recovered equally from in and outside the main chambers and in the pit-like graves. One hundred clay vases were recovered: some in Pyrgos, Hagios Onouphrios and local Palaikastro styles. Fruitstands, pyxides (round and conical) of different sizes and their lids, many with incised patterns, amphorae, bowls, kernoi, cups of small to medium range, jugs and others were found. Ten groups of seashells were found. Also recovered were 31 Melian obsidian blades, often placed in the pyxides; a silver necklace of disc-beads, a bracelet and other jewellery; three bronze pins, a bead and other bronze items; three bracelets of steatite beads of different sizes and a separate bead. The vases compare with others in Crete (Kokkini Chani, Knossos, Haghia Photia), the islands (Cyclades, Samos, Lemnos) and the coasts of Asia Minor and Palestine; as indications of trade and contact in the EBA. Close by is an MM-LM rectangular building: orientated N-S, it is of two phases. It is constructed of limestone and boulders. The first phase had two internal spaces, with the entrance at the W Then the N section was sub-divided into two, and the W entrance replaced by two others. The one in the S W has a sandstone threshold. The walls stand to 0.50 h. Many sherds of MM-LM vessels are known: conical cups, cups and basins up to larger vessels including cooking pots and pithoid forms. Three pieces of obsidian, and chert and steatite; and seashells complete the list. A water cistern was located at the NE. Only the foundations survive (3.50m by 2.50m, with the walls standing to 0.50m h.). Associated pottery gives no date, though an underlying layer of soil had material of MM II in it. Skoteino. A. Kanta (Institute of Cretan Studies) and L. Tyree (ASCSA) report on the continuing study of the material from the M sacred cave, excavated by K. Davaras. The main ritual use was during Neopalatial times. Most material dates to then, with LM III A and B well represented too. Rom re-use is known. The Neopalatial ritual involved drinking, as is indicated by the multitude of pouring and drinking vessels: a typical shape is the chalice. They exist in several variations and sizes; one fragment bears a Linear A inscription. The consumption of food was also part of the ceremony, as tripod cooking pots of mainly small to miniature size show. During LM III, prominent among the shapes are deep bowls and stirrup jars. The Rom revival is marked out by lamps, some with religious scenes. L. Tyree (ASCSA) and A. Stamos (INSTAP-EC) continued in 2006 the EDM work to ground map the cave. Demos Kastelliou Smari. D. Hatzi-Vallianou (Archaeological Institute of Crete; ADelt, 910-25) reports at length on the 1999 excavation season of the Geo and M houses and conservation measures taken for some. Only the simplest pr?cis is offered here. Inside the acropolis were a series of Geo houses, erected over M ones. In megaron A, apart from details of the central hearth, part built of slabs in the central hall of the Geo building, the finds were broadly M in character. Parts of M walls, built on to the natural rock, were uncovered, defining spaces, of which one had a trodden earth floor. Up to two architectural phases were noticed, one with some carbon and burning associated. MM (I?II) finds were commonest, including clay vessels (conical cups, basins, amphora, pithos, tripod cookpots etc.), clay whorls, obsidian blades, bone pin; though material as E as EM-SubNeo was also noted (burnished pottery). The relative quantities of obsidian led to the suggestion that some craft activities were taking place. Megaron B, in contrast, seems to contain largely Geo material, though it is suggested that its earliest manifestation was also MM in date. Earlier work had ceased at the LGeo/Or horizon associated with paved floors. Below in the central room lay fills, also carbonized remains of a possible column. A 'grate' of stone (1.09m by 1.63m) contained ashes and burning as well as vases, including a cup. Other vases recovered included pithos, pithoid vases, many cups and an iron blade. Rear rooms told a similar tale: fallen stones and earlier pavements of more than one level were found with bones and olive pips, obsidian, vessels that included pithoi, basins, skyphos and many other fragments of medium and larger sizes. Lower still along with the same environmental material were recovered more such pottery, stone vase pieces, obsidian, stone tools and weights, seashells including conches, clay beads etc. Between megaron A and the Temple of Athena (Kl), the removal of Geo debris from the destruction revealed what was an open area, no doubt intended for the inhabitants of the Geo settlement to congregate for the worship of Athena. Immediately W of this opened two rooms (Ml, M2), with a paved area E of the latter. The first chamber is large for the settlement in the Geo phase. In it, amidst scattered carbon, were various clay vessels, including krater and everyday wares, including a baking tray. Lower down was a level of M date.' In</page><page sequence="108">108 JAMES WHITLEY ET AL. the second room, equipped with a built-in stone 'table' on the S wall, excavation went below the Geo floor, finding daily use and storage vessels of clay, confined by the stone walls and a clay structure. Their date is uncertain. To the N (areas H and N) and NE (area L), a series of rooms and spaces was investigated. In many cases Geo clay vases were recovered, sometimes with earlier architectural phases, and everywhere the levels below yielded MM wares, some fine and some of coarser/storage character and a stone vase lid. Outside the acropolis, and its LM peribolos wall, some structures were found. Building 1, a single-storeyed room (5.75m by 7.75m), lies to the S. Its walls were preserved to varying degrees, enclosing the fallen stones of itself. Excavation produced a number of levels, marking stages of destruction(s). Within them were many vases (pithoi and others), stone tools, a clay loomweight, a bronze fragment, a steatite 'button' and remains of olives and other seeds. The building it seems was dedicated to storage and processing. It dates to LM IIIC. To the NW is a 'round' construction (3.50 3.90m across, with wall 0.60-1 m vu). Its interior has fallen stone slabs over soils with evidence of burning. Many high footed kylikes give it a date of LM IIIC-SubM. Demos Viannou Sithonia. S.

Sweetman (St Andrews; ACC 206-07) reported at the 10th Cretological Congress on the ECh basilica at the Knossos Medical Faculty. She offered a new analysis both of the basilica, with its cemetery and t?menos, and of post-basilica features. The study provides evidence to show that Knossos was a major communication point within Crete in the L antique period, being as vibrant and influential a city then as it had been in its Rom heyday. Knossos Urban Landscape Project (KULP). M. Bredhaki, A. Vasilakis (both 23rd EPCA) and T. Whitelaw (BSA/UCL) report on the 2nd study season (2006) of the KULP survey, a synergasia between the BSA and the 23rd EPCA. The 4.2 tons of material collected in 2005 was washed and sorted, providing a full overview of the material and preliminary dating of pottery from the systematic samples (ca 2,500 collection units). These and the finds from the systematic samples (280,600 sherds and 5,000 other finds) were sorted and entered into the databases. Some 55,000 sherds are decorated or preserve features and thus are reasonably diagnostic: 10,279 were PH, 26,732 were ProtoGeo to Hel, 8,265 were Rom, 7,649 were ProtoGeo to Rom and 2,020 were post Rom. Seven hundred and twenty seven represented rare fabrics which cannot yet be dated. Sixty four certain and likely Neo sherds were identified from immediately NE of the palace, on the edge of the tell. Their virtual absence elsewhere is indicative of the nucleated and spatially restricted pattern of Neo settlement in the valley. Seventy four readily diagnostic Prepalatial sherds were recognized, spanning the EM I-MM IA periods, in a low density scatter throughout the area. This supports the view that dense settlement was restricted to the tell through most of the Prepalatial period. The bulk of the later PH fabrics remain in use through both the Protopalatial and Neopalatial periods, so the numbers of sherds as yet assigned to specific phases are limited. Nearly 1,000 Neopalatial sherds identified by shape or decoration are distributed widely across the site, defining an area of 60-65ha as the maximum extent of the PH city. Two hundred and twenty certain and likely LM II?III sherds were recognized, spatially comparable to the Neopalatial distribution; finer chronological distinctions will have a significant contribution to make to debates over the nature and chronology of the decline of Knossos as a centre, following the destruction of the palace. Approximately 800 sherds of the EIA were identified. Their wide distribution N of the palace, in areas not previously tested by excavation, is a significant addition to the comprehension of EIA Knossos. Detailed attribution to phases within the EIA will contribute to our understanding of the growth of the site during the process of polis formation. No attempt was made at this point to distinguish material within the broad LAr to Hel phase, though it is now clear that the major expansion of the centre took place by at least the end of the Hel period, rather than later with the foundation of the Rom colony in the Llst Ct BC. This suggests that the site grew in parallel with the expanding political dominance of Knossos over much of N central Crete, during the Hel period. The importance of Knossos during the Rom period is well known, if not particularly well documented archaeologically: the N half or so of the site is the best understood. The survey coverage to the E and W has filled in the picture very signifi cantly. The distribution here of diagnostic later Rom-Byz material, minimally represented elsewhere from excavated deposits at Knossos, documents a significant reduction from the full extent of the Rom city. A clear contraction to the NW helps to explain why so little contemporary material has been recovered from major excavations around and to the W of the palace. Nearly 1,000 glazed post Rom sherds (in addition to some 500 obviously recent examples) should provide a richer understanding of the later history of the site, after it ceased to function as an urban centre. Little Palace N. S. Thome (BSA) and M. Prent (Amsterdam) report on the study season of 2006 for the project of E. Hatzaki (BSA). Work was devoted mainly to material of the Cl and Hel periods. Study of the EIA was completed for publication in 2008. Architectural survey work was conducted and phase plans were produced in autocad. The Cl and Hel area is defined by robbed M walls at the S and W, and by foundations for Rom walls at the N and E; it is further divided N-S by two other Rom foundations. Much of the very fragmented pottery found had been used as floor packing. Four major phases have been distinguished. First and earliest, a build-up of hillwash and fill against the N wall of an LM IIIB building had been levelled and paved. While predom inately LM, the material below the paving contained pottery from the 7th and occasionally from the 6th Cts BC. The size of the paved area, dated to the Cl period, suggests that it was originally left open. In the second phase, the area was subdivided by the construction of two N-S walls, built directly over the paving. Domestic deposits of the L5th to M4th Ct were found against these walls, with associated traces of possible earth floors. To the W the construction, or reconstruction, of a terrace wall is dated by the fill behind it to ca. 350 BC.</page><page sequence="109">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2006-2007 109 Next, scattered potsherds indicate that occupation continued during the Hel period of the 3rd Ct, but new work in the 2nd Ct had displaced much of this. These renovations of the final and 4th phase entailed both cutting back the hillside to the W and filling the slope to the E, where much of the 3rd Ct material had been found. The second-phase walls were replaced by a new N-S one: constructed of re-used M ashlar blocks. Indeed the W wall of the LM IIIB house referred to above was still standing and had long served to help retain or terrace the hillside. It was now extended to the N, so forming the W wall of the enlarged 2nd Ct house. The area to the E, later cut by the foundation for a Rom wall, was again paved, while flooring in the W consisted of small, black water-worn pebbles set in a bed of crushed kouskouras. Several relayings of these pebble floors were found, dating to the L2nd to Elst Ct BC. The original pebble floor sealed a whole pithos which had been sunk up to its neck. It contained material from the 1st half of the 2nd Ct BC, but the surface with which it went has yet to be securely identified. Much may have been lost here in the L2nd Ct reconstruction. Katsamba. Eleftherotypia (18/09/2006), Ethnos (24/09/2006) and Erga &amp; Imeres (27/10/2006) carry reports on M shipsheds and dockyard installations by A. Vasilakis (23rd EPCA). The main structure recovered below a thick deposit of sea sand comprised two wings with a N-S access way or corridor between them. Each wing is made up of a series of elongated, rectangular spaces that individually measure at least 21-23m /. by 6m vu, with an internal area of 150m2 or more: their full lengths are unknown. The six walls so far revealed, each lm w. and containing ashlar blocks, define parts of five rooms on a N-S axis: the fullest preserved are two at the W. The floors are of earth, on which the burnt destruction debris rests. The whole complex is of impressive size. Finds made inside them fix their date to LM II-IIIA. They variously include a hearth, plain vessels (cups, jugs, amphorae, tripod cooking pots, pithoi and especially stirrup jars), clay weights for fishing purposes, bone and bronze pins and unusual amounts of raw materials including obsidian, steatite and pigments. Quantities of lead items had been damaged by the heat of the final fire destruction. The structures further confirm the existence of the M harbour town in this region, at the mouth of the Kairatos river that flows down from Knossos, as already indicated by finds, houses and burials. The shipsheds lie about 100m from the present course of the river and 150m from the original seashore. Excavation below one shed's floor to the water table revealed traces of a further pair of walls of comparable quality that suggest there were earlier Neopalatial? buildings of the same sort on the site. Their disuse (ca 1490-1450 BC) may have been accompanied by a ritual deposit: a large concentra tion of bones and horn-cores of cattle and goat was found, along with many conical cups, other vases and a spear-shaped bronze blade. Demos Gaziou Fodele. M. Borboudakis (13th EBA; ADelt, 903-04) reports on the discovery at the church of the Panagia of the baptistry; the whole built on the ruins of the basilica. The interior space, called the fotistirion, is a rectangular area, paved with slabs. It contained the pool in which the actual baptisms took place. Demos Gortinas Gortyn. Six Italian teams have been conducting excavations at Gortyn in recent years. G. Montali, // teatro romano di Gortina. Studi di archeologia cretese 4 (Padova, Bottega d'Erasmo, A. Ausilio 2006) presents a study. Of the following, the first report is from 1999, the others date to 2005-2006. Praetorium. A. Di Vita (Macerata; ADelt, 856-57) mostly worked S of the Temple of the Augustan Deities and a little inside the same. The rear wall of the court of the praetorium abuts that of the W side of the stadium (built on the 1st Ct BC), at the S end of which runs a descending stairway connecting the praetorium's court to the stadium's entrance. Between the stadium and the temple an exceptional find was made: an Augustan altar. Orientated E-W, of monumental proportions (3.10m h. above foundations), it has pediments decorated with spirals and akroteria and a staircase on the E; so the priest faces the sunset. Though damaged by an earthquake, it remained until the 6th-7th Ct AD, at which point it became engulfed in debris from the nearby baths. The reason for this may be sought in a small cippus altar (of the later Augustan period) that is dedicated to the 'supreme god': this may have earnt the edifice the respect of the later Chs, and so protected it. Repairs possibly conducted by Trajan incorporated some 50 broken lamps; perhaps indicating rituals conducted at nightime. In the adjacent Temple of the Augustan Deities, erected by Marcus Aurelius in the 2nd Ct AD, part of a large stone sculpture (the lower torso and legs) was recovered built into a later internal dividing wall. It is from a female clothed figure, perhaps the cult statue itself. Gymnasium. At the 10th Cretological Congress (ACC 132-33), M. Livadioti (Bari) reported on the work carried out by Di Vita between 1989-1995 at the Praetorium, with especial reference to the earliest phase, the structure of which is seen as a gymnasium of the Elst Ct AD, set adjacent to a 1st Ct BC stadium. The large yard (35.5m by 28.8m) and its portico in the Doric-Tuscan order were orientated N-S. On the E it abutted the tiers of the stadium and was accessible from it. In the W were a set of rooms, to the S another possible set were eradicated by the insertion of the warm rooms of the thermal baths (see below) in the time of Trajan. Features of construction align it with Cretan Gr traditions rather than the newer Hel ones, though Italian L Republican features (e.g., the portico's order) are detected, as are Ptolemaic ones in some of the units of measure. Contemporary with the Trajanic baths was a remodelling in the W, when a three-apsed structure was inserted. Profitis Ilias settlement. N. Allegro (Palermo/SAIA) reports on the Geo and Or periods of excavation. This campaign concentrated on the terraces beneath the settlement and on the E-W road which separates them from the settlement. In the E part of the upper terrace, between the E-W road and the N-S alley which flanks the LGeo house, was discovered a great court paved with compacted earth and fragments of stone. This may have been part of a vast 7th-6th Ct complex. At the S side the court remained open; on its E was a covered room connected to a courtyard; and on the W a narrow and elongated space, perhaps a portico. Excavations in the lower terrace yielded new data about work completed in the last phase of the settlement (8th-7th Ct). During the construction of the E-W road a massive terrace wall was completed; the central section was composed of a wall of stones and earth buttressed on both sides by two mighty triangular structures. General erosion in this area, however, has removed the features of the most recent phase. (The presence of Hel elements can be attributed to the construction of defences and</page><page sequence="110">110 JAMES WHITLEY ET AL. their garrisoning between the 3rd and 1st Cts.) Some remnants of buildings are visible at the E end of the terrace. Here were explored two rooms of 8th-7th Ct date, flanked at the E by a paved ramp which joined the E-W road. Two stratigraphical trenches yielded pottery sherds which demonstrate that this part of the hill was utilized from the last centuries of the 2nd millennium. The theatre of the Pythion. F. Ghedini (Padua/SAIA) reports. A wide trench between the scenic building and the base of the cavea was opened in order to investigate the characteristics of the deposit below collapse levels removed in 2005. The construction is dated to the 1st half of the 2nd Ct AD. Between the cessation of theatrical activities (L3rd to E4th Ct) and the earthquake which caused the theatre's collapse (later 4th Ct, perhaps after the terrible quake of 365 AD; two horses were caught in the collapse) this area was used as a rubbish dump. The newly exposed archi tectural elements, however, have been covered with a calcareous material and sand in order to protect delicate and precious surfaces; such as the opus sectile in polychrome marbles used for the paving of the orchestral ground. The thermal baths to the S of the so-called praetorium. G. Bejor (Milan/SAIA), restarting work here, reports. The excavations brought to light a thermal bath probably built around the mid 4th Ct AD, with transformations on into the L5th Ct at least. The structure stretches N, up to the road connecting the stadium to the area of the Pythion. The frigidarium, occupying a 10m2 area, has been revealed. At the edges mighty pillars indicate an original cross-vault. Its floor, in polychrome opus sectile, is particularly rich and remarkably well preserved, despite many anc. renovations and two great gaps where pillar bases had been removed. At the centre was unearthed a loutron (5m in di.) with three steps and a floor composed of slabs of white marble alternating with ones of slate (the lead drainage pipe is also still visible). The foundations of the loutron are most closely connected with the preparation of the floor and, therefore, may be said to belong to the same building phase. From this central room access was gained to two baths: a broad and rectangular one was entered between two columns (still preserved); the second and apsidal bath was decorated with marbles. This last, at some later date, was filled in and covered with a new floor in marble slabs. Excavation between this later floor and the original bottom of the bath has yielded a notable quantity of pottery of the L5th Ct. The Byz quarter of the Pythion. E. Zanini (Siena/ SAIA) reports on the continuing investigation here (including the area between the monumental complexes of the Temple of Apollo Pythios and the so-called praetorium) aiming to obtain a better understanding of the occupation phases between the 5th and the 8th Cts AD, of which three major phases existed. In Rom times the area was occupied, at least partially, by buildings, whose foundations follow different orientations. In the E they were aligned with those of the praetorium, and in the W with those of the Pythion. In L antiquity, many buildings of smaller dimensions existed, infilling the earlier layout and often restructured before becoming part of the great proto Byz building. New street systems evolved, too. The socio economic make-up altered fundamentally: a new social stratum occupied the earlier monumental centre. An artisan-peasantry both tilled the land and seasonally worked in the urban centre with iron, animal skins/bones and perhaps glass. Of proto Byz date, a pebbled road was unearthed. This constituted the cross axis of the quarter and was connected with the road which ran to the N of the praetorium. NW of this road three rooms of an important building have been partly excavated. The building has an entrance with a great threshold of stone, paved with rectangular re-used slabs. An adjacent room had an imposing drainage system. On the opposite side of the road was located a large space, perhaps left open, which led up to the cistern fountain (E of the buildings already inves tigated). On the axis of the road were emptied two mod. pits. They revealed details of the preceding road levels as well as of an articulated water distribution. Work within rooms excavated earlier permitted comprehension of the stratigraphy in the L antique and proto Byz eras. The hypothesis that a great building with several floors was constructed around the M6th Ct has been confirmed: its different phases are now clearer. After the M6th Ct AD, the road axes were maintained until at least the end of the 7th Ct. In the zone overlooking the cistern fountain, a necropolis area was established in the later period: at least two graves '? caisson' exist (similar to some recovered here in the past). Several dumps of discarded materials of the 7th Ct have furnished interesting information about the quality of life and the material culture in Gortyn at that time. The basilica of Mitropolis. R. Farioli (Bologna/SAIA; ADelt, 904-05) in collaboration with M. Borboudakis (13th EBA) report. Work was continued in several areas: this included the cleaning of the collapsed debris from the two minor S aisles and further investigation in the E apsidal sector (room II N). The first is characterized by collapsed structural material, including blocks with painted plaster, an arch in brick and rectangular building blocks. These blocks are most probably to be associated with a pillar (comparable to situations seen apropos the dividing columns of the small aisles, which had fallen besides their respective bases). Also unearthed were levels of damaged paving, fragments of limestone floor slabs and, along the S perimeter wall, segments of a bench. The mosaics were especially numerous: some bore geometric patterns, others contained motifs drawn from the plant and animal worlds. One bore a circle, linked to smaller ones at the corners of the field, with a garlanded kantharos from which two peacocks drunk; the circle carries two rows of lettering, mentioning the archbishop BETPANIOJE, an otherwise unknown figure. In the E apsidal sector was found a trapezoidal room, covered by collapsed material, much quarried later, and also by a great quantity of tiles, which lies above a layer with traces of fire. The room is also paved with tiles of several dimensions: larger ones dominate. Along with a communicating and adjacent chamber, this room is a later addition to the Justinianic complex of the synthronon-peribolos. The stratigraphical relationships of the walls and the associated finds suggest a date in the high Med period. The narthex was investigated in the basilica. The rotunda, to the N of the basilica, was also investigated (see also M. Ricciardi, ACC 206): it is identified as a fountain or baptistry. An ambulacro was found on the interior of the circular structure, opening at the S: it probably connected with the N aisles of the basilica. Columns and capitals (one a little impost with monogram) were located; also hundreds of marble sectilia, differently coloured, and the system for hanging the opus sectile. A L5th-E6th Ct AD date is confirmed, with many and major alterations over the next centuries. At the 10th Cretological Congress, A. Di Vita (Macerata; ACC 128) reported on stratigraphie work undertaken by M. Englezou on the odeion. This permits some of its history to be defined better. The Great Inscription, originally from a circular 5th Ct BC monument, had been reduced already by the time of Augustus and was further damaged in the 2n -3rd Ct AD destruction. Also at the time of Augustus, the arcades, fashioned in opera quadrata, divided the two ambulacra around the cavea; only the scena was restored at the time of Trajan (E2nd Ct); and a rebuild was carried out in the L2nd-E3rd Ct.</page><page sequence="111">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2006-2007 111 Demos Tymbakiou Hagioi Deka. M. Borboudakis (13th EBA; ADelt, 903) reports on continuing excavation at the Hagios Titos basilica in 1999. Work revealed the narthex and a circular construction at the N side of the great courtyard. The circular building is related typologically to those with eight internal divisions, between each of which stood a pillar. Chalara. M. Benzi (Pisa/SAIA) reports on the study season of 2006. This had the following aims: to complete the cleaning of the area SE of the palace of Phaistos; to produce a new topo graphical geo-referential map; to analyse the level of degradation of both the anc. structures and restoration works; and to consolidate previous studies of the site. Particular attention was given to the analysis of the preservation state of the buildings. Hagia Triada. Eleftherotypia (09/12/2006) and Ethnos (11/12/2006) report on a public lecture in Herakleion by M. Tsikritsis. He reviewed the mathematical abilities of the BA inhabitants of Crete, mentioning in particular a fractional system (down to 1/8): this was exemplified by a calculation scratched into the wall-plaster on a corridor of the villa at Hagia Triada, of Neopalatial date. V La Rosa (Catania; ADelt, 857) reports on the excavation and conservation of 1999 at the tholos tomb area. W and SW of the small rooms close to tholos A, work confirmed that the seriously disturbed nature of the soils (LRom, Venetian and mod. pits and trenches) prevented a proper understanding of the levels and the structures. Only one area produced EM deposits: it lies beneath a small structure (perhaps the first annexe, ?MM IA, for tholos A to the NE) and S of room 9. A large MM IA deposit yielded vessels involved with ceremonies for the dead, from rooms 1-10: conical cups, jugs, small plates and baking plates argue that food and drink were prepared and consumed. A wall erected in MM IA-B acted as a boundary, though later structures of MM II and MM III-LM I were then erected. A wall of cyclopean character, set directly on the ground surface, had been identified as part of the tholos periphery (preserved to 12.85m /. and up to 0.90m k). This was built when the tholos itself had already been partly dismantled: its date lies between LM III A and ProtoGeo times. It is assumed that it defines an area of worship in relation to the deserted tomb. Pitsidia. D. Hatzi-Vallianou (Archaeological Institute of Crete; ADelt, 906-10) reports on the excavation and study season of 1999 on the M agricultural complex or villa. A small amount of cleaning and excavation for photographic purposes was undertaken in three rooms (XVII, XXIV and XV). From the first a number of clay loomweights and a clay vessel of a sort said to be connected with working wool were recovered. Their recovery led to a postulation that the villa was connected in part with textile production, and that the N end of it was the women's preserve. An application for a covering for the site was prepared and submitted to KAS. Conservation, photography and other studies were carried out on large numbers of small finds (e.g., clay vessels, stone tools and metal objects), grouped according to their findspots. Organic materials were also dealt with: evidence for olive cultivation in LM I is noted. Kommos. J.W Shaw and M.C. Shaw (Toronto; ADelt, 857 59) report. 1999 saw much work in presenting to the public the results of the excavations. 2006 has been devoted to the maintenance of the site, to seeking new storage facilities in Pitsidia and to the completion of publication responsibilities. For the first, work has reinforced high scarps and walls in the S area. Plans are under way towards opening the site to the public: the most recent initiative is for a protective roof to arch over some 600m2 of the Gr temples and part of the best preserved M ashlar civic structures. In Pitsidia, efforts continue to purchase a plot for a storage facility large enough to house present material, with room for what any future excavation might unearth. The publication of Kommos V: The Monumental Minoan Buildings completes the volumes giving a broad-spectrum approach to the geomorphology and habitation history of the M harbour town and port, as well as the Gr sanctuary built upon the M ruins. Aspects of the Kommos site and its exploration are also featured in a popular book, Kommos, A Minoan Harbor Town and Greek Sanctuary. The study of the ?lite M house X progresses. Work continues to complete the Kommos Research Website (https://tspace.library.utoronto.ca/handle/1807/3004) where all the major publications are made available. WESTERN CRETE (Prefecture of Rethymnon) (25th EPCA; 28th EBA) M Andreadaki-Vlazaki and V. Niniou-Kindeli (25th EPCA) produced Apxa?oi t?ttoi Kai (jvr?(jE?a Nofjo?

Demos Geropotamou Pera Galinoi. E. Banou (25th EPCA) and E. Tsivilika (National Museum of Athens; ADelt, 867) report on an excavation at Trachiloi, where architectural remains and sherds prove the occupation of the area in M times. Demos Anogeon Zominthos. Y. Sakellarakis (ASA) reports (Ergon, 65-71, supplemented by To Vima [01/10/2006], Ta Nea [08/10/2006] and Eleftherotypia [14/10/2006]) on the excavation of the M settlement, conducted in collaboration with D. Panagiotopoulos (Heidelburg). The main focus in a settlement said to be bigger than Gournia is a two-storey central building (Fig. 128): with over 40 rooms on the ground floor (totaling 1,436m2), the walls at times 2.5-3m h., with doors and windows preserved, this inevitably has prompted comparisons with a palace. It dates to the Neopalatial, being destroyed by earthquake, probably in LM IA. At the NW is a room housing a potter's workshop: water cistern, wheelhead and tools, as well as an external kiln,</page><page sequence="112">112 JAMES WHITLEY ET AL. / / / / ^Sl^ / M 10 30 / / / ZOMINOOI / ApxatoAoyiKCw; xwpoq kch / KevxpiKO Krr?pto W7 W6 W5 W4 W3 W2 W1 El E2 E3 E4 E5 E6 E7 E8 ES 128. Zominthos: plan of site all confirm the identification. At least 150 whole vases (twelve decorated) sat on low benches on the W and S sides, and in a neighbouring room 100 more were stored; traces of a fire destruction were found in the last. Another room holds signs of further craft activity A third room (room 6) had plaster collapsed on to the floor: its decoration included red and deep blue stripes, and a curving black line delineating a red area with a black spot (Fig. 129). To this the excavators add the following details of the 2006 season. Work focused on four rooms of the N and NW. In room 6, at the NE on the N fa?ade, was revealed the layer of wall plaster, probably fallen from the floor of the room above. Room 6a, immediately W of the previous room, was also furnished with plaster. Room 10 belongs to the NW annex of the ceramic workshop. Its fill contained first stone slabs from an upper storey, above soils with vases, including an amphora and a pithoid jar, also a bird's nest bowl of serpentine. Room 21 yielded the most information. The upper layers contained schist stones and sediment that represents the infill of the room after its destruction by debris originating in the upper storey 129. Zominthos: central building, plaster collapsed on floor</page><page sequence="113">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2006-2007 113 Below the fill is dominated by large amounts of charcoal from a fire, especially so to the N. A rectangular construction of stones marks an area of burnt earth: this, with associated bones and vessels (e.g., six tripod cooking pots) signifies it to be a place where food was prepared. To the W may have been a shelf and a bench. The 80 vessels were overwhelmingly of conical cups, jugs and jars; three pithoi were probably fallen from an upper floor. Tiny bits of lead, bronze and silver/tin were recovered. Site mapping, a local survey and an exploration of the geological and environmental setting of the site are all under way. A geomagnetic survey and geological boring are intended. Beneath the structure are traces of a Protopalatial one, and on it was later built a Venetian edifice (1500 AD) for cheese production. Elsewhere in the settlement later houses of the time of the Myc presence in the LM era were noted. Demos Arkadiou Eleutherna. N. Stamboulides (Crete; Goulandris Museum of Cyc Art) lectured at the Italian School: his topic was reported in Ethnos, Thema and Eleftherotypia (10/11/2006). He linked finds, of 8th and 7th Ct dates, from the cemetery of Orthi Petra (mostly of young men), with the so-called shields from the Idaian cave: namely tripod cauldrons and their covers ('shields'). He wove three inter-connecting themes in his argument: their use as receptacles of the cremated dead; their employment as cooking vessels (perhaps for boiled bull or ram in a broth) for particular rites-of-passage; and the iconography displayed that involved deities responsible for such transitions (e.g., boys entering the world of grown men, or the crossing from this life into the next). Pigi. E. Gavrilaki (25 EPCA) offers a preliminary report on rescue excavations in 2005-2006, undertaken at Choirai on the Litina plot. A pithos cemetery was revealed, though not fully excavated: it is unique in this part of Crete. Sixteen burials inside pithoi of MM I date were revealed at the E of the plot (Fig. 130). Of varying sizes, their deposition was on a tight SW/NE axis, though without any consistent orientation. Set on their sides, each in a shallow and carelessly dug pit, the pithoi were held firmly in place by small rocks. Their mouths were closed by stones, vessels or parts of vessels (Fig. 131). Some of them have rope decoration, whilst others are painted. Burial customs of this period are illuminated from the finds located inside some pithoi or used as their lids. At least fifteen clay vessels were found, among them cups, bowls, juglets, cooking vessels and a small pithos-like vase. Two beads, one of silver and the other rock crystal (?), were retrieved, as well as a small birds nest bowl of stone inside pithos 11. 131. Pigi: detail of burial y *&lt; ?^fi*' 1m 130. Pigi: plan of site ?;- /?^AOr</page><page sequence="114">114 JAMES WHITLEY ET AL. Between burials 9 and 10 was located an 'empty' pit, otherwise just like those excavated for the pithoi, with many traces of burning therein. Its mouth seemed to have been defined by stones, as a slab found in situ demonstrates. Sherds from a cooking vessel were picked up from within it. The ground level of the tombs was built over by a later wall (up to 0.80m vu), in some spots preserved for two to three courses. Constructed of large, rough stones, carelessly placed on a NW/SE alignment, it was but partly preserved. An inter mittent spread of small stones corresponded to the top of the wall, as preserved. The layer of redrbrown earth associated with the wall contained abundant MM, a fair amount of LM III and a little mod. pottery. This discovery contributes to the better understanding of the archaeological picture of the area of Pigi, where two chamber like tombs of LM were earlier dug. Demos Sybritou Monastiraki. A, Kanta (Institute of Cretan Studies) reports on the 2006 excavation season at the M palatial centre. Attention was focused on the foundations of the E part of the complex to clarify architectural phases. New plans were made using laser scan technology, in collaboration with the Istituto Universitario Suor Orsola Benincasa (Naples). As seen now, the E complex has primarily a storage (Fig. 132) and craft character: but this is true only of its last phase (MM IIB). The monument was created with a more monumental conception, involving a long corridor with plaster and slab floors (Fig. 133). Subsequently its storage capacity was increased; it acquired a less careful appearance. Demos Rethymnis Stavromenos. M. Andreadaki-Vlazaki (25th EPCA; ADelt, 866-67) reports on a coastal survey in the region in 1999. A seaside settlement has been established here for a long time: the old harbour establishments are probably now below sea level, as a result, in all likelihood, of the massive earthquake of 365 AD when the uplift of the W of Crete was matched by the plunging of the N. At Palaiokastro, EM I/II, MM I, LM I and III material was all found; in the last phase there was a greater occupation of the hills of Chamelevri to the S. Development of the harbour zone is seen in the 4th Ct BC and Hel era. Armenoi. Y Tzedakis (Honorary General Director of Antiquities) and H. Martlew (BSA) report on the publication of the LM II1A-B cemetery. In addition to the basic themes of research, specialist studies are being conducted on a number of points. A. Gize (Manchester) has worked on potential sources for the minerals, metals, clay beds and pigments. R. Arnott (Birmingham) and D. Watson (Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology, Leipzig) are combining a study of the human skeletal remains with an environmental one for the local area. This coupling is hoped to throw light on aspects of the diet and health of those buried and the activity of certain disease vectors. Maroula. E. Papadopoulou (25th EPCA; ACC 33) reports on excavations carried out over several years at a cemetery. A number of chamber tombs of LM IIIA-B date have been dug, part of a larger burial ground long known. Taken together they form one of the largest necroploeis in W Crete, after Armenoi and Chania. 132. Monastiraki: MM II vessel 133. Monastiraki: corridor with plaster and slab floor Hagio Pnevma, Vrysinas. I. Tzachili (Crete), E. Papadopoulou (25th EPCA) and K. Sbonias (lonion; ACC 40) report on the excavation of the peak sanctuary and accompa nying survey carried out since 2004, as a synergasia between the 25th EPCA and the University of Crete. The excavation, on mount Vrysinas at 858m asl, began on the N slope on three terraces. The highest is occupied by a small 17th Ct church; the next is quite narrow, at only some 3m w. and is characterized by outcrops of the bedrock with shallow earth deposits between them; the lowest is very wide. Excavation concentrated on the 2nd and 3rd terraces. The stratigraphy was uniform, with three levels: the surface, at 10 15cm d., consisted of dark brown, loose earth with small stones, and yielded finds of Med and Emod. times. Below was a MM level with an often undisturbed deposit of figurines and vases: placed in the available spaces between the projections in the bedrock or in cracks in it. The lowest was pure, brownish-red with very few finds: this is the natural undisturbed earth in the area. Over 600 clay anthropomorphic and zoomorphic figurines have been found, the majority of them in fragments. Although most are animal figurines, there is a significant quantity of humans both female and male (Fig. 134), the height of which does not usually exceed 10-15cm. They represent a wide</page><page sequence="115">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2006-2007 115 variety of types, in which particular emphasis is laid on the elaborate coiffure, the hats and the clothing. One notable find consists of a complete bronze figurine of an adorant. The zoomorphic figurines are almost all bovines, some double headed (Fig. 135); most of them are solid and about 15cm /. Fragments of hollow figurines (Fig. 136) were turned up: when intact, they will have been up to 60cm /. Most of the pottery is broken and badly damaged. The few whole pots are mainly braziers (Fig. 137) and juglets. Amongst the other pottery fragments, cups, bowls, skyphoi and a few jugs can be recognized, as well as coarse ware cooking pots. Preliminary study of the material suggests that the pottery dates from the MM II and III periods down to LM IA. The bulk of it belongs to MM III. 134. Vrysinas: human figurine 135. Vrysinas: double-headed bovine figurine 136. Vrysinas: hollow bull figurine 137. Vrysinas: brazier These preliminary conclusions indicate that the use of the sanctuary goes back to the Old Palace period, was intensified in the New Palace period and seems to come to an end immediately afterwards, during the LM IA phase. Alongside the excavation, a surface survey was conducted under the supervision of K. Sbonias. This covered an area up to a km across in the surrounding area; it had the following aims: to establish the boundaries of the sanctuary; to search for access routes/paths up to the summit of the mountain and by extension to the sanctuary; and to locate any natural distur bances (water courses, erosion) that might have dispersed the anc. material. During the course of this survey, material dating from LM IIIC was located very close to the sanctuary. WESTERN CRETE (Prefecture of Chania) (25th EPCA; 28th EBA) Demos Georgioupoleos Neos Kournas (Kavros). N. Karamaliki (25th EPCA; ADelt, 863-65) reports on a Rom bath complex continuing to be excavated in 1999. A few wall remains of an earlier 1st Ct AD building underlie the main concentration of walls to the E. The best preserved phase of the lst-E2nd Ct AD consists of parts of at least four rooms. The biggest (8m by 7m) has an earth floor associated with tesserae and wall-painting; other rooms and a staircase have floors of plaster and fresco fragments from the walls (red with black bands). An apse produced further plaster floors, mosaics and fresco fragments. The third phase, of the L3th E4th Ct AD, is harder to comprehend, partly as a result of re used wall lines and materials: one wall has small semi-circular projections. Parts of water channels exist: one of brick and closed, the other of stone and open.</page><page sequence="116">116 JAMES WHITLEY ET AL. To the W is a well, set in a pit. The pit is filled with debris dumped there from two renovations following destructions suffered by the baths: one dates to the 2nd Ct, the other to the 4th Ct. They are separated by clean earth. The well itself (external di. 4.50m, internal 1.80m) is built of stone and re-used bricks. An abutting wall and associated floor show that the whole has a date at some undefined point after the 4th Ct AD. Demos Soudas ?ptera. The following is put together from a report by V Niniou-Kindeli (25th EPCA), incorporating also the article in Eleftherotypia (06/10/2006), on excavations between 2003 2006 that were focused on the fortifications. See also her and Y. Christodoulakos' article, ' Peona ?kti AnT?pa. Mia TTpcoTr) TTpoa?yylar|, Creta Romana e Protobizantina. Atti del Congresso internazionale II (Padova, Bottega D'Erasmo 2004: 313-27). The whole 4km /. perimeter of the fortifications was cleaned, with systematic excavation focused on the central part of the W side: construction was just before the M4th Ct BC. Six towers have been discovered so far, most on the W and N sides. The only one excavated to its base is rectangular and is set askew to the wall line. Outside the wall were found continuous layers of fallen stone blocks, most still in rows; a phenomenon mainly due to the destructive earthquakes of the 4l and 7th Cts AD. A small gate was revealed. N of the tower were found burials of newborn children, linked with pits containing evidence of ritual fires, burnt vessels for liquids, plates, metal items, vegetable produce (seeds) and animal bones. Dating in the 2nd half of 4th Ct, they were positioned at the junction of the wall with the tower. Evidence for the most intense activity known for the Hel and Rom times lies just beyond the small gate in a zone delimited by a paved street, running N to the main entrance of the town. Close by the gate, as well as levels containing the debris of fighting, were located small burial receptacles associated with A n T E PA r ^ ^e?iM^ ^ ^iS^*??"; y ^&amp;. ,^ ..t 138. ?ptera: plan of funerary monument</page><page sequence="117">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2006-2007 117 remains of pyres and sherds mainly of the Hel period; some held bones of young children. At the wall junction was a series of layers containing lamps, mainly of the 2nd and Elst Cts BC, also plates, miniature skyphoi, jugs and cups, as well as animal bones, horns and an amount of carbon and ashes. These remnants are probably derived from ritual activity, possibly taking place at night. A large funerary monument (Fig. 138), with an underground burial chamber, was revealed in the same area. The step-like foundation course is the only part remaining in situ above ground. The most important find was part of the architrave with the inscription: Icorqpio? TTpcoToyEvriooc E?Eu?Epvaio? ETTOtEL The style of the lettering dates the inscription to the L3rd or E2nd Ct BC, a period when the two cities shared an alliance. The burial chamber, leading to which is a paved road with steps via an ante-room, has four built receptacles. The quality of the construction impresses: large blocks of poros limestone in regular courses and and other patterns make up the side walls up to the roof This last was composed of monolithic slabs of poros. The room and the ante room could be closed by doors. Despite looting, enough finds were found in the room and the ante-room that date the continuous use of the monument from the 2nd Ct BC to the 2nd CtAD. A second and attached monument was located to the E, dating a bit later than the first. It was completely looted during the lx CtAD, when a group of Ch tombs was constructed just next to it. A fallen marble slab, with the busts of a couple, was found next to the monument's foundations. Of the Trajanic era and of good quality, this sculpture must have been set up inside the monument: it provides a reliable source for its dating to the 1st CtAD. K. Tzanakaki (25th EPCA; ACC 122) adds further details from the W cemetery. She reports many types of tombs: hewn from the bedrock, cists, simpler pits and chamber tombs. They cover the LAr to Rom period, with traces of earlier internments from the LGeo and Ar. The plentiful ceramics are mostly of local production, with imports from Attica and Corinth. V Niniou-Kindeli (25th EPCA; ATM) summarizes work in the town. The city is seen as a successful commercial centre, based on its twin harbours; its citizens also acted as mercenaries and even pirates. Founded in the 8th Ct BC, it reached the zenith of its powers in the 4nd Ct and again in the 1st to 2nd Ct AD. Affected first by the earthquake of 365 BC, it was deserted in the 7nd Ct AD after yet another massive upheaval. Monuments singled out for mention are 5th Ct BC temple to Aphrodite and Apollo; 4th Ct walls; 1st Ct temple to Demeter and Persephone; the Hagios Ioannis Monastery and an Ot castle. The W cemetery is extensive, with different types of tombs covering the 8th Ct BC to the 3rd Ct AD, as well as 6th and 7th Ct ECh burials. An ERom house has rooms built around a courtyard with peristylon. There are Rom baths and large cisterns; a 'heroon' memorial and two mausoleums (Rom, 1st to 2nd Ct AD), in one of which were found the marble portraits of the owners. Demos Armenon Stylos. M. Andreadaki-Vlazaki (25th EPCA; ADelt, 861-63) reports on two farmsteads investigated by survey and excavation in 1999. That of Mastrantonaki revealed settlement during M and Rom times: a pithos and a lamp of the 1st Ct AD, That of Kourakis, away to the SE, has plentiful surface evidence of occupation (pottery and structural remains) from several periods up to the ECh period. Tombs were also found. Demos Chanion Chania. M. Andreadaki-Vlasaki (25th EPCA) observes that the increasing replacement of the old houses by multi-storeyed apartments, infilling of vacant plots, public works and the consequent rigorous investigation of all such activities by the 25th EPCA has lead to notable advances in the understanding of the past. She reports that during 2006, three major excavations in the city of Chania shed light on unknown eras of the anc. settlement of Kydonia, historical and PH alike. Large-scale excavation (in the Agrotiki Bank plot in O. Skalidi, by L. Limandzaki, assisted by M Lefakis and M. Miglakis), at the W end of the anc. city, produced antiquities of different periods: Geo, Ar, Cl, Hel and Rom, as well as from the Ot occupation. Of many and various periods were the delvings for quarrying/extraction of clay, to bury rubbish and dig wells. The presence of burials of Ar and Cl times helps confirm this as the W city limits. Underground constructions, related to supplying water to this part of the city, and other activities, were revealed at the N: they date probably to the EHel or LCI periods. Another important discovery was part of the street going W from the city to the countryside: its surface was earthen, to either side stood LCI and Hel buildings. Two impressive pottery kilns of the Llst to E2nd Ct AD, similar in structural details to contemporary kilns from E Crete and the P?loponn?se, complete the picture (Fig. 139). In these kilns were fired narrow-based amphorae of the AC la type, as examples found in situ inside the kilns, as well as from a very 139. Chania: contents of kiln 140. Chania: MM I settlement</page><page sequence="118">118 JAMES WHITLEY ET AL. extensive rubbish pit, both prove. Such vessels have also been found in other Cretan sites, e.g., Falassarna, Kisamos, Nopigeia, ?ptera, Loutro, Eleftherna, Knossos and Keratokampos. Their large numbers in Kydonia, and now the tracking down of the manufacturing centre itself, link the city with this specific type and its possible use in trading local wine. The city as an important and abiding centre for the production and trading of wine is also alluded to in Kydonian coinage, where, in some cases, amphorae are depicted on the reverse. Trenches were opened on the S side of the city walls (Kydonia's acropolis) and on O. Karaoli Demetiou (by E. Protopapadaki and M. Boutsoukakis). Immediately contingent to the foundations of the 4th Ct BC wall, part of the MM IA settlement was revealed, composed of small rectangular rooms, densely packed and below ground (Fig. 140). Below the mod. pavement was located part of an earthen street of the Neopalatial M settlement, running from the shrine in the area of O. Daskalogianni towards the sea. Remarkably, a waste-water pipe ofthat date, sealed with clay, still runs here alongside its mod. counterpart. The street was used until the end of the M period, accumulating a continuous sequence of surfaces. Systematic excavation was undertaken on the hill of Kastelli. The opportunity arose from the generous waiving of his interests by Y. Tzedakis (Honorary General Director of Antiquities) in favour of M. Andreadaki-Vlasaki. In 2005, the 'Sevach' plot (Fig. 141) was explored (by the same pairing as the previous). (This is situated near the plot in Katre Street where in 1973 I. Papapostolou discovered the Linear A archive, which refers mainly to inventories of products imported into the LM I centre.) Remains of various habitation phases were revealed, the most impressive of which were the remains of the LM IB settlement. The finds clarified the nature of the Neopalatial settlement's destruction at the end of LM IB (Fig. 142). An open-air space once dedicated to the preparation of food and meals, as indicated by the presence of cooking vessels and scattered fireplaces, held a destruction stratum 0.50m d., bright red and black in colour, and full of debris from the roof tops of adjacent buildings. A large quantity of some burnt and greasy substance, arguably derived from stores of olive oil, was found, as well as bones, shells and a quantity of burnt seeds. All this was wet-sieved: the valuable and rich archaeobotanical material isolated is being studied by A. Sarpaki. Comparison of such organic remains with the information garnered from the Linear A tablets is hoped to lead to valuable conclusions. Most of the clay vessels retrieved were on the surface of the above mentioned open-air space (Fig. 143). Here too part of the frame from a double window was picked up. During the 2006 campaign at 'Sevach' two main construc tion phases of the Neopalatial building were isolated (Fig. 141): MM III and LM IB. The initial building was built in MM III, when extended construction works are also observed on the hill of Kastelli and Splantzia.

Chania: LM I vases characterized by deep foundations for strong walls, together indicating two storeys. The floor was carefully constructed, paved or covered with clay or small pieces of sandstone and broken sea shells. The bases of the entrance door jambs are of sandstone. In general, one observes the clear depth of archi tectural knowledge, exceptional grasp of spatial arrangement and luxurious standards that characterize the buildings of the initial Neopalatial phase at Chania. Modifications and inter ventions on a smaller scale are traceable during the 2nd, LM IA phase, whilst more extensive changes are observed during the 3rd, LM IB phase. By now, indeed, completely new and different arrangements of spaces are being created inside the initial building. Of great interest are the open-air and semi roofed spaces (A-H), arranged in a step-like way; these suggest at times that living was carried on upstairs, leaving the ground floors free for various specialized purposes. The chemical analysis, by N. Maravelaki, of samples of burnt sandstone and mudbricks - materials used heavily in the LM IB constructions - have shown that a temperature between 600 and 800 degrees C was reached in the destruction of this quarter. This is a temperature high enough to calcine the calcareous sandstones and alter the chemical composition of the clays present in the bricks. In 2006, an excavation was begun on a large plot N of and adjacent to the S wall of Kydonia's acropolis, opposite the plot of O. Katre (Fig. 144). The thick layers of anc. debris here should bring to light important evidence on the PH and historical settlement (from EM I to LM IIIC; and from Geo to Rom): especially with regard to problems related to the construction, repair and reconstruction of the acropolis' anc. fortifications. During the first period of excavation, work focused on preparing the ground: a thick layer of 20th Ct rubbish was taken away. The first strata that came to light are Rom in date. These layers, as well as the deeper Hel ones, did not reveal any building remains. The first architectural remains are dated to the Ar period. Geo pits and LM IIIC layers were located further down. Again from the town, M. Andreadaki-Vlazaki (25r EPCA; ADelt, 860-61) reports on excavation carried out in 1999. In O. Apokoronou, a great range of structures was found, running up to Plateia Kolokotronis, which seems to mark the S edge of the settlement. The latest finds were an Ot road and a Venetian closed aqueduct. Various foci of walls, floors and rooms were sampled, broadly covering the Cl, Hel and Rom periods, at times with multiple phases of construction. Clay vessels, loomweights and bronze items constitute the general range of material; from Hel contexts came a bronze coin, a lead object and a scarab, and a well. A per?bolos wall of Hel date marks out a likely cistern. Some large Rom houses were found here and also at the O. Venizelou and O. Archontaki junction, the last with a mosaic. Demos Platanias Vryses. E. Kataki (25r EPCA; ATM) summarizes the site, probably to be identified with anc. Polichna. The cave of Spiliotissa with eight chambers yielded pottery of Neo, Prepalatial (Pyrgos ware) M and LM, also of L antiquity and Med: it was used as a shelter and perhaps for cult, though 144. Chania: new trenches near acropolis S wall</page><page sequence="120">120 JAMES WHITLEY ET AL. burials were also found. LM I house (at least six rooms) has storage (pithoi) and kitchen (cups, amphorae and cooking vessels; bones and ash) spaces. The cult place of the 5th to 4 Ct BC to Demeter and Persephone has many figurines (women seated and with hydriae; animals such as pig and snake) and vessels (kernoi; bf and rf hydriae) in black burnt soil. There are rock-shelters with layers of ash in the soils, some little M and Cl pottery, most Hel-Rom, along with sea shells and animal bones. Sundry other finds include buildings and LM-ProtoGeo tombs, one of the last with notable finds in bronze. Demos Moussouron Prases. M. Andreadaki-Vlazaki (25th EPCA; ADelt, 861) reports on finds made in 1999 at Petra tou Voskou, an upland site in the W foothills of the White mountains. A scatter of pottery and figurines of Hel date reveal the site of a small outdoor shrine set in a clear location. Two hundred metres away are the remains of a house of the historical period. Demos Kissamou Kisamos. For Hel-Rom Kisamos, see Markoulaki, S., G. Christodoulakos and C. Fragkonikolaki, 'H apxaia Kioayios Kai r) 7To?Eo5oniKr| *rr|? opy?vcoori' Creta Romana e Protobizantina II (Padova, Bottega D'Erasmo 2004: 355-74); and Diamantis, N., 'To naXaioxpi?TiaviKO vEKpoTa9E?cvrr|s K?aaiaou' (in the same volume: 383-96). S. Markoulaki (25th EPCA) reports on a wide-reaching programme to excavate and present aspects of the Hel-Rom urban settlement. The work was carried out between 2004 2006, though the baths still require more attention. On five plots characteristic samples of villas of the anc. city; thermai/baths; and a Rom cemetery have been revealed. Of the urban/civic villas, three examples are mentioned. The first lies in the courtyard of Kisamos Cathedral. Here was revealed the atrium of a civic villa of Tuscan type (without columns), with its impluvium paved in marble slabs. Around is a mosaic depicting sea animals executed in a restricted palette. On the W is an open-air courtyard with two built waterpipes (running N-S), under which and below ground passes E-NW another for the impluvium. A small ante-room on the N side also has a mosaic floor. The structure dates to the L 1st or E2nd Ct AD. No earlier phases were found. The second example was unearthed in the excavations, beginning in 1984, to the W and N of the present health centre of Kisamos. Here a large part of a 'named' civic villa has emerged, with six mosaics. It exhibits two main phases. One is L2nd Ct AD (the House of Feidias, taken from an inscription on a mosaic) and is a renovation and artistic reformation of an older structure of the same Ct. The other phase belongs later to the 3rd Ct AD and marks a period of extension of the villa. New wings extend it to the boundaries of the main roads nearby, probably to the extent of occupying an entire insula. It now has a narrow and long peristyle courtyard with a drainage system, a second auxiliary courtyard, onto which opened the cooking areas, and a self-contained private bath, and at least two atria (one is in unexcavated property to the N) from which sprang triclinia (rooms for symposia). Deeper digging revealed a pottery kiln belonging to the 1st Ct workshop that existed here before the villa. Its existence was fully confirmed during the excavations of 1986-1987: many finds are associated. A semi underground space of the villa itself extends under the adjoining municipal (?) road to the W. The third example (in the former Raisaki plot) involves a 'periastiki' villa (one built in the vicinity of the town) rather than another urban sort; the plot also produced evidence of an anc. street and an ECh cemetery (see below). The villa dates from the end of the 2nd to the E3rd Ct AD. Excavation revealed first an interior peristyle courtyard with its drainage system, onto which opened an arched room (triclinium) with a mosaic floor depicting Orpheus and an extremely interesting scene of a wedding; then two cubicula (small bedrooms) with destroyed mosaic floors and, finally, a hall, perhaps the tablinum, with a new mosaic floor partly preserved (part of the geometric frame and a small part depicting birds remain) under the ECh tombs. Trials located parts of walls of an older phase of the villa, as well as of an earlier habitation settlment. The E thermai/baths, excavated in 1966-1967 (by K. Davaras), revealed a luxurious room with fallen domes, a floor and wall decoration of white marble slabs. A marble statue of a young satyr (now exhibited in the Kissamos Archaeological Museum) was recovered. All this belonged to a group of public baths (thermai) on the E side of the anc. city. Additional excavation enhanced the picture: wash basins from the cold bath area and three adjoining auxiliary spaces (probably changing rooms) were recovered, again under fallen domes and a mass of debris. The function of the rooms to the W also became clear. The main entrance was probably on the E side: a hypostyle hall with large, now fallen, granite columns. The three main rooms have been identified as the caldarium (hot bath) to the W, as Vitruvius advised; the tepidarium (warm bath) in the middle; and the frigidarium (cold plunge) on the E. The warmer rooms were heated by hypocausts; the little columns of superimposed discs (pilea) from this system are well-preserved in the tepid bath area. All rooms have floors paved with marble. Marble decorated the walls too, at least up to a certain height, with frescoes taking over thereafter (several painted pieces of plaster have been found). The largest and most beautiful room, with its marble wash basins on the N and S, is the room of the cold bath. The roofing domes, the arches of which spanned E-W, fell down en masse due to the terrible earthquake of 365 AD. Under one of these huge chunks was found a second marble statue, of Pan, broken but all present. Into the S wash basin had collapsed a large column. In the Raisaki plot, again in 1992, were also revealed parts of a paved, public street running E-W (perhaps the decumanus) and an ECh cemetery. This last lay over the top of the villa's remains, on its N and NE parts. Used from the end of the 4th to the E6th Ct AD, the cemetery was well laid out, with built chest-type tombs, covered with pebbles and bearing funeral inscriptions. One of them has a mosaic cover depicting the Chi-Rho symbol. M. Andreadaki-Vlazaki (25th EPCA; ADelt, 865-66) remarks on excavation on the Rokakis plot in 1999. Excavation by a mechanical digger revealed to the N structural remains, partly destroyed by two large pits: an E-W wall of dressed stones and lime mortar dated to the LRom period, it was partly set over a rubbish pit, whose scanty pottery dated it to Hel and Rom times. Pano Kamara/Kisamos. N. Paterakis (25th EPCA; ACC 118? 19) reports, at the 10th Cretological Congress, on a Rom and ECh cemetery. The majority of tombs are chamber tombs, mostly Rom. Some L in that period run alongside a metalled street; others are found to the S and W of a large tholos monument. Only a couple were undisturbed, but yielded finds of some quality:</page><page sequence="121">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 2006-2007 121 lamps, amphorae, glass vases and gold objects. The tholos monument has an entrance, two small ante-chambers and a larger one at the centre; the underground portion has a groined vault. Yet more chamber tombs to the N, alongside the Rom, were used by the first Ch inhabitants. He also remarks on the existence of a tomb of the 'Punic' sort. KOINOTITA GAVDOU Gavdos, Siopata. K. Kopaka (Crete) reports on a M burial excavated in 2004, at Sto Papouro, on a hill. The pithos, painted, was set on its side in an E-W orientation, within a depression cut into the soft, limestone bedrock (Fig. 145). A small wall of stones protected its mouth, and another small slab its base. Inside were the skeletal remains, reasonably preserved, of an adult, in a crouched position; the head towards the rim of the vessel. The body was accompanied only by a fine stone bowl. The pithos (of L MM or E LM date) was 0.83m in h., with a maximum di. of 0.64m: it recalls those in the Messara pottery production, but is made of local clay. The burial was isolated, as further trial trenches opened revealed, but perhaps it is associated with a relatively large building nearby, which has been under investigation since 2005. A few more pithoi, perhaps funerary too, are recorded around the island. This find not only provides the first PH inhumation so far excavated on Gavdos, but also, and importantly, highlights and confirms the practice of pithos burials on this remote micro insular territory. Thus the small island of Gavdos is added to the distribution map of such burials around the M2nd millennium BC: a funerary habit well-attested in the PH E Mediterranean, without being universally adopted. In Eleftherotypia (03/10/2006), K. Kopaka (Crete) reports the recovery of 766 stone finds from the Pal era (before 10,000 BC) from 32 locations on the island. The finds are dated from aspects of both their shape and method of production; and will re-open the vexed and vital question on the earliest human inhabitants to settle Crete. 145.
