<plain_text><page sequence="1">Wigley, Mark. The Architecture of Deconstruction: Derrida's Haunt. Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 1993. Pp. 278. Based on a 1986 doctoral thesis submitted to the University of Auckland, Mark Wigley's The Architecture of Deconstruction: Derrida's Haunt is, in the author's words, "a reading of the architectural argument embedded within Derrida's work before he addressed architecture as such." With the exception of the first two paragraphs, which recount Derrida's 1985 involvement with the architect Bernard Tschumi on the Parc de la Villette project for Paris, the "architecture" Wigley concerns himself with is architecture as metaphor for deconstruction. Wigley contends that "When Derrida describes 'deconstruc- tion,' which he rarely does (and then only after a marked hesitation and the taking of many precautions), it is usually in architectural terms." This book, then, reviews the pre-1985 writings of Derrida "to locate the architecture that is written into them and cannot be detached." It in no way directly addresses a tangible, built architecture or--as its carefully contrived title might suggest- that contemporary style of architecture which has come to be known as "deconstructive." Wigley begins by setting out a number of preliminary precautions regard- ing the nature of deconstruction. Predictably, these specify mostly what deconstruction is not. What deconstruction is, Wigley says, is "a strange struc- tural condition, an ongoing structural event, a continuous displacement of structure that cannot be evaluated in traditional terms because it is the very frustration of those terms." It does not seek to replace the traditional account of architecture, but to question it, to displace traditional thinking about ar- chitecture. It does so by unearthing "the repressive mechanisms by which other senses are hidden within (rather than behind or underneath) that tradi- SubStance #78, 1995</page><page sequence="2">154 Reviews tional figure." It seeks to render the "overt discourse about architecture" as an orchestrated repression of these "constitutional enigmas." At the same time, architecture appeals to deconstruction (that ongoing structural event) as a metaphor of philosophy itself. A certain reflexivity is thus built into the equa- tion. What philosophy makes of architecture, philosophy makes of itself. Hence, the often psychoanalytic tone of the deconstructive reading. This being the case, it is not surprising that it is Derrida's reading of Heidegger that provides occasion for his entry into architecture. Often Heideg- ger describes philosophy in terms of architecture, even to the point of explicitly equating the two in his renowned "Building, Dwelling, Thinking." From this, and from Heidegger's reading of Kant's Critique, Wigley concludes that "the philosopher is first and foremost an architect, endlessly attempting to produce a grounded structure." The history of philosophy, it follows, is "a series of substitutions for structure." This sets the stage for Wigley's extensive and intelligent account of Derrida's reconstruction and deformation of Heidegger's architecture. It also places the foundation for Wigley's own "reading" of Der- rida, a reading announced in the book's title-Derrida's Haunt--but promoted only in the second half of the book. Perhaps the most engaging and accessible section of the book is that which views Derrida's work as a "theorizing of space." Here Wigley incisively describes how Derrida's argument "engages with its own space, subjecting itself to what it describes, making itself an example of what it addresses... embedding the text in the very spaces it appears to read." As Wigley examines Derrida's concern with the space and spacing of writing, with the space of inscription, he offers us a way of seeing writing. Seeing writing engages the reader as active participant in a Derrida reading. We experience deconstruc- tion. We see what Derrida means. In so doing, we understand deconstruction as a process or event. The architecture of philosophy is rendered apparent. In the latter part of the book, Wigley begins to assert his own reading regarding Derrida's deconstruction, which he views as a specific kind of ar- chitecture: a haunted house. This he does quietly, more as overtone or vapor than structure. One ascertains only a slight scent of a thesis, as if the author were too shy to insist, or feared violating deconstruction protocol, or perhaps seeks to imbue the book with a ghost-like presence. "The irrepressible haunt- ing of space, the spectral economy of the haunted house that underpins Derrida's work without ever being its apparent subject, is first and foremost the enigmatic movements of displacement or dislocation," Wigley claims. "Derrida's essays are everywhere concerned with the question of place. .." In Wigley's presentation of his reading of Derrida, one senses a kind of "spectral economy," a very distinct absence of an "apparent subject." The architecture-related writings of Derrida are clearly present and one is inclined to think that this is all Wigley offers us, a neat compilation. He himself would seem to eschew interpretation. But interpretation can be found in the writings SubStance #78, 1995</page><page sequence="3">Reviews 155 he selects, in the order he imposes on those writings, and most obviously (and disturbingly) in the curious and overly clever titles he gives to chapters and sections. The labeling of these packages in sensational, often anthropomorphic terms--"disfiguring the house," "interior violence," "throwing up architec- ture," "the taste of Derrida," "the indigestion of the house," "the disgusting truth," "doing the twist," "the subject of vomit"-reflect his attempt to build into a "body" Derrida's architecture of deconstruction. Doing so would serve both to make this account his account and to render it as a coherent and understandable unity, intellectual as well as sensual. Yet such would also offer what he himself insists Derrida always avoids, "the illusory coherence of a conceptual system." To mask or vaporize this imposition, then, is as it should be, given Wigley's unquestioning subscription to deconstruction. In place of a concluding chapter-"(deconstruction being, of course, anything but con- clusive)"-Wigley offers the requisite apologies and acknowledges all the shortcomings of his approach: the narrowness of his reading, the violence done to Derrida's work by extracting architecture from it, the lack of a larger context. Each of his moves, including this self-effacing finale, is predictable, almost formulaic. And when faced with this and with Wigley's unfortunate tendency to express himself in Derrida-esque style (his rendition of Derrida double-speak is truly unconvincing), one is almost inclined to interpret it allas tongue-in-cheek mimicry. In the end, Wigley is simply not sinuous enough to pull it off. And it is the obvious failure of his presentation, not the material presented, that constitutes the book's gravest fault. In dosing, one wants to reiterate that despite its publication by MIT Press, its author's status as assistant professor of architecture, and its promotion in architectural bookstores, The Architecture of Deconstruction is a book of literary criticism. Written in a pseudo-philosophical manner by a Derrida admirer trained as an architect, the book is nevertheless not without its benefits. The author is obviously quite intelligent, his enterprise worthwhile (more so to Derridaologists than to architects, I suspect), his discussion of the work often engaging if not insightful. But it must be made clear that what Wigley does best in this book is to sift through Derrida's early writings in search of refer- ences to or suggestions of architecture. Whether this "tracking," as the author calls it, is of interest or simply tedious largely depends on the droppings Wigley finds along the trail, not on his explanation of them or in the peculiar labels he gives the boxes he fabricates to house them. The service he has performed, I suspect, will benefit literary critics and perhaps architectural historians and theorists, though probably less so immediately than at some time in the future, when this curious conjunction of architecture and philosophy can be seen as part of a larger whole.
