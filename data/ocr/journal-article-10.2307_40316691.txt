<plain_text><page sequence="1">Fossil Bear Bones in the Belgian Upper Paleolithic: The Possibility of a Proto Bear-Ceremonialism Mietje Germonpré and Riku Hàmàlàinen Abstract. This paper examines several fossil bear bones from Upper Paleolithic deposits recov- ered from Belgian caves. The bones exhibit traces of ochre. The paper examines the archaeologi- cal and archaeozoological data in detail, comparing the finds with other sites containing fossil bear remains and identifying patterns suggesting purposeful staining of bear bones. These pat- terns are compared with ethnographic examples of bear ceremonialism. On the basis of similari- ties found in these analyses, the authors argue that a proto bear-ceremonialism existed during the Upper Paleolithic. Introduction Bear symbolism is widespread throughout tradi- tional northern hunting societies and is thought to extend far back in time (Alexejenko 1963; Hallowell 1926; Paproth 1976; Sokolova 2000; Vasilev 1948). Several bear species are implicated: the brown bear Ursus arctos (e.g., Jordan 2003), the American black bear Ursus americanus (e.g., Skinner 1911) and the polar bear Ursus mariti- mus (e.g., Larsen 1969/1970). During the Weichse- lian (from c. 115,000 B.P. to 11,700 B.P. (Rahmstorf 2002; Rasmussen et al. 2006) another species, the cave bear, roamed Europe from the Atlantic coast to the Ural Mountains. South Belgium, with its limestone caves, was the most northwestern out- post of this extinct species (Baryshnikov, Germon- pré, and Sablin 2003). At the end of the eighteenth century the cave bear was recognized as a sepa- rate species, and named Ursus spelaeus (Rosen- muller 1794). Since then, several hypotheses have been proposed to explain how cave bear bones ac- cumulated in caves (Kurtén 1976). In the first half of the twentieth century, Bachler (1920-21, 1923, 1940) and Hormann (1923, 1933) excavated sev- eral caves where they discovered burnt cave bear remains, broken bear bones, and skulls on or under rock slabs or in niches. They interpreted the broken bones as tools and surmised that prehis- toric people deposited the skulls in these special places. They also made ethnographic compari- sons between their findings and the practices of modern-day hunting societies. On the basis of these considerations, they concluded that a cave bear cult existed during the Middle Paleolithic, which they saw as part of a specialized culture based on cave bear hunting. However, their analysis did not stand up to scrutiny; the view that the broken bones consti- tuted tools, the hypothesis that prehistoric people Mietje Germonpré, Department of Palaeontology, Royal Belgian Institute of Natural Sciences Vautierstraat 29, B-1000 Brussels, Belgium Riku Hamàlainen, Department of Comparative Religion, Unioninkatu 38E FIN-00014, University of Helsinki, Finland ARCTIC ANTHROPOLOGY, Vol. 44, No. 2, pp. 1-30, 2007 ISSN 0066-6939 © 2007 by the Board of Regents of the University of Wisconsin System</page><page sequence="2">2 Arctic Anthropology 44:2 deposited the skulls in special places, and hence the contention that a cave bear cult existed during the Middle Paleolithic, were all rejected by such influential authors as Koby (1941, 1943) and Kur- tén (1976). Those authors declared that the accu- mulation of cave bear remains was the result of natural bear death during hibernation and that the presence of skulls in niches and broken, polished bear bones were not the result of human interven- tion. The figures published by Bachler 1920-21 and 1940 were objects of particular criticism. These figures were derived from the Drachenloch cave and show a coffin bearing bear skulls, but they are contradictory: the number and orienta- tion of the skulls in the chest are not the same in the two figures (Kurtén 1976). Apparently, Bachler was not present throughout the entire time when the finds were made (Kurtén 1976). Further, ac- cording to Koby (1943), the bear bones were not modified by humans, but rather had been trampled on and broken by bears preparing for their hiber- nation. This explanation was also applied to large elements such as skulls that had been displaced in the cave. It was this "charriage-à-sec" that led to the appearance of specially arranged skulls and broken, polished bear remains, interpreted incor- rectly by Bachler and Hormann as being evidence of human manipulation of the skulls and bones. Koby also pointed out that other factors, such as rock falls, chemical dissolution, cryoturbation, and transport by water could also have caused the fragmentation and polishing of the bones (Koby 1943). Pacher (1997) endorsed and elaborated upon Kurtén's and Koby's critiques. In addition to the above critiques, there has been a general tendency to avoid considering pos- sible ritual dimensions of faunal assemblages (Insoll 2004), especially those dating from the Paleolithic. Animal bone assemblages have essen- tially been seen as representing residue or refuse (e.g., Lyman 1994) that reflect subsistence prac- tices without acknowledging the possible spiri- tual importance of the remains of the hunted ani- mals. Such interpretations do not, however, allow for the important possibility that Paleolithic peo- ple held a broad religious world-view that influ- enced human-animal interactions (McNiven and Fieldman 2003). According to Hodder (1982:161) "... meat-eating, the division of the carcass and the dispersal of the bones must always have a sym- bolic content behind which there is a conceptual order." Notable exceptions to the general trend to in- terpret animal bones solely according to economic activity are the interpretation of the mammoth bone complexes at Yudinovo and Mezherichi, Rus- sia, as the results of ritual behavior (Soffer 1985), and the consideration of ritual meaning in some aspects of the reindeer bone assemblages from the Hamburgian sites of Meiendorf and Stellmoor (Gr0n 2005). This article attempts to redress the balance regarding views on the relationship between fos- sil bears and prehistoric humans, and hopefully to widen and enrich the debate about the possi- ble ritual significance of bear remains. To that end, the paper investigates a topic that has hitherto re- ceived no attention in the literature: the fact that several fossil bear bones from Belgian Upper Pa- leolithic cave sites display ochre traces. The pa- per argues that, in at least some cases, the most plausible explanation for the coloring is that it is the result of intentional manipulation by humans and that in the other cases, the available evidence does not rule out the possibility of human manip- ulation. Then, drawing upon a range of archaeo- zoological, archaeological, and ethnographic data, the paper considers the extent to which fossil bear bones with ochre traces may be held to be indica- tive of a proto bear-ceremonialism. The remainder of this paper presents a the- oretical basis for the discussion, examines evi- dence from the Upper Paleolithic, reviews ethno- graphic sources for bear-related ritual practices among hunting people of the modern era, and dis- cusses the archaeological data in light of the above studies. Theoretical Perspective This paper proposes the hypothesis that there ex- isted a proto bear-ceremonialism in the Upper Pa- leolithic. In addition to interpreting the existing archaeological and ethnographic evidence, a new element to the discussion on bear rituals will be introduced: color traces found on bear remains from the Upper Paleolithic. The utilization of col- ors in ethnographic rituals was mentioned in the first works treating boreal societies (e.g., Scheffer 1682), but its potential for untangling the possible connection between ethnographic and prehistoric bear ceremonies has not yet been addressed. The observations made by missionaries, ad- ministrators, and professional anthropologists constitute a vast corpus of anthropological data, the richness of which has, according to Testart (2006), been too little considered and too little ex- plored. Many practices have disappeared today; therefore it is necessary to examine old observa- tions as recorded in the early anthropological lit- erature in order to find descriptions that can be helpful for interpreting certain problems in ar- chaeology (Testart 2006). Testart advises that early written sources should be explored, in a system- atic way. For the purpose of this paper, societies in which bear ceremonialism was present during historical times, found across much of the arctic and subarctic regions of the northern hemisphere</page><page sequence="3">Germonpré and Hàmàlàinen: Bear Ceremonialism in the Belgian Upper Paleolithic 3 (Hallowell 1926), are especially interesting. The questions that require answers are the following: 1) how are animals, and more specifically bears, regarded by these societies; 2) is the color red ap- plied to bear remains in traditional bear ceremo- nies; 3) are other colors utilized as well; 4) are the colors applied to bear bones discernible in the ar- chaeological record; and 5) what is the meaning of the colors applied to bear bones? According to Stiles (1977:95): ". . . the de- gree to which the two sets of properties [the set of ethnographic data and set of archaeological data] agree determines the probability of the activity which resulted in the archaeologically observed data being analogous to the ethnographically ob- served activity." Ethnography continues, accord- ing to Whitley and Keyser (2003:390-391), "to be critical to archaeological interpretation because it provides the ballpark within which the specifics of prehistoric religions can be assumed to lie. But necessarily this use of ethnography must be de- tailed and substantive. ..." For Robert-Lamblin (2001), the ethnography of contemporary northern peoples can help to un- derstand the perception of nature during the Upper Paleolithic. Structurally, it is possible that since the environment and way of living of the Upper Paleolithic hunter-gatherers were broadly similar to that of more recent hunter-gatherers, the world- view and cosmology of these peoples have some parallels with those of the recent northern hunter- gatherers. In addition, Zvelebil (2003) argues that the cosmology of the Siberian hunter-gatherers can offer a structured analogy for identifying hunter-gatherer ritual practices in the past. Apart from these similarities, Hodder and Hutson (2003) stress that if it is determined that present ethno- graphic information can be transferred successfully to past contexts, the differences between two con- texts must also be evaluated. One important diver- gence is that the Pleistocene animal world of West- ern Europe was, although comparable, much richer in species than the Arctic and Subarctic fauna of today. The Weichselian fauna differed in that it in- cluded extinct mammals such as the woolly mam- moth and woolly rhinoceros, important game an- imals such as the wild horse, and predators such as the lion and hyena that today live in southern regions. Nevertheless, a majority of the Ice Age mammals still survive today in the north: small mammals such as hares, marmots, and lemmings; carnivores such as wolf, fox, lynx, wolverine, and brown bear; and large mammals such as reindeer, red deer, elk, muskox, and bison. Many of these an- imals doubtless had a significant symbolic value during the Upper Paleolithic, as shown by count- less images in prehistoric art. The practice of use of symbolism by hu- mans during the Paleolithic has been considered through analyses of Paleolithic cave and portable art, and ornaments (Robb 1998). Structuralist anal- yses of Paleolithic art were based on identifying spatial binary oppositions between depicted ani- mals (Leroi-Gourhan 1982) and on formalized sys- tems of visual representation for ritual commu- nication (Conkey 1985). The analysis of art has also included attention to the role of stylistic pat- terning in figurines, which is indicative of the ex- istence of large-scale communication (Gamble 1982). However, the symbolic aspects of Paleo- lithic bone deposits have been largely neglected. Several manipulations of bear carcasses, which can have either utilitarian or ritual uses, can leave traces on bear bones. The skinning of bears leaves cut marks on skulls, phalanges, car- pals and tarsals, less on metapodials (David 2002). Butchering and filleting marks can be observed on meat-bearing bones. The ritual cutting of the nose and the lips can damage the nasal bones, the pre- maxilla, maxilla, or lower jaw. Canines can be per- forated or worked (Castel and Madeliane 2003; Is- senmen 1997). Long handling or contact with leather or fur can cause small bones, such as ca- nines or metapodials, to become polished. It is not always possible, on the basis of these marks, to distinguish between utilitarian or ceremonial use of the bear remains. However, the staining of cleaned skulls and bones with pigments does not have a utilitarian use and thus is a possible indi- cation of ritual behavior. Moreover, such decora- tion might furnish durable vestiges in the archaeo- zoological record, because pigments such as ochre and charcoal can endure for millennia. Evidence from the Upper Paleolithic Ochre in the Upper Paleolithic Red and black pigments are relatively ubiqui- tous in Paleolithic sites (Hovers et al. 2003 and references therein). It has been established that red ochre was used in Southern Africa from the Middle Stone Age on (Henshilwood et al. 2002; McBrearty and Brooks 2000; Watts 2002). Iron oxides had various functions in prehistoric life forming the basis for artistic techniques (Cour- aud 1988), and ochre was furthermore related to domestic activities, such as the working of ani- mal skins (Couraud 1988). However, Watts (2002) could not find experimental, ethnographic, or ar- chaeological support for the hypothesis that ochre played a role in the techniques of hide preser- vation during the Upper Paleolithic in Europe. Ochred scrapers from Epipaleolithic and Meso- lithic levels at Balma Margineda (Andorra) indi- cate that ochre was used as an abrasive to finish</page><page sequence="4">4 Arctic Anthropology 44:2 and color already tanned skin and is not related to hide-preservation techniques (Philibert 1994). Watts (2002) discusses furthermore the symbolic function of red ochre and concludes that ochre was used in the African Late Pleistocene as a sig- naling strategy that involved ritualized display within a web of symbolic meanings. In Europe, red ochre is a traditional ele- ment in the ceremonial human burials from the Gravettian (Djindjian et al. 1999; Mussi 2000). In these burials, the ochre was often placed near or on the head (Aldhouse-Green 2000). Human buri- als with ochre date in the west from c. 26,000 B.P. ("Red Lady of Paviland," see Aldhouse-Green 2000), in Central Europe from c. 26,600 B.P. (Tri- ple burial from Dolní Véstonice, see Formicola and Buzhilova 2001; the infant burials at Krems- Wachtberg, see Einwògerer et al. 2006) and c. 23,700 B.P. (Brno II burial site, see Oliva 2000); and further to the east from c. 24,000 B.P. (Double child burial of Sunghir 2 and 3 see Formicola and Buzhilov 2004). Also the Gravettian human buri- als from the Balzi Rossi sites, Italy, often contain a lot of ochre (Mussi 2000). Red ochre is also typi- cally associated with Magdalenian burials (Sacchi 2003). In Duruthy, France, a Magdalenian human burial was furthermore associated with perforated lion and bear canines (Sacchi 2003). Fossil Bear Bones with Color Marks Since the nineteenth century, many bear fossils have been discovered in Belgian cave sites (Du- pont 1873; Ehrenberg 1935; Schmerling 1833; Si- monet 1992). The material discussed in this pa- per originates from the caves of Goyet, Princesse Pauline, and Trou de Chaleux, which are lo- cated in the Condroz, a region south of the Sam- bre and Meuse valleys in Belgium (Fig. 1). The pa- laeontological collections from Goyet and Trou de Chaleux have been stored at the Royal Belgian In- stitute of Natural Sciences since their excavation Figure 1.

The ma- terial from Princesse Pauline is held at the Royal Belgian Museum of Art and History. The Goyet cave is situated in a limestone cliff towering over the confluence of two small riv- ers, the Samson and the Strouvia; the former joins the Meuse River 3 km to the west. The cave en- trance, 15 m above the riverbed, faces southwest and overlooks the valley of the Samson. The cave consists of several chambers. Chamber A is about 26 m long and is 4 to 5 m wide. Chamber B lies behind Chamber A and is about 13 m long. Du- pont (1873) distinguished four bone- and artifact- bearing horizons in Chamber A. At the entrance he discovered a large number of Middle and Up- per Paleolithic artifacts, as well as numerous re- mains of ice age mammals, especially herbivores. Many of these bones were broken (for marrow extraction), have cut marks, or display traces of ochre (Germonpré 1996). The Paleolithic artifacts date from the Mousterian, Aurignacian, Gravet- tian, and Magdalenian, which indicates recurrent occupations of the cave from the Pleniglacial un- til the Late Glacial. Unfortunately, it is not always clear from which horizon the artifacts originated (Dewez 1987; Dupont 1873; Lopez Bayon et al. 1997; Otte 1979; Otte and Groenen 2001; Ulrix-Closset 1975). Aurignacian ivory beads were discovered in Horizon 3 (Otte 1979). This hori- zon is a vast palimpsest of multiple occupations (Miller 2001). Other spectacular finds include "ba- tons de commandement," needles, perforated teeth, and shell necklaces from the Magdalenian (Horizons 1 and 2), and a bone harpoon (Horizon 1) (Dewez 1987). Several bones from herbivores found at the entrance of Chamber A are stained with ochre. These ochre-stained bones have not yet been analyzed, except for the Late Glacial as- semblage from Horizon 1. In this Magdalenian assemblage, around 14 percent of all bones show traces of ochre (Germonpré, unpublished data). The ochre occurs mainly on horse and reindeer bones. In particular, bone tools, ornaments such as perforated teeth, and elements such as the marrow-rich metapodials display ochre stains (Germonpré 1996). At the rear of Chamber A and in Chamber B, Dupont (1873) distinguished five horizons in all, containing mainly bear, lion, and hyena remains. The carnivore assemblages appear not to be related to the human refuse assemblages in the front of Chamber A (Germonpré 1996, 2001). Table 1 shows the number of identified spec- imens (NISP) of cave bear assemblage A3 (Horizon 3, Chamber A). Bear teeth are the most frequent el- ement in this assemblage. Table 1 also includes the number of bear bones that show evidence of hu- man manipulation. Seven skeletal remains from this bear assemblage exhibit ochre traces, all per- taining to elements from the head or adjacent to the skull. They originate from at least three indi- viduals: a skull and an atlas fragment from two three-month-old cubs; an axis fragment from a subadult; a skull fragment, two jugal teeth, and a canine from adult cave bears. The canine is from a male. The bones that have been modified by hu- mans constitute only 0.7% of the cave bear as- semblage. An AMS date on a cave bear bone with ochre gave a result of c. 23,600 B.P. (Table 2). An unmodified cave bear canine has an AMS age of circa 27,500 B.P. The AMS age of a reindeer bone, having ochre stains and fractured for marrow ex- traction, is similar to the latter date (Table 2). The available evidence indicates that the bear remains with ochre traces did not receive them as a result of contact with ochre-containing sediment or spilt ochre. Firstly, Dupont (unpublished notes) described the sediment of the cave as yellow col- ored: "Elle renfermait de l'argile jaune d'une épaisseur de 2 m environ." He did not allude to any reddish soil matrix, although he mentioned the presence of ochre nodules. A possible source of this oolithic iron is an outcrop a few kilome- ters upstream of the Samson (E. Goemaere, per- sonal communication). In addition, the ochre on several bones is partly overlain by brownish sed- iment, which shows that after the ochre applica- tion dull colored cave sediment covered the bones. Secondly, the comparison of the frequency distri- bution of the stained elements (grouped as teeth, cranial elements, atlas, and axis) with those with- out ochre reveals that the distributions are signif- icantly different (Fisher's exact test, P = 0.0014). If the bear bones had simply come in contact with ochre-containing sediment or spilt ochre, it would be expected that the distribution of the skeletal el- ements with ochre traces would be similar to that of the elements without ochre. That is not, how- ever, the case here. There aret more skull, atlas, and axis fragments with ochre than expected, while teeth with ochre traces are present less frequently than expected. Furthermore, the hyena bones from this horizon, which were also found at the rear of Chamber A, do not have cut marks or ochre traces. Yet if ochre had been spilt by prehistoric people at the back of the cave, surely the hyena bones would have been stained as well, because the distribution of the spilt ochre would be indiscriminate over both bear bones and hyena bones. Therefore it can be concluded that these bear bones were colored with ochre intentionally and not through accidental contact with ochre con- taining sediment or spilt ochre. Consideration of the remains in the other assemblages warrants the same conclusion.

Goyet, cave bear assemblage A2: phalanx U[Ursus spelaeus) with cut marks (arrow) and ochre traces (dashed arrow). and is again dominated by dental material (Table 1). The frequency of bones manipulated by humans is about 1%. Ochre adheres to an ilium from a ju- venile bear, a phalanx from a young animal, and a pisiforme (carpal bone) from an adult bear. The phalanx also exhibits cut marks, which points to the skinning of this individual by prehistoric peo- ple (Fig. 2). The hyena remains from this horizon do not show ochre traces nor cut marks, which again rules out the possibility that the bones re- ceived ochre traces as a result of accidental spill- ing. However, an ochre-rich sediment is encrusted on a reindeer antler found at the entrance of Cham- bre A. The red colored sediment contained a bone needle, which probably dates from the Magdale- nian (A. Hauzeur, personal communication). This is the sole bone out of 10,000 bones from Goyet that is covered with heterogeneous ochre-contain- ing sediment. Apparently, at the entrance of Cham- ber A, there could have been a few lenses of ochre- stained sediments, although the excavators at the time did not record it. An unmodified cave bear bone from bear assemblage A2 was dated at around 35,000 B.P. The bear pisiforme with ochre traces delivered a much younger AMS date of c. 26,000 B.P. (Table 2). The AMS dates show that Horizon 2 is a composite of different sedimentary units and/ or was not well excavated by Dupont in the 1860's, although he made a distinction between the herbi- vore-rich bone horizon at the front and the carni- vore-riche bone horizon at the rear of Chamber A (Dupont 1873). Cave bear assemblage B4 from Horizon 4 was found in the deeper-lying Chamber B. It has a NISP of 2184 (Table 1). Teeth constitute only 25% of the remains and many associated skeletal parts of cave bears were excavated from this chamber (Dupont 1873; Germonpré 2004). The frequency distribution of the skeletal elements differs greatly from the distribution of the bones in Chamber A (Germonpré 2004). A bear metatarsus from assem- blage B4 displays ochre traces overlain with yel- lowish sediment. The ochre occurs all over the surface of the diaphysis. Furthermore, two rib frag- ments have some red colored patches on their sur- face. However, close inspection reveals that the red color covers greyish sediment and seems to be the result of a later contamination. As in Hori- zons A2 and A3, the hyena bones from Horizon B4 have neither ochre stains nor cut marks. Again, the ochre on the bear metatarsus was probably ap- plied deliberately. Other bear bones manipulated by humans include a carpal bone (pisiforme) (Fig. 3) and a metacarpus with cut marks (Fig. 4). The bones that were manipulated by humans make up less than 1% of the assemblage. Cave bears from assemblage B4 used Chamber B from at least 36,000 years B.P. ago (Germonpré 2004; Germon- pré and Sablin 2001) until 18,800 B.P. (Table 2), indicating that bone horizon B4 is mixed. It must be taken into account that the excavation was done in the nineteenth century without the cur- rent rigorous standards. The mortality pattern of the cave bears from Goyet assemblages A3, A2, and B4 was described as normal nonviolent attrition, affecting mostly young and old individuals that died during hiber- nation, primarily from starvation and other attri- tional factors (Germonpré 2004, Germonpré and Sablin 2001). This pattern is deduced from the fre- quency distribution of three age cohorts (juvenile, Figure 3. Goyet, cave bear assemblage B4: pisiforme [Ursus spelaeus) with cut marks (arrow).</page><page sequence="10">1 0 Arctic Anthropology 44:2 Figure 4. Goyet, cave bear assemblage B4: metacarpus III [Ursus spelaeus) with cut marks (arrow). adult, and old adult), based on the development and wear of the lower carnassial as established by Stiner (1998). Although the age distribution of the remains at Goyet clearly shows that the bulk of the bear material is derived from animals dying of natural causes, it is possible that the bear bones with ochre traces are from hunted bears. After ochre application some of their bones remained or were deposited inside the cave. The cave of Princesse Pauline is situated five km from Goyet on the west bank of the Meuse and was excavated mainly by Rahir and de Loé at the beginning of the 1920s. De Loe (1922) described a single Upper Paleolithic horizon that was stained red, and attributed it to the Aurignacian. Later, an adjacent room of this cave was excavated by Co- lette, who discovered Gravettian artifacts there (Fias 2005). The Aurignacian mammal assemblage consists of 129 bones (Cordy 1974) and contains a few remains of mammals with ochre traces. Ochre occurs especially on mammoth ivory. In addition, one rhinoceros tooth and a scapula from an ibex display ochre traces. The ibex scapula gave an AMS date of around 25,600 B.P. (Fias 2005). The two cave bear elements with ochre traces are a ca- nine from an adult female cave bear (Cordy 1974) and a metatarsus; the ochre on the latter is partly overlain by brown sediment. It remains an open question whether the ochre traces on the bear bones resulted from the sediment in which the bones were found or were applied intention- ally. However, at this cave some 129 bones were collected and only a few show ochre traces. Furthermore, the ochre on the bear metatarsus is overlain by brown sediment. This speaks in favor of human application and against contact with red colored sediment. The cave of Trou de Chaleux lies some 25 km south of Goyet. The cave is located in a limestone cliff 15 m above the river Lesse, a tributary of the Meuse. Dupont (unpublished notes) described the bone and artifact bearing sediment as "sol terreux." New excavations on the terrace were undertaken in the mid-1980s. The artifacts and bone industry clearly point to the material being of Magdalenian origin (Otte et al. 1994). In contrast to the sites of Goyet and Princesse Pauline, this cave was not used as a den by carnivores. Three cut-marked horse and muskox bones excavated by Dupont (1873) yielded an AMS age of circa 12,850 B.P. (Charles 1998). Dupont collected 64 brown bear bones (Charles 1998) from at least three individu- als. In this bear assemblage, around 20% of the bear bones were modified by humans, a much higher fre- quency than found at Goyet. The butchery marks on the brown bear bones correspond for the most part with skinning (Charles 1998). Three bones dis- play ochre remains. A fragment of a lower jaw from an adult bear has both cut marks and ochre coloring (Fig. 5). The cut marks occur on the lateral and me- dial side of the left lower jaw and can be related to the separation of the lower jaw from the skull. The ochre is partly covered by brownish sediment. A third phalanx shows ochre traces. The perforated canine with ochre stains is from a cub of less than one year old (Fig. 6). It is the only remains from a ju- venile bear at this site. Here again, the ochre was most probably applied purposely by prehistoric people to the bear remains. The colored bear ele- ments from Goyet, Princesse Pauline, and Trou de Chaleux caves were preserved because, following manipulation by humans, they remained or ended up in caves. A search in the literature revealed that other</page><page sequence="11">Germonpré and Hàmalàinen: Bear Ceremonialism in the Belgian Upper Paleolithic 1 1 Figure 5.

Irou de Chaleux: perforated canine (Ursus arctos) with ochre traces (dashed arrow). cave sites in Western Europe yielded bear bones with color marks. The Chauvet cave in France is not only a major rock art sanctuary, dating from c. 25,000 B.P. to 32,000 B.R and containing many cave bear paintings, but was also an important den site for hibernating cave bears (Baffler 2005). Inside this cave a cave bear skull was found that displays a black stripe. Initially, this was inter- preted as a torch-wipe (Robert-Lamblin 2001) but has now been linked to intentional human manip- ulation (Robert-Lamblin 2005). In Germany, in the Petershòhle, a cave bear skull, which was strewn- with charcoal, was reported by Hòrmann (1933). Ehrenberg (1953) described a cave bear skull with charcoal marks that was found in a niche of the Salzofenhòhle, Austria. In addition, a third phalanx and an incisor also exhibited charcoal traces. In the decorated cave of the Grande Grotte at Arcy-sur-Cure, France, a few cave bear bones were discovered with ochre traces. A metatarsus was, according to Baffler (1998), used to mix ochre and, in contrast with the metatarsus from Goyet that has ochre present on the diaphysis, the ochre occurs mainly on the distal epiphysis. The paint- ings of the Grande Grotte have not been dated di- rectly, although the cave was occupied, based on several AMS dates, at least from 26,000 B.P. until 24,500 B.R, and are attributed to the Aurignaco- Gravettian (Baffler and Girardl998). Rivière (1887: plate XVI, fig. 1) illustrated a broken bear canine with ochre stains from the Grotte de Cavillon, It- aly. This tooth seems not to be directly associated with the human burial of this cave (Mussi, per- sonal communication 2005). The pattern that emerges from the European Paleolithic cave sites shows that specific bear skel- etal elements were treated with ochre or charcoal (Table 3). Mainly remains from the head region and the paws display color traces. Table 3. NISP of fossil bear remains with ochre or charcoal traces from Belgian and other European cave sites (see text).

It is interesting to note that in the Belgian caves, some of these same skeletal elements display traces of red ochre. Not only at Chauvet, but in several caves with Paleo- lithic paintings (e.g., the Enlène cave), bone frag- ments were inserted into cracks in cave walls close to areas of parietal art (Clottes 2004), with- out doubt with a ritual goal (Clottes and Lewis- Williams 1996). Furthermore, at Chauvet, the placement of one cave bear skull is unusual: it was discovered set on a rock. This skull has a calcite crust, which indicates that it had origin- ally been lying on the cave floor. At some point in the past a person broke it loose from the floor and put it on the rock (Robert-Lamblin 2005). Also in Germany, in the Petershòhle, a bear skull was discovered on a rock ridge (Hòrmann 1933:plate 20b). Among the Mesolithic societies in Europe, a very unique bear bone points to the complexity of the relationships between humans and animals during that time. At Grande-Rivoire, France, a lower jaw from a brown bear, deformed by tether- ing, was found in a Late Mesolithic horizon (Chaix et al. 1997). The bear may have been captured as a cub and kept in captivity until adulthood when it may have been ritually killed (Chaix et al. 1997). Another special placement of a bear skull occurred at the Neolithic site of Machecoul, France. Here, a complete brown bear skull was disposed of in- tentionally in a trench of the surrounding wall of the site, which could indicate, according to l'Helgouach (1981), a ritual. Besides these few published finds in Europe, ancient manipulation of bear remains was also dis- covered in North America. At the early Holocene open-air site of Kilgii Gwaay (c. 9400 B.P.) on the Northwest Coast of North America, several bear bones display cut marks, and the differential fre- quency distribution of the bones suggests the practice of some aspects of bear rituals at the site (McLaren et al. 2005). In the Late Dorset site on Dundas Island in the High Arctic, a bear skull cov- ered with patches of red ochre was discovered on a midden outside a dwelling (Sutherland 2001; McGhee, personal communication 2004). Of spe- cial interest is the arrangement of a wooden carving of a bear placed in a rock crevice nearby (McGhee 1974/75; Sutherland 2001; McGhee personal com- munication 2004). In addition, Berres et al. (2004) gives an overview of several sites, dating from A.D. 1000 and younger, with clear evidence of ancient bear rituals in northeastern North America. Paleolithic Bear Hunting It can be presumed that if prehistoric people wished to utilize bear meat or bones, they hunted bears for this purpose and did not rely on encoun- tered bear carcasses. The hunting of bears by Pa- leolithic people can be deduced from two sources: cave art and archaeozoology. Morel and Garcia (2002) discussed Upper Paleolithic depictions of bears that could represent hunting scenes. Ac- cording to these authors, straight lines drawn on the bear bodies of the Magdalenian paintings of Grotte du Portel, Grotte des Combarelles, and Grotte des Trois-Frères, France, could evoke pro- jectiles. A bundle of stripes coming out of the mouth and nose of the Magdalenian bear paint- ings of Grotte des Trois-Frères and Grotte de Mas- sat, France, could represent the bleeding of a fa- tally wounded brown bear. The idea that bears were hunted during the Middle and Upper Paleolithic and their carcasses utilized was recently corroborated by the discov- ery of important new sites such as Biache-Saint- Vaast (Auguste 1992, 2003), and new interpreta- tions of old sites such as Taubach (Bratlund 1999). In these Middle Paleolithic open air sites, some 25% of the bear bones, mostly from brown bears, had cut marks. The remains are mainly from prime adults. Such an age distribution is the reverse of that which is normally found in a natural accumu- lation site, where juvenile and senile remains pre- dominate, and such a distribution points to hunt- ing (Auguste 2003) as a likelihood. At these sites, no evidence exists for a possible symbolic use of bears by Neanderthals, although a worked bear in- cisor was found in a Chatelperronian horizon at the Grotte du Renne, Arcy-sur-Cure (David 2002). Clear proof of bear hunting during the Upper Pa- leolithic was demonstrated at the Hohle Fels cave near Schelklingen, Germany (Miinzel et al. 2001). Here, in a Gravettian context, a thoracic verte- bra from a bear was discovered with a 5 mm long fragment of a flint artifact in the bone (Münzel and Conard 2004; Miinzel et al. 2001). Also in the Grotte du Bichon, Switzerland associated skele- tal remains from a man and a brown bear points to a hunting accident almost 12,000 years ago. A cer- vical vertebra from the bear had an impact trace from a flint projectile (Morel 1993). The Bear in Upper Paleolithic Art There is evidence to suggest that animals in gen- eral and bears in particular had a symbolic value</page><page sequence="13">Germonpré and Hamalàinen: Bear Ceremonialism in the Belgian Upper Paleolithic 1 3 to Upper Paleolithic people. Among the carni- vores only bears and canids (foxes and wolves) are regularly present with modified teeth in Up- per Paleolithic sites. Worked teeth from cats, in- cluding the cave lion, and hyenas are, in contrast, rare. The oldest Upper Paleolithic perforated bear teeth date mainly from the Gravettian. The tradi- tion of perforated bear teeth did not stop with the Paleolithic as Neolithic, Bronze Age, and even Ro- man sites still delivered worked bear teeth (Pacher 2005). In French parietal art lions and bears are the two most important carnivore themes; canids are, on the contrary, a rare theme (Azéma 2006). Rou- zaud (2002) counted in total at least 140 depic- tions of bears dating from the early, mid- and late Upper Paleolithic from Western Europe to Sibe- ria, which shows that the bear was an important symbolic theme in prehistoric art. The decorated Chauvet cave in France, contains many images of bears and lions. The bear paintings are sim- ple silhouettes executed in red, in contrast with the detailed realistic figures of the black lions (Robert-Lamblin 2005). The latter author links the red color of the bear paintings to the use of ochre in Upper Paleolithic burials. According to Rou- zaud (2002), the bear, eventually together with the lion, occupied in the Upper Paleolithic art a hier- archically intermediary position between man and the other animals, based on the association in sev- eral caves of bear images with anthropomorphic representations and on the rich diversity of the postures of the figured bears, surpassed only by the diversity of the human images. In Moravia, bears and lions heavily dominate animal figurine art (Soffer 1997). In addition, in the Gravettian sites of the Don basin bear figurines are frequent (Iakovleva 1999). At Avdeevo, ivory zoomorphic artifacts represent stylized images of animal faces; most of these were interpreted as fe- lines (Gvozdover 1995). Some of these zoomor- phic faces could, however, be interpreted as bear heads, characterized by a triangular face and small rounded ears. In conclusion, the bear is the only carnivore that is an important theme both in the parietal art and in figurine art, and that is used re- currently as a raw material base for the manufac- ture of personal ornaments. Ethnographic Evidence Northern Hunting Peoples and Animals In circumpolar cultures where the principal source of livelihood is hunting, relations between humans and animals are particularly important. Animals are not only a source of food; they also form an essential part of the world view and re- ligion. Animals also define the position of hu- mans vis-à-vis - the rest of nature (Hamalàinen 2002b, in press). The cosmology of these societies contains two principal ideas: the belief in invisi- ble souls inhabiting humans, animals, and inan- imate objects, and the belief that each species of wild animal has a " spirit master" who controls the distribution of the animals to human hunt- ers. Therefore, the animals must receive appropri- ate treatment in the killing, use, and disposal of their remains (Ingold 1986). The Yup'ik Eskimo viewed the relationship between people and ani- mals as co-operative reciprocity by which the an- imals, having souls and being subject to the con- trol of spirits, deliver themselves willingly to the hunter in response to the hunter's respectful treat- ment (Fienup-Riordan 1988). The soul, in both hu- man and animals, was recognized as the principle that sustained life. Animals were seen as an infi- nitely renewable resource; hence, hunting by hu- mans could not have a directly negative impact on animal populations (Fienup-Riordan 1991). The bones of hunted animals were not left to lie on the ground. They had to be buried, burned, or submerged to protect them from people and scavenging dogs (Fienup-Riordan 1988). Also for the Koyukon people, the natural and supernatu- ral worlds are inseparable. Natural beings are en- dowed with spirits and are engaged in a spiri- tual interchange with humans. The behavior of the people towards natural beings is conducted by spiritually founded prescriptions, and the remains of hunted animals must be protected from contact with scavengers (Nelson 1986). Humans and Bears The bear is a large and dangerous carnivore. How- ever, fear alone does not account for the rich and varied traditions linking bears and humans. Not infrequently, people have felt a kind of kinship with bears, for humans and bears share many char- acteristics. They live in the same regions and eat the same fish, roots, and berries. Unlike other ani- mals, bears can stand on their hind legs as humans do and they can use their fore paws as humans use their hands. A bear's skinned body looks human, and several bear bones resemble human bones, which lends credence to the view that the animal is really a man in disguise (Ingold 1986). To the Native Americans, for example the Lakota, Black- foot, and Shoshone, bears occupied a special posi- tion among all other animals because of these sim- ilarities (Hamalàinen 2002a, 2002b, in press); and transformation between humans and bears can be found in many tales of the Arikara, Caddo, Crow, Cheyenne, Pawnee, Tlingit, Beaver, Cherokee, Carrier, Eskimo, Blackfoot, and Yavapai, as well other Native American groups (Cunningham 2001; Dorsey 1904; Dorsey 1905; Gelo 1987; Kroeber</page><page sequence="14">1 4 Arctic Anthropology 44 :2 1998; Lowie 1918; Marriot and Rachlin 1975; Mc- Clellan 1970; Spence 1989). For the Koyukon peo- ple, the brown and black bears are among the an- imals with the most potent spirits (Nelson 1986). Native Americans, e.g., the Lakota and Blackfoot, also frequently believed that bears have the same kind of souls as humans (Brown 1992; Grinnell 1962; Hultkrantz 1953), and the Blackfoot have thought that the bear is part animal and part hu- man (Grinnell 1962). In Eurasia, the Khanty believe that both bears and people have four or five souls (Jordan 2003). For the Ket the bear is the only an- imal that has a human-like soul (Paproth 1962). They think that the skin of the bear is the bear's winter fur coat and that it can be taken off in the same manner as people's clothes (Sokolova 2000). For the Olchi and Nanai, the bear is a forest man in a fur dress (Zolotarev 1937). The bear is often considered a kind of relative (grandfather/grand- mother), or the oldest person of the tribe (Alexe- jenko 1963; Paproth 1962; Vasilev 1948). In Khanty cosmology, the bear is seen as an intermediary be- tween the domains of people and spirit masters (Jordan 2003). Bear Hunting and Bear Ceremonialism According to Kannisto (1939) and Karsten (1955) relations between humans and bears become par- ticularly delicate when a hunter kills a bear. In his classic study, Hallowell (1926) offered an over- view of bear ceremonialism and identified its common and essential elements. These elements include: 1) early spring as the favorite time for hunting the bear in its den; 2) referring to bears by metaphorical expressions, kinship terms or descriptions; 3) calling bears out of their den; 4) killing bears using ancient weapons; 5) pay- ing attention to bear carcasses and particularly the head of the hunted bear; 6) organizing a com- munal feast; and 7) handling the disposal of bear bones respectfully. However, even though this sce- nario represents most of the bear rituals of the northern people, some of them, e.g., the Plains In- dians of North America, had, for ecological rea- sons, different forms as well as different func- tions of bear ceremonialism (Hàmàlàinen 2002b, in press). In Siberia, several people such as the Ket, the Nivkhi (Krejnovic 1971), and the Khanty (Jor- dan 2003) believe that the bear is willing to be killed. The discovery of a bear den means that the forest elder wants to visit the people and therefore he must be "invited home" and killed (Jordan 2003). The eating of the bear was an event of great communal importance, and often it was an eat-all feast of bear meat (Hallowell 1926). The deposit- ing of the bones, especially the skull, was actually the climax of the bear ceremonialism among the northern peoples (Hallowell 1926). They believed that the skeleton was a container or representa- tive of the soul or spirit of a creature (Sutherland 2001). They were not permitted to throw away the bones of the eaten bear, and dogs and other car- nivores were not allowed to take them (Binford 2002, Hallowell 1926). In Europe and Siberia, bear ceremonies did not involve shamanistic rituals (Vasilev 1948) and the shaman participated in the feast on equal terms with the others (Sokolova 2000). His spirit- helpers, however, were often bears (Hoppál 2002; Siikala 1992). According to Jacobson (1993) the Si- berian bear cult reveals references that date from a pre-shamanic stage of prehistory. In the Evenk my- thology, the bear is a culture hero from whom peo- ple received fire and stone tools, which suggests that the Evenk bear cult originated in deep antiq- uity (Jacobson 1993). Coloring of the Bear Carcass and Bones in Circumpolar Societies A search of ethnographic records of bear ritu- als containing information about the use of col- ors (pigments, dyes, or other) during the bear cer- emonies of circumpolar societies resulted in the data compiled in Tables 4a and 4b. After a bear hunt, boreal people often decorated the killed an- imal with red alder bark juice, blood, pigments, or colorful cloths (for details and references see Table 4a). Such decoration adorned not only the bear; sometimes the hunters, their wives, or the guests at the bear feast were smeared with red or black colors (Table 4a). During the bear feast, the head and skin of the bear were placed on the seat of honor in the dwelling, and the head was of- ten decorated (e.g., Saami: Holmberg 1964; Ket: Sokolova 2000; Khanty: Milovsky 1993; Ainu: Batchelor 1901; Naskapi and Central Algonkian: Hallowell 1926; North Saulteaux: Skinner 1911). According to Kimura (1999), the deep religious meaning of the Iyomante, the Ainu bear ceremony, was found in the decorating of the bear's skull. During the feast, the Ainu placed a cup of the bear's own meat in front of the bear's head (Batch- elor 1901). The Saami put a vessel filled with alder bark juice before the bear's nose (Holmberg 1964). This is reminiscent of traditional Nordic stories, in which a girl, captured by a bear and brought to his den, found there a bowl of milk every day. One morning, however, a bowl of blood was placed be- side the bear and that day the bear was killed (Eds- man 1956). After the bear feast, the native people some- times colored the cleaned skull, and occasionally the bones as well, before they disposed of them in a sacred place (for details and references see</page><page sequence="15">Germonpré and Hàmàlàinen: Bear Ceremonialism in the Belgian Upper Paleolithic 15 Table 4a.

The skull was sometimes painted red or black (Fig. 7). Sometimes even the hunters, trees, or poles were colored (Table 4b). The overviews in Table 4a and 4b make it clear that the main colors selected for the circum- polar bear rituals are red and black. Only one ref- erence was found on the use of another color. Ac- cording to Skinner (1914), the Plains-Cree put yellow ochre marks on the forehead and neck of the hunted bear; they also put a pile of red cloth on its head. All non-overlapping citations of the separate handling of, or actions concerning the use of, the two most important colors (red, black) associated with the bear hunt and feast and the disposal of the bear remains were counted. Al- though both red and black are mentioned for the two events, the frequencies of the colors differ significantly across the events (Fisher's exact test, P = 0.015). In the current data set, red is employed more often than expected during the hunt and feast. In addition, the references show that apart from the application of color on people, other an- imals, or objects, the bear head is the main body part of the bear that is colored, occurring 22 (82%) times out of a total of 28 references that mention the coloring of the bear remains by different north- ern peoples. The next two important body parts are the skin and the paws, with respectively 3 (10.7%) and 2 (7.2%) of the total number of refer- ences. One reference pertains to the painting of the vertebra and unspecified bones. Ethnographic evidence suggests that sym- bolic color systems are shared by many societ- ies (Hovers et al. 2003 and references therein) and red ochre is the most widely used mineral pig- ment in rituals (Watts 2002). Cross-cultural lin- guistic studies have found that a total universal in- ventory of 11 basic color categories exists. The two basic color terms used in all languages are black and white. Languages containing more than two color terms inevitably have a term for red (Berlin and Kay 1999). For the Chukchi, red was the color of life (Issenman 1997; Serov 1988). The Khanty considered red, particularly ochre, to be a symbol</page><page sequence="17">Germonpré and Hámalainen: Bear Ceremonialism in the Belgian Upper Paleolithic 1 7 Table 4b.

According to Hatt (1969), a mystical notion existed among the Saami about a connection between red alder bark juice and blood. They believed that both liquids possess magical and protective qualities. Saami women put alder bark juice on their faces when re- ceiving the hunters with the killed bear, to neu- tralize the dangerous power emanating from the animal (Karsten 1955). The Northern Saulteaux painted geometric designs on bear skulls and bones for religious and protective purposes (Skinner 1911). In Cree color symbolism, black is related to the bear (Tanner 1979). Black was used by the Nenet for protection: the Nenet women put soot on their faces when cooking the bear meat; otherwise, the bear would recognize and kill them (Lehtisalo 1924). People present at Evenki bear feasts besmeared their faces with soot in or- der that the bear would think ravens killed him (Harva 1959). The general objective of the choice of the colors red and black in the bear rituals seems to correspond to protective measures against the powerful bear.

Skull and postcranial bones were often disposed of separately; examples are found among the Finns, Saami, Khanty, Ainu, and Ojibwa (Paulson 1965). The review of descriptions (Table 5) indicates that the skull, alone or together with the lower jaw, is the skeletal element most frequently cited to be ritually deposited by north- ern hunters. Sometimes the skull was buried, but most of- ten it was placed in special trees (often pine trees) a few meters above the ground, attached to poles or put on platforms. It is interesting to note in this context that the Timagami Ojibwa originally in- humed their dead in trees (Speck 1915a). In north- ern Eurasia, trees or wooden scaffolds were also used for the inhumation of people, and that treat- ment resembles that of dead bears (Harva 1959; Holmberg 1925; Vasilev 1948). The Evenki of northern Transbaikal deposit bear remains in a raised platform-box, which resembles a tradi- tional human coffin (Abe 2005; Gr0n and Turov, in press). According to Zachrisson (1985), there are parallels among Saami graves and bear graves. Karjalainen (1927) stressed the close connection between the Mansi ceremonies for the hunted bear and those for a deceased human. Ethnographic Bear Mythology In Eurasia, as well as in North America, different versions of a myth of the marriage of a girl and a bear are found (Edsman 1987; Paproth 1976; Pen- tikáinen 1999). According to Edsman (1987) this myth is integral to the bear ceremonies. In the Athabaskan story "The Girl who Married the Bear," a girl meets a stranger and marries him. Later she finds out that he is really a bear. He fathers her child(ren). At the end of the winter, the bear is killed in his den by his brothers-in-law. Previously, he had given instructions to his wife on how his body must be treated after death (McClellan 1970). Several of McClellan's (1970) informants stated that the story explains their bear ritual. In a south- ern Tutchone version, the bear instructs his wife to hang his cleaned skull in a tree (McClellan 1970). The bear husband not only teaches his wife how to dispose of his remains, but in some stories in- sists specifically on the utilization of the colors black (charcoal) or red (ochre) in connection with his body. In an inland Tlingit version of the story, the bear tells his wife that after his death charcoal must be put between his shoulder blades (McClel- lan 1970). In a Tsimshian version, the bear hus- band instructs his wife to put red ochre on his dried skin from head to tail (Maud 1993). In Si- beria a similar myth exists, in which the bear in- dicates how his remains must be treated. In an Evenk story about a marriage between a girl and a bear that kidnapped her, the dying bear bids his brother-in-law to skin and bury him (Sokolova 2000). Such stories illustrate the importance of rit- ual knowledge and proper treatment of the slain bear, including the use of coloring agents, for both placating the bear's spirit and hunting successfully in the future (McClellan 1970; Paproth 1976). Function of the Bear Rituals Circumpolar peoples believed that the bear, as well as other animals, was under the control of some supernatural masters, or a guardian spirit governing the supply of game animals. By per- forming the correct rituals and by placing the skull (the residence of the bear's spirit) in a sacred loca- tion, the bear could be pacified so its soul would not take vengeance on the slayer, its remains were protected from dogs and other carnivores, its life- after-death existence could be assured, its bones could grow new flesh and a new bear could arise in due time, its spirit could return to heaven or to its spirit master, and it could tell of its hon- orific treatment to its fellow bears. The hunter could hope for future hunting successes because 1) the bears were, after having been treated with such respect, willing to be killed, and 2) the spiri- tual guardian of game might release more animals</page><page sequence="19">Germonpré and Hàmàlàinen: Bear Ceremonialism in the Belgian Upper Paleolithic 1 9 +- » CO © 4- ' w ctí X © tí o ctí +&gt; » 3 H Oh ctí db o tí "5 #tí g © O «j o Id 2 LO © i s ^ 'S tí - Ctí -- -H rH § |:-goS| .|; 53tì|§ I o« o | - UlíIIÜIi lüil Itlf ! mm " irf-sj ¡es-sgl§ass|§ iiiiü ¡5Ai¡Sas5«l ¡es-sgl§ass|§ í o-dí ® Pí ^S^ típí s qo^¡ tí w opaco h 1 |t¡p¡||gg¡|glsf|« |S||| 15 |ll§.|1¡i|fi|i:.|f:ai H«]s = |i|lS=r¡í" Ssiiíi Hiii dlvljlii ili llfllaflf _ HÍJ5 tìllll Itili II _ I illijt i« !« Miftíli lili ¡¡¡Üli Hi i ill •-* ^^^^^^©(^©^^-©tí tí&gt;^Htx0OCSICI)ntí3 •SS 2 15 e« © 1 ^ ¡ O e« © ^ O</page><page sequence="20">20 Arctic An thropology 44 :2 that could be slain (Edsman 1987; Hallowell 1926; Harva 1959; Jordan 2001; Karsten 1955; Paulson 1959, 1963; Zachrisson and Iregren 1974). Further- more, through the ritual, any feelings of guilt that the hunter might experience could be alleviated (Sokolova 2000; Wunn 2006). Some Siberian people (Khanty, Altaic Turk- ish people, Orochi) held that a bear's spirit resides in its nose, which gave rise to the ritual of nose cutting and the disposal of the nose together with the skull afterwards (Vasilev 1948). Finno-Ugric people, such as the Saami and Mansi, removed the lips and nose (Harva 1959). The Ainu (Soko- lova 2000), the Nivhki and the Ket (Krejnovic 1971) had a similar custom. Likewise, in North Amer- ica, peoples such as the Plains Ojibwa (Skinner 1914), the Northern Saulteaux (Skinner 1911), and the Greenland Inuit (Larsen 1969/70) had respect for the nose and muzzle of the bear. According to Harva (1959) that this peculiar custom persists in regions so far apart, points to its having a very an- cient origin. By respecting the remains of the bear and following certain rites, the relation between peo- ple and bears, and especially between men and the master of the bears, was an enduring one that led to continued success for the hunters (Karhu 1947; Paulson 1965). Skinner (1911) and Tanner (1979) noted that the bear was a substantial arti- cle of diet among the Naskapi and the Eastern Cree (Hàmàlàinen in press). Bear meat was also an im- portant staple for the Alutiiq (Fall and Hutchinson 1996) and the Koyukon (Nelson 1986). Further- more, the killing of a formidable animal such as a cave bear must have conveyed high status to the men who successfully slain it. The bear is, in circumpolar societies, cer- tainly the most spectacular and the most impor- tant terrestrial animal to have its carcass, espe- cially its head, skin and paws, treated ritually. Nevertheless, the bear is not the only animal to re- ceive such treatment. According to Paulson (1963) the ritual of the bear's remains differs only in de- gree from the ceremonial treatment of other mam- mals. These animals, too, could be associated with the color red, e.g., the Saami hunters were sprayed with alder bark juice when bringing home hunted wild reindeer (Holmberg 1964). Other mammals were also entitled to have their remains disposed of in sacred fashion; for example, reindeer antlers, and wolf and wolverine bones were laid down at sacred loci [siejddes] by the Saami (Itkonen 1946), the Khanty deposited elk skulls at holy sites (Jor- dan 2003), the Evenki put the bones from hunted reindeer on platforms near the river or the forest to honor the souls of the animals killed (Gr0n 2005), and the Mistassini Cree displayed bones of hunted mammals, decorated with paint, in trees (Tanner 1979). Discussion and Conclusion The red ochre traces on several fossil bear remains in Belgian caves were shown to have been applied purposely by prehistoric people and were not the result of contamination with spilt ochre or ochre containing sediment. The archaeozoological re- cord shows that in Upper Palaeolithic cave sites bear elements with color traces are mainly remains of the head and paw regions (Table 3). This paral- lels the ethnographic evidence since in many cir- cumpolar societies, the bear head/skull and paws were colored with red or black marks during bear rituals (Tables 4a and 4b), and it was the skull, in particular, that was disposed of at a sacred loca- tion (Table 5). Cave bear assemblage A3 from the Goyet cave included seven ochred cave bear remains: frag- ments from the skull, teeth, and the first cervi- cal vertebrae. The atlas and axis are judged to be- long to the head region (Table 1). These elements were considered to be special according to the eth- nographic evidence. The Saami treated three skel- etal elements of the bears they buried with special care: the skull, the atlas and the axis (Zachris- son and Iregren 1974). The Timiskaming Algon- quin cut off the head of the bear, including the first vertebra, when butchering the carcass (Speck 1915b). The meat around these bones (skull-atlas) is strictly taboo for the Koyukon people (Nel- son 1986), which suggests that this part of the bear body has a special meaning. Further, Evenki women cannot eat the meat at the back of the head and the neck (Abe 2005). The Plains-Cree colored also the head and the neck of the hunted bear (Skinner 1914). One bear bone that does not fit into the scheme of head and paw coloring is an ilium fragment from a cub (Goyet assemblage A2). In the ethnographic context, the Evenki executed special rites with the genitals of the bear during the bear feast (Sokolova 2000). In the Gravettian triple hu- man burial of Dolní Véstonice, the pelvic area of the central individual was, just as the skull, cov- ered with ochre (Klima 1988), as is also the case on the male skeleton burial (DV XVI) at Dolní Véstonice (Svoboda 1988). Gamble (1999) sees these burials as rituals of detachment from social life and he relates the placing of red ochre on the groin of the dead to the invisible attaching ritual of birth, rather than viewing it as a simple signal about sex or gender. In this perspective the ochre staining of a bear ilium is not surprising. The use of red ochre has been considered to be part of Upper Palaeolithic symbolic mortuary behaviors (Hovers et al. 2003). Red ochre depos- ited on the head could suggest a connection be- tween human burials and bear disposals in the Upper Paleolithic. The discovery of several hu-</page><page sequence="21">Germonpré and Hàmalàinen: Bear Ceremonialism in the Belgian Upper Paleolithic 21 man skeletal remains dating from about 25,000 B.P. deposited in bear beds, made by bears in prep- aration for their hibernation, in the ornamented Cussac cave, France (Aujoulat et al., 2002) could confirm such a link. Also in the ethnographic con- text, a connection between the ceremonies for the hunted bear and those for a deceased human has been pointed out. Another symbolic practice during the Upper Paleolithic pointing to a ritual function concerns the deposition of bear elements in places inaccessible to bears (e.g., Chauvet cave: Fosse and Philippe 2005; Robert-Lamblin 2005). The practice of putting bear remains in special places is reminiscent of the Evenki ritual deposi- tion of bear eyes in cuts made into the trunk of sa- cred trees (Gr0n et al. 2003; Paproth 1976). Sim- ilarly, in Tutchone versions of the Yukon myth "The girl who married the bear," the bear eyes had to be put in a crack of a tree (McClellan 1970). This looks, furthermore, akin to the presence of a bear figurine in a rock crevice on Dundas Is- land (High Arctic), near a Late Dorset midden con- taining a bear skull with ochre traces (McGhee 1974/75). The ochred skull and the location of the bear figurine suggest a ritual activity by the Pa- laeo-Eskimos, possibly concerned with bear hunt- ing (Sutherland 2001; McGhee written communi- cation 2004). A further hint of similarity between prehis- toric and traditional behaviors towards bears in a symbolic context is the copying of bear scratches by humans. In the decorated Grande Grotte at Arcy-sur-Cure engravings imitating bear scratches occur on or near bear marks (Baffler and Gi- rard 1998). A similar phenomenon exists also in Chauvet, where long engravings imitate the bear scratches on the spot (Ajoulat and Gély 2001). This custom looks similar to the Evenki habit of making cut marks on trees, lookalikes of scratches made by bears on trees, to communicate territorial- ity to the bears (Gr0n and Turov in press). The hunting of bears provides a strong moti- vation for a ceremonialism. There is archaeozoolog- ical evidence that indicates that during the Upper Paleolithic bears were hunted (Morel and Garcia 2001; Miinzel 1997; Miinzel et al. 2001), skinned (Charles 1997), and eaten (Armand 2006 and ref- erences therein; Miinzel 1997; Miinzel et al. 2001). The major function of the ethnographic bear rituals was to ensure a supply of game in the future. In the absence of any other consistent and coherent explanation that takes into account all the available evidence from Paleolithic studies and ethnographic sources, this paper proposes, pending further evidence, that there was a proto bear-ceremonialism in the Upper Paleolithic. This bear ceremonialism probably consisted of bear hunting and bear rituals, possibly including com- • munal festivities and a bear mythology, during the mid and Late Upper Paleolithic. At times, the caves were used as ceremonial loci by the prehis- toric inhabitants of the region. The ethnographic record shows that bear remains were occasionally deposited in caves (Table 5). However, given the ethnographic evidence, it may be assumed that not only caves, but also trees, scaffolds, or poles could have been utilized as sacred disposal locations for the bear vestiges, although no trace of these have entered the archaeozoological record. This proto bear-ceremonialism dates in Belgium from at least the mid Upper Paleolithic. Two AMS dates (Ta- ble 2) on the colored bear bones from Goyet sug- gest that disposal of the bear remains with ochre occurred at two periods: at about 26,000 B.P. and around 23,600 B.P. (Table 2). Artifacts, bone tools, and ornaments indicate the presence of an Auri- gnacian and a Gravettian in the Goyet cave. The dates of the beginning of the Aurignacian in Bel- gium cluster mainly around 32,000 B.P. (Otte and Groenen 2001). The oldest Gravettian in Bel- gium has been recognized in the open air site of Maisières-Canal and dates from 28,000 B.P. (Otte and Groenen 2001). A small Gravettian rock-shel- ter near the Goyet cave is dated at about 24,400 B.P. (Eloy and Otte 1995). At the Magdalenian cave Trou de Chaleux the proto bear-ceremonialism was present at around 12,850 B.P. The examples noted above of manipulated bear remains in Belgium, Europe, and North America could be interpreted as continuous with bear-related rituals that started with a proto bear- ceremonialism dating from the Gravettian, and possibly even from the Aurignacian. The pres- ence in the Upper Paleolithic of red ochre or black charcoal traces on the bear skull and bones of the bear paws, and the application in ethnographic rituals from all over the circumpolar realm of these same colors on these same bear body parts could be interpreted as similar acts by the people who hunted the animals. It is not possible to be certain whether the ochre and charcoal-applying activities had the same meaning and purpose as the recent bear rituals in the circumpolar hunter- gatherer cosmology. However, given the above, it seems reasonable to conclude that the coloring by red ochre or black charcoal of the bear remains was associated with bear hunting and eating of bear meat and probably formed an integrated part of the proto bear-ceremonialism. During the Upper Paleolithic, contacts must have been necessary to exchange ideas and diffuse the basis of such a proto bear-ceremonialism. Boc- quet-Appel et al. (2005) estimated that in Europe, the hunter-gatherer metapopulation of the Aurigna- cian and Gravettian remained in a quasi-stationary state with about 4400-4800 inhabitants. Demo- graphic density per 100 km2 was very low, with an</page><page sequence="22">22 Arctic Anthropology 44:2 average of 0.17 for the Aurignacian and 0.18 for the Gravettian. Gamble (1982) argued, based on the style conventions held in common over large por- tions of Eurasia, that an open social network ex- isted during the Gravettian. Information, critical for survival, could have been distributed through alliances over the continent (Gamble 1991). Fur- ther, according to Mussi, Cinq-Mars, and Bolduc (2000), a long-lasting, complex and dj^namic chain of communication connected various regions of Eurasia during the mid-Upper Paleolithic, based on a detailed analysis of Gravettian female imag- ery. The high frequency of works of art and human burials imply that the sparse mid-Upper Paleo- lithic hunter-gatherers engaged in important ritu- als. Symbolic activity was employed to outweigh the perils of dispersion over a large region (Mussi and Zampetti 1997). Besides human burials, for which ample evidence is available, a proto bear- ceremonialism could have functioned as the mo- tor for communal gatherings with a ritual char- acter. The chain of communication that probably existed for the distribution of critical information could also have been the vehicle for transmitting the ideas of this proto bear-ceremonialism; thus ex- cluding the possibility that the rituals concerning bears were lost over time and that bears were, time and time again, looked upon with a new eye and independently chosen as an animal worthy of spe- cial attention. Studies such as this should stimulate new discussions concerning the possible connections between modified animal remains and prehis- toric cosmologies. The detailed examination of bear skeletal elements from additional prehistoric sites, especially regarding the occurrence of red ochre or black charcoal, specific cut marks, or the unusual arrangements of fossil bear remains can widen and enrich the debate on the existence of a proto bear-ceremonialism that formed part of the symbolic culture of the Upper Paleolithic people of Europe.
