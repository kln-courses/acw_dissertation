If this scenario were applied to the three works under review here, those by Annis Pratt and Cynthia Hogue, both feminist critics, would be suspected of determinism, while Jahan Ramazani's genre study might be expected to preserve literary autonomy, since genre, though it surely imposes a shape on a literary work, does so from within the field of literature, and thus con- stitutes a type of "self-determination." The extent to which these works do not meet these expectations suggests the extent to which the "politicizing" scenario oversimplifies the complicated nature of literature, society, and their interconnec- tion in individual psychology. As it turns out, Annis Pratt imposes the most severe restrictions on literary autonomy, chiefly in response, however, to psychological rather than social determinism. Though far from Pratt's extreme reductionism, Jahan Ramazani makes larger concessions to social determinism than he probably intends, at the same time that he short-circuits the social relation peculiar to liter- ature, that of author and reader. Because she understands that relation as simulta- Terence Diggory, Professor of English at Skidmore College, has written books on W. B. Yeats and Wil- iam Carlos Williams.

Although both Hogue and Pratt write poetry as well as study it, Pratt locates subjectivity elsewhere, in the "archetypes" for which poetry, as she treats it, serves as an inert repository. These are not the archetypes that constitute literature as "social fact" for Northrop Frye, although Pratt pays special attention to Frye's char- acterization of Canadian literature because, compared to the rest of his criticism, it appears relatively free of patriarchal bias, a freedom that Pratt sees as proof of "inductive" method. Why a critic should be more inductive when treating his own national literature, in which he is most likely to have a personal stake, is only one of many assumptions that Pratt leaves unexamined. Her own method, despite her pride in assembling over four hundred poems as "data," is not inductive but rigidly prescriptive, along the lines of the archetypal criticism derived from C. G. Jung. As a feminist archetypalist, however, Pratt writes her prescription not strictly for sep- aration from the mother, as in the case of orthodox Jungianism, but for "coming to terms" with the mother (234) as the terms are enlarged from the personal to the universal. Through a succession of sections devoted to the archetypal figures of Medusa, Aphrodite, and Artemis, as treated in English-language poetry of diverse periods, Pratt charts "the right path to psychological health" (339): first, through differentiation from the mother; second, through acceptance of feminine sexuality; and finally, through a synthesis of the maternal and the sexual feminine in a tran- scendent "natural" being. Within each section, Pratt groups poems, by both men and women, on a scale ranging from "negative" rejection of the archetype to "pos- itive" embrace. Some of the results of this exercise are familiar from previous efforts at so- called Jungian criticism. Pratt demonstrates, once again, that a method of reading that finds more "empowerment" in Mary Elizabeth Coleridge's "The Other Side of a Mirror" than in Sylvia Plath's "Medusa" is not concerned with the power of poetry. Archetypal criticism typically renders the medium transparent in the service of revealing the "deep background," as Pratt calls it, from which the archetype is assumed to derive its power. What is new in Pratt's version of such criticism is her understanding of that background, an understanding that she does not divulge until the final pages of her book, as if the preceding pages were intended as an ordeal to test the reader's worthiness to be initiated into the Truth. I can testify to the ordeal, but not in the sense that Pratt might intend it; certainly, in my experience, it did not promote the leap of faith that Pratt requires. Where Jung asks us to accept the notion of an unconscious mind beyond the limits of the individual, Pratt asks us to accept the notion of an "immanent" mind beyond the limits of the human, per- vading all of nature, and revealed by the enlargement of feminist vision to that of "ecofeminism." Stripping the Artemis archetype of its "anthropomorphic" disguise,</page><page sequence="3">REVIEW: POETRY AND EMPOWERMENT 841 Pratt concludes her book with a series of poems about human encounters with bears. She submerges feminist values in what she calls "bear values" (341), and she questions whether "these bear poems are products only of the human mind" (363). For Pratt, poems that reflect "right relationship" (360-61) to the environment speak with the voice of Nature (256). From the perspective of literary criticism, it is hard to imagine a more extreme version of the "intentional fallacy," for while Pratt attempts to ground the poem's meaning in prior intention, it is prior even to the "human mind" of its author. Pratt's ground is quite literally ground; it is embod- ied as much in stone as in natural creatures usually regarded as animate. Never doubting that poems are a human product, Jahan Ramazani avoids the intentional fallacy, in the more usual sense, by concentrating on the production of meaning in the language of the poem rather than in the prior intention of the human author. Although he employs psychoanalytic theory, in this case derived from Freud rather than Jung, to provide a framework for understanding the work of mourning performed in the elegy, Ramazani explicitly rejects the evaluation of poetry by therapeutic norms such as those Annis Pratt employs. In fact, Ramazani's thesis is that the modern elegy is characterized by a "melancholic" mode of mourn- ing that refuses to accept the substitutions for loss through which the normal process of mourning restores psychic health, according to Freud. This thesis poses a problem for the connection that Ramazani attempts to forge between literature and society, since he claims, on the one hand, a peculiarly modern need for elegies in a century of mechanized mass death and commodified grief, yet he does not explain, on the other hand, how "melancholic" mourning in particular, rather than the art of elegy in general, answers this need. Nevertheless, Ramazani's thesis sharpens his eye for every detail in a poem that opposes or more subtly undermines the conventions of the traditional elegy of consolation. As a result, his book is unquestionably valuable as a collection of fine close readings, if not as a contribu- tion to "cultural studies." At first glance, the organization of the book gives no indication that the hot topics of current "cultural studies," gender and race, colonialism and imperialism, are even to be acknowledged. Seven chapters are named simply for the authors whose work is treated, and they are for the most part safely canonical: Hardy, Wil- fred Owen, Stevens, Langston Hughes, Auden, Plath, and Heaney. Two additional chapters are designated "American Family Elegy I" and "II." It turns out, however, that these chapters are divided along gender lines, the first devoted to men (Low- ell, Berryman, Ginsberg, Harper), the second to women (Sexton, Rich, and Clampitt). Not only is homosexuality taken into account in Ramazani's treatment of Auden and Ginsberg, but in the latter case the "narrative of his mother's life" that Ginsberg presents in "Kaddish" "modulates into a psychosexual explanation of his homosexuality" (249). That is, extrapoetic concerns begin to determine Ramazani's reading. Similarly, although Ramazani leaves no doubt that he gen-</page><page sequence="4">842 COLLEGE ENGLISH uinely admires Langston Hughes as an artist, he also suggests that Hughes's poetry acquires some of its power not because Hughes is an artist but because he is black and thus, in America, a member of an oppressed group. This leads Ramazani to speculate about other writers, for instance, about whether "Yeats's Easter elegy suc- ceeded in part because he wrote from the position of the colonized, commemorat- ing victims of imperialist aggression" (173-74). Ramazani should know better. In a previous study devoted exclusively to Yeats as an elegist, far from explaining "Easter 1916" as the product of historical victimization, Ramazani reads the poem rather as testimony to the power of language to subsume and transform all external con- ditions, including the author's intention. In the words of Theodor Adorno quoted by Ramazani: "the voice of language itself is heard" (Ramazani, Yeats and the Poetry of Death [New Haven: Yale UP, 1990], 64). Usually, this is the voice that Ramazani hears in Poetry of Mourning. As I have said, his attention to that voice engages him much more deeply in the verbal tex- ture of the poetry than is the case with Annis Pratt, who listens for the voice of Nature. Despite their differences, however, these two approaches converge in their subjugation of the reader to an impersonal force, Nature in the one case, in the other case Language. Although both Ramazani and Pratt seek to empower the reader-that would be the modern elegy's answer to the cultural need Ramazani feels it addresses-both make the mistake of assuming that merely presenting a source of power (language, nature) will inspire the reader with power rather than abject terror. But the psychic pilgrimage prescribed by Pratt begins with the abjec- tion evoked by the terrifying figure of Medusa; that is, rendering her as a monster permits separation (ab-jection) from the power she represents, ultimately that of the mother. In the more fashionable updating of Freud assumed by Ramazani, abjection is the prelude to submission to symbolic law, the law of language. Hence it is the function of elegy to render the object it purports to mourn as an abject, a lifeless corpse, because the language of the elegy itself has staked an exclusive claim on life. Literally at the center of Ramazani's study is W. H. Auden's elegy for Yeats, "showing," according to Ramazani, "that Yeats the person was no more than a pas- sive vessel 'by whom' language 'lives' " (189). As a feminist critic, Cynthia Hogue begins her study with the recognition that the role of abjection that Auden's elegy imposes on Yeats, according to Ramazani, has traditionally been imposed on women. Hogue illustrates the basic scenario in one of the originary moments of the elegiac tradition, the legend of Pan and Syrinx, in which Pan acquires his pipes, emblematic of poetic power, by losing the nymph he wished to possess sexually. Since her body has been transformed into the pipes that Pan plays to mourn her loss, she has become quite literally, in Ramazani's terms, the "passive vessel" by whom all symbolic art, including poetry, lives. In the light, once again, of psychoanalytic theory, in this case principally Jacques Lacan's revision of Freud and Julia Kristeva's revision of Lacan, Hogue concedes psycho-</page><page sequence="5">REVIEW: POETRY AND EMPOWERMENT 843 logical force to this scenario, but she notes that it poses a dilemma to the woman seeking to acquire artistic power. On the one hand, such power is predicated on woman's abjection; on the other hand, a woman who abjects herself endures a split- ting that separates at least a part of herself from the very power she seeks. To understand how women have produced poetry out of this dilemma, Hogue turns to the work of Emily Dickinson, Marianne Moore, H. D., and Adrienne Rich. In this progression, Hogue finds an increasing level of political commitment-that is, a commitment to changing society rather than merely changing one's identifi- cation within society-and an increasing conviction that poetry has the power to effect such change. Hogue would agree with Annis Pratt that the release of such power depends on coming to terms with a maternal function, but for Hogue, fol- lowing Kristeva, that function operates within language and not in the reified "voice of nature" that Hogue identifies with the Romantic sublime. Thus, Hogue, like Ramazani, listens closely to the language of her authors, but what she listens for is the emergence, rather than the death, of subjectivity. In contrast to the method of reading employed by Auden, according to Ramazani, to reduce Yeats to passivity, Hogue proposes a method of "listening" that "is not passive but actively builds bridges between subjects positioned by, as well as shifting between, internal and external differences" (200). Among the positions Hogue has in mind here are those of male and female, author and reader. Hogue's exploration of the possibili- ties of female authorship empowers all readers, whether male or female, by releas- ing them from the fixed position of being "spoken to" by the voice of Nature or the voice of Language. As Hogue concludes, "Empowerment evolves through ex- change based on listening to, not talking at-a disengagement from the structures of dominance" (200). Not every reader will find Hogue easy to listen to. Offsetting, to some extent, her engagement with her authors' texts is her involvement in a theoretical nexus far more dense than that presented by either Pratt or Ramazani. The profusion of jar- gon creates a dizzying spiral of refinements within refinements as Hogue attempts, for instance, to distinguish her own sense of "masquerade" from that of Lacan. In addition to the technical vocabulary, Hogue's syntax self-consciously enacts the structural displacements by which, in her reading, women poets negotiate the "splitting" that empowers them as authors. For example, Dickinson's poem 675 ("Essential oils") activates feminine abjection-the dead woman at the heart of elegy-as an odor, at the same time that it claims to keep the dead under passive restraint. So Hogue writes, "That odor, of course, is from what we might see (or what we can't see but can certainly smell) as keeping the expulsion of femininity in Dickinson's poems, upon which the unification of the self depends, incomplete" (63). It may take several readings before we can confidently identify the structure that is completed by that final word "incomplete." Hogue recognizes that poetry threatens contemporary audiences with a similarly daunting appearance-"at best,</page><page sequence="6">844 COLLEGE ENGLISH exotic; at worst, incomprehensible" (199)-yet that does not diminish her confi- dence in poetry's power to transform human lives, one reader at a time. The power of poetry, in this conception, is not magically conferred from outside, but experi- enced within the reader. If the work is real, so are the rewards.</page></plain_text>
