<plain_text><page sequence="1">A PERSONAL POST(HUMAN)SCRIPT: FURTHER READING/READING FURTHER G. THOMAS COUSER From the initial impulse onward, Gillian Whitlock has been the prime shaper of the issue you hold in your hands (or view on your screen). When Gillian recruited me to serve as her co-editor, I was both flattered and mystified. Flat tered because of my high regard for her, mystified because nothing in my pre vious work directly addressed the posthuman. I was not then, nor am I today, expert on the many versions or ramifications of what is still an emerging ism. I was, however, intrigued by the notion of posthuman life writing as a devel oping mode of representation. So I have been happy to follow Gillian's lead in this pioneering issue, and to help edit the contributions. Given the nature of our collaboration, it seems appropriate that she should introduce it and that I should write an afterword. Flaving done some background reading, heard the contributors' presenta tions in Honolulu over Labor Day weekend in 2011, and read and responded to drafts of all of their articles, I have a better grasp of posthumanism and a new appreciation for the possibilities of posthuman life writing. At the out set, I had a naive view of posthumanism as something that follows human ism, as postmodernism succeeded modernism and poststructuralism succeed ed structuralism. Such a posthumanism would be radical and transgressive, challenging, if not opposing, the tenets and values of humanism. It would be found at, or beyond, the fringes of what we consider to be life writing, in new forms and media. Some of what we regard as posthumanist life writing fits that template. In this issue, the best example is what Louis van den Hengel discusses as zoegra phy (his word), especially the work of the Australian Tissue Culture and Art Project, which designs and begets new life forms—truly living art projects. Such work is obviously posthuman, and it qualifies as a kind of life writing (in the broad sense)—with the proviso that the life "written" is not "life" as we Biography 35.1 (Winter 2012) © Biographical Research Center</page><page sequence="2">Couser, A Personal Post(human) Script 191 know it, i.e., bios. He persuades me that life can be represented in forms other than the bodies of humans—or other naturally occurring species. Indeed, his discussion reminded me of a huge bioart work I have seen in two versions and venues (a gallery in Chelsea, New York, and the Museum of Old and New Art in Tasmania). Created by a Belgian artist, Wim Delvoye, Cloaca is a forty-foot long contraption; tubes connect a number of heavy cyl inders to form a gigantic biomechanical alimentary canal. Food is fed into a hopper at one end, enzymes digest it in the various cylinders, and feces comes out the other. While Cloaca is not alive—not self-sustaining—it mimics or reproduces the work of an organic digestive system, right down to a suscepti bility to constipation and diarrhea. I confess that when I first beheld Cloaca, I didn't think of it as life writing. I didn't know what to think of it. But it would seem to be a form of zoegraphy, insofar as it carries on, in nonanimal form, a process necessary to animal life. If nothing else, it suggests how com plex animals are, how compact and efficient their vital organs, and how dif ficult it is to simulate their functions. While its intent may have been satiri cal—an elaborate machine designed to produce nothing more than crap—it also seems to partake of a zoegraphic impulse to reproduce bodily processes outside of bodies, for purposes of examination and reflection. It may thus at once enact and undercut the transhumanist strain of posthumanism, which explores the possibilities of transcending the finite limits of the human, free ing the being from the human body. The more radically it breaks with humanism, however, the less compat ible posthumanism seems with what we recognize as life writing, leading one to wonder whether the term "posthumanist life writing," while not an oxy moron, may denote a very small, indeed negligible, set of eccentric projects. In response to reading these essays, however, I find myself scanning the ho rizons of representation looking for novelties of this sort, or reevaluating fa miliar phenomena. Less radical than the tissue art project, but apropos here is Rebecca Skloot's The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks. Skloot's book is not a biography of its titular subject; rather, it traces what we might call Lacks's cellular afterlife: the use of cells harvested (without permission or compensa tion) from her cancerous tissues to generate an immortal line of cells (called HeLa) used long after her death in medical research. In doing so, Skloot's book explores ethical questions as to the boundaries of personhood and one's property rights to one's "own" body. (In addition, it may raise its own issues as to who profits from the story of those cells.) Here is life writing, then, that is both posthumous and posthumanist—not the narrative of a single discrete individual but rather the tracing of two lines of descent—one "immortal," a peculiar kind of nonhuman offspring; the other all too human, Lacks's</page><page sequence="3">192 Biography 35.1 (Winter 2012) children and human heirs, who did not benefit from the sale of her cells nor from the medical advances they enabled. Skloot's book ventures into a new zone of life writing, made possible—perhaps made necessary—by advances in medical technology. Similarly, Tully Barnett's and Laurie McNeill's articles direct our atten tion to ways in which interactive cybernetic social media can supplement and extend—but also shape and constrain—the identities and narratives of those who engage with them. McNeill's article suggests (to me) the dangers inher ent in a kind of relationality that is mediated entirely through software that has its own corporate agendas and analytical algorithms. (Given their vulner ability to abuse, I've often thought of "social media" as something of a mis nomer. At worst, they use the web as spiders do.) Barnett's carrier (which I can't help thinking of as a kind of Liverbook) has a benign agenda, and yet it clearly overwrites its participants' intentions when it infects them, willy nilly, with a virtual virus. Both articles suggest ways in which new platforms for self-representation can undermine old humanist notions of autonomy and self-determination and the notion of discrete bodily boundaries. And they suggest ways in which single bodily organs can serve as virtual interfaces among individuals dispersed in time and space. These recent forms of posthumanist life writing are not necessarily writ ten, much less narrative. Part of what makes them posthumanist is precisely their departure from traditional media, which seem more amenable to autho rial agency. An obvious place for the emergence of posthumanist life writing is at the boundary of the animal and the human. In the wake of Marley and Me, a blockbuster success as a memoir and then as a film, pet memoirs have mul tiplied like gerbils. But, like the animalographies discussed by Cynthia Huff and Joel Haefner, pet memoirs are generally quite conventional—often high ly anthropomorphic and sentimental—in their depiction of animals. (Not that there's anything wrong with that. I regularly email details of our cat's lat est mischief and mayhem to a select set of friends.) Even while such tame pet memoirs are hardly posthumanist, they do extend the notion of relational life writing to include our important relationships with companion animals. More significant with regard to posthumanism, though, is the rise of the animal biography proper: for example, Lauren Hillenbrand's Seabiscuit (2002), Paul Chambers's Jumbo (2009), and Susan Orlean's Rin Tin Tin (2011). Such books hew to the conventions of human biography insofar as they depict the lives of celebrated animals; nevertheless, the elevation of non human beings to the status of subjects worthy of biography does seem a sign of our posthumanist times.</page><page sequence="4">Couser, A Personal Post(human) Script 193 Perhaps more truly posthumanist is Irene Pepperberg's Alex and Me (2008). Alex, an African gray parrot, and Irene, a scientist studying animal cognition, had a complex long-term (thirty-year) relationship. They lived to gether, but Alex was not (just) a companion animal; he was also Pepperberg's research subject. The book, then, is not (just) a pet memoir. In addition to passing along heart-warming stories about Alex (his last words to her were reportedly, "You be good. I love you."), Pepperberg documents feats of un expected avian intelligence. To the extent that the book documents a rela tionship that led Pepperberg to relocate the boundary between human and animal intelligence, it is, I think, a posthumanist narrative. A more exploratory kind of posthumanist life writing is found in Jenny Diski's What I Don't Know about Animals (2011). This is, appropriately, a dif ficult book to categorize—or even to summarize. Although it "covers" much of Diski's life span in chronological order, it's hardly a conventional autobi ography or memoir. It's certainly not confessional, in the usual sense. Indeed, most of it is expository, rather than narrative, in mode. As the title suggests, it focuses on Diski's relations with animals, rather than with human others. In it Diski catalogs, and reassesses, her lifelong relations with nonhuman species from childhood on. Significantly, she does not limit herself to real animals: in addition to her pet cats and zoo animals, she includes her stuffed toys, animal characters in books she read as a child, and even the insects she fantasized for a time infested her body, getting literally under her skin. She thus acknowl edges that our relations with nonhuman species are mediated in part through imaginary animals. In other chapters, she reflects on the methodology of ob serving animals, the pathologies of animal hoarding and bestiality, and the ethics of eating animals. To broaden her experience with animals, she even attempts horse-back riding, with mixed emotions: To be in control of a horse, it's necessary to be able to communicate with it, and to enable it to communicate with you. I can see the fascination of that, but I still don't want to be in control. I also don't want to be out of control. (277) In contrast to Pepperberg, Diski has no preset agenda, nor does she have a commitment to a particular creature (though in lieu of an author photo, the paperback edition boasts a picture of her cat on her keyboard). Without offer ing firm conclusions, much less recommendations—whether it's okay to eat meat, say—Diski feels, thinks, and writes her way toward a new, more com plex understanding of the way her life and her identity have been informed and shaped by her relations with non-human species—real, imitation, and</page><page sequence="5">194 Biography 35.1 (Winter 2012) imaginary. She thus represents herself as embedded in a larger web of living things in a way that seems distinctly posthumanist. Now in my mid-sixties, I have more and more contemporaries whose bodies incorporate animal parts—like heart valves from pigs or cows—or manmade parts—pacemakers, artificial knees, artificial hip joints (or in my case, intraocular lenses). In these integrations of nonhuman parts into human bodies, the cyborg rears its bionic head. If, as I suggest in Signifying Bodies (2 f£), the memoir boom has coincided with a rise in some body memoirs—life stories focusing on what it's like to live with, in, or as a particular (usually anomalous) body—then we can expect more narratives by and about beings who are, to one degree or another, cyborgs. (I've never been comfortable with that term, much less the notion that cyborgs are a distinct species, but the term's currency makes it unavoidable.) Contrary to my initial impression that posthumanism was a successor to humanism is the idea, articulated by Katherine Hayles and others, that hu mans have always been posthuman, insofar as we have relied on nonhuman animals and on various "prostheses," including such basic tools as language and writing. Indeed, one understanding of posthumanism suggests that the body itself is the first prosthesis (Hayles 3). From this perspective, people who rely on artificial prostheses may be a kind of posthumanist vanguard— posthumanist avant la lettre—insofar as they may be more aware of the hu man dependence on "externals," and less likely to indulge in the fantasy of complete autonomy and the transhumanist disavowal of embodiment. So disabled people's life writing may be another site for the emergence of post humanist narratives. As Leigh Gilmore's and Julia Watson's articles suggest, people whose bodies (and minds) are in extremis—those suffering chronic pain and mental illness—may generate narratives suggesting the possibilities of agency with out mastery. Certainly, impairments can embed humans in particularly inter dependent human-animal relationships. Two narratives by blind writers, for example, focus on their relationships with their service dogs: Stephen Kuu sisto's Planet of the Blind and Rod Michalko's The Two-in-One. Kuusisto is a poet, and his book is quite lyrical in its mode. But ultimately it is a coming out story: it is through his decision to adopt a service dog that Kuusisto fi nally affirms his blindness, which his harnessed dog announces to the world. His service dog, however, is not merely a sign but also a co-creator and con stituent of his blind identity. Michalko is a sociologist, and his book is predictably quite different in tone and method. Less a narrative than a disquisition, Michalko's book brings to bear on his experience with his first service dog the work of a wide range</page><page sequence="6">Couser, A Personal Post(human) Script 195 of thinkers, including Karl Mannheim, Maurice Merleau-Ponty, and Hans Georg Gadamer. His key insight is that Smokie quite literally extends his em bodiment and thus subtly but profoundly changes his being in the world. The hyphenated title, "the two-in-one," reflects Michalko's sense that he and Smokie comprise a unit greater than the sum of its two very different partners. Not only does Smokie extend Michalko's "personal space"—his "reach," so to speak; connected to Smokie through a harness, Michalko experiences the world through a different sensorium. It is not (just) that Smokie "sees" for Rod: the human animal is oriented to his surroundings by a creature whose senses are "differendy abled" (to repurpose a disability euphemism) and ar ranged in a different hierarchy from Michalko's: I experienced a sudden and surprising sense of security. ... I felt a sense of stabil ity that seemed to come from the firmness and strength of [the dog's] shoulder. I also experienced a sense of distance, an expansion of my immediate environment. It seemed as though my "sense of touch" was enhanced by [the dog] and his harness. I could "feel" further than I ever had before. ... I felt my tactile sense replacing my sense of sight as the "distance sense." (26-27) People with significant impairments come to realize that autonomy is not the same thing as independence; being empowered to make decisions is more important than doing for oneself. This message is implicit, if not explicit, in the medium of disability memoir. But blind users of service dogs need at times to cede such autonomy. Thus, a distinctively posthumanist feature of Michalko's experience is the occasional surrender of agency to his nonhuman partner. While being trained (I use the word advisedly) to use his first dog, Michalko is struck by the seeming contradiction between being told both to "show him who's boss" and to "follow your dog" (70). At times, "service ani mals" serve by ¿/«obeying their "masters"—contravening their commands, so to speak. Both partners are taught that sometimes the dog will know better than the human. Michalko puts it this way: For the blind person and dog guide, leadership is not a static or immutable posi tion held only by the human partner but something dynamic and fluid that flows from one partner to the other and back again—a relationship of trust flowing freely through the harness in both directions. They lead and follow one another through the world, moving as one. In this movement, they discover their world, come to understand it, and graciously meet any challenges as opportunities the world holds out to them. (72-73) It occurs to me that, generalized to the species as a whole, this could serve as a manifesto of one strain of posthumanism.</page><page sequence="7">196 Biography 35.1 (Winter 2012) One possible referent of the term posthuman, as distinct from posthu manfir, would be post-apocalyptic: posthumanity. The extinction of our race would seem to preclude life writing altogether: in this sense, the adjective posthuman negates the noun life writing. Rosanne Kennedy explores a variant of this term; we already live in a distinctly "posthuman" world in the sense that our presence on the planet has constituted a distinct epoch, the Anthro pocene, and life writing is an apt medium for tracing the impact of human ity's footprint. Such is in part the project of the environmental memoir. As she notes, in American life writing at least, Henry David Thoreau is the pro genitor of this genre. In Walden, he not only performs a kind of literary arche ology of his environs, examining its previous habitation by Native Americans and African Americans, he deliberately devises and models a way of life that would leave a lighter footprint on the land. He is certainly the forefather of contemporary environmental memoirists like Terry Tempest Williams and stunt memoirists like Colin Beavan. Williams's Refuge: An Unnatural History of Family and Place combines memoir with nature writing to explore links between cancer and environmental degradation in her home state of Utah. The gist of Beavan's No Impact Man is stated in its subtitle: The Adventures of a Guilty Liberal who Attempts to Save the Planet, and the Discoveries He Makes about Himself and Our Way of Life in the Process. We can describe such life writing as preemptively and anti- posthuman. That is, it attempts to write hu man life in such a way that it will continue to be sustainable indefinitely. Perhaps the most pregnant idea in our discussion emerged in a draft of Leigh Gilmore's paper. The wording did not survive revision in its entirety, but as I recall, the gist was as follows. Whereas autobiography has tradition ally been a vehicle for inscribing and reinforcing key aspects of humanism— the stability, uniqueness, and integrity of the self; the ideals of autonomy, agency, mastery, and self-sufficiency, and so on—life writing emanating from bodies in extremis, such as chronic pain narrative, tends to situate "self representation in relations of dependence and interdependence across living and non-living matter." In a nutshell, then, perhaps we can say that post humanist life writing expresses what humanist life writing has historically repressed or denied—the reality that, individually and collectively, humans are deeply dependent on each other (especially, but not exclusively, at the be ginning and end of life); on other species (for sustenance, labor, raw material, and companionship); and of course, to an increasing extent, on technology. There is nothing new about the imbrication of our species in these complex relationships; what is new is our recognition of them. (And that is why, as Sidonie Smith demonstrates, posthumanism can be a way of reinterpreting classic life writing texts.)</page><page sequence="8">Couser, A Personal Post(human) Script 197 It is in this sense that humans have always been posthuman. It is only now that we venture to acknowledge, and reckon with the implications of, this underlying reality. In the future, life writing will necessarily reflect or ac tively explore this aspect of human being. Perhaps we can say, then, that we are most human when we are posthuman.
