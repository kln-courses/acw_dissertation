Francisco Nieva The Problematics of a Postmodern Theater I. *lr i.unt a * *1. T 0 u s ? HE postmodern literary debate, launched in 1959 by Irving Howe, has not accorded theater the attention that prose and poetry have abundantly enjoyed. In fact, there is yet to be agreement on the origins of this so important cultural current. Alfonso de Toro casts doubt on previous asser- tions when in 1990 he locates postmodernism's beginnings in Rudolf Pannwitz's 1917 application of the term to describe European historical and social crisis that took place from the second half of the nineteenth century to the early 1920s (38). As we know, theorists such as Matei Calinescu earlier did link postmod- ernism with Arnold J. Toynbee's 1954 characterization in Study of History, 8-13 of Western history since 1875 (134). For Ihab Hassan, the term originated in Federico de Onis, who used it in his 1934 429</page><page sequence="2">430 Komla Aggor HR 68 (2000) Antologia de la poesia espaTiola e hispanoamericana, (1882-1932) (Romanticism 117).1 When the debate on postmodernism finally involved theater, it concentrated on performance rather than on the literary text. It was not until 1985 that June Schlueter, in an essay, drew attention to the postmodern tendency in drama; even so, the essay devoted itself more to presenting an overview of twentieth-century theater than to mapping out any theoretical formulations of postmodem drama. Given that there is little agreement over what constitutes postmod- ernism in general (since there are several versions of postmodem- ism), it becomes even more exacting to claim stable criteria for postmodern theater. Wladimir Krysinski offers a plausible explana- tion for this difficulty: Cuando decimos el "teatro postmoderno" sobreentendemos un orden heter6clito de fen6menos artisticos cuyo comfin denominador no puede ser el postmodernismo, dado que 6ste no se define de manera univoca. Corresponde a una categoria hibrida en que se mezclan la historia, la filosoffa, la estetica y la sociologia. El transplantarla al teatro no ocurre sin arbitrariedades .... No hay una globalidad del teatro porque no hay una unidad del teatro .... El teatro no tiene una identidad estable. (172-73) In the field of Hispanic theater, Toro paved the way for a critical dialogue by proposing in 1990 a semiotic model for the study of Latin-American and Spanish postmodern theater. But, as Wilfried Floeck would later point out, in his illustrations, Toro makes no reference to Spanish plays ("Teatro y posmodemidad" 157). In an- other article, "Escritura dramidtica y posmodemidad: el teatro actual, entre neorrealismo y vanguardia," Floeck notes that Toro's model reduces postmodernism to an aesthetic, when it is primarily con- sidered to be a philosophical-ideological formula ("Escritura drama- tica" 12). It was, therefore, left to Ignacio Amestoy Egiguren to initiate, as late as 1996, the necessary critical attempt aimed at exploring the connexion between Spanish drama and postmoder- 1 One of the most comprehensive accounts of the modemism-postmodemism debate is Jose Luis Pinillos' El coraz6n del laberinto (1997). In this impressive work, Pinillos recalls an earlier use of the term "postmodem" about 1870 by John Watkins Chapman to announce an art exhibition, which Chapman considered to be more modem than the most advanced at the time (186).</page><page sequence="3">Postmodern Playwright 431 nism. In his essay, "Un realismo posmodemo," this playwright and critic inserts the "generaci6n del 82" (sometimes referred to as "generaci6n puente") within the literary culture of postmodemism, discovering in the group what he calls "un nuevo realismo-mais cercano al efecto realidad que a la realidad misma" (ADE Teatro 91). In order to distinguish the 1982 Generation from the under- ground playwrights of avant-garde orientation, who belong to The New Wave Theater of the 1970s, Amestoy lists the writers that constitute this latter group and affirms: "Ellos fueron los que repre- sentaron en nuestra escena-real o imaginaria-la vanguardia teatral espafiola. Tras ellos surge aquella promoci6n de los posvanguardis- tas, de los posmodernos" (ADE Teatro 91).2 This critic's classifica- tions are problematic, because they inaccurately suggest that post- modemrn Spanish theater begins after the 1970s. Amestoy's equation of postmodernism with post-avant-gardism is also misleading, since The New Wave Theater group that he refers to as avant-garde is, strictly-speaking, neo-avant-garde; The New Wave Theater is, of course, not directly associated with the 1920s avant-garde move- ment. Upon a careful examination, one finds that not only does the avant-garde theater of the 1970s constitute a fertile ground for post- modernist tendencies, but that long before 1970 postmodernism had registered strong echoes in the work of arguably the most innovative avant-garde voice of contemporary Spanish theater: Francisco Morales Nieva. My objective in this essay, therefore, is to establish Nieva as a postmodern dramatist and to explore his particular vision of postmodernism as conceptualized in his dramatic theory and as effected in his theater in general. In so doing, this essay aims to 2 In Spanish Underground Drama, George E. Wellwarth designates as "under- ground" the playwrights of The New Wave Theater who were born between the early 1920s (e.g., Jose Maria Bellido) and early 1940s (e.g., Jer6nimo L6pez Mozo) and whose avant-garde-style productions began to be publicized from 1966 onward. 3 Born in 1924 in Valdepefias, Spain, Francisco Nieva is one of the most important writers of contemporary Spain. Besides being a playwright, he is a director, an essayist, a novelist, as well as a renowned set designer and painter. Since the late 1940s when he began writing plays, Nieva has produced over forty pieces, the majority of them performed (although only after General Franco's death). Nieva has won major prizes, among which are the Polignac (1963), the Mayte (1976), and the National Prize of Theater (1980 and 1992). In 1986 he was elected a member of the Royal Spanish Academy. He now lives in Madrid where he devotes most of his time to writing novels.</page><page sequence="4">432 Komla Aggor HR 68 (2000) redefine the existing historical boundaries of postmodern Spanish theater. An Unclassifiable Theater Nieva's dramatic art resists any single, absolute definition and classification. Although intensely avant-garde in orientation, Nieva's theater has little in common with that of The New Wave Theater group with whom he is sometimes associated. It is also not an easy task to establish an internal unity or logical sequence within Nieva's own world of productions.4 Further, his hermetic, Baroque diction often produces an extremely complex drama opposed to unilateral interpretation by readers/critics and spectators/directors alike. What makes Nieva's work still more difficult to classify is the ex- traordinary heterogeneity of antecedents that inform it. In an impor- tant interview, Nieva enumerates the multiplicity of voices that con- stitute his theater: Cervantes' entremeses, the Celestina, Quevedo, Gracian, Artaud, Brecht, Beckett, Ionesco, Jarry and the surrealists, Bernard Shaw, Pirandello, Valle-Inclin, Lorca, Alberti, Aub, Fellini, Pasolini, Btichner, Ghelderode, Juan Ruiz... (Vicente Mosquete 15). This diversity is not coincidental but stems directly from the play- wright's artistic philosophy, which falls in line with his notion of postmodernism: El defecto de las vanguardias es que han sido muy unilaterales. Coercitivas. Cosas como el cubismo o el dadaismo-el surrealismo, no tanto-son unas fajas muy estrechas. Y algo de eso ocurre con lo que se llama postmodernidad (donde tambien me encuentro de alguin modo) y que arrastra un cierto amaneramiento, en la medida en que se hace una especie de teoria unilateral sobre el collage .... Pero no es eso. La verdadera postmodernidad es no tener en cuenta la modernidad antigua y pasada, que tenia fijaciones muy especificas que limitaban la personalidad del artista. (Vicente Mosquete 15; emphasis added) More than a decade later, Nieva, in his first article devoted to the topic of postmodernism, "iC6mo saber si somos postmodemos?," 4 Nieva himself complicates even more the aesthetic categorization of his plays by reclassifying them in an ambiguous and sometimes apparently illogical manner in the 1991 edition of his complete works. Jesus Maria Barraj6n (1994) devotes an article to the confusion and problems created by these new classifications.</page><page sequence="5">Postmodern Playwright 433 reaffirms his earlier stand: "La modernidad me contrariaba, porque era lineal e invalidaba todo pasado. Tenfa como anteojeras progre- sistas, que erosionaban todos los matices, que radicalizaban 'sin motivo' " (1998: 5). For Nieva, then, true postmodernism involves a symbiotic accom- modation of tendencies; it represents for him what postmodern architecture does for Paolo Portoghesi-"a polycentric network of experiences, all deserving to be heard" (26). What inspires Nieva's sweeping criticism of modernism, the avant-garde, and postmoder- nism itself is not a desire to distance his own theater from these categories but to caution against the common propensity to muffle artistic diversity. Naturally, therefore, in Nieva's vision, no polarity can exist between postmodernism and avant-gardism; on the con- trary, he sees postmodernism as a superstructure bolstered by van- guardist pillars, especially surrealism, where conflicting elements come to interact freely. It must be recalled that the ideological foundation of the avant-garde itself is heterogeneous, and as a movement it draws on various systems and combines its borrowings to make up its own doctrine (Szabolcsi 58). Toward a Dramatic Theory Nowhere does Nieva's vanguardist formation merge with his postmodern orientation more forcefully than in his immersion in "el postismo," the 1940s avant-gardist movement based on surrealist precepts that placed emphasis on imagination and eclecticism as vital inspiration for the literary work. For Nieva, the attraction lies in the possibility created by this eclecticism for artistic independence and individual creativity: "El 'postismo' cargaba sobre si ligeramente con toda la tradici6n y toda la modernidad como punto de partida para una multitud de composiciones personales, haciendo posible un retorno al individualismo mis fecundo" (qtd. in Pont, El postismo 549). So important is Nieva's engagement with the postist school of thought that Jaume Pont accentuates the experience as essential in laying the basis of what would become the playwright's dissident dramaturgy ("Nieva, en el postismo" 16-17). What is even more significant is that Nieva himself establishes this theory- championed by Eduardo Chicharro, Jr., Carlos Edmundo de Ory, and Silvano Sernesi-as an early version of what was later acclaimed as post- modernism:</page><page sequence="6">434 Komla Aggor HR 68 (2000) Dentro de aquel regimen [del postismo]... nos tomaron a chunga, pero tengo la impresi6n de que el movimiento habia entrevisto un poco la postmodernidad (por eso se llamaba postismo) y se habia adelantado en muchos afios a una evoluci6n del arte, que luego tendria lugar, aunque fechada y apadrinada en otros paises. (Vicente Mosquete 7) This postist background, crystallized and reinforced by Nieva's Paris and Venice connections-Ionesco, Adamov, Beckett, Bataille, etc.-is decisive in shaping his dramatic theory, which he labels "una estetica del delito" (Malditas 95). As the phrase denotes, the guiding principle of this dramaturgy is liberty, the rebellious desire for freedom from socio-cultural regulation. According to Nieva, social vigilance (conservatism) creates in us a permanent bond of moral guilt. In order for theater to help us regain our full integrity as human beings-"totalizaci6n del ser"-, it ought to be a subversive instrument-"una religi6n delictiva, prohibida" (Malditas 97)-that undermines all forms of totalizing hierarchies. This is because, after cultural values are divested of their practical and moral coating, what remains of reality is subjectivity and a relativist dialectic of con- stantly shifting relationships: [T]odos los valores, desprovistos de su aplicaci6n practica o moral, culpabilizados, perversos y lesivos, permanecen como un complejo vital positivo-negativo en circulo cerrado y en perpetua situaci6n de afirmaci6n- negaci6n, inversi6n, mudanza, transacci6n. Nada es perfectamente malo ni bueno, a pesar de lo que nos indica esa aguja imantada que es la culpa. (Malditas 102; emphasis added) By espousing moral relativism, Nieva subverts the basis of human culture, whose survival depends on conformity and guilt (the "aguja imantada"). In this way, the playwright situates his dramaturgy in the inner core of the postmodern sensibility, which rebels against monolithic categories that obstruct freedom. In order to create an equilibrium between this ethical relativism and his belief in artistic relativism, Nieva inserts his theater within a historicist paradigm that refuses to force universal appeal: " la obra ha de asentarse en refe- rencias culturales y de conocimiento hist6rico y no ha de pretender ser totalizadora y orgullosamente universalista" (Sombra 14). In highlighting the importance of a dramatic work's specific cultural reference, Nieva decentralizes the canonized unity of artistic expe- rience and ensures possibilities for difference, echoing so remarka-</page><page sequence="7">Postmodern Playwright 435 bly Jean-Francois Lyotard's postmodern model. According to Lyo- tard, A postmodern artist or writer is in the position of a philosopher: the text he writes, the work he produces are not in principle governed by preestablished rules, and they cannot be judged according to a determining judgment, by applying familiar categories to the text or to the work. Those rules and categories are what the work of art itself is looking for. The artist and the writer, then, are working without rules in order to formulate the rules of what will have been done. (81) As a measure against patriarchal value systems, therefore, Nieva advocates a dramatic language that recreates itself-"la palabra se mueve"--and severs its bond with cultural heritage (Malditas 106- 9). Language, in this context, becomes a key instrument of political power; in liberating it from regulation, the playwright counteracts language's quality as an agent of cultural domination.5 Nieva's dramatic theory and practice need to be placed within the theatrical tradition of Spain's most important twentieth-century play- wright, one who symbolizes a break with the naturalistic provincial- ism of Spanish theater: Ram6n Maria del Valle-Incli;n (1866-1936). Although Nieva himself downplays the degree of Valle-Inclhn's influ- ence on him (see Santiago Tranc6n 25), there is no question that significant ethical and aesthetic parallels link the two writers. More important, the reappropriation of Valle-Inclin in the 1960s in a way serves to condition the triumph of postmodernism on the Spanish stage. Valle-Inclhn's novelty, as is well known, lies in his elaboration of the esperpento, a subgenre that employs grotesque distortion as the mechanism of presenting more effectively Spanish life (which he considers to be deformed).6 5 When Nieva was once asked if he considered his "Teatro de Farsa y Calamidad" to be inferior to his "Teatro Furioso," this is what he said: "Hubiera podido ser un retroceso, de no haberse producido ese cnambio moral y mental en la civilizaci6n occidental, que ha dado en Ilamarse postmodernismo, en el que se produce una vuelta a las formas, al teatro de texto, al teatro verbal" (Vicente Mosquete 16). Clearly, not only does Nieva trust the referential power of language and of the literary text, but he considers them as vital tools of postmodern theater. For a detailed analysis of Nieva's use of language, see Barraj6n, La podtica de Francisco Nieva, and Carlos Bousofio 261-88. 6 In a 1989 study, Claudia Schaefer examined Nieva's link with Valle-Inclan and the Spanish painter, Francisco Goya. Five years later, Jesuis Rubio Jimenez revived</page><page sequence="8">436 Komla Aggor HR 68 (2000) The Dramatization of a Postmodernist Strand The fluidity and indeterminacy that underlie Nieva's dramatic theory find expression in diverse aspects of his plays, one of which is temporal setting. The plays often transcend chronological time, dismantling the regular sequence of past-present-future. This idea of atemporality evokes Armand Gatti's "time-possibility" concept, which, as Marvin Carlson says, is opposed to "a fixed and fallacious system of past, present, and future," and instead enables the theater to show "an action from many perspectives and without a sense of closure, encouraging its audience to see the world as open to change" (472-73). For example, in La sefiora Tdrtara (1970), the playwright reports: "Epoca: todo sucede entonces, siempre y antes de siempre" (II, 675); while T6rtolas, crepidsculo y ... tel6n (1952) is set in the 1920s, the playwright describes the decade confusingly as "un pr6ximo pasado" (I, 119); in Pelo de tormenta (1961), the action is situated outside of time: "hace mucho tiempo, poco antes del fin del mundo" (I, 174); and the plot of Coronada y el toro (1973) is set in "tiempo de Espafia en conserva" (I, 419).7 Coronada y el toro's temporal setting incarnates the multivalent characterizations enu- merated above, for it evokes the "Espaia negra," the Spain of rigid norms and superstitious traditions that recall the past and at the same time cut across time. Nieva's dramatic theory does not, however, conform completely with that propounded by the majority of postmodern theorists, such as Linda Hutcheon, who insists that in postmodernism "[t]he past is always placed critically-and not nostalgically-in relation with the present" (A Poetics 45). In order to interrogate the present, Hutcheon argues, we need to explore its vital historical parameters-but not desire them. Nieva sets himself apart from this theorist by adopting a dualistic strategy in which he subverts the past and at the same time longs for it. He undercuts and exploits synchronically a conser- vative social order. He affirms this conflicting attitude in reference to Pelo de tormenta: "Para mi, Espafia era negra y era romaintica, una joya negra, diria mejor.... Todo debia ser en esta obra teatral y interest in the topic by establishing further connections between Valle-Inclain and Nieva.

The "Espafia negra" that Nieva severely questions manifests itself variously, among other things, in the form of sexual repression, opposition to homosexuality, chauvinism, sexism, and blind obedience to religious and political authority. Associated with this traditionalist culture, notwithstanding, is the more attractive magico-spiritual universe inhabited by potent witchcraft and sorcery. Nieva nostalgically in- vokes this supernatural component of his cultural universe because it supplies him with the necessary non-realistic arena where, like Artaud, he is able to imprison actor and spectator in the ceremonial rites of the theatrical experience. The relativist scheme underlying Nieva's time conceptualization runs parallel to his subversive exaltation of multiplicity. In his reso- lute engagement with the Other, he undermines authority and glori- fies the marginalized, what Hutcheon terms the "excentric"- children, the lower classes, women, and homosexuals. In the plays, not only are the marginalized made visible but through their actions, they subvert the order under which they have been condemned. In this sense, the theatrical art becomes a political instrument of pro- test. Indeed, it is the critique of authority, so central in any postmod- ern considerations, that compels Hutcheon to declare that postmod- ernism cannot but be political: "while the postmodern has no effective theory of agency that enables a move into political action, it does work to turn its inevitable ideological grounding into a site of de-naturalizing critique" (The Politics 3). From little Porrerito's recalcitrance in El rayo colgado (1952) to the twelve-year-old Prince Tomis' misdemeanor in La carroza de plomo candente (1971), we witness a world in which children, di- vested of innocence, act like adults in their absurd indifference, while adults, deprived of all compassion, treat children like unpar- donable criminals. From another perspective, one finds a decenter- ing, egalitarian principle that aims to remove the gap between the privileged and the pueblo. The playwright presents aristocrats as hypocrites who publicly resent but privately crave the sexual free- dom enjoyed by ordinary people. In Te quiero, zorra (1987), Hughes Villier, the baron of Gastonneaux, no longer capable of containing the romanticized sexual control under which he has been living, openly accepts the charm of Zoe's bestial sexuality (Zoe developed a foxtail): "Me siento deslumbrado. Este es el verdadero amor. Ahora</page><page sequence="10">438 Komla Aggor HR 68 (2000) descubro que el verdadero amor es divinamente bestial. No puedo esperar. Hagamos ahora mismo el amor" (II, 1250). Since high society does not permit interclass marriage, Zoe must disguise herself as a baroness in order for Villier to marry her. In Pelo de tormenta (1961), la Duquesa, who escapes El Mal- Rodrigo (a popular sexual beast shaped in the form of an erected penis) to seek asylum in the nearby convent, is unable to undergo its ascetic exercises. Betraying her inner desires, she rebels against the convent's ascetic order and escapes to offer her naked body to the beast, in Baroque style: "iMala entrafia, feroz embudo, saborea tu femenino pastel con deleite y orgullo fiero! iYa has ganado la partida galante! Sea yo tu esposa picada, tu manzana partida por el eje, pasee ya por el desconocido y sin igual suplicio" (I, 194). The duchess' sexual language and actions show that although the aristocracy is determined to deny its sexual desire in public, it privately adores El Mal-Rodrigo, just like Ceferina, the Ciego, and the general chorus- the lower class-who openly celebrate him.8 As the Duquesa and Villier learn to transcend class consider- ations in their expression of love and passion, they also shatter artificial class distinctions in a profound way. This exposure of aristocratic hypocrisy carries implicit political undertones, for, as in Brechtian theater of Verfremdung, the exposure is an indirect pro- test intended to instigate social reaction against a conservative in- stitution, in this case personified by duchesses and noblemen. This political underpinning of Nieva's theater most pertinently recalls Richard Bolton's "instrumental postmodernism," which proposes that any systematic critique of knowledge (which leads to a critique of power) is a political act, since it demystifies the authority that representations and institutions have over us (41). Nieva's critique of (patriarchal) power, transmitted adeptly through the dramatic act, distinguishes him from The New Wave Theater, for this group's political project is more directed specifically-albeit often cached in symbols-at Francoism. Nieva's project to exalt the "ex-centric" finds its most forceful expression in the removal of traditional gender gaps. In Nieva's 8 In "Francisco Nieva's Pelo de tormenta and the Politics of Eroticism," I offer a more profound analysis of the way in which Nieva pillories the official codification of sexuality in Pelo de tormenta as a mechanism for celebrating the pueblo.</page><page sequence="11">Postmodern Playwright 439 drama, women take the center stage. They are strong, rebellious, triumphant. Queen Kelly of Nosferatu (1963) effects her power scan- dalously and employs crafty political tactics to keep her people in check without responding to their needs. Kelly flirts with Nosferatu, the vampire, makes him Minister of Interment, and then orders him to suck her blood. She even aids Celestino, the vampire's apprentice, in public to dip his hand into her dress to touch her breast. In El combate de Opalos y Tasia (1953), Dama Vinagre takes charge as Master of a ceremony in which she delightfully weighs in competition the penis of Opalos' and Tasia's pages. Opalos and Tasia, after fighting over Alto Sol, invite the pages to inspect their bodies from under their skirts and to report their findings. In Coronada y el toro (1973), Coronada, "gigantona y soltera," appears at the public arena to interrupt the acclaimed bull-fighting feast just about to be inaugurated by her brother the mayor. With the support of two feminists, La Melga and La Dalga, as well as Hombre- Monja, Coronada defies her brother and adamantly condemns the long-established chauvinistic tradition of bull-fighting. Even before Zebedeo's men arrive to arrest her, she engages in a dream-like act of masturbation, which the playwright describes in the stage direction as "un secreto ceremonial insurgente y gustoso" (I, 440). When Zebedeo finally condemns her to death, she does not panic but affirms her womanhood before descending into her grave: "Soy mats mujer que delincuente y, por lo mismo, Ilevo el coraz6n lleno de novedades, mais que un almacen de capital imperio" (I, 463). Hassan, in "Pluralism in Postmodern Perspective," argues that derision and revision are versions of subversion-terrorism, for example-, but that " 'subversion' may take other, more benevolent, forms such as minority movements or the feminization of culture, which also require decanonization" (505). As Nieva empowers women to control the dramatic action and as he exhibits the uncon- ventional (laissez-faire) conduct of such women as Kelly, Dama Vinagre, Coronada (and many others such as Garrafona, Zemira, Tidrtara, Imperia, La Coconito, Mariagrande), he systematically de- canonizes the Romantic, idealized image of Woman as submissive, virtuous, and weak. Coronada's revolt against the bull-fight is a political act intended ironically to liberate the macho himself. (It must be recalled that in spite of his public show of bravery, Maraufia, the bullfighter, is very shaky and swiftly escapes when Coronada causes confusion in the arena.) Most important, by reducing the bull</page><page sequence="12">440 Komla Aggor HR 68 (2000) to submission without arms, unlike men do, Coronada, in a benevo- lent yet truly heroic style, subverts the ontological fallacies that undergrid enshrined male valor. If Nieva's non-conventional presentation of the woman chal- lenges patriarchal hierarchization of gender, he reinforces his sub- versionist project by collapsing the monolithic structures in sexual orientation and categorization. In his drama, homosexuality and bisexuality are juxtaposed to heterosexuality; androgyny emerges as an accepted alternative to the male-female dichotomy. Even the distinction between human beings and animals is obscured. The inspiration behind Nieva's alternative proposition in this case-to remove discriminatory hierarchies-invokes a fundamental post- modem principle underlined by Lyotard, namely, that postmodem- ism "refines our sensitivity to differences and reinforces our ability to tolerate the incommensurable" (xxv). Consequently, the reader is not surprised to note in La carroza de plomo candente (1971) that Saturno the bull-fighter displays an indiscriminate choice of sexual partners. He engages in a sexual act with a goat (Liliana), expresses lust for a goddess (Venus Calipigia) into whom the goat has been transformed, and, at the same time, becomes attracted to a man (Luis III). In Pelo de tormenta, the convent is inhabited by a long-tailed sacristan, El Raboso, who shows special attraction to the sexual beast, El Mal-Rodrigo. In the same play, Sor Juana de la Coz, the exemplar of asceticism and holiness, indulges in incubating eggs, an act that allegorically announces her repressed sexual sentiments. Villier's passionate love for Zoe in Te quiero, zorra is fuelled by the former's attraction to the latter's tail, which Villier views as a mark of (animal) sincerity (1250). This anthropomorphism is what forms the thematic core of such works as Caperucita y el otro (1968) and No es verdad (1987). The plays are full of characters that have double sexual identity. Bousofio lists some of the numerous appelatives in Coronada y el toro in reference to Hombre-Monja's double sexuality: "Reverendo padre y madre," "Doctora caminante y Magdaleno selvatico," "hombre abadesa de confianza," "madre con barba," "padre materno," "madre cura," "madre del yermo," "madre y muy sefior mio," "padre amadrado," "santa madre barbuda," "padre amantisima," "santo de los pajares y santa de los mitones," "padre monja," "madre mifa de pelo en pecho," "beato entreverado," "madre fraile," "padre femenino," "hijo entrecruzado," etc. (I, 265)</page><page sequence="13">Postmodern Playwright 441 Clearly, Nieva is using verbal dexterity to deregulate the under- current canon in conventional sexual categorization. He parodies the limits of language as a medium of expression by constructing incom- patible equations that upset Spanish grammar: "Reverendo padre y madre" and "padre amantisima" are unacceptable grammatical con- structions that are extremely difficult to translate. In deliberately ignoring Spanish linguistic rules, Nieva also underscores the need for adaptability, flexibility, and creativity: "La palabra se mueve." Even if this non-conformity impels verbal chaos, the resulting air of liberty unmistakably captures the essence of what he wishes to communi- cate. From the platform of linguistic distortion (the marriage of incompatible elements), our playwright dismantles the ideological divisions inherent in traditional sexual categorization (male-female, masculine-feminine, even human-animal). Nieva's linguistic distortion connects with the soul of The New Wave Theater's postmodern culture. But there is an important dif- ference. Whereas our playwright utilizes language to foster dramatic tension and to promote alternative ways of looking at the world, the 1970s Group generally betrays and distrusts language as an effective vehicle of the dramatic experience. For example, Miguel Romero Esteo's La oropindola and, to some extent, El barco de papel, radiate postmodern elements from a linguistic standpoint, but it is a post- modernism that makes mockery of language and employs other theatrical signs (instead of enriched dialogue) to effect the drama. As a transgressive project, Nieva's unconventional propositions, well-immersed in Valle-Inclan's grotesque, symbolist tradition, repre- sent an ethical and artistic rupture, a rupture effected from the very outset of his theatrical adventure, when in the 1950s he wrote a series of mini-plays collectively entitled Cent6n de Teatro.9 Ethically, Nieva's subversive theater is opposed to the Spain of rigid laws and taboos, a society compelled to conformity by war and political dictatorship for thirty six years (a reality he came to experience since he was only twelve years of age). From an artistic angle, Nieva's dissidence depicts a break with a post-war stage saturated 9 In his prologue to Centdn de Teatro, J. Francisco Pefia stresses the importance of these short plays (twelve of them) as establishing the basis for all the major themes and techniques of Nieva's drama that are later fully developed in the longer pieces (5-29).</page><page sequence="14">442 Komla Aggor HR 68 (2000) with reproductions and performances of escapist, well-made plays of bourgeois taste popularized in the earlier part of this century by such playwrights as Jose Echegaray, the Alvarez Quintero brothers (Sera- fin and Joaquin), and Pedro Mufioz Seca. At the same time, the innovations of Valle-Inclan, Ram6n G6mez de la Serna, and Federico Garcia Lorca were totally eclipsed by Adolfo Torrado's melodramas and by a wave of ridiculous (mainly Rightist) ideological theater featured by Sotero Otero del Pozo, Filiberto Diaz Pardo, Jose Gim&amp;- nez Arnau, and others. In this context, the performance in 1976 (five months after Franco had died) of El combate de Opalos y Tasia and La carroza de plomo candente, in a display of nudity and homo- sexuality on Madrid's Figaro stage, gains historical consequence. Nieva, in winning the prestigious Mayte Theater Prize with this 1976 performance, transformed "scandal" into acceptable theatrical prac- tice (perhaps permanently), thus asserting his non-conformist thea- ter as a pioneer in a new, post-Franco era. Contradiction and Paradox One of postmodernism's salient features expressed in the spirited energy of Nieva's drama is paradox. This dimension of the drama, derived directly from our playwright's immersion in postismo, finds studied affinity in Artaud's Theater of Cruelty. In the Theater of Cruelty, theater is likened to the plague whose effect, according to Artaud, possesses both a victorious and a vengeful value. In this French theorist's view, theater is at once an ordeal-like and a puri- ficatory procedure that invites us "to take, in the face of destiny, a superior and heroic attitude" (32). In this connection, Emil George Signes' application of Gloria Orenstein's "Theater of the Marvelous" to Nieva's theatrical praxis makes perfect sense. As Signes shows, one of the cornerstones of this concept, formed by fusing the theo- ries of Andre Breton and Artaud, is the harmonious coexistence of contradictions. This notion of reality, in which contradictory ele- ments are united in some sort of uneasy accord, constitutes the foundation of Hutcheon's postmodernism. Responding to the distinc- tions made by Hassan between modernism and postmodernism, Hutcheon notes: "postmodernism is the process of making the prod- uct; it is absence within presence, it is dispersal that needs centering in order to be dispersed; it is immanence denying yet yearning for</page><page sequence="15">Postmodern Playwright 443 transcendence. In other words, the postmodern partakes of a logic of 'both/and,' not one of 'either/or' " (A Poetics 49). In El maravilloso catarro de Lord Bashaville (1967), the antidote that Lord Bashaville employs to cure his chronic catarrh is paradox- ically intended to perpetuate the illness. He lives in a suffocating heat produced by lamps that burn at unusually high temperatures. At the same time, he commands Sylvester, his servant, to saturate periodi- cally his body with cold water and orders the boy to write him bitter insults to read. He also requests that he hurl eggs at his chest to control the pain. As the eggs are hurled at him, "Bashaville sefrota el contenido subrayando el acto con gestos de sensual sufrimiento" (I, 95). When an upset Sylvester stabs his master because of the latter's accusation that the former is too soft on him, Bashaville orders the boy to stab him again. When he refuses, Bashaville makes him stab himself to death. In Nosferatu (1963), the satanic figure, Nosferatu, the vampire, sucks his victims' blood, not with the purpose of harming them, but with the intention of driving out the devil. It is ostensibly this altruistic mission that leads the Madrigal chorus-the people's rep- resentative voice-to acclaim him as a progressive, Marxist agent that topples tradition for the common good (I, 234). In order to pacify Greta's aggressiveness toward Azul, Nosferatu recommends biting her: "D"jate picar un poco y veris c6mo descansas. Vives disparada" (I, 220). The goddess Aurora confirms the vampire's philosophy-- suffering as fountain of self-liberation--through her growing sensual passion for the dying journalist, El Agonizante. After she commands the journalist to pull out the bloody knife with which he has been stabbed, she smells it "con delectaci6n" (I, 211). The principle behind the actions of these characters is consistent with the Theater of Cruelty, where, as in Aristotelian theater, tragedy serves paradoxically as the enriching instrument of life. Cruelty, then, becomes equated with the Aesthetic of "delito"--the wilful transgression of conventional social order. In Nosferatu, the Gran Marcial's obedience to his honor, the Queen, is transformed into an ambivalent attraction: "Kelly, cehalos a todos, quedate sola conmigo para abandonarme mejor. Hagamos el amor y el odio en el viceversa" (I, 243). It is not surprising, therefore, that the Police Chief endorses this controversial recommendation by Nosferatu:</page><page sequence="16">444 Komla Aggor HR 68 (2000) Pues si en lugar de hacerles [a la policifa] cumplir con su deber, se les manda sencillamente emborrachar, habras hecho una buena labor de transgresi6n en beneficio de la humanidad sincerista. (I, 237) Nosferatu's words are laden with dramatic consequence, for they define Nieva's politics of transgression not as a negative act of subversion, but as a progressive strategy intended to forge alterna- tive possibilities by way of anarchy. Michel Foucault, in his essay, "Preface to Transgression," asserts, Transgression . . is not related to the limit as black to white, the prohibited to the lawful, the outside to the inside, or as the open area of a building to its enclosed spaces. Rather, their relationship takes the form of a spiral which no simple infraction can exhaust.... Transgression contains nothing negative, but affirms limited being- affirms the limitlessness into which it leaps as it opens this zone to existence for the first time. (35) In transgressing morality and social harmony, Nieva reveals the inner perverted world of his characters, and in so doing opens up the universe of cultural oppression to which they have been subjected. A common element ties the strange behavior of such characters as Greta, Celestino, El Gran Marcial, Kelly, Aurora, Lord Bashaville, and Nosferatu: their masochistic attitude to adversity creates paradoxi- cal premises that project onto the spectator's imagination uncertain- ties about ethical codes and order: "Nada es perfectamente malo ni bueno, a pesar de lo que nos indica esa aguja imantada que es la culpa."l0 In his inquiry into the individual's autonomy in the context of social domination, the renowned British sociologist, Zygmunt Bau- man, writes in Postmodern Ethics, For every social totality bent on uniformity and the soliciting of the disciplined, co-ordinated action, the stubborn and resilient autonomy of the moral self is a scandal. From the control desk of society, it is viewed as the germ of chaos and anarchy inside order; as the outer limit of what reason (or its self-appointed spokesmen and agents) can do to design and implement whatever has been proclaimed as the "perfect" arrangement of human cohabitation. (13) 10 For a complete study of paradox in Nosferatu, see my article, "Evil and Cure: Francisco Nieva's Nosferatu and the Theater of Cruelty."</page><page sequence="17">Postmodern Playwright 445 "From the control desk of society," Nieva's recreated, irrational order of transgression may be viewed as anarchy, but from the inner world of his drama, it serves to rescue the self from the scandal of cultural control, which the playwright considers the true evil. The cathartic formula that underlies the various examples of self- affliction advanced above injects the plays with postmodern aura, because the contradictions, if anything, place the drama beyond the confines of fixity by fostering some sort of dialectical resilience. The contradictions of Nieva's drama are not limited to character- ization but are also transmitted through the aesthetic composition of the piece. Between plays and within them, there is a sustained artistic pendulum that swings between the polarities of tradition and innovation. No single piece follows perfectly the aesthetic rubrics of any one category. Brian McHale, in a review article, "Writing about Postmodern Writing," notes that, "despite everything that has been written by apologists both for and against postmodernism about its abandonment of mimesis, the mimetic commitment apparently still persists, albeit transformed." He then asks, "is it even possible to write fiction that has no mimetic commitment whatsoever? or to write about fiction in such a way that no mimetic commitment emerges?" (226). As Hal Foster suggests, postmodernism should be best perceived as "a conflict of new and old modes" (xi), whether cultural, economic, or artistic. Nieva's version of postmodernism-- Spanish postmodernism, as a matter of fact-, derives its strength precisely from the insertion of new (surrealist) artistic values in juxtaposition to traditional (representational) forms. It involves an intricate interplay of mimeticism and theatricality, not a replace- ment. A case in point is El baile de los ardientes o poderoso cabriconde (1975), a play classified by Nieva under "Teatro de Farsa y Calami- dad." This piece is perfectly constructed along the lines of traditional (Aristotelian) plot development. Even though it is not divided into acts and scenes, the stage directions clearly mark the end of each scene. The plot is even separated into two parts, each of which contains subheadings that show different phases of the plot. The play is written clearly and free of Nieva's usual metaphoric language, hence, unlike plays such as Nosferatu or Los esparioles bajo tierra (1975), one follows the plot with little effort. The logical representation of the play, however, contradicts the mythical discord witnessed in characterization, action, and stage-</page><page sequence="18">446 Komla Aggor HR 68 (2000) craft. When the young poet Cambicio begins his adventure to Naples to marry one of the daughters of the noble Orla family, everything seems transparent and real. But as the plot unfolds, not only does the atmosphere become grotesque but increasingly oneiric and theatri- cal. Cambicio is greeted by death-tolling bells; when he urinates in front of Imperia Gavrotti, she embraces the behavior as courteous. Astounded by the hallucinatory ambience, Cambicio faints twice, and instead of a beautiful fianc6e, the Cabriconde himself appears as his betrothed. Cambicio's satanic audacity before the horrors, driven only by the desire to surpass his limits into the mysterious-"heroica curiosidad" (II, 776)-, recalls the rebellious passion of such Roman- tic protagonists as Jos6 de Espronceda's Pirata or Don F6lix de Montemar. This Romantic ambition is further enhanced by an atmo- sphere invaded by typical Romantic (and surrealist) imagery: thun- der and lightning, torrential rainfall, the gloomy image of a family cemetery in the middle of the hall, the display of a coffin, court ladies clothed in mourning gestures, a hellish, impounding darkness in which crazy flames dance to illuminate the human figures there present, etc."1 What pertains to Nieva's drama is a striking combina- tion of representation (born out of his allegiance to the genero chico tradition) and theatricality (his neo-avant-gardism), but the poetic atmosphere overshadows the rational arrangement, almost as if to transcend and parody it. Herein lies the distinguishing factor be- tween Nieva and the playwrights of the "Generation of 1982" (Jose Luis Alonso de Santos, Jose Sanchis Sinisterra, Fermin Cabal, and others): whereas the postmodernism of the younger writers is de- rived from a realism connected with daily life and social experience, Nieva's art is, first and foremost, operated within a conceived world, according to its own rules, with a gaze that shocks, teases and belies socio-cultural reality. A Celebration of Open Theater For postmodern theater to uphold the standard of artistic elas- ticity (as Nieva demonstrates), it must sustain the tensions embed- "1 One cannot fully appreciate postmodern literature without taking into account its vital connection with Romanticism. For an account of that connection, see Gerald Graff's "The Myth of the Postmodernist Breakthrough."</page><page sequence="19">Postmodern Playwright 447 ded in the dialectical framework in which the dramatic experience is effected. This need is engendered even more so by the problematics of what actually constitutes postmodern theater. This so complex question needs to be addressed in light of the concerns raised earlier in the present essay: the fact that postmodernism as a current lacks a binding definition, that it is not an aesthetic, and, above all, that theater has no stable identity. What these premises imply is that in order to link postmodernism with theater in any meaningful manner, one must do so only on the basis of specific authors or group of authors who proceed from similar theatrical traditions. At least, in the case of Nieva, who condemns the restrictive tendency to make of postmodernism another kind of theory-one on collage-, the pre- mises also suggest that postmodern theater does not necessarily involve peculiarly theatrical or dramatic features that conform to some aesthetic guidelines on postmodernism. Rather, it essentially entails an artistic and ideological dynamism that reflects the philo- sophical tenor of what is generally considered to represent the postmodern. As a liberating vehicle, therefore, postmodern theater must nec- essarily be an open theater, which leaves the underlying conflicts of the drama unresolved. Invoking Foucault, Hutcheon contends that irreconcilable incompatibilities are the very bases upon which the problematized discourses of postmodernism emerge. "While unre- solved paradoxes may be unsatisfying to those in need of absolute and final answers," Hutcheon insists, "to postmodern thinkers and artists they have been the source of intellectual energy that has provoked new articulations of the postmodern condition" (A Poetics 21). Nieva's theater, ever resilient and non-totalitarian, offers little resolution to the problems it generates through plot. In the plays, nothing stays irrevocable, and as the final curtain drops, the specta- tor, disillusioned, often struggles to decipher the spectacle's raison d'8tre. Even death's conclusive quality is challenged; insurgent char- acters who die arise from the dead, perpetuating their resistance, as if to force upon the audience the drama's troubling repercussions beyond the theater hall. For example, Tomis' resurrection in La carroza de plomo candente (1971) produces no clear emotional balance at the end of the play; instead, it serves to heighten the disorientation that characters and spectators alike have experienced since the opening of the piece. Action-packed as it is, El rayo colgado (1952) ends meaninglessly, with</page><page sequence="20">448 Komla Aggor HR 68 (2000) the characters awaiting answers to be delivered by one Don Gurrmin who died several years past. As if waiting for a Godot that might never appear, Sisters Prega and Isena hope against hope, since no one knows when the turning roulette wheel will ever stop to enable the answer to be delivered. It is not even clear what sort of answer is expected, nor does one know why there is a need for one. In Elfandango asombroso (1961), time serves only to wait, and the characters, although sub- merged in thefandango (a Spanish regional dance), continue anxiously to await its beginning. The play within Tdrtolas, crepuisculo y teldn (1952) has no end, because the final curtain would not descend to close the performance. Luckily, fate intervenes when Senedian accidentally shoots the curtain down as he misses Trapezzia whom he is ordered to kill for laughing mindlessly. Nieva's commitment to open theater perhaps expresses itself most compellingly in his creation of the redpera as a dramatic genre. He describes the re6pera as a short script with a compressed plot totally open to the director's interpretation. The playwright high- lights as the redpera's central concerns flexibility, improvisation, and accomodation in rendition: Teatro abierto, para introducir formas y reformas de caracter visual: bailes, desfiles, escenograffa cambiante y efectista. Se trata, pues, de un cafiamazo inductor, un gui6n conciso sobre el que pueden engarfiarse otras intenciones y conceptos. El texto puede ser musicado, convertido en canci6n o melopea, e igualmente desarrollado en improvisaciones o en afiadidos marginales. (Teatro completo I, 173) In a sense, therefore, the redpera expresses Nieva's desire to move the theater away from "performance" (the representation of the playwright's intent) toward "interpretation," thus transforming the director into what Amestoy calls "el autor de la posmodernidad" ("Literatura dramdtica" 5). The two redperas, Pelo de tormenta and Nosferatu, offer no plot resolution. After the long battle against El Mal-Rodrigo, the sexual beast is nowhere to be found in the end, and the audience, along with the characters, wonders about the rationale behind the hostile cam- paign mounted against him by the political and religious authorities. Nosferatu's assassination in Nosferatu by Mickey Mouse's men as a restorative act (to remove the devil) is neutralized by the vampire's resurrection from the dead to reaffirm his power over Queen Kelly, whom he takes away. Indeed, the audience may feel mocked as it</page><page sequence="21">Postmodern Playwright 449 becomes disoriented toward the ending of Nieva's drama, but what is important is that the disorientation empowers the audience to inter- pret the drama as it pleases. Like the director, the spectators are enabled to supply what Umberto Eco calls "a free, inventive re- sponse" (4), so fundamental in making the postmodern work com- plete. Clearly, Nieva's theater could alienate the conservative spec- tator who is unable to share any kind of emotional solidarity with the spectacle (as has indeed occurred in some of his performances). But his theater invites all to participate in it, see the world differently- and wonder. Nieva's self-identification as a postmodernist in a way facilitates our exploration of his drama from a postmodern perspective. In order to establish him as a postmodern playwright, however, we cannot focus on isolated aspects of his theater, which in themselves parallel other artis- tic currents. Instead, we must consider the totality of his artistic uni- verse, taking into full account the multivalent aspects that altogether define it: a postist ideological formation, the heterogeneity of aesthetic sources, a relativist dramatic theory opposed to universalism, an open, non-unilineal concept of time, the critique of authority and glorification of the marginalized, the dramatization of contradiction and paradox, the interplay of representation and theatricality, and the celebration of open theater. When all of these features are collectively contemplated, one discerns an encompassing principle that consolidates Nieva's notion of the postmodern: human and artistic liberty-the freedom to be, to write, and to interpret according to one's will; a far cry from the consensus agenda so tirelessly promoted by the modernist thinker Jiirgen Habermas. On the basis of these affirmations, we cannot but reject any assertions that create a dichotomy between avant-gardism and post- modernism. Nieva has bridged such a gap effectively by championing an ethical and aesthetic pluralism that thrives on renovation rather than on alienation of its target of attack. As it is, we must also begin to reconsider the established historical limits of postmodern Spanish theater, which Amestoy has pegged back at the early 1980s, a period that has also become the exclusive focus of Floeck's studies on the topic. I submit that it was Nieva who in the 1950s and 1960s, when he wrote such plays as El rayo colgado, El combate de Opalos y Tasia, and Pelo de tormenta, ushered onto the Spanish stage the post- modern wave for which Valle-Inclhin's innovations paved the way earlier in this century. No debate on the subject would be complete</page><page sequence="22">450 Komla Aggor HR 68 (2000) without utmost consideration of his work.
