<plain_text><page sequence="1">A PERFECTION THEORY OF THE GOOD DONALD WALHOUT IN this paper I wish to set forth as plainly and simply as possible a theory of the good which finds little modern vogue, but which nevertheless seems to me more plausible than any of those now current. The perfection theory of the good can claim weighty his- torical roots, especially in Plato and Aristotle; but I shall proceed systematically rather than historically. The exposition of the theory will be presented in three parts: first, a statement of a generic defini- tion of perfection; second, an attempt to give more specific content to the definition; and third, an indication of my reasons for upholding the truth of the theory I am using the word "good" as a non-committal term at first, simply to mark off the subject-matter under discussion. Precisely because of its many meanings, the word can be used in this way, for it is not likely to convey anything too specific. Nevertheless, "good" has so many human connotations that I need to make one assump- tion explicit at the outset. This assumption is that it is meaningful to say that "good," both in the instrumental and in the intrinsic sense, might refer to non-human and perhaps even to non-conscious beings as well as to human beings. I shall not here argue that such a doctrine of the universal extent of good is a true doctrine, but will only assume that it is a doctrine worth considering. I do not wish the term "good," therefore, initially to preclude this possibility. I shall repeat this point at the end within the context then available. The Definition of Perfection It will seem at first that to define the good as perfection is simply to replace one vague term by another and to raise the same question of meaning with different words. Consequently, we must proceed directly to an understanding of the nature of perfection, which will justify us in using "{perfection" as more than an empty synonym for "good" and as actually designating instead a meaningful and possibly true theory of the good. We can then say that the good is something discovered by experience and that the perfection theory seems to be the most adequate conception of what that good essentially is. There is a fruitful suggestion for our definition in a discussion of perfection by Charles Hartshorne. Interestingly enough, the sugges- tion comes from a meaning of perfection which Hartshorne himself considers unimportant and therefore confines to an appendix.' I Man's Vision of God, Appendix to Chapter I. 20</page><page sequence="2">A PERFECTION THEORY OF THE GOOD Hartshorne begins by defining perfection in its broadest sense as unsurpassability. This definition seems clear and simple enough: a thing is perfect if it cannot be surpassed in whatever characteristics or attainments are peculiar to it. Hartshorne then distinguishes two kinds of perfection-absolute and relative.' A being is said to be absolutely perfect if it cannot be surpassed in any respect by any being whatsoever, even by itself. On the other hand, a being is said to be relatively perfect if it cannot be surpassed in any respect by any other being besides itself, but may surpass itself in some respect. This distinction is employed by Hartshorne to differentiate the God of Scholastic theism from the God of many modern forms of theism. In the discussion of this theological issue, he deliberately leaves out of account two other logical possibilities concerning surpassability and unsurpassability which he recognizes. These other two possibilities are, first, the possibility that a being cannot be surpassed by itself but might be surpassed by other beings, and, second, the possibility that a being is surpassable both by others and by itself. A logically exhaustive classification of possibilities is stated by Hartshorne as follows:- The four modes of surpassability are: surpassability (i) by both self and others, B; (2) by self only (unsurpassability "relative" to others), R; (3) by others only, 0; (4) by neither self nor others ("absolute" unsurpassability), A.z Mr. Hartshorne rightly confines himself in his particular inquiry to modes (2) and (4), R and A, as being the only possibilities relevant to the idea of God; for no one would describe God as surpassable by other beings. I think we may also say that these possibilities are relevant exclusively to God, or whatever is taken as supreme. They would in any case have no wide application, since most beings seem to be surpassable by others, quite apart from reference to deity. Again, mode (i), B, is really a definition of imperfection and hence not useful for our purpose either. But in mode (3), 0, we find pre- cisely the meaning which will give us the most universally applic- able and therefore the most satisfactory generic definition of per- fection. According to this conception, anything is perfect when it has fulfilled the limits of its capacities, although it might be sur- passed by some other being. This definition describes the perfection of any being except the highest or supreme. The elaboration which the definition requires must be given briefly. We may begin with the unobj ectionable statement that everything which exists is distinguished by certain characteristics, powers, and potentialities. To be a being at all is to be characterized I Man's Vision of God, p. 7. 2 Ibid., p. 55, 2I</page><page sequence="3">PHILOSOPHY by distinguishing traits and tendencies. Furthermore, it seems equally reasonable to suppose that such potentialities and traits have, for any given being, finite limits. What these limits are may be impossible to determine in a given case; but that there are definite bounds would appear to be ingredient in the very meaning of being an individual entity. The conclusion in this sequence of thought is then the inference that the perfection of anything means the attain- ment in actual fact of the possibilities latent in that creature. When a being has reached the supreme limit of its potentiality; when, in other words, it is unsurpassable by itself any further (although, of course, it might still be surpassed by some other being), then it has achieved its perfection. The agency by which this perfection is reached need not detain us. The agency might come from within the being itself, or it might come from the outside; or both types might be involved. Nor need we be detained by the fact that many beings seem to have no potentiality for development: momentary or enduring, they are what they are, once for all, without increasing toward perfection. The main point is that all beings, including these, have the common characteristic that however and whenever they reach their self-unsurpassable limit, that is their perfection. Such, then, is the meaning of perfection-the unsurpassability of a being relative to itself. My contention is that this is what is essen- tially meant by the notion of intrinsic good. Perfection in Existence The definition of perfection just given is straightforward enough but general. We must therefore attempt to capture something of the specific content of perfection, something of what it involves in the actual world of existing individuals. Incidentally, I think it is evident that a perfection theory of this sort presupposes a world of real individuals. It does not seem to be compatible with a doctrine which denies the ultimacy of individuals and resolves them into the universal. Furthermore, it appears equally evident to me that our world is the type presupposed. This is a strenuous metaphysical question which would have to be argued at more length in another connection, but which cannot be so pursued here. We will confine ourselves to the claim that the denial of the ultimacy of individuals can never overcome the existential absurdity which such a denial makes out of our every-day experience in the world of things and out of our experience of ourselves as persons. With this presupposi- tion, then, the endeavour to grasp something of the individual context of perfection becomes meaningful. Let us make this endea- vour by noting three significant contrasts and emphasizing the third. These contrasts are those of the actual and the ideal, individ- uality and form, and structure and function. They are relevant to 22</page><page sequence="4">A PERFECTION THEORY OF THE GOOD every instance of perfection (except the highest, as always understood here). We may approach the first contrast by taking notice first of all of a principle of existence which Spinoza has enunciated in a way that has become classic. Every entity, according to him, tends toward the preservation of its own being. If we add to this principle a normative connotation, we may say that every being tends toward its essential being, toward what it can ideally become. In living creatures this tendency takes the form of an active striving, a striving to actualize or attain those characteristics and potentialities which will make the creature more fully itself, or rather, more fully what it can become. It may be thought anthropomorphic to impute a similar striving to inanimate things; so I hasten to add that the tendency in question need not be thought of as homogeneous in the same sense throughout nature: in some areas it might mean no more than the persistency of identity. On the other hand, it can be plausibly maintained that there is no sufficient warrant for supposing that there is a real break in nature between the living and the non-living, between entities which have some sort of internal directional activity and entities which do not. For our purpose, this possible difference may be waived; for our theory of the good does not rest upon the solution of that issue: it will be the same on either alternative. Now the mention of a tendency to exemplify, or a striving to realize, inherent possibilities immediately reminds us of the extreme disparity, which is so frequent, between the present state of an entity and its possibility for becoming. This disparity is most obvious in ourselves, since our own failings, which detract from the fulfil- ment of ourselves and of others, are in most cases only too painfully vivid to us. But it is also true that the creatures of nature are often less than they might be; and the same may be said of artificial creations. The actual is but a faint imitation of the ideal. Now it is this very disparity between the actual and the ideal, between the present stalemate and the beckoning possibility, that yields perhaps the most illuminating impression of what the doctrine of the good as perfection refers to in the world of existence. Here am I; yonder is my real self. This is one way, then, of clarifying our definition of perfection, viz. by focussing upon the contrast between the actual and the ideal. For a being to overcome this disparity, to achieve the ideal, to realize the utmost promise inherent within it: these are so many ways of describing what constitutes the highest perfection or excel- lence within that limited realm of possibility. The ideal is reached at the point of unsurpassability in attainment, the limit beyond which the creature cannot go, although it might be surpassed in any given respect by some other being with greater potentiality. This ideal 23</page><page sequence="5">P H I L O S O P H Y attainment is the intrinsic good of the being in question, and what- ever conduces to it is instrumentally good for it. Another contrast which is fundamental is that between individ- uality and form. Every being has features of potentiality and goal which it shares with other creatures of its kind. This is its generic essence or form. But it also has such features which are unique to itself: otherwise there would be no real individuals. These unique features give it its particular existence or individuality. The Greek doctrine of perfection referred only to the form; individuality was ignored. The Scholastic doctrine included an emphasis upon the individuality of personal selves but not of other beings. But if individuals are in any sense ultimate, it seems to me that it would be metaphysically more consistent to maintain that a perfection of individuality, as well as of form, is universally possible. If we are to take individuality seriously at all, there must be a perfection of individually unique qualities as well as of formal characteristics. An ontological corollary would be the belief in individual essences besides generic ones, as in Plotinus. Thus a being might (or might not) be perfect in its generic essence, and it might (or might not) be perfect in its individual characters. The third of our clarificatory contrasts may be regarded as giving a more specific definition of the concept of perfection. This contrast is that of structure and function, i.e. what a being is and what it does. I think we may say that the intrinsic nature of anything can be exhaustively comprehended under these two aspects-the aspect of composition, organization, or structure, on the one hand, and the aspect of purpose, directional activity, or function, on the other. And if the nature of a being is comprised in these two aspects, then the perfection of that being will consist in the perfection of these. This is why they yield a more specific definition of perfection. Before considering the criteria by which the perfection of structure and of function are to be judged, however, two parenthetical remarks need to be inserted. One remark is in response to the objection that the function of inanimate things, especially artificial creations, is definable only by reference to human purposes, i.e. that their function is not intrinsic. I think it is appropriate to say that, even if it is true that there are some entities with no function natural to them, no internal direc- tional activity (a proposition which, however, as already pointed out, is by no means self-evident to all, e.g. Whitehead in his philosophy of organism), the function of such an entity, even though derivative from some purposer or willer, is still an intrinsic part of what it means to be that entity. We can still speak of the defining function peculiar to that entity. The other remark is that the factors of individuality and form, 24</page><page sequence="6">A PERFECTION THEORY OF THE GOOD previously mentioned, apply to both structure and function. A being has a formal and an individualized character in its structure or com- position, and it may have a generic and an existentially unique side in its function or purpose. Now concerning the criteria for judging the perfection of structure and function, let us consider structure first. Three criteria seem to be most prominent in our judgments on this head. I shall call these purity, harmony, and richness.' In the first place, a structurally perfect entity will have parts which are well developed and free from defect. Secondly, the parts will be effectively interrelated; the composition, organization, or arrangement of parts will be harmoni- ously integrated. Finally, it will have as rich a variety of content, as wide a scope, as its nature permits. These three criteria may not be equally significant in every case; but together they do appear to constitute the substance of our notion of structural perfection. In describing the perfection of structure in this way, we may be led to think primarily of inanimate objects, such as landscapes or jewels. This is partly a fault of language. Our language, especially words like "structure" and "parts," is simply not adapted to convey the vitality and dynamic character of living organisms and human beings. Nevertheless, I think the criteria mentioned are useful categories for characterization in these latter realms as well. I believe it is instructive to describe the structural perfection of plants and animals as consisting in these three factors-effective development of parts, harmonious interaction of parts, and breadth of resources. And certainly the ideal of human selfhood includes (i) the unde- teriorated manifestation of those faculties and qualities which are distinctive of man and of the individual person, (2) the unity and integration of personality, and (3) variety and depth of experience. All of these examples are different instances of what we have for brevity called purity, harmony, and richness of composition. On the functional side, the two criteria which appear most central are proficiency and economy. The first thing we want to know about the performance of anything is whether or not it is successful, whether or not the purpose has been fully accomplished. Has the function or aim actually been achieved? But we also judge perfection here by the extent to which the result has been achieved economically, with a minimum of deterioration or dissipation of the being in ques- tion. A person may achieve proficiency in functioning, but at great cost to the personality. Hence the dual criterion is relevant. The criteria of functional perfection also find ready illustration in the inanimate, the living, and the human realms. The determination of what the function of a given being is may be impossible or at best disputable; and it generally involves a non-empirical value judgment. 1 Cf. Paul Weiss, Man's Freedom, p. I97 f., for a similar discussion. 25</page><page sequence="7">P H I L O S O P H Y But this would be a question of specialized application and does not affect the suggested criteria for evaluating functional perfection in general. In summary, we may say that the perfection of an individual being, meaning the unsurpassability of that being relative to itself, comprises purity, harmony, and richness of structural composition, and proficiency and economy of functional achievement. With this brief discussion we conclude our endeavour to make the perfection theory of good more specific. There remains the problem of valida- tion. The Rationale of the Theory In lieu of a proof for the theory of good just explained, whatever that might involve in a philosophical context, I would like simply to identify some of the dialectical considerations which lead me to believe that the perfection theory illuminates our understanding of the good more adequately than do alternative theories. I shall confine myself here to the human good, even though my previous descrip- tions have been arranged to include non-human good as well, should that be regarded as a plausible line of inquiry. In the human realm we shall be referring, of course, to the perfec- tion of the self, or more simply, to self-fulfilment, as the intrinsic good. It will first be necessary to turn aside some misunderstandings which often occur at this point. To begin with, self-fulfilment as the good does not mean that any and every expression of the self is justified, that every outrageous and pernicious action now becomes good. Self-fulfilment refers to the attainment of the essential self, the putting on of the new man. Without this distinction between the essential self and the present self, I do not think we can make sense out of the experience of the actual and the ideal alluded to earlier, nor, indeed, out of the import of responsibility. Another misunder- standing is that self-fulfilment, being the intrinsic good of an indi- vidual, must be thought of as good from every viewpoint, so that a person now has the right to drive to his own self-realization no matter what. Ideally this may be so, because ideally one's perfection is not attainable apart from all others. But in our world it is not so. What may seem to be the intrinsic good of one person may have to be curtailed for a higher end, either voluntarily or forcefully. Moral choices are often choices between different intrinsic goods. But in this respect the perfection theory is no different from other theories. Every theory must face the issue of moral choices between different intrinsic goods not all attainable. Turning to more positive considerations, I submit, in the first place, that alternative theories of the good tend to be too limited in their scope. I think we may fairly classify the many theories of 26</page><page sequence="8">A PERFECTION THEORY OF THE GOOD human good according to whether they claim the good to consist in some form of right knowing, right willing, right enjoyment, or self- fulfilment. The alternatives to the perfection theory tend to magnify one of these functions of the self and to discount other important functions or at least to subordinate their distinctiveness. The dis- tinctive values of intellect and moral will can hardly be reduced to enjoyment: hedonism has been refuted a thousand times. Likewise, the other possible subsumptions are awkwardly managed. All of these goods, however, so far as they are good, are comprehended in the meaning of self-fulfilment. They are various aspects in the good of perfection. The view of certain latter-day utilitarians, who hold that there are a number of intrinsic goods besides happiness, such as knowledge, virtue, beauty, etc., a synthesis of which constitutes the highest good, seems to me merely a splintered, more abstract, and inadequate version of the doctrine of good as self-fulfilment. In the second place, I think that philosophical speculation about the good of the individual should learn more from those human activities which are directly concerned, in an existential way, with securing the good of the individual. Most prominent among these activities are those relating to psychology and religion, which are both concerned with the "cure of the soul." It seems to me that self- fulfilment is increasingly being recognized in these fields as the standard for judging the good of the individual. They may differ widely as to the exact nature of this ideal self and as to the types of relationship through which the ideal is reached; but they tend to agree that the discovery and perfection of those potentialities which are most basic to the self comprise the intrinsic human good. Eric Fromm, for instance, basing his views upon his clinical work, makes this goal his primary emphasis.' Similarly, I think it is safe to say that responsible workers in religion find concepts like "'self-discovery, " "being one's true self," and the like, more meaningful than concepts like "balance of pleasures" or "synthesis of goods." Such practical relevance lends weighty evidence to the self-fulfilment theory of good. As a third consideration, I would suggest that the perfection theory is best able to reconcile the absolute and the relative charac- teristics which are generally recognized to qualify the good. All theories which hold that judgments of good can be true as well as emotive maintain, on the one hand, that there is an ultimate nature of the good which is relevant to everyone and to which everyone's judgments must conform in order to be true. On the other hand, they recognize the good to be exemplified only in individuals, to be peculiarly one's own, to be relative to a particular person. There is at once a common meaning and an indefinite variety in the good It I Cf. Man for Himself. 27</page><page sequence="9">PHILOSOPHY seems to me that the self-fulfilment theory is ready-made to express this double character of the good-absoluteness and relativity- whereas other theories are too prone to ignore one pole. Hedonism, for instance, finds great difficulty in allowing variety of pleasure. The theory of right willing tends to suggest universal commands and to minimize the individual character of obligation. The good regarded as a synthesis of various intrinsic goods tends to lose sight of the particular individual altogether. The perfection theory, on the contrary, maintains unambiguously that there is a meaning and standard of good applicable to everyone, but that the content of the good in concrete existence varies with every individual according to his unique capacities, so that while there may be many common aspects in the good, it may also be radically diverse. Finally, I would like to recur to the assumption made in the introduction. This assumption was that it is meaningful to regard the doctrine of the universal extent of good, i.e. the coextensiveness of goodness and being, as a possible view. I believe that the perfec- tion theory of good just sketched has the advantage of allowing this doctrine to be meaningful, whereas most other theories do not. Of course this advantage does not prove the perfection theory true; but it is a fruitful adjunct. And perhaps the two doctrines are reciprocal, mutually supporting each other. In any case, most theories choke off the discussion of this question before it can meaningfully begin, by too narrow a conception of the good. If the very subject-matter of the good is human consciousness, then there is an end to the matter. I think there are only two theories of the good which allow the universal extent of good to be meaningful. These are the theory that good consists in some sort of feeling in a very broad sense, and the perfection theory. The feeling theory, in order to uphold the doctrine in question, requires, of course, the additional theory that feeling or internal response is present throughout all of nature and existence. The perfection theory does not require this panpsychist belief, although it is compatible with it. The perfection theory is likely to maintain, however, that the good in its universal extent does not exist apart from any consciousness whatsoever, albeit not human consciousness. But even this point is not necessarily held by all. But these are other matters. My only point here is that it seems to me important to keep the question open. If everyone should some day agree that it is meaningless to talk about the good apart from human consciousness, so be it. But I think it is a significant advan-- tage of a theory if it is fruitful for further inquiry. Rockford College, Illinois. 28</page></plain_text>
