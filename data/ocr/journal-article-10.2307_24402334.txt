Heimpel RÉSUMÉ Dans cet essai, l'auteur propose une lecture intertextuelle de deux films: Psycho d'Alfred Hitchcock et The Grifters de Stephen Frears. Étant donné que le terme d'intertextualité n'est certainement pas innocent, et compte tenu de la tendance À confondre les notions d'intertexte et d'influence, il est donc nécessaire dans un premier temps d'élaborer et de penser les questions théoriques les plus larges qui caractérisent toute tentative de lecture intertextuelle. Ensuite, à la lumière des théories de Michael Riffaterre, Gérard Genette, Roland Barthes et d'autres, l'auteur soutient que Psycho, à titre d'intertexte complémentaire de The Grifters, se trouve "re travaillé" À travers les scènes ayant trait au "motel" et, AILLEURS, À TRAVERS les investissements sémantiques variables du verbe "payer." I. INTERTEXTUALITY VS. SOURCE-INFLUENCE In this essay, I will propose a certain view of intertextual identity, which will be used to identify and articulate the relationships between two films: Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho (USA 1960) and Stephen Frear's The Grifters (USA 1990). As my title indicates, I envisage Hitchcock's film as somehow imbedded in Frear's film. In other words, implicitly and now explicitly, I am arguing that The Grifters does not only bear the mark of Psycho, as source-influence studies would contend, but rather that the classic thriller is recalled and reworked. But this does not mean that source-influence and intertextuality necessarily constitute opposed, independent operations. It is my aim in the first part of this essay to avoid any costly confusion by clarifying and accentuating what Canadian Journal of Film Studies/Revue canadienne d'études cinématographiques Vol 3 N° 1</page><page sequence="2">46 Rod S. Heimpel I see as the distinct, but sometimes complementary operations of source-influence and "modern" theories of intertextuality. Theories of intertextuality and source-influence studies both admit that all texts derive their meaning (and their ability to mean) from other texts. A text's intertextual identity depends on both its source-influences and also on those texts which it carefully incorporates and transforms: intertexts. Yet the call of intertextual identity originates from opposing apparatus, even opposing objectives: the readerly and the writerly. Source-influence studies prefer a text-oriented or writerly approach whereas theories of intertextuality, for the most part, take greater account of the reader's role in producing the meaning of the text. However, theories of intertextuality go further by suggesting that intertexts may or may not be known or even knowable.1 For example, it is unlikely that Western readers will intuitively recognize the traditional Indian oral texts which figure in Rushdie's Satanic Verses.2 What becomes clear, then, is that although re-calling other texts is standard textual equipment, it is also the product of individual compet encies, practices, and expectations. Does this mean that The Satanic Verses is unreadable for anyone not well versed in Indian oral culture? Hardly, it simply means that all readings are not composed of the same intertextual options. However, what if "shades" of a similar reading suddenly metamorphosed into starkly contrasting "colours"? Michael Riffaterre argues that certain texts invoke obligatory intertextuality when only linguistic competence is needed to perceive the text's "presuppositions," which in turn force the reader to choose among "shades" as opposed to "colours."3 For Riffaterre, failure to integrate an "obligatory intertext" creates semiotic havoc because "ungrammaticalities" (i.e. incongruities, "rough edges") in the text will eventually inflict the sense of incompleteness on the reader.4 However, such a prescriptive approach to intertextuality tends to presuppose the reader's demand for "grammatically", linearity, and a certain "cybernetics of text", all of which, of course, epitomize a structuralist poetics; what is obligatory, then, is Riffaterre's structuralism and the particular reading it produces in the context of his (excellent) competence as a reader and his choice of texts. Surely notions of completeness and coherence vary from reader to reader, just as notions of rigour, clarity, and purpose tend to vary among literary critics. Moreover, unlike source-influence relationships, intertextual relationships are not necessarily chronological or linear. Accordingly, a reading of The Grifters as an intertext of Psycho is possible whereas The Grifters as a source-influence of Psycho is, of course, tautological. It is not only tautological because of the chronological impossibility</page><page sequence="3">Hitchcock's Psycho.. 47 involved, but also because source-influence studies must inevitably admit to the intention of the sender (writer, filmmaker, etc.) This so called intention to acknowledge the influence of prior texts is both an honorific allusion and at the same time, something much larger. Reading and writing, Robert Scholes argues, is essentially a generic process so that as soon as the reader recognizes the genre to which a work belongs, he is able to get on with the task of reading it.5 This is an idea, Scholes indicates, which E.D. Hirsch defends convincingly in Validity in Interpretation.6 Source-influence, then, witnesses the writing of new texts into a (certain) genre(s) so that they may be read on and in the terms of that genre. Intertextuality, in my view, is a variation on genre which turns to specific texts and even obscure texts, whereas genre-study often neglects "difficult" texts in the name of consensus and the grand (and conveni ent) totalizations of taxonomy: "A frequent tendency among critics consists of establishing false norms to facilitate the appreciation of literary works."7 Similarly, the research undertaken by Julia Kristeva8, Gérard Genette®, Roland Barthes, Michael Riffaterre, and others on the subject of intertextuality all develop a strong concept of textuality from which an operative theory of inter textuality is derived. It is important to bear in mind that notions of textuality imply notions of reading which literary critics, depending on their approach, may or may not make clear to their readers. For example, Riffaterre's obligatory intertextuality makes certain assumptions about the readers' need for and notions of completeness and coherence. Roland Barthes, on the contrary, envisages text as a labyrinth of "citations sans guillemets"10 which, accordingly, he leaves to the reader's ingenuity and needs. Riffaterre's implicit act of reading seems to follow the practices of the so-called close-reading, whereas Barthes tends to see reading as an act of pleasure that cannot be bound by the same institutional standards as the close-reading. Source-influence studies labour strenuously to promote the image of stable forms and genres which originate from the influence that one "work" exercises on another. What this means is that the question of readerly practices, competencies, and expectations in the production of the text is completely overlooked. Thus, it follows that strongly reader-oriented approaches such as Barthes' tend to contribute to the view of a certain text as "writable", to use Barthes' own term, whereas strongly text-oriented approaches such as source-influence studies tend to encourage a more "readable" vision of the text. The "readable" text is seen as a stable, closed text which evokes the same meaning for most readers; this stability thus</page><page sequence="4">48 Rod S. Heimpel encourages source-influence and genre-study. The "writable" text is seen as a precarious, unstable, open text whose numerous functional gaps, to use Roman Ingarden's term, are apt to produce an infinite number of interpretations." What is important in the end is not that source-influence studies miss the intertextual boat or vice-versa, but rather that both move towards different extremes of textuality: the readable and writable texts. Unlike source-influence theory where an authorial intention is seen as calling attention to the "literary" influences on the "work", with theories of intertextuality "it is the reader, then, that establishes a relationship between a focused text and its intertext, and forges its intertextual identity."12 The notion of text is hence open to literary as well as non-literary sources more or less at the reader's discretion (and perception). But it is important to go one step further: in sofar as writable and readable texts can be envisaged, notions of "writable" and "readable" can also be applied to reading practices; tendencies easily become habits of thought or even preferences. More competent readers, whether it is their intention or not, are apt to locate the functional gaps—often the site of intertextual play—which will allow them to produce a reading consistent with Barthes' notion of the writable text. For example, it is usually the case that subsequent and retroactive readings will inevitably raise questions that threaten the "readability" of the text. Thus, since no text is without its functional gaps or moments of "undecidability", as Jacques Derrida would put it, there is no reason to deny the potential "writability" of all texts. Nonetheless, it is important to bear in mind that Barthes' textual models are, after all, an heuristic tool and as such, should not be equated with a definitive "reality", but instead should be seen as a highly generalized image of it. What emerges in the final analysis is two divergent tendencies: (1) Source-influence studies move towards the classification of the influ ences on a particular "work" as belonging to a specific genre, which hence determines the reading of this work according to the pre-existing reading practices of the genre in question; (2) Intertextuality as an essentially reader-oriented theory situates the text in relation to other texts known or even partially known by the reader; (3) Source-influence studies tend to see texts as readable since the very existence of genre witnesses the "fact" that texts are knowable and hence subject to generic classification, and (4) Theories of intertextuality posit that the functional transformation of traces of a prior, contemporary or future text in another text determines its intertextual identity, stricto sensu.</page><page sequence="5">Hitchcock's Psycho.. 49 The following diagram depicts these divergent tendencies and the trajectories I have described: ANCHORING. TRANSFORMATION. AND (INTER)TEXTUALITY Influence &gt; Genre A -&gt; More 'readable" Anchoring &gt; Re-memorization of the trace" y y Transformed trace &gt; Intertextual Identity &gt; More "writable" What I have neglected to describe, nonetheless, is my notion of anchoring as the common starting point of both the source-influence and intertextual trajectories. Anchoring refers to the process whereby a fragment— stylistic, formal, narrative, etc.—is recognized as somehow alien or as belonging to or derivingfrom another text; it may not be a case of ungrammatically per se (Riffaterre) as much as it is merely a hunch, readerly intuition. (I will return to this question shortly.) In any case, the anonymous trace is thus re-marked, re-memorized. Next, the reader finds him/herself at the cross-roads of source-influence and intertextuali ty. It is important to bear in mind that re-memorizing the trace does not imply or guarantee its recognition. And whereas influence demands a positive textual i.d., theories of intertextuality are less exigent: partially known texts, forbidden, forgotten, and even lost texts are all fair game. However, let me stress that considering a trace as the mark of influence does not exclude the possibility that the text whose influence has been re-marked is also part and parcel of an intertext (see the trajectory running towards the transformed trace.) To suggest that every element of a text must be transformed in order to function as an intertext would be suspiciously unreasonable. Rather, the mark of influence may indeed function indexically by pointing to other occur rences of the same re-membered trace-text in the form of transformed traces, i.e. intertext(s).</page><page sequence="6">50 Rod S. Heimpel It is the nature of the trace-text's relation to the "original" which first determines whether a source-influence or intertextual approach is generally most appropriate. Source-influence approaches tend to stress the reverential imitation or translation of an authoritative text into a subsequent text; theories of intertextuality, on the other hand, tend to underline the transformations and transmutations to which the incorpor ated intertext (authoritative or otherwise) has been subjected in the focused text.13 If contemporary literary theory has tended to prefer the notion of intertextuality to source-influence, it is perhaps because of the demoral ized status of the art of imitation. With the rise of the Romantic ideal of the individual and originality, the misunderstood invention involved in the Renaissance arts of imitation and translation have found them selves at an all time low. Today translation refers to commercial rights that are bought and sold, a technical skill whose art is always elsewhere; and the pasticheur is often seen as a common thief who poaches on other people's work like Hemingway poached in other peoples' countries. And whereas radical transformation of an important text in the Renaissance might have been seen as desecration, twentieth-century art forms seem hopelessly addicted to transformational textual relationships.14 With source-influence studies, the act or fact of alluding to a prior text is often read as conferring honorific status. In a sense, the statue of a certain dignitary or national hero in a public park enacts a sugges tively similar "event": like one text's respectful allusion to its anteced ent, the statue does not only witness the contributions of a noteworthy person(s), but often intimates that if it were not for these contributions, the park itself, the very context of the statue, would not exist. Whether it is a war memorial which recalls how freedom was safeguarded by the soldiers who fought in a certain battle or Dante's Virgil, both "events" conspicuously code their indebtedness in the form of memorials: memorials which safeguard the continuities of country and genre respectively. Pastiche, I would argue, is the form par excellence of the "memorialization" of texts exterior to a subsequent "work". Gérard Genette defines pastiche as imitation which does not function as satire.ls What is stressed, then, is the stylistic similarity between texts, not the transformations which define their textual relationship. It is not surprising that Genette would define pastiche by opposing it to satire, a transformational textual relationship based on the outrageous irony of translating non-serious texts into serious texts and vice-versa. In short, pastiche is always more properly a question of inter-stylistics,16 as opposed to a question of intertextuality: the "stylistic memorial"</page><page sequence="7">Hitchcock's Psycho.. SI which does not transform previous texts, but rather speaks "through" an authoritative mentor. The study of literary traditions and genres thrives on such activity since similarity, not difference, is the basis of these approaches. Intertextuality, on the other hand, is not solely interested in anchoring texts in other texts through the practice of erecting honorific, genre-stabilizing memorials; but rather, intertextuality accentuates how the traces of another text function differently in the focused text. Intertexts function when their trace(s) are somehow transformed in the focused text; but these traces cannot function before they are perceived. However, this does not mean that every instance of anchoring must either point to influence or a bi-textual transformational identity. What it does mean, I would argue, is that certain "memorializations", the activity associated with a source-influence approach to allusions, also have an integral role to play in my vision of intertextuality; the call of the intertext is supplemented by the call of influence, which may serve to re-mark the phantasmic image of an un-recognizable intertext: unrecognizable because of the trans- or de-formation which it has undergone. Thus, the disenfranchised art of pastiche also has a critical role to play since it can serve to re-mark and re-memorize tricky intertexts. II. PRACTICE: Psycho in The Grifters Even a cursory history of the origins of theories of intertextuality reveals that its theorists—e.g. Kristeva, Barthes, Riffaterre—were primarily concerned by the relations between and among written texts. Nonetheless, while it is not surprising that the specific practice which theorists envisage for their theories would influence their formulation, there is no immediate reason to think that theories of intertextuality only apply to written texts. For example, with written texts, the sometimes exasperating task of dividing the text into narrative sequences17 is much less of an issue in film where the sequence already visibly constitutes the minimal units of a film's narrative grammar. Furthermore, films can also have narrators, characters, and dialogue just as the novel often has a narrator, characters, and the ability to represent direct speech. Even though Barthes speaks of the "déjà lu" and "citations sans guillemets", with film, the presence of the same fundamental narrativity and linguistic codes implies compatibility. Thus, although I will not ignore the non-linguistic specifically filmic codes—camera angles, colour, lighting, perspective, cuts, sound tracts, etc.—for the most part, my essay will focus on narration and dialogue, elements</page><page sequence="8">52 Rod S. Heimpel which I see at this time as most readily adaptable to modem theories of intertextuality (including my own notions.) In order to consider how Psycho becomes an important intertext in The Grifters, the notion of intertext requires further definition. For me, an intertext may consist of a word, a gesture, punctation, a name, a sentence or an entire narrative sequence. In each case, the contextual meaning of the sign in the intertext is actualized in the focused text. The introduction of one contextual meaning into another text, another body or cybernetic structure, represents the quintessential form of a "textual transplant", which, subject to the readers' re-incorporation of the intertext, is prone to exhibit signs of "rejection." Although this is truly unfortunate in a medical context, intertextuality defines relations between texts according to these moments of rejection, and what they reveal to the reader about both the text and its intertext(s). Intertextual relationships are thus initially instituted by signs of rejection. These signs of rejection differ from Riffaterre's concept of ungrammaticality in that it is notably the reader after all who constructs the actual text body whose role it is to point up difference through signs of rejection. Thus, unlike ungrammaticality which posits a grammar that already is (a structuralist grammar), a theory of rejection emphasizes the specific ity of readers and readings. For me, the first sequence in The Grifters presents signs of rejection, since the various seemingly dated black and white stills of a cityscape conflict with the slick, stylized colour sequences which follow (e.g. three sequences are screened simultaneously.) The anxiety associated with this realization constitutes what I refer to as anchoring. Once more, many of the buildings shown in this sequence recall the fifties or perhaps the sixties (especially because of black and white style), but certainly not the eighties, the implicit temporal frame in The Grifters. Nonetheless, in a retroactive reading, my anxiety was easily assuaged by the fact that Psycho begins with similar black and white "content": a cityscape. It is at this point that the trace-text is re-memorized and in this case, re-cognized; and since the latter are based on similarities, it follows that for the moment, this re-cognized trace-text belongs to the economy of the "déjà vu": the mark of influence. However, in Psycho, the first sequence where the camera sweeps over a black and white cityscape and eventually discovers Sam (John Gavin) and Marion (Janet Leigh) in a hotel room is characterized by its voyeuristic gaze, its wandering eye, what in anthropomorphic terms might be read as perverse curiosity. In Frear's film, on the other hand, the probing, almost panting curiosity of Hitchcock's camera-eye is trans formed into a series of chaste stills (cf. risqué moving shots) whose only</page><page sequence="9">Hitchcock's Psycho.. S3 contribution to introducing the main characters is the end of the sequence, not the end of its gaze. The comfort of the "déjà vu" as the mark of influence (similarity) has now been replaced by the intertextual "déjà-vu mais..."; like the unsettling ethos of the dream-world, this is the: "I know I've been here before, but something is different...." Perhaps it is only the shock of the very different and the very similar which can break the spell of forgetting. On another level, there is the matter of an instance of the recur rence of a particular Une repeated in various forms throughout The Grifters: inordinate repetition is a common symptom of rejection. Consider the following lines which represent three of the most important moments in Frear's film (roughly the beginning, the middle, and the end): Roy: "I guess I owe you my life." Lilly: "You always did." Lilly: "I just give you life. What you do with it is up to you." Lilly: "I gave you your life twice. I'm asking you to give me mine once." In each case, a specific debt is signified when the speaker, Lilly (Anjelica Huston), implies that the act of giving requires the reciprocal act of receiving. On the other hand, consider the following very important lines spoken by the psychiatrist in one of the final scenes in Psycho: He only half-existed to begin with. Now the other half has taken over. [...] Matricide is probably the most unbearable crime of all. Most unbearable to the son who commits it. [...] He began to think and speak for her [his mother]. Give her half his life, so to speak, (my emphasis) In this case, what is signified is "giving" for the purpose of discharging a debt or repayment. Perhaps not surprisingly, "repayment" negates "debt" so that the relation between them is one of contradiction. Similarly, inverting the half-life that Norman (Anthony Perkins) gives to his mother, produces the number two in Lilly's "I gave you your life twice." This type of intertextual relation, which Michael Riffaterre refers to as complementary intertextuality, thus decodes The Grifters as "the negative, in the photographic sense, of its intertext",18 Hitchcock's Psycho. Complementarity occurs when a sign in the focused text</page><page sequence="10">54 Rod S. Heimpel actualizes the reverse or obverse of a specific sign in the intertext. Just as a photographic negative operates numerous concurrent nega tions—foreground &lt;-&gt; background, shadow &lt;-&gt; light, day &lt;-&gt; night, etc., complementarity likewise functions on several different levels of intertextual relations from the maximal, with narrative and verbal sequences, to the minimal, with specific words. Complementarity on the level of the narrative sequence is achieved through the transmutations and transformations of a sequence(s) common to text and intertext(s). For example, the closest narrative relation between Hitchcock's and Frear's films is provided by the chase scenes where in each case a woman ends up at a desolate roadside motel where she is murdered/assailed during the first night of her stay. In Psycho, Marion Crane steals $40,000 cash, which her boss trusts her to bank, money intended to buy another woman's wedding gift. Similarly, Lilly Dillon in The Grifters swindles her boss Bobo by skimming profits and hiding the money in the trunk of her car. When Myra (Annette Bening), her son's girlfriend, tips Bobo off, Lilly flees her hotel room in California and ends up in a roadside motel somewhere outside of Phoenix, not unlike the Bates Motel in Psycho. Interestingly enough, the brief sequence depicting Lilly turning off the main road and driving up to a motel outside of Phoenix tends to re-call the now iconographie image of Marion driving up to a motel fifteen miles outside ofFairvale: darkness, winding roads, suspenseful music, and finally, a looming neon "MOTEL" sign. Yet in terms of the spatialization of the films, an interesting transformation takes place: When Marion arrives at the Bates Motel, in her new car (she trades in her old car in the previous scene), she leaves it in front of the office because it is raining heavily. The position of her car is accentuated when she withdraws from the deserted office to see if honking her horn for service might summon someone to the office. This is when Norman comes down from the eerie house on the hill. This is the last time Marion's car is seen until Norman parks it in front of Cabin #1 where he dumps her body and belongings in the trunk before taking it to the swamp for disposal. The corresponding sequences in The Grifters assemble a rather concerted collection of déjà vu. Lilly also parks her car in front of the MARION: PHOENIX ■&gt; BATES MOTEL outside of Fairvale, Calif. LILLY: LAJOLLA CALIF. -&gt; MOTEL outside of Phoenix, Arizona</page><page sequence="11">Hitchcock's Psycho.. 55 office while she inquires about a room. She chooses a room at the back of the motel over a more convenient location because, as she explains to the motel clerk, she is very tired and does not want to be kept awake by traffic. Nonetheless, the real issue soon emerges when she asks where her car can be parked, since she is after all "on the run". Interestingly enough, the answer is "right in front of your room", and just as Norman backs Marion's car up to the door of Cabin #1, Lilly also backs into her parking space. The offices of the motels are also inordinately similar, more déjà vm. For example, they are both located on the (screen) left side of a string of rooms, and each office has a cozy parlor in the back. The similarities between the motels are also (over?)determined verbally: when Marion asks Norman if he has any vacancies, he responds: "We have twelve vacancies, twelve cabins, twelve vacancies." This Une is rather delicately retraced and transformed in The Grifters when the woman at the motel responds to Lilly's request for a single room in this way: "Everything's the same size, same price." If the trompe d'oeil— the visual similarities and the mood they create—does not re memorize the motel trace-text, perhaps the auditory faculty (arguably second only to the olfactory) will dispel the forgetting which imprisons the text-memory. There is still another rather incredible déjà vu which demands the careful viewer's attention. When Roy (John Cusack) comes to visit Lilly in her hotel room in California, to pay her back for his hospital stay with $4,000, he discovers her gun hidden under a newspaper on a table when he accidentally moves the newspaper with the money he intends to pay her. "Expecting somebody?" he prods. "No. That was the point", Lilly retorts coldly. Marion too uses a newspaper to conceal something. She wraps the $40,000 in a newspaper and places it on the night table next to her bed. In fact, Norman almost forgets about the newspaper as the dutiful son cleaning up after his "mother" (himself) who has just finished off Marion in the famous shower scene. It is the last thing which he tosses into the trunk before taking the car out to the swamp where he disposes of it and the evidence of the crime which has taken place. Lilly, on the other hand, intentionally leaves her gun (and the money in her car) behind in order to frame Myra's suicide as her own. Since the "motive", Cassidy's money, and the "murder weapon", Lilly's gun, belong to the same semantic field, let's call it the "crime", it is significant and signifying that the motive or the cause is transformed into the weapon or an ejfect (of the cause.) Furthermore, the suspicious relation between "four thousand" and "forty thousand", although</page><page sequence="12">56 Rod S. Heimpel circumstantial in the legal sense of the word, tends to encourage the viewer to proceed with the same intertextual suppositions. Now it is time to consider how the initial similarities between the "motel scenes", what I have read as the mark of influence and referred to as déjà vu, are re-worked through the following intertextual transform ations: PSYCHO New Car parked in front of the office. Marion is attacked in the shower by an unidentified assailant. Marion is killed by Norman Bates dressed as his dead mother. Norman wears his mother's dress to kill. Marion's assailant moves her car in front of her room, dumps her and the $ 40,000 still wrapped in the newspaper in the trunk, drives the car to the swamp where he (Norman) dis poses of it. THE GRIFTERS Own car parked in front of room. Lilly is followed and attacked in bed by an awoved enemy, Myra. Lilly kills her assailant who dresses like her. Lilly wears her son's girl friend's dress so that she can live. Lilly leaves her car and her money and plants her gun (minus the newspaper) to frame her assailant's suicide and leaves her dead assailant in her dead assailant's car. What is often initially re-memorized through similarities has provided a differentiating context for the foregrounding of intertextual transform ations. However, even though the above transformations may be "logically correct", in order to experience the significance of these transform ations, it is clearly necessary to identify with the "actors" responsible for the (transformed) actions. For in addition to the process of spatializa tion and temporalization, narrative texts habitually have recourse to the anthropomorphic process of "actorialization", to use the terms of A.J. Greimas' narratology." Not only are actors or characters figurativized</page><page sequence="13">Hitchcock's Psycho. 57 according to certain norms and patterns in the "real world", but like people, they are also defined by their interrelationships. Compare the following diagrams: PSYCHO LOOK-ALIKES NORMAN BATES MRS. BATES THE GRIFTERS LOOK-ALIKES A quick glance at this diagram shows the suspicious relations and apparent transformations of the female characters' names. The younger women in each film are Marion and Myra, and their elders are Lila (Vera Miles) and Lilly respectively. This M-L game is made more suspicious still by the fact that Lila and Myra are, of course, rhymes produced by replacing the 'L' in Lila with the 'M' from Marion. Beyond these language games, the strong resemblance between Marion and Lila is reproduced in The Grifters in the striking similarities between Myra and Lilly: everything from physical qualities, taste in cars and clothes (and men) to the fact that they are both "grifters". Marion and Lila look alike as well, but the resemblance is not as disturbing since they are after all sisters. However, what they do have in common which seems somewhat out of the ordinary is Sam Loomis, Marion's boyfriend. With Marion out of the picture, Sam and Lila grow closer during their quest to find Marion. For example, Sheriff Chambers' wife invites Lila</page><page sequence="14">58 Rod S. Heimpel and Sam to dinner as if they were a couple, not people brought together by a rather dark mystery. Likewise, Sam and Lila are immediately comfortable with the notion of disguising themselves as a married couple who just happen by the Bates Motel. In the end, it seems that whatever attracts Sam to Marion is also present in her sister, Lila. Ironically, Roy's attraction to Myra, Lilly's "double", seems to function in much the same way: Roy's relationship with Myra would seem to replace whatever he once had or would have with Lilly. This is ironically disconcerting since Roy and Myra's relationship is predomi nantly based on sexual attraction. Implicitly, then, there is an "incest story" that needs to be told, an incest story that would further corrobor ate the presence of Hitchcock's Psycho in The Grifters. In Psycho, Norman's relation with/to his mother lies at the very heart of the text. Nonetheless, I have still placed them outside of the triangle representing the relationships between the characters in Hitchcock's film because Norman acts on Marion, a stranger in his motel whereas the relations in both triangles are familial, consensual, or at least mutual relations. Norman's relationship with his mother pro vides three vitally important subnarratives: the "incest story", the matricide, and the murders Norman commits as his mother. All of these are incorporated and transformed in The Grifters. For example, Norman himself refers to the possibility of incest when Marion asks him if he goes out with friends: "Well, a boy's best friend is his mother." This line is clearly re-worked in The Grifters so that the link is not purely thematic, but rather (inter)textual. After Myra accuses Roy of incest with his mother ("You like to go back where you've been"), he strikes her, she leaves in her red dress. Next, he phones Lilly in order to try to smooth things over, and agrees to visit her at her hotel, of course, for a "conversation." When he questions his own motivations, he retraces Norman's repeated reference to himself as a "boy" in Psycho in the form of the following question: "Who's a boy going to talk to, if not his mother?" Unless accommodated by the Psycho intertext, the word "boy" remains curiously out of place since Roy tends to deny that Lilly is "his mother" by calling her Lilly, and by failing to show her respect on any terms. There are other clues as well to the incest story in The Grifters. For example, Roy's sexual advances with his nurse are preempted when she responds: "You'd better behave or I'll tell your mother," Like the manipulative, clinging Mrs. Bates, Lilly somehow has a hold on Roy. Even when she kisses him, it does not seem like the kind of kiss a mother gives her son. Likewise, as indicated above, Roy addresses his mother by her first name. Does he want to forget that she is after all</page><page sequence="15">Hitchcock's Psycho. 59 his mother? This is what Lilly is banking on when she tries to trick him into handing over his money by putting the question to him directly: "What if I told you I wasn't really your mother?" Furthermore, is it not significant that Roy is a grifter, the chosen life and profession of his mother? Ironically, the psychiatrist's evaluation ofNorman may indeed apply to Roy as well: "He tried to be his mother." However, Roy is not pathologically jealous of his mother to the point where he would kill in order to possess her. This is the oedipal pattern played out in Psycho.20 Unlike Oedipus (and Norman), however, it is Lilly, the mother, who is jealous of her son's relationship with Myra. In fact, Lilly goes as far as hiring an attractive nurse to look in on Roy at home, and with any luck, to make him break up with Myra. Roy is angry and ashamed and thus reveals Lilly's plan to the nurse. Moreover, although Myra is virtually Lilly's twin, Lilly stiZZ strongly disapproves of her: still because she implicitly approves of herself for the "same" role. On the other hand (and although I cannot develop this argument in sufficient detail), the oedipal inversion would be perfect if Lilly would premeditate Myra's murder so that she could possess Roy once and for all. Instead, Lilly successfully defends herself against Myra by shooting her fatally in the head. This does not only constitute the inversion of Norman's attack on Marion, but also his modus operandi. Norman dresses up like his mother to kill women who arouse or somehow threaten him, whereas Myra who is already dressed like her intended victim, Lilly, ends up being killed by her intended same-sex victim, at which time Lilly becomes Myra (by switching dresses and cars), and by extension (or perhaps default), her own son's girlfriend! Myra is first like Marion when she is dating Roy, like Norman when she assails Lilly, and ironically, again like Marion when she is killed by Lilly. In The Grifters, there is no matricide although there is certainly incestuous tension (as in Psycho), and Lilly, unlike Mrs. Bates who is long since dead when the story begins, is the sole-survivor among the three main characters. Lurking "behind" the final fateful meeting between Roy and Lilly is the intertext of the matricide in the Psycho narrative, an intertext which at this point the reader is almost inclined to fore-see, due largely to the strong presence of the already-seen (déjà vu). Recall that it is Norman who poisons his mother and her lover, as the psychiatrist discovers at the end of the film; it is not the "only case of murder and suicide on Fairvale ledgers" as the Sheriff mistakenly believes (cf. Lilly's "suicide" which in fact was Myra's "murder", i.e. not only the wrong crime, but also the wrong victim!). When Lilly very</page><page sequence="16">60 Rod S. Heimpel suspiciously volunteers to fetch some ice water for Roy and herself, the following sentence points to a potential poisoning: "Take whichever one you want." Of course, once read in relation to the intertext, this line is quite ironic, since in Psycho it is Norman who serves his mother poisoned tea and not the inverse. And I would argue that this intertext ual transformation cuts deeper still by ironizing the dead figurativeness (to recall Derrida's "dead metaphors") of everyday speech. Norman murders his mother by poisoning her cup of tea (i.e. the contents), whereas Roy is killed by his glass of water (i.e. the container). In other words, the intertext has been transformed via the métonymie inversion of the contents and the container: the dead metonymy has come back to life only to claim Roy's. On another level, Norman's intentional poisoning of his mother has been transformed into Lilly's unintentional crime of murdering her own son. It is also important to note that Norman wears his mother's dress and a wig when he is "dressed to kill" whereas Lilly finds herself dressed in her son's (ex)girlfriend's dress and kerchief when she unwittingly takes her son's life, the life which she gave him twice. Both Norman and Lilly are in desperate situations which presumably require desperate measures. When Roy responds "You wouldn't do that", Lilly confesses her desperation: "You don't know what I'd do. You have no idea... to live." Since she kills her son Roy by mistake, Lilly ironically does not even know what she would do. The inversion or photographic negative is hence complete: an intentional matricide committed by a son in Psycho becomes an unintentional filicide committed by the mother in The Grifters. Complementarity, as I have suggested, can also be achieved through an intertext consisting of a single word. This is the case, I will argue, of the re-working of the word "pay" in The Grifters. However, "pay" is not merely re-worked in such a manner that a new contextual meaning is produced in the focused text, effecting a specific transform ation of the meaning of the word in the intertext (i.e. not a syllepsis, see note 3); instead, "pay" already has two contextual meanings in Psycho. Thus, unlike the rather straight-forward inversion of the terms of the metonymy of the content/contained, for example, "pay" is arranged into the moral-talk/money-talk binarism in Psycho, which is subsequently re-produced, inverted, and ironized in The Grifters. It is important to bear in mind that binarisms are not only groups of two terms in which one term presupposes the other, but also the prioritization or valorization of the first term vis-à-vis the second. In other words, it is the very values at the heart of the characters' motivations which are at issue.</page><page sequence="17">Hitchcock's Psycho.. 61 The importance of the word "pay" first emerges in one of the opening scenes of Psycho when Sam makes the following emphatic observations about "paying": I'm tired of sweating for people who aren't there. I sweat to pay off my father's debts, and he's in his grave. I sweat to pay my ex-wife alimony and she's living on the other side of the world somewhere. (my emphasis) Marion responds in this way: "I pay too. They also pay who meet in hotel rooms." (my emphasis) What occurs in this instance is the activation of two different contextual meanings of "pay." Marion transforms money-talk, pay in the sense of offering money in exchange for services or merchandise, into moral-talk, pay in the sense of suffering brought on by wrong-doing. Thus "pay" does not function as a syllepsis, but rather as the perfectly ordinary alternation between two contextual meanings. The binarization of these meanings, among others, is programmed by their co-presence at the time of their repeated recurrence throughout both The Grifters and Psycho. In other words, complementarity is achieved through the transposition of the terms of a nuclear binarism common to both text and intertext. It is not until the second last sequence in Psycho that the binarism is finally focused and fixed: "These were crimes of passion, not profit." "Passion, not profit" hence arranges moral-talk and money-talk into the binarism passion/profit. One of the reasons why it takes so long to solve Marion's murder is that everyone assumes that the stolen money is the only possible motive for her disappearance: i.e. profit/passion. The detective poking around the motel insinuates that Norman would hide someone if he were paid well. Sam also sees the forty thousand dollars as Norman's motive for murder since it would allow him to build a new motel on the new highway, in effect, to buy a new life. During the psychiatrist's speech, Sheriff Chambers asks about the whereabouts of the money. It is at this point that the psychiatrist suggests that it is probably in the swamp with Marion's car, and then emphasizes his main point about Norman's crimes: "These were crimes of passion, not profit." On the other hand, profit and not passion is the first and foremost motive of the crimes committed in The Grifters, profit even though the "criminals" assail people with whom, one would assume, they have some sort of passionate bond, be it positive or negative. For example, Myra is only Roy's girlfriend until he refuses her plan to become partners on a "long-con." She blames Lilly for thwarting her plans and</page><page sequence="18">62 Rod S. Heimpel discovers the incestuous tensions between Roy and Lilly. When Myra hunts down Lilly at the motel, I would argue that she is primarily seek ing revenge for spoiling her "crime of profit" with Roy. Even Lilly misreads Myra's intentions, since she assumes that Myra was only after money (Lilly's). This constitutes a misreading because Myra knows where Lilly's money is hidden (she followed her to the track) and easily could have taken it while Lilly was asleep. All detective work aside, it is important to recall what Myra mutters as she is leaving Roy's apartment: "I'll get to his [Roy's] mama." Myra's crimes of profit cause her to commit her final crime, a foiled crime of passion. Likewise, Lilly does not kill Roy because she cannot possess him or is afraid of possessing him, but rather accidentally kills him while trying to make away with his money. She only uses the incestuous tension between them as a last minute dodge to get close enough to hit him with the briefcase full of money which she so desperately wants. When she accidentally kills Roy, she seems remorseful, but does not forsake her real purpose. Therefore, she quickly gathers up the spilled money (from among the spilled blood), washes her hands à la Norman Bates (the messy cleanup after the shower scene), takes Roy's car (just as she has taken Myra's car, life, and identity) and drives off into the cityscape (cf. the introductory sequence). The receiver of the text is thus reminded that although stealing Roy's money may constitute a crime of passion in that she feels that this money will save her life, like Myra's foiled crime of passion, Lilly's is only the end result of her original crime of profit, stealing her boss' money. Conversely, Marion who also steals a large sum of money from her boss is seduced by the prospect of using this money to buy a life with Sam. Nonetheless, this does not change the legal reality that Marion is indeed guilty of a crime of profit even though she is principally driven by her passions. In other words, as with Lilly and Myra, Marion's motives for committing this crime are much more complex than both the court's "guilty" or "not guilty" and the categories of "passion" or "profit." Perhaps the best way to express these intricacies, then, is to express them as complex categories where the primary motive is modified by the secondary motive in the form of an adjective. Thus, whereas Marion commits a profitable crime of passion, Myra and Lilly commit passionate crimes of profit. Recall that it is Lilly who keeps reminding Roy that as her son, he owes her his life, and since it is also Lilly who saves his life by calling a doctor, Roy's moral liability to Lilly is doubled. What smacks of irony is that Roy responds to Lilly's moral-talk with money-talk. "I pay my debts", he asserts proudly when he presents Lilly with money intended</page><page sequence="19">Hitchcock's Psycho. 63 for his hospital bill (my emphasis). Like Sam, then, Roy prefers money talk, and like Marion ("They also pay who meet in hotel rooms"), Lilly prefers moral-talk (with Roy). But just as Marion's moral-talk becomes money-talk when she steals Cassidy's money, Lilly's moral-talk also undergoes a final transformation when she pleads with Roy for his money: "I gave you your life twice, I'm asking you to give me mine once. I need the money Roy." At this point and ironically so, Lilly's moral-talk ("I gave you your life twice") becomes money-talk, since life now becomes the semantic equivalent of money. Roy's money, she thinks, will enable her "to live", although it is more precisely a case of outrunning death. In the end, however, the parallel alternation between opposing semantic investments of "pay" comes to rest on a final doubly ironic transformation: for Marion, crime does not pay on any terms, whereas for Lilly, crime does pay since she does succeed in collecting the money she needs in order to "skip town." Needless to say, however, they also pay who profit. The binarism passion/profit (or moral-talk and money-talk) activated in Psycho by the word "pay" has been re-activated and inverted in the focused text; and whereas the psychiatrist makes the passion/profit binarism explicit at the end of Psycho, an intertextual reading of "pay" provides a complementary implicit conclusion in The Grifters: these were crimes of profit, not passion. III. CONCLUSION In this essay, I have presented a reading of what I see as the strong intertextual relations between Hitchcock's Psycho and Stephen Frear's The Grifters. Whereas I have emphasized the importance of narrative and verbal complementarity, in conclusion, I would like to reiterate my belief that specifically filmic codes—lighting, angles, cuts, sound tracks, etc.—are also potentially a fruitful source of future critical insights. First however, it is important to further develop a notion of influence which does not make intertextuality the slave of fledgling theories of textuality or vice-versa. Moreover, perhaps the so-called death of the author was once seen as a necessary step in the development of synchronic structuralisms, but today I think it is important to re-think the role of authorship and influence in relation to the dynamics of diachronic institutions and less positivistic approaches to textuality. Influence is not only a structure, but also a politics.</page><page sequence="20">64 Rod S. Heimpel NOTES 1. See Michael Riffaterre, "L'Intertexte inconnu," Littérature 41 (1981), pp. 4-7. 2.

The "focused text" is the " main" text, the text in which the intertext(s) functions. I have chosen this term for reasons of compatibility since 1 share Miller's view of the text: "The text is in itself complete and the intertext merely an addition brought by a reader making, in his engagement with that text, connections with his own repertoire." (p. 33) Miller's view comes out against presuppositions in the text which force certain interpretations on the reader. Reversibility of the text-intertext or figure-ground relationships in Miller's theory drives towards familiar theoretical "ground": Bakhtine's "dialogical principle" (see pp. 35-36 in particular.) 14. See Linda Hutcheon, A Theory of Parody: The Teachings of Twentieth-Century Art Forms, New York and London: Methuen, 1985. Hutcheon calls for a "modern" definition of parody (independent of the derisiveness associated with eighteenth and nineteenth-century notions of "parody as ridicule") as a specific form of intertextual identity, a relationship characterized by its self-consciousness and ironic trans-contextualizations. 15.

See also Daniel Bilous, "Intertexte/Pastiche: L'Intermimotexte," Texte 2 (1983), pp. 135-60. 17. In S/Z, for example, Barthes develops a semiotics of connotation in which the division of Flaubert's Sarrasine into narrative sequences or "lexies" instigates the pluralization of a text of an otherwise "innocent" text. Likewise, the practice of dividing texts into narrative sequences also figures strongly in A.J. Greimas' narratology.

It is perhaps worth noting that Roy as the old orthography for the modern French "roi" or "king" might also recall the Latin "rex," and thus, the "incest story," Oedipus Rex. Rod S.
