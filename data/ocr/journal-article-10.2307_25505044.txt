<plain_text><page sequence="1">Benjamin Keatinge The Hammers of the Stone-Cutters': Samuel Beckett's Stone Imagery Beckett's fascination with the inorganic dates back to his childhood. James Knowlson, in his biography, explains his early interest in stone in psychological terms: [Beckett] used to take stones of which he was particularly fond home with him from the beach in order to protect them from the wearing away of the waves or the vagaries of the weather. He would lay them gently into the branches of trees in the garden to keep them safe from harm. Later in life, he came to rationalise this concern as the manifestation of an early fascination with the mineral, with things dying and decaying, with petrification. He linked this interest with Sigmund Freud's view that human beings have a prebirth nostalgia to return to the mineral state. And, in Beckett's later work, there is an obsession with decay and with petrification, with stone and with bone.1 This fostering attitude towards the inorganic involves an unusual emotional investment in inanimate matter which is reflected in some of his major works. This essay will explore, in some detail, the function of the inorganic and mineral in Beckett's mature prose and drama. I. Quarrying Beckett The foregrounding of the inorganic in his work is closely related to Beckett's emerging scepticism, as a young man, as to the possibility of human interconnection or emotional rapport with others. These views were formulated in the nineteen thirties through a dialogue with art which can be traced in some revealing statements Beckett made to Thomas MacGreevy in their correspondence. Beckett particularly resisted the anthropomorphic tendency to humanize landscape or to see nature as an extension of man's domain. Rather, he was struck by nature's indifference, its absolute unrelatedness to human affairs. Admiring the paintings of Cezanne in London in 1934, he writes to MacGreevy: 322</page><page sequence="2">SAMUEL BECKETT'S STONE IMAGERY What a relief the Mont Ste.[Sainte] Victoire after all the anthropomorphized landscape ? van Goyen, Avercamp, the Ruysdaels, Hobbema, even Claude, Wilson and Crome Yellow Esq., or paranthropomorphised [sic] by Watteau ... or hyperanthropomorphized by Rubens ? Tellus in record travail, or castrated by Corot; after all the landscape 'promoted' to the emotions of the hiker, postulated as concerned with the hiker ...2 Cezanne, Beckett suggests, sees landscape 'as material of a strictly peculiar order, incommensurable with all human expressions whatsoever'.3 While Beckett resists the Romantic tendency to invest the landscape with personality or to see it as a reflection of the human soul, he does respond to its mineral and inorganic qualities, finding here, perhaps, the traits which render it separate from the human realm. It was these elements which he admired in the painting of Jack B. Yeats in which he saw 'nature almost as inhumanly inorganic as a stage set' with Yeats's depopulated landscapes demonstrating 'the ultimate inorganicism of everything' in which 'people are mineral in the end'.4 In this mineral domain, Beckett sees disconnection and isolation as key traits. He describes Yeats's art as 'A painting of pure inorganic juxtapositions, where nothing can be taken or given and there is no possibility of change or exchange'.5 Beckett may have resisted MacGreevy's depiction of Jack B. Yeats as a national(istic) painter as his review of 'MacGreevy on Yeats' makes clear;6 but he was in substantial agreement with MacGreevy's assessment of the 'impersonal' qualities of Yeats's later canvases.7 MacGreevy identifies, in his 1945 monograph on the painter, traits of 'association and apartness' in Yeats.8 For MacGreevy the impersonality of the landscape heightens the humanity of the figures, and vice versa so that we find, in such canvases as Two Travellers (1942), a perfect juxtaposition of the human and inorganic. Beckett chooses to stress, in his own work, the disconnection such imagery implies and the iconic stage sets he himself created draw on Yeatsian inorganicism and are directly inspired by the perceived separateness of landscape in Yeats's art. Beckett's sense of the otherness of landscape may, like his stone obsession, have its origins in childhood. As Eoin O'Brien has shown in his The Beckett Country, Beckett was deeply affected by the stony terrain of south Co Dublin and Co Wicklow. Glencullen and Glencree and the Two Rock and Three Rock mountains contained numerous working granite quarries in Beckett's youth and the beaches at Killiney and Greystones offered no shortage of stones. The young Beckett may have sensed the impermanence of man set against these rocky inclines 323</page><page sequence="3">IRISH UNIVERSITY REVIEW resembling, as Hamm puts it in Endgame, 'a little bit of grit in the middle of the steppe'.9 The sense of man being dwarfed by an indifferent environment recurs in Beckett's work. Even the simple stage setting of Godot 'A country road. A tree. Evening'10 seems to enact a fruitless interchange between the tramps and their setting. While the play incorporates an element of Romantic yearning in a visual parallel with Caspar David Friedrich's Two Men Contemplating the Moon (1819/20), the overall relationship to nature is one of 'association and apartness' which emphasizes the solidarity of Estragon and Vladimir in contrast to their estranged relation to landscape. At one point, Vladimir looks 'wildly about him, as though the date was inscribed in the landscape',11 a gesture which enacts the futility of their attempts to connect with their surroundings. Waiting for Godot emphasizes geological depth over geographical relationship. Lucky's 'abode of stones' refers to geological upheavals and his speech evokes geological time over historical or human time: in the plains in the mountains by the seas by the rivers running water running fire the air is the same and then the earth namely the air and then the earth abode of stones in the great cold ... the great deeps the great cold on sea on land.12 Beckett copied out a list of geological periods from an unknown source in the Whoroscope Notebook. He also contrasts historical versus geological time in his poem 'ainsi a-t-on beau' where he recalls Te mammouth/le dinotherium les premiers baisers/les periodes glaciares' as well as Ta grande chaleur du treizieme de leur ere/sur Lisbonne fumante Kant froidement penche/rever en generations de chenes'.13 Clearly the purpose of such imagery is to contrast three competing timescales: the geological, the historical, and the personal. Godot incorporates the first and third of these, dispensing with history (as Estragon says T'm not a historian').14 Indeed, historical time plays a much lesser role in Beckett than does geological depth. The geology of the imagination is an important concept in Beckett. The excavatory metaphors which he uses in Proust to describe the creative process are not far off his own sense of art as a subterranean descent in which 'the only fertile research is excavatory, immersive, a contraction of the spirit, a descent'.15 The idea of stripping off layers of language and meaning is also familiar from the famous German letter of 1937 where Beckett refers to language as 'a veil that must be torn apart in order to get at the things (or the Nothingness) behind it'.16 In an early draft of Watt, this process is described as 'auto-speliology' [sic] 324</page><page sequence="4">SAMUEL BECKETT'S STONE IMAGERY which involves going 'deep down in those palaeozoic profounds, midst mammoth Old Red Sandstone phalli and Carboniferous pudenda'.17 So geology acts as a metaphor for the the creative process, a means of accessing those 'Profounds of mind'18 which yield inspiration. Beckett described this process to Lawrence Harvey 'in images of getting down, getting below the surface, concentrating, listening, getting your ear down so you can hear the infinitesimal murmur'.19 For scholars, the excavatory metaphor also describes their work of dredging Beckett's manuscripts for clues and Beckett's allusiveness has meant that much 'fertile research' has indeed been 'excavatory'. In the eyes of C. J. Ackerley, certain Beckett manuscripts constitute a 'fossil record'20 of his working practice and the notion of stratification, of bedrock and subsoil and surface, is useful in addressing texts which so often move between subterranean darkness and brighter climes. The faintly religious aura of landscape symbolism in Godot (the moon and the tree which mysteriously sprouts leaves overnight) is further exploited in Beckett's co-option of and satire on the ritualistic possibilities of stone in Molloy. Stone has always had religious significance as our stony heritage of cromlechs, dolmens, and passage tombs implies and the archaeological fascination of such monuments as Newgrange or Stonehenge affirms the stoniness of the sacred. Mircea Eliade, in his study of ancient religious practices, outlines the function of stone in primitive societies: the hardness, ruggedness and permanence of matter was in itself a hierophany in the religious consciousness of the primitive. And nothing was more direct and autonomous in the completeness of its strength, nothing more noble or more awe-inspiring, than a majestic rock, or a boldly-standing block of granite. Above all, stone is. It always remains itself. Rock shows him something that transcends the precariousness of his humanity. Stone [at burial grounds] was a protection against animals and robbers and, above all, against 'death', for, stone was incorruptible, the soul of the dead man must continue to exist as itself.21 In its fixity and relative permanence stone has, in most religions, a commemorative and sacred function which Beckett exploits to great comic effect in the passage on Molloy's sucking-stones.22 The solipsistic ritual of Molloy has been read by Melvin J. Friedman as 'a vast gesture of mockery' against the ceremonial and sacred associations of stone.23 Molloy's discourse on method is an essay in futility which nonetheless multiplies meanings. His minute focus on 325</page><page sequence="5">IRISH UNIVERSITY REVIEW the process of differentiation of the sucking-stones soon collapses into an absolute indifference with the admission that 'deep down I didn't give a fiddler's curse' (p.74) as to the order in which the stones circulate. Furthermore, the stones, in their mineral state, are the perfect emblem for this absolute indifference. 'They all tasted exactly the same' (p.74), says Molloy, with the recognition that stones are the blank, tasteless objects into which he projects his 'incompatible bodily needs' (p.74). Chief among these is the requirement for order and control, but there is also a suggestion of oral plenitude, an impulse which Molloy is loathe to acknowledge. Typically, he elides these two needs and merely refers to incompatible means of ordering his stones. The 'uneven distribution', by which he attains continuous circulation of the different stones, 'was painful to me, bodily' (p.74), says Molloy, but equally, 'to suck the stones ... not haphazard, but with method was also ... a bodily need' (p.74). The focus of Molloy's desires on inanimate objects relates to Beckett's strange linkage of the nurturing instinct with stone. It could be said that Molloy fosters his stones in the same manner as the young Beckett did and this investment of need onto inanimate matter has curious psychological implications. Lawrence Harvey, in a discussion of Beckett's 1935 volume Echo's Bones, enumerates the themes which he adapts from Ovid's tale of Echo and Narcissus,24 notably those of 'need and the impossibility of love's fulfillment' (p.69). Harvey identifies 'a whole series of themes from absence to sterility' in Beckett's poems which demonstrate, he suggests, a kind of 'unresolved tension' (p.69). This unresolved tension is rendered comic in Molloy's incompatible iDodily' needs, but there is, nevertheless, a serious edge to Molloy's craving for order. The investment of Molloy in his stones entails a kind of disinvestment from human emotion which Echo's Bones, in a serious vein, painfully testifies to. The poetry's preoccupation with 'desire that refuses to die and satisfaction that eludes the seeker' (p.70) is adopted again, in less nakedly biographical terms, in Molloy which depicts, in Harvey's terms, 'the survival of a need so tenacious that it finally assumes ontological status' (p.70). Beckett has co opted a kind of rationalistic logic (as Harvey writes T need, therefore I am') and ritualistic religion and sabotaged them comically, while at the same time making a serious point about the disappointments which all our needs bring in their wake. The ambivalence created by Molloy's conflicting sense of his needs is an emotional fulcrum around which much of his narrative revolves. If his material requirements are famously modest so, it seems, are his emotional ones. But the conflict between his 'bodily' or emotional requirements and his overall resistance to the inevitability of need 326</page><page sequence="6">SAMUEL BECKETT'S STONE IMAGERY provides a serio-comic paradigm for the novel. Beckett is also, quite flagrantly, co-opting psychoanalytic ideas of lack, reparation, mother fixation, and orality and knowingly satirizing them. Molloy's sense of lack and his simultaneous disavowal of this lack become an occasion for emphasizing the futility of human needs and his sucking-stones satirically highlight the vanity of human wishes. The linkage made by Freudian psychoanalysis of the inorganic with the putative death drive, an instinct beyond the pleasure principle, is implicit in Molloy's disquisition on his sucking-stones. The neutral and inert properties of stone remind us of Freud's idea that, behind destructive human emotions, lies a desire to return to the inorganic. Beckett, as James Knowlson states, was well aware of these theories and explained his early stone hoarding in Freudian terms. And of course, there are numerous instances where death and self-destruction are linked to stone imagery in Beckett's work (the shingle in Embers, the stones at the conclusion of Eh Joe, the stone-related expiration of Malone in Malone Dies). The inorganic is expressive here by its very inertness, a kind of zero point which foregrounds the destructive elements in these texts. However, the inorganic does not just describe an instinct towards death, as Freud would have it, but with Beckett becomes part of the flatness and futility his texts often describe. Just as Molloy's undifferentiation elides into indifference, so the contrast between life and death, which Freud's theories emphasize, is undone by Beckett in the very indifference and uncertainty of his characters as to whether they are alive or dead. This is most conspicuous in Malone Dies25 where the dying Malone decides to face death equably and to remain 'neutral and inert' (p. 179): Yes I shall be natural at last, I shall suffer more, then less, without drawing any conclusions, I shall pay less heed to myself, I shall be neither hot nor cold any more, I shall be tepid, I shall die tepid, without enthusiasm (p. 180). Malone's torpid indifference is reflected in his stories which will be 'almost lifeless, like the teller' (p.180) and will include 'one about a thing ... a stone probably' (p. 181). The sequence of (supposedly) differentiated stories, 'One about a man, another about a woman, a third about a thing and finally one about an animal' (p.181), merges into one tepid narrative. The undifferentiation and indifference which preoccupied Molloy now serve to undermine the role of narrative itself. The corrosive banality of Malone's stories, their self-confessed 'tedium',26 belong to the realm of the 'expressionless'27 and hence to the inorganic. 327</page><page sequence="7">IRISH UNIVERSITY REVIEW In the light of Beckett's views on depopulated landscapes and his co option of stone in both Molloy and the opening of Malone Dies, it is interesting to reconsider the conclusion of Malone Dies which has an epiphanic quality at odds with the novel's ostentatious banality elsewhere. As Malone expires along with his surrogates, the south Co Dublin landscape takes on elements of the Romantic sublime implying a certain transcendence which is uncharacteristic of Beckett. This is bitterly counterpointed by Malone's dismissal of 'this fucking scenery'.28 But, nonetheless, the landscape arguably does take on a certain pathos which overcomes Malone's habitual torpor as he nears his end: No, they are no more than hills, they raise themselves gently, faintly blue out of the confused plain. It was there somewhere he was born, in a fine house, of loving parents. Their slopes are covered with ling and furze, its hot yellow bells, better known as gorse. The hammers of the stone-cutters ring all day like bells.29 The anti-culmination of the novel acquires gravitas through the stone cutters' requiem. Unlike some of Beckett's characters, who seem to 'Peter out in the stones'30 anti-climactically, there is, arguably, a certain grandeur and expansiveness to Malone's death which is also weighted with Christian mythology via Dante. The stoniness of the sacred adds an unsuspected dignity to Malone's death, a gravitas against which he struggles. As such, Freud's oppositional paradigm between the pleasure principle and the death drive seems singularly inapposite to describe Beckett's aesthetics of expiration. This is not a self-destructive return to the mineral operating beyond the pleasure principle, but rather a spiritualized epiphany which animizes the inanimate. By foregrounding the process of dying, death itself is granted the very animate quality which Freud rejects. Beckett seems to be reversing the equation and subverting that most fundamental distinction, the opposition between life and death. He undermines the death drive by breathing literary life into a death sequence. The Unnamable might be regarded as a continuation of this principle of animizing the inanimate since it seems to be a sequence which takes place beyond the final moments of Malone. We witness a jabbering subterranean voice which refuses to die. In conversation with Lawrence Harvey, Beckett referred to 'the unreality of life on the surface' and his sense that 'being is so unlike what one is standing up' and that somewhere in the depths there lurks 'a presence, embryonic, undeveloped, of a self that might have been but never got born, an et re manque'?x The Unnamable is a novel which takes us beyond the normal 328</page><page sequence="8">SAMUEL BECKETT'S STONE IMAGERY parameters of being towards this embryonic and undeveloped self. It is a text which operates beyond the pleasure principle, but also beyond the death drive since the dichotomy of life and death has been obliterated. It is a text which is in every sense 'beyond' our earthly sensibilities: Here there is no wood, nor any stone, or if there is, the facts are there, it's as if there wasn't, the facts are there, no vegetables, no minerals, only Worm, kingdom unknown.32 Worm's kingdom defies conventional boundaries; it refuses to locate itself in any conventional sense just as the narrative voice resists being bound by a single identity. We should be wary of coalescing with any 'stupid obsession with depth'33 which tries to situate The Unnamable inside recognizable spatio-temporal co-ordinates. Clearly, The Unnamable operates beyond these terms and is not material, historical, or mortal but rather articulates a manic transcendentalism which refuses to be pinned down by human categories. The narrative line of The Unnamable lends it a different aura to Malone Dies; it describes a process and not a goal. The sands of time are enacted differently and seem to lack the trajectory of dissolution that energizes the conclusion of Malone Dies: the question may be asked, off the record, why time doesn't pass, doesn't pass, from you, why it piles up about you, instant on instant, on all sides, deeper and deeper, thicker and thicker, your time, other's time, the time of the ancient dead and the dead yet unborn, why it buries you grain by grain neither dead nor alive, with no memory of anything, no hope of anything, no knowledge of anything, no history and no prospects, buried under the seconds, saying any old thing, your mouth full of sand.34 Conventional timescales are no longer relevant; the geological, the historical, and the human merge into one so that the distinction between the archeaological past and the immediate past hardly matters. The ancient dead and the future dead inhabit the same kingdom and there is no arrow of development linking the two. The Unnamable is a curiously static book. Despite its high linguistic tempo, the Unnamable does not move and his dynamism is enacted entirely through language. But this absolute stasis is atypical of Beckett's stony scenarios, especially in the drama, where the synergy of the animate and inanimate is most conspicuous and where the dynamics of petrification and reanimation have an important function. 329</page><page sequence="9">IRISH UNIVERSITY REVIEW II. Beckett's Mythologies of Stone Perhaps the clearest analogy between the mineral and the Freudian death drive in Beckett's work can be found in two plays, the television play Eh Joe (1966) and the radio play Embers (1959). Both these works evoke haunting aural presences, voices in the head, which torture the listening protagonists. In Eh foe, the eponymous Joe is shown in a sparsely furnished room listening to the voice of one of his former lovers whom he has abandoned and who now rebukes him for his cruel treatment of her and other women, one of whom has committed suicide as a result of her liaison with Joe. The play hence concerns guilt and recrimination and the use of stone imagery underlines Joe's callous and unfeeling behaviour. The woman suicide victim is described as 'Clawing at the shingle' in desperation as her life ebbs away35 Her suicide is linked To the stones' (p.366) and Beckett contrasts her sensual vitality, her 'Lips on a stone' (p.366), her 'Breasts in the stones' (p.366, Beckett's italics), with the stones' indifferent embrace in what seems a straightforward Freudian return to the inorganic. The juxtaposition of mental distress and stone imagery in Embers has a similar impact. In fact, it is even more classically Freudian in its suggestion of repetition-compulsion, the helpless re-enactment of psychic trauma on the part of Henry, the main character. He is drawn to the sea in spite of the traumatic association it has for him with the death of his father by drowning. The aural world of the play is a disturbing cacophony which intermingles the ebbing of the tide and Henry's own imprecations and the voices, real or imaginary, of his wife Ada and daughter Addie. Henry derives no comfort from sitting on the shingle, rather he feels threatened by its imaginary 'Lips and claws':36 Henry: [Wildly.] Thuds, I want thuds! Like this! [He fumbles in the shingle, catches up two big stones and starts dashing them together.] Stone! [Clash!] Stone! [Clash. 'Stone!'and clash amplified, cut off. Pause. He throws one stone away. Sound of its fall] That's life! [He throws the other stone away. Sound of its fall.] Not this... [Pause.]... sucking!37 As with Eh foe (the later television play), Embers is a play of failed connections which uses stone to dehumanize and menace the main protagonist. If these are partly dramas of the mind, then the use of stone underlines the morbidity of the psychic processes presented, a morbidity which tallies with the destructiveness of the Freudian death drive. The disembodiment of Henry's voice, which is intrinsic to the radio medium of Embers, has parallels in such works as Krapp's Last Tape, Not I, and Footfalls. Beckett's later plays increasingly appear as dramas of the mind combining striking stage images with ethereal voices. The 330</page><page sequence="10">SAMUEL BECKETT'S STONE IMAGERY simultaneity of presence and absence, the material and mental reminds us of a much earlier phase of Beckett's career where he drew upon the myth of Echo and Narcissus in his slim 1935 volume Echo's Bones and Other Precipitates. Echo, in Ovid's Metamorphoses, is left as a dematerialized voice whose bones are turned to stone. She is part of that absent presence which these late plays explore. If the body, in Beckett's later plays, is increasingly occluded, the audience is still confronted with such palpable stage images as Mouth in Not I, May's monotonous pacing in Footfalls, or the head of the Listener in That Time. In other words, Beckett's drama still depends on physical presence to gain its effects. If Beckett's characters often construct themselves via a fragmented consciousness then their fragmented bodies also reflect their incompleteness. The repetitive manner in which they enact their fragmented selves reminds us of the fate of Echo who is doomed by Juno only to repeat the last phrase of what she hears and therefore, like May's physical repetition in Footfalls, is condemned to a life of verbal repetition. She is an archetype of the disembodied residua deployed by Beckett in plays which are full of echoes and traces, both verbal and physical, which Ovid's myth illustrates for us. Echo cannot initiate discourse and this question of the origin of the voice and its autonomous agency is foregrounded in these late plays. Most of Beckett's listeners are helpless victims subjected to an alien voice, much like Krapp's experience of his former selves in Krapp's Last Tape or Joe's female conscience in Eh Joe. If memory only echoes back to us our past mistakes, all we can do is experience afresh our own impotence, just as Echo is forced, in her pursuit of Narcissus, to re-experience her own incapacity. Echo fades into a disembodied voice, her bones turning to stone and blending into the landscape. So, in these late plays, stone represents the eventual passing away into immaterial nothingness, such as the fade-out in Footfalls or Rockaby, which finds its mythic parallel in the fate of Echo. But we should not overlook the romantic and all too human elements of a number of these plays. The yearnings of Krapp, the triangular passions of Play, and even the chaste encounters of Voice B in That Time modify the mythic romanticism of Echo's futile passion for Narcissus. The occlusion of the body helps make this mythic parallel possible. Their disembodied passions use the model of Echo and Narcissus as an ethereal counterpoint to the more quotidian, humanly fallible aspects of the body. In mythology, love can be refracted beyond the grave without the more undignified trappings of actual human emotion. Beckett juxtaposes both elements, mythic dignity and human fallibility, and conjoins them in some of these later plays. 331</page><page sequence="11">IRISH UNIVERSITY REVIEW Furthermore, Ovidian metamorphosis also relates to the transubstantial atmosphere of these plays. The stoniness of the sacred acts as a symbol of the change from animate to inanimate, from living organism to inert matter. If the animate and human constitute aspects of these plays, mythic permanence and archetypal transcendence form other elements. Just as Molloy projects his all too human needs into his sucking-stones, so Beckett's characters play out their all too human emotions in a mythical context which lends their human foibles a certain magnitude. This curious juxtaposition may help explain how Beckett's occluded bodies and fragmented voices nonetheless attain a certain impalpable coherence in the theatre even as they enact their disruptive dissolution. His plays may not lead to resolution, transcendence, or harmony, but their cryptic symbolism hints at a mythic plane which is not immediately visible or audible in the theatre. But if Beckett draws on Ovidian myths of petrification, he also uses the opposite process, reanimation and reawakening. The Memnon image is conspicuous here as well as the Pygmalion myth, both of which are described by Ovid in Metamorphoses. In Greek mythology, Memnon is said to have fought in the Trojan War at the behest of his uncle Priam, but was killed by Achilles. His mother Aurora (or Eos in Greek) was grief stricken, pleading recompense from Jove; the Greeks called the statue of Amenophis III at Thebes the Colossus of Memnon which at dawn was said to emit musical murmurs in response to his mother's dewy grief. The Memnon image, then, is one of statuesque permanence and transformative renanimation. Likewise, Pygmalion makes an ivory statue of female perfection which he worships. This is brought to life by Venus, who transforms inanimate beauty into human presence and enables Pygmalion to marry his previously inanimate creation. The Memnon image surfaces in Beckett's prose, notably in Malone Dies where Sapo/Macmann's all-encompassing greatcoat makes him resemble 'the Colossus of Memnon, dearly loved son of Dawn'.38 Likewise, in Fizzle 7: Still, the speaking voice resembles the Colossus of Memnon 'Legs side by side broken right angles at the knees as in that old statue some old god twanged at sunrise and again at sunset'.39 The statuesque calm of the later closed-space texts gives them also an aura of Memnon-like stasis as, for example, 'the rigid Memnon pose' of the woman in III Seen III Said.^0 Another prose variation of the Memnon image can be found in La Falaise or The Cliff (1975) where a skull emerges visually from the cliff face, as a kind of sclerotic apparition which animates the skullscape. Originally written as a tribute to Beckett's artist friend, Bram van Velde, this short prose piece plays with the plane of vision exploring 332</page><page sequence="12">SAMUEL BECKETT'S STONE IMAGERY the problems of subjective perception. But it is the way in which the text is 'enlivened with mortal remains'41 which reminds us of Ovidean parallels. The emergence of a giant skull which then sinks T^ack its coronal into the rock' (p.257) has both the statuesque grandeur of the Colossus of Memnon as well the potential for reanimation which the Memnon image signifies. The overall presentation of the skullscape in La Falaise has been aptly described by Michael Angelo Rodriguez as 'a static representation of flux'.42 There is here a triumphant valorization of the inanimate, an all-engulfing image of death presented in terms of a lifeless lifeforce. However, the most obvious instances of the Memnon image are found in the drama where visual tableaux often have statuesque connotations. In Catastrophe, the political reanimation of the Protagonist as he raises his head and 'fixes'*3 the audience, in defiance of the Director and Assistant, is that of a human statue liberating itself from its calcified repression. The classical catastrophe of the title is the unravelling of the story, the denouement, which here draws on Pygmalion-type transformation, a miraculous reawakening of the subjected body on the 'plinth'44 whose statuesque submission had previously been taken for granted. Beckett's later plays often incorporate moments of epiphanic recognition at their conclusion which resemble the Protagonist's gesture of defiance in Catastrophe. The Reader and Listener of Ohio Impromtu (1981) sit on 'as though turned to stone',45 but there is a hint of 'reawakening' (p.447) as their eyes meet in the closing sequence. Their gaze, as they join hands and look at each other, can be viewed as a potent image of reconciliation and mutual recognition. Even the toothless grin of the Listener at the conclusion of That Time (1976) suggests a moment of heightened awareness in which a static image is reinvigorated at a moment when death seems imminent. The Memnon image is used by Beckett as an archetype, a moment of animation when dissolution and death seem inevitable. In this respect, there is continuity between Malone's manic conclusion in Malone Dies and these later plays where the sense of an ending brings about fleeting, but compelling, instances of vitalism in the face of death, giving extinction that very animation which is its opposite. In one of Beckett's lesser known playlets, Rough for Theatre II,46 another tableau is set up, that of a man C standing at a window ledge apparently contemplating suicide. Characters A and B discuss, in front of this moonlit image, the reasons and circumstances behind C's putative action. Their bureaucratic fussiness contrasts with the uncluttered, Romantic silhouette of C which remains inert and frozen in statuesque clarity throughout the play. As A and B prepare to depart 333</page><page sequence="13">IRISH UNIVERSITY REVIEW they discover a pair of songbirds, 'Finches' or 'lovebirds' (p.248), one of which is dead while the other sings melodiously. Against the pin striped banality of A and B, this sudden discovery seems incongruous. But character A recalls yet another mythical parallel which helps make sense of it, that of 'Philomel!' (p.247) whose cruel treatment at the hands of Tereus is recounted in Ovid's Metamorphoses. The rape of Philomela and the revenge by Procne, her sister, at the court of Thrace, results in a kind of transubstantiation by which, according to Greek myth, Procne is turned into a nightingale and Philomela into a swallow. Once again, liberating movement supplants inarticulate and impotent stasis. There is, perhaps, a vindication here for C's implied actions, which advocates a transubstantial way out of present suffering, much as Philomela wishes death upon herself after Tereus's violation. Beckett's playlet is a dramatic sketch which invokes a certain transcendence, the desire to be freed of the body and of life, and which leans once again on the transformative energies of Ovid's source text. A final mythic parallel related to Beckett's stone imagery is the myth of Sisyphus. Condemned to push a boulder eternally uphill, Sisyphus suffers, according to Albert Camus, 'that unspeakable penalty in which the whole being is exerted towards accomplishing nothing'.47 This is, of course, an apt summary of Beckett's literary outlook and is reflected in the trope of onwardness, his characters' valiant persistence in the face of apparent futility, their determination to 'go on'. The most famous Beckettian line, from The Unnamable, 'you must go on, I can't go on, I'll go on'48 has a Sisyphean eloquence and contains a core value of Beckett's writing. What Beckett calls 'the issueless predicament of existence',49 in an essay on MacGreevy from 1945, resembles the plight of Sisyphus and is enacted repeatedly in Beckett's work. Sisyphean futility is a philosphical bedrock and provides a foundational premise for his writing. III. Ruins and Wasteland Beckett's use of depopulated and dehumanized landscapes and his co option of stone for anti-anthropomorphic purposes is especially prominent in the later prose. The valorization of stony inertia over animate nature remains a consistent theme, a point which is made explicit by the narrator of From an Abandoned Work (1956) whose love of 'things still and rooted' such as 'bushes, boulders and the like' contrasts with his dislike of 'all moving things' found in animate nature.50 But, like much of the Trilogy, From an Abandoned Work is a dynamic prose work propelled by its own narrative energies. It is the lack of movement in the closed-space texts which makes Beckett's 334</page><page sequence="14">SAMUEL BECKETT'S STONE IMAGERY stone analogies all the more pertinent. Stasis and immobility coalesce with a psychological attitude of resigned 'on-going' which takes on sclerotic traits via a range of references to ruins and skullscapes which focus on wastelands of the self. In Lessness (1970) Beckett refers to 'Ruins true refuge'51 while in Fizzle 8: For to end yet again (1976) he evokes 'the ruins of the refuge',52 phrases which echo Lucky's 'abode of stones' and remind us of Beckett's early fostering attitude towards stone. In the later prose, Beckett uses 'the ruins of the refuge' to signify the absence of adequate authorial shelter and to describe whatever residual refuge is still to be found in the patter of articulation. He uses variations on the theme of ruin as metaphors for the creative process as if the writer no longer finds 'refuge' in his art and is reduced to reiterations of an increasingly petrified and desubjectivized self. Beckett's essay 'The Capital of Ruins', about his experiences at Saint Lo, provides an historical analogue to the 'issueless scattered ruins'53 of the late prose. Here, literally, the 'ruins of the refuge', signal outright military destruction, and the dire need of the inhabitants of this Normandy town to find refuge amidst the ruins. Such devastation led Beckett to enunciate what he calls the 'time-honoured conception of humanity in ruins' in his essay and to see, in the solidarity of the relief effort, the themes of affinity, mutual recognition, and collective suffering.54 The 'ruinstrewn land'55 of the later prose seems hermetic and solipsistic, yet it has this objective correlative of Saint-L6 as an historical counterpoint. Beckett's use of ruins in That Time also has a personal context.56 The 'crumbling' (p.391) masonry of this play suggests the general ruin of selfhood through the nebulous subjectivities of particular personae, A, B, and C, whose memories are linked by allusions to stone. Voice A alludes several times to 'Foley's Folly' (p.389), a ruined tower associated with Beckett's childhood57 and again, the ruin as refuge appears as a motif, a place of solitude 'where none ever came' (p.389), the kind of solace Beckett often sought as a young man in Dublin. In the post-war Novellas, the themes of refuge and shelter are almost obsessive. In The Calmative, the narrator 'can't tell between dens and ruins',58 a confusion which highlights the contrast between the ruin which serves as a refuge and the complete absence of shelter in the ruined refuge. Beckettian ruins do resemble dens of the self, residual fortresses constantly threatened with submergence into 'the surrounding whiteness'59 of oblivion and silence. On the one hand, we recognize the 'friendly stone'60 of benevolent refuge characteristic of That Time, while on the other we encounter an insidious whiteness 335</page><page sequence="15">IRISH UNIVERSITY REVIEW which signifies the ruin even of vestigial refuge where the landscape is inhospitable and barren. The increasingly 'Universal stone'61 of Beckett's closed-space texts is taken up in III Seen III Said (1981), a work which enacts a kind of creeping paralysis or sclerotic transformation: White stones more plentiful every year. As well say every instant ... Of striking effect in the light of the moon these millions of little sepulchres ... Everywhere stone is gaining. Whiteness. More and more every year.62 Phil Baker has referred to the 'malignant sterility' of the stone imagery in III Seen III Said and he sees the old woman as the 'apotheosis' of Beckett's 'dark female figures of reified loneliness, mourning, sterility and death'.63 Certainly, /// Seen III Said partakes of the effacement and erasure which are increasing preoccupations of the late prose. However, in a work of such intricate verbal patterning, the invocation of a 'zone of stones'64 also evokes a religious and ritualistic atmosphere which differentiates it from other Beckettian 'ruinstrewn' vistas which are more manifestly barren. Here, ruin acts as a symbolic or spiritual reference point which counterbalances the sterility. Stones may 'increasingly abound'65 around the woman's cabin, but this 'zone of stones' has some special significance, like the stage-centre in Quad. The woman seems to haunt the threshold of 'this world'66 and the next; she 'slowly glides' like a 'living shadow ... fading more and more. But never quite away'.67 The spectral and otherworldly atmosphere overlaps with what Enoch Brater calls the 'Celtic or Druidic' function of monumental stone thus reminding us of Mircea Eliade's comments on the ritualistic importance of stone in ancient cultures. Myth and ritual are invoked by a dolmen-like stone to which the woman returns: She is drawn to a certain spot. At times. There stands a stone ... Rounded rectangular block three times as high as wide ... the stone draws then to her feet the prayer, Take her ... There she too as if of stone.68 This passage reads like an inverted fertility rite, a search for spiritual sustenance amidst a sterile stoniness. There is an echo of the Biblical 'stony rubbish' alluded to in T.S. Eliot's The Waste Land.69 In Eliot's poem, stone also embraces the dual function of debris or wasteland and is also the focus of ritual and belief. Beckett's haunting prose points towards shards of belief, rather than living faith, by means of echoes, repetitions, and ghostly absences. 336</page><page sequence="16">SAMUEL BECKETT'S STONE IMAGERY The 'kindly dark'70 and 'friendly stone'71 of the later prose equate with the desire, expressed in Stirrings Still, 'all to end'72 which resonantly expresses a resigned acceptance of death and mortality. Mineral and inorganic images inhabit Beckett's imagination here as a 'Black basalt'73 analogue to his preoccupation with death. A certain affective flattening helps maintain the even register of desolate onwardness which the stone imagery endorses. If these later prose texts read as variations in the skullscape, the stone imagery participates in these variations in precise ways as, for example, the 'Granite of no common variety assuredly'74 of III Seen III Said, in which colour is carefully noted, 'Black as jade the jasper that flecks its whiteness' (p.75). There is an atmosphere of liminality articulated through this mineral chiaroscuro. 'Adamantine blackness'75 and 'surrounding whiteness'76 are played off against one another to evoke a luminous darkness on the threshold of death. In Beckett's hands, the very inexpressive qualities of stone become expressive. He exploits the no man's land between life and death in which the conventional opposition between animate and inanimate is broken down. In its very permanence, stone helps convey the resolute onwardness of Beckett's characters. He uses the sacred connotations of stone when it suits his purpose but he also depicts it as mere debris and rubble. Stone has a versatility in Beckett's work which makes it a building block for some of his most memorable compositions. Stones participate in the reification of objects, from bicycles to hats to pencils, which act like motifs from early to late works. But perhaps most resoundingly, stones participate in the very obstinacy and recalcitrance of Beckett's people by just existing palpably and immovably in a given environment. Stones just are, in a given time and place. Like the tramps in Godot, they do not move, but rather live on, ever the same. NOTES 1.
