Cathy Gelbin has produced a fascinating study charting the origins and trans- formations of the cultural construct of the ‘golem’, the mythical anthropomorphic man of clay made living by supernatural means, and ultimately figuring as a ‘sort of friendly Jewish Frankenstein’ (p. ) on the landscape of European cultural history. If the etymology of the word dates back to the Psalms, then the best-known modern golem narratives emerged from sixteenth-century Prague, where they were associated with the figure of Rabbi Yehuda ben Bezalel Löw. Gelbin recognizes that the golem has traditionally been, and is oen still seen as a specific kind of Jewish literary Shibboleth, but she traces how the golem was transplanted into and transformed by European (German) Christian cultures, indeed existed as a kind of complex intercultural dialogue across both traditions. us the study seeks to avoid the trap of presenting the trope as a thing solely ‘owned’ by its culture of origin and subsequently transformed as it passed across essentialized cultural groupings. e book is divided into seven chapters. Following an introduction, which sets out the longer-standing history of the golem, as well as the study’s aims and objectives, the first chapter contextualizes the discussion by focusing on the German post-Enlightenment discourses of Herder and the brothers Grimm, both of whom sought to define cultures as geographically, linguistically, and nationally discrete units. In this context, Jacob Grimm’s publication of a Polish golem story in  is shown to have spawned a host of literary variations by Christian German authors, who hijacked and used the trope to assert a ‘corrupt Jewish essence and culture’ (p. ): in Achim von Arnim’s Isabelle von Ägypten () the partly Orientalized backdrop of early modern Spain is a space traversed by, among others, ‘wandering Jews’, the golem figuring perfidious Jewishness in what is, for Arnim, a dangerously hybrid space (p. ). Chapter  focuses in on the Prague tradition of golem narratives largely centred upon Rabbi Löw. ese narratives become, for Gelbin, ‘evidence of a Jewish counter-discourse to the Christian Romantic accusation of flawed Jewish creativity’ (p. ), which sought to repossess the golem and use it to respond to negatively Orientalized instances of the trope: here Jewish golem-makers become Enlightened men of science, rather than medieval sorcerers. e third chapter shows how, aer , the golem became connected with a ghettoized Jewish identity. In this context, Gelbin demonstrates how German– Jewish scholars sought to discern Jewish folk traditions that were both specific to particular groupings and expressive of an emergent transnational Jewish identity: ironically enough, it is through a complex critical dialogue with and refocusing of the Herderian tradition of defining cultural specificity that scholars such as Richard Andree used golem narratives to map out Jewish cultural diversity (p. ). e remaining chapters cross into the twentieth century, the fourth charting how German Jewish and Yiddish narratives, such as Artur Holitscher’s Der Golem </page> <page sequence="2">  Reviews (), offer more complex masculine alternatives to the patriarchal Zionist ‘Muscle Jew’, only to lapse into stereotypes of Jewish women as femmes fatales (pp. –). With the fih chapter charting how non-Jewish writers such as Gustav Meyrink and Paul Wegener added golem narratives to the tradition, and the sixth examining golem configurations within post-Holocaust poetry, which ‘drew out the ambivalence and instability of the golem figure to convey the violent destruction of the Jewish dialogue with German culture’ (p. ), the study concludes with a snapshot of the golem in the literature of a globalized world. Here, the golem serves to articulate a more ‘fluid’ sense of Jewishness, both within a generation of Jewish writers increasingly looking beyond racialized delineations and topoi of the past, and in the works of non-Jewish writers—Gelbin’s study begins, appropriately enough, to break down such distinctions at its culmination. is is a compelling book with a readable, chronologically linear structure, providing a history of the golem that shows cumulative sophistication across the chapters. Looking beyond the simple binary of malevolent Christian German discourses existing in opposition to laudable Jewish traditions, the study also examines Jewish discourse critically—for instance from the thematic perspective of gender and sexuality. It also charts the more progressive contributions to the tradition, however indirect, made by non-Jewish writers from Goethe to the present day. Of course, the study will not satisfy all readers. ose seeking exhaustive literary analyses of all texts alluded to may be disappointed on occasion: while certain analyses unfold over several pages, others might be seen as anecdotal. Arguably, though, this process of amplification and abbreviation is appropriate to a study that is intended to be critical rather than encyclopedic, and to cover vast historical terrain in the process. Besides writing a lucid and engaging prose, Gelbin’s greatest achievement here is perhaps to follow the golem’s path—so oen seen as a most Jewish tradition—in a manner that enriches our knowledge of Jewish cultural history, critically complicates Jewish identity, and reminds the reader of how a people and a culture historically seen as so disconnected from other European traditions are in fact so richly interwoven with it.

Prior to the twentieth century, the vampire was principally a denizen of Bri- tish Gothic literature. However, the rise of the screen brought this figure wider notoriety. In the wake of early German film-maker Friedrich Murnau’s Nosferatu, vampires have proliferated in Hammer Horror andHollywood films, although other national cinemas—not least New German Cinema with its iconic figures Werner Herzog and Klaus Kinsky—have made their own lasting contributions to the theme. Despite the strong evidence of intertextual links between these literary and film renditions of the vampire, there exists to date no joined-up study of this figure’s </page> </plain_text>
