<plain_text><page sequence="1">Archaeology in Asia Minor MACHTELD J. MELLINK (Pls. 59-62) The reports given here for the excavations and study seasons of 1979 are but a brief abstract of lively activities. A weeklong symposium of Ana- tolian excavators was held in Ankara in February 1980 to consider the outcome of campaigns con- ducted in 1979. The proceedings are expected to appear in print soon. The map reproduced here from the program shows both the large number of enterprises and the geographical clustering of ex- cavation sites, which has its reasons. The West is strongly represented because of the traditional classical interest, but with an increasing concern for the Bronze Age and earlier stages of settlement. Prehistoric developments will be stud- ied at Klazomenai, W of Bayrakll-Old Smyrna, both coastal stations active in the Troy I era and also in the period of Troy VI and Mycenaean en- terprise. Inland, the studies of Demirci Hiiyiik, the mound at Aphrodisias and sites around Elmall are contributing to our understanding of relation- ships with Europe and the Anatolian plateau in the fourth and third millennia B.C. The new exca- vation at Kurugay (between Burdur and Hacllar) promises to provide clues to stratigraphic and chronological correlations. The Minoan-Mycenaean activities on the west coast are gradually coming to light from the wa- terlogged levels of Miletus, lasos and perhaps also Knidos. Klazomenai should add stratified evidence soon. Along the south coast, our knowledge of trade connections is still in the wishful stage, al- though glyptic studies suggest that excavations can narrow the gap between the Konya-Aksaray area (Karahiiyiik, Acemhiiyiik) and Crete. For the first millennium B.C., the wealth of Athena sanctuaries is emerging at Old Smyrna and Erythrai; we also are learning about artistic and technical exchanges with Greece in the potters' workshops of Ionia, Lydia, Caria and Pisidia. A symposium on the technical study of archaic East Greek pottery was held at the French Institute in Istanbul in October 1979. The North of Anatolia is still only sparsely known, although the importance of the Pontic zone, its European connections in the NW and its metallurgical wealth in the NE are evident from excavations at Ikiztepe and Masat. The Bulgarian discoveries of the cemetery at Varna call for Ana- tolian response and coordination. Research in Central Anatolia continues to center on the Hittite problem at the historical sites of Bo- gazk6y-Hattusha, Kiiltepe-Kanesh, Acemhiiyiik- Burushanda? and Konya Karahiiyiik. Much of the present study is concerned with the transition from Early Bronze to early Hittite and the period of the early trade archives. At Bogazki6y, the shape of the city and its fortifications is under renewed study. Large sections of the lower city are now known, and a beginning is being made with the substance of the upper city in the area of Temples IV and III. Conservation and repairs of buildings and for- tifications are restoring Hattusha to some of its for- mer architectural grandeur. The new salvage operations along the Euphrates from Malatya to Samsat will be a concerted effort to rescue as much as possible of the stratified his- tory and culture of some ten millennia of settled life (villages, towns, cemeteries, caravan stations, river crossings, fortresses; economic and technical development, war and peace, ecology, archives, in- scriptions, art and architecture) along the greatest river of E Anatolia. A valiant start has been made at some of the largest mounds (Samsat, Lidar). Logistical ingenuity is faced with superhuman tasks in most lands along the Mesopotamian rivers. Modern technology takes little account of history, and the crash programs will need a maximum of coordination, joint planning and exchange of infor- mation and experts. The Keban Project was a good rehearsal for the next stage of effort. One hopes that an intensive international field seminar will be conducted for the next five or more years along the banks of the Turkish Euphrates.

A study campaign was conducted in 1979 by Professors Halet 9ambel and Robert J. Braidwood, during which the architecture of the early levels (radiocarbon dates 7350-6850 uncali- brated) received special attention. A house model of unbaked clay aids in interpreting the remains.

See below under Euphrates Area for aceramic material from Cafer and Chalcolithic from Hassek and Degirmentepe. Lake Van district. Dr. Oktay Belli discusses the paintings in caves near Yedisalklm, 76 km. SE of Van. In Kizlarin Magarasi a series of 30-35 figures painted in red on limestone can be identified as human, among them are obese females; there also are wild goats and stags. A second cave contains 6o figures, among them obese female figures with raised arms. The dates proposed vary from Upper Palaeolithic to Neolithic and later. Arkeoloji ve Sanat 1979:i-2, pp. 19-27; Turkish Treasures 1978:2, 28-31. Burdur-Kurufay. Dr. Refik Duru reports briefly on his 1978 season in Arkeoloji ve Sanat 1979:1-2, 35. The excavations of 1979 have descended through three EB I-II levels and four Chalcolithic strata. The Chalcolithic houses have fixed hearths and ovens. They are built of mudbrick on stone foundations. The pottery is dark burnished, hand- made ware in the shape of cups, mugs, pitchers, storage jars with affinities to the Bagbasl ware of the Elmahl plain. Among earlier wares is a sherd with a relief design of a woman with raised arms. A discussion of Kurugay and other mounds in the Burdur area by Mehmet Ozsait appears in VIII.- TTKongresi ioi-io6. Elmali area. Christine Eslick in AJA 84 (1980) 5-14 proposes to fit some of the Chalcolithic pottery from Elmall into a phase between Hacilar and Beycesultan. The Kurugay excavations should shed light on this matter. BRONZE AGE SITES Kiiltepe. Prof. Tahsin Ozgii reports that of the palace in the central, inner citadel, only a small part remains unexcavated. This is a palace with an outer courtyard, like that of Acemh6yiik. In the clearance of rooms in 1979, some bullae were found in the level with pottery of Karum Ib type. Further excavations in the Karum added a number of houses with tablets and characteristic artifacts, in- cluding pottery rhyta of new types and metal tools. The typical houses are small autonomous establish- ments with their own workshops (in which weights are found). Some units which lack domes- tic features such as hearths and kitchens are inter- preted as shops. The layout of the town on the mound and the Karum, its traffic patterns and thoroughfares are becoming clear. A burnt house of level II was found at a distance of 500 m. S of the center of the Karum. The population of the entire town, which measures over 2 km. in diame- ter, may be estimated at 20-30,000. A small guide published by the Ankara Mu- seum, Tahsin Ozgii?, Die Hethiter (1979), has many illustrations of Kiiltepe buildings and ob- jects. In Mdlanges Laroche 291-96, Tahsin OzgiiC publishes a steatite mould from Kiiltepe with a bearded god as master of animals, in Belleten 170 (1979) 261-72, an anthropomorphic vessel from a grave of Karum level Ia. Bogazkioy. Dr. Peter Neve reports: "In the upper city, area K-L/7, large Hittite buildings of the i3th century B.C. can be recognized. Temple VI (partly dug in 1978) was completely excavated, measuring 31 x 39 m., with 54 rooms built on two levels. The N wing preserves 29 basement rooms. The central courtyard, special entrance, adyton and other fea- tures resemble details of temples I-IV; the plan dif- fers in its unbroken rectangular outer contours. To the E lies a residential district which yielded kilns</page><page sequence="4">504 MACHTELD J. MELLINK [AJA 84 and evidence of metal working and other indus- tries. In the area of the Sphinx Gate (Yerkapl) much excavation and reconstruction took place. The city wall, exterior wall, towers and glacis were cleared and investigated; the W staircase of Yer- kapi and the adjoining glacis were completely ex- cavated. Three construction phases appeared: i. (earliest) the postern, embankment, main fortifica- tion wall and entrance, W staircase, paved glacis; 2. modification of the staircase; 3. building of the outer wall with towers; changes in entrance, W staircase and paved slope. Towers 21-22 of the main wall and I-III of the outer wall were restored in 1979, largely with the aid of fallen original materials." R.M. Boehmer in Die Kleinfunde aus der Un- terstadt von Bogazky (Berlin 1979, Bogazxky- Hattusa X) publishes the objects from the excava- tions of 1970-1978 in the area of the lower city N and NW of temple I.P. Neve, IstMitt 27-28 (i977- 1978) 61-72 discusses the occurrence of Schalen- steine (rocks and stones with shallow cup-shaped depressions) at Bogazk6y. The campaign of 1978 is reported upon in AA 1979, 131-45. A study of Hittite vessel names is the monograph by Yasar Coskun, Bogazk6y Metinlerde gefen bazz seeme kap isimleri (Ankara University 1979). Alaca Hiiyiik. Excavations by architect Mahmut Akok continue E of the postern gate area, where a burnt Old Hittite building was cleared. W of the Sphinx Gate several Hittite levels were studied in XL-XLII/58-64. Among the finds in 1979 was a four-sided Hittite seal with designs of gods, stags, and hieroglyphic symbols. Eskiyapar. Director Raci Temizer reports that the large Hittite Empire building in the NE part of the mound was extended, but part of the build- ing still underlies Roman and Phrygian levels. The pottery of the upper levels continues to be abun- dant. The EB level has evidence of good metal work. Three pithos tombs have been found in this level. The Phrygian era of Eskiyapar is discussed by Inci Bayburtluoglu, VIII.TTKongresi, 293-303, Galatian ware by Levent Zoroglu, pp. 345-54. Masat. Prof. Tahsin OzgiiS reports that the exca- vation of the palace of level III (c. 1400 B.C.) has now been completed, cf. AJA 84 (1980) 305-309. In the S and SW part of the palace and citadel bedrock is very high, and level III is accordingly disturbed, but a series of rooms must have flanked the S side of the court. In the courtyard, a drainage channel built of stone and averaging 1.25-i.50 m. in height was found, similar to drains at Bogazk6y and Alaca. The palace of level III was built in one operation. After its destruction by fire, palace II was built on top of its ruins, presumably during the rule of Shuppiluliuma I. The excavations of the lower town of Masat have now revealed four building levels of private houses. The lower levels have houses and tombs characteristic of Karum Kanesh Ib, with typical pottery, stamp seals, metal tools and weapons. The upper two levels cerami- cally are transitional between Karum Ib and level III of the citadel of Masat; the material of this phase is not preserved on the citadel proper. Prof. Ozgii notes that many Hittite citadels and sites exist in the densely settled region of Amasya- Tokat. The tablets from Masat contain references to many local placenames, cf. Sedat Alp in Belleten 164 (1977) 637-47; Melanges Laroche 29-35. The EB material from Masat is studied by Kutlu Emre in Belleten 169 (1979) 1-48. Remnants of houses are found on the citadel, with intramural pithos bur- ials. The EB level ends in conflagration. Ikiztepe. Prof. U. Bahadir Alkim reports that in 1979 work concentrated on Ikiztepe I, a mound ris- ing nearly 30 m. above the plain. The strata de- scend from Early Hittite to EB III. Timber houses are characteristic of all levels. The Early Hittite pottery is wheelmade, that of EB III partly still handmade. Among metal finds are bronze chisels, pins, and a lugged flat celt. A large number of tombs have now been excavated. These are grouped in cemeteries. The burials are extended inhuma- tions of varying orientation. They date to Early Hittite and EB III. Among the tomb gifts are bronze rings, earrings, bracelets and spearheads with bent tangs but unpierced blades. Inandik. The relief vase from the temple at Inan- dik is illustrated in Raci Temizer, Museum of Anatolian Civilizations (Ankara 1979, Akbank) 37. The identification of the site as the Hittite cult city of Hanhana was explained by Sedat Alp in Belle- ten 164 (i977) 649-52 and in Festschrift Elmar Edel (1980) I3-16. Acemhiiyii. Prof. Nimet Ozgiig reports that during cleaning and consolidation of the burnt pal- ace of Sarlkaya observations on construction tech-</page><page sequence="5">1980] ARCHAEOLOGY IN ASIA MINOR 505 niques continue to yield precise evidence, e.g. on the use of longitudinal and transverse beams in corners. In the bulla room, clear traces were found of red paint on the walls, later covered by a layer of plaster now burnt to a green glazed surface. In one of the pithos rooms, quantity marks were found incised as simple strokes on the rims of pithoi. Mending of the pithoi is in progress. In the trench between Sarikaya and Hatipler, remnants of a large burnt building came to light, made largely of timber with little use of mudbrick. The area was disturbed by buildings of Hellenistic date. The trench on the S side of the mound yielded a series of stratified mudbrick houses with fixed hearths. The end of the EB Age is characterized by pottery of so-called "intermediate" type; Alisar III ware does not appear. The bathtub from Sarikaya with painted designs representing a multi-storied building with stairs and balconies is now published in Belleten 170 (I979) 289-304; the article also con- tains a plan of Sarikaya and new seal impressions found in 1978. Aliye Ozten publishes a stone bowl on ring-stand and an obsidian bowl from the Sari- kaya palace in Belleten 170 (I979) 381-88. Anatolian Glyptic. Nimet Ozgii in Melanges Laroche 277-84 deals with the iconography of gods and goddesses on Anatolian seals of the Old As- syrian period from Kiiltepe and Acemhiiyiik. Rob- ert L. Alexander in Belleten 171 (I979) 573-618 studies cylinder seal engravers active in the Karum II period of Kanesh. Edibe Uzuno'lu in IstMitt 29 (I979) 65-75 publishes a pithos fragment from SE Anatolia with impressions of a Hittite cylinder seal of much iconographic importance (king libating in front of weather god, tree, god with sword, vic- tim or worshipper). Karahiiyiik-Konya. In 1978-79, Prof. Sedat Alp expanded trench T on the W side of the large city mound. The houses of the upper level are well pre- served. A large horseshoe-shaped hearth with im.- pressions of circle designs is of the type known in smaller versions from Kusura. There are indica- tions of destruction by earthquake. Some mud- brick walls have tumbled; one wall had fallen on a man and an animal whose skeletons were found under the debris. Beykay. Mrs. Hatice Gonnet has begun an inves- tigation at the site and mound of Beyk6y in Phryg- ia, near Ihsaniye N of Afyon, where in 1884 W.M. Ramsay had found a block with a Hittite Hieroglyphic inscription. This block is lost at pres- 'ent. H. Gonnet noticed pottery of the Chalcolithic, LB and Phrygian periods. Investigation of the rocky spurs around Beyk6y revealed rockcut tombs of Phrygian and Byzantine types; on Yumru tepe, reused rockcut tombs, sculptured panels, niches and "thrones." Several nearby sites were explored and new examples of stepped altars and rockcut "thrones" were recorded. The latter will be investi- gated, as will be the second millennium occupation of the mounds at Beyk6y, Malatga, Ablak and Sipsin. Aphrodisias. The computer analysis of the pre- historic pottery of Aphrodisias is discussed by Mar- tha Joukowsky in JFA 5 (1978) 431-42. Study and analysis of the Neolithic and Chalcolithic pottery, chipped stone, obsidian, metal, shell and grains are in progress. Demirci Hiiyiik. Dr. Manfred Korfmann and his team have arranged an exhibition of the princi- pal finds in the museum of Eskisehir. Detailed study of artifacts and materials continues. See Ist- Mitt 29 (i979) 9-64 for the preliminary report of the seasons 1976-1977; the 1975 report appeared in IstMitt 27-28 (1977-1978) 1-59. M. Korfmann pub- lished a study of a special type of female clay fig- urine which is found at Demirci Hiiyilk in levels L-K, with parallels in idols and vessels from other W Anatolian sites, PZ 54 (I979) 187-200; see also Onder Bilgi in JFK 6 (1978) 133-44- Troy. Geological observations by John C. Kraft, Ilhan Kayan and Oguz Erol suggest that the mound at Hissarlik was surrounded by sea on three sides in ca. 4500-5000 Y.B.P.; "probably the sites of Troy I-VII were the loci of maritime pow- ers on a hill in a marine embayment adjacent to the Hellespont"; see AJA 84 (i980) 218. For a discussion of cities and sites in the Troad, see Askidil Akarca in Belleten 165 (i978) 1-52. The chronology of Troy in the EB Age is reviewed by Christian Podzuweit, Trojanische Gefidssformen der Friihbronzezeit in Anatolien, der fgiiis und angrenzenden Gebieten (Mainz i979) (see review infra pp. 535-37), also by Jak Yakar in AnatSt 29 (I979) 51-67.

MELLINK [AJA 84 Malatya-Arslantepe. The excavation and study of the prehistoric levels by Dr. Alba Palmieri have yielded particularly important results for the late fourth and early third millennia B.C. The temple complex in the SW part of the mound was burnt in an early stage of EB I and not rebuilt. A Trans- caucasian intrusion is noticeable in the next phase. The main find groups, apart from the pottery, are ca. 2oo bullae with seal impressions and a hoard of 22 arsenical bronzes, some with silver inlay, found in a bundle: swords, spearheads, a double-spiral buckle. Gedikli. A survey of the pottery from the site of Gedikli near Islahiye, excavated in 1964-1967, is published by Handan Alkim in VIII.TTKongresi, 135-42. This includes important material from the EB III cremation cemetery. EUPHRATES AREA. SALVAGE EXCAVATIONS. In the areas of the new dams to be built in the Euphrates valley excavations have begun in 1978- 79. The mounds are listed here in geographical groups: the S group in the zone of Samsat-Adiya- man and the N group in the Malatya zone. The sites were all surveyed in 1977 by a team under Dr. Mehmet Ozdogan. The numbers of the sites given here correspond to the grid and numbers in his book Lower Euphrates Basin 1977 Survey (METU Lower Euphrates Project Publications, Series I, No. 2; Istanbul 1977). For general remarks on the project see H. Metzger, RA 1979:1, 178-81. Several additional projects are about to be under- taken. Samsat. T51/I4. (Prof. Nimet Ozgiiq). This enormous mound of ca. 50 m. visible height on the W bank of the Euphrates has now been tested in two campaigns. A series of trenches has been taken down some 12 m. to a habitation level of the Seljuk period, with excellent evidence for architecture, pottery, metallurgy and coins. In the castle on top of the mound thousands of iron arrowheads and iron ingots came to light. Lidar. T51/40o. (Prof. Harald Hauptmann). On the E bank of the Euphrates, ca. 9 km. upstream from Samsat. A prehistoric mound of ca. 25 m. height, refounded as Seleucia. A long series of cuts was made E-W across the mound. The plan of the medieval settlement became clear in the upper level, which also had a fortification wall of mud- brick on a stone base. The prehistoric layers are not evenly covered by the Hellenistic and later deposits. Horiskay. T52/I5. (Prof. Baki Oiin). On a rocky spur W of the Euphrates stands a castle which served from the Iron Age to late medieval times. The late constructions are of good ashlar masonry. A tunnel connects the fort with a cave near the river. Tille. S52/II. (Dr. David H. French). On the W bank of the river at the road crossing from Adlyaman-Kahta to Siverek-Diyarbakir. A mound ca. 26 m. high, with occupation from prehistoric to modern times. A Roman building on the S side of the mound is a bath of the first and second centu- ries A.C.; tilestamps prove that Tille was a fort of the Ala Flavia Agrippiana. Hassek. S52/18. (Prof. B. Hrouda, Dr. G. Behm- Blancke). A small low mound across the river from Tille. Largely Chalcolithic deposits; five levels were identified. A large building with stone foun- dations had pottery of Amuq G-H type; earlier lev- els descend to the Amuq E phase. Obsidian is rare, flint is worked locally. Among the animal bones porcus was prominent. Cafer. P51/I2. (J. Cauvin, O. Aurenche). A low mound truncated and levelled by cultivation, with deposits of EB and Aceramic Neolithic. In the aceramic phase a thick wall was made of layers of riverstones and clay mortar. Grinding stones, hearths, obsidian and (in smaller number) flint tools belong to this level. The most diagnostic ob- sidian tool is a sickle-blade retouched bilaterally between plain ends. There are clear affinities to the tools of 9ayonui. K6sker. P5I/I7. (Dr. Onder Bilgi). Small mound on a natural rise SE of the Euphrates railway bridge ca. 25 km. NE of Malatya. A trench in the center of the mound established Ottoman, Roman, Urartian (storeroom with pithoi) and EB III levels (painted pottery of Malatya type). Deirmen Tepe. P50/7. (Prof. Ufuk Esin). A mound in the S floodplain of the Euphrates ca. 15 km. NE of Malatya. The deposits of ca. 8 m. depth are largely Chalcolithic. Good architecture of rec- tangular houses standing side by side came to light, with traces of painted wall plaster. The pottery is of regional Ubaid type, with painted and flint- scraped bowls accompanied by red and dark bur- nished wares.</page><page sequence="7">1980] ARCHAEOLOGY IN ASIA MINOR 507 Kalekoy. P51i/7. (Dr. Tomris Bakir). A fortress with rockcut tunnel on the E bank of the Euphra- tes ca. 30 km. N of Malatya. A Byzantine cistern exists on top of the citadel. The cliff has many rockcut niches. Semsiyetepe. 050/Io. (Prof. Muhibbe Darga). A small mound ca. 5 km. S of Kalek6y. Keban area. The publications of the first salvage project continue with the volume Keban Project 1973 Activities (Ankara 1979, METU Keban Proj- ect Publications I, 6). A complete report for the excavations at Degirmentepe, a small mound prin- cipally of the EB Age 22 km.

Prentiss S. de Jesus, AnatSt 28 (I978) 97-102, gives a critical analysis of the location of metal resources in ancient Anatolia. MINOAN AND MYCENAEAN SITES Minoan affinities of Anatolian glyptic. Similari- ties between Crete and Anatolia in the use of seal- ings to protect or mark stored and shipped goods, and in the patterns used to decorate the stamp seals have been noted and commented on in various contexts, cf. F. Matz in Die kretisch-mykenische Glyptik und ihre gegenwdrtigen Probleme (Bop- pard 1974) 58-95, with reference to Karahiiyilk- Konya; Nimet Ozgii, Belleten 162 (i977) 357-81 and the forthcoming Ancient Art in Seals, ed. by Edith Porada (Princeton 1980), with reference to Acemhiiyiik. The affinities are beginning to be seen not just as a matter of abstract ornament or ornamental syntax but also in representation. The sealings from Acemhiiyiik are particularly sugges- tive of iconographic contact in the renderings of seated goddesses accompanied by various attributes including trees, birds, goats, streams of water. A scene of worship of a bearded god has a boat with mast and stays in the exergue, presumably a sea- going ship of some affinity to glyptic renderings of Middle Minoan ships (Nimet Ozgfii, Belleten 162 [I977] pl. I2 No. 29; Melanges Laroche 277-84, fig. 8). See also Sedat Alp, Zylinder- und Stempelsie- gel aus Karahiiyiik bei Konya (Ankara 1968) 160, No. 7, for comments on the Karahiiyiik material. Minoan and Mycenaean trade and settlement. Christopher Mee in AnatSt 28 (I978) 121-56 cata- logues Anatolian sites that have yielded Minoan and Mycenaean or allegedly Minoan and Myce- naean pottery, and analyzes the evidence, with ex- tensive bibliography. It remains probable that large amounts of Myce- naean (and Minoan) material remain well buried in coastal sites of the type of lasos and Miletus, which saw such extensive building operations in classical times. The prolific surface material of the LH IIIC period on some Cilician mounds is due to the lack of classical overlay, e.g. at Kazanli Hiiyiik which yields large and numerous frag- ments of LH IIIC pottery. Klazomenai. The mound of Liman Tepe on the shore between the iskele (scala) of Urla and the island (see G.E. Bean, Aegean Turkey [London 1966] 135) is the site of a new excavation by a team under Director (etin Anlagan, assisted by Dr. Gilven Bakir. In the 1921 excavations of G.P. Oiko- nomos, Mycenaean sherds had allegedly been col- lected here (now in the National Museum at Ath- ens, see AnatSt 28 [1978] 125 for bibliography). The doubts about their provenance have been dis- pelled by the new investigations which yielded Mycenaean wares largely of LH IIIA date. The mound has been reshaped and reterraced by the owner of the konak now standing on top. It orig- inally extended W to the quay. The earliest mate- rials may be under the level of the modern water- table. There is evidence of occupation from the Troy I period, not yet for Troy II-V, but clearly for Troy VI and the Mycenaean period.

The upper Iron Age levels at Masat have yielded an abundance of pottery of the 6th and 5th centuries B.C. in a Pontic regional style. Among the decorative motifs are hybrid monsters, stags, deer, horses and figures of goddesses with animals. This material is unlike that from Bogazk6y, whereas the earlier levels at Masat yield IA pottery of Alisar type; the latter style degenerates grad- ually. Eskiyapar.

He endorses the identification Azatiwa- tas - Sanduarri, the king of Kundu and Sissu executed by Esarhaddon in 676 B.C. This identifica- tion was proposed incidentally by Irene J. Winter in her study of the Karatepe reliefs, AnatSt 29 (I979) II5-5I, n. 138. The main thrust of her study is to explain the two styles of Karatepe sculptures by a reuse of 9th century orthostats from (burnt and abandoned) Domuztepe, supplemented by later work. On the basis of historical, topographical and archaeological data Miss Winter rejects a 9th century date for the construction of Karatepe and tends to opt for a date late in the reign of Sargon for the building, and 677 for the destruction of the fortress (by Esarhaddon).

Excavations under the direction of Prof. Jale Inan are concentrating on the N end of the colonnaded street, on the street N of the agora ("Tacitus Street"), and the nymphaeum and pa- laestra SW of the Hellenistic S gate. This area was particularly productive of sculpture in 1978-79. A Roman copy of a 5th century Diomedes appeared in 1978; in 1979 the finds included a small Hermes (?) with a pillar decorated with a relief of Arte- mis, a splendid 2.46 m. high cuirass statue of Trajan with Dacia; a second incomplete cuirass statue, perhaps Hadrian. These and other sculp- tures have been taken to the Antalya Museum and restored. The statue of Hermes tying his sandal, found in 1977, is published in Belleten 170 (1979) 397-43.? Seleucia.

LYCIA Xanthos-Letoon. In 1979 the work continued un- der the supervision of Christian le Roy, who re- ports: "Building E, the smallest building on the temple terrace, was cleared of the tumbled blocks of the Leto temple. The center of building E turned out to be a core of natural rock patched with large limestone boulders quarried from the neighboring hill (pl. 59, fig. i). This core was en- closed by finer limestone blocks, cut and fit to pre- cision. There was no colonnade, except perhaps in front. The structure may be a monumental altar rather than a temple of Artemis, as assumed first on the basis of a dedication found near its SE cor- ner. The Hellenistic sacred way which leads from the W to the ramp giving access to the Leto temple was cleared over an 8 x 20 m. area. It was remod- elled when the Hadrianic nymphaeum was built. Over 50 inscriptions (mostly of the second century A.C.) were found in the debris on the paving, largely of administrative nature and with special reference to the family of the Veranii. In the An- talya Museum, J. Marcadd studied over i500 mar- ble fragments and slivers of statuary found in the N sector of the Letoon, burnt and reused in a Ro- man wall. Several statues were recomposed. Three are draped female figures, the largest (2.57 tn.) per- haps a queen; two are of Pudicitia type (pl. 6o, fig. 6); two are male statues. A new sounding in the Letoon added some 300 new fragments to the collection. Lycian sculpture of the late Hellenistic period had previously not been well represented. "The lower Xanthos valley was studied by a team of geomorphologists to investigate the ancient sea and land levels and to locate the quarries used for the Letoon and Xanthos." Xanthos.

The site is near Yata3an in the modern village of Eskihisar, see G.E. Bean, Turkey beyond the Maeander (London 1971) 88- 93. Founded in the early 3rd century by Antiochus, it had predecessors at the site. "Excavations were concerned with the main city-gate at the N side;</page><page sequence="11">1980] ARCHAEOLOGY IN ASIA MINOR 511 this gate is vaulted and has a colonnade to the S. There were two doorways, the E one now visible in foundations only. Between the doors was a semi- circular basin; in cleaning this we found frag- ments of sculpture and architecture. Terracotta conduits ran through the doorways."

Vedat Idil discusses a Corinthian capital from the N gate in VIII.TTKongresi 477-85. Aphrodisias. The Museum was opened in July 1979. Study and publication are the main projects at present, but Prof. Kenan Erim reports that demolition of a house site NE of the Agora brought to light important new architectural and sculptural finds. "Seven rooms, aligned E-W, with individual doors opening to a well-paved street or court were uncovered. Their facade resembled a scaenae frons and consisted of at least two stories of lower Doric, upper Corinthian columns, with relief panels inserted in the intercolumniations. These panels (ca. 1.6o x 1.30 m.) can be divided into two groups: one, with maeander-decorated base, was probably located in the lower storey. The second group has at least a dozen almost complete panels. They included: i. a frontal Roma, holding a spear, with a kneeling, bound male captive by her right foot; 2. two nude youthful males, one of them holding an aplustre in his right, an orb in his left hand; 3. a group of three figures, one prob- ably an emperor in heroic nudity, setting up a trophy to the left, at the base of which a crying, female captive is crouching, while a togate young man to the right crowns the emperor with the corona civica; 4. a pendant group with an Ama- zon-Virtus type crowning a woman, perhaps an empress, to the left (again with the corona civica); 5. a female figure sweeping in an elegant motion towards the right and setting up another trophy with a kneeling barbarian at its foot; 6. a nude velificans male figure holding a cornucopia and a rudder, flanked by two kneeling figures symboliz- ing the Earth and the Sea (in the form of a Tri- toness); 7. a nude frontal man holding an orb and crowning a trophy; 8. another nude prince or em- peror with a barbarian captive standing alongside; 9. a draped female figure extending an ear of wheat to a nude male; IO-I2. Nike figures, two of them carrying a trophy. The themes of the group with maeander base seem to be mythological, in- cluding a Leda and swan composition, a Woman with a child in her lap (Dionysus) approached by a satyr with a cluster of grapes. There were also many large coffers adorned with busts of Helios, Selene and Silenus, as well as decorative balus- trades with masks." The date of this elaborate complex is still under study. Carian pottery. A study entitled Carian Geomet- ric Pottery by Coskun Ozgiinel (Ankara 1979, Tuirk Tarih Kurumu VI, 20) presents a catalogue and discussion of Protogeometric and Geometric vases from the sites of Asarlik, Dirmil, Sinuri, Lagina, Begin and Euromus, principally from cem- eteries. IONIA Miletus. Prof. Milller-Wiener reports: "On Hu- meitepe, the northernmost peninsula of the an- cient city, the line of the fortification wall has been traced, consisting of remains of gneiss ashlar with poros filling. On a terrace at the N tip of the pen- insula, the foundations (22.60 x II.80 m.) of an Ionic anta-temple were cleared. Fragments of the marble superstructure date it to the second half of the 3rd century B.C. A rectangular altar lay in front of the temple; nearby were found a variety of terracottas (pl. 60, fig. 7) and a large number of miniature hydriae. The cult was probably that of a goddess (Demeter?). A structure to the S may have been a treasury (pl. 60, fig. 8). Soundings W of the bouleuterion in Miletus yielded a good se- quence of archaic and early classical levels. Trial cuts in the Bishop's Palace revealed at least six habitation levels. Hellenistic poros blocks belong to an establishment covered by Roman imperial buildings. The rooms of a more ornate residential unit of the 4th century A.C. were partly reused in the Bishop's Palace."

Didyma. Sacred Road, analysis of building periods built over a Hellenistic structure of ca. ii x i6 m. built of limestone ashlar. This structure had an an- nex (pl. 59, fig-. 3) and a well; the latter yielded a large number of basket-handled vessels of identi- cal type (pl. 59, fig-. 4), at least 297 bases were counted. The complex formed a terrace N of a rocky spur; an altar may have stood on the founda- tion in the annex. A 7th-6th century predecessor is indicated by poros blocks in room 4 and much pot- tery. The Hellenistic terrace and altar were used with the Roman stoa; the complex was abandoned in the 6th century A.C., the stoa later converted into an arcade. The E side of the Sacred Road has rooms contemporary with this arcade. Earlier walls are fragmentarily preserved. A 1oo m. stretch of the Sacred Road outside of Didyma, where the Branchidae were found in 1907, was investigated. Sarcophagi of imperial Roman date line the road (pl. 60, fig. 5). Priene. Joseph C.

The preliminary report on the 1978 sea- son appeared in AnzWien 116 (1979) 123-44. The anastylosis of the Celsus library was completed and the festive inauguration took place on September 30, 1978. Excavations in the lower agora continued with the clearing of several small tumuli with monolithic sarcophagus burials, one of which con- tained a Fikellura amphora of the last quarter of the 6th century B.C. These tombs were built along the archaic processional street which has also been found in front of the Celsus library. This street ran from the Artemision via the Magnesian gate around the Koressos and back to the Artemision. In Hanghaus 2 the court S of the Socrates-room was cleared; restoration of the vaulted stucco ceil- ing in the room adjoining the basilica continues; general plans for conservation of the Hanghduser are under study. The Felsspalttempel W of the sta- dium has been recorded and studied. The cella is square (10.35 x 10.35 m.) and raised two steps above the pronaos. The cult was probably not of Apollo but of a goddess, to judge by the finds. In the excavations in front of the Artemisium, a N-S structure of 34 m. length ("hekatompedon") was recognized in 1979. Several studies of Ephesian ma- terial appeared in iJh 51 (1976-77), Beiblatt, as well as Sandor Kasper's article on the tumulus at Belevi, 129-79. Erythrai. Prof. Ekrem Akurgal reports that in- vestigation of the podium walls of the Athena temple is in progress. Two of the terrace walls date to the 8th century B.C.; N of the temple a house of megaron plan belonging to the second half of the 8th century B.C. has been found. Other build- ings investigated are a Hellenistic villa with peri- style court, two megaron-houses of the classical pe- riod, and the remains of Roman villae and mosaics. Prof. Cevdet Bayburtluoglu is excavating and re- storing the 4th century theater. Bayrakhi-Old Smyrna. The residential area being excavated under the direction of Prof. Ekrem Akurgal has yielded houses generally built in sim- ple megaron plans from the 7th to the 4th century B.C. The study of the temple of Athena and its votives continues. The columns have been studied in detail and are reconstructed with smooth bases and elaborate capitals, cf. Ekrem Akurgal, Ancient Civilizations and Ruins of Turkey (Istanbul 1978) fig. 4Ia.

LYDIA Sardis. In 1979, Prof. Crawford H. Greenewalt, Jr. reports, excavation of the Lydian mudbrick for- tification S of the Roman synagogue continued. "The colossal structure survives in situ to a height of ca. 9-50 m. Soundings in the summit of the hill- ock S of the modern highway revealed a stone building, set into the brick mass (pl. 61, fig. ii), ca. 5.70 m. wide, its faces built with roughly trimmed blocks of limestone (with some schist and sand- stone), without mortar. Plentiful Lydian pottery (of bichrome, streaky glaze, and gray ware fabrics) recovered against the faces suggests that the stone building dates to the Lydian period, 7th-5th centu- ries B.C. The stone structure may represent a strengthening rampart added to defenses that had been weakened in a conflagration. S of the hillock, below Roman material, more of the Lydian mud- brick wall was brought to light on a stone socle. Parts of the street and the colonnaded ambulatory N of the highway were exposed. Resting in the destruction debris in the ambulatory was a statue pedestal (i.6o m. high, ca. 0.62 m. in diameter) in- scribed with a Greek text recording honors by the people of Sardis to the emperor Tiberius, founder of the city-a reference to Tiberius' benefaction to Sardis after its devastation by earthquake in A.D. 17 (pl. 61, fig. 13).

MELLINK [AJA 84 West wall, 3-30 m. thick, and the Lydian East wall, 10.50 m. to the E, of the same orientation (pl. 61, fig. 12); the latter has W and S faces meeting at an obtuse angle, built of ashlar masonry, its lower courses of sandstone, the upper courses of lime- stone blocks with chisel-drafted borders. A ramp of clay with a cobbled surface slopes upward to the lowest course of the W face. Middle Corinthian sherds under the Lydian W wall and working floor of the E wall suggest a date for the walls after 575 B.C.

In the series of Sardis monographs the fifth volume has appeared: Andrew Ramage, Lydian Houses and Architectural Terracottas (Cambridge, Mass. 1978). Sardis-Ahmetli. Director Kubilay Nayir in 1979 undertook a rescue excavation of tumuli at Ala- hidir-Ahmetli some io km W of Sardis. Robbers had entered a tumulus with a rectangular cist of ashlar masonry and gabled roof. Another tumulus contained three rooms built side by side and inter- connected by windows; each room had a doorway closed with blocks and doorplugs neatly fitted against the door frame. Lydian pottery remained as dating evidence. AEOLIS-MYSIA Kyme. Dr. Hasan Ugankus in 1979 undertook soundings in several parts of the site, partly to check on robbers' activities and the provenance of the large inscription now in the Izmir Museum, a block nearly 2 m. high inscribed with decrees hon- oring Archippe, benefactress of Kyme and donor of the bouleuterion; cf. H. Engelmann, Die In- schriften von Kyme (Bonn 1976) No. 13. The counterpart inscription was found at the entrance to a large Hellenistic building, possibly the bouleu- terion. In other soundings a series of pottery dat- ing from protogeometric to classical was found; this is being studied by Dr. Gilven Bakir. For the plan of Kyme see P. Knoblauch, AA 1974, 285-9I.

Remnants of mosaics were found in several rooms. The peristyle can be recon- structed from Doric frieze blocks and column fragments found as spolia in Roman remodellings of the house. An earlier Hellenistic house (late 3rd century?) is attested by stuccoed wall remnants in IIC/9. The house of ill. 2 originally continued to the NE beyond room 4. In the 2nd-3rd centu- ries A.C. a completely different complex was built here, a small bath with hypocaust in IIE/7 (pl. 62, fig. 15) and a large water reservoir in IID/6, preserved to a depth of 4 m. The bath must belong to a building in NE direction. Mar- ble incrustation decorates the walls of several rooms; the floors had marble paving. The tepi- darium had remnants of painted stucco (black bands on white ground). Fragments of greenish glass and marble frames indicate the presence of glass windows. The walls of the caldarium were heated by hot air circulation between the two wall faces; the inner face was attached to the structural walls of the caldarium with the aid of terracotta spacers (pl. 62, fig. I7), which are common in Per- gamon. These are ca. 19 cm. long, with a diameter of 5-8 cm. for the heads; the ends are bevelled and were stuck ca. 5 cm. deep into the joints of the caldarium walls. The heads were attached with mortar to rooftiles set on edge to form the inner wall, strengthened by a 3-4 cm. layer of mortar, which in turn held the marble incrustation. The total width of this inner wall face added up to ca. 8 cm. The main period of use of this bath was in the late 2nd-3rd centuries A.C.; it continued at least into the fourth century. "Separate projects continue for the study of the city walls and aqueducts. The recording and re- construction of the Traianeum are progressing. The architectural members of the N stoa are being fitted together. Ashlar blocks are being made of an- desite-cement for reconstruction of walls and revet- ments. Excavation in the Eastern annex cleared two levels of Hellenistic house walls oriented NW- SE, the same orientation is found for Hellenistic walls under the entrance to room L of the sub- structure, and in buildings behind the library. Ex- cavation of the three rows of rooms under the temple foundations has been completed.

The salvage ex- cavations by the Department of Antiquities in the Kestel valley E of Pergamon continue under the direction of Selahattin Erdemgil, who kindly re- ports: "Initially it was thought that the area of the Kestel-Ketios valley, due to be flooded by the dam project, was the site of an ancient cemetery. Tombs indeed came to light during preliminary road con- struction in 1977, but in 1978 potters' workshops appeared on the E bank extending over an area of a kilometer in length, with two major concentra- tions. The natural conditions (claybeds, red earth) are favorable. A large team of excavators worked from August 1979 until the end of February 1980. Some 400,000 ceramic items were collected, includ- ing wasters, moulds for pottery, relief decorations (pl. 60, figs. 9 and io), and lamps, potters' equip- ment and tools, kiln supports, props, control pieces. Relief ware belongs mostly to the first centuries B.C. and A.C. Seventeen kilns were excavated, 1.20-1.80 m. in diameter on the average, rounded in plan. One 2nd century A.C. kiln was found with a full load of fired pottery, destroyed by flooding, offering an unusual check on contemporaneity of wares." PROPONTIS-THRACE Marmara-Prokonnesos. Work in the open air museum and the area S of Saraylar was continued by Dr. Nusin Asgari. The exploration has located nine ancient quarries and an ancient quarry road of 2 m. width.

Prof. Paolo Verzone has in recent</page><page sequence="17">1980] ARCHAEOLOGY IN ASIA MINOR 517 years supervised extensive excavation and restora- tion in the theater. The stage building with its or- namental detail has been largely cleared. The date is given by the inscribed imperial relief once in- stalled over the central door, representing Sep- timius Severus, Julia Domna, Caracalla and Geta. The frieze on the podium of the lowest order has been recovered almost completely; its iconography emphasizes Apollo on the N side, Artemis on the S, including their birth scenes. The vault under the stage building has been strengthened. Work in the necropolis also continues. A general survey of the extensive work of the Italian mission appeared in Quaderni de 'La ricerca scientifica' 1oo (1978) 391-475- CILICIA Anamur-Anemurium. Prof. James Russell re- ports that in 1979 "the principal operation was to continue the cleaning and consolidation of wall- paintings in the Roman necropolis. On the S wall of tomb B I 16 alongside the figure of Hermes Psychopompos discovered in 1975 has now ap- peared a winged putto identified by a dipinto as Pothos. The cleaning of the vault of the same room has also produced two more personified seasons. Matching the bust of Winter in the N face of the vault at the W end of the chamber we now have Spring, identified by a dipinto (EAP), represented as a youthful male bust. Between Winter and Spring in the crown of the vault has appeared a second rectangular panel containing a season in the form of a winged male genius reclining and hold- ing a hook in his left hand, probably Autumn. We may now reconstruct the sequence of the two cy- cles of Seasons, one consisting of busts within wreath medallions, the other of complete figures of winged genii with appropriate attributes each en- closed within a rectangular frame. The floor of the chamber was cleared to reveal a polychrome mo- saic pavement virtually intact. The central panel consists of a cantharus from which spring two vines bearing clusters of grapes."

Urs Pesch- low reports that soundings made under the aus- pices of the Aya Sophia Museum revealed a sub- structure ca. 2.50 m. deep under the E side and stylobate of the church, made of limestone blocks originally belonging to an older building (watch tower?) (pl. 62, fig. 18). When the church was built, an earlier, residential (?) structure was de- molished. Parts of walls and frescoes came to light. Istanbul, Haghia Eirene. Pottery from cleaning operations of the church is published in IstMitt 27- 28 (1977-1978) 363-414. Pergamon. Excavations in the city area, Dr. Wolfgang Radt reports, clarified the plan in the area overlying the Hellenistic peristyle house. The latest Byzantine complex is in IJ/3-8 with a large court flanked by long buildings and a chapel at the SE corner. The purpose of this Kirchgeh6ft with its regular plan is not yet clear. Herakleia under Latmos. Dr. Anneliese Pesch- low reports that small fortified monasteries were identified at Siisbiik, Sobran kalesi on the N shore of Lake Bafa, each with a church, a tower and a circuit wall. The large complex called Kiliselik is of similar type. All these belong to the Late Byzan- tine era. Tombs of this period were also found; they belong to a small town on the island called Menet Ada.
