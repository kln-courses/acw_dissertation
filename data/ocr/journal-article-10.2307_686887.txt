LLOYD It is a minor scandal that specialists in the interpretation of early Greek thought have, in general, paid so little attention to Professor Sir Karl Popper's provocative foray into their territory in his Presidential Address to the Aristotelian Society (Popper, 1958). That paper was answered by Professor G. S. Kirk in an article in Mind (Kirk, 1960), and since then both scholars have contributed a second paper which develops parts of their respective views (Kirk, 1961, Popper, 1963). But subsequently the debate has fizzled out. Nor, so far as I know, has any other classical scholar besides Kirk taken part (though Mr J. E. Raven repeated some of Kirk's criticisms of Popper in a paper read to the joint conference of the Hellenic and Roman Societies in I965). And yet their controversy raises two funda- mental issues, first the major philosophical question of the logic of scientific discovery, and secondly the historical question concerning the charac- teristics and methods of Greek natural philosophy. It is this latter question that I wish to take up here.' In particular I wish to broaden the field of the discussion to take the whole of early Greek speculative thought (and not merely the work of the philosophers) into account. And I shall suggest where certain generalisations which may apply to those writers whose interests were primarily cosmological should be modified when we take all the available evidence for the period down to Plato into account. I shall, however, begin by rehearsing briefly the main arguments that have been advanced by Popper and by Kirk concerning the Presocratic philosophers. Popper's original paper was entitled 'Back to the Presocratics'. 'What I want to return to', he said, 'is the simple straightforward rationality of the Presocratics. The simplicity and boldness of their questions is part of it, * Received i8.ii.66 1 An earlier version of this paper was read to the History and Philosophy of Science Seminar at Cambridge and to Professor Sir Karl Popper's Seminar at the London School of Economics. I am most grateful to those who have criticised my paper on those occasions and in correspondence and especially to Sir Karl Popper and Professor Kirk. The defects that remain are, of course, entirely my own responsibility, but I am conscious that they would have been far greater but for the patient and courteous criticisms I have received.</page><page sequence="2">22 G. E. R. Lloyd but more important still is the critical attitude which, as I shall try to show, was first developed in the Ionian School' (Popper, 1958, p. I). But Popper's purpose was not merely to praise Thales, Anaximander, Anaximenes and the rest, but also to draw lessons from their work for the history of science as a whole. In particular he used the evidence relating to the work of the Presocratics in order to attack, as he had done on previous occasions, the 'Baconian myth according to which science starts from observation and then slowly and cautiously proceeds to theories' (Popper, 1958, p. 3). 'Western science', as he put it, 'did not start with collecting observations of oranges, but with bold theories about the world' (Popper, 1958, p. 3). He argued that most of the ideas of the early Preso- cratics, and the best of them, 'have nothing to do with observation', and to support this claim he referred to such examples as Thales's notion that the earth floats on water, and Anaximander's idea of the earth's free suspension in space. He dealt in some detail with other Presocratics too, particularly with Heraclitus, where he argued strenuously against the view taken by Kirk (1957) according to which Heraclitus himself held not the strong thesis that every single thing is constantly and invariably in change, but merely the much weaker thesis that the world as a whole undergoes continuous change. Popper presented his theses in what can only be considered a provocative manner, saying that 'the exciting story of the development of the problem of change' (for example) appeared to be 'in danger of being completely buried under the mounting heap of the minutiae of textual criticism' (Popper, 1958, pp. 9-IO). 'In this paper', he put it, 'I speak as an amateur, as a lover of the beautiful story of the Presocratics. I am not a specialist, nor an expert: I am completely out of my depth when an expert begins to argue what words or phrases Heraclitus might have used, and what words or phrases he could not possibly have used. But when the experts replace a beautiful story, based on the oldest texts we possess, by one which-to me at any rate-makes no sense any longer, then I feel that even an amateur may stand up and defend an old tradition' (Popper, I958, p. 2). When Kirk (1960) came to reply, he defended the practice of minute textual criti- cism against Popper's somewhat indiscriminate attacks.' And he put forward a different interpretation of certain specific Presocratic doctrines from that which Popper had advanced. In particular he corrected Popper's suggestion 1 Popper (1963, p. 157) has since protested that he neither said nor suggested that con- sideration of the words or phrases Heraclitus might have used was irrelevant: he merely disclaimed competence in the field of linguistic criticism. Nevertheless some of his remarks can be construed as attacks not on a particular expert nor on particular con- clusions reached on the basis of a close study of the text, so much as on the experts, and the practice of textual criticism, in general.</page><page sequence="3">Popper v. Kirk: A Controversy in Interpretation of Greek Science 23 that in Anaximander winds were responsible not only for the weather, but for 'all other changes within the cosmic edifice' (Kirk, I960, p. 332).1 And thirdly where Popper had argued that Presocratic philosophy contained some 'staggering anticipations of modern results', Kirk advanced a more sceptical and seemingly more judicious view of the extent to which such anticipations are to be found. But if on these mainly peripheral issues Kirk made a number of telling points, he was less successful in his criticisms of the central thesis of Popper's paper, the anti-Baconian argument. The first part of Kirk's paper was a critique of Popper's theory of scientific methodology. There he began by considering why, that is for what historical and personal reasons, Popper arrived at his-as Kirk thought-utterly mistaken view.2 But on the main point at issue Kirk simply asserted that 'science ultimately does start from observation'. Naturally, most attempts to extend scientific knowledge start immediately from an idea or intuition, which is then tested 'scientifically' and accordingly approved, modified, or rejected. But the idea or intuition which acted as the starting-point of any such particular process is itself the culmination of a previous process or series of processes which must have been 'inductive' in some valid sense because it must ultimately have been based on an indefinite number of particular observations.... What Popper has done, then, in his description of the process of scientific discovery, is to ignore the essential preliminary stage of making observations, of building up a complex structure of experience out of which, by some kind of inductive process, come intuitions or universal theories' (Kirk, I960, pp. 321-2). But Kirk's notion of this 'essential preliminary stage' in the process of scientific discovery seems not only true but a truism3: and it may be re- marked that it does not help us to discriminate between what is and what is not science. But apart from the general question of the nature of scientific method, there is a substantial disagreement between Popper and Kirk on the place of observation, and of what Kirk calls common-sense, in Presocratic philosophy. In his Presidential Address Popper took Kirk to task for his remark that 'it cannot be too strongly emphasised that before Parmenides and his apparent proof that the senses were completely fallacious . .. gross departures from common sense must only be accepted when the evidence 1 When he came to reprint his original paper Popper (1963, pp. 136 ff.) modified some of his statements and introduced an explanatory note to meet Kirk's criticisms at this point. 2 In his reply Popper (1963, pp. 154 ff.) has protested that Kirk has misrepresented his position, particularly by suggesting that his, Popper's, view of scientific methodology is an intuitionist one. 3 Compare Popper's recognition of the role of 'experience', including observational knowledge, in the origin of problems (Popper, 1963, p. 155), quoted p. 26, note.</page><page sequence="4">24 G. E. R. Lloyd for them is extremely strong' (Kirk, 1957, p. 197; Popper, 1958, p. 16). In his reply Kirk made a small but perhaps important change in the formulation of his position: 'Naturally many of the conclusions of the early Presocratics were contrary to common sense; but they were not gratuitous departures from it ("gratuitous" expresses my meaning better than "gross") since they appeared to be entailed by arguments which themselves depended on observation and common sense' (Kirk, I960, pp. 335-6). Kirk devoted a paragraph to this in the 1960 paper, but a whole article (Kirk, 1961) entitled 'Sense and Common-sense in the Development of Greek Philosophy' was published the next year1 in which he went through not only the Presocratics but the whole of classical Greek philosophy considering which of their theories could be accounted exceptions to his rule that the Greek philosophers did not gratuitously depart from, or overstep the bounds of, common sense. 'Common sense' is at the best of times a dangerously vague and subjective term. In his opening paragraphs Kirk gave various examples to explain the distinction between a notion allowed by common sense and one precluded by it, but the examples he gave suggest that he would be reluctant to concede that these categories may be culture- or society-specific.2 At least when he draws a general contrast between Greek myths and those of their ancient Near Eastern neighbours he appears to discount the possibility that some of the 'sym- bolist extravagances' of the Egyptians may have seemed just as common- sensical to them as the Greek beliefs about the sun or the sky or the origin of things did to the Greeks. But Kirk's chief concern was with the philosophers. He granted that there are quite a number of their theories that offend common sense, but he suggested that, in general, the philosophers took refuge in such theories only when they believed themselves to be compelled to do so by the de- mands of logic. He offered, in effect, two types of explanation for the theories in question. First such a theory may be a generalisation arrived at by an over-bold induction from a single observation or set of observations. The Pythagorean doctrine that the world is somehow made out of numbers is the prime example. But this number-physics, as Kirk pointed out, seems to have resulted from an important new observation-that the musical scale is basically numerical. Secondly there are cases where a startlingly 1 This paper originated in one read to a classical conference in 1958, that is to say it was based on ideas which Kirk had developed before Popper's first paper (1958) had appeared. 2 'Common sense', he said (Kirk, 1961, p. 105), 'might not prevent a man from believing that the sun is a large ball of fire... On the other hand the belief that the sun is made out of triangles, or is rowed across the sky with oars, may be felt to offend common sense, because there are no obvious elements of our experience that can be combined without contradiction to form such a picture.'</page><page sequence="5">Popper v. Kirk: A Controversy in Interpretation of Greek Science 25 improbable theory arose directly as the result of following an initial axiom to its apparently logical conclusions (see, e.g. Kirk, I96I, p. I I). Here Parmenides provides the clearest example. Kirk allowed that from the point of view of common sense Parmenides's doctrine of Being is 'com- pletely improbable and indeed utterly nonsensical'. But, he went on, 'the Eleatic conclusion about Being was the direct result of a logical process of inference-admittedly an incorrect one-and . . . it was logic alone that led Parmenides to overthrow the world of common-sense' (1961, pp. I Io-I).x He dealt similarly with Empedocles, for example, arguing that certain of his 'rather quaint' cosmological ideas were 'initially imposed upon' him 'by the demands of symmetry in working out his cyclical scheme, itself necessitated by his premises of essential unity and no becoming' (1961, p. III). As for Anaxagoras, Kirk agreed that his physical theory 'must have seemed inherently improbable, as well as intolerably complex, to the common-sense view of interested amateurs', but went on: 'we must recognise that a degree of improbability was inevitably entailed by the attempt to retain the sense-world at all' (1961, p. I Iz2). The Atomists too he saw as taking a 'momentous step away from the phenomenal world of common-sense'. But again their theory'depended from a chain of reasoning, one which owed much to that of the Eleatics. It was the apparent cogency of this reasoning', Kirk concluded, 'that gave Democritus the confidence to proceed beyond the senses' (1961, p. 112z). Kirk continued with Plato and Aristotle, the Epicureans and the Stoics, but failed there too to find gratuitous departures from common sense. Indeed considering his idea of what would constitute such a gratuitous departure and his explicit statement that 'philosophers normally avoid hypotheses that are gratuitously contrary to common-sense' (1961, p. o105), it would have been quite surprising if he had found many such theories. He did, in fact, cite two possible examples in the history of classical Greek philosophy,2 Xenophanes's obscure idea that eclipses are caused by the sun 'wandering off into a region of the earth uninhabited by men', and the doctrine of innumerable worlds attributed to Anaximander. But the former he saw as an ironical parody of the 'excessive dogmatism and naive theorisation of the Milesians' (1961, p. io8), and the latter, he pointed 1 In his first paper Kirk had stated emphatically that those of the Presocratics' theories that are contrary to common sense are not gratuitous departures from it 'since they appeared to be entailed by arguments which themselves depended on observation and common sense' (1960, pp. 335-6). But it would seem impossible to claim this to be true of Parmenides's doctrine of Being. 2 Kirk noted that Heraclitus would be another instance if he held the strong thesis that every individual thing is in perpetual flux (though Kirk denies, of course, that this was Heraclitus's thesis) (t96x, p. xo9).</page><page sequence="6">26 G. E. R. Lloyd out, may well be a doxographic misrepresentation of Anaximander. Yet to show that the early Greek philosophers avoid theories that are purely whimsical does not seem particularly interesting (even if it serves to counter- act a certain tendency, on the part of some commentators, to assume that many of their theories are quite arbitrary). And one might draw a rather different conclusion from the one Kirk suggested from the material on which he commented. What might be thought remarkable about that material is not the point that Kirk draws attention to, that there are so few gratuitous departures from 'common sense', so much as that there are so many departures from 'common sense'-not that when they suggested theories that offend against the evidence of the senses, the Greek philoso- phers thought they had good reasons for doing so, but rather that they felt themselves constrained to do so so often. Subsequently Popper (1963), too, has made a second contribution to the debate, where he argued that Kirk had misrepresented his view of scientific methodology1 and reaffirmed his general thesis on the Presocratics, and then concentrated most of his attention on two specific points in the interpretation of Heraclitus. The main issue between Popper and Kirk is a general one in the philo- sophy of science. At the same time they have expressed divergent views on the role of observation in the early Greek natural philosophers, and this raises a historical issue concerning the methods of early Greek science. It is this issue that I wish to follow up in the rest of this paper. While Popper and Kirk have confined their attention, so far, to figures who appear in the histories of Greek philosophy, I wish to extend the area of the dis- cussion to take the evidence for other parts of early Greek science into account. There are interesting and important differences both between the practice of different early Greek scientists, and between the theories some of them entertained on the subject of the methods to be used in the investigation into nature. A study of the medical writers, for example, can, of course, in no way invalidate generalisations that are meant to apply to the cosmologists alone: it may, however, help us to discover where the methods favoured by particular philosophers are typical or atypical of early Greek science taken as a whole. 1 Popper (1963, p. I55) briefly restated his position on the question of the starting-point of science as follows: 'I do not say that science starts from intuitions but that it starts from problems; that we arrive at a new theory, in the main, by trying to solve problems; that these problems arise in our attempts to understand the world as we know it-the world of our "experience" (where "experience" consists largely of expectations or theories and partly also of observational knowledge-although I happen to believe that there does not exist anything like pure observational knowledge, untainted by expecta- tions or theories).'</page><page sequence="7">Popper v. Kirk: A Controversy in Interpretation of Greek Science 27 Apart from the philosophers the other major strand to Greek science in the pre-Platonic period is represented by certain of the Hippocratic writings. It is true that this material is difficult to handle because very few of the texts can be assigned to a specific author and the dates of most of them cannot be determined at all precisely. But against this it must be said first that the general period within which almost all of them fall can be fixed reasonably certainly, that is from the mid fifth to the late fourth century B.C., and secondly that they have one enormous advantage (from our point of view) over the remains of the Presocratic philosophers, namely that we possess not just a series of isolated fragments quoted by later writers, but a considerable number of quite extensive treatises. These constitute, in fact, one of our main sources not merely for Greek medical theory and practice (that is obvious), but also for Greek biology in general and even for certain aspects of contemporary Greek physics and cosmology. What is more, they provide some striking early examples of the painstaking collecting and reporting of particular facts. In attempting to assess how far there are any signs of inductivist tendencies in early Greek science taken as a whole we should, then, consider such works as the Hippocratic treatises On Epidemics. Books I and III of the Epidemics probably form a single work which appears to date from some time in or around the last decade of the fifth century B.C. (Deichgriber, 1933, p. i6; Bourgey, 1953, p. 32). These books contain first what are known as the 'constitutions', that is general descrip- tions of the climatic conditions accompanying certain outbreaks, and then a number of detailed case histories in which the daily progress of a particular patient's illness is set out. The entries under each day vary in length from a single remark to a fairly detailed description,1 and the observations con- tinue until the patient either dies (as happens in the majority of cases) or recovers, in some cases as late as the I2zoth day from the onset of the disease. These treatises have always been famous for their cool, professional attitude to clinical medicine, and their careful and methodical observations of the symptoms of various conditions. One may also remark the absence of any dogmatic overall theory of the origins of diseases such as we find often enough elsewhere in the Hippocratic Corpus (an extreme example is provided by the work On Breaths which calmly states that the cause of all diseases is one and the same, namely 'air', chapters 2, 4 and 5, Corpus 1 E.g. Epid. III, Case 3 (First Series): 'Fourth day. Vomited scanty, bilious, yellow vomits, and after a short interval, verdigris-coloured ones; slight flow of unmixed blood from the left nostril; stools unaltered and urine unaltered; sweat about the head and collar- bones; spleen enlarged; pain in the direction of the thigh; tension, soft underneath, of the right hypochondrium; no sleep at night; slight delirium' (trans. Jones, I923, p. 223).</page><page sequence="8">28 G. E. R. Lloyd Medicorum Graecorum, I, i. 92, 13 ff.). We might ask, then, how far it would be justified to see the case histories of the Epidemics as serving the purpose of preliminary collections of observations prior to the proposal of pathological doctrines. How far would it be right to represent this writer as proceeding inductively from particular case histories to general theories? First of all we must be clear about the writer's motives for undertaking and setting out his case histories in the way he does. Like most of the Hippocratic medical writers, he attaches greater importance to prognosis than to diagnosis. The object of assembling the collections of case histories is not so much to provide information which would enable the causes of diseases to be established, as to provide information which would help doctors to predict the outcome of particular diseases (especially, of course, whether the patient would die or recover). But a further point concerns the way in which the observations are set out, that is the way in which the writer begins with the first day of the disease and makes an entry for each subsequent day on which any significant change was observed until death or recovery. The observations are methodical and even meticulous. But the writer has an additional motive for presenting these observations in the way he does, and indeed for carrying out his daily check, over and above any laudable desire to be thorough in his work, that is he adheres to the common Greek medical theory that the course of acute diseases is determined according to what are called 'critical days'. Thus in the third Constitution in Book I (ch. zz22) we find several such passages as the following: 'Most cases had a crisis on the fifth day from the outset, then intermitted four days, relapsed, had a crisis on the fifth day after the relapse, that is, after thirteen days altogether. Mostly children experienced crises thus, but older people did so too. Some had a crisis on the eleventh day, a relapse on the fourteenth, and a complete crisis on the twentieth. But if rigour came on about the twentieth day the crisis came on the fortieth' (trans. Jones, 1923, PP. 179-81). And later in the same book (ch. 26) the writer produces a detailed table of critical periods for diseases that had crises on even, and for those that had crises on odd, days. It is clear that these books of the Epidemics, for all their appearance of being a set of systematic observations carried out in a spirit of 'dis- interested' inquiry, owe something of their overall form to the writer's preconceived idea of the importance of critical days. But to this two points should be added. First one should not underestimate the experiential basis for the notion of 'critical' days. Jones, for example, remarked that it is a commonplace that some diseases tend to reach a crisis on a fixed day from the commencement, although the day is not absolutely fixed, nor is it the same for all diseases, and he went on to suggest a particular con-</page><page sequence="9">Popper v. Kirk: A Controversy in Interpretation in Greek Science 29 nection between the theory of critical days and the periodicity of malaria (Jones, 1923, Intro. pp. liv-lv). And secondly we should note the relation between theory and observation in Epidemics I and III. The writer is certainly disposed to believe that 'critical' days follow certain patterns. But the specific rules he suggests are evidently based on his particular observations, that is the case-histories, including, no doubt, many others besides those recorded in our texts. Thus in chapter 21 of the third Constitution, having noted that 'when there was a crisis on the seventh day, with an intermission of six days followed by a relapse, there was a second crisis on the seventh day after the relapse', he mentions an example: 'in the case of Phanocritus, for example, who lay a sick at the house of Gnathon the fuller' (trans. Jones, 1923, P. 179). And in the same chapter he refers by name to two patients whom we may assume to be identical with the subjects of the first and second case-histories in the series that immediately follows (although if the Silenus mentioned is the same man, this example shows that the writer is capable of careless mistakes in using the case-histories, in this instance concerning the day on which the patient died). It is not, then, that the writer conducted his observations simply in order to confirm rules that he had already formulated in detail. Rather those detailed rules are, for the most part at least, generalisations which he made on the basis of his particular observations (cf. Deichgriber, 1933, pp. zo20-2zI).' And although the writer only rarely makes suggestions relating to the causes of the diseases he was studying, when he does so he is again clearly building on the evidence of the detailed case-histories, as for example in the third Constitution when he remarks on the predominance of the humour blood and several times notes the connection between loss of blood and recovery (chs. 14 and 15, of Deichgriiber, 1933, p. i3). Not all Greek science, even in the period before Plato, is as heavily inclined towards abstract theorising, and as impatient of empirical investi- gation, as most of the Presocratic philosophers appear to have been. Epidemics I and III, in particular, report detailed observations which served as the basis for generalisations concerning the periodicities of diseases. But it is not only their actual practice that suggests that different attitudes were taken by different early Greek scientists on the question of the proper method of conducting the inquiry into nature. We should next consider what the Greek authors themselves have to say on the subject of 1 Most of these rules take the form of generalisations which (he claims) apply 'for the most part' or 'in the majority of cases', and he notes instances where the pattern of critical days for similar conditions was dissimilar. Thus in chapter zo of the third Constitution he remarks that two brothers fell ill at the same time but had their first crises on different days. Cf. also Prognostic, chapter 20, the author of which observes that critical periods cannot be calculated in whole days any more than the solar year or the lunar month can.</page><page sequence="10">30 G. E. R. Lloyd the aims of science and on the nature of scientific method. It is true that most of the important texts relating to these questions come not from the pre-Platonic period, but from the fourth century. Aristotle is obviously our most important single source if we try to investigate what the Greeks thought they were doing when they were doing science, or what ideas they had on the nature of the method of inquiry to be used in science. And yet it would be wrong to assume that the Aristotelian doctrine of episteme is the only, even if it may be the most representative, Greek notion of what 'science' is. Again the anonymous medical writers supply interesting evidence relating to the period from the mid-fifth to the mid fourth century B.c. The author of On Ancient Medicine, for example, who was probably writing around the end of the fifth century, shows what, for his time, is a quite surprising grasp of problems of method and of the distinctions between different types of inquiry. In chapter I, particularly, he distinguishes different inquiries not merely by their subject-matter, but by their method, especially by whether or not they need to employ what he calls hupo- theseis-postulates or assumptions. Medicine, he claims, has no need of such assumptions, differing in this from 'obscure and problematic subjects, concerning which anyone who attempts to hold forth at all is forced to use a postulate, as for example about things in heaven or things under the earth: for if anyone were to speak and declare the nature of these things, it would not be clear either to the speaker himself or to his audience whether what was said was true or not, since there is no criterion to which one should refer to obtain clear knowledge' (CMG, I. i. 36, 15 ff.). The writer distinguishes, then, between those inquiries where some sort of 'postulate' is necessary, and those like medicine (as he believes) where it is not. But when he cites astronomy, meteorology and geology as examples of inquiries where a postulate is necessary, it is not that he approves of the use of a postulate in these subjects but not in others. On the contrary, the very fact that they have to make use of a postulate is enough, in the writer's opinion, to condemn those inquiries as worthless-for that surely is the implication of the remark 'it would not be clear either to the speaker himself or to his audience whether what was said was true or not, since there is no criterion to which one should refer to obtain clear knowledge'. This is, in effect, a statement of the need for scientific theories to be testable: speculation about what goes on in the sky and under the earth is worthless because unverifiable, at least according to the author's standards of verifiability. And yet when we turn to the theories concerning the component substances in the body and the origins of diseases that are proposed by the author himself, there is perhaps little need to point out</page><page sequence="11">Popper v. Kirk: A Controversy in Interpretation of Greek Science 31I that they are similar in kind to, and almost as arbitrary as, the doctrines that he refuted with such damaging arguments.' Chapter I of Ancient Medicine provides important evidence of what one writer in the period before Aristotle thought on certain methodological issues. At first sight his demand for 'clarity' (to saphes) might seem com- parable with the Aristotelian insistence on certain, unshakable knowledge. But the two ideas are quite different. Aristotle speaks of two types of cognitive state as unfailingly true, nous, the understanding of the primary self-evident premisses or starting-points of knowledge, and episteme, 'scientific' knowledge based on the demonstrative syllogism (see, e.g. An. Post. Ioo b, 5 ff.). Ancient Medicine's idea of 'clear knowledge' is much less sophisticated, but clarity appears to belong, in his view, only to notions for which there is overwhelming support in the direct evidence of the senses, and he certainly rejects conjecture for the sake of conjecture as worthless. What is more Ancient Medicine also sets out certain ideas on the origins of medicine, and these too are worth comparing with the later, more influential notions of Aristotle on the development of different kinds of knowledge. The views expounded on this subject in Metaphysics A chapters I-2 are well known. There Aristotle distinguishes between 'experience' 'art' and 'science', but he makes no secret of his preference for those branches of knowledge that are purely speculative and un- productive, and he suggests that the highest form of knowledge, wisdom, arises from the sense of wonder (982 b, I I ff.). Ancient Medicine deals, it is true, mainly with the origin of one specific 'art', medicine, but his views on this are striking. He treats medicine as a development of dietetics. He traces its origin to the trial and error experiments that men in their primi- tive state must (he believes) have carried out on their food in order to make it digestible. 'Trying many other things out on their food,' he says in chapter 3 (38, 16 ff.), 'they boiled and roasted and mixed it . . . adapting it all to the nature of man .... But what juster or more fitting name could one give this discovery and inquiry than medicine?' And when he comes in a later chapter (20, 51, 6 ff.) to talk about the inquiry into nature more generally, he says: 'I think that clear knowledge about nature can only be gained from medicine, and from no other source.' Unless one studies medicine, he goes on, one cannot know 'what a man is, by what causes he comes to be and so on exactly'. His view, then, is that the 'arts' (and his He criticises medical theorists who had postulated 'the hot' 'the cold' 'the wet' or 'the dry' as the component substances in the body, but in his own admittedly rather more complex doctrine (chapter 14) he mentions as components such things as 'the sweet' and 'the bitter' (see further, Lloyd, 1966, pp. 69-70).</page><page sequence="12">32 G.E. R. Lloyd term techne is one that covers not only technology, but also inquiries that we should classify as scientific rather than technological) develop as a response to practical human needs.' Much more could be said on the theme of the variety of the ideas on the nature, aims and origins of 'the inquiry into nature' that are developed by different Greek writers in the fifth and fourth centuries. But while the basis of my approach has been that the evidence for the cosmologists is only a part (though the best known and in many ways the most important part) of the total material available in a study of early Greek science, it is now time to return to the general problem of the relation between, and the relative importance of, conjecture and observation in early Greek science, bearing in mind the differing views that have been expressed by Popper and Kirk on the Presocratics, Popper maintaining that the best of the Presocratics' ideas have nothing to do with observation, and Kirk on the other hand insisting on the part played by observation (and common- sense) in their theories. In part the disagreement between Popper and Kirk at this point seems to be a disagreement on values or emphasis, rather than on facts, and to reflect the different aspects of Presocratic speculation they have chosen to stress, and indeed to some extent one may, without contradiction, agree with what each of them has suggested. At the same time the evidence of the medical writers introduces certain new factors into the assessment of the balance between the dogmatic and the empirical strains in early Greek science as a whole, and I may now attempt to sum- marise the general conclusions that I think can be drawn on this issue. First several of the theses concerning the origins of Greek science that Popper has developed (with some, at least, of which Kirk too is in agree- ment) must surely be accepted. The first is that Greek science begins with global questions, not with detailed, specific ones, let alone with collections of observations. It begins with such problems as how things began and what they are made of. And of course the question of origins, particularly, had always been a favourite subject of myths, so that the Milesian philosophers' theories of the beginnings of things may be seen as rational- istic answers to a question that had already been posed, and answered, in mythical terms in, for example, Hesiod's Theogony. Secondly the role of rational criticism and debate in the early stages of Greek science is amply demonstrated by an impressive body of evidence. Whether or not Anaximander developed some of his doctrines in reaction to those of Thales, and Anaximenes to those of Anaximander, with later philosophers we have texts in which they refer unmistakably to the theories 1 Compare the views on the origin of civilisation and the arts reported in Diodorus, I, 8, I ff. (which are generally associated with Democritus).</page><page sequence="13">Popper v. Kirk: A Controversy in Interpretation in Greek Science 33 of their predecessors, often mentioning them by name. Xenophanes evidently satirises Pythagoras (Fr. 7), besides criticising Homer and Hesiod for their anthropomorphism. Heraclitus criticises both Pythagoras and Xenophanes by name (Fr. 40). Whether Parmenides had Heraclitus, among others, in mind in Fr. 6 is disputed, but the remains of Empedocles and of Anaxagoras contain obvious echoes of Parmenides. And here the medical writers provide supplementary evidence which tells a similar story. Besides the many Hippocratic treatises which criticise the theories of other medical writers, On the Nature of Man (ch. i) refers explicitly to the philosopher Melissus,1 and On Ancient Medicine (ch. zo) to Empedocles. Although our information on the dates and places of residence of many writers is imprecise, we have enough evidence to be sure that at the end of the fifth century theorists working in widely separated parts of the Greek world were quite often acquainted with one another's doctrines in some detail. The ease with which ideas seem to have travelled, in a period when there were still formidable barriers to the passage of men and goods, is remarkable and deserves to be more fully investigated. Then quite early in the history of the 'inquiry into nature', indeed not long after the Milesians themselves, there are second-order disputes, debates not between one particular theory or explanation and another, but on such questions as the bases of knowledge in general.2 This particular problem is, of course, largely the province of the philosophers.3 But what is especially striking and noteworthy is that even though there is no fully articulated doctrine of 'scientific method' until Aristotle, we find prelimin- ary sketches, if no more, of various notions of how the investigation of natural phenomena should be conducted in several earlier writers, and here the evidence from the medical theorists is particularly valuable.4 The extant texts of the period to the end of the fourth century B.c. provide, I I On the Nature of Man (ch. i) refers to the debates that took place on cosmological issues. The writer complains that given the same speakers and the same audience the same man never wins in the debate three times in succession. 2 Cf. Popper's comments on the importance of different epistemological theories in antiquity (1963, PP. 164 ff., cf. 9 ff. and 236 ff.). 3 By the end of the fifth century (or not long after) various positions had been stated by different writers on the question of the basis of knowledge, ranging from the pure intellectualism of Parmenides, to the crude sensationalism associated with Protagoras, via the complete scepticism that Gorgias professed: 'nothing exists, but if it exists, it is unknowable, and if it exists and is knowable, it still cannot be indicated to others' (De Melisso, Xenophane, Gorgia, 979 a, I1 f.). And that 'phenomena' or observed facts may be used as the basis for inferences concerning 'what is obscure' is the thesis of several writers beginning with Anaxagoras (Fr. 2Ia, see Lloyd, 1966, pp. 338 If., 353 ff-). 4 On Regimen I chapter 2, for example, states a view diametrically opposed to that of On Ancient Medicine: 'I say that he who intends to write correctly about human regimen must first know about the nature of man in general .. . , that is know from what things he is originally composed. .. C</page><page sequence="14">34 G. E. R. Lloyd believe, no example of the most extreme inductivist thesis, the idea that a theory or explanation can simply be read off from collected observations. Such a thesis is not stated, so far as I know, nor for that matter does it appear to have been assumed in practice by any early Greek scientist.1 But one view that practising 'inquirers into nature' do express is a distrust of speculation that is not capable of being verified (even if their idea of what would constitute a verification may be rather crude). Historically the emergence of this idea may be associated with the reaction of certain medical writers against what they represent as an invasion of medicine and biology by the assumptions and methods of the cosmologists. The writer of On Ancient Medicine considered that the geological and meteorological theories of his contemporaries suffered from one fundamental flaw, there was no evidence to confirm or refute them, and the question of the methods proper to medicine and to cosmology is one that concerned other theorists at this period.2 The medical writers provide, as we saw, some of the most remarkable early examples of the systematic collection of data, although their investi- gations were evidently carried out in the light of, and clearly reflect, their theoretical preconceptions. At the same time some of the Hippocratic authors had become aware that the problem of how to proceed in the inquiry into nature is a problem and took issue with the cosmologists over it. The dogmatic nature of much Presocratic speculation is a feature that had struck the writer of On Ancient Medicine, who explicitly rejected the use of arbitrary postulates such as 'the hot' and 'the cold'. It is clear to us that he too made certain quite arbitrary assumptions in his own patho- logical doctrines, for instance. But this does not diminish the importance of the fact that he attempted to distinguish the methods proper to medicine from those of cosmology. In judging the dogmatic elements of Presocratic thought, then, we should not forget that those very elements provoked a reaction among the medical writers who attempted to set up an alternative ideal of how the inquiry into nature should be conducted. It is tempting to offer sweeping generalisations about the nature of science in antiquity, and particularly about where it differs from science as we know it today. But many of the favourite generalisations of the text- 1 The nearest the Greeks came to expressing such a thesis is, perhaps, the equation of knowledge with sensation associated with Protagoras: but one should note first that Protagoras himself was no scientist, no inquirer into nature, and second that we know this doctrine mainly from Plato (e.g. Theaetetus, I52a f.) and it may well be that Plato has exaggerated it for his own polemical purposes. 2 Thus On the Nature of Man, chapter I also contrasts his own approach to the study of man with that of the cosmologists. Like the author of Ancient Medicine he criticises certain theorists for suggesting as the original constituents of man such things as air, or fire, or water, or earth, which do not obviously exist in man.</page><page sequence="15">Popper v. Kirk: A Controversy in Interpretation of Greek Science 35 books, helpful as they may be as very broad generalisations, often dis- regard quite a substantial body of evidence. It is often said, for instance, that Greek science is coloured, or rather tainted, by an all-pervasive teleology. Yet by the mid-fourth century, at any rate, the Greeks them- selves were well aware of this issue, that is they could and did distinguish between different types of causes, 'teleological' or otherwise, and of course they took different sides on the substantive point, the atomists denying as strenuously as Plato and Aristotle maintained the relevance of teleological causation. Then it is often said that Greek science is unduly influenced by mathematical models, and again this may be true as a very broad generalisation, but again we should note that mathematics was not the only model for knowledge that was adopted. And I have argued elsewhere (Lloyd, 1964) that the failure of the Greeks to devise and carry out experiments has been greatly exaggerated. Generalisation appears equally hazardous on the question of the relation between theory-construction and empirical research in antiquity, as here too the situation varies from one branch of science to another, depending on the subject-matter investigated and the means available to investigate it. Thus if we take the chief question that preoccupied Greek natural philosophers in the earliest period, that of the ultimate constituents of matter, empirical investigations of the properties of different substances were almost certainly not undertaken at all extensively until the late fourth century, long after the theoretical debate had been initiated by the Preso- cratic philosophers. And in that instance the first such investigations that that we know of (the fourth book of the Meteorologica, Theophrastus's De Lapidibus) were the work of men who adopted the Aristotelian four- element theory as the basis of their inquiry.1 In dynamics, too, it is evident that the first recognisable dynamical theories in antiquity (those of Aristotle) precede any attempt to conduct deliberate investigations to throw light on the factors which govern the speed of a moving object.2 In astronomy, however, the situation is more complex. First there is a series of rather crude models for the heavenly bodies (Anaximander's incorporates the idea that the fixed stars are lower, that is closer to the earth, than either the sun or the moon). But by the fourth century the Greeks certainly had access to the work of some Egyptian and Babylonian astronomers (see Aristotle, De Caelo 292 a, 7 ff.) and had already produced 1 This remains true whether or not it was Aristotle himself who composed Meteorologica IV. 2 While Aristotle himself, so far as we can judge, seems, in his dynamics, to have relied almost entirely on common experience, we may take it from Simplicius, in Ph. 916, 12 ff., that Strato undertook certain tests in this field relating, for example, to the phenomena of acceleration.</page><page sequence="16">36 G. E. R. Lloyd some observational astronomers of note themselves. In several cases we can trace how improvements in observational astronomy led to criticism of existing theories or indeed to new theoretical problems. The Ars Eudoxi provides information on the increasingly accurate estimates of the length of the seasons made from Euctemon and Meton in the late fifth century to Callippus in the latter part of the fourth. But this apparent irregularity in the movement of the sun constituted a difficulty for Eudoxus's theory of concentric spheres, and was, it seems,1 one of the reasons that led Callippus to modify that theory in certain respects. Then to take an example from later Greek astronomy, it was by conducting his own detailed observations of the stars and by comparing these with those of earlier astronomers that Hipparchus was led to discover the precession of the equinoxes, and the observations in question (which are reported in Ptolemy, Syntaxis VII, chs. I-2) need not have been, and probably were not, carried out with any idea of confirming or refuting a particular theory of the motion of the heavenly bodies. In biology, some important problems, including, for example, the ques- tion of whether the seed comes from the whole of the body or not, had begun to be discussed before Aristotle. The so-called 'pangenesis' theory is associated with Democritus and may have originated with him, and it appears in the Hippocratic treatises On Generation (ch. 3) and On Diseases IV (ch. 32), which belong to the group of embryological works which also, interestingly enough, provide us with the first extant record of systematic investigations of the development of the hen's egg (On the Nature of the Child, ch. 29). But biology also provides some good examples of problems which were only recognised as problems after quite extensive research had been done, in particular after the method of dissection had begun to be used fairly widely. Thus it was only after dissections had been carried out on the heart that biologists began to discuss how precisely the blood moves into and out of the vessels of the heart and in the blood-vessels of the body generally.2 And some of the typical problems debated by the Alexan- drian biologists not only required the use of dissection and vivisection to 1 This is the view of Eudemus reported in Simplicius, in Cael. 497, I8 if. 2 Of course even before dissection of the heart had been attempted, there are certain writers, such as Empedocles, who refer to movements of the blood in the body, but they do so in the vaguest terms. The first extant text to refer to the valves of the heart in the context of a description of its general structure is On the Heart (ch. io) which also makes some obscure and fanciful suggestions about the contents of the various vessels of the heart. Thereafter the questions of the functions and contents of the arteries and veins and of the possible intercommunications between them were evidently debated by Herophilus and Erasistratus, although it is Galen that provides us with our first surviving texts in which these problems, together with that of the movement of the blood into and out of the vessels of the heart, are set out and discussed at length (e.g. Nat. Fac. III, chs. I4-I5, Kuhn II, 204 ff.).</page><page sequence="17">Popper v. Kirk: A Controversy in Interpretation of Greek Science 37 be studied, but only emerged as questions to be investigated as a result of knowledge obtained in the first place by the use of those methods.' These few examples already show (I suggest) that there are variations in the relationship between problem-appreciation, theory-construction and programmes of empirical research in different contexts in ancient science. In particular we can distinguish between programmes of empirical research (if we may call them that) that were fairly clearly undertaken with a view to providing data that would confirm or refute a particular theory, and those programmes that reflect not a desire to test a theory, so much as a de- sire to exploit a new scientific technique, such as dissection. Thus when the method of dissection was used systematically, this revealed problems that had not been dreamed of previously, and here it seems to me to make more sense to talk of the observations (not the problems themselves) as the starting-point of scientific progress. But whether or not that is accepted, I may end by observing that even a rapid survey such as this serves to indicate some of the quite striking differences to be found in early Greek science both in the conception of 'the inquiry into nature' and in its practice, and that so far as the historical issues arising out of the controversy between Popper and Kirk are concerned, what are needed are more, and more detailed, case-studies of specific scientific problems in antiquity, to throw further light on the intricate questions of the methods, and methodo- logical assumptions, of early Greek scientists.
