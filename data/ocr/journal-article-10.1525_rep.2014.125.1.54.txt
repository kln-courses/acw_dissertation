<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> CANNON SCHMITT Technical Maturity in Robert Louis Stevenson It is, in some ways, but a pedestrian fancy that the child exhibits. . . .One of a dozen reasons why Robinson Crusoe should be so popular with youth, is that it hits their level in this matter to a nicety; Crusoe was always at makeshifts and had, in so many words, to play at a great variety of professions; and then the book is all about tools, and there is nothing that delights a child so much. —Robert Louis Stevenson, ‘‘Child’s Play’’ (1878)1 A NUMBER OF TECHNICAL LEXICONS about the novel have been developed: narratological, book-historical, sociological, to name only three of the most robust. More difficult to find are accounts, or even exam- ples, of technical language in the novel. Likely reasons for this absence are ready to hand. To begin with the broad category of ‘‘the literary’’: attempts to define such an elusive entity often hinge on contrasting it with the (merely) functional. For example, in a pronouncement that has been embraced far beyond the confines of its Russian Formalist origins, Viktor Shklovsky distinguishes literary from practical language based on ‘‘the per- ception of its structure. The acoustical, articulatory, or semantic aspects of poetic [that is, literary] language may be felt.’’2 The ‘‘literary’’ is marked by an excess or remainder in relation to denotation, as a cognate claim by Paul de Man makes explicit: ‘‘Literature cannot merely be received as a definite unit of referential meaning that can be decoded without leaving a residue. The code is usually conspicuous, complex, and enigmatic.’’3 By implication, lan- guage that is not literary aspires to render the signifier transparent in hopes of providing unmediated access to the signified—an attempt that reaches its apotheosis in manuals like those for assembling Ikea furniture, which omit words entirely in favor of diagrams. Technical language is language on its way to the diagrammatic. Elaborated and deployed for its denotative capacity, it is abstract Technical language in novels, rare in itself, is still more rarely interpreted. Focusing on Robert Louis Stevenson’s bildungsromans, in this essay I argue that a technical maritime lexicon marks their protagonists’ accession to maturity. But that lexicon and the love for the world it attests to and demands also forces a redefinition of what it means to be mature, offering an open, adventurous, never-to-be completed Bildung that refuses the stasis of marriage or a settled profession.

The modern European novel, a form of literary production that developed in conjunction with the increased leisure time and literacy of a burgeoning middle class, could be seen as inhospitable to technical lan- guage from its inception insofar as that language might limit its market appeal, rendering it inaccessible to large swaths of a miscellaneously edu- cated reading public. When we come to the bildungsroman, the subgenre of the novel that is my focus in this essay, the incompatibility between novelistic and technical appears still more absolute. The fundamental cultural work of the novel of maturation is to reconcile individual desire with social necessity.5 Explaining the need for such reconciliation, Franco Moretti invokes Max Weber on ‘‘the ‘tragic’ split that themodernworldhas produced between ‘life’ and ‘profession.’’’6 No longer can one aspire to discover a meaning for one’s life in what one does for a living (or so it seems in this particular emplotment ofmodernity). As a consequence, what is true of the novel generally also holds for the bildungsroman: the complex and ever-diversifying zone of the techni- cal is banished or nearly so. Not that the protagonists of bildungsromans lack a profession; on the contrary, the search for one often proves key. But the more consequential apprenticeship, from at least that of Johann Wolfgang von Goethe’sWilhelm Meister (1795–96) on, is not to this or that line of work but to ‘‘life.’’ Criti- cizing the inadequacy of double-entry bookkeeping on humanistic grounds (‘‘You traders commonly, in your additions and balancings, forget what is the proper net-result of life’’), Wilhelm rejects it along with the mercantile career that requires it.7 But he also eventually leaves behind the theatrical craft that promised a sounder reckoning, ending up elevated above the need for technique altogether, among the aristocrats of the Tower Society. As Moretti further observes: ‘‘To reach the conclusive synthesis of maturity, it is not enough to achieve ‘objective’ results, whatever they may be—learn- ing a trade, establishing a family. One must learn first and foremost . . . to direct ‘the plot of [one’s] life’ so that each moment strengthens one’s sense of belonging to a wider community.’’8 Accordingly, in canonical Victorian examples of the English-language bildungsroman such as Great Expectations (1861) and Jane Eyre (1847), a successful transition to adulthood involves the nebulous accomplishment of social integration, whether by marriage, as in Jane’s case, or penitential return to the once-scorned home place, as in Pip’s.9 It would be absurd to imagine Jane’s maturity marked by, say, fluency in Hindustani, or Pip’s by mastery of marginal utility theory. In Robert Louis Stevenson’s corpus things are different. In those of his novels that can be considered bildungsromans the pivotal incidents involve Technical Maturity in Robert Louis Stevenson 55 </page> <page sequence="3"> the learning and deployment of technical knowledge sedimented in a spe- cialist lexicon. Stevenson’s youthful protagonists, or his not-so-youthful pro- tagonists who have aged without making a place for themselves in the world, achieve a technical maturity. In contrast to the usual trajectory traced by the bildungsroman, the impediments they face are only partly social. Although these characters must, like their numerous predecessors and descendants, negotiate a complex political, legal, and historical world, at decisive junc- tures each also confronts the inhuman, in fact abiotic, forces of winds, waves, and tides, often while also grappling with the recalcitrant technology that is a vessel under sail. Their transition to adulthood is enabled, not by the repression or sublimation of individual desire, but by acquisition of the techniques and accompanying language required for the struggle with such forces. In short, they grow up when they commit to denotation. As a corol- lary, their Bildung is an equivocal one: exempla of arrested development, these characters do not cross over into adulthood so much as hover on its threshold. The maturity they achieve is also technical, then, in the additional sense of being lacking or still in process.10 The proximate, biographical origins of this technical maturity are to be found in Stevenson’s vocational ambivalence, born of having thrown over the family business of marine engineering for fiction writing. But the vexed attitude to the technical as indispensable but potentially insufficient provides critical purchase on the problem of what a novel ought to be at the end of the nineteenth century. Literary history has traditionally valorized the figural, nontechnical, intransitive aspects of novels that might be approached oth- erwise, as though a novel should not do but mean. Even in the case of Foucauldian, Marxist, and New Historicist methodologies for which all texts perform one or another cultural function, they do so implicitly, via dis- course or ideology, which is to say under the guise of doing nothing at all. And literary study as such has insisted that something other, in fact some- thing more, than technical knowledge is at stake. But to grasp Stevenson’s technical maturity and place it in connection with related developments in late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century fiction is to bring into focus another history of the novel and to moot the possibility of an alternative vocation for literary study. That history would take stock of novels engaged with work and the technical, particularly those turn-of-the-century texts that sought to harness fiction as a means, not for transmitting technical knowl- edge as such, but for insisting on what that knowledge requires as its starting point and indispensable concomitant: love for and commitment to the extrafictional world in all its particularity and intractability. That vocation would involve an attempt on the part of literary scholars to realize what I have elsewhere called the facticity of fictional worlds.11 This entails recog- nizing the degree to which fictions—even romance, science fiction, fantasy, 56 Representations </page> <page sequence="4"> and magical realism—are (widely differently) structured by an appeal to such things as geography, physical laws, and the denotative capacity of terms of art. But it also requires attentiveness to the facticity of and in fiction in amore Sartrean sense: the constraints imposed on characters and readers by the thereness or itness of a diegesis.12 Pierres Perdues Out in the North Sea at roughly the same latitude as Dundee, eleven miles east of the Scottish mainland, lies a reef known alternately as Inchcape or the Bell Rock. Submerged for all but the lowest points of the ebb in each tidal cycle, it has been the cause of hundreds, possibly thou- sands, of shipwrecks. The most significant of these for the reef’s subsequent history was the 1804 sinking of HMS York, which went down with a crew of nearly five hundred, none of whom survived. Although direct evidence was lacking, the York was judged to have foundered on the Bell Rock.13 In testimony before a committee of the House of Commons on the need for a light, Robert Stevenson instanced the loss of the York as well as the fact that the Bell Rock lies ‘‘on a track which is annually navigated by no less than 700,000 tons of shipping, besides his Majesty’s ships of war, and revenue cutters.’’14 A bill for a loan to pay for a light was passed in 1806, and the commissioners of the Northern Lighthouses hired Stevenson, who began construction in 1807. Three years later the structure was complete: one hundred and sixteen feet tall, its base awash, still standing after two centu- ries enduring blows from waves with a maximum recorded force in excess of three thousand pounds per square foot, the Bell Rock Lighthouse was painted on commission by J. M. W. Turner in 1819 and, more recently, included together with the Brooklyn Bridge and the Panama Canal in the BBC series The Seven Wonders of the Industrial World (2003).15 Robert Stevenson’s son Thomas designed, built, or assisted in building more than thirty lighthouses himself, and invented a new way of illuminat- ing themmore brightly.16 For three years in the summer and early fall, from 1868 to 1870, Robert Louis Stevenson, Thomas’s son and Robert’s grandson and namesake, was stationed up and down the Scottish coast to begin his study of engineering in the field by observing the construction of harbor works and inspecting existing lighthouses.17 But in the spring of 1871, not long after presenting a paper to the Scottish Royal Society of the Arts, ‘‘On a New Form of Intermittent Light for Lighthouses,’’ he told his father he wanted to be a writer. That desire was not to be satisfied at once; first came reading law at Edinburgh University and then the bar, to which he was admitted in 1875. Nonetheless, engineering was definitively left behind. Technical Maturity in Robert Louis Stevenson 57 </page> <page sequence="5"> The last part of the story is a familiar one, a staple of Stevenson biogra- phies. Jenni Calder opens her still-influential RLS: A Life Study (1980) with it, as though the discussion between father and son on 8 April 1871 were the key to her subject’s entire life.18 Without dwelling on the particulars of what Stevenson’s father and grandfather did for a living, however, neither the magnitude, nor the precise contours, nor the far-reaching implications of his decision to abandon a career in engineering can be appreciated. No garden variety Oedipal rebellion against the paternal script, the refusal to take an appointed place as a marine engineer building public works was tantamount to turning away fromwhat was seen, arguably correctly, as a heroic struggle with colossal and relentless natural forces In Salutem Omnium—the Latin motto of the Northern Lighthouse Trust, which translates into English as ‘‘For the Safety of All.’’19 Stevenson’s letters, essays, and memoirs treat this break in two antithet- ical ways. On one hand, he makes light of the achievements of his forbears, blithely transforming the tools of their trade into raw material for fiction. In an 1888 article in Scribner’s ironically titled ‘‘The Education of an Engineer,’’ he tabulates the results of his fieldwork as follows: ‘‘What I gleaned I am sure I do not know; but indeed I had already my own private determination to be an author; I loved the art of words and the appearances of life; and travellers, and headers, and rubble, and polished ashlar, and pierres perdues, and even the thrilling question of the string-course, interested me only (if they interested me at all) as properties for some possible romance or as words to add to my vocabulary.’’20 Making common cause with his nonspecialist readers, Ste- venson decontextualizes the terminology of marine engineering, repurpos- ing what Joseph Conrad would later call ‘‘the clearness, precision, and beauty of perfected speech’’ into so much sonorous innuendo.21 That he is able to do so gives the lie to Shklovsky’s distinction between literary and practical language because, although eminently practical, to the extent that these terms of art are not readily understood, it is precisely, and perhaps only, their ‘‘acoustical, articulatory, or semantic aspects’’ that ‘‘may be felt.’’ From the outside, technical language is poetry. This is the Stevenson who took the romance side of the realism debate with Henry James and Walter Besant in the mid-1880s, firmly dividing ‘‘life’’ from ‘‘art’’ in ‘‘A Humble Remonstrance’’ (1884) and, in ‘‘A Gossip on Romance’’ (1882), identifying the joy of childhood reading with a volup- tuous immersion in language divorced from meaning: ‘‘The words, if the book be eloquent, should run thenceforward in our ears like the noise of breakers.’’22 One suspects it is also the Stevenson who, in The Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde (1886), depicted staid, hypercompetent professional- ism as papering over or even fostering a monstrous animal appetite for violence and sensual pleasures. It is undoubtedly the Stevenson who, writing 58 Representations </page> <page sequence="6"> from Wick in September 1868 during the first of his three seasons in the field, posed questions that betrayed what must have been, for the formida- ble father who was to answer them, a maddeningly cavalier attitude to the factual: ‘‘What is the weight of a square foot of salt water?’’ the seventeen- year-old scion of a gifted and determined family of marine engineers ingen- uously inquired; ‘‘and how many lbs are there to a ton?’’23 Stevenson the bohemian, the romancer, the author of light fiction, the European wanderer in the South Pacific: the figure is familiar, not least because of his own efforts to construct it in essays, prefaces, and letters. But there is another Stevenson, one with a suspicion that pierres perduesmight be valuable for more than their potential as properties in a romance. Here he is in a letter to his friend William H. Low written from Samoa on 15 January 1894: ‘‘I think of the Renaissance fellows, and their all-round human suffi- ciency, and compare it with the ineffable smallness of the field in which we labour and in which we do so little. . . . I ought to have been able to build lighthouses and write David Balfours too. Hinc illae lachrymae [hence those tears].’’24 In the same self-deprecating vein, a poem from the 1887 collec- tion Underwoods proposes the most generous estimate of his writing should view it as a ‘‘childish task’’ to which ‘‘a strenuous family,’’ having completed its adult, daytime work, ‘‘addressed its evening hours.’’25 Or again, in the unfin- ished and posthumously published Records of a Family of Engineers (1924), Stevenson recounts of his father: On Tweedside, or by Lyne or Manor, we have spent together whole afternoons; to me, at the time, extremely wearisome; to him, as I am now sorry to think, bitterly mortifying. The river was to me a pretty and various spectacle; I could not see—I could not be made to see—it otherwise. To my father it was a chequer-board of lively forces, which he traced from pool to shallow with minute appreciation and endur- ing interest. . . .Thus he pored over the engineer’s voluminous handy-book of nature; thus must, too, have pored my grand-father and uncles.26 The Underwoods poem’s distinction between two kinds of task, infantile and adult, is here refigured as a distinction between two modes of vision, one restricted to the surface (recalling the reference to ‘‘the appearances of life’’ in ‘‘The Education of an Engineer’’) and appropriate to aesthetics, the other penetrating and appropriate to mechanics and physics. Stevenson laments that he ‘‘could not be made’’ to adopt the latter. In Robert Louis Stevenson in the Pacific (2009), Roslyn Jolly adduces moments such as these to substantiate the contention that Stevenson expe- rienced a ‘‘sense of his own inadequacy in comparison to his father’s [and, it should be added, perhaps more sharply his grandfather’s] achievements.’’27 She treats 1887, the year of his father’s death and the year before he was to depart for the Pacific, as the beginning of a new phase in his career when he Technical Maturity in Robert Louis Stevenson 59 </page> <page sequence="7"> tried to make writing matter in the way engineering does: as a means to have a direct effect on reality. Jolly finds the results of this ‘‘new sense of writing as action in the world’’ in travel narratives and in political letters to the Times about the condition of Samoa.28 ‘‘In a way,’’ she writes, proposing a moment of close congruity between writer and engineer, son and father, grandson and grandfather, ‘‘the letters to the Times were his lighthouses, works of professional skill and public service.’’29 Jolly’s compelling and meticulously researched study complicates received ideas about Stevenson, documenting a late turn to nonfiction as a form of interventionist, activist writing. But it is possible to go still further in this revision by noting that Stevenson was always interested in the connec- tions between writing and action in the world, before and after 1887, and in his fiction no less than his nonfiction. Barry Menikoff has demonstrated, for instance, the intensity and seriousness of Stevenson’s engagement with Scot- tish history in a book such as Kidnapped (1886), arguing that he parlayed that engagement into an exploration of ‘‘how the law of the state was utilized for ends that had nothing to do with justice and everything to do with the pres- ervation of power.’’30 Still, the novels are not exactly his lighthouses, despite requiring professional skill and sometimes conceived of as public service. FromTreasure Island (1881–82) on, Stevenson’s fiction does not betray a wish to transmute writing into either engineering or activism. Rather, in its pages technical knowledge and the necessity for possessing it and putting it to work prove central to plots and characters as well as to readers’ experience. If the fictions are not lighthouses or even manuals for building lighthouses, they are instead manuals for how to adopt an attitude to the world appropriate to engineers and sailors, representative grown-ups in Stevenson’s world. They are richly connotative and figurative paeans to the denotative, the literal, and the technical. Paradoxically, given its superficial resemblance to the stratagems of one or another version of literary realism, just this devotion to the literal and technical—the insistence on including maps in novels, on giving the precise coordinates in longitude and latitude for the location of imaginary islands, on forcing readers to work through maritime terminology and Scots dialect unaided by notes or glossaries—is undoubtedly part of what has kept Ste- venson from being granted the stature of a great Victorian novelist.31 Ian Duncan, discussing that slight, has gone so far as to state that ‘‘Stevenson, however brilliant an author of prose fiction, did not write novels.’’ He explains the soundness of this deliberately perverse claim by adding the clarification that ‘‘he did not write ‘novels’ according to the ways in which the genre came to be defined, and its aesthetic norms established, in the retrospective view of twentieth-century criticism.’’32 Seen as a failing, as many have seen it, the refusal to produce a Victorian novel along recognized 60 Representations </page> <page sequence="8"> lines has condemned Stevenson to the status of a second-rate artist at best. Recognized as a canny strategy, as Duncan suggests it must have been, it demonstrates that Stevenson’s fictions function as critiques of the novel as usual—of its form, its dominant ideologies, the contours of the world that it bodies forth in its pages. From one angle that critique looks like a departure, a move away from the three-volume, multiplot novel and toward modernism; from another it may just as productively be understood as a return. Thinking about the technical in particular, Stevenson’s dissent from the canons of mid- Victorian novelistic production enables him to revisit and develop a signal aspect of the novel as incarnated in an early eighteenth-century text like Daniel Defoe’s Robinson Crusoe (1719): a focus not on character interiority but on character exteriority, a character’s ability to get something done in the world of the fiction—to act, and act effectively. As Stevenson points out in the section of his essay ‘‘Child’s Play’’ from which I have taken my epigraph, ‘‘Crusoe was always at makeshifts and had, in somany words, to play at a great variety of professions; and then the book is all about tools.’’ Jury-rigging, trying out multiple professions, attention lavished on tools and the techni- cal: these are characteristics that Robinson Crusoe shares with what Stevenson elsewhere calls romance, which he describes as fiction ‘‘where the interest turns, not upon what a man shall choose to do, but on how he manages to do it; not on the passionate slips and hesitations of the conscience, but on the problems of the body and of the practical intelligence.’’33 In her remarkable The Novel and the Sea, Margaret Cohen treats maritime fiction as the exemplary form of the sort of novel intimately bound up in ‘‘the problems of the body and of the practical intelligence.’’ For Cohen that fiction, beginning with Robinson Crusoe itself, is above all about work and committed to modes of narration that compel characters and readers alike to immerse themselves in the techniques and terminology of the work of sailing. Maritime fiction is therefore less concerned with achieving a ‘‘plau- sibility of mimesis’’ than a ‘‘plausibility of performance,’’ description that convincingly renders successful action in situations of crisis.34 Understand- ing how things work, knowing how to make them work to achieve something in the world: these practical, manual, technical concerns become, in Cohen’s revised history of the novel, as much a part of the European and North American novelistic tradition as psychological realism’s nuanced parsing of desire, affect, and motive. Stevenson’s bildungsromans unfold as a series of trials in which, as he claims about romance and as Cohen claims about maritime fiction, the point is how the protagonist ‘‘manages to do it’’: to escape from a tidal island, prevent a schooner from being blown out to sea, convincingly imper- sonate a first mate. But in each case characters’ performance under duress is Technical Maturity in Robert Louis Stevenson 61 </page> <page sequence="9"> linked to ‘‘what a man shall choose to do’’—in fact, to the question of whether and in what circumstances choice is actually possible. Thus, although some of these texts have been dismissed as sheer fantasy and others celebrated as gritty realism (as well as vice versa), all are hybrid fictions that turn the ‘‘how’’ of child’s play into the decisive step in accom- modating oneself to the world and, more surprisingly, the world to one- self.35 Mikhail Bakhtin distinguishes between most types of bildungsroman, which involve a protagonist who emerges in relation to a static world, and a ‘‘fifth and last type’’ in which the protagonist ‘‘emerges along with the world and . . . reflects the historical emergence of the world itself.’’36 Stevenson’s novels of education and growth can be seen as instances of this last type, with the proviso that they add to the protagonist’s ability to reflect the world the ability to affect it, an ability born of affection for it. To develop, one must learn to change the world; to change the world, one must know it and the names for its parts; to know it, one must love it: so runs the credo of these fictions. Making a Sweetheart of One’s Compass Of the three Stevenson texts I’ll treat in some detail, Kidnapped most closely approximates to a conventional bildungsroman. Just as Walter Scott does in Waverley (1814), Stevenson sends his protagonist, David Bal- four, on an expedition into the alien territory of the Scottish Highlands. A Lowlander and not, like Edward Waverley, an Englishman, David none- theless initially shows a similar ignorance of Highland conditions and mores and eventually arrives at a similar regard for them. Education thus structures Kidnapped in its entirety—not an amorphously conceived education in the ways of the world but a specific education in the particularities of Highland life.37 Already, then, the familiar plan of the bildungsroman has been altered by way of a detour through the assimilation of ethnographic details that cannot possibly be considered universally necessary for maturation. But the more curious departure has to do with the novel’s tracing of a properly technical apprenticeship in the properties of, and nomenclature associated with, vessels under sail, reefs, currents, and tides. Coming to understand and name such phenomena plays a fundamental role in David’s transition to adulthood, something indicated by the nature of his first-person narration. The adult narrators of first-person retrospective bildungsromans typically achieve distance from their childlike selves with interpolations from the narrating present into the narrated past that emphasize the fuller perspective they have acquired since the events being 62 Representations </page> <page sequence="10"> narrated. Early in Great Expectations, for instance, Pip comments on his impression of a hulk anchored in the Medway: ‘‘Cribbed and barred and moored by massive rusty chains, the prison-ship seemed in my young eyes to be ironed like the prisoner.’’38 Pip manages to have his anthropomorphism and disavow it too: the evocative description of a hulk as ‘‘ironed like the prisoner’’ (that is, Abel Magwitch) is achieved at the same time that the adult narrator censures its metaphoricity as a youthful perceptual error. According to the early sections of Great Expectations, to be a child is to be at the mercy of the figural (above all, to be in thrall to the pathetic fallacy); part of growing up involves learning to use the figural for one’s own ends, an ability that the narrated Pip lacks at the outset but comes to possess over the course of the novel. Notable about Kidnapped is the degree to which such interpolations on the part of the older, narrating David differentiate past from present, child from adult, on the basis of technical knowledge, particularly technical knowledge about the sea and seafaring. For example: after his uncle Ebe- nezer, having failed to kill him, arranges for him to be kidnapped and sold into slavery, David comments not on the revelation provided as to the treachery of other people, the unforeseeable contingencies of fate, or the difference between the literal and the metaphorical but on the course of the Covenanter, the brig in which he is being held against his will: ‘‘I could see the sunset still quite bright. This, at such an hour of the night, surprised me greatly; but I was too ignorant to draw the true conclusion—that we were going north-about round Scotland, and were now on the high sea between the Orkney and the Shetland Islands, having avoided the dangerous cur- rents of the Pentland Firth.’’39 To be an adult, the older David suggests, is to know how to navigate. A closely related conclusion is implied by his account of being thrown overboard when the Covenanter is wrecked on the Torran Rocks, an area of submerged reefs interspersed among small islands located due south of the Ross of Mull in western Scotland. He is saved from drown- ing less by his own exertions than by a tidal current, as he explains at length while once more providing retrospective clarification: While I was hailing the brig, I spied a tract of water lying between us, where no great waves came, but which yet boiled white all over and bristled in the moon with rings and bubbles. . . .What it was I had no guess, which for the time increased my fear of it; but I now know it must have been the roost or tide race, which had carried me away so fast and tumbled me about so cruelly, and at last, as if tired of that play, had flung out me and the spare yard [to which David clung] upon its landward margin. (K, 89) Long before Bruno Latour’s theorization of distributed agency, Stevenson takes pains to dramatize the power of abiotic forces in codetermining how Technical Maturity in Robert Louis Stevenson 63 </page> <page sequence="11"> the life of the individual unfolds. In a world where such forces have as much control over one’s fate as do one’s own actions, arriving at correct nomen- clature is essential to growing up. More essential still is learning how things work. The pivotal episode of Kidnapped understood as a bildungsroman immediately follows on the wreck of the Covenanter. The tide race washes David ashore on a small island: Earraid, where Stevenson himself lived for a time in 1870 during part of the building of Dhu Heartach (or Dubh Artach), a lighthouse constructed by Stevenson’s father and uncle, David Stevenson, to prevent real-world vessels from following the fictional Covenanter to the bottom.40 In sight of the mainland but unable to swim across to it, David nearly starves to death even though, he observes, ‘‘It seemed impossible that I should be left to die on the shores of my own country, and within view of a church tower and the smoke of men’s houses’’ (K, 94). That he is nearly so left is due to the fact that the fishermen who pass close by only laugh at his desperate cries for help and sail away again, as though for their part they thought it impossible that anyone hailing them from Earraid would not know that at low tide the island becomes a peninsula and can be left on foot. But the fishermen return the next day and with only three words of comprehensible English interspersed among their Scots Gaelic—‘‘what- ever,’’ ‘‘yes,’’ and ‘‘tide’’—convey the open secret of the island’s tidal nature. David reflects on his escape as follows: A sea-bred boy would not have stayed a day on Earraid; which is only what they call a tidal islet, and except in the bottom of the neaps, can be entered and left twice in every twenty-four hours, either dry-shod, or at the most by wading. Even I, who had the tide going out and in before me in the bay, and even watched for the ebbs, the better to get my shell-fish—even I (I say) if I had sat down to think, instead of raging at my fate, must have soon guessed the secret, and got free. (K, 98) Tidal islet, the bottom of the neaps, twice in every twenty-four hours, ebbs: the passage fairly bristles with technical marine terminology and knowledge, emphasiz- ing the difference between a boy who nearly dies of starvation when he can easily walk to safety and a knowledgeable man looking back on his own earlier tragicomic ignorance. But these reflections also reveal that the terms themselves are not of the essence: escape requires only a basic understand- ing of the tidal cycle as it affects Earraid, which the narrating David claims his younger, narrated self could have come to unaided if only for the right approach: ‘‘if I had sat down to think, instead of raging at my fate.’’41 The Earraid episode of Kidnapped opens with a technical failure: a ship- wreck attendant on the inability to navigate successfully. Punctuated by humans’ subjection to natural forces and an intrusion from the retrospective narrator about the names for those forces, it turns at last on a simple but 64 Representations </page> <page sequence="12"> potentially fatal failure of understanding—a failure echoed and intensified by a scene of mutually incomprehensible languages and knowledge sets. Reso- lution comes in the form of a tidal epiphany. The Appin murder, the flight across the heather with Alan ‘‘Breck’’ Stewart, the return to the family estate of Shaws to defeat his uncle: all this remains to be narrated. Yet success at all is enabled by success on Earraid, not because of any concrete knowledge gained but because of the conviction that such knowledge is necessary and the embrace of an attitude that will make it possible.42 The question of an appropriate attitude toward life returns in the late Pacific novella The Ebb-Tide (1894), with the crucial addition of the necessity not simply of attention or commitment to the checkerboard of forces that make up the world but of love for it. The Ebb-Tide’s first sentence, almost shocking to a reader fresh from Kidnapped, runs: ‘‘Throughout the island world of the Pacific, scattered men of many European races and from almost every grade of society carry activity and disseminate disease.’’43 The rest of the novella develops the grim expose ́ of Europeans’ presence in the Pacific promised by this opening, centering on three such ‘‘scattered men’’: Huish, a depraved Cockney; Davis, a disgraced American ship’s captain; and Her- rick, Oxford-educated but otherwise a universal failure. All three, but par- ticularly Herrick, through whom the narrative is largely focalized, instantiate the metaphorical decline broached in the novella’s title and its epigraph, the latter taken from Brutus’s speech to Cassius in the fourth act of Shakespeare’s Julius Caesar, which begins ‘‘There is a tide in the affairs of men.’’44 At the outset Herrick, in an echo of David’s predicament on Ear- raid, finds himself near starvation in Tahiti. ‘‘In the telling South Sea phrase,’’ the narrator reports, he was ‘‘on the beach’’: washed up, without a source of support or the prospect of one, the result of repeated and repeatedly unsuccessful attempts to make a place for himself. The narrator identifies the cause in a terse diagnosis: ‘‘Bearing no interest in his duties, he brought no attention’’ (ET, 124, 125). The first half of the novella chronicles a final effort to avert death or imprisonment: the theft of a schooner accom- plished with his two equally down-and-out companions. Early in that effort the role to be played by the technical can be glimpsed when Herrick, intro- duced to the South Pacific crew of the schooner as first mate, must start giving commands. Quickly exhausting the vocabulary that can be derived from ‘‘his reminiscences of sea romance,’’ he whispers an urgent request to Davis: ‘‘For Heaven’s sake, tell me some of the words’’ (ET, 155, 156). Again, however, the words themselves are not the point. At issue, rather, is the close observation, commitment, and care that a technical lexicon such as nautical terminology requires and bears witness to. Herrick lacks not correct terminology but ‘‘interest’’ and ‘‘attention.’’ Thus the narrator’s account of his first watch aboard the schooner as it crosses open water: Technical Maturity in Robert Louis Stevenson 65 </page> <page sequence="13"> He took two steps forward and remembered his dead reckoning. ‘‘How has she been heading?’’ he thought; and he flushed from head to foot. He had not observed or had forgotten; here was the old incompetence; the slate must be filled up by guess. ‘‘Never again!’’ he vowed to himself in silent fury, ‘‘never again. It shall be no fault of mine if this miscarry.’’ And for the remainder of his watch, he . . . read the face of the compass as perhaps he had never read a letter from his sweetheart. (ET, 164) Although spelled as though it were a synonym for ‘‘deceased,’’ dead derives from deduced: dead reckoning is a mode of navigation in which a vessel’s speed and heading, the elapsed time of a given leg of its journey, and the effects of winds or currents are taken into account to arrive at an estimate as to the path of its movement over the surface of the water. Learning this navigational technique but, more crucially, adopting an attitude of passion- ate love for the world and for the denotative that tries to point to that world stands as the necessary beginning to Herrick’s process of extricating himself from ‘‘the old incompetence,’’ cause and symptom of an inability to grow up. To read the face of the compass as he had never read a letter from his sweetheart: this is devotion, and not to a bald, self-evident fact but, as in the case of love letters as well, to facts or data as they figure in a complex process of interpretation.45 Technical language, technical knowledge, and devotion to the denoted figure centrally in Kidnapped and The Ebb-Tide. The most elaborate medita- tion on the technical and its place in a protagonist’s Bildung appears, how- ever, in Treasure Island, which at first glance seems to reverse the values evident in the other texts. At the end of the opening section of the novel, Jim Hawkins takes the map of the eponymous island to the local landowner, Squire Trelawney, and another representative of the ruling classes, Doctor Livesey, who together outfit an expedition to recover the buried treasure to which the map provides directions. But Trelawney makes for a flawed mem- ber of the squirearchy: Treasure Island lampoons his penchant for literal interpretation in a lengthy exchange he has with Captain Smollett, whom he has hired to command the schooner Hispaniola. (When Smollett expresses dislike for the fact that the secret of the treasure ‘‘has been told to the parrot,’’ for example, Trelawney asks: ‘‘Silver’s parrot?’’46) That Tre- lawney has evidently paid too much for the Hispaniola and inadvertently signed on an assortment of pirates to serve as crew indicates some of the implied consequences of this literal-mindedness. The novel also questions the use of terms of art in contexts that don’t require them, as when Doctor Livesey, having briefly taken over the narration from Jim Hawkins, gives the time as ‘‘about half-past one’’ before needlessly adding: ‘‘three bells in the sea phrase’’ (TI, 99). This kind of affectation strips away rather than adds meaning, an insight conveyed more pointedly by way of Silver’s parrot itself, named Captain Flint, whose shrieked command ‘‘Stand by to go about’’ 66 Representations </page> <page sequence="14"> produces technical language devoid of intentionality or application (TI, 65).47 Literal interpretation is misinterpretation; nautical terminology, gib- berish: such appears to be the judgement of this novel, a judgement per- fectly suited to the Stevenson who wrote that the specialized terms requisite to designing and building lighthouses ‘‘interested me only (if they inter- ested me at all) as properties for some possible romance.’’ In Treasure Island, however, the attack on the misapplication of the literal and technical allows for a nuanced consideration of their right uses. When first reading the map of the island, for instance, the instructions for finding the treasure, given in compass bearings and fathoms, are ‘‘incom- prehensible’’ to Jim even as they ‘‘filled the squire and Dr. Livesey with delight’’ (TI, 44). Being unable to understand the import of ‘‘bearing a point to the N. of N. N. E.’’ means being blind to the world and the possibilities it contains. Accordingly, Jim’s tutelage by Long John Silver focuses on the ways of the sea and begins on their first outing together: ‘‘On our little walk along the [Bristol] quays, he made himself the most interesting companion, telling me about the different ships that we passed by, their rig, their ton- nage, and nationality, and explaining the work that was going forward . . . ; and every now and then telling me some little anecdote of ships or seamen, or repeating a nautical phrase till I had learned it perfectly’’ (TI, 55–56). Jim’s prevention of a massacre by the pirates is enabled by his ability to make sense of overheard talk, which he comments on by noting: ‘‘By this time I had begun to understand the meaning of their terms’’ (TI, 69). Moreover, like David Balfour’s in Kidnapped, Jim’s retrospective narration marks his accession to adulthood by putting to use a wide range of nautical terminol- ogy, from a description of the Hispaniola at anchor in still water as mirrored ‘‘from the truck to the water-line’’ to the offhand observation that an espe- cially tall tree ‘‘might have been entered as a sailing mark upon the chart’’ (TI, 134, 195). Quite distinct from Dr. Livesey’s gratuitous use of nautical terms, the correct deployment of ‘‘truck’’ and the quick estimate of a land feature’s suitability for use as a sailing mark function in the novel as confir- mation that the Jim who tells the tale has outgrown his younger self. As in both Kidnapped and The Ebb-Tide, in Treasure Island that confirma- tion is encapsulated in an episode of effective action combined with appro- priate use of technical language: Jim’s reclaiming of the Hispaniola, which is captured by the pirates soon after the expedition drops anchor. Extending over several chapters in the fifth section of the novel, ‘‘My Sea Adventure,’’ the episode is condensed to its essence in a final decisive act. Having boarded the Hispaniola; sailed it to safety under the direction the sole sur- viving pirate left on board to guard it, Israel Hands; run it aground; then killed Hands, Jim suddenly perceives that he must do something to prevent the schooner from being blown back out to sea. Technical Maturity in Robert Louis Stevenson 67 </page> <page sequence="15"> I began to see a danger to the ship. The jibs I speedily doused and brought tumbling to the deck; but the main-sail was a harder matter. Of course, when the schooner canted over, the boom had swung out-board, and the cap of it and a foot or two of sail hung even under the water. I thought this made it still more dangerous; yet the strain was so heavy that I half feared to meddle. At last, I got my knife and cut the halyards. The peak dropped instantly, a great belly of loose canvas floated broad upon the water; and since, pull as I liked, I could not budge the downhaul; that was the extent of what I could accomplish. For the rest, theHispaniolamust trust to luck, like myself. (TI, 160–61) Like polished ashlar or string-course to the nonengineer, or ebbs and the bottom of the neaps to those unfamiliar with tides, to the nonsailor the words canted, boom, cap, halyards, peak, and downhaul are either sheer sensuous pleasure or nonsense to be skimmed or skipped. Further, even if not fully understood, they contribute to novelistic verisimilitude. Like the pseudonym under which the serial version of Treasure Island was published, Captain George North, they lend credibility to the fictional world being constructed. But if one does understand them, or takes the trouble to look them up and think them through, they also denote: they describe a problem a ship that has been deliberately run aground might reasonably face and perfectly realize in prose one solution to that problem. In doing so they do not establish the verisimilitude of the diegesis so much as attest to the dual capacity of the intradiegetic narrator at once to solve that problem and to use the language requisite to narrating the solution. Viewed thus, the advent of these technical terms in the narrative marks a moment of Bildung achieved in the present of the doing and confirmed in the retrospect of the telling, a moment that requires and provides evidence of a devotion to the recalcitrant, the partic- ular, the actual. Elsewhere, ‘‘Reader, I married him’’; in Stevenson, ‘‘The jibs I speedily doused.’’ Lifted Up by Circumstance, As by a Breaking Wave Eighteenth- and nineteenth-century maritime fiction regularly features such moments of effective action, part and parcel of what Cohen anatomizes as a ‘‘poetics of adventure [wrought] from themariner’s ethos of craft and its representation in the maritime book.’’48 To choose one from among countless instances: the first-person narrator of The Coral Island (1858), written by Stevenson’s fellow Edinburghian R. M. Ballantyne and one of the inspirations for Treasure Island, makes much of his self-taught abilities in rigging and navigation.49 But Stevenson’s texts, unique in the degree to which they freight technical accomplishment with the burden of characters’ maturation, are also distinctive in their pairing of the poetics of 68 Representations </page> <page sequence="16"> adventure with a sustained interrogation of the possibilities of action and choice. We can begin to canvas the issues involved by noting a taxonomy Stevenson ventures in ‘‘A Gossip on Romance.’’ ‘‘The pleasure that we take in life,’’ he proclaims, ‘‘is of two sorts—the active and the passive. Now we are conscious of a great command over our destiny; anon we are lifted up by circumstance, as by a breaking wave, and dashed we know not how into the future.’’50 In context, the distinction allows Stevenson to develop his defense of romance, the form of writing that gives the latter pleasure, as a bona fide alternative to the dictates of drama and realist fiction, both of which are understood to turn on questions of conduct and morals, ques- tions of active choice. Brought to bear on the bildungsromans, the same distinction reveals them to be novels whose exploration of technical and terminological prowess is punctuated by moments of compromised or unconscious agency. Split between active and passive pleasures, they bear witness to the double teaching of the technical: on one hand, that the world approached aright can be managed, made to work; on the other, that the forces involved dwarf the human ability to control or oppose them. One might say: the technical as action—mastery; the technical as knowledge— subjection. Little wonder, then, that both of the English bildungsroman’s polarized alternatives—either triumphant bending of the world to one’s will (Jane Eyre) or diminished capitulation to how things are (Great Expectations)—are found wanting. Instead, an impasse is arrived at that clarifies the entailments for human agency of devotion to the technical. ‘‘Mr Betwixt-and-Between,’’ Alan Breck’s nickname for David, well applies to all three of Stevenson’s protagonists insofar as none ends up unambiguously victorious or van- quished. For either ending would require endorsing one or another of the incommensurable but simultaneously true teachings of the love of the world: that the individual can be more powerful or canny than the forces the world deploys; that those forces are always and everywhere more pow- erful than the individual. So far I have stressed the former, since it is fun- damental to the appeal of the technical for Stevenson as well as for his protagonists. Each of the texts under consideration, however, is equally engaged with probing the limits of agency, often in scenes where action takes place in the absence of intent or self-knowledge. In Treasure Island, Jim disclaims responsibility for killing Israel Hands: ‘‘In the horrid pain and surprise of the moment—I scarce can say it was by my own volition, and I am sure it was without conscious aim—both my pistols went off’’ (TI, 158).51 In Kidnapped, David unthinkingly sides with Alan against the captain and crew of the Covenanter: ‘‘I have no credit by it,’’ he insists; ‘‘it was by no choice of mine, but as if by compulsion’’ (K, 62). Such unconscious, unwilled action occurs at precisely those junctures on which subsequent events hinge entirely, Technical Maturity in Robert Louis Stevenson 69 </page> <page sequence="17"> where clear-eyed intervention would signal the taking of command over one- self and one’s life. The Ebb-Tide most illuminatingly treats the interimplication of agency and the technical. With a single exception (about which more later), none of the characters in the novella finds himself capable of resisting the down- ward pull of the metaphorical ebb, whether that pull takes the shape of alcoholism, fate, or other people. The critique of imperialism implied in the novella’s first sentence, for instance, becomes explicit in the subsequent treatment of South Sea islanders, one of whom befriends Herrick and tells ‘‘his simple and hard story of exile, suffering, and injustice among cruel whites’’ (ET, 167). Part of that story relates how, as crew on a ship com- manded by drunken Europeans sailing haphazardly around the Pacific, he and his shipmates, ‘‘seeing themselves lost on the huge deep with their insane conductors, . . .had drunk deep of terror’’ (ET, 169). Herrick him- self, although suffering under no external compulsion, nonetheless inevi- tably fails at what he attempts. ‘‘He did not drink,’’ states the narrator, ‘‘he was exactly honest, he was never rude to his employers, yet was everywhere discharged. . . .His day was a tissue of things neglected and things done amiss; and from place to place and from town to town, he carried the reputation of one thoroughly incompetent’’ (ET, 125–26). He, too, like the crew he finds himself among, is ‘‘lost on the huge deep’’: modern life assumes the shape of an unnavigable ocean, with Herrick himself occupying the role of insane conductor. Explaining this predicament in a farewell letter to his fiance ́e, Herrick provides the sharpest formulation of the prob- lem with agency as The Ebb-Tide represents it: ‘‘I know, had I chosen, that I might have done well; and yet I swear to you I tried to choose’’ (ET, 140). Trying to choose: the odd locution conveys not a deterministic world in which no choice is possible but a world in which one could make a choice but somehow doesn’t. Human agency is turned from a simple into a com- pound problem: yes, the novella confirms, individuals can influence their own destinies—but to do so requires an effort it is generally impossible to make, and in the absence of that effort those destinies are carried this way or that by the metaphorical tides. But there are also literal—or perhaps I should say less metaphorical— tides in The Ebb-Tide. Early in the novella Herrick proposes to Davis that they end their suffering by drowning themselves. Much later he actually makes the attempt, slipping into the water with the intention of sinking beneath it. But suicide, too, turns out to be a choice he tries to make but cannot. Unable to stop swimming and let himself drown but unwilling to head in any particular direction, he suffers a fate determined by the tide: ‘‘About three in the morning, chance, and the set of the [tidal] current, and the bias of his own right-handed body, so decided it between them that he came to 70 Representations </page> <page sequence="18"> shore upon the beach’’ (ET, 229). We could and should insist that, like the tides of the title and epigraph, this tide is figurative, standing in for one of the various numinous forces that give shape to the lives of Stevenson’s characters. One aspect of a multifaceted oceanic motif, this tide can, strictly speaking, be an actual one as little as anything else in the diegetic world of a work of narrative fiction can be, which is to say not at all.52 Still, it is, if you like, a different kind of figure from that of the title and epigraph. Distinct from several other tides in The Ebb-Tide, this one denotes first and foremost—denotes a concrete, quantifiable, not-so-numinous entity beyond human control that can, given certain circumstances, determine human success or failure.53 At the same time, in a stinging rebuke to fictions that, like Robinson Crusoe, lionize the ability to bend circumstances to one’s wishes, Stevenson documents the horrors of a world in which any human agent holds unre- sisted sway. Whence my earlier reference to the single character in The Ebb- Tide who remains indifferent to tidal ebbs and flows: despotic ruler of his own private pearling island, that character, Attwater, need not ‘‘try to choose.’’ Choice itself, which requires more than one possible course of action, seems an erroneous term in connection with someone who effort- lessly resists compulsion from within and without, including his sexual attraction to a woman among the islanders under his control, the smallpox that decimates his kidnapped Pacific work force, and the attempt to kill him made by Huish and Davis. What’s more, his prowess is not simply of the negative sort, since he also achieves all he attempts. In the most telling instance, as he boasts and as events subsequently confirm, he is a crack shot whose bullets never miss their mark. A Titan of human agency whose Cal- vinism abolishes the distinction between his own will and the will of God, Attwater stands as an object lesson in the dark side of choosing successfully, of usurping the role of wind, wave, and tide as shaper of one’s life as well as the lives of others.54 Child’s Play The turn of the century witnessed the publication of several novels that repeat the lineaments of Treasure Island, Kidnapped, and The Ebb-Tide in a bid to yoke growing up to the technical. In Rudyard Kipling’s Captains Courageous (1897), the petulantly boyish Harvey Cheyne, plucked from the water after being washed from the deck of a steamer, undergoes an education in sailing and cod fishing that prepares him to take his place as a captain of industry.55 In Jack London’s The Sea-Wolf (1904), the first-person narrator, Humphrey van Weyden, delineates the teachings of the brutal sealing-schooner captain Wolf Larsen: ‘‘He had opened up for me the world Technical Maturity in Robert Louis Stevenson 71 </page> <page sequence="19"> of the real, of which I had known practically nothing and from which I had always shrunk. I had learned to look more closely at life as it was lived, to recognize that there were such things as facts in the world, to emerge from the realm of mind and idea and to place certain values on the concrete and objective phases of existence.’’56 In both, protagonists initially portrayed as weak and solipsistic are, in one way or another, kidnapped: their apprentice- ships to life at sea are not voluntary, and they must find themselves by finding their way through a welter of rebarbative terminology and ill-comprehended physical forces. The bildungsroman of technical maturity reaches its ne plus ultra in Erskine Childers’s The Riddle of the Sands (1903). Like Stevenson, Kipling, and London, Childers figures meaningful Bildung as necessarily accom- plished through painful acquisition of manual skills, technical knowledge, and a specialized lexicon. Whereas technical details punctuate his prede- cessors’ novels at a few pivotal moments, however, they take over vast por- tions of The Riddle of the Sands. Chapter after chapter reports minutely on the amount and kind of precipitation, wind speed and direction, and water depth at flood and ebb, as well as providing a recapitulation of sailing man- euvres so precise that what purports to be novelistic prose often resembles nothing so much as a series of extracts from a ship’s log.57 Paratexts prolif- erate: outdoing Stevenson at his own game in this as well, Childers includes not just one map (as Stevenson does in Treasure Island and Kidnapped) but three—and throws in two charts for good measure.58 The maps and charts, the data on water depths and tidal patterns among the Frisian Islands: these, along with a mysterious German propensity for flat-bottomed boats, com- prise the riddle of the title, the answer to which is a planned German inva- sion of Britain across the North Sea. Already one face of the future of spy fiction can be discerned: Ian Fleming’s James Bond, whose mania for high-tech gadgets desublimates devotion to the technical and whose battles against foreign villains solve the problem of agency as it appears in Stevenson by stripping opposition from the natural world and installing it in a malevolent human one. Uncannily proleptic, The Riddle of the Sands sheds retrospective light as well. The book is carefully framed as a bildungsroman: Carruthers, the novel’s narrator and protagonist, begins trivial and self-pitying; Davies, the consummate sailor who summons Carruthers for help, remakes him—confirmation of which remaking comes, inevitably, in an announcement of love for the practical: ‘‘The Dulcibella [Davies’s cutter] faced the storm as doggedly as ever, plunging her bowsprit into the sea and flinging green water over the bows. A wave of confidence and affection for her welled throughme. I had been used to resent the weight and bulk of her unwieldy anchor and cable, but I saw their use now; varnish, paint, spotless decks, and snowy sails were foppish absurdities of 72 Representations </page> <page sequence="20"> a hateful past.’’59 Equally inevitably, the maturity to which this love attests is an unfinished one. Carruthers grows but he doesn’t grow up. In some measure this is because both he and Davies are amateurs: Carruthers is on holiday from an ineffectual Foreign Office; Davies has failed his Indian Civil Service exam. Their spying is thus ‘‘child’s play,’’ to return to my epigraph, because it resists the stasis of the career. When Stevenson attributes Robinson Crusoe’s popularity with children to the fact that ‘‘Crusoe was always at makeshifts and had, in so many words, to play at a great variety of professions,’’ he conceives of adulthood as that time when playing at professions in the plural comes to an end and earnestly adopting one in the singular begins. Espionage, even when, as for Bond, it is a career, encompasses all careers, drawing its appeal from childhood games of dress- up and omni-competence. In still larger measure, however, the unfinished nature of Carruthers’s and Davies’s maturity derives from the fact that their romance is with the sea, their boat, and one another. True, the novel’s single subplot involves Davies’s pursuit of the daughter of Herr Dollman, a traitorous Englishman in league with the Germans. Notably, however, it was entirely absent from early drafts. Childers’s sister Dulcibella (whose name he gave to Davies’s boat) initially suggested it be added; on reading the manuscript, his pub- lisher Reginald Smith requested still more of it.60 But even in the published work it remains muted and tangential, pertaining not to the protagonist but to his mentor and incapable of disguising either the characters’ or the author’s real passion, on display in every page thick with compass bearings and weather reports. Technical maturity is also, then, in Childers as well as in Stevenson, ‘‘child’s play’’ insofar as it stands counter to the fixity to which a terminal wedding attests in the conventional bildungsroman. The incomplete nature of technical maturity results from the displacement of heterosexual romance by romance with the world. To read the compass as one has never read a letter from one’s sweetheart, to mark one’s achievement of adult- hood by the announcement not of a wedding but of the saving of a schooner: such moments crystallize the cathexis of the technical so completely that it may be superfluous to give the additional evidence of Stevenson’s statement in Records of a Family of Engineers that ‘‘the joy of my grandfather in [his] career was strong as the love of woman.’’61 In Stevenson’s bildungsromans, love for the world such as engineers and sailors possess is required and transmitted in contexts of male homosociality—‘‘an imagined community of map-obsessed men,’’ as Oliver Buckton has it—from which women are almost entirely absent.62 The development such love promises, taking place outside the orbit of any heterosexual romance plot, resists the telos of such a plot. Of the three protagonists I’ve been considering, only David Balfour Technical Maturity in Robert Louis Stevenson 73 </page> <page sequence="21"> achieves ‘‘manhood’’—but in a sequel, Catriona (1893), that chronicles his courtship and marriage as well as his education in the law. In Kidnapped itself, David never reaches a definitive state of maturity. Nor does Robert Herrick in The Ebb-Tide or JimHawkins in Treasure Island. Treasure Island ends with Jim still a kind of boy. Almost the first detail readers learn about him is that Billy Bones, the ‘‘old buccaneer’’ who takes up residence in Jim’s parents’ inn at the opening of the novel, ‘‘haunted [his] dreams’’ (TI, 13); the last lines of the book read: ‘‘The worst dreams that ever I have are when I hear the surf booming about its [Treasure Island’s] coasts, or start upright in bed, with the sharp voice of Captain Flint still ringing in my ears: ‘Pieces of eight! pieces of eight!’’’ (TI, 208). The Ebb-Tide concludes with Davis, metamorphosed from an alcoholic and a thief into a born-again Christian, exhorting Herrick to embrace Christ; Herrick, aloof to the bitter end, shows no inclination to take that or any other decisive step. David confirms his own deferred adulthood when he announces near the beginning of Catriona: ‘‘I had yet to learn, and know, and prove myself a man.’’63 Whether via work or marriage, Stevenson suggests, to grow up is to stop growing.64 The open-ended, inconclusive nature of his protagonists’ Bildung, therefore, indicates less their failure to mature than Stevenson’s refusal of the model of personhood on offer in the traditional bildungsroman.65 That refusal spills beyond the pages of fiction. Duncan notes that, in the opinion of early twentieth-century critics, it was Stevenson himself who never became an adult: ‘‘He remained a kind of literary lost boy, adept at puerile forms but never mastering the mature complexities of the novel.’’66 But Stevenson might well have taken this slur as a compliment. The passage he wrote in Records of a Family of Engineers on his grandfather’s love of the world and of the work that took him out into the world continues, underscoring that love’s endurance across all the stages of life: ‘‘It lasted him through youth and manhood, it burned strong in age, and at the approach of death his last yearning was to renew these loved experiences. What he felt himself he con- tinued to attribute to all around him. And to this supposed sentiment in others I find him continually, almost pathetically, appealing: often in vain.’’67 In their commitment to technical detail, Stevenson’s bildungsromans take up and transform that appeal, carrying on the family business after all.

This insight is clearly pertinent to Stevenson’s fictions, which take shape in the context of colonial encounter.

In the present context it is notable that Menikoff’s 76 Representations </page> <page sequence="24"> argument pertains especially to Stevenson’s language: ‘‘Stevenson’s work was always grounded in actuality—in names, places, and characters drawn from life and etched on plate, words scrambled and rearranged from the most common to the most esoteric, from Latin tags to archaic proverbs to dialectical phrases, from the jargon of the sea to the language of the law’’; ibid., 10–11. 31.

I write ‘‘as well as vice versa’’ because, although twentieth- and twenty-first- century literary critics have generally preferred the late Pacific fiction, written during Stevenson’s residence in Samoa, to ‘‘boys’ novels’’ such as Treasure Island, nineteenth-century readers were often of the opposite opinion, with many considering The Beach of Falesa ́ (1892) and The Ebb-Tide evidence of a sad falling off in imagination and talent. Oscar Wilde’s quip is representative: ‘‘I see that romantic surroundings are the worst possible surroundings for a romantic writer’’; quoted in Harman, Robert Louis Stevenson, 443. 36. M. M.

Menikoff documents the sources from which Stevenson drew his account of the mid-eighteenth-century Highlands: Edmund Burt’s Letters from a Gentleman in the North of Scotland to His Friend in London (1754) and Colonel David Stewart’s Sketches of the Character, Manners, and Present State of the Highlands of Scotland (1822).

Wyeth chose to paint David on Earraid for the illustrated edition of Kidnapped (1913) marks the moment as decisive; that his painting depicts David staring out at the water suggests mental rather than physical action. For a reproduction, see Buell, ‘‘Eilean Earraid,’’ 189. Compare Wyeth’s illus- tration of Jim Hawkins’s confrontation with Israel Hands in Treasure Island, which arrests a scene of frantic physical activity.

That is, the numbers to which the a ship’s compass needle points do not give a true heading but the starting point in a series of calculations that must correct for variation (the difference between magnetic and true north at a given loca- tion on the earth’s surface) and deviation (the difference between what the compass reads and magnetic north due to the influence of ferrous metals and, now, electronics on board) before that heading can be established.

Late in the novel the point is made directly: ‘‘To complete his [Silver’s] strange appearance, Captain Flint sat perched upon his shoulder and gabbling odds and ends of purposeless sea-talk’’; ibid., 188. 48. Cohen, The Novel and the Sea, 60. 49. ‘‘As the weather seemed now quite settled and fine, and as I had got into the trade-winds, I set about preparations for hoisting the top-sails. This was a most arduous task, and my first attempts were complete failures, owing, in a great degree, to my reprehensible ignorance of mechanical forces’’; R. M. Ballantyne, The Coral Island: A Tale of the Pacific Ocean (London, 1858), 345. Chapter 38, from which I’ve drawn this extract, is replete with similar passages. Stevenson names Ballantyne, W. H. G. Kingston, and James Fennimore Cooper in the prefatory poem to Treasure Island, ‘‘To the Hesitating Purchaser’’ (TI, 7). 50. Stevenson, ‘‘A Gossip on Romance,’’ 54. Romance as the joy of passivity recurs in the rejoinder to Henry James’s complaint that the problem with Treasure Island is that, having never searched for buried treasure, he lacks the luxury to ‘‘say Yes or No, as it may be, to what the artist puts before me.’’ ‘‘The luxury, to most of us,’’ Stevenson replies in ‘‘A Humble Remonstrance,’’ ‘‘is to lay by our judgment, to be submerged by the tale as by a billow, and only to awake, and begin to distinguish and find fault, when the piece is over and the volume laid aside.’’ The pleasures of passivity in reading as well as in life inhere in an encounter with a force that cannot be resisted, that must be submitted to and simply endured. Whether metaphorized as being submerged or being lifted up by a wave—as diving or surfing—such an encounter in Stevenson is usually an encounter with the sea. Henry James, ‘‘The Art of Fiction,’’ Longman’s Magazine 4, September 1884, 518; Stevenson, ‘‘A Humble Remonstrance,’’ 86. 51. Marah Gubar observes of this and related moments in Treasure Island: ‘‘By attributing Jim’s triumphs to fickle chance, Stevenson . . .departs from the tra- ditional desert island romance formula, since such stories pound home the message that success depends on continual hard work that earnsmen the bless- ing of a benevolent providence’’; Artful Dodgers: Reconceiving the Golden Age of Children’s Literature (Oxford, 2009), 87. As I have attempted to demonstrate, ‘‘chance’’ is not quite the right name for the forces that further or stymie success in Stevenson’s bildungsromans, and that success requires at least the continual hard work of bringing rapt attention to a loved world. 52. But see Elaine Freedgood’s essay in this special issue as well as her riveting analysis of ‘‘metalepsis,’’ a conflation of fiction and fact characteristic of realism 78 Representations </page> <page sequence="26"> that results in ‘‘an open circuit between fictionality and factuality, between fiction and history, [one that] thus gives us the choice fiction or history’’; ‘‘Fic- tional Settlements: Footnotes, Metalepsis, and the Colonial Effect,’’ New Literary History 41, no. 2 (Spring 2010): 408. 53. Nearly identical scenes appear in Treasure Island and ‘‘The Isle of Voices’’ (1893). In chapter 23 of the former, titled ‘‘The Ebb-Tide Runs,’’ Jim notes that he ‘‘never should have made the ship [the Hispaniola] at all but for the tide’’ (TI, 137). In the latter, the Hawaiian protagonist Keola escapes from an abusive European first mate by jumping ship near the titular isle. ‘‘The tide,’’ the narrator reports, ‘‘which was then flowing, took him up and carried him’’ into the island’s harbor. Robert Louis Stevenson, ‘‘The Isle of Voices,’’ in South Sea Tales, 114. 54. In this as in other particulars, Attwater anticipates Kurtz in Conrad’s Heart of Darkness (1899). Others have noted the resemblance: see Roslyn Jolly, ‘‘Piracy, Slavery, and the Imagination of Empire in Stevenson’s Pacific Fiction,’’ Victorian Literature and Culture 35, no. 1 (2007): 168; Timothy S. Hayes, ‘‘Colonialism in R. L. Stevenson’s South Seas Fiction: ‘Child’s Play’ in the Pacific,’’ English Literature in Transition, 1800–1920 52, no. 2 (2009): 173. 55. Rudyard Kipling’s Kim (1901), another bildungsroman of technical maturity, replaces sailing with ethnography and cartography, and industry with espionage. 56. Jack London, The Sea-Wolf (Oxford, 2009), 141. 57. Childers drew heavily on the logbooks for a cruise he took in 1897. Compare, for example, his narrator’s diary entry for 18 October with his own log entry for 29 November 1897.

The pattern is repeated and intensified in Arthur Ransome’s Swallows and Amazons series, twelve novels following the Walker children’s endlessly deferred arrival at adulthood via sailing and camping. 66.
