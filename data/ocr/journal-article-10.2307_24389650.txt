Every so often, on the edge of Cecil Kop Game Reserve, bordering my home town of Mutare, Zimbabwe, one of the reserve's two elephants approaches the fence of a private house. On the house side is a Basenji dog. The two animals get as close to one another as the electrified fence permits. They seem to take a great interest in each other. Neither the other elephant, nor the household's other dog, participate in the exchange; this is a communing between two unique individuals. Sometimes, the elephant lies down, and she and the dog continue staring at each other. Just what is passing between them is impossible to say, but something is going on. Curiosity at least, and a measure of trust. Albeit tentative, a new, wholly unpredictable social aggregation has come into being, neither quite wild nor tamed: feral. Meanwhile, the local wildlife committee debates whether to get rid of the elephants altogether, and if so whether to shoot them or translocate them. Ecologists maintain that two elephants should not be living alone, divorced from larger family units; the reserve is too small for elephants, too small to be a self-sustaining ecosystem at all. The municipality wants to keep them for their tourist revenue, but they cannot afford to renew the fencing that prevents the elephants from wandering, or threatening subsistence trappers who snare within the reserve. Only the elephant and the Basenji seem to be talking to each other. Apparent in this one case are the rifts often encountered in southern Africa's fractured, postcolonial conservation arena: rifts between the legally empowered and the impoverished; between ecological science and commercial opportunism; between conflicting visions of resource ownership English in Africa 41 No. 3 (December 2014): 119-140 DOI: http: / /dx.doi.org/10.4314 /eia.v40i3.6S</page><page sequence="2">120 DAN WYLIE and use, of animal welfare and autonomy, of local articulations with global economies. In this context, boundaries are repeatedly being erected and breached: the hungry invade formerly sacrosanct lands or make off with the fences themselves, so that wild animals roam beyond borders designed to contain them; legal prohibitions are violated; monies are dishonestly expropriated; ignorant tourists try to pat wild elephants. Intersecting with such material performative actions are more cerebral and philosophical debates, especially about the putative distinction between 'human' and 'animal,' which Jacques Derrida has gone so far as to label a "crime" (416). The attempted erasure of that division has been variously stimulated by evolutionary theory; the burgeoning research into 'animal' capacities for intelligence, emotions, language and culture; and the growing sense that we 'humanimals' are vitally enmeshed in the same life-giving ecosystems as all other species, depending upon them in ways that are not necessarily reciprocal. In such fluidity, as indeed in any dynamic ecosystem, even the most treasured conceptual stabilities - nation, self, place, community - yield to semiotic shifts, blurring at the edges, assuming multiple reconfigurations and layerings. This essay focuses these debates through two texts: the late Lawrence Anthony's The Elephant Whisperer (written 'with' Graham Spence)1 and Caitlin O'Connell's The Elephant's Secret Sense. These non-fiction works belong to what may be discerned as a nascent genre: the 'management science elephant memoir,' one might call it. There now exist a sturdy number of popular memoirs written by elephant researchers, conservationists and activists (the roles often overlap). They begin, perhaps, with Iain and Oria Douglas-Hamilton's Among the Elephants and culminate in Lyall Watson's quasi-mystical Elephantoms and Gareth Patterson's briefer The Secret Elephants. In East Africa, Cynthia Moss's Elephant Memories inaugurated a series of women researchers' accounts: Joyce Poole's highly personalised Coming of Age with Elephants, Katy Payne's sonic researches in Silent Thunder, and Sharon Pincott's chatty trilogy relating her experiences with the so-called "Presidential Elephants" in Zimbabwe - In an Elephant's Rumble, The Elephants and I and Battle for the President's Elephants. While demonstrating some differences in approach (Pincott is no scientist, for example), these accounts share their authors' empathetic passion for elephants, and all aim for roughly the same popular, non specialist target audience. Such accounts have, I suggest, disproportionate importance in conveying to the public at large, through narrative, certain key realities of scientific research and management dilemmas. As a scientist exploring elephant communication, O'Connell draws explicitly on previous researchers' work on elephants' subsonic</page><page sequence="3">FERAL WHISPERING 121 communications, but sets her findings within a highly personalised narrative structure.2 She relates, with considerable skill, her experiments with both wild elephants in the Etosha and Mushara reserves in Namibia's Caprivi Strip, and captive elephants back in her native USA, showing that elephants respond to ground-vibration signals as well as airborne subsonic communications. The story is as much, however, about her own growth and education into the ways of local human communities. Anthony, as a landowning conservationist and wildlife reserve manager, is concerned less with science than with coping with the everyday trials of managing a group of orphaned and wayward elephants, translocated to his private game reserve Thula Thula in KwaZulu-Natal. His account conforms more obviously to the equally emergent, but increasingly stable, genre of the popular 'game-ranger memoir.' Both texts, however, are centrally concerned with two common themes: communicating with elephants, and communicating with other human communities embroiled in the tortuous politics of southern African conservation. Both texts offer a literary perspective on those politics, using narrative techniques and revealing unique dynamics invariably missing from academic accounts. At the same time, they necessitate an interdisciplinary analysis involving historical politics, the ecological sciences, and philosophy of consciousness and mind. These aspects in relation to elephants in particular have been extensively treated in the scholarly literatures; what I intend to probe here is what literary expression and imaginativeness, even in these avowedly non-fictional manifestations, contribute to the discussion. Three major threads are fundamental to the exploration that follows. First: the human-elephant interactions are contextualised within conservation history and bio-geography. More precisely this demands study of (to use the title of Wolch and Emel's pioneering book) the region's "animal geographies," which are also ethical distributions, or what Doreen Massey calls 'geographies of responsibility" (Massey 2004). Second: the definition of 'community' is highly contested in both human-social and ecological arenas - nowhere more so than in endeavours to reconstitute those two arenas into some kind of symbiosis, to extend the notion of community to include the non-human animal. Between centripetal forces of co-operation, identity, caring and communitarianism that persist over time and geographical space, and the centrifugal 'otherings' and exclusions by which any community must define itself, it is suggested, 'feral' co-operative shifts, mutual learnings, contra-normative rebellions and emergent dependencies promise new senses of expanded 'community.' Third: the elephant-human relations represented in our chosen texts embody the messy locality and emotion-laden negotiations behind the philosophical generalisations that in turn underpin almost all conservation policy.</page><page sequence="4">122 DAN WYLIE Geographies of Response and Responsibility Both Anthony and O'Connell's accounts are fundamentally concerned with the fence. In taking responsibility for housing nine elephants, a traumatised and consequently unruly group which would otherwise have been shot, Anthony's immediate task was to erect an electrified temporary boma, designed to replicate the fence around the whole of Thula Thula. By this means, the wild animals could be contained, both for their own safety in an area already vulnerable to poaching and for the safety of surrounding agricultural communities. The adventure (and The Elephant Whisperer is couched as an action-crammed adventure) begins with both those fences being breached, first by poachers and then by the elephants. In parallel, a substantial part of O'Connell's job in the Caprivi, under the aegis of local government authorities and conservation activists, is to devise non-lethal ways of protecting subsistence farmers from elephant incursions, partly by means of electrified fencing. If there is a single iconic feature governing animal distributions today, it is the fence.3 The twentieth century's advent of the 'national park' meant that such wildlife as survived the untrammelled hunting and livestock invasions of the colonial period was confined to a meagre proportion of their former ranges, in ecologically unsound and genetically isolated fragments. Elephants in particular were denied access to historical migration routes. Moreover, such land distribution was intricately tied to racist policies, even well before formal apartheid, exacerbating cultural tensions over resource access and utilisation, including mores concerning animal treatment and landscape aesthetics. Amongst these tensions is one so widespread it has earned its own abbreviation: HWC, for 'human-wildlife conflict'. In the post-apartheid era, 'wildlife' is in some resurgence, in numbers if not in freedoms: despite government programmes to restore land to dispossessed communities, the privatisation of wildlife has soared.4 At the same time, the legacy of 'fortress conservation' - exclusionary 'wildlife parks' sustained avowedly on ecological and biodiversity grounds, as well as for tourism - has become increasingly problematised. That such reserves even constitute coherent ecosystems is an "unfortunate myth" (Kepe, Wynberg and Ellis 9). At one end of a spectrum of suggested responses to this situation are those who continue to advocate for the protection of 'wilderness' (another contested and slippery term). Laura Westra argues that "while we need to utilize and manipulate some landscapes, wild areas are required to support healthy areas through their natural functions" (138), for the sake of human health itself. Further, she suggests that the ills of 'civilisation' and its futilely</page><page sequence="5">FERAL WHISPERING 123 piecemeal environmental policies need to be addressed by a "radically new design" of law and ethics, an "aggressively holistic" implementation (read imposition) of principles she calls "living in integrity" (252). At the other end of the spectrum are those who argue that, in South Africa particularly, just such an imposition from an overarching legalistic body has been precisely the problem. For at least two decades now - even as national and privately owned parks remain intact - the drive has been towards greater democracy and local sensitivity, in the sense of finding ways of incorporating local rural (that is, black, or 'indigenous') communities into conservation enterprises from which they were historically excluded. In 1991, for example, Jacklyn Cock and Eddie Koch, having noted the environmental damages and disempowerments generated by apartheid, argued that greater environmental awareness "must be part of a wider emphasis on community participation and the democratization of social and political life. Grassroots democracy is essential to green politics" (16). Since then, any number of 'community projects' have been attempted in the region, one of the most thoroughgoing being the CAMPFIRE programme in Zimbabwe (Hulme and Murphree). Ironically, this has now largely collapsed, partly because there was always an underlying set of conservation and aesthetic assumptions that proved naggingly alien to local sensibilities and cultural norms, including that there even is "a distinct community" to receive benefits; that a "relatively stable, local environment" is available for "restoration" to some presumed antecedent state; and that "harmony, equilibrium or balance between community livelihoods and natural resources" is a viable goal (Leach, Mearns and Scoones 228-29). Both our texts take their place within the fashionable trajectory towards 'community involvement,' as well as within "a broader new African [environmental] historiography that is characterized by an innovative interdisciplinary approach, a corrective anti-colonial perspective, an extension of the range of evidence in terms of new archival sources, by oral fieldwork, by incorporating nonhuman agency and African cultural constructs" (Carruthers 809). Fiction and quasi-fictional memoirs extend this "range of evidence," as well as providing unique dimensions of awareness of "nonhuman agency." They instantiate Massey's point that if 'place' is "necessarily the location of the intersection of disparate trajectories," no "easy summoning of 'community' either as pre-existing or as a simple aim" is possible (6). How responsibility for what happens in these places is distributed, shared or enforced, then, is subject to intense negotiation. As Massey notes, responsibility is relational, is "embodied in the way place is said to be embodied," and "is not restricted to the immediate or the very</page><page sequence="6">124 DAN WYLIE local" (9). What Massey's excellent discussion does not include is an examination of how responsibility may be based on an initial response to place, whether historical or aesthetic. Indeed, aesthetic awareness and expression is routinely neglected in the policy and even academic literature. Unquantifiable and 'subjective' though aesthetic responses to places and animals may be, they too are historical, and they influence historical change. O'Connell and Anthony both evince considerable awareness of the historical provenance, aesthetic underpinnings and societal complexities of their respective involvements. O'Connell experiences the Caprivi panhandle of Namibia as a characteristic mosaic of government-sanctioned wildlife reserves, private estates and African subsistence communities. All are dominated by a torturous history, as O'Connell leams: Many elephants in the Caprivi were still reeling from a war-torn past, exposed to landmines, automatic weapons, and poaching, partly to feed the hungry Angolan soldiers for the last twenty years. (3) Farmers and elephants in the Caprivi were both victims of circumstance, their fates inextricably linked through the competition for land, food, security, and access to water. In desperate times, violence was often seen as the only course. (26) In contrast to the frenetic and intricately conflictual arenas of 'community engagement,' O'Connell finds a relative peace and solace in Etosha and the conservancy of Mushara, tuning into the "slow and contemplative world" of her research subjects, the elephants: It was after twilight on a new moon night when I saw three bulls on the northern horizon just before closing into the bunker for the night. I sat on top and waited for them to walk in. In the near darkness, I felt like I was suddenly in the depths of an open ocean, sitting within my little submersible, phosphorescent stars suspended in the distance as the bulls approached. Their gait was so soft and fluid that they seemed to float in the luminescent sea like blue whales in a bottomless expanse, the major and minor Magellanic clouds in the Milky Way looking like the spouting of water through elephantine blowholes in the deep. (71) If, in her strangeness, O'Connell is obliged to describe this experience in terms of metaphors drawn from a (to her) more familiar oceanic realm, and</page><page sequence="7">FERAL WHISPERING 125 if necessarily her "bunker" denotes her vulnerability to prédation in the wild, the passage signifies an early intimation of the familial connections she will in time develop with both place and elephants. Indeed, in some ways the strangeness itself is the ground for this 'oceanic' development of cross species 'living in integrity.' History weighs differently on Anthony. He emphasises his sub-regional upbringing and bush experience in Malawi, Zambia and Zimbabwe, in order to forge a more organic 'African' belonging that he can bring to bear on the localised aesthetic of Thula Thula. The reserve is "5 000 acres of primal Africa" with a "history as exotic as the continent itself' (12). The "primal" and "exotic:" these tired tropes of non-European, out-of-time wilderness have been assailed by academics for decades, but they remain ineradicably persistent in more popular discourses (see Brooks, "Re-reading the Hluhluwe-Umfolozi Game Reserve") - and they are reflected in other passages of aesthetic appreciation in both O'Connell and Anthony. Anthony's is more behavioural than lyrical: "Living rough in the wilderness is salve for the soul. Ancient instincts awaken; forgotten skills are relearned, consciousness is sharpened and life thrums at a richer tempo" (80). Just once the writing about this place that Anthony "fell in love with" borders on the poetic: There is nothing more energizing than inhaling the tang of wilderness, loamy after rain, pungent with the richness of earth shuddering with life, or taking in the brisk dry cleanness of winter. In the outback, life is lived for the instant. The land thrums with exuberance when everything is green and lush and is stoically resilient when it isn't. (14) One need not doubt the feeling to acknowledge that Anthony (or Spence) is no poet: this verges on cliché, and no South African talks of the "outback." It's the rather Nietzschean idea of living roughly "for the instant" that is dominant throughout the text:5 the narrative moves swiftly, foregrounding action and verbal interchange, seldom lingering on descriptive detail. The genre demands it. Anthony might even be seen as a non-intellectual instantiation of the Nietzschean philosopher: This kind of philosopher is a paradoxical avatar of culture, for his flight from civilization is charged with a prized mission of cultivation and education. Neither a completely docile 'herdsman' or 'shepherd', nor a thoroughly savage 'exception', he is rather a feral 'deserter' or 'fugitive'. Tame-gone-wild, the philosopher qua</page><page sequence="8">126 DAN WYLIE cultural critic/constructor looks back at, while running ahead of, his society and epoch: he cultivates (implants ideals) by educating (literally, 'leading out'). Thus, philosophy for Nietzsche has the task of riding and remapping the liminal frontier between domesticity and wilderness, culture and nature, human and animal. (Acampora and Acampora 7, original emphasis) Anthony purchased Thula Thula in 1998, so part of the sense of belonging is dependent on a legal-cultural framework of landownership. He notes not only that Thula Thula had been a wildlife reserve since 1911, one of the earliest of its kind, but also that the area had been part of the Zulu founder-king Shaka's "exclusive hunting grounds" in the early 1800s (12).6 If this rather compromises Anthony's characterisation of the area as 'gloriously pristine' - it had evidently suffered some human influence - it also provides him with a lever for his assertion that by bringing back elephants he is returning it to a former, Zulu-sanctioned condition of wildness. This is the basis for his whole ethic, encapsulated in the following passage, arising as a kind of narrative emanation of an aerial search for his breakaway elephants: As we took off, I gazed out over the endless panorama of this charismatic stretch of Africa, so steeped in history. Originally home to all of Africa's once-abundant wildlife - now mostly exterminated - it was where conservations like us were making a stand. The key was to involve local communities in all of the benefits and profits of conservation and eco-tourism. It was a hard, frustrating struggle but it had to be fought and won. Tribal co-operation was the key to Africa's conservation health and we neglected that at our peril. (41) The aesthetic is that of the commanding aerial gaze, from which a generalised "Africa" appears an "endless panorama" and "charismatic" (a complex of unspoken attitudes and predilections hovering behind that word). But the cliché totters; the end of the very same sentence reveals that nothing is "endless." The tensions between different world-views are palpable here: any one aesthetic or approach is constrained and channelled by history. The historically forged "geography of responsibility," furthermore, is one whose aesthetic is underwritten by legislative and, ultimately, race-inflected power. Anthony is fully aware of the ambivalences and conflicts, writing: Over the last month 1 had been taking tribal leaders into the [neighbouring] Umfolozi reserve and was shocked to discover that</page><page sequence="9">FERAL WHISPERING 127 most of them had never seen a zebra or giraffe - or much of the other indigenous wildlife so iconic of the continent. This was Africa, their birthright. They lived on the borders of an internationally acclaimed game reserve, yet as a direct result of apartheid had never been inside. Historically they considered game reserves to be 'white concepts, mere excuses to seize their land,' and as they had never been included by the previous government, even with the abolishment of apartheid this was not going to change overnight. They had absolutely no idea what conservation was about, or even why the reserve was there. Worst of all, a large chunk of it was traditional tribal territory that had been unilaterally annexed and this resentment had festered over the generations. It was historically their land and it had been wrested from them with no consultation whatsoever. (171-72) Despite the consequently necessary and genuine urge to involve "tribal" communities, the ideals of fenced off conservation areas, funded by international tourism, remain. Massey is right to note that "local" place and community should not be regarded as "inevitably the victim of globalisation" (10); nevertheless, here the initiative remains with the white reserve owner, beleaguered by a self-inflicted sense of responsibility. The "key," it becomes evident, is to induct local communities into the existing conservation ethic, rather than adapt the ethic itself: "It was vital that those rural kids who had been clamouring round the helicopter - kids who lived in the bush but had never seen an elephant - became future eco-warriors on our side" (41, emphasis added). The cohesion of this discourse of warfare with a tiresome essentialising of "Africa" - "their birthright" - runs curiously, but symptomatically, counter to the manifest desire to listen to and record others' views. Rosalyn Diprose, citing Levinas, notes that "sociality is based on exposure to irreducible alterity;" but as both our writers recognise, a viable emergent politics is bom "not so much with the combining of bodies whose capacities and powers agree but with the possibility of those dominant bodies remaining open to and transformed by alterity without effacing that indeterminate difference" (172). Diprose is writing of human exchanges; how much more relevant is this in cross-species contact? Complicating Community Thembela Kepe, in several studies of the interplay of human communities in South Africa's conservation arena, notes that the definitions of</page><page sequence="10">128 DAN WYLIE community customarily invoked in developmental and government discourses often mask how 'complex and ambiguous' the term is. Even the relatively scientific methodology of ecology, which constructs essentially quantitative descriptions of resource and species distribution, energy and nutrient flows, and so on, has failed to deliver a stable delineation of ecosystemic boundedness: "The safest statement we can make about [ecological] community boundaries is probably that they do not exist, but that some communities are more sharply delineated than others" (Begum et al. 478). Moreover, the undeniably useful tools of distribution statistics, diversity indices, rank-abundance diagrams, gradient analysis and the like (470) are of less help when factoring in human dynamics, which are frequently non-rational, governed by time-honoured cultural practices, or are internally contradictory. Even 'human ecology,' which field has striven for some time to co-ordinate human societal dynamics with 'natural' ecosystems, has often been underpinned by a quasi-Utopian vision of unification or negotiated stabilisation of environmental problem areas. Hence, Kepe argues, oversimplified applications of 'community' have, for instance, resulted in the marginalisation of "less organised groups (e.g. immigrants) that live in marginal areas and have no 'community' cohesion," in "less than adequate attention being given to social difference," and in "idealised" notions of community being turned to the advantage of new but counter-productive forms of coercive authority ("The Problem of Defining 'Community'" 117). Three basic means of distinguishing community outlined by Kepe - as spatial unit, as economic unit and as kinship unit supported by cultural beliefs - are themselves in continuous contestation and modification, making the attainment of local agreements difficult at best. Moreover, while gesturing towards the importance of biodiversity, Kepe neglects notions of intrinsic natural or animal rights, let alone agency. I am, in contrast, interested in what happens when other non-human voiceless minorities and "immigrants" such as Anthony's group of imported elephants are considered as 'members' of a reconfigured community, at the widest scale of all, what might be called the 'meta-ecosystem' of literary representation and eco-reflection.7 Adequate analytical methodologies to deal with this complexity is one thing almost all disciplines have pursued in recent decades, including human ecology, complexity theory, systems theory, intersectionality, post humanism, actor network theory and more. The last-named is especially interesting to me because, as John Law explains, the theory is predicated explicitly on a metaphor, that of the 'heterogeneous network'. Science, the family, institutions, knowledge, the economy and other manifestations of social life are all more or less "ordered networks of heterogeneous</page><page sequence="11">FERAL WHISPERING 129 materials," compiled in the face of various "resistances" (381). This is attractive because it can be shown how networks become singular 'actors' (for example 'the South African government'); how abstract beliefs emerge from the 'hard work' of coalescing multiple materials into a pattern of relative stability; how the heterogeneous network incorporates the notion of performativity (talk, meetings, telephone conversations, physical visits across borders and translation of languages); and how it can include texts and representations. Finally, importantly, the network incorporates the non human: "It does not celebrate the idea that there is a difference in kind between people on the one hand, and objects on the other" - or, by extension, animals, which can equally "gain and lose attributes such as independence, intelligence, and personal responsibility," just as people can "take on and lose the attributes of machines and animals" (383). How and when such 'becomings' occur (to use Gilles Deleuze's term) is contingent upon the networks at play at any one juncture. The following discussion hopes to contribute to that "dialogue" by which "African writers-as environmentalists and environmentalists-as-writers offer powerful alternative ways of understanding nature, conservation and environment" (Caminero-Santangelo and Myers 2). Some examples of Anthony and O'Connell's representations of "community" and related terms will serve to illustrate the especial power of this kind of writing for our 'human-ecological' understanding. Where Anthony uses the term "the community" (17), it is in the now conventional, simplified sense of 'relatively poor, rural, black and uneducated.' Thus Anthony envisages turning an "unutilized" neighbouring area into a "Royal Zulu" conservation enterprise, bringing "benefits such as job creation [that] would go straight back into the struggling local communities" (14). That usage intersects in only half-revealed ways with other definitions of identity. This same area, Anthony notes, "belonged to six different Zulu clans', overlaying this non-Western sense of "belonging" and doubled identities, he plans to persuade "each tribal leader to agree individually to lease the land to a single trust" (14, emphases added). We might not expect a conservationist to articulate finessed anthropological definitional correctness, but the loose terminology here obliges us to doubt somewhat Anthony's self-proclaimed familiarity with Zulu social organisation. Moreover, the direction of persuasive power and the conceptualisation of economic structures involve, the cynic might say, merely reproducing neo-colonial power dynamics, patronising at best. Hence, while Anthony uses 'community' in a relatively positive, or neutral, sense, a group that</page><page sequence="12">130 DAN WYL1E wants to use the reserve to graze livestock is termed the decidedly negative "cattle cabal" (212). Other intersecting groupings (never called "communities") also earn Anthony's 'feral' disdain: the rich and parasitic "urban Rambos," or the "brandy and bullets brigade" of local hunters (34, 53). On the other hand, there are the more formal game rangers, "honest men of the bush" with their agreed codes and maxims and "cojones" (49, 74). Innumerable other human identifications intersect, from the ethnically precise 'Ovambo trackers' to the near-indefinable 'public opinion.' Against such fleeting characterisations, which inevitably court stereotyping, Anthony shows greater sensitivity to the realities of 'community fragmentation,' or inner contestation. Moreover, The Elephant Whisperer's generic features foreground aspects of 'community engagement' which are conventionally excluded from social science studies such as Kepe's: its embodied context of corporeal proximities, eye contacts, quotidian objects, the quality of voices. In the following, Anthony captures the internal conflicts present in an exchange with one 'community:' 'They [the elephants] will eat our crops,' said one, 'and then what will we do?' 'What about the safety of our women when they fetch water?' another asked. [. ..] 'I heard they taste good,' piped up another. 'An elephant can feed a whole village.' OK, that was not quite the reaction I wanted. But generally the amakhosi seemed well disposed to the project. Except one. (17-18) This is evidently stylised, selective, deliberately rapid-fire. The techniques of dialogue here signal their own 'fictionality,' yet they are of the kind that occurs in the actual performance of negotiation. Possibly closer to experience is the following passage, part of an extended confrontation in which Anthony has been accused of meddling in 'community politics.' He navigates the threat by imagining himself into 'Zulu' thought-patterns: 'I cannot apologize,' I repeated, 'because I have done nothing to apologize for.' More jeers. 'A man - if he is a man,' I accentuated, 'will only apologize if he has done wrong, and then he must apologize.[. . .] Are you asking me to give up my manhood and lie like a coward just because I am being threatened?'</page><page sequence="13">FERAL WHISPERING 131 These arguments may sound medieval in an air-conditioned First World courtroom, but in rural Zululand your integrity is central to your masculinity. That's the way it is. You may lie to outsiders, but not to your clan. A wiry man with a wispy moustache jumped to his feet. 'But you are lying. [...] I saw you giving them many weapons.' I knew him. He was a layabout and a poacher, and not a good one at that. And wow! he was their key witness.[. . .] Now the crowd knew that the chief witness was basically unreliable. Then the leader of the cattle cabal stood up and the hall went silent. A beefy man with a distinguished lantern jaw grizzled over by a peppercorn beard, he was a senior community member whose standing was rooted in cattle wealth. (212-13) The exchange continues for pages in this vein: dialogue and its conventional signals ("I repeated"); bodily movements; physical features hinting at character; authorial retrospective interjections contrasting with moments of mimetic immediacy ("More jeers," "And wow!"); signifiers of chronology ("Now"). The intra-community conflicts are articulated in 'real-world,' moment-by-moment exchanges, in which a phrase or an unwise motion can change everything. Reading between the lines, bringing foreknowledge to bear, capitalising on instinctive and instantaneous realisations, learning to use language itself: amongst written forms, only 'fiction' attempts to articulate these essentials of negotiation - the performative actualities on which academic generalisations are necessarily founded. (Equivalent passages in O'Connell's book are even more sensitive to the 'actor-network' effect of objects and milieux in such negotiations.) To an important degree, 'indigenous' voices and knowledges are equitably aired.8 Some cautions are necessary. There is now no telling how faithful to the original exchange this ghostwritten verbal contrivance is, or even can be, or on what criteria inclusions and exclusions have been chosen. Crucially, the tedious minutiae, perhaps disagreements and corrections, of the Zulu-English translation process upon which Anthony had insisted, are elided. Revealed also are certain assumptions of the narrator. Amongst these are that the text's implied addressee ('you') is 'Western,' 'First World,' English-speaking, likely to be more familiar with air-conditioning and courtrooms than village halls in Zululand, with "medieval" notions which, in a slightly discomfiting Social Darwinist manner, are paralleled with contemporary Zulu ones. That the entanglements and ambiguities are acted out, rather than analytically</page><page sequence="14">132 DAN WYL1E thought through within the text, is itself an important truth of the situation. Anthony extricates himself by appealing to his own historic ties to this very community; a racial slur is countered by recalling his anti-apartheid activity and the fact that he "was a good friend" to the chieftain's father (217). Divisive cultural gulfs are bridged by appealing to intersecting connections and antithetical configurations of 'community,' particularly bonds of personal friendship. By processes of literal and experiential translation new social aggregates emerge. In short, such accounts address the questions raised by Donna Haraway in The Companion Species Manifesto: How can people rooted in different knowledge practices 'get on together,' especially when an all-too-easy cultural relativism is not an option, either politically, epistemologically, or morally? How can general knowledge be nurtured in postcolonial worlds committed to taking difference seriously? Answers to these questions can only be put together in emergent practices; i.e., in vulnerable, on-the-ground work that cobbles together non-harmonious agencies and ways of living that are accountable both to their disparate inherited histories and to their barely possible but absolutely necessary joint futures. For me, that is what significant otherness signifies. (7, original emphasis) As Haraway goes on to suggest, such "emergent ontologies" pertain in human-animal relations, too (7). Companion Species When Anthony died and was buried near his house on Thula Thula, two herds of elephants, including those rehabilitated by him, appeared at the house. According to his son Dylan, "[t]hey had not visited the house for a year-and-a-half and it must have taken them about 12 hours to make the journey" (Waterworth). The elephants hung about for two days before slowly making off - behaviour interpreted as mourning and "say[ing] goodbye" (Waterworth). Alternative interpretations might be supplied were the phenomenon unique, but it is not: Dame Daphne Sheldrick recounted how her orphaned elephants, like Anthony's, "arrived wanting to kill humans but eventually protect their human family out in the bush, confronting a buffalo, or shielding their surrogate human family from wild, less friendly peers" (qtd. in Bradshaw 115). And there is another southern African case:</page><page sequence="15">FERAL WHISPERING 133 Shortly before Norman Travers was buried on his farm, Imire, in eastern Zimbabwe, two 40-year-old bulls [orphans once rescued by Travers] arrived unbidden, wandered through the crowd of 250 mourners, lumbered up to the coffin and sniffed it long and intently. When the last spadeful of earth had been cast on the grave, they stood together on the heap of ground he lay beneath. Three times in the ensuing week, they returned and stood by the grave. Travers' family is convinced they were mourning [. ..] ("Imire")9 It is less important whether the interpretation of "mourning" is accurate of the elephants' inner experience, which we simply cannot ever know, than that an interpretation assuming commonality has proved possible, that a familial though cross-species sense of community has manifested, and that the expression of it involves necessarily an act of the imagination. While in her scientific publications O'Connell rigorously eschews speculation about elephants' emotional states, confining herself to the physiological measurables of seismic transmissions, bone conductivity and so on (see O'Connell-Rodwell et al.; O'Connell-Rodwell), the narrative space of the memoir releases her into precisely such emotional and imaginative concord. Even the wild elephant subjects of her study, from which she necessarily maintains a physical distance, take on familial familiarity, as it were. But where closer proximity allows, as in the case of a captive elephant "trained to participate in a vibrotactile threshold study" ("Keeping an Ear to the Ground" 287), her expression is markedly more empathetic: During some of the more difficult trials, Donna seemed to transform suddenly from a jolly elephant, happily sucking her treats and making what elephant trainers call 'rasberry' [sic] sounds [. . .] into a toothless, bearded hag, all hairy and cowardly, tentative trunk lips quivering as she reached towards the 'yes' target, then kicking the heel of her foot into the plate when she got it wrong and didn't get a treat. She blossomed and withered, flourished and soured, depending on her success. [. . .] As we watched her swell and shrink, her suffering made us want her to succeed all the more. (Secret Sense 163-64) O'Connell's metaphors ("jolly," "blossomed," "soured") search for an expression of elephant umwelt that takes her beyond sentimentalised anthropomorphism. She qualifies her reading with "seemed," and notes carefully the outwards signs of inner states. Whether or not her interpretation</page><page sequence="16">134 DAN WYLIE is deemed accurate or credible, O'Connell is using the resources of narrative progression, colloquial language, dialogue and metaphor - the commonplaces of fiction, in fact - obviously with her 'popular' target audience in mind. The conditions for what Ralph Acampora calls 'corporal compassion' are both reflected and inscribed; in a sense, the personalised narrative genre is the condition for such compassionate companionability. O'Connell's experiences evince a marked distinction between domesticated and wild elephants, but even in the latter case a progression is achieved from utter strangeness, where she "didn't know what to make" of elephant communication (Secret Sense 56), through to a mutual habituation whereby she becomes both "part of the scenery to them" and "immersed into their world" (72). This culminates when, upon losing a traumatised elephant calf, she feels like "a terrible mother" (94). As for the calf, she figures it died of "diarrhea and probably a broken heart" (94). The anthropomorphic attribution of emotion, obviously, expresses the feeling of familial commonality and compassionate responsibility, predicated on that bodily proximity Acampora terms "symphysis" or "intersomaticity" (23, 84).10 Anthony's story of progression from aggressive wildness to trusting communication embodies even better a sense of transgressing "the false animal alternatives of herd-like docility or bestial brutality" (Anthony, The Elephant Whisperer 61). Zoologically speaking, Acampora and Acampora argue, "it is possible for an animal to be neither fully tame nor entirely wild but rather liminally feral" (7). Anthony himself calls his herd "feral" - caught between full wildness and what he sees as a necessity to "trust one human being" (61-62) - and it takes a certain ferality in that human to connect. He developed a particular relationship with one relocated wild elephant he named Nana. This progressed from potentially murderous hostility on her part, via a breakthrough "infinitesimal spark of recognition" passing between them (66), to mutually respectful touch. '1 Here he relates a stage of the developing rapport: I was intensely focussed on this magnificent creature standing so close to me. All the while Nana kept glancing across or staring at me. Every now and then she would turn her massive body slightly towards me, or move her ears almost imperceptibly in my direction. Her occasional deep rumblings vibrated through my body. So this was how she communicated [. . .] with her eyes, trunk, stomach rumblings, subtle body movements, and of course her attitude. And then suddenly I got it. She was trying to get through to me - and like an idiot I hadn't been responding at all!</page><page sequence="17">FERAL WHISPERING 135 I looked pointedly at her and said 'Thank you', acknowledging her, testing her reaction. The alien words echoed across the silent veldt. The effect was immediate. She glanced across and held my gaze, drawing me in for several deep seconds [...]. (194-95) Recognition of the mere existence of embodied communication between one sentient individual and another is an act of empathetic imagination; it transcends 'direct' translation of "alien" languages, and bears specific ethical consequences. Moreover, the evident difficulties of linguistic translation are ultimately transcended by a mode of communication both non-verbal and inexplicable: the elephants' own astonishing ability to find one another in the bush is later replicated by Anthony himself, who can only assume he finds his elephants by subliminally registering their infrasonic emissions. While cognisant of the scientific research into elephant communications (even obliquely referencing O'Connell's work), Anthony charmingly preserves his sense of wonder at elements of a communication that "defies human comprehension" (47). When the elephants mysteriously emerge to greet him at the gate on his return from rescuing zoo animals in Baghdad, he reflects on the lessons they have taught him, amongst these "repayment," "how much family means," "wise leadership, selfless discipline and tough unconditional love," "dignity" and "loyalty to one's group" (364). Unquestionably, this human and these elephants had in several senses come to constitute a new kind of 'community,' cemented by shared communicability and, above all, trust. The progression towards this condition (more ambivalent, tricky and detailed in The Elephant Whisperer than I can unpack here) is one on which negotiations between human communities - which after all cannot possibly be more different than humans are from elephants - might at least partially be modelled. The Reach of the Literary Merely by taking responsibility for his group of "feral" elephants, Anthony felt himself become "part of the herd;" ultimately, he says, it was they who whispered to him (53, 4). By learning more about elephantine communication on a purely mechanical level, O'Connell comes to experience real emotional bonds with elephants. Neither writer doubts that elephants are "emotional, caring and deeply intelligent; and that they value good relations with humans" (Anthony 4). Both writers' involvement in southern Africa's tortuous community/conservation interfaces has effected certain shifts in local</page><page sequence="18">136 DAN WYL1E "geographies of responsibility" - and by writing at all, they extend the reach of response-and-responsibility into the 'meta-ecosystem' of world literature. In so doing, they breach, or describe breaches, of the "plural and repeatedly folded frontier" (Derrida 399) between diverse human communities and between the shadowy division between 'human' and 'animal.' I have tried to suggest above that the very term "community" is at best a temporary construct, at worst an impediment to ecologically sound policy, and frequently detrimental to animal welfares. In according at least some animals (it is easier with elephants than crocodiles or mosquitoes) a consciousness that is communicable to humans, opportunities are opened up for the re-construction of ethical actor-networks of completely novel community responsibility. In writing in an experiential, phenomenological or actor-network fashion, by "eschewing the synchronic" and telling "empirical stories about processes of translation" (Law 387), 'popular' books such as Anthony and O'Connell's fulfil a crucial role in the progression of global consciousness of both 'otherness' and its potentialities. By such works, "we are asked to be a part of elephant suffering, to own what has happened and is happening to elephants as something that involves us as much as them" (Bradshaw xxi). G. A. Bradshaw for one - as indicated by her book's subtitle What Animals Teach Us about Humanity - believes that elephants can act as "a model and inspiration" for human behaviour (137). To be sure, the reconstituted trans-species communities envisaged here are always idealistic, a "crazy project," the "dream of an absolute hospitality" (Derrida 405) that aims in some fashion for Carolyn Merchant's criteria for a "reconstructive knowledge" based on "principles of interaction (not dominance), change and process (rather than unchanging universal principles), [and] complexity (rather than simple assumptions)" (qtd. in Wolfe 93). Attaining such an ideal - a new "family made up in the belly of the monster of inherited histories that have to be inhabited to be transformed' (Haraway 97) - is both essential and impossible. What Anthony and O'Connell chronicle is the "messiness of the local" underlying as well as stimulating "Western science's desire for removal from the world" (Massey 11 ) and for a rational order of societal relations. It is this messiness of perpetually evolving senses of difference which one has to include in any negotiation towards more fruitful arrangements of response-and-responsibility and mutual trust. As Alphonso Lingis concludes: Before the rational community, there was the encounter with the other, the intruder. The encounter begins with the one who exposes himself to the demands and contestations of the other.</page><page sequence="19">FERAL WHISPERING 137 Beneath the rational community, its common discourse of which every lucid mind is but the representative and its enterprises in which the efforts and passions of each are absorbed and depersonalized, is another community, the community that demands that the one who has his own communal identity, who produces his own nature, expose himself to the one with whom he has nothing in common, the stranger. This other community is not simply absorbed into the rational community; it recurs, it troubles the rational community, as its double or shadow. (qtd. in Diprose 168, original emphasis) NOTES 1. The ghostwriting is important here; though presumably Anthony approved Spence's product, it complicates the 'authenticity' of production somewhat. Hence, in what follows, the appellation "Anthony" needs to be read more as a constructed or inferred 'narrative presence' than as the 'real' person, and any judgements I pass are not intended as ad hominem. 2. O'Connell acknowledges both Poole and Douglas-Hamilton - but not, oddly, Payne, whose memoir is generically quite similar. 3. See Shirley Brooks's discussion of the complex progression of negotiations and removals accompanying the establishment of Hluhluwe National Park, close to Thula Thula ("Images of 'Wild Africa'"). In 1939 locals complained: "The animals were there and people didn't have any problem with them. In the past, that fence was not there and there was no problem between the game and the people. Since the fence was put up, animals like lions, come out of the game reserve and they eat our stock" (Brooks n.pag.). 4. There are now some 10 000 private 'reserves' in South Africa, as former farmers switch to more lucrative wildlife hunting and safari operations of various hues; revenues from the breeding and sale of animals - no longer so 'wild' - run into the billions (Weavind 8). 5. In Thus Spake Zarathustra, Friedrich Nietzsche writes that the "inner beast [.. .] this hidden core needs to erupt from time to time, the animal has to get out again and go back to the wilderness" (qtd. in Acampora and Acampora 112). 6. Brooks notes that while local legend has embellished and entrenched this notion, also with regard to the Umfolozi National Park, evidence for such grounds is slender ("Re-reading"). In the 1940s Thula Thula remained a hunter's magnet, owned by a "retired Governor General of Kenya, who used it as an upmarket shooting lodge for the gin and tonic set" (Anthony 12-13; he says nothing about what happened to it between Shaka's death, in 1828, and 1911.) 7. Loreau, Mouquet and Holt use the term "meta-ecosystem" to encompass "a set of ecosystems connected by spatial flows of energy, materials and organisms across ecosystem boundaries" (673), but their schema is solely spatial and material. They do not explicitly include writing; I prefer to re-define the term in a more literary</page><page sequence="20">138 DAN WYLIE sense to mean a 'geo-human ecosystem' that includes writing, i.e., an ecosystem that contains the tools of self-reflection. 8. This is a dimension until recently inadequately integrated into policy; even in the government's 2007 Assessment of South African Elephant Management, including contributions by fifty-seven experts, "only a few sentences acknowledged indigenous views at all" (Bradshaw 229). 9. As Dana Phillips has noted somewhat sardonically in "Weeping Elephants, Sensitive Men," the mourning scene has become "canonical, even a bit liturgical" in elephant literature (28). Anthony is doubtless one of those "sensitive men." 10. "Intersomaticity," as Acampora defines it, is neither conventional empathy nor simple identification, neither anthropomorphic nor transcendent (our language is ill-equipped to express such phenomena): "Cultivating a bodiment ethos of interanimality is not a matter of mentally working one's way into other selves or worlds by quasi-telepathic imagination, but is rather about becoming sensitive to an already constituted 'inter-zone' of somaesthetic conviviality" (84). 11. This progression is vividly captured in a television advertisement for Coronation, complete with French-accented female voice-over (Anthony's wife is French) ("Trust is Earned").
