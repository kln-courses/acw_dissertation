<plain_text><page sequence="1">WEINSTEIN, ARNOLD L. Vision and Response in Modem Fiction (Ithaca: Cornell Univ. Press, 1974). 282 pp. Arnold L. Weinsteines engaging study focuses on the character-text-reader troika in the context of what might be called the morality of form. The book is clear, candid, and per? haps overly coherent. Faulkner is the apogee of Weinstein's moral orbit, and his analysis of Absalom, Absalom!?which, fictionally, "gives definitive form to the central paradigm of this book" (p. 136)?falls precisely at the midpoint of a five-chapter structure that assumes considerable authority. Although his evaluations are more complex than the book's linear configuration might suggest, Weinstein never leaves the reader in doubt with regard to his moral sanction or censure. More cogent as an analysis of literary texts than as moral polem? ic, Weinstein's book is not really flawed but limited. His overtly humanistic and essentially conventional critical strategies do not confront on their own terms the more radical forms of fiction that he discusses. His analyses, despite their intelligence, are often unnecessarily hostile. Weinstein's depiction of reading as a Proustian invitation to respond to the vision of another, and, "more profoundly ... an act of vitalization because we are called upon to invest the sequence of white pages and black print with human meanings" (p. 276), points to the inherent paradox of liberal humanist criticism. Demonstrating, from a humanistic perspective, why some fictions may be more moral than others is not a sufficient defense of the morality of fiction itself. As our best writers, responding to the limitations of litera? ture, increasingly turn to extraliterary fictional modes and "aesthetic" personal activism, Weinstein's nostalgia for Faulkner seems dated. Pointedly skeptical of both fictional and critical systems, Weinstein attempts to "ar? rive at literary history via intense analyses of single works" (p. 20) rather than through "comprehensive, theoretical overview" (p. 23). He speaks responsibly of "changing mo? dalities of vision" (p. 24) rather than sequential development, for he has selected a set of "visions" (and their implied "responses") without any pretense of having uncovered a liter? ary monolith. He writes of his sound and interesting selection, "I do not justify my choices, for they are manifestly the result of my taste as well as my thesis" (p. 24), and I would ob? ject only that Beckett's brief treatment is incommensurate with his importance in this par? ticular literary ambiance. From his premise that novels "depict an education" for the protagonist or narrator and "constitute an education" for the reader, that "all novels are mystery stories, and all novels both describe and engender the acquisition of knowledge," Weinstein argues "that the forms of narrative from Balzac to Robbe-Grillet, if interrogated, bespeak an evolution in credi? bility and depth, a radically changing sense of what the novel has to teach us, and?by ex? tension?what we can know" (pp. 15-16). In the novel through Faulkner, "the text is rich in secrets and meanings; the job of character and reader is that of interrogation and crea? tion, transforming the evidence into humanly valid truth" (p. 17). Kafka, Joyce, and Butor</page><page sequence="2">314 / REVIEWS are transitional, and in the works of Borges, Claude Simon, and Robbe-Grillet, "Penetra? tion becomes a useless metaphor and mystery a misnomer1' (p. 19). "Humanly valid truth" is Weinstein's moral crux and is precisely where his book is both admirable in its concep? tion and somewhat pious in its execution. Starting with "solvable mysteries," Weinstein argues that Balzac fully illuminates his stage and satisfies his reader's aroused curiosity, while Dickens tenses surface revelations against the "enigmas that remain" (p. 40). Pere Goriot reveals "the transition from depth to surface" (p. 32), but in Great Expectations Pip and the reader must learn to elect emo? tional commitment over epistemological uncertainty. The full-blown emergence of the unreliable narrator in Conrad, Ford, and James marks the real inception of the dialectic central to this study. Arguing that "Conrad does not coun? tenance fully relative value schemes" (p. 51), Weinstein deftly analyzes in relation to form the conflict between self-image and behavior that informs the Conradian quest. Conrad, Weinstein nicely observes, "cannot show his cards because he does not possess them" (p. 55). The elusive self emerges "only through the complicity of character, narrator, and reader" (p. 57). Ford's Good Soldier, with its more "radical" perspective on vision, forces the reader to reenact the education of its narrator and challenges him to learn to transcend the paraly? sis of excessive cerebration. James prefigures any potential " 'guideless' novel of pure surfaces, where vision is problematic from beginning to end and the reader's own experience constitutes the sole authority" (p. 69). Rightly focusing on James's preoccupation with the morality of perception, Weinstein emphasizes the recurrent "violence implicit in knowing" (p. 73) and, I think, underestimates the extent to which James believed in the inherent moral value of refined perception. His lengthy analysis of The Turn of the Screw, which attempts to obviate the Freudian/ghost story interpretive impasse by focusing on the defective vision and destructive behavior of the governess, is muddled and sententious. Polemically conclud? ing that "It matters little which way we 'read' her, if only we see the enormity of what she has done" (p. 85), Weinstein effects a moral reductiveness that, despite his protests, obliter? ates not only the suggestive quality, but, in effect, the existence of the story. Chapter 3 peaks on the "visceral and affective" (p. 91) writing of Bernanos and Faulk? ner. Monsieur Ouine and The Sound and the Fury "adumbrate a vision of spirituality and community, as opposed to the oppressive limitations of individual consciousness" (p. 92)? a vision that emerges expressively as well as ideationally. Benjy's monologue, for example, is a "test to the reader's humanity" (p. 114) in its demand for intuitive, imaginative, and affective reading. Absalom, Absalom!, "the most complete embodiment of vision as feel? ing" (p. 92), fully "harnesses" the power of the affective style. Constituting the paradig? matic "distance between sight and insight" (p. 136), between our sensual perceptions of phenomena and the "human" sense we must make of those perceptions, it asserts "The val? ue of selfless commitment and the embracing, creating vision of love . . . against the claims of logic, evidence, and appearances" (p. 137). Demanding reintegration, the novel forces the reader to follow Quentin and Shreve in attaining the Faulknerian "overpass to love." With Kafka, Joyce, and Butor, anthropocentric fiction swings into its postapogean "eclipse." Emphasis is increasingly on the observed world rather than the moral validity of a particular vision, schematics and style rather than human activity. Certainly correct in pointing to the developing self-referentiality of fiction, Weinstein chooses to infer a negative diminution of character rather than a positive redefinition of literature. Kafka is highly resistant to moral response (in the humanistic, if not the apocalyptic, praxis), and Weinstein intelligently rehearses the conventional view that for the protagonists (and the reader) "everything . . . has become problematic" (p. 159), reason acts only as ob fuscation, and knowledge is ultimately, and painfully, visceral. His analysis of Joyce is less convincing. He overplays the architectonic nature of Ulysses as a cool manipulation of three egocentric characters, and his references to Finnegans Wake simply do not gauge the awesome emotive power of the work. One textual error (he reproduces Stephen's famous</page><page sequence="3">REVIEWS / 315 flyleaf inscription in its corrupt, "justified" form), a misleading statement (Molly's last words are not "significantly a memory of someone other than Bloom" [p. 176] but refer clearly to Mulvey and Bloom), and a questionable inference (he seems to identify the narra? tor of "Wandering Rocks" with Joyce) undermine to some extent Weinstein's credibility. He accurately points to Joyce's continual movement toward more elaborate form, but emphasizes this tendency at the expense of Joyce's careful balance of symbolism and natu? ralism. He does not explore, for example, the human importance of the "eggs for breakfast" motif or the elaborate creativity-urination identification, and his argument that Bloom and Stephen are dwarfed by the real (and by Joyce's semantic) universe minimizes the reciproc? ity of this relationship. Weinstein's real argument is with Joyce scholarship, and though he applauds the intention, he laments that "the humanist troops" can invade "the most her? metic works" until humanistic reading becomes "too much of a good thing" (p. 171). Humanism "becomes a specious term" (p. 190), however, only if one rejects Joyce's implicit redefinition of it. Although Passing Time "can be seen as the convergence of the strands dealt with in Kafka and Joyce" (p. 190), Butor is redeemed by the "didactic character" of his work and by his focus on "orientation and exploration" (p. 191). Weinstein's analysis of the novel is thorough and interesting. Weinstein's final chapter explores the "alienated vision" of works which "subvert the central notion of vision to which most of [his] book has been devoted" (p. 215). The self-en? larging, and potentially redemptive, artistic vision in Proust, Weinstein argues, is pervaded by the narcissism "of possessing through one's metaphorical evocation of the world, not the world but oneself (p. 222). In Borges, Claude Simon, and Robbe-Grillet "the structures and patterns of vision . . . reign alone, inhuman and authoritative" (p. 223). His analysis of Borges echoes that of James in its focus on "the cost, the human dimension (which Borges rarely overlooks) that underlies and finances his prodigious patterns and cosmologies" (p. 224). Simon's Flanders Road despite its residual anthropomorphism, "registers a fail? ure of the imagination, an inability to believe in depth, penetration, or the efficacy of af? fective form" (p. 242). The "despotic style" (p. 243) victimizes narrator and reader, just as the "deranged optic" (p. 251) of Robbe-Grillet's In the Labyrinth brutalizes characters in the name of a theoretical freedom for the reader which Weinstein understands but dis? misses. Granting that all authorship is manipulatory, Weinstein maintains that in Robbe Grillet "authorial manipulation ... is exalted, travestied under the name of liberty and passed off as non-anthropocentric honesty" (p. 253). Ecriture is betrayed, Weinstein argues, by a vestigial psychological content, and this tension demands a humanistic response. Arguing that literature, unlike painting, cannot divorce itself from anthropomorphism, Weinstein, championing a literature of mediation, agrees with Frank Kermode's sentiment that we are "equipped for coexistence with [chaos] only by our fictive powers" (p. 268). The current arguments for radically "open" literature are, in some ways, consistent with Wein? stein's positive approach to Faulkner. But his basic position?"If we open ourselves to literature, it is so that we may return, renewed, to living, with a fuller sense of the human" (p. 275)?betrays a quiet presupposition of journey to vicarious experience and reader character identity, and it encapsulates, in the word "return," a powerful nostalgia for mime? sis. His final diatribe against the kaleidoscopic, "murderously unstable" (p. 273) worlds of modern fiction follows logically, but presents a very gloomy perspective on some exciting transformations of fiction and imagination. Weinstein's book is well worth reading, whether it reinforces or irritates one's percep? tion of the morality of fiction. As literary analysis, it is more complex and perceptive than my necessarily reductive response to its moral position might suggest. As moral polemic, it is certainly aggressive and provocative. Literature, in whatever form, is manifestly with us, and this fine study addresses it in an important arena. CHARLES CARAMELLO, University of Wisconsin?Milwaukee</page></plain_text>
