<plain_text><page sequence="1">MANSEL'S THEORY OF REGULATIVE TRUTH TPT־ JL 1 THE philosophy of religion of H. L. Mansel (1820-71) was an attempt to reconstruct the argument of Joseph Butler's Analogy in the new situation created by the work of Kant and his succès sors. Mansel considered that, as Locke's philosophy had given rise to the deism which confronted Butler, so Kant's philosophy had given rise to the 'rationalism' of his own day. A criticism of the laws and limits of religious thought more thorough and consistent than Kant's would check the presumption of rationalism and re-establish the authority of revelation. This programme Mansel carried out in his Bampton Lectures of 1858, The Limits of Religious Thought Examined, and in a number of other writings.1 The most striking feature of these writings is Mansel's theory of regulative truth. The Limits was at first very well received, though not so well understood. 'On the whole', wrote Mansel in 1859, 'I have no reason to complain of my Critics.'2 In the same year F. D. Maurice wrote, 'If the religious world had not declared almost en masse masse in favour of Mansel I would not have written against him.'3 The worst that had been said till then was that the Bampton Lectures repeated without acknowledgement the view of Newman, especially as expressed in the fifteenth of his University Sermons.« Newman himself seems to have noticed the resemblance, and to have been disappointed that it was not acknowledged.5 But Mansel had made handsome amends.6 1 The Limits of Religious Thought Examined went through two editions in 1858 and two in 1859. The fifth edition of 1867 was reprinted in 1870. Since the book not only grew greatly in size, but also underwent alterations, it is some times necessary to refer to earlier editions than the last.

He himself defended them tenaciously—he was a most obstinate man—and only Goldwin Smith came near to persuading him to change his ground by turning his theory of regulative truth into a doctrine of analogy. But the more Mansel explained himself the less his views were liked. All manner of charges began to be made by those who thought him dangerous, and he fell at last into neglect.1 Mansel made considerable demands upon his audience. The influence of German thought upon the English religious situation at that time is a complex question ; but Mansel certainly asked for a more exact know ledge than most possessed. As for the theory of regulative truth, Mansel made a series of statements each more challenging than the last. He claimed that no immediate knowledge of God is possible. He then directed attention to the problem of analogy which arises. In the tradi tion of British empiricism he found arguments, originally belonging to the philosophy of perception, which, when applied to the present question, seemed to show that no theory of analogy is possible. Accord ingly religious conceptions must be understood, not as describing God, so much as regulating the religious and moral life. They are not specula tively, but only regulatively true. And Mansel claimed that this was orthodoxy, and a continuation of the old Anglican emphasis upon 'practical divinity'. In so claiming Mansel was one of the first to bring out a characteristic ally modern difficulty about theology: namely that the real issue is not that of the correctness of particular statements within a theology, but what status is to be given to all the statements of a theology. Mansel's particular statements are orthodox: but what is the effect on them of his general theory of the status of religious language as a whole ? To be explicit about this problem required not only logical ability, but also a certain severe honesty of mind. This Mansel undoubtedly possessed. It appears in his remarks on evil: It is a fact which experience forces upon us, and which it is useless, were it possible, to disguise, that the representation of God after the model 1 Among the brief studies available may be mentioned 'Dean Mansel as a Christian Philosopher' (said by J.

The infliction of physical suffering (etc.) ... are facts which no doubt are reconcilable, we know not how, with the Infinite Goodness of God; but which certainly are not to be explained on the supposition that its sole and sufficient type is to be found in the finite goodness of man.1 There is almost a Humean irony here, and John Stuart Mill was repelled by it. Mill, who failed to grasp the problem of analogy for a reason which will shortly appear, preferred to limit God's power rather than to qualify God's goodness. It was a cause of great offence to him that Mansel resolved the ancient dilemma in the opposite way.2 Mansel's argument to dispose of F. D. Maurice's case for universalism has the same astringency: ... it is urged that sin cannot for ever be triumphant against God.3 As if the whole mystery of iniquity were contained in the words for ever\ The real riddle of existence,—the problem which confounds all philosophy, —aye, and all religion too, so far as religion is a thing of man's reason, —is the fact that evil exists at all; not that it exists for a longer or shorter duration. Is not God infinitely wise and holy and powerful now ? and does not sin exist along with that infinite holiness and wisdom and power ?4j Mansel's argument bites very deeply indeed, challenging the very possibility of theology. Maurice was outraged.5 Another reason for Mansel's unpopularity is that he has been regarded as sophistically combining metaphysical scepticism with theological fundamentalism. Young Henry Sidgwick saw him in this light: I read Mansel (Bampton) again. He really is a well-meaning man, and il il il a raison for the most part against Metaphysicians. But he talks of Revelation as if the Bible had dropped from the skies ready translated into English; he ignores all historical criticism utterly.6 It was very early being asserted that Mansel's views ,led to' what would come to be called agnosticism. In 1861 Goldwin Smith pointed out, in a leaflet entitled Mr. Mansel's Letter to Mr. Goldwin Smith, that Mr. Herbert Spencer was claiming to be merely ,carrying a step further 1 Limitspp. xiii f. 1 1 An Examination of Sir William Hamilton's Philosophy (1865), ch. vii.

The bible is not at fault because heretics appeal to it, and the fact that Spencer appeals to Mansel is something less than a proof that he is justified in doing so.2 But it was no good: the damage was done; and agnostics like T. H. Huxley took a mischievous pleasure in placing themselves under Mansel's patronage, to the great detriment of his future reputation.3 English religious thought was indeed not well placed to consider the problem of analogy. Hume's Dialogues concerning Natural Religion (1779) explain why. Mansel's view is that of Demea in the dialogues, to whom he once referred as 'the champion of orthodoxy'. Demea's high negative theology, however, scarcely gets a fair hearing. For since Berkeley, English religious thought had been dominated by the argu ment from (or to) design : it had approximated to the position of Clean thes in the dialogues. It is Cleanthes' views which are really closely studied. And Mansel takes Hume to have clearly shown that the whole drive of a teleological approach to theism is towards anthropomorphism. This makes Cleanthes fall an easy victim to Philo, after the latter has extorted the admission that his kind of theism demands 'a mind like the human human . . . And the liker the better'.■» The argument to design is strong in so far as it establishes the closest possible resemblance between divine and human contrivance: and in so far as the English mind moved to God in this way, it could not ade quately recognize the problem of analogy. We may quote Berkeley himself as an example. William King, Archbishop of Dublin, in a remarkable sermon entitled Divine Predestination and Foreknowledge (1709), had argued that since predestination and foreknowledge are quite different in God from what they are in man, they may be reconcil able with future contingency (and so human freedom) in the former case, although they are not in the latter. King's argument, in fact, is stronger the more different divine attributes are from their human analogues. Berkeley, in a letter to Percival of 1 March 1710 (n.s.), shows how per plexed he was by this. It went against his whole approach to theism: ז Spencer issued the Prospectus for the First Principles in March i860; and the volume itself in six parts, Oct. 1860-June 1862. 2 Second Letter, p. 53. 33 When Huxley read Mansel's Bampton Lectures, 'it seemed to me that I already knew all that this eminently agnostic thinker had to tell me'.

Mansel's comments in Second Letter, pp. 3! ff</page><page sequence="5">108 DON CUPITT Upon such principles I must confess I do not see how it is possible to demonstrate the being of God : there being no argument that I know of for his existence, which does not prove him at the same time to be an under standing, wise and benevolent Being, in the strict, literal, and proper meaning of those words.1 Berkeley's response here is rather unsophisticated. By the time he came to write Alciphron (1732) he had read Aquinas, Cajetan, and Suarez.2 But broadly speaking, we may generalize as follows: the various forms of the cosmological argument move from some imper fection in the world (such as its 'contingency') to a contrasting perfection in God; and this provides a favourable climate in which to raise the problem of analogy. For it is manifest from the outset that God is what the world is not. Whereas in the various forms of the design argument an attempt is made to establish as close a resemblance as possible between supposed marks of design in the natural order, and certain products of human contrivance, in order that, by analogical inference, a parallel resemblance may be held to obtain between their makers. Thus I would suggest that it was the dominance of the design argument in English religious thought which made Mansel's contemporaries so slow to appreciate the problem of analogy and so hostile to his particular doctrine of regulative truth. So far as Mill (on the evidence of his essay on Theism) accepted the design argument, he also must assert that 'goodness' when predicated of God means the same as it means when predicated of a fellow man, the difference being in degree only. Nevertheless, the lack of support and understanding from Mansel's Oxford contemporaries was striking. Many of the sources of his thought were available to them. His predecessors, Copleston and Whately (whom Newman had assisted with his Logic), had treated of analogy. So had John Stuart Mill, though Mill had not treated of the use of analogical predication in theology; he had confined himself to analogical in ference as a kind of imperfect induction.3 The Oxford high churchmen were familiar with the classical theologians to whom Mansel appealed as supporting his views. And there was a marked resemblance between Mansel's position and the tractarian doctrine of faith, especially as taught by Newman. But Newman could take no direct part in the controversies. The attitude of the others is perplexing. J. B. Mozley certainly 1 Luce and Jessop, The Works of George Berkeley, vol. viii, p. 32. 22 See Alciphron, Dial. iv. 16-22 : Luce and Jessop edition, vol. iii, pp. 162-71. 3 A System of Logic (1843), Bk. iii, ch. xx. Butler's use of the term analogy long directed people's attention away from analogical predication to analogical inference.</page><page sequence="6">MANSEL'S THEORY OF REGULATIVE TRUTH 109 appreciated the problem of analogy. He could use language almost identical with that of Mansel.1 But in his review of The Limits he is hostile: . . . one grand point of Mr. Mansel's theory is that the highest principles of thought and action to which we can attain are regulative and not speculative.speculative. We take upon ourselves to say that it is also the weak point of the theory . . . either God represents himself to us as He is, or as He is not... it is involved in the very idea of God that He will reveal Himself to His creatures, in a mode which is speculatively true. . . .2 Mozley is unjust in suggesting that Mansel doubts God's veracity. Mansel was pointing to the limits upon any possible communication from an infinite to a finite mind. Only God can know God as he is. A finite being can only know God through finite representations which cannot cannot be adequate representations, but which yet can be adequate for the purposes of religion. There must be a kind of kenosis in revelation. H. P. Liddon was hardly more sympathetic, if one makes allowance for the occasion of his utterenace on the subject. Preaching in St. Paul's Cathedral on the day after his colleague's funeral, Liddon defended Mansel against those who had 'crudely insisted that, if God cannot be known as he is, he cannot be known at all'; but added, 'it is possible that he failed to guard sufficiently his theory of regulative truth'.3 P. C. Chretien, an Oxford logician, reviewed The Limits in The Times and subsequently wrote a Letter to the Rev. F. D. Maurice on some points points suggested by his recent Criticism of Mr. Mansel's Bampton Lectures (1859). Chretien suggested that if the merely regulative character of religious truth was a consequence of the limits of thought in general, then those limits, obtaining as they do over the whole range of human thought, must make all human knowledge merely regulatively true. If so, the distinction between speculative and regulative truths is either futile or dangerous or both.4 Chretien's point is a worthwhile one, even though he is not entirely fair to Mansel in making it. For Mansel, in The Limits, was arguing, in the manner of Butler, that 'Revelation is subject to no other limitations than those which encompass all human thought.'5 Such a method of 1 As in his sermon, ,Mysterious Truths', in Lectures and other Theological Papers Papers (1893), pp. 102 ff. 2 Christian Remembrancer, xxxvii (1859), p. 375. 3 The Day of Work (1871), pp. 13, 14.

There is a confusing misprint in the original. 5 Limitss, p. 336 (my italics). That this is a dangerous argument is shown by the fact that it was used by John Toland in his Christianity not Mysterious</page><page sequence="7">no DON CUPITT argument must direct his attention away from such special difficulties of religious thought as are a consequence of its special subject matter. So Mansel could be tempted to make such speciously profound general statements as 'all knowledge is relative'. As Mill showed in his Examina tiontion of Sir William Hamilton's Philosophy, such a statement tends to be advanced in a very portentous sense, and seems to lead to all manner of startling conclusions: but when it is attacked it is defended as the tautology it really is. And metaphysicians are prone to employ this manœuvre.1 Mansel was certainly open to this charge; but, to be fair to him, he did say that we can make speculatively true statements describing our immediate intuitions, as that '1 am now seeing'. It was in respect of ultimate questions, metaphysical issues, that speculative truth was unattainable. But still, Mansel would have been wiser to relate his theory of regulative truth rather to the peculiar difficulties of religious thought than to the limits of all thought. And I think this was probably his real intention. For example, in the article on 'Metaphysics' he does not refer to the distinction between speculative and regulative truth: he stops short of it as he is about to enter the theological realm. And this would suggest that he wished to restrict the notion of regulative truth to the field of theology, and was led astray in The Limits by the demands of his Butlerian scheme.2 This impression is confirmed by study of the pamphlet in which he stated the doctrine first, most clearly, and most austerely: Man's Conception Conception of Eternity: An Examination of Mr. Maurice's Theory of a Fixed.Fixed. State out of Time (1854). In this pamphlet Mansel criticizes Maurice for having interpreted biblical talk about eternity in a certain way and then using this notion of eternity to overthrow the received doctrine of everlasting punishment.5 Mansel argues as follows. He agrees with Maurice that time is ideal ; that is to say, that time is the form of a consciousness subject to succès sion, and eternity the form of a consciousness not so subject. But of (1696).(1696). Toland argued that God is no more and no less mysterious than 'a spire of grass', denying any special mystery in religious knowledge. The argument, which is based upon Locke's doctrine of substance, became a commonplace in preaching (e.g., S. Clarke, Works (1738), vol. i, p. 101). It was used to prove opposite conclusions by deists and orthodox. Deists would not allow Christi anity to be any more mysterious than a blade of grass. The orthodox, like Butler and Mansel, allowed that revelation was thoroughly mysterious, but claimed that this accorded with the analogy of nature. 1 Mill, op. cit., ch. ii. * On the other hand, as an ultra-strict Kantian, Mansel is concerned that we should finally renounce the vain attempt to transcend the limits of thought and grasp the Ding cm sich. 3 The pamplet is reprinted in LLR.</page><page sequence="8">MANSEL'S THEORY OF REGULATIVE TRUTH m eternity in this sense we can have no conception: for as it cannot be presented in intuition, so it cannot be represented in thought. We can not conceive a being whose states of consciousness are all simultaneously, and not successively, presented to it; for our own acts of conception are themselves inescapably subject to succession. (Any claim to think God, for Mansel, was mysticism, and mysticism was pantheism: to think God one must be God.) Accordingly we cannot positively conceive either the eternity of God, or an eternal state of ourselves. That a person now subject to the law of succession should be identified with one hereafter not so subject appears to imply a self-contradiction; for it implies a consciousness of the relation of Present to Past, and the absence of Time, the basis of that relation.1 Maurice's mistake, then, had been to deploy the concept of eternity in a way which is beyond our powers. Since we cannot think eternity as the form of a non-successive consciousness, we do not know how to employ it as a premiss in arguments, and we cannot use it to show that revelation must be interpreted in this or that way.2 Mansel's argument so far would seem to imply metaphysical agnos ticism. This he admits. Philosophy runs up against the limits of thought and there must rest content. 'The duty of philosophy is, not to transcend consciousness, but to make consciousness at unity with itself.'3 Like Wittgenstein, Mansel gives philosophy a therapeutic task. It shows us how metaphysical longings arise, shows that they are in principle in satiable, and seeks to cure us of them. 'I do not say that it is the duty of the metaphysician to solve this mystery of Being; but it is his duty to find out why it is insoluble.'4 Metaphysics ends with merely 'negative ideas' of the infinite, of eternity, and of God, which it cannot put to use, because it does not know how to form any positive conception of them. But in theology this suspension of judgement is often inadmissible. We are required to believe and act upon much that we cannot compre hend; and our belief and practice must take such a form as is adapted to the constitution of our own minds, even though it may also be related to a possible ultimate truth which our present faculties are unable to seize. Hence it is that ideas and images which do not represent God as He is may nevertheless represent Him as it is our duty to regard Him. They are not in themselves true ; but we must, nevertheless, believe and act as if they were true. A finite mind can form no conception of an infinite Being which 1 LLR, p. 117. 22 Is this argument sound? I am not sure what Mansel would say to the objection that we can deploy irrational numbers in mathematical argument. 3 On the Philosophy of Kant (1856); in LLR, p. 182. 4 Psychology the Test of Moral and Metaphysical Philosophy (1855); in LLR, p. 147.</page><page sequence="9">112 DON CUPITT shall be speculatively true; for it must represent the infinite under finite forms: nevertheless, a conception which is speculatively untrue may be regulativelyregulatively true. A regulative truth is thus designed not to satisfy our reason but to guide our practice ; not to tell us what God is, but how He wills that we should think of Him.1 And so Mansel argues against Maurice that since in scripture God represents himself, his rewards, and his punishments as everlasting, we should be content with that representation and not indulge the vain hope that it is in our power to substitute a better. It is noticeable that Mansel, in putting forward the doctrine of regulative truth for the first time, sets it out in a way which has very agnostic implications. For there are two reasons why we may know that our representations of God must be misleading. The first is that the finite image, being finite, must be quite unlike the infinite original. The second is that the finite images are not coherent with each other. For example we are bidden to regard God both as unchanging, and as hear ing and answering prayer. And we cannot reconcile these two repre sentations. And certainly Mansel stresses the adaptation of revelation to our moral needs much more than he stresses its informative character. God judges it right for us that we should be instructed to think of him as if he possessed 'a human mind and affections, as one who will be informed of our needs, who will be entreated by our supplications, who will even be urged by our importunities . . .'.2 Mansel demonstrates that, because of the limits of thought, religious language cannot but be anthropomorphic, and his sarcasm against the Hegelians who naively supposed that they could transcend anthropo morphism is splendid: 'The God who listens to prayer, we are told, appears in the likeness of human mutability. Be it so. What is the God who does not listen, but the likeness of human obstinacy ?3י In vainly attempting to transcend anthropomorphism 'they do but substitute a marred and mutilated humanity for one exalted and entire'.3 But now, Mansel has demonstrated that our images of God must be anthropomorphic; and he has pointed out two good reasons for thinking them positively misleading: is he then in the position of those who thought truths of faith might be contrary to reason? Have we any reason for thinking that the imagery which revelation employs to speak of God is not wholly misleading? There are three strands in Mansel's answer to this question. In his sceptical vein Mansel will say, as we have seen, that there are definite reasons why we must think the imagery inadequate. He will LLR, pp. 112-13. 2 LLR, p. 114. 3 Limits5, pp. 12 f.</page><page sequence="10">MANSEL'S THEORY OF REGULATIVE TRUTH 113 also strongly emphasize, particularly in The Limits, that we have no means of comparing the image with the original. There can therefore be no theory of analogy. Thus he proves that there can be no progress in theology, in the sense of a progressively closer approximation of the theological representation to the object represented, because we have no presentative knowledge of the object. We have only representations, and no criteria for purifying them.1 On the other hand, Mansel criticizes Kant for allegedly saying that we can be sure that the thing in itself is unlike the thing in conscious ness, saying that we cannot know either way.2 What seems incoherent to us, says Mansel (following Hamilton), may not be so in itself. Further more, although Mansel's views in his sceptical vein seemed almost to rule out dogmatic theology altogether as an enterprise beyond our powers and leave us with a bald scriptural positivism, Mansel denies that this is his view. On the contrary, 'All Dogmatic Theology is not Dogmatism, nor all use of Reason, Rationalism, any more than all drinking is drunkenness.'3 In this more moderate vein, Mansel will say that though reason is not infallible, it is not therefore worthless; and although our representations are not adequate to be the basis of a scientifically certain system of speculative theology, they are not either useless or misleading. What must be remembered is that revelation is a practical guide, rather than a theoretical illumination: it requires of us obedience rather than the 'diseased ecstasies of mysticism': 'I believe that, intellectually as well as morally, this life is a discipline and pre paration for another, and that that portion of knowledge which my limited faculties can attain to, though it be but partial truth, is not absolute falsehood.'4 As well as these more and less sceptical emphases in the exposition of his doctrine, Mansel has a third strand: his stress on faith. It is a duty duty to believe that the representations of God which he has vouchsafed to us are not wholly inadequate. We ought, not only to think of God as Father, but to live, to pray, and to feel, as if God were our Father. The practical adequacy of our analogical language about God is, and can only be, an affirmation of practical faith. Why did Mansel choose these particular terms, speculative and regulative־*.regulative־*. Goldwin Smith made a simple, but pertinent objection when he said: 'If there is no truth attainable by man but "regulative truth", there is no truth attainable by man at all. "Regulative truth" is a nonen tity. A rule may be such as it is necessary to obey, but it cannot, in the 1 Limitss, p. 179. 2 Limits', p. 259. 3 Limits', p. ix. 4 LLR, p. 115. 621.1</page><page sequence="11">114 DON CUPITT proper sense, be true.'1 Mansel the logician could not fail to take the point, and he explained: I do not mean by a regulative truth what you mean by a rule. . . .2 By a speculative speculative conception I mean one which results from a direct intuition of the object conceived, or of some exact representation of it. And the speculative truth of such a conception will consist in its agreement with the intuition. It is a speculative truth to speak of myself as seeing or hearing, for this statement represents a fact of which I have direct know ledge from my own experience. But when we speak of God as seeing or hearing such language does not represent a speculative truth. We do not suppose that he sees with eyes or hears with ears, and we have no direct knowledge of any other mode of seeing or hearing. But such language is regulativelyregulatively true, as stating the fact, that God has a knowledge of what we do and say; though the manner of that knowledge is unknown to us. . . .ג The terms speculative and regulative had been suggested to Mansel by his study of Kant,4 but Mansel's use of them differed greatly from Kant's. For Kant a speculative cognition was possible of an idea (such as that of God) which could not be presented in any possible experience. Such a cognition could have a regulative, though not a constitutive, value.5 For Mansel, however, a concept must be clear, distinct, and constitutive;6 and so we have no concept of God. For God can neither be coherently thought, nor presented in experience. God can only be thought under finite forms which are speculatively insufficient, but which nevertheless are practically or regulatively useful. Goldwin Smith had suggested that regulative representations could be no more than mere metaphors or figures. On the contrary, says Mansel, they are a great deal more. And in his letters to Goldwin Smith Mansel does appear to be developing a theory of analogy in a way which his earlier statements would seem to have ruled out. He begins to make distinctions within the language we use about God: I do not believe that the anger and the pity of God are figures in the same sense in which the hand and the eye are figures ; nor do I believe that the power and the wisdom and the goodness of God can be called figures, as His anger and pity might in a wide sense be called so. . . .7 Here Mansel proposes a threefold classification of our language about God which had been suggested to him by the controversies involving King, Browne, Berkeley, and others; but which certainly is not consistent with his earlier statements. He could only achieve 1 Goldwin Smith, Lectures on the Study of History (1861), p. 79. 22 First Letter, p. 31. 3 Ibid., p. 32. 4 Second Letter, p. 63. 5 Limits5, p. 272 n. 6 For Mansel's theory of conception see Metaphysics, pp. 587b-91b. י First Letter, p. 33.</page><page sequence="12">MANSEL'S THEORY OF REGULATIVE TRUTH 115 consistency by claiming that it is a matter of faith to believe that, when we speak of God's eye, his anger, and his wisdom, we are using three different kinds of language. But it is awkward for Mansel to claim that God gives us, together with his revelation, a key to the interpretation of the same. And when Mansel comes to speak of analogy he runs up against a further difficulty, as may be seen in the following passage, where Mansel declares that analogy means resemblance of relations׳. I am altogether unable to accept your explanation of analogy . . . that it means either proportion, by which I suppose is meant numerical pro portion, or nothing but resemblance. When Aristotle gives as an instance of analogy ws ■yàp eV awpaTi oifns, èv i/jvyfj vovs, I do not think he means to express either a numerical proportion or a resemblance between the things themselves. I believe that he means, as he says, that there is a relation relation between sight and the body resembling that between intellect and the soul.1 Elsewhere Mansel uses the phrase 'similarity of relations', quoting Butler's analogy between difficulties in religion in relation to the system of religion, and difficulties in nature in relation to the system of nature.2 Unfortunately this is not satisfactory as an account of the use of analogical predication (rather than analogical inference) in theology. For no theologian imagines that God's mode of possession of his wisdom does in fact resemble the manner in which a man possesses wisdom. The difference might be indicated by saying something like this, that a man might cease to be wise (for example, through senility), and remain the same man; whereas God is his wisdom. God's relation to his wisdom is essential or analytic: a man's relation to his wisdom is accidental or synthetic. The two ways of being wise do not resemble each other. And if it is said that God's way of being wise is related to man's way of being wise proportionably to the difference between God's being and man's then it may be replied that this difference is precisely what is unknown. Knowledge of the nature of the proportionality between God's way of being anything and man's cannot be both the prerequisite and the result of a successful act of analogical predication. Accordingly, if Mansel to some extent abandoned the original strictness of his doctrine of regulative truth, and developed it into a kind of theory of analogy, he made no progress. His original position, bleak though it is, is surer. Goldwin Smith also asked how we can believe in something which is inconceivable: * Second Letter, p. 23, note k. 2 H. L. Mansel, Artis Logicae Rudimentae* (n.d.—in fact, 1862), p. 228.</page><page sequence="13">116 DON CUPITT If God is 'inconceivable' ... I fail to apprehend how we can believe in Him: my mind, though conjured in the name of 'duty' is unable to present to itself the existence of anything of which I have no conception. Still more obvious does it seem to me that I cannot, with the nature that is given me, revere and love a Being who reveals Himself to me, not as He is, but under 'regulative representations'.1 Mansel's reply was that we can believe that something is the case without being able to conceive how it can be the case. And this is precisely the situation in which faith finds itself.2 Maurice thought Mansel's views subversive of religion. Mansel was substituting authority for experience, law for gospel, the regulations of religion for God's gift of his very self. And so, as the young Berkeley reacted to King, Maurice reacted to Mansel; echoing indeed Berkeley's very words when he speaks of St. Paul preaching to the Athenians 'God as in the strictest, fullest sense, their Father. I say again, in the strictest, fullest sense .. .'.3 We must take the traditional language about knowing God 'literally', in the 'most exact' sense.4 Religion is subverted if while we are praying to God as Father we know that he is not so really. For Maurice Christianity demands a realist epistemology.5 Indeed it was for him a moral necessity. Mansel's epistemology of religion is representative. Mansel is well aware of the classical objections to a representative theory of perception. Indeed, he uses them.6 But in religion there is no escape from representationalism, and its difficulties must be accepted. And Maurice's religious objection misfires, as Chretien pointed out.7 Far from being subversive of practical religion, Mansel's theory gives to it its proper priority over theology, and its place in relation to human nature. ,We are not called upon to live two distinct lives in this world. .. . Our heavenly affections must in some measure take their source and their form from our earthly ones.'8 Mansel stands for continuity between things human and things divine. God mercifully attaches us to himself by engaging our human thoughts and affections. 'We must remain content with the belief that we have that knowledge of God which is best adapted to our wants and training. How far that knowledge repre sents God as He is, we know not, and we have no need to know.'9 When we abandon the vain attempt to determine how far our representations are descriptive of God, and examine them instead in relation to man's religious and moral training, they make sense. Religion is a practical 1 Lectures on the Study of History (1861), p. 80. Mill made the same objection. 1 E.g., Limits5, pp. 50 n., 56 n., 104, etc. 3 What is Revelation ?

Our representations of God are 'regulatively true' in so far as they are well adapted to our moral and religious needs. Faith adopts the scriptural representations of God as regulative of the religious affections, and religious and moral activity, and therefore believes that the God who has so wonderfully adapted his revelation to human nature does not wholly misrepresent himself in doing so. The use of analogical language to speak of God is thus always an act of faith. The role of such language in regulating man's conduct and affections is accessible to thought: that it corresponds in some measure to the divine reality is a matter of faith—that is, we trust that God does not entirely deceive us. We do not know, and have no need to know, any more. Mansel is such a byword for chilly logic and austere high church toryism that it is most important to stress the humanism of his idea of religion. He adopts Jacobi's formula, 'Naturè conceals God: Man reveals God',1 and in doing so has in mind not man the thinker, but man as a moral agent, man who 'learns to pray before he learns to reason'.2 At the time of his marriage in 1855 he wrote warmly, and entirely seriously, about the necessity of that state of life, if studious persons are not to be deformed emotionally by their pursuits.3 To Mansel the power of the Christian revelation to develop human nature to its full capacity is a most important evidence of its truth, and the God who wills to be thought of as Father and Husband not only enriches those natural relations, but is known in them. Revelation is adapted to our powers of thought, moral activity, and affection alike; but still more to human nature as a whole, 'that system to whose inmost centre and outer most circumference the whole system of Christian Faith so strangely yet so fully adapts itself. It is to the whole Man that Christianity appeals: it is as a Whole and in relation to the whole Man that it must be judged.'4 It is startling to see that, when Mansel attacks the Hegelians for sub stituting a 'mutilated humanity for one exalted and entire',5 he is speaking of the humanity of God in his revelation in a way which reminds us of the later Karl Barth. Mansel's all-or-nothing style of argument, his defence of scriptural anthropomorphism, and his insistence on the concrete historical Christ have led people to see in him a rigid fundamentalist. This is not entirely just: Mansel is rather concerned for a wholeness, a 'kindness' (in the archaic sense) which he finds in orthodoxy and would not see diminished. 1 H. L.

We conclude by setting it in its context in Mansel's apologetic, so that in that context we may see how it works, and what it illuminates. Mansel once summarized 'the principal doctrine' maintained in the Bampton Lectures as follows:1 1. 1. That the Absolute Nature of God is unknown to man. 2. That conceptions derived from human consciousness do not represent the Absolute Nature of God. 3. That God is revealed in Scripture by means of relative conceptions, accommodated to man's faculties. These are, Mansel holds, not three different doctrines, but different formulations of the same doctrine. We shall examine them in turn. x.x. The Absolute Nature of God is unknown to man. Mansel usually used the term, the Absolute, as a noun, meaning 'that which exists in and by itself, having no necessary relation to any other being'.2 As such it apparently did not denote only God, for he also uses it as a synonym for Kant's Ding an sich, an object considered as it is in itself out of relation to a knowing subject.3 When speaking of 'the philosphy of the absolute', he used it in the sense of the absolute totality of idealist philosophy.4 Mansel ran into difficulties with this word. For one thing, if 'absolute' means 'out of all relations, including that of knowledge', then the proposition that the absolute nature of God is unknown to man becomes a tautology. Again, some churchmen criticized Mansel for employing a term as foreign to scripture as it is superfluous to theology.3 Mill thought that the notion of the absolute was a non-notion, put up by Mansel solely to be knocked down.6 Rather than attempt to defend Mansel amid all this confusion, it is probably best to interpret him as meaning only that our thoughts of God fall short, and must always fall short, of what God is. And this distinction, between what God is in the mind, and what he is in himself, can be established, not of course by comparing the two, but by examin ing our actual attempts to think God. What Mansel says about our inability to conceive God (i.e. to form a concept of him which is clear, distinct, and constitutive) may seem odd when one thinks of the appeal to our concept of God which is made by those who use the ontological argument for his existence. For that argument seems to rest upon our supposed ability to conceive God 1 Limits', p. xx. 2 Limits', p. 31. 3 LLR, p. 171; cf.

In fact, however (though of course he agrees with Hume and Kant in rejecting the ontological proof), Mansel could have claimed some support from Anselm. For Anselm says that, as well as thinking of God as that than which a greater cannot be thought, it is also possible to think of him as that which is greater than can be thought.1 We can in a sense think that there is that which is ineffable and incon ceivable even though we cannot say what it is.2 Thus Anselm distin guishes God in so far as we are able to think him from God as surpassing thought, in a way not unlike Mansel, who distinguishes God in his absolute nature (of whom we must believe that he is infinite, personal, etc., without being able to conceive how he can be these things) from God as he is in the mind, represented by a complex and imperfect body of imagery. The difference is that Anselm thinks that the various elements of the concept of God in the mind are coherent (and therefore, for him, the concept is constitutive), whereas Mansel thinks they are not. There are theologians today who would say that God as he is himself is inaccessible to, or even of no interest to theology, which is concerned only with what God is for men.2 Mansel does not quite agree. For him theology is continually haunted by the thought of God's transcendence, even though that thought can never be brought to perfect clarity in reflection. Thought's awareness of its own limits, and aspiration after that which transcends them, sets in motion the sense that this life is a pilgrimage, and the hope that faith will pass into sight. Peter Chretien,4 and after him Maurice,5 suggested that on Mansel's view the beatific vision must be a priori impossible. For if our finitude makes it impossible for us to know God as he is now, it will surely continue to do so hereafter. Mansel, however, undoubtedly did affirm the beatific vision; but strictly as an object of faith.6 Maurice's ruling thought was the adequacy and the finality of our present knowledge of God, Mansel's the imperfection of our present knowledge, and the hope which that imperfection inspires. In the current slang, Mansel's eschato logy is futuristic, Maurice's is realized. In 1857 Maurice published The The Epistles of St. John against Mansel, maintaining 'on St. John's authority . . . not only that the knowledge of God is possible for men, but that it is the foundation of all knowledge of men and of things ; that 1 Proslogion, xv; ed.

Mansel says that we cannot know God, Maurice that we cannot not know God. This difference extends interestingly into Christology, as we shall see. 2. Conceptions derived from human consciousness do not represent the Absolute Absolute Nature of God. Any claim to the contrary must lead to ration alism. For if we have independently of scripture either direct intuition of God, or exact representations of God, we have in that knowledge something more perfect than scripture offers us; something which therefore can be used as a criterion for interpreting, evaluating, and criticizing scripture. Now Mansel does have a natural theology, although it is carefully confined within the limits of thought. He borrowed elements from Schleiermacher and Kant in declaring the roots of religion to lie in certain permanent facts of consciousness, of which the two chief are the feeling of dependence upon a power beyond ourselves, and the consciousness of moral obligation.2 The former teaches us to think of the power of God, the latter of his moral demand; and the two are in a dialectical tension, for as utterly dependent we are not morally active ז and as morally active we are not entirely dependent. In neither are we directly aware of the infinite as such. Thus our very first religious awareness makes us aware of the paradoxes and the limits of religious thought. It may be our duty to believe that God is both personal and infinite, but it is certainly not within our power to conceive how he can be both.3 So for Mansel natural theology and the theology of revelation alike only attain to regulative truth. Revelation differs from natural theology not in offering us a different kind of knowledge of God, but in having supreme authority. Mansel is remembered as an extreme upholder of the authority and finality of revelation, and has therefore often been compared with Karl Barth.4 This could be very misleading. For modern 1 Letter to J. N. Langley in Maurice's Life (1884), vol. ii, p. 3x1. 22 Mansel's natural theology is outlined in Metaphysics, pp. 61&lt;)b~22b; and Limits5,Limits5, pp. 73-94. 3 In one passage Mansel seems to imply that one criterion of a genuine revelation is its consonance with this natural theology: 'The Personality of God disappears in the Pantheism of India, His Infinity is lost sight of in the Poly theism of Greece.' {Limits5, p. 106 ; and note on this pp. 282 f.). This is somewhat inconsistent with his general denial of any a priori criteria of the authenticity of a revelation, unless it be a further application of the negative moral criterion mentioned in Limits5, p. 165. * * The comparison was first made by Edwyn Bevan, Symbolism and Belief, (1938), pp. 324 f.</page><page sequence="18">MANSEL'S THEORY OF REGULATIVE TRUTH 121 theologians of revelation often associate their assertions of its authority with a claim that in revelation 'God reveals himself'; that God gives in revelation an immediate personal acquaintance with himself. This claim has been criticized lately, and the criticism extended to the concept of revelation as such.1 Mansel, however, strongly affirms the supreme authority of revelation without associating that affirmation with the modern and dubious notion that in revelation the believer is brought into immediate communion with God. It was important to Mansel, then, to defend the authority of revelation as a whole against the rationalists who denied its authority, and also the dogmatists who mistook its character. Mansel held that the responsibility for the outbreak of malignant rationalism in his time lay with Kant. Kant's aims had been commend able; but he had failed to execute them consistently. His first critique had shown the impossibility of a philosophy of the absolute by demon strating the contribution which the mind itself makes to the formation of all its cognitions. But Kant, after having shown that the thing-in itself, out of relation to the mind, is unattainable by consciousness, had unaccountably added that 'the Speculative Reason has a partial and regulative consciousness of it, and the Practical Reason completely attains to it. The force of self-contradiction could go no further.'2 No satisfactory account was given by Kant of the genesis of the ideals of reason in the mind, and his moral proofs of freedom, God, and immortality are a 'tissue of fallacies'. What was worse, they were used by him, in a spirit of 'unlimited rationalism', in an a priori criticism of revelation.3 Encouraged by this example, Kant's successors spread the spirit of rationalism by attempting in various ways to re-establish that contact with the absolute which his first critique should have for ever precluded. Idealist philosophers abandoned the thing-in-itself and built upon the method of the transcendental deduction, to achieve in turn a deduction of consciousness as such, and then a deduction of all reality. They claimed to have achieved a philosophy of the absolute. Coleridge, the parent of a line of English intuitionists, distinguished the discursive understanding from intuitive reason, a mystical faculty by which man might enjoy immediate knowledge of divine things in the old platonic 1 F. G. Downing, Has Christianity a Revelation ? (1964). 2 LLR, p. 173. 3 Ibid., pp. 172-82. In this criticism of Kant (as in much else) Mansel follows Sir William Hamilton's Edinburgh Review article of October 1829, vol. 1, pp. 194-221; reprinted in Hamilton's Discussions &amp;c. (1852). On the influence of Kant in Britain see R. Wellek, Immanuel Kant in England 1793-1838 (1931)•</page><page sequence="19">122 DON CUPITT manner.1 Schleiermacher found the essence of religion in a feeling of absolute independence which, by a transition more dexterous than logical, he made out to be a feeling of dependence on the absolute; and he found many English disciples. Mansel was impartial in his criticism of all this: We cannot indeed reason to the existence of an infinite Cause from the presence of finite effects, or contemplate the infinite in a finite mode of knowledge; but neither can we feel the infinite in the form of a finite affection, nor discern it as the law of a finite action.2 In England, Mansel was particularly aware of the dangers of rationalism in the person of a Francis Newman, and of the dangers of intuitionism in the Coleridgeans and their like. For Francis Newman, as conscience is the organ of moral truth, so the soul is 'that side of human nature upon which we are in contact with the Infinite, and with God, the Infinite Personality';3 it is therefore a 'seat of feeling, and thereby thereby the organ of specific information to us, respecting its own subject'.4 Since we are, in the soul, endowed with an adequate organ of religious knowledge, revelation is a matter of inward illumination. No external authoritative revelation is needful, nor indeed possible. The most a book like the Bible can do for us is perhaps help us to explicate our own intuitive certainties, and corroborate them. Guided by this inner light, Newman does not hesitate to criticize not only the morality of the God of the Old Testament (this was common among his contemporaries) but that of Jesus as he is represented in the New.5 But the more orthodox intuitionists were hardly less dangerous. For reasons which are rather more social than philosophical, John Stuart Mill regarded everyone who disagreed with him as a reactionary and an intuitionist. And Mill held Hamilton's philosophy to be the chief bastion of intuitionism, and Mansel to be his disciple. But this obscures the fact that among Mill's opponents there were very great differences : and there is no doubt that Mansel attacked those who were intuitionists in the sense of claiming that an intuitive knowledge of the infinite is possible to man. Henry Calderwood, for example, was a pupil of Sir William Hamilton who made such a claim in The Philosophy of the Infinite (1854). He sent a copy of his book to the ailing Hamilton, who 1 A good example of the way Coleridge makes this distinction in Aids to Reflection Reflection (Bohn edn., London, 1901), p. 154 n. 2 Limitss, p. 76. 3 The Soul, Its Sorrows and Aspirations; or an Essay towards the Natural History History of the Soul as the True Basis of Theology (1849), p. vii. 4 Ibid., p. 8 (Newman's italics). 5 E.g., Phases of Faith, or Passages from the History of My Creed (1850), pp. 208-14.</page><page sequence="20">MANSEL'S THEORY OF REGULATIVE TRUTH 123 would have none of it.1 Calderwood rewrote his book for the second edition (1861) so as to include criticism of Mansel. Mansel's replies may be found in various places.2 Calderwood claims that there may be a partial knowledge, or an obscure awareness, of the infinite, of which we have intimations, for example, in our awareness of space and time, of the moral law, and in aesthetic awareness. Mansel's reply is that there can be no partial or incomplete knowledge of the infinite, which has no parts. It can only be known as infinite by a mind itself infinite. Thus this kind of intuitionism always, for Mansel, slides into pantheism. Mansel denies that religion can confer upon us extraordinary powers of mind. Like Locke he holds that 'God when he makes the prophet does not unmake the man. He leaves all his faculties in their natural state . . .'.3 No Hanoverian prelate was more implacably hostile to enthusiasm than Mansel. 3. God is revealed in Scripture by means of relative conceptions, accommodated accommodated to maris faculties. If the rationalists sought to overthrow the authority of revelation, the dogmatists mistook its character. Unable to accept the merely regulative function of revealed truth they either took it as speculative, or tried to make it so by allying it with philosophical concepts in a way which did violence to philosophy and theology alike. Mansel, however, insists that the limits of thought are as binding upon the mind in its reception of revelation as in any other of its acts. If we cannot construct a system of theology 'as a system of scientific certainty' from the religious conceptions available to reason alone, neither can we do so from the data of revelation. Hence Mansel's objection to dogmatism, which tries to turn theology into a kind of metaphysics. 'Faith, properly so called, is not constructive but receptive. It cannot supply the missing portions of an incomplete system; though it may bid us to remain content with the deficiency.'4 Faith's business is obedience and hope: 'Action, and not knowledge, is man's destiny and duty in this life.'5 Dogmatism perverts the office of faith. For example, it may claim that the incarnation should be interpreted in association with the metaphysical doctrine of the real existence of an abstract humanity; next, that the incarnation is only intelligible in that associa tion ; next that the metaphysical doctrine must be true in order to safe guard the revealed truth; and finally that metaphysical realism is itself 1 Hamilton's reply is printed in his Lectures on Metaphysics and Logic, edd.

Thus dogmatism 'adds to the word of God' and un naturally yokes faith and reason together to their mutual injury. It has failed to distinguish properly the provinces of faith and reason. It has failed to see that the materials of scripture are not given us to assist our speculation (for which purpose they could hardly be less suited) but to prescribe the pattern of our obedience.1 What then, for Mansel, is the right use of reason in relation to revela tion? For surely his views make theology seem a very odd science. 'What a strange position theology must fall into by the renunciation of its essential object'2 indeed; but philosophy is in no better case. And reason still has a role in relation to our reception of revelation. Even if it lacks positive criteria for evaluating the contents of a supposed revelation (that there may be some negative criteria is indicated above in n. 3, p. 120) reason must still address itself to the evidences.3 Just as we cannot compare our representations of God with the original, but can study them in their regulative office, so we cannot compare a sup posed revelation with the character of the revealer, but we can consider its evidences as addressed to man. So Mansel, like Newman4 (who also followed Butler), argues that we can accumulate probable evidence sufficient to justify a moral certitude that we do right in submitting unconditionally to a particular authority. In the case of the Christian revelation there are numerous presumptions to be drawn from its character, the circumstances of its promulgation, the persons who first propagated it, the documents wherein we have records of these things, the subsequent history of the church, and so on. The matter being considered as a whole, we may arrive at a moral certainty in the light of which we may reasonably think particular objections to be mistaken and particular difficulties not insuperable. In intention, at least, Mansel's theology is highly conservative, even though, in following Butler, he made explicit some things which that grave divine left obscure.5 Like Butler he finds the principal evidence of Christianity in a comprehensive analogy between the Christian scheme and the constitution and course of nature—especially human nature. But, as Professor C. D. Broad has pointed out,6 this analogy, 1 Limits5, pp. 1-22. 2 Julius Miiller, quoted by Mansel; ibid., p. 121. 33 Limitss, p. 162. * * E.g., Essay on Development (1845), ii. 2; Grammar of Assent (1870), vii. 2. 5 There was gossip that the fuss over The Limits cost Mansel his bishopric {Henry{Henry Sidgwick, A Memoir (1906), p. 74). On the other hand we have it on much better authority that his opposition to German philosophy helped him to a deanery (Buckle's Disraeli, vol. v (1920), p. 67). 6 'Bishop Butler as a Theologian', in Religion, Philosophy and Psychical Research (1953), p. 207.</page><page sequence="22">MANSEL'S THEORY OF REGULATIVE TRUTH 125 this mutual adaptation, is not quite sufficient to show that the author of the Christian scheme is identical with the author of human nature. Other explanations of the analogy are possible. For surely, in a great religious tradition, evolved over many centuries in the thought of many able men in several cultures, it would be very surprising if the religious system were not adapted to human nature ? The point is a good one, but does not quite settle the matter. The original documents set limits. So a Christian might claim that what is said of sin, grace, and forgiveness in the New Testament is *adapted to human nature'1 in a way in which what is said about the same subjects in the Koran is not: and no amount of cultural diversification, theological elaboration, or accumulated worldly wisdom can alter the original documents, or their continuing effect in the tradition.2 One might refer here to the attempts of Professor R. N. Smart to work out methods of inter-religious debate, and ask whether Mansel has anything to contribute. However that may be, for Mansel the comprehensive human fitting ness of the Christian revelation was a fact, and was summed up in the incarnation. Hence he resisted fiercely the Hegelian attempt to turn Christ into an abstract principle of the universal identity of the divine and human spirits. In the main Mansel's Christology was as orthodox as that of Liddon. He seems to have been unaware of the early kenotic Christologies, speaking in the very last of his published writings, an unfinished commentary on St. Matthew, of the omniscience of the incarnate Lord.3 But orthodox though he was, Mansel's doctrine of regulative truth could not but affect his treatment of Christ as the reve lation of God. His contrast with Maurice in this respect emerges interestingly in the controversy between them. Consider Mansel's exegesis of John xiv. 8 f. in the following sentences : Does human wisdom seek, by some transcendental form of intuition, to behold God as He is in His infinite nature ; repeating in its own manner the request of Philip, *Lord, show us the Father, and it sufficeth us' ? Christ Himself has given the rebuke and the reply: *He that hath seen me hath seen the Father; and how sayest thou then, Shew us the Father?'4 It is wrong to ask to see the Father: we should be content with Christ. I do not regard the manifestation of God in the flesh, as a direct mani festation of the Absolute and Eternal Essence of the Deity; but as the י For Mansel as for Butler 'human nature' was of course not merely a psychological concept; it was moral concept as well, and more yet. 22 For the purposes of the present argument this example is only hypothetical. 3 The Speaker's Commentary : New Testament, vol. i (1878), p. 160b; on Matt, xxvi. 39.

Maurice's view was the opposite. Before ever he crossed swords with Mansel he could write of the Cross as a *complete exhibition' of God's character.3 For him the text, 'He that hath seen me hath seen the Father', had a quite different meaning. Christ is the revelation of God's inmost being, his infinite glory actually unveiled before our eyes. God is in no sense other than Christ, so that there might be here or hereafter some other more adequate revelation of God. He is the final and complete revelation of God. To know him is to know the Father. Mansel was puzzled by the vehemence of Maurice. What did he mean?mean? Mansel suggests that Maurice meant this: The Incarnation of Christ as a Man was not the assumption, by the Son of God, of a new nature; but an unveiling to man of that which had existed from all eternity. He seems to maintain that God the Son is, in His Eternal and Infinite Essence, very and perfect Man ; and that, in His manifestation to the world in the likeness of sinful flesh, He did not 'empty himself, taking the form of a servant', but manifested His Divine Glory in all its infinite perfection. ... he apparently regards Christ's In carnation as a direct exhibition of the Infinite.4 Mansel makes the barest mention of Alexandria. Soon after both Mansel and Maurice were dead, William Forster talked with Samuel Wilberforce, saying that the great issue of the day was faith in God as personal: 'The one man I ever heard preach who really put that forward was Mansell: F. Maurice somewhat, but obscure in his statements.'5 That remark calls in question the common verdict upon Mansel, and we have explored some of the complexities it conceals.
