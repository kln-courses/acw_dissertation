<plain_text><page sequence="1">16 Visualising fertility at Artemis Orthia's site Nicki Waugh STARTING IN THE PAST . . . The sanctuary of Artemis Orthia is located in the NW of the ancient Spartan polis, beside the Eurotas River. This examination is situated in two periods of the sanctuary's existence: the first in the Archaic period, roughly 800-500 BC, and the second in the early part of the 1900s when it was excavated by the British School at Athens under the direction of R. M. Dawkins. The excavation ran from 1906 to 1910 with the findings published in the Annual of the British School at Athens1 and a later monograph,2 which gathered together all the excavation reports along with numerous photos and illustrations. The final chapter of the mono- graph addressed the nature of the cult itself and was written by H. J. Rose. Rose noted3 that the goddess was addressed as 'Orthia' (with varying spellings) for most of her sanctuary's existence; it was not until the Flavian period that there was epigraphic evidence of her being referred to as 'Artemis Orthia'.4 However, he con- sidered that 'she cannot be identical, although she might be identified with the Panhellenic Artemis'.5 His reason for this identification was 'probably to be found in the fact that Orthia, like Artemis, is a deity of fertility of men and beasts'.6 As evidence for this Rose included the following: a connection with the birth goddess Eileithyia, terracotta images of nude females, ivory representations of a possible male consort, terracotta ithyphallic figurines, the presence of images of animals, her role as kourotrophos and a vegetation fertility aspect, which he saw through an association of the cult with Alkman's Archaic poem, the Partheneion.1 Without any desire to set Rose up as a straw man, his interpretation can act as an intriguing starting point for a re-examination, which may shed light not just on the artefacts themselves, but the history of how the votive images have been viewed since excavation. There is insufficient space here to discuss all of Rose's suggestions, so this paper will review a limited number of them. I shall seek to problematise an interpretation which continues to be accepted in scholarship many years after the report's original publication and raise questions to be addressed in future research. EILEITHYIA Rose's first reason for considering Artemis Orthia to be a fertility goddess was an association with the birth goddess, Eileithyia.8 According to Pausanias (3.17.1), Eileithyia had a sanctuary not far from Artemis Orthia's, and tiles stamped hierou Eleusias were found in the first year of excavation,9 although no trace of the building from which they might have come was discovered and no date is provided for them. A die inscribed with Eleuthias in 'Archaic' writing was also found, as well as two terracotta figurines (fig. 16.1) which the excavators interpreted as offerings to Eileithyia.10 Dawkins described the figurines as 'a pair of birth- daemons supporting a mother and newly-born child' and 'a woman carrying a child' . 1 1 The figurine on the right, interpreted as a woman carrying a child, had lost her head, and Dawkins noted that a break suggests there may originally have been two children. It is easy to see this interpretation from the photograph; however, the other figurine (on the left) is less easy to understand. First, it is hard to see anything anthropomorphic or 'daemon'- like in the base of the figurine Dawkins has illustrated. Second, the two upper figures, which he interpreted as mother and newly-born child, are also problematic: they are facing each other and would appear to be embracing with their arms round each other and faces touching. A lack of differentiation in size between the two makes an interpretation of mother and child - let alone a newly-born child - somewhat difficult. i Dawkins 1907, 1908, 1909, 1910a, 19 10Z&gt;. 2 Dawkins 1929. 3 Rose 1929, 400. 4 Dawkins 1929, 293. 5 Rose 1929,401. 6 Rose 1929,402. 7 For a discussion of Artemis Orthia's kourotrophic role and possible associations with Alkman's Partheneion see Waugh forthcoming. 8 Rose 1929,402. 9 Dawkins 1929, 51. io Dawkins 1929, 51. il Dawkins 1929, 51.</page><page sequence="2">160 NICKI WAUGH Fig. 16.1 (above).

Dawkins noted that the two figurines were found with the debris from the Archaic temple,12 yet still considered that they were offerings to Eileithyia. But if they came from Orthia's temple, as the rest of the debris around the Archaic temple did, how can they be Eileithyia's votives? And if they were offerings to Eileithyia, how can they be evidence for Orthia being a fertility goddess? Rose's explanation is that 'the connexion between the two goddesses must assuredly have been fairly close in function, since it was so in locality; if not, then they are meant for Orthia, who thus appears, like Artemis herself, as a goddess of birth'.13 But are we sure that Artemis 's association with childbirth is appropriate at this time, and from an archaeological perspective is it possible to say that two figurines are sufficient to define the character of the deity? NUDE FIGURINES Of the votives, Rose considered that a number of terracotta figurines of nude females represented Orthia's role as a fertility goddess (fig. 16.2). He commented that they were in the pose of the Knidean Aphrodite and suggested that they either indicated an association with Aphrodite or with 'her functions of giving fertility'.14 There are two issues here. First, the images Rose refers to are numerically insignificant in comparison with the images of the goddess clothed. Only three figurines out of the total 12 nude females could be viewed as representing the Aphrodite of Knidos pose, that is with one hand over the groin (fig. 16.2.2 and 16.2.7 - there were two examples of no. 7 found). Against these, there were 121 images of clothed terracotta females, and this number excludes figurines of a female enthroned, or depicted with standing lions, or mounted on horseback. Interestingly, these clothed females are generally referred to by the excavators as 'Orthia,' while the nude figurines are discussed separately and are described as 'nude female figures'. At no time in his examination of these figurines does Dawkins call them 'Orthia'.15 The discrepancy is an intriguing perspective into the perceptions of the excavators themselves. The second issue is one of interpretation. Is the lack of clothing necessarily indicative of fertility? Could it not be an indication of sexuality? As these figurines predate the Knidean Aphrodite by roughly 300 years (the figurines are dated to mid-seventh century BC, and the Aphrodite of Knidos by Praxiteles was fourth century BC), any direct association is somewhat unlikely, and furthermore, Praxiteles' statue is usually remembered for the sexuality of the image rather than 12 Dawkins 1929, 51. 13 Rose 1929, 402. 14 Rose 1929, 402. 15 Dawkins 1929, 152.</page><page sequence="3">VISUALISING FERTILITY AT ARTEMIS ORTHIA 'S SITE 1 6 1 Fig. 16.3. Line drawings of ivory plaques, interpreted as 'Master of Animals' (Dawkins 1929, pl. 99.1-2). fertility. The gesture of placing the hand over the groin does draw the viewer's attention to this area, and three of the other figurines have clearly delineated breasts (fig. 16.2.1, 16.2.5 and 16.2.6). Marinatos has suggested that the sexuality of female nudes could have an apotropaic and protective function, and while there are many difficulties with her theory,16 it does serve to problematise interpretations which simply equate female nudity with fertility. MALE FIGURE AMONG THE IVORIES Rose noted the presence of a winged male figure among the ivories and suggested that as this figure replicated one of the goddess's poses (that of the potnia theron or 'mistress of animals') (fig. 16.3), this male could be a divine or semi-divine consort, which he felt was 'a very appropriate feature in the mythology of a goddess of fertility'.17 To do Rose justice, he also observed that he would not place too much stress on these images, and suggested that the presence of the winged male could have represented an Oriental influence. Particular emphasis has, in fact, been laid on these male images by a more recent scholar, Jane Carter, who has suggested that Orthia might be identified with the Near Eastern goddess Asherah or Tanit and that the cult at Sparta was established by Phoenicians.18 She cited the masks excavated at the site, as well as the male consort, as evidence of a transferrai of a fertility cult from the Near East, and further suggested that Alkman's Partheneion celebrated the offering of a robe to the goddess on the occasion of her annual ritual marriage, with the bridegroom wearing one of the idealised masks.19 Carter's work highlights methodological issues in interpreting a Greek sanctuary and cult in terms of Near Eastern images and culture. Even if it is possible to trace the adoption of imagery from the Near East at Sparta, we cannot assume that there was an equal transference of meaning - let alone the full transplanting of a cult. Further, Julia Assante has noted that interpretations of Mesopotamian imagery which view erotic representations and texts in terms of fertility are generally based on the outdated theories as exemplified in Frazer's Golden Bough.â„¢ Where 1 6 Marinatos (2000, 27-3 1 ) draws on Near Eastern images as a source for representations of nude females in eighth century BC Greek material culture. However, she does not appear to take into consideration methodological issues such as recognising the temporal and contextual position of the Near Eastern images (rather she treats the images of Mesopotamia, Syro-Palestine and Egypt as a homogenous group), and further, does not discuss the issue of how meaning could necessarily be transmitted along with an artistic motif. Other interpretations have been offered. Powell has suggested that it could be an early version of the whipping rite at the site and that in the Archaic period the ritual included a violent sexual element; that the figure being penetrated from behind is being whipped by the person having sex with him, and that the fleeing figure in the extreme left of the frieze is running away from a similar violent attack from the hairy satyr- like figure and that the defecation of the fleeing figure represents the fear inherent in the scene (Powell 1 998, 1 30-5). 17 Rose 1929. 402 18 Carter 1987, 1988. 19 Carter 1988, 98. 20 Assante 2003, 13^7.</page><page sequence="4">162 NICKI WAUGH Fig. 16.4 (left). Line drawing of ivory plaque of man and woman holding wreath (Dawkins 1929, pl. 94). Fig. 16.5 (above). Terracotta plaque of man and woman holding wreath (Dawkins 1929, 154, fig. 109). previous scholars have seen sacred marriage and fertility rituals, Assante has argued for educational love poetry (which placed sex in terms of agricultural metaphors to make it familiar to the sexually unini- tiated) and domestic magic or political messages.21 For this reason studies such as Carter's, which consider the transference of meaning from the Near East to Greece to include fertility, require revision and updating. While the male images are most frequent among the ivory votives, they have a much wider iconography than just the 'masters of animals' motif, appearing in mythological scenes, as warriors or in scenes with women.22 One motif, that of a man and woman holding a wreath between them (FIG. 16.4), appears not only in ivory but also on a terracotta plaque excavated at the site (fig. 16.5). The motif also occurs on an Archaic stele now in the Sparta Museum. Pipili has suggested it could represent Helen and Menelaos or perhaps Helen and Paris and she comments that the wreath is a frequent image as a symbol of love and marriage.23 Wreaths also appear as votives in their own right among the little lead figurines at Orthia's sanctuary. Cavanagh and Laxton noted in 1984, in their study of the lead figurines at Helen's own sanctuary, the Menelaion, that more than half of the 6,000 lead votives were in the form of wreaths.24 This further problematises the question of whether lead wreaths were a generic offering at any Spartan sanctuary, or whether there was any specific significance associated with them. ITHYPHALLIC MALES Male figures are not restricted to the ivory votives, although strictly speaking the 'master of animals' image is. Rose noted that the site has yielded hundreds of male representations, and although they are less numerous than images of females, their presence could not be overlooked.25 He further comments that their significance cannot be said to have been fully discovered.26 From the (possible) perspective of fertility the terracotta ithyphallic figurines are intriguing, not least for the way in which the excavators treat them. Of the around 300 handmade terracotta figurines, 121 of these are mentioned as ithyphallic. However, in the published photograph of them, all are examples where the phallus has broken off (FIG. 1 6.6). This demonstration of social niceties at the time of excavation and publication is also visible in the treatment of FIG. 16.6.1 1. Dawkins 's description was: 'Figures of women in a sitting posture with the legs apart; the pudenda are often marked conspicuously.

Right: stone figurine with both male and female genitalia (Dawkins 1929, pls. 63.7, 64.9). examples - 11 were found - range over the sixth and fifth centuries.' Then he stated 'the figurine on the plate, showing no signs of sex, may perhaps be a grotesque tumbler'.27 Needless to say there are no figurai plates of these women in the text of the book; they are simply not illustrated. Rose also managed to completely exclude them from his discussion of the nature of the cult. Two ithyphallic representations were found in stone, both now on display in the Sparta Museum (fig. 16.7). One depicts a little figure carved in the round whose legs have broken off, and the second, described as a roughly cylindrical piece of stone on which four faces above four sets of sexual organs are depicted, male and female alternately. Rose did not mention these pieces either. One kylix fragment found at the site should also be mentioned in this context: FIG. 16.8. It is in the Sparta Museum and has been dated to c. 580-575 BC by Stibbe, who considered it to be from the workshop of the Naukratis Painter, an artist of early sixth-century Lakonian figure pottery.28 The interior part of the fragment depicts cocks and a hen, and was illustrated and described in great detail by Droop.29 The exterior frieze is described simply as 'a figure scene of the less edifying kind painted with great care and gusto'.30 The scene was first illustrated by Lane, who included both a photograph and a line drawing.31 But for all his liberality in illustrating the fragment, he was still delicate in describing the scene itself, initially calling it 'country revels' and then describing four of the figures, whom he considered to be women, as follows: 'two [are] engaged in a grotesque dance, one in a symplegma, the last in by-play of another kind'.32 The meaning of this unique scene is still unclear. Pipili has suggested that it could be part of a ritual in honour of Orthia 'whose cult must have included such obscene dances since she was a fertility deity'.33 She 27 Dawkins 1929, 156. 28 Stibbe 1972,221. 29 Droop 1929, 85, fig. 68. 30 Droop 1929, 85. 31 Lane 1933^, pls. 39a-40. 32 Lane 1933^, 137, 160. 33 Pipili 1987, 65.

Line drawing of Laconian III kylix fragment (Lane 1933/4, pi 39a). bases this primarily on her interpretation of the Lakonian satyr (on the vase fragment this is the hairy figure with the phallus, second on the left of the frieze) as an 'impersonal fertility daemon'.34 Dawkins suggested that some of the little terracotta figurines excavated could represent satyrs;35 however, as Lissarrague has noted, satyrs are more associated with an excessive sexuality that is often unfulfilled rather than specifically with fertility.36 It is also perhaps notable that the 'satyr' on the vase fragment is not actually ithyphallic, as the penis, while over-sized, is not erect but rather hangs down between the figure's legs. The sex act on the fragment also draws the image into the realms of sexuality rather than necessarily fertility, which highlights a question - are sex and fertility the same thing? Rose considered the ithyphallic images to testify to the goddess's interest in the increase of mankind,37 but there is little in the iconography to suggest an association with human reproduction in these images. This is particularly apparent if the penetrated figure on the kylix fragment is interpreted as male.38 As noted earlier, representations associated with childbirth or children are rare and problematic. Phalloi could also perhaps be interpreted as apotropaic, with their association with boundaries and Herms, which further muddles the automatic interpretation of ithyphallic figures, or those depicted with large penises, as representing fertility. 'LOWER ANIMALS9 Along with the ithyphallic figurines, Rose noted the presence of a 'great number [of terracotta figurines] representing the lower animals, sometimes alone, sometimes in conjunction with the figure of the goddess'.39 He continues: 'If these were all figures of sacrificial animals, they might be explained as simply poor people's substitutes for real victims; but horses and lions are included among them, and the latter at least were certainly not sacrificed in Sparta.' He therefore concludes that the images represent the goddess's interest in the increase of 'lower animals, whether wild or tame'.40 Lions and horses are actually among the most popular animal representations at the site and both appear iconographically with the goddess (fig. 16.9). The types of animal include those who fit the model as possible sacrificial substitutes: birds (especially popular in ivory), bulls and cattle, pigs and boars, rams and sheep, fish, hares and goats. Animals associated with the Panhellenic Artemis are also present. Deer are particularly popular after c. 500 BC and become the only animal image from this time to be represented in lead; bears and dogs also appear. More unusual animal images include lizards, snakes (a popular Lakonian image), two possible representations of monkeys, scorpions, tortoises, frogs, ants, snails and a spider. There is no iconographical indication of fecundity associated with the representations; they are not depicted as pregnant or with young, which makes an assumption of fertility and increase difficult to accept. Some of the animals existed locally (for example lizards, ants, spiders, tortoise, scorpions, frogs and horses), so perhaps this is why they appear at the sanctuary. However, this does not explain the presence of less local animals such as monkeys and lions, and so emphasises that an immediate explanation of these votives is not possible. 34 Pipili 1987, 68. 35 Dawkins 1929, 152. 36 Lissarrague 1993, 207-20. 37 Rose 1929, 402. 38 Powell 1998, 31. 39 Rose 1929,402. 40 Rose 1929, 4U2.</page><page sequence="7">VISUALISING FERTILITY AT ARTEMIS ORTHIA 'S SITE 1 65 Fig. 16.9. Terracotta figurines of female (interpreted as goddess) with lions (top) and horses (bottom) (Dawkins 1929, pi 32.1-5). OTHER CONSIDERATIONS -WHERE TO NOW? Finally, to step back from Rose's list, it is interesting to see what material he did not choose. He did not choose the masks, although Carter included them in her interpretation. He did not discuss the frequent images of the gorgon; nor the significance of the potnia theron or 'mistress of animals' motif, even though he considered the male versions of the pose to be important. The question of sex is also not addressed. In a discussion following Carter's later article, one scholar is recorded as commenting that as Orthia was a virgin then surely the rituals were more likely to be those of initiation for young girls than a sacred marriage. Carter replied that Orthia 's connection to Artemis was late and that she was not originally a virgin.41 However, epigraphic evidence suggests that Orthia was in fact considered to be Ã£parthenos significantly prior to the Flavian inscription associating her with Artemis, such as on a late seventh or early sixth century bc limestone relief of a horse.42 But, like Carter, Rose dismissed this aspect of Orthia (considering the title to be almost another name for Artemis) and instead focused on fertility as the basis for the association between Artemis and Orthia.43 Presumably Rose and Carter considered a virgin could not be associated with fertility - but is this not a modern perception? By ignoring the title given to Orthia by her worshippers, and refusing to explore what connotations this may have had, how are we to understand or interpret the cult? This is not to claim that these images are evidence for fertility or that virginity is a counter-indication, but simply that they are all aspects of Orthia's cult which should be included in any interpretation of the nature of the goddess. And this really leads to the questions going forward - how do we, as modern scholars, determine what images at an ancient sanctuary are significant? Are they those which appear in high numbers and in various media and periods? Are they those which appear in other contexts in the same polis or timescale? Are they even those elements which are unusual or uncommon? Some scholars would argue that by even excavating a site we are interpreting the material;44 in what is kept and what is thrown away, what is chosen to be published, to be illustrated, to be discussed, and in many ways the choices made by Dawkins and his team would not be those made today. We cannot place ourselves on a pedestal compared with our predecessors: Dawkins 's application of stratigraphy at Artemis Orthia's site was ground-breaking in its day.45 But equally to accept their conclusions, without recognising that they were asking questions and holding assumptions that could be very different to ours, is to build castles on sand foundations. Archaeological theory has long acknowledged the need to recognise that our own culture affects our interpretations of the past. Some would suggest that it is impossible to remove our perceptions from our investigations and therefore all we will ever find is the past we want or deserve.46 Others have noted that attempts to investigate ancient meanings without an appropriate background can lead to reconstructions that border on science fiction.47 Renfrew, discussing the archaeology of religion from a cognitive theoretical approach, has noted that a coherent methodology has not yet been established for analysing meaning in complex figurative systems, which definitely includes ancient Greece.48 Are we then to give up? Is it feasible for us to think we can recognise ancient distinctions of meaning? Can we know what the ancient Greeks considered fertility 41 Carter 1988, 98. 42 Limestone carving no. 28; inscription 169. 1 : Dawkins 1929, 191,367. 43 Rose 1929, 401-2. 44 Thomas 2004, 22. 45 Boardman 1963, 1. 46 Thomas 2004. 47 Flannery and Marcus 1998, 46. 48 Renfrew 2000, 53.</page><page sequence="8">166 NICKI WAUGH to be? Can we hope to distinguish between woman and goddess, man and god (or consort?), sacrifice and fertility, or fertility and sexuality? What is fertility - or rather, what was fertility? Was it an erect penis, a nude woman, a group of animals, or a collection of wreaths? And finally was this all that Orthia was about? Bintliff has highlighted Wittgenstein's description of the archaeologist as a 'craftsman going out on a job with a large bag full of tools - each ideally suited to a particular application within the remit of the profession.'49 For a classical archaeologist these tools include a number of types of analysis which can be applied to the votive material at the site: functionalist analysis of the practical purpose(s) of the material, formal analysis of the style, iconographie analysis of specific motifs, structuralist analysis of recurrent combinations of elements, semiotic investigations into the ways the objects and patterns may refer beyond themselves and hermeneutic interpretations of meaning through context.50 Sourvinou-Inwood has proposed a detailed methodology for the examination of ancient Greek images,51 although she has been criticised for not always following it herself.52 She notes that we need to remove our own cultural filters, and that to attempt a reconstruction of ancient Greek perceptions it is vital to fully understand the context in which the images are located.53 Each set of data must be investigated separately to 'prevent preconceptions and distortions from creeping from one part of the discourse into the other and contaminating it'.54 This is a valid concern to prevent a circularity of argument, but it is difficult to see how this sorting of data can avoid being an interpretation in itself. Sourvinou-Inwood also recognises that images do not necessarily have a fixed meaning and that they can be polysÃ©mie. Meaning is determined by interaction, semantics and perspectives in each context.55 Johnson has called this variety of interpretation 'equi-final', that is, 'capable of being explained equally well in different directions'.56 This is something that I would suggest particularly applies to a study such as this, where the focus is on a concept such as fertility. Why should fertility be an undifferentiated concept? Furthermore, why should the goddess, Artemis Orthia herself, be perceived as having a singular meaning or significance? It is difficult to provide a conclusion for a paper such as this, which is at the beginning of research. It would be hubristic to expect that the methodologies discussed above will automatically lead to an accurate interpretation of ancient Greek perception. But by reviewing and building on our past as classical archaeologists, we have a stronger case for considering our interpretations to reflect the ancient context rather than one based on Victorian social values. My own research will be seeking to answer some of the questions I have raised in this paper by contextuali- sing Artemis Orthia's sanctuary more closely with other Spartan cults and material culture, and applying some of the tools outlined here. In addition, much could be discovered by asking the same questions of sanctuaries beyond Sparta's boundaries; into Arkadia and who knows where from there. But until this research is complete it is perhaps appropriate that the last words go to Rose: 'That we know all about Orthia, or need make no more conjectures, would be an utterly absurd statement; but our present knowledge is to that of the last generation as tolerably clear daylight to fog.'57 49 Bintliff 2004, xix. 50 List taken from Corbey et al 2004, 361-2. 51 Sourvinou-Inwood 1991, 3-23. 52 Barringer 2003. 53 Sourvinou-Inwood 1991, 5-W. 54 Sourvinou-Inwood 1991, 7. 55 Sourvinou-Inwood 1991, 11. 56 Johnson 2004, 105. 57 Rose 1929,406.
