But would that rubric be sufficient to explain the still remarkably strong pull of a his- toriography of the field in terms of its individuals?  The German states of the late eighteenth century comprised one of the main self-proclaimed spatial and temporal intersections where knowledge of classical antiquity was channeled into an institutionalized discipline. It is at this juncture that the figuration of antiquity, or the conception of the ancient past as a quasi-human figure vis-à-vis its observer, assumes a place in conceptualizing modernity and making scholarship a functional part of it.4 The study of antiquity established itself as a discipline that put a high value on the individual and self-reflexivity, that encouraged strategies of personifying especially Greek antiquity, and that in turn also inflected the self-understand- ing of the discipline and its practitioners, suggesting a model of individual ABSTRACT Around the year 1800, Germany saw the establishment of classical scholarship as a disci- pline that valued individual self-reflexivity and encouraged strategies of personification. Much as classi- cal antiquity informed the conception of sentimental Bildung, sentimental Bildung and its cultivation of particular attachments also informed classical scholarship’s model of itself. With research thus concep- tualized as a quasi-personal relationship with antiquity, scholarship could draw on a contemporary language of emotionality. / REPRESENTATIONS 109.

In other words, not only did classical antiq- uity inform the conception of sentimental Bildung, but sentimental Bildung and its cultivation of particular attachments also informed classical scholar- ship’s model of itself. The Potter’s Daughter Johann Joachim Winckelmann’s History of the Art of Antiquity (1764), a work that has remained a reference point for the historiography of art history, closes with a remarkable visualization of the researcher’s act of visualization, of what it means to give an account of the defining culture of a bygone era: I have in this history of art already gone far beyond its bounds; and though in observing its decline I almost feel like someone who, when describing the history of his fatherland, has to touch on its destruction, which he himself has experienced, nevertheless I could not restrain myself from gazing after the fate of works of art as far as my eye could see. Just as a woman in love [Liebste], standing on the shore of the ocean, seeking out with tear-filled eyes her departing lover [Liebhaber] whom she has no hope of ever seeing again, thinks she can glimpse in the distant sail the image of her beloved [Geliebten]; we, like the woman in love [Geliebte], have remain- ing to us, so to speak, only the shadowy outline of our desires [Wünsche]: but this makes the desire [Sehnsucht] for the objects we have lost ever more ardent, and we examine the copies of the original masterpieces with greater attention than we would have done were we to be in full possession of them.5 This passage has been read in the context of Winckelmann’s continuing sig- nificance in the debate over how the twin gestures of historicism and aes- thetic response relate, have related, or should relate in the understanding of art and the practice of art history.6 The splitting off into the voices of the male historian and the female lover gazing out after a no longer visible male beloved may well map onto the split between the objective historian and the connoisseur spectator whose roles and relation to each other were con- sciously negotiated both in contemporary art theory and historiography.7 In this interpretation, the persona of the female lover in analogy to (yet not identity with) the author of the present history writ large—Winckelmann subtly shifts from “I” to “we” in this passage—allows a representation, and maybe also elision, of that tension between systematic history and aesthetic engagement. Yet why this veiled description of longing? Alex Potts has inter- preted this passage as a “ventriloquizing” of female desire “so that his male readers can imagine without inhibition an intense eroticized longing for the ideal manhood conjured up by the Greek ideal”;8 in fact, a larger argument has successfully been made for a new way of giving the erotic an epistemological The Potter’s Daughter’s Sons 123 </page> <page sequence="3"> REP109_05  12/18/09  11:30 AM  Page 124 function, turning the desire for something considered beautiful, and hence valuable, into an instrument of historical criticism and articulating this criti- cism in the language of a decidedly homoerotic and newly developing config- uration.9 And yet, can we open Winckelmann’s significant, homoerotically structured desire and its epistemological function out toward other scholarly attempts to navigate the relationship with antiquity as an aesthetic and criti- cal challenge, beyond the specific constellation Winckelmann offers? The motif of the lover left behind on land has classical precedence, and one can align Winckelmann’s figure with both Penelope, whose cunning can match that of her departing lover, and Ariadne, deserted on an island shore by The- seus.10 Winckelmann’s assertion, though, that “we, like the woman in love, have remaining to us, so to speak, only the shadowy outline of our desires” suggests that yet another female persona is part of this multifigure setup: that of the daughter of a Corinthian potter whom some ancient sources credited with the invention of sculptural art. Chief reference to her comes from Pliny the Elder’s Natural History and his account of the origins, development, and techniques of the visual arts:  On painting we have now said enough, and more than enough; but it will be only proper to append some accounts of the plastic art. Butades, a potter of Sicyon, was the first who invented, at Corinth, the art of modelling portraits in the earth which he used in his trade. It was through his daughter that he made the discovery; who, being deeply in love with a young man about to depart on a long journey, traced the profile of his face, as thrown upon the wall by the light of the lamp. Upon see- ing this, her father filled in the outline, by compressing clay upon the surface, and so made a face in relief, which he then hardened by fire along with other articles of pottery. This model, it is said, was preserved in the Nymphaeum at Corinth, until the destruction of that city by Mummius.11 Motivated by love, using the opportunity to discover a skill, and turning her father into an artisan almost by accident, she represents for Pliny a prehis- tory of sorts herself, placed in a position where she precedes the discussion of the great male artists of antiquity. His account of ancient art had been a staple of writing on art since the seventeenth century, and Winckelmann, too, discusses Pliny in various places throughout his History.12 The girl her- self, often named Butades or Dibutades after her father, became a popular subject in her own right of paintings and poetry during the second half of the eighteenth century, not least because of the significance of line, con- tour, and silhouette, some of the terms associated with her actions, in con- temporary visual arts and theory.13 What can we gain by adding Dibutades’ shadow to a discussion of Winck- elmann’s female lover? In Pliny, she is not an artist to the same degree as her more famous, and named, male successors of antiquity, but her original and nostalgic role in developing an artistic form gives her figure in Winckelmann’s 124 REPRESENTAT IONS </page> <page sequence="4"> REP109_05  12/18/09  11:30 AM  Page 125 account more agency than that of a deserted woman only, especially in view of the “split” between connoisseur and historian that he so subtly negoti- ates.14 Winckelmann releases this inventor of art even more from her rela- tive domestic passivity: he configures her in a situation, showing her gazing out to sea, which he links elsewhere in his writings with the active, epistemo- logical potential of practicing the history of art.15 More importantly, though, Winckelmann’s female figura, nested in the voice of the historian, lets us look beyond (or rather, across from) the visual arts and their history to the interpretation of antiquity in other branches of learning, and thereby isolate more easily the dynamic of attaching personal value to something absent, beautiful, and therefore desirable (regardless of gender or physical beauty, for the moment), as it continues to inflect the articulation of Wissenschaft in the developing field of classical philology and the professionalized study of antiquity as an autonomous discipline. In order to analyze how classical scholarship in its early phases of institu- tional consolidation conceived of its own function and in what language its practitioners articulated what it is they were engaged in, it is useful to treat such “splitting” as we find in Winckelmann’s use of the Dibutades story not only as a story of the self, that is, as an account of modernity as arising from comparison of a past and present self, but also as a split into self and other; a split and structural tension, moreover, that is expressed in a contemporary language of interpersonal, emotional relationships.16 The point, then, is not the logic of a homoerotic desire as such; rather it is the question why the imagery of interpersonal affection, emotionality, and love, some of whose features are also well expressed in the logic of homoeroticism and are predi- cated on acts of personifying ancient Greece and its values, is so effective not just in the special (though far-reaching) case of Winckelmann but also more widely in the scholarly discourse that was establishing itself.  To put it yet differently, the logic of love for what is Greek, beautiful, and past can also be keyed to a quite normative language of intimacy that inter- acts with the self-presentation of the classical scholar as an individual, con- cerned in his research with individuality as a historical subject; with the match of scholar and his object of study; and with the fraught relationship between self and other that is a prominent conundrum in contemporary understandings of love. Beyond an “epistemology of the closet,” such as it could certainly be applied to Winckelmann, there is also an epistemology in which the semantics, code, or language of love, intimacy, and interpersonal relationships become effective in classical scholarship and the understanding of its own practice.17 It should be possible, then, to extend this discussion to include the part played by an erotics of knowledge in the discourses of insti- tutionalized scholarship more broadly, rather than focus on Winckelmann exclusively or on his role in the development of art history. This is not The Potter’s Daughter’s Sons 125 </page> <page sequence="5"> REP109_05  12/18/09  11:30 AM  Page 126 because Winckelmann, or art history for that matter, would not have had a large impact on the study of antiquity; quite the opposite.18 It is because, by not making the discussion conditional upon the visual and the visual arts as an obvious location for the embodied or personified, we can uncouple the structure and dynamics of personification and emotional closeness from their immediate material counterparts and reconsider them also as verbal and rhetorical strategies in their own right.  What does it mean for a scholar of antiquity circa 1800 to speak of love for his subject, and where does this language come from? It is certainly not the case that scholars of scholarship have not been aware of the role desire plays in the structural working of disciplines and their practices.19 Even so, the critical language of desire such as we willingly recognize and employ it in regard to scholarship is one that is largely indebted to the vocabulary of psy- choanalytic criticism and to a focus on power relations, whether in a critical denouncing of the scholar’s desirous gaze, or in a no less critical but also cel- ebratory vision of philology’s renewed empowering potential.20 It may not be surprising that we should talk or think of the implication of feeling in sci- entific discourses and attitudes in terms of a post-Freudian understanding of desire—not least because of Freud’s own indebtedness to the texts and lan- guage of antiquity and his use of classical knowledge in the development of his theories of the psyche. What I suggest is a complementary perspective from which to historicize the “knowledge equals desire” formula, to refor- mulate it for the period in question as a “knowledge related to love” for- mula, and to specify it with regard to the practices of knowledge within the developing discipline of classical scholarship. That means, in effect, conceptualizing attitudes toward the past less as desire than as emotion directed toward an object—the classical past—imag- ined as a living organism and invested with the characteristics of a human fig- ure, and, as such, as the correlative to the figure of the scholar. Such images of emotion are features of discourse that have a feedback effect on perception, on cognition, on linguistic representation, and thereby on the organization of knowledge. Far from wanting to speculate about the real psychological emotions and effects felt by classical scholars, I am concerned with the lan- guage and imagery of affect that inhabits reflection on the classical world. In what follows, I want to sketch out some of the parameters within which this might be done, giving an overview of the logic of Bildung and an account of what is meant by a code of love, and using as main examples transitional writers in a transitional time, writers that stand close to or on the line toward a professionalized world of classical scholarship, and of philology in particular as it emerges by about 1800, yet writers who think programmatically about philology’s role and function, such as Wilhelm von Humboldt, Friedrich August Wolf, and Friedrich Schlegel.  126 REPRESENTAT IONS </page> <page sequence="6"> REP109_05  12/18/09  11:30 AM  Page 127 Life Writing What is the framework, then, for claiming and valuing a relation- ship of desire, affection, or intimacy with a personified past? How and why is antiquity personified, and what changes in the late eighteenth century? Two sets of implications for personifying the body of ancient Greek culture and history in particular, and of personification more generally, seem to be relevant. First, to study antiquity is realized not only as an act of imagining or viewing antiquity as a beautiful, stationary, or statuesque body but also as an act of tracing the progress of that living figure. Second, the relationship with that object is one formulated in a contemporary discourse or code of love. In this way, both the element of the past, of history or historicizing, and the aspect of an aesthetic, emotional, or otherwise lived present experi- ence combine. The works of Johann Gottfried Herder, a contemporary and enthusiastic reader of Winckelmann, provide a good starting point for considering the functionality of such “life writing.”21 Herder’s portrayal of the philosopher, mathematician, and writer Thomas Abbt (1768), for example, formulates its value both in itself and as an analogy for scholarly work. Abbt (1738–1766) was Herder’s predecessor at the Bückeburg ducal court, and his death before the age of thirty brings Herder’s written memorial even closer to the youthful statuesque beauty at the core of Winckelmann’s reflections. Herder’s memo- rial profile of Abbt is a commentary on the relation between scholarly and human thinking, a commentary on a recently deceased man that makes Herder’s voice echo the persona of the numismatist and antiquarian: Abbt has portrayed himself, but only as an author; so I am considering only one side of his mind, the scholarly thinking, without undertaking to sketch his human think- ing. I know that both sides explain each other, as in the case of coins obverse image and reverse image (260; 170).22 Oscillating between the visual and the written, between the numismatic likeness, and the narrated life, Herder asks in the same essay:  What all is not required for a biographer, who wants to present a true image of his author, neither beautified, nor distorted, nor unresembling, in its true place in the order of minds? As Rousseau knew the son of his imagination, the wonderful Emile, both before his birth and in the marriage bed, the biographer, too, would have to have accompanied his friend through all the scenes of his life and to have become the intimate of his secrets; and yet he would have to be able [constantly] to observe him foreignly like a leisurely observer in order to follow every moment with attention. He would have to judge without bias like a judge of the dead; and yet—does it not also require a small amount of love-struck enthusiasm [verliebte Schwärmerei] to imprint one’s subject sufficiently into one’s imagination so as to sketch his image afterwards, as though out of one’s head? (260; 169–70) The Potter’s Daughter’s Sons 127 </page> <page sequence="7"> REP109_05  12/18/09  11:30 AM  Page 128 It is distance that reveals beauty and truth at the intersection of the histo- rian’s and the artist’s work, and it is ostensibly only by way of an affective engagement that both can be realized together. The creation of biography is linked, with a nod to Rousseau, to the creation of a fictional character, albeit one who is the main figure in a novel of education, and whose progress is the concern of his author as much as the act of biography reflects back on Herder. The distance implied in the imaginative act is mir- rored in the practice of portraying: the imprinting of the imagination is fol- lowed by the (biographical) sketch—the sketch of a man Herder had never actually met in person. The notion of mental or imagined contact with the human figure and of imprinting is one that Herder develops throughout his writings, especially in his discussions of the role of touch, and of sculp- ture compared to painting: an argument that upgrades this nonvisual form of knowledge, yet puts all the epistemological weight on the imagination and reflexivity of the touching subject, making the actual act of touching one of necessary distance.23 If the intimacy afforded by fiction is unavailable, there is, Herder sug- gests, at least a dream scenario of the biographer’s satisfaction, in which a figure, oscillating between Winckelmannian statuesque beauty and the warmth of life, imparts knowledge: First of all I should show the proper manner of my author, and remark on the orig- inal contours of his mind: a difficult business, even if a useful one. These moments are few and difficult to catch, when the soul lays itself bare [da sich die Seele entklei- det], to present itself to us like a beautiful woman in enchanting nakedness; so that we sidle up to someone else’s way of thinking [dass wir uns an die Denkart des andern anschmiegen], and learn wisdom as if through a kiss. (262) As Herder concedes, these are rare moments; and again, a corollary of the biographer’s task is the observer’s distance and foreignness. In all of this, ancient precedent is never far from Herder’s outline; a little further on, he evokes another model of capturing a life through such a measure of “love- struck enthusiasm”: I have thus indicated some main lines of Abbt’s character—perhaps lines like those drawn by that Corinthian girl around the shadow of her sleeping lover, lines in which she thought she saw his image because her imagination [Einbildungskraft] filled up the outline, even though an alien observer saw nothing. (290; 173) Here is Dibutades again. Just as she, faced with the departure of her lover, traces his shadowy outline on a wall, so Herder traces that of Abbt, and Winckelmann that of ancient art. And yet Herder adds the figure of an alien observer who saw nothing, hinting at the exclusivity of vision that marks the scholar’s eye. Even so, his vision will remain incomplete too, though possibly deliberately incomplete. Just as the outline may have only a limited meaning, 128 REPRESENTAT IONS </page> <page sequence="8"> REP109_05  12/18/09  11:30 AM  Page 129 especially to the uninvolved eye, the act of biography results in a monument manqué: “[Abbt’s] writings are a small fragment,” Herder readily admits, “a small but that much more valuable relic of his mind. And if now I want to erect for Abbt a memorial statue out of his writings, how could I call it any- thing but a mutilated torso?” (262). “Torso of a Memorial,” erected out of a corpus of writing, is in fact the full subtitle of Herder’s own written attempt to bring Abbt back to life. And yet, by 1768, the observation, through senses and mind, of the mutilated torso as indicating beauty and imparting knowledge is the precise sign of being a modern human being—and a modern human being with a critical sensibility for the works of antiquity.  The Logic of Bildung and  the Language of Romantic Love Herder’s textual and cultural knowledge of antiquity is not coin- cidental to his argument, neither here nor in his other more explicitly his- toriographical writings; while he is no classical scholar in the professional sense, it is the conception of modernity by way of Bildung that connects his work to the realm of classical knowledge as a discipline, and it is a discourse of sentimentality and personal affect that links his language of enthusiasm with knowledge of the past. If we ask about the state of classical scholarship around the year 1800, it is clear that the constitutive impact of antiquity upon definitions of moder- nity is key. This is not news, especially when thinking back to the Querelle des Anciens et des Modernes, and the new plurality of approaches to ancient artistic models, which had exercised the European academy since the turn of the previous century. What is new, though, is a shift from exempla to experi- ence, and from artistic models to understanding and re-creation, a shift that comes with a heightened awareness of irreversibility and a strong emphasis on individual development or Bildung. This emphasis is well known, but it bears underlining that the complement to individuality is interpersonality, also inscribed into Bildung; it is here that a language of love and emotional attachment becomes particularly effective. Bildung structured the terms of interpretation operative in classical scholarship, both to explain its subject matter and to justify itself. In the logic of a new educational model, inflected by developing historicism, chart- ing the history of mankind meant charting Bildung as it manifests itself in individual epochs, under the relevant geographical and even climatic influ- ences and with regard to individual nations and societies. The organic con- ception of the past and the metaphor of the life cycle may not be new, nor are they necessarily restricted to Greece as opposed to other cultures of the past.24 Classical Greece, however, was thought to have a history that seemed The Potter’s Daughter’s Sons 129 </page> <page sequence="9"> REP109_05  12/18/09  11:30 AM  Page 130 to exemplify the momentous balance of human reason and beautiful self- realization. If human reason perceives historicity and makes sense of history, then history, in turn, conforms and bears witness to the development of human reason.25 Bildung, therefore, sets the individual, or particular, and the universal as analogues. One of the great “visualizers” of this new histori- cism, other than Winckelmann regarding the history of art, was Herder, again, and both rely heavily on the model of the human body and the human life cycle to make their point.26 For Herder, Greece is the cultural stage that corresponds to the age of maturing youth, the period of “youth and bridal bloom,” of “the dream of the young man and the fancy tales of the maiden.”27 Yet both are adamant that Greece is also one of the prime examples of a culture or nation containing the entire circle of Bildung, growth, maturity, and decline, in its history, enabling the reader to compre- hend and thus advance the progress of history.28 Bildung, therefore, as a program of self-transformation or self-direction, could be smoothly aligned with the study and understanding of antiquity, becoming its content as much as its end result. A quotation from Friedrich Ast’s university textbook Outline of Philology (1808) shows how philology, Bil- dung, and operative images of life, liveliness, and individual personality coa- lesce in a standard example of classical philology’s self-presentation. Philology is the study of the spirit (Geist) suffusing the inner and outer life of the classical world and its textual sources, and true philology harmonizes the study of material, or essence, and form: “In this unity Being and Form are sublimated into a true Essence; the latter comes alive [wird Leben], and the former takes (human) shape [Gestalt], both together become an intricately formed and cul- tivated life, as an expression of spirit.”29 Given the balance of those elements in the ancient world, Ast concludes that, as opposed to a dead learnedness and mechanical knowledge, philology’s true objective is “to reach a true and life- like intuition [Anschauung] and understanding [Erkenntnis] of classical antiq- uity, which is, as the ancient world, the paradigm of genuine Bildung” (6). What is more, he argues, “in Germany it was the three heroes of our artistic and scientific Bildung, Winckelmann, Lessing and Herder, who recognized and reconceived once more of antiquity as it really was; by their own example they showed how a mind nourished by classical antiquity partakes of true Bil- dung, when the spirit of antiquity, as beautiful and living form, and as pure and genuine sense, weds itself to modern Bildung [dass sich der antike Geist als schöne, lebendige Form, als reiner gediegener Sinn mit der modernen Bildung vermählet]” (5). This passage not only attaches the personalities of specific scholars to the affective imperative to study and intuit antiquity as a living being; it also indi- cates that the work of such noninstitutional figures as Winckelmann and Herder continued to be a reference point for the developing discipline, inscribed as they were in its own quasi-biography.  130 REPRESENTAT IONS </page> <page sequence="10"> REP109_05  12/18/09  11:30 AM  Page 131 If Bildung is about the development of the individual, antiquity in turn becomes personified. To find and define the character of antiquity, there- fore, is to describe and recount its life story, and to understand and compre- hend its Wesen (essence, character, or being), and it is this notion that Humboldt, for example, has in mind when, in his essay On the Study of Antiq- uity, and of Greek Antiquity in Particular (1793), he speaks of the imperative to write the biography of the Greek nation, almost two decades before he is commissioned with the program work for the newly founded University of Berlin in 1810: The study of a nation offers all the advantages which history has in general, namely to increase our knowledge of human beings by examples of actions and events, to sharpen our power of judgment, and to improve and raise our character. Yet it does more. In trying not only to unravel the thread of successive events, but rather to explore the condition and the state of the nation altogether, this kind of study gives us a biography, as it were [italics in original].30 With a new model of understanding that complicates the exemplary, with a new model of historical thought and anthropology, with a philosophi- cal hermeneutics and a new epistemology at the end of the eighteenth cen- tury, come strategies of personification as part of historical understanding and a matching discourse of personal affection and attraction. A discourse of sentimentality, feeling, and love had since midcentury begun to sweep through rhetoric, aesthetics, physiology, education, and literature as a recog- nizable model for orientation and communication and as a parameter for “disciplining” the self-perception of the subject and its relation with soci- ety.31 In this context love functioned as a prominent topos of culture alto- gether.32 Love is the field of debate where nature and culture cross, and it is the writing off which Bildung, as another such cross between nature and cul- ture, can be read. Goethe’s Wilhelm Meister, namesake of the novel that, according to Friedrich Schlegel, was one of the three milestones of the Romantic age, claims to know one thing for sure on his path to education: “I am gebildet enough to love and to grieve.”33 The mention of grief in the con- text of both love and Bildung triangulates the elements of understanding related to affect with the aspect of loss and the past; it expresses, in one short sentence, the encroachment of conscious distance and the passionate navi- gation of impossible closeness onto the concept of individual formation. The topos of love has the potential to indicate the tensions between individ- ual and society. Moreover, if we think of the discourse of love as a discourse of interpretation that deals with the relative, and charged, legibility of natu- ral and cultural signs, then the points of contact with the program of scholar- ship are all the more visible, not least because philology, which is tantamount to classical philology and had so far led an auxiliary existence to theology, The Potter’s Daughter’s Sons 131 </page> <page sequence="11"> REP109_05  12/18/09  11:30 AM  Page 132 jurisprudence, and philosophy, moves at this point into place as the proper domain of hermeneutics, or the theory of interpretation.34 Friedrich Schleiermacher, for example, theoretician of hermeneutics, theologian, philosopher, and future comprehensive translator of Plato’s dia- logues into German, develops an ethics of individuality that posits love as a central motor to guarantee contact with what is other than the self, provok- ing and furthering self-awareness and self-knowledge in turn. In his Monolo- gen (1800), a strangely confessional systematic account of individualization as the highest good, which he affectionately addresses to an unnamed “You,” he makes Bildung and love actually conditional upon each other: “No Bil- dung without love, and without one’s own proper Bildung no perfection in love; one complementing the other both grow inseparably together [Keine Bildung ohne Liebe, und ohne eigne Bildung keine Vollendung in der Liebe; eins das Andere ergänzend, wächst beides unzertrennlich fort]. I find united in myself the two great conditions for morality! I have made both sense [Sinn] and love my own, and both continue to develop, a testimony that life is fresh and healthy and that my proper Bildung is to grow stronger yet.”35 Schleiermacher may not have been a classicist in the institutional sense, but his impact on the programmatic outlook of institutionalized philology has been great. The most far-reaching continuation of his language is proba- bly found in the programmatic writings of his pupil August Boeckh, who, as a professor of classical philology at the University of Berlin for more than fifty years (1811–1867), left a lasting mark on the discipline at one of its flag- ship institutions. For Boeckh, the philologist’s task lies not only in scientific analysis, but also in a scientific emotionality, if that is the right word, a prin- cipled intimacy that has the power to unite the fragments of the past and the fragmented knowledge of the past created in the present. Philology is real- ized only in the sum of its heads and practitioners, Boeckh claims, “in a thousand heads, partial, dismembered, broken, not to mention strange and in a broken tongue [verschroben und geradebrecht]; but the great love alone, with which so many have embraced [philology], guarantees the reality of the idea, which is nothing other than the reconstruction of the constructions of the human mind in their totality.”36 Here, too, is an intimation of the lover of knowledge seeking to grasp the elusive human shape in front of him, though consummation is never achieved: “Philology, like every other sci- ence, is an infinite task of approximation. In philology, we will always be one- sided collectors and never bring to fruition a total union with speculation; for speculation, too, is always one-sided. And yet, incompleteness is no mis- take; the only true deficiency is not to acknowledge it” (16). The vocabulary of love appears explicitly in Boeckh’s gloss of the terms philologos and philologia as “the desire for and pleasure taken in scientific exchange” (Lust zu und an wissenschaftlicher Mittheilung; 22)—a meaning he 132 REPRESENTAT IONS </page> <page sequence="12"> REP109_05  12/18/09  11:30 AM  Page 133 takes, with exact reference, from Plato’s Phaedrus 336e. What is more, like Schleiermacher, he makes feeling a constituent part of the philologist’s intel- lectual setup. Like Cicero’s orator, according to Boeckh, the philologist needs a wide range of qualities, among them “a pure heart and mind, open to everything that is good and beautiful, equally receptive to the most tran- scendental and to the smallest thing below, feeling and imagination [Gefühl und Phantasie] combined with a sharp rational mind, a harmonious integra- tion of feeling and thought, of life and knowledge, which, aside from unstinting industry, are the fundamentals of philology, as they are for any other science” (26).  For his theory of interpretation, the actual subject that awaits interpreta- tion makes no difference to the validity of the method. The subject’s subjec- tivity, though, and its individuality and difference, need to be taken into account as part of the method—which firmly establishes that interpretation, in any branch of philology, is always an attempt to understand another indi- viduality, another human subject. This approach is one of approximation: “If, therefore, the foreign individuality can never be fully understood, then the objective of hermeneutics can only ever be met in an infinite approxima- tion, that is to say through a gradual approach, advancing point by point, but never completed” (86). The lack inherent in this incomplete approach (Annäherung) is compensated by and articulated through the involvement of feeling, which, in a remarkable and almost accidental move, Boeckh sug- gests, can still sometimes achieve the total intimacy that is also the elusive catalyst of the code of romantic love. “In certain cases, feeling can reach a complete form of understanding, and the hermeneutic artist will be all the more perfectly accomplished the more he is in possession of such a feeling that can cut through a knot but cannot otherwise offer justification. It is this feeling, by means of which we can suddenly and in one fell swoop recognize what someone else had once already understood, and without it there would indeed be no ability to communicate at all. Even though individuals are dif- ferent from each other, they also harmonize in respect to many things; in that way, one can understand another individuality up to a point by way of calculation, but one can grasp completely certain of its expressions in a vivid intuition, which rests in feeling” (86). It is a lebendige Anschauung, a vivid intu- ition that is communicable only in the form of emotionality and that lacks any justification beyond itself.  It is at this point, then, that both the attitude of intimacy and the ten- dency for personification come together in one of the key programmatic texts of early nineteenth-century classical scholarship. The study of Greece as part of Bildung is the encyclopedic study of a complete world of objects and ideals, considered beautiful and desirable, that is valued for its aesthetic and transforming potential. The individuality of the person experiencing The Potter’s Daughter’s Sons 133 </page> <page sequence="13"> REP109_05  12/18/09  11:30 AM  Page 134 and studying classical antiquity corresponds to the individuality of the Greeks, which becomes both the object and a constituent, methodological part of Altertumswissenschaft. The assumption that any reading of antiquity is the approximate understanding of another Individualität is integrated into the basis of classical scholarship. The link between the personality of the scholar and his subject becomes permanent. Proximity has necessarily an operative emotional component. The link between scholar and subject is further enforced through a rhetoric of exclusivity, of self and other in mutual focus, that equals the exclusivity of the discourse of romantic love. With Niklas Luhmann, I understand a language of love and intimacy as a historically changeable code that enables and maintains communication, and hence action, in a socially differentiated and changing world.37 An increase in social complexity necessitates new media of interchange, one of which is love, not as the emotion itself, but as a code of communication.38 Historically, Luhmann postulates a line from the idealization of medieval love through the code of paradox in the seventeenth and into the eigh- teenth century, on to a heightened reflection of autonomy and self-referen- tiality around the year 1800, in the paradigm of romantic love. A romantic subjectivity assumes that each individual perceives the world separately, that individual characteristics are subject to change and development, and that engagement with an other, a loved one, and his or her world, height- ens the awareness of one’s own singularity.39 The philosophical anthropol- ogy of the late eighteenth century, with its stress on the world-creating qualities of the subject, raises the particularity and singularity of the indi- vidual to the level of a universal principle: two souls equal two worlds, mutu- ally bound and exclusively related. This code of romantic love (also reflecting social changes that had been making the choice of partner more free) thus increases individuality, reflection, and preservation of the self, and renders love an ostensibly self-justifying code, not unlike the circular logic of Bildung (Luhmann here in fact quotes Humboldt).40 Importantly, this devel- opment toward increasing exclusivity is inseparable from an awareness of incommunicability, or at least the potential failure of communication, aris- ing from one’s own singularity and that of the other. This “cognitive strain,” which the inclusion of the other’s universe into one’s own exerts, is prac- ticed, addressed, and to an extent ameliorated in utilizing a code of love.  The point of including the analytical vocabulary of Luhmann is not to drown textual observations in the terminology of systems theory, putting the discourse of an emerging discipline into a wider social context; rather, it is to make use of the insight that a language of love, as a discursive preference, addresses communication and self-positioning in the face of a cognitive chal- lenge that is also that of historical difference as it is encountered and expressed in classical scholarship. It is an available code, at the same time, that structurally 134 REPRESENTAT IONS </page> <page sequence="14"> REP109_05  12/18/09  11:30 AM  Page 135 runs on and integrates the possibility of incomprehensibility and absence. The romantic code of love relies on a structure of approach and distancing. If pos- session of the other may not be fully possible (nor fully desirable) within this structure, it is the motor that keeps it going, just as Winckelmann had claimed that our attention to lost ancient artifacts, including the imagination’s work, is much greater than if we were in full possession of them.  A language of love and intimacy is then able to express the aim and the practice of studying antiquity, especially that of Greece. The romantic focus on the individual encouraged strategies of personifying Greece that in turn shaped the self-understanding of the discipline and its practitioners. To the extent that romanticism structures its idea of love around autonomy and the singularity of the individual, there is a parallel claim for the autonomy of scholarship. The romantic love paradigm entails trying to grasp as fully as possible the world of the other while reaffirming one’s own identity and individuality. The study of classical Greece, and its attraction, was formulated within the parameters of personal Bildung. Ancient Greece was a culture val- ued and desired for its aesthetic features and its essential beauty. The struc- ture of romantic love rests on the impossibility of completion. Classical scholarship that operated with a terminology of personal affect fastened its mission onto a growing historicism; and this historicism acknowledged the radical difference of the past while wanting to investigate and make present every aspect of its “biography.”  If the function of code is to facilitate communication and accommodate change, then its success in a complex society can be measured in the number of connecting points to other codes. While Luhmann suspects that the roman- tic code of love in particular may offer fewer such connectors to discourses such as economics or political power than did earlier codes of love, he does point out the affinity of the code of love to that of education. The area of sci- ence (Wissenschaft) with which classical scholarship aligns itself by name, can itself be interpreted as a social system with a proper code; its relationship to education, by way of the notion of Bildung, makes transparent the intersection of codes that is possible in the field of scholarship as it begins to define itself.41 Altertumswissenschaft in Practice The romantic code of love involves the nonutilitarian (and in that sense disinterested) reflection of autonomy and the desire for knowing the other as fully, as comprehensively, and as exclusively as possible. These themes of projected completeness and a special kind of interestedness, or disinterestedness, are also seen in the self-description of scholarship.42 In Wolf ’s Darstellung der Altertumswissenschaft (1807), another of the “founding treatises” of professionalized classical scholarship, the same logic is employed. The Potter’s Daughter’s Sons 135 </page> <page sequence="15"> REP109_05  12/18/09  11:30 AM  Page 136 While Wolf justifies the study of any foreign peoples or cultures on the basis of our natural interest and sympathy (Theilnahme) in fellow human beings, it is, first of all, the richness of material that singles out Greek civilization.43 The overall aim is to make antiquity in its important relations and charac- teristics once more a belebtes Ganzes, a unity come alive (847). Our interest, meanwhile, is not a utilitarian interest. Like purposiveness without a pur- pose (to use the term that served to define beauty and aesthetic judgment in Kant’s Third Critique), and like love justifying love, the study of ancient languages reveals its dignity and fruitfulness only when it is “an end in itself” (863). In the same way, the ancients themselves sought knowledge and thereby rose to the proper height of their civilization, he adds, for study’s sake, and not as means to an end (821). The beneficial and educa- tional effect of such study, in turn, is formulated within the familiar param- eter of intimacy: “To read and to reflect on the works [of the ancients] will steadily rejuvenate our mind and spirit, not as if they were staged historical characters, but as in the intimacy with those we respect and have grown fond of [wie die Vertraulichkeit mit geschätzten und liebgewonnenen Personen]. Communicating their attitudes and feelings, they will correct the injuries of education in our deficient time” (878). Wolf’s 1782 edition of and commentary on Plato’s Symposium is, in this con- text, a good case study for the way the rhetoric of romantic love, in tandem with a focus on the personality of the scholar, permeates his actual scholarship, too. Wolf’s lasting fame as a classical scholar rested not only on the content of his scholarship but also on the fact that he cultivated his own persona as a visionary scholar.44 Wolf’s Symposium shows clearly the extent to which the edition pre- sents its modern author as much as its text. His name on the cover is exactly the same size as Plato’s, and the preceding tag, “in places corrected [verbessert] and edited, with critical and interpreting annotations, by . . . ,” reveals an even stronger sense of personal influence in the original German, where verbessert has the additional meaning of “improved,” rather than simply “emended” or “corrected.” The quantity of introductory material, with a preface, an introduc- tory essay, and a detailed summary altogether amounting to almost a hundred pages, also puts Wolf in a prominent position.45 Accordingly, Plato’s dialogue is framed in Wolf’s edition as the perfect match for an understanding of classical education as both based on and imagined in terms of close interpersonal rela- tionships. Wolf suggests that the Symposium is a novel choice, given the relative neglect of newer editions of Plato, and he calls for new surveys and summaries of Plato’s works in general.46 In this context he mentions that his own contribu- tion is “no longer a bare skeleton, but already closer to a body made up of flesh and bones” (schon mehr ein mit Fleisch überzogener Körper, als ein blosses dürres Skelett; xxiv)—not only a deliberately striking image that bestows a certain corporeality on the act of research but also entirely Wolf’s own when we compare it with the 136 REPRESENTAT IONS </page> <page sequence="16"> REP109_05  12/18/09  11:30 AM  Page 137 model he sets himself against, the English publication by Ebenezer MacFait, Remarks on the Life and Writings of Plato. With Answers to the Principle Objections Against Him; and a General View of His Dialogues (1760), which, so Wolf tells us, proposes to draw a map of the Platonic dialogues. Plato in general, and the Symposium in particular, which can “do great ser- vice to both heart and mind” (vii), are singled out for their usefulness for edu- cation: “It was partly because of its flourishing style and its other internal advantages that I considered it most suitable for waking and maintaining in young people an urge to study Plato [den Trieb zum Studium des Platon zu wecken]. I looked at it with an eye to the young boy, and I followed my design with a view to his needs and desires” (vi). Both the content and the hoped-for effect of the Symposium are about educating young individuals and instilling love and friendship in them as they enter into social life and its demands (a thought mirroring Pausanias’s speech at Symp. 184c–e, which argues for the social and educational benefits of the correctly practiced pederastic relation- ship).47 With that educational benefit in mind, too, Wolf has chosen to present his edition in German, to make it more easily communicable (leichter ver- ständlich). At the same time, the self-justification of love is one response to the challenge of incommunicability as a constitutive feature of romantic love. Wolf summarizes Aristophanes’ speech in the Symposium to the effect that “the change in our nature described here is the basis for our eternal longing [ewiges Sehnen] to be reunited in one whole, the very longing which we call love” (76); the Aristophanic lovers famously cannot say what it is they want (192d), and just as the Socratic eros moves beyond that account, Wolf ’s schol- arly eros both promotes communication and flirts with speechlessness, as we can see from his comments on the “ineffable” (unaussprechliches), and “incom- municable” (nicht mitteilbares), which is not bodily lust (körperliche Begierde), but part of the delight of souls (Entzücken der Seelen) in (Platonic) eros. As for his own motives for editing Plato, “these are merely the assump- tions of a man who has been prompted by love for this, his, author, wanting to penetrate all his beauties [in alle Schönheiten desselben einzudringen], and even those which time has covered already with her veil” (54). Like Herder hoping for wisdom from an entkleidete Seele, a soul undressed, Wolf as a classi- cal scholar aims to uncover the veil of time from the figure he desires, an act that makes the scholar socially understandable, relevant, and “functional.” In that light, it seems also not accidental that for Wolf the Platonic symposi- asts are themselves scholars, whose episteme is glossed and translated through- out as Wissenschaft: “It is decided to let everyone drink according to their pleasure and to spend the time rather with discussions of a scientific [wis- senschaftlicher] nature” (67). Another transitional figure and classical scholar to turn his attention to the Symposium not long after is Friedrich Schlegel, for whom Diotima’s The Potter’s Daughter’s Sons 137 </page> <page sequence="17"> REP109_05  12/18/09  11:30 AM  Page 138 dialogue with Socrates is “one of antiquity’s most exquisite remains,” and who declares that the only appropriate response to the work, on part of the reader, is love.48 Schlegel’s views may not be mainstream (if there was a mainstream at this point), nor is he easily categorized as a professional classi- cist.49 Still, he was a writer of programmatic essays on classical scholarship, and his oscillating between the discourses of scholarship, literature, and phi- losophy underscores the transferability of the language and structure of love. In the famous On the Study of Greek Poetry (1795–1797), his stated aim is to reconcile the positions of the Querelle, in an attempt to prove that the study of Greek poetry is more than a forgivable fancy [Liebhaberei]: but that it is, and always will be the necessary duty of all lovers who want to embrace the beautiful with true love, of all experts who want to arrive at universal judgments, and of all thinkers who seek to define once and for all the pure laws of beauty and the eternal nature of art.50 The concern close to Schlegel’s heart is essentially a renewal of modern poetry, and he, too, is both historian and contemporary writer, reflecting productively on the self while engaging with the other: Modern poetry is not satisfied; instead, it thrives on keeping open the rifts left by Sehnsucht and Streben, longing and striving; it cannot achieve completion, and it lacks the repose that is brought by completion, a “complete beauty, which would be whole and persistent; a Juno, which would not turn into a cloud at the very moment of ecstatic embrace” (217; Schlegel’s italics). That, of course, implies, that any Juno would do exactly this: turn into a cloud. Again, an anthropomorphic, divine figure of antiquity stands in for, that is to say rep- resents, the characteristic, yet unavailable essence, the complete beauty, of ancient culture. This is the tension at the core of Schlegel’s outline: moder- nity is characterized by interestedness.  The position of modernity is inevitable, and it should come, so wrote Schlegel, with a desire for the beautiful; in contrast to our modern, inter- ested ways, antiquity stands for a disinterested beauty that makes it ostensi- bly less self-conscious and hence more “natural.” Scholarship is suspended between interestedness and attraction on the one hand, in terms of its atti- tude, and disinterestedness on the other, as its object of study and its goal. The desire of the scholar is not an instrumental desire, and in that sense it still very much sounds like, and is compatible with, the nonutilitarian love that the Romantic period envisages. The line of development that describes the encounter of separate individuals in romantic love, however, can also be run alongside the appropriation of historical difference that challenges and defines modernity. The literature of the moderns, according to Schlegel, in order to become truly modern, needs contact with, and a grad- ual understanding of, the ancients—just as true love needs to rest on a 138 REPRESENTAT IONS </page> <page sequence="18"> REP109_05  12/18/09  11:30 AM  Page 139 progressive line of relationships. This at least should be the course run by the individual, who is a writing individual, as Schlegel suggested in his ex- perimental, at the time scandalous, and allegedly autobiographical novel Lucinde (1799), a work that almost cost him his qualification as a scholar into the bargain.51 Love also provides a frame to cast the “modernization” of antiquity in fig- urative language with an explanatory and legitimizing force, such as when, with reference to the genre of elegy, Schlegel radically announces: “[Elegy] is no longer merely a beautiful antique; she is indigenous [einheimisch] and she now lives among us.”52 From Herder’s snatched kisses that impart wis- dom, we have moved to another educational program of self-reflective rela- tionships. And just as desired unity between two people is supposedly creative, Schlegel’s extreme, future-oriented philology seeks to overcome the divide between ancient and modern, that is, a vertical, diachronic divide, by com- plete understanding of both, enacted by cooperation or the famous symphi- losophy, that is, an overcoming of the horizontal or synchronic divide, the key term used by the Jena Romantics for their interpersonal projects, in which poetry, philosophy, and philology and their practitioners become, quite literally, indistinguishable:53 We could see the start of a new epoch of Wissenschaften and arts, if symphilosophy and sympoetry became so universal and so intimate [innig] that it would not be a rare occurrence for several complementing natures to come together and create works. One cannot help thinking that two minds truly belonged together, like sepa- rated halves, and were and achieved everything only when linked to each other.54 Here we are right back with the (Aristophanic) language of Plato’s Sympo- sium;55 but more than that, Schlegel’s revised Altertumswissenschaft, in fact, seeks to square the circle of the Querelle by giving the relationship with antiq- uity new valence: The systematic Winckelmann, who read all ancients as One Author, saw everything as a whole and focused all his energy on the Greeks, recognized the fundamental differ- ence between antiquity and modernity and so laid the foundations for a material study of antiquity. Only when the point of reference has become clear from which we can establish the absolute identity of ancient and modern, which was, is or will be, only then will we be able to say that we have found the contour of this science [der Kontur der Wissenschaft] and that we can now turn to its methodical execution.56 The science of antiquity has itself, like one of Winckelmann’s statues, a contour that is culture-defining as much as it creates methodical standards of science, and that is traced, like that of Dibutades’ departing lover, in an act of making culture—and making scholarship. The poet, he continues, “if he wants to be an expert and understand his fellow citizens in the realm of art, has to be a philolo- gist as well.”57 Unlike Winckelmann, Schlegel’s ideal poet-scholar-citizen wants The Potter’s Daughter’s Sons 139 </page> <page sequence="19"> REP109_05  12/18/09  11:30 AM  Page 140 to draw the contour not of something that is remote and past, but that ought to be fully integrated, and that integrates himself. At the same time, Schlegel’s risky, utopian, and modern philology, which somehow knows that the Archimedean point from which identity with the other and with the past is possible, leads, in its exaggeration and reference to Winckelmann, back to the same double gesture that is involved in giving a (human) figure to antiquity: the affinity with an other that furthers the self and is motivated by love on the one hand and the necessary condition of per- sonification, as giving voice to something that cannot speak itself, on the other. Just as the structure of prosopopeia, of personification as the “giving of face or voice,” is a rhetorical strategy that relies on the absence or impossibil- ity of voice, of that which is made to speak, so the past needs to be thoroughly absent so as to be made present.58 It is that very cognitive strain that is addressed in a code of love, a code that values engagement with what is not self, postulates and communicates the epistemological and pedagogic payoff of that engage- ment, and is also prepared to show awareness of its limits. Conclusion The language of interpersonal love and the program of classical scholarship, both centered around the singular and yet structured develop- ment of the individual, reinforce, justify, and explicate each other. The con- ception of emotion as imagery also implies a conception of images as enabling factors in a changing social and historical reality, not simply as indicators of such a change.59 The historical semantics of love suggested here supplement the dynamics of desire, since much programmatic writing around the year 1800 on how to approach antiquity, despite its considerable spectrum, oper- ates openly with a language of emotional attachment that authorizes the undertaking of scholarship and makes it comprehensible. If classical scholar- ship sets itself up to become the representative pedagogical discipline of the period, then it needs to be able to do the work of “disciplining” the individual, and it does so in a discourse of love that was prevalent at the time. A close look at the period that has been considered foundational for the discourse of classi- cal scholarship and for its institutional influence beyond the German-speaking world in the nineteenth century helps us to situate, rather than take for granted, antiquity’s persistent streak of (unselfconscious) personification, which has extended into the research agendas of institutionalized classical scholarship and its self-perception and continues to shape its raison d’être. If bringing lived experience to life and narrating that life is one way to join together the strands of historicizing and lived experience, then a language of love and closeness is its potent medium of expression. Given the generative potential of love as a cultural term (for framing Bildung, the individual, and its 140 REPRESENTAT IONS </page> <page sequence="20"> REP109_05  12/18/09  11:30 AM  Page 141 place in society), it is a language that not only expresses but also shapes the expectation of what the relationship with an other, or, in the case of scholar- ship, the object of that study, can be and achieve. A contemporary code of love allows expression of the challenges and paradoxes of historical difference par- ticularly well; romantic love makes the fact of the other’s separateness part of its self-understanding, which in turn makes the alternation of proximity and dis- tance (both personal and historical), and the lack of availability that is implied in encounters with the past, meaningful and communicable up to a point.  The question remains to what extent the relationship between two human beings conforms to the (scholarly) relationship with something that is irrevo- cably past—even if the object of the past imagined as a living being is exactly what helps negotiate the value of engaging with the past, which is presented as the promise of a unique, coherent even if complex, and therefore “legi- ble,” whole. The image of the woman looking out after her departing lover suggests an actually experienced earlier presence and immediate knowledge of that lover, and in this way the image glosses over the radically different tra- jectory of past and present that concerns the historian of antiquity, whose object has never been present to the scholar. Formulating the relationship with an object of study through a code of love cognitively eases the question of the absent other and the question of reciprocity for the modern sons of the Corinthian potter’s daughter, who determinedly draw the outline of an ancient figure to arrive at a clearer contour for themselves. As for Winckelmann the scholar, Whitney Davis suggests, in a sensitive analysis of Winckelmann’s essay “On the Ability to Perceive the Beautiful in Art” (1763), that the question of reciprocity was also part of his lived experi- ence. The essay is outspokenly and affectionately dedicated to a young nobleman, and it is, Davis points out, largely and essentially autobiographi- cal in tone.60 The young count von Berg indeed did not reciprocate Winck- elmann’s affection. Seen from the point of view of a discourse of love as a generative feature of the discipline of classical scholarship, autobiography may turn out to be not merely anecdotal, but in fact structurally the most appropriate response in a discipline that has always been strong on cultivat- ing the historiography of itself.

On Winckelmann’s impact on both classical scholarship and cultural criticism, and his lasting popularity, see Esther Sünderhauf, Griechensehnsucht und Kulturkri- tik.

Hans-Ulrich Gumbrecht, The Powers of Philol- ogy: Dynamics of Textual Scholarship (Stanford, 2003) makes an eloquent case for the overlap between the powers of philology and the structures of desire that inhere in its practices, be it commenting, editing, or teaching. 20.

Gumbrecht, Powers of Philology, is particularly strong on the praise of an invigorated practice of philology that relishes its momentum of desire. 21. See, e.g., Johann Gottfried Herder’s often reprinted memorial essay “Denkmal Johann Winckelmanns” (1777). 22. Johann Gottfried Herder, “Über Thomas Abbts Schriften” (1768), in Sämmtliche Werke [hereafter SWS], ed. Bernhard Suphan, 33 vols. (Berlin, 1877–1913), 2:249–94; here 260; the English translation is, with some modifications, that of Michael N. Forster’s translation of part of the essay in his Johann Gottfried von Herder: Philosophical Writings (Cambridge, 2002), 167–77; here 170. Subsequent references to this work appear parenthetically in the text. In most instances the page reference for both the German original and the translation are given, the page number for the German original first, followed by the page number for the Forster translation. Where only one reference appears, it refers to the Ger- man edition only.  23. On Herder’s logic of touch, especially in relation to Winckelmann, whom he read and commented on avidly, see Inka Mülder-Bach, “Eine ‘neue Logik für den Liebhaber.’ Herders Theorie der Plastik,” in Der ganze Mensch. Anthropologie und Literatur im 18. Jahrhundert. DFG-Symposium 1992, ed. H.-J. Schings (Stuttgart, 1994), 341–70; Inka Mülder-Bach, “Ferngefühle.

Tilman Borsche (Munich, 2006), 264–77; also her monograph Im Zeichen Pygmalions. Das Modell der Statue und die Entdeckung der “Darstellung” im 18. Jahrhundert (Munich, 1998). Mülder-Bach argues that Herder in fact offers a theorization of the Pygmalion metaphor, which Winckel- mann offers specifically in his description of the Apollo Belvedere and figura- tively throughout his writings. 24. The life-cycle metaphor has proven popular from Aristotle through the Hel- lenistic age to Pliny, the Renaissance, and Winckelmann, among others, and it has had a continuing impact on modern historiography; see, e.g., Arnaldo Momigliano, The Classical Foundations of Modern Historiography (Berkeley, 1990), chap. 4. A tradition of narratives of the self or of culture according to an organic or biographical model, moreover, may be a dominant, but not neces- sarily an undisputed or self-evident notion; see Galen Strawson, “Against Narrativ- ity,” Ratio 17, no. 4 (2004): 428–52, who offers a strong refutation of self-perception in terms of narrative biographical sequence, as ostensibly natural and uncon- troversial. 25.

Even if they appear descriptive they do not necessar- ily mirror the real conditions of loving, but they solve definable problems, namely to translate the functional needs of a social system into a form that can be passed on. The semantic code of love can therefore in each case give access to the rela- tion between media of communication and social structure and make that rela- tion understandable”; ibid., 24. 39. Luhmann uses as his primary material mainly literary texts from the German, English, and French traditions. 40.

Ingo Gildenhard and Martin Ruehl (London, 2003), 161–203. 42. The new sense of exclusivity (propelled and threatened by elusiveness) may, in the world of classical knowledge, reappear and tally with the strengthened claims to a German national affiliation (as an extension of the individual) with the Greek world. 43.

Grafton, G. Most, and J. Zetzel (Princeton, 1986); Frank Turner, “The Homeric Question,” in A New Companion to Homer, ed. B. Powell and I. Morris (Leiden, 1999), 123–45. 45. Quotations here are from the rare 1782 edition; Wolf ’s summary of content, however, is republished as “Übersicht des Inhalts von Platons Dialog Das Gastmahl,” in the slightly more accessible Kleine Schriften, 2:593–620. 46. Wolf mentions the recent Greek text edition of the Symposium by Johann F. Fi- scher (Leipzig, 1776), and the volume of four Platonic dialogues in translation (not including the Symposium) by Friedrich Gedike (Berlin, 1780). As with his work on Homer, Wolf is very insistent on and confident in the originality of his publications. 47. As for the implications of the Greek pederastic model of educational (and in the Greek context also sexual) eros, Wolf follows a double strategy in his sum- mary of the speech; he is firm that “love is decent and laudable only when it is based on the lasting beauty of spirit or mind [dauerhafte Schönheiten des Geistes], and when it has been provoked by the noble intention to perfect our souls mutually in any area of knowledge [in irgendeinem Teil der Wissenschaften] or virtue; whatever its outcome, the intention is the measure of that love’s worth, as it is guarded by the Amor of Venus Urania, and as it has the greatest influ- ence on the happiness of human society” (69). While defusing the physical aspects of spiritual love, as they are present in Pausanias’s account, Wolf also reintegrates the erotic implications in a more palatable form through an argu- ment from historical change, and he adds as a footnote: “It is truly remarkable how customs and costumes are able to invert things and matters! In most sec- tions of this speech, especially in the latter half, the reader can mentally replace the [male] lover with a [female] lover, and he will have no reason to find fault with Pausanias’ argument” (69, Wolf ’s italics). 48. “Über die Diotima,” in Kritische Friedrich-Schlegel-Ausgabe [hereafter KA], ed. Ernst Behler (Paderborn, 1979), 1:71–72. 49.

Liebhaber, incidentally, is a term that in contemporary dictionaries attaches itself above all else to interpersonal relationships, even before the attachment to an object or pursuit, in the sense of an “amateur”; thus, for example, in Adelung’s Grammatisch-Kritisches Wörterbuch der Hochdeutschen Mundart (1793–1801). See, likewise, the new usage of “Liebe” in late eighteenth-century dictionaries to denote interpersonal attachment and secular attachment to objects above and before the spiritualized understanding of divine love; so in Edeltraud Kapl- Blume, “Liebe im Lexikon. Zum Bedeutungswandel des Begriffes ‘Liebe’ in aus- gewählten Lexika des 18. und 19. Jahrhunderts. Ein Forschungsbericht,” in Zur Historischen Semantik des Deutschen Gefühlswortschatzes. Aspekte, Probleme und Beispiele seiner lexikographischen Erfassung, ed. Ludwig Jäger (Aachen, 1988), 215–46. 51. Lucinde was reviled for its experimental style, its obscenity, and the ostensibly autobiographical background of Schlegel’s relationship with the divorced, older, and highly educated Dorothea Veit. The relationship, as much as the novel, scandalized his social and intellectual environment, to the extent that his 146 REPRESENTAT IONS </page> <page sequence="26"> REP109_05  12/18/09  11:30 AM  Page 147 personal behavior was seen as an impediment to his academic propriety; in fact, Lucinde was threatening to endanger his academic standing at Jena in 1800, when the novel was quoted to him during the disputation so as to morally dis- credit its author; E. and W. Michel, “Der ‘zusammenstimmende Pluralis’ und die ‘unbegreiflichen gleichzeitigen Empfindungen.’ Zur Symphilosophie der Liebe bei Friedrich Schlegel und Novalis,” in Codierungen der Liebe in der Kunstpe- riode, ed. Walter Hinderer (Würzburg, 1997), 113–35, here 115. The fact, inci- dentally, that Schlegel’s then still close friend and collaborator Schleiermacher defended Lucinde in public, should recall that Schleiermacher’s own views on love, the self, and Bildung may share structurally in Schlegel’s own. 52. Elegien aus dem Griechischen (1798), in KA, 1:369–86; here 370. 53. Schlegel suggests criticism as the possible synthesis of the difference separating the Bildung of antiquity from that of modernity, in that criticism, being modern, entails the historically informed comprehension of that dilemma. See the useful introduction by Stuart Barnett to his edition and translation of Schlegel’s On the Study of Greek Poetry (Albany, 2001).  54. “Athenäum Fragmente,” no. 125, in KA, 2:165–255.  55.

Ibid., no. 255, 208–9. 58. This might also illuminate the dominance of Greece in this structure, whose rela- tive “absence” was easier to register than that of the Latin world and its tradition. 59.
