BERNS This special issue of African Arts is one outcome of a panel held at the 1987 African Studies Association meeting in Denver, Colorado. Titled "African Ceramic Arts: History and Identity in Clay," the panel's objective was to explore how ceramic traditions contribute to our understanding of the roles, meanings, and history of art in Africa. No preferential distinc- tion was made between studies emphasizing pottery vessels and those emphasizing pottery sculpture, or between studies on contemporary forms and those on archaeological traditions. Instead, participants were asked to deal critically with several suggested issues concerning ceramic arts: 1) how they inform us about social processes, values, or modes of establishing identity, or how the explication of social context helps us better understand the active roles of such arts; 2) how they help us reconstruct or understand history, or how history aids our un- derstanding of ceramics; 3) how they relate to or are informed by other arts produced by a group, or how knowing the larger universe of art production informs our knowledge of any one, including ceramics. Each of the five papers presented here addresses one or more of these issues through the study of figurative sculpture, anthropomorphic vessels, or decorated pottery. These ceramics represent a broad geographic distribu- tion, including the people of ancient Jenne in southern Mali, the Senufo of northern Ivory Coast, the Gurensi of northern Ghana, the Ga'anda and 'Bena of northeastern Nigeria, and the Mangbetu of northeastern Zaire.1' There is little doubt that fired clay (called variously ceramic, pottery, earthenware, or terracotta) represents one of the oldest media and techniques in the history of African material culture. The essential permanence of fired clay means that evidence of its production dates from the eighth millennium B.C. at sites in the Sahara, which supports the "indigenous African invention of pottery" (S.K. &amp; R.J. McIntosh 1986:419). The earliest ter- racotta sculpture yet discovered is associated with the Nok Culture of northern Nigeria (500 B.C.-A.D. 200). The ubiquity of the potter's art across the continent further justifies attention to this tradition as a means of expanding our understanding of African art and history. Much has been published on pottery techniques, taxonomies, and typologies, approached from ethnographic and archaeological perspectives.2 Yet, as John Picton laments, "the greater part" of systematic work on pot- tery production in Africa is "yet to be done" (1984:n.p.). Our knowledge of sculptural ceramics is limited to several geo- graphical regions, and the areas studied have largely been determined by accidents of discovery. Systematic excavations at sites in Mali, Ghana, Nigeria, and Chad have begun to shed light on Jenne, Akan, Nok, Ife, and Sao terracottas.3 Recent discoveries in Komaland, northern Ghana (Anquandah &amp; Van Ham 1985), and in Boura, Niger (Gado 1984), for example, only suggest that which still remains to be unearthed and under- stood. The versatility of clay increases its sculptural possibilities over those of many other media; yet its essential malleability has proven to be a dynamic counterpoint to the fundamental conservatism of most utilitarian pottery styles. Indeed, the im- portance of pottery to the archaeologist is based on the assump- tion that ". . . from among the almost infinite possible combina- tions of pastes, techniques, forms and decorations, only a small selection characterizes the pottery of any one culture. Pottery is a vehicle for the expression of cultural patterns" (David &amp; Hennig 1972:21:1). And by extension, changes in pottery are often the primary evidence for interpreting developments and changes over time. While environmental, functional, and technological constraints certainly influence pottery styles, other factors mediate the evolution of ceramic forms and their symbolic meaning. Understanding the latter poses the greater challenge and requires the careful scrutiny of how material culture operates within its social and historical contexts. David and Hennig's 1972 study of the settled Fulani of northern Came- roon is one important exploration of the variables influencing the production, distribution, and consumption of pottery, with a view to critically assessing "archaeological assumptions about the relationship between pottery and society" Sculptural ceramics tend to be less stylistically consistent than more utilitarian pottery, owing at least in part to differ- ences in how they function in African societies. Certain cor- puses of archaeological material, like the figurative sculpture from the Inland Niger Delta, the Chad Basin, and the Nok Cul- ture area, are strikingly diverse and enigmatic. How such ma- terial relates to a total social and cultural system is difficult to reconstruct when the systems no longer exist. Archaeological investigation has expanded our knowledge of the contexts in which sculptural ceramic arts operated, and it has been argued that without "scientific, stratigraphic excavation and radiomet- ric dating," they are destined to hang in an "interpretive limbo" (R.J. McIntosh &amp; S.K. McIntosh 1986:51). Yet, when cir- CHAM POT CALLED JINAKWIMTIYU, FOR PROTECTING THE HEALTH OF A PREGNANT WOMAN.

Ceramics have been studied by artists, art historians, ar- chaeologists, anthropologists, and historians, reflecting a broad range of disciplinary interests, objectives, and methodologies. In this compilation of five articles, the work of art historians, anthropologists, a historian, and an archaeologist is repre- sented. As a microcosm of the dynamic and interdisciplinary nature of African art studies, these papers deal with problems or approaches that do not necessarily coincide with the mainstream interests of their respective fields. For example, Roderick McIntosh, an archaeologist, begins his paper (p. 74) with a summary of the investigative priorities of revisionist Western art history because they parallel his own approach in interpreting Middle Niger terracottas: that an object should be studied "through examination of the history, social practices, and strategies of those with authority to create and recognize objects as art." Although the articles included here primarily deal with one category of artistic production, the themes addressed are not exclusive to the study of ceramic material. All the papers con- tribute to our understanding of how art production and use are inextricably bound to social, historical, and structural pro- cesses rather than abstracted from them. These papers also partake of a broad operational definition of art, one that cross- es the boundary often drawn between art and craft (ceramic sculpture vs. pottery), showing that such arbitrary distinctions can prevent, and have prevented, our full understanding of African material culture. The blurring of this boundary takes us further from a reliance on what Western aesthetics have de- termined is "art," and brings us closer to letting the objects de- fine for us their role and importance in African culture history. Indeed, as Philip Ravenhill observes, "...the recognition of some elements of African material culture as ART, has led to the almost total neglect of many other domains. The ultimate ethnocentrism is one in which recognition of the other is based solely upon the similarity to self" (1987:34). Furthermore, sev- eral authors here demonstrate the significance of looking be- yond the single art product to the larger visual and contextual universe in which art operates and interacts. 34</page><page sequence="4">The paper on Mangbetu pottery (p. 38) by Enid Schildkrout (an anthropologist), Jill Hellman (an anthropologist), and Cur- tis Keim (a historian) reminds us of the selective attention paid by scholars and collectors to anthropomorphic traditions, largely because greater realism has been equated with expres- sions of advanced civilization. A preoccupation with such tra- ditions and their presumed ritual or sacred importance per- petuated a distorted picture of the role and meaning of Man- gbetu representational ceramics. Of the 200 pots collected dur- ing the American Museum of Natural History's Congo Expedi- tion in the early twentieth century, only 20 are anthropomor- phic. The authors of this article argue convincingly that the production of figurative pottery by the Mangbetu depended upon a long-established regional tradition of decorated utilita- rian wares. By understanding the variables governing the production and consumption of utilitarian pottery in north- eastern Zaire, the emergence of a figurative tradition for a brief historical period can be better explained. And the record shows that these anthropomorphic vessels were never in- tended for sacred or ritual use as had been presumed. The larger universe of figurative prestige objects made in other media by Mangbetu artists helps explain further the creation of a ceramic equivalent. Contrary to the usual situation in the study of African art, the authors of the article on the Mangbetu have "a great deal of historical evidence to help us interpret the meaning of these pots." McIntosh's paper supports the position, taken by Jan Vansina (1984) and other Africanist scholars (e.g., Kasfir 1984; Ravenhill 1987), that art historians have not much advanced the effort to delineate a history of art in Africa. Furthermore, art historians have not focused enough attention on the social circumstances surrounding the production and use of art. It is not my intention, in this introduction, to respond in depth to such critiques. Others have engaged in valuable discourse on the state of African art scholarship and its historiography.4 Yet, such criticisms, which remain largely unchallenged, tend to underplay both the progress art historians have made with field studies and the rather considerable obstacles scholars face in writing a real history of art for areas in Africa about which little was written or known until recently.5 Perhaps most sig- nificantly, the relative paucity of archaeological data in the Af- rican record has restricted our diachronic investigations to iso- lated areas on the map, and even in places where considerable work has been done, like Nigeria, we are still far from under- standing the historical or social circumstances surrounding the "treasures" that have been unearthed or the relationships be- tween them. Even Vansina, in his presentation of a "streams of tradition" model for doing art history, illustrates his approach using only areas for which "adequate archaeological infor- mation exists" (1984:191). And he fails to answer his own inevi- table question: "What if archaeological data are absent, how- ever, or so sparse as not to make a difference?" McIntosh's paper convincingly reveals the substantial in- sights ceramic sculpture has provided into the history of the Middle Niger region of Mali. Systematic and controlled ar- chaeological excavations he has undertaken with Susan Mcin- tosh since 1977 have made it possible to propose a historical sequence for the emergence of the city of Jenne-jeno and for the parallel evolution of terracotta sculpture. The archaeologi- cal material provides more than a context in which to evaluate CHAM POT CALLED FERU, FOR CURING CHICKEN POX AND OTHER CHILDHOOD DISEASES. 21.4cm. MADE BY NGAJI. the sculpture, which is notable for its variety, its elaborate sur- face decoration, and its complex iconography. The terracottas excavated at Jenne-jeno shed light on the town's progressive urbanization because they were active ingredients in its pro- cess of social and historical change. Despite a wealth of contextual information recovered through excavation, McIntosh was still faced with the problem of explaining the meaning of the sculptures themselves - their distinctive styles - for which there are no direct ethno- graphic or ethnohistorical parallels. Herein lies the challenge, and one that has impact on the study of other groups of objects for which no direct descendant population survives. McIntosh argues that objects "serve as an instrument of communication by making references, however abstractly, to archaeologically discernible realities of the social life and history of their mak- ers' community" Thus, understanding art or material culture is inextricably tied to knowing the world in which it exists. Yet, without the means or evidence for knowing that world, is there no avenue for knowing its artistic products? McIntosh places something of a stranglehold on ethnographic analogy, an approach that deserves closer scrutiny as a comparative means of reconstructing and evaluating the past. While the re- lative merits of ethnoarchaeology may be debated, the poten- tial in such analogy depends on rigorous attention to the clus- tering of patterns and traits rather than on the exaggeration of random concurrences. Without this potential avenue of in- terpretation, how can we begin to evaluate artistic traditions for which archaeological contexts do not exist or have not yet 35</page><page sequence="5">been investigated, and how can we adequately interpret the meaning of archaeological evidence, without living informants to explain it? It is here that the methodologically sound field studies can continue to be significant. My article on ceramic sculpture from northeastern Nigeria (p. 48) is one effort by an art historian to meet the challenge of pursuing a historical approach to art in Africa for which ar- chaeological evidence is absent. This case study of sacred ceramic vessels made by two Gongola Valley groups, the Ga'anda and the 'Bena, does not establish a datable chronol- ogy- an impossible task given the available data. Yet it does advance our understanding of interethnic, intraregional histor- ical relationships as reconstructed from ceramic and other evi- dence. Instead of focusing on one group or on one art product, I emphasize the similarities and differences in cultural com- plexes existing within and between groups over time, which include art and the contexts in which it is used and functions ideologically. Essentially, the model proposed in this paper shows to what extent the detailed and particularistic study of ceramic traditions can contribute to an explication of history, albeit one that without archaeological evidence must remain speculative and heuristic. The success of this approach further depends on synthesizing data drawn from linguistics, oral his- tory, geography, and ethnography. In agreement with McIn- tosh, Vansina, and others, this paper takes the firm position that art's potential for explicating history rests on the convic- tion that its production, use, and meaning are vital to the very historical as well as social and cultural processes it seeks to de- fine. Art historian Carol Spindel's article on Senufo potters of Ivory Coast (p. 66) deals exclusively with a utilitarian pottery tradition, but one whose technology of production is firmly rooted in the cultural values of Senufo society. This paper goes beyond a study of process and shows how technology reflects other patterns of culture. The continuity and repetition in the production of pottery are structurally parallel to the functioning of the Senufo age-class system. Spindel supports the point raised by Picton in his introduction to the anthology Earthen- ware in Asia and Africa (1984) that "any technology is part of a given cultural system, and may be constrained by other parts of that culture." Although as outsiders we may be able to deal exclusively with techniques of manufacture, the producers themselves are less likely to abstract this activity from their total social or cultural matrix. The value of looking at the interrelationships between areas of cultural activity and expression is illustrated in the paper by Fred Smith, an art historian, on the Gurensi of Ghana (p. 60). To elucidate the importance of pottery to the Gurensi, Smith identifies the technical, stylistic, and conceptual parallels be- tween pots and mud or clay containers that constitute other categories of material culture. Since the sacred forces as- sociated with the Gurensi deification of the Earth regulate life, the pots, houses, granaries, and shrines made of Earth's mate- rial essence are by extension associated with maintaining so- cial stability and continuity. While the role of female potters takes on social importance for the Gurensi, Smith shows that evaluating their contribution depends on exploring the wider material and ideological universe of which they and their work are a part. Smith's and Spindel's articles support the observation that the role of potters in African societies deserves greater atten- tion. Nigel Barley argues that it is because of an obsession with smithing that the social and ritual implications of pottery- making have been largely ignored (1984:98-100). This points to important issues of gender and technology, and our Western preoccupation with a men-iron-smithing paradigm over one exploring women-clay-potting. Barley believes that more at- tention should be paid to the female potter in West African ethnography because the process of pottery-making serves as a rich model for the ways societies handle change. His ideas suggest the potential in exploring the symbolic analogies be- tween technology, gender, and social and ritual process. Spin- del's and Smith's papers - which deal with caste systems cen- tered on male smithing or casting- identify briefly how pottery-making structures and reflects social relationships. My paper on Gongola Valley ceramics extends Barley's transfor- mational paradigm to the production of spirit-containing ves- sels. How these ceramics look as well as how they are made refer to changes in social or sacred states of being. The ways ceramic arts can illuminate African art and social history are rich and varied, as this issue of African Arts demon- strates. In these studies, the potential of fired clay is implicit by its very antiquity, durability, and ubiquity. Despite the flood of modern containers entering the African marketplace, the pro- duction of pottery persists, often quite vigorously. The practi- cality of terracotta containers in meeting the domestic needs of agricultural communities has not yet been matched by a mod- ern mass-produced equivalent. Thus, opportunities exist to study and document this art, while probing the social and his- torical circumstances of production, use, and meaning. Nonutilitarian and often anthropomorphic pottery used in ritual or sacred contexts has suffered more from the changes brought by Islam and Christianity. While I studied over fifteen groups in northeastern Nigeria still making and/or using ritual and sacred anthropomorphic vessels, the acceleration of reli- gious conversions has prompted their abandonment by many, and in some cases their purposeful destruction (see Chappel 1973). It is not an exaggeration to suggest that much terracotta ma- terial still lies buried under sub-Saharan African soil. Substan- tial barriers- financial, political, legal, and otherwise- im- pede the discovery, exploration, and excavation of archaeolog- ical sites. Not unique to the African context or to the contem- porary world is the rampant pillaging of sites and the illicit traffic in antiquities.6 Despite the 1970 articles of the UNESCO Convention or the laws prohibiting the commerce in an- tiquities, the illegal appropriation and sale of cultural property persist at the expense of gaining access to information about an African, and indeed a universal, human past.7 That this loss is irreversible makes it all the more lamentable. Philip Ravenhill's description of the situation (1987:34) as it affects its most vulnerable victims - African national museums- pro- vides closure to this introduction, which has stressed the past, present, and future contributions of ceramic art studies to building an art history in Africa: "Our insistence on the intrin- sic worth of an African objet d'art, on its plastic self-sufficiency, cannot be separated from the fact that all too often the African art object in a Western museum or art collection is otherwise mute; its provenance and real history have been lost due to the series of commercial transactions that have brought it out of Africa, and its 'identity' has been shrunk to a stark ethnic label. It may be 'saved' as art, yet 'lost' as a cultural and histor- ical document." 0 Notes, page 101 BENA POT CALLED NGWARKANDANGRA, FOR TREATING SKIN DISEASESB 309cm.

I would like to thank all the participants in the double panel I chaired at the 1987 ASA meeting, although everyone is not represented here. All the articles in this issue, with the excep- tion of Fred Smith's, are revisions and expansions of papers presented at the ASA meeting. 2. Space does not allow the publication of this extensive bibliography here. I would like to thank Janet Stanley, Chief Librarian, National Museum of African Art, for her generous assistance with a bibliographic search of the literature on African ceramic arts. One of the most frequently referenced works is The Potter's Art in Africa (Fagg &amp; Picton 1970); also worth noting are Drost's survey of African pottery (1967) and Leith-Ross' survey of Nigerian wares (1970). 3. There are many publications dealing with the work accomplished on these terracotta traditions. Some of the primary sources are B.Fagg (1977), J.-P. and A. Lebeuf (1977), R.J. and S.K. McIntosh (1979), and Willett (1967). Other references and surveys include Ancient Treasures in Terra Cotta of Mali and Ghana (1980), de Grunne (1980), Eyo and Willett (1980), Schaedler (1985), and Stossel (1984). 4. See Ben-Amos 1987, Biebuyck 1983, and Kasfir 1984, among others. Several panels have recently been organized to address these issues; they are summarized in Frank 1987: 90, n.1. 5. In their critiques of Africanist art history, both Kasfir (1984: 166) and Ravenhill (1987: 35) at least acknowledge the paucity of primary historical data, especially for the precolonial period. 6. The recent discovery of an unpillaged Moche tomb in Peru, described in the article "Discovering the New World's Richest Unlooted Tomb" (Alva 1988), underscores the historical and geographical dimensions of this global problem. Even though it emphasizes the spectacular, the National Geographic article illustrates unequivocally what can be learned by studying the contents of a Moche burial in situ. The J. Paul Getty Museum was recently accused of acquiring a rare fifth-century B.C. statue illegally exported from Italy (Minneapolis Star Tribune, Aug. 4, 1988). Though the Getty's culpability is still being debated, the allegation alone shows how the international art market is serviced by grave robbers and looters of archaeological sites at work all over the globe. Whether it is a terracotta from Mali, a gold prestige object from Peru, or a marble statue from Italy, all are examples of cultural patrimony difficult, if not impossi- ble, to protect from the unbroken cycle of theft, export, and sale as collectable art masterpiece. 7. The market for illegally exported artand the negativeimpact of its removalon scholarship are discussed in depth by R.J. and S.K. McIntosh (1986). They explain the 1970 UNESCO Con- vention as one concerned with a "means of prohibiting and preventing the illicit import, export and transfer of ownership of cultural property."
