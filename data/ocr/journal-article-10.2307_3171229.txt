As these identities are not only unstable but also often in an- tagonistic relation to each other, the only common ground they share is their resistance against any imposed (even self-im- posed) uniform or generalized notion of a so-called immigrant identity. 8</page><page sequence="4">Wodiczko Patrica Pirreda Paris, this is not a good place for me at the moment. This is a place where all the broken pieces of my life came to light for me. Paris, this is the place where I revealed all that, the place where I was able to realize all the broken ends of myself, which also helped fracture me, breaking me enormously. But at this moment, one cannot speak of constructing whatever it is, one is still at the destruction. I have the impression in this country I do not exist. At best, existing thanks to my child, my husband, my friends, but not as myself, not thanks to my capabilities.... It is easy from those broken pieces to make a cup like that, but it is not easy from those broken pieces to make more than that. It is not easy because things are already carved out, they already have a form. That, one cannot change. One can modify it, but that is always going to remain, and that is life. 9</page><page sequence="5">assemblage 23 Krzysztof Wodiczko It's already artifice in the way Jagoda speaks on the screen, and herself already, she is a per- former. She is not really herself. She is herself and she is herself as a performer. This is an object, an architecture, that provokes, but it is also a container of ob- jects that are real memories, real facts. They are undeniable facts like a letter from immigration telling her that she is going to be deported. This is a real fact, you cannot say it is a story. Yet she is making a story out of it. So you can take this fact and laugh or cry or ... 10</page><page sequence="6">Wodiczko Patrica Pirreda It is possible, obviously, to imagine taking these breaks and sticking them together in order to try and reconstruct what I was at the time. I can only try it in order to make something else. Me, I am, after all, a privi- leged immigrant with my piece of Italy on my shoulders, but the immigrants, the real ones, who arrive in a country where their culture has nothing to see, the borders in any case are far away, well, they die, they die of solitude. Thanks to the birth of my child I have a resident card. This card was issued 20 September 88 and my child was born 10 June 88. Thanks to the fact that I have had a child, messieurs les Frangais, I have had a residence card lasting ten years. In ten years, in five years now, one will see what I am going to do. I don't know what will happen. One must hope that my child will behave. 11</page><page sequence="7">assemblage 23 Krzysztof Wodiczko But somehow it provokes. For example, the fact that I saw Jagoda bringing this to an un- derground mall in Houston, where everyone is there: the workers who operate this mall and a variety of corporate ex- ecutives and shoppers. They seem to be very happy to have an occasion to speak. Somehow anything can be said. Because it is no longer some- thing being said that normally is not acceptable. No, it is something for which this stick is taking responsibility. It is something in between the op- erator and the other people and architecture, the environ- ment that already suggests what should be said, what ac- tivities are allowed, and how people should behave and relate to each other. This is a new piece of architecture or design: it's a prop, it's a stage set, it's a speaker, an instrument for speech, and it's a magic kind of object that changes the space because it establishes a new kind of ground. 12</page><page sequence="8">Wodiczko Jagoda Przybylak And suddenly - panic - im- migration raid! ...

One girl from Columbia tore off her blue cleaner's uniform and stood there in black underwear, trembling from the cold. "If they catch me, I won't admit I work here. In a few weeks I'm getting married. I have to stay in this country. I'm not going to let them throw me out." Every one of us had problems trying to stay in America. 13</page><page sequence="9">assemblage 23 Krzysztof Wodiczko The interesting thing is the pos- sibility of recording some of the responses. It became clear be- cause people were volunteering precious confessions. And they were waiting for the occasion to confess, and the perfect situa- tion to confess is to a stranger, another stranger who would vanish soon. So the idea possibly would be to expand the program of this equipment with microphones and speakers that could be pulled out . . . so that there would be some kind of exten- sions or tentacles that would be given to those who want to listen to more stories or give their own stories. I think that is possible because this object is already very absurd, absurd enough as a stick. 14</page><page sequence="10">Wodiczko Abdelkader N'Dali Two-thirds of the Moroccans found in France came under contract. At Simca, at Peugeot, in the mines, in the building trades, the cleaning trades, craftsmen. Me, I don't understand why they turn against us now,... because before, before in 1969, '72, '73, they were walking into foyers and cafes looking for workers. The French needed workmen from 1965 to '80. We were ro- bots, we took the place of robots ... on assembly lines. The line went at forty an hour and a fel- low put on the wheel, the door. Each put on a piece, each put a piece on the car. The car was complete . . . and, in fact, we were 26,000 and 2,000 cars per day... 2,000. They have installed robots now, there are a third who work. They have sacked, all sacked the for- eigners, all. They are turning against foreigners, hiring a young man ... they are sacking foreigners, hiring ... every time ... every time it is like that and it is shit . . . it is shit. 15</page><page sequence="11">assemblage 23 Krzysztof Wodiczko I think it is just a matter of the way we deal with this strange- ness daily .... In practice: in educational practice, in conver- sational practice, and all along this carnival of everyday life to recognize how rich and com- plex, how much there is that is hidden to explore and to reveal in all those areas that put into doubt those preconceived no- tions, or those notions imposed from the outside or the inside, of identity and community. The hope is that this Alien Staff, as an artifice, can inspire the possi- bility of sharing, between and among "foreigners" and "non- foreigners," the pain and diffi- culty of reconciling ourselves with our own strangeness. 16</page><page sequence="12">Wodiczko Abdelkader N'Dali My father was a sharpshooter from '39 to '45, with the Senegalese at the front, while the noncommissioned officers were traveling in England. Gen- eral De Gaulle was traveling and foreigners were defending the French flag. And all that ... they forgot that . .. that is seri- ous ... that counts. They forgot that, and when you bring it up, you say, my father is French, he says to you: it's not you ... it's not you who went through the war, it is not you who was a soldier! But I tell him, it is my father! Here are his papers! They throw them aside, every time they throw them aside. An Arab before them re- mains an Arab, a Maghrebin remains a Maghrebin. An out- sider, he is deported. After all, it is one Arab less. 17</page><page sequence="13">assemblage 23 Krzysztof Wodiczko: Disfiguring - Refiguring Postscript by Mark Rakatansky Someone asked, someone will always ask, it is necessary for someone always to ask: Why the body? or Why the figural? or Why the anthropomorphism? Wodiczko's Alien Staff suggests many questions, but these questions above are all shortened versions of another ques- tion. Because if the question is (and it is) how to proceed beyond a nai've hu- manism, a humanism that represses any difficulties or complexities by presenting the body as something whole, complete, total, autonomous, safe, and free in spirit - then it must be said that the figure per se is not the problem. The problem is the evocation of the figure as a stand-in, as a surrogate, as a substitute, for dealing with, for address- ing, the problem that the figure pro- poses - the problem, that is, of the social and psychological construction of the human subject. The figure, in other words, is all too often evoked in order to repress the problem of the figure. But, of course, any aesthetic abstraction, such as an architectural abstraction, also attempts to repress the problem of the social construction of the subject. Even though, or perhaps precisely because, the abstract is already thoroughly in- scribed by and simultaneously inscribes 1. Campanile di Santa Maria Formosa, 1986 2. Border Projection, San Diego Museum of Man, 1988 physical, psychological, and social figurations. But perhaps these categories - the figural and the abstract - are already part of the problem. Hasn't Gerhard Richter, to give a distinct but contempo- rary example to Wodiczko, already demonstrated the uselessness of these as exclusive categories, focusing instead on the operations under which these cate- gories (in his case, in painting) arise and are forever enfolded? It might be said that Wodiczko has also focused on the operations under which these categories - in the public sphere - arise and are enfolded, focusing on how the social and psychological con- struction of the subject always circulates around the simultaneous yet complex abstraction of ideologies and their figu- ration. Focusing, in other words, on how the figuration of subjects reveals itself as a series of social abstractions and how the abstraction of buildings (or monu- ments or vehicles or instruments) reveals itself as a series of figural gestures. So, then, let me propose a concept, or rather reapply a concept, that seems to me capable not only of redirecting the problem proposed by the figure, but also of revealing linkages throughout the diverse body of Wodiczko's work. The concept I am refering to is Brecht's concept of the gestic: "The realm of attitudes adopted by the characters towards one another is what we call the realm of gest. Physical atti- tude, tone of voice and facial expression are all determined by a social gest: the characters are cursing, flattering, in- structing one another, and so on. The 18</page><page sequence="14">Wodiczko attitudes which people adopt towards one another include even those attitudes which would appear to be quite private, such as the utterances of physical pain in illness, or of religious faith."' Physical gestures, aesthetic gestures, design gestures, are never matters of fact; they are always directed toward another, toward others. But if these gestures are already social, their repeti- tion as conventions requires that they be interrogated as such to reveal this condi- tion. Brecht: "This means that the artist has to adopt a definite attitude . . he cannot let [the gesture] just speak only for itself, simply expressing it as the fact dictates."2' The drawing forth of what is social in the gesture, of the "attitudes adopted by the characters towards one another," required, for Brecht, the turning of the gesture into the gest. A gest, in John Willett's words, is "at once gesture and gist, attitude and point: one aspect of the relation between two people, studied singly, cut to essentials and physically or verbally expressed."' The term "essen- tials" here refers to the framing of (what in dynamical systems theory would be designated as) singularities, not to some reduction of the complexity of the social and psychological field. Brecht: "These expressions of a gest are highly compli- cated and contradictory, so that they cannot be rendered by a single word and the actor must take care that in giving his image the necessary emphasis he does not lose anything, but emphasizes the entire complex."4 I have discussed the possibilities of a gestic architecture elsewhere,' so let me 3. Real Estate Projection, 1987 4. Arco de la Victoria, 1991 apply the concept here to figure the design work of Wodiczko. Or is it his art work? If one can even separate them into exclusive categories. I, for one, cannot. Because, for one thing, he began his career as an industrial designer. So it might be said that he has never ceased to be a designer whose designs circulate around the subject of human industries, around certain forms, certain gestures, of human laborings. From the beginning, the whole of Wodiczko's work demonstrates the critical potential of evoking figural gests through a variety of tactical assaults in order to problematize both the figural and nonfigural - relaying, oscillating, resonating in the space between the "subjective" body and "objective" archi- tecture. I say relaying, oscillating, resonating, because to say that the gestic occupies the space between the body and archi- tecture would not be correct. A gestic approach does not occupy any one place, any ideal other place. A gestic approach does not reside: it finds within a figural gesture a social abstraction, and within an abstraction (of the spatial, for ex- ample) a figural gesture. A gestic ap- proach problematizes both the figural and the spatial, finding the social and psychological relations of bodies and architecture - without residing in either of the two impossible extremes of a "pure interiority" (subjective figura- tion) or a "pure exteriority" (abstract spatiality). 19</page><page sequence="15">assemblage 23 A gestic approach uses the fiction of subjectivity to question the position of the subject, just as it uses the fiction of instrumentality (in Wodiczko's case, of buildings, monuments, vehicles, and instruments) to question the position of the object. And equally so the reverse: it uses the fiction of instrumentality to question the position of the subject, just as it uses the fiction of subjectivity to question the position of the object. Wodiczko: "My work attempts to enter and trespass this field of vision: the position of the individual as a subject being con- structed, or produced, through the ur- ban space in relation to others and in relation to monuments. I try to disrupt this continuous process of reproducing the individual in space."6 A gestic approach considers any situa- tion as an entrance into a field, as an opportunity, not as a problem that could be solved by one particular intervention (including its own). By revealing the construction and reproduction of conventional figuration through the figuration of new associations and dis- associations, gestic constructions pose questions that open up the possibility of the reconfiguration of the conventional, of the hegemonic. I have already said that Wodiczko is a designer whose designs circulate around certain forms of human laborings, around, that is, the gestures of certain forms of laboring. In fact, his early works would seem to be the most gestic of all his work, in that they seem to translate directly the physical materialization of social gestures into form and movement: 5. Vehicle, 1972 6. Vehicle-Coffee Shop 1, 1973/1979 the pacing and pondering and other "self-expressive" gestures of "the artist" (Personal Instrument, 1969, and Vehicle, 1972), the vocal and physical gestures of "coffee-shop critiques" (Vehicle-Coffee Shop 1 and Vehicle-Coffee Shop 2, both 1973/1979), the Sisyphean physical laboring of "the worker" (Vehicle for the Worker, 1973/1979), the "free and multi- directional" movement of people in the square (Vehicle-Platform, 1973/1979), the gestural qualities of "the orator's voice" (Vehicle-Podium, 1973/1979). Although the rate of motion varies in response to these gestures, the potential movement of all of Wodiczko's early vehicles - regardless of whether they are propelled by the laborings of the artist, the intellectual, the orator, the masses, or the worker - is "in one direction only." Thus the social and psychological aspects of gestures are evoked, but this critique of the possibility of any critique, this irony bordering on cynicism, threat- ens to erode the critical potential of the gest by reducing complexity to futility. But this was Poland in the early 1970s, Poland under the "liberal autocracy" of Gierek, whose post-Stalinist reforms insufficiently veiled the fact that there was only negligible loosening of state control of art and design. And, of course, this is why Wodiczko calls these projects the Allegorical Vehicles. But something else might be said here about allegory and its relation to the gestic, and about the difference between Wodiczko's early vehicles and his later ones, something not specifically about Poland in the 1970s, but about critical gestures under any "liberal" forms of government. This something else is the 20</page><page sequence="16">Wodiczko difference between enactment and symbolism. Wodiczko's most recent objects - the Homeless Vehicle (1988- 89), the Poliscar (1991), and the Alien Staff (1992-94) - do not symbolize their condition (or life) in some other, separate, place. They enact their (inevi- table) symbolisms in the place of their enactment, in real time, as a direct event. The event is the event, the event is not taken out of context, out of the place of its enactment, and deposited in some other, safe, place - which is a problem, a limit, of most installations, whatever else their value. This problem is not a problem of Wodiczko's projections, as they do not set themselves up in some separate place, nor do they arbitrarily project some other place, some other imagery from some other place, against their site.7 At their best, Wodiczko's projec- tions attempt to "draw out" from their site social and psychological gests, even though, or especially because, what they do is so clearly not literally a drawing-out but an act of artificial superimposition. But if these works are acts of projection, they are not projections on some "blank screen" of the site. As Rosalyn Deutsche has pointed out, Wodiczko's projections are "projections onto projections," pro- jections onto the "projections of viewing subjects who, through the modes of identification solicited by traditional architecture, 'ensure' an imaginary self- coherence by looking at naturalized images of the city." In order to "disen- gage viewers from habitual modes of perceiving and inhabiting the city: of receiving its messages," Deutsche notes, Wodiczko's work "mobilizes in its audi- 7. Vehicle-Coffee Shop 2, 1973/1979 8. Vehicle-Platform, 1973/1979 ence an awareness that the architecture on which it projects images is not merely a collection of beautiful or functional objects but, rather, speech acts endlessly transmitting messages about the mean- ing of the city."' Thus, instead of importing some other charged imagery arbitrarily to a given site that has, inevitably, its own complex and charged imagery - which is another variation of this same problem of many installations (and many architectures) - Wodiczko emphasizes gestures of the transmitting messages of the site (the building or monument or landscape) and returns them back to the site at the scale of the site. As these projections last from one hour to at most three weeks, Wodiczko can act swiftly and cunningly, addressing a range of topical issues from environmental destruction (R. C. Harris Filtration Plant, 1988) to nationalist reawakening (Huth-Haus, 1990). And as most of the sites he is allowed to project upon are cultural institutions, he has developed diverse ways of emphasizing the gests of cultural politics circulating through and around these institutions: the grasp of collecting hands in Museum of Natural History (1983), the contain- ment of the archive file-cabinet in Seattle Art Museum (1984), cultural redevelopment as containment in Astor Building (1984), cultural tourism/terror- ism, camera in hand, in the Venice Biennale (1986), the degree of govern- mental reflexivity of a national art insti- tution, one hand holding one of the "thousand points of lights" and the other hand holding a gun, in Hirshhorn Museum (1988), and the contrast be- tween one nation's increase in cultural 21</page><page sequence="17">assemblage 23 freedom and another nation's increase in censorship, the entombed hands inscripted with "GLASNOST IN USA," in Whitney Museum of American Art (1989). These projections use a range of imag- ery, from the specific and topical (Pershing missiles) to more general, everyday, bodily actions - turning the gestures of these images into gests. For example, the projection Massachu- setts Institute of Technology (1981) is just a pair of hands - shirt sleeves peering from behind jacket cuffs (yes, well), watches (many people wear watches), male (all right, probably), the hands of two "administrators": of what- ever sort (perhaps) - all centered on the inscribed INSTITVTE of the building's cornice. Then (perhaps) this projection might have some relation to the applied handshake of MIT's applied (military-industrial) research. As well as, of course, to the entire range of other alliances that one finds at an academic institution - because, on the one hand, the gest should "emphasize the entire complex" of relations and, on the other hand, one exclusive reading can never be determined with certainty anyway. But it's just a pair of hands. Just a friendly gesture. It's a pleasure: doing business with you. A single eye constitutes Wodiczko's projection on the Berne Parliament (Bundeshaus, 1985). But the eye looks this way (toward the national bank) and that way (toward the Canton bank) and now this way (toward the city bank) and now that way (down at the parking lot in front of the parliament, under which lies 9. Whitney Museum of American Art, 1989 10. Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 1981 the "national vault containing the Swiss gold") and then this way (toward the "clear, pure Calvinist sky"). But whichever way the eye is looking, the eye is looking, looking around. But it's just an eye. Wodiczko: "It was a question of what would be accepted, and then, when accepted, what would make a point. I figured no one would object to the image of the eye, and at the same time they wouldn't have to know that the eye would change the direction of its gaze."' There are several moments in Wodiczko's discussions of his projec- tions where it would seem as if he wholly subscribes to the myth of the direct anthropomorphic identification of clas- sical architecture, but, like the shift of the Berne eye, he slips away from this trap: "In earlier projections I dealt with the ideas of the body - an official body which is the body as faqade - from images in which the media present people like buildings. I dealt with the way the media turns those photographed people into monuments. I also dealt with the way buildings are constructed and their faqades are often photo- graphed, by emphasizing their sym- metrical features to show a human face and the force of the corporate body. Neo-classicism resembles our bodies because it is a deliberate morphology. The question, then, was always how far I should go with the similarity between the image and the building - between these parallel bodies - and how much I should alter them."'0 22</page><page sequence="18">Wodiczko This is one of many examples in Wodi- czko's work of what in Greek culture was known as metis, cunning intelligence, which proposes that one of the best ways to battle a cunning adversary is "to turn its own weapons against it."" Notice that Wodiczko's repertoire of images circu- lates around the cliched types, the cliched gestures, of the ornament of institutional buildings and monuments: bodies, "heroic" animals (eagles, horses), armament, assorted symbolic equip- ment, and inscriptions. What Wodiczko does is to use the figural myth of neo- classicism against itself. This is a disfiguring, a disfiguring to show the disfiguration of historical time already at work, a disfiguring to allow for a refiguring. This swerved repetition is particularly useful in his projections on monuments, where Wodiczko uses the political com- pulsion to repeat against itself. He cun- ningly uses the gestures of yesterday's history, yesterday's battles - usually considered both as inevitable and yet "dated" with all the strange quaintness of the past (the costumes, the looks, the slogans)-against the gestures of today's history, today's battles - which, with the alienating distance of time, will seem as quaint, as contrived, as con- structed as those of the past. And thus (perhaps) the present might be seen as not inevitable, and thus (perhaps) the history of the past might also seem less than inevitable, less a matter of fact, and thus (perhaps) the constant rewriting of history that always occurs after the fact might also allow for a rewriting of the present. While many of the images that Wodiczko uses on his monument pro- 11. Bundeshaus, 1985 12. Bundeshaus jections might be said to be didactic, they might also be said to match cun- ningly the didactics of the past, bringing these issues up-to-date, to reflect on both the past and the present (and thus on the future). Such is the case in the Homeless Projec- tion (1986), as Deutsche observes, in which Wodiczko "manipulates the statues' own language to challenge the apparent stability of its own significa- tion, transforming the classical gestures, poses, and attitudes of the sculpted figures into those used by people begging on the streets. George Washington's left forearm, for example, presses down on a can of Windex and holds a rag, so that the imperial gesture of his right arm is transformed into a signal used by the unemployed to stop cars, clean windshields, and obtain a street donation."'12 Or take the projec- tion on Franco's Civil War victory monument (Arco de la Victoria, 1991) three days after the outbreak of the Gulf War: a gun in one skeletal hand and a gas nozzle in the other, over which hangs the open question of the gas station: cCuantos?, which can mean either How much? or How many? But having shown the gestic at work in the gestures of these hit-and-run projec- tions, it should be said that what is most interesting about Wodiczko's recent objects is that they are able to address social and psychological abstraction and figuration with neither the allegory of the earlier objects nor the direct evoca- tion of symbolic figures of the projec- tions. This is particularly true of the Homeless Vehicle, another example of cunning disfiguration and refiguration, 23</page><page sequence="19">assemblage 23 in this case, of the urban mobilizations of the homeless supermarket cart. This object, as I said earlier, does not symbol- ize its condition, it enacts it. It does not symbolize life in some other, separate, place; in use or on exhibit it already suggests a real intervention in urban life. The object itself now gestures - ex- tends and contracts, transforming and projecting its varied figurations into local and urban space. The object refig- ures the figuration of the supermarket cart in relation to the figuration of the laborings, the gestures, of inhabitation - walking, sleeping, sitting, defecating, cooking, washing, storing, monetary laboring - but, at the same time, it reveals the social gest of public and private gestures: the gestures that are proper if someone has some property, if that someone has an inside that that someone owns or rents. The Homeless Vehicle is an inside that is not inside, an inhabitation that is outside (physically, psychologically, and socially), but also somehow an outside that is not totally outside. It is property, after all. The Homeless Vehicle thus problema- tizes the concepts of not only inside and outside, but also public and private, use and symbol, subject and object, machine and architecture, local place and urban network, self and community, body and space, figuration and abstraction. It resides in neither side, but reveals the one in the other. It relays, oscillates, resonates. The Poliscar continues this investigation of the operations under which these categories arise and are forever enfolded 13. Homeless Projection, 1986 14. Homeless Vehicle, 1988-89 by giving another transforming form to the gestures of mobile inhabitation, but this time with a further emphasis on the gestures of communication and commu- nity - transmitting, recording, plan- ning, distributing information or aid - as it functions as "an urban communi- cations network for the homeless ... [establishing] links between various encampments of the homeless, forming new social ties and leading to greater intercommunity and urban organiza- tion."'3 The form of the Poliscar seems less articulated than that of the Home- less Vehicle , but then again it is not mimicking the structural instrumen- talism of a supermarket cart but the (ludicrous) attempted stealth of, say, a military or a surveillance vehicle. Wodiczko: "[The Poliscar] is simply a response to the image of the contemporary city, which the uniformed police and the real estate armies have made a militarized zone. And the image of the city being overtaken by a force of communication vehicles everywhere, an impossible insur- rection, accounts for the ridiculous aspect of its appearence."'4 The Poliscar subsequently refigures this figuration of the stealth vehicle in rela- tion to the figuration of the gestures of walking, driving, and sleeping. This problematization of subject and object is furthered by the juxtaposition of the gestures of the bodies seen on the screen and heard on the loudspeaker of the conical "head" of the vehicle, projecting now in "real time," with the gestures of the vehicle operators, also, one might say, projecting in "real time." 24</page><page sequence="20">Wodiczko This disfiguring and refiguring of sub- jects and objects brings us to the Alien Staff, which continues the investigations of the Poliscar to question the ideologi- cal abstraction and social figuration of identity and community, especially as these issues relate to the situation of the immigrant. The immigrant must always allow for the possibility that circum- stances will require yet another migra- tion, and thus the previous mobilities of the Homeless Vehicle and the Poliscar are further developed in this project to the point of portability. But, at the same time, the object has to have a presence - the object of the object is to set, to create, "a scene," a situation where immigrants can bring their so- called private stories to the so-called public sphere, which it does by cun- ningly disfiguring and refiguring the "attribute-cliche of a wanderer": "The owner of the staff appears to be one with a history of wanderers, the tradition itself being a cliche, but it is a cliche used here strategically.... The strangely familiar shape of the staff allures the 'non-stranger' to come closer to the operator/storyteller."'5 And further, the object of the object is to be a "con- sumer-quality" object (as one of the participants in the Homeless Vehicle project requested of Wodiczko), so as to legitimatize the presence of the immi- grant operators so the public-sphere police do not come along and ask them to be less public. With a video monitor, loudspeaker, and storage space, this is certainly a con- sumer-quality walking stick. On the monitor appears, and from the speaker emerges, the gestures and voice of the 15. Homeless Vehicle 16. Poliscar, 1991 same operator that holds this staff and speaks and gestures to, say, the smaller objects contained in its midsection. Objects like: "rejected visa applications, immigration and legal documents, apart- ment keys, old photographs, and the various identity cards acquired by the owner." But if these objects and stories and gestures would seem to, or are sup- posed to, add up to the whole of a single identity, they do not. The disparities in the multiple representations reveal the abstractions of the figural gestures, enacting a gestic doubling or trebling that provides an alienation effect be- tween the character and the actor that is the operator - in order to avoid the dismissive reduction of these stories to a single, humanistic, "hard-luck" story: "Usually when we look at the image of a speaker on our TV screens at home, we don't see the 'actual' person speaking behind the image. This confrontation, facilited by the operator and his or her staff, is therefore unexpected; the story told by the staff's operator is interrupted and even contradicted by the pre-re- corded image which tells other stories and vice-versa. The image on the screen may show the operator recounting a tragic or comic moment concerning his or her alien status; however, the operator who holds the staff, thus relieved from the burden of telling this story, presents another face. Standing next to his or her own history, the operator asks the viewer, who now appears to be the stranger, to tell their own story. At this point a new space is created by the operator/object in relation to the specta- tor. The distinction between stranger and non-stranger is problematized 25</page><page sequence="21">assemblage 23 here-maybe around this staff everyone becomes a different kind of stranger."l6 Thus we might, if we were to be in Paris, or on pages eight or nine or eleven or on the next page or the last, come across Patrica Pirreda, one of the six Alien Staff operators thus far, talking about her broken expresso cup, her personal cup from the family set, the pieces of which are visible in the container, while on the monitor we see her attempting to refig- ure these broken pieces, finding already in this disfigured object a network of resonate, open, inconclusive, enfolded, parallel meanings, around which she labors in order to have some control over the design of her own figuration, through her own labors, her own capa- bilities, not those of the state or her husband or child, even if, as she says, "it is easy from those broken pieces to make a cup like that, but it is not easy from those broken pieces to make more than that," even if "things ... already have a form," and even if only, or especially, "in order to make something else." There is always something else to be made, even if only from those things that already have a form, those cliched social and psychological forms and gestures. As Wodiczko develops new versions of the Alien Staff, adding mi- crophones and speakers, transforming the staff into some technoclothes, ex- panding it into an "alien network," or reducing it (in his latest version) to a gaglike apparatus with video lips, these versions will emerge, as in all his previ- ous work, through an interrogation of the history of the gestures of forms and form of gestures: the cliched gestures of 17. Poliscar 18. Alien Staff, 1992-94 the past and present, and the already cliched gestures of the cyber-Buck Rogers-future (headsets, power gloves, prosthetic appendages), the already past of sci-fi. Because, of course, all gestures are already cliched, which is why they require the framing distance of the gest to be perceived, and thus critiqued. But Wodiczko's work functions not only as critique but as proposition, not a universal proposition, but a local propo- sition, a proposition of questioning, a proposition for change. It functions as a series of open questions, not final solu- tions, as it thematizes both the desire for and the impossibility of universal solu- tions, both the desire for and the impos- sibility of definitive instrumentalities. In other words, if these works relay, oscillate, and resonate, they do so to bring forth questions, but also to allow no easy or rushed answers. This is Wodiczko's intervening in the figuration of what is present. So that someone might ask a question. So that questions might be asked. So that it might be possible to consider a refigur- ing of the present, the present now past, and the present to come.
