<plain_text><page sequence="1">Many can testify from personal experience that the Graduate Record Examination reflects actual teaching personnel and course offerings in many U.S. colleges. The personnel of the commit- tee which prepared the biology questions is illuminating. The five members include one each from a state college, a medical school, a teachers college, a state university, and a private uni- versity. Their professional interests as given in American Men of Science are: testing, educational psychology; physiological chemistry; zoology-cellular physiology, biophysics; economic bi- ology--mammalogy; entomology; botany; radiology-biological effects of radiation. The real roots lie deeper than committee personnel, or prevalence of unbalanced curriculums in present day colleges. These represent the consequences of developments which began in the last century. Population increase, rise of great urban centers, and shift of the U.S. from a predominately agri- cultural to a predominately industrial nation undoubtedly encouraged de-emphasis on plant sciences in teaching. Another influence has probably been more decisive. Of those college students interested in plant sciences, most will take degrees in agricultural colleges or forestry schools, which have arisen within the past 90 years. But there is not an equivalent selection of the largest single group interested in animal sciences; those planning to go into medicine. Consequently the so-called liberal arts colleges do not have a balanced sampling. The pre-medical students are a major pressure group, for whose benefit the curriculum has been increasingly modified. We now have colleges of pre-medicine, equivalent to colleges of agriculture, forestry schools, or teachers colleges. Liberal arts in any proper sense to many of them have ceased to be. As a measure and symptom of our time, the Graduate Record Examination is a faithful witness. As a gauge of the broad, impartial training which a liberal education is supposed to be, nothing could be falser. LLOYD H. SHINNERS, Director of Herbarium, Southern Methodist University, Dallas, Texas. One copy of each publication submitted for listing should be sent to the Editor, The AIBS Bulletin, 2000 P Street, N. W., Washington 6, D. C. Only books published within a year of receipt will be reviewed. ANIMAL SCIENCES Dragonflies of North America. JAMES G. NEEDHAM and MINTER J. WESTFALL, JR. 615 pgs., 341 fig. University of California Press, Berkeley 4, Calif. (1955) $12.50. Entomologists, expert and amateur alike, will find this an indispensable manual if they are interested in the Odonata. The book is designed primarily for the identification of dragonflies but it is more than that. Dragonfly nymphs, often neglected in the past, are discussed, keys supplied and illustrations provided. Practical methods and implements for collecting, preserving, and studying dragonflies are included. The range of species is given in terms of states, rather than in terms of life zones. Through- out the book the language used is simple and clear and common names are supplied whenever possible. The authors have man- aged to lend to what might have been a highly technical volume a real appreciation of these insects in their natural habitats. World Outside My Door. OLIVE BOWN GOIN. 184 pgs. The Macmillan Company, 60 Fifth Ave., New York 11, N.Y. (1955) $3.50. The author is the biologist wife of a biologist at the Univer- sity of Florida. In her backyard on a hammock area at the outskirts of Gainesville, Mrs. Goin began to keep a journal about the creatures she observed. Gradually her casual observa- tions became close observations and this charming book tells the story. Written in a style that will be enjoyed by everyone, the book should be particularly appealing to those living in similar southern regions with the same species. However, it should inspire possessors of "backyards" everywhere to watch more carefully for the fascinating array of animals and birds that can inhabit one small piece of territory. Attractive cartoon- type drawings by Esther Coogle illustrate in a casual fashion. Evolution of the Vertebrates. EDWIN H. COLBERT. 479 pgs., 122 illus. John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., 440 Fourth Ave., New York 16, N.Y. (1955) $8.95. Dr. Colbert is Curator of Fossil Reptiles and Amphibians at the American Museum of Natural History and Professor of Vertebrate Paleontology at Columbia University. The book is intended to be a general textbook on vertebrate paleontology; it is not meant for the specialist or the lay reader. The approach is via the fossil record. Principles of evolution are discussed or mentioned in passing but the book is not built around them. Neither is it concerned with the mechanisms of evolution as revealed by genetics. A feeling of the passing of geologic time is established by the author and maintained throughout. The text material is enhanced by a liberal supply of bone drawings, excellent restorations and phylogenies. The Mammalian Fetus: Physiological Aspects of Develop- ment. Cold Spring Harbor Symposia on Quantitative Bi- ology, Vol. 19. 225 pgs., 202 fig., 5 pl. The Biological Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, New York. (1955) $8.00 plus postage. The 19th annual Cold Spring Harbor Symposia, held June 7-14, 1954, brought together more than 125 American and European scientists to discuss the development and physiology of the mammalian fetus. The twenty-seven lectures presented by invited participants, and the discussions which followed them, are recorded in this volume. The meetings began with a consideration of early embryonic development, then took up a variety of integrated physiological activities necessary for the development of the fetus, and finally discussed the metabolic characteristics of the fetus as a whole and of its different parts. Bower Birds. A. J. MARSHALL. 208 pgs., 21 fig., 26 pI. Oxford University Press, 114 Fifth Avenue, New York 11, N.Y. (1954) $4.80. It has been known for over a century that the bower-birds, a family of passerines confined to Australia, New Guinea and nearby island, build display-grounds and decorate them in vari- ous fashions. Because of these extraordinary habits a large popular literature has grown up, much of it anthropomorphic, and most of it, according to Dr. Marshall, erroneous. Follow- ing a series of histo-physiological studies, and an examination of the ecology and literature of each species of bower-bird, the author writes that the display behavior is definitely connected with sexual reproduction, contrary to popular belief. The book is liberally illustrated and written in a style that should appeal to zoologists as well as ornithologists. Mosquitoes-Their Bionomics and Relation to Disease. WILLIAM R. HORSFALL. 723 pgs., 206 tables. The Ronald Press Company, 15 East 26th St., New York 10, N.Y. (1955) $16.00. Dr. Horsfall, Associate Professor of Entomology at the Uni- versity of Illinois, has provided research workers, sanitarians, epidemiologists, and ecologists with a complete summary of the bionomics of the subfamily of mosquitoes. General information on the subfamily as a whole and on each genus precedes the more detailed, systematic treatment of each species. Those con- cerned with the control of mosquitoes will find the most recent methods outlined for each species, as well as facts about toxinosis in the egg, larva, pupa, and adult stages. A full dis- cussion is given to the role played by mosquitoes in spreading malaria, yellow fever, and other diseases. As well as outlining A.I.B.S BULLETIN--April 1955 13</page><page sequence="2">the results of research to date, the book indicates avenues of investigation for tomorrow. The Vertebrate Body. A. S. ROMER. 644 pgs., illus. W. B. Saunders Company, West Washington Square, Phila- delphia 5, Pa. (Second edition, 1955) $7.00. The second edition of Dr. Romer's well-established text, The Vertebrate Body, contains some rearrangement, additions and textual changes. Essentially the book remains the same. As before the emphasis is not on the human body, a truly comparative approach is maintained, adequate illustrations given, the developmental viewpoint established, histological data sup- plied, and the unity of function and structure shown for all parts of the body. The Fossil Evidence for Human Evolution. W. E. LEGROS CLARK. 181 pgs., 20 fig. University of Chicago Press, 5750 Ellis Ave., Chicago 37, Ill. (1955) $6.00. The University of Chicago Press recently began publication of a new series known as "The Scientist's Library: Biology and Medicine." This small volume, whose author is Professor of Anatomy at Oxford, is one of the first biological contributions in the series. No attempt is made to provide an account of all the fossil evidence bearing on human evolution. Instead some of the main sources of evidence, in abbreviated form, and the conclusions that may be drawn from them, are discussed. Applied Entomology. H. T. FERNALD and H. H. SHEPARD. 385 pgs., 269 fig. McGraw-Hill Book Company, 330 West 42nd St., New York 36, N.Y. (5th edition, 1955) $7.00. The last (fourth) edition of this text appeared before the discovery of such insecticides as DDT. The section on control, therefore, has been brought up-to-date to include the newer chemicals, methods of application, precautions and government regulations of insecticides. Insect physiology has been empha- sized in this edition as well. It continues to be a text well adapted for agricultural and horticulture students, and those preparing to specialize in economic entomology. Mosquito Culture Techniques and Experimental Pro- cedures. Bulletin 3. HELEN TREMBLEY. 73 pgs., 17 fig. American Mosquito Control Association, c/o C. T. Williamson, Business Mgr., Suffolk County Mosq. Exterm. Co., Yaphank, L.I., N.Y. (1955). Available upon request. A neat, exact and well-illustrated Bulletin, Mosquito Culture Techniques should be a valuable addition to the laboratory of entomologists, malariologists and all others who raise mosquitoes for research purposes. The Mammals of the Huachuca Mountains, Southeastern Arizona. D. F. HOFFMEISTER and W. W. GOOD- PASTER. 152 pgs. University of Illinois Press, Urbana, Ill. (1954) $4.00 (cloth), $3.00 (paper). This is Volume XXIV, No. 1 of the Illinois Biological Mono- graphs. The Huachuca Mountains straddle the Mexican Boundary near the 110th parallel and form high, cool moun- tain ranges rising above low, hot deserts. A great diversity of life occurs in these mountains and this book tells the results of a survey of the mammals of the region. The Evolution and Taxonomy of the Sarcophaginae. SELWYN S. ROBACK. 181 pgs. University of Illinois Press, Urbana, Ill. (1954) $5.00 (cloth), $4.00 (paper). The subfamily Sarcophaginae, of the Sarcophagidae, or flesh- flies, contain about 1,200 species which vary greatly in size. Food habits vary from parasitism in humans to feeding on ? . _ dung and decaying vegetable material. The work on which this book is based is an attempt to discover the probable phylogeny and the genera and generic groupings in the subfamily, based primarily on aedeagal structure. 14 PLANT SCIENCES Small Fruit Culture. J. S. SHOEMAKER. 447 pgs., 75 illus. McGraw-Hill Book Company, 300 West 42nd St., New York 36, N.Y. (Third edition, 1955) $6.50. The small fruits discussed in this book are grapes, straw- berries, raspberries, blackberries and related types, currants, gooseberries, blueberries and cranberries. New features of this third edition include: improved cultural practices; newer va- rieties; up-to-date training methods for grapes, strawberries and bramble fruits; pruning; fertilizer practices; minor ele- ments; mulching; control of weeds by chemicals; French hybrid grapes; the development of virus-free strawberries; the im- portance of fall-bearing strawberries and raspberries and the use of chemicals to stop excessive runner formation in straw- berries. The book is well illustrated and written in a fashion that will make it easy to use as a reference handbook. An Introduction to Plant Taxonomy. GEORGE H. M. LAWRENCE. 179 pgs., 69 figs. The Macmillan Com- pany, 60 Fifth Avenue, New York 11, N.Y. (1955) $3.25. The author says in his preface "This book is written for the adult amateur botanist and the student of a local flora course at the college level". It is restricted to the vascular plants- ferns, gymnosperms, and flowering plants. Plant structures, contemporary systems of classification, fundamental principles of plant nomenclatures and the mechanics of plant identification, including preparation and preservation of herbarium specimens, are included. Illustrations are original and adequate. Handbook of Algae. HERMAN SILVA FOREST. 469 pgs., 698 fig. University of Tennessee Press, Knoxville 16, Tenn. (1954). This handbook was prepared primarily for use in Tennessee and the Southeastern States. It summarizes several "check- lists" published during recent years by phycologists of this region. A key to genera precedes the large section of the book devoted to more detailed description of each family and genus. Illustrations are line drawings. Fruit Nutrition. Edited by NORMAN F. CHILDERS. 907 pgs., illus. Horticultural Publication of Rutgers University, New Brunswick, N.J. (1954). The field of plant nutrients has been the subject of study for centuries, beginning with rice and tea in the Orient. In the Western World grain crops and fruit trees received the attention of scientists and the accumulated literature is over- whelming. This review volume attempts to sort out pertinent facts and present a proper perspective of the state of our knowledge. Over twenty authors have contributed chapters. Plant Analysis and Fertilizer Problems. Edited by P. PREVOT. A Symposium of the 8th International Botanical Congress, Paris, 1954. 263 pgs., illus. Published by I.R.H.O., 12 Square Petrarque, Paris 16, France. (1955) $4.00. This volume is the record of the first international symposium dealing with the fundamentals, techniques and applications of plant tissue analysis methods to problems of fertilization of plants. It is evidence of the growing body of literature on this subject, the increasing number of workers in the field and the value of this method of evaluation. Applications of plant analysis of such diverse crops as coconut, coffee, citrus, tung, grapes, deciduous fruits, wheat, sugar beet, sugar cane, oil palms, peanuts and others are considered. The informal dis- cussions and debates following the presentation of each paper are included. Botany, Principles and Problems. EDMUND W. SINNOTT and KATHERINE S. WILSON. 528 pgs., illus. McGraw- Hill Book Company, 330 West 42nd St., New York 36 N.Y. (5th edition, 1955) $6.75. Long a standard work, the fifth edition of the Sinnott and Wilson Botany is a handsome new production. The format has A-I.B.S BULLETIN--April 1955</page><page sequence="3">been changed to a larger page size, with double columns and over 200 new and excellent illustrations have been added. The contents have been rewritten to include modern developments in plant science, and several completely new chapters have been added. All revisions, however, maintain the approach to the subject that has kept this book in popular demand for over 25 years. Cryptogamic Botany. Vol. I. Algae and Fungi. Gilbert M. SMITH. 546 pgs., 311 fig. McGraw-Hill Book Company, 330 West 42nd St., New York 36, N.Y. (2nd edition, 1955) $8.50. The second edition of the well-known and widely-used Smith's Cryptogamic Botany provides a timely revision. As before one chapter is devoted to each phylum of plants. The introductory portion of each chapter has been rewritten and a wider selec- tion of representative genera described. The two volumes are designed for students who have had an introductory course in botany and wish to continue in morphology. Volume I covers algae and fungi. Cryptogamic Botany. Vol. II. Bryophytes and Pterido- phytes. GILBERT M. SMITH, 399 pgs., 254 fig. McGraw- Hill Book Company, 330 West 42nd St., New York 36, N.Y. (2nd edition, 1955) $8.00. Volume II, covering the bryophytes and pteridophytes, shows revisions of the discussions of the major taxa and a wider geographic distribution of the representative "types". MISCELLANEOUS The Harvey Lectures. (1953-54) 299 pgs. Academic Press Inc., 125 East 23rd St., New York 10, N.Y. (1955) $7.50. The now-famous Harvey Lectures are delivered annually under the auspices of The Harvey Society of New York and the patronage of the New York Academy of Science. Lecturers (and their subjects) for 1953-54 were: Claude Fromageot, The Metabolism of Sulfur and Its Relations to General Metabolism; Hans H. Weber, Adenosine Triphosphate and Motility of Living Systems; David Nachmansohn, Metabolism and Function of the Nerve Cell; Paul Klemperer, The Significance of the Inter- mediate Substances of the Connective Tissue in Human Disease; R. D. Hotchkiss, The Genetic Chemistry of the Pneumococcal Transformations; Britton Chance, Enzymes in Action in Living Cells: The Steady State of Reduced Nucleotides; A. L. Lehninger, Oxidative Phosphorylation; Linus Pauling, Ab- normality of Hemoglobin Molecules in Hereditary Hemolytic Anemias; and J. D. Hardy, Control of Heat Production in Physiologic Temperature Regulation. Genetic Homeostasis. I. MICHAEL LERNER. 134 pgs., 14 fig. John Wiley &amp; Sons, 440 Fourth Ave., New York 16, N.Y. (1954) $3.25. The author undertook the preparation of this volume while on a Guggenheim Foundation Fellowship at the Institute of Genetics (University of Pavia) and the Istituto Italiano di Idrobiologia (Pallanza). His essay proposes to demonstrate that "mendelian populations possess self-regulating properties, to establish a connexion between genetic and developmental homeostasis, to suggest that heterozygosity provides a basis for both phenomena, and to consider some consequences of these points for evolution and breeding". Dr. Lerner is Professor of Genetics in Poultry Science at the University of California. A Manual of Paper Chromatography and Paper Electro- phoresis. R. J. BLOCK, E. L. DURRUM and GUNTER ZWEIG. 484 pgs., illus. Academic Press Inc., 125 East 23rd St., New York 10, N.Y. (1955) $8.00. Two of the most recent analytical tools of the research bi- ologist, paper chromatography and paper electrophoresis, have greatly facilitated the qualitative and quantitative analyses of amino acids, proteins, and steroids. This volume reviews such research in terms of basic principles and methodology. Estab- lished techniques are re-evaluated and new procedures and ap- plications described. Sufficiently detailed to be used as a manual in the laboratory, this book should also enable the reader to discover the particular technique needed for his research prob- lem without recourse to an extensive search of the literature. Perspectives and Horizons in Microbiology. Edited by SELMAN A. WAKSMAN. 220 pgs. Rutgers University Press, New Brunswick, N.J. (1955) $3.50. This book is a collection of monographs delivered at the symposium arranged for the dedication of the Institute of Microbiology, Rutgers University on June 7, 1954. The chapters cover such aspects of the field as metapoietic integrations, gene- tics and microbiology, molds as metabolic models and pathways in biological nitrogen fixation by such eminent microbiologists as Andre Lwoff, J. Lederberg, J. Foster, Perry Willson and Selman Waksman. The book is not of value as a textbook but makes very interesting and informative supplemental reading. Recent Developments in Cell Physiology. J. A. KITCHING. 206 pgs., illus. Academic Press Inc., 125 East 23rd St., New York 10, N.Y. (1954) $6.50. Since 1948, the Colston Research Society at Bristol Univer- sity has been sponsoring annual symposia. This volume records the papers presented during the 1954 symposia, Recent De- velopment in Cell Physiology. Eighteen participants, from England, Denmark and Belgium, presented papers: J. F. Danielli, H. J. Koch, H. H. Ussing, R. D. Keynes, E. W. Yemm, H. Klenow, E. Hoff-J0rgensen, J. Brachet, C. H. Waddington, H. V. Br0ndsted, E. Zeuthen and 0. Scherbaum, 0. Maaloe and K. G. Lark, M. Westergaard and H. Hirsch, M. M. Swann, and J. A. Kitching. Discussions that followed the presentation of each paper and extensive bibliographies are included. Analysis of Development. Edited by BENJAMIN H. WIL- LIER, PAUL A. WEISS and VIKTOR HAMBURGER. 735 pgs., 248 fig. W. B. Saunders, West Washington Square, Philadelphia 5, Pa. (1955) $15.00. The rapidly accelerating trend to move from descriptive re- porting to analysis of dynamic and causal aspects of embryo- genesis has created an acute need, now admirably met by this well-written, judiciously balanced, forward-looking volume, for an up-to-date synthesis of contemporary knowledge in the field, for a level of discussion intermediate between the elementary textbooks and the rising spate of special symposia and reports. Twenty-eight distinguished biologists contributed independently prepared chapters covering every major topic in development of vertebrates and invertebrates. The book indicates where our knowledge of the principles and mechanisms of animal ontogeny now stands, what problems await clarification, explora- tion or initial attack and what guidance existing theories can give to research. The Structural Chemistry of Proteins. H. D. SPRINGALL. 376 pgs., illus. Academic Press Inc., 125 East 23rd St., New York 10, N.Y. (1954) $6.80. The usual methods of discussing the chemical or physico- chemical properties of proteins are abandoned in this book to be replaced by an up-to-date survey of their structural chemistry. Dr. Springall based the book on a course of lectures delivered at the University of Manchester to honors and post-graduate chemistry students. Besides advanced chemistry students, the subject should appeal to industrial and academic research work. ers and those interested in the chemistry of biological systems. Cellular Metabolism and Infections. Edited by E. RACKER. 196 pgs. Academic Press Inc., 125 East 23rd St., New York 10, N.Y. (1954) $4.80. The contents of this book are the papers presented during the 8th Symposium of the Section on Microbiology of the New York Academy of Medicine. Divided into two parts, one on comparative biochemistry, the second on the metabolic aspects of the infectious process itself, papers are provided by the A.I.B.S BULLETIN--April 1955 15</page><page sequence="4">following speakers: R. Y. Stanier, Ernest Bueding, H. A. Krebs, W. E. Knox, Arnold D. Welch, Bernard D. Davis, Seymour S. Cohen, Rene J. Dubos, A. M. Pappenheimer, Jr., Mark H. Adams, S. E. Luria, E. Racker, D. W. Wooley, Hubert Bloch, Benjamin Mandel, J. W. Beard, Gifford B. Pinchot and A. Lwoff. The Elements of Probability Theory and Some of Its Applications. HARALD CRAMER. 281 pgs. John Wiley &amp; Sons, 440 Fourth Ave., New York 16, N.Y. (1955) $7.00. The author is one of Sweden's foremost mathematical statis- ticians and is well known in the United States, holding an honorary D.Sc. from Princeton University. The book calls for a minimum of background knowledge and training. Part I covers the foundations, with definitions, rules and basic appli- cations. Part II treats random variables and probability distri- butions. Part III is a discussion of applications. This last section should be of particular interest to biologists, engineers and others who wish to apply statistical methods to their re- search. Graded exercises and problems are included. Active Transport and Secretion. Symposia of the Society for Experimental Biology. No. VIII. Edited by R. BROWN and J. F. DANIELLI. 516 pgs. Academic Press Inc., 125 East 23rd St., New York 10, N.Y. (1955) $8.00. Active Transport and Secretion was the subject of the 8th Symposium of the Society for Experimental Biology, held in Bangor, July 1953. The first three papers are introductory; the next four are on active transport phenomena in red blood cells, yeast and bacteria; a group of five papers are concerned with active transport of ions in plants; four discuss transport of ions in animal cells; and the remaining three papers are concerned with active movements of proteins and fats. Authors include: J. A. Ramsay, H. Davson, T. Rosenberg, J. R. Robin- son, J. A. Kitching, D. C. Spanner, J. W. L. Beament, P. G. Lefevre, W. Wilbrandt, W. F. Widdas, A. Rothstein, M. Maizels, E. J. Harris, E. F. Gale, P. Mitchell, H. Lundegardh, E. J. Con- way, J. F. Sutcliffe, R. S. Russell, F. C. Steward and F. K. Millar, H. Ussing, A. L. Hodgkin and R. D. Keynes, H. B. Steinbach, R. E. Davies, F. W. R. Brambell and W. A. Hem- mings, A. C. Frazer, and J. F. Danielli. Genetics and Human Heredity. J. BEN HILL and HELEN D. HILL. 526 pgs., 202 fig. McGraw-Hill Book Company, 330 West 42nd St., New York 36, N.Y. (1955) $6.50. The title of this book is somewhat misleading since only a small portion of the subject matter is devoted to human heredity. The book is designed essentially for either liberal arts or agricultural students. The material is standard for any introductory genetics course. Illustrations are numerous and a considerable number of problems are given at the conclusion of each chapter. The Chemistry of Lipids of Biochemical Significance. J. A. LOVERN. 132 pgs. John Wiley &amp; Sons, 440 Fourth Ave., New York 16, N.Y. (1955) $1.75. One of the Methuen Monographs in science, this book owes its origin and plan to a series of lectures delivered by the author at the University of Aberdeen in 1952. Chapters include: Struc- ture of Lipids, Preparation and Analysis of Lipids, Lipids in the Tissues, the Dynamic State of Lipids in the Tissues, and The Function of Lipids. The Human Organism. RUSSELL M. DE COURSEY. 550 pgs., illus. McGraw-Hill Book Company, 330 West 42nd St., New York 36, N.Y. (1955) $5.75. Dr. De Coursey's book is designed specifically for the liberal arts student. The common medico-nursing slant is abandoned, with an emphasis on physiology replacing it. Anatomy is kept at a minimum. The latest advances in Rh factor, hormone physiology, artificial kidneys, adrenocortical hormone relation to arthritis and B12 treatment of pernicious anemia are dis- cussed. The author writes in his preface, "the college student merges into the general public, where there is a great need for understanding human problems. Parents certainly need to know the fundamental principles of body structure and function which lead to an understanding of health and hygiene." Conserving Natural Resources. Principles and Practice in a Democracy. SHIRLEY W. ALLEN. 347 pgs., 169 fig. McGraw-Hill Book Co., 330 West 42nd St., New York 36, N.Y. (1955) $5.50. All aspects of the field of natural resources-physical, techni- cal, legal, political, economic, social and human-are covered in this compact volume. In his preface the author states: "An earnest attempt has been made to keep always in mind three essentials of a sound conservation program: use with minimum waste, increasing productivity where possible and desirable, and seeing to it that natural resources are equitably distributed now and hereafter". Modern methods and techniques, the relation to natural resources of such modern phenomena as smog and synthetics, the competition between industry, transportation, resi- dence, and testing agencies for land, the role of government in conservation and the success and failures of important conserva- tion laws are all discussed. Outlines of Enzyme Chemistry. J. B. NEILANDS and PAUL K. STUMPF. 315 pgs., illus. John Wiley &amp; Sons, 440 Fourth Ave., New York 16, N.Y. (1955) $6.50. Both authors of this book teach in Biochemistry Departments at the University of California, Berkeley. Their text is written for beginners and non-specialists in the field. Part I includes such topics as the history of enzyme chemistry, equilibria and ionization, isolation, purity criteria, and characterization meth- ods. The physical chemistry of enzymes is treated in Part II. Part III concentrates on specific coenzymes, enzymes, and enzyme systems. Metabolic problems and enzyme synthesis are discussed in Part IV. Advances in Virus Research. Volume II. Edited by K. M. SMITH and M. A. LAUFFER. 313 pgs. Academic Press Inc., 125 East 23rd St., New York 10, N.Y. (1954) $7.00. The second volume of Advances in Virus Research contains review articles on plant viruses, viruses causing diseases of ani- mals and man, chemical constitution of viruses, and the bio- physical aspects of virus research. Authors include: W. W. Ackerman, F. C. Bawden, I. J. Bendet, T. Francis, Jr., F. 0. Holmes, C. A. Knight, M. A. Lauffer, P. von Magnus, E. Pollard, and R. C. Williams. Volume I and Volume II together now form a comprehensive, balanced introduction to the latest achievements in this field. Vitamins and Hormones. Advances in Research and Ap- plications. Volume XII. Edited by R. S. HARRIS, G. F. MARRIAN and K. V. THIMANN. 305 pgs. Academic Press Inc., 125 East 23rd St., New York 10, N.Y. (1954) $7.50. Thirteen authors have contributed to this XIIth volume of the Academic Press series on Vitamins and Hormones. Subjects discussed include: Chemistry of Vitamin B12; The Intestinal Synthesis of Vitamins in the Ruminant; The Biochemistry and Pathology of Hypervitaminosis A; Vitamin A Requirements of Animal Species; Disturbances in Nutrition Relating to Liver Disease in Man; Light Regulation of Hormone Secretion; Estro- gens and Related Substances in Plants; and Effects of Estrogens on Domestic Fowl and Applications in the Poultry Industry. Each article, as usual, contains a complete bibliography of recent literature. Applied X-Rays. GEORGE L. CLARK. 843 pgs., 415 fig., McGraw-Hill Book Company, 330 West 42nd St., New York 36, N.Y. (Fourth edition, 1955) $12.50. This is the fourth edition of an established, comprehensive volume on X-ray science. Included is history, instrumentation, engineering, physics, chemical effects, biology, medicine, crystal- lography, and structures and textures of materials. Most of the four hundred photographs and diagrams have not been pre- viously published. Of particular interest to biologists is a new chapter dealing with the biological effects of X-rays based on the latest literature in radiology. A.I.B.S BULLETIN-April 1955 16</page><page sequence="5">Radiation Biology. Volume II. Ultraviolet and Related Radia- tions. Edited by ALEXANDER HOLLAENDER. 593 pgs., illus. McGraw-Hill Book Company, 330 West 42nd St., New York 36, N.Y. (1955) $8.00. Volume II in this three-volume series deals with ultraviolet and related radiations. The book should prove of special in- terest to investigators in food preservations, industrial applica- tions of ultraviolet in general, health aspects of ultraviolet, and the use of ultraviolet as an analytical tool. As in Volume I the material covers the effects of radiation from the physical, chemical and biological points of view, with special emphasis on the cytological and genetical aspects of radiation damage. Sonics. T. F. HUETER and R. H. BOLT. 456 pgs., illus. John Wiley &amp; Sons, 440 Fourth Ave., New York 16, N.Y. (1955) $10.00. New uses of sound waves in engineering and science are constantly being discovered. A practical presentation of this rapidly expanding field, from audible sounds to ultrasonics, is offered in Sonics. A background of basic physics is necessary and certainly physicists, chemists or engineers will find the book of more value than will biologists. Major emphasis is placed on the techniques and instrumentation for actual tasks in in- dustry with the applications divided into two branches: sonic processing and sonic analysis. Amino Acid Metabolism. Edited by W. D. McELROY and H. B. GLASS. 1048 pgs., illus. The Johns Hopkins Press, Homewood, Baltimore 18, Md. (1955) $12.50. This volume contains the papers and discussions presented at a Symposium on Amino Acid Metabolism held at the Johns Hopkins University under the sponsorship of the McCollum- Pratt Institute on June 14-17, 1954. Contents are divided into the following sections: General Consideration of Amino Acid Metabolism; Metabolism of Glutamic Acid, Proline, Ornithine, Citrulline and Arinine; Metabolism of Histidine, Leucine, Iso- leucine, Caline and Lysine; Metabolism of Methionine, Cysteine and Threonine; Metabolism of Glycine and Serine and Metabolism of Aromatic Amino Acids. Cells and Societies. JOHN T. BONNER. 234 pgs., 46 fig. Princeton University Press, Princeton, N.J. (1955) $4.50. Cells and Societies is a fascinating discussion of the charac- teristics and variations of animal societies from the howling monkeys of Barro Colorado Island to colonial and single-celled organisms. Three biological activities occur throughout: the need to take in food, perpetuation by reproduction, and some method of coordinating the group. Dr. Bonner compares various societies in terms of these three factors. The book should be enjoyed by biologists and layman alike for it is written in an eminently readable fashion. Serological Approaches to Studies of Protein Structure and Metabolism. Edited by WILLIAM H. COLE. 97 pp. Rutgers University Press, New Brunswick, N.J. (1954). This booklet offers the six papers presented during the Tenth Annual Conference of the Bureau of Biological Research at Rutgers. Subjects and authors are: Proteins as Antigens and Antibodies, Felix Haurowitz; The Precipitin Reaction and Studies of Native and Denatured Proteins and Derivatives, M. Heidelberger; Light Scattering and Ultracentrifugation Methods in Studies of Precipitin Systems and Their Application to Human Metabolism, David Gitlin; The Immunological Analysis of the Biosynthesis of a Protein, Melvin Cohn; The Use and Limitations of Serum-Agar Techniques in Studies of Proteins, J. Munoz; and The Measurement and Significance of Seriological Correspondence Among Proteins, Alan A. Boyden. The Chemistry of Living Cells. HELEN R. DOWNES. 549 pgs. Harper and Brothers, 49 East 33rd St., New York 16, N.Y. (1955) $7.50. The author, Professor of Chemistry at Barnard College, has prepared a biochemistry text that answers a need in empha- sizing the general chemical processes common to all living cells. It can, therefore, be used by botanists and zoologists alike. Part I is introductory; Part II covers the chemistry of carbohydrates, fats, proteins and related compounds and enzyme processes; Part III is devoted to cell metabolism with a full discussion of the oxidative and synthetic mechanisms in various types of cells. An introductory chapter on the history and literature of biochemistry should be of particular interest to teachers. Standard Values in Nutrition and Metabolism. Edited by ERRETT C. ALBRITTON. 380 pgs., 160 tables. W. B. Saunders Company, West Washington Square, Philadelphia 5, Pa. (1954) $6.50. This is the second fascicle of a Handbook of Biological Data being prepared under the auspices of the AIBS and the Na- tional Research Council. Hundreds of specialists have been drawn upon for data and advice and every table has been checked several times by such authorities. Subjects include: Nutrients; nutrients utilized by animal forms, by plant forms; daily nutrient allowance; diets and culture media for animal forms, for plant forms; nutrient and energy value of foodstuffs and feedstuffs; signs of deficiency and excess; pathways of metabolism; end products of metabolism; 02 production in animals, in plants; and energy exchange. Textbook of Physiology. Edited by JOHN F. FULTON. 1275 pgs., 600 illus. W. B. Saunders Company, West Washington Square, Philadelphia 5, Pa. (17th edition, 1955) $13.50. For fifty years this text has been a standard in many medical schools and physiology departments. Several of the thirty con- tributors have revised their chapters for this 17th edition; other sections, such as those on body fluids, kidney function and respiration have been completely rewritten. A new chapter on actylcholine and energy transformations in nerve cells has been added. Marketing of Agricultural Products. RICHARD L. KOHLS. 399 pgs. The Macmillan Company, 60 Fifth Avenue, New York 11, N.Y. (1955) $5.25. Biologists other than agriculturalists should find this book interesting extracurricular reading. The style is informative and the contents comprehensive. The approach is a mixed one-partly functional, partly institutional, and partly by com- modities. For students, the author believes the subject should be presented in the framework of the familiar-hogs, milk, the retail store and so on. Hence, his mixed approach is intended to both make the subject "more palatable" and enhance the learning process. Climatic Atlas of the United States. STEPHEN S. VISHER. 403 pgs., 1031 fig. Harvard University Press, Cambridge, Mass. (1954) $9.00. This volume is the first book since 1941 on climates of the U.S. and the first attempt since 1921 to assemble under one cover the available maps on the climates of this country. The 1031 maps and diagrams are presented in 34 chapters grouped into seven parts. Five sections embrace the major elements of climate: temperature, wind, sunshine, humidity and precipita- tion, and the other two, some consequences of climate and weather, and climatic regions and climatic changes for more than 100 years. The author is Professor of Geography at Indiana University. LABORATORY MANUALS Laboratory Exercises in the Plant Kingdom. PAUL C. LEMON and N. H. RUSSELL. 121 pgs. Wm. C. Brown Company, Dubuque, Iowa. (1954) $2.50. Laboratory Explorations in General Zoology. KARL A. STILES. 291 pgs. The Macmillan Company, 60 Fifth Avenue, New York 11, N.Y. (3rd edition, 1955) $3.75.
