This is due to the first identification of Minoan antiquities on Kythera by Sylvia Benton in 1931-2,2 to the 1957-8 survey undertaken by Helen Waterhouse and Richard Hope Simpson,3 but mostly to the excavations of 1963-5 made by Nicolas Coldstream and George Huxley, along with their ensuing publication.4 At a conference held in Athens in 19845 the identification of the Minoan colony at Kastri remained beyond doubt despite the continuing debate over the reality or otherwise of a Minoan thalassocracy.6 The identification was accepted even though, with the exception of a few rhytons,7 finds that helped to certify 1 This article is based on a communication given on 16 Apr. 1994 at Oxford during the symposium 'Crete and the Aegean World in the Bronze Age: Invasions, Migrations and Influences', in honour ofM.

I), Dr Efi Sapouna-Sakellaraki and I visited the site of Agios Georgios on Vouno (henceforth Agios Georgios) (PLATE Io a) and at first glance established that here, on a mountain some 350 m high, was the site of the peak sanctuary of the Minoan settlement of Kastri, which lay some 4 km away. As a site, Agios Georgios is associated with Kastri in all those aspects which characterize peak sanctuaries: accessibility, proximity, general prominence, and visibilityl0--all those aspects typical of peak sanctuaries established by research only in the I950s and Ig60s.ll This relatively recent development in Minoan sanctuary research explains why the excavators of the Minoan colony on Kythera never thought to investigate Agios Georgios in the I960s, even though they were working nearby. The published report, however, does mention that certain members of the team visited the site.12 Investigation of the first Minoan peak sanctuary outside Crete constituted a substantial archaeological challenge, not least in view of the important surface finds encountered there. Furthermore, the site concerned was not only located in the Aegean but also hard by the Peloponnese--or Lakonia, to be more precise. I do not wish here to deal with the excavations at Agios Georgios, which lasted from 1992 to I994. Instead, this paper will deal with their results, which I consider important for the question of Minoan religious influence in the Aegean. The relevant finds are presented below only in brief. Many objects were collected during a surface survey, and the highest point on the mountain peak was excavated. Long trenches were dug along both a north-south and an east-west axis on the slopes of the south plateau on the side of the mountain overlooking Minoan Kastri (PLATE 10 a). Of particular interest was an undisturbed LM I layer on the peak as well as rich layers--mostly of pottery- lower down on the southern plateaux. THE FINDS The finds are exceptionally interesting and come from Minoan and later periods (indeed, religious devotions continue to be practised here to the present day). Mention will be made here of some of the Minoan finds. Structural remains from the second millennium BC did not come to light, although these may have been obliterated by later building activity. In the undisturbed LM I layer, however, many pieces of mortar were found and these may possibly be associated with wall plaster like that found at Minoan peak sanctuaries.13 The movable finds are abundant, mostly in the form of the votive offerings typical of Minoan peak sanctuaries. Of all the objects found, perhaps the most important is a fully preserved black steatite ladle (PLATE Io b),14 just like those found at Cretan peak sanctuaries.15 An example from Troullos at 10 A. A.

SAKELLARAKIS Archanes bears a Linear A inscription carved on the lip.16 We find a similar inscription on the Agios Georgios ladle--the first Minoan inscription found on Kythera.'7 Furthermore, the inscription (da-ma-te) is reminiscent of Demeter, a resemblence that has been discussed by the present author and J.-P. Olivier.'8 Other ladles from Agios Georgios include an exquisite example made of Spartan basalt. Among the stone vessels was a fragment of a rectangular libation table (PLATE Io c) exactly like those found at Minoan peak sanctuaries.19 A clay libation table (PLATE II b) seems to imitate the decoration and burnishing of its stone counterparts, while another cylindrical one (PLATE II a) finds exact parallels from the peak sanctuaries.20 Part of a stone lamp was also found (PLATE II d). Perhaps the most typical objects found at Minoan peak sanctuaries are figurines, usually made of clay and more rarely of bronze. At Agios Georgios only a few anthropomorphic clay figurines came to light: a torso (PLATE II c), a head with headband (PLATE 12 a), and fragments of smaller and larger figurines (PLATE 12 c), all with Cretan peak sanctuary parallels.21 Even a few clay animal figurines were found (PLATE 12 b)22 and a bird figurine (PLATE 12 d), likewise with Cretan parallels.23 Particularly interesting is the head of a large bull figurine (PLATE 13 a), once again with parallels from peak sanctuaries in Crete.24 The bronze figurine of a scorpion (PLATE 13 b), already studied in depth,25 constitutes one of the most interesting finds from Agios Georgios. Bronze animal figurines, however, have not as yet been found at Minoan peak sanctuaries in Crete,26 despite the fact that the scorpion is a familiar motif on ivory seals,27 in certain three-sided prisms,28 and on the so-called talismanic seals found in Crete.29 The apotropaic use of the motif in Crete is substantiated by its presence on two amulets30 as well as by its depiction on the stone handle of a dagger or staff.3' Both in 16 S.

The scorpion in Cretan myth is associated with Orion, but also with Minos' acts of procreation.34 Consequently, the creature may very well have had an associated meaning in Minoan Crete. Indeed, after the discovery of the bronze scorpion four clay examples (one is shown in PLATE 13 c) could be identified at Agios Georgios. Study of the many votive offerings from Minoan peak sanctuaries may lead to the identification of more votive scorpions. The bronze adorant figurines total 83, but even though many of these are fragmentary (PLATE 13 d), they are of special interest. Their number alone is exceptional, not only for a Minoan peak sanctuary. To date only 18 bronze figurines have come to light at four of the most important Cretan peak sanctuaries: 6 at Jouchtas, 5 each at Traostalos and Kophinas, and 2 at Vrysinas.35 E. Sakellaraki's recent monograph on bronze anthropomorphic figurines in Crete and the Aegean lists a total of 170 known to date, mostly now in the Herakleion Museum and in foreign and private collections.36 The anthropomorphic bronze figurines from Agios Georgios, male and female, vary in height from 0.0228 m to 0.188 m (PLATE 14 a). Matters of typology, plastic rendition (PLATE 14 b), and Minoan workshop attribution have been examined by E. Sakellaraki.37 Only a few figurines will be presented here to underscore the variety among them, chiefly through the gestures depicted. The majority of the adorant figurines are of the most common type with the right hand raised to the forehead, both in male (PLATES 13 d-I4 a, 14 c-d) and-more rarely-in female versions (PLATE 15 a-b). There exist many Minoan parallels,38 but also many variants. In one of these the figure holds his hand in front of his chest (PLATE 15 c), a gesture with Minoan parallels. Other gestures are also known from Minoan examples: both hands on the breast on a female figurine (PLATE 15 d)39 or crossed in a male version (PLATE 16 a).40 One female figurine holds both hands to her head (PLATE 16 b), as does a male figurine (PLATE 16 c). Both have Minoan parallels.41 Also of exceptional interest are a few bronze votive offerings in the shape of human limbs. Till now, only clay parallels have been known from the Minoan peak sanctuaries.42 One of the bronze items is a cut-out depicting the lower part of a male torso (PLATE 16 d). Minoan clay parallels are quite well known,43 and some--like the Agios Georgios example--have 32 E.

Two other cut-out examples (PLATE 17 b) have an aperture at the top, just as in the clay Minoan examples.47 A bronze votive hand (PLATE 17 c) also finds exact parallels in clay examples from Minoan peak sanctuaries,48 some of which have the fingers spread wide49 and a bracelet painted around the wrist. In the Agios Georgios example the bracelet is plastic.50 Other significant bronze votive offerings from Agios Georgios include a very rare cut-out of a man (PLATE 17 d) and another larger one of a woman (PLATE I8 a), which has a Cretan parallel.51 There is also a group of votive weapons, a knife (PLATE I8 b), and various blade cut-outs (PLATE I8 d), all of which have been found at the Cretan peak sanctuaries.52 The jewellery found included a few gold finds (PLATE I8 c) and some beads made of faience, rock crystal, sard, and agate (PLATE 19 a), four of which were found in the undisturbed LM I layer and thus probably belonged to the same necklace, once again with various parallels from Cretan peak sanctuaries.53 Even an apparently unimportant tiny clay ball also has parallels in the Minoan peak sanctuaries.54 Two more finds are exceptionally important for Minoan cult practice: miniature clay pairs of horns of consecration that had once been attached to vessels (PLATE 19 b-c)55 and a small bronze votive double axe (PLATE 19 d), the prime symbol of Minoan Crete.56 44 e.g. Petsofas, 92, nos. 6, II, pl. 43. 5-7. 5 e.g. Platon (n.

A bronze cut-out head with suspension hole from the cave of Phaneromeni must also be Minoan: HM 2967 (S. Marinatos, 'Ausgrabungen und Funde auf Kreta 1936-7', AA (1937), 223; A.

These four examples, to which must now be added the cut-out section of the lower part of the male torso and the cut-out feet from Kythera mentioned above, indicate that the cut-out technique was not unknown in the Minoan period. Thus it is possible, despite the opposition raised by A. Lembesi, that two cut-outs from the Psychro Cave are Minoan and not Geometric. These are (I) in the shape of a human figure: HM 2002, J.

The shapes are typical for Minoan peak sanctuaries and also help establish the period during which the sanctuary operated. Sherds from the MM I B-MM II period occur sporadically. Ceramic votive offerings from this period appear to have been of high quality, to judge by a sherd from the lip of a cup to which a clay oyster-shell moulding had been attached (PLATE 20 b). It is possible that clay appliques of a nautilus argonaut and a fish (only the tail has survived) also belonged to this vessel. The significance of this votive cup, manufactured in the ornate barnacle style,57 lies in its use of motifs associated with the sea, examples of which have been found even in inland Cretan peak sanctuaries.58 The MM III-LM I pottery, on the other hand, is exceptionally rich, and not only in the diversity of shapes. Of these, the most common is the conical cup (PLATE 20 a), and this of course applies to the Cretan peak sanctuaries as well.59" Cult practice also used incense- burners.60 Many came to light at Agios Georgios, together with many tripod cooking pots (PLATE 20 c).61 Even small jugs are common (PLATE 20 d), once again with parallels at Cretan peak sanctuaries.62 A few sherds were also found from pithoi that may have once contained offerings.63 In contrast to the many Cretan peak sanctuaries, where the presence of fine ware appears to have been exceptionally rare, the Agios Georgios peak sanctuary produced many examples of fine ceramic work (PLATES 21 a-22 c). In this respect, the Agios Georgios peak sanctuary can be associated with that on Jouchtas. The most characteristic Minoan vessel used in cult practice, particularly at peak sanctuaries, was the rhyton.64 At Agios Georgios an intact miniature example decorated with lilies was found (PLATE 22 d) together with fragments of others (PLATE 23 a). In general, most of the vessels are small and open. The closed vessels are mostly medium-sized, ranging from amphoras to jugs. The cups are many and varied: spherical and cylindrical with typical bases. Open bowls (PLATE 23 b), dishes, and fruit-bowls are also in evidence. Many cups are monochrome or decorated, some painted both inside and out. A miniature cup found intact is decorated with running spirals (PLATE 23 c). The great amount of MM III-LM I/LM I B pottery, compatible with the date of the Kastri colony,65 suggests that the acme of cult devotions at Agios Georgios 57 Evans, PM iv. IoI;J. C.

SAKELLARAKIS occurred during this period. Cult activity, however, did not terminate even though the LM II finds are very sparse, as are later Mycenaean ones. As noted above, finds exist from much later Greek and even Christian times. INTERPRETATION The very presence of typical pottery at Agios Georgios leaves no doubt that this was the peak sanctuary of the Minoan colony at Kastri. However, the wealth of the finds-which apart from the pottery is not to be found at Kastri-suggests that the colony's importance is much greater than has been supposed up till now on the basis of the limited excavation trenches opened in the I960s.66 I shall not dwell on this matter here. Instead I should like to concentrate on religion. There is no doubt that the sanctuary on Kythera is a Minoan peak sanctuary. Both its location and the context in which the offerings were made (many were found together with animal bones), together with the nature of the votive offerings themselves, point to a purely Minoan cult venue. There exist, however, certain idiosyncrasies which I should like to touch upon briefly. It should be stressed that a variety of peculiarities appear in all the Cretan peak sanctuaries.67 The architectural structures at Jouchtas are unique and cannot be compared to the humble buildings found at other peak sanctuaries.68 At Petsofas69 the insect copris hispanus is usually found in clay votive offerings but is extremely rare at other peak sanctuaries;70 it is characteristically absent from Jouchtas.71 The recently excavated peak sanctuary at Atsipades is unique for the phalluses found there.72 These are rare not only for peak sanctuaries but for Minoan Crete in general. In the 1950s scholars such as M. Nilsson, N. Platon, and B. C. Dietrich considered the absence of bronze finds a common attribute of the peak sanctuary,73 but later excavations proved them wrong. At the peak sanctuary of Agios Georgios the unique wealth of bronze finds constitutes a peculiarity not encountered at any metropolitan Minoan peak sanctuary, not even atJouchtas, Kofinas, or Traostalos, the peak sanctuaries of centres such as Knossos, Archanes, Phaistos, or Zakros. Also noteworthy is the absence in Kythera of the large numbers of terracotta figurines common at all of the other peak sanctuaries. It appears that at Agios Georgios the proportion of bronze to clay votive offerings is reversed: the bronze votive offerings found at the metropolitan peak sanctuaries are as rare as the clay ones at Agios Georgios. Even more interesting at Agios Georgios is the scarcity of certain votive offerings that are commonly found at Minoan peak sanctuaries in Crete, such as animal figurines74 or the representations of fruit found at some sanctuaries.75 66 Ibid. 309. 67 O.

The presence at Minoan peak sanctuaries in Crete of a large number of figurines of animals-cattle, sheep, goats, pigs, dogs, and even weasels-of insects, and of fruit has, I think correctly, been interpreted as exemplifying the needs of cult practice in an economy based on agriculture and animal husbandry.76 Furthermore, the popular nature of cult practice77 at the Cretan peak sanctuaries is evident from the cheap nature of the material (viz. clay) used for the many votive offerings. The Minoan colonists in Kythera evidently had no need of more land for cultivation or grazing. The few loom-weights found at Agios Georgios (PLATE 23 d), paralleled at other Minoan sanctuaries,78 naturally suggest weaving activity but not necessarily the weaving of wool. Linen might well have been the material manufactured here.79 The similar loom- weights that came to light at Kastri8o are not enough to establish intense fabric production in the colony, beyond sufficient, perhaps, to cover its basic needs.8' Other economic factors, therefore, must be sought to explain the acme of the Minoan colony at Kastri, reflected in the votive offerings at Agios Georgios. The venerants at the peak sanctuary were not simple shepherds. The offerings depicting the faithful or even their ailing limbs82 are, for the first time at a peak sanctuary, made of bronze. They would appear to belong to a wealthier group-traders or sailors, perhaps83-as the finds discussed below suggest. It is certainly possible that the presence of murex shells on Kythera, which gave it the name Porphyroussa,84 led the Minoan colonists to exploit it for the production of purple dye. What is evident from the finds at Kastri85 is also reflected in the murex shells from Agios Georgios 76 B.

In the I7th cent. travellers found sheep they wanted to buy intolerably expensive: M. K. Petrocheilos, Evrva&gt;rdetg awro ra KOyrlpa (Kv6iptaxiil pLBloOlilxT, 4; Athens, 1979), 9, 11-12, 16-17. From 1728 to 1733 the wealthy families on Kythera owned 16,540 sheep, on an island of about five thousand inhabitants: Ch. Maltezou, Cythire: sociiti et iconomie pendant la piriode de la domination vinitienne (Balkan Studies, 21; 1980). The older inhabitants of the island do not remember animal husbandry on the island on a large scale, beyond what was necessary for immediate family needs. 82 On the interpretation of votive human limbs at peak sanctuaries see Platon (n.

It may be, however, that murex shells alone do not fully explain the acme of the Minoan colony. More significant, perhaps, is the exploitation of the wealth of neighbouring Lakonia and, of course, the wider strategic context of controlling the sea routes. It has already been suggested86 that the Minoan colony on Kythera owes its acme to its exploitation of what may be the most important metallurgical deposits on mainland Greece for the production of bronze, lead, silver and even gold-those of Lakonia.87 Despite the absence of important metal objects among the finds from Kythera88 from the period before the excavations at Agios Georgios, it had been reasonably suggested89 that 'the people of Kastri were not unacquainted with metal luxuries'.90 This adds significance to the presence of so many bronze objects at Agios Georgios, including even gold items, though analysis still has to be carried out to determine whether the metal used is in fact Lakonian. Interestingly, unworked pieces of bronze in the form of ingot fragments were also found at Agios Georgios (PLATE 24 b). Kythera's vicinity to the Lakonian quarries is also noteworthy. The importation of Spartan basalt to Crete is certified by Knossian finds,91 and unused pieces of Spartan basalt also came to light at Agios Georgios (PLATE 24 c). Another Lakonian stone, porphyry, was used even in Minoan Crete;92 many unworked pieces of this mineral also came to light at Agios Georgios (PLATE 24 d).93 The finds at Agios Georgios of so many unworked pieces of Spartan basalt and porphyry, as well as of ingots and bronze casting residue, may indicate that the figurines were manufactured in workshops on site. Association of workshops with sanctuaries is not unknown and certainly cannot be ruled out a priori. Similar finds may come to light in the other- robbed-metropolitan peak sanctuaries on Crete94 that have yet to be published.95 Indeed it may very well be the case that these raw materials were meant in themselves to be votive 86 Stos-Gale and Gale (n. 6), 61, fig. 5, 63; Rutter and Zerner (n. 6), 79; Rutter in Thalassocracy, 1I3.

At Agios Georgios, however, nothing other than the materials themselves was found to suggest on-site production of various votive offerings. The Minoan colony on Kythera at Kastri also had a wider strategic role in controlling the sea trade routes. For this reason research associated with this subject was not confined to the mainland but was undertaken in co-operation with the Institute of Underwater Archaeology in an attempt to locate Minoan shipwrecks along the coast.96 Is it not significant that the location of the peak sanctuary at Agios Georgios overlooks all the passages from east to west97 and from north to south? On a clear day one can see Kavo-Malias and Taygetos, and a large part of the south-west Aegean up to Crete. Visible on a clear day from Agios Georgios are not only Antikythera and the White Mountains of Crete, but even Psiloreitis. The sea view from a peak sanctuary need not be a coincidental factor for cult activity. After all, the most important peak sanctuary of Crete, Jouchtas in the centre of the north Aegean side of the island, also controls a substantial view of the sea. This fact was noted by the shrine's first excavator, Sir Arthur Evans,98 and is perfectly obvious today to anyone travelling by sea to Herakleion. Independent observations of this sort have been made by all scholars of other Cretan peak sanctuaries which, like Agios Georgios, adjoin coastal installations, e.g. Petsofas and Traostalos in east Crete.99 Naturally, the same applies to Kofinas for anyone sailing along the south coast of Crete. This visibility is also apparent in a unique depiction of an Aegean peak sanctuary, discussed below, and even in another peak sanctuary in the Aegean whose excavator regarded it as a lookout post.1'00 Kythera's important geographical location may help us to interpret its inclusion in the famous inscription of Amenhotep III (1408-1372 BC),o101 and may also explain the presence on the island of the inscribed stone cup dated to the reign of the founder of the Vth dynasty, Pharaoh Userkaf(c.2487-2478 BC),102 as well as of the Babylonian amulet of Naram-Sin (1830-1813 BC).103 96 At my request, the Institute of Underwater Archaeology undertook an underwater archaeological reconnaissance survey along the E coast of Kythera, more specifically in the area from Cape Mothonaeos up to Cape Souroumi, including the barren islands of Dragonera and Antidragonera. The leaders of the team were D. Kourkoumelis, archaeologist-diver, and N. Tsouchlos, photographer-diver. Of interest were the nine large- stone pyramidal anchors found off the barren island of Antidragonera. These were located in a small gulf to the N, close to the NE headland, and all were found together at a distance of about 50-70 m from the coast. See D. Kourkoumelis, 'Avayvopurrtx. l eo3ppLxta Ipeiva onyv oaXdoota 3Eptoxrl AvXatlova-Kviilpo v, nEpt6o0v 1993', Evcita, 4 (r992), 6-II. In 1995 a hellenistic shipwreck was located with vases and lamps. The anchors belonged to this wreck. Furthermore, Kyrou found an obsidian arrowhead on Antidragonera. 97 See K. Branigan and P. Warren in discussion, 'Minoans of Kythera', IiI.

SAKELLARAKIS Kythera's strategic location,104 and in particular that of the peak sanctuary at Agios Georgios, raises yet another question, especially in connection with the flourishing MM III-LM I period (likewise a zenith for the metropolitan Minoan peak sanctuaries, Jouchtas in particular). Some scholars have hypothesized05--I think reasonably-that the building activity and rich finds encountered atJouchtas, dated to this period, suggest that popular cult at the peak sanctuaries becomes palatial under the aegis of the central authority. This hypothesis appears to be supported by a well-known LM II sealing from Knossos.1'06 This thesis may find support in the finds from Agios Georgios and perhaps also in the existence of other peak sanctuaries in the Aegean, discussed below. The unique quantity of bronze figurines found on Kythera cannot be interpreted as a sign of popular cult activity. One begins to suspect not only a relationship between the palaces and the peak sanctuaries but also, in the case of Kythera, the exercise of propaganda. If this is correct, cult activity at the Kythera peak sanctuary was not dependent on west Crete but on central Crete: Knossos itself. It may be significant that peak sanctuaries are concentrated in east and central Crete and that to date bronze figurines have not been found in west Crete.107 To prove this hypothesis, which eschews the more simple association of Kythera with west Crete, it is vital that a diligent study be made of pottery from the peak sanctuary at Agios Georgios, especially since the early years of the Kytheran colony betray a relationship with pottery from west Crete.108 It must not be forgotten, however, that 'the vast majority of the imported Minoan material appears to come from west and central Crete'.109 Once again, the question of a Minoan thalassocracy is raised. But now, following the above-mentioned Athens conference we have, in addition to Kythera, other important information from the excavations on Samothrace undertaken by D. Matsas.11"0 I shall not dwell on this subject, however,l'l neither do I want to answer the question posed by N. Coldstream and G. Huxley: 'were there new settlers from Crete, commissaries of the thalassocracy?'12 I shall confine myself to questions of religion, keeping in mind that Agios Georgios on Kythera is not the only peak sanctuary in the Aegean. At least one other island profoundly influenced by the Minoans in the second millennium BC also had a peak sanctuary: Kea. I refer to the appropriately named hill of Troullos on Kea, overlooking Agia Irini,11"3 whose 'commanding position had suggested that it would serve well as a station from which ships could be watched and signals be given by semaphores to the town or the harbour', according 104 On the strategic location of Kythera in later periods see N.

That a peak sanctuary existed on Troullos is not a new hypothesis."115 It would seem that this was indeed the case, not only in view of the location and the buildings uncovered there,116 parallels to which have been found at Cretan peak sanctuaries, but also in the light of the movable finds: the pottery included 149 plain conical cups and 12 tripod vessels,117 the stone vases consisted of a ladle"l8 and offering tables,119 and bronze votive dagger cut-outs120 were also found, all typical for a peak sanctuary. Indeed, one of the bronze votive cut-outs from Troullos resembles a votive foot from the peak sanctuary on Kythera.121 The Troullos site has not been fully excavated since 1972, when A. Bikaki came upon a chance find, the bronze figurine of an adorant,122 yet another find typical of Minoan peak sanctuaries. Future excavations may well reveal new and important evidence. Another Minoan peak sanctuary in the Aegean can be identified at the Minoan site of Trianta at Ialysos on Rhodes.123 Italian excavations in 1925 on the Ialysos acropolis above Trianta, located on the mountain of Philerimos (267 m), where an ancient temple of Athena once stood, uncovered a few MM clay and stone vessels, recently published by M. Benzi.124 Benzi,125 along with R. Hope Simpson andJ. E Lazenby,126 noted with good reason that 'the choice of so large and high a site as Mt. Philerimos for establishing a settlement is an unusual one'.127 The objects' find contexts are unclear and the clay objects are intact, quite unlike the case at Cretan peak sanctuaries, where they are found in an extremely fragmentary state. Nevertheless, the presence of an incense-burner'28 and a loom-weight,129 but most importantly of many stone vases including an offering table,1'3 suggests that this may have been the site of a peak sanctuary.'3 114 A.

SAKELLARAKIS This hypothesis finds support in Philerimos' location.'32 Not only does it find a parallel at Agios Georgios since it commands an extensive sea view, in this case of the central eastern Aegean, but it is also characterized by all the features common to Minoan peak sanctuaries: general prominence, visibility, accessibility, and proximity to the settlement.133 Benzi suggested that later Greek and medieval buildings on Philerimos may have destroyed earlier remains.134 Recent excavations at Trianta, however, unearthed bronze figurines of the adorant type.'35 The existence of a Minoan peak sanctuary on Philerimos on Rhodes must thus remain an open question for the time being.'136 Yet another Minoan shrine may exist on Naxos, on the hill of Mikri Vigla in the west of the island, where a surface survey undertaken by the British School at Athens and the local Ephorate of Antiquities'37 uncovered a total of I40 clay figurines'38 in addition to a considerable quantity of MM and LM pottery'39 among other finds dating from the Early Cycladic to the Frankish period. Discussion of this subject by R. L. N. Barber and O. Hadjianastasiou notes the unique nature of the clay figurine finds from the Cyclades'40--with the exception of a few neolithic examples from Kephala on Kea.141 On the other hand, while Barber and Hadjianastasiou have emphasized the parallels between these figurines and certain-albeit very few-Early Cycladic marble parallels,142 they have virtually ignored the many and varied clay parallels from Minoan peak sanctuaries on Crete.143 This is indicative of a trend prevalent in recent research of the Cycladic world, which has propunded the hypothesis of the Cyclades as an independent and 'democratic' cultural entity juxtaposed to the tide of 'the times'l"44-an entity 132 For recent Minoan finds on Philerimos at the Prof. Ilias site, including conical cups, see A.

Prof. Benzi wrote me the following on 5 Feb. 1995: 'As to the MM settlement on the Acropolis at Ialysos, when writing my paper I took into account the possibility that this was the site of a peak sanctuary yet later I discarded it for two main reasons. The first is the lack of cultic (admittedly with the exception of the stone offering table) and votive objects commonly found at such sites and the domestic undistinguished character of the pottery. The second is that further traces of MM occupation have been found on the nearby hill of Prophitis Ilias (T. Marketou's paper in Archaeology in the Dodekanese) and at other sites in the Ialysos area. That led me to the conclusion (however not clearly stated in my paper) that the MBA occupation in this area was kata komas and that the settlement on the Philerimos was just a small village or a farmstead (yet, perhaps, the stone vessels don't fit this explanation). The choice of such an elevated site for a Minoan settlement is no doubt an unusual one. It could be explained by security reasons (admittedly the explanation facilior, but not an implausible one at such an early stage) or by the fact that in MM times the Trianta plain was marshy and unhealthy (but a layer predating LM I A has been found by T. Marketou at Trianda) and that environmental conditions improved later (to my knowledge the paleogeology of the area has not yet been investigated). None of my arguments is conclusive especially in view of the fact that the site has been so much spoiled by later occupation.' 137 R. L. N. Barber and O.

All the features of the Naxian figurines-plastic form,148 pose, the existence of upright and seated examples,149 dress, and gestures'50-have many Minoan parallels, despite the fact that the Naxian figurines consist of poorly preserved surface finds. A clay head151 need not be associated with marble Cycladic figurines since the frequently encountered backward incline of the head, together with the varied modelling techniques, finds a parallel in many Minoan figurines.152 Likewise, it is unnecessary to associate a few Naxian figurines'53 with the well- known Early Cycladic 'hunter-warrior' type marble figurine'54 since the Naxian clay figurines render the belt straps and girdle just as Minoan clay figurines do.155 This would appear to be the reason why the dagger is not rendered on the Naxian clay figurines.156 Neither is it necessarily true that the long neck represents a non-Minoan feature in the Naxian figurines.157 On the contrary, among the many and varied Minoan figurines a particularly long neck is often encountered.158 The Naxian figurines have other Minoan parallels, however. The phallus sheath'59 is not a Cycladic'60 but a typical Minoan trait,161 as is the belt.162 Similarly characteristic is the fact that the best-preserved Naxian figurine163 has a headband in high relief, just like those in the 145 Cf. the thoughts expressed by S. Hood, 'Cretans in Laconia?', in Sanders (n. 86), 135: 'Some of those who have attacked the views of Evans about Cretan domination over parts of the Greek mainland during the Bronze Age have dismissed them as reflecting British imperialist sentiment of the Victorian era. There may be an element of truth in this claim, but such critics often tend to forget that their own views must similarly reflect the atmosphere of their time. Evans and his contemporaries were probably in fact rather better placed to make reasonably objective judgements about what happened in early times, since they were in general well grounded in a knowledge of the Old Testament and of ancient Greek and Roman history, which gave them some basis for looking at the past in depth and from viewpoints that differed from those of their own age. 'At the moment, and in the more relaxed political atmosphere of the present, the whole question of Cretan expansion during the Bronze Age into the islands of the Aegean and to the coasts of the mainland bounding it on the west and east in modern Greece and Turkey is under review.' 146 For example, see recently C. Doumas, The Wall Paintings of Thera (London, 1992), where even a simple reference to Crete is avoided in the text (though not in the preface by P. Warren, I2-1I3). Even the otherwise rich bibliography omits various articles such as that by E. Sapouna-Sakellaraki on the relationship between the Thera wall-paintings and Crete. 147 Apart from the figurines from Petsofas (Petsofas, pls 3-46), very few have been published: Sapouna-Sakellaraki (n. 79); Pilali-Papasteriou (n. 21). The large number of figurines from the peak sanctuary at Jouchtas (A. Karetsou) and especially the numerous examples from the peak sanctuaries excavated by K.

SAKELLARAKIS examples from Agios Georgios. Also noteworthy is the presence of votive human limbs among the Naxos figurines.164 These correspond with many Minoan examples-not necessarily with suspension holes-as we have seen in the bronze versions from Agios Georgios. Furthermore, the small size of the Naxian figurines165 is reminiscent of many miniature Minoan figurines. Finally, the absence of animal figurines from Naxos166 is also mirrored on Kythera. The clay figurines from Mikri Vigla on Naxos,167 which were manufactured on site,168 are thus typical of Cretan peak sanctuaries and should be associated with the abundant Minoan pottery from the same site. It is also interesting that the imported Minoan pottery'69 from Mikri Vigla'70plain conical cups,'171 incense-burners,'72 tripod cooking pots,'73 and pithoil'74-find parallels both at Agios Georgios and in the Cretan peak sanctuaries. The same holds true for the loom-weights.175 The finds from Mikri Vigla on Naxos are thus typical of a peak sanctuary. The site, furthermore, is both visible'76 and generally prominent, features considered characteristic of a peak sanctuary. The name itself (which translates 'Small Observation Post') reflects this. Surface traces of structures of some sort were found together with the figurines. These may be the remains of buildings associated with the peak sanctuary,'77 which operated under a 'strong Minoan influence'.178 Barber and Hadjianastasiou have also noted in passing the relationship between the figurines and peak sanctuaries.179 The existence of a peak sanctuary here, however, is not certain. Older, Early Cycladic installations exist on the site,180 which is also located at a height of only 60 m, perhaps a little more in the Bronze Age.'8' (Note, however, that the peak sanctuary of Malia, Profitis Ilias, is located at a height of only 99 m.182) Even less precise is the relationship between Mikri Vigla on Naxos with a settlement'83 whose peak sanctuary it may have been-Grota, the island's most important Middle to Late Cycladic settlement. Only further investigation and excavation at Mikri Vigla can confirm or refute this hypothesis, especially now that Minoan pottery has appeared at other sites on other islands, such as Kato Koufonisi.184 There may very well be more peak sanctuaries in the Aegean.

This theory is supported by a rendition of a peak sanctuary from 186 See S. Marinatos, Thera, ii (Athens, 1969), 35; J. W. Sperling, Thera and Therasia (Athens, 1973), 24, no. 75; R. L. N.

Lambrinoudakis, 'Remains of the Mycenaean period in the sanctuary of Apollon Maleatas', in Sanctuaries and Cults, 59-65; PAE (1983), 152-6; (1987), 53-8; (1988), 21-2) corresponds to a Minoan peak sanctuary, as the excavator believes (Lambrinoudakis, 59 n. 5, 62 n. 17) along with other scholars (Cult Places, 260 n. 2; Bintliff (n. 76), 152; K. Kilian, 'Mykenische Heiligttimer der Peloponnes', in Kotinos: Festschriftfiir Erika Simon (Mainz, 1992), II). Peatfield (n. Io), 273, regards this as possible, even though (ibid. n. I) he thinks it is a 'hill shrine' and states that, as with Troullos on Kea, the remains 'do not reflect the same cult system as the Minoan peak sanctuaries'. P. Warren, in a related discussion in Sanctuaries and Cults, 63, sees no difference between the shrine at Maleatas and a Minoan peak sanctuary, which he finds 'astonishingly similar'. Perhaps these scholars have not visited the site and, owing to the unclear nature of the excavation report, have overlooked the fact that the Maleatas shrine was not founded on the peak but on a slope. Even in 1977-8 (PAE (1977), 193-4; (1978), 111-13, fig. I), before the association of the site with a Minoan peak sanctuary, traces of a prehistoric settlement were found on the mountain peak above the shrine (PAE (1977), 193-4; (1978), 111-13, fig. I), and these were carefully recorded in association with the shrine only in 1987 (PAE (1987), 56, fig. 2). Cf. the objections made by Dickinson (n. 67), 282-3, who notes that 'characteristics of peak sanctuaries are lacking'. Any identification of the Maleatas shrine with the thoroughly established type of Cretan peak sanctuary should thus be ruled out. H~igg (n. 6), 120-I, has shown, I think clearly, that the Maleatas shrine is a Mycenaean shrine, since typical characteristics of Minoan peak sanctuaries are completely missing. Even the Minoan finds which Hagg accepts-the seals-are not all Minoan but Mycenaean as well (J. A. Sakellarakis, 'Kretisch-mykenische Siegel in griechischen Heiligttimern', in U. Jantzen, Neue Forschungen in griechishen Heiligtiimern (Ttibingen, 1976), 292, nos. 30-I, figs. 31-3; CMS I, suppl. no. 32; CMS 5.1, nos. 221-2; CMS 5, suppl. IA, nos. 336-9; cf. I. Pini, 'Minoische Siegel aulerhalb Kretas', in Thalassocracy, 123-30, who considers them Mycenaean (ibid. 126 n. 3I), including even the talismanic seal from the Maleatas sanctuary). Perhaps one should await the publication of the shrine to see 'some sherds of Minoan pottery' (Higg (n. 6), 21) along with plain conical cups that are mentioned (Wiener (n. 6), 21 n. 40). The presence alone, however, of so many bronze votive double axes can leave no doubt as to Minoan influence (Higg (n. 6), 121; Lambrinoudakis (above), 62). 188 Morgan, 'Theme in the West House painting' (n. 76), 89: 'hill top ceremonies may have occurred outside Crete without the use of permanent, or indeed, any, cultic accoutrements'. Morgan (n. 99), 156: 'There is indeed no reason why high places should not have been revered and sanctified by the inhabitants of the smaller islands or of the mainland in the period under review, particularly at those sites which felt Minoan influence. It may be that their identification has proved elusive because the nature of the cultic remains differed from those of Crete and were perhaps impermanent or even that the place was considered sacred without the need for cultic paraphernalia... It may be that in time more conclusive evidence will appear for the use of hill tops as cult places within the Cyclades.' 189 E. K. Melas, The Islands of Karpathos, Saros and Kasos in the Neolithic and Bronze Age (G6teborg, I985). Melas (personal communication, 19 Oct. 1995) suggests the existence of peak sanctuaries at the sites of Leftoporos in the sw part of Karpathos (op. cit. 36-7, E35) and Vouno (op. cit. 31-2, DI8) in the SE part, sites with visibility and general prominence where, according to Melas, sherds of plain conical cups have come to light. 190 A.

SAKELLARAKIS the Cyclades which suggests the wider dissemination of this Minoan type of shrine and which is recognizable to any tenant of or visitor to a Cycladic house:195 the so-called 'Meeting on the Hill' which appears in the wall-painting of the north wall of room 5 of the West House on Thera. Many scholars have, with good reason, considered this to depict the performance of a rite in a Minoan peak sanctuary.196 Immerwahr has also recognized a peak sanctuary in another wall-painting from Thera.197 Minoan religious influence in the Aegean is not, of course, limited to purely Minoan types of peak sanctuary. This influence was not homogeneous, but varied according to the degree of general contact maintained between a specific area and Minoan Crete.198 This may explain why the peak sanctuaries discussed above have provided us with different votive offerings which have neither the variety nor the quality of those found at Agios Georgios. Minoan religious influence in the Aegean has been discussed by many scholars and should be taken for granted in the light of two important postwar finds, the clay figures from Kea and the wall- paintings from Thera. I will not expand on this subject. It remains to take note of the influence exerted by Kythera on the Peloponnese,199 and Lakonia in particular.200 Perhaps certain elements that have been considered Minoan in later Lakonian cult should be re-examined. Scholars of religion have already stressed the Minoan roots of a predominantly Lakonian cult, that of Hyacinth,201 with its pre-Hellenic name for the flower associated with Cretan Zeus; and perhaps even that of Helen202--possibly a Minoan deity-- not only on account of her association with tree worship but also because of her characteristics, also encountered in the person of Ariadne. In this context mention should be made of a study undertaken by E. Sakellaraki203 which underscores the almost total absence of Mycenaean bronze idols204 and the subsequently important presence of four lead figurines from Lakonia and Messenia. Two figurines from Kambos205 and one from Pavlopetri206 in Lakonia, along with another from Peristeria in 195 See the observations by Marinatos (n. 78) on the iconography and contents of the Thera wall-paintings. 196 B.

More intensive investigation of the sites on Kythera will throw greater light on the influences that Minoan Crete had on the Mycenaean Peloponnese, and not only in the area of religion. Just as Kastri, according to its excavators, 'may have played a vital part in a Minoan diaspora, shortly before its abandonment in the face of Mycenaean expansion',209 so Agios Georgios may have played an important role in the dissemination of Minoan religion. With regard to religion in Kythera itself, Crete's close association with the island in later times is well documented.210 Even today, the priest at Agios Georgios on Vouno hails from Crete.211 National Archaeological Museum, Athens Y. SAKELLARAKIS 207 E. Vermeule, Boston University Journal (1961), II9; Sapouna-Sakellaraki (n. 9), 138. 208 Sapouna-Sakellaraki (n. 9), I42-3, figs. I-3. 209 'Minoans ofKythera', nIo. 210 For example, from I3i3 to 1450, with the ban on the ordination of Orthodox priests in Crete, the bishopric of Kythera became especially important to the Cretans since most of the novices went to Kythera to be ordained. The chronicle of Cheilas relates that during the first half of the I5th cent. the upkeep of the monastery of St Theodore on Kythera was undertaken by a protopapas called Notaras (Ch. Hopf, Chroniques grico-rornaines (Berlin, 1873; repr. Athens, 1961), 346-7; Ch. Maltezou, 'The Chronicle of Cheilas: social and ideological problems on Kythera in the I5th cent.', Edouueexrza, 8 (1989), 16 nn. 2, 3). The title protopapas is very important since it denotes the upper ecclesiastical official in the Ionian islands and Crete, where the Orthodox episcopal sees had been abolished and ecclesiastical administration passed into the hands of the protopapas, whose authority was equal to that of a bishop, with the exception of the right to ordain. The presence of a protopapas on Kythera, who from his title must have been Cretan, bears witness to the level and the frequency of ecclesiastical relations between Crete and Kythera (Maltezou, op. cit. 23-5). 211 Father Georgios Adikimenakis, from Listaro in Messara.</page><page sequence="20">PLATE IO (a) (b) (c) Y.
