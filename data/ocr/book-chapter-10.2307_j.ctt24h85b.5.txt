<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> 3 An early-Holocene Aboriginal coastal  landscape at Cape Duquesne, southwest  Victoria, Australia Thomas Richards  School of Geography and Environmental Science, Monash University, Clayton, Victoria  thomas.richards@monash.edu Introduction Peter Kershaw has contributed substantially to the understanding of palaeoenviromental  change in Australia, particularly in relation to the timing of Aboriginal colonisation and  anthropomorphic alterations of vegetation communities. More recently, Kershaw and colleagues  have studied the palaeoenvironment of southwestern Victorian landscapes, with emphasis on  the palaeoecology of lakes and swamps, especially in regard to the appearance of Aboriginal  water management and fish-trapping systems on the Mt Eccles lava flow and the relationship  of these systems to socioeconomic complexity of Aboriginal groups in the southwest (e.g.  Kershaw 2004; Tibby et al. 2006; Builth et al. 2008; Kershaw and Lewis 2011). This chapter  addresses similar issues of Aboriginal social complexity in southwest Victoria, but examines  them from a nearby coastal landscape perspective. There has been controversy regarding the complexity of Aboriginal societies in southwest  Victoria since the 1880s, with disagreement focused on the nature of leadership in the  ethnographic period (e.g. Dawson 1881, 1887; Curr 1886; Howitt 1887, 1904; Corris 1968;  Lourandos 1977, 1980a, b, 1983, 1984, 1987, 1997; Barwick 1984; Williams 1985, 1987;  Critchett 1990, 1998; Edwards 1987; Hiatt 1996; Keen 2006; Hayden 2006) and expanding a  century later into debates regarding Lourandos's socioeconomic intensification modelling for  the late-Holocene (e.g. Lourandos 1980a, 1983, 1985a, b, 1988, 1993, 1996, 1997; Beaton 1983,  1985; McBryde 1984; Williams 1985, 1987, 1988; Godfrey 1989; Bird and Frankel 1991a,b,  1998, 2005; Lourandos and Ross 1994; Bird et al. 1998, 1999; McNiven et al. 1999; David et al.  2006; Keen 2006; Hiscock 2008). ‘Complex’, ‘affluent’, or ‘transegalitarian’ foragers or hunter- gatherers are societies thought to exhibit characteristics of cultural and social complexity that  contrast with an idealised view of egalitarian, highly mobile hunter-gatherers (Koyama and  terra australis 34 </page> <page sequence="2"> 66 Thomas Richards Figure 1. Location of Cape Duquesne Aboriginal landscape in southwest Victoria, Australia. Thomas 1981; Price and Brown 1985; Hayden 1995; Grier et al. 2006): Transegalitarian societies are societies that are neither egalitarian nor politically  stratified; they are thus intermediate between generalized hunter-gatherers and  chiefdoms in terms of the social and economic inequalities that characterize them.  (Owens and Hayden 1997:121) While much of the debate regarding transegalitarian features in the archaeological record  of southwest Victoria has revolved around Aboriginal water control and eel management  infrastructure, and earth mounds, Aboriginal marine shell middens are a major source of  contention in the region, with Lourandos (1983, 1993, 1997:224-227; Lourandos and Ross  1994:58-59) documenting the increasing use and establishment of middens from ca. 3500 years  terra australis 34 </page> <page sequence="3"> An early-Holocene Aboriginal coastal landscape at Cape Duquesne, southwest Victoria, Australia 67 ago as evidence in support of his intensification model, although this is disputed by some other  researchers (e.g. Godfrey 1989; Bird and Frankel 1991a, b; Hiscock 2008:190-191). Missing  from these discussions have been comparisons between the structure and contents of late- Holocene middens and earlier middens, due to the absence of data from formally excavated  early-Holocene middens in the region. Excavations on an Aboriginal landscape at Cape Duquesne provide crucial evidence for  early-Holocene coastal occupation in this region and this paper will document the chronology,  contents and structure of several excavated middens from this period and characterise midden  deposition rates and littoral resource exploitation patterns (Figure 1). This baseline data set for  the early-Holocene will be compared with data from the late-Holocene as an additional means  of evaluating possible late-Holocene changes in coastal resource use related to or reflecting  increased complexity in regional societies.  Before the Cape Duquesne Aboriginal landscape data are presented, the regional  archaeological context and local environmental setting are briefly reviewed. Previous archaeology  Over the past four decades, numerous researchers have focused on the southwest Victoria  and adjacent southeast South Australia coastal region (e.g. Lourandos 1976, 1980a, 1983, 1997;  Witter 1977; Clark 1979; Godfrey 1980, 1984, 1989, 1994, 1996, 2000; Godwin 1980; Wesson  and Clark 1980; Simmons and Djekic 1981; Head 1985; Frankel 1986, 1991; Cann et al. 1991;  Webb 1995; Richards and Jordan 1996; Everett 1998; Schell 2000a, b; Bird and Frankel 2001;  Debney and Cekalovik 2001; Richards and Johnston 2004; Richards and Webber 2004). Yet  excavation data for the early-Holocene is limited to two well-researched sites – Bridgewater  South Cave and Koongine Cave. Bridgewater South Cave, only 8 km north of Cape Duquesne, was excavated by Lourandos  in the mid 1970s (1976, 1980a, 1983, 1997). The site consists of superficially disturbed stratified  deposits both inside and in front of a medium-sized limestone rockshelter that had excellent  preservation of organic material (see cover photograph of this volume). Of interest here is  the late-Pleistocene-early-Holocene occupation evidence within stratigraphic Phase A, dating  between ca. 13,250 cal BP and ca. 9350 cal BP (Table 1) (Lourandos 1983:83; Head 1985:5): During this phase there is an over-riding emphasis on land mammals that consisted  of a substantial proportion of macropods (including the grey kangaroo) and wombat.  There was correspondingly very little representation of marine foods. Apart from  scattered pieces of shell of both sandy beach and ocean rock platform species there  was evidence of one seal and one fish. Flaked stone was in low frequency... (Lourandos  1980a:348) Lourandos (1980a:349-350) characterises occupation during Phase A as likely to have  occurred during autumn-winter, with the evidence suggesting '...an ephemeral use of the site  as a hunting bivouac...' (Lourandos 1997:201-202). Although currently 1.5 km from the sea in a straight line, Bridgewater South Cave would  have been ca. 3.75 km from the Discovery Bay coastline at 11,000 cal BP, ca. 3.0 km at 10,000  cal BP and only ca. 2.25 km by 9000 cal BP, thus within easy reach of the shoreline; however, it  is apparent that decisions were made not to exploit coastal resources from this camp, with the  major exception of a high-value resource such as seals.  In several ways, Koongine Cave is a twin of Bridgewater South Cave, located at the opposite  end of Discovery Bay, some 85 km to the northwest (Bird and Frankel 2001:74). It is also a  terra australis 34 </page> <page sequence="4"> 68 Thomas Richards Table 1.

Marine shell determinations were calibrated with the Marine09 radiocarbon age calibration curve; no Delta R correction was employed due to the age of the samples (Reimer et al. 2009). Charcoal determinations were calibrated using the IntCal09 radiocarbon age calibration curve as some of the samples were too old for SHcal04 (Reimer et al. 2009; McCormac et al. 2004). All calibrations were undertaken with the CALIB Radiocarbon Calibration Program rev. 6.0.1. (Stuiver and Reimer 1993; Stuiver et al. 2011).  Median probability of calibrated dates is rounded to the nearest 50 years. </page> <page sequence="5"> An early-Holocene Aboriginal coastal landscape at Cape Duquesne, southwest Victoria, Australia 69 substantial limestone cave set in a scarp on the edge of the coastal plain, containing significant  early-Holocene occupation deposits, and has a well-preserved faunal assemblage. Both the early and middle phases of occupation (ca. 11,000-9000 cal BP) are interpreted  as representing repeated camping events during which a range of medium and small land  mammals, including possums, bandicoots, potoroo, wallabies and wombats, and large mammals  such as grey kangaroo, were hunted (Bird and Frankel 2001:71). In this sense, the period of  occupation and the faunal assemblage is remarkably similar to that documented at Bridgewater  South Cave (Lourandos 1980a: Table 13:2, 1983:83; Head 1985:5). The middle phase is  essentially a less intensive version of the early phase, characterised by shorter and less frequent  occupation episodes (Bird and Frankel 2001:74). Although the shoreline would have been 10-15 km distant during the early and middle  phases, a small amount of marine mollusc shell was recovered from Koongine Cave (Bird and  Frankel 2001:73), as at Bridgewater South Cave. Finally, it is inferred from the presence of  emu eggshell that occupation occurred in winter, although additional seasonal usage is possible  (Bird and Frankel 2001:74) – yet another similarity to Bridgewater South Cave (Lourandos  1980a:352). For Discovery Bay and Cape Bridgewater coastal sites, Godfrey (1989, 1994) and Frankel  (1991) have used spot samples of marine shell from deflated middens for radiocarbon dating,  producing several early-Holocene age determinations (Table 1). Unfortunately, this type of  uncontrolled sampling does not provide a reliable basis for characterising the composition of  faunal assemblages, as surface shell species proportions at Cape Duquesne are typically not  representative of nearby deposits as revealed through excavation (see surface vs. excavated shell  species proportions for shell midden investigations reported in this chapter). The itinerant  dating approach of Godfrey and Frankel tells us only that early-Holocene Aboriginal coastal  occupation of this region probably did occur, but little about the nature of this occupation. Landscape description and environment The study area is located in a very exposed position along the top of steep cliffs at Cape  Duquesne, a headland at the southwestern tip of Cape Bridgewater on the Portland Peninsula  (Figures 1, 2). This is a high-energy coast dominated by swell waves and winds from the west  through south-southwest (Short 1988:125; Buckley 1992:13). Geomorphology, geology and soils  The Portland Peninsula is a large promontory jutting southward into the Southern Ocean,  tipped by a sequence of protruding headlands and indented bays. Cape Duquesne is the  westernmost of the headlands and is bounded by the extensive northwest-southeast trending  Discovery Bay to the west, and the much smaller, protected Bridgewater Bay to the east. The  juncture of Cape Duquesne with Discovery Bay is known as Descartes Bay.  Coastal geomorphology is dominated by three major geological formations exposed in cliff  faces and on the surface – Plio-Pleistocene basalts and tuffs of the Newer Volcanic Formation,  overlain by Pleistocene beach and dune calcarenites of the Bridgewater Formation and capped  by terminal Pleistocene-Holocene dune sands (Boutakoff 1963; Bird 1993:24) (Figures 2-4).  Much of this sequence is exposed in 25-120 m high vertical cliffs extending from Descartes  Bay in the northwest, around the Cape Duquesne and Cape Bridgewater headlands to the  south, and east and northeast into Bridgewater Bay. The present shoreline is mainly sheer  basalt cliff, with the occasional small sandy beach (e.g. White’s Beach to the northwest), narrow  shingle, boulder talus or sea caves (e.g. Seal Cave to the east). There are also frequent off-shore  intertidal basalt platforms.  terra australis 34 </page> <page sequence="6"> 70 Thomas Richards Figure 2. Exposed strata on Cape Duquesne Aboriginal landscape, showing the earliest calibrated radiocarbon age determination  (median probability) for each dated midden and feature and the location of excavation squares. Boutakoff (1963:48-51) defined the Bridgewater Formation, which consisted of a series of  lithified calcareous sand dunes (‘limestone dunes’), formed on sand derived from weathering of  Tertiary dunes exposed by regressing seas during Pleistocene glacial periods, and also included  palaeosols capping the calcarenite dunes. The latter, which were classed as rendzina, terra  rossa and laterite fossil soils, were considered to have formed following calcification of the  underlying dunes during interstadial/interglacial pluvial conditions (Boutakoff 1963:49). They  were described as calcareous, sandy and red, reddish-brown or reddish-pink soils (Boutakoff  1963:51). Subsequent research in the region confirmed Boutakoff's sequence (e.g. Kenley  1976; Douglas 1979; Land Conservation Council 1981), until Cupper et al. (2003:343-344)  upgraded the Bridgewater Formation to the Bridgewater Group and expanded its distribution  more broadly across southwestern Victoria.  Shortly after Boutakoff's (1963) geological study appeared, Gibbons and Downes (1964)  published a study of soils along the southwest coast of Victoria. They described a terra rossa  soil, the Nelson Sandy Loam, and a rendzina soil, the Bridgewater Sandy Loam, both with  parent materials attributed to Pleistocene dune limestone or aeolianite of the Bridgewater  Formation (Gibbons and Downes 1964: Appendix 1). Nelson Sandy Loam is a dark reddish- brown (2.5YR 2/4-3/4 wet) sandy loam, with a weak fine sub-angular blocky and fine crumb  structure, loose to very friable, very porous and with a pH of 6.6 to 7.8 (Gibbons and Downes  1964: Appendix 1). Bridgewater Sandy Loam is a very dark brown (5 to 7.5YR 2/2) sandy loam,  with a moderate medium crumb structure to sub-angular blocky structure, friable, and with a  pH of 8.5 to 8.9 (Gibbons and Downes 1964:Appendix 1). They described one further soil of  relevance, Discovery Bay Sand, found in high and unstable sand dunes, as a light yellowish  brown (7.5YR to 10YR 7/4 dry, 6/4 moist) coarse sand composed mostly of calcium carbonate  (finely broken seashells), with massive structure, loose, no organic matter, and a pH of 8.9 to  9.4 (Gibbons and Downes 1964:Appendix 1). The Land Conservation Council (1981:14-15) described soils developed on dune limestone  in the region as ‘Red-black, uniform-gradational, sandy loams (terra rossa) ... generally shallow,  with a crumb structure, friable throughout, and ... little horizon differentiation’. The Land  Conservation Council (1981:14) study also describes ‘Undifferentiated Calcareous Sands’  generally found in extensive unconsolidated to mobile dunes, formed on sands moved onshore  terra australis 34 </page> <page sequence="7"> An early-Holocene Aboriginal coastal landscape at Cape Duquesne, southwest Victoria, Australia 71 Figure 3.

Vertical exaggeration 12.5 x. from the continental shelf and reworked by wind action. These sands were characterised as  yellow-brown, with little clay or organics, loose and structureless and extremely alkaline (Land  Conservation Council 1981:14).  The Coastal Management and Co-ordination Committee report (1981:29) described the  Holocene Bridgewater Bay mobile to stabilised dunes as overlying Pleistocene calcarenites;  they comprise friable, uniform calcareous sand with little or no soil formation and a pH of up  to 9.5. More recently, Buckley (1992) studied coastal beach and dune sediments from southwest  Victoria in detail. He mentioned unconsolidated Holocene dune sands overlying Pleistocene  calcarenite, notably the stranded clifftop dunes at Cape Bridgewater, and his analysis of  Discovery Bay beach sands is very relevant to understanding of the origin of the clifftop  sediments (Buckley 1992:13-20). He concluded that the majority of sand found on the  Discovery Bay beaches was derived from calcareous continental shelf deposits moved landward  during Pleistocene glacial phases (Buckley 1992:20). The sands were described as grey-brown,  well sorted (0.44 phi), fine-medium calcareous sand, with a mean grain size of 0.26 mm and a  carbonate content of 75% (Buckley 1992:15-20). In the recent synthetic overview by Cupper et al. (2003:343), the Bridgewater Group  included the palaeosol horizons derived from pedogenesis and weathering of aeolian calcarenite  surfaces first identified by Boutakoff. Overlying the Bridgewater Group are the Holocene  Discovery Bay and Bridgewater Bay Sands, a composite of earlier work (e.g. Gibbons and  Downes 1964; Kenley 1976; Land Conservation Council 1981). These sands were found in  unconsolidated calcareous sandy beach, foredune and dune complexes, and were summarised  terra australis 34 </page> <page sequence="8"> 72 Thomas Richards as fine-grained, cream to white calcareous sand (Cupper et al. 2003:344). Rosengren (2001a, b) carried out an applied geological study of Cape Bridgewater and  Cape Duquesne for a wind-farm development. He reviewed the previously reported geology,  and reconfirmed Boutakoff's Pleistocene dune limestone Bridgewater Formation. He attributed  the limestone calcrete to Oxygen Isotope Stages (OIS) 5 to 2, and noted that dunes formed  during OIS 2 to 1 had much slower rates of cementation than in previous Stages (Rosengren  2001a:213-215). Reddish-brown silty and clayey sands overlying calcrete, characterised as  terra rossa and rendzina palaeosols, were again observed, as were poorly consolidated calcareous  sands and clifftop dunes (Rosengren 2001a:213-215). The calcareous sands, of estimated OIS  2 to 1 age, were described as poorly differentiated to gradational, yellowish-brown sands, with  only minor surface organic matter accumulation (Rosengren 2001a:214-215).  Palaeoenvironment  According to Kershaw et al. (2004:158), a decline in effective moisture in the terminal  Pleistocene, largely due to rising temperatures, culminated in a period of maximum aridity  from ca. 17,000-14,000 cal BP, during which woody plants were uncommon. In the succeeding  period, ca. 14,000-11,500 cal BP, increases in both temperature and rainfall resulted in an  expansion of the distribution of trees, accompanied by a change from steppe grassland to  grassland (Kershaw et al. 2004:158). By the beginning of the Holocene, 11,500 cal BP, tree  cover had reached early 19th century levels (pre-European clearing) (Kershaw et al. 2004:158).  Vegetation community composition continued to change, with a sustained increase in Eucalyptus  relative to Casuarinacea trees around 8900-7800 cal BP, so that essentially the vegetation cover  present in the early 19th century, dry sclerophyll forest/woodland, was established by the end  of this period (Kershaw et al. 2004:139,158-159).  Figure 4. View east from western end of landscape, showing surface exposure of strata, including the actively eroding dune  formed in the late-Pleistocene and early-Holocene, the exposed late-Pleistocene early-Holocene palaeosol and Pleistocene  dune calcarenite. A remnant sediment pedestal can be seen on the left top of the dune and numerous carbonate root casts are  exposed all over the eroding face of the dune. Cape Duquesne investigations  Investigations at Cape Duquesne (AAV 7121/233) have revealed a series of open-air  Aboriginal shell midden deposits at the top of a 50 m high cliff, with the ocean currently  washing against its base (Figures 2-4). As noted in the previous section, vast areas of  carbonate sands were exposed on the continental shelf along southern Australia during the  late Pleistocene and much of this sand was mobilised as the high-energy sea transgressed and  strong southwesterly winds prevailed (Short 1988:121). These sands, mainly locally sourced  terra australis 34 </page> <page sequence="9"> An early-Holocene Aboriginal coastal landscape at Cape Duquesne, southwest Victoria, Australia 73 from the exposed sea bed, piled up against obstructions such as the cliffs at Cape Duquesne,  and occasionally overtopped these cliffs (Short 1988:138). During the terminal Pleistocene  through early-Holocene, the resulting sand ramp would have extended from the exposed sea  bed near the shoreline up and over the top of the Cape Duquesne cliffs, providing easy human  access between the two locations. This explains the presence of marine shell middens at the top  of the seemingly impassable barrier of the cliffs (Figure 3, Table 2). Later, the transgressing sea  would have directly eroded the base of the ramp, removing it entirely as the current sea level  was attained (and then exceeded), leaving the stranded clifftop dunes as the last remnant of the  former ramp (Short 1988:138-139; Rosengren 2001a:215).

There are extensive exposures of lithified dune deposits (calcarenite)  along the southern edge of the landscape (the clifftop) in the centre and west of the landscape,  where wind action has scoured away all overlying sediment. These are calcarenites of the  Pleistocene Bridgewater Group.  Running approximately east-west across the landscape is an exposed palaeosol, comprising  greyish sandy loam, most similar to the Bridgewater Sandy Loam, a rendzina soil (Gibbons  and Downes 1964: Appendix 1). The sandy loam directly overlies the calcarenite, varying from  mere remnant patches a few centimetres thick filling in hollows on uneven, calcarenite surfaces,  to deposits more than 1 m thick. Such palaeosols are commonly associated with calcarenites of  the Bridgewater Group and are considered part of this unit. In the present erosional situation,  the palaeosols are again active soils, although generally very poorly vegetated. Dominating the western end of the landscape is a large dune, for the most part actively  eroding with little vegetation cover, but which is vegetated and stable to the north (Figure 4).  Remnant sediment pedestals and exposed carbonate root casts indicate that more than 1 m of  sand has been removed from the southern surface of this dune by wind action. This dune is a  remnant of the clifftop dunes deposited since the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), and much  of the present eroding greyish-brown sandy surface is at least early-Holocene in age. It overlies  both the sandy loam palaeosol and the calcarenites of the Bridgewater Group (Figures 2-4).  The vegetated area 50-150 m to the north of the cliff edge all along the landscape comprises  the remaining stabilised clifftop dune field (Figure 2). Poorly vegetated sandsheets are present  south of the dunefield in patches on the landscape, representing destabilised clifftop dunes  reworked by wind action during the Holocene (Figure 2). terra australis 34 </page> <page sequence="10"> 74 Thomas Richards Archaeological survey and the surface record The area subject to detailed systematic archaeological survey, much of it deflated to some  extent, extended 1 km along the clifftops and up to 400 m inland. The goal of the survey was  to identify the extent of the Aboriginal landscape, focusing on the distribution of flaked and  ground stone artefacts, shell middens, hearth features and other evidence of human occupation.  The initial pedestrian survey identified the gross extent of the distribution of Aboriginal cultural  material exposed on the surface – 58 hearth features, eight shell middens and thousands of  flaked stone artefacts were found over an area of approximately 500 m east-west and 125 m  north-south (62,500 m2). The landscape was mapped, hearth features and shell middens were  recorded in detail, three of the exposed hearth features were excavated and eight shell midden  deposits were tested. None of the great numbers of lithic artefacts observed on the surface were  in situ, so they were generally not mapped individually, although samples of stone artefacts,  animal bones, marine shell, hearth stones, charcoal and sediments were mapped and collected  for identification and analysis. In situ shell midden deposits are only located on early-Holocene and late-Pleistocene  features, namely clifftop dunes and sandy loam palaeosols capping calcarenite, while stone  artefacts and deflated hearth features are distributed more widely across the landscape, suggesting  they mostly derive from more recent deposits that have largely eroded away. Technology of  flaked stone artefacts and radiocarbon age determinations on two remnant hearth features  indicate a substantial late-Holocene occupation across this landscape, but the focus of the  present study is on the early-Holocene shell middens and hearth features.  Surface exposures of middens displayed obvious loose shells that were not in their primary  context, but other shells appeared to be eroding out of the surface, due to wind removal of  surrounding soil particles, and seemed to be in situ. Shell Midden A (SM A) was excavated  first to determine whether in situ deposits were indeed present, to identify the subsurface  structure and characteristics of the midden and to obtain samples for identification, analysis  and chronometric dating.  Excavation of Shell Midden A SM A is located at the northwestern corner of the landscape (Figure 2). It manifested on  the surface as a dense concentration of Turbo undulata and Cellana tramoserica shells and a  small amount of charcoal exposed by wind erosion (Figure 5). Some of the shells were loose,  but what appeared to be an in situ shell deposit was eroding out of sediments below the loose  shell and recently blown-in sand. The area of midden exposed on the ground surface measured  approximately 3 m in diameter; however, it extended under partially consolidated dune deposits  to the northwest and is probably many times larger in area than the exposed, eroding portion.  Methods Square 1, measuring 1 m x 1 m was staked out over the area, with the highest concentration  of eroding midden material on the surface (Figure 5). All sediment was excavated with trowels  and dry sieved through 3 mm mesh screens in the field (with the exception of bulk soil samples);  all sieve residue was retained for cataloguing and analysis. The first step in the investigation  involved the sweeping up and collecting of all loose material on the surface of the square.  Although sorted and catalogued, this material has been excluded from the present analysis and  discussion because it was not in situ. Two excavation units (XUs), each 5 cm deep, were dug  with trowels across Square A. A third XU, also 5 cm deep, was dug in the northeast quadrant  of the square.  terra australis 34 </page> <page sequence="11"> An early-Holocene Aboriginal coastal landscape at Cape Duquesne, southwest Victoria, Australia 75 Figure 5. Shell Midden A, Square 1, pre-excavation view showing dense midden material on surface. Ranging pole bars are  20 cm long. Stratigraphy Excavation revealed a very dense deposit of whole and fragmented marine shellfish shell  that extended across the square, with associated carbonate-coated chunks of charcoal and  flaked stone, to an average depth of 4 cm below surface. Small amounts of shell and charcoal  continued for another 2 cm in the unconsolidated sand (Figure 6). Below the base of the  midden, a patch of burnt sediment and charcoal with an associated large flat rock (manuport)  was uncovered in the northeast of the square and extended to 9 cm below surface. This feature  is stratigraphically earlier than SM A.  Sediment in the midden deposit was an unconsolidated, dark greyish-brown (10YR4/2  wet) to light-grey (10YR7/2 dry) calcareous sand containing carbonate clods and sediment  aggregates, as well as land snails and rootlets providing a non-cultural minor organic component  ( Johnston 1996). Soil pH values varied from 8 (field), a highly favourable environment for  the preservation of bone, to 10 (lab), which is less favourable (Reitz and Wing 2008:140- 141). Detailed analysis revealed that the sand was medium to fine grained (Wentworth 1933),  and composed of 45% quartzite, 40% carbonate and 15% quartz. Negative skewness in the  particle size distribution, grain shape and surface texture, as well as the moderate to well-sorted  nature of the deposit, indicated that this was an aeolian deposit originating from beach sands  ( Johnston 1996). Below the midden, the sediment appeared virtually identical in the field,  although slightly darker (10YR3/2).  Finally, the fact that the loose surface shell appeared to be present only in a small area  directly over in situ deposits suggests that the top of the midden was only exposed a short  time before the investigations occurred and that not much had been lost to wind action (i.e. no  downwind surface trail of smaller items was present).  Marine shellfish The Minimum Number of Individuals (MNI) identified to species in SM A comprised 650  terra australis 34 </page> <page sequence="12"> 76 Thomas Richards Figure 6. Shell Midden A northeast corner stratigraphy. individuals from eight taxa of marine mollusc identified in more than 7.5 kg of shell recovered  (Tables 3-5). The most common shellfish is Turbo undulata, at just under 70% of the total MNI,  with Cellana tramoserica contributing 18%, Austrocochlea concemerata 9%, and five other taxa  each representing 1% or less (Table 5). Radiocarbon dating Four radiocarbon age determinations are pertinent to the dating of SM A, three of them  on Turbo undulata shell from the midden itself, and one on wood charcoal located below the  midden. Initially, one shell sample from XU 1 yielded an age determination of ca. 10,300 cal  BP (Beta-93569) and another from XU 2 dated to ca. 9850 cal BP (Beta-96584) (Table 6). The  determination for XU 1 was slightly older than that from XU 2, although they overlap at two  standard deviations. A second shell determination was run for XU 2, ca. 10,500 cal BP (UB- 4369), with the resulting date older than both of the previous determinations and in sequence  (Figure 7).  terra australis 34 </page> <page sequence="13"> An early-Holocene Aboriginal coastal landscape at Cape Duquesne, southwest Victoria, Australia 77 A further determination on wood charcoal from the charcoal-rich layer underlying the  midden deposit yielded a terminal-Pleistocene radiocarbon age determination of ca. 11,800 cal  BP (UB-4370), indicating a distinct occupation horizon pre-dating midden formation (Table  6).  Other excavations and investigations Following excavation of SM A, with its evident in situ midden deposits, test pits were  excavated at six other surface shell scatters (see Table 7). The purpose of these small-scale  excavations was to evaluate whether intact midden deposits were also present, to characterise the  nature of any midden layers and to obtain samples of shell and other materials for identification  and dating. Similar excavation and recording methods to those employed at SM A were used  on these smaller test pits.  Shell Midden B SM B is located in a flat, nearly vegetation-free expanse of dark grey, very consolidated  sandy loam, located 140 m to the east of Shell Midden A (Figure 2). Turbo undulata shell and  a flint flake appeared to be eroding out of sandy loam palaeosol in an area measuring 7.0 m  east-west by 6.1 m north-south.  SM B was tested with a single 25 cm square placed in the approximate centre of the  exposed midden in an area of high surface shell density. Almost all shell was concentrated in  the uppermost 3 cm of the first XU, although a small amount extended to a maximum depth  of 7 cm in the second XU.  Two species were identified in the 70 g of shell recovered (Tables 3, 4). Turbo undulata  Table 3. Finds by weight (g) for Cape Duquesne investigations.
