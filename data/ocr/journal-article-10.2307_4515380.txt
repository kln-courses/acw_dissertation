<plain_text><page sequence="1">( 398 ) THE CRIMIINAL RESPONSIBILITY OF CORPORATIONS. C. R. N. WINN. Wl T HERE it has been sought to impose on a corporation liability for crimes committed by its agents in the couirse of its business and their emplovment, all the intellectual obstacles which had to be surmounted before imposing corporate liability for tort have been at least equally obstructive, besides the further difficulty that the criminal law knows no such doctrine as ' respondeat superior.' A man is criminally liable for his own acts and for them alone; and in order to establish his gu'ilt it is necessary to show that two elements concur: the actuts must be reus, and the mnens, rea. Again there is the difficulty that a corporation is not susceptible to corporal punishment. It was not possible on the view which the English Courts took of the directors of a corporation, as being the agenrts of the corporation, to impose criminal liability for their acts upon the corporation except in the following special circumstances. Where a statute has laid upon a corporation a legal duty to execuite certain works and the works have not been executed, it was held in 1842 in R. v. Birmingham and Gloucester Ry. Co." that the corporation may be indicted and fined for its non- feasance. But it was there said, per Patteson J., that a corpora- tion may not be indicted 'for a felony, or for crimes involving personal violence.' 2 In R. v. Severn and Wye Ry. Co.3 it was assumed that an indictment would have lain against a railway companv for not maintaining its permanent wav. In R. v. T'yler Commercial Co.4 Bowen L.J. held that where a dutv is imposed on a company by statute, such as the duty to register the names of its members imposed by the Companies Act, 1862, a breach of such duty is indictable in the absence of any indication to the contrary in the statute. The Supreme Court 1 3 Q. B. 223. 2 Ibid. 232. Doubt was cast upon this qualification in State v. Baltimnore and 0. R. R. 15 W. Va. 362; State v. Rowlantd Lumber Co. 153 N.

H.M. the Queem,b that under section 213 of the Criminal Code a corporation miiay be indicted for omitting wtithout lawt ful cause to perform the duty of avoiding danger to human life from anything unnder its control, the company in the particular case having failed to maintain a bridge over which it ran trains. By these cases of non-feasance in breach of a statutory duty the English Courts made the first inroad upon the proposition so succinctly stated by Holt C.J.6: ' A corporation is not indictable but the particular members of it are.' Within a very short interval after the decision in 1842 that a corporation was indictable for non-feasance in breach of statutory duty, the Courts were compelled to recognize that having gone so far they could not pause consistently without holding it to a like responsibility for acts done in breach of a statutory duty which amounted to a misfeasance. No satisfactory distinction could be drawn between the two kinds of breaches of duty, as was clearly demonstrated in the judgment of Lord Denman C.J. in R. v. G. AN. Ry. Co.7 In this case a railway companiy was held indictable for cutting through and obstructing a highway while constructing its line along a course not authorized by statute; since, as the Chief Justice said, a man who is under a statutory duty to build a bridge- with parapets, and niot to build any other kind, but builds one without parapets, may with equal propriety be said to have failed to build a secured bridge or to have built an unsecured one-in either case the essenice of the offence is disobedience to the statute. Similarly in Evans 4 Co. Ltd. v. L. C. C.8 a company committed a criminal offence by keeping open their shop every afternoon in the week in violation of the Shops Act, 1912, s. 4, whiclh might be termed a misfeasance or a non- feasance according as attention is concentrated on the idea of keeping open or on that of failing to close. A Massachusetts corporation was held liable for misfeasance in improperly con- structing, a bridge which constituted a nuisance, in Common- wealth v. Proprietors of Newt Bedford Brtdge.9 The basis of liability in this class of cases is that the act either was done in breach of a statutory duty or amounted to a public nuisance in the nature of a tort committed against the public at large. The liability was expressly put on the latter ground in State v. Passaic County Agriculitural Society.10 7 31 Can. S. Ct. 81. Is Anon. (1700) 12 Modern, 559 7 (1846) 9 Q. B. 315. 8 [1914] 3 K.

Liability to crim-inal penaltv has also been imposed by the English Courts for violations of various statutes which make the simiple commission of a certain wrongful act a crime, irrespective of any mental element of inens rea: cf. Pro'vincial Mfotor (Cab Co. v. Dun7ninqg.11 So, too, Messrs. Studebakers, Ltd. were subjected to a penalty for breach of the Road Vehicles (Trade Licenses} Regulations, 1922, maltide under section 12 of the Roads Act, 1920.12 Under these regulations limited trade licenses miight be issued permitting use of vehicles for specified purposes, 'provided that not more than two personis in addition to the (driver shall be carried.' A motor car belonging to the defendants, in respect of which they held only at trade license, was driven on a puiblic road by their servant, carrying more than two passengers, without the knowledge anid contrary to the express orders of the defendants. It was held that meens rea was not an essential element of the offence and that the defen- dants wvere liable to a penalty: Griffiths v. Studebakers, Ltd. 13 In this case Lord IHewart C.J. expressly adopted the dictunm of Atkin J. in MlIazsell Bros. v. L. + N. W. R1. Co.14 'While PriOna fac;ie a principal is lnot to be miade criminally responsible for the acts of his servants, vet the Legislature may prohibit an act or enforce a duty in such bwords as to make the prohibition or the duty absolute; in which case the pri7nipal is liable if the aict is 'in fact done by his servants.' Similar language was employed by Channell J. in Pearks, GCunston and l'ee, Ltd. v. 'Ward.15 'There are exceptions to this rule [that mens rea is essential to an offence] in the case of quasi-criminal offences, . . . where certain acts are forbidden by law under a penalty, possibly even under a personal penaltv, at any rate in default of payment of a fine.' 16 As a further example may be cited the rece-nt indictment at the Central Criminal Court of the General Steam Navigation Co. Ltd. as owners of the steamer Eagle for receiving on board a greater number of passengers than was allowed by the steamer's certificate, in violation of the Mlerclhant Shipping Act. A fine of 100 guineas was imposed. It was held that a corporation is within the meani-ng of the term ' person ' where it occurs in such statutes as the above, by force of section 2 of the Interpretation Act, 1889: ' In the 11 [1909] 2 R.

Ward,28 and Channell J. thoughi; that they might have been liable under section 3 which, by exempting the defendant on proof of his innocenice, shows that a mental element is conceived to be an element in the offence. In Chutter vr. Freeth 29 an incorporated comnpany was convicted under the Sale of Food and Drugs Act, 1899, s. 20, sub)-s. 6, wlhereby every person who in respect of a food or drug gives a purchaser a false warranty in writing is liable to a fine unless het can show that he had reason to believe the statements made. Iord Alverstone C.J. said that a corpora- tion 'can .give a warranty through its agents, and through its ag,ents it can believe or not believe . . . that, the statements in the warranty are true.' Such a finding certainly involves the attribution of a mental state, belief, to a corporation; in fact the relevant state of belief was the agent's: by a fiction the belief is attributed to, and said to be that of, the corporation. Hitherto the only offences for which criminal liability had been imposed on a corporate principal were such that the significant intent was that of the servant. Now the state of mind of the actual defendant is treated as relevant. It is thus a step forward to hold a corporation liable under a statute which defines the offence as depending on intent or knowledge.30 In America, a corp)oration has been held guilty of an ofenice under the Espionage Act of 1917, S. 3, consisting of publishing matter calculated to cause insubordination among the troops with intent to cause such disaffection. Learned Hand J. said that: ' There is no distiniction in essence betweeni the civil and criminal liability of corporationis, based upon the element of intent or wrongful purpose. Each is merely an imputation to the corporation of the mental condition of its agents.'3i A 27 S.C. per Atkin J.: ' 'hc penalty is imposed uipon the owner for the act of the servant if the servant commits the default provided for in the statute in the state of mind provided for by the statute. Once it is decided that this is one of those cases where a principal rnay be held liable criminally for the act of his servant, there is no difficulty in holding that a corporation may be the principal' (p. 846). 28 11902] 2 K.

There is a dictum of Lord Blackburn in the House of Lords in Pharmaceutical Society v. i5ondon andl Provincial Supply Association, Ltd.,42 to the effect that a corporation may be indicted for publishing a libel, and such an indictment was held in America to lie in State v. Atchison,43 and in People v. Star Co.44 The Mferchandise Marikis Act, 1887, s. 2, sub-s. 1, allows the accused to negative an intent to defraud on being charged with the offenice of applyinig a false descriptioni to goods. Yet a corporation may be convicted of this offenlce.45 In America, inidictments have been successfully prosecuted aga.inst corporations for criminal conspiracy.46 Conspiracy, of all crimes par excellence, demands a guilty mental element, au.nd where the conspir ators are corporations the conspiring minds are in fact the nminds of the directors, or other primary representatives. It is submitted that nio mere conspiracy of inferior agents could affect the corporation with criminal guilt. If the guiltv intentioii in the minds of the primary representa- tives is attributed to the corporation in this case where, more than anywhere, it is the vital elemient of the offence, it seems that it will always be proper to attribute to a corporation the guilty state of miind of its primnary representatives when they do criminal acts on its behalf in the exercise of its powers. fn Encgland by the Act, 24 &amp; 2a Vict. c. 100, ss. 5, 71, on a conviction for manslaughter the Court may at its discretion impose penal servitude for life or such fine as it slhall see fit, either in addition to cOr without any otlher punishment, and may further require the offender to enter inito his own recog- niizances and to find suireties for keeping the peace. Thus a criminal sanction was provided to which a corporation could be amenable, and the practical difficulties in the way of imposing criminal liability were further smoothed away in a recent measure. By the Criminal Justice Act, 1925,47 a method of pr ocedure is prQvided wherebv an indictmiient against a corporation can be presented to a grand jury on an order made bv examining justices, and such an order is to be deemed a committal for trial.

Prior to this Act it had been lheld in R. v. Daily Mliirror Nev;spapers, Ltd.,48 that a limited company cannot be committed for trial on an indictment. The defendant company was chiarged before a justice of the peace with corrupt practices at a parliamentary by-election, committed for trial, anid indicted at Hertford Assizes. The indictment was removed by a writ of certiorari to the King's Bench Division, where the defendants, having pleaded ' not guilty,' were tried before Pvowlatt J. Thinking that the point was arguable whether a limited coumpany could be committed for trial within the neaning of section 1, sub-section 2 of the Grand Juries (Suspension) Act, 1917, or at all, the learned judge allowed the case to go to the jury, who found the company guilty, and they were convicted and sentenced. Onl appeal it was held that on the wording of the Grand Juries (Suspension) Act there could be no proper commiittal for trial of a limited company. Notwithstanding the evident tenor of the 1925 Act, the first prosecution unider the new procedure was quashed by Finlay J. in R. v. Cory Bros., Ltd.49 An inidictment of a colliery com- paniy and three of its enginieers for causing the death of one of the colliers by erecting a live electrical wire fence on their property was presented at Glamorgan Assizes. It was argued that the Act of 1925 never intended that a. corporation could be indicted for a felony and that the section under which the indictment had beeni made was pure machinery. This objection was upiheld by the learned judge on the ground that he was bound by authorities which showed quite clearly that in point of law an indictment would not be sustained against a corpora- tion either for felony or for such1 a misdemeanour as that defined in the indictment (p. 817). It is submitted that this result is not satisfactory, however well founded the decision may have been oni interpretative grounds. In all likelihood a more detailed statement of the circumstances would reveal the fact that the moral responsibility for the erection of the fence lav with the directors. Probably so inportant a step was not taken without the sanction of a vote in a directors' meeting. The directors in their corporate capacitv are, on silch an hypothesis, the guilty parties, both 48 [1.922] 2 R. B. 530. 49 [1927] 1 K. B. 810.</page><page sequence="9">406 T'he Canmbridge Law Journal. morally and legally, since their commanid to inferiors who had no practical alternative to obedience was the originating cause of the collier's death. The directors are guilty in their corporate capacity and should have beeui indicted in that capacity: in their corporate capacity they constitute to all practical intents the corporation itself, that is to say the enduring unit or entity predicated upon themii, and upon the corporators who stand behind them but whose influence upon the policy of the com- pany is largely negligible. Wheii the prinary representatives decided that the fenice should be erected they came to the decisioni within the corporate nex*us, and in procuring, its construction they exercised the powers of the corporation vested in them as its controllers. The decision and the command were in every sense acts done because of, and for the sake of, the association. As inldividuals, it may be hazarded, the directors would each and all have shrunk froml erectinig on their own land such a barbarous man-trap as they collectively advocated under the influence of a property-owning unit pre- disposed to harshness towards a hostile and predatory faction. Corporations have no thoug,hts of their own, for they have no brains through which thought imnages may pass; the brains of the corporators are their ownr brains and not the corporation's. But the minds of the cor porators, thinking in meetinig assembled, exert a mutual iinfluience which makes for definite purpose and firmness of attitude; wlhere nine men of like opinions unite to prove to a tenth the infallibility of their position, each will be strengthened, con-firmed and rendered more obdurate by the support of the others. Mutually stimulated they will go to excesses fromn which alone they would have shrunik. It is an inexplicable but plainlv demiionstrable phenomenon of the human mind that mnen do not think their own thoughts when in groups; each mind contributes something to the group, and is influenced by the thought imi pulses which are in play around it. The intra vires decisions and commands of a board of directors arre factually, and should be legally, the decisions of the corporation and not of the individuals qua individuals; for a corporation is an entity in which individuals are united within a bond of association which modifies their mental processes. It is urged that a corporation should l)e answerable criminally as well as civilly for acts of its primary representa- tives; and that the Courts, were they to impose this liability upon the corporate funlds, would be working for the ends of justice and expediency, and at the same time bringing the law more into consonance with the views anid concepts of intelligent</page><page sequence="10">'The Criminal Responsibility of Corporations. 407 lavmen. Divergence between legal rules and lay modes of thought is always to be avoided where conformity may be secured with no sacrifice of principle or of logical consistenlcy: It is clear, on the one ha-nd, that to seek to hold a corporation criminally liable for the acts of all its. servants within the scope of their employment wouldi be an innovation. The criminal law has never applied the maxim 'respondeat superior,' and to seek to ingraft from without what has not taken spontaneous growth mnight prove an experimuent foredooined to failure. But no such violence to established principles is threatened by the theory here put fornvard: the results to which it points a way are readily attainable on the reasoniing of either of the main schools of thought, conformably to their particular concep- tion of the inature of a corporation. The fictionist creed declares that the Legislature has empowered a certain legal person, created by its own act of recognition, thouigh predicated upon, and composite of, a group of humani beings, to act within a certain scope as freely as any other legal person. Being from its nature physically incapable of itself performing acts, the corporation is intended by its crieator to act through certain human beings whose appointment the Lecgislature either directs or approves. In the exercise of the powers thus bestowedl tipon the corporation, a- crime is committed onI its behalf anid by one of the human beings selected to wield the corporate powers: should not the responsibility be laid upoin the legal unit in whom the powers, which have beein exercised, inihere? The Cou1rts, which have long been aware that corporations assent to contracts anid are deceived by misrepreseintations, after a timiie perceived that they might be guilty of fraud and deceit, and should not niow long remaini oblivious of their capacity for crime. Regarded as a puLre idea, a corporationi cain nto more commit a crime thani the idea of a man, but as a group entity it exerts an influence and crives its representatives motives and means, which come to them from outside themselves. To the realist the problem presents no difficultv which is not readily soluble by deduction from his premise that the corporation is a real organism with a will and obedient members. The corporate will may entertain mnens rea and the corporate hands, which are factuallv the hands of its representa.tives acting in their corporate capacity, may perform the actuts reus, and fu-ll criminal responsibilitv should logically attach to the corporation. Given a punishm-ent to which it is answerable, its liability appears to be fully established.</page><page sequence="11">408 The Cambridge Law Journal. From the viewpoint adopted in this article the situation presents a slightly different aspect: a number of human beings, having agreed to combine an-d become incorporated for the accomplishment of a purpose, have contributed the legal powers, which they might have wielded thenmselves in their newly- acquired capacity as corporators, to be exercised either bv a majority of their nulmber, or, as is more usually the case, bv elected representatives. The persons so elected will be the primary representatives of the corporation, for in them and their successors in their posts the general powers of the corporation are permanently vested by a process preliminarv to the complete organization of the corporation. The legal powers which inhered in the several corporators, in their special capacity as corporators, have been trainsferred into the primary representatives by one original preliminary act of conisensual agreement or of legis- lative pronouncement. From that time oinwards the general corporate powers will be vested in and exercisable by the primary representatives, objectively determined, that is to say by the human beings who from time to time are elected to fill their positions. The directors, or other primalry representatives, will, in the normal case, be required to co-operate in the exercise of the corporate powers, which will be vested in them not severally but as a board. Now a board of directors is an entity able to be differentiated from the aggregate of its members, no less abstract than a corporaition and equally incapable of factual acts. The acts and decisions of a majority of the board, on the principle of original representation, are attributed in law to the board, and will therefore be the acts of the corpora- tion's primary representatives, and an exercise of the corporate powers. On the other hand, the act of a single member of the board, or even of a minority of the board, will not bind the corporation as an exercise of the corporate powers. These are vested in the board and not in the several miiembers of the board. The acts upon which the board determines, and which are therefore an exercise of the corporate powers vested in the board of primary representatives, must, in the natture of things, be factually performed bv the hands or mouth of a human being who may or may not himnself be a member of the board. Whether the actor is lhimself a primary representative is for this purpose irrelevant: the significant question is whether he is acting on his own inlitiative or utnder the direct authority of the board of primary representatives. This will determine whether or not his acts are an exercise of the corporate powers</page><page sequence="12">The Criminal Responsibility of Corporations. 409 vested in the primary representatives. Thus a clear distinction is to be drawn between those acts of a person (in whoin the corporate powers are Inot individually vested) which are merely performances of direct commands from the board of primary representatives, and acts done entirely on the initiative and sole discretion of the actor or merely within a general scope of authority. One should ask: was the act directly authorized by the board of primary representatives, or was it merely within a class of authorized acts, or was it ani entirely unauthorized act ? In the fiirst case the act is by direct attribution the act of the corporation; in the other cases, if a corporate act at all, it is so only by the rule of respondeat superior. Excep- tionally, the corporate powers may be primarily vested in a single representative, such as a bank president, and exercisable at his sole discretion, more or less uncontrolled by the will of an advisorv committee. In. such a case the same question will not arise, since all acts done by the primary representative within the scope of his authority as such will represent an exercise of the corporate powers. Parliament has directed that the law shall attach corporate consequences to the exercise of the legal powers of the corporators which inhere in thein in their corporate capacity: the acts of all the corporators, qua corporators, are in law, apart fromn any circumstance removing such powers from themselves, the acts of the corporation. It rests with the corporators to decide, sul)ject to the will of the lierislature, whether they will them- selves exercise the corporate powers and so remain the primary representatives of the corporation, or will surrender this function to a board of directors or other official or officials. In particular cases the Leg,islature may see fit to enact that the powers of the corporation shall be vested in its directors: normally their representative character will depend uipon usage or the published intent of the corporators as expressed in the articles of associa- tion. An instance of the former mode of vesting the corporate powers is afforded by an act of incorporation considered in Dana v. Bank of UTnited States."0 This act directed that a board of directors be elected and organized 'for the manage- nment of the affairs of the corporation,' and the Court saidl that ' the president and directors, though elected by the stockholders, derive all their authority from the act or charter.' So, too, in Bank of U.S. v. Dandridge,5" Marshall C.J. observed: 'The manag,ement and direction of the affairs of the institution are 50 5 W. &amp; S. 246. 51 12 Wheat. 64.</page><page sequence="13">410 The Camtbridge Law Journal. comiimitted to (the directors) by the express terms of the act of incorporation . . . they alone have the power to manage its concerns and are left without control to exercise their own discretion.' In whatever maiinner they may have been established as the persons in whom the corporate powers are primarilv vested, the directors, or other manag,ing, uncontrolled repre- sentatives, are the controlling faculty of the corporation; both in lay acceptance and in law they are for all practical purposes the corporation. Chief Justice Shaw of Massachusetts in Burrill v. President, etc., of the Nahant Bank,52 declared: 'By the by-laws of these corporations and by a usage, so general and uniform as to be regarded as a part of the law of the land, [a board of bank directors] have the general superintendence and active manage- ment of all the concerns of the bank, and constitute, to all purposes of dealing with others, the corporation. We think they do not exercise a delegated authority, in the sense in which the rule applies to agents and attorneys.' Again, in 3faynard v. Firemen's Fund Insurance Co.,53 Currey C.J. said: 'The directors or dominant body of a corporation is deemed to be the minid and soul of the corporate entity, and what they do as the representative of tlle corporation, the corporation itself Must be deeimed to do, and the motives and intentions of the directors, manifested when a material fact in issue, are to be imputed to the corporation itself.' Cf. Hlindman v. First National Bank of Lotisville,54 per Taft J.: 'This certificate was made by order of the board of directors. This was the governing body of the bank, and though . . . in a certain sense it is an agency or representative of the bank, it is for all practical puirposes the bank.' " When Chief Justice Shaw and Mr. Justice Taft and Chief Justice Currey so define(d the function of the directing bodies of corporations they were giving judicial recognition to a very real business truth: business men do in fact habitually thinik of a company in terms of its directors; of a banlk as controlledI by its president. They know that the funds, etc., belong to the com- pany and not to its representatives, but as an active unit the company is nothing more than these men acting in their special ,capacity. The policy of the corporation is the policy which these men formulate: their brains are the brain of the corpora- 52 2 Met. 163, at p. 166. 53 34 Calif. 48, at p. 55. 54 98 F. 562, at p. 566. 5S Cf.

B3usiness companies, whichl form to-day by far the mnost important class of corporations, have individual characters and characteristics which are in great part the characteristies of their directors writ large where he that runs may read. Their business character is the outward manifestation of the commercial ethics of those who control their policy and system: hard heads at the directors' table make for uncompromising enforcement of a company's rights and short shrift for trespassers. Confidence in a company is inspired by the accession to its directing board of a man of proved ability and integrity, and undermined by such a man's withdrawal. A corporation is more than the representatives whom it outlasts, but at any specific moment it is roughly identifiable with them. In their corporate capacity they are the substance upon which the abstraction rests. Furthermore, directors and other controlling officials of corporations wield resources of material as well as intangible strength which are not at the command of private persons. Their vote is able to tunnel mountains and span ravines; to ensure or to jeopardize the lives of many persons. From a decision in the board roonm of a railway company to accelerate a particular service or to omit the observance of certain precautions, deaths may follow as inevitably as upon a nation's declaration of war, and if the decision is taken in wanton disregard of the foreseeable conse- quenices, it is no less criminal than an agreement between Chicago gunmen to 'work a hold-up' with machine-guns. Indisputably the directors who participate in a decision autho- rizing the agents of a companv to endanger human lives are themselves personally responsible, alike before moral and legal tribunals, and on a given set of facts might be guilty of instigating a murder, or as accessories before the fact. But policy demanids that not only they but the corporation shall be responsible. The resources which they manipulate belong to the corporation: not as private men but as the persons in whom the corporate powers are vested are they potential contrivers of holocaust. Men are notoriously prone to mass depravity and will acquiesce at a meetirng in the adoption of a poliev which singly and in private they would repudiate. Hence, the need for a sanction to compel caution in the selection of directors .Lnd the supervisioin of their policy. A corporation has been said to have no morals, but its members can be induced by an effective sanction to make its outward conduiet conform to a</page><page sequence="15">412 Tlhe Cambridge Law Journal. standard, and where they cain control its directors public policy demands that they slhould be responsible in their corporate capacity. This argument has, of course, no application to cases where the directors are autocrats subject to no control, but in scarcely any business companiy will the directors have power to determine fundamental questions of policy without reference to the body of shareholders, on whom caution may be enjoined by the enlforcement of a criminal fine agrainst the corporate funds. It can never be within the authority 56 of directors vis-a-vis the corporators, except by a vote of criminal stock- holders, to direct a crime, and any seemingly criminal step may be enjoined by a m:aajority of the stoclkholders lest their interest in the corporate funids suffer tlhrough the incurring of a criiminal fine. Admittedly, it is impracticable for single shareholders to maintain surveillance upon the directors, but the plan mig,ht well be adopted of appointing a trustee for the shareholders' interests whose duty it would be to make known to them anv illegitimate action by which the directors might threaten to commit the interests of the corporation. It is a simple matter in drawing up articles of association to make adequate provision for discussion in a shareholders' nmeeting of any questions which it may be desired to raise, and for controlling the directors by means of special resolutions. Too miiuch weight has been given in the discussions of public- policy in relation to the imposition of corporate liabilitv for crime, to the argument that sinice the law has prescribed certain definite penalties which are to be incurred only by offenders having gruilty knowledge and guilty intent, the innocent members of offending corporations ought not to be amenable to those penalties. They are not in fact subjected to such penalties in their personal but only in their corporate capacity; on the criminal conviction of a corporation no stockholder goes to prison unless he has abetted or otherwise involved himself in the criminal act, nio individual pays the fine imposed. The sanction is borne distril)utively, in the same proportion as the fruits of the illegitimate enterprise have, or might have, been enjoyed. Nor does the penalty fall any harder on shareholders than on the innocent families of convicts who are not corporators. Prevention is the priincipal aim of criminal sanction and one effect of imposingp a sanietion upon the corporation for crimes committed in their corporate capacity bv its directors would be to deter such persons from guilty conduct. It may be 56 It may be within their capacity as primary representatives, but that is not here relevant.</page><page sequence="16">The Criminal Responsibility of Corporations. 413 idealistic to suggest that in very many cases the representatives of a corporation would shrink from inflicting upon the corporate entity the infamy of a criminal conviction; but directors might well hesitate to expose the goodwill of their business to such notoriety as has overtaken some American corporations in conse- quence of prosecutions. Corporations which the Courts have found guilty of illegal practices may not know a prison cell or wear the broad arrow, but their goodwill suffers a very definite depreciation. Even a coIlviction for murder might thus prove salutary as involving the sanction of public disapproval and the possibility of intervention by the Attorney-General. Nor is it too fanciful to suppose that consideration for the good repute of a regiment or police squadron muay prove a restraining influence upon its members. The deeds which men do as directors live after them as influences to mould the policies of their successors; they affect the character of the group, as the 'tone' of a school boarding-house is imbued with the personalities of its boys. In an association the ideals of one generation are the tradition of the next. A company which gets a bad name is apt to form bad habits and it is as well that its chain should be shortened in order to lessen its potentiality for harm. Lawyers are as well aware as laymen that corporations consist of human beings and can act only when a human mind contrives and a human hand executes, nor have they bv a pedantic insistence upon the separateness of the legal personality of a corporation, precluded themselves from treating human acts as its acts. Recognizing that ordinarily the mind, where no special call is made upon it for meticulous thought, does not distinguish between the controlling representatives of a company and the corporate body which they represent, the law already treats their acts as for many purposes the acts of the corporation. It attribuites their external acts and their accompanying mental states to the corporation and endorses the layman's view that the corporationl has participated in them. Certain American Courts have expresslv taken this position and have imposed punitive damages on the ground that the corporation itself took part in the wanton wrong and should be made an example to others. Yet what purpose of policy coulld exemplary damages serve to which a punitive fine would- not also prove conducive? The deterrent effect would oper-ate precisely where it is miost needed, upon the directors qua directors, that is, upon the intelligent-thinking element in the corporation, affecting directly their relation to the corporation and not simply their private interests. There would be a sanction which few would lightly</page><page sequence="17">414 T'he Cambridge Law Journal. incur in the loss of personal prestige consequent upon the criminal conviction of a corporation in which one was a director, and in the depreciation in valute of the company's stock of which a good share is commonly held by the directors. Like other legal pe rsons, corporations have a factual as well as a legal existence they are group entities as well as legal persons-and when they are thought of as acting, as contracting, employing servants, cominitting torts or crim-es, they are pictured under their natural aspect as group organizations of actual human beings. All legal persons are tunsubstantial concepts of the intellect: men, qua legal persons, are no more tangible than corporations; they act as men, i.e. as natural persons, and not as legal persons, and it is by operation of law that their acts give rise to consequential rights and liabilities in themselves as legal persons. The concept of a man qua legal person and the concept of the same individual qua natural person are two facets of his Ego or Individuality. Upon the same natural persoin, viewed in distinct aspects or capacities, two or more legal persons 'may be predicated. Acts belong to the realm of facts: legal persons inhabit an intellectual plane and are incapable of action. Already in the law of civil wrongs it is clearly established that liabilities may fall upon a legal person not only for acts factually performed by the human being upon whom that legal person is predicated, or by the specific human beings subsumed in a group unit upon which has been predicated a legal person, but also for the acts of other human beings standing in a certain legal relation to such legal person. It is suggested that criminal liability be imposed on those legal personis wlhich are corporations only for the acts of the hzunvn beings who as primary representatives wield the powers of thbe groups utpon which thtey are predicated, and it goes without saying that in England liability would be restricted to such acts as were within the contemplated scope of activity, of the grou)p unit. For the acts of mere servants and of those members of the group who, having surrendered their immediate control, are not its primary representatives, no criminal liability shoul-d fall upon the corporation any more than upon an individual legal person, except irn cases where the corporation is under an absolute statutory duty to see that a certain thing is either done or, as the case may be, not dolne. In suich a case, the liabilitv is imposed not because of the factual act of the inferior agent buit for the omnission of the primary representatives. Even to-day the gradual process of emancipation of legal</page><page sequence="18">The Criminal Responsibility of Corporationts. 415 thinking about the nature of corporations has not entirely thrown off all the shackles of Blackstonian anthropomorphism. Intellectual difficulty is still felt in giving corporate significance to certain kinds of acts, and a tendency is still perceptible to regard certain actions as in the nature of things incompatible with the intangible non-physical nature of corporations. Perhaps most incongruous of all seem to be the two crimes of murder and rape; the Blackstonian thinker cannot conceive of a corporation beinig guilty of either of these; it lacks a guilty mind to harbour malice aforethoug,ht and has no body to do violence. Yet it may well be urged that such a company as was the East India Company, having wide powers of govern- ment in a distant land and employing soldiers to maintain (liscipline, might be rendered guilty of either crime by the orders of its directing body that a day of terror be inflictedc on a recalcitrant city. The whole history of the legal treatment of corporations illustrates the steady trend away from primitive anthropomorphism to a broad conception of a very wide field of potential corporate responsibility. Public policy demands that corporations be held to a higher degree of responsibility than individuals, in proportion as they are more powerful andl equipped materially to work much greater harm. NOTE. In the Yale Law Journal for April, 1927,5" there is an extremely interesting article by Prof. Henry W. Edgerton, of George Washington University Law School, entitled' ' Corporate Criminal -Responsibility.' In this article Prof. Edgerton has set forth a very able argument in favour of the view here expressed, that corporations should be held to a wide responsibility for crimes committed on their behalf in the course of the corporate eiterprise; buit a more gei eral liability is. there urged than appears consistent with established principles. Prof. Edgerton does not recognize the distinction, which on the reasoning of this article is vital, between crimes committed or directly authorized by the primary representatives of a corporation, and crimes committed by mere inferior servants. or agents. 87 Vol. xxxvi, No. 6, at p. 827.</page></plain_text>
