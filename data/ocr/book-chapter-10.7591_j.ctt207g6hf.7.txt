Babcock  The primitive woman has no choice, and, given the duties  that go with marriage, is therefore seldom able to take much  part in public life. But if she can be regarded as being at a  disadvantage in this respect from our point of view, she  does not regard herself as being at a disadvantage, and she  does not envy her menfolk what we describe as their priv­ ileges. She does not desire, In this respect, things to be  other than they are .  -E . E .

[70]  </page> <page sequence="2"> At Home, No Womens Are Storytellers  of Pueblo ceramics (Figure 4. 1) .  When Helen modeled the first "Sto­ ryteller" doll in 1964, she made one of the oldest forms of Native  American self-portraiture her own, reinvented a long-standing but  moribund Cochiti tradition of figurative pottery, and engendered a  revolution in Pueblo ceramics comparable to those begun by Nampeyo  of Hopi and Maria of San Ildefonso-a revolution that has reshaped  her own life as well as that of her family and her pueblo, not to mention  the fortunes of innumerable other Pueblo potters (Figure 4 .2) . 1 She  is not, however, without ambivalence about the consequences of her  creativity: See. I just don't know. I guess I really started something.  I guess I'm a big Indian artist. But, she hastens to add, I don't like  to be called famous. My name is Helen Cordero. It's my grandfather,  he's giving me these (Figure 4 .3) .  2 But, like it or not, Helen, like her  grandfather, Santiago Quintana, who was Ruth Benedict's favorite  teller of Cochiti tales ,  is one of those "gifted individuals who have  bent the culture in the direction of their own capacities" (Benedict  1932: 26) .  I first met this indefatigable women who is always in a hurry on a  June afternoon in 1978. Fascinated by the Storyteller dolls then be­ coming popular, I had finally screwed up my courage and driven to  Cochiti Pueblo to talk with the inventor herself. That particular day  Helen was having a new hardwood floor laid in her pottery room so  we sat outside under a cottonwood tree. After we had talked for over  an hour about her potteries, her patrons , and her grandfather, she  asked me why I was asking her all these questions .  I replied that I  was thinking about writing an article about Storyteller dolls and with­ out hesitation she responded:  There are three books about Maria [ the  famous potter of San Ildefonso Pueblo] and none about me. Thus began  a complicated and important relationship that has redefined my life  and my work. The difficulties as well as delights that Helen and I have  had gathering all these words and pictures together into a big book  about her art and experience have convinced me that representing  another woman is a problematic enterprise. Betwixt and between  Cochiti Pueblo, museum archives, and the world of dealers and col­ lectors who traffic in Indian art, I have been forced to rethink and  revise many assumptions about women's art and creativity, about fem­ inism and crosscultural inquiry, about biography, autobiography, and  life history, and about the meaning of things .  When after talking with Helen and many other Pueblo potters who  have imitated her invention, I began reading scholars in an attempt  [7 1 ]   </page> <page sequence="3"> Figure 4.1.

[74]  </page> <page sequence="6"> At Home, No Womens Are Storytellers  to understand the dynamics of this revolution in contemporary ce­ ramics, I discovered that, for the most part, discussions of innovation  in ethnic and tribal arts have followed an art historical approach,  examining the creativity of the artist or performer in relation to the  tradition he or she has inherited, and the subsequent changes his or  her work has wrought in the aesthetic system (Biebuyck 1969) . In  contrast to modern Western art, primitive and folk art is generally  regarded as subservient to tradition and community values ; the as­ sumption that such "art forms reinforce the bonds of the community  rather than make manifest and challenge the oppositions within it" is  rarely questioned or examined (Firth 1966: 167) . Less frequently and  more recently (d'Azevedo 1973), innovation has been interpreted from  a psycho- or sociobiographical perspective, that is in relation to the  life history and motivations of the innovator and the ways in which he  or she is already "marginal, " "deviant, " etc. Unfortunately, this nec­ essary corrective to the myth of anonymous, collective, tradition­ bound creativity tends toward a romantic reification of the alienated  genius, which says a great deal more about how "we" regard the  creative person than about how "they" do. That is beginning to change  as scholars move away from these extremes to examine the dialectic  of creativeness and constraints , the sociocultural consequences of, and  the conditions for creativity, and the politics as well as the poetics of  innovation. 3 In insisting on the inseparability of the poetic and the  politic, of artistic innovation and social innovation, I am indebted to  both Ruth Benedict and Victor Turner, who opposed the separation  of the social and the symbolic and the related separation of science  and humanism in anthropological analyses. Rather, they insisted on  culture as creative process-and on the ways in which performers and  performances (verbal, dramatic, or artifactual) not only follow but re­ vise and revitalize accepted rules, acting out and challenging aesthetic  conventions and social values. 4  More than simply reflecting or expressing social structure and world­ view, any significant new form reconstructs cultural reality, causing a  dislocation in the economy of cultural representations : "A work of art  does not substitute, but institutes an original awareness of existence,  on the whole; it does not so much reproduce and represent as produce  and present a total experience" (Kaufmann 1969: 147) . The Storyteller  doll as conceived and realized by Helen Cordero not only "materializes  a way of experiencing" and "brings a particular cast of mind out into  the world of objects , where men can look at it" (Geertz 1976: 1478) ,  [75]  </page> <page sequence="7"> Barbara A .  Babcock  but comments on and expands the premises of Pueblo existence . When  Helen Cordero re-created her grandfather in clay, it was one of those  "fecund moments" when an artist discovers a structure for her sen­ sibility and experience that "makes it manageable" for herself and "at  the same time accessible to others" (Merleau-Ponty 1964: 169) . It is ,  therefore, "in the tenor of its setting, " in the discourse that surrounds  it, that I have looked for both the sources and the consequences of  the powerful generative image that she created, asking, to paraphrase  Roy Wagner, how is Helen Cordero's invention related to a Cochiti  woman's perception of herself and her world ?5  All innovation involves a dialectic between convention and inven­ tion, and when Helen Cordero began making little people over twenty  years ago, she continued-with a difference-a centuries-old ceramic  tradition. For over a thousand years, Puebloan potters have shaped  the clay of the Southwest into representative human and animal forms  as well as utility ware . The majority of prehistoric, anthropomorphic  figurines are female, and on the basis of contextual archaeological  evidence as well as ethnographic data from the past century, archae­ ologists have conjectured that the Pueblo figurine complex was as­ sociated with reproductive ritual-both agricultural fertility cults and  rites of human increase .  6 Historic figures such as the mother and child  effigy made at Cochiti over one hundred years ago would seem to  confirm these connections (Figure 4. 4) .  Her dress is painted front and  back with com plant designs, and here, as throughout Pueblo ritual  and religion, the combination of painted and modeled design makes  explicit the relationship between human reproduction and other life­ giving forms of generation, especially corn . 7 The most sacred of all  ritual objects is a perfect ear of corn (i'a riko at Cochiti), decorated  with beads and feathers, and addressed as "Our Mother" (Parsons  1939: 182, 319-23) .  As the Anglo presence increased with the coming of the railroads  to New Mexico in the 1880s, the production of figures such as this  markedly decreased. Pueblo potters did not, however, hesitate to  capitalize on the growing tourist market, and, in addition to bowls  and jars , Cochiti women made for sale an abundance of small, desa­ cralized human and animal figures. Anglos bought and sold countless  "curiosities, " "idols , "  or "monos , "  but did not regard them highly or,  with the exception of Santa Fe dealer Jake Gold, encourage their  production . In the first half of this century, pottery production at  Cochiti, as in many other pueblos, declined. As Helen Cordero has  (76]  </page> <page sequence="8"> Figure 4.4. Mother and Child Effigy.

Babcock  said, For a long time pottery was silent in the pueblo . Nonetheless,  this ancient tradition endured, and among those few figurative forms  that continued to be made, the image of a woman holding or carrying  a child, or a water jar, or a bowl of bread was the most popular. In  the decade before Helen Cordero started up on little people, at least  three Cochiti potters were still making these singing ladies, singing  rrwthers, or madonnas (Figure 4 .5) .   By  the late 1950s, the six children that Helen had raised were grown,  and like other Cochiti women, she began doing bead and leatherwork  to make a little extra money. Unfortunately, most of the profits went  for buying more materials, and one day Fred Cordero' s aunt, Grandma  Juana, asked, Why don't you girls go back to potteries? You don't  have to buy anything. Mother Earth gives it all to you. And so, Helen  started on pottery with her kinswoman Juanita Arquero, who had  learned to make pottery as a child, and spent six months under her.  Her bowls and jars were all crooked and she despaired of ever getting  it right. Juanita suggested that she try figures instead and it was like  a flower blooming. She began with little animals, but was soon shaping  countless small standing and seated figures, many of them continuing  the Cochiti tradition of pottery mothers and children (Figure 4 .6) .   One of the first times Helen showed them out at  a Santo Domingo  feast day, folk art collector Alexander Girard bought all that she had  and asked her to make more and larger figures and bring them to his  home in Sante Fe. The first Storyteller (Figure 2) was made in response  to his request for a larger seated mother with more children . Helen  recalls , When I went home and thought about it, I kept seeing my  grandfather. That one, he was a really good storyteller and there were  always lots of us grandchildrens around him.  In addition to telling stories to his many grandchildren and being  esteemed in the pueblo as a gifted storyteller, the leader of one of  the clown societies ,  a "mucho sabio, "  and the most powerful of the  principales (the tribal council) , Santiago Quintana (Figure 4 .3) was the  valued friend and collaborator of several generations of anthropologists  and observers of Cochiti life: Adolph Bandelier, Frederick Starr,  Charles Saunders, Edward Curtis, and Ruth Benedict, who collected  many of the Tales of the Cochiti Indians ( 1931) from him and wrote  warmly of her "old man" in letters from the field. 8 When Helen Cor­ dero remembered her grandfather's voice and shaped that first image  of him telling stories to five grandchildren,  she made two significant  modifications in the "singing mother" tradition : (1)  she made the pri- [78]  </page> <page sequence="10"> �  ..:::.

In addition to embodying this  dialogic relationship between convention and invention, Storytellers  are obviously "about" relationships-between generations ,  between  past and future, and between stories and potteries (Figure 4. 7) . 9 Less  obviously, Helen's figures in particular are about the relationship be­ tween male and female creativity and the reproduction of the cultural  order, for her reinvention of this important mode of cultural production  and tradition of representation-pottery-making-controlled by  women transformed an image of natural reproduction into a figure of  an important mode of cultural reproduction-storytelling-that is con­ trolled by men and both embodies and expresses generativity.  From the body of the Storyteller sprout countless children and  grandchildren, and from his open mouth emerges "life for the people"  in the shape of stories ,  testifying yet again to Pueblo culture's instinct  for survival and its capacity to revitalize itself. 10 Whether one looks at  Pueblo worldview and its dynamics of cultural survival from the per­ spective of religion, kinship, pottery-making, or narrative traditions ,  one finds that Pueblo identity and individual and social integration  are conceived in terms of fertility and regeneration :  "One story is only  the beginning of many stories" (Silko 1981 :  56) ; clay images of domestic  animals are blessed and buried in the corral "so that there will be  more of them" (Parsons 1919: 279) and com, "the seed of seeds, "   multiplies itself many times from a single grain (Cushing 1920: 54) .  The history of the Storyteller is itself an expression of this reproductive  dynamic, for the first one was the beginning of countless little people.   Helen herself has made more Storytellers and won more prizes than  she can or will count-it's like breads, we don't count (Figure 7) . By  1973, when the "What Is Folk Art?" exhibit was mounted at the  Museum of International Folk Art in Santa Fe, the success and pop­ ularity of the Storyteller was such that at least six other Cochiti potters  had imitated her invention (Figure 4. 8). A decade later, no less than  fifty other Cochiti potters and over a hundred potters throughout the  New Mexico Pueblos were shaping Storytellers and related figurative  forms. Many of these imitations are female figures, and as far as Helen  is concerned, they are empathically not really Storytellers. They call  them Storytellers, but they don't know what it means. They don't  know it's after my grandfather. At home, no womens are storytellers!1 1  In the six years that I have known Helen, I have repeatedly heard  her insist upon both the ancestral and the masculine attributes of her  [ 8 1 )   </page> <page sequence="13"> Figure 4. 7.

Given the fact that both she and her mother (who was Esther  Goldfrank' s principal informant) tell stories ,  and that half of Ruth  Benedict's narrators were most assuredly female, why this assertion  that appears to contradict observed "fact"? And, why, I have asked  much more recently, given the obvious economic benefit to the  pueblo, did one of its officers try to persuade the tribal council to  forbid the well-known Cochiti Storyteller potters-all of whom are  women-from having exhibits of their work and from giving pottery­ making demonstrations at museums and national parks?  I would like to suggest that these two questions are not unrelated  and that answers to them provide clues as to the local significance of  Helen Cordero' s creativity and to the generative, transformative, and  dangerously liminal power of the image she invented. It seemed very  strange indeed that in the summer of 1982 the all-male tribal council  would have debated whether women potters should demonstrate the  making of Storytellers to Anglo tourists when extra income was sorely  needed to support summer ceremonials and when Pueblo pottery has  been made for an Anglo market for over a century. The more I con­ sidered this "social drama, " the more entangled I became in a com­ plicated situation involving the politics of reproduction and issues of  discourse and authority--of who has the right to represent what to  whom. Crises initiate reflexivity and this one forced me to realize that  I had naively assumed-as have other scholars of Pueblo ceramics­ that pottery and politics have nothing to do with each other. As I  contemplated conflict and clay, I began to see that Storytellers as  conceived and invented by Helen Cordero were not just pretty thing  made for money in terms of personal identification (All my potteries  come from my heart. They're  my little people, )  but were to be under­ stood in terms of the degree to which they resist and revise discursive  constraints . 12  When Helen Cordero insists upon the ancestral and masculine at­ tributes of her Storyteller, she is doing much more than emphasizing  the difference and uniqueness of her potteries .  She is both explicitly  and implicitly "authorizing" her creation . Explicitly, by invoking an­ cestral authority and power: It's my grandfather, he's giving me these.  He was a really wise man. He had lots of stories and lots of grand­ childrens, and we're all in there, in the clay. 13 Implicitly, by insisting  on the masculinity of her composite figure, and so identifying her  pottery with a sacred,  masculine activity-a tradition that is both  patriarchal and genealogical. Women do tell stories at Cochiti, but  (84]  </page> <page sequence="16"> At Home, No Womens Are Storytellers  they do not tell the stories-the master fictions by which the people  live . As Parsons (1939: 40) and many other Pueblo scholars have  pointed out, men and women have differential access to sacred dis­ course. Origin myths and legends as well as songs and drums and  kachinas and kivas and all the other aspects of sacred discourse, in­ cluding the ceremonial Keresan in which it is spoken, are controlled  by men. As Helen's uncle, Joe Trujillo, remarked several decades ago,  "Our kivas are like-how you say in English? Yes, like men's clubs.  The women are only admitted for certain ceremonies, but most of the  time we men are there alone. Religion is man's business with Indians"  (Mason 1948 : 85) .  If women are practically peripheral, they are symbolically central  to this "man's business" which involves, among other things , a tran­ scendental appropriation of the female principle . Pueblo religion is  elaborated around the idea of fertility and is indigenously described  as a vast, interconnected symbolic web at the center of which sits  Spider Woman, Thought Woman, the "mother of all" (Parsons 1939:  192-93) . Not surprisingly, the practice of religion involves both comic  and serious female impersonation . The cacique, or religious leader of  the pueblo, whose chief functions concern rain and fertility and the  well-being of his "children, "  is not only regarded as the representative  of Iyatiku, the Corn Mother; he is , after he is installed in office,  symbolically viewed as a woman and referred to in female terms.  14  The cacique is responsible for the spiritual and physical welfare of the  pueblo and he "takes care of his people by looking after 'his children'  just as the Mother (Iyatiku) whom he represents looked after the  images in her basket" (Parsons 1939: 336) . In Keresan emergence  narratives, Spider Woman sends Iyatiku ("bringing to life") and her  sister Nao'tsiti ("more of everything in the basket") up into the light,  to this earth with baskets crammed full of seeds and little clay images  and sacred cornmeal with which they create and pray into being all  forms of life. 15 The continued association of clay figures with the cre­ ation, maintenance, and reproduction of Pueblo life is this practice of  collectively representing Keresan townspeople in male and female clay  images which are kept and cared for by the cacique.  If Iyatiku' s clay figures are regarded as the embodiment of "life for  the people, "  so too are the stories about Iyatiku that are kept and told  by men such as Helen's grandfather. Both sacred and secular stories  were and are one of the primary modes in which the family, the clan,  and the community regenerates itself, for such narratives both describe  [85]  </page> <page sequence="17"> Barbara A .  Babcock  and create "chains" linking generation to generation and back again,  and involve what Silko describes as the vital dynamic of "bringing and  keeping the people together" (1981 :  59) . 16 In the words of contem­ porary Keresan storytellers, Leslie Silko and Simon Ortiz, "you don't  have anything if you don't have the stories" (Silko 1977: 2) and "the  only way to continue is to tell a story and there is no other way" (Ortiz  1977 : 9) . What is remarkable about these stories ,  past and present,  oral and written, is that the idea of fertility and the model of repro­ duction is re-presented again and again-in the language of and about  the stories ,  in their content, and in the embedded style in which they  are structured and told. Nowhere is this more manifest than in the  images of a grandfather storyteller, his belly full of"life for the people, "  giving birth to both children and stories that Leslie Silko and Helen  Cordero have created in words and in clay. (See, e . g. ,  Figure 4. 8 and  Silko's title poem in Ceremony, 1977: 2. )  Both cosmologically and socially, the Keres world is constructed of  a series of oppositions of which male vs. female is primary. 17 Given  the facts that woman is ideologically and symbolically central, that  clans are matrilineal, and that residence was traditionally matrilocal  at Cochiti, it has been fashionable, if not doctrinaire, to describe the  distribution of power as complementary and to ascribe to women much  more "real" power than they in fact have . 18 Once upon a time, a Cochiti  child received his social identity and physical place from his father. 19  But times have changed, and while a child is still of his mother's clan  and clans still fulfill a nurturant function, Cochiti clans and "clan  mothers" are far less important and powerful than they once were . 20  Wage labor, increased prosperity, and government housing have vir­ tually abolished matrilocal residence-a man who wants his own house  builds it. If one's livelihood does not depend on one's fields, the fact  that one's wife "owns" them matters little . And with Catholicism in  the Rio Grande Pueblos came absolute monogamy, greatly increasing  a man's status in the household and his power over his wife. 21 At the  same time, the two kiva organizations or moieties-Turquoise and  Pumpkin-are larger and more powerful than ever, and they are pa­ trilineal . Upon marriage, women become members of their husband's  kivas and assume the role of "helpers"; children take their father's  surname and belong to his kiva. Today, kiva membership is a much  more significant determinant of Cochiti social identity than clan  affiliation.  Man's business at Cochiti is political as well as religious , for the  [86]  </page> <page sequence="18"> At Home, No Womens Are Storytellers  Pueblo government is a theocracy. Supreme power resides with the  cacique and the heads of the three medicine societies who annually  choose the six major secular officers-governor and lieutenant gov­ ernor, war captain and lieutenant war captain, and fiscale and lieu­ tenant fiscale-who belong in equal numbers to the two kivas and  who become members of the tribal council for life. While the governor  controls secular affairs and the fiscale manages the Catholic church,  the war captains, who represent the mythic twin war gods, are the  "ceremonial police, " whose principal duties are preserving traditions  and secrets, and leading the fight against tribal enemies.  22  In sacred discourse and religious practice, in social and political  organization, and in domestic and family situations , the relationship  between the sexes is a classic example of female power and male  dominance . 23 For all their ascribed symbolic significance, Cochiti  women are, in Edwin Ardener's terms,  a "muted" rather than an  "articulate group, "  excluded from "the dominant communicative sys­ tem of the society-expressed as it must be through ideology and that  'mode of production' which is articulated with it" (1975: 22) . We don't  have any say about that are words I have heard from women at Cochiti  more times than I can count .  However, as Ardener and others have  pointed out, in a world in which discourse is controlled by men,  women's ideas or models of the world about them finds expression in  forms other than direct speech. But, as Ardener also notes, far too  few ethnographers have talked to women or deemed their modes of  expression worthy of investigation . This is true even in Pueblo studies  where, despite the fact that a larger than usual amount of ethnography  has been done by women, the overwhelming focus has been on male­ dominated discourse .   Frank Cushing, who was an iconoclast, and Ruth Bunzel, who was  a woman influenced by Boas's  insistence on the importance of art,  were exceptions to this male bias in their recognition that for gener­ ation upon generation of Pueblo women, pottery-making has been a  primary and privileged mode of expression . 24 In Pueblo life, potteries  are one of the few forms of"objective culture" that have been identified  with and created almost exclusively by women. 25 Traditionally, men  were associated with this mode of production, but excluded from the  transformative activities of shaping and firing clay. "In the beginning,  ltc'tinaku [Spider Woman] considered how the people should live, "  and sent her mother and father down to them as "Clay Old Woman  and Clay Old Man. " Clay Old Woman "began to coil a pot with her  (87]  </page> <page sequence="19"> Barbara A.  Babcock  clay, and Clay Old Man danced beside her singing while she worked"  (Benedict 1981 :  12) . "He" has continued to dance and sing, and "she"  has continued to shape the flesh of Mother Earth into ceremonial,  utilitarian, and commercial forms, talking to and thanking Grandma  Clay at every stage of the creative process.  As archaeologists have demonstrated, as Cushing so finely described  in "Zuni Breadstuff, " and as the Cochiti story about the origin of  pottery I have just quoted reflects, settled Pueblo existence as it  developed in the southwestern United States over 2,000 years ago and  was lived until the latter part of the nineteenth century was incon­ ceivable without rain, without the cultivation of com, and without  pottery to store water and grain . Clay was not only essential to life  but in traditional Pueblo belief was regarded as a living substance . A  pottery vessel was not thought of as an inert object but as a "made  being, " acquiring a kind of conscious and personal existence as it was  being made. "As a receptacle for water and food, it held, and was in  tum, a source of life" (Hardin 1983 : 33) , and the designs with which  it was painted had "one dominant theme, a prayer for rain for the  maturing crops" (Chapman 1950: 6) . Moreover, in the Keresan origin  myths I have already cited, innumerable forms of life originate as clay  images. In addition to the descendents of these clay people that the  cacique takes care of, human and animal ceramic figurines are asso­ ciated, both historically and prehistorically, with the idea of fertility,  with agricultural fertility cults, and with rites of human increase . 26 In  this worldview, the creation of babies and the generation of culture  are not only compatible,  they are inseparable; with both their bodies  and their hands,  women reproduce the cultural order.  If Pueblo ceramics were once a primary mode of production, they  were also and still are symbolic forms, containers of cultural value and  models of and for reproduction and regeneration . 27 Their potteries,  like their stories ,  their rituals, and their kinship system, connect the  reproductive aspect of generation with the cultural basis of thought,  transmission, and "in a different voice, "  clay sings . With the en­ croachment of an Anglo world and the expansion of an Anglo market  for Indian objects , pottery-making has become increasingly important  as mode of cultural survival and as a cultural voice, a statement of  ethnic identity. Potteries are, in Bourdieu's apt phrase, "symbolic  capital, " for "in a very real way, the survival of the craft symbolizes  the survival of the people" (Brody 1976: 76) . And, although ceramic  scholars have not talked about it in these terms, precisely because it  [88]  </page> <page sequence="20"> At Home, No Womens Are Storytellers  is "symbolic capital, " Pueblo pottery-making is an institutionalized  mechanism for consolidating and preserving female power. 28  Although women produce these necessary and symbolic vessels ,  men have traditionally controlled their distribution and marketing,  along with other forms of communication with the outside world. This  too is reflected in the Cochiti story about the origin of pottery as well  as in subsequent ethnographic accounts : after Clay Old Woman shaped  the clay, "the old man took the pot and gave a piece of it to everybody  in the village" (Benedict 1981 :  12). Since at least the fifteenth century,  "the exchange of pottery has played a considerable economic role in  Rio Grande Pueblo culture" (Snow 1973: 55),  and this trading has been  the business of men. Matilda Coxe Stevenson recorded the following  situation at Zia Pueblo in the late 1880s :  The Sia women labor industriously at the ceramic art as soon as their  grain supply becomes reduced, and the men carry the wares to their  unfriendly neighbors for trade in exchange for wheat and com. As long  as the Sia can induce the traders through the country to take their  pottery they refrain from barter with their Indian neighbors . The women  usually dispose of the articles to the traders, but they never venture  on expeditions to the Santa Ana and the Jemez. [ 1894: 1 1-12]  After 1880, the railroads and the influx of Anglos to the territory  created both an expanding "tourist" market for Pueblo pottery and  wage-labor jobs for men; women took increasing responsibility for  marketing the products of their labor. Predictably, there was resistance  to the latter, and as late as 1925, when Chapman, Halseth, and others  at the Museum of New Mexico were encouraging pottery "revivals , "   they discovered that the Santo Domingo Pueblo council did not want  Santo Domingo women to take their pottery to the newly instituted  Indian Fair in Sante Fe. Acculturation, automobiles, and the advent  of an Anglo "art" market that names and wants to know its Indian  artists has changed all that. Women still dominate the manufacture of  pottery-for example, of approximately two hundred figurative potters  in 1984, only twenty are men-but they have also assumed control of  its distribution, and have entered into a cash economy and the business  of communicating with the outside world-activities that were once  their husbands' prerogatives . While Pueblo pottery has continued to  be an important vehicle of identity maintenance, it has also become  a means of identity change and a crucial variable in the transition from  [89]  </page> <page sequence="21"> Barbara A. Babcock  a subsistence to a cash economy. 29 Both the fortunes of this ancient  craft in this century and the recent "social drama" centering on pottery  at Cochiti support the argument of several students of material culture  that the objectual aspects of a culture are both more conservative and  more innovative as well as more readily diffused than its behavioral  and ideological aspects . 30  In the remarkable revival of figurative pottery that Helen Cordero' s  Storyteller has engendered in the last twenty years , women potters  have done much more than reshape their traditional roles in terms of  economics , mobility, and communication . 3 1  By creating not only Sto­ rytellers, but Nightcriers , Drummers, Turtles, and other ceremonial  and mythic figures, and by exhibiting and demonstrating their art,  they have assumed the right to re-present and interpret to the outside  world at least some of the aspects of the very discourse in which they  are displaced. Both endorsing and challenging men's ideological he­ gemony, a clay Storyteller is a woman's visual re-creation of a man's  verbal and symbolic representations of a woman's biological experi­ ence . It is her re-appropriation both of her own symbolic power and  his right to articulate it. The very gender ambiguity of Storytellers­ both presentational and perceptual-is a statement of competing in­ terests in the terrain of symbolic production . At home, no womens are  storytellers, but women are potters and with the transformative power  of their hands , they have contrived to tell stories about storytelling,  to subvert masculine discursive control, and profoundly to disturb the  distribution of power. In this case, the struggle between the powerless  and the powerful has been displaced quite literally onto the surface  of things . It would seem, in terms of Bauman' s reformulation of the  distinction between static and dynamic cultures, that the sociocultural  system at Cochiti-and probably in other pueblos as well-is changing  from a static one "in which rights to signs are derivative from social  position" to a dynamic one "in which social position is derivative from  the possession of signs" (Bauman 1971 :  287) .  Helen Cordero and her sisters are manipulating considerably more  than clay. They are reproducing "with a difference, " and they are  figuratively as well as literally playing with fire .  Helen teases me a  lot, and on one recent occasion, I couldn't resist the temptation to  give her a hard time about her fancy new Frigidaire Harvest Gold  ice-dispensing refrigerator. She stopped making tortillas , turned from  the stove-which she had also just replaced with a new Magic Chef  because the old one's self-cleaning oven had ruined the potteries that  [90]  </page> <page sequence="22"> At Home, No Womens Are Storytellers  she was preheating before firing them outside in the old way, the right  way-and said quite seriously, I'm getting me what I always wanted.  And, she has empowered three generations of other Pueblo women  to do the same, to reshape their lives and the roles traditionally allotted  to them.  Clearly, Evans-Pritchard talked to very different "primitive women"  from the ones that I have-if he talked to them at all-and just as  clearly the tribal official's attempt to silence them reflects the highly  authoritarian nature of Pueblo society and bespeaks a recognition that  continuity over time is a political as well as a biological and cultural  problem.  32 Although his motives were reportedly baser, in acting as  he did that official was re-asserting the traditional Pueblo male right  to mediate with the outside world and protect what he deems sacred  discourse as well as attempting to reinvoke an ancient male prerogative  to appropriate and control female generativity and creativity. It was ,  you can almost hear him saying, one thing for old Santiago Quintana  to travel to California or to share his culture and its stories with  Bandelier and Benedict; it is quite another for his granddaughter to  hop a plane in Albuquerque, and to make Storytellers , and to talk  about her grandfather and his stories in Denver. Times have changed,  and this time he lost his case against the women, but that's another  story . . . . 33   Notes  1. For discussion and documentation of the Storyteller revolution, see Babcock  1983 and Babcock and Monthan 1986.  2. This statement and others that follow in italic type were made by Helen Cordero  in conversations between 1978 and 1984. When we began to work on the story of her  life and art, she insisted that she would not spill the beans, and I have not discussed  sacred discourse or social and ceremonial organization with her or any other Cochitis.  The information about these matters in this essay was obtained from already published  accounts by various observers of Cochiti and Keresan life in the past century and from  conversations with anthropologists who lived and worked at Cochiti under very dif­ ferent constraints in previous decades.  3. For a general theory of the nature of innovation and the consequences of and  conditions for the appearance of novel ideas, see Barnett 1953.  4. Many of these points are made by Judith Modell in her discussion of Zuni  Mythology. She argues that Benedict's achievement in this and "other folklore pieces,  was to incorporate a notion of imaginativeness into the study of culture" (Modell 1983:  243).  5. Much of my argument, in addition to this statement, is indebted to Roy Wagner's  [9 1 ]   </page> <page sequence="23"> Barbara A .

For further discussion of both prehistoric and historic Pueblo figurative pottery  traditions, see Babcock and Monthan 1986.  7. For an encyclopedic inventory of Pueblo religion, see Parsons 1939. For dis­ cussions of fertility as the root metaphor or master trope of Pueblo culture, see es­ pecially Haeberlin 1916, Cushing 1920, and Benedict 1934. See also Black 1984 for  an analysis of Hopi com metaphors.  8. For descriptions of Santiago Quintana, see Benedict's Preface to Tales of the  Cochiti Indians (1931 :  xi) and her letter of 5 September 1925 to Margaret Mead (Mead  1973: 300).  9. In his important essay "Style, Grace, and Information in Primitive Art, " Bateson  argues that it is probably an error to think of art as being about any one matter other  than relationship (1973: 254-55).  10. For discussion of the Pueblo capacity for revitalization, the dynamics of cultural  survival, and the importance of art therein, see A. Ortiz 1976 and Brody 1976, 1979.  The description of stories as "life for the people" is from the title poem of Leslie Silko' s  novel Ceremony (1977: 2).  1 1 .  The image of a large composite figure covered with smaller versions of itself  universally connotes reproduction and, by implication, femaleness. Not surprisingly,  Helen's Storytellers have been perceived as female both by Anglo consumers and by  Pueblo potters who have imitated her invention. In his suggestive essay "Levels of  Communication and Taboo in the Appreciation of Primitive Art ,"  Leach argues that  punning, particularly sexual ambiguity, is very common in art forms:  "My general  proposition is that all true artists tend to devote their principal efforts to themes which  contain elements of sensory ambiguity and are subject to taboo . . . . W hen we examine  the products of exotic cultures the confusions which first fascinate us are those which  have a physiological base, they are the confusions between male and female, between  food and not food, between symbols of dominance and symbols of submission" (1973:  230, 234).  12. For discussion of Helen's potteries as autobiographical statements, as shaping  and shaped from personal experience, see "Modeled Selves" (Babcock 1985) . See  Turner 1980 for discussion of social dramas and stories about them.  13. Lange (1968: 232) has this to say about ancestral power: "A fundamental belief  in the religious orientation of the Cochiti is that supernatural power is believed to be  held by certain individuals at specific times because these powers have been trans­ mitted to cultural predecessors from supernatural beings during various eras of the  past. The specific powers vary in accordance with the person's official capacity, or  status, and also to the extent to which he is worthy of that status . "  14. See especially Fox's discussion of the term yaya ("mother"), which is used both  for the cacique and his stone fetish (1967: 143) .  15. For transcriptions, summaries ,  and interpretations of Keresan emergence nar­ ratives, see Benedict 1981,  Boas 1928, Dumarest 1918, Forde 1930, Parsons 1939,  Sebag 1971, Stevenson 1894, Stirling 1942, and White 1932a, 1932b, 1935, 1942, 1962.  The motif of creation through the molding of meal, dust, or clay is not limited to origin  myths, but is widely found throughout Pueblo narratives.  16. For a very suggestive Jungian analysis of the importance of "chains" of gener­ ations, etc. , in creation myths as a way of being linked "with historical continuity, i . e . ,  from the inside, with one's ancestral soul, to be connected with the archetype foun­ dations of the psyche, as counter-magic against dissociation, "  see von Franz 1978.  17. Pueblo "world structure, "  as a "relentlessly connected universal whole" in which  "men, animal, plants, and spirits are intertransposable in a seemingly unbroken chain  [92)   </page> <page sequence="24"> At Home, No Womens Are Storytellers  of being, " constructed in terms of a series of oppositions (A. Ortiz 1972: 143), is  something of a structuralist's dream. For a structural analysis of Tewa worldview, see  A. Ortiz 1969; of Keres through their creation myths, see Sebag 1971 .   18 .  The position one ascribes to women in Pueblo society depends significantly on  whether one focuses on ideology or on praxis. As Bennett and others have remarked,  those interpretations (e. g. , Benedict) that center on the ideology, which Bennett calls  "organic, " view Pueblo culture and society as integrated and harmonious. Those (e.g. ,  Goldfrank) who focus on the praxis, which he calls "repressive, "  emphasize the tension,  conflict, and fear of Pueblo life, and the extent to which the individual (male or female)  is suppressed and repressed (Bennett 1946: 361-74 ). The truth, I suspect, is somewhere  in between, and one must look at the position of women in both ideology and praxis .   On the basis of crosscultural evidence, including Alice Schlegel's Hopi work, Peggy  Sanday argues (1981 :  1 14) that "female economic and political power is ascribed as a  natural right due the female sex when a long-standing magico-religious association  between maturity and fertility of the soil associates women with social continuity and  the social good. " I would respond, not necessarily so, especially not in increasingly  acculturated situations which have modified both the social and religious position of  women, and certainly not among the Keresan Pueblos.  19. For discussion of the "manly/womanly dichotomy" in terms of which the Keres  order their world and of the anthropology of Keres identity, see Miller 1972. See also  Austin 1983 for discussion of the relationship between house and kiva.  20. For discussion of Cochiti clans, their curing and nurturant functions, their  declining importance, and concomitant changes in Cochiti social organization, see Fox  1967, 1973.  21 .  In discussing Pueblo attitudes toward innovation in 1949, John Collier observed:  "With Christianity, in the Rio Grande Pueblos, came the morality and custom of  indissoluble marriage. It was a radical innovation, and apparently was welcomed by  the males because it increased their status and power: the men no longer dwelt in the  kiva, but lived in his [sic J children's home as co-head of the establishment. The absolute  prohibition of divorce became a custom, guarded as such by the officials and priests  of the ancient Pueblo religions" (1949: 51). For further crosscultural discussion of the  decline in indigenous female power with colonialism, see Sanday 1981 :  chap. 7.  22. For discussions ofCochiti social and ceremonial organization and changes therein  between the early 1920s and the early 1950s, see Goldfrank 1927, Lange 1968, and  Fox 1967.  23. Here and elsewhere, I am following Friedl's definition of "male dominance" as  "a situation in which men have highly preferential access, although not always exclusive  rights, to those activities to which the society accords the greatest value, and the  exercise of which permits a measure of control over others" (1975: 7) .  24. In particular, see Cushing 1886, 1920, and Bunzel 1972 [1929) for discussion  of the meanings, uses, and importance of pottery in Pueblo life.  25. Simmel describes "objective culture" as the world of cultural forms and their  artifacts that have become independent of individual human existence. Objective  culture is the domain of objects that function as instruments for the cultivation of  the person, or as conditions under which he can become a cultural being. He  observes that objective culture is overwhelmingly a product of male activity and  that, with few exceptions, the artifacts of culture represent the objectification of the  male spirit. In his insightful discussion of "Female Culture," and the ways in which  female psyche "becomes visible, "  he notes that "we should expect from women a  special interpretation and mode of forming phenomena in the plastic arts" (1984: 6- 7, 22, 83) .  26. See Parsons 1918, 1919, and 1939 for beliefs and practices associated with rites  (93]  </page> <page sequence="25"> Barbara A .  Babcock  of increase, and the use of clay figures therein. For further discussion, see Babcock  and Monthan 1986.  27. Here and elsewhere, I am indebted to Annette Weiner's "model of reproduc­ tion, "  derived in part from Bourdieu, which she has developed in several essays (1978,  1979, 1980, 1982) and which is based on the premise "that any society must reproduce  and regenerate certain elements of value in order for the society to continue . . . . T hese  elements of value include human beings, social relations, cosmological phenomena  such as ancestors, and resources such as land, material objects, names, and body  decorations" (1980: 71) .  Within this model, she distinguishes between "reproduction, "   referring to cultural attention and meaning given to acts of forming, producing, or  creating something new, and "regeneration, "  referring to the cultural attention and  meaning given to the renewal, revival, rebirth, or recreation of entities previously  reproduced. More recently, she has formulated the notion of "elementary cycling, "  by which she means "the cultural configuration of the state of affairs that encompass  birth, growth, decay, death, and regeneration . . . . T he life cycle of individuals, now  understood as those processes which attach relations and objects to an ego and detach  them at other times from other egos, cannot be separated analytically from the societal  configuration wherein the natural phenomena of birth, growth, decay, and death are  culturally circumscribed . . . . I n this way, the configuration of elementary cycling is  the basic logical form out of which integration between the individual and society takes  place" (1982: 10). Whatever else it may be, the Storyteller as conceived and created  by Helen Cordero is the embodiment of elementary cycling. I am also indebted to  Meillassoux' s Marxist analysis of precapitalist formation in which he argues that "ag­ ricultural self-sustaining formations described here . . . r ely less on the control of the  means of material production than on the means of human reproduction: subsistence  and women. Their end is reproduction of life as a precondition to production. Their  primary concern is to 'grow and multiply' in the biblical sense . . . . T he relations of  production are established between 'those who come before' and 'those who come  after' " (1972: 100-102) .  28. For further crosscultural discussion of institutionalized mechanisms "for con­ solidating and conserving female power during colonialization, " see Sanday 1981 :  37  and passim.  29. For further discussion of the value of Pueblo pottery in the transition from a  subsistance to a cash economy and the importance of the Acoma pottery-making tra­ dition for women's economic survival, see Reynolds 1986.  30. See, in particular, Barnett 1953, Graburn 1976, and Dawson, Frederickson,  and Graburn 1974.  31 .  For further discussion of the Storyteller revolution and the development and  diffusion of this new genre of Pueblo pottery, see Babcock 1983 and Babcock and  Monthan 1986.  32. In addition to Weiner 1978, 1979, 1980, see O'Brien 1981 ,  Paige and Paige  1981 ,  and Zelman 1977 for further discussion of the "politics" of reproduction. There  is abundant evidence and discussion of the highly authoritarian nature of Pueblo  society and the power exerted by the religious hierarchy, but see especially Goldfrank  1945, Ellis 1953, Dozier 1961 ,  and Fox 1973. See also Meillassoux 1972: 100-102  for a Marxist perspective on the politics of reproduction. He argues that in "agri­ cultural self-sustaining formations [which Pueblo society once was) concern for re­ production becomes paramount . . . [ and] reproduction of the unit, both biologically  and structurally, is assured through the control of women . . . . T he shift from production  for self-sustenance and self-perpetuation to production for an external market, must  necessarily bring a radical transformation, if not the social destruction of the  communities . "   [94]  </page> <page sequence="26"> At Home, No Womens Are Storytellers  33. In conclusion, my thanks to Helen Cordero, who has shared her life and her  work with me and changed my life in the process, and to Susan Aiken, with whom I  have shared the experience and the interpretation of mutedness. Cochiti Pueblo is  not a place where the politics of reproduction are discussed as such, and feminist  anthropologists have been rightly cautioned both against projecting our own political  concerns and theoretical models onto our analyses of the position of women in other  cultures and against using data about women there to buttress arguments about women  here. Nonetheless,  if we are not attuned to gender dynamics and the politics of  discourse in the cultures we are studying, as well as in our own, we will perpetrate  such idealistic and projective distortions as the ideas that simpler societies are not  contaminated by sexual politics and that potteries and politics have nothing to do with  each other. Finally, my apologies for being both unable and unwilling to give a more  detailed account of what transpired at the tribal council.
