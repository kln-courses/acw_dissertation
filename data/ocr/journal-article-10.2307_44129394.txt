<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE SCOPE OF MICHAEL FRIED S CRITICISM by Bruce Boice In most of his recent writings, Michael Fried refers back to his earlier essays "Shape as Form"1 and "Art and Object- hood."2 Usually, the reference appears in his text as a summary of conclusions already drawn and implicitly established as true. Such a summary constitutes a third of his recent essay "Larry Poons' New Paintings" (Artforum, March, 1972). But in the Poons essay, Fried goes further: He not only summarizes the arguments of his two previous touchstone essays but discusses the last ten years of modernist painting strictly in their terms. Fried makes his prophecy self-fulfilling. Five years ago, in the two essays, he defined the straight and narrow terms for successful painting. Now, in retrospect, he sees successful painting strictly within those terms. Whatever lies outside those terms, for Fried, lies outside of what he calls "quality." In an essay ironically adjacent to Fried's on Larry Poons, Leo Steinberg writes of the formalist critics' habit "that tells an artist what he ought not to do, and the spectator what he ought not to see."3 Fried goes further: He not only tells the artist what he ought to do but precisely what he must do. Five years later, he sees "quality" exclusively in works where obedience to his com- mands is evident. However, it is not enough to show Fried's scope as extreme- ly narrow; what I want to show is that the terms of the narrowness are not justi- fied. Because of Fried's insistence on the centrality of "Shape as Form" and "Art and Objecthood" to his subsequent writ- ings, it is necessary to examine the pro- gress of his arguments and the nature of their internal relationships and external applications, as presented in these two key essays. Initially, in "Shape as Form," Fried attempts to show the progress of modern- ist painting as the primacy of literal shape over depicted shape, that literal shape has come to dominate depicted shape in given modernist paintings and in modernist painting in general. By literal shape, Fried and generally occur within the literal means the shape of the canvas and the painting's support. Depicted shapes are shapes drawn or painted on the canvas shape. To support his claim, Fried intro- duces Frank Stella's Aluminum Series (1960) paintings, asserting that "Stella was able to make the fact that literal shape determines the structure of the entire painting completely perspicuous."4 Fried attempts to establish the literalist implications of Stella's early work, so that his later, irregular polygons, as well as the work of Kenneth Noland and Jules Olitski, can be seen as a repudiation of literalist implications, moving toward Fried's notion of a painting's defeating or suspending its own objecthood through the medium of shape. I do not deny the literalist implications of Stella's early work, or that there might have been a movement by Noland and Olitski away from them, but I shall argue the nature of those implications in Stella's work, and that his move to the irregular polygons meant a repudiation of literalist implica- tions. 77</page><page sequence="2">That in Stella's aluminum paintings "the literal shape determines the struc- ture of the entire painting" is not true. In fact, it is only by the painting's entire structure, the depiction, determining the literal shape that Stella radically breaks with convention. Stella described the con- ception of the aluminum paintings as being composed initially within a rec- tangle, with "leftover boxes" remaining at the corners, until he decided, at Darby Bannard's suggestion, to cut the boxes out. Once the aluminum series was well under way, Stella described the relation- ship of depicted to literal shape as being "completely reversible."5 In the alumi- num paintings, there is no reason to assume the depicted shape was generated by the literal shape of the canvas. Fried made the assumption, and, once made, the assumption became fact. Further- more, if Stella's aluminum paintings had asserted the primacy of literal over de- picted shape by generating the structure of the paintings, they were not, by that, radical or even a departure from conven- tion. In nearly the entire history of paint- ing, depicted shape has been dominated by literal shape. The first break with the dominance of literal shape occurred in Jasper Johns' Flags , where the recogniz- ability of the depicted shape fit with such a vengeance into the canvas' literal shape that the two became identical. Stella's Black Senes (1959) paintings accom- plished essentially the same thing by abstract means. By making literal and depicted shapes equally interrelate, both Stella and Johns neutralized the domi- nance of literal shape. The aluminum paintings actually reverse the convention by freeing depicted shape from the re- strictions of the literalist rectangle. The aluminum paintings showed, as did the following shaped-canvas boom, that de- piction needn't fit into an alien literal shape. Certainly, this development cre- ated a new attention to the canvas' actual shape and a new emphasis on the relation- ship between literal and depicted shape. Freeing depicted shape from literal shape established literal shape as a variable in painting, and the possibility to consider shape as form became red. However, Fried's conception of shape as form and the relationship between literal and depicted shape is quite dif- ferent. For Fried, shape becomes an issue first in Stella's aluminum paintings, in which, as Fried asserts, the literal shape dominates and determines the nature of the paintings. The primacy of literal shape is seen as a threat that paintings may cease being paintings and may be- come merely objects. According to Fried, it was this threat of implicit objecthood in Stella's aluminum paintings that made it "imperative that it [modernist paint- ing] defeat or suspend its own object- hood, and that the crucial factor in this undertaking is shape, but shape that must Frank Stella, Newstead Abbey , aluminum paint on canvas (120x72 in.), 1960. Courtesy Stede- lijk Museum, Amsterdam. belong to painting- it must be pictorial, not, or not merely, literal."6 What it means for a painting to "hold or stamp itself out or compel conviction as shape"7 is never made explicit in "Shape as Form." One can sense how most, if not all, of Stella's metallic paint- ings, such as Leo Castelli or Ileana Sonna- bend of 1963, stamp themselves out as shape as they seem stamped out by a cookie-cutter. But this is clearly not what Fried had in mind, as these paintings, and others like them, call attention to their objecthood. In fact, these paintings carry the threat that makes it imperative for a painting to defeat objecthood. For a painting to hold as shape would mean that the painting be legible as shape and emphasize shape as an element in the painting. The words "hold or stamp itself out as shape" are not very precise and, if anything, counter to Fried's argument; but what he means by these words be- comes clearer in his discussion of Jules Olitski. According to Fried, Olitski's paintings, having almost no depicted shape, rely for their success entirely on their ability to stamp themselves out as shape. Fried feels Olitski's narrow vertical paintings succeed but the squarer and horizontal paintings do not. "This is connected with the fact that when the early spray paintings fail- relatively speaking- we tend to see the framing edge as marking the limits of a spatial container, and the sprayed canvas itself as something like background in traditional painting. The narrow vertical format somehow keeps this from happen- ing, not by denying the illusion but, so to speak, by making it self-sufficient, a pres- ence, like that of a human figure, instead of a void waiting to be filled."8 What Fried seems to mean here is that in the horizontal paintings the eyes are drawn to the center of the painting, as with a deep-space void; but, in the vertical paint- ings, the eye begins in the center and moves out from it, focusing on the edges. In later paintings, Olitski emphasizes this further by masking off a section or sec- tions at the canvas' edge, often a corner, which Fried calls an internal frame. These internal frames, according to Fried, are the only depicted shapes in the spray paintings and act as intermediaries be- tween the literal edge of the canvas and the internal sprayed surface. Olitski pre- sents a situation of a deep-space void that tends to draw our eyes to the center and, at the same time, forces our attention to the edge, to the literal shape of the painting. Now, what it means for a paint- ing to hold as shape is fairly clear. It means a given painting forces our atten- tion to its literal edges and establishes a conflict between the literal edges and what is between them. But it still is not clear that a painting's success or failure depends on its stamping itself out as shape. I understand the issue as an interesting one for painting, but not as an imperative. Fried refers to "Shape as Form" as "notes"; ironically, these "notes" contain a dictum on which the success or failure of a given painting and painting in general is said to depend. After an interesting, perceptive dis- cussion of the interrelationship of literal to depicted shape in Stella's irregular polygons, Fried asserts that the series, such as Moultonboro , Tuftonboro , and Chocorua , series in which a triangular shape seems to cut into a square or generally rectangular shape, are relatively unsuccessful because the strong gestalt of the triangle dominates the irregular shape. More successful for Fried are the Wolfe- boro and Effingham series, paintings with only irregular shapes, and, therefore, no one shape dominates. Here, Fried, in arguing success or failure, no longer dis- cusses the interrelationship or conflict of literal and depicted shape. What Fried argues now is good old-fashioned compo- sition, relational painting, balanced de- sign. Fried concludes that, with the irregu- lar polygons, Stella has turned from the literalist implications of his earlier work. Stella's new paintings, then, depart from his stripe paintings in two general respects- first, by not acknowledging literal shape, and second, by resorting to illusion- both of which ought to make them unpalatable to literalist sensibility. And indeed I want to suggest that it is one of the most significant facts about his new pictures that Stella seeks in them to repudiate- not literalist taste or sensibility exactly- but the literalist implica- tions, which, in the grip of a particular conception of the nature of Modernist painting, his stripe paintings appear to carry.9 78</page><page sequence="3">Frieďs assertion that the irregular poly- gons "depart from his stripe paintings . . . by not acknowledging literal shape" is problematic. Fried's grounds are that the actual shape of the canvas, its silhouette, is difficult to grasp as a single shape because of the nature of the depiction within it. Moreover, the fact that the physical limits of the support do not make themselves felt as a single entity, but, in effect, belong segment by segment to individual shapes the remainder of whose limits do not coincide with those of the support implies a strong and, I think, unprecedented continuity be- tween the "outside" of a given painting (its physical limits) and its "inside" (everything else).10 Because of this implied "continuity between the 'outside' and its 'inside,' " this mutual dependency, this illusive equal interrelationship, Fried concludes that a tie goes to the inside. The primary departure from the stripe paintings is that depiction suggests literal shape, i.e., the suggestion of a rectangle in Chocorua /, where none actually occurs; whereas, in the stripe paintings, the literal shape sug- gests and becomes depiction. In the irreg- ular polygons, I do not see how this mutual interdependency of depicted and literal shape constitutes a case for the paintings' not acknowledging literal shape. The paintings not only acknowl- edge literal shape but clearly made literal shape their issue. When one first looks at an irregular polygon, it is all literal shape; only after close inspection does one see this is not the case. It is important for Fried to establish that the irregular poly- gons do not acknowledge literal shape, for only then can he show Stella's repudi- ation of the literalist implications of his stripe paintings; if this can be established, then Fried can claim Stella has turned from "shape as a fundamental property of objects" toward "shape that belongs to painting." However, there is no contra- diction in the two notions of shape. Stella, by calling attention to literal shape, or "shape as a fundamental prop- erty of objects," did so by making literal shape a variable in painting. In fact, there is evidence that the literalist implications of Stella's stripe paintings were not repudiated by his later work. In 1967, the year he finished the irregular polygon series, Stella made Sangre de Christo , a 42-foot-long stripe painting. While this is not conclusive, it shows that any serious repudiation on Stella's part is unlikely. Fried's premise that Stella's irregular polygons repudiate the literalist implications of his earlier work assumes change to mean repudi- ation. Change means change, and not necessarily anything else. I suggest the reasons for Stella's change are closer to the changes Stella brought to painting in the first place. The relational painting of European tradition and the gestural brushwork of recent American painting were "used up, something's done, some- thing's over with, what's the point of getting involved with it?11 For Stella, there was no point in exploring familiar ground. Stella applied his own "used up, done with" remarks to the stripe paint- ings and began new work; the change involved not repudiation but "moving on." A fairly consistent pattern of change is obvious in Stella's work from the begin- ning in 1958 through 1972. He has moved from severe reduction toward a complexity of elements that create a visu- al intricacy that makes the paintings con- tinually more difficult to grasp as wholes. Stella's direction is clear even in the transition from the black paintings to the aluminum paintings, which assume the additional concern of variable shape. Given Stella's starting point, the severely reductive black paintings, his direction of change could not be otherwise. That Stella, through all his work, has shown an interest in the relationship of literal to depicted shape seems obvious; but there is no evidence he has shown an interest in defeating or suspending literalism or objecthood. What evidence exists is double-edged: A case can be made that the thickness of the support of Stella's paintings emphasizes their surfaces; as good a case can be made that the thick- ness of the support calls attention to the paintings' objecthood. If Stella's move is not seen as a move away from literalist implications but as a move away from an exhausted situation, his example clearly does not support Fried's argument that it is imperative that modernist painting defeat or suspend its own objecthood. It is perhaps interesting when modernist painting applies itself to that issue, but nothing has been brought forward to show it is "imperative" or a necessity that painting do so. In "Art and Objecthood," Fried uses the writings of Robert Morris, Donald Judd, and Tony Smith, or what he sees as flaws in their writings, to support his arguments. This enterprise brings with it the problems of criticizing work through writing rather than criticizing the work itself, coupled with an additional problem hinted at in a footnote: I should add that in laying out what seems to me the position Judd and Morris hold in common I have ignored various differences between them, and have used certain re- marks in contexts for which they may not have been intended. Moreover, I have not always indicated which of them actually said or wrote a particular phrase; the alter- native would have been to litter the text with footnotes.12 A new problem arises here. The remarks of three different artists aure treated as though they were made by one artist. When the often unidentified remarks of Judd or Morris conflict with Tony Smith's, the conflict appears a contradic- tion rather than what it is, a disagree- ment. Although these three artists' works have similarities, the result of their blend- ed remarks into one voice makes Judd responsible for what Morris and Smith say, and so on. By blending the remarks, Fried finds contradictions that make all the writings seem invalid. Since there are contradictions within the literalist posi- tion, Fried concludes that the literalist position is invalid. All Fried actually shows is that three artists, whose works share certain common interests, disagree on issues. "Art and Objecthood" gets off to a rather slow, disjointed start. At the end of the second section of the essay, Fried sets up his argument: There is, in any case, a sharp contrast between the literalist espousal of object- Frank Stella, The Marriage of Reason and Squalor , oil on canvas (94%xl32% in.), 1959.

In fact, from the perspective of recent modernist painting, the literalist position evinces a sensibility not simply alien but antithetical to its own: as though, from that perspective, the demands of art and the conditions of objecthood are in direct con- flict. Here the question arises: What is it about objecthood as projected and hypostatized by the literalists that makes it, if only from the perspective of recent modernist paint- ing, antithetical to art?13 The question assumes that the object- hood espoused by the literalists is anti- thetical to art from the perspective of recent modernist painting. Fried's ques- tion asks why this is true, not whether it is true. It is critical to examine the origins of Fried's assumption. Fried quotes a passage from Clement Greenberg, in which he discusses the "look of non-art" when suddenly the "condition of non- art" is introduced without warning or explanation.14 Fried asserts it is the "condition of non-art" he calls "object- hood." The distinction between the "look of non-art" and the "condition of non-art" is important, for that which has the look of non-art does not necessarily embody the condition of non-art. A work with the look of non-art appears unlike what is currently considered art; a work having an art look is recognized as art by its conformity to certain current art con- ventions, i.e., a painting on stretched canvas. All the "look of non-art" means is it looks different from what we expect art to look like. The "condition of non- art" is quite different, however; for a work to have the condition of non-art is for it to be non-art. Again, Greenberg is quoted in reference to literalist art: "Yet it would seem that a kind of art nearer the condition of non-art could not be envisaged or ideated at this moment."15 But Greenberg's not being able to en- visage something nearer the condition of non-art than literalist art does not mean literalist art has the condition of non-art. Fried calls objecthood the condition of non-art, but he offers neither support nor explanation for doing so. He simply moves from Greenberg's not being able to envisage something nearer the condition of non-art to saying the condition of non-art is objecthood. The closest Fried comes to presenting a case for objecthood as non-art is through a series of sentences introduced by the phrase "It is as though. . . ." The antithetical relationship between the objecthood of literalist art and mod- ernist painting's self-imposed imperative to defeat its own objecthood depends on Fried's own self-imposed imperative. Fried's only evidence for this imperative are his examples of Olitski and Stella in "Shape as Form." Ironically, that which Frank Stella, Chocorua /, acrylic on canvas (120x128 in.), 1965-66. Courtesy Los Angeles County Museum of Art. for Fried constitutes Olitski's success, i.e., that his paintings hold as shape by de- veloping the conflict between the literal edge of the canvas and the illusion within, can be applied as well to Stella's early stripe paintings, the very paintings whose implications modernist painting has set out to defeat. For certainly this conflict of inside and outside, of literal shape to depiction, is nowhere in greater evidence than in Stella's aluminum paintings. Here, the meaning and validity of the phrase "modernist painting's self-imposed im- perative that it defeat or suspend its own objecthood" is brought into question. For in light of the evidence, modernist painting has not imposed that impera- tive on itself: Fried has imposed the imperative on modernist painting. The question Fried then poses- "What is it about objecthood as projected and hypo- statized by the literalists that makes it, if only from the perspective of recent mod- ernist painting, antithetical to art?"- is loaded with problems and subtly mislead- ing, and the same is true of his answer: "The answer I want to propose is this: the literalist espousal of objecthood amounts to nothing other than a plea for a new genre of theatre; and theatre is now the negation of art."16 Fried pins his entire argument against literalism on the fact that literalism is theatrical, and that theater is hostile to and negates art. First, by equating the notion of literalist presence with stage presence, he shows literalism is theatrical. Fried argues: If literalist presence is like stage-presence in that they both involve a kind of "presence," then, since stage- presence has to do with theater, literalist presence has to do with theater. His argument is patently invalid. "Stage- presence" signifies confidence on stage. The experience of presence in literalist art is the experience of existence itself. The literalist object is not a special object and is not intended to be admired as such; rather than a special object, it is a specific object, a box not unlike other boxes. The specific object occupies a specific space in a specific moment in time that no other object occupies at that moment; this is all that distinguishes the literalist object from any other object. What literalist art deals with is the phenomenology of existence, not stage- presence. To support his argument further that literalist art is theatrical, Fried tries to establish that literalist art is latently anthropomorphic in its espousal of the concept of presence: "By the same token, however, what is wrong with literalist work is not that it is anthropomorphic but that the meaning and, equally, the hiddenness of its anthropomorphism are incurably theatrical."1 7 Fried accom- plishes latent anthropomorphism for liter- alist art by a reversal of "persons" and "objects" in the proposition that persons have presence in the same way objects have presence. But the terms cannot validly be reversed, for persons are ob- 80</page><page sequence="5">jects but objects are not necessarily people. To say objects have presence in the same way people do is to say the world, not just literalist objects, is latent- ly anthropomorphic, which is nonsense. From his premise that to unexpectedly encounter literalist objects in a darkened room is disquieting,18 Fried concludes that literalist objects are latently anthro- pomorphic; but to experience any object in a darkened room may be equally dis- quieting, and nothing is said about literal- ist objects in particular. All this says is that the world is "incurably theatrical," for inevitably, what is said about literalist objects applies to all objects. Fried pre- sents no evidence that theater negates art. In "Shape as Form," Fried explains the success of the narrow vertical Olitski paintings: "The narrow vertical format somehow keeps this from happening: not by denying the illusion but, so to speak, by making it self-sufficient, a presence, like that of a human figure, instead of a void waiting to be filled."19 In Olitski's case, Fried inexplicably sees latent anthropomorphism as a positive quality. The contradiction is blatant: In Fried's own terms, it can be concluded that the narrow vertical Olitski painting that "holds or stamps itself out as shape" and, through the medium of shape, follows "modernist painting's self-imposed im- perative that it defeat or suspend its own objecthood" is in its "meaning and, equally, the hiddenness of its anthropo- morphism" "incurably theatrical," and "theatre is now the negation of art." What for Fried constitutes the most suc- cessful paintings is the same thing that constitutes the theatrical quality of liter- alist art. This contradiction voids either the argument for modernist painting's self-imposed imperative or the argument against literalist art as theater. When Fried says literalist art is theater and therefore the negation of art, he means, though it never gets said, that literalist objects- by existing in a physical situation and calling attention to what that means, and because they are not objects for admiration- undermine the whole system of evaluative criticism. The issue for literalist art is existence, what it means for an object to exist. For Fried, the problem with the literalist position is that it makes an evaluative hierarchy meaningless, as evaluative hierarchy can- not be imposed on existence. What is meant by the "negation of art" is the negation of evaluative criticism, the enter- prise of judging works of art. To impose an evaluative hierarchy on art incurs the same problem as imposing it on existence; the problem is that it means nothing to say an art work has quality. Whether an art work has quality cannot be verified, for the word "qual- ity" describes no fact about the work. We don't know what "quality" looks like, and, beyond that, we cannot visualize "quality" or what that would mean. To ascribe quality is to evaluate fact founded on subjective criteria. Value is inextri- cably subjective; attempting to objectify value results in arbitrariness. The sub- jectivity of value excludes any evaluation based on objective criteria. When Fried says the narrow vertical Olitski painting succeeds, we can verify the painting's proportions and certain perceptual phenomena, which Fried describes, avail- able in the painting; but we cannot verify that the painting succeeds by its quality, for that information is not available in the painting. Olitski's painting succeeds solely on the value Fried places on it. Whether it succeeds or has quality be- yond Fried's subjective placement of value cannot be determined. Further, whether the painting has quality is irrele- vant to what it accomplishes. Fried, in saying Olitski's painting succeeds, says only that it interests him, which describes the relationship between Fried and the painting. To say a work is interesting is to make a relatively small claim for it; for "interesting" indicates the subjective "in- teresting to me." When Donald Judd said, "A work needs only to be interesting," he meant that a work cannot be more than interesting. Ascribing quality objectifies a subjective situation and clouds the mean- ing of a specific work and the viewer's response to it. The evaluative critic not satisfied with being interested in a work wants to say the work is good and re- moves his response from the realm of the subjective into the objective. Fried's interest in Louis, Olitski, Stella, Noland, Caro, David Smith, Bolus, and Poons is not based on the quality inherent in their work, for we have no idea of what that would mean; his con- cern with these artists' work, I suggest, is based simply on his interest and on no- thing more. His interest is lively and his perception often acute. If Fried's notions of quality were meaningful, works by other artists could be said to have quality when they conformed to Fried's estab- lished criteria. A stunning case in point is Roy Lichtenstein's work since 1967. Parallels between Lichtenstein's modular paintings and Stella's protractors have often been noted. But the similarities between Lichtenstein's mirrors and recent entablatures and the work of Olitski and Noland have gone unnoticed. The point is whatever can be said of these paintings by Stella, Noland, and Olitski, in Fried's terms, can and should be said of Lichtenstein's paintings. Fried insists on the importance of evaluative criteria, but he applies his criteria only to artists whose work interests him. Fried's inability to apply his own evaluative cri- teria universally is the failure that, above all else, constitutes his narrowness€ Bruce Boice, a painter, lives in Hartford, Con- necticut.
