<plain_text><page sequence="1">Boxed in Imagining the unseen in Roberto Matta's cube constructions MIRANDA LASH Moving in slow orbit around the room, visitors gathered around Roberto Matta's three-dimensional construction, Inside Outside (fig. 1). It was a cube measuring twenty-two inches across, decorated on all sides with scenes of war. In brightly colored pastel, crayon, and pencil, Matta (Roberto Sebastian Antonio Matta Echaurren) depicted his oft-used anthropomorphic figures of half monsters, half men.1 Whereas in his paintings from the 1940s Matta generalized his depiction of violence to abstract scenes of rape, strangulation, and agony, in this case the drawings communicated a specific vision of modern warfare (fig. 2a-f). One can recognize planes, tanks, helmeted figures, missiles firing, and explosions. Dark flecks of red trace paths of gunfire and blood. Each side of the cube was lined with a different drawing that the visitors could view as they rotated around the object. These six visible panels, however, constituted only half the artwork. Visitors were told that on the interior sides of the cube, there were six more panels that could not be seen. Rather than allow his visitors to look inside, Matta instead asked them to record what they imagined the interior looked like. By denying his viewers access to the interior, Matta creates in some sense a communal experience of blindness, like in the Surrealist game of cadavre exquis or exquisite corpse, in which each individual draws in complete ignorance to what the rest of the image contains. However, in Matta's case, there is no moment of revelation when the entire picture becomes visible. The individual's invention on paper completes the artwork, yet there is no final point of comparison or resolution. An act of traveling is also required of the viewers. Apart from circumambulating the box in order to view all six external drawings, the visitors are asked to locate themselves in the center of an unknown space, and once there, to "look" and record, as if engaging in a journey of initiation. Unbound by reality, there is no limit to what they might see. Yet, for these visitors to reach the level of awareness, even freedom, that Matta desires, they must navigate through a web of contradictions. The cube presents images of horror, and yet the physical shape of the piece is completely rational and Euclidean. The box thus becomes the nexus for Matta between the structures of rational thought and the path towards perceiving dimensions and realities not apparent to the naked eye. Inside Outside toured throughout Europe during the 1970s, generating funds for civil rights causes in France.2 Works with political undertones were not uncommon for Matta by this time?in the late 1960s, the artist dedicated himself to creating and displaying works of art that critiqued war, for example, his 1967 Judgments series of etchings and his 1968 exhibition at Alexandre lolas gallery in New York, which focused on conflicts in Vietnam, Santo Domingo, and Alabama. This period concurrently saw a rise in the prominence and acceptance of conceptual art. The same year as Matta's exhibition at lolas, Southwestern College in Chula Vista, California, controversially purchased Bruce Nauman's sculpture entitled Dark, a square block of steel inscribed with the word "dark" on the bottom, where it is not visible. For Matta, however, his "conceptual" piece on the unseen was not an attempt to bond to new trends. Rather, it was a resolution of ideas he had been wrestling with since the 1930s. An artist best known for his connection to both the Surrealist and American Abstract Expressionist movements, Matta had been thinking about the visible and invisible for some time already. For Matta, the verb "to see" denoted the most complex, elusive, and magical human action. It was I would like to thank Mary Kadish, Jan Burandt, and Ceri Aramanda at the Menil Collection and Sheila Cork at the New Orleans Museum of Art, for their generous help with my research, as well as Benedicte Pesle and Malitte Matta for their most helpful comments, support, and advice. 1. The original title and date of Inside Outside remains uncertain at this time. The work is listed as "Inside Outside, c. 1940s" in the exhibition brochure by Edmund Carpenter Witnesses to a Surrealist Vision (The Menil Collection, 1999). However, this title was almost certainly added later, most likely not by Matta. One possible title found listed in the inventory records of Galerie Alexandre lolas is "Cuba Amanece," or Cuba Awakens (referring to Matta's admiration of Fidel Castro). Stylistic analysis in consultation with members of Matta's family also refutes dating the work to the 1940s, as it bears much closer similarity to his drawings from the 1960s. 2.

Since his first drawings as a student of architecture, Matta's interests lay in bending the walls of reality?delving beneath our routine conception of space, time, and thought, in order to reveal hidden forces at work. He was known as the painter of "inscapes," his term for the hidden landscapes of the mind. As far back as 1938, his "psychological morphology" paintings emphasized the ever-shifting nature of our psyches. He eschewed calling himself an artist: "I am not a painter, you understand. I am someone who tries to construct. . . images that will one day allow us to understand the verb 'to see.'"3 Art historian Martica Sawin, documenting Matta's consistent attention to the verb "to see," cites Matta's repeated declaration that he was not concerned with making paintings, but with ''making visible/'4 His wild imagery is not simply an illustration or representation of what lies in the heart, but also an exhortation to begin the very process of "seeing" with eyes closed. Admittedly, Matta's definition of "seeing" was much broader than most. Although he was fluent in many tongues, among them Spanish, French, Italian, and English, he found language to be very limiting, particularly in its use of the verb "to see." "The language we have," he claimed, "shows us only the appearance of things, the shell."5 For him, seeing was a type of understanding outside the abilities of the physical sight. "Because one does not see solely with the eyes, one sees also with one's intelligence, one sees with imagination, one sees with poetry, with shrewdness, with humor."6 "'To see,' as a verb," he argued, "means to 3.

Being capable of seeing the thing growing, of seeing how it is changing, of seeing it in the space it inhabits, surrounded by obstacles and threatened."7 Art played a vital role in this process. However, Matta was consistent in his regard that art was not an end in itself, but the catalyst towards seeing. "A picture is not a canvas on a wall," he explained, "it is the impact that hits the bull's-eye of your mind."8 As a young man, nearly blind with a case of shingles, Matta described his absolute joy at acquiring a plaster of Alberto Giacometti's Invisible Object (Hands Holding the Void) in 1943. Though penniless and visibly hindered, Matta treasured Giacometti's sculpture for its illumination of a concept: "[T]he hand touches a breast, the breast of the invisible."9 Matta was egalitarian in his belief that all people had the capacity to "see." What has heretofore been overlooked in the scholarship on Matta is a specific device he used to help his viewers achieve true "sight": the cube. It may seem ironic that an artist vehemently 7.

Yet, from his early years as an ex-architect, to his later projects as an artist cum-political activist, the cube resurfaces as a structural element floating or constraining his fluid figures. The cube in Matta's art performs many functions. Like other planar elements in his images, it provides a foil to his more organic forms. It becomes a framework of boundaries to "hold in" his otherwise exploding presentation of space. The cube also acts as his "container" symbol, at times as benign as storage space for "filing away" entities, whereas in other artworks it is a Pandora's box that threatens to unleash its fearful contents. Above all, however, the cube provides a platform for Matta to explain his conception of seeing, whereby one must "conceive reality in terms of all directions."10 The chief problem with ordinary perception, according to Matta, is that we conceive of the world as existing in front of us. In the 2004 documentary Matta: Eye of the Surrealist, director Jane Crawford (widow of Matta's son, the artist Gordon Matta-Clark), captures an elderly Matta outside his home nearTarquinia, Italy, arranging squares of paper into one of his cubes (fig. 3). "We see the world through a window," he says, "this abstraction that the world is a square, it is a page for writing. It is an abstraction, which is not complete, because we are really at the center always. This center has an up, down, right, left, front and back." As Matta begins to build the squares into a box of paper he explains: "It is an abstraction, but it takes us to all directions instead of only the window . . . let's say this is the 'front,'" he explains as he draws, "I see you. ... On top is the infinite! ... On my back the sun setting, on the floor, roots. . . . There has to be another convention, which is as abstract as perspective . . . where people have to grasp the picture above, below, front, right, left, back." If we can add to this the idea of movement through time, if we can conceive of reality at different speeds, then Matta smiles, "the verb to see begins to actually see." Architectural beginnings Matta's understanding of mental space, as it is conceived with an above, below, right, and left, undoubtedly stems from his early training as an architect. Formerly a student of Le Corbusier, Matta's relationship to architecture remained ambivalent throughout his life, though even at the age of seventy-five, he continued to insist, "I am not a painter... I never left architecture. But I seek to know if by some artifice, one could create an image of the space of consciousness/'11 In 1932, at the age of twenty, he received his diploma in architecture from the Universidad Catolica in Santiago, Chile. His thesis, an imaginary "League of Religions" temple modeled after parts of the body, reflects an early interest in a physiological understanding of space. Separating from his family, he traveled to Paris and in 1934 began working as an architectural draughtsman for Le Corbusier. The experience was unfulfilling?the office was unheated and "there was neither money nor construction sites."12 With little to do, Matta channeled his creative energies into drawings, "mad propositions," as he called them.13 In these studies from 1936, walls are bent into convex shapes, floors and ceilings open erratically into new levels, staircases seem to float in thin air, and the furniture is made up of organic, slippery materials. In his suggestively titled collage Wet Sheets from 1936, his inhabitants lounge on amorphously shaped couches in a dreamlike world of unstable perspectives. Sharply receding rooms separate strange corridors where hands sprout from the ground. The following year in Paris, the poet and de facto leader of the Surrealists Andre Breton welcomed Matta into the Surrealist circle, though Matta had yet produced little but these strange and sensual drawings. Matta's background as an architect provided the basis for his first Surrealist publication?an essay in the journal Minotaure, which he wrote at the suggestion of Breton. The result was "Mathematique sensible? architecture du temps," illustrated with his Projet maquette d'appartement, a collage strongly based on his Wet Sheets. In this essay, Matta advocates for "walls like wet sheets, which change their shape to match our psychological fears" and furniture with "perfectly molded profiles," which "would unload the body of its entire past."14 The inhabitant "knocked" into this world 10.

As both "actor" and "stage," the figure in Matta's imagined "theater" exists at the center, where one can see all around, but must also contend with being completely surrounded and exposed. The unseen in Ouspensky and Duchamp Matta's time spent in France during the late 1930s would prove foundational to his development as artist. In 1938, he met the British painter Gordon Onslow Ford, who became a life-long friend. It was Onslow Ford who convinced Matta to attempt painting for the first time and who encouraged Matta's interest in a spatial fourth dimension and the writings of the Russian philosopher and theosophist Peter D. Ouspensky.15 Ouspensky challenged Euclidean geometry in his discussions of psychology and higher dimensions of existence. However, to elucidate his arguments, he frequently used geometrical drawings of lines, planes, cubes, and spheres as metaphorical teaching devices on topics ranging from the shape of the human psyche to the understanding of motion in different dimensions. Known for drawing multidimensional diagrams on tablecloths, as he did once for Leo Tolstoy, Ouspensky preceded Matta in his recourse to geometry to describe unseen structures.16 Ouspensky's arguments regarding the limitations of human vision also deeply influenced Matta. In his Tertium Organum, first published in 1912, Ouspensky argued that: We are never able to see even a small bit of the external world as it is, i.e. such as we know it to be. We can never see a writing desk or a cupboard simultaneously from all sides, as well as inside. Our eye distorts the external world in a certain way to enable us, in looking about, to determine 15. Scholar Linda Dalrymple Henderson has documented the Surrealists' prolonged interest in the fourth dimension as a higher, even mystical dimension of space, even though by the 1920s the greater public had largely accepted Albert Einstein's redefinition of fourth dimension as time.

Notwithstanding, Matta remained a great admirer of Einstein's theories to the end of his life, half-jokingly declaring Einstein (along with Karl Marx), "a greater painter than Picasso."

But to look at the world not from our own point of view is impossible for us. And we are never able to have a correct view of it, a view not distorted by our eyesight.17 To supplement the eye, therefore, the mind unconsciously "corrects" what the eye sees, and with the aid of mental "concepts" is able to understand solids, for example, though we only actually see the outside surface. The fourth dimension, according to Ouspensky, adds to the third dimension?a "space-sense," a sense of movement, and a sense of time, which is necessary because the world is "unceasingly changing; at every new moment it is no longer the same as it was the moment before."18 The artist plays a privileged role in this universe. Because art "sees more and further than we do," the artist as a clairvoyant, "must see that which others do not see" and as a magician, "must possess the gift of making others see what they do not see by themselves."19 No discussion on the unseen in Matta would be complete without mentioning Marcel Duchamp, Matta's mentor, who, among other things, also inspired in Matta the desire to represent existence in the state of flux.20 Soon after first encountering Duchamp's writings in Cahiers d'Art'm 1936, Matta claims, "I became a fetishist for the work of Duchamp."21 A coauthor with Katherine Drier on the text Duchamp's Glass: An Analytical Reflection, Matta named one of his paintings The Bachelors Twenty Years After, 1943, as an homage to Duchamp's Bride Stripped Bare by Her Bachelors, Even (Large Glass) (1915-1923).22 As a fledgling artist, Matta was attracted to Duchamp's depiction of unseen forces: his metaphorical reference to sexual energies in the Bride Stripped Bare, and his articulation of reality in a state of transformation in paintings such as The Passage from Virgin to Bride (1912).23 Yet, the most direct Duchampian precursor to Matta's Inside Outside was undoubtedly the assisted readymade With Hidden Noise or A Bruit Secret horn 1916. Comprised of a ball of twine, two brass plates, screws, and a now famous unknown object, Hidden Noise was born when Duchamp asked his friend Walter Arsenberg to place something inside the ball of twine, which Duchamp then sealed without looking inside. Content to leave the mysterious object "a secret," even to himself, its presence was made known every time the piece was shaken. For Duchamp, a lover of games, Hidden Noise was a riddle with no answer, in which the process of guessing was almost an afterthought. By contrast, for Matta, the process of deduction and conjecture was of crucial importance. In Inside Outside, even though his viewers were left "blind" initially, ultimately Matta's wish for them was to "see," or at least enter into the process of seeing. Evolution in style From roughly 1937 to 1941, during Matta's first years with the Surrealists in France and later New York, all traces of linearity vanished from his paintings. His "psychological morphologies" from the late 1930s depicted translucent layers of amorphous shapes, seemingly dissolving in undefined space. "I call psychological morphology," Matta wrote in 1938, "the graphic representation of the transformations due to the absorption and emission of energies in the object." Citing Ouspensky, he describes reality as a "sequence of the explosive convulsions modeled in a pulsatory and rotary medium subjected to rhythms." What we see, "the optical image," "is only one theoretical section in the morphological fall of the object. . . . The eye, the agent of memory, is a means of simplifying." An image, he explains, "is held to calm anxiety," it gives us something to grasp on to. But much information is lost in the process, as only "one possible form of the object is preserved."24 If linearity connotes rigidity, then Matta renounced linear elements in his early paintings with the aim of rendering them literally and figuratively as fluid as possible. Yet perhaps due to their lack of perspective, 17. P. D. Ouspensky, Teritum Organum, trans. E. Kadloubovsky and the author (New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 1981), pp. 78-79. 18. Ibid., p. 90. 19.

For Matta to capture the multivalent nature of reality, he needed a means of representing infinite expansion in all directions. Beginning in 1941, his inscapes began to change in character. Once suppressed linear elements began to reemerge. In Years of Fear from 1941-1942, pathways of receding lines, spheres, parallelograms, and rectangles compete in the jumble amid the shadowy and misty pores from his earlier morphology paintings (fig. 4).25 Initially inspired by the "emotional havoc of World War II and class violence in Mexico," the painting also expresses an inner conflict: "Everything in this painting was psychological. . . . How to picture the battlefield, not the physical one, but the one inside us: fear against courage, criticism and hate, suspicion and trust? An internal bombardment."26 Attacked from all sides, we recall Matta's figure in his "Mathematique sensible" essay, "in the midst of the ultimate theater," in a state of endless tension and competing forces.27 By 1945, another significant element appears in Matta's painting: abstract and sexualized anthropomorphic figures. It was around this time that Matta began to articulate his shift from a "psychological" to a "social" morphology. In his painting Etre-Avec, or Being With from 1946, he explains: "My main preoccupation through the period of The Vertigo of Eros was looking within myself. Suddenly I realized that while trying to do this I was not being with a horrible crisis in society. My vision of myself was becoming blind for not being made one with the people about me, and I sought to create a new morphology of others within my own field of consciousness."28 Floating in chaos, Matta's totemic figures fluctuate between the stalwart position of gods and the terrified, gripping submission of insects. At the same time that these figures emerge, however, 25. James Thrall Soby attributed this change in style to Marcel Duchamp's now famous Mile of String installation for the "First Papers of Surrealism" exhibition: "It would be interesting to know whether this new style was partly inspired by the installation designed by Marcel Duchamp for the Surrealist Exhibition which opened at 451 Madison Avenue, New York, October 14, 1942."

In The Red Gown or La Robe Rouge from 1946, for example, thin pencil lines in the shape of six squares overlay Matta's figures floating in space. Seemingly on a separate plane of existence from the grotesque characters, the squares act more as lenses than compartments. They do not contain the figures, yet the squares provide a framework for looking at each, particularly the woman wearing the red gown in the upper right. The purpose of the six planes is more overt in the drawing Folded Woman or Femme Pliee (1947), as the cube transitions from a two-dimensional to a three dimensional form. Highlighted in yellow, it is unclear if the cube structure is enfolding the central female figure or setting her free. The orientation of the upper and lower parallelograms also renders ambiguous our orientation towards the cube. Are we watching the encasement of the female, or instead, are we the victims about to be enclosed? In his lithograph Strange Situation (Open Cube) or / Want to See It to Believe It (1947), Matta incorporates figures from earlier paintings, such as A Grave Situation (1946). The inclusion of the flattened cube (colored in blue), however, indicates the need to perceive Matta's signature figures in a different way. Rather than gazing onto Grave Situation as if through a window, in this "open cube" we are to imagine the whizzing and colliding frames folding in towards each other, converting the scene into all-encompassing space, or perhaps a breached Pandora's box. The "Interior Dymaxion" While Matta was undergoing these transformations to his stylistic approach during the early 1940s, his affinity to architecture brought him close to another influential figure, the inventor and architect Buckminster Fuller. Although Fuller sought an order to the universe that Matta never believed existed, the two shared a frustration with the conventional means of depicting and understanding space. They met in 1939 and remained in contact through the years exchanging ideas.29 In 1943, the same year a "pull-out" guide to Fuller's Dymaxion map of the world appeared in Life magazine, Matta designed La Parole est a Peret, in homage to Fuller's design.30 Having been asked by Andre Breton to illustrate a book by the Surrealist poet Benjamin Peret, Matta created a flatted polyhedron of fourteen faces covered with abstractions typical of his imagery at the time. This drawing provided the basis for another drawing, which Matta then cut into fourteen pieces and divided among fourteen luxury editions of the book, also titled La Parole est a Peret.3] It was a reversal of Fuller's purpose of making geography accessible on a two-dimensional plane. In Matta's work, the lone triangle or square is a reminder of the unfathomable distance between each side or to the center of the polyhedron. Now circulating in different locations throughout the globe, the polyhedron's sides could be said to encompass the entire breadth of the world.32 In his preface to La Parole est a Peret, Peret argues that poets must "show by total non-conformity their opposition to the world in which they live. ... A poet these days must either be a revolutionary, or cease being a poet, for he must endlessly launch towards the unknown."33 Despite the spontaneous nature of Peret's writing, scholar Mary Ann Caws has noted that it retains a sense of structure, through either logical sentence forms or the repetition of similar sounds.34 Matta was similarly drawn to preexisting structures of logic, such as geometry, as his point of departure. For Matta, there was no greater unknown than the interior of the mind?and it seems likely that he saw a connection between Peret's fascination with the marvelous and Fuller's method of depicting an entire world. The resulting fusion in Matta's La Parole est a Peret was a concrete object, perhaps signifying the incomprehensible. 29. "He [Fuller] was a very unusual person, rather delirious. I was very naive and very young. Sometimes, he came to talk to me at three o'clock in the morning about an idea he just had. He was incredible and very funny." Matta, an interview with Obrist (see note 13). 30. Roberto Matta, "How to Assemble the Globe/' Life (March 1, 1943):44. 31. "Breton a collabore a 'La parole est a Peret', et m'a demande de I'illustrer.

Le dessin qui a servi a la lithographie Ma parole est a Peret' est I'original." Quoted in Ferrari (see note 9), p. 190. 32. In 1944, Matta created another drawing titled La Parole est a Peret, which he labeled at the bottom "Interior Dymaxion" in deference to Fuller. Though this design cannot be folded into a three-dimensional shape, it nonetheless proclaims itself as a translation of Fuller's idea of mapping, in this case, a mapping of a mind.

Beginning in the mid-1950s, Matta branched into experimentations that involved breaking the cube into distinct panels by installing series paintings on the ceiling and walls of a room. In his 1954 exhibition at Carlo Cardazzo's Galleria del Cavallino in Venice, his ex wife, Malitte Matta, recalls, "five paintings, roughly 2.5 meters square . . . the 'ground7 had not been painted and one of the sides was left ajar so that one could go in and be surrounded by the painting."35 Matta would replicate this multiple-painting approach in his later polyptych, EtreAtout (1960), consisting of five panels, and LEspace de I'Espece (1959-1967), which included six square panels (later three more rectangular panels were included). However, because L'Espace de I'Espece's final arrangement would not allow the viewer to see inside, the installation was an approximation of a perfect cube. Matta explained his purpose in designing L'Espace as a "mental exercise": "To think an event, it is necessary to be inside, [and] at the same time to apprehend it from all sides."36 The viewer was invited "to locate the center of consciousness at the center of the cube."37 By the 1960s, Matta even transformed the dining room of his Parisian apartment into a "cube," painting the walls and ceiling as a comprehensive environment.38 While conceiving of these three-dimensional installations, Matta continued to concurrently depict cubes within his two-dimensional paintings. For example, in The Unthinkable (1957), a cube exists in the image as quasi-architectural entity battling against other forces (fig. 5). Its four white planes threaten to crush the insect-like towers within. In other later paintings, such as Semeur d'incendies (1967) and Conduite Interieure (1969) the presence of the cube must be inferred through recognizing its flattened form (fig. 6). In these works, the shape of an "unfolded" cube (loosely reminiscent of the 35. Email correspondence with the author, December 24, 2008. Edmund Carpenter's text on Inside Outside notes: "When this work was first exhibited in Barcelona in 1954, viewers recorded what they imagined the interior panels depicted." See Witnesses to a Surrealist Vision (note 1). However, correspondence from Carpenter to Roberto Matta indicates that perhaps more than one of these cubes existed. In anticipation of the "Witnesses" installation, Carpenter wrote: ". . .Years ago you mentioned a six-sided box, with the painting on the inside, which you exhibited in Stockholm. If I remember correctly a potential buyer wanted to open the box and sell its panels separately. Would you have the time and interest to make a similar box, this one never to be opened?"

The outline of its edges is allowed to bleed into its surroundings, though the vibrancy of its interior ensures that the structure remains visible. By this device, Matta allows the parts of the cube (its "sides") to melt into each other, so that when "assembled," there would be no clear indication of where each side begins and ends. As with all Matta's cuboid structures, his aim is to draw us in and hold us in his theater of seeing. Yet, even once inside the cube, our position is not static. Our only hope for escape is to keep the eye and the mind active, in a state of flux, mirroring our surroundings. Similar to his earlier installations, Matta hung his suite of large oil paintings Le Honni Aveuglant, or The Blinding Man (also translated as the "Alienated Man," 1966), on all sides of the room, including the ceiling. Yet when the six paintings were shown at the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis in 1967, they were hung from cables at irregular angles away from the gallery walls (fig. 7). The result was a floating environment that threatened to implode before the viewer, the invitation to the exhibition at lolas Gallery explained Matta's motives: He who looks possesses the picture. The picture is the minority. Thus it is necessary that the picture possess the spectator, who then must become the minority. When the spectator is solicited by a picture that envelops him, [in] the box, he is no longer capable of possession. ... In this situation he must recuperate his liberty, his dignity lies in this act, he can become a Honni Aveuglant.39 In the spirit of Peret, Matta explains that the poet is a type of "minority" or Honni Aveuglant, and by extension so is the painter. In his 1965 exhibition "Le Cube Ouvert" in Lucerne, Matta explained how he created a similar polyptych: When painting a canvas, I paint all around me; I have tried to act as if I were situated at the center of the cube and the 39.

At that point the viewer is no more a viewer, but instead a "be-er", while he gathers a consciousness of being, he will become the verb ? being ? . . . the object is no more than a pretext for this exercise.40 Multiple things are happening at once in Le Honni Aveuglant: The viewer is allowed to empathize with the artist who paints at the center of the cube. At the same time, situated at the center of this quasi architectural space, he or she must overcome being surrounded by the painting. Their physical situation . amid the collapsing walls mimics what Matta describes as the perpetual "internal bombardment" of the mind mentioned earlier: fear against courage, criticism and hate, suspicion and trust. Despite the success and imposing nature of his installations, Matta continued to dream of an even more conceptually complete cube. Although in Etre Atout, L'Espace de I'Espece, and Le Honni Aveuglant, the panels surround the viewer on multiple sides, their enclosure was not complete. Since the late 1950s, the artist imagined creating a large-scale, sealed cube. He proposed the idea, without success, to Pontus Hulten, then director of the Moderna Museet in Stockholm, for his retrospective in 1959.41 Years later, in 1969, he approached the French collectors Jean and Dominique de Menil with the idea of a closed sphere containing art that could not be seen.42 He was still deeply interested in the work of Buckminster Fuller, which may explain why his first idea was to create a sphere (recalling Fuller's domes) instead of a cube. That same year, his then wife, Malitte Matta, met with Fuller and his associate Shoji Sadao, who agreed to help design the piece. The idea was an aluminum sphere, one hundred eighty centimeters across (a measure derived from Leonardo da Vinci's Vitruvian Man), which would be suspended between the floor and the ceiling. In November 1969, Matta had the opportunity to speak with Dominique de Menil in person about his idea of a sphere containing hidden paintings. Mrs. de Menil recorded the following notes from her conversation with him. At this point, the size of the sphere no longer mattered: "It could be very small, very precious, like a diamond."43 Even its 40. Matta: Le Cube Ouvert, exh. cat.

The only thing Matta insisted upon was that the sphere be suspended in the air, and that one would be able to "orbit" around it, while the paintings inside were likewise "orbiting." What followed in their conversation sheds further light on what Matta was aiming for in his three dimensional constructions. "God is a word," Dominique wrote, recalling Matta's comments, "but what do we put into that word?" Her question parallels the question raised by Matta's boxes?what do we put into them? What do we place inside? "A simplistic iconography?" Dominique pondered, " [t]he projection of habitual thoughts? Or rather the thoughts of the world. The word God is the greatest challenge to man." (She underlined this last sentence.) For undetermined reasons, Matta and Fuller's aluminum sphere was never built. Its closest approximation is Inside Outside, the paper cube currently on loan to the Menil Collection. In Inside Outside, the viewer must endeavor to enter a mystical center that can only be accessed through mental means. It is a rare (possibly unique) example in Matta's oeuvre of a cube that never opens, whose insides are forever secret. In 1969 (around the same time as Matta's sphere proposal), he created a lithographic cube with components that were hidden, though not perpetually unknown to the public. Titled L'Altra Euridice, the cube evokes the story of the ill-fated nymph, rescued from the underworld by her husband Orpheus only to be whisked back due to his lack of faith. It is comprised of four lithographs, each containing three sides of a cube, which are then folded to create two cubes, one inside each other. In its final state, the cube bears one design on its outside and another permanently concealed on the inner surfaces. The inner cube, Matta explains, is "Euridice's space in the light of hell" while the outer cube is "Euridice blossoming towards the light of the sun." We are able to see a landscape of life?a colorful abstraction of Euridice dancing on earth?while the afterlife (the unknown world) is hidden inside. In Inside Outside, the tenor of the exterior is reversed, we see a hell on earth made through war. There is no obvious metaphor for what the interior of box may contain: One could envision the seed of all violence or a fantasy of peace. We should recall that being "blind" in Matta's world is equal to being unconscious or unaware of others. In describing his motivation to paint Etre Avec, he explained that he was concerned about "becoming blind for not being made one with the people about me/'44 In order to penetrate the barriers of war in Inside Outside, we must attempt to share an experience of "being with" the artist?seeing what he sees and seeing what others may see inside the cube. Circumambulating his suspended cube, his visitors achieve both a state of transience and mental projection. "The heart is an eye," Nobel Laureate Octavio Paz wrote in his poetic tribute "The House of Glances (for Roberto Matta)."45 Particularly when it comes to the subject of war, Matta reminds us that the only way to move beyond this image is to attempt seeing with the heart. To this day, the contents of Inside Outside have never been revealed to the public. To do so would sap the work of its conceptual and metaphorical power. The idea is not to guess correctly about the inside, but to perform the exercise that Matta desired us to do: To use our bodies and thoughts in order to place ourselves at the center of the cube. From there we can "see" what we want, and in that sense, experience freedom. Freedom comes at a high price, however, as the interior world, according to Matta, is neither comforting nor easy to understand. Undertaking the challenge of writing and drawing elevates us to the status of artistic creator, poet, or Honni Aveuglant. In his "House of Glances," Paz emphatically reminds us that we must "create in order to see": "We must shake the rattle of rhyme to deceive time and wake the soul ... we must construct the house of glances over this dubious place."46 In the act of creation, we transfer our inner material to the external world. We vocalize the words heard only in thoughts and present the visions only seen behind the eye. Expression is the outcome of "seeing" one's own world. And in knowing one's own world, one can better understand the world of others. As Dominique recalled from her conversation with Matta: "The world [is] in man. Man can conceive the world." 44.
