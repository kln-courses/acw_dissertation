<plain_text><page sequence="1">REVIEWS I07 Eastern Eastern Religions and Western Thought, by S. Radhakrishnan. Pp. 394. (Humphrey Milford, Oxford University Press, 1939.) In the stirring times in which we live these lectures given by Sir S. Radhakrishnan in the years 1936-8 are of peculiar interest and signi ficance. Modern civilization with its scientific temper, humanistic spirit, and secular view of life is uprooting the world, which more than ever before is י divided and afflicted by formidable evilsThe cause of the tension and disorder is attributed to ' the lack of adjustment between the process of life, which is one of increasing inter-dependence and the ideology of life, the integrating habits of mind, loyalties and affections embodied in our laws and institutionsThe new world consciousness embracing all mankind is without any control or guidance of the spirit, so that it is just a confused mass of needs and impulses, ambitions and activities. The supreme task, it is contended, is to give a soul to this world-consciousness and develop ideals and institutions necessary for the creative expression of the world-soul. The religion of the future, in the opinion of the author, is a mys ticism which transcends the rivalry of dogmatic creeds, the conflict of races and the strife of nations, and stands for the fellowship of humanity. Left to himself man feels kinship with the whole universe and a sense of community. Everywhere this intuitive consciousness is latent in mankind and assumes the indivisible oneness of life. As in China Taoism, Confucianism, and Buddhism have merged into one another despite their mutually contradictory theologies, so in Hindu, Moslem, Persian, and Christian mysticism there is a fundamental spiritual unity centring in the realization of immediate and permanent contact with Ultimate Reality and infinite being. In the state of ecstasy the soul enters the stream of life, is borne along in the flowing current of it, and finds its reality in the larger enveloping life of the spirit, till finally complete unity with the divine is attained and abid ing happiness secured. As the West has led the way in science and philosophy so the East has been pre-eminent in this type of spirituality. Thus, in India, the region with which Sir Radhakrishnan naturally is mainly concerned, Hinduism in its loftier aspects is more a ' transforming experience than a notion of God', so that even theists like Ramanuja maintain that the spiritual consciousness, though not the Deity Himself, is the only way in which God can be known. In the Upanishads the Brahmanic dualism of a microcosm within and its co-ordinate macrocosm with out is transformed into a monism. The Absolute is at once the prin ciple of search and the object sought; man's realization of the divine and the divine itself. But regarded from the cosmic end the Absolute has tended to become a personal God controlling human affairs, though</page><page sequence="2">I08 THE JOURNAL OF THEOLOGICAL STUDIES in the Upanishads empiric being is excluded from the concept. As Samkara recognized, there are really two different Upanishadic doc trines of the all-inclusive Ultimate Reality, the one esoteric, the other exoteric; and these two traditions run through Hinduism. Sir Radhakrishnan is probably correct in claiming that the roots of Hinduism are laid in the substratum of Indian civilization which in the Indus valley goes back to the fourth millennium B.C., contemporaneous with the parallel cultures in the Nile and the Euphrates. But while Brahmin teachers at Benares may have been proclaiming the wisdom of the East for centuries before Plato taught in Athens, the cultivated fruits of oriental mysticism are very far removed in character and in time from the natural products of Mohenjo-daro and the Aryan invaders. Originally the Indus fertility cultus and the Vedic mytho logy were as polytheistic as the Minoan-Mycenaean worship of the Mother-goddess and the Olympian anthropomorphic theology in the Hellenic West. As Greece was destined by nature to be the home of an independent civilization, so India geographically was set apart for the development of an uninterrupted pantheistic mysticism in which man was completely dominated by his environment and readily sought release from the struggle in an irresistible tropical climate. Thus, from the time of the Rig-Veda one tradition moved farther and farther from theism in the direction of a negative idealism which left no room for a personal Creator and Sustainer of the universe. It is true, as is maintained in these lectures, that India has never been completely isolated from the West, but, nevertheless, in the formative period her only continental contacts were through the Khyber Pass. How far her thought influenced Palestine, Greece, and the classical Graeco-Roman culture is not easily determined. Doubtless Alexander's invasion of India produced a closer interchange of ideas with the West, but the mystical tradition in Hellenism, Judaism, and Christianity is farther removed from its highly specialized Hindu counterpart than might be inferred from this volume. Mysticism is a wide subject, and the name covers many very different types of spiritual experience. We know, of course, that there were non-Semitic influences in Palestine before the Christian era, and some of these may have had contacts with the East, but, even if it could be proved that the Essenes were 'filled with the spirit of Buddhism', the sect was essentially Jewish in origin. Moreover, it is by no means certain that John the Baptist was an Essene; still less that his greater sue cessor borrowed from this source. Nevertheless, as Sumer, Egypt, and the Indus had a common cultural substratum, so Occident and orient have reacted on each other throughout the ages. At this critical juncture in the history of civilization the spirituality of India has</page><page sequence="3">REVIEWS 109 much to reveal to a stricken world, and no one is more competent to undertake this important task than the distinguished occupant of the recently established chair of Eastern Religions at Oxford.
