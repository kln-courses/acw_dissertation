<plain_text><page sequence="1">r ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE I From the Atacama to Makalu: A Jour- ney to Extreme Environments on Earth and Beyond. By R.T. Arrieta. 1997. Coqui Press (P.O. Box 32083-B, Panama City, FL 32407) 318 pp. Paper- back $27.95. B~I#Bg Good materials and good ideas EJ abound in this book. Arrieta claims to have written it for the educated layperson, college students, and advanced high school students. I think the target audience might be more advanced than that because the readability level is grade 14.97 (Flesch- Kincaid scale). I'd like to see more words included in the glossary. For example, an early chapter on resistance to freezing introduces polyols. These compounds are mentioned again near the end of the book, but they are not included in the glossary, and the only index reference to them is for the latter appearance. Likewise, the critical concept of de- gree-days is nicely explained in an early chapter and referred to in later chapters but doesn't appear in the glos- sary or the index. With some careful editing, several six-bit words could be eliminated altogether. Anything men- tioned only once, such as "saxicolous," "hepaxanthic," or "canthariasis," for example, could be eliminated from the text and the glossary. The occasional anthropomorphic writing style may make the flow of the text more interesting, but it is probably not a necessary trick for creating enter- taining and colorful language. Can you picture an "adventurous knight" in the plant kingdom? Everyone in Arrieta's target audience should know that acid- ity is expressed as pH. Do we need a reference to acidity "expressed as its logarithmic rubric pH?" I enjoy an in- teresting story that includes more than just the facts. Only for a few plants and insects does the author tell a tale. More explanations on mechanisms of survival rather than lists of survivors would provide appeal; lists could be presented in tables with reference to the original literature. Four or five ref- erences are cited in the entire text, but several are listed for each chapter. I would appreciate a direct citation to a particular article in the text. I was frus- trated to find no article listed by two authorities mentioned in the text (Wild and Rivera). In the concluding paragraph, the au- thor acknowledges that "extreme envi- ronments deserve more than just aca- demic interest." I was hoping to see the practical application of our under- standing of various adaptations to be part of the text. In particular, I missed a discussion of bioremediation and of using particular surface bacteria to pro- tect some plants from frost damage. Three useful appendices are in- cluded in addition to the glossary and index. Two appendices on the taxon- omy of organisms mentioned are use- ful, but more illustrations of the special adaptations of plants and animals would help us know the organisms. Some figures are numbered and others are not. Are some an integral part of the book and others just incidental art? An appendix listing latitude and longi- tude of places mentioned in the book is a nice addition. Again, however, I'd like to see a map, or several maps, included as well. For $28, I think a few more illustrations could be included. The "beyond" of the title refers to Mars. Arrieta does a very nice job of discussing the nature of life on Mars, if it exists. Throughout the chapter de- voted to this extreme situation, inter- esting examples of adaptations of or- ganisms to extreme conditions on Earth illustrate possibilities. Rachel Hays 6921 Buckhorn Ct.
