<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE CONCEPT OF NATURAL SELECTION: A CENTENNIAL VIEW I. MICHAEL LERNER Professor of Genetics, University of California, Berkeley (Commemoration of the Centennial of the Publication of The Origin of Species by Charles Darwin, Annual Meeting of the American Philosophical Society, April, 1959) CONTENTS PAGE Objections to natural selection .................... 173 The definition of natural selection ................ 175 Advances since Darwin .......................... 176 Miscellaneous implications ........................ 179 In conclusion ............ .............. 181 SEVERAL years ago, Sir Isaiah Berlin in writing an essay on Tolstoy's philosophy of history took his text from a fragment of the Greek poet Archi- lochus, which said: "The fox knows many things, but the hedgehog knows one big thing." Berlin's imaginative interpretation of this line was that writers, thinkers, or perhaps, all of humanity, can be divided into the two classes of foxes and hedge- hogs. The ideas of the foxes are centrifugal, diffuse; they range over a variety of levels not integrated by a single theme; they lack a unifying focal point. In the realm of thought and creation the foxes follow many ends which may be unrelated and which do not form a cohesive system. The hedge- hogs, on the other hand, are characterized by centripetal thinking directed towards a unitary inner vision. They are single-minded in their intellectual pursuits and, no matter how versatile they may be in their endeavors, the hedgehogs point to and are guided by the one big thing. Aristotle, Shakespeare, Balzac were foxes. Plato, Dante, Dostoyevsky were hedgehogs. Had Berlin considered biologists, he might well have placed Pasteur among the foxes. Darwin would most certainly have stood supreme as a hedgehog. The one big thing towards which Darwin's thoughts and writings were directed was, perhaps, not so much Evolution as the principle of Natural Selection. This was the concept that allowed the formulation of an acceptable theory of secular change in organic nature. Evolution had been discussed for more than two millennia before Darwin and Wallace. The idea, however, lacked conviction because, in the face of so much evidence for it, no generally comprehensible way in which evolution could have occurred was apparent to its proponents. Even the notion of natural selection was not exactly brand new in 1858. As an ex- planation of the presence of adaptations within species it had been considered by one or another natural philosopher from classical antiquity on- wards. But as a mechanism for the origin of species, natural selection was apparently advanced only in the nineteenth century. The South Caro- lina-born Dr. Wells mentioned it as if he took it for granted in "An account of a white female, part of whose skin resembles that of a Negro" some forty years before Darwin and Wallace. Patrick Matthew apparently alluded even more casually to natural selection a few years later in an appendix to a volume on Naval Timber and Arboriculture. Yet the revelation that a single principle can embrace the evolutionary changes in all systematic categories, that the same basic process is operative at all levels of life wherever self-replicating units exist, came from Darwin and Wallace. Their one big thing, natural selection, set at rest the doctrine of special creation. In combina- tion with our knowledge of Mendelian inheritance acquired since Darwin's day, it rendered obsolete such alternative theories of evolution as were based on extra-mechanical agencies, or on direct adaptation of organisms to their immediate envi- ronment (that is, on inheritance of acquired char- acters), and exposed them as sins against Occam's razor. Natural selection furnished the binding principle for a general or unified theory of his- torical change in the living world. It made evolu- tion not only understandable and acceptable but, beyond that, caused it to become of commanding significance in man's thinking about himself. OBJECTIONS TO NATURAL SELECTION This is not to say that the doctrine of natural selection was generally accorded, immediately upon its appearance, the status of dogma. In fact, over the last hundred years the thesis of natural selec- tion has been doubted, questioned, derided, ridi- PROCEEDINGS OF THE AMERICAN PHILOSOPHICAL SOCIETY, VOL. 103, NO. 2, APRIL, 1959 173</page><page sequence="2">174 I. MICHAEL LERNER [PROC. AMER. PHIL. SOC. culed, and on several occasions buried with con- siderable pride, pomp, and circumstance. Never- theless, over the passage of years the concept has weathered its criticisms and survived its funerals, gathering strength after each successive interment. No serious student of biology today questions the actuality of organic evolution. Neither is there any disagreement as to the reality of natural selec- tion, although its importance relative to other phenomena responsible for descent with modifica- tion may be in dispute. Even those considered to be militant foes of the view that natural selection is of primary significance in all phases of the evolutionary process, acknowledge, as for example did the late Richard Goldschmidt, that "every biologist agrees that selection and isolation are the basic working methods of evolution." The objection that Goldschmidt took towards what he used to call hyper-selectionists was not ad- dressed to their belief in selection but rather to their ideas as to what was being selected. Thus arguments may still flourish as to whether selection operates with respect to minor or major mutational steps, how exclusive an agent it is under one or another circumstance, in what particular way it interacts with other processes in determining a given evolutionary change, whether it has been completely suspended in man under the recent developments in combatting sterility, disease, and old age, and with respect to many other issues. But there is no longer any doubt that natural selection is more than a theoretical possibility-it is unquestionably a logically imperative necessity in any accounting for evolution. Generally speaking, there have been six kinds of criticisms raised against natural selection. The gravamen of the first kind was against evolution itself rather than natural selection as such. This issue is of no significance today. Secondly, teleo- logically minded biologists objected to the ap- parent purposelessness of natural selection. Con- demnation on these grounds has little validity in the climate of present-day science, though I shall have occasion to return to this point in another connection. Thirdly, Darwin's own hypothesis regarding the basis of hereditary transmission created difficulties for the concept of natural selec- tion. They were, however, dispelled when Men- delism entered the scene. Fourthly, Mendelian inheritance itself was misguidedly used to buttress the opposition to natural selection. Population geneticists have effectively demolished criticisms of this type; moreover they have demonstrated how particulate inheritance following Mendelian principles greatly augments the probable role of natural selection in evolution. Fifthly, objections have been raised, undoubtedly justifiably, against the intemperate support of natural selection by its earlier proponents, who attributed to the proc- ess consequences which we now know are ascrib- able to mating system, isolation, chance, and inter- actions of these factors with each other and with selection. And lastly, the most common and continually recurring opposition to natural selec- tion is based on a misunderstanding of what is meant by the term. In spite of the fact that in recent years Fisher, Wright, Haldane, Muller, Dobzhansky, Ford, Simpson, Mayr, Stebbins, and countless others have repeatedly expounded the concept of natural selection, it still seems to remain an uncrossable pons asinorum for many refractory naturalists. It is difficult to know what, if any- thing more, should be done about this class of objections. None of these categories of dissent from the idea of natural selection is a matter of serious concern at the present. Proof of the participation of natural selection in some situations is, of course, not tantamount to proof of its sufficiency to ac- count for all evolutionary change. But no serious student of the subject insists on this extreme view. It is enough to say that the notion of natural selec- tion as a major component of the evolutionary process has not only been theoretically established and empirically observed in the wild and in the laboratory, but it no longer falls entirely within the qualitative realm of science: natural selection can now be quantitatively treated and in many instances has been actually measured. Thanks to post-Mendelian studies on the bases of hereditary transmission, and particularly to the developments in both theoretical and experimental population genetics in the last thirty years, our understanding of the operation of selection in nature has been vastly increased. Because of that, a prodigious embarrassment of riches on which to base a general discussion faces any re- viewer of the subject. I shall therefore confine myself to a few aspects of the issue at large, trusting that other contributions to this program will cover at least some of the territory I neglect. In particular, I propose to pass over the speciation or splitting level of evolution, since it involves interaction with isolation, which is to be considered here by others infinitely more versed than I in this question. I should also note that, in con-</page><page sequence="3">VOL. 103, NO. 2, 1959] NATURAL SELECTION 175 sidering post-Darwinian advances in the field of natural selection, I prefer omitting all mention of individual contributions to the risk of finding myself sire to an invidious, or even a merely provocative, list of names. THE DEFINITION OF NATURAL SELECTION It may be appropriate at this point to define natural selection. Darwin himself did so in a number of ways. Thus (quoting from the sixth edition of The Origin of Species), he says: As many more individuals of each species are born than can possibly survive; and as, consequently, there is a frequently recurring struggle for existence, it follows that any being, if it vary however slightly in any manner profitable to itself, under the complex and sometimes varying conditions of life, will have a better chance of surviving, and thus be naturaly selected. From the strong principle of inheritance, any selected variety will tend to propagate its new and modified form. Elsewhere we read: This preservation of favourable individual dif- ferences and variations, and the destruction of those which are injurious, I have called Natural Selection, or the Survival of the Fittest. Some exegesis of the operative words in these passages is called for. In particular, three ques- tions may be asked. Is Darwin's term selection synonymous with choice? Is survival to be taken in the precise meaning of the word or is it used figuratively, including the ability to reproduce? What does the term fittest, which Darwin adopted from Herbert Spencer, signify. in the context of the rest of the definition? Regarding the first question, Darwin says: In the literal sense of the word, no doubt, natural selection is a false term, but who ever objected to chemists speaking of the elective affinities of the various elements ?-and yet acid cannot strictly be said to elect the base with which it in preference combines. It has been said that I speak of natural selection as an active power of Deity; but who ob- jects to an author speaking of the attraction of gravity as ruling the movements of the planets? Everyone knows what is meant and is implied by such metaphorical expressions; and they are almost necessary for brevity. So again it is difficult to avoid personifying the word Nature; but I mean by Nature, only the aggregate action and product of many natural laws, and by laws the sequence of events as ascertained by us. It seems clear that, despite the fact that Darwin in his argument leaned very heavily on analogies between the results of purposeful and directed artificial selection of plants and animals by man with what is observed in the wild, he did not see in selection a process in which deliberative judgment or choice on the part of any agency plays a part. With respect to the second question, the mean- ing of survival, the vast majority of writers on evolution take Darwin's usage of this word liter- ally. They assume that Darwin meant that dis- crimination between what he considered the fit and the unfit was entirely by death and did not involve the broader and more relevant differences in ability to produce living offspring. Darwin, however, was not as naive as he is often repre- sented. In discussing struggle for existence, he says: "I should premise that I use this term in a large and metaphorical sense including dependence of one being on another, and including (which is more important) not only the life of the individual, but success in leaving progeny." Thus, although Darwin may have erroneously accepted the view that survival is necessarily the major component of natural selection, he understood that the crux of the selection process lies not merely in the ability of an individual to survive longer than others, but in its greater capacity for production of living offspring; that is to say, not only in survival of individuals within a generation, but of groups over a period of generations. This fact enables us to answer the third ques- tion, that regarding the interpretation which must be given the word fittest, or rather, the term fitness. The expressiveness of Spencer's super- lative seduced Darwin into accepting "survival of the fittest" as being equivalent to "natural selec- tion." As a result, many early evolutionists and a fair proportion of those naturalists of today whom the literature of population genetics has bypassed attached anthropomorphic value judg- ments to selection. Yet neither strength of char- acter nor moral goodness, neither extreme size nor high intelligence, nor even long life per se causes an individual to produce more offspring, that is to say, make it fit in Darwin's sense. In- deed, often organisms which are totally undis- tinguished by any physical standards, organisms exhibiting average dimensions for various prop- erties, in fine, individuals which are mediocre for any traits obvious to the human eye, are the ones that are most successful in propagating them- selves. They are therefore the fittest. If there is</page><page sequence="4">176 I. MICHAEL LERNER [PROC. AMER. PHIL. SOC. one thing upon which the most factious partisans of various currents of evolutionary thought agree, it is that fitness of an individual, in the context of the natural selection principle, can mean only the extent to which the organism is represented by descendants in succeeding generations. Fitness can be discussed in absolute terms or expressed relatively to the average of a group. Immediate or more remote generations of descent may be chosen as a point of reference. Enumeration of offspring or some other way of assessing the "amount" of progeny left may be resorted to. But in all instances, fitness must refer to the ability of an organism to leave surviving offspring. A habitual fallacy, shared by both the opponents and the supporters of evolution by natural selec- tion, is the idea that any part of evolution may be explained by saying that the fittest individuals have the most offspring. When fitness is considered with reference to evolutionary phenomena, such statement is logically circular and begs the ques- tion. If capacity of reproduction is the criterion of fitness, the only connecting proposition between reproduction and fitness which avoids tautology is that individuals having most offspring are the fittest ones. This is neither an assumption, nor a hypothesis to be proven, but merely a definition. Darwin's description of natural selection can now be paraphrased to say ( 1 ) that in nature individuals differ among themselves, (2) that their differences are in part determined by hered- ity, and (3) that, therefore, whenever these dif- ferences are correlated with fitness, that is, suc- cess in leaving offspring, the properties of the more fit individuals will be represented in suc- ceeding generations to an increasing extent. Thus, changes in the make-up of successive generations are determined in a measure by the inequalities between the reproductive rates of individuals dif- fering in hereditary endowment, that is to say, by different genotypes. More concisely, natural selection then is the differential reproduction of genotypes. The carriers of various genetic con- stitutions have phenotypes (to wit, somatic prop- erties whether or not they happen to be apparent to the human observer) which differ in their capacity to produce surviving progeny in their particular environment. The genotypic composi- tion of the next generation is then modified, and changes in phenotypes are produced to the degree to which phenotypes are genetically determined. ADVANCES SINCE DARWIN Darwin and Wallace arrived at their conclusions about the role of natural selection in evolution by deduction. Assuming the validity of their basic premises, natural selection can be inferred as a consequence independently of actual experience. The Origin of Species was essentially an attempt at a posteriori justification of Darwin's thesis based on the mustering of a great volume of descriptive evidence in its support. Since 1859 the premises underlying Darwin's chain of reasoning have been subjected to test many times. Thus, differential reproduction of individuals could often be ascer- tained by counting and statistical analysis of only a moderate degree of sophistication. Similarly, the dependence of such differential reproduction at least in part on hereditary differences was demonstrated both by verifiable inference from observation in nature and by laboratory experi- ment. But our achievements since Darwin are not limited merely to a further accumulation of examples (including those in ultramicroscopic or- ganisms not even dreamt of in Darwin's philos- ophy) or to the development of less equivocal proofs of evolution than Darwin had at his dis- posal. Much more can be said about post-Darwin- ian advances in the study of natural selection. A sampling of illustrations chosen from different areas of evolutionary knowledge charted in recent decades bespeaks this fact. The first of these may be provided by the in- sight that has been acquired into the basis of hereditary transmission. It is this knowledge that furnished the necessary link between selection and evolution. Darwin made somewhat vague refer- ences in The Origin of Species to the operation of the "strong principle of inheritance." He was fully aware of the deficiencies in his knowledge of the mechanism of heredity. They led him to formulate a speculative and somewhat improbable, even in the light of a century ago, hypothesis of blending inheritance. This principle in turn forced Darwin to espouse the postulate that acquired characters were transmissable, because otherwise continued variability in natural populations could not be accounted for. It was not until Mendelian theory was developed that such pathetically art- less conjectures as, for instance, the direct hered- itary effects of use and disuse of organs and parts of the body, became superfluous. Three aspects of Mendelism were especially important in this connection: (1) the particulate basis of the units of inheritance to which we may refer as genes, (2)</page><page sequence="5">VOL. 103, NO. 2, 1959] NATURAL SELECTION 177 the distinction between phenotype and genotype, and (3) the statistical nature of the phenomena of heredity. It was also in large part Mendelian inheritance that resolved the problem of persistent variation and, more generally, led to the possibility of quantifying evolutionary processes. Symbolic representation of evolution, taking into account all but unique events, has now been ar- rived at. It is based on the description of the evolutionary process in terms of changes in the frequencies of alternative genes (or chromosomes) in a population. Indeed, the expression "survival of the fittest" can be applied with much more justice to the behavior of genes over many genera- tions than to that of individual organisms within one. From the quantitative approach an under- standing of the components of selection-induced alterations in fitness (those due not only to changes in gene frequencies, but also to modifica- tions of the environment and of the mating system, as well as to gene interaction) has been gained. Methods for estimating the extent to which a population can be transformed by selection have been devised. Quantitative bases for systems of correlated response (i.e., effects on traits which themselves are not being subjected to selection pressure) characterizing changes under selection have been established. The utility of these de- velopments for breeding practice is obvious. But equally important are the possibilities they have opened for a quantitative approach to selection in terms of observations of living beings in nature or of the paleontological record. Another sphere of study which has contributed to an increased comprehension of a natural selec- tion is that dealing with the materials on which selection operates. The notion that individuals differ in hereditary endowment presupposes that a mechanism by which such differences can arise exists. Selection experiments, followed by the discovery of artificial means of producing muta- tions in the hereditary material, and the many elaborate investigations on the nature of mutational changes and effects, made it clear that hereditary variants on the gene level do not arise as a consequence of selection. Variability for selection to act upon must therefore be supplied by mutation (or subsequent to mutation, by hybridization). It is not entirely correct to say, as has often been done, that the mutation process is a completely haphazard one. The structures that mnutated genes can assume are not random. For instance, not all possible combinations of the elements of which genes are made possess the power of self-duplica- tion, without which genes would not exist. But the non-randomness of mutations does not mean that selection determines the direction of pheno- typic effect which gene mutations have. More recent studies, including those on the physical chemistry of hereditary material, may be expected to clarify eventually many related points which are still obscure. For example, the question of how random the genes subjected to selection are with respect to their spatial relations within organized units of higher order, such as chromo- somes, needs additional elucidation which breeding experiments with any of the higher organisms are incapable of supplying efficiently. Similarly, the relation between the amount of actual structural change involved in a gene mutation and the degree of phenotypic effect the change may lead to in the developing or adult organism still remains to be explored. The relative importance in different circumstances of the hierarchy of selection mate- rials-genes, chromosomes, genomes, total geno- types, populations-is another aspect of evolution on which more light may be expected to be forth- coming. On another level, the relationships between nat- ural selection and adaptation has been illuminated by the semantic analysis of the term fitness. The early evolutionists chose their examples of adap- tive traits, presumed to have originated by selec- tion, on the basis of entirely anthropomorphic interpretations as to what constitutes an advantage to a plant or animal. We now know that adaptive traits are those contributing to increased fitness in any way whatever, rather than only those with spectacular manifestations on the ingenuous level of Kipling's Just So Stories. The important ef- fects of natural selection are more subtle than the provision of tigers with stripes or leopards with spots for alleged purposes of camouflage. Physi- ological and biochemical properties very often are more likely to be of significance in determining an individual's fitness than are conspicuous mor- phological differences which sometimes may be by-products rather than criteria of selection. More- over, fitness is determined by a combination of a great many somatic features, or rather by the phenotype as a whole. It follows from this: (1) that the selective value of any one character may vary, depending on the particular totality of traits in which it is found, (2) that the selection pressure applied to any single trait (which, of course, is an abstraction by an investigator from the total</page><page sequence="6">178 1. MICHAEL LERNER [PROC. AMER. PHIL. SOC. phenotype) is bound to be very small, and (3) that, considered with respect to single genes, the process of natural selection is usually very slow. These deductions accord well with the evidence on the rate and complexity of evolutionary change in nature which tended to puzzle the early Dar- winians. They also lead to the idea that the most adapted kind of individual is not one conforming to some phenotypic norm, but rather one whose develop- ment and reproductive life history is adjustable to varying environmental conditions in such a man- ner as to preserve high fitness. The most suc- cessful population is similarly one that can meet the challenge of environmental changes between generations. In other words, homeostatic devices stabilizing the individual's own reproductive per- formance have a high selective value, while a heterogeneous genetic make-up, even behind a uniform phenotypic faqade within a single genera- tion, may be an advantage to a population. These considerations, backed by ever-accumulating ex- perimental and descriptive evidence, suggest the importance in evolutionary thought of such con- cepts as buffered and balanced genotypes, in- tegrated gene pools, and coadaptation, which no doubt will be discussed on this occasion by others. I would, nevertheless, like to call attention to these general ideas, without entering into the ex- position of their full meaning, in alluding to some other aspects of natural selection. For one thing, they are of -significance in the process in which natural selection, by utilizing interactions between components of genotypes, endows whole popula- tions with properties transcending those attribut- able to their individual members. For another, these concepts are relevant to the currently con- troversial issue regarding the autonomy of single genes in the selection process. Reducing the argument to its simplest terms, there is, on the one hand, the belief that the selective values of genes are reasonably indepen- dent of the genotypic combinations in which they occur. That is to say, genes which are found to be highly deleterious to fitness when forming part of one genotype are, in this view, considered ex- tremely unlikely to be advantageous in another genotype. Ranged on the opposing side is the opinion that, since selection is primarily concerned with genotypes, the effects of individual genes in a given genetic context are not necessarily pre- dictable from their behavior in another -genetic background, be it only different with respect to a single member of a gene pair. Needless to say, the proponents of neither view claim that their interpretation entirely excludes the contrary one. Rather, the argument relates to the comparative importance of the two kinds of genes (those with predictable and those with unpredictable behavior) in evolution and in breeding practice. The same question can also be raised, with some poignancy, with reference to the human species, since, for example, estimates of the extent of genetic damage produced by ionizing radiation differ on the al- ternative hypotheses of gene action. These broad issues also bear upon the relative importance of the different types of selection which we have learned to distinguish since Darwin's day. Thus directional selection produces trans- formation of a population along the time axis, while disruptive selection may result in the split- ting of a group into subgroups. These two kinds of selection are progressive, in the limited sense of leading to new forms of life. Stabilizing selection is conservative. It operates by rejection of vari- ants and maintains the population at an equilib- rium. Of the several forms of pressure antagon- istic to the preservation of fitness which selection must counterbalance, those of mutation and seg- regation are of greatest import. Elimination of deleterious mutants by selection is a process that has been long recognized. The significance of selection against non-optimal genotypes which arise in every generation as a result of segregation of chromosomes in the process of germ-cell for- mation, however, has been appreciated only re- cently. Studies from many fields, for example, those on wild and cage populations of Drosophila, on artificial irradiation, on the use of hybrid vigor in breeding economic plants and animals, on cytogenetics of grasshoppers, on aberrant forms appearing under intense inbreeding, and many others, argue for at least as great an evolutionary importance of selection against segregation as of that against mutation. Mutations are needed to provide a basis for further evolution. But the ones not useful at any given time in the phylogeny of a population are eliminated or kept from in- creasing in frequency by selection. Without selec- tion against segregation genetic variability already present could be lost. William Blake's affirmation that "to be an error and to be cast out is a part of God's design" seems to be an apt description of selection against both mutation and segregation,</page><page sequence="7">VOL. 103, NO. 2, 1959] NATURAL SELECTION 179 though invoking Blake in this connection leaves me open to the charge of citing the Scriptures to my own purpose. Another evolutionary precept which has been recognized since Darwin (in fact, in contradiction to Darwin) is that selection, far from being blind, operating entirely by chance, and begetting suc- cessful kinds of organisms only as a result of improbable accidents, may be correctly described as a creative process. This term can, of course, be used in a variety of senses. In reference to natural selection its meaning is well illustrated by quoting what Michelangelo conceived the process of creation to be. The opening lines of one of his best known sonnets says in a somewhat free translation: The best of artists has that thought alone Which is contained within the marble shell; The sculptor's hand can only break the spell To free the figures slumbering in the stone. In the same way, natural selection does not originate its own building blocks in the form of mutations of genes. Btut from them it does create complexes; it solves in a diversity of ways the great variety of problems that successful individ- uals and populations face; it builds step by step, even if by trial and error, entities of infinite com- plexity, ingenuity, and be one inclined to say so, beauty. Granted that it needs appropriate raw materials, that it may not necessarily be able to make a silk purse out of a sow's ear; yet, inter- acting with other evolutionary mechanisms, it has created the human species out of stuff which in its primordial stage may have looked no more promising. MISCELLANEOUS IMPLICATIONS The epithet creative is often interpreted to mean effectively causing, in the Aristotelean sense. In- deed, taking mutant genes and higher order com- ponents of genotypes as the material cause of evo- lutionary change, application of the adjective crea- tive to natural selection is undoubtedly sanctioned by our present knowledge of the process. None- theless, the term raises some fundamental ques- tions regarding causalities in evolution and may even provoke charges of teleology, long a dirty word in science. I do not mean, of course, that any mystical doctrines of ends involving inner per- fecting principles or entelechy can be imputed to modern evolutionists. Neither design by super- natural agencies, nor an elan vital, from a compre- hensive laboratory analysis of which we are sup- posedly forever barred, nor yet any guiding plan of morphological and physiological perfection, needs detain us in this discussion. Indeed, Berg- son and other militant teleologists of yesteryear would find little comfort in the distinct possibility that, if there is an Aristotelean final cause of evolu- tion which directed all preceding events in the animate world, it may turn out to be the Gotter- dammerung initiated by man's mastery of sub- atomic forces. Be that as it may, there is no necessity to assume that increased adaptation of organisms under natural selection represents the purposive end of the evolutionary process. Adap- tation and adaptability simply provide means toward increased fitness; they should be viewed not as causes but as consequences of natural selection. At the same time it must be realized that natural selection depends, in addition to variation (production of materials for selection to work on) and heredity (perpetuation of successful variants), on still a third factor, namely, the potentiality to produce young in excess of parental numbers. Only in the presence of this factor can inequalities of rate of reproduction between individuals exist in a group not heading for extinction. When the inequalities systematically relate to genotypic dif- ferences between individuals, natural selection is said to take place. In other words, while' capacity for propagation beyond that needed to maintain constant population size does not ensure that natural selection will occur, it is a necessary con- dition for natural selection in any group which is to survive. Darwin, who was, of course, mechanistically minded, spoke somewhat obscurely of the laws of Growth and Reproduction underlying selection. Samuel Butler came out directly with the vitalistic tenet that there exists a "universal innate desire on the part of every organism to live beyond its income." We may instead talk of an empirically discovered biological analogy to the first law of motion, namely that living matter if left alone will tend to increase itself indefinitely. Whatever the formulation, natural selection must always operate to maintain or to increase the frequency of genotypes which have the highest relative fitness. This process as a rule cannot lead to a decrease in absolute fitness except under special circum- stances involving changes in the direction of selec- tion or in mating system. The exceptions do not invalidate the proposition that natural selec-</page><page sequence="8">180 I. MICHAEL LERNER [PROC. AMER. PHIL. SOC. tion defined as inequality of reproductive ability, that is to say, of fitness, also causes fitness to in- crease. Thus we are either attributing immanency to natural selection, or at the least, after having eliminated one tautology by our definition of fit- ness, we have come upon another. Logical dilem- mas of this sort are, of course, not unique to the issues involved in natural selection or, indeed, to biology in general. I am sure that any competent philosopher could easily solve seeming paradoxes of this kind. The difficulty is that no two schools of philosophy seem to agree on the correct solu- tion. It was for good reason that Bertrand Russell once said that causality is one of the two great scandals (induction being the other) in the philos- ophy of science. I have mentioned the problem here merely to indicate that, with all of the knowl- edge now acquired on the process of selection in nature, its logical status in evolution is still un- certain and undoubtedly controversial. It was very likely misplaced confidence in their comprehension of natural selection or, perhaps, confusion between evolution as a law and natural selection as its instrumentality, that has led nu- merous social scientists and political philosophers of various hues and persuasions to project the notion of natural selection from biological to cul- tural systems. Such terms as progressive adapta- tion, struggle for existence, survival of the fittest, proved to be equally irresistible to materialists and idealists, to mechanists and teleologists, to prophets of laissez faire capitalism and to heralds of the proletarian revolution. Yet, as has already been noted, the only value connotation that natural selection in its proper interpretation has refers to reproductive ability. Furthermore, it operates in a self-perpetuating system of particulate units, the relative proportions of which in a population change as a consequence of selection. Is there really an exact or even a moderate analogy of this principle in social evolution? If so, it does not seem to have been established by any of the varieties of self-styled social Dar- winists, especially when social institutions are dealt with. It is, indeed, possible that intergroup selection occurs between religious or cultural seg- ments of the human species whenever they differ in birth rates. But the often-asserted inevitability of communist domination of the world, for ex- ample, is not rooted in unequal reproductive rates. Again, ethically dubious business practices al- legedly sanctioned by the purported natural law of dog-eat-dog, seem remote from the biological phenomenon from which they are supposed to derive support. Perhaps, the source of confusion does lie in the value constructs of "steady ad- vance," "struggle for survival" and so forth, which have become attached to natural selection by its early enthusiasts. Darwin himself, taking the cue from Wallace, Galton, and Spencer, has unfortunately contributed to these mists of error, especially in The Descent of Man, though even in that book he confined himself, broadly speaking, to biological and not to social aspects of "natural selection as affecting civilized nations." That organic evolution is based on natural selec- tion can be considered to be demonstrated. Whether cultural evolution, in which generations communicate with each other by means different from information coded within replicates of the units of hereditary transmission, also is, remains to be seen. Needless to say, Mendelism is not a prerequisite to natural selection. Cytoplasmic transmission of particles, whatever its role in evo- lution is, can, no doubt, be shown to be subject to the same process. But self-propagation is essential to natural selection, whereas systematic historical changes in the extra-biological aspects of the world surrounding us could have happened without natural selection in the biological sense of the term. A possible exception to this dictum may be found in the events leading to the origin of life. If autocatalytic processes of reproduction can be said to have occurred before protoplasm made its appearance on earth, chemical evolution culminat- ing in living matter could have depended, as has been suggested by some, on natural selection. On the other hand, if the view is taken that self-re- production is the exclusive property of living matter, natural selection cannot have antedated life. One more point with reference to common misinterpretations of the basis of natural selection may be considered. It has often been said that the development of modern medicine and other technological advances combined with certain hu- manitarian and religious notions has led to the suspension of natural selection in man. As evi- dence, exercise of therapeutic measures against various congenital diseases is cited and examples are given from an increasing list of defects which used to be, but no longer are, disabling. It is assumed that carriers,-of genotypes predisposing to such conditions were in the past at a selective disadvantage, while currently their reproductive ability is not under any handicap. Hence, it is</page><page sequence="9">VOL. 103, NO. 2, 1959] NATURAL SELECTION 181 argued, natural selection is being interfered with by euthenic measures. More often than not, a dire warning that the human race is thereby slowly committing suicide is added. It is entirely true that many genotypes which rendered their possessors unfit in earlier days do so no more. Natural selection now, therefore, is not based on the same components of fitness or results in the same directional changes as before. But this is by no means the same thing as saying that natural selection is not operative. What has happened is that the environment, the adjudicator of which genotypes are fit, has been altered. The therapy that has become available is a feature of the new environment. The determinants of fitness may have become changed, but inequalities in re- production were not thereby eliminated. An anal- ogy is provided by one of the classical cases of empirically observed natural selection in a lower form of life. In certain species of moths dark and light colored forms occur. The dark kind is generally hardier and hence would have been expected to be more fit. However, its melanic pigmentation makes it more conspicuous to predators. There- fore, in early observations at certain localities the light forms were generally found to be more numerous than the dark ones. Since the Industrial Revolution, however, increasing amounts of soot and similar waste products began to spread around the countryside. This provided increased pro- tection' to the melanic forms in manufacturing districts. As a result, their higher reproductive capacity now gave them an advantage over the light forms so that in many industrial areas the latter now approach extinction. Natural selection here has reversed its direction. A gene that was deleterious in its net effects in the earlier environ- ment has now become advantageous. The basis of fitness has been changed, but natural selection still went on. This kind of change has undoubtedly occurred many times in the past history of man, for instance, when fire-making tools were in- vented, thereby affording protection to some geno- types which were formerly disadvantageous. Susceptibility to many diseases may then not contribute any more to differences in fitness of man. It is not impossible that resistance became in some instances an encumbrance. More likely, however, major importance in determining fitness was assumed by genes in control of other pheno- typic traits. For instance, the genetically deter- mined aspects of the ability to provide young with food obtained by strength may have now lost their positive selective value. On the other hand, genes for philoprogenitiveness in a world in which con- ception is under man's volitional control may have become of correspondingly greater import in the selective process. Exactly how disgenic in terms of human values today's natural selection may be is difficult to tell. Selection which might have the most serious po- tential consequences to mankind could be that operating through the medium of differential re- productive rates of groups with differing intelli- gence. However, there are reasons to believe that this process may be of the stabilizing kind, main- taining constant genotypic frequencies rather than shifting them in a direction commonly agreed to be an undesirable one. Generally speaking, selection in man is probably not as stringent as it was in the past, though this is by no means certain. The immense increase in the average number of surviving offspring which occurred in the last century does not of itself constitute conclusive evidence for lowered selection intensity. In any case, the actual re- productive rate in man is, of course, still greatly below its biological maximum, which means that there is still considerable opportunity for selection to occur. Evidence that inequalities in fitness cur- rently observable are independent of genotypic constitutions would doubtlessly be difficult to ob- tain. Even so, it would seem that only when man has achieved such complete mastery over his en- vironment that all possible human genotypes will be equally likely to produce the average number of surviving progeny, can we be sure that natural selection has ceased in our species. IN CONCLUSION I have ranged somewhat widely, even if not deeply, over the subject assigned to me. Before closing I would like to make it clear that popula- tion genetics, the discipline which has contributed most to our present understanding of natural selection, is only entering the stage of adolescence. Its attainment of maturity depends on a synthesis with its sibling doctrines of physiological, bio- chemical, and other branches of genetics, which should bring into fuller clarity our picture of evolution, and should fill the numerous gaps in our knowledge of the organic world. Evolution is the most fundamental biological law yet dis- covered. Natural selection is the basic mechanism implementing it. The principle of descent with</page><page sequence="10">182 I.

But what we have learned so far about natural selection is ob- viously only the beginning. What remains to be learned is immeasurably more. Truth, said Bacon, is the daughter of Time, and one hundred years is not a long period in the history of mankind. Furthermore, giant-slayers abound in the scientific woods through which we have to travel to our goal of understanding ourselves and the living universe. It is then not inconceivable that the role now assigned to natural selection some day may have to be reevaluated. However, if more adequate explanations are found for the phenom- ena in the animate world which we currently view as being consequent to natural selection, the en- suing revolution in our thought will have to be as great as that produced by Darwin and Wallace a century ago.</page></plain_text>
