WILLIAMS University of California, San Diego GERALD ZURIFF Wheaton College PETER KILLEEN Arizona State University</page><page sequence="5">STATEMENT OF EDITORIAL POLICY Under the title Behaviorism, this journal was started two decades ago by Willard Day, a psychologist. In recent years, it was edited by George Graham, a philosopher, whose co editor for several years was Peter Killeen, another psychologist. Reflecting this duality of interest, the journal has made its mission to be publishing the philosophical ruminations of psychologists and the psychological reflections of philosophers. We, as editors, expect to continue this good tradition. Behavior and Philosophy will seek in the future, as it has in the past, to print discussions of the methods and metaphysics of psychology, if not (Thank God!) discussions of the psychology of methodologists and metaphysicians. You who read these free-ranging discussions are, we are aware, a broad-minded group of folk, with a catholic range of interests. You want to know about everything?behavioristics, genetics, physiology, neurophysiology, ethology, micro-economics, computers, linguistics, sociobiology, anthropology, etc.?that will enable you to understand behavior. We hope to be able to feed the full breadth of your interests, by publishing thoughtful and well-informed papers on classical and operant conditioning, connectionism, game theory, perception, the brain, artificial intelligence, language, scientific method?anything that explores the implications and assumptions of a promising approach, or exposes the defects of a wrongheaded approach, to the analysis of conduct. Our function as editors will be twofold. First, we will ask our referees to select papers that are both scientifically sound and philosophically significant. Second, we will insist that papers be written in a clear style using a vocabulary that makes sense to a learned but unspecialized audience. If you have, or know colleagues who have, essays that satisfy these requirements, the journal will welcome them and try to give them prompt, competent and fair review. Consult the Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association, or inspect a recent issue of this journal, for guidance on style; and send papers and reviews in triplicate (authors outside the United States may send one copy) to: Howard Rachlin, Associate Editor Behavior and Philosophy Department of Psychology State University of New York at Stony Brook Stony Brook, NY 11794-2500 or to Max Hocutt, Editor Behavior and Philosophy Department of Philosophy The University of Alabama Tuscaloosa, AL 35487-0218 Comments, criticism, suggestions and offers of help should go to the same address. Empirical studies should be sent elsewhere.</page><page sequence="6">Behavior and Philosophy Volume 22, Number 2 Fall/Winter 1994 Cambridge Center for Behavioral Studies, 1994. All rights reserved.
