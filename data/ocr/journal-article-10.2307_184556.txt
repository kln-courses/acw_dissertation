<plain_text><page sequence="1">Methodology of Modern Physics BY HENRY MARGENAU I. SURVEY ETHODOLOGY might be understood to mean a description of various individual procedures which have led to the successful solution of specific problems. In studying the subject of physics from this point of view, i.e. with special emphasis on method, one would naturally turn his attention to the traditional divisions of experimental and theo- retical physics, the former with its measuring devices and the latter with its mathematical technique. In no other sense than this does the term methodology make any direct appeal to the working physicist, and if you would ask him to define his methods he would probably answer with a description of experimental technique or the methods of setting up and solving differential equations. His answer would tell you how he solves his problems, but hardly how he finds them and why he solves them. Nor does he assume this restrictive attitude from ignorance of the larger setting of his problems. His reasons for it are partly those of the artist who refrains from comment upon the origin of his artistic conception; they arise in part from his systematic tendency to put first things first, for he is afflicted with a keen realization of the futility of attempts to discuss scientific method- ology in its fundamental implications before the incidental de- tails of his technique are understood. If he is very conservative he may even maintain that his field is entirely foreign to extra- 48</page><page sequence="2">H. Margenau 49 physical speculations such as those necessarily involved in a basic evaluation of his technique, and that any mingling of his physical notions with such speculations debases the former. But he is more likely to admit the justice of philosophical circumspection, professing, however, neither interest nor competence with regard to the latter. Again, his lack of interest is well founded, for is it not true that the late brilliant scientific advances have been least co6rdinated with conventionally sound philosophic judgment? Finally, there is some scientific modesty in the typical physi- cist's attitude toward "larger settings." In all his operations he prides himself on the accuracy of his judgments, he takes care not only to minimize his errors, but even to ascertain their probable magnitude. This he cannot do when he indulges in appreciative reflections upon the ultimate meaning of his work or upon its re- lation to the more speculative sciences. Hence he feels lost, being unable to use his customary tools, and he consequently avoids this awful territory. In spite of this well founded preference of the typical physicist for his own technical domain, it is not the description of special scientific procedures to which this paper will be devoted. For, after all, there are cogent reasons, reasons indeed which should appeal to physicists, for surveying the special methods applied in any science from a vantage point which places them in view simul- taneously. Unless this is done we shall be forever studying local currents and eddies in the larger stream composing our science, without discovering the general direction in which the water flows. True enough, we shall never know exactly where a boat, adrift on the stream of physics, will ultimately land, but we can, by taking a larger view and determining the main direction of flow, decide whether it will be worthwhile to set out at all. In less metaphori- cal language, what I shall try to undertake is to abstract from all specific and diverse physical procedures their common back- ground of method, to analyze their residual features and to esti- mate their epistemological significance. This task in itself is not new, and many attempts of carrying it through have been partially successful. I shall forego the op- portunity of criticising them in detail and merely point to a de-</page><page sequence="3">Methodology of Physics 50 fect that has been very common. The diversity of valid physical theories is extreme, and it is easy in designing a general methodol- ogy either to forget entirely, or to underrate the importance of, apparently stray tendencies. It will be found that most writers, especially those whose main interest lies in philosophy, are using mechanical theories and laws as the sole basis for their abstrac- tions, leaving out of account the non-mechanical ramifications of thermodynamics and electrodynamics. Indeed a methodology of physics is incomplete if it ignores the more formal reasoning which characterizes these two fields. In fact if we were permitted to limit ourselves to the experiments and theories dealing with large scale bodies our task would be a simple one. Difficulties arise, as we shall see, when we attempt to juxtapose highly formal methods and those perceptibly evident inferences which seem to govern large scale mechanics. It will also be necessary to bridge, not merely to contrast, the use of probability notions in some parts of physics with the idea of constrained evolution of mechanical states. These goals have not often been attempted, nor could they have been reached until fairly recently, for the very meaning of statistical theories, especially in connection with quantum mechanics, was not clearly understood; it seems to have crystal- lized only during the last few years. To bring the latest quantum mechanical developments within the range of a uniform methodol- ogy is perhaps the most difficult part of our task. It would be simpler if we could regard as a correct solution the interpretation of those who see in the new theories merely a rejection of causal description. But I believe that this extreme point of view, which on the surface seems to harmonize so well with the mathematical technique of the matrix theory, must be ultimately unsatisfactory and is due to an insufficient analysis of the basic concepts in- volved. It is necessary to admit that physical experience has in a sense become indeterminate, but the methods by which we describe physical states remain as causal as they were before. To put it crudely and in a manner which will receive its fuller meaning later, the world of physics has retained its causal con- sistency, while its connection with the perceptible world has been placed on a statistical footing. The recognition of the dichotomy</page><page sequence="4">H. Margenau 51 between the two worlds just mentioned is an essential feature of the doctrine which we are here proposing. To meet more definitely the attitude of the staunch realist who sees no possible value in any extra-physical speculations about physical methodology one may appeal to the following considera- tion. Such an attitude can be based only on one or the other of the two suppositions: (I) The domain of physics is entirely se- cluded from all other fields of human interest, each field of thought being self-sufficient and independent of cross-fertilization. (2) Physics is the science par excellence and will, in time, pervade all other types of endeavor; the reason why we acknowledge a dis- tinction at present is the imperfect state of analysis prevailing in the latter. Neither of these assertions can be said to be flatly false. But the first is clearly unsatisfactory in the sense that if it were to be ultimately true we should be sorry, for reason is unwilling to stop its inquiry in front of an array of pigeon-holes of which the contents are unconnected. If we maintain the sec- ond we are, I believe, indulging in an optimism for which there exists at present no sound basis. Perhaps the hope of such a pos- sibility has vanished with the materialism of the last century. But if we wish it to be true, that is if we claim for physics the pres- tige of being the final touchstone of truth, then it is evident that we must enrich its structure by principles and methods not at present embodied in its constitution. We are safe in maintaining, therefore, that it is no disgrace for the physicist to speculate about the meaning of his science. A methodology grows and changes with the expansion of knowl- edge. The impressive system of analysis outlined in Kant's "Critique of Pure Reason" was adequate for the science of his day, but his transcendental esthetics broke down when Einstein discovered the interrelatedness of time and space. More and more of his methodological principles crumbled away in the face of newly discovered facts. We are referring to this example be- cause it shows so clearly how the individual tenets of a specula- tive system were invalidated by individual physical discoveries, a process which in general takes place more obscurely. What- ever claims may be made for any methodology of physics, finality can not be among its merits.</page><page sequence="5">52 Methodology of Physics The question of method is very intimately bound up with the purpose or aim of scientific activity. It is only if we face squarely the somewhat annoying question: What is the physicist trying to do, that we come to grasp the nucleus of our problem. Let us, then, determine with some care the general object of the physi- cist's investigations. II. DIFFICULTIES IN CURRENT CONCEPTIONS It would be naive to settle the matter by statements of the sort: The physicist explains nature, or he discovers reality. For in what sense does he explain? Does not such an utterance merely push the entire mystery of the physicist's activities into the word "explain" and seal them up, hidden from popular view? And then again: in what sense is his reality real? Does he not rather invent than discover? To such questions we desire to find an answer. The object of physical investigation is not merely an accumula- tion of a certain type of knowledge, or of all the "facts regarding matter and energy," as elementary textbooks occasionally put it. The distinctive character of scientific systematization which per- vades this knowledge does not exhaust itself in mere classification of facts. The existence of satisfactory physical theories which go beyond facts is sufficient proof for the inadequacy of the view that regards physics as a mere aggregation of knowledge. But perhaps we are dealing with this argument in too summary a fashion. For there is, after all, a more painstaking group of analysts who will admit that a mere collection of facts does not make a science, but that aggregation must be supplemented by abstraction, synthesis and induction, processes which transform the collection into a logical array of facts. This claim, it must be observed, is usually made by those who wish to bar transcenden- tal elements from the realm of physics, and this wish is, perhaps unwittingly, the father of the thought. Hence to answer this assertion in toto one must destroy two illusions: first that physics is based solely upon the logical principles of deduction and in- duction; second that it is unscientific to harbor transcendental notions, that is notions which do not spring directly from ex-</page><page sequence="6">H. Margenau 53 perience. We have already dealt with the latter thesis in the preceding chapter and shall meet with it again. All of modern physics compels this view. The question of the intrusion of intrinsically non-empirical concepts into our science has ceased to be an academic one; only by taking proper account of them can we understand the recent formalization that has taken place in physics. But this is a point to which we must return. As to the contemporary structure of physics, even with the exclusion of the latest development which to some appear still slightly problematic and of doubtful security, this is certainly not a logical array of facts. For, though fact be taken in its widest possible meaning there can be no way of saying that the changing symbolism of atom clouds, electron waves, vacancies in the dis- tribution of electrons can represent facts. I am not trying to belittle these physical notions; if anything, I am belittling facts. Facts are far too crude to fit into the delicate texture of physical theories; it is to mitigate their crudeness that the latter exist. It is true that logical principles, like deduction and induction, are used in physical as in all other reasoning, but their use is by no means characteristic. Induction, in particular, is used only as a tentative procedure; that is, the propositions to which it leads are always subjected to empirical verification and never pro- claimed as certainties. For this reason, whilst the physicist em- ploys inductive reasoning, he need not trouble himself with the profound problems involved in a logical analysis of induction.l Next we come to the view, widely held at present, which iden- tifies the object of physical investigation with the acquisition of facilities to predict. It can not be denied that physics provides such facilities in an ever increasing measure and that its practical value largely resides therein. But is not this advantage rather a by-product than the sole end of research? Scientific knowledge is power and will forever be power; nevertheless there are many who claim that they would pursue their scientific endeavors even if this were not true. They call their motive, somewhat enig- matically, love of research, much as though it were a natural in- 1 As presented in the work of Mill, Jevons, Russell, Keynes.</page><page sequence="7">54 Methodology of Physics stinct whose satisfaction gave them pleasure, and this pleasure is not peculiar to the act of prediction; it is present whenever a problem is solved. Among these, we believe, would be some of the most successful physicists. Thus it seems, at least from a psychological point of view, that the driving force in physical investigation can not be exclusively the fun or the profit of prediction. Then, too, there are numerous physical theories which, thus far, have failed to make any noteworthy predictions. The theo- ries of molecular binding and of ferromagnetism are among them. In these two fields experimental knowledge is so far ahead of "explanation" that a long time is likely to elapse before any sig- nificant purely theoretical predictions of new phenomena will be made. Yet both of the theories are regarded very important contributions despite their remote chance of predicting. The value of physical theories is clearly not fixed in proportion with this particular merit. Nor does a physical theory lose its value when its range of application is almost closed and it is hardly in a position to enable further predictions. The misconception that scientific research be essentially a matter of predicting new phenomena has produced a most in- sidious practice not altogether uncommon among contemporary physicists. The scheme is to publish, from time to time, a suffi- cient number of predictions without giving detailed reasons for them, so that at least a few of them will come true by the laws of chance. Since valid predictions are very impressive and the memory of blunders tends to fade away, this scheme is sometimes regarded a vehicle to fame. Evidently the physicist's business involves something more than prophecy, something that makes his experience peculiarly coherent and produces an internal fitness which facility for pre- diction alone does not convey. We know a great deal, for in- stance, about the phenomena attending the flow of an electric current through a wire at very low temperature and we have a strong desire to understand them. In spite of this experimental knowledge, in spite of the fact that we can predict many of the things which will happen when similar experiments are tried, it</page><page sequence="8">H. Margenau 55 is felt that this subject is in an unsatisfactory state, and physicists would be grateful for a (correct) theory which will do no more than "explain" these facts. The meaning of this term, explain, is the object we are seeking. Is it the exposure of causal relationships? This is indeed fre- quently asserted. To decide the issue conclusively one must look more closely at the meaning of the word cause. An occur- rence or event is said to be the cause of another if it precedes the latter invariably in time. Let us not worry too much at this point about the phrase "invariably," for we are not attempting here a critical discussion of the matter but only to find the cus- tomary use of the term. Moisture in the air, we say, is the cause of rainfall, or economic maladjustment the cause of war. It is to be noted that the causal relation connects two situations both of which are perceptible or, in a sense to be defined later, both are data. But this is perhaps the most primitive use of the word and clearly one that has little to do with physical research. As we have seen, the physicist does not satisfy himself with a record of facts, not even if they are placed in their correct temporal order. It is true, of course, that causal relationships of this type are the basis on which he prospers, but it is equally clear that he elevates himself far above them. We can also say: A certain thought is the cause of a question; or a given mathematical condition is the cause of a special solu- tion, without running any risk of being misunderstood. Here the word is employed in a different way, for the situations which are connected are no longer perceptible, and the time element is pushed slightly in the background. To be sure, the physicist often uses cause exactly in this way, as when he speaks of mass as causing a gravitational field, or of conditions causing con- straints. In fact all imperceptible concepts occurring in physical theories are embedded in causal connections of this type, but to place concepts in such relations does not constitute a physical theory. Again we see that the statement "the object of physics is to set up causal relations" aims at the target but misses the mark. For, besides being related among themselves, these con- cepts must be in some way connected with experience.</page><page sequence="9">56 Methodology of Physics Obviously now, there is a third manner of using the term cause, exemplified by the statement: an electromagnetic field of rapidly fluctuating intensity is the cause of the sensation of light, or the chair which I kicked has caused me pain. Here a relation is set up between something that is perceptible and something that is not. The time element has nearly dropped out of the picture and its place has been taken by a curious notion of enforcement. The use of the wqrd has become very hazy indeed, as probably even those will admit who attach little weight to the difficulties attending the relation between stimulus and perception. Philos- ophers sometimes argue that this use of cause is unfortunate and should be abandoned. To this conclusion I should like to sub- scribe, not so much out of philosophical convictions, as because it is unwise to use one term in too many different ways. However, it is precisely this latter sense in which most advocates of "causal explanation" wish the word cause to be understood. They would suggest that physics supplies unobservable causes for the events of experience, thus rounding off the universe in a satisfactory fashion. Statements of this kind can not be spared the criticism of indiscrimanacy of speech. But there is a more serious reflection upon this view. People who hold it are not always careful to keep the notions distinct. Thus, by using the term cause in the last sense, the force of grav- ity may be said to be the cause of a body's fall. By using it in the first one could say: the force of my arm (muscular exertion) is the cause of the stone's flight. In both cases the antecedent is a force, the consequent a type of motion, the relation is said to be causal. Nevertheless every physicist realizes that the term force in the last case is not understood in its true physical sense, but one of sensory perception. Thence has sprung the confusion in the meaning of force, and the resultant difficulty, known to every teacher of physics, of conveying to the beginning student a properly abstract and non-anthropomorphic conception of this physical quantity. Force is not something that can necessarily be described as a push or a pull. Let us now, after finding such an immoderate amount of fault with supposedly current notions, set out to determine the object and the course of physical investigation.</page><page sequence="10">H. Margenau 57 III. PHYSICAL RESEARCH AS SYMBOLIC CONSTRUCTION Physical inquiry in its essential form moves along a peculiar cycle: it starts with definite, perceptible matters of facts; pro- ceeds from there into a field in which at least some of the ele- ments of operation are not directly perceptible, where there is greater freedom from empirical constraints; and finally it emerges again in the realm of perceptible facts. To illustrate: we ob- serve a falling body, or many different falling bodies; we then take the typical body into mental custody and endow it with the abstract properties expressed in the law of universal gravitation. It is now no longer the body which we originally perceived, for we have added properties which are neither immediately evident nor empirically necessary. If it be doubted that these properties are in a sense arbitrary we need merely recall the fact that there is an alternate, equally or even more successful physical theory- that of general relativity-which ascribes to the typical bodies the power of influencing the metric of space, i.e. entirely different properties from those expressed in Newton's law of gravitation. We are here clearly operating on a plane where there are fewer constraints than in the domain of perceptible facts. But having specified these properties, we at once return to the latter and say that the planets should revolve about the sun in elliptical orbits, or that the perihelion of mercury should advance through a speci- fied angle per century. To be sure, a great amount of mathe- matical reasoning is involved in this simple return, but this represents only a formal expansion or modification of the proper- ties produced in the former act of speculative creation. We say that our "explanation" of the original observation, the falling of bodies, is in error if the latter propositions are empirically false. In case of their verification it may be either correct or false. Our procedure begins and ends among matters capable of percep- tion, the totality of which we shall call nature for the sake of definiteness. Let us choose another example. The physicist observes, as part of nature, the deflections of an ammeter placed in an electric circuit. In particular does he notice the changes in the position of the pointer which take place as he introduces more or less wire</page><page sequence="11">58 Methodology of Physics into the circuit. He then invents, in the privacy of his specula- tions, entities of which he has never made the acquaintance through his senses although he may feel that he has perceived "similar" things in other connections; these entities were named electric current, resistance, electromotive force. If you press him, however, he will admit that no stock is to be placed in this similarity aside from its helpfulness in visualization, and that these entities are characterized by the properties which are as- sumed for them, that is, the relations in which they can enter. In the present instance, one such relation is Ohm's Law. This, of course, does not exhaust their definitional properties, for they may also enter relationships with other constructs (heat gener- ated, etc.) not here introduced. From Ohm's Law we can then predict other experiences, which, if verified, lend some support to this mode of explanation. It is important in this connection to see that the return trip to nature is made possible by placing the speculative elements themselves, i.e. current, resistance, elec- tromotive force, in definite correspondence with experience. We must know how to identify in a quantitative way the experimen- tal counterpart of a current, resistance or E.M.F. The physicist expresses this by saying that he "measures" current strength, resistance, or E.M.F. The same phenomenon permits an alternative explanation. The physicist can make his notion of an electric current more definite by supposing it to be a stream of entities known as elec- trons. To these electrons he assigns properties such as being charged, or of producing certain effects when set in motion, ef- fects which are observable only through their experimental con- sequences. The electrons themselves are never objects of per- ception despite the intriguing vividness of Wilson's cloud tracks or the moving oil drops in Millikan's famous experiment. They can not be said to constitute nature in the sense in which we wish to employ the term. (Cf. also ?V.) But from the notion of electrons we can, by virtue of definite rules of operation, go back to nature and make specific statements about perceptible matters of fact. There is not of necessity any conflict between these two ex-</page><page sequence="12">H. Margenau 59 planations of the same phenomenon. For we may satisfactorily assume as one of the properties of electrons that their motion constitutes a current of the former kind, thereby rendering the first explanation reducible to the latter. The electron theory of current flow has the semblance of greater concreteness and makes, perhaps, a more direct intuitive appeal. But, we repeat, the construct of an electron is just as remote from the source of physical inquiry, nature, as is the less easily imaginable notion of a current of electricity, with electricity intuitively undefined. This semblance of difference has led to the distinction between phenomenological explanation-the type which satisfies itself with constructs of little or no imaginative appeal-and, causal explanation, such as the electron theory. It is clear from the foregoing considerations that the use of the latter term is very much to be discouraged, and that, on the whole, the distinction is illusory. This last point, however, is one to which I shall re- turn later. The full course of physical explanation, as we have now seen, begins in the range of perceptible awareness, swings over into what we shall now term the field of symbolic construction, and returns to perceptible awareness, or, as we have said, nature. The field of symbolic construction is populated with many en- tities, such as masses, electrons, electromotive forces, which we shall call constructs of explanation, or, more briefly, constructs. These will be subjected to closer scrutiny as we proceed. The essential feature of a physical explanation is evidently the transi- tion from nature to the realm of constructs, and the reverse. These transitions are governed by rules of which we must gain a clearer conception. But before we consider the relation between these two classes of concepts it is well to direct attention to sev- eral points which can easily give rise to misunderstanding. I have not been very specific in the exposition of the meaning of "nature." The term is obviously not used with its customary significance. We have defined it as the totality of all matters capable of sensory perception, including thereby hallucinations as well as bona fide sense impressions. The former are, of course, of no interest to the physicist, and we shall suppose that there</page><page sequence="13">6o Methodology of Physics are means of eliminating them from the remainder of nature. Again, not all the rest of perceptible situations have hitherto be- come the starting point of physical explanations, but they must be regarded as holding such potentiality for the future. But now arises the question, so vexing to many philosophers: Are we going to deal with nature merely as a complex of aware- ness, or must we attribute to it the status of transcendental ob- jectivity? It is very fortunate, I feel, that physics is not forced to make this decision. In fact we can, and shall in these con- siderations, pursue the most cautious and possibly the wisest, course of regarding nature to be merely the aggregate of our per- ceptible experiences. I confess to the belief that the reader will not doubt the existence of such an aggregate in his own mind, and that this aggregate is largely similar to that which I have accumulated myself. If I am wrong in this supposition there is nothing further to say, for physics, as well as any other science, is founded upon this miracle. On the other hand, if any one wishes to go farther, as most physicists do, and postulate an ob- jective nature he is free to do so at his own risk; no science can compel this step. This paper is written from the point of view of one who is unwilling to sacrifice a grain of certainty for a pound of common sense evidence. Accordingly, we should replace the common term data, which occupies so prominent a place in the physicist's vocabulary, by habita, implying that there may exist no external agency to which we are indebted for its gifts. (I will add that on my part this attitude is purely academic.) But to avoid the coining of a new and strange term we shall continue to speak of the elements of nature from which the reasoning of physics starts, as physical data. Every datum has the attributes of extension and duration. To determine the precise logical sense in which space and time may be said to be attributes of nature is a problem which need not be solved for the present purposes; the only point to be observed is that they are very essential attributes, so essential in fact that a datum not in time and space not only fails to be realized but is even unimaginable. It is for this reason that all constructs, which, as we have seen, must be accessible from physical data</page><page sequence="14">H. Margenau 6i (in a manner to be discussed in ?IV), partake of temporal and spatial qualities in order to provide a possibility for correspond- ence with nature. It is sometimes asserted2 that all physical data are pointer readings. A statement of this sort is likely to emphasize the quantitative precision which the physicist enforces within his nature-there is no difficulty in the fact that we can arbitrarily enlarge and modify our perceptible experience-and this emphasis is certainly well placed. But as a statement of fact it seems in error. While pointer readings form by far the largest class of physical data, there are at least two others. The first comprises experimental decisions between two alternatives: Does a certain phenomenon occur or not? The very appearance or absence of a band in the spectrum of a given molecule may be a perfectly significant datum. The other is that group of experiments in which the investigator relies on counting individual events, e.g. the clicks of a relay attached to a Geiger counter. Many of the data of nuclear physics, recently acquired, are of this type. Thus pointer readings, while of very great importance among physical data, possess no peculiar distinction and do not exhaust the possibilities. This remark is not idle, for no satisfactory methodology can be constructed on an oversimplified basis. The physical concepts belonging to the class called nature, such as position, matter,3 spatial coincidence or distinctness, motion, etc., present no greater difficulty of definition than do other properties of so-called concrete things. Some of them, e.g. posi- tion, are usually taken as primary concepts of which the meaning is intuitively evident, and the others, like spatial coincidence, may then be defined in terms of them. But a far greater complexity arises in connection with the other class of concepts which we have termed constructs of explanation. For it is often true that here a single construct admits of many different definitions, of which two are typical, and it is important that these be distin- guished. To be specific, let us select a few illustrative constructs at random: mass, temperature, electron, magnetic field strength, 2 E.g., by A. S. Eddington, The Nature of the Physical World. 3 Matter is a datum, but mass is a construct in the sense here advocated.</page><page sequence="15">62 Methodology of Physics magnetic field. Let us admit at the outset that no definition is an internally closed affair; it always presupposes certain terms to be understood or situations to be realized. We shall find this to be true when we attempt to define these constructs. Now then, how can we define mass? One possible procedure is to select a standard physical operation which can be performed upon every object to which we desire to ascribe a mass. We may then define mass as a definite functional relation between certain re- sults of this standard procedure.4 This definition is equivalent to the assignment of a perceptible, quantitative counter part to the symbolic construct "mass." It is, however, not unique, for there is a great number of processes which might be chosen as stand- ards, e.g., gravitational interaction of two bodies and observa- tion of accelerations, attachment of a body to an elastic spring and observation of the resulting acceleration, etc. Logically, each of these defines a different mass. An alternative definition is available if, for example, we suppose the concepts of force and acceleration to be understood, for we can then say in general that mass is the ratio of force to accelera- tion (speaking non-relativistically, of course) without specify- ing a single operation. It is true that from a physical point of view this definition is equivalent to the former because it happens that the mass of a single body is independent of the choice of force, so that standardization does not detract from the general- ity of the definition. Indeed if this were not so the concept of mass defined in the present manner would be devoid of physical interest, but not of meaning.5 Viewed logically, the definition of the present paragraph, which is not itself in terms of experi- mental operations (the auxiliary concepts involved may be thus defined!) and which I will term the constitutive definition, is different from that in the preceding paragraph, to be called the epistemic definition. Constitutive definitions are largely frowned upon by physicists, and epistemic ones are often considered the only admissible type. Nevertheless the interdependence of the 4 See for instance E. Mach, Science of Mechanics; R. B. Lindsay, Physical Mechanics. 6 This is contrary to the view expressed by P. W. Bridgman in The Logic of Modern Physics. See, however, H. Dotterer, Monist, 44, 231, I934.</page><page sequence="16">H. Margenau 63 two types is plain, and the fact is, I think, that in virtue of the epistemic definitions of our constructs we can measure, and in virtue of the constitutive definitions we are enabled to reason about the constructs. Epistemic definitions alone would leave physical constructs without coherence, moreover, there are con- structs which do not admit of this type of definition as we shall see. The present example is perhaps not very well adapted for exhibiting the necessity of constitutive definitions; the following one is more suitable to this end. Let us look at the construct temperature. We are well ac- quainted with its epistemic definition in terms of the efficiencies of reversible heat engines (Kelvin scale) or of thermometer read- ings. In this case, an important constitutive definition happens to be on record also, namely the mathematical one which charac- terizes Gibbs' modulus of distribution. This modulus, the reader will probably recall, is essentially identical with temperature. In the case of the electron we find the epistemic definition miss- ing, since the electron is not a construct to be "measured."6 Any definition by means of operations would fail to define it. It is not difficult, however, to define it constitutively by reference to other constructs of explanation, or by certain mathematical rela- tions which describe its properties. Magnetic field strength again is capable of both definitions: If we accept the validity of Maxwell's equations we can describe it fully in terms of measur- able accelerations of magnetic poles, as is customary; otherwise, if we grant independent meaning to all symbols except H in Max- well's equations we can, if we desire, define H by reference to these equations. The last of the constructs listed, the magnetic field, can not be defined epistemically; we must designate it as the region of space surrounding a magnet or current, or in some equivalent way. All constructs can be divided into two groups: Those which can be defined only constitutively (electron, magnetic field, atom, molecule, wave, photon, etc.), and those which are susceptible of both definitions (mass, temperature, field strength, force, 6 N.B. We do not question the possibility of measuring its charge or its mass, etc.!</page><page sequence="17">64 Methodology of Physics energy, etc.). Constructs belonging to the former group will be classed as physical systems, the others as quantities. Through their epistemic definitions all physical quantities are measurable; moreover, they acquire variability of amount. A combination of quantities with a system will be called a state. Later (? VII) we shall examine more carefully the ways in which states are formed; the simplest possible way is clearly a direct assignment of a certain number of quantities, each of given amount, to a specified system. But, as we shall see, the combination may be less direct. To summarize briefly with the use of the conventions now set up: For every set of data the physicist creates a set of constructs, in which systems are somehow combined with quantities, form- ing states. Both data and states are capable of temporal varia- tion. We must now consider by what rules, if any, the correlation between data and constructs is made. IV. GENERAL REQUIREMENTS REGARDING CONSTRUCTS OF EXPLANATION Physical explanation would be a useless game if therewere no severe restrictions governing the association of constructs with perceptible situations. For a long time it had been supposed that all permissible constructs must be of the kind often described as mechanical models or their properties, but this view is now recognized as inadequate. The only apparent justification for it arises from a false interpretation of the significance of con- structs, namely that which sees in them a composing part of some mysterious "reality." Our analysis has shown that they are different from what one should plausibly call nature; hence they need not satisfy the intuitive requirements of any fictitious reality. They may, in fact, be as abstract or insensible as we please (Cf. ?VI). A. But, while no restriction can be made as to their choice, their use is subject to very strong limitations. It is easy to find a set of constructs to go with a given set of data, but we require that there be a permanent and extensive correspondence between con-</page><page sequence="18">H. Margenau 65 structs and data. I hasten to illustrate the meaning of this un- intelligible label. Let us choose two examples from extreme parts of physical theory, the first from ordinary mechanics, the second from quantum mechanics. I. The initial set of data consists in the momentary perception of an apple in the process of falling to the ground. The corre- sponding group of constructs of explanation includes: two masses, those of earth and apple, each with properties described as mutual attraction according to the inverse square law. Many other combinations of constructs might be devised to correspond to the momentary set of data. But we now insist that the corre- spondence originally set up be maintained in time, in other words, that the changes in the state implied in the properties of our con- structs correspond to the changes in the data by the same rules which defined the original correspondence. In this particular case, the rule of correspondence is that the measurable accelera- I tion of the apple was to be proportional to ; we postulate that this shall be true at any later time. (This means, of course, that the acceleration shall be nearly constant, since R, the distance between center of earth and apple is practically constant.) Also, this correspondence shall hold whenever the apple is dropped again. This is what we mean when we postulate a permanent correspondence.-But we require more. We wish to apply the same rules, not only to every other apple, but even to every other body. Thus by assigning masses to the planets and then apply- ing the same rules of correspondence we may arrive at Kepler's Laws, and we demand that the entirely different set of data, motion of planets, conform to our expectation. We have ex- tended the range of applicability of our initial set of constructs by making it correspond to a wider range of nature. These matters are almost trivial; our recapitulation of them has the only purpose of showing how they fit into the scheme of a general methodology. 2. Let us pass to the second example. The group of data in question is the measurement of the frequency of a spectral ab- sorption line. Its constructional counterpart is a multitude of atoms characterized by mathematical quantities such as Hamil-</page><page sequence="19">66 Methodology of Physics tonian operators, definite assignments of degrees of freedom (number of electrons). Out of these we can build variable states (4-functions) which carry in themselves the rules of their tem- poral changes. This assignment of constructs is to be perma- nent in the sense that a) to every state there must correspond a perceptible situation,7 and b) whenever the measurement is re- peated the same group of constructs must be applicable. The correspondence in question has to satisfy the requirement of ex- tensibility, which may be seen from the following example. The Hamiltonian operator is modified if the absorption takes place in a gas under pressure, for then, by the properties of the con- structs under consideration, it acquires interaction terms. Their influence, again in accordance with the rules of correspondence peculiar to this system of explanation, is a definite change in the frequency of the spectral line which is actually observed. Many other instances of extension are imaginable, and most of them are experimentally verified. There is no sense in which the correspondence with which we are dealing can be said to be a one-to-one-correspondence. For in the first place, the smallest part of nature is not a datum, but a collection of data. An isolated element of perception, without relation and relata, is an absurdity. Secondly, every set of con- structs contains some for which there exists no single perceptible counterpart as one may easily verify by scanning the foregoing examples. As far as the permanence of the correspondence between con- structs and data is concerned the matter is fairly clear, for when- ever it fails the theory, i.e. the set of constructs, must be aban- doned. The extensive character of the correspondence, however, presents a somewhat different aspect. It is not true that a theory 7 This happens to be true; for if we allow the states of the constructs to develop under the influence of a light wave the distribution of frequencies in the spectral line changes in accordance with the initial rules of association between constructs and data. For instance, if the exposure to the light wave is short, the absorption line is broad; if it is long, the line is narrow. But it is important to observe that in this instance a construc- tional state does not determine a datum directly, but a probability distribution among data. This, however, is not contrary to the principles outlined above, which do not require the rules of association to be point for point direct.</page><page sequence="20">H. Margenau 67 is discarded unless it is uniformly applicable to all parts of physi- cal nature. The set of constructs used in the first example, the theory of gravitation, is not expected to correspond to all physi- cal data; electrical charges, for instance, are denied the property of (gravitational) mass, and this procedure is simply an arbitrary means of stopping the original correspondence. We say that the theory has a limited range of application. (That we can define mass electromagnetically and thereby widen the range is true but incidental; we could have chosen a different, but probably less familiar example.) Nevertheless we feel that there are enough data which are "explained" by this theory to warrant its retention. There is no exact criterion to fix the domain within which the constructs involved in any specific mode of explanation must cor- respond to experience. This indefiniteness is reflected in the difficulty of distinguishing a theory from an hypothesis. The latter is simply a theory which has, at present at least, a limited range of application. It is promoted to the status of a theory if and when its range is deemed sufficiently large to justify this more commendatory appellation; there is no sharp distinction. It may be of interest to examine a few physical theories from this point of view. First, there is the type whose constructs, to- gether with their relations to nature, can be extended to a coher- ent range of data, but fails curiously to explain a particular set of empirical facts. Lorentz' theory of the electron is an illustra- tion. Its central construct was a small spherical aglomeration of charge furnished with a number of abstract properties, all corre- lated with definite data. This symbolism explained, for a time at least, all known experiences collected under the heading of electrodynamics, except that it gave no account of the stability of the electron itself, which is demanded by its rules of correlation. The theory was not rejected on this score, but it was felt to be defective. In fact, this defect has not been removed at present. Secondly, there is the type of theory which can not be success- fully extended for the opposite reason: instead of explaining too little it explains too much. Here Schr6dinger's wave mechanics in its original form, that is, before it was supplemented by Pauli's</page><page sequence="21">68 Methodology of Physics famous exclusion principle, is a suitable illustration. According to the rules of this theory, the states of individual systems such as atoms or electrons can be combined in any arbitrary manner (the resulting I-function may be symmetrical, antisymmetrical, or mixed). But no correlate on the part of nature could be found for some of these constructs. It was only by limiting drastically the permissible combinations (Pauli Principle) that correspond- ence with nature was restored. Finally, it is possible for a single mode of explanation to fail on both of these counts. The early form of Dirac's theory of the electron, so successful in many respects, was guilty of this fault. It demanded the existence of negative kinetic energy electrons, constructs with properties so paradoxical that they could not possess an observable counterpart, and on the other hand it left the occurrence of electrons with positive charges unexplained. Both these difficulties are now eliminated by a brilliant modifica- tion which we shall discuss later (Cf. ? IX). We have seen that in trying to extend the correspondence be- tween a given set of constructs and a given set of data we often encounter obstacles of an essential kind. These have always been annoying to physicists and have prompted them to generalize or modify their constructs in a way that would avoid them. Great achievements have resulted from such efforts; long strides have been taken towards ultimate unification of the constructs of ex- planation. Indeed the successes, especially those attained in the general theory of relativity, are so sweeping as to suggest the question: Will it be possible to explain all of nature by means of one great symbolism, forming a hierarchy of constructs of which the basic ones are completely extensive without break? It is the hope and the inspiration of the theoretical physicist that it can be answered affirmatively, for this prospect alone makes his efforts in the deepest sense worthwhile. But like all ideals, it provides him with no assurance that it will ever be realized-we shall probably be forever approaching the object of our dream. Nevertheless there is fun in the approach. B. The requirement of permanent and extensive correspond- ence between constructs and data has an important supplement,</page><page sequence="22">H. Margenau 69 namely that of simplicity. It demands that the number of un- related constructs in any theory be small. Again, this require- ment is not perfectly definite; but this lack of uniqueness is no lack of precision in our formulation of physical methodology: it corresponds to an actual indefiniteness in our choice of theories. There can be rival theories explaining the same range of data with equal success. If one involves as few constructs as the other it is difficult to decide between their merits. But faith in the ideal of an ultimate uniform explanation of nature then leads the physicist to assert that only one of the rivals can be tenable, and his usual procedure in these embarrassing circumstances is to wait for the emergence of new data which will encumber one theory with additional and unrelated constructs while merely extending the other. The former is then said to violate the re- quirement of simplicity and is abandoned on these grounds. For a long time the caloric theory and the energetic theory of heat were competitors. The former assigns to the complex of data "hotness," the construct "caloric," which is to be under- stood as a large collection of extremely small and almost massless particles, much in the way in which the atomic or fluid construct corresponds to matter.8 Thus the construct caloric is not en- tirely unrelated to others already in use; the quantities distin- guishing it (compressibility, extension in space, etc.) i.e. the further constructs involved are familiar from the accepted expla- nation of matter; their number is small. Much the same can be said about the energetic theory, which assigns to hotness the familiar construct: kinetic energy of moving particles. The ad- vantage of the latter was not at once apparent; we recall that Lord Kelvin was able to derive his absolute scale of temperatures on the basis of the caloric theory, Carnot explained his well known cycle and proved the theorem regarding the maximum efficiency of a reversible heat engine, and Clapeyron calculated without 8 It is unfortunate, perhaps, that one must use such stilted language to convey ideas clearly. In simply saying: Caloric is a form of matter, we are guilty of logical confusion. The construct caloric is not the datum matter, nor a form of it. The trouble is that the word matter has a double meaning: i) that of a datum, 2) that of a construct (collection of massive particles, fluid). Common speech, being developed on practical concerns, rarely realizes epistemological distinctions.</page><page sequence="23">Methodology of Physics 70 much error the value of the important constant (subject to a different interpretation) now known as the mechanical equivalent of heat, by using the caloric construct. It was not until the experiments of Rumford and Davy were performed that a clear decision became possible. These experi- ments demonstrated that a body can become hot without having any matter added to it. In terms of the caloric theory this means that caloric can be created. Thus the construct assumes a prop- erty which sets it aside from the constructs by means of which we are accustomed to account for matter. If it is to be retained it must be counted as a new construct added to the others. In this respect the energetic theory is better; kinetic energy can be communicated without transferring matter, hence no further con- structs need be introduced. Thus the caloric theory is exposed as inadequate because it violates the requirement of simplicity. If we were at liberty to ignore this requirement the physicist's ideal of a uniform system of explanation could easily be attained. For we could populate the world of constructs with mechanical models capable of simulating all possible data. Poincare, I believe, was the first to call attention to this fact, which can be demonstrated without trouble. But the number of independent constructs in this scheme would be so great that physicists would at once reject it. There are other difficulties in the use of me- chanical models of which we shall speak later. C. In part A of this section, when discussing the permanent character of the correspondence between constructs of explana- tion and data, we spoke of changes of state implied in the proper- ties of constructs. State, we recall, is a purely constructional term and is not in general identical with a perceptible situation, although, of course, it must be capable of correspondence with data.9 (Cf. remarks near end of ? III.) In what manner are these changes of state implied? The answer is simple: They are enforced by our use of the causal mode of description. I do not wish to enter again upon a detailed discussion of the broadest 9 Whether we regard states as a third class of constructs (beside systems and quanti- ties) or whether we look upon them as associations of systems and quantities is a matter of practical indifference.</page><page sequence="24">H. Margenau 71 sense in which the causality principle is applied in physics.?1 The usual, though not the only possible way of satisfying the causal requirement in connection with the changes of construc- tional states is to subject the quantities whose changes are re- sponsible for the modification of the states, to differential equa- tions. The order of these equations in the independent variables, co6rdinates and time, depends in general upon the number"1 and the kind of quantities (i.e. constructs!) chosen to define a state. In mechanics, where the systems are particles and the associated quantities are positions and momenta, the equations are of the second order in the time. The same is true in a great number of other fields where the symbolism of explanation has been fash- ioned after the pattern of mechanics. In general the physicist can predict as a result of the causal nexus between successive states. What he predicts is another state of his constructs, but from this new state he may proceed immediately to data using the specified rules of correspondence. In practice the process of prediction usually takes a standard course: One seeks a general solution of the differential equations, adjusts this solution to the known state at any given time ti and finally introduces t2, the time at which the state is to be de- termined, in place of the variable t appearing in the solution. This state is then related to a complex of data in the same manner as was the old. Possibility of prediction of states is a correlate of causal description, but it is not synonymous with causality, as was pointed out previously.12 It is clear, of course, that causal description also permits a retrograde determination of states in time, so that what has here been said about prediction is also true about reconstruction. The reader should not overlook, however, that physical causal- ity, which we have here isolated as one of the requirements for the constructs of explanation, represents an attribute of nature only in an indirect sense; for it signifies no more than that nature 10 Cf.

Io.</page><page sequence="25">72 Methodology of Physics is so constituted as to be simply explicable, within the framework of the present methodology, by a causal symbolism. To say that nature is causal is superficial and ambiguous. The requirements of permanent and extensive correspondence, simplicity, and causality exhaust the conditions to be imposed upon admissible constructs of explanation. The first and last of these partly overlap. (To be continued)</page></plain_text>
