<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE BEGINNINGS OF FICTION 307 George Slusser The Beginnings of Fiction In October 1953, the first issue of the French magazine Fiction appeared. It is still being published. Announced on the cover of issue no. 1 as the "Edition francaise de The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction" (hereafter F&amp;SF), it rapidly became much more than a simple vehicle for translations. The number of stories by French-language writers, old and new, rapidly grew. As did the space given to original commentary, essays, and reviews by the French editorial staff. In the period from roughly 1953 to 1960-the period that concerns us here-Fiction became, in relation to SF, a genuine literary magazine that had no equivalent in the Anglo-Saxon world. Though roughly comparable in influence to Campbell's Astounding, Fiction remains, with its collective editorial effort and shared literary aspirations, an ab- solutely unique enterprise in SF magazine publishing. What, then, did it accomplish for the literary forms it promoted? This question bears on what was, at that time, the status of fantasy. And even more importantly, of SF. SF in France was a form both old and new in 1953. This is the land of Jules Verne. And though Verne, through his seminal influence on the pulps via translations in Gernsback's Amazing Stories, might claim a paternal influence on American SF, his own culture had relegated his books to the category of adventure stories for boys. In post- war 1953, however, a host of these American Vernians were flooding back to France-witness the creation of a French version of F&amp;SF. As they did so, they were making a serious bid among French readers for adult-writer status. In this context the question of status became, for the editors and critics of Fiction, one of literary tradition. This magazine in these early years offers the first comparative discussion of SF, and with it, the first reflections on the possibility of national forms of SF. The existence of Fiction raises a broad question: In what ways can a specific national culture shape the nature of an apparently international literary form like SF? In post-war France, however, the immediate question was shorter term: What potential cultural role might SF have? Did SF have sufficient cultural momentum to drive a literary movement? And a successful one? In the late 1940s, existentialism dominated. But in the 1950s, the prize was up for grabs. There emerged the nouveau roman and the nouvelle vague. Here is Thomas Elsaesser on the rise to prominence of the latter: "Legend</page><page sequence="2">308 SCIENCE-FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 16 (1989) has it that the feat was accomplished almost single-handed by motivated and volatile intellectuals from Paris sticking their heads together and pulling off a brilliant public relations stunt that came to be known as Cahiers du cinema" (p. 199). In such a climate, Fiction could not remain the "French version" of an American magazine. Its editors, too, were a small, close-knit group of ambitious and literate intellectuals. And, as we shall see, their goal was also to create a literary magazine. The problems these SF spokesmen faced were more acute than in the case of film, however. First of all, their form is tied all too closely, in the commercial sense, to a body of "foreign" material: the F&amp;SF texts they are contracted to translate and publish. The need, then, to establish a cultural distance from their subject is not just an intellectual problem but a practical matter of literary life and death. Second, and more importantly, they bear the Vernian legacy of their form. This places the editors of Fiction in a quandary: commercial purveyors of a Vernian literature, they feel it intel- lectually necessary at the same time to assimilate their commodity to a cultural "mainstream" they perceive as deeply anti-Vernian. I will argue that this meeting of American SF and French intellectual in the early pages of Fiction becomes, as the debate is gradually internalized in the French tradition, a struggle for the Cartesian mind itself. For these critics, it appears, the influx of American SF reintroduces to the French reader the native current of materialist positivism associated in the popular mind with Jules Verne and with "anticipation." The comparative issue hides a deeper national agenda: to redefme the literary form which-to an Asimov, say-measures the impact of scientific advance on human beings, and in redefining it, turns it into an ontological preserve that offers shelter to the qualitative privilege the Cartesian mind claims against the quantitative pressures of technological change. In a sense, the critics of Cahiers du cinema react to an American influx in an analogous manner. Practitioners of the auteur theory take directors like Howard Hawks who clearly work within the material process of Holly- wood filmmaking and transform them into artists who, through intellectual subterfuge, put their personal marks on what are fundamentally mass pro- ductions. In doing so, Hawks and others are seen to reassert the privilege of mind in relation to what is otherwise a mindless material process. In like manner, the Fiction critics want to see selected American SF writers per- forming a like subterfuge, working counter to the literature's dominant materialist current. If anything, SF presents the "dedfi americain" on a more fundamental level than film. For here, overtly heralded, is the triumph of technological transformation, not only unhindered by cultural tradition but oblivious to it. To reveal that American writers working in the SF form are secretly working against it is a greater cultural "coup" than to present Howard Hawks as master of his medium. The concerted efforts of these early Fiction critics-and I shall, after</page><page sequence="3">THE BEGINNINGS OF FICTION 309 dealing with the editorial apparatus, focus on two: Jean-Jacques Bridenne and Gerard Klein-were highly successful in directing the course of a native SF that, in the 1960s and '70s, grew up among, and in contact with, the magazine's host of American translations. But there is an irony to ponder here. For is not Fiction, by being so successful in plotting the course of SF in France, to some degree also responsible for its failure as a national literary movement? The nouvelle vague film became the French film. But French SF did not become the new French literature, and this, apparently, because it could not command its own readership-a readership that split radically along the same Cartesian lines that Bridenne and Klein drew to define their native form in the first place. Fiction existed both as a theoretical ideal and a market reality, and continued to publish French models and American texts side by side. In this schizophrenic atmosphere, readers of the latter-and they seemed the majority-were totally ignored and excluded from the critical debate. It is not surprising, then, that these readers, tacitly dismissed as materialists, reacted to the new French SF growing out of that debate as something too "literary." But in the eyes of the literary mainstream, French SF, precisely because this split readership maintained ties with American pulp fiction, appeared still tainted with materialism. A wholly French SF remained a form between two worlds-one dead, the other powerless to be born. Reflection on this attempted shaping of a uniquely French SF, in the early pages of Fiction, offers the Anglo-Saxon critic insight in two important areas. First, it gives a sense of how radical the challenge of SF, apprehended on a gut level as a literature of material change, really is to the traditional structures of Western culture, in this case to Cartesian "humanism." Second, and in turn, it conveys the radically reactionary nature of the Cartesian method itself. For this same Cartesian process that A.N. Whitehead and others see as launching modern science and technology on its assault against a purposely simplified nature reveals itself instead, as Klein uses it to define his form of SF, as a mechanism of retreat, as the means of preserving the privilege of mind by disengaging it from a material world which, in Pascalian fashion, is seen to engulf it. 1. Let us consider the title of this magazine.Why was it called Fiction, plain and simple, rather than the French equivalent of The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction? Mention of the English-language, American, and SF connection is relegated to the bottom of the page. Like the US Sur- geon-General's warning, we are to read but not heed it. Proudly at the top, however, under the titular banner Fiction, the French editors display their generic affiliations: this is not a magazine but a "revue litteraire," and it is not for special readers but for all those interested in narrative fiction ("la fiction romanesque") in the area of the UNCANNY ("l'etrange"). Subsets of this, mentioned in small print, are "le fantastique," "le surnaturel," "l'anticipation</page><page sequence="4">310 SCIENCE-FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 16 (1989) scientifique." Instead of "fantasy" and "SF," we have the more traditional and conventional designations. And these are subordinated to a category that, by means of the implied association through the title of this magazine with "novelistic fiction" in general, is in a sense revalorized. In this context, "l'etrange" loses all the limiting connotations of the American term "weird" and recaptures the primal sense of "novel," a word and a form that (it is implied) under the realist dispensation lost its basic claim to newness and strangeness. Clearly these editors have aspirations far beyond the subgeneric ghetto of their "parent" magazine. They perceive some basic fictional need that the F&amp;SF stories must, even where lacking, be made to serve. This generic fine-tuning continues in publisher Maurice Renault's inaugural remarks, "Aux futurs amis de Fiction." It is clear to the most casual reader of F&amp;SF that despite initial attempts to make fantasy the broader category it is SF that soon comes to dominate. Renault, who in 1953 had several years of the American magazine to survey, is determined to resist this generic shift. Readers will find SF texts in issues to come, he tells us. But the magazine "intends" to offer a far larger spectrum. SF, he explains, is in fact an upstart American term. The historical term is "antici- pation scientifique," and this turns us away from the present back towards the 19th century and a whole tradition of "classic" works: "Thus we shall call upon the best writers of fantastic and supernatural tales [nouvelles] and of contes philosophiques, genres brilliantly represented in France by such masters as Nodier, Balzac, Theophile Gautier, Merimee, Gerard de Ner- val... Guy de Maupassant" (1:2).1 Renault names traditional authors, but significantly will not name or label the genre he hopes to promote. This magazine is not to exist in contrast to the other magazine he publishes, Mystere-Magazine. It is to be its generic complement: "In Fiction, we are going to deal with a genre that, if it is somewhat related to the mystery, is nevertheless different from the detective mystery by being closer to the strange and uncanny" (1:2). What Fiction is to give us is mystery plus an element that is to loom increasingly large in subsequent attempts to redefine the invading form of SF in terms of this native French tradition: the element of dream ("a little bit of dream along with a pleasant distraction"). The national and generic notes sounded in this first issue are neither casual nor random. On the contrary, they play against each other to suggest a clear direction for Fiction-a program that seeks to define its "newness" in terms immediately understandable to the traditional French reader. Maurice Renault tells us straight away that each issue of the magazine will feature French as well as English-language authors. Indeed, his inaugural issue contains not one but two "illustrious" French examples: Maupassant's "La Main," never published in F&amp;SF, and Maurois' "La Guerre contre la lune," published in the Summer 1950 F&amp;SF as "The War against the Moon." The French editors, however, give the story back its titre de noblesse by restoring the phrase "de l'Academie francaise" after its author's name. Not</page><page sequence="5">THE BEGINNINGS OF FICTION 311 only are we not dealing exclusively with an American upstart genre; we are tapping the French mainstream, storytelling in the classic tradition, for the benefit of readers (as Renault explains) "who enjoy, in the millenial-old tra- dition, having someone tell them stories, but good stories" (1:3; emphasis in original). Renault and his staff, writing in 1953, are clearly aware of the direction French classicism is being taken by the literary establishment. The term "raconter des histoires," in popular parlance, connotes lying (as does fiction in its root sense of fingere). But the call here is, emphatically, for good stories, in the primary (and again popular) sense of entertaining. The target (in the name of a more universal constant in storytelling) is, consciously or unconsciously, the mathematical and "structuralist" classicism first launched by Paul Valery, who reduced the role of story in the narrative act to a banal- ity: the Marquise went out at five o'clock, and who cares whether she did or didn't. Renault, with his call for good stories based on a confluence of the fictional forces of mystere and etrange, instead is inviting a narrative that is "classical" only in the curious sense Camus describes in "L'intelligence et l'echafaud." Camus relates that Louis XVI, on the way to his beheading, asked his guard to take a message to his queen. A structuralist narrative would allow such turnings back. But here the logic of story prevails, and the guard replies: "I am not here to run errands for you. I am here to take you to the gallows" (p. 1895). The editors promise us, in stories Fiction will subsequently publish, the dream of rigor. In the grip of that dream, however, the inexorable logic of mystery finds a new vector-that which leads to the scaffold, the inevitability of horror. Yet under the magazine's even newer dispensation of "l'etrange," mystery in turn must yield to the rigor of the dream. The rigorous dream here is that of the Cartesian cogito itself, by which mind hopes to defeat the material time line by moving laterally into a parallel world of self-creating reason. But what relation exists between these (apparently) highly traditional French preoccupations and the texts this magazine must, by the logic of the marketplace, purvey? When the first issue of Fiction appeared, 69 issues of its "sister," Mystere Magazine had already seen the light. The ads in Fiction no. 1 for Mystere Magazine tell us that in 1953 the latter was publishing a straight slate of Anglo-American formula pieces. Indeed, the first issue of Fiction itself offers three such mystery stories: an Anthony Boucher, an Agatha Christie, and a Leslie Charteris Saint story. All of these are mechan- ical "whodunits" that seem in no way to lead to that junction of mystery with strangeness which, as it mutates toward horror, is more the purview of an author curiously absent from this first issue-Poe. In light of the editors' program, the SF this first issue offers appears equally uninspired. F&amp;SF had a three-year head start, and so offered a sizeable pool of texts for an inaugural number of such pretensions. And yet the SF, like the mystery fiction, is standard stuff. At its inception Fiction</page><page sequence="6">312 SCIENCE-FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 16 (1989) does not seem much different, in terms of the SF it contains, from its direct rival, Galaxie, also launched in 1953. This, according to Henri Delmas and Alain Julian's "catalogue bibliographique" Le rayon SF, is a bumper year in French SF: "1953, a privileged milestone for the lover of SF: a month after Fiction's no. 1 there appears no. 1 of Galaxie, the French edition of the American Galaxy Science Fiction" (p. 127). Fiction and Galaxie thus start on an equal footing, at least to all practical intents: both are to be translation vehicles for their respective sources, sources offering analogous, if not quite similar, types of SF story. As far as the latter is concerned, the only difference then between the two magazines at their outset is one of editorial will. Despite a name change after issue no. 25 from Galaxie science-fiction to Galaxie anticipation, that magazine continues to do no more than publish American works. Delmas and Julian see two factors operative here: "We will not speak of the directorial staff, totally unfamiliar with the world of SF; we will simply express astonishment at the absence of an editor-in-chief' (p. 127). The case with Fiction is just the opposite. As for editors-in-chief, both Jacques Bergier, who functioned unofficially in this capacity until November 1957, and Alain Doremieux, who was the "soul" of the magazine from 1958 to 1974, were knowledgeable and thoroughly professional. Furthermore, both were men of literary sensi- bility and aspirations, who gathered around them a talented and dedicated group of translators, essayists, and reviewers. Most of the names associated with the inception of Fiction are mentioned by Pierre Versins in his list of early "fans."2 But the Anglo-American sense of this term hardly applies here. These men were not worshippers or emulators of their American "masters." They were avowed rivals. Klein and Doremieux, along with Philippe Curval and Jacques Stemnberg (both of whom designed the early covers), were aspiring writers themselves, men seeking to lay the foun- dations, in thoroughly French fashion, of a genuine literary movement. The SF they published was, to them, raw material, waiting to be transmuted in the crucible of "fiction." Their apparent goal was concerted from the start: to develop around the influx of F&amp;SF texts a cultural context that would provide them with a strategy of selection. That strategy was to create a genuinely French SF. 2. This process of transmutation, practically speaking, was slow and difficult. To begin to understand it, we must first have some sense of the nature of the material Klein and his cohorts had to work with: the F&amp;SF texts. Of all the American pulps publishing SF, F&amp;SF is the one with most pretensions to being "literary." To compare it with Fiction, though, is to measure the distance between the American idea of such a magazine in the context of SF and the French sense of a like venture. The first (Fall 1949) issue of the American magazine was simply called The Magazine of Fantasy. It, too, was prefaced with an introductory</page><page sequence="7">THE BEGINNINGS OF FICTION 313 statement by the publisher (Lawrence E. Spivak) that at first glance could seem to be a manifesto. But the difference between this and Renault's state- ment is clear. Spivak is pushing fantasy as overarching genre here (indeed his only mention of SF is to say that his editors Boucher and McComas have co-edited the "definitive anthology of science fiction"); but his sense of why he is doing so (other than mere convenience) is imprecise and unsophisti- cated. Fantasy is simply "one of the oldest delights of mankind," harking back to cavemen sitting around a fire telling stories "of things that went bump in the night." Because he has no apparent sense of fantasy as a fictional genre-it is casually synonymous with "supernatural" and "horror"- Spivak, unlike Renault, is inept at making a case for its centrality in an existing, and national, fictional canon. Fantasy is timeless and everywhere, "baked in Assyrian bricks." In this century, he tells us, it has fallen into neglect simply because "twentieth century man is too practical." There is none of Renault's sense that this same "practicality," and more especially the positivist "realism" accompanying it, is a menace. And a menace to some- thing very deep: to fiction itself, to that human activity whose essence lies in the rational cultivation of the novel and "strange." Spivak defines fantasy fiction as "the wondrous recounting of the impossible-made-convincing." Renault, on the other hand, proposes to devote his entire magazine to de- fining a fictional form that reveals to us ways in which the impossible is made convincing. Renault does not have the luxury, as Spivak does, of passing over SF in silence. He has three years of the American magazine before his eyes, and can see for himself just how pervasive this initially excluded form has be- come. Indeed, the Frenchman can sense the degree to which SF, by virtue of its ability to infiltrate and perhaps finally dominate the purely fantastic texts, is itself a vector for the "practical" and positivistic-a sort of hyper-realism that in its seduction is eminently dangerous to the practice of fiction itself. The SF "infiltration" of The Magazine of Fantasy is fascinating in its own right. A latecomer to the pulps in this generic area, it was relatively easy for this magazine to make a claim for "literary" status by placing itself under the banner of a form whose practitioners include such mainstream luminaries as Shakespeare and Dickens. For a '50s' genre magazine, the trick was to take one's distance from the reigning model, which was that of John W. Campbell. We notice immediately, in the new Magazine of Fantasy's format, an absence of Campbellian editorials and heated letter exchanges. Contrary to Campbell's practice, the editorial hand seems unobtrusive, al- most non-existent, as if policy this time were in the hands of tradition, not in those of a dictatorial individual. Editorial essays or reviews are few and far between, and when they occur the target tends to be something Campbell- associated, as in the attack on Dianetics in issue no. 5. Finally, each story is presented in a manner quite different from the Gernsback-Campbell manner. For where the latter editors introduce a story as an experiment or even</page><page sequence="8">314 SCIENCE-FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 16 (1989) gimmick-a narrative totally contained in its own solution or resolution-the new magazine seeks to position each story in an established tradition. And that tradition is willfully not SF. Take the example of a story in the first num- ber by new writer Winona McClintic, "In the Days of Our Father." Even though this is clearly dystopian fiction, and explicitly compared with Huxley and Leiber's Gather Darkness, it is denied to SF-called "anti-SF" in fact. The "purity" of The Magazine of Fantasy in fact lasted exactly one issue. Prefacing a story by Robert M. Coates entitled "The Return of the Gods," the editors tell us: "American fantastic fiction has gone in two directions from its very beginnings-that of Poe, who set his horrors in suitably desolate Gothic settings, and that of Fitz-James O'Brien, who put his impossible intrusions plump in the middle of the most detailed everyday naturalism" (p. 17). The relation of Poe to O'Brien, as outlined here, is pre- cisely (if the word "impossible" is shaded a bit towards the improbable) the one which will emerge between horror and a certain kind of SF that gradually develops in this very magazine. The Coates story mentioned is on the O'Brien axis. So are several others in the inaugural issue: Cleve Cartmill's "Bells on His Toes," called here a "broad farce-fantasy," and Theodore Sturgeon's very "soft" tale, "The Hurkle is a Happy Beast." This strain immediately resurfaces in issue no. 2, in a publication rebaptized "The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction." There we have one of Bradbury's Mars stories, "The Exiles," a Reginald Bretnor tale of aliens (however love- able), and Damon Knight's "Not with a Bang." In subsequent issues, side by side with mystery writers and more traditional fantasists like E.B. White, James Thurber, Graham Greene, P.G. Wodehouse, and Raymond Chandler, we see increasing numbers of SF writers emerge: A.E. van Vogt, A.C. Clarke, Richard Matheson, Poul Anderson, Isaac Asimov, Clifford Simak, Walter Miller, Robert Sheckley, Gordon Dickson, P.K. Dick. The Bradbury we encounter is not his dark fantasy but his more S-F writing-e.g., tales like "The Pedestrian." And as of issue no. 5, we see Chesley Bonestell covers-meticulously rendered moonscapes based on photo-astronomy. The term "impossible" in the formula has now mutated to "probable." What we witness in this magazine is the gradual and organic emergence, despite a stated generic orientation, of SF as a clear organizing vector. But what emerges is a particular, and particularly American, mode of SF-the F&amp;SF mode. Conventional SF themes-the "detailed, everyday" hyper- naturalism of Campbellian SF-are treated here in a broad palate of moods: whimsically, humorously, lyrically, ironically, poignantly. The distance is one measured between Larry Niven's exobiology and Sturgeon's Hurkles or Bretnor's Gnurrs; or between Stanley Weinbaum's or Clarke's Mars and that of Bradbury's "Exiles." We feel the modulation in Bradbury's strangely low-key dystopia "The Pedestrian" or in a last-man story like Knight's "No Way Out." Campbellian or "hard" SF writers, when they appear in these pages, modulate their tone: Asimov develops his humorous side; Clarke</page><page sequence="9">THE BEGINNINGS OF FICTION 315 gives us an understated classic like "Superiority." Other forms and styles of SF arise: lyrical SF pieces like Fredric Brown's "Imagine" and Bradbury's "Icarus Montgolfier Wright"; wacky experiments like Dick's The Preserving Machine or Alfred Bester's "Fondly Fahrenheit." The magazine gives us an array of meditative and reflective pieces: early versions of Walter Miller's A Canticle for Leibowitz and Ward Moore's Bring the Jubilee, William Tenn's The Tenants, and Simak's Shadow Show. It gave us some of the richest and most balanced Heinlein: serialized versions of The Star Beast, Have Space Suit, Will Travel, and The Door into Summer. This is the stream of texts with which the Fiction editors had to deal- and on which they generally had to base their sense of what this organically intrusive genre, SF, was. They were texts that, as we have seen, already deviate significantly from the more positivist extrapolations of hard SF. F&amp;SF resisted the Campbell tradition. What the French magazine had to resist were mutated forms. The more literary or "fictional" nature of these forms, however, apparently did not spare them from becoming the subject of concerted critical scrutiny. Unlike the American editors, whose fuzzy gen- eric sense allowed fantasy to be co-opted by the very form it would subsume, the Fiction editors set up a strong barrier from the start. A barrier to an SF that remained more an idea or ideal than a series of modulating forms. 3. Fiction's covers reveal an immediate-and highly sophisticated-critical stance toward SF in its iconic state, a state in which themes and forms are essentially stripped of all literary or tonal modulation. The cover of the first issue reproduces a Bonestell painting-a realistically depicted planetscape with rocket and moonbase in the foreground. But instead of allowing this landscape to spread across and dominate its entire visual field (as on a typ- ical F&amp;SF cover), it is hemmed in, trapped as it were, by the logo "Fiction," and by a text and a list of stories whose function is to restrict the powerful images of SF in a field of literary genres. On the cover of issue no. 2, the SF icon is this time restricted within the visual frame itself, through the device of montage. In one corner of the composition (itself framed by the same genre-determining text), we see a scientist and his looming robot. Un- like Bonestell's rocket, this icon is not "realistically" homogeneous, but com- posite, as if Fritz Lang's Rotwang were to meet Robby the Robot. And this icon in turn is superimposed over the multi-tiered interior of what appears, at first glance, to be a Parisian grand magasin. A closer look at this backdrop, however, reveals a Piranesi-like labyrinth of staircases and levels. This is a landscape where SF's "sense of wonder" has been ennested, as merely another visual cliche, in the commonplace, only to have that commonplace in turn subjected to same fragmenting vision, revealing itself to be (to use the words on the cover) another "domain" of the fantastic. What emerges on these early Fiction covers is the photo-montage, iconic compositions put together for their own sake, as an independent</page><page sequence="10">316 SCIENCE-FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 16 (1989) "statement," rather than as simple decoration, or as illustration for a lead story. And those doing these compositions, furthermore, are not just graphic artists commissioned for the occasion, but figures like Steinberg and Curval, who will go on to become writers themselves. These photo-montages, produced by people intimately connected with the shaping of Fiction, reveal an attitude toward the images of SF that is sophisticated, critical, and consistent. Again and again, in their work, the icons of SF are associated with things profoundly anti-traditional, with forces seen to disrupt both culture and the civilizing effect that culture has had on nature. The cover to issue no. 3, for instance, is a Steinberg montage in which the theme of space travel-a planet, a flying spaceship, and nebulae-has been pushed to the background. What is foregrounded is a collage of modern industrial artifacts-smokestacks, huge metallurgic furnaces, atomic reactors. And leading to this landscape of factories is a parking lot with arrows directing traffic, as in Jacques Tati's contemporary film Mon Oncle (1958), also unabashedly critical of the modem "Americanized" world. The juxtaposition suggests that the background planet is Earth, and that the technology that frees our rockets in space has snared humankind here on Earth and is leading it to destruction. The montage on the cover of issue no 4 has a similar "message," only more blatantly expressed. Here we have a spinning space station, in accurate doughnut design. But the composition is entitled "Adieu, calf, cow.. .covey." To live in space is simply to bid farewell to the organic processes of our Earth. The_space station is not a place of transition, but of irreversible exile. The covers to issues no. 5 and 6 reverse polarity. The direction is not outer space and the future, but the subterranean realm and the "lost race" past. The Steinberg montage for no. 5 shows us a world of craters and drag- ons and buried seascapes-a world where the image of humankind and do- mesticated organic life is as absent and irrelevant as in outer space. His composition for issue no. 6 is more interesting yet. In a landscape of giant toadstools, rotting fungi, and stalactites, two tiny human explorers, as if at the center of Verne's Earth, point up at the huge figure of a bat-winged wo- man. The woman's pose is both grotesque and statuesque, and this new Lao- coon suggests that human art remains the goal of our scientific explorations, the only thing that can fill the void of our dreams of new discovery. We witness in these covers curious extensions of the Cartesian dichot- omy that separates a narrow realm under rational control from a more extended realm of material creation-a realm which now includes such expansionist artifacts of our technology as rocketships and skyscrapers. The cover of issue no. 7 depicts two towering robots playing jazz instruments before the surprised figure of a lady in proper contemporary middle-class dress. Our technology has created these Cartesian monsters, and they return with their new music from a brave new future to block the organic paths whereby "normal" humanity evolves.

The foreground of its composite cityscape offers past "old world" edifices of power-the Coliseum, the Bourse in Paris. Rising behind them is a menacing jumble of New York skyscrapers. And emerging from these is the face of black cat, staring over the edge of an open book bearing the page heading "French civilization." Here, at one and the same time, we recriminate and reaffirm the Cartesian duality. For it is the same Cartesian cogito-separating, as two distinct orders of being, mind and the extended world-that made humankind's house this alienating landscape of skyscrapers and, following its own logic, had to declare that even animals were automata. Organic, even domestic, creatures have now become aliens, and like this black cat are felt to menace a culture, or "civi- lization," whose final refuge it seems is the printed page. The dream of a world made to the measure of reason has turned against itself, and the book has become the only hiding place mind has left. The photo-montages of these early issues, focussed as they are not on the icons of the fantastic or uncanny but on those of SF, reveal two things: a deep (if subconscious) concern with the forms and themes of the new Ameri- can import; and an equally strong desire to subvert and perhaps convert the impetus of phenomena like rocketships, robots, industrial transformation. The techno-positivism of American cover art, the source of these icons, obviously has profound resonances for the French artists. And these go deeply into the national tradition, back to Descartes, back to Pascal's dilem- ma of reason. Indeed, how can technology be other than a paradox if it is conceived in the light of the cogito. For under the latter's dispensation, mind exists, and hence operates, less by engaging the material order than by disengaging from it. The sense of a genre growing out of this subliminal "dialogue" with American SF would, then, turn naturally towards the French past and tra- dition. And this is exactly what we see with the cover of issue no. 10. This is not a high-tech montage, but a period piece: a Robida drawing depicting an episode from the undersea voyage of Saturnin Farandoul. The subject is potentially Vernian: scientific exploration of new frontiers. But it is treated satirically, as a comical swirl of intertwining sharks and pinwheeling men in absurd-looking diving suits. If Verne is serious in chronicling the ex- ploits of technology, Robida is critical of their pretensions. He is an artist thoroughly in the "critical" tradition of SF that Fiction seems willing now to bring to light. 4. The Robida drawing does not even pretend (as did the earlier montages) to illustrate a story. What it prefaces is instead a critical article rendering homage to Robida as precursor to a particularly French form of SF: scien- tific anticipation. The article is signed by Jean-Jacques Bridenne, who from issue nos. 3 to 68 published a series of essays on early writers responsible, in his eyes and clearly in those of his editors, for establishing an alternate</page><page sequence="14">320 SCIENCE-FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 16 (1989) tradition to the modem, mainly American, works being published in the pages of the same magazine. Collectively, his essays offer a coherent presen- tation of what Paul Alkon calls the "origins of futuristic fiction." There is a concerted effort to identify French precursors for many of the major themes or sub-genres of modem post-war American SF. Bridenne does so, however, with the clear intention of showing (as the Fiction artists did with their imported cover icons) how the French versions of these themes and forms differ from (subsequent) American use. Bridenne's first substantial essay (his real first essay concerned Cagli- ostro and Saint-Germain, 3:110-15), as we might expect, was a three-part discussion of the figure that must loom large in any attempt to trace the development of SF in France: Jules Verne. The essay is interrogative in nature. Its general title is a question: "Jules Verne, Father of Science Fiction?" And the answer lies in a series of important qualifications. By bringing forward, in sections two and three of the essay, two other can- didates for this paternity-Wells and Poe-Bridenne narrows Verne's field of influence considerably. Verne's strength as scientific extrapolater is noted, but only to qualify it by comparison with the other two writers. But Verne remains the French precursor, and we feel that Bridenne wishes he were other than he was. Such a nationalist desire allows him to construct a portrait of Verne as a writer not only constrained by his medium, but divided against himself on the deepest level of cultural awareness. The first part of this essay (in Fiction no. 6), subtitled "The Scientific Imagination in Jules Verne," presents the division Bridenne senses in Verne's acts of scientific "anticipation." The question here is to what degree this anticipation constitutes what we call SF today. For Verne, as Bridenne rightly sees him, this anticipation consisted in strict adherence to scientific facts as he knew them. Yet Bridenne, instead of accepting this as a method in itself, interprets it rather as a limit that the writer imposed on an imanation capable of much wilder flights: "For.. .in spite of his turbulent imagin, one can affirm that he never extrapolated [anticipe] except from inventions that already existed, or from research well in progress, or from theories ex- pounded by well-known specialists" (6:113). What Bridenne looks for in- stead in Verne are the aporia, the places where this repressed imagination bursts out and Verne writes like a "visionary obsessed with cosmic poetry." We know just how central it was to Verne's creative method to get his facts right, for a number of his novels were substantially revised throughout suc- cessive editions in order to take into consideration new discoveries in science or technology in a given area. What Bridenne values, however, are the moments when Verne seems farthest from this pedestrian exercise, when he is able to "prove that even with known positive science-and with talent- it is possible (one after the other) to evoke anxiety and amusement, to es- trange the reader, to make the real, and even the banal, surreal [surre'aliser le re'el et me^me le terre-a-terre]."</page><page sequence="15">THE BEGINNINGS OF FICTION 321 The second section of the essay deals with the Verne-Wells comparison, but as it turns out is on Wells more than Verne. Perhaps Bridenne's major argument-indeed his excuse for Verne-is that the author's obsession with scientific fact, with the close extrapolation that submits to the reign of material "progress" and thus runs the risk of immediate obsolescence, is due to his submission to market demands. According to Bridenne, Verne gave in to producing didactic fiction for juveniles, and this led to the atrophy of his true scientific imagination-that ability to "surrealiser le reel" that he describes here using Rosny the Elder's term "le merveilleux scientifique." Wells, on the other hand, writes SF for adults: "Wells is much more au- dacious than his so-called French model. For he addresses grown-ups. And even highly educated grown-ups, people who would be unlikely to read Jules Verne" (7:109). What Wells offers is social rather than merely "mech- anical" extrapolation: "Wells rapidly went from merely scientific extrapo- lation to an extrapolation, or rather a prophesy, that was sociological in nature instead" (7:110). Wells, then, explores the philosophical, and not simply the technological, consequences of scientific innovation, making him a writer who not only addresses adults, but who addresses the "relativ- istic" world which is, or should be, that of modern SF. Verne, in this com- parison, remains a man of the 19th century-that is, an advocate of what Bridenne specifically calls positivistic scientism: "He [Verne] imagined things fundamentally in terms of material mechanisms, and believed implicit- ly in a continuous material and moral evolution for humanity" (7:111). Wells, by contrast, is the father of SF as we in the 20th century understand it, an SF that offers, instead of Verne's "three-dimensional" universe, a multidimensional one: "We can say, as a general rule, that Wells was more aware of the enigmas of Science.. .but instead of using them like others did to solely horrific or oneiric ends, he rather sought to examine their impact or repercussions on humankind" (7: 1 1 1). The third section of the essay, "Edgar Poe and Jules Verne" (July 1954) deals ostensibly with Verne's debt to the American. But the point, as with the Wells essay, is to make a distinction that limits, if not depreciates, Verne's role in the development of SF, in France and elsewhere. The distinction here is not, as with Wells, between mechanist and utopist, between the purely material as opposed to the social impact of scientific advancement. It is rather (and for Bridenne on a higher level of appre- hension yet) between the positivist and the American apostle of the Mystery of nature. Verne is seen as banishing the supernatural from his world: "If Verne was a painter of geographies and landscapes, and the bard of Invention and the Voyage, he was also one (even though ostensibly a spiritualist) who rigorously banished the supernatural, except in places where he set about dismantling it piece by piece using a mechanist analy- sis" (8:113). As an example of this dismantling, Bridenne looks at Verne's materialist and positivist "rereading" in Le Sphinx des glaces of the white</page><page sequence="16">322 SCIENCE-FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 16 (1989) shape at the end of Arthur Gordon Pym. What Verne runs aground on in Poe is the fantastic itself-the phenomenon that cannot be interpreted in terms of a monistic or positivistic line of reasoning because it is by nature double and fundamentally contradictory, ineffable. Perhaps it is because Verne so attached himself to his juvenile audience, Bridenne reflects, but he cannot reproduce in his stories Poe's paradoxical sense of reality-the Mystery of a writer who "respects Science and makes mockery of it at the same time" (7:114). Verne emerges from these comparisons a very diminished "father" of SF. But by the same token, Bridenne is not entirely willing to grant paternity to a foreigner either. Later, in his essay on Regis Messac, he will emphasize the latter's argument that Poe himself took inspiration from a French source-the French tradition of the fantastic. The argument, then-and the tradition-comes full circle. And it is a circle that, in seeking to define a native SF that continues to enact the paradox operative in a compound like the "merveilleux scientifique," in a sense hopes to exclude Verne. Verne stands like a giant at the beginnings of French SF and must be confronted first. But he is largely, for Bridenne, a specter of positivism, a presence to be vanquished in the name of imagination, mystery, dream. Bridenne's second article of substance (in the September 1954 issue) should perhaps have been the first, for in it we have something not present in the Verne pieces: a positive, straightforward sense of how the tradition of French SF has, and should, develop. Its focus is on Albert Robida (1848- 1926), characterized as "the Jules Veme of the drawing pencil [le crayon]." The essay appears under the rubric: "the byways [a-cotes] of anticipation." This designation is rapidly dropped, but the initial idea behind "byways" is clear enough, and it is an impulsion Bridenne continues throughout his later essays. Robida as caricaturist is in fact presented as a path that is alternate to the form of scientific "anticipation" associated with Verne's "voyages extraordinaires." Robida's brand of anticipation, in works like La Vie e'lec- trique (1893) and La Guerre au vingtieme siecle (1883), is less interested in describing future inventions than in exaggerating their disruptive and destruc- tive qualities. He looks at the products of scientific "progress" through the eye of the satirist and black humorist, and is seen as condemning them: In its final sense Inge'nieur Von Satanas [Engineer Von Satanas, 1919] is a great and eloquent imprecation against so-called progress-the progress that leads to creation of a world that is all the more monstrous for its skill and knowledge; progress that takes modern man back to the condition of the cavemen; that places all its many scientific and industrial successes at the service of the greatest barbarity; that multiplies mournings, ruins and wreckage, infirmities, crime, misery of all sorts. Everything that could be written today on this subject, all our atomic apocalypses, already exist in potentiality in the illustrations Robida did fully 20 years before the atom bomb was conceived. (10:117)</page><page sequence="17">THE BEGINNINGS OF FICTION 323 For Bridenne, SF in France begins not with the predictions of Verne but with the monitions of Robida: a vision that does not open up, but rather blocks off, the future of technological advancement with the finality of apocalypse. Bridenne is discovering for his readers that Robida is the beginning of an entire (and as opposed to Verne, a very modern) tradition-that of today's fictions of nuclear disaster. And his next article (in the October 1954 issue) is on another "precursor," this time not of "anticipation" but of "science- fiction" in its modern sense: Cyrano de Bergerac and his space voyages. Again what Bridenne emphasizes is the byway, not the obvious. And what he calls "the unknown face" of Cyrano is this: Despite being 300 years old, his works retain the highest degree of interest for us today; those especially who love the modern [forms of the] marvelous, even those steeped in [combles de] Poe and Villiers, cannot but passionately enjoy his Autre Monde....One discovers in that work a deep message, casting a bridge between the hermetic tradition and the freethinkers of the 19th century. (11: 112) Cyrano is not the ancestor of Vernian flying machines so much as of Poe and the fictional mode this magazine is in the ongoing process of defining-the union of mystery and the uncanny. Indeed, the same sense of a deeper stream permeates Bridenne's third article, "The Chess Player and His Literature" (in Fiction no. 16 [March 1955]). Here, as with Cyrano and his balloons, Bridenne ostensibly presents the long French tradition of automata-the constructs of Vaucanson and Jacquet-Droz that precede Maelzel's chess player and modern cybernetics. But actually this is a pretext to debate a prob- lem of capital importance to the Cartesian tradition: the possibility-or rather, impossibility-of mechanical or material intelligence. Bridenne's fourth article is a curious, but obviously strategic, avoidance of Jules Verne. In an issue that corresponds to the 50th anniversary of Verne's death (May 1955), he chooses not to write about Verne but about a "disciple" of Verne, in a piece entitled "Andre Laurie and the 'Science- Fiction' of Yesterday." The focus on Laurie allows Bridenne to highlight the faults of the Vernian mode of anticipation, here purposely called SF: The notions about geography and machines that he brings into play are valid; and as we can realize, the extrapolations he derives from them are often accurate and always at least seem plausible; but the style is banal. (18:122) Credit is given to Laurie, who, in the shadow of Verne, "contributed to forming the generations which have realized the conquest of the skies [and] of the marine and subterranean deeps" (18:122). But this sort of literature, though admitted here to be the "major" strain of anticipatory fiction, is finally dismissed as popular entertainment, something that lulls ("bercer") but does not stimulate the reader's deeper sense of reason-a reason that</page><page sequence="18">324 SCIENCE-FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 16 (1989) harbors, in its paradoxical relation to the material world, the capacity for mystery and the uncanny. Bridenne continues his discovery of French precursors for the major sub-genres of world SF in Fiction no. 25 (December 1955) with an article on Emile-Auguest Driant (1855-1916), who wrote under the name of Capitaine Danrit. If Danrit did not predate Chesney, he was still one of the first "future war" writers, with La guerre de demain ("Tomorrow's War") in 1871. This he followed with the infamous L'invasion noire ("The Black Invasion," 1895) and L'invasion jaune ("The Yellow Invasion," 1905), both blatantly racist and chauvinist in nature. More interesting, indeed crucial, to Bridenne's vision of the development of SF in France is the article in Fiction for February 1956 on J.-H. Rosny the Elder, a genuine precursor whose Les Xipehuz (1887) antedates Wells's scientific romances. This novel, which is one of the first "lost race" fictions, seems to form, along with Rosny's La mort de la terre (1908), a genuine first-and-last-men group. Yet though he too, like Wells, seems to dwell on the theme of entropy and the extinction of humankind, Rosny does not succumb to the hopelessness of the final section of The Time Machine. His elegy is instead, paradoxically, a "hymn to Life without number and to its Mystery, a mystery that renews itself as often as mankind solves it [toujours perce par l'homme et toujours renouvele']" (27:109). In the material sense, humanity is a brief instant in the totality of cosmic evolution; but spiritually humanity abides. In a gambit that echoes Pascal's thinking reed, Rosny's humankind, though annihilated in the evolutionary stream, reestablishes parity on a different order, rational and spiritual: But there is also the marvelous surprise that humanity, despite its myriad weaknesses, was able to impose itself upon all the other species that live, have lived, or could have lived; and that all its imperfections and insuf- ficiencies have not made it unworthy to be celebrated [etre chante's] through its arts, its loves, its quests, and its conquests. (27:109) Bridenne writes with passion here, a passion visibly absent in his writing about Jules Veme. But he would do more than give French SF a Wellsian direction by making Rosny, and not Verne, its true spiritual father. He strives to give that SF a clearly Cartesian shape. The master of Cartesian science, such as Rosny, is neither positivist nor pessimist. Instead he cultivates a subtle, and subtly paradoxical, relation between the two attitudes, and be- tween mind and nature as the two protagonists in the debate. For the role of reason is neither to conquer nature nor to abandon humankind to nature. It is to do both simultaneously, to preserve the dignity of thought by thinking the unthinkable. In the articles that follow, this Cartesian vision more and more permeates Bridenne's discussion of French SF precursors. His essay on Camille Flam- marion, for example (in May 1957's Fiction) claims this writer as the first</page><page sequence="19">THE BEGINNINGS OF FICTION 325 to develop the theme of cosmic diaspora, the idea that "when its planet is finally doomed... [humankind] will be able flee in order to fix itself elsewhere and perpetuate so as to swarm across the entire astronomical universe" (42:123). Yet Flammarion, unlike Jules Verne, did not believe space travel materially possible. The diaspora that will preserve humanity from end-of-the-world catastrophe must therefore instead be spiritual, operating through a process very similar to Pascal's separation of orders or Descartes' cogito: "In Flammarion, this [diaspora] takes place, if one dare use the word, by spiritual means, through the transmigration of spiritual 'doubles' to other worlds" (42:123). In science such as astronomer Flammarion practices it, the mind engages the material world in order to be able to break away from that world, becoming its "double." In Bridenne's article on another early "cosmic prophet," Theo Varlet (November 1958), he describes a similar process whereby vastly dispropor- tionate orders of being are mysteriously (even magically) joined-and joined in the very act of asserting their mutual incompatibility. Bridenne calls the nature-worshipper and "naturiste" Varlet (1878-1938) the "twentieth-century Lucretius." Yet as one who "strives with each verse to erect a bridge of sound and image between the depths of the human soul and the depths of outer space" (60:124), Varlet deserves more to be called the 20th-century Pascal. Bridenne's articles on these native precursors to what he has organically come to call SF both offer a tradition that rivals (and in many cases ante- dates) Anglo-American SF and present a very particular sense of the basic problem of all kinds of SF: the relation of the human mind to the material world. As seen through Bridenne's eyes, these writers and poets appear less interested in the expansion or advancement of learning than in protecting and preserving the status of the organ of learning: human reason. The vision is one of reason increasingly submerged (or, to use Pascal's word, "englou- tie") in the soulless and non-sentient quanta of the universe. Such reason can free itself only by turning inward upon itself, hoping to escape back into a realm of essence by declaring its own existence through the act of thinking. Reason passes through the needle's eye of the cogito, or over Varlet's "bridge" that establishes parity between orders different not only in magnitude but in nature. But how is this bridge to be provided in fictional terms? Bridenne suggests an answer in his "Hommage 'a Regis Messac" (November 1957). Messac is a pioneering academic critic of SF. And in Bridenne's eyes, his work gives theoretical support for the generic configuration Fiction hopes to develop. As is customary in the French university, Messac wrote two complementary doctoral dissertations. For Bridenne, Messac in his major dissertation, Le Detective-Novel et l'influence de la pensee scientifique, places the detective genre in significantly larger vistas "which are all the more interesting in view of their marking with rigor the close relationship that exists between two genres: the detective novel and SF" (48:133). As</page><page sequence="20">326 SCIENCE-FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 16 (1989) his use of the term "detective novel" suggests, Messac is referring to that same Anglo-American form Renault publishes in Mystere-Magazine. This "roman policier" is a literature of quantitative induction and analysis. He sees SF sharing this same method and vision. Inscribing the same textual field that Renault must deal with in his two magazines, Messac characterizes the "scientific thought" behind these texts as non-Cartesian ratiocination. These forms of mystery-fiction and science- fiction, though hyphenated compounds, are clearly not dualistic forms. How, then, do we get from them to what Renault calls "fiction," the singular form haunted by its Cartesian double? The answer, for Bridenne, lies in Messac's secondary dissertation, Influences fran aises dans l'a?uvre d'Edgar Poe. It is as if Messac, not content with what mystery and SF in America have become, returns to the American originator of both forms. And finds French roots. Poe is called "the American renovator of fantasy [la litterature fantastique]" (48:133). American mystery and SF have taken, under the later impulsion of scientistic positivism and Vemian adulation of technology, a swerve away from their origins in the fantastic; but their common roots lie in Cyrano, Voltaire, and Nodier, and in a consecrated-and particularly French-genre. And as genre, the fantastic does not operate on a single plane, but acts to connect separate (if parallel) planes. What Messac sees in the fantastic is "the confrontation of scientific evidence with the literature of mystery" (48:133-34). Through this connection, however, "mystery" is boosted to a higher power, forming something like Renault's compound of mystery and strangeness. The fan- tastic functions here in the traditional manner defined by French theorist Tzvetan Todorov: a mediator between two incompatible orders of being that is both available and evanescent in its perpetual present. And this fantastic is eminently Cartesian. Descartes's cogito and Pascal's night of fire are both evanescent states. In both mind has made its definitive escape from the iron laws of quantitative science; and yet at the same time it must continue to act in the realm of quantity, as if this had not happened. Mind, after experiencing the fantastic, goes on dealing scientifically with the extended world in which it exists, but from a new, "estranged" perspective. 5. Bridenne reconstructs the basis for a genuinely French SF, one in which science is considered in accordance with a Cartesian and fantastic, rather than a positivistic, heritage. But outside of the early texts he resurrects, his French tradition remains, in the early 1950s, essentially a theoretical construct. The immediate task of Fiction, faced with an increasing influx of American texts rightly or wrongly associated with a positivistic sense of science, was to develop a new generation of writers in the French manner. In a practical sense, however, these new writers would be more likely to take Bradbury, Clarke, and Heinlein as their masters, not Cyrano and Rosny. What was needed was someone to interpret the American works as</page><page sequence="21">THE BEGINNINGS OF FICTION 327 they appeared. And to reinterpret them, where possible, in the direction of the French tradition. This task fell to Gerard Klein, a young university-trained critic who went on to become one of France's major new SF writers and the highly influential editor of France's most prestigious SF publishing line, Laffont's "Ailleurs et demain" series. Beginning in issue no. 33, Klein published a series of highly sophisticated essays, quite unlike anything done in the Anglo-Saxon sphere at the time, in which he interprets the American masters. A close look at his criteria for analysis and judgment is necessary, for his remarks are instrumental in setting the direction for the texts of French writers that Fiction will subsequently publish. To the degree this magazine is the workshop that formed the writers who became the central figures in the French SF "explosion" of the late 1960s-'70s, Klein played a crucial role in the process. Klein's name first appeared on an article entitled "Ray Bradbury, mage" (August 1956). This was occasioned by Klein's translation, in that same issue, of Bradbury's "The One Who Waits." Though new to the pages of the magazine, Bradbury was already well known in France, if translations mean anything. His Martian Chronicles was Volume 1 (1954) of Denoel's still-running "Presence du futur" series; The Illustrated Man was volume 3 (1954); Fahrenheit 451, volume 8 (1955); and The Golden Apples of the Sun, volume 14 (1956). Bradbury, then, as someone instinctively chosen by the French public as a classic SF writer, must have seemed a good place for Klein to begin his definitional odyssey. Klein, significantly, calls Bradbury a "mage." The French term is more potent, and somehow more savant or "scientific," than the English "magi- cian," diminished as it is by association with a genre the French did not possess at the time Klein was writing: sword and sorcery fantasy. And Klein is using the term here in a very Cartesian sense: not to describe the mind's ability to manipulate the material world, but rather to designate the mind's capacity to declare its essential or visionary quality in contrast to that world. In Bradbury, the "mage" is not incompatible with science or with SF, for he is a crossover figure who permits us to glimpse "parallel or future worlds." But how can this "lateral" movement be compatible with that domain of temporal linearity usually associated with SF-in other words, with SF as literature of a developing or evolving future? Klein defines SF through the eyes of his Bradburyian "mage" in the following manner: SF seeks in large part to discover within us [en nous] a surreal world, one that is more logical, more terrifying, or better than ours, but in any case truer, more complete [acheve'], even if it is still to come, still insufficiently formed in the innards of time. (33:115) As definition, this strikes us as strange, as strange as holding up Bradbury</page><page sequence="22">328 SCIENCE-FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 16 (1989) as paradigm for the genre. Strange, that is, until we realize that Klein is simply following through on the program which Renault, and to a greater degree Bridenne, have sketched. Using Bradbury as his example, Klein is seeking to restore the Cartesian duality to the material process of time celebrated by SF in the Vemian and Campbellian tradition. In his definition, the surreal is to the real as the cogito is to the extended world. And it is not discovered "out there," in vistas of time and space, but "en nous." As with Descartes' method, each rational being, at any time, can take this surreal plunge of self-creation. In order to reconcile the horizontal movement of future change with the surreal metaphor, implying vertical movement between co-existent worlds, we must assume the Cartesian vision. To the American reader, it is doubly curious that Klein makes Bradbury his spokesman for such a Cartesian SF. For if there is duality in Bradbury's vision, it would appear to be that of Original Sin and the Fall. Klein's definition rejects positivistic materialism alone as the basis of SF's world- view. But as heir to a tradition that includes Voltaire as well as Descartes, he cannot acquiesce in what he senses is a morbid negativity in his subject. As he says in his definition, the surreal world of the SF "mage" is "more logical, more terrifying, or better than" our world. His sur-logic is not an either/or but a both/and logic. Thus by virtue of this logic Bradbury is an optimist only to the degree that he is not a utopist: "He has no need for a utopia, for a transformation of mankind, because mankind is not lost or condemned unless he accepts, as individual, to be so" (33:118). Once again, we have the Cartesian individual, who abolishes the need for (and tyranny of) transformational time because he or she is free at any moment to exercise the reason that will declare his or her existence. Klein, in fact, not only calls Bradbury's work "existentialist," but reinterprets the term, in the light of the Cartesian process, as a science not of cumulative knowledge but of immediately present revelation, a fantastic science: "It is the fantastic, immediate, and palpable aspect of science that attracts [Bradbury], and not its methodical and rational side, as accumulated knowledge" (33:116). Klein's next article, "A.E. van Vogt, or Rationalized Insanity [la demence rationalise'e]" (in no. 34:106-11; signed "Mark Starr") offers the obverse of Bradbury's "mage." Van Vogt is another American SF writer who made an early "hit" in France: Gallimard's prestigious "Le rayon fantastique" published a translation of The World of Null-A in 1953 and of Slan in 1954. He is, moreover, a writer who has continued to fascinate French readers: virtually all his works are in print in France today, while none are in print in the US. Klein, however, is critical of van Vogt's madly logical search for material immortality, for eternal "life" in purely quantitative terms rather than in the ontological terms of Descartes' "I think, therefore am." The "demence rationalisee" here is to confuse res extensa with res cogitans, to wish to build a rational world on a purely materialist rather than a Cartesian base. This tendency (even stronger in</page><page sequence="23">THE BEGINNINGS OF FICTION 329 Heinlein and others) is fatal in Klein's eyes because it denies the surreal crossover, or the "eternity" of the cogito. The latter, the creation of the thinking self in an act of thinking that is available to all thinking beings at any time, is Bradbury's "magical" present, not van Vogt's sterile immortality. In his next article, "Theodore Sturgeon, the Splendid Alienee" (April 1957), Klein offers, in the concept of "alienation," a curiously Cartesian sense of scientific activity: "Science arises from man's voluntary alienation vis-a-vis the real" (41:123). Science is not a conquest by rule and line, but rather a "detour by which we rejoin [rejoint] the real" (ibid.). Again, as with Bradbury, through this logic of doubling and indirection, science and magic become opposite and yet lateral processes, opposite ways to a same means: "Magic and science are for Sturgeon identical methods for drawing us out of ourselves" (41:123). Here, in terms of alienation, it is the term "real" that is subject to this doubling logic. In one sense, "real" signifies the world of materiality-the Cartesian sense that on this plane even the human body is simply another machine that can be methodically dismantled by what Descartes called doubt, acts of voluntary alienation. But in another sense, the "reality" we "rejoin" by means of such doubt is the dual one of mind and machine. And this state is inaccessible except through the byway of alienation, the "splendid" alienation of Sturgeon's sense of science. Once again Klein's next article, co-authored with Richard Chomet, on "Isaac Asimov, Doctor of Science Fiction" (June 1957), presents the materi- alist counterpart to the preceding one. For if Sturgeon is clearly Cartesian in his attitude towards machines and machine intelligence ("there is not in Sturgeon the least lyricism about the machine" [41:123]), Asimov is quite the opposite. And with potentially disastrous results for human development: "For though Asimov has made his robots better than his human beings, the fact that he has abused the science of behavioral conditioning [techniques de comportement] makes his humans little more than molecules" (43:122). The possibility of artificial intelligence, raised by the quantifying materialism of an Asimov, produces in Klein a very Cartesian anxiety. For if the human brain, conceived in wholly material terms, can be declared finite, it is now trackable from end to end. There is no longer a place for such qualitative entities as "reason" or 6'esprit," entities of a different order from matter but still seen somehow to "inhabit" it, to reside: [T]his world seems singularly mechanical to us. It especially resembles, and is hardly more complicated than, a series of cog-wheels, or better, a marvelous electronic brain that you can study in methodical manner by beginning at one end of the circuitry and tracing your way through, hoping you never get to the other end, for what would be left for you to do then? (43:122) To Klein's Cartesian sense, however, the radically mechanist vision of an</page><page sequence="24">330 SCIENCE-FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 16 (1989) Asimov, because it is so intolerably perfect to the human mind, is a necessary step to the cogito, to the affirmation of something uniquely human at the heart of a totally inhuman universe. For when sentimental humanitarianism fails, the Cartesian mystery, as last resort, must function: But even if in making an abstraction of an outmoded humanism and an old-fashioned anthropomorphism, [both of] which affirmed that we were the sole beings of our kind in the universe, we cannot prevent ourselves from thinking that there is something more to mankind-call it a certain gratuitous quality-the difference between a technician and a savant, for example. Asimov's robots may be perfect technicians, but such perfection does not exist among humans. (43:122) In subsequent articles on Lewis Carroll (July 1957), Clarke (July 1958), and James Blish (September 1959), Klein refines and clarifies his definition of SF by articulating a unique relationship between its components-sci- ence and fiction. As he says of Clarke, both must be present for there to exist true SF: [N]othing in Clarke's work seems foreign to science, neither his convictions, nor his intentions, nor his methods....Yet it is striking to consider that Clarke's world remains perfectly human and poetical. Is it not finally time to recognize that, contrary to the proclamations of some false prophets, science and mankind are not incompatible? (56:130) But, Klein increasingly realizes, the common ground between these "incom- patibles" is a Cartesian nexus. For in these respective domains of science and the "poetic," he comes to perceive a similarity in function between the cogito on the one hand, and the Romantic exaltation of the poet as seer or "mage" on the other. From Klein's remarks there emerges a fascinating association of the Cartesian problematic, that of the ontological recovery of reason as a unique- ly human quality and privilege in the face of the expanding hegemony of the material universe, with the symbolist pursuit of the dream. Both are dualistic responses to an encroachingly monist and materialist world-view. And both offer ways out-into the world of reason or that of dream, as Baudelaire said, "n'importe" (i.e., "it doesn't matter which"). The SF writer who provides this experience must wield what Klein sees as Clarke's instrument of predilection, what he calls his "electronic lyre." It is perhaps fitting that Klein's most ambitious attempt to define a Cartesian SF comes in an essay, not on an SF writer per se, but on British mathematician and fantasist Lewis Carroll. The essay is subtitled "the pathways of the imaginary [l'imaginaire]," and Klein clearly wishes to distinguish right road from wrong here. The path of materialist science has led to the conquest of planetary mystery by rule and line. Klein traces this road from the Romans, through Columbus's voyages, to Vernian</page><page sequence="25">THE BEGINNINGS OF FICTION 331 positivism. The materialists took from the planet "one of its essential dimensions, that of the infinitude of possibles." In contrast, Carroll's path is vertical and inward, down the rabbit hole in Columbus's closed round Earth into a mind-world, or the world as mind. Of these worlds, there can be as many as there are minds to create them, as many discoveries as there are cogitos. What is more, in Alice in Wonderland Klein sees a curious alliance of quantitative science and symbolist dream, where mathematics is re- perceived as "the strangeness [le'trangetef] of the ordinary." The result Klein calls a particularly "modem" form of the fantastic: The whole world of the modem fantastic depends on this evolution towards abstraction, on this discovery of the strangenesses of the mind [etrangetes de l'esprit] in which we had better believe because eventually we must wind up living with them. This world of fantastic abstraction, which is the result of a long evolution that leads from the Odyssey to Wonderland, has so pene- trated our modem manner of thinking, and so excited our curiosity, that it has come to shape [modeler] certain of our scientific attitudes. (44:121) "Abstraction" here preserves the original sense of the word: to extract mind from its material context. But in Carroll, what was once "I think, therefore am" is now "I think, both in order to access 'etrangetes de l'esprit,' and to bring them into existence, as something we can and must live with." The goal of this Cartesian fantastic is to invert the hegemony of physical fact or data, to substitute for this "hard" science a new one composed of the mind's dreams of time and space, a science whose relation with the physical world is a creative feedback loop: "Thus the dream plunges back into a reality from which new dreams will arise [in turn]" (44:122). The basis of this new fantastic reality-this generator of SF "worlds"-is not materiality but rather the symbol. And symbol here is the act of the mind endlessly perpetuating itself in relation to the tyranny of things. Klein notices another aspect of this Carrollian fantastic SF-and a very Cartesian and Pascalian one: the solitude of the dreamer. And this solitude is, for Klein, in its modem sense a double solitude. Not only does Carroll himself seem terrified of physical objects: "[I]t seems.. .that Carroll, in the manner of children.. .felt himself to be equally a prisoner in the labyrinth of objects" (44:123). But he incamates himself as well in characters who seem "incapable of escaping from their mental labyrinth." He seems close, then, to a Pascalian solitude in terror, his mind menaced by annihilation in the flow of matter. This solitude, a necessary condition of Carroll's fantastic world, is at the same time the necessary means of resolving its deadlock. Every fantastic world is an attempt to organize a world where solitude does not exist, whether on account of its having no place as an emotion or because it has been vanquished by certain resources of the mind or the heart. Yet as determining factor or as absence, solitude is there. (44:122)</page><page sequence="26">332 SCIENCE-FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 16 (1989) Carroll's way is the latter-via the "resources of the mind" (or of that analogous Pascalian organ, the "heart") that create the rabbit hole by which mind breaks free of the singular and hopeless condition of materiality. Klein calls Carroll's version of this Cartesian move "surrealism," and sees it as the only way of getting free of the double state of modem scientific solitude that besets him, "for there is no other cure for solitude than the sharing of a dream" (44:122). As so much imported terminology suggests, Carroll is merely the pretext here, one that allows Klein to formulate the question of what is a proper fictional response to the problem of scientific advancement in Pascalian terms and to reply in accents that echo the earlier-the French- mathematician and poet. Through this thinly veiled indirection, Klein directs his remarks at French SF writers to come, writers who are exhorted to carry on Pascal's tradition. These must be writers not only able to say, with Pascal, that "physical science will not console me for the ignorance of morality in time of affliction"; they must also adapt their French conscience to the new Carrollian predicament, so as to create an SF that will function as a form of scientific surrealism and thus will allow writer and reader to share the dream born in terror and solitude. There is clearly, for Klein, another current, opposite and inimical, in French scientific thought. And he uses Carroll and the Anglo-Saxons as means of attacking it. By asking a rhetorical question-whether Carroll, barely known in France, has had as much success there as in the Anglo- Saxon world-he is able to name current American writers in Carroll's lin- eage: people like Lewis Padgett and Fredric Brown. Klein obviously knows American SF; in the bibliographies at the end of his articles on writers like Asimov and Clarke, he cites numerous not-yet-translated works in English editions. He is aware not only of the Gernsbackian/Campbellian mainstream in American SF, but of its growing popularity among French readers, even in the pages of Fiction, where Brown is widely published. He is invoking, by indirection here, the looming specter of a Heinlein. Through ironic contrast with the relatively few Carrollian writers, he hopes perhaps to turn the popularity of the American mainstream on its head, and to strike deeper yet-at its Vernian source. For the positivist current in French thought that produced Verne (and his progeny) is openly on Klein's mind here: The French mind can disarm in no time flat the most explosive of imagin- ations. One century in the time of fairy tales was all it took to transform the disquieting legends of the Germans into sanitized stories, something colorless and odorless. (44:124) Klein suggests something like Balzac's materialist reception of Hoffmann's fantastic tales. Balzac, by transposing the German fantastic into his own materialist-oriented form of the conte philosophique, sought to depict the purely mental world, product of a fantastic (yet thoroughly Cartesian) state- ment, as something hopelessly isolated-an "incommunicable" vision. But</page><page sequence="27">THE BEGINNINGS OF FICTION 333 these materialist desires of a Balzac-and of Verne and his followers-are, for Klein, countered by a tradition that runs from Carroll to surrealism, where "the world of the fantastic is no longer either limited by or subordinated to the real." The surrealist rabbit hole, perpetually available to materialist humankind through the modern cogito of the fantastic, is the surprising and liberating act of imagination. It is clear that what Klein calls SF is not the literary form that, as Asimov defines it, measures the impact of technological advance on human beings. If it measures anything, it is the ability of the human mind or "heart" not only to react to this impact, but to escape from it by means of the dream. Taking his Cartesian wish for reality perhaps, he declares that: A good deal of SF, because of its intellectual and abstract nature, directly derives from Wonderland; and the fantasy of parallel worlds that informs Fredric Brown's What Mad World and Clifford D. Simak's Ring Around the Sun is sister to that in Through the Looking Glass. (44:124) For Klein, SF can have alternate worlds, but not the extended worlds of extrapolation. In works employing the latter, the liberating act of imagination is so fatally tied to actual technological realizations that discovery-in the inward-directed, self-reflexive mode of the Cartesian fantastic-is immed- iately "frozen" and destroyed by its material conditions: "already the discov- ery fades away before the icy precision of the technical detail" (44:125). For Klein, the Vernian conquest of outer space is futile and sterile-a vision that kills rather than creates the dream. The Cartesian need not be physically taken there, for "we already know or believe we know the gloomy sands of Mars and the dead swamps of Venus" (44:125). And if he is engaged in such space-opera, he reserves the right and privilege of the fantastic escape-hatch: "And yet, a split second before we conquer these [vast] spaces through the tranquil assurance of our reason and our machines, we experience a brief instant of Carroll's sense of wonder [emerveillement]" (44:125). The roots of this marvellous go to the core of French culture. For what in the modern context of scientific advancement is called "fantastic" is but an incarnation of the cogito or of Pascal's order of faith: a means that, precisely because this tradition remains intact, is still available to modern humanity to save it from materialist ennui. 6. Where Bridenne sought to redirect the traditional path of French SF by displacing the focus from Verne's positivism to Rosny's elegiac mysti- cism, Klein hoped, by grappling with contemporary American writers and texts, to derive a theoretical definition of the genre that realigns it with the ontological adventures of Descartes and Pascal. Klein's work, by itself, was an act of theoretical clarification unthinkable by American critics of SF at the time. But how influential was Klein's theory on the subsequent produc- tion of SF in France? The answer hinges, in part, on the degree to which the</page><page sequence="28">334 SCIENCE-FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 16 (1989) direction that Bridenne, Klein, and the early editors of Fiction set continued to dominate the magazine, and dictate the terms of the French stories it published. The answer is complicated by the fact that Fiction, like any long-running magazine, tends to develop organically. Yet, generally, the direction is set. Bridenne's search for precursors is carried on by Jacques Van Herp and Pierre Versins. And the latter, though equally fascinated with erudition and with American pulpdom and fandom, was if anything more openly chauvinist in his judgments than Bridenne. Furthermore, we do not find a comprehensive study of Heinlein until issue no. 85. This had to wait until the appearance of Have Space Suit, Will Travel, the last of three Heinlein classics serialized in Fiction. The article, by Demetre Iaokimidis, is balanced and thoughtful, certainly the best commentary on Heinlein in any language at that date. But it is as if Klein's silent interdiction caused the magazine to postpone dealing with Heinlein until the matter could no longer be put off. A poll in issue no. 64 (March 1959, a period when Klein was still very active as editorialist) tells us that two recent installments of Heinlein's A Door into Summer would both have taken first place had readers not been reluctant to vote for the same work twice. The gap between readers and editorial committee ("conseil des specialistes") is marked by the latter's collective lament that a Bester story, "The Man Who Killed Mahomet," was not better appreciated by this Heinlein-loving public. And the final mark perhaps of Klein's heavy hand on the direction of Fiction is the fact that a genuinely balanced article on Jules Verne did not appear in its pages until issue no. 117.3 Klein states at one point in his essay on Carroll that the form of Cartesian fantastic he defines is not merely French but international. It is also a viable form of SF, practiced by writers like Simak and C.L. Moore as well as by Beckett and Borges: "It seems to me that the same will exists there to push to the extreme every demonstration for its own sake, without any limit [en dehors de toute fin]" (44:125). But the ring of this statement, calling for the imagination to exercise its abstractive power for its own sake, is curi- ously French, and offers a stance echoed over and over in statements from Parnassian poets to the so-called "new novelists." An SF that conforms to this standard would not resemble Clifford Simak's writing so much as Alain Robbe-Grillet's. It would push its anti- utilitarianism to the point of gratuitous preciosity. And counter positivism with a cultivated pessimism. Indeed, the pessimistic nature of the SF pro- duced in Klein's wake has been often noticed, even in the pages of Fiction itself. In the April 1959 issue, for example, new contributor Jacques Goimard savagely attacks a previously published story by Pierre Versins and Martine Thome, "Ceux d'Argos" ("Those from Argos"). The reason: "to argue against the useless pessimism of the majority of French SF stories [nou- velles]" (65:138). The pessimism Goimard decries comes from that tradition of Pascalian dread which Bridenne and Klein so successfully reestablish at</page><page sequence="29">THE BEGINNINGS OF FICTION 335 the center of French SF. And its sense of closure, of claustrophobia and paranoia, is the direct product of the tradition of Cartesian doubt dating from Descartes' famous retreat from material constraints into the world of his stove. Yet Goimard himself cannot escape from this tradition, and elsewhere asserts that "SF and the fantastic are [both] dream-places" (L'Anne'e, p. 9). A younger writer, Patrice Duvic, in a recent interview with Pascal Thomas, sees French SF deriving its patterns not from Verne but from a film like Cocteau's Orphe'e.4 Yielding to the dream, Orpheus cannot return to material reality except to turn around and cross the barrier into the land of dream again. Even if that dream and death have become one. The direction of much subsequent French SF, especially that of the "literary" writers who evolved out of Fiction's early programs and grand ambitions-Klein him- self, Curval, Andre Ruellan, Jean-Pierre Andrevon, Michel Jeury-has been the inner not the outer voyage, the search for a dream that leads not just to imaginary mindscapes but to an obsession with mind alone as sole and ultimate place of investigation. It is an SF obsessed with the mystery of the cogito, with the lure of abstraction, solitude, and death. NOTES 1.

Les debuts de Fiction.-La revue Fiction e'tait loin d'e^tre simplement l'edition fran,aise de "The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction." A partir de la date de fondation en 1953, et au cours des six premieres annees, les redacteurs cherchaient a identifier ce qui diterminait la science- fiction francaise et ce qu'elle pourrait devenir. Puisque la "science-fiction" n'existait pas en tant que telle en France, les redacteurs de Fiction tenterent de definir cette forme par rapport d d'autres genres reconnus par la tradition: le fantastique, 1'etrange et le mystere. D'abord, le re'sultatfut une definition sophistique'e du genre sans e'gal d l'e'poque (meme dans les pays anglo-saxons). Ensuite, il en decoula e'galement une notion tres particuliere et traditionnelle de ce qu'est cette science-fiction francaise, c'est- d-dire une litte'rature qui n'explore pas l'avenir ou les mondes lointains mais qui sonde les mondes paralleles interieurs en cherchant le mystere de l'univers materiel dans les recoins de l' imagination de 1'esprit humain plutot que sur d'autres planetes. Cet essai traite surtout du travail de deux critiques de la premiere e'quipe de Fiction, Jean-Jacques Bridenne et Ge'rard Klein. Dans les premiers nume'ros de la revue, Bridenne e'crit une se'rie d'essais par lesquels il tente de degager une veritable tradition fran,aise de la science-fiction. Par la suite, Klein analyse l'a?uvre de certains "maitres" americains contemporains de la SF a" la lumiere de cette me^me tradition franqaise qu'il est en train de definir. De ces premiers nume'ros, une science-fiction s'ensuit dont la forme est fondamen- talement carte'sienne et surre'aliste. Cette forme litt&amp;raire construit le reve par la raison et cet acte paradoxal vise a' pre'server le privile'ge du cogito face a un univers sujet au terreur du nombre et de l'infiniment vide. (GS) Abstract.-Fiction was far from being simply the French version of The Maga- zine of Fantasy &amp; Science Fiction. Over the half-dozen odd years from its outset in 1953, the editors of the former sought to identify what French SF peculiarly was-and could be. This process of definition involved placing SF in relation to categories traditionally recognized by French culture: the fantastic, the uncanny, "mystery fiction." The result was both a sense of generic function without equivalent in the Anglo-Saxon SF world at the time and a very particular, and traditional, sense of what SF is: a literature that explores alternate and parallel, rather than other, worlds; a literature that turns away from expansive paradigms to explore the inner world of the imagining organ-the rational mind itself. To follow this process of definition step by step, this essay focuses on the work of two early Fiction critics: Jean-Jacques Bridenne and Ge'rard Klein. Bridenne seeks, in the early issues, to establish the nature of the French SF tradtion by bringing to light a series of native precursors. Building on the direction this lineage sets, Klein analyzes the work of a number of new American "masters" in the light of a gradually forming French sense of the SF genre. As Klein</page><page sequence="31">THE BEGINNINGS OF FICTION 337 comes ultimately to define it, this SF is Cartesian and surrealist in nature. Which means that it seeks a logical cultivation of dream worlds. And should do so in hopes of preserving the privilege of the cogito in relation to a material universe otherwise defined by Pascal's two infinities. (GS)</page></plain_text>
