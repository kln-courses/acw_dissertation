<plain_text><page sequence="1">MICHAEL CULLEN: A PAINTER PAINTING Over the last few years, the sur faces of Michael Cullen's paintings have become quasi-reliefs, unlikely constructions which embody rudimentary figurative sub jects in veritable mountain ranges of jagged and vertiginous impasto. Colour, straight from can and tube, unmixed, is piled on as if with a trowel and left there undigested, unmediated, for us to make of it what we will. The economy of elab oration, though, is contradicted by the sheer, unstinting generosity of delivery. Alpine peaks and valleys of snowy whites, visceral reds, flesh pinks, sunny yellows, sky blues, through which patches of raw burlap are still clearly visible, bespeak a rare largesse, a sensual overload. The dual message we receive is that the painting is there in a concrete, physical way, there vehemently, but it is also there with difficulty. The effect is usually uningratiating. Each painting has an indigestible roughness about it. And then, without warning, you can come upon pieces that are lus ciously, edibly beautiful. The notion of the painter's painter is a cliche, but that is what Cullen is, in more ways than one. Even if you don't like his work, you have to acknowledge the level of his ambition and achievement. Painting permeates his life and for him life is art. He has consistently understood the importance of the big picture, not for its own sake, but the need to test ideas on a large scale, to summarise, to punctuate. And his work is continually informed by other art, by his knowledge of painting and painters. He was born in Kilcoole, near Greystones on the Co Wicklow coast, in 1946. After secondary school, he found work as a silk screen printer. Even then, however, he thought of himself as a painter, employed for his skills as a printer. When it became clear that his employers regarded him as more of a factotum, they soon parted company. It was a pivotal moment because it established his own priorities. He went to Dublin, where he had a fairly unsettled life, moving every few months or so, and he attended classes at the National College of Art and Design during 1962. He was involved with the Hell Fire Club Gallery, working for Edgar Battle, an arrangement that provided him with a studio and even with art materials. Lured by the promise of living cheaply, he made his way cir cuitously to Spain in 1969, settled for a while, painted landscapes, and the following year moved on to London. There he briefly attended the Central School of Art to do life drawing. Deciding to become a fulltime student at the National College of Art and Design, he returned to Dublin. However, it was a turbu lent time in the NCAD's history and after a contentious final year, both Cullen and his friend Michael Mulcahy were failed. A year after wards he was eventually granted his diploma after reassessment. In 1973 meanwhile, sans diploma, he went to Spain and Morocco with Mulcahy. In some ways it was a dis astrous trip. He came down with hepatitis and, with few resources, had to suffer in poor conditions for months. Nevertheless, the work he made abroad and after his return home marked a tuming point, mar rying his natural representational facility to a concem with the more abstract aspects of picture-making - though it must be said that he is extremely uncomfortable with the word 'abstract'. The Moroccan work establishes his interest in flat pattern, which continues to be a comerstone of his approach to pic torial organisation. Since 1977 he has been based in Henrietta Street in Dublin, where he maintains a comfortable high ceilinged studio in a big early Georgian house, although, an enthusiastic traveller, he has moved around a great deal and lived abroad for periods of time. He went to the United States and Mexico in 1980, bussing across vast distances. With Eithne Jordan he went to Berlin in 1984 and, bar 1988, which he spent at Annaghmakerrig in County Monaghan, he was there until 1989. He has also spent time in the South of France, in a small vil lage, near Montpellier in Languedoc (an experience which released floods of white light into his painting), and in 1993 he returned to Mexico, staying initially in Zacatecas, then in Chiapas (later the centre of the Zapatista uprising) for about six months in all. At home or elsewhere, work has always been pri mary: 'It's the painting that has to be sustained', he said to Margaret MacNamidhe in relation to travel, 'you have to get in there and cultivate ideas.' And while location is important, it rarely takes over: 'Think of Yeats creating a Byzantium in Sligo.' When he first went to America he carried a camera and took photographs to work from. On this latter trip he didn't even bring a camera. He made himself work harder by keeping a kind of visual diary in sketchbooks, drawing everything along the A knowledge of painters and painting informs the work of this artist but official recognition has eluded him for too long argues Aidan Dunne. 1.

From his excursions he certainly imports colour. The com parative dullness of his earliest landscapes, which carried over into much of his first North African work, has gradually yielded to an enduring fascination with bright, full colour. He has consistently made self-portraits. More, his work has consistently explored his own personal world and, as he is a painter, that world includes the studio and its surroundings. As Henry Sharpe noted in his 'Making Sense'catalogue, in the work from his time in America in 1980, which was marked by a new boldness of colour and stylistic cohesion, Cullen is an habitual presence in the canvases, but he 'is always curiously peripheral - the eternal tourist at the edge of things, unengaged, looking on.' He developed a shorthand visual notation for self, a graphic cut out with his characteristic John Lennon glasses. The American paintings boast big open spaces, comic-book cacti, puffs of cot ton-wool clouds, two-lane blacktops, all incarnated in livid pinks, blues, reds, rendered in a conspicuously stylised linear shorthand. 'Knock! Knock! Intrusion' (1979), a big quadriptych painted before his departure, sees him groping for an appropriate rep resentational style, populating a succession of Francis Bacon-like arenas with tokens of animal and human presence. Everything is there, but the form is inchoate, tight, almost stilted. In a sense, America provided the solution. After America, he adopted and began to relax into an idiomatic style derived from his own mark making preferences and the example of Philip Guston. Guston, the Abstract Expressionist painter, had devised a cartoon-like, comic book figuration in his work based on gross caricature. Similarly, Cullen opted for a degree of caricature and to some extent embraced a form of comic book picaresque. He plays anthropomorphic games with a menagerie of ani mals, and puts his human actors through various dramatic paces, implicating them in different theatrical frameworks: the circus, the farce, the tragedy, the charade. Stock figures include the artist as himself, the artist as clown, the model, usually a nude woman, often a nude man as well, death in the form of a skeletal figure, and, vitally, the canaille, the rabble. The notion of the canaille (it derives from the Italian canaglia or dog pack) becomes important, from the massed audiences of the circus spectacle to the more sinister mobs of the Berlin work. As it happens, the animals he likes to depict include dogs, not in threatening packs but as fairly domesticated individuals, and specifically his own cross-bred Cubist dog, a cousin of the dog which Picasso included in his variations on Velasquez's Las Meninas (evidently a portrait of one of his own dogs), and at this stage a kind of mascot which, with its vast eye, is like a cross between Cerberus and a Cyclops. Then there are zebras, particularly useful because of their stripes (for he is extremely fond of stripes as a graphic device), parrots and chimpanzees, both of whom, again, stand in for the artist. Prior to his departure for Berlin in 1984, he produced an out standing body of work, exhibited at the Lincoln Gallery in May and June. The show marked an impressive synthesis of his vari ous thematic and stylistic preoccupations up to that time. Free brushwork, casual compositions and a bright palette engender a mood of exuberance. Areas of raw canvas are visible, adjacent to layer upon layer of pigment. Alternatives, changes of mind, speculative passages are all left there on the surface. Colours are used in their primal state, brushed on and, if mix ing is desired, mixed roughly on the canvas itself. Brushmarks are left hanging, pigment dripped and splashed copiously. Heavy black, white or red lines hold compositions together. The paint ing's status as stage is emphasised by an exceptional number of truncated figures, by characters wandering casually in and out of the wings, by ladders that lead out of the frame. Figures and locations, though spare and mannered, are treat ed quite naturalistically. That is, each picture contains one more or less coherent space viewed from one point. A central facet of Cullen's work as it developed throughout the 1980s was his progressively more flexible view of pictorial space. 'The Cubists,' he acknowledged in an interview with Gerry Dukes, 'made the break-through by dismantling or deconstructing the landscape, the object, the person, translating the three-dimensional space into a two-dimensional plane ... In many of my paintings I play the surface off against the implied space, simul taneously invoking and revoking some of the major features in the tradition of European painting.' When we look at I'm Popeye the Painter Man or Life is a Bitch and Then You Die, we are confront ed with walls of paint as opposed to windows that we can look through. 'You see in a medium,' Cullen has remarked in the same interview, 'not through it.' Cullen, that is to say, enjoys the post-Cubist freedom to ignore conventional rules of perspective, trading this freedom off against the limitation of an acknowledged flatness. Besides the space itself, however, he has also taken liberties with naturalistic representations of figures and objects, radically reorganising structures in a directly Cubist manner, and with something of the freedom of late Picasso in terms of flexibility, pace and levi ty. In fact, Picasso ranks with Guston in terms of influence: just think of Cullen's comparable adoption of the studio as world. While these developments are decisively consolidated in the work made in Annaghmakerrig in 1988, there is also the long spell in Berlin to consider. Though from a more or less rural background, Cullen has spent most of his life in cities, and living in Berlin, he became interested in the idea of the city itself as a complex entity, a vast organism with an indifferent life of its own, its myriad layers of space and activity never entirely appre hensible to an individual consciousness. 'The metaphor of the walled city has always appealed to me, the idea of an enclosed, labyrinthine city, like Blake's Jerusalem.' Berlin is a big, landlocked city with a formidable, terrible his tory. When Eithne Jordan and he moved there, it was still divided. Cullen's vision of the city is every bit as bleak, but really the bleakness, the grim view of life and death, is the painter's own, here bome out by the facts, rather than something specific His paintings are theatrical, in the sense that they maintain a consistently high level of calculated artifice. 211 IRISH ARTS REVIEW</page><page sequence="3">MICHAEL CULLEN: A PAINTER PAINTING 2.

A grid of streets and buildings regulates his compositions. People and buildings alike become anonymous silhouettes. The ubiquitous canaille presses in threateningly. The atmosphere is comparable to that in Fritz Lang's film Fury, a powerful indictment of mob rule in which an innocent stranger is the victim of a lynch mob. 'He sees Berlin,' Dorothy Walker wrote in 1986, 'as a walled city as in medieval times, having a certain siege mentality, a heightened feeling of delight in survival.' The circus of city life proves a bleak entertainment. The archetypal metropolis, hugely indifferent to the individual human subject, is the scene of con flict, murder, rape, hysteria. The mood is summed up when we see a crucifixion proceeding matter-of-factly while passers-by get on with their business, the city's pulse doesn't even skip a beat. Our 'Clown Witness' is summarily dealt with, as Gerry Dukes says, 'buffeted, marginalised, knocked down, badged in motley....In one image, Masturbating Clown and Panzer, we are given an extraordinary image of powerlessness and anomie. The material carapace, the armour of urban egotism, cannot be pene trated and the allowed fool makes contact only with himself.' After France, white light banishes the blackness, the Teutonic gloom. That brilliant light irradiates Popeye and the painter on the point of painting. In I'm Popeye the Painter Man. 'Popeve' himself has a Cubist head, split between full-view and profile, Van Gogh's hat, massive hands and exposed genitals. His blonde model, spra wled out on a bed or couch, is naked, with pneumatic breasts and exposed pudenda. Although the title plays on the association, and a certain bouncy joviality of mood (the parodic masculinity-feminity, activity-passivity of the artist-model relationship parallelling that of Popeye and Olive Oyl), together with the marine background, reinforces it, Popeye the Sailor Man is not the reference's final destination. That is the notion of the painter as performer who will make the eyes pop out of your head, the spirit of Van Gogh in the South of France. Painter About to Paint a Painting is a homage to an illustrious predecessor, Jack B Yeats' About to Write a Letter, Cullen's favourite Yeats painting. Both title and image set up a mood of anticipation. Despite differences in format and tone, there are obvious compositional similarities between the two works. Cullen's picture is a studio scene. An artist, again kitted out like Van Gogh, with huge, bulbous fingers and a tumescent penis, is poised before a framed canvas on an easel. A massive blue dog occupies the foreground. His vast eye blends with his open mouth as he gazes and barks at a nude woman model, who is either posing or on the verge of fleeing. Certainly the dog is con suming the woman with his ferocious eye. The painter has a mirror image, the silhouette of a man emerging from a screen on the right. His erection confirms that the anticipation is also sexu al, or perhaps equates a strictly sexual anticipation with the painter's approach to the 'virgin' canvas or his posing model. By the 1990s, Cullen routinely deconstructs and reconstructs his fig ures, taking extreme liberties with proportion, space and scale. His paintings are theatrical, in the sense that they maintain a consistently high level of calculated artifice; they apparently encapsulate dramas enacted for our benefit and they make explicit use of such performance settings as circus ring and stage. It might be interesting to look at them in the light of some of the ideas of Clement Greenberg or, more pertinently, of the art the orist Michael Fried, relating to the concept of theatricality in painting. Broadly speaking, Fried outlines a rationale for mod ernist painting and the importance of formal considerations (freed from a representational task, it must be said), that is dis tinct from, but has some parallels with, Greenberg's notions of painting's movement towards self-identity and purity. Oddly enough, in its original setting, which was an analysis of late eighteenth-century French painting during the time of Diderot, the term 'theatricality' applied not to the kind of work that you might expect - the history paintings, the overly calcu lated narrative bourgeois genre scenes awash with senti mentality - but to the perceived excesses of the Rococo, to an overly decorative and complicit art. Diderot championed Jean Baptiste Chardin and jean Baptiste Greuze. Initially, Diderot saw in the latter's subject paintings a degree of self-absorption and naturalistic detail that served as an anti dote to the artificiality and moral laxity of Fran?ois Boucher. Fried develops this notion of an absorption. a self-awareness that allows the spectator a fuller, truer access to the world of the painting. More and more, painters address the history of painting. As Steve Connor puts it: 'in Hegelian terms ... the dialectical engagement of the new with the old ... (brings) an intensified self-consciousness at each stage of renewal.' Painting progressively becomes itself, though without Greenberg's point of terminal purification. Cullen's work encapsulates the apparent paradox between the opposing pulls of theatricality and absorption. According to Diderot's criteria it is, on the one hand, theatrical in its know ingness. It rehearses decorative strategies and motifs with shameless affection. It advertises a luscious physicality of detail, but in a stylised manner. It is often animated by and dramatises sensual and sexual desire. It is also self-absorbed, however, burrowing deeply into art history for its subject matter, its terms of reference. Its physicali ty relates not only, not even primarily, to the subject matter but also to the 'thereness' of the painting itself. Pigment heaped irregularly onto burlap, though it might be disposed along approximately representational lines, continually drags the image back from any illusory picture space to the real space of the surface. Furthermore, as with Jackson Pollock's paintings, where the dripped paint lies emphatically on and not at all with in the surface, we are not really allowed any access to the shallow space of juxtaposed planes that characterises Cubism and the uniform shallow space evident in the work of some Abstract Expressionist painters. Cullen uses an essentially Cubist approach to deconstruct spaces and objects, but then confounds our expectations: every mark is a superimpostion. We cannot get behind the canvas. Despite the undeniable, central representational element, Frank Stella's minimalist dictum, Cullen uses an essentially Cubist approach to deconstruct spaces and objects, but then con founds our expectations. 214 IRISH ARTS REVIEW</page><page sequence="6">MICHAEL CULLEN: A PAINTER PAINTING 'What you see is what you get', could well apply. What of the paintings' representational status? For most of the time they are representational in a curiously self-referring way: the studio, the accoutrements of picture-making, the artist in the studio, the artist and his model, allegories of the painter and his public - in the same way, admittedly, images of artist and model could be read as standing for more general views of relationships between the sexes - and then stock subjects like the vase of flowers, the bowl of fruit (that might almost have 'still-life' stamped on them), and the landscape. The image of the artist is often extremely self-reflexive: the Van Gogh archetype in the Painter Cuts Ear Off (1992) (a tide that reads like a newspa per headline), I'm Popeye the Painter Man (1992) and Study: Painter on his Way to Work (after Van Gogh) (1991), the pointedly tautologous Painting Painter (1989) and Painter Painting (1992) (two of many), the ironic Painting Monkey (1984), the hermeti cally self-contained Masturbatng Clown (1989). There is a conceptual flatness i to these subjects, just as there is a liter al flatness to their representation. Then there are comprehensive re workings of paintings, as with Painter About to Paint a Painting, correlative to Yeats' picture; Luncheon on the Grass: study after 'Le Dejeuner sur l'Herbe' by Edouard Manet (1992); Study: 'La Grande Odalisque' (after Ingres) (1991), as well as pictures by Van Gogh, Picasso (a series of Crying Woman (1990)- reiatred to Picasso's Weebin_ Woman), and Velasquez's Las Meninas in Music from Annaghmakerrig: Painting Painter' (1990), Ian Van Evck's The Amolfini Marriage as well as many other references and quota tions. He has also reworked stock subjects, like The Three Graces (1983), and the crucifixion. In all it amounts to a systematic interrogation of the history, and the mythology, of painting. In many respects Greenberg could well have approved of most of his output since the mid-1970s. The paintings are rep resentational, but Greenberg has nothing against representation per se, and they are intimately concerned with the formal questions that so preoccupied him, with flatness, with painting's self-identity. But they deny the grail of an even tual closure, a final purity. They are expressly open, irreverent, demotic, picking up on ideas beyond the fine art canon, notably the idiom of broad caricature, the freedom of the car toon, but they are not postmodernist works in the sense of assuming a stylistic promiscuity. We should not forget that Cullen points to his own life and surroundings as his major source: you must paint what you know, he has said more than once, what's around you and what's going on around you. And it is true that each exhibition mirrors events in his own life, obviously so in the case of his move to Berlin, or in terms of the intimations of mortality in the Dance of Death series with its allusions to Dante (In a Dark Wood (1998)) which saw the artist, heading for his mid-forties, facing up to his own mortality. In these paintings a sense of vitality and physical voluptuousness is inextricably bound up with the certainty of death, most graphically in the several Nude and Skeleton (1989) paintings. Similarly his exhibitions A Screaming Silence (1990), A Painter on His Way to Work (1991) and Le Peintre Solitaire (1992) coincide with tumultuous person al events. There is no distance between life and art. While, for example, irony is employed, there is no ironic dis tance between painter and style. 'A painter's style is the product of his life experience,' Cullen said in conversation with Gerry Dukes, 'of the academic and practical knowledge of art and its media, of the cast of his mind and the sleight of his hand. It seems a hopeless, even hapless enterprise to try to pin down something so fluid and fugitive.' Cubism is straightfor wardly employed for the pictorial possibilities it opens up. It seems that a persuasive argument can be made that his paint ings function within a Western, modernist tradition in an unusually perceptive and constructive way. But it would be as well to leave the last word to the painter himself, or at least to a sentiment that he thought worth quoting. It was written by Sandro Chia: 'It is not a good idea to analyse painting...The most elevated, intelligent and subtle approach to painting is to say whether you like it or not.'
