<plain_text><page sequence="1">Myths as Organological Facts After Rereading D6nes Bartha's "Double Pipe of JAnoshida" JAnos KAsPATI At the age of twenty-six, Denes Bartha devoted a large scale study to a find excavated in a cemetery from the Avar age, the famous double pipe of Jinoshida. This study, published parallelly in Hungarian and GEerman in 1934, analyses in thorough detail firstly the find itself, then the historical and organological material attached to it, finally drawing a comprehensive picture of the chain of occurrences of this musical instrument all over the world in the light of our comples knowledge related to the typology, ethno- graphy and history of the double pipe. In my view, organology has every reason to be proud of this work still valid today, being an outstanding example of scientific analysis relying on facts and nothing but facts. However, the life of musical instruments has an unrecorded background not represented in the objects themselves or only indirectly, without a know- ledge of which it is impossible to discuss in full depth the complete picture of a given musical instrument as well as the musical culture represented by it. In contrast to the facts - or rather besides them there is a flexible chain of tradition, at times of uncertain nature, a series of myths, mythologems, beliefs, and customs, which inform us about the individual and social con- texts in which man used objects-in this case musical instruments and beyond this the important further knowledge offered by the musical instru- ments as objects related to the complete life and culture of a given society. In my present paper I wish to put forward a few ideas concerning the myths of organology, namely the data found in mythical traditions, customs or ideologies. By this I do not wish in the least to criticise Denes Bartha's work mentioned above or to diminish its significance. On the contrary, I wish to emphasize that the train of thought outlined here was itself initiated by the rereading of his book. It is not even rny wish to list the data of mythical traditions as a supplement to the topic discussed by him from another angle; my efforts are merely directed at including in a system some principal- Studia M?ssicoloSica Academsae Scientuzrum Il?snvaticae 31, 1989 AkaAmiai Riado, B?sdapest</page><page sequence="2">6 J. Karpatt: Mythe as Organologscal Facts theoretical viewpoints of the ethnological approach supplementing factual investigation, by making use of the data of my own research field, the musical cultures of Eastern and Southern Asia. Being aware of the importance of the topic, the great pioneers of organo- logical research also conducted meaningful research on the myths related to musical instruments. It is quite characteristic, for example, that even the title of Curt Sachs' book, published in 1929, refers to non-factual or non-objective data: Geist ?bnd Werden der Musikinstr?bmente. Both in this work and in his book on the history of musical instruments published in English in 1940, Sachs presents an enormous quantity of data from the unrecorded organo- logical traditions of the most diverse peoples of the world. A similar sensitivity to the topic is revealed by that other classic master of organology, Andre Schaeffner who, next to Brailoiu, is the greatest figure of French ethnomusicology, creating a school of his own. His book entitled Oriyine des instrqxrnents de musiq?be, published in 1936, while the modern ethno- logical approach is radiated from all of its details, devotes a separate chapter to the mythology of musical instruments and their mythical characteristics. Another master with a great number of followers must be mentioned here, the Swedish Ernst Emsheimer, who made a significant contribution to the correct interpretation of unrecorded traditions related to musical instruments. In addition to Denes Bartha's book mentioned above, the most direct impetus to write this paper was given to me by a Japanese scholar, Gen'ichi Tsuge, who in 1978 published an article not large in size but all the more significant in content, entitled "Bamboo, Silk, Dragon and Phoenis: Sym- bolism in the Musical Instruments of Asia". This study eserted a special influence on me not through the data presented by it but much rather by the endeavour to include in a system the symbolism of Asian musical instru- ments. Professor Tsuge's system summarizes the potentials of symbolism in the following five categories. 1. Anthropomorphism, theriomorphism, zoomorphism and ornithomor- phic symbolism, including symbolism expressed by the nomenclature of vari- ous parts of the instrument. 2. Symbolism concerning the materials from which the instrument is made. 3. Symbolism concerning the function of the instrument specific aesociation with its sound, cultural connotation of the instrument, etc. 4. Duality symbolism; bilateral symmetry, sesual symbolism, dualism of yin and yang, right and left, etc. Studia Muacolo¢ica Academiae Scientiar?sm H?snvaricae 31, 1989</page><page sequence="3">J. Karpatz: Myths as Organologwa Facts 7 5. Numerological symbolism. As we can see, this system is highly diverse, and, quite naturally, testifies to the Asian approach of its author. At the same time, precisely on account of its apt and ingenious categories, this systematization induces us to give it further consideration. It raises the question whether the author is not simplifying the matter by forcing a number of similar but essentially different phenomena into a common ca,tegory of symbolism. For example, the associations attached to the sound of musica,l instruments or to their cultural connotations do not unequivocally have a symbolic nature. Similarly, sesual symbolism is undoubtedly an important part of the topic but not every sesual connotation has a symbolic content- let us think, for example, of sesual taboos or, in exact contrast to these, the close connections with this or that ses. Naturally, Professor Tsuge concentrated his attention on symbolism, so we cannot possibly call him to account for something he did not include among his aims. This is especially so when the study in question presumably for reasons of limited space discusses in detail only the first two categories of his system. Thus if we set up as our aim the further development of this systematization, we do not intend to criticize what has just been outlined, but merely to use it as a starting point in the laying down of a basis for a working method, more appropriate for us, possessing a wider and more general validity. The existence of symbolism related to musical instruments points to the fact that musical instruments, in addition to their being suitable for carrying out some kind of musical zetivity, are parts of a given musical culture, thereby possessing a comples content which is perhaps not even indirectly linked to the musical activities which can be carried out with their help. For that verzr reason, the symbolism of musical instruments is not an indepandent syin- bolism but constitutes a part of the whole symbolic sy3te.n of the given culture, thus its meaning can only be identified in such a larger, more coin- plete context. However, it must also be borne in mind that this larger, more complete symbolic system does not exist in isolation, but is connected to the mythology of the given culture. If only a single glance is cast at Profe3Sor Tsuge's cate- gories outlined above, it becomes obvious that in the majority of case3-in an explicit or implicit manner -the main role is played by mythological factors. When he distinguishes, for e2rample, between zoomorphic, therio- morphic and ornithomorphic symbolism, he does so not for the sake of bio- logical accuracy but because he wishes to e2rpress somehow the difference Studia Mus?aolosica Academiae Scientiarum Hunaancae 31, 1989</page><page sequence="4">8 J. Karpz: Myths as Organologzeal PFacts between fish and dragon. The theriomorphic category accomodat those monsters which exist only in mythology and which whould be misleading to mention among real animals. At the same time we have to know that the symbolism of e2risting animals gains an additional colouring in such a con- te2rt too and thus being aware of all this the three types may actually be regarded together as a zoomorphic type. If, however, mythology plays such a prevailing role in symbolism, its further consequence is that rituals are in a close connection with symbolism, or, to put it differently: symbolism cannot be discussed in isolation from ritual. For the sake of a better understanding, let us cast a glance again at Professor Tsuge's system. Some of the symbolic types figuring here, e.g. the function of musical instruments, cultural connotation, sesual symbolism, dual symbolism, are actually ritual phenomena which do not stand alone but are only connected to certain rituals, i.e. ceremonies or customs. Now the question arises whether it is not more purposoful to discuss symbolism, mythology and ritual system together, for these forms of tradi- tion exist together in the cultures of peoples, merged into each other and pre- supposing each other. These three forms of tradition, different yet still con- nected to each other, together constitute the world view of peoples or we may call it with for example Emsheimer their ideology. Naturally, the term "ideology" is felt really appropriate in cases where a system of ideas, a view of the world displays a conscious formulation, e.g. in the case of Chinese cosmo- logy or the Vedic religion. Still Emsheimer considers this term appropriate in re- lation to the world of beliefs of the peoples of Siberia, in all probability because it presents a complex expression of the whole mythical, ritual and symbolic notions (Emsheimer 1944). Let us now try to reformulate Professor Tsuge's system, bearing in mind that we are faced not simply with symbolism but a world view embracing symbolism, mythology and ritual system, i.e. ideology. This world view or ideology formulates ideas, rules, and conditions related to musical instru- ments which characteristically join together the musical world with the abstract world in answer to the following questions: what material is it made of i in what way does it reflect nature and the world? who is it used by and for what purpose ? Perhaps it colnes to light from these brief questions too that our systematiza- tion includes a time logic as well since the first question refers to the "pre- vious life" of the musical instrument and the second (mainly) to the creation and formulation of the musical instrument. In the following we shall see that the three questions and the three categories hidden behind them give rise Studfia Musicolosica Academiae Scientiarum Hunvaricae 31, 1989</page><page sequence="5">J. Karpatz: Mythe as Organologtcal Facts 9 to further sub-qustions - and, consequently, sub-categories but these can only be outlined on the basis of a more detailed discussion, presenting them in advance would only lead to confusion. Let us therefore see what replies can be given to the three questions. A singer has a lute made by the smith says an African myth but when he tries the finished musical instrument he is not satisfied with it, and does not like the way it sounds. When he complains to the smith, this is the reply he receives: you have to add the heart to it, the wood sucks your blood, your breath. (After Frobenius, Schneider 1951: 122.) IIere we have in clear wording the claim that the musical instruments must acquire some kind of physical unity, some physical identification based upon an intellectual unity with the man playing it. Thus the claim can be fulfilled by soaking the material of the musical instrument, earlier neutral, with human blood, i.e. by making it personal, by consecrating it. While, on the one hand, this myth refers to the ritual of consecration, inauguration - perhaps combined with human sacrifice on the other hand it pushes our mind in the following direction: perhaps the closer some material is to man, the laore suitable it is for making a musical instrument. There is a legend from German mythology, where a legendary harpist makes himself a musical instrument from the bones and hair of a girl killed by a wicked woman. :Her fingers were used for making the keys, her long blond hair was transformed into the strings. (After Gritnm, Combarieu 1909: 261.) A musical instrument made from human bones is not merely the object of mythology. If borne in mind that the practice of both cannibalism and human sacrifice (the two, of course, could be carried out parallelly too) sup- plied plenty of "raw material" for making such musical instruments, we can- not really be amazed at its "inhumaneness". In relation to both activities we must maintain the statement, today looked upon as an ethnological comluon- place, that they actually served sacral purposes. According to Andre Schaeff- ner "in the utilization of bones, and especially hulnan bones . . . we can dis- cover a relationship between making lnusical instruments and magic". (Schaeffner 1936: 120.) Obviously, man discovered the suitability of hollow materials reed, human or animal shin-bones for producing sound at a very early age. With- out wishing to discuss the priority of the two kinds of material, we have to Studia Musicolosica Academtae ScienZiarum Hunvaricae 31, 1989</page><page sequence="6">10 J. Karpatz: Mythe as Organologtcal Facts risk the assumption that in the case of human bone the magic ideas may have supported the belief of resurrection, bringing to life. For if human breath was very closely associated with the notion of the soul as testified by a number of languages indeed they were regarded as identical, then on the basis of black art, operating on the same principle, the idea of the resurrecting effect of the breath "blown back" into the human bone is quite plausible. It cannot escape our attention to what anoverwhelmingdegree windmusic (mouth organ, flute, pipe, oboe) is connected with funeral ceremonies and burial rituals. While in relation to the Neolithic period confirmed by the practice of some tribes of Africa and Borneo only hypotheses can be set up, the tradi- tion of Tibetan music culture alive today too furnishes unrefutable evidence for the utilization of human bones as musical instruments. Rkany-gltng is a trumpet made fronl humaUn shin-bone, and thod-rnya is a so-called sand- glass-drum made from a human skull. In connection with the laUtter there is a living tradition that the two hemispheres of the drum fastened together should, if possible, be made from the skulls of two human beings belonging to the opposite sexes, and having died a violent death. Since the form of the instrument carries the notion of duality, it is only natural that a sexual con- notation be attached to it as well. In a similar manner, a sexual phallic character is carried by the trumpet made from bone, relnarks Schaeffner (1936: 121), which seems to be justified by the sesual symbolism of the lamaist religion. However, more important than this is the symbolism supporting the utilization of human bones, behind which lies in all probability the highly emphatic death cult of the religion carrying a number of shamanistic elements its ideology of metempsychosis. By the waUy, Schaeffner does not draw aU shaUrp borderline between the utilization of human bones and that of animal bones, and he clearly attaches greater importance to the idea connecting them, namely that in both cases the one-time living being becomes the material of the musical instrument. This view is strengthened by Marius Schneider too, whose approach can be summarized as follows: the musical instrument, since in its material it origi- nates from an earlier living being (man, animal), represents sacrifice as well, the power of the sacrificer to force a no longer living being, sacrificed already, to speak. This carries danger too, since it places in the hands of a liv- ing man the possibility of prevailing over a dead being. (Schrleider 1951: 122.) In utilizing animal bones, skin, even hair, the idea was immanent that the material originating from an earlier living being keeps on being the vehicle of life, the soul in its present form transformed into a musical instrument. Studu Musicoloaica Academiae Scienturum Hunvaricae 31, 1989</page><page sequence="7">J. Karpiz: Myths as Organological Faots ll In certain cases the transformation is so thoroughgoing that the materia1 utilized preserves the quality of the original living being in an ideal sense only. An example to this effect is one of the key myths of GEreek mythology, the myth of Hermes, of the origin of lyric poetry worded in a hymn by Homer. The little Hermes, emerging from the stone cradle, creates the famous musical instrument from the horns and skins of Apollo's cows and the shell of a turtle. The precise description leaves no doubts about an already existing, well- known practice having received an aitological form in this story. And as far as the two animals utilized are concerned, although both constitute recognize- able components of the musical instrument, they preserve the symbolism of their original quality in an indirect manner only. An almost diametrically contradictory case is presented by the myth of the origin of the Mongolian rnortn-chmhr. After IIaslund-Christensen this myth is quoted here in an abridged version: Many-many years ago, the twenty- eight stars of the sky descended in the form of young warriors on the earth every night. Their leader, the young prince, whose horse was a magic steed named Jonung Khara Mori, fell in love with a shepherd girl. The young prince regularly spent the nights with his mistress but to the great astonishment of the girl always disappeared by dawn. On one occasion, while the prince was asleep, the girl came out of the tent and discovered a steed with little wings waiting for the young man. In order to bind him even closer to herself, and that he could not vanish so suddenly any more, the girl cut off the horse's wings. The young prince was still able to fly away on the back of his steed at dawn, but for lack of wings, the steed grew tired quickly, he flew lower and lower, until finally, exhausted completely, he collapsed in the desert and es- haled his soul. The young prince bemoaned his horse in utter grief, for with- out him he could return neither to his companions in the sky nor to his be- loved. And while he was bemoaning his horse, caressing him and his tears fell on his dead body, the dead steed was transformed into a musical instru- ment in a miraculous manner. And since that time on the young prince has been wandering along the steppes and among the mountains of Mongolia incessantly, singing about his dead horse, the distant stars and his lost love, accompanied by his musical instrument. (Haslund-Christensen 1943: 35 37.) This legend connects the Mongolians' most important animal, thc one- time most significant basis of their social existence with their most important musical instrument, considered as their national symbol too, the mortn-chur (morin- horse) or kAil-chur, belonging to the type of spike fiddles. In its construction, the most important materials, apart from wood, are horse skin, mane and tail hairs. In addition, afi an ornament, there figures the indispen- sable carved horse head in place of the scroll of string instruments. (See Studia Muacolorica Academiae Scientiarum Hunsaricae 31, 1989</page><page sequence="8">12 J. Rarpatz: Myths as Organologzeal Facts Fig. 1.) In this case - as it is perhaps not necessary to emphasize the in- strument's material stubbornly preserves its "earlier life", quality. Thus the musical instrument in itself testifies to an intertwining which represents at the same time and mutually the Mongolian people's material and intellectual culture, past, world of legends, symbolism and present. Traditional cultures consider plants to be living beings too, therefore they readily utilize their material similar to animal material - in making Fi,q. 1 musical instruments. With this we have come to the section discussing materi- als which is perhaps the largest, but at the same time the most thoroughly elaborated, since wood and reed are the most widespread and most traditional materials for building musical instruments. Both are available to natural peoples in almost unlimited quantity, and their being looked upon as living beings is not of biological but, prinlarily and mainly, religious nature. It is well-known that religions of the animistic type and in this respect and in this field even the more developed religions are permeated by the thinking rooted in animism perceive a soul, even a god in every object of nature, but mainly in plants.

Karpz: Mythe as Organotogzeaa Facts 13 In order to prove this precept, I wish to introduce two fundamentally important and characteristic types from the great number of possibilities. One of them is bamboo in Chinese and Japanese traditions, the other is wood in the traditions of the Siberian peoples. The symbolism of bamboo reed is analysed in great detail by Gen'ichi Tsuge in his study mentioned above, referring to a number of myths, tradi- tions, and poems from the T'ang era, which uniformly testify to the diverse content practical and moral messages, examples, customs, healing - attached to this material in China and Japan. (Tsuge 1978: 14 16.) I only wish to add to the evidence presented by him two pieces of data which equally point to the outstanding importance of the mythical role played by bamboo. According to certain sources of Japanese mythology e.g. Nshongs-the bamboo bud is the first element of creation, from which mikoto, the god "having the shape of a man" was born (Nthongt-Aston 2- 5). The other bamboo myth or legend of fundamental importance is known to us from the Taketort monogatarz. While working, one of the bamboo cutters finds a baby girl in a bamboo cane. Ee believes her to be a human being but when she turns into a beautiful girl she turns out to be Kaguyahime, the singing girl of the sky (tennyo). The bamboo cutter, even the emperor himself wish to marry her but Eaguyahime goes back to heaven. In both cases the birth of some divine being is attached to bamboo, thus its material indicates an e2rtraordinary heavenly world, heavenly music, beauty, glamour, something unatt,ainable. Perhaps it is needless to specifically call the attention to the fact that for peoples living along the banks of rivers or seashores bamboo is as necessary for maintaining their lives as the horse is for the Mongolians, and therefore a process similar to e2rperience takes place in the myth, namely an element of the environment, seen and touched every day, of completelly everyday nature, is metamorphosed into an intellectual value by being made sacred. So the musical instrument is not made from an ordinary piece of bamboo, seen and touched every day, but from a material which is not only living but, in addition, represents some kind of heavenly- godly relationship as well. In addition to bamboo, Japanese mythology attaches a distinguished role to wood as well, since it classifies bamboo together with firtree and plum- tree among the especially important plants, indicating good luck. One of their myths describes the possibility of wood receiving an e2rceptional, directly supernatural quality. Kojtkt and Nthon,Mgt unanimously inform us about a case which took place at the time of the reign of Emperor Nintoku. Having been used for many years, a ship named Earano was no longer safe for navigation, therefore its wood was used for cooking salt. However, in a miraculous man- Studia MusicoloDtca Academiae Scien@um Hunvaricae 31, 1989</page><page sequence="10">14 J. Karpati: Mythe ce OrycFnoloyiccFl FcFcts ner, the wood refused to burn. At the instruction of the emperor, a zyther was made out of the wood; the musical instrument had such a loud sound that it could be heard at a distance of seven villages. (Eojtk- Chamberlain 1882: 355, Nthongt- Aston 1896: 169, Earich-Schneider 1973: 17.) In a similar manner, wood is an object of everyday environment, to which a great number of myths and legends are connected in the culture of a diversity of peoples all over the world. If now from among them a Siberian example is chosen, the reason for its selection is that here the diverse system of beliefs related to the material of the musical instrument, connected to each other, appears in the form of a paradigm. Referring to a number of earlier accounts and summarizing them Emsheimer investigates the traditions of the Samoied, Iakut, lhgaz and Gold peoples related to the shaman drum. Within that, he pays special atten- tion to the selection of the wood for the frame of the drum which is performed according to a specific rite. As a result of direct contact with the spirits, the shaman informs the community about which tree of the forest is to be selected. Without the shaman's personal participation, a group of five or sis men cut out the tree, paying special attention to the direction in which the tree falls. Later on the shaman himself carefully collects the shavings accumulated in felling the tree, and places them into a sack designated for the purpose. Then the wood is used for making the large ovel shape that serves as the frame of the drum, together with the handle, then the blood of the reindeer whose skin is suspended on the frame is rubbied into it, and then specific ornamental drawings and figures with magic meanings are painted on it. The wood and skin used in making the drum are called to life in a separate rite. A number of data support the view that the tree selected with such great care constitutes a part of the central symbol of the shamanistic religions, the world tree. (Emsheimer, 1946.) Other sources furnish us with data about the material necessary for the drum being taken from a tree hit by lightning, and here too the selection is performed with the assist,ance of a higher, natural power. (Schaeffner 1936.) It appears from the above highly concise description too how comples the tradition in question is, and for this very reason symbolism is far from being sufficient to characterize it. The rules of making the shaman drum, unrecorded but strictly and precisely preserved by tradition, constitute a comples texture of mythical, symbolic and ritual elements whose threads are impossible to disentangle building up a real ideology. In one form or another, almost all types of the phenomena related so far can be found in it, beginning with the living material, through the act of sacrifice, up to the mystery of resurrection.

Rarpdts: MytEw as Organoloyical PtAct8 15 To complete our train of thought discussing the mythical character and symbolism of the material of the musical instrument, let me quote a real ideology. The Chinese world view of a high logical development and nvith a strong claim for systematization, which gained a precise and comples word- ing in the great philosophical works of the Confucian classics and the literature connected with them, bases the systematlzation of musical instruments on their material. An e2rpressly scientific claim appears in these efforts since their knowledge of the natural sciences was not sufficient for creating a system guided by the principle of real acoustics. Anyway, the quality of the material is a criterion which appears to be scientific in this system, and we know only on the basis of modern research that e. g. in the case of wind instru- ments it is at times irrelevant. The Chinese system attaches decisive significance to the eight materials listed below from the point of view of making musical instruments: stone lithophone metal bell silk lute, zither bamboo flute wood tough, tiger (cultic musical instruments) skin drum gourd mouth organ earth ocarina It can be seen from this list that this system with a #cientific claim can not stand at several points, either because the musical instmment designated to a given material contains other materials too, or because some types of musical instrument cannot be fitted into this #ystem. In the case of the mouth organ, for e2rample, gourd only fulfils the role of the wind chamber holding the pipes, and it is actually the bamboo pipes which serve to produce the sollnd#. In the case of the zither, silk is really very important, being the material of the #trings, but it would be worth nothing without the resonating chamber. Animal skin is a really important element of drums, but we know from Chinese culture itself that they had drums made from bronze and wood too. Anyway, the basic principle of systematization also contains the more consistent order which hides actually three basic materials behind the eight materials, namely of animal, plant and mineral origin. Following this, the eight materials are divided as follows: animal skin, silk plant gourd, bamboo, wood mineral clay, metal, stone Studia Mu8icolosica Acaaemuse Snentiarum Hun¢avicae 31, 1989</page><page sequence="12">16 J. KarNpt: Mythe as Organotogzeat Facts The first two, which are called organic materials, to use the modern term, proved to be the vehicle of life, the soul in the course of the above reasoning, and it is primarily this quality which justified the formation of the mythical- symbolic notions attached to them. However, the minerals (inorganic mate- rials) - playing such an important role in Chinese tradition - emerge as a completely new element, at least from the point of view of our analysis. At the same time it is surprising and actually incomprehensible why bone whether of human or animal origin is missing from the list of Chinese musical instruments, whereas it is well-known to us that it was used both to foretell the future and for writing. This high culture and apparently scientific systematization cannot hide the fact that the materials of musical instruments were primarily evaluated on the basis of a mythical-cultic point of view. First of all, we have to see that the system of the eight materials is far from being the result of a materi- alistic classification with a scientific claim. Instead it is part of a large, cosmo- logical theoretical system named "pa yin", in which the materials and the individual musical instruments are arranged in harmony with the similar distribution, containing also eight classes, of the compass points, the seasons and the phenomena. (Van Aalst 1887: 47.) The figure eight, just like the figure five, fulfilled a specific role in the cosmology of the Chinese philosophy and symbolism of figures. While, on the one hand, they presumed a precise and basic connection between the five elements (earth, metal, wood, fire, water), the compass points (centre, west, east, south, north) and the five notes of music (kung, shang, chueh, chih, yu) as well as the five planets (Saturnus, Venus, Jupiter, Mars, Mercury), to mention the most important correlations, they on the other hand also created the system with eight elements which also includes those of the system of five elements, but also conceals the possibility of a wider, more comple2r world view. The figures may not be looked upon as arbitrary (whereas the different parallels and concordances do appear to be arbitrary) since the different systems of symbols are bound by mathematical logic. (Nakaseko 1957). Several references are made in literature to the mythical Emperor Fu Esi, whose name is connected with the invention of the zither with five strings, the ch'in and the eight trigrammes (pa kua signs for prediction). Although we cannot discuss the latter in detail, it must be mentioned here that these signs of predicting (three lines, permutated in unintermpted and interrupted form in eight possible cases) occupy an out- standing role in the Confucian classic entitled I Ch'ing. Even so, a cursory glance will also suffice to perceive the mathematical correlations between the system of 2 principles (Yang and Yin), that of the signs of prediction consisting of 3 lines, and that of 5-member and 8-member classifications.

Karpats: Myths as Organotogtcat Ptacts 17 II As has emerged from the above discussion, the system of meanings of the materials of musical instruments is in a sense an abstraction, since forming and transformation go hand in hand with the material in a close relationship. In this section as indicated in the introduction we shall seek an answer to the following question: what is the background and meaning of the forms of musical instruments, of their external appearances, considered for the time being completely independently of the sound, or the music they are intended to produce ? Naturally, the two functions i.e. the material and the musical ones cannot be fully separated from each other, just as the separation of the questions of material and form was artificial too; still in what follows we shall make a provisional attempt at it because only in this way can we realize a planed investigation based upon logical principles. When someone is making a tool, he tries to harmonize two aspects: on the one hand, what is offered by the material itself, on the other hand, the purpose he intends to use it for. Obviously, a man constructing a musical instrument acts according to the same viewpoints. It has already been men- tioned in relation to the utilization of bone and bamboo as materials that the hollow structure according to the earliest observations of man seemed to be suitable for producing sound. Thus in the course of moulding or trans- forming them into an instrument the first stage is when the material offered by nature needs no forming or shaping in order to make it into an instrument. Sufich an example is the wooden stick which can equally be used as a weapon and a lever. It is not a chance occurrence, however, that phallic notions were attached to this instrument, since the form lent by nature as well as the manly action it was used for carrying out themselves offered the sexual connotations. A similar process may have taken place in the case of the bone or bamboo rod given by nature which did not need much alteration in order to become a musical instrument and which, on account of its form, could easily be pro- moted to become a phallic symbol. This possibility has already been men- tioned in relation to the Tibetan bone trumpet, and as far as the different bamboo musical instruments are concerned, literature presents ample evidence of the occurrence of phallic symbols and the sexual connotations related to them. (Sachs 1940.) Among the musical instruments presented by nature in an almost ready- made state, an important place is allocated to the conch-shell trumpet, the ritual musical instrument of a number of Southern and Central Asian religions. The maker had nothing else to do but bore a hole suitable for blowing into the pointed peak or side of the shell. Sachs offers ample information about 2 Studsa Musicolosica Academiae Scientiatum Hunaarscae 31, 1989</page><page sequence="14">18 J. KarNpats: Mythe as Organologtcal Facts its occurrence and magical role. (1940: 48 50.) Here it is primarily its objec- tive symbolism which will be discussed in greater detail since this musical instrument received from nature in a ready-made state, requesting no trans- formation, carries a long series of mythical and ritual associations. As a matter of fact, it could have been touched upon as material in the previous section, but I did not do so because in its case material and the ready-made form are inseparable from each other. In its material and form, it is the symbol of its original area of life, the sea which as is well-known represents the ancient element in a number of great mythologies. Sachs points out that the connec- tion with the sea carries a linkage to the Moon, together with ebb and flow as well as female menstruation. By the way, the female symbolism is self- evident since in its original form and especially in the case of the so-called kaori shells it represents a picture of the female sexual organ. The association of the conch-shell trumpet with the sea and the moon in itself refers to a cosmic meaning. This cosmic meaning is then elaborated by Hindoo mythology in even greater detail. Let us quote one sentence from the Brahmakarma in relation to the sankhs (the Sanskrit name of the musical instrument): "At its opening the God of the Moon, Chandra, with Varuna and Pradjapatl on the side, and GEanga at the peak. Sarasvatl and all the other rivers of the three worlds in which the (ritual) washing is performed according to the law of Vasudeva." (After Locard 1884, quoted by Marcel-Dubois 1941: 8 9.) This single sentence e2rpands and extends the musical instrument to cosmic dimensions on the one hand, and comprises almost all the ritual mean- ings related to the moon, water and purification, originating from the tribal cultures, mentioned already, on the other hand. So, as we have seen, in its objective existence this musical instrument is not only a snatched-out part of nature but also its reflection, moreover in a total, even cosmic dimension. But the shell is not the only musical instru- ment of this kind. "Creation started from the drum", says the medieval Tamil poet, Unmai Vilakkam, referring to Eindoo mythology attaching such a cos- mic association to the drum as well. (Marcel-Dubois 1941: 9.) Even more characteristic and precise is the quotation below from the Tamil poet Chidam- bara Mummani Kovai since it indicates the type of the drum as well. The poem is addressed to Shiva Nataraja, Shiva, the king (raja) of dancing (nata), whose cosmic dance creating the world is represented by a number of works of art. "O my Lord, Thy hand holding the sacred drum has made and ordered the heavens and earth and other worlds and innumerable souls. Thy lifted hand protects both the conscious and unconscious order of thy creation." (Coomaraswamy 1918: 59 60.) In order to understand the quotation, we have to be familiar with the frequently recurring representation of "Shiva Studia MuncoloSica Acaaemue Scientiarum HunSaticae 31, 1989</page><page sequence="15">J. KarpFt: Mythe as Organologwcat Facts 19 nataraja" in 11 13th century Indian bronze plaetic art, where the fi&gt;re of the god is dancing in a circle of flames, and the right upper one of his four hands i8 holding a small-sized hour-glass drum, the so-called damarqb. This is what the poem refers to. Let us raise a hypothesis concerning the dcomarqb to be seen on the repre- sentations of Shiva Nataraja. The damaru or hour-glass drum depicted on the contemporary representations of Indian origin is similar both in size and binding to the drum named tsuzumi (o-tsuzumi or ko-tsuzumi) of the Japanese cradition alive today. This type of drum obviously found its way to Japan through Chinese mediation which is mainly proved by the orchestral repre- sentations of the T'ang era. The goods from India found their way to China through Turkestan (Tunhuang, Xizil, etc.), along the "Silk road", and this probably holds true for the hour-glass drum as well. At the same time it i8 conspicuous that the hour-glass drum to be seen on the representations of Shiva Nataraja differs from the Chinese-Japanese type mentioned above in two respects: it is smaller in size, for the god figure is holding it with only two fingers and the binding is missing from it. (See Fig. 2.) This version, smaller in size and without binding, is identical with the Tibetan thod-rnya made from a human skull, mentioned above in the previous section. Thus it is possible that the drum known today only in Tibet was in use in India in the 11 13th centuries too, and the cosmic notions quoted above are actually attached to this form of it. We have another piece of data related to the intertwining of creation myth and musical instruments, and from a much earlier source than those mentioned already, from the Rigveda itself. This is how one of its lines (X. 129) runs in Basham's English translation: "And they have stretched their chord across the void." (Basham 1954, quoted by Eliade 197411: 110.) Naturallys F$g. 2 St2Xduz Mqzeicoloflca Academiae Sczerltiarum LElun.lricae 31, 1SS9</page><page sequence="16">20 J. Rarpati&gt;: Mythe as OryanoloyiXcal Ptacts the line has a fairly obscure meaning just like a number of the lines of the Rigveda for the reader of today but "stretched chord" (meaning: stretched string) in itself points to the fact that a human instrument (bow or musical instrument) supplied with a string was placed in a cosmic conte2rt. The question whether we are faced with the string of a weapon or a musical instrument will remain open here, but the fact that these two objects can be close to each other in a mythical context is an important point to which we shall return in the 3rd part of our discussion. Whether a musical instrument receives a cosmic dimension or e2rpresses a cosmic relationships in its objective existence is a phenomenon which fits very well into the Chinese world picture. In the previous chapter we have already referred to the cosmic correlations of the numerically defined musical phenomena (system of notes, system of musical instruments). Now let me quote a scientific treatise on a zither-type musical instrument named ch'in from 1721. The size of the ch'in is 3 feet 6 inches and 5 tenths. It represents the 365 degrees of the heavenly sphere (sky?) and the 365 days of the year. Its width is 6 inches, representing 6 harmonies (sky, earth and the four com- pass points). It has an upper part and a lower part, symbolizing the changing breath of the Sky and the Earth. The upper part of the bottom is called lake, and the lower part of it is referred to as basin. Lake means water and water is straight. Basin represents subjugation. The two together: if the people high above are straight (just?), then the people at the bottom will be obedient. (Van Gulik 1940: 79 82.) This detail is strongly reminiscent of the Confucian way of thinking. Its starting point is of cosmic dimensions: it creates a con- nection between the cosmos and the musical instrument with the help of number symbolism. From here it slips almost unnoticed into natural sym- bolism (lake and basin), then into ethics which exemplifies the harmony of the "people high above", i.e. the emperor and his officials, and the "people low down", i.e. the subjects. Number symbolism is manifested in constructing other musical instru- ments too, and since it touches upon a significant structural question, in a manner similar to the above example, its answers the question of how the musical instrument reflects the universe expressed in numbers as well. Litera- ture discussing the Chinese musical instruments describes in an essentially uniform manner the structure of the two Confucian ceremonial musical instru- ments: the pien chung (bell-chime) and the pten ch'ing (resonating stone, lithophone). Both of them are series of tuned bronze bells and jade plates, respectively, suspended from a similar frame. Their tuning is chromatic on the basis of 1x, the basic system of Chinese music theortr, and since two series of bells and stone plates consisting of 8 members are hanging from the frame, St?sdia MusicoloSica AcaGemiae ScienUiarum Hunaaricae 31, 1989</page><page sequence="17">J. Karpatt: Myths as Organologwal Ptacts 21 the musical instrument is able to produce a scale of 16 notes beginning from the yellow bell (huuny chqbny e.g. F), proceeding by semitones. In relation to the placing of the bells two data contradictory to each other are known: According to one, in the lower line the yanS7 i.e. male-, and in the upper line the yin-i.e. female-notes are placed. This is in harmony with the generating principle of lqb. According to the second piece of data the musical instruments reconstructed today being placed in harmony with this principle the bells or stone plates placed next to one another followed each other with a semitone difference, i.e. the musical instruments was in harmony with the chromatic structure of the system of notes, proceeding by semitones. No matter how the two lines were placed, it raises the question why a culture, whose musical theory has knowledge of the 5 tone scale, 7 tone scale and 12 tone scale systems, constructs a 16 tone musical instrument whose range is thus - which seems quite illogical - a minor tenth. Our hypothetical answer to this question is that even though the development of lqb leads to 7 tone and 12 tone scale systems, in the system of Confucian symbolism-as has already been demonstrated-5 was followed by 8. Thus the two cultic musical instruments were built in a system of 8 notes, placing the two rows with 8 members one above the other. This is supported by a relatively new, sensational discovery of Chinese archeology: a huge, unbroken bell-chime has been excavated, on which the number of bells is 64, i.e. 8 to the second power. (A lecture held by Professor Du Ya2riong at the Liszt Ferenc Music Academy in Budapest in May 1988.) The question of how a musical instrument reflects nature in its form and structure following cosmic correlations must be followed by the human cor- relations if we are to proceed along a logical path. And indeed, as in selecting the material there figured the respect for the substance originating from man and its furnishing with magic features, here too we may observe the anthropo- morphic formulation of the musical instrument and its ideologization. The anthropomorphic approach is a spontaneous manifestation of human thinking which is characteristic of periods and cultures which have little to do with mythical ideology. In the nomenclature of modern and European musical instruments - especially as far as the individual parts are concerned-the metaphor of the parts of the human body is prevelant even today. Stringed instruments have a "back", "belly", "neck", and these have been incor- porated as technical terms in the professional language. We shall immediately feel the important differences in approach between this modern anthropomorphic nomenclature and mythical thinking when we have familiarized ourselves with, e.g. the myth of origin of the Arab lute. "Lamek had a son whom he loved very much. Eowever, when death snatched Studia MuswoloDica Acadeqniae ScienXiarum EunDaricae 31, 1989</page><page sequence="18">J. Karpati: Mythe as Organological Placts 22 him away, he suspended the dead body on a tree: the joints became dissected, and nothing remained of it but the thigh, the shank and the foot with the toes. Then Lamek took a piece of wood and carefully working on it, made it into a lute, forming the body of the musical instrument after the thigh, the handle after the shank and the neck after the foot. The keys imitated the toes and the strings imitated the tendons." (Rouanet 1923: 1683, quoted by Schaeffner 1936: 122.) Here, as we can see, not the denomination is essential which may differ widely from people to people and from languag;e to language but the structural similarity between the parts of the musical instrument and the parts of the human body. Let us add: similarly to the Hermes myth, this is an aitiological myth too and it was probably created when the Arab lute had an established form already. The myth of the origin of the Indian vina (stick zither) has a similar anthropomorphic tendency and an aitiological orientation. "Shiva invented the rudra-vma while watching Parvatl: the long handle of the musical instru- ment represents the pure face of his shaktl, the two gourds her beautiful forms, the ivory her breasts, the metal frets her bracelets and the sound emitted by the vina her rhythmical breathing." (After Fyzee-Rahaluin quoted by Marcel-Dubois 1941: 6 7.) Next to the similarity, however, the difference is even more significant. For in this case the actors of the myth are gods: a god creates the musical instrument and the instrument is created imitating the features of another god. A characteristic feature of Hindoo mythology is that its whole pantheon is so anthropomorphic. Thus it is actually a myth with a theomorphic intention which becomes anthropomorphic, de- picting with a charming naivity the idyllic scene between Shiva and his wife Parvatl. The other characteristic feature is that here the correlations between the musical instrulnent and the human body are far from being self-evident, an important role in the process of formulation is placed by the imagination with an erotic background, the highly emphaeized association of the woman's curves and jewels. Since in this chapter we are trying to find an answer to the question in what way nature is reflected by the ideologies related to the musical instru- ments, the investigation of the animals encountered in the human world and the way they are represented may be of decisive significance. It may be pointed out by way of a preliminary reinark that in Asian traditions myths and sym- bols representing zoomorphic notions constitute an overwhelming majority as compared to the anthropomorphic notions. In the mythologies animals play a leading role either following from their function as totemic anilnals or because they have great importance in the process of maintaining human existence. (Tsuge 1976) An important moment in the mythical animal approach Studza MusicoloDica Academzae Scientiatum EunDancae 31, 1989</page><page sequence="19">J. Rarpati: Myths as Oryanological Facts 23 of man is the fact that animals are able to exist in elements where man is unable to live: they fly in the air, submerge under the water, etc. In all prob- ability, this is where the process of the formulation of mythical animals can be traced back to; the mythical animal-to put it very concisely-is a living being different from man and bearing a greater similarity to animals which is capable of unreal, unusual existence as well. Among the mythic animals we encounter beings which are friendly to man and beings which cause harm to him. An important moment, however, is when the mythic creature with a terrifying appearance may also be friendly in its action and foster the well-being of man. At the same time it may also be observed that in the myth real, existing animals can receive roles which make them miraculous, unreal creatures too. Consequently, it is not inevitably necessary to differentiate in principle between the real and mythical animal figures as well as the good types and those causing harm to man. Therefore, in the following we shall classify the animal f-igures of different types but definitely of mythical content in the collecting notion of zoomorphic pheno- mena. Eowever, it is much more important to differentiate in respect to whether the notions of zoomorphic character permeate the musical instrument in its whole structure or whether they are present merely in the form of ornamen- tation. Structural zoomorphism has perhaps a somewhat stronger mythical- symbolic background than ornamental zoomorphisln since it strengthens the notion that the mythical creature itself has been turned into a musical instru- ment. We should add, however, that the two types may be combined with each other: think of the Mongolian musical instrument named morsn-chur presented above, where the material originating from the horse and the horse head as an ornament figure together, and the myth says outright that the horse has been transformed into the musical instrument ! An extreme case of structural zoomorphism is the Confucian ceremonial musical instrument named yqb. It is nothing less than a tiger statue made of wood, and it only becomes a musical instrument when a bamboo stick is pulled along its backbone into which teeth are cut. It holds a purely cultic function: it indicates the end of certain phases of the Confucian ceremony. Obviously, this formal function is supplemented by some content meaning too, in this respect, however, organological literature is contradictory. It is more or less clear that the tiger's counterpart in the ceremony, the trough (chu) signaling the start is an agricultural symbol. Its shape is reminiscent of the form of a gra,in mea,sure, a,nd the manner of hitting it brings to mind the breaking of seeds. On its four outer walls, symbolic drawings or ornaments, related to the four seasons, the four compass points and four mythical animals, can Studu; MuncoloDica Acadeqnuze ScienXiaruqn HunDaricae 31, 1989</page><page sequence="20">J. Karpati: Myths as Oryanological Ptacts 24 be found. Since the ritual role and symbolics of yqb are in all probability con- nected to those of chu, we consider most acceptable the view of the great German sinologist R. Wilhelm who claims that in Chinese ideology the tiger is connected to the west, sunset, harvesting and death. (Wilhelm 1927: 203.) Among them the symbolism of harvesting is very well fitted into the sacrifice programme of the Confucian rite. Others believe that the tiger as one form of appearance of the different kinds of dragons is the symbol of dignity. (Lessing 1976: 122.) The Taoist and Buddhist rituals also use a fully zoomorphic musical instrument, the wooden fish (Chinese mu y@, Japanese moku gyo). From the organological point of view, it is a small-sized, slitdrum. The fish-shape is generally abstract, stylized, but the carving of the mouth and the eyes makes it quite unmistakable. Traditionally it was used in the rituals for rain, with special regard to fish being an animal that lives in water, later, however especially in more recent Japanese Buddhist rituals - it lost this specific role and is played most of the ceremonies. According to the data of Sachs, it is frequently applied in burial ceremonies too (Sachs 1940: 175 176), and this is supported from another side by the specificity of the musical instrument that there is generally a small wooden ball in the mouth of the fish. This may be connected to an important moment of the Chinese funeral ceremony when, immediately following the occurrence of death, a coin is placed into the mouth of the deceased. (de Groot 1892-1910.) On the territory of Burma, the crocodile zither, ms-gyaung is a well-known musical instrument mrith far reaching traditions. The head of the animal is a compact realistic carving, and its stylized body is the resonating chamber with strings suspended above it. Highly interesting data about the past of this musical instrument are supplied by one of the chronicles of the T'ang dynasty which reports about the guest perforuxance of the pyu musicians (the population of the territory of Burma of today in those days) from the beginning of the 9th century. This description mentions the crocodile-shaped zither among the musical instruments described precisely and in detail. (Twitchette-Christie 1959.) By the way, this very strong preserving ability of the musical tradition of Burma is highly remarkable. In addition to the crocodile-zither, there is another musical instrument which is used today as well, representing an uninterrupted tradition of about one thousand years: the arched harp named sa?l,ng gauk which, under the name of vina, was one of the most important musical instruments of India in the 7 8th centuries, and then vanished from there completely. (Becker 1967.) The idea of the crocodile-zither is probably connected to one of the most widespread zoomorphic symbols of Eastern Asia, the dragon. The dragon as Studza Musu oloDica Acadeqniae Scientiaruqn Hunaricae 31, 1989</page><page sequence="21">J. Karpats: Mythe as Organotogtcal Facts 25 a mythical creature appears in a diversity of forms in the mythology, litera- ture, fine art and applied art, and indirectly in the music of China, Japan and the neighbouring countries. One of its most frequent forms of appearance but far from being the exclusive one is related to the water and the sea, and in such cases a dominating role is played by the elements reminiscent of water snakes or reptiles. Still, it is a fact worth pondering about that in Japanese traditions the zither with thirteen strings named koto is coupled with an ide- ology which compares the musical instrument in its wholeness to a crouching dragon and identifies it with the dragon in fantafiy. "The top surface is called a 'dragon's back' (ry?iko). The upper bridge is called a 'dragon's horn (ryu- kclkqb) and the bottom is called a 'dragon's belly' (ryufqzkqb). The right end of the koto (from the player's point of view) is referred to as a 'dragon's head' (ryuto), and inside it there is a 'dragon's tongue' (ryuzetsu). The left end is 'dragon's tail' (ry¢bt). In addition the zither possesses 'dragon's forelegs' (ryushqb or mcleclsht) and 'dragon's hind legs' (ryushz or cltoasht). The sound- holes underneath are sometimes called 'dragon's mouths' (ryukqb). Some names of other component parts also reveal symbolism of the dragon: the lower bridgeis called the 'cloud horn' (bnkslkqb). And at the top ofthe dragon's head, there is a section known as a 'sea' (bm) which is sometimes called the 'dragon's forehead' (ryugclk?b). The long sides of the zither are called the 'seashore' (tso). The top of the left end is called 'celestial seat' (Tenntnzcl)." (Tsuge 1978: 17 18.) This full structural identification is surprising and of great significance because on the musical instrument there is no imitational reference to the picture of the dragon, not even in the form of a traditionally recurring orna- mentation (which does not exclude the possibility of the appearance of such figures in the case of individual esamples on surfaces designated for ornamen- tation anyway.) This is thus a completely imaginary manifestation of zoomor- phic symbolism which documents better than any other esample the estremely strong existence and survival of mythical ideas. It is quite interesting that the musical instrument of Chinese tradition which is the counterpart of koto, the seven-stringed ch'tn which, as has already been referred to, has a widespread ideology preserved in written form too carries similar zoomorphic notions. The lower bridge on the left end of the musical instrument is called dragon-gum (lmbng-ytn) the larger sound hole on the bottom is referred to as dragon-lake (lqbny-chz). (This is the lake which has already been mentioned in another contest of the ideology related to ch'tn.) Still, in Chinese tradition we do not encounter an imaginary dragon identification so precisely elaborated in every detail as the one we have seen in the case of Japan. It is all the more conspicuous, however, that the dragon Studia Muncolosica Aciemiae Scien;iarum Hunaaricae 31, 1989</page><page sequence="22">J. Karpati: Myths as Oryanologtcal Facts  26 symbolism of ch'tn is supplemented by phoenix symbolism, i.e. within a single musical ornament the association of two different mythical creatures appears. Thus the narrow part behind the bridge is called phoenis-forehead (feng-e), and the part behind it is referred to as phoenis-tongue (feng-she) or phoenis- eye (feng-yen). Moreover, the long edges are phoenis-wings (let us bear in mind that on the ground plan of the ch'tn a narrowing down can be seen to- wards the left end which justifies the winglike notion of the side lines), and the left end is the scorched tail (chtclo-wet). (Tsuge 1978: 18.) The word phoenis is used here only because this is the only way to trans- late it into European languages, but we must know that the mythical bird in question has nothing to do with the miraculous bird of Greek mythology. Its Chinese name is feny or fony-htuany, the latter indicating the belonging together of the male and femals seses. As far as its shape is concerned, it displays the misture of a number of animals: its head is similar to a pheasant's, its beak to a swallow's, its neck to a turtle's, its body to a dragon's, its tail to a fish's. However, in its most popular form only the elements of pheasant and peacock are mised. (Lessing 1976: 118.) Its relationship to music carries an outstanding importance since in the origin myth of the Chinese tone system it is its sound which determines the liz, i.e. the czrcle of the tuning pipes con- sisting of 12 bamboos. It is probably not a chance occurrence that Chinese mythology associates the phoenis with the bamboo pipes in other cases too. According to tradition, Emperor Nyu-kwa who lived in the third millennium B.C. created the musical instrument named sheng, i.e. the mouth organ to the similarity of the phoenix. This origin myth has a fairly scarce documentation but it is widely believed even today and this holds true for Japanese tradition as well that the symmetrical arrangement of the slim bamboo pipes of the mouth organ fol- lows the line of the wings of the phoenix. Therefore in this respect both the ch'tn and the sheng are equally characterized by a fairly abstract zoomorphic structure. So far we have presented the esamples where the zoomorphic character, the mythic afisociation are manifested in the structure of the musical instru- ment too. Now let us turn our attention to the mythical associations mani- fested in the ornamentation of the musical instruments. Needless to say the ornamentation of nlusical instruments is a vast and far-reaching topic. Since making musical instruments belongs to the scope of applied art, by way of individual solutions every piece represents an individual case, even though certain traditions survive in a highly stubborn manner and exert their influence on the different schools and among theln too. In our discussion we can onlsr focus on some phenomena of ornamentation whose traditional character Stuaia M?sswoloSica Academiae Scientiar?sm H?snsaricae 31, 1989</page><page sequence="23">J. KarLpati: Myths as Organological Facts 27 breaks through the freedom of individual solutions and are present in a11 the pieces of the type with an almost obligatory validity. Speaking about structural zoomorphy, we pointed out that it realizes the organological reflection of the mythical world view at a very high level since it almost identifies the musical instrument with the natural or mythical creature. This holds true to a lesser estent for ornamental zoomorphy since here the image of the animal or mythical creature does not constitute an integral part of the musical instrument, it is only an ornament, an addition. However, a11 this expresses a relative value system only since in several cases the ornament too becomes an integral part of the musical instrument, appear- ing in it or on it traditionally and with an almost obligatory validity. Let us think again of the example of the morin-chqzr quoted above several times. The horse head as a carving is an ornament but it expresses an essential, integral relationship, more and more important than, for esample, the arbi- trary lion head figuring in the place of the scroll of European string instru- ments. In Chinese and Japanese culture there are musical instruments which cannot simply be imagined without ornamentation. The so-called yang-ytn motive, representing the male and female principles in each other is a recur- rent, almost compulsory ornament of the membrane of drums. At the 3ame time on the frames used for suspending the drums especially on the huge Japanese dc^-dc^zko there figures the picture of the dragon and the phoenizr, with a similar compulsory validity. These two mythical creatures form a tradi- tional pair, in which the dragon is the symbol of the yang principle and the emperor, while the phoenis is the symbol of the yin principle and the empress. (Lessing 1976: 118.) :Efowever, the pairs consisting of two different creatures are organized into pairs a# the potential of representation and the traditions require symmetry, i.e. two dragons can be seen on the left side and two phoenises on the right side on the ornamented supporting frame of the two giant drums of the d-datko (for example, in the Music Hall of the Imperial Palace in Tokyo). Traditional ornamentation of a mythical character can be found on the bell-chime and the stone-chime the two most important musical instruments of the Confucian ceremony, too. The ornamentation of the bronze bells, just like that of a11 the other cultic bronze objects, leads back to the oldest period of Chinese history which can be traced back to the time of the Shang and Chou dynasties. It is to this period that we can trace back the traditional ornamentation which appears consistently on the bells-both on the separate larger pieces and on the individual pieces of the bell-chime. On the two sides of the bronze bell mostly with an oval cross section, in the upper part, 9 bulges Studuz Mu8icolovica Acodemwse Scxentw;tum Hunaaricae 31, 1989</page><page sequence="24">28 J. Karpati: Myths as Oryanoloyical Facts can be found in each of four fields more or less identical in size. A number of experts suggest that they are anthropomorphic fertility symbols and they actually represent women's breasts. (Moule 1908: 54, Courant 1913: 143, Sachs 1929: 167.) The wooden frames of the bell-chime and the stone-chime also offer potentials for traditional ornamentation: the two legs of the frame are placed on turtles or dragons with lion bodies, while on the two upper corners of the frame two dragon heads of the reptile type look in opposite directions. (See Fig. 3.) It seems that in the ornamental tradition of musical instruments with frames there are correlations among Eastern, Southern and South-Eastern Asia. For the frames of the Gamelan orchestra of South-Eastern Asia display a number of similarities to those of the musical instruments of China in the Confucian period, insofar as the anilnal figures appear at the same structural F$g. 3 Studia Musicoloaica Acaaemiae Scientiarum Hunaaticae 3], ]989</page><page sequence="25">J. Karpati: Mythe as Organological Facts 29 points and their mythical nature is essentially similar too. The South-Asian cultures also have their own dragon figure but it was primarily influenced by the Indian culture. That is why we find on the Khmer, Burman, Thai and Javan drum suspenders, frames of musical instruments characteristic naga snakes and xnakara monsters of Indian origin. Moreover, it may also be ob- served in individual cases that the stick carrying the drum itself is in the shape of a nxga representation. This stick, which in fantasy is identified with the mythical naya snake, ensures the connection between heavenly and earthly music, i.e. the music of the gods finds its way to the people through the naya snake, according to the Hindoo tradition. (Marcel-Dubois 1941: 134- 135.) III The answer to our third question who used the musical instrument and for what-is seemingly simple, for it is more or less carried by the instru- ment character of the object too. However, our investigation is directed at the phenomena hiding in the background which constitute the unrecorded background of everyday actions preserved only in traditions, myths, customs. Thus an answer like the musical instrument "was used by lnusicians to pro- duce music" can hardly satisfy us. Moreover, it may also be said that this answer is not only oversimplifying but at the same time mistaken too since it was the investigation of myths which itself demonstrated that in certain cases musical instruments are used not by xntbsicians and not in order to prodtbce tmqbstc. The musical instrument and this is equally testified by the different mythologies is primarily a godly attribute, the sign and symbol of a god, the inevitable concomitant of his representation, which in its easily recognized objective e2istence is able to express a great many things of the god's essence and role. It must be added immediately that this meaning is not known or deducible in every case, and is not e2mpressly clear in every case either. In her book Claudie Marcel-Dubois devotes a whole chapter to the musical attributes of the Indian gods (Marcel-Dubois 1941: 109 119), and here, after quoting the system of classification set up by the classics of Hindoo and Buddhist iconographical literature, she reveals that it is far from being firm and irrefutable. Naturally, the comple2ity of the quefition is increaeed by the fact that the types of gods themselves are frequently each other's versions, moreover that the se2oual connotation is not always unambiguous either. Still it is clearly outlined that certain musical instruments fulfil an accom- panying or secondary function, related to the representation of accompanying Studia M?ssicoloica AcadLemuze Scientuxrum Hunaaricae 31, 1989</page><page sequence="26">30 J. Karpati: Mythe as Organological Facts or secondary gods (e.g. cymbals, drums), while other instruments, connected to the main god, occupy a central role (e.g. damartb, vina, flute). This may also reflect a real musicalfunction too, since we lmow from musical practice that while the vina and the flute play a leading, solistic role, the drum or the cymbal furnishes the rhythmic background of music. However, we also have to see that the symbolic function may be influenced by other factors outside music as well. There is, for example, the small daxnartb dmm which has already been mentioned in another respect. Concerning its material and form, the musical instrument constitutes a ritual and mythical background. Its cosmic meaning has already been mentioned in respect to Shiva's dance creating the world. Well, this characteristically secondary, small musical instmment for accompanying, has gained a cosmic significance in the hand of Shiva, as Shiva's attribute. This is perhaps the best example among all that it is the god which grants the rank to the musical instrument, and the quality of the muslcal instrument itself becomes negligible. We must not forget that in Shiva's cosmic dance creating the world the greatest importance is attached to movement: the raising of the feet and the snake-like motion of the two pairs of arms. Any kind of larger musical instrument would only hinder the representation of this movement. It is almost a must that the attribute be a small-sized drum which is nearly hidden in one of the hands but, on account of its basic nature, it represents rhythm, i.e. the most important means, condi- tion and correlation of movement. In other words, here the musical instrument is simultaneously concrete and abstract originating from real practice but at the same time fulfilling an exceptionally symbolic function. Marcel-Dubois demonstrates that the use of the name of vtna is not con- sistent since this name was attached to different musical instruments in different periods and in different places like the stick zither, the arched harp and the lute. If this is so complicated at the organological level, it is, naturally, even more complicated when it goes hand in hand with mytho- logical connotations. Anyway, Marcel-Dubois (1941: 72 87) reveals an in- ternal chronology by defining a certain subsequent order of the three types of musical instruments, and suggests that iconography reflects the practice of the musical instruments in a belated manner, i.e. it almost always records an earlier stage. Let us add that this is almost inevitable since mythological representation always considers the traditional, the older to be the acceptable fact and yardstick. Among the three types of vina, however, in :H:indoo culture it is definitely the musical instrument having the shape of a stick zither which is the most important, and it is probably not a chance occurrence that this type is related to the figure of Sarasvatl. Its female connotation has already been mentioned Studia Musicolovtca Academiae Scientiatum Hunvaticae 31, 1989</page><page sequence="27">J. Karpt: Mythe as Organologtcal Facts 31 when discussing the anthropomorphic phenomena, true, in connection with Parvatl. However, while there only certain external features futnished the basis for anthropomorphic symbolism, in the case of Sarasvatl we are faced with something else too: she is the goddess of art, literature and eloquence, and thus by her very nature she is closely linked to music. It is highly charac- teristic that in this case the instrument becoming a symbol is not a percussion instrument but a melody instrument whose playing can be coupled with a text, i.e. poetry as well. Perhaps the most significant and best-known musical attribute of the Indian pantheon is the cross flute, connected to the figure of Krishrla in an almost inseparable manner. Krishna is Vishnu's eighth incarnation (avatar), a kind of shepherd god in whose hands the simple shepherd's musical instru- ment, the flute made from bamboo fits in a highly natural way. The musical instrument as a phallic symbol emphasizes the manly character of the god or demigod too. A number of mythical episodes testify to the magic power of the musical instrument which gathers around Krishna the female actors of the shepherd's idyllic scene, the cowgirls (yopts) and the most attractive one among them: Radha. An excerpt from the BhagavataPurana confers an even greater, almost supernatural power on Krishna's flute. "Having heard the flute's sound, the cows stopped grazing: the calves, with an expression of content on their faces, forgot their duty to suck and stood motionless in the stalls: the gazelles and the other animals of the forest listened with their heads high, and these sweet tunes disturbed the privacy of the ascetics and the wise. It disarmed the demons concocting insidious plans: the rivers curled up like snakes and stopped flowing. The birds, diverted from their course alighted above Krishna's head and listened to the flute's sound with their eyes closed, jealously. The lifeless objects (minerals) shone even more brightly in the sun: and the living and moving creatures of different shapes petrified into statues." (On the basis of Pavie's French translation.) This quotation also points out that, in addition to being an attribute to god, the musical instrument possesses a magic influence and magic abilities too. What is important here is, obviously, not the influence of the musical instrument in itself but also in whose hands it is. An infinite number of other examples could be listed from the different mythologies to prove that the player and the playing, the person and the musical instrument, the subject and the object merge in forming the mythologem. H:owever, attachment to the figure of a god does not in itself furnish the musical instrument with a magic influence, it is necessary that an individual, sovereign tradition be connected to the musical instrument. This tradition may be the result of the mere observation of nature, e.g. the physiological effect exerted on animals Studia Muacolovioa Academuze Scientiarum Ilunaari,cae 31, 1989</page><page sequence="28">32 J. Karpatt: Mythe as Organologtcal Facts by a certain sound. However, this tradition may be more "arbitrary" or "mystical" when it cannot be accounted for by an ordinary physiological or psychological moment. We can really understand the ritual significance of sound or rather musical sound if we take into account that man has utilized it beginning from the earliest societies and in them to the greatest extent - for the purpose of communicating with invisible persons, i.e. the gods. In this form of com- munication, a greater role may be allocated to the message superseding the intellect and rationality than to the speech of meaningful content. "Better", more functional, are the ditty, the non-verbal song and, primarily, the "pure" sound produced by the musical instrument. The latter has a property which supports non-verbal communication even more: an "existence" which is purely intellectual since it extsts and still it is tnvisible. In a context like this we can better understand why idiophonic percussion instruments like the bell, the cymbal the temple block have a distinguished role in rituals. For here the simple observer does not see or experience any kind of vibration of strings or mem- brane, thus the sound itself appears in its most mysterious immateriality. Perhaps the richest arsenal of idiophonic percussion instruments is lined up by the Chinese Confucian ceremony in which-as has already been referred to in other respects leading roles were played by resonating stones (litho- phone, ch'tny), the bronze bells (ch'uny) and the ritual lnusical instruments made from wood (chu trough, yu tiger). Their use was prescribed by very precisely elaborated ceremonial books, never on the baJsis of musical, but pri- marily and exceptionally ritual requirements. As the arrangement of the mllsi- cal instruments was defined by the four compass points, their sounding was arranged in the coordinate of time, thereby indicating certain outstanding points of the ceremony: its beginning, and its end, Therefore sounding the musical instrurrAents did not require a special musical talent, the musicians were officials rather than artistls, and they received their posts by way of in- heritance rather than through abilities. We know from one of Eckardt's writ- ings that the Korean Confucian musicians used for years a bell-chime from which some bells had been suspended in the wrong order by accident. The musi- cian official failed to notice this and consistantly hit the bell defined by its pZace instead of the bell required by the musical process. (Eckardt 1930.) The idiophonic percussion instruments play an important role in the Chi- nese and Japanese Buddhist ceremony too. Here next to the big bells standing by themselves we mainly find gongs and slit-drums producing a very special sound. Among the latter an outstanding importance is attached to the qnt6 y mok¢ yyo (wooden fish), mentioned earlier in some other respect, which prod- uces a beautiful resonating sound in contrast to the Confucian wooden musical Studta Musicolovica Academae ScienXzarum Hunvaricae 31, 1989</page><page sequence="29">J. Karpatt: Mythe as Organologtcal Facts 33 instruments and which has been introduced to the arsenal of western music under the name of "temple block". Another characteristic Buddhist musical instrument is the cup made from bronze in different sizes (Chinese shqbn, Japanese ktn) which, similarly to the wooden fish, is used placed on a silk cushion, exceptionally in ritual functions. So far in our dis;cussion we have been proceeding "backwards" merely from the point of view of history or theory of religions, for at first we examined the mythology of the developed great religions and then their rituals. Con- tinuing in this inverse direction, we arrive at the animist, magic religious beliefs of certain primitive peoples in which the musical instrument as a magic means is present almost everywhere. One of the most characteristic utilizations beyond music is related to the shaman drum of the Siberian peoples. The first investigations emphasized the musical function of the drum, taking the starting point that the sound of the drum accompanying the activities of the shaman strengthens the exciting effect leading to extasy. Recent research, however, calls the attention to the shaman drum fulfilling a function much more complex than that. It is known, for example, that in shamanistic ideology the drum at the same time symbolizes a mountain or an elevated point, ascending on which the shaman possesses greater perspectives, thus it is, as it were, an instru- ment of "journey in the air". In a similar manner, another symbolic feature of the drum is related to changing location, according to which it can also be identified with a horse. Finally, Emsheimer called the attention to the shaman drum replacing the bow used as an instrument in war, being identified with it in fantasy by certain peoples of Siberia and Lappland. Its meaning is more or less obvious since compared to other ethnological data, the bow primarily holds an apotropaic function, i.e. it serves protection from the demons doing harm to man. (Emsheimer 1944.) This piece of data calls the attention to highly important connections. We know from Eta Harich-Schneider that in ancient Japan it had been cus- tomary up to the Heian age for the guards of the emperor to pluck the strings of the bows. This was called mez-yen, i.e. "singing strings" (Harich-Schneider 1973: 17). Then the author adds: this is practised as secret exorcism in Izumo even in our days. On the basis of all that it is quite probable that the e mperor's guards plucked the strings of their bows for a similarly magic, apotropaic purpose and not in order to testify to their presence. By the way, the bow was closely linked to the shamanistic activities in Japan too. Otto Karow suggests that the string of the bow, i.e. a musical instrument with one string, called meigen was plucked when the emperor was ill or when a child of the emperor was being born, expressly with the aim of chasing away the harmful spirits. The magical role of the bow is demonstrated by its having been the profes- 3 Studia Musscolo Academiae Scientiarum Hunaaricae 31, 1989</page><page sequence="30">34 J. Karpati: Mythe as Organological Facts sional emblem of a doctor (healing shaman) in ancient Japan (Karow 1942: 20.). The metgen was also connected to the activities of shamanesses in addition to the emperial guards and the doctor-shaman. Pictorial documentation is provided by a folio which, dating back to the Kempo age (1213 19), but copied in 1774, contains drawings of different Japanese artisanships and, in addition to the smith, sword-maker, weaver and potter, presents a mtkawnko (shamaness) playing the bow.

To prove this, Otto Karow quotes Kamo no Chomei, one of the most sipficant shinto authors of the Kamakura era (died in 1216) who writes in the Mumyosh,o the following: "As far as the origin of the yarnato koto is concerned, the strings of six bows were plucked and this was used for the kcgura, since, however, this was not easy to handle, later generations transformed it into koto." (Karow 1942: 21.) On the basis of a11 that it is probable that the yamato koto (wayon) is from among the oldest Japanese musical instruments, where the adjective yarnato obviously served the purpose of differentiation from the T'any koto. According to the oldest sources, the yamato koto was the musical instrument of the shama- ness (mtko, kam?nayz) in the shinto cult, e.g. the ks ras who sat in a cul- Studu Muswolowa Academue Scienurq6m Gq6nvaricae 31, 1989</page><page sequence="31">J.

Ptig. 5 The history of musical instruments is familiar with several examples of the use of bows placed ne2rt to each other but their strings pulled differently as a musical instrument. (Schaeffner 1936: 185 190. See Fig. 5.) However, the condition of its being transformed into a real musical instzment was the appearance of a properly formulated resonating chamber. This is the point where the question mark remains, namely whether the transformation of the bow producing music into the zither occured within the framework of an indi- vidual Japanese development or with the utilization of the pattern of the Chinese ch'tn. 3* Stq6dwx Mq6s?colo?ca Academiae Scientiarq6m Hq6nvaricae 31, 1989</page><page sequence="32">36 J. Kcirpcit?/: Myths as Organologtcal Facts No matter how it happened, for us the fact of the process is essential. And with this we have actually arrived at the end of our train of thought, the last stage of the discussion, in which we ought to examine how the different magic-ritual instruinents prepared with the aiIn of producing music became the means for activities including an aesthetical element too, i.e. real musical instruments. However, this is a huge and far-reaching question which can only be answered by a whole history of musical in,struments, kind of work like the classic one by Andlre Schaeffner not surpassed even today (Schaeffner 1936). If we now attempt to reword the theoretical system which we developed further on the basis of the study of Professor Tsuge, the mythological, sylxbolic and ritual traditions of musical instruments can be classified as follows: I The beliefs, myths and ideologies related to the material of the musical instrument. (What material is it made from ? ) nzaterials of human origin (bone, skin) nlaterials of animal origin (bone, skin, hair) materials of plants materials of minerals II The myths, symbols and ideologies related to the construction and external appearance of the musical instrument.
