Encountering the Holy Land in Nineteenth-Century American Art and Culture Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1996. 264 pp.; 7 color ills., 100 b/w. $65.00 John Davis has marked as his territory that place where the real-the empirical actuality of rock-meets the conceptual-the amor- phous realm of belief-and he has bridged it magnificently. The Landscape ofBelief. Encounter- ing the Holy Land in Nineteenth-Century American Art and Culture is a welcome addition to those recent studies which analyze how articles of faith and religious habits of mind (often inextricable from political and social credos) find visual expression in 19th-century Euro- pean and American culture.1 The Landscape of Belief places us squarely in the world of the mid-19th-century, pre-Darwin- ian, Anglo-American Protestant devout, where science worked as handmaid to faith. The physical reality of Palestine and Syria offered American archaeologists, ministers, and tour- ists seemingly incontestable evidence of the existence of the sacred and the truth of biblical history. Artists, too, were drawn to the Holy Land, and, like geographers bearing witness to the ineffable, constructed images out of their experiences and their notions of individual and national faith. What beliefs underpinned Protestant-Ameri- can awareness of the places of biblical history? What conceptions of the Holy Land did Ameri- cans bring with them, either as visitors to the actual sites or as vicarious tourists through text and image? What were "the seminal questions [about] faith, nature, and national destiny ... that framed [their] experiences" (p. 3)? These are the issues that structure Davis's analysis. Whatever range of meanings various individuals and groups found in the idea of the Holy Land, he emphasizes, "the important point to recognize ... was that it could mean something to almost anyone" (p. 53). Davis suggests that images of the Holy Land enjoyed a universal appeal and malleability of meaning not shared by depictions of the American landscape. (See, in particular, his discussion of the positive reception of Edward Troye's paintings in both the North and the Deep South [p. 134].) Such questions of sectionalism and regionalism and the problem- atics of a "national" landscape are issues of current interest to historians of American art, as Davis recognizes in his citations of Angela Miller's Empire of the Eye.2 The universal appeal of the Holy Land as symbol and metaphor, engaging individuals of varying classes, re- gions, and denominations, was based, Davis argues, on Protestant-American identification of themselves and their land as the new Israel.3 As citizens of God's chosen nation, they felt themselves to possess a unique rela- tionship to the land of the first chosen people. And, as self-anointed carriers of apocalyptic mission, they were drawn to the physical sites of prophecy and revelation in a search for authentication, both of their holy book and their national destiny. It was primarily through the "vehicle of landscape," Davis claims, that Americans ex- pressed their conception of a special relation- ship to the people and events of the Bible,just as they used landscape to "foster and shore up" other national myths (p. 4). The Landscape of Beliefjoins Katherine Manthorne's Tropical Renaissance in its exploration of the ideologi- cal and religious underpinnings of American landscape imagery beyond national borders.4 To Davis, 19th-century American images of the Holy Land (like other Western manifesta- tions of Orientalism) are not about the reali- ties of contemporary Palestine or Syria-they are not about the foreign land at all. The experience of travel and of sight were so shaped by the traveler's "perception of self" that, according to Davis, "the Holy Land went through a process of localization and became American" (p. 5). Analyzing the dynamics of this process is one of Davis's great strengths and he forcefully demonstrates its workings through letters, books, travel experiences, colonization efforts, panoramic and easel paintings, photographs, three-dimensional models, and pageants. The Landscape of Belief is divided into two parts, the first a more general analysis of the idea of the Holy Land in 19th-century Ameri- can culture and its expression in visual form, and the second a series of "case studies" treating four easel painters who, from the 1840s through the 1870s, visited the Holy Land and painted images of it for American audiences. Since the easel paintings discussed in part 2 are clearly the focus of the book, it is worth considering the wisdom of such interest when, as Davis reports, "fewer than two dozen [American] artists are documented travelers to Palestine and Sinai" (p. 27). Is it merely an interesting art historical exercise to resusci- tate the careers of such little known artists as Miner Kellogg, Edward Troye, and James Fairman? (Numerous books, catalogues, and articles about Frederic Edwin Church attest to his continued reputation as a seminal 19th- century American artist.) Davis's decision to focus on a small episode in American art, and then on an even smaller group of its practitioners, is, I believe, a sign of a broadening rather than collapsing vision in the history of American art. This concen- trated and close look at the ostensibly "periph- eral" reminds us of the dangers of such positioning. After all, Davis tells us that Fair- man, not Church, was the foremost American painter of Jerusalem in the 1870s. Further- more, like Fairman, most painters of the Holy Land exhibited and sold their works outside the northeastern art establishment. Davis has judiciously selected a particularly instructive example with which to study the dynamics of patronage, exhibition, and sale independent of the well-known but quite narrow institu- tional art world. We cannot hope to take in and master the complexity of American visual culture with a sweeping panoramic gaze. We need to look</page><page sequence="2">closely at its textured terrain, preferably with the help of a knowledgeable and sensitive guide. Davis is such a guide, and his Landscape of Belief deepens our understanding of the spiritual, social, economic, and political func- tions of landscape painting in America. It engages such important issues as the relation- ship between science and faith, the signifi- cance and variety of apocalyptic rhetoric and belief, the dynamic relationship of cultural "high" and "low," and the specifics of produc- tion and consumption in 19th- century Ameri- can art. In addition, with its inclusion of representational systems like mapping, pho- tography, and three-dimensional modeling, this book illustrates how a broadened ap- proach to visual culture can enrich the inter- pretive possibilities of art history and, in fact, redefine them. The first four chapters in Landscape of Belief are far more than mere introduction, signifi- cant only as a means to "explain" the paint- ings in part 2. Chapter 1 provides an overview of the growth and development of the con- cept of American identification with the Holy Land from its Puritan roots through the Revolutionary period into the middle of the 19th century. A significant aspect of Davis's analysis is his emphasis on the affective nature of this identification. He discusses how, through experiences of school, church, and family, the places of the Bible-Sinai, Jerusa- lem, Bethlehem-became part of the Protes- tant child's emotional world and imbued with nostalgia for many Protestant adults. The past-biblical and personal-merged with the present in the idea of the Holy Land. Such strong ties of sentiment, Davis argues, cer- tainly strengthened the power of the Holy Land metaphor and conditioned both the American traveler's encounter with the actual place and the American viewer's reaction to its representation. In this chapter, Davis also treats the inter- twining of history and national destiny so fundamental to America's apocalyptic vision, and he examines the political and social implications of the idea of election central to the Holy Land metaphor.5 Ministers in power- ful, established denominations could and did predicate one's love of country on one's love of Jerusalem-only true believers could be true patriots. One's enemies-either sectar- ian or political-were placed outside the pa- rameters of election, and thus made to stand in the way ofAmerica's millennial fulfillment, rhetoric that, Davis tells us, became more heated and urgent just before and during the Civil War. But Davis makes an even more significant point. While recognizing the exclu- sionary uses to which dominant groups could put biblical and Holy Land metaphors, he underscores the flexibility and appeal of such rhetoric to other, marginalized groups in 19th-century American society, particularly Mormons and African Americans. Here, Davis is sensitive to the diversity of people who participated in the construction and transmis- sion of Holy Land imagery (verbal and visual) even while focusing on the Northeastern middle-class Protestants responsible for the majority of its depictions. Most 19th-century Americans, of course, never actually visited the eastern places that held for them such emotional and intellectual power. But many did seek out texts and images produced by those who had in fact made the arduousjourney. In chapter 2, Davis discusses the motives and experiences of American travelers to Palestine and Syria and their relationship to audiences at home. He does not yet separate artists from the broader stream of American visitors to the Holy Land since their numbers were statistically very small and their reasons for travel so similar to those of nonartists. Davis traces American presence in the Holy Land from the first missionaries of the early 19th century through the influx of American tourists immediately after the Civil War. He also discusses American colonization schemes in the Holy Land and links their appearance in the middle decades of the century to a series of religious developments in the United States. In particular, apocalyptic expectation and anxiety as manifest in such groups as the Millerites refocused attention on biblical prophecy and the significance of the Holy Land to American destiny; the conversion of the Jews and their return to the Holy Land became for some a millennial necessity. These colonies also demonstrate, Davis asserts, an American desire to inherit "their" land-- analogous to the imperialist adventures, also perched on biblical foundations, undertaken in the American West. By the beginning of the 1840s, Davis re- ports, a new era of American interest in the Holy Land had been inaugurated, primarily through the appearance of books that estab- lished Holy Land travel and study as, at least to Americans, a particularly American enter- prise, with greater interest and higher stakes for them than for any other group. Such travel books proliferated in the 1850s and 1860s and, Davis argues, were the most signifi- cant factor in the construction of a main- stream Protestant American understanding of the "real" Holy Land. Whatever their differ- ences in approach, whatever their level of piety, all of these accounts, Davis emphasizes, made claims of accuracy and authenticity. Indeed, panoramists and easel painters often recognized the primacy of the text in their audience's understanding of the Holy Land and solicited testimonials about the "truth" of their images from published travelers. In the next two chapters, Davis examines the images and objects which made visible American ideas of the Holy Land and influ- enced or paralleled compositional and exhibi- tion strategies utilized by the painters dis- cussed in part 2. Because panorama painting was able to "cut across boundaries of class and education," Davis identifies it as among the most important means by which early 19th- century entrepreneurs brought the visual ex- perience of the Holy Land to an eager Ameri- can public (p. 63). The success of Holy Land panoramas in 19th-century America, Davis argues, rested primarily on two factors. Americans were already conceptually familiar with the Holy Land and welcomed an experience that could, through sensory rather than intellectual means, add to their perceived understanding of the place. In addition, panoramas joined popular appeal and accessibility through their reportorial naturalism and elaborate packag- ing-i.e., accompanying lectures, printed an- notated keys, and explanatory pamphlets with testimonials-with high-art pretensions to moral didacticism and enlightenment. Davis's discussion is one of a number of recent treatments of panoramic vision and its implications in American art, an interest that can be explained in part by the growing concern of art historians with the creation and definition of popular culture and its reciprocal relationship to high art, and by the issues of representation and ideology, particu- larly those of control and mastery, that the panoramic mode raises.6 Such questions of visual will and submission are also engaged in Davis's analysis of easel paintings, as we shall see. I was a little troubled by Davis's apparent dismissal as conceptually insignificant of those BOOK REVIEWS 553 1. See, for example, Michael Paul Driskel, Represent- ing Belief.

Davis, as an art historian, quite clearly begins and ends his study with American easel paintings of the Holy Land. Since the makers of and the audi- ences for these paintings were overwhelmingly Prot- estant, Protestant beliefs remain his focus. Davis understandably does not consider, for example, 19th-century Catholic,Jewish, or Islamic understand- ings of the Holy Land; his is not an exhaustive cultural history of the phenomenon but a discus- sion whose primary purpose is to provide context for a particular group of paintings. 4.

Miller, in Empzre of the Eye, examines the importance of apocalyptic belief in American land- scape painting.

He as- serts that "although they were never overly enthusiastic about figural religious paintings, Americans of the early nineteenth century did show an occasional interest in single exhibitions of monumental canvases with bib- lical subjects" (p. 56). But the number of such images that Davis lists-and he admits this list is not exhaustive-suggests that American interest was far from unenthusiastic or occa- sional. Indeed, he reports that "these di- oramic paintings nevertheless remained a part of American popular imagery for many years to come" (p. 56). The implication seems to be that such images were interesting enough to maintain a place in American consciousness even though they held no real meaning for the culture that supported them. Like many scholars of mid-19th-century American art, Davis posits landscape represen- tation as the primary visual carrier and cre- ator of meaning in American culture. Cer- tainly, such imagery was ubiquitous and its significance undeniable. But I question Dav- is's assertion that "it was popularly believed that figural scenes, even if taken from the scripture, would not be tolerated by the mar- ket" (p. 4) in light of the many images of biblical characters and narratives that ap- peared in gift books and annuals, as well as the number of large religious compositions that did find favor with the American public. Thomas P. Rossiter's Three Scriptural Paintings, for example, toured the country in the 1850s and 1860s, and a panorama depicting Old and New Testament scenes from the parting of the Red Sea to the Transfiguration of Christ was exhibited in Louisville in the 1840s. Since the panorama and all three of Rossiter's enormous paintings are now lost, their signifi- cance, and the significance of similarly absent biblical narratives, has faded from our histori- cal consciousness. I am not suggesting that Davis should have given such figural images a central place in his carefully and clearly structured study of Holy Land imagery. Rather, he might have consid- ered the conceptual and emotional relation- ship that certainly must have existed in the minds of contemporary Americans between images that re-created biblical characters and narratives and those landscapes depicting the ostensible sites where such people and events had lived. The panoramic landscapes that Davis emphasizes provided a stage on which viewers could imaginatively re-create the bibli- cal narratives they knew so well and which they had seen reenacted on the pages of gift books or the walls of exhibition halls. The figural narrative, not the contemporary land- scape (however holy), offered its viewers emo- tionally engaging models of individual piety and examples of God's omnipotence. Might not figural images, then, have had a function as significant as, and in fact symbiotic with, landscape imagery? In chapter 4, Davis turns from panorama painting to photography as the most signifi- cant purveyor of Holy Land imagery after the Civil War. Here, as elsewhere, he subjects his visual material to meticulous, thoughtful analy- sis, presented in beautifully crafted and dy- namic prose. Davis points out the prominent role that stereo photographs played in per- petuating images of the Holy Land into the late 19th century. Given the public's desire for a reassuring sense of actuality and authentic- ity, the stereograph with its photographic "truth" and its ability to reproduce the illu- sion of three-dimensional space was naturally appealing. Photography joined text in the illustrated books that proliferated during the late 19th century. Davis identifies Earthly Footsteps of the Man of Galilee (1894) with essays by two promi- nent Protestant clergymen and photographs by Robert E. M. Bain as a particularly notewor- thy example in content and scope. With it he continues his investigation of the use of an expansive vision in constructions of the Holy Land, which has implications in his later analysis of paintings. Bain's photographs em- phasize a "sense of possibility and possession through open, panoramic views that yield to the camera lens" (p. 78). Davis goes further and posits the possibility of reading the Pales- tinian landscape presented in such photo- graphs as feminized-a passive subject, "con- sistently portrayed as receptive to, even caressive of, the active, probing gaze of the viewer" (p. 87). Davis recognizes the undevel- oped nature of this analysis and suggests it as a topic worthy of further exploration. Issues of gendering do appear elsewhere in the book- especially in a fascinating interpretation of Church's El Khasne, Petra (1874)-but are clearly not Davis's primary concern. Greater attention to such analysis might have added even more depth to what is already a richly layered study. In his discussion of Bain's photographs, Davis considers the place of the human fig- ure-particularly that of the indigenous Arab-in Palestinian and Syrian landscapes produced by Americans, and he subjects it to a well-developed and convincing Orientalist critique. (Davis also devotes considerable at- tention to this issue in his chapters on the painters Fairman and Church.) According to Davis, the people of the Holy Land were "the most obvious threat to its possession by Chris- tian civilization" (p. 88). Visiting Americans looking for confirmation of biblical faith and national destiny had difficulty situating these contemporary inhabitants in a supposedly timeless land. To Davis, their treatment in Bain's photographs clearly exposes the ideo- logical underpinnings of Holy Land imagery. If indigenous residents seemed to demon- strate an unchanging biblical way of life-as shepherds, for example-they were allowed into images as "natural" confirmation of the land's timelessness (pp. 83-84). But some of Bain's photographs contain figures that obvi- ously disrupt rather than support this fantasy. According to Davis, they are subjected to condescending remarks in the photograph's caption or, conversely, are left out of the accompanying text and are thus rendered invisible. Davis's sensitive interpretation of these photographs is enriched by his analysis of the problematic place modern inhabitants of the Holy Land held for Americans, al- though I question whether people deliber- ately included in a photograph can ever-by design or oversight-be rendered truly invis- ible. Davis ends chapter 4 with a fascinating discussion of what is perhaps the most elo- quent example of Protestant American desire to both possess and be absorbed by the Holy Land. On the grounds of the Chatauqua Assembly in western New York, a landscaping and construction project begun in the sum- mer of 1874 resulted in "Palestine Park"-a physical, miniaturized re-creation on Ameri- can soil of the most significant features of the Holy Land (pp. 89-90). Here, Americans could make daily pilgrimages to the revered terrain without confronting the realities of travel or the disquieting presence of modern Arabs andJews-a carefully controlled Disney- land for the soul. And to make the experience more compelling, some visitors to Palestine Park dressed in "Oriental" garb-as people of the Bible, not modern Palestine. (This might be a place to consider the possible role of scriptural images in such role-playing ven- tures.) According to Davis, Anglo-Saxon American Protestants could emerge from Palestine Park revitalized in their faith in themselves, their heritage, and their beliefs, all of which were increasingly buffeted by a "rapidly changing world in which faith, social and political prepotency, and the Middle East were no longer fixed and immutable quantities" (p. 96). He puts Palestine Park and its costumed visitors in a broader context, citing it as an example of the late 19th-century antimodern impulse to project oneself, often through tableaux vivants and pageants, into a more vital, "primitive" world (p. 94). (An interest- ing contemporary parallel, albeit in a very different social and religious context, is the aesthetically sophisticated, Greek-inspired pag- eantry undertaken in the elite world of the Cornish, New Hampshire, art colony, dis- cussed in Kathleen Pyne's recent book.)7 Each of the four chapters in part 2 exam- ines an individual artist who traveled to the Holy Land and the images he produced out of that experience. The work of Kellogg, Troye, Fairman, and Church spans the time between the pioneering efforts of panoramists in the 1830s and the heyday of photo-volumes in the late 19th century. Like these panoramists and photographers, all four painters had "to navi- gate the complex cultural topography of reli- gious faith, scientific doubt, colonial desire, and contemporary aesthetics" (p. 97). Among Davis's significant contributions to the study of 19th-century American painting is his attention to the specific as manifest in these chapters, set within the general context of part 1. Davis carefully examines each art- ist's individual background, religious affilia- tion and beliefs, motivations for travel, experi- ence in the Holy Land, including the selection of sites for depiction, patrons, and audiences, and the reception and reputation of the artist</page><page sequence="4">BOOK REVIEWS 555 and his images. Here we see something of the diversity of attitudes and approaches at work within what is usually viewed as a monolithic Protestant majority. For each artist, Davis emphasizes (but is not limited by) an interpretive key that helps modern viewers understand the genesis, physi- cal characteristics, and implications of his work. For Kellogg, it is his membership in the NewJerusalem Church (Swedenborgianism), for Troye his patron's affiliation with Alex- ander Campbell's Disciples of Christ, for Fair- man his status as an artistic outsider, and for Church his desire to reconcile the the de- mands of modern science with his conserva- tive faith. Davis's discussion of Kellogg as a Swedenbor- gian is particularly welcome given the number of 19th-century American artists associated with the faith-Davis lists fifteen. Swedenbor- gianism appealed to artists searching for tran- scendence because, Davis tells us, its "primary goal was to link the finite and the infinite" through a system of "correspondences." Ac- cording to this doctrine, "material objects and natural phenomena are symbols of inter- nal, spiritual principles" (pp. 105-6). Sweden- borgians in general, and artists in particular, noted a "connection between the appercep- tion of correspondences and the artist's pro- cess" (p. 120). Davis adds significantly to a small but important body of work on 19th- century American Swedenborgian artists, in- cluding Joshua Taylor on William Page, Don- ald Reynolds on Hiram Powers, and Sally M. Promey on George Inness.8 Equally illuminating is Davis's examination of Troye's five Holy Land paintings and their relationship to the beliefs of Campbell and his Disciples of Christ. Campbell wanted to purify and revitalize Protestantism with a return to "primitive" Christianity and to balance rea- son and faith. Both Swedenborgians and Dis- ciples strove in different ways to reconcile the observable evidence of science with the trans- parency of belief. Davis helps us to see how the topographically specific works by both Kellogg and Troye could, for their respective audiences, aid in that reconciliation. In addi- tion, both the NewJerusalem Church and the Disciples of Christ espoused interpretations of apocalyptic eschatology unlike the doctrines of more powerful Protestant denominations, and Davis shows us how such interpretations colored their images. Davis brings his previous analysis of panora- mas to bear on our understanding of how Holy Land easel paintings were composed and then presented to and apprehended by the public. Especially informative in this re- gard is his discussion of Fairman who, of these four artists, was positioned furthest from the artistic mainstream. His inability to break into the established northeastern art world necessi- tated his creation of a network of patronage outside this system. Davis looks closely at the religious, political, and class orientations of Fairman's milieu, and his discussion takes us refreshingly away from the National Academy of Design and similar institutions. Davis's chapter on Church manages to break important new ground in well-tilled soil. Church's paintings of Palestine and Syria, produced and exhibited in the late 1860s and 1870s, are usually dismissed in favor of his earlier, New World landscapes and have never been the subject of such concentrated analy- sis.9 Davis places them within the context of Church's lifelong devotion to Bible-based sci- ence, indicative of "his struggle with the religious ramifications of post-Darwinian sci- ence" and his "willingness to turn to the Holy Land for a way out of his dilemma" (p. 175). According to Davis, Darwin's presentation of a random, excruciatingly slow process of ori- gin and change was anathema to Church's devout conception of a divinely ordered and regulated cosmos. Both the natural rocks of the Holy Land and the stones of its architec- tural ruins reassured Church, as they must have reassured other American pilgrims, that the foundation of their faith was solid and their God omniscient. With his eloquent analysis of Church's post- Civil War reassessment of spiritual and na- tional faith, Davis helps the modern reader understand what drew so many Americans to the Holy Land in the late 1860s and 1870s. (In his introduction, Davis discusses some of the equally important but more prosaic economic and technological factors that contributed to this exodus.) And in this discussion of Church (as well as in the book's epilogue), Davis suggests how the world view and the visual conventions of the panoramic landscape- great size and careful detail, didacticism and astonishment-lost their power in the late 19th century in the face of "increased cultural fragmentation and secularization" (p. 208). One of the greatest pleasures in reading The Landscape of Belief is participating in Dav- is's powerful and evocative engagement with specific images. His descriptive passages pro- vide a vivid sense of the painting's physicality, especially evident in his discussions of paint surface and brushstroke, and he often em- ploys anthropomorphic imagery to lively ef- fect. His beautifully crafted visual descriptions animate the book's reproductions with such vitality that they almost seem to be organic entities capable of feeling and movement. This is no small achievement in a field where too often thick prose can crush visual excite- ment. Davis is clearly sensitive to the relationship of image and viewer, and this relationship is fundamental to his compelling interpreta- tions. Yet, much as I was consistently drawn into the process of these interpretations, I was not always convinced by their conclusions. Often, too much intrinsic authority was given to the image as an autonomous entity and too little volition allowed the perceiver. Descrip- tions of an image's effect on its viewer, written in a generalizing present tense, seemed to posit only one possible reaction. We are told, for example, that because of its strong vertical element "viewers standing before" Church's Jerusalem (1870) "experience a 'lift' that could almost be described as physical" (p. 191). I am not convinced that verticality overpowers horizontality in this image (recognizing that I base my judgment on a small reproduction), nor do I believe that, even if it did, everyone would experience its effects similarly. Davis, often citing Mircea Eliade's universalizing language of religious symbol, seems to suggest that physical and emotional reactions to visual structures can be codified into a comprehen- sible and comprehensive system irrespective of person, time, or place. The difficulty in ascertaining just how an image will be read by any given individual is illustrated, for example, in another of Davis's characterizations of Church's Jerusalem. Ac- cording to Davis, in this and similar paintings the artist "provides his spectators with guid- ance and direction and seems to turn and manipulate them until they are forced into seeing what he sees and feeling what he feels" (p. 179). Yet a contemporary viewer of Jerusa- lem likened the painting to a map in front of which "the eye is at first confused and misled. It must go roving about and learning its lesson" (p. 189). The questions raised by such divergent experiences of the same image need to be addressed, and these experiences underscore the significant role that the per- ceiver plays in the formulation of meaning. Here and elsewhere, I found myself wanting more analysis of this role, particularly in its specific 19th-century context. Perhaps greater attention to the reception of these images by their original audiences and the commentary they elicited would help in this endeavor. For example, Davis discusses Troye's Dead Sea as an unremittingly bleak image, devoid of any sense of the divine because of its insistent, unbroken horizontal- ity. But the painting was warmly received when first exhibited in the United States. Davis explains this seeming anomaly-a God- less image acclaimed by devout Protes- tants-by suggesting that Americans were so accepting of the importance of landscape and so used to reading it symbolically that they could find "meaning and value" even where none existed, as in Troye's "crushed" and empty landscape (p. 145). Why insist that this audience got it wrong-that they were in fact mistaken when they saw in its colors "evi- dence of the ravages of divine fire" (p. 145)? 7.

Central to Davis's interpretation of Holy Land images are the ideological dynamics of viewpoint, informed by John Urry's concep- tion of the "tourist gaze." This, according to Davis, was the position relative to the land- scape, people, and experiences adopted by most artists in the Holy Land and thus is the vision animating and structuring their im- ages. According to Davis, this "tourist gaze" is "both active and passive, unusually open and absorbing, but also controlling and enfram- ing" (p. 6). This conceptual framework pro- vides for much fascinating and compelling visual analysis, although Davis's stress on the controlling and enframing aspects of this perspective, as well as its externalized and disembodied qualities, sometimes undercuts the rich possibilities of analysis that he himself exposes. This is true, for example, in his treatment of Kellogg's Top of Mount Sinai with the Chapel ofElijah (n.d.). The painting depicts the artist seated on the summit of Mount Sinai, examin- ing a drawing or a map while observed by his Arab guide. Davis offers a compelling analysis that links the presence and pose of the artist to Swedenborgian conceptions of both Moses and Saint John receiving divine revelation. But he ultimately finds the image problem- atic, devoid of much meaning beyond the combination of artistic presence and sacred space. He judges it "passively composed" and uses language that seems to hold the image responsible for its own failure. It is, he writes, "not quite capable of bringing together its bits of data meaningfully" (p. 123). Kellogg's painting fails, Davis asserts, in part because it "goes so blatantly against type" in not offering a panoramic spectacle. Davis presupposes that people climb moun- tains to be rewarded by the "panoramic pros- pect of the valley below" (p. 124). Thus the painting, and Kellogg as its maker, deny view- ers "the actual revelation." But, as Davis himself points out, Moses waited for divine revelation and transcribed holy law on the summit of Mount Sinai. Certainly a 19th- century Protestant American traveler would have climbed this mountain first to experi- ence its sacred summit and then to take in a view. In fact, Davis himself offers us a way to appreciate the emotional and conceptual im- pact of such an enclosed rather than pan- oramic space. Like Kellogg's Top of Mount Sinai, Bain's photograph The Spot Where Christ Prayed-Garden of Gethsemane (1894) presents a bounded, marked-off space. According to Davis, such a space can achieve "religious transcendence" and seem "elevated and puri- fied, preserved and contained by the familiar stones of Palestine, even as it is visually di- vorced from the topographical context that ostensibly gives it meaning" (pp. 82-83). Given that these two images are different in many important ways, perhaps the more sympa- thetic analysis of nonpanoramic points of view accorded Bain's photograph might have pro- vided some insights into Kellogg's painting. And this painting might help us understand how-as Davis himself suggests-some 19th- century American Protestants found revela- tion in intimate as well as expansive vision. None of the preceding comments is meant to discount the obvious intelligence of eye and mind which informs the entire book. The Landscape of Belief is carefully researched, tightly organized, powerfully argued, beauti- fully written, and theoretically rich. Davis has added enormously to our understanding of 19th-century American religious and political culture as well as 19th-century American land- scape painting and photography in a study that elegantly balances the demands of the object with those of its context.
