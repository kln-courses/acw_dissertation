<plain_text><page sequence="1">TWO FALLIBILISTS IN SEARCH OF THE TRUTH Susan Haack and Konstantin Kolenda I-Susan Haack The similarities between Peirce's and Popper's epistemolo- gies-the more remarkably because it seems that Popper's acquaintance with Peirce's work is quite slight-are striking.' My purpose in making a detailed comparison is not simply historical, however, but also epistemological; my hope is that these investigations will throw some light on issues- especially, on the rBles of the concepts of truth and belief in a fallibilist epistemology-with which both are centrally concerned. The table (p. 64) summarises the most significant points of comparison that I shall be able to consider; there are significant similarities, also, in metaphysical views- notably, realism and indeterminism-but these fall outside the scope of the present paper. Philosophy and science Both Peirce and Popper are concerned with the theory of scientific knowledge. Peirce stresses the importance of his training in chemistry and physics for his philosophical views, observing that he is "saturated, through and through, with the spirit of the physical sciences" (1.3). Popper reports that he was prompted to methodological studies by reflecting on the theories of Freud, Marx and Adler, and insists that fruit- ful philosophical work should be based on problems arising in the history of science rather than problems arising in the history of philosophy. Fallibilism Peirce is a fallibilist. He rejects that approach to episte- mology, typified by Descartes, which seeks foundations for knowledge, an indubitable basis. There are, he argues, no such self-authenticating pieces of knowledge, infallibly recog- nisable as such, as foundationalist epistemology requires.</page><page sequence="2">64 I-SUSAN HAACK Peirce Scientific training.

We cannot and should not begin, as Descartes recommends, by trying to doubt all our beliefs in</page><page sequence="3">TWO FALLIBILISTS IN SEARCH OF THE TRUTH 65 the hope of thereby discovering their indubitable core. In- stead, Peirce urges, we must begin from where we are, with the beliefs we have; we should, however, subject these commonsense beliefs to criticism, clarifying and testing them, and be ready to modify or reject those which are found wanting. One must always be prepared to give up a cherished belief, for "the scientific spirit requires a man to be at all times ready to dump his whole cartload of beliefs, the moment experience is against them" (1.55)- Popper, too, is a fallibilist. He rejects the idea that there are any infallible sources of knowledge, along with the idea that any proposition can be conclusively verified. Knowledge rests on "earlier knowledge" ([1963], p. 28). The "earlier knowledge" needn't be true, and is not certain or even prob- able. It is accepted only tentatively, and every part of it is open to criticism ([1963] p. 238). Conjecture and refutation is possible only with reference to an initial problem situation, and infinite regress is avoided by appeal to inborn 'con- jectures'. Both Peirce and Popper present their fallibilism by con- trast with the foundationalist character of earlier epistemolo- gies-Peirce with Descartes, Popper with the Logical Posi- tivists. Both take a dynamic view, in that their concern is with science as a growing process. Peirce thinks of science, not as a body of knowledge, but as a "living historic entity", the "pursuit of those who are devoured by a desire to find things out" (1.44, 1.7). Popper, similarly, insists that science be re- garded, not as a set of propositions, but as a series of problem situations, tentative solutions, error eliminations, and new problem situations.2 In this respect, too, each contrasts with his foundationalist predecessors. It seems, though, that Peirce connects his fallibilism with his indeterminism-since there aren't any exact and universal laws we can't hope for precise and fully comprehensive knowledge-whereas Popper does not stress this connexion. Belief Popper attacks traditional epistemologies as "belief philoso- phies", urging instead an "epistemology without a knowing subject" which concentrates on propositions believed rather than on beliefs. In part, his antipathy to belief springs from</page><page sequence="4">66 I-SUSAN HAACK his attitude to induction, which I shall consider later in some detail. In [1959] his objection to belief philosophy is mani- fested in his constant stress that his concern is not the psychology or sociology of scientific research, but the logic of problem situation, hypothesis and test, which, he insists, is an altogether separate matter. In [1972] the objections take a metaphysical form, when Popper distinguishes the "worlds" of physical objects, mental states and objective contents of mental states, and urges that epistemology disentangle itself from psychology and turn from the second to the third world. Belief philosophies, Popper fears, will, by compromising epistemology with appeals to psychology, lead to subjectivism, and, by turning attention to the genesis of beliefs, encourage the idea that there are infallible sources of knowledge. Peirce, like Popper, thinks of science as growing, not static, as constituted rather by its methods than its results; again like Popper, he distinguishes the spheres of logic and psychology, and locates the theory of scientific method within the scope of the former rather than the latter (2.39, ff., 8.239); and he is also a realist. Nevertheless, the notion of belief plays an important r6le in Peirce's theory of inquiry. Following Bain, Peirce takes belief to be a kind of habit of, or disposi- tion to, action (see Bain [1875] and Popper cf. [1974] p. 68). In a novel environment, however, an old habit may be found ineffectual, so that a new habit must be formed to cope with the unfamiliar situation. Where the original habit is a belief, its frustration by a novel stimulus is doubt. Doubt is thus an uncomfortable state, from which one seeks relief by the establishment of a new habit or belief. The aim of inquiry is, precisely, the acquisition of stable beliefs-beliefs which will not be thrown into doubt by recalcitrance on the part of the world; the virtue of the Scientific Method is, according to Peirce, just that it can yield, eventually, beliefs safe from overthrow by subsequent experience. Peirce's objection to the Cartesian methodology is based on this naturalistic view of belief. Paper, pretended doubt is neither possible nor de- sirable; we should not "pretend to doubt in philosophy what we do not doubt in our hearts". Obviously, Peirce's account of belief requires amplifica- tion, for instance, on the questions, how broadly "action" in "habit of action" is to be understood, how allowance is to be</page><page sequence="5">TWO FALLIBILISTS IN SEARCH OF THE TRUTH 67 made for the interplay of beliefs and desires in determining action, whether the possibility of a person's holding incon- sistent beliefs can be explained. But the contrast between Peirce's belief-oriented theory of inquiry and Popper's con- centration on the logical relations between the propositions which are the contents of beliefs is already evident. Peirce's approach has certain advantages. For example, his naturalis- tic view of belief and doubt fits better than Popper's concen- tration on the contents of beliefs with a concern with the growth of science, and supplies a new dimension to the thesis of the continuity of scientific knowledge with inborn habits; and his account of how unfamiliar stimuli interfere with belief to produce doubt and new beliefs anchors Peirce's epistemology in experience more firmly than Popper's ac- count of basic statements as adopted by a decision somewhat mysteriously "motivated" by experience. This illustrates a more general point. Popper is impressed by the Fregean argu- ment that world 2 entities are essentially private and sub- jective, so that there is a need to postulate world 3 items to account for the objective, public character of science. But this manoeuvre has a way of creating a difficulty as bad as the one it is supposed to solve: it now becomes inexplicable how worlds 2 and 3 interact, how one "grasps" a proposition. Popper is so anxious to distinguish epistemology from psychology3 that he is in considerable danger of failing to distinguish epistemology from logic. Peirce, by contrast, is able to offer, in his theory of inference, an elegant account of the relations between what Popper would call the 2nd and the 3rd worlds, or what he would call the logical and psycho- logical aspects of belief: while validity is an objective property, inference is a mental process, distinguished from association of ideas by its reliance on a "leading principle" implicit or explicit; an inference is safe just in case its leading principle is valid. What, then, of Popper's fear that "belief philosophies" will fall into subjectivism? It seems to rest on the dubious assumption that the psychological must be sub- jective; and the fallacious argument that because infallibilism leads to the view that inquiry into the origin of a belief can establish its truth, since infallibilism is false, genetic con- siderations are irrelevant to epistemology (but cf. pp. 79-80 below).</page><page sequence="6">68 I-SUSAN HAACK However, Peirce's attack on the Cartesian method of doubt suggests that doubt is not, or not fully, voluntary ("doubting", he observes, "is not as easy as lying"); and this leads to a difficulty, for Peirce also stresses that the normative character of methodology requires that it apply only to thought processes which are within one's control. An example: on the one hand, Peirce claims that we cannot follow the Cartesian injunction to try to doubt; yet, on the other hand, he recommends, for instance, that one subject commonsense beliefs to criticism. The tension between his naturalistic account of belief and doubt, and the voluntary character required by his view of logic as the "ethics of belief" appears in at least two other places: the accounts of abduction and of induction (see pp. 70-71 and 76 below). Scientific method Peirce and Popper agree that science is distinguished primarily by its methods; their agreement about what those methods are, however, is only partial. According to Peirce, the Scientific Method consists of: (1) devising hypotheses to explain problematic data (abduction) (2) deriving the consequences of these hypotheses (de- duction) (3) confirming or falsifying these consequences, and hence the hypotheses from which they were deduced (induction). Although Peirce speaks of abduction ('retroduction', 'hypothesis') as the first stage of scientific inquiry,' he stresses that it is only against a background of a previously held theory, or perhaps an inborn expectation, that data will be problematic, in need of explanation. He does not require that an explanatory hypothesis be probable; it may be down- right "fanciful", and should, anyway, be as falsifiable as possible: It is a great mistake to suppose that the mind of the active scientist is filled with propositions which, if not proved beyond all reasonable cavil, are at least extremely</page><page sequence="7">TWO FALLIBILISTS IN SEARCH OF THE TRUTH 69 probable. On the contrary, he entertains hypotheses which are almost wildly improbable, and treats them with respect for the time being. . . because any scientific proposition whatever is always liable to be refuted and dropped at short notice . . . the best hypothesis . . . is the one that can be most readily refuted if it is false. This far outweighs the trifling merit of being likely. (1.120.) The strikingly "falsificationist" character of this passage draws one's attention to the important resemblances between Peirce's and Popper's views of scientific method. According to Popper, scientists proceed by: (1) conjecture of hypotheses to explain problematic data, (2) deduction of consequences from these hypotheses, and (3) testing these consequences, with the result either that the hypothesis is refuted, or, if it is not, that it is, to that extent, corroborated. Like Peirce, Popper stresses that our theories are at best con- jectural, and that we should aim rather for highly testable than for highly probable hypotheses. For both, testability is a constraint upon the kind of hy- pothesis appropriate to science. According to Popper, an hypothesis, to be even a candidate for scientific conjecture, must be falsifiable, i.e., capable of inconsistency with basic statements. According to Peirce, an hypothesis, to be even a candidate conjecture, must satisfy the pragmatic maxim, according to which only those concepts are meaningful the affirmation or denial of which has conceivable "practical" or "experimental" consequences. (Although he sometimes says that hypotheses must be "verifiable" (e.g., 5.197), other pas- sages (e.g., 2.787, and the criticism of Comte at 5-597, 7.89) make it clear that this is to be understood as "verifiable or falsifiable".) There is the difference, though, that Peirce's maxim is to distinguish the meaningful from the meaning- less, while Popper's criterion is of the scientific, in contra- distinction to the pseudo-scientific or metaphysical, and not a criterion of meaningfulness. Despite this difference, though,</page><page sequence="8">70 I-SUSAN HAACK both manifest a somewhat ambiguous attitude to metaphysics. Popper has no official objection to metaphysics except when it pretends to a scientific status to which it is not entitled, but when he recommends that one employ the methods he calls scientific ([1959] p. 82), his official neutrality is somewhat compromised. Peirce officially regards metaphysics as the "Paris of the intellect", to be reformed only by strict con- finement within the bounds of "scientific metaphysics", but his own metaphysical theories, e.g., tychism, agapism, are in some danger of straying beyond those limits. However, there are two major points of disagreement about scientific method: (i) Peirce claims, but Popper denies, that conjecture is a matter of logic;5 and (ii) Peirce believes, but Popper denies, that induction is, in a weak sense, justifiable. (i) Popper (despite his title, The Logic of Scientific Dis- covery!) denies that conjecture is a matter of logic; it is, rather, "psychological". In general, Popper insists on the distinction of sociological/psychological from logical epis- temological concerns-though the issue is somewhat con- fused by his tendency to identify this distinction with that between questions about how scientific theories are devised and questions about how they are tested, both of which, how- ever, presumably belong to the realm of sociology of knowl- edge. But the present question is clear: can any logical account be given of what constitutes good discovery procedure (as, Popper allows, a logical account can be given of what constitutes good testing procedure)? Peirce does not deny that the process of devising hypotheses is amenable to sociological study (see e.g., 2.107, 5.172); he also claims, however, that this process is amenable to logical assessment. Obviously these claims are compatible; for ex- ample, one knows that some psychological conditions are more conducive than others to skill and accuracy in the use of deductive techniques. When Peirce claims that abduction is a kind of logic, he means (a) that abduction is inferential.</page><page sequence="9">TWO FALLIBILISTS IN SEARCH OF THE TRUTH 71 Inference, according to Peirce, is distinguished from mere association of ideas by its voluntary character and by its im- plicit or explicit generality (the "leading principle"). He means, also, (b) that abductive inference has at least a weak kind of validity. Validity, according to Peirce, is an objective property of the leading principle of an inference. (a) Part of the reason for Popper's hostility to the idea that there is a "logic" of discovery is his insistence that hypotheses cannot be "inferred" from "data". But the point of this denial is, first, to stress that what prompts conjecture is not aimless observation ("data") but observations anomolous in the light of previous expectation; and, second, to stress that conjectures are not-as Popper believes some inductivists to claim- derived from observations inductively. But Peirce, of course, also holds that conjecture is prompted by anomaly, and also denies that hypotheses are inferred inductively. So to the extent that Popper's denial that conjecture is logical rests on these considerations, there is no incompatibility with any- thing that Peirce holds. Some of Peirce's own comments, however, have raised some doubt about whether abduction is voluntary enough to be, as he claims, inferential. (Remember the tension between the naturalistic account of doubt and the normative character of methodology, already encountered, p. 68 above). In discus- sion of abduction Peirce sometimes says that it is a kind of "guessing", an "instinctive" matter (see e.g., 1.630, 5.591, 6.649). In the context of deductive inference, Peirce draws a distinction between the logica utens, the principles on which reflective reasoning proceeds, and the logica docens, the improved theory of logic which reflection on unreflectively accepted reasoning produces. In [1946] (and cf. his [9431]) Burks suggests that this distinction be applied to abductive reasoning, so that what Peirce calls man's instinct for guessing right would be logica utens of which abduction proper is the logica docens. But this wouldn't square abduction's instinc- tiveness with its allegedly inferential character, for even the logica utens is supposed to be inferential. In [1974] Ayim offers another kind of reconciliation, arguing that Peirce's view of instinct allows it to be voluntary, critical, controlled, and hence, inferential (cf. Frankfurt [1958], Reilly [1970], ch. III).</page><page sequence="10">72 I-SUSAN HAACK But the problem turns out to be more involved. The fun- damental difficulty is that Peirce is less than clear about exactly what it is, in the process of devising an hypothesis, to which abduction corresponds. In particular, I fear, Peirce's discussions of abduction runs together the questions (1) how the fact that, if it were true, it would explain some data, sup- ports an hypothesis, and (2) how to decide between rival hypotheses any of which would, if true, explain the data. The form of an abductive inference is said to be: A is the case. if B were the case, A would be a matter of course. So (there is some reason to think that) B. (Here, I think, one may charitably choose the interpretation according to which the "there is some reason to believe" is not part of the conclusion, but a characterisation of the rela- tion between premisses and conclusion. The same issue arises in Peirce's treatment of probable inference; see Goudge [1950] p. 172.) Now this presents abduction clearly as con- cerned with question (1). But Peirce's discussion of man's instinct for guessing right appeals to his surprising success in selecting from among the indefinitely many hypotheses which would explain the data, and so is concerned with ques- tion (2). So abduction is not, after all, the same as the guessing instinct. (b) Peirce makes only rather modest claims for the logical status of abduction: it is high in "productivity" (it intro- duces new ideas, which is why it is classed, with induction, as "ampliative"), but correspondingly lacking in conclusive- ness, low in what Peirce calls "uberty". Peirce admits that abduction produces more wrong than right answers (5.173) (it is true that he also observes that abduction is "practically infallible" (1.663); but this can perhaps be explained by Peirce's habit of using "infallible" and "indubitable" to mean "not really doubted"). It might be objected, at this point, that the only logical relation involved in the abductive schema is that A follows from B, deductively. (This isn't actually quite right; Peirce requires only that A follow from B deductively or at least with high degree of probability, and the qualification is not</page><page sequence="11">TWO FALLIBILISTS IN SEARCH OF THE TRUTH 73 insignificant in view of his tychism. But for present purposes this qualification can safely be ignored.) One must, of course, beware of begging the question against Peirce by assuming that the only logical connexions are deductively valid con- nexions; still, the objection is worth consideration. First, is there any more to Peirce's "abductive logic" than the requirement that the hypothesis entail the data? Burks, in [1946], points out that Peirce seems to impose some further requirements: that the hypothesis satisfy the pragmatic maxim, that simpler be tested more complex hypotheses, that the least plausible hypothesis be tested first if its truth- status is easy to determine. But of these, the first amounts only to the minimal requirement than an hypothesis be meaning- ful, and the others concern the choice between explanatory hypotheses,' an issue, as I have argued above, distinct from the logic of abduction. And Peirce himself admits that the rationale of abduction lies in the deductive relations between hypothesis and data (see 1.89, 1.139, 1.170, 2.776, 5.146, 6.606, and cf. Fann [1970], p. 52). Hanson has argued that there is still a more than psycho- logical difference between reasoning from an hypothesis to its deductive consequences and reasoning to an hypothesis from which a known phenomenon can be deduced; for, while a consistent hypothesis cannot have incompatible conse- quences, a given phenomenon may be derivable from in- compatible hypotheses. Peirce holds there to be, not only the relation of deducibility of A from B, but also the relation of abductive support of B by A. However, just because of the fact to which Hanson draws attention, that A could follow from different and incompatible hypotheses, say B and C, that A and that if B, then A, can be only a negligibly weak reason to believe B, since there is just as much abductive support for C, and indeed for indefinitely many other alternative hypo- theses. Peirce is aware that there will be many hypotheses which explain given data, but because he runs together the abduc- tive schema and the choice of hypotheses from among those which satisfy the abductive schema, and because he believes there to be an explanation (appealing to the theory of evolu- tion and ultimately to the thesis of panpsychism) of man's</page><page sequence="12">74 I-SUSAN HAACK success at the latter, he is apt to exaggerate the degree of support which conformity to the abductive schema conveys. How much real difference now remains between Peirce's and Popper's views of the process of devising explanatory hypotheses? They agree (1) that it is prompted by anomalies rather than aimless observation, (2) that it is not inductive, (3) that some psychological/sociological conditions are more conducive to success than others. They agree, furthermore, (4) that that an hypothesis would explain an anomaly is, in so far, something, though not much, in its favour: it is some reason for accepting the hypothesis as a conjecture to be tested. Peirce might say, and Popper would no doubt deny, that it is some reason to believe the hypothesis; but since, for Peirce, to believe an hypothesis is just to have a disposition to act as if it were true, and since he would also insist that the hypo- thesis be subject to test, and abandoned if falsified, this scarcely amounts to anything that Popper need seriously dispute. Though Peirce emphasises the rational elements in scientific discovery, Popper the irrational, there turns out to be surprisingly little substantial difference. (ii) While Peirce and Popper agree that science proceeds by the devising and testing of explanatory conjectures, Peirce allows a place for the confirmation of hypotheses by induc- tion, whereas Popper denies both that induction has any kind of justification, and that it has any r6le in scientific method. Once again, however, the question of what real disagreement there is here turns out to be trickier-and more interesting -than at first appears. Peirce distinguishes three types of induction: (1) "crude" induction, simple generalisation to the future on the basis of past experience (2.757), (2) "quantitative" induction, estimation, on the basis of a sample, of the probability that members of a class will have a given property (6.526), (3) "qualitative induction", estimation of the epistemo- logical status of an hypothesis (e.g., proved, requir- ing modification, disproved) on the basis of experi- mental tests of its consequences (2.759). Despite their differences, these kinds of induction are all reasoning based on samples; much of Peirce's discussion of</page><page sequence="13">TWO FALLIBILISTS IN SEARCH OF THE TRUTH 75 induction concerns the constraints on proper sampling. Peirce says that of the three kinds of induction (1) is the least secure and the least important in scientific method; (2) is the most secure, but is less important to the scientist than (3). Peirce considers and rejects both Laplace's rule of succes- sion, and Mill's principle of the uniformity of nature, neither of which, he argues, supplies an acceptable justification of inductive reasoning. Early on, Peirce tried to justify induc- tion by showing that by rearranging the premises and conclu- sion of an inductive argument it can be reduced to a deduc- tive one. Subsequently, however, he came to hold that the justification of induction lies, rather, in its self-corrective character: ... if it be persisted in long enough, [induction] will assuredly correct any error concerning future experience into which it may temporarily lead us ... because it is manifestly adequate . . . to discover any regularity there may be among experiences. (2.769; cf. 5-575 ff.) Peirce seems to regard all three kinds of induction as self- corrective in this way, since all are based on random samples. There seem however, to be two versions of the argument: the more specific version, applied to quantitative induction, which, Peirce argues, must eventually (in the infinitely long run) yield the true probability, the limit frequency, if there is one; and a less specific version, characterising the Scientific Method (by contrast, that is, with the methods of Tenacity, Authority, and appeal to Reason; see 5-358-77), as self-correc- tive in the sense that, being critical, always willing to abandon conjectures that are falsified, it must eventually approach the truth. Reichenbach acknowledges Peirce as a precursor of his "pragmatic vindication" of induction (see Reichenbach [1939], Black [1954] PP. 168-73, but cf. Laudan [1973]); Peirce's account of the basis of quantitative induc- tion certainly seems to anticipate, in essentials, Reichen- bach's vindication of the "straight rule". Madden, however, argues (in [1976]) that this interpreta- tion of Peirce is untenable, because it represents Peirce as responding to the Humean problem of induction; and Peirce's view of doubt, Madden argues, entails that this is no</page><page sequence="14">76 I-SUSAN HAACK genuine problem. Peirce strenuously resists the Cartesian as- sumption that the logical possibility of error is any grounds for doubt; yet the Humean doubt about the justifiability of induction arises just from the logical possibility that nature may change its course. Madden's claim that Peirce took no interest in the Humean problem, and that he offered nothing at all resembling the "Reichenbachian" response to it, will not, I think, stand scrutiny; and he makes his interpretation plausible only by running together Peirce's views of induc- tion and of abduction. However, unsatisfactory as his resolu- tion is, Madden is responding to a genuine tension in Peirce; the tension between his insistence than only real, and not consciously assumed doubt be taken seriously, and the norma- tive character of his methodology, to which I adverted earlier (p. 68). Popper denies that induction has any justification, and allows no place for the inductive confirmation of hypotheses. He does, however, give a place to corroboration; an hypothesis is corroborated if it has been submitted to test but has not been falsified. Each time one tests, and fails to find a counter- instance to, an hypothesis, one finds a positive instance of it; corroboration is distinguished from confirmation because it varies, not with the number of positive instances, but with the severity of the test to which the hypothesis is submitted. Popper seems to suppose that an inductivist must hold that all positive instances equally confirm an hypothesis; but why should the inductivist not allow that beyond a certain point mere piling up of positive instances has negligible confirma- tory effect? Several commentators (e.g., Ayer in [1974]) have argued that Popper himself must appeal to inductive con- siderations; specifically, it has been suggested that this is essential to explain why repeatedly performing the same ex- periment does not constitute a severe test, even though the original experiment may have done so. Ayer and Putman make a related point: Popper assumes something rather in- ductivist even in taking for granted that corroborating experi- ments will turn out to be repeatable. That is: Popper takes a narrow view of what methods count as inductive, while, on a broader but still plausible account, his own conception of corroboration is not free of inductive elements.</page><page sequence="15">TWO FALLIBILISTS IN SEARCH OF THE TRUTH 77 And Peirce makes only rather modest claims for induction. He objects as much as Popper to reliance on simple-minded piling up of instances (see the attack on Bacon at 2.755; interestingly, it is doubtful that Bacon held the naive induc- tivist view with which both Peirce and Popper discredit him). Peirce holds that verification is only the weakest of recom- mendations of a theory (2.776) and needn't raise its proba- bility (5.168); he stresses that science consists of tentative conjectures rather than well-supported theories, that its hypo- theses must be testable (2.787, 6.216), that falsification is more informative than verification (5.168). The scientist must "keep alert for exceptions" (8.236). So there is clear agreement between Peirce and Popper on the importance of criticism and test of hypotheses. On the further question of what one should do if one's hypothesis fails a test, a little more needs to be said. Peirce, though he stresses that one must never dogmatically hold on to a failed hypothesis, also urges that one not give up an hypothesis too easily in the face of apparent refutation, if minor modifica- tion would rescue it (7.83). The antipathy which in The Logic of Scientific Discovery Popper manifests towards "conven- tionalist stratagems" ("ad hoc" manoeuvres, as they are pejoratively described, to "protect a theory from falsifica- tion") conveys the impression that he believed that refuted hypotheses should always be rejected outright; subsequently, however, he suggests that an hypothesis be adandoned only if there are alternatives available; and a fruitful discussion of the distinction between content-increasing and content- decreasing modifications of refuted hypotheses has ensued.7 Some brief comments should be made here about Peirce's and Popper's accounts of the "data". "Basic statements", in Popper's account, are singular statements asserting the occur- rence of an observable event; they are corrigible, accepted by a reversible decision of the scientific community. "Perceptual judgments", in Peirce's account, are responses to perceptual experience, and have a compulsive character derived from the brute secondness of percepts; but, since thev involve inter- pretation, they are fallible. It is significant that both Peirce and Popper extend their fallibilism to the experimential basis as well as the theoretical superstructure of science.</page><page sequence="16">78 I-SUSAN HAACK The more specific version of Peirce's argument for the self- corrective character of inductive reasoning has its roots in his account of probability. His early account of probability was straightforwardly frequentist; subsequently (as he became in- creasingly anti-nominalist) he added a propensity element, identifying the tendency of a ratio to a limit with a "would- be", of, e.g., a die (Fisch [1967] suggests that this is one symp- tom of Peirce's conversion from an initial nominalism to a mature realism). Popper also treats probabilities as propen- sities. But since the two accounts of probability have been thoroughly investigated in Miller, R. W. [1975] I shan't elaborate on this area of comparison. Truth According to Peirce, the truth is that opinion on which those who use the scientific method will, or, perhaps, would if they persisted long enough, agree. Since the scientific method is constrained by real things, truth is correspondence with reality. And since the scientific method leads to stability of belief, the truth is satisfactory to believe, in the sense that a true belief will not be thrown, by subsequent experience, into doubt. Although scientists can never be sure that they have reached the truth, nor that, as they replace old hypotheses by new, they are approaching the truth, nevertheless, truth is the aim of science. Sometimes Peirce writes as if science will eventually reach the truth; at other times he is less confident. Popper also treats truth as a regulative ideal. He welcomes Tarski's semantic theory as providing the needed explication of the traditional correspondence theory, and so supplying an account of truth which is both "absolute" and "objective", and so suitable as a regulative ideal for science. He supple- ments Tarski's theory with his own account of versimilitude, which aims to define the sense in which, of two theories both of which are false, one may be nearer the truth than the other, and hence the sense in which science may approach the truth even if it never reaches it. So, while Peirce and Popper agree about the r61le to be played by the concept of truth, they differ about its explica- tion. Indeed, Popper expressly denies that truth as defined by</page><page sequence="17">TWO FALLIBILISTS IN SEARCH OF THE TRUTH 79 the pragmatists could play the desired r61e; for, he claims it lacks the necessary objectivity. This raises two questions directly, and a third indirectly: (i) does Tarski's theory have the virtues Popper claims? (ii) does Peirce's theory lack them? (iii) just what are the consequences of the claim that truth is a regulative ideal of science? (i) Since I have discussed this question in detail elsewhere8 I shall be brief. Popper's claims for Tarski's theory, though not entirely without foundation, are exaggerated. Tarski's defi- nition of truth does bear some resemblance to Wittgenstein's Tractatus account, which is explicitly a correspondence theory; and it is objective in the sense that it makes no reference to what anyone believes. On the other hand, Tarski denies that his theory is applicable to unformalised languages; he also denies that he is offering a version of the correspon- dence theory. Taraski's definition of truth is not "absolute", but relative to a language-a feature which Tarski regards as essential to avoid the semantic paradoxes, and the possibility of a sentence's being true in one language and false or mean- ingless in another. And Tarski's material adequacy condition (that any acceptable definition of truth entail all instances of the T-schema), is, as he observes, epistemologically neutral: it does not restrict acceptable definitions to those which would be, by Popper's lights, "objective". Furthermore, Pop- per's extension of Tarski's ideas, his definition of verisimili- tude, turns out (Miller, D. [1974]) to have the consequence that no false theory is nearer the truth than any other false theory. (ii) Popper's claim that the pragmatist theory of truth is sub- jective is made on the basis of a thoroughly inadequate state- ment of that theory, that it "mistakes usefulness for truth".9 Nevertheless, his criticism is of interest. Any theory of truth which identifies the meaning of "true" with the criteria for its application is apt, Popper thinks, to fall into subjectivism, by disallowing the possibility that some proposition be true though no-one believes it, or false though everyone believes it. Now Peirce's theory does identify the meaning of "true" with the criteria of truth. (But this is not, as some critics have thought, a confusion of meaning and criteria; it is a conse- quence of a criterial theory of meaning.) Peirce's is not an</page><page sequence="18">80 I-SUSAN HAACK explicitly subjectivist theory; scientific method is supposed to lead to consensus-the truth-because it is constrained by reality, so that Peirce agrees, as Popper insists, that truth is correspondence with reality. However, Peirce does compro- mise somewhat on the objectivity of reality. He stresses that reality is independent of what any individual believes, and sometimes bases the capacity of the scientific method to lead to agreement on its being constrained by a reality which is wholly independent and objective; at other times, however, he seems to admit that reality is not independent of what everyone, the scientific community as a whole, believes. Reality is intersubjective, but may fall short of full objectivity. This ambivalence is not an isolated or superficial difficulty. Peirce equates the meaning of "true", as the pragmatic maxim requires, with the criteria of truth. As a fallibilist, however, he believes that our criteria of truth fall short of perfection. But this is to say that some proposition may be true though it fails on our criteria or false though it succeeds, and thus allows a gap to open between the criteria of truth and the meaning of "true"."o Peirce's ambivalence about just how objective reality is spans-though it cannot really close -this gap. There are other symptoms of the same tension; for instance, Peirce's ambiguity about whether the truth is that opinion on which users of the scientific method will agree, or on which they would in the infinitely long run agree. The first option makes the criteria of truth look more foolproof than Peirce really thinks they are; although he thinks that induction will yield the true probability if there is one, there is no guarantee that there is a limit frequency to be reached, nor, if there is one, that science will go on long enough to reach it. (iii) Both Peirce and Popper are pessimistic epistemologically, in that neither supposes that knowledge can be provided with secure foundations. Both, however, resist the severer pessi- mism which holds that not only have we no guarantee that our beliefs are true, but, anyway, there is no objective truth to which we can even aspire. Both recognise the importance of this; thus, Peirce:</page><page sequence="19">TWO FALLIBILISTS IN SEARCH OF THE TRUTH 81 ... out of a contrite fallibillism, combined with a high faith in the reality of knowledge . . . all my philosophy has always seemed to me to grow. (1.14, my italics; cf. 1.2 19.) Popper calls himself a "fallibilistic absolutist".n Truth, for both, is the goal of scientific inquiry. Now, what conditions does its role as regulative ideal impose upon the character of truth? Briefly, and roughly, it seems important that truth be, on the one hand, in a certain sense, objective; and that it be, on the other hand, in a certain sense, accessible. Truth needs to be objective, in the sense that the definition of truth not depend on our criteria of truth, because other- wise-as Popper fears and as I argued to detail above- fallibilism is threatened. But also, if the goal of truth is to be of any use in guiding our inquiry, truth must not be wholly unattainable or unapproachable. Just what is required in the way of accessibility? Presumably it must be possible (but not inevitable) for us to reach the truth; and it would be nice if we could know, if we reached the truth, that we had reached it. Failing that, however, it would suffice that we knew, when we changed our beliefs, that we were getting nearer the truth rather than going away from it; or, that though we had no specific guarantee that every application would do so, we had some assurance that, in general, our methods will take us in the right direction. Both these re- quire, of course, that the idea of one theory's being "nearer the truth" than another be given a sense. To put the matter again briefly, and again roughly, some degree of optimism about methods (by contrast with foundationalists' optimism about results) is needed if the goal of truth is not to be just an inaccessible ideal, but a guide to inquiry. Neither Peirce nor Popper, I think, achieves the delicate balance between pessimism and optimism which "fallibilistic absolutism" requires. Peirce's criterial theory of truth com- promises his fallibilism. The failure of Popper's theory of veri- similitude means that, since "nearer the truth" has been given no sense in which it can apply to false theories, the hope that it can be shown that the recommended methods, bold</page><page sequence="20">82 I-SUSAN HAACK conjecture and severe testing, can be expected to increase veri- similitude, is dashed. One lesson to be learned from the comparison of Peirce's and Popper's epistemologies is that it is hard-harder than either realises-to combine objectivism and fallibilism. This, in view of the attractiveness of both theses, is a sobering thought." FOOTNOTES 1 The resemblances are noticed by Ayer in [1968], and marked by papers by Freeman and Skolimowski in [1974]. (Cf. Phillips, [1974], Handy and Harwood [1976] for discussion of similarities between Popper and another pragmatist, Dewey.) Peirce's influence on Popper seems to have been negli- gible. In his intellectual autobiography ( [1974] ), Popper refers to Peirce only once, as a fellow-indeterminist. In "Clouds and Clocks" in [1972], Peirce's indeterminism is discussed; but otherwise references are few and far be- tween. Freeman and Skolimowski suggest that Popper was only introduced to Peirce's philosophy with the appearance of Gallie's commentary in 1952. 2Skolimowski [1974] draws attention to this similarity, but sometimes seems, most unfortunately given Popper's distaste for the sociology of knowl- edge, to assimilate the dynamic to the psychological or sociological approach to knowledge. 3 Two symptoms of the stress caused by this divorce are (i) vacillation be- tween a formal ("universally quanitfied statement incompatible with at least one basic statement") and a methodological ("avoid conventionalist strata- gems") version of the demarcation criterion, and (ii) the frequent unsuccess- ful attempts to extract epistemological morals from formal logical results, e.g., Tarski's theory of truth. For further discussion of Popper's view of the relations between epistemology and psychology, cf. Haack [19751]. 4 This represents Peirce's later view of the stages of scientific inquiry. In early writings Peirce treated abduction as the theoretical part, induction as the descriptive part, of a testing or evidencing process. Later, however, he came to the conclusion that he had failed to distinguish properly between induction and abduction. Since he wrote in 1910o "... . in almost everything I printed before the beginning of this century, I more or less mixed up hy- pothesis and induction" (8.227), it seems reasonable to concentrate on his mature view. (On the historical issue, see Burks, [1946], Fann [1970o] part I.) s On this point Peirce is in the minority. Most modern writers, including inductivists, agree with Popper; see, for example, Reichenbach [1938], Braithwaite [1955]; Hanson, however, in [1958], [1959], [1961], [1965], [1971] supports Peirce. 6 Popper has been accused of neglecting such considerations as the relative economy and ease with which rival hypothesis can be tested, to which Peirce attaches some importance. See Bar-Hillel, [1974]. 7I don't think it would be profitable for me to discuss, here, whether Popper really held these more sophisticated views all along. The reader is referred to Popper [1974]. 8s See Haack [1976]. 9 Peirce's theory holds that the true is satisfactory to believe, but it is cer- tainly no crass identification of truth with utility. It may be that Popper's</page><page sequence="21">TWO FALLIBILISTS IN SEARCH OF THE TRUTH 83 account was prejudiced by the crude exposition and criticisms of Russell and Moore, or perhaps by some of James's more incautious remarks taken out of context. Cf. Haack [1976a]. 10 Different symptoms of the same tension are to be seen in James. On the pragmatic principle that "there can be no difference that makes no differ- ence", he stresses the connexion between truth and verifiability. As a nomi- nalist, however, he finds the notion of a possible verification problematic, and hence is apt to equate truth with the verified rather than the verifiable, and to claim that the truth grows. As a result he is chronically embarrassed by those beliefs which, as he reluctantly admits, are true, but never verified. n Cf. Musgrave [1974]. 12 An early version of this paper was read at the State College of New York at Fredonia in April 1976; I have also learned from comments from E. H. Madden, Risto Hilpinen, and R. J. Haack; and from the students following my course in Recent Anglo-Saxon Philosophy. BIBLIOGRAPHY Ayer, A. J. [1968] The Origins of Pragmatism, Macmillan. Ayer, A. J.

As Dr. Haack shows in her paper, an examination of these parallels is likely to throw further light on both philosophers' thought. But I will resist the temptation to follow Dr. Haack's lead in that direction. Instead, I will address myself to the general conclusion which she draws from her comparison of the two epistemologies, namely, that neither succeeds in combining objectivism and fallibilism. This claim is of interest because it reminds us that to take fallibilism seriously is to create problems for the notion of truth. How is truth to be understood if all empirical statements are fallible? It may seem ironic that two staunch defenders of scientific method commit themselves to a doctrine in which the idea of truth becomes problematic. If science cannot give us truth, what can? Although wedded to fallibilism, neither Peirce nor Popper abandons the concept of truth. But their accounts of it seem puzzling. Peirce's recourse to an unlimited community of investigators invites many questions, and so does Popper's "fallibilistic absolutism." Nevertheless, while agreeing with Dr. Haack that Popper's epistemology fails to achieve "a delicate balance between pessimism and optimism", I shall try to show that Peirce's attempt to combine fallibilism with the possibility of objective knowledge is more successful. On the way to this goal I shall voice my dissent from Dr. Haack's unqualified claim that Peirce can be said to hold a correspondence theory of truth. In spite of statements which suggest that he did subscribe to that theory, the entire thrust of his argument is away from it. Indeed, despite his meta- physical realism, his epistemology seems more consonant with the coherence theory of truth. This conclusion is sup- ported by his frequent remarks that his views have an affinity</page><page sequence="24">86 II-KONSTANTIN KOLENDA with objective idealism, and, more directly, by his highly developed theory of signs.' But my purpose here is not to find an historical pigeon-hole for Peirce's views. It has become customary to refer to Peirce's theory of truth by a name of its own, namely, pragmatic.2 Little is gained by citing this label. Of much greater interest is to follow the arguments on which his position rests. I. PERCEPTION A good place to start is the ground floor of empirical knowl- edge, namely, perception. In reconstructing Peirce's account of perception I shall try to be faithful to his essential moves, without closely adhering to his language or being sidetracked by his frequent tangential explorations. There is a need to reduce to a minimum his metaphysical asides, although at some points his assumptions must be brought in, at least in some suitable paraphrase. What happens when we perceive, say, a white object? Peirce's view is that the whiteness perceived is external to the perceiver; it is not in his mind. The whiteness of the object is perceived as whiteness. Should we say that the whiteness of the object, since it is external, only corresponds to some- thing in the object? Were we to say that, we should be taking a first step toward embracing a correspondence theory. But Peirce does not take this step. He sees another alternative. It strikes him as plausible to say that that whiteness in the ob- ject is directly perceived by the mind, or is known by the knower.3 The phrase "directly perceived" may suggest that Peirce is invoking some form of naive realism or some power of direct intuiting. But he had no use for either. Instead, he proposed a rather sophisticated and detailed account, with its own technical vocabulary. The whole context of perception Peirce called "the percipuum." What is the percipuum? It is "the percept as it is immediately interpreted in the percep- tual judgment." "The percipuum, then, is what forces itself upon your acknowledgment, without any why or wherefore, so that if anybody asks you why you should regard it as appear- ing so and so, all you can say is, 'I can't help it. That is how I see it.' " (7.643)' In the same context Peirce tells us that the percept is "ab-</page><page sequence="25">TWO FALLIBILISTS IN SEARCH OF THE TRUTH 87 solutely dumb." "It acts upon us, it forces itself upon us; but it does not address the reason, nor appeal to anything for support." (7.622) It is wholly individual and "exhibits itself in full." (7.624) Even more importantly, it is not subject to belief or disbelief. "Given a percept, this percept does not describe itself; for description involves analysis, while the percept is whole and undivided." (7.626) What is subject to belief or disbelief is a perceptual judgment. Since Peirce em- braced the hypothesis of the continuity between matter and mind, he also spoke of percepts as products of unconscious mental processes. (7.625) But this metaphysical view has no bearing on the way he understood the relation between the percept and perceptual judgment. According to him, at the level of the percept itself there is no reasoning, no logic. "Thus, the perceptual judgment does not represent the per- cept logically." It is not a copy of it, nor does it resemble the percept at all. (7.635) The relation of representation here is, in Peirce's special vocabulary, indexical or symptomatic, "just as a weather-cock indicates the direction of the wind or a thermometer the temperature." "There is no warrant for saying that the perceptual judgment actually is such an index of the percept, other than the ipse dixit of the per- ceptual judgment itself." (7.628) In spite of the Latin locu- tion, Peirce's crucial point is that the judgment does not say that a percept is so-and-so, as a picture does not say that it represents so-and-so; it merely shows it. The ipse dixit reference is to be taken as emphasizing the "I can't help it" character of perceptual judgments. It should not be difficult at this point to hear an echo of an expression familiar to us from our more recent philosophical past. I mean the expression, "I have learned English". Indeed, there appears to be a remarkable similarity in the treatment of this topic between Peirce and the later Wittgenstein. At a certain point no further reason can be given why we make a certain perceptual identification; no logical analysis is called for in response to the question, "Why do you call this red?" "The agreement, the harmony, of thought and reality con- sists in this: if I say falsely that something is red, then, for all that, it isn't red. And when I want to explain the word "red" to someone, in the sentence "That is not red," I do it by</page><page sequence="26">88 II-KONSTANTIN KOLENDA pointing to something red."5 Identifying colours presupposes an agreement in judgments. At a certain point the rules give out, and we proceed without rules and without analyses. (PI 217, 289) For our purposes it is also worth noting that Witt- genstein sees here a place for the applicability of the idea of truth. "'So you are saying that human agreement decides what is true and what is false?'-It is what human beings say that is true and false; and they agree in the language they use. . .. If language is to be a means of communication, there must be agreement not only in definitions but also (queer as this may sound) in judgments." (PI 241-242) Compare this with Peirce's point. "But that any man should have a percept similar to mine and should ask himself the question whether this percept be red, and that he should, upon careful atten- tion to this percept, pronounce it to be decidedly and clearly not red, when I judge it to be prominently red, that I cannot comprehend at all." (5.186) Considered in itself, a percept has no significance. Once more, it does not say anything. Peirce appears to be saying, as Ryle was to say of sensations,6 that there is nothing mental about percepts. Consequently, percepts do not disclose some- thing about the nature of external reality; they are that reality. Their logical significance derives from perceptual judgments to which they give rise, and the meaning of every perceptual judgment expressed in a concept lies in further conceptual consequences. The concept of whiteness, for in- stance, although it ultimately rests on externally grounded percepts, has its logical interpretants; it is logically connected with further concepts, such as colour, brightness, intensity, and, in a more sophisticated analysis, with such concepts as light, wave-length, colour spectrum, etc. All this follows from Peirce's "pragmatic maxim"' and also from his theory of signs. But there is another dimension of signification which moves in the direction of notions of reality and truth. A perceptual judgment invites its application to future examples. It can have such application only on the supposition that the in- dexical reference of a percept captured in a perceptual judg- ment is not restricted to the momentary judgment but will both persist in time and can be expected to recur in similar circumstances. This is where Peirce finds the doctrine of</page><page sequence="27">TWO FALLIBILISTS IN SEARCH OF THE TRUTH 89 Scotist realism applicable. The percept is real when it gives rise to a perceptual judgment. The percept is singular and explicit; the perceptual judgment is universal and vague (7.633, 8.18).8 The judgment makes claims that go beyond the present moment. "In a perceptual judgment the mind professes to tell the mind's future self what the character of the present percept is." (7.630) Percepts "have to be com- bined and generalised to become useful knowledge; so that they may be said to represent their own generalization." (5.607) In other words, the reality, the persistence, and the particular character ascribed by the judgment to the percept is affirmed by the logical process of signification. In this way, the perceiver can claim to know something about reality as it is, independently of his perception. That reality, however, although independent of any particular mind, is, as we shall see more fully, not independent of mind in general. II. ABDUCTION The use of the pragmatic maxim is not limited to ascertaining the meaning of simple perceptual claims. It also plays a r1le in arriving at other propositions. According to the maxim, the logical consequences of a concept tell us what that concept is. It should be noted, however, that thought can move in either direction, from a concept to its logical consequences, or from the consequences to the concept. This double possi- bility has alerted Peirce to an unclarity in the notion of reasoning. His effort to clarify it resulted in an original theory of inference. That theory ultimately is connected with his metaphysical conclusions but may be examined without bringing them in. Perhaps the best place to begin is one of Peirce's own illustrations of what he means by inference. (2.673) Consider three propositions. A. All the beans from this bag are white. B. These beans are from this bag. C. These beans are white. We can move either from A and B to C, or from B and C to A, or from A and C to B. Each movement of thought is an in- ference, according to Peirce. It is clear that only the first</page><page sequence="28">90 II-KONSTANTIN KOLENDA move, from A and B to C, is a deductive inference. Since it alone is formally valid, one might be inclined to restrict the notion of inference to this form. But Peirce does not think that all reasoning is deductively inferential. When we take a number of beans from the bag and see that every one of them is white we have some reason to think that the bag con- tains nothing but white beans. This is an inductive form of inference. Similarly, when we know that a bag contains noth- ing but white beans and we see some white beans in the vicinity of the bag, it is reasonable to conjecture that the beans came from that bag. When we reason in that way we resort to what Peirce calls abductive or retroductive inference.' What are Peirce's reasons for calling every one of these three metal operations an inference? Here is his comment on abduction: "It must be remembered that abduction, al- though it is very little hampered by logical rules, neverthe- less is logical inference, asserting its conclusion only problem- atically or conjecturally, it is true, but nevertheless having a perfectly definite logical form." (5.188) For Peirce, only in deduction there is no difference between a valid and a strong argument." "An argument is none the less logical for being weak, provided it does not pretend to a strength that it does not possess . . . assertoric judgments are, accurately, problem- atic judgments of a high degree of hopefulness." (5.192) In general, to qualify as an inference a thought must meet only minimal conditions, according to Peirce. Whenever one thought "determines" another, we have an inference. Indeed, he claimed that such a proposition as "Every man is mortal" is only a modification of the inference "if humanity, then mortality." Since "the very first conception from which logic springs is that one proposition follows from another," Peirce held that "if A, then B" constitutes the typical form of judg- ment. (2.710o) "Judgment" is another term for "inference." Recall that in his analysis of perception Peirce distinguished between percepts and perceptual judgments, only the latter being subject to belief or disbelief, capable of truth or falsity. It is not surprising, then, that we find him likening percep- tual judgments to abductive inferences. All perception is interpretative and is "the extremest case of Abductive Judg-</page><page sequence="29">TWO FALLIBILISTS IN SEARCH OF THE TRUTH 91 ments." 5.184-185) He illustrates this by a drawing consisting of a series of loops and claims that it can be taken either as a serpentine line or a stone wall. Whichever way we take it, our classification of the percept "is contained in the percep- tual judgment." (5.183) At this point one may object by claiming, with Wittgenstein, that we don't see, for instance, a knife as a knife. Aspectual seeing is not perceptual seeing; there is no interpretation in the latter. It may be instructive to consider here the phenomenon of aspect-seeing because it clearly contains a feature which Peirce attributed to all perception. There is no gradual tran- sition from seeing the Jastrow picture as a duck to seeing it as a rabbit. Only after I see the picture as a rabbit do I see the eye, ear, etc., in their particular outlines and interrela- tionships. One way of putting this is to say that the perceptual judgment "This is a rabbit" (or the application of the concept "rabbit") organizes meaningfully the complex details of the picture. This is what happens in all perceptions, claimed Peirce. The complexity of visual data is "simplified" in a perceptual judgment. "Now, it is a known law of mind, that when phenomena of an extreme complexity are presented, which yet would be reduced to order or mediate simplicity by the application of a certain conception, that conception sooner or later arises in application to those phenomena." (5.223) The act of simplification makes possible the under- standing, interpretation, explanation, and description of the data, which are seen as logical consequences of that act. In this respect Peirce saw a similarity between perception and abduction. "The abductive suggestion comes to us like a flash. It is an act of insight, although of extremely fallible in- sight." (5.181) He also concluded that "abductive inference shades into perceptual judgment without any sharp line of demarcation between them" and regarded the aspect-seeing phenomena as borderline cases. If we follow him in this surmise, we can explain the shifts in this borderline, readily discernible in the process of learning new concepts. Push perception to its learning stages, when our grasp of percepts is still halting, partial, incomplete. Is not something like ab- duction going on in the mind of a learner? He may reason, for instance, as follows: "If what I see has these features, it</page><page sequence="30">92 II-KONSTANTIN KOLENDA must be a goldfinch." Peirce claims, however, that the direc- tion of thought is actually the other way around: "If it were a goldfinch, then it would have the features it actually has." In other words, it is abductive. It should be noted that while using his illustration of a serpentine line to analyze perception Peirce was aware that he was dealing with a borderline case. He said, for instance, that "these phenomena are true connecting links between abductions and perceptions." (5.183, italics added.) Witt- genstein preferred the expression "noticing an aspect" to "seeing an aspect" to mark the distinction. What Peirce said about his illustration, Wittgenstein said almost literally about aspect-seeing. "We see an illustration as we interpret it." (PI, p. 193) It is of interest to our investigations that in the examples they consider both philosophers are acknowl- edging a blurring of perceiving and thinking. Wittgenstein: ". .. the flashing of an aspect on us seems half visual ex- perience, half thought" (PI, p. 197, cf. also p. 2oo). His remark on the following page (198) comes very close to expressing Peirce's analysis of the relationship between percepts and perceptual judgments. "The concept of a representation of what is seen, like that of a copy, is very elastic, and so together with it is the concept of what is seen. The two are intimately connected. (Which is not to say that they are alike.)" For Peirce, too, what is seen (percept) is intimately intertwined with our representation (perceptual judgment), sign (inter- pretant) of what is seen, although they are not alike. Percepts are visual data, perceptual judgments are thoughts. The former are "absolutely dumb" (Peirce), "lifeless" (Wittgen- stein), the latter are interpreted, understood. To ponder these remarks, by both philosophers, is to be drawn away from the idea of a correspondence of thought to reality. In discussing perception we noted parenthetically that Peirce was inclined to preserve the continuity of all phenom- ena by allowing the possibility of a transition from conscious to unconscious mental processes. But he also emphasized that the transition involves something new, namely, the emer- gence of the possibility of logical criticism. Within the total complex of a percipuum, percepts are not criticizable while perceptual judgments are. A similar distinction can be drawn</page><page sequence="31">TWO FALLIBILISTS IN SEARCH OF THE TRUTH 93 between the abductive act and the hypothesis to which it gives rise. There is something spontaneous about abduction; it is guesswork. It is a logically creative guesswork, however. Abduction is the moving edge of science, an ampliative form of reasoning. Abduction merely suggests that something may be, that an hypothesis may have certain fruitful logical con- sequences. Apart from such consequences, the hypothesis is not open to analysis or criticism. "No reason whatsoever can be given for it, as far as I can discover; and it needs no reason, since it merely offers suggestions." (5.171) Nevertheless, it originates all scientific discoveries. (5.172)n Because the phenomena of abduction actually occur and are often successful, Peirce sometimes speaks of them as in- stances of natural powers. This he expresses in many passages where he refers to the instinct, divination, or the il lume naturale." However, what he is calling attention to need not be taken as something deeply metaphysical, pace his own inclination. The fact that we often arrive at successful ex- planations of natural events is no more (and no less) mysteri- ous and profound than the fact that we agree in perceptual judgments. The mystery is diffused when we take seriously Peirce's own sober remark that the divining of the ways of nature belongs to the same general class of operations as perceptual judgments. (5.173) The abductive inference is not exhausted in the originary act, however we account for it. Whether in perception or in more theory-laden forms of scientific explanation, it has a logical status because it claims the right to give us know- ledge, to convey information beyond the observed facts. We have seen that perceptual judgments have in them generaliz- ing tendency, e.g., this percept will persist; it is perceivable in the same way by others; a judgment based on it is applic- able to all things like it, etc. Here we find the basic feature of all inference. "In the first perception of it, the inference must be thought of as an inference, because when it is adop- ted there is always the thought that so one might reason in a whole class of cases." (5.194)' The explanatory power of abduction rests on the fact that the locus of knowledge is neither the hypothesis alone, nor its logical consequences, nor the observations which inductively</page><page sequence="32">94 II-KONSTANTIN KOLENDA confirm these consequences. The locus of knowledge is this entire complex taken together. The abductive move consists in grasping the "resemblance" between the facts and the con- sequences of the hypothesis. (7.218) The facts and these con- sequences "agree," but this agreement is not just correspon- dence because, as we have seen, the facts themselves are always interpreted, understood facts; they are perceptual judgments and not just percepts. Nevertheless, whenever our explana- tion of facts connects with perception, we are on the ground floor of Peirce's realism. For, inasmuch as science always falls back on "basic statements" and makes them the arbiter of theories, it touches the base of all possible agreement, namely, reality itself, disclosed in percepts. But that, once more, is not a disclosure of an alien, incognizable dimension to which thought merely corresponds, but rather the reality itself which thought, by means of inferences and perceptual judg- ments (as subclass of abductive inferences) penetrates. The rock bottom of reality is percepts. But when we reach them we do not reach something unknowable. We have only reached the limit of logical criticism, which, according to Peirce, "cannot go behind perceptual facts, which are the first judgments we make concerning percepts." When I claim to see a certain colour, "it is idle to attempt to criticize by any logic that part of the performance of the intellect which draws that judgment from the percept, for the excellent reason that it is involuntary and cannot be prevented or cor- rected." (7.189) We could say, in other words, that the control of thought rightly ceases at this point-or, to call upon Wittgenstein's phrases, my spade is turned, rules give out, and I proceed without justification, though not without right. It is quite apparent by now why Peirce gave such a high standing to the abductive aspect of reasoning. The question of pragmatism, he said, "is nothing else than the question of the logic of abduction." (5.196) Induction, by itself, adds nothing to scientific reasoning. (7.217) But preceded by pre- paratory abductive inferences as indispensable first step, in- duction supplies the last step. Abduction and induction are, according to Peirce, the opposite poles of reason. (7.218) Ab- duction starts from facts needing explanation, induction starts from a hypothesis which seems to recommend itself. Abduc-</page><page sequence="33">TWO FALLIBILISTS IN SEARCH OF THE TRUTH 95 tion seeks for theory, induction seeks for facts. Deduction, obviously, is not to be left out from the method of ascertaining the truth. The scientific method includes a trio of operations: "conjecture; deduction of predictions from the conjecture; testing the predictions by experimentation." (7.672) Once the level of testing is reached we must be in touch with basic perceptual facts. Given the verdict of these facts, the inquiry may terminate in belief. III. BELIEF It is natural for us to think of belief as a mental or psycho- logical state. Much of Peirce's use of "belief" encourages this interpretation. But when he attempts an analysis of that con- cept the psychological and subjectivistic readings of it seem to fade away. Little is gained by labeling his use of "belief" as pragmatic or action-oriented. Peirce's vehement rejection of James's tendency to steer the pragmatic theory of meaning exclusively in that direction is well known. He thought that this involved an essential distortion of his basic views and for that reason preferred to call his position "pragmaticism," a name he regarded ugly enough to be "safe from kidnap- pers." (5-414) The reasons for Peirce's declaration of independence from his "misunderstanders" are clear. He rightly suspected that such a rendering of his epistemology would lead down the primrose path toward nominalism, behaviorism, and, to up- date the account, into the traps of "private language." Some passages in Peirce indicate that he thought these dangers can be avoided by a roughly dispositional account of belief, but even that did not quite satisfy him. What he stressed again and again is the central place of intellectual, concep- tual aspects of belief. His insistence on the prominence of various cognates of concipere in his statement of the prag- matic maxim is but one of many instances in which he clearly connected the notion of belief with what he called the logical interpretant. (5-403 n.) This line of attack stands out in every more or less sustained argument he gives. "When a person is said to act upon a certain belief the meaning is that his ac- tions have a certain consistency; that is to say, that they possess a certain intellectual unity. But this implies that they</page><page sequence="34">96 II-KONSTANTIN KOLENDA are interpreted in the light of thought." (7.357) ". . . the end of thought is action only in so far as the end of action is another thought." (8.272) A belief "does not consist in anything which is present to the mind, but in an habitual connection among the things which are successively present." (7.355)1" To give due weight to this analysis of belief (an analysis which is not incidental but crops up again and again), is to have reason to take at its face value Peirce's claim that science does not seek beliefs but objective knowledge. Scientically established inferences, he says, "are not matters for belief." And he continues, "We call them in science established truths, that is, they are prop- ositions into which the economy of endeavor prescribes that, for the time being, further inquiry shall cease." (5-589) The sentence just quoted strikingly exhibits Peirce's intent to bring into balance the objectivist and the fallibilist ele- ments of his epistemology. This is the central question of our symposium, and we shall return to it in the final section. A necessary preliminary is to draw our attention away from the misleading impression that some of Peirce's statements about the purpose of inquiry can give and, unfortunately, have given to many of his interpreters. I am referring to the occa- sions on which Peirce says, sanguinely, that the sole aim of inquiry is the production of belief. The full stop to which he comes in such passages has misled his interpreters, Popper included, into ascribing to him a "belief epistemology" re- sulting not in objective but subjective, psychological, or sociological theories of truth. I am suggesting that instead of coming to a full stop, as Peirce himself, misleadingly, some- times does, we should proceed to an analysis of what the logi- cal interpretant of "belief" should be. When Peirce takes a closer look at it, he draws a strikingly Popperian conclusion. Says Peirce, "Really the word belief is out of place in the vocabulary of science. . ... In pure science, it is merely the formula reached in the existing state of scientific progress." (7.185) Before developing this conclusion further we should take a quick look at another important notion. Peirce's idea of belief fits well into his somewhat unorthodox conception of the self. That conception finds expression in his repeated</page><page sequence="35">TWO FALLIBILISTS IN SEARCH OF THE TRUTH 97 claims that "man is a sign.""' Reduced to its essentials, the view contends that we can come closer to describing the nature of the human mind when we try to think of it as changing itself in the process of developing more adequate knowledge. Pushed to the extreme, the view suggests that what a person knows is a good clue to what he is. Thus, the growth of the mind implies the growth of the self. Peirce often re- sorted to the Platonic image of the soul conversing with her- self, of course with one crucial qualification; he held to an explicitly dynamic, developing view of the self." He preferred to say that in thinking, drawing inferences, understanding, the self is talking to its future self. "One is not twice in pre- cisely the same mental state. One is virtually (i.e., for perti- nent purposes, the same as if one were) a somewhat different person, to whom one's present thought has to be communi- cated." (7.103) Note also the conclusion which Peirce draws from this in the following sentence. "Consequently, one has to express one's thought so that virtually any other person may understand it." I suggest that here Peirce is moving in the direction of Popper's "knowledge without a subject." Popper's intent in using the phrase is to remind us that the possession of objec- tive knowledge makes it possible for us to disconnect this knowledge from any actual knowing subject and his state of mind." The convergence of Peirce's and Popper's views on this point directs our attention to the tireless (and often tire- some) reiteration by Peirce that truth and reality are inde- pendent of what any particular person happens to think. He tells us, to cite but one typical instance, that truth disclosed by science is independent of "whether you and I and any generations of men think it to be so or not." (7.186) But, as in regard to perception and abduction, what is believed to be the case is not independent of mind in general. In one para- graph rich in suggestions," Peirce denies that any meaning can be assigned to something entirely independent of thought. Here is his clincher: "For if there be an idea of such a reality, it is the object of that idea of which we are speaking, and which is not independent of thought." (7.345. See also 1.578) As I tried to indicate in preceding sections, Peirce does not draw from this any idealistic or mentalistic epistemological</page><page sequence="36">98 II-KONSTANTIN KOLENDA conclusions. Instead, I wish to claim, he provides an account of truth in which the fallibilist and the objectivist aspects are reconciled. IV. TRUTH "The elements of every concept enter into logical thought at the gate of perception and make their exit at the gate of purposive action; and whatever cannot show its passports at both those two gates is to be arrested as unauthorized by reason." (5.212) This statement appears at the end of the seventh and final lecture on pragmatism that Peirce delivered at Harvard in 1903. One may wonder whether it was one of those "flashes of brilliant light relieved against Cimmerian darkness" for William James who attended the lectures. But since Peirce clearly regarded it as a sort of summing up of his position, it deserves close attention. Our discussion began at the gate of perception, so we should now take a look at the second gate, namely, that of purposive action. We may dis- cover here some important clues to Peirce's conception of truth. On this topic there appears to be a basic tension in Peirce's thought. On the one hand, he claimed that the settlement of an inquiry results not only in belief but in a true belief. (5-375) On the other hand, he repeatedly insisted that all be- liefs are fallible, subject to revision. Furthermore, if in re- ferring to the ultimate community of investigators we take him to be proposing the criterion of truth, it seems in fact inaccessible. If so, how can we ever be sure that we are in possession of truth at any given time? Suppose that the search for truth on earth stops at some point in the future. This is not only likely to happen, but, given what we know about the solar system, is sure to happen. "The existence of the human race, we may be as good as sure, will come to an end at last." (5-587) This means that whoever the last beneficiaries of the ongoing process of inquiry may be, they will not know the whole truth." Yet, Peirce appears unruffled by this thought. The reasons for this optimism on this point are, I believe, instructive. He expresses his convic- tion that the search for truth is not just a human project but a cosmic project, hence that it is bound to continue in some</page><page sequence="37">TWO FALLIBILISTS IN SEARCH OF THE TRUTH 99 form or other by some descendants of earthly truth-seekers. But if so, are we to include into his alleged criterion of truth the specification that it must pass the tests imposed on in- quiry by these extraterrestrial intelligences as well? Can we have any idea what these tests might be like? Do we under- stand what this extension of this criterion of truth means? It seems that such an extension is very much like the one that tempts us to accept, unguardedly, the meaningfulness of the proposition "It is five o'clock on the sun". Because no meaning can be assigned to such an extension of the criterion of truth, we must return to something more modest. In the very same paragraph from which the quota- tion about the two gates was taken, Peirce candidly confesses that in proposing his hypotheses the scientist is governed by certain unavoidable anthropomorphic constraints. "It will be asked whether he will not have a shocking leaning toward anthropomorphic conceptions. I fear I must confess that he will be inclined to see an anthropomorphic, or even a zoomorphic, if not a physiomorphic element in all our con- ceptions." What we can think is not unrelated to what we can do-here is the key to the pragmatic turn in epistemology. In action, Peirce reminds us, "logical energy returns to the un- controlled and uncriticizable part of the mind." (5.212) Thought moves within the compass of our general intentions and purposes, and these are constrained by what confronts us in perception, or in the general facts of nature, including human nature. We should ask ourselves whether the appeal to the ultimate agreement of the community of investigators was meant to give us the criterion or the meaning of truth. A criterion, to be useful, must be accessible, but that one certainly is not. Consequently, we may conclude that what Peirce is proposing instead is a definition, the meaning of truth." But if so, what is to serve as a criterion of truth? No general answer seems possible here. It all depends on what question one is trying to answer, what problem to solve. To wit, the other gate of reason becomes relevant; we must consider the purpose for which a given inquiry is initiated. The pragmatic maxim lays down not just a theory of mean- ing; it is intended to guide inquiry as well. In this latter</page><page sequence="38">100 II-KONSTANTIN KOLENDA function it aims at production of statements which will re- move doubt and produce belief. A statement is entitled to be believed when the irritating elements due to inconsistency among held beliefs are removed," that is, when the conse- quences of a new abduction do not clash with any of our perceptual judgments (or basic statements), in contrast to the previous beliefs which did so clash. This is what it means for a new belief to be satisfactory. It answers to the cognitive purpose which initiated the inquiry in the first place. Peirce's arguments for realism stem from the fact that we often succeed in establishing dispositions and habits which do not clash with our perceptual expectations. Truth as a property of propositions is relative to the tests which at a given time appear to be called for." This does not preclude the possibility that unexpected anomalies may crop up, thus forcing us to revise the belief in question. When such a re- vision is forced on us, belief, is replaced by belief,. But this does not necessarily mean that belief, has changed from being true to being false. We were entitled to attribute truth to belief, relative to the corroborating evidence then available. We are entitled to attribute truth to belief2 in the light of evidence available now. The contradiction can arise only when we fail to see that the truth of a belief is relative to the corroborating evidence available and can change over time, without inconsistency, if there are sufficiently radical changes in the relevant evidence. The pragmatic maxim is designed to test not timeless propositions but assertable ones. In this respect, the maxim calls attention to the use of "true" which J. L. Austin recognized in his informal formula. "It is essential to realize that 'true' and 'false,' like 'free' and 'un- free,' do not stand for anything simple at all; but only for a general dimension of being a right or proper thing to say as opposed to a wrong thing, in these circumstances, to this audience, for these purposes and with these intentions."23 To grant priority to this aspect of pragmatism, which en- ables us to assign truth value to many statements we make, is not to ignore Peirce's concern for truth in the long run. As "a man of science" he was devoted to its growth and, like Popper, had a much greater interest in the growth of inquiry than in established truths. Therefore, like Popper, he was eager to see the received theories falsified, because such</page><page sequence="39">TWO FALLIBILISTS IN SEARCH OF THE TRUTH 101 breakdowns contribute to the endeavour to find more ade- quate theories, with more truth-content, closer to the "final" truth, or, given the inaccessibility of ultimate interpretation, further away from the errors of the past. Not having ex- perienced the shock of the Einsteinian revolution, Peirce was sanguinely optimistic about the evolutionary progress of science and expressed this optimism in glowing predic- tions about the ultimate convergence of all scientific in- quiries. It should be noted, however, that these predictions were conditional; we may discover the truth about the universe only if we remain faithful to sound, rational methods. (7.78) Whether these methods would entail an ad- herence to a single theoretical framework is an open question. The pragmatic maxim is compatible with many such frame- works.2A The alleged tension or incoherence in the fallibilist con- ception of truth dissolves when one acknowledges two dif- ferent purposes of both inquiry and the communication of the results of inquiry. The interest in truth in the long run, in the frontier areas of inquiry, does not proscribe the ascrip- tion of truth to propositions describing routine matters." In making this distinction we are not employing two different conceptions of truth. In both kinds of situation we aim at objective truth, i.e., an account which is independent of what anyone happens to think or say. While the meaning of truth remains the same, our right to characterize some statements as true is earned by respecting accessible criteria. We should not demand that what we sometimes legitimately regard as "true for the time being" should be at the same time subject to the tests of "the ultimately true" or "true in the long run." Inconsistency results only because the demand itself is self- contradictory. Either we want determinate, warranted truth, or the whole truth about everything at once.2 Statements authorized by our familiarity with ordinary circumstances (or by normal science) are not tainted by uncertainty which characterizes extraordinary circumstances (or revolutionary research). To say, as Popper seems to be saying, that we are closer to the centre of the notion of truth when we seek to distil it from clashing theories or crumbling orthodoxies is to offer a persuasive definition. Peirce's fallibilism, as we have noted, is conceptually</page><page sequence="40">102 II-KONSTANTIN KOLENDA connected with his theory of signs, according to which every conception is indefinitely translatable into further concep- tions. Although this means that we can never exit from the maze of signs," it does not mean that we cannot stop pushing on when it appears rational to do so. And it is rational when our beliefs are actually borne out by all available perceptual judgments. From the fact that knowledge is corrigible it does not follow that we cannot make correct claims about nature. When an hypothesis is holding up under severe tests, we are entitled to regard it as correct, true for the time being. The qualification "for the time being," however, is not to be taken as a disguised surrender to scepticism or subjectivism, unless we mean to include in the account actually given all future tests to which it could be subjected in an indefinitely pro- longed inquiry. This is not what the account intends to say. And if not, it is not guilty of failing to meet some further standards. Those further standards, in the circumstances, are irrelevant. It is a characteristic feature of Peirce's pragmatic epistemology that it enabled him to counter-balance an al- most evangelical faith in the indefinite growth of knowledge with an equally strong insistence that the concern for relevance be incorporated into our search for truth. NOTES 1 Peirce believed that up to a point his views were consonant with Hegel's. "The truth is that pragmaticism is closely allied to the Hegelian absolute idealism, from which, however, it is sundered by its vigorous denial that the third category (which Hegel degraded to a mere stage of thinking) suffices to make the world, or is even so much as self-sufficient. Had Hegel, instead of regarding the first two stages with his smile of contempt, held on to them as independent or distinct elements of the triune Reality, pragmaticists might have looked up to him as the great vindicator of their truth." (5.436, written in 1905) 2 Cf. critical accounts of pragmatism in Alan White's Truth (New York, 1970) and in David Hamlyn's Theory of Knowledge (New York, 1970). See also Dr. Haack's response to Hamlyn in Brit. J. Phil. Sc., 1976. 3 Peirce is aware of the dangers of the expression "in the mind"; it is a first step toward subjective idealism with all its sceptical consequences. So how is the expression to be taken? Peirce proposes to follow the lead of Duns Scotus and suggests that "to say that an object is in the mind is only a metaphorical way of saying that it stands to the intellect in the relation of known to knower." (8.18) 4 See also 5.568, where Peirce claims that the percept is the reality and that it is "impossible to correct it."</page><page sequence="41">TWO FALLIBILISTS IN SEARCH OF THE TRUTH 103 5 Philosophical Investigations (hereafter abbreviated as PI), 429. See also 217 and 289. 6 "To use an objectionable phrase, there is nothing 'mental' about sensa- tions." Concept of Mind, New York, 1949, p. 204. Interestingly enough, Peirce seems to be making a similar point when he says, "Sensation, to my thinking, has no value whatever except as a vehicle of thought." (5.601) 7 "Consider what effects, that might conceivably have practical bearings, we conceive the object of our conception to have. Then, our conception of these effects is the whole of our conception of the object." (5.402) 8 J. L. Austin's essay on "Truth" appears to rest on analogous realistic assumptions. "A statement is said to be true when the historic state of affairs to which it is correlated by the demonstrative conventions (the one to which it 'refers') is of a type with which the sentence used in making it is correlated by the descriptive conventions." In the footnote to the expression "of a type" which I have italicized, he adds that "for a statement to be true one state of affairs must be like certain others, which is a natural relation." Proc. Aristot. Soc., Suppl. Vol. XXIV (1950) at p. 116, repr. in Austin, Philosophical Papers, Oxford, 1970, at p. 122. 9 Peirce gives many illustrations of abductive inference. One of the most interesting ones is in 2.96 where he gives an account of Kepler's reasoning. 10 Peirce calls validity "The possession by an argumentation or inference of that sort of efficiency in leading to the truth, which it professes to have." (2-779) 11 Because an abductive act, in order to be ampliative, must come up with something new, fresh, unfamiliar, it calls for a lively use of imagination. "When a man desires ardently to know the truth, his first effort will be to imagine what that truth can be." (1.46) "The scientific imagination dreams of explanations and laws." (1.48) Peirce warns that a likely hypothesis, i.e., an hypothesis which derives its plausibility from facts already known, will not produce any fruitful explanations. Likelihoods are treacherous guides. (7.22o) A likely hypothesis "is one which falls in with preconceived ideas. But these may be wrong. Their errors are just what the scientific man is out gunning for more particularly." (1.1io) A good hypothesis will test for consequences which would be unlikely if the hypothesis were not true. (7.230) Peirce's line of reasoning here is exactly like the one which prompted Popper to put such a high value on conjectures. Nevertheless, for Peirce the use of imagination is not wild in the sense of capricious, undisciplined. It is "a deliberate adoption, in any measure, of an assertion to be true," an antici- pated conclusion. (7.189) In many passages Peirce indicates that there is even such a thing as a rationale in hypothesis formation. Dr. Haack is right in suggesting that he often conflates the questions of evaluating the hypothesis itself and of choosing among alternative hypotheses. He claims, however, that the context in which the abductive imagination is to work supplies some tacit guidelines and constrains upon the freedom of the imagination. 12 See, for example, 1.8o, .750, and 2.753-54. 13 R. M. Hare's analogous claim (in Freedom and Reason) that the principle of universalizability is not restricted to morality but covers all types of reasoning may be noted here. 14 See also 7.359: "A belief is an habitual connection of ideas." 15 I have explored this feature in a paper, " 'Man is a sign': Peirce and Heidegger," Proceedings of the First International Peirce Congress, Amster- dam, 1976, forthcoming.</page><page sequence="42">104 II-KONSTANTIN KOLENDA 16 See my "Peirce's Neglected Philosophy of Religion," Contributed Papers, Bicentennial Symposium of Philosophy, City University of New York, 1976. 17 It is this consideration, I suspect, that led Popper to his postulation of the metaphysical "third world," although even on the way to that theory the argument seems inconsistent. In Conjectures and Refutations (New York, 1963), on p. 29, he claims both that truth is above human authority and that we need common standards of criticism or rationality. "Common standards" are presumably still human standards. 18 That the Collected Papers contains a wealth of such paragraphs a reader of it soon discovers. In this regard, the effect of much of Peirce's writing is similar to that of Wittgenstein's-stimulating, teasing, often leaving the conclusion up to the reader. 19 Among Bertrand Russell's objections to Peirce's definition of truth was his interpretation of it as making truth dependent on the opinion of the last man alive in his last minutes on earth before it ceases to support life. (The Philosophy of John Dewey, Evanston and Chicago, 1939, pp. 135-36.) 20 H. S. Thayer argues persuasively for this conclusion in "Peirce on Truth," Contributed Papers, Bicentennial Symposium of Philosophy, New York, 1976. 21 In an article, "Truth and Ultimate Belief in Peirce," (International Phil. Quarterly, 1971), Robert G. Meyers argues that Peirce's fundamental view is "that doubt is the awareness of an incompatibility between two beliefs, usually one accepted on the basis of previous experience and one forced on us by the perceptual situation," p. 88. 22 Sometimes no further tests are called for. "There is nothing whatever that could happen in the next moment or the next year that would by me be called evidence that there is not an ink-bottle here now." Norman Malcolm in Knowledge and Certainty, Englewood Cliffs, N.J., 1963, p. 67. See also Wittgenstein, PI, 84, 474, and p. 224. 23 How To Do Things With Words, Cambridge, Mass., 1962, p. 144. 24 Popper's attack on the "Myth of the Framework," in The Abdication of Philosophy, Essays in Honor of P. A. Schilpp, E. Freeman, ed., LaSalle, Ill., 1976, is quite in the spirit of Percian fallibilism; a clash of frameworks is fruitful because it expands our intellectual horizons. 25 I have argued this point in "Science and Morality," Mind, 1958 and 196o. 26 Both Peirce and Popper would probably agree with the sentiment expressed by Gotthold Ephraim Lessing in the essay, Eine Duplik, written in 1778: If God were to hold in the right hand the whole truth and in the left hand only the pursuit of truth, with the proviso that it would never be free of error, and if Lessing had to choose between them, he would opt for the left hand, because the whole truth is for God alone. 27 For an excellent development of this and related issues, see Richard Rorty's "Pragmatism, Categories, and Language," Philosophical Review, 1961.</page></plain_text>
