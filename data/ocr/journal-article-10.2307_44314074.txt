<plain_text><page sequence="1">Christianity and Literature Vol. 56, No. 3 (Spring 2007) Representing the Limits of Judgment: Yvor Winters, Emily Dickinson, and Religious Experience James Matthew Wilson I During the past dozen years, the central event in the history of American literary criticism - the institutionalization of literature brought about in part by the so-called New Critics - has come under new scrutiny. The reef of decades that divides us from figures such as John Crowe Ransom, Allen Tate, Cleanth Brooks, and Yvor Winters has made it possible to conduct such investigations with less reductive and misleading animosity than that found in a work such as Terry Eagletons Literary Theory : An Introduction (1983). Mark Jancovich's especially ambitious The Cultural Politics of the New Criticism (1993) highlights the affinities between the practices of Ransom, Tate, and Robert Penn Warren and then-contemporary deconstruction, Marxist criticism, and burgeoning cultural studies. More importantly, it rescues these poet-critics from the inaccurate portrayal of their intellectual program as somehow ideologically repressing history, narrative, and politics in favor of an autonomous aesthetic objet removed from the turning world.1 Daniel Green, in a recent article, has fairly evaluated the New Criticism both in terms of its worthy efforts to make literature as literature a subject of investigation and of how its very claims left literary studies open to cooptation by critical schools (such as deconstruction, the new historicism, and finally cultural studies) that the New Critics themselves would have found anathema. I wish to extend Greens argument by contending in what follows that at least one New Critic, Yvor Winters, far from eliding the roles history and philosophy in the poetic text, focused upon them in order to work out a systematic method for the evaluative criticism of literature. For him, the text of a poem or novel was never at a remove from history, but it was not reducible to a mere historical artifact either. In his work on Emily Dickinson in particular, he attempted to show how poetic 397</page><page sequence="2">398 James Matthew Wilson language is informed by its historical condition of production and also how it challenges and even threatens human reason itself- the faculty that makes historical, or any, consciousness possible. As such, Winters provides occasion to reconsider the always contentious frontier where art, history, and- crucially- religion all meet. In Winterss almost unrelenting condemnation of "American Obscurantism," his volume of essays titled Maules Curse (later collected with three other critical books to form In Defense of Reason), he picks off writer after writer in a slow campaign to reverse the tragic consequences of the battle between the ecstatic unreason of Calvinism and romanticism and the rational faculties of the American artist. He begins with Hawthorne, whose literary war, in Winterss narrative, was waged by the haunting ghosts of Puritan allegory against the inadequate articulation of rational experience; the romantic devil took possession of Hawthorne's literary activity in the guise of these residual Puritan specters. Winters chronicles this same combat through nineteenth-century American letters, from Ralph Waldo Emerson to Henry Adams to its final decadence in Henry James. These last two geniuses, lacking anything but the half-perceived residual sensation of what once had been a zealous Puritan ethics, were simply exhausted and forced to concede a gentlemanly defeat at the hands of unreason. If every reader of James recognizes his Europeans as courtiers without Castiglioni s guidebook, Winters stands among the first to appreciate that his Americans were not mere innocents abroad but Calvinists in want of the Institutes. Amid these cursing chapters, where literary admiration but narrowly moderates metaphysical condemnation, rests a short essay on Emily Dickinson. There, Winters peels away what he sees as Dickinsons obscurity of "personal shorthand" and the cuteness of her "content-less catch-phrases" to expose, at the core, a poet of somber and penetrating intellect; a poet capable of describing and speculating on, lamenting and abiding, the "Limits of Judgment" (the title of the essay). Winters finds, in other words, a poet who meets the standards of greatness for which he has become infamous when not forgotten: one chiefly based upon a "moralized" system that binds together form and content under the aegis of reason expressed as precise rhetoric. It is the intention of this article to consider how Winterss views on Dickinson sketch a map of the relation of language to intellect and of both to reality. That is, to examine how he addressed the perennial interpretive problem of how rhetoric adheres to or trespasses against reason. We shall</page><page sequence="3">Representing the Limits of Judgment 399 consider, in turn, how that map helps us understand the limits of reason and knowledge as they are informed by the natural and supernatural realities that surround them; this should finally suggest how his meditations on Dickinsons poetry anticipate some of the central problems of literary critical practice at present. Winterss attention to and discomfort with the slips in language from the denotative to the analogical- and finally to the indeterminate- may reflect the distinction between statement and pseudo- statement found in the work of I. A. Richards, and incidentally ramifies through later debates between historicist and deconstructionist readings of texts, but it also prepares the ground for the existential and theological readings of Dickinson offered by Elisa New and Carole Anne Taylor. In exploring the critical framework in which Winters wrote about Emily Dickinsons poetry, we shall discover that his judgments - which frequently seem stark and stunted, the product of perhaps narrow and heavily-worn reading in medieval philosophy and American history- have in some sense proven themselves with age. What might indeed have remained merely "stunted," confining, and crabbed seems, in retrospect, simply acute. David Levin observed as much some twenty-two years ago. In "A Historical Reconsideration of Maules Curse? he notes that, despite the poverty of historical scholarship available to Winters, the volume presents a remarkably accurate picture of some strains of the legacy of New England Puritan culture. Curiously, the depiction Winters gives of the inexorable conundrum of Puritan determinism, where an inability to reconcile God s supreme rule and the necessity of ethical action results in the abandonment of reason, has been given a second life in Denis Donoghues recent writings on Puritan and Catholic ideas of sin. More important for the integrity of Winters s volume as criticism, many of its observations survive deficiencies in its historical portrayal. Precisely because Winters is more concerned with understanding Dickinsons poetry within the horizons of religion and rhetoric than he is with its strict historical re-situation, what he has to say about her takes us a good distance. Moreover, Winterss attention to poetry as a site or representation of religious experience aided Dickinsons reputation as a major religious poet. His work therefore indirectly bore fruit in more recent works, such as John Delli-Carpinis reverent Poetry as Prayer , Roger Lundins Emily Dickinson and the Art of Belief ' and Richard E. Brantleys Experience and Faith: The Late-Romantic Imagination of Emily Dickinson. In such volumes, Dickinson garners considerable attention primarily through a quasi-Kierkegaardian</page><page sequence="4">400 James Matthew Wilson examination of individual consciousness and the analogia fideii that draws us toward a shrouded and incomprehensible God. Winterss essays on Dickinson suggest he would have been critical of such projects. Even so, he anticipates this interest in the frontier where Dickinsons poetics and her religion meet. If, as we shall see with some help from Elisa New, his analysis has been significantly nuanced and broadened- and thereby rendered more sympathetic - in the work of more recent scholars, that has little to do with faults in Winters s essay. Rather, in reading later scholars of Dickinson, we detect the increased critical openness to Christian or mystical experience as a subject worthy of analysis phenomenology and post-modern theology have brought about. As if at once anticipating and dreading such a critical turn, Winters s reading of Dickinson exemplifies literary criticism that has specifically, if imperfectly, opened itself to Thomistic theories of Being and desires to recuperate Aquinass premodern anthropology of man as an intellectual animal. As we shall see, these practices contradict each other in their method and conclusions but complement each other brilliantly in aiding our understanding of Dickinsons poetry. Let us begin by noting that Winters writes an arguably neo-Thomist criticism, one which fixates on those very frontiers of the literary and religious that mirror problematically the once even more controversial frontier between theology and metaphysics.2 If the hermeneutic sympathies a critic like Elisa New extends toward Dickinson are not found in Winters, the reason is that she has chosen Kierkegaard rather than a version of Aquinas as master. One purpose of this essay is to suggest why Winters would have thought hers a bad critical as well as poetic choice. Nevertheless, if we consider what this putatively neo-Thomist critical system is, we might discover that Winters had made a project like New s seem almost inevitable. Throughout his writings, he persistently distinguishes between the "rational" and the "obscure" or irrational in poetry, the latter of which he condemns. With such a dichotomy in mind, he points out those instances where Dickinsons poems seek to proceed through rational human experience and- facing the impossibility of understanding, knowing, or even perceiving what lies beyond it - where she attempts to represent that ignorance itself. This moment of representation of the irrational frequently (though not always) results in what Winters calls the "fallacy of imitative form," where the languages very obscurity attempts to become the irrational condition a more "reasoned" or "moral" rhetoric would merely represent, or from which it would turn away. Winters could never condone such a dangerous</page><page sequence="5">Representing the Limits of Judgment 401 step. For him, Aquinass natural theology was a branch of metaphysics strictly separable from sacred theology, in which Winters has little interest.3 He certainly did not believe natural and sacred theology prepared one for entrance into the Cloud of Unknowing, the terrain of "mysticism" or apophatic theology (as it did, we shall see, for Aquinas). Rather the limits of natural theology (i.e. metaphysics) determined the moment at which a poet must establish a conceptual perimeter and accordingly re-coordinate the rhetoric within. Whether or not he approved of Dickinsons procedure, he at least intuited the theological ambitions of her poetic in a systematic way. As I have already said, for Winters, hers was a "progress" out of the rational into the chaotic and obscure. His understanding and refusal of that progress will occupy our attention for much of this essay. However, we might also conceive this movement in Dickinsons poems as that of the restless soul passing from the clarity of Thomistic realism into, not traditional Christian mysticism, but the phenomenology of faith of which Kierkegaard was writing at roughly the same time as Dickinson. In reading Dickinsons poetry in this manner, we will expose the limits of Winters s evaluation of her work simply by finding a way to articulate the meaning of those poems that Winters tried to show were unintelligible or irrationally obscure. We will, in effect, give a language to, suggest the meaning behind, what Winters was content to leave as a half-understood and threatening chaos. As a last qualification before turning to Winters s and Dickinsons texts in some detail, I would be remiss not to observe that it is Winters, not I, who insists upon the Thomistic basis of his system for exploring the division of metaphysics and sacred theology as that between the rational and irrational (In Defense of Reason 374). He seems not to have understood the profound debt Aquinas owed to the mystical theology of Dionysus the Aeropagite, nor does he seem to have apprehended that Aquinass careful delineation of the power and limits of reason was specifically intended to support the exploration and analogical representation of that which lies beyond it. That is, what Winters understood as a representational limit, the Angelic Doctor clearly understood as a foundation and point of departure. But we shall return to this point more than once in what follows. II Dickinsons first critics saw the half-understood, the obscure, and the chaotic everywhere in her poems. Their responses generally were tempered</page><page sequence="6">402 James Matthew Wilson by how they themselves viewed such romantic attributes regardless of how Dickinson might unobtrusively have been exposing or modifying them. Col. Thomas Wentworth Higginson, who corresponded with the poet during her life and helped edit the first two posthumous editions of her work, set the stage for a persistent trope in the reception of those volumes. In an article in the Christian Union, and in his preface to Poems by Emily Dickinson, he repeatedly suggests that her work must be understood according to the poetics of Ralph Waldp Emerson and William Blake. "The verses," he writes, "belong emphatically to what Emerson long since called 'the Poetry of the Portfolio"' (Ferlazzo 26). And later: "The conception [in "I died for Beauty, but was scarce"] is weird enough for William Blake, and one can no more criticize a faulty rhyme here and there than a defect of drawing in one of Blake's pictures" (Ferlazzo 23). These are in some ways unsurprising forebears. Emerson's reputation as a patriated American version of the English Victorian sage was established and surely helped keep the unkempt American-ness of Dickinson at the front of her audience's mind. Blake was, in 1890, a somewhat less established name; the volume of his writings edited and introduced by Edwin Ellis and William Butler Yeats, which did so much to revive Blake's reputation, was still three years away. Nevertheless, Higginson may have been seeking to use both figures as a means to showing that eccentricity and obscurity could be canonical qualities. Certainly that was Yeats's ambition in his edition of Blake, where "he rarely judged Blake to be other than 'incoherent'" (Bloom 24). For, the more obvious and logical source of the poem Higginson calls "weird enough for William Blake" is that archetypal second-generation Romantic lyric, Keats's "Ode on a Grecian Urn," which Dickinson had read: 449 I died for Beauty- but was scarce Adjusted in the Tomb When One who died for Truth, was lain In an adjoining room - He questioned softly "Why I failed"? "For Beauty", I replied - "And I - for Truth - Themself are One - We Brethren, are", He said -</page><page sequence="7">Representing the Limits of Judgment 403 And so, as Kinsmen, met a Night- We talked between the Rooms - Until the Moss had reached our lips - And covered up- our names- (107)4 Clearly, this animated, post-mortem tableau might be called "Blakean" simply because it is eccentric and irreverent, while Keatss "Ode," to later readers anyhow, connotes an arch aesthetic dignity, where the visionary and the discerning faculties meet in a synthesis that is graven, formal, and humorless.5 Dickinsons source might be a "Blake who had read Keats," just as William Dean Howells, in his important early review of Dickinson, writes that her poetic "is a Blake who had read Emerson who had read Blake. The fantasy is often Blakean as the philosophy is Emersonian" (Ferlazzo 32). Howells and Higginson and all the other early critics celebrated or condemned Dickinson because she resembled these two figures, referring always to such an ecstatic early poem as "I taste a liquor never brewed - " (Dickinson 25). This we hardly need quote here, since it is surely the basis of so many early and later judgments that Dickinson wrote uncritically and joyously of human experience as if she really had given up her soul to the natural, wildly sacramental ecstasy that Emerson so famously propounded in his essays. Elizabeth Shepley Sergeants "An Early Imagist" sought to redefine Dickinson as a protomodernist rather than a latter-day transcendentalist, but even so she quotes Emerson in her review (Ferlazzo 52). Susan Miles, in her "The Irregularities of Emily Dickinson," was the first critic to suggest that the source of the poets irregularities of rhyme are attributable not to the obscurity and incoherence of Romantic vision, or to mere "incompetence," but to a conscientious artistic purpose (Ferlazzo 65). That Dickinson creates certain expectations of regularity in her verse form only to violate them for specific purposes, Miles makes abundantly clear. And so she gives Dickinson the dignity of a craftswoman as opposed to a drunken oracle and links the unusual form of the poems to their meaning. What she does not do, however, is state, or even suggest, what those specific purposes, what the specific meaning, might be. While Allen Tate would make much progress in formulating such a statement using the context of modern intellectual history as a means of framing Dickinsons work as a natural product and reflection of its culture, it remained for Yvor Winters to take the poems not as reflections but as critiques of Emersonian New England and to suggest that poetic form itself partly constitutes that critique (Ferlazzo 81).</page><page sequence="8">404 James Matthew Wilson In some respects, Winters's reading of Dickinson continues a trend that we cannot explore here: Dickinsons critics often project their own ontological concerns onto the poets writings. Winters certainly attends primarily - almost exclusively - to those aspects of Dickinson that reflect his anti-Romantic, pro-Thomistic-reason opinions. But this hardly convicts Winters's of using a "map of misreading" to colonize Dickinson; in fact, we may consider that Winters's intellectual experience was particularly suited to pointing out just those aspects of Dickinson that were always present but which had escaped consideration by those critics who were more concerned with establishing her transcendentalist pedigree than they were with finding something intellectually new in what were patently formally new poems. Winters was born in Chicago in 1900 but spent the better part of his life in the western United States, initially out of need for a hospitable environment (Santa Fe, New Mexico) in which to recover from tuberculosis but ultimately out of choice. He taught school in New Mexico, earned his masters degree at the University of Colorado, and his PhD at Stanford, where he taught for the remainder of his life. Winters began his career as a writer of "unparaphrasable" Imagist poems, but a bout with near madness in the Colorado mountains, which he later detailed in "The Brink of Darkness" (Issacs 3), and the discovery that traditional poetic forms made for a poetry more "moving" than could ever be obtained through the "formlessness" of the up-and-coming vers libre caused Winters to turn "reactionary" ( IDR 460). Like almost all the modernist poets, he adamantly rejected romanticism in its then-current definition as the celebration of the extreme and the sublime in the human psyche or the external world. But while others, like Ezra Pound and T. S. Eliot, seem to have dismissed romanticism as simply the anachronistic portrayal of intensely happy, or inspiring, experience (the humanistic denial of original sin, as T. E. Hulme so often phrased it), Winters saw as romantic any instance where emotion was allowed to override reason and result in either obscurity or a statement counter to common (not shared, but rather, revealable) human experience. Within such a broad definition of romanticism, Winters denounced the hermeticism of modernist poetry and the Enlightenment transformation of reason into a fetish, a false idol (Reason). Thus the eighteenth, nineteenth, and early twentieth centuries were by and large a wasteland of confusion, sentimentality, and irrational snobbery. Only those poets who carefully measured motive to feeling, who made a balanced use of both denotation and connotation in language, who appreciated that a poem was "a statement</page><page sequence="9">Representing the Limits of Judgment 405 in words about human experience," qualified as good rather than dangerous, imbecile - or both - in Winters s critical scheme ( IDR 11). The danger he perceived was posed not by humans but by nature, which was itself the wilderness, the chaos that existed everywhere humans had not carefully brought to order through the exercise of reason. Perhaps merely because of his own vocation, Winters believed the most intense and obvious site of this battle between wisdom and wilderness was the short poem, where "paraphrasable" content, meter, and rhyme at least suggested the efforts of a mind to contend with, or shut out, the dangers of outer wilds and their "invasion" that leads to insanity. As suggested by Winterss critique of the Enlightenment, he did not view reason as a salvific and universal power that could make humans as gods over nature. He saw it as a tenuous, fragile, and just-barely sufficient tool that must be handled rigorously if the order of the mind and of society are not to lapse into insanity and anarchy. His conception of reason, then, purports to being premodern, and in some sense it is. Winters considered Thomas Aquinas to have created the most complete system of philosophy to date through his careful mapping of the relation - and especially the difference- between faith and reason. Aquinas had secured that systems permanent value by his division of the rational and the irrational, those faculties of perception that operate within the reason and those that exceed and therefore threaten it. Winters writes, Aquinas endeavored as far as possible to establish a separation between philosophy and theology; philosophy was guided by natural reason, theology was derived from Revelation. But he believed that philosophical knowledge was possible, and in his pursuit of it, he composed the most complete and lucid critique of previous philosophy that had been made, and the most thorough and defensible moral and philosophical system, in all likelihood, that the world has known. (IDR 374) Like many neo-Thomists of his day (but quite unlike Etienne Gilson, upon whom Winters seems to have depended for much of his knowledge of the history of philosophy, just as he leaned on H.B Parkes and Charles M. Andrews for his historical imagination of early American culture), Winters was chiefly interested in Aquinas as a means of establishing that natural knowledge was possible and of describing a system according to which that knowledge could be organized. Theology was the realm of the mystical, of</page><page sequence="10">406 James Matthew Wilson revelation, and of faith, and while Winters conceded an intellectual theism grounded in natural theology as essential to his philosophical realism, he did so reluctantly and only as a foundation ( IDR 14). Grosvenor Powell correctly observes that, in fact, Winters s entire critical project is grounded on the unstated acceptance of Aquinas s fourth proof of the natural reason for the existence of God, regarding the gradation to be found in things (11- 12).6 As a general rule, because theological knowledge was not accessible through human experience but only via specific, special dispensations, i.e. Revelation, Winters considered discussion of its content beyond the proper sphere of human activity. His position is curious indeed for two reasons, the first historical, the second philosophical. Again, Winters seems to have known Aquinas primarily through the works of the French Thomist, Etienne Gilson. Gilson s major works- in particular his masterpiece The Christian Philosophy of Thomas Aquinas - insisted on the penetration of Christianity (and so, theology) into philosophy in general, and Aquinas and his confreres in particular, as a necessary and great achievement. He was everywhere dismissive of the Aristotelian influence on Aquinas and considered Augustine as the chief point of origin for the genius of the late medieval doctor. Indeed, he would even tell his friend and colleague, Marie- Dominique Chenu, that the Summa Theologica "owes nothing to Aristotle" (Murphy 254). It would occasion another essay to determine how Winters could have gained from Gilson s texts such a particularly Aristotelian natural theology that had done with God as soon as it had proved his existence as the absolute against which the gradation of things is judged.7 For our purposes, we need simply note that he can only be called a kind of Aristotelian neo- Thomist because such a wide variety of thinkers and philosophers were declaring themselves such at roughly the same time (the myriad secular disciples of Jacques Maritain, for instance).8 My second point proceeds from this first. Winters may have had an understanding of reason that approximated to the Angelic Doctors, but his insistence that poetic language cut off at the limits of reason owes far more to Immanuel Kants meditation on the transcendental aesthetic in the First Critique. For Kant, as for Winters, only that which is revealable under the condition of subjective perception of phenomena can be rationally described. Reality itself is beyond perception, beyond the revealable, and hence lies beyond meaningful representation in language (Kant 70). Hence, theology, which in Aquinass definition takes Revelation for its first</page><page sequence="11">Representing the Limits of Judgment 407 principle, necessarily comes into conflict with revealability. This conclusion of Kants would, in part, prompt the rebirth of Thomistic philosophy in the middle of the nineteenth century, which sought to refute the critical turn Kant had initiated by epistemologically justifying the contact of the human intellect with the real itself. Why Winters would effectively confuse one of the first principles of that turn with a philosophical system that found it anathema (Thomism) we can scarcely ascertain. Nonetheless, the boundary between the revealable and revelation (biblical or mystical) becomes the troubling territory on which Winterss critical and poetic work meditates before turning its back. Among the handful of Winterss statements to such effect, the most powerful is the short poem "A Fragment": I cannot find my way to Nazareth. I have had enough of this. Thy will is death, And this unholy quiet is thy peace. Thy will be done; and let discussion cease. (The Poetry ofYvor Winters 184) It is worth contemplating a moment the condition of this believer who cannot enter on either the Damascus or Nazareth road. The frustration and impatience of the poem corresponds neatly to that anxiety about meaning- about totality and the absolute - which haunts nearly all modernist writing (cf. Jameson 1 60-66). To allow oneself to be drawn subjectively into obsession with a meaning that can never be comprehended or rationally expressed is, according to the poem, a death wish, rather than a movement toward artistic and spiritual salvation as it was for a writer like T. S. Eliot.9 Winterss last imperative is not simply directed at the anxiety of his conscience about the elusive, yet prickling, presence of God within or without. It is, in the context of his career, addressed chiefly to those poets who have taken their vocation as license to articulate what they cannot actually know, or at least, what we cannot know with them: mystical or theological experience. Winters sought to effect an end to such esoteric loquaciousness by emphasizing the poets responsibility to attend to shared (revealable) human experience and natural knowledge. Again, his Thomistic distinction between faith and reason, or theology and metaphysics, is abetted by a Kantian silencing of speculation about the noumenal (reality itself) in favor of a subjective description of the phenomenal (what all persons can perceive). This could scarcely differ more from Emily Dickinsons work. Her poems make a mosaic of the different interiors of human life- inside the isolated</page><page sequence="12">408 James Matthew Wilson moment, inside one's house, inside ones grave, inside oneself, inside one's God - and so it may give us reason for pause that Winters celebrated her achievement as among the greatest of Anglophone poets. His first essay, "Emily Dickinson and the Limits of Judgment," (IDR 283-99) is typically full of qualifications and condemnations; yet for Dickinson he reserves some of the highest praise he would offer any poet after the Renaissance or before the rise of his own disciples to publication and quasi-obscure repute. This can easily be explained within the context of Winters's own concerns for the function of poetry, but no such explanation ever settled Winters conscience about his admiration of her work. He found it troubling that Dickinson's work could so continuously produce its best virtues and worst idiosyncrasies in tandem: "The difficulty is this: that even in her most nearly perfect poems, even in those poems in which the defects do not intrude momentarily in a crudely obvious form, one is likely to feel a fine trace of her countrified eccentricity" ( IDR 284). Winters saw and did not like the Blakean novelty, the Emersonian self-expression that had made, and in some ways continue to make, Dickinson's reputation. In his second short essay on her, which appears in his last and longest volume, Forms of Discovery, Winters's intolerance for these characteristics is exacerbated by the release of Thomas H. Johnson's variorum poems. The dashes, poor grammar, and casual absence of rhyme where Dickinson's early editors had added it, all but ruined the poems for Winters- these changes destroyed her work ( FD 265). And so, when Winters published his anthology of short poems, Quest for Reality, he chose to print only the early versions of the poems, ignoring Johnson's edition except for a critical footnote. He also continued the practice of Dickinson's early editors by omitting stanzas that he felt were bad (QR 85). But even in "The Limits of Judgment," Winters appears disturbed rather than contented by the greatness of her poems. He divides them by subject into three categories: natural description, which he generally dislikes but admires for the occasional brilliant detail (in fact, Dickinson's power of description is the primary subject of the Forms essay); "the definition of moral experience, including the definition of difficulties of comprehension; and mystical experience, or the definition of the experience of 'immortality'" (IDR 286). Only those poems in the second category meet with any strong approval. As we have already observed, he would rather the discussion cease entirely than let it produce any more poems about mystical experience. This is not to say that Winters liked Dickinson's poetry when it was at its most humanistic, when it concerned itself only with the most comfortable, easily</page><page sequence="13">Representing the Limits of Judgment 409 apprehended human experiences. Rather, what stung him into respect for Dickinson was her way of capturing "the essential cleavage" between man and nature ( IDR 292). She perceived the often terrifying otherness of plants, animals, and insects rather than their likeness to human beings through some fuzzy romantic empathy. Human life was intensely problematic in Winters s conception, and to evade it through comfortable ecstasies of the quotidian or escape into the ineffable precincts of the divine was a moral error. Thus, "Further in Summer than the Birds," in its earlier version, comes in for Winters s praise because it emphasizes that the "minor nation" of insects in the grass, whose "unobtrusive mass" exists separately from and almost unnoticed by human beings, is, in fact, incomprehensible to them (Dickinson 239-40). This "difficulty of comprehension," the problem of epistemology, and the use of anthropomorphic tropes to demonstrate it ironically, all make Dickinson a central rather than eccentric subject of praise in Winterss neo-Thomist critical scheme. She defines lyrically the limits of human knowledge and suggests that what lies beyond, or beneath, by virtue of its very incomprehensibility, threatens human life and human reason. In keeping with Winterss deep admiration for the historical theories of H. B. Parkes, this poem must also have satisfied him with its use of tropes from the Catholic mass. Parkes, and hence Winters, considered the communal ritual and organization of Catholicism to be the chief means of acknowledging and confining the inexorable encounter of humanity with the irrational spiritual and natural forces that surround it. The practice of the puritans that reached its zenith in Emerson worked only to destroy the function of the Catholic mass as the necessary, liminal zone negotiating between the human and non-human.10 Dickinsons meditation on "this spectral Canticle / Repose" captures precisely how such ritual orders (in this instance, the metaphorical mass of ants crawling in line) signify or suggest what is beyond perceived order (i.e. irrational and supernatural chaos) even as they refuse to violate the terrain of the properly human.11 Following from this, in both his first and second essays, Winters discusses "520: I started Early- Took my Dog," a poem in which natures chaos meets sexual chaos in the guise of Herman Melvilles and Winters s favorite allegorical figure: the sea. While many critics might refer to this as classic Dickinson, because of its mannered imagery, Winters finds those aspects of the poem merely irritating: I started early, took my dog, And visited the sea; The mermaids in the basement Came out to look at me,</page><page sequence="14">410 James Matthew Wilson And frigates in the upper floor Extended hempen hands, Presuming me to be a mouse Aground, upon the sands. (IDR 285)12 Despite mice and mermaids, in Winterss account, the poem smartly depicts nature as one limit and threat to human judgment. The moment of death, where known life suddenly lapses into the undiscovered country, is another. Dickinsons poems on the subject are many, from "98: One dignity delays for all," which describes a funeral; to "115: What Inn is this," a riddle poem to which the answer is, the grave; to "153: Dust is the only Secret," which is a kind of mock biography for death. Winters himself reprints "519: 'Twas warm- at first- like Us" to exemplify the "cleavage between the living and the dead" ( IDR 290). For these representations of death, perceived by the living, Winters allows general praise. He strikingly divides still one other group of poems for both his greatest admiration and greatest condemnation. When Dickinson proposes to enter into the undiscovered country herself and portray it, Winters dislikes her tendency to abstraction, which typically manifests itself in three words: "circumference," "eternity," and "immortality." These he refers to as "pure nonsense" ( IDR 286). In "712: Because I could not stop for Death," he notes the use of these two latter words as "loose and indefinable ... so that the poem ends unconvincingly" on "I first surmised the horses' heads / Were toward eternity" ( IDR 289). In the instance of this poem, however, he forgives the abstractions because, as a whole, it attempts not to enter into the experience of death to which Dickinson actually has no access but simply uses death as an allegory to talk about the actual, experienced immanence of death in human life. Thus it is an ironic poem that portrays not the mystical but the threat of the mystical - a rational act that he describes as normative: "It is possible to solve any problem of insoluble experience by retreating a step and defining the boundary at which comprehension ceases, and by then making the necessary moral adjustments to that boundary; this in itself is an experience both final and serious" ( IDR 290). We might consider the rationale behind his approval the Wintersian equivalent of Aquinas s careful theorization of analogy - that sole conceptual means by which St. Thomas determined it possible to formulate propositions about God ( Summa Contra Gentiles 1.34). Importantly, though, Winterss essay focuses on the limitation of this procedure. He grants Dickinson her indulgences because they gesture toward but do not pretend to cross into the divine. Again, he</page><page sequence="15">Representing the Limits of Judgment 41 1 finds these faults in Dickinson allied to what he most admires in her- the exploration of that cleavage between person and nature, creature and God through an ironic language that, because it is ironic, only appears to cross that cleavage. In his sonnet, "To Emily Dickinson," he centralizes her historical position in the twilight of Protestant New England (exemplary of the recession of the "great tide of faith" from the modern world), where she is "lost in a words lost certitude," in order to praise her poetic approach to God. Her poems "trace an epilogue to words grown odd / In that hard argument which led to God" ( PYW 117). That is, the poems remain rooted in our rational experience even as they trace with the tip of a finger the limits of judgment, where the gradations of created being disappear into the absolute of God. Of many other poems, though, he is not so forgiving - precisely because, in them, Dickinson makes pretenses to mystical experience or dissolving and crossing the limits of judgment. Abstractions take over as if to represent what is in fact being concealed - she would speak the ineffable through generalities that conceal her ignorance. This is a decisive observation in Winterss defense of reason. It marks the conversion to literary criticism of what Etienne Gilson (and most of western philosophy before him) taught Winters to understand regarding epistemology. Gilson, in Winters s reading of him, opposes natural reason and philosophical realism, which Aquinas supremely represents, with Ockham and St. Augustine. Ockham is a nominalist rather than a realist, a position that Winters defines as that in which "all morality and moral knowledge, or what we call such, are independent of nature," they have no reality as ideas that can be systematized ( IDR 375). St. Augustine represents the opposite of natural reason- voluntarism, which is "The Type of Christianity to place faith, which results from an act of the will made possible by Divine Grace, above understanding" ( IDR 377). Now, we can hardly explore the difficulties of such a dichotomy here; suffice to say that the cleavage between Augustine and Aquinas cannot so easily be granted (cf. Mclnerny 109). 13 But for Winterss purposes, anything that smacks of voluntarism (the subordination of the reason, which is our only means to knowledge, to the will) runs against human experience- which is, in fact, the accumulated product of reason. Referring to Dickinsons "1159: Great Streets of silence led away," Winters writes: "This is technically a mystical poem: that is, it endeavors to render an experience - the rapt contemplation, eternal and immovable, which Aquinas describes as the condition of beatitude- which is by definition</page><page sequence="16">412 James Matthew Wilson foreign to all human experience" (IDR 288). Of this, as we have observed, he would like a lot less. And yet we can hardly dismiss such poems as merely seeking to represent what they in fact cannot. They are more sophisticated than that- though admittedly it is a sophistication that Winters, had he fully grasped it, would nonetheless have condemned. "Eternity" appears in the collected poems fifty-four times; "immortality" forty-three; and "circumference" sixteen. While Winters looks on them as empty words - abstract yet containing no concepts - Elisa New has suggested that they in fact contain the most pioneering, provocative, and difficult of Dickinson's ideas. To conceptualize them, however, we must not, with Winters, switch from Aquinas to Augustine, but rather, with New, turn to the existential phenomenology of Kierkegaard. In making such a move, New nonetheless acknowledges a Kierkegaardian debt to Augustine's - and Emerson's - conception of God as "a circle whose center was everywhere and its circumference nowhere" (4). 14 According to New, Kierkegaard allows us to articulate the experience of reason crashing up against its own limits, of its meeting God not as a stable center of revelation and doctrine, but as a perimeter: "God encounters man on a 'limit' which is of a character necessarily veiled or unknown and which does not submit to human knowledge, human organization" (5). Using Dickinson's letters and poems as support, New finds an affinity between the two nineteenth-century authors that is not belied by their separation of languages and oceans: "Dickinson is less an Emersonian idealist- an American Kantian or Romantic - pursuing center through pursuit of her poetic persona, than she is a skeptical Kierkegaardian, everywhere apprehending her own limit, finding in each Emersonian circle but another center to be dissolved" (5). 15 That is, as Dickinson's private career unfolds, she gradually works her way through all conventions and conceptual means of identifying, of knowing God; as each such convention gets proven a false idol, she comes to realize in her poetry not a mystical knowledge of God but to represent the very unrepresentability, the collapsing of finite terms and images, before the elusive, infinite, and absolute otherness of God (New 20). Were New attending to these features in Dickinson in the framework of a premodern system of negative theology (as found in Augustine or Dionysius the Aeropagite), she would have to address them in terms of apophatic or mystical theology. The emphasis on Kierkegaard and phenomenology, however, leads her to conclude that Dickinson's practice is that of a subject articulating the often agonizing limits of religious experience</page><page sequence="17">Representing the Limits of Judgment 413 rather than that of a master reporting the feedback of mystical union with God. Dickinson does not smugly pretend to have entered into the secrets of divinity but, rather, so perspicaciously maps the limits of judgment that even what had seemed achieved knowledge becomes inadequate, tentative, and contingent. Knowledge perpetually crumbles back into the dust of experience, the words of a reflexive and inadequate trope. And so, contrary to Winters s suggestions, Dickinson does not indulge in a forged mysticism where the poet experientially crosses into the divine. Rather, she in a sense expands Winters s own conception of the poem as a statement about human experience. She details the limits of that experience in media res , rather than after having, as Winters puts it, retreated a step. She widens the limits of representation by momentarily refusing the limits of judgment. It should be said that Winters would have classified this not as a gain in poetic range of representation but as a loss of the reflective act of the mind upon the material of experience. In saying that the poem tries to include too much beyond revealable human experience, he more forcefully intends that the poet has left out the central and distinct aspect of that experience: the turning of the reason upon it.16 Dickinsons unmediated experience is neither possible nor desirable because it does not fulfill humankinds being or end ( telos ) as an intellectual animal. New, in contrast, suggests that this suspension of the critical reflection of reason allows for the record of unmediated phenomenological exploration. She provides many examples of such exploration, but to submit a particularly apt poem for our consideration, let us examine this one: 1231 Somewhere upon the general Earth Itself exist Today- The Magic passive but extant That consecrated me - Indifferent Seasons doubtless play Where I for right to be - Would pay each Atom that I am But Immortality- Reserving that but just to prove Another Date of Thee- Oh God of Width, do not for us Curtail Eternity! (262)</page><page sequence="18">414 James Matthew Wilson Here Dickinson actually uses two of those three vague immensities mentioned above, and she implies "circumference" in the penultimate line. The attempt to find signifiers in language for the divine power of creation is, from the first, ironized. The contingent insufficiency of words appears in her use of "Magic," a clearly less divine term than might have been chosen in earnest. It is even anthropomorphic, as Death is in "Because I could not stop for Death," to suggest that it is a body located somewhere just out of sight. But that very suggestion is subtly countered by the "general" earth- the prospect of finding such a land that is conceptually confused between a universal and a singular, where "Indifferent seasons doubtless play" is beyond hope. The use of "consecrated," for what seems to mean "created," itself opens up the possibility of "effable" knowledges failure; such sacramental language informs us that even that which we do witness - the Holy Communion, for instance- conceals its true power from us. Even when we are in the presence of a sacrament, because its active power must be "in" Heaven, we are in some respect at a significant remove. It is this very realization that caused such conflict between Catholic advocates of the Eucharist as transubstantiate and Protestant reductions of it to a mere seal, a signifier, of a signified that is always elsewhere. And it is the turmoil caused by the divine presence and its simultaneous recession into absence that becomes the subject of objective mystical theology as well as the subjective material for Dickinsons phenomenological poetic. To be at the site of sacrament, of knowledge, though already described as impossible, is the central ambition, or plea, of this poem. Again, the ironized offer to pay "But Immortality" makes diminutive play of what is vast beyond conception. Dickinson offers an incalculable, but finite, number to us in "each Atom" before referring to that which is infinite as if it were itself but a measured parcel of time. She would give what she cannot comprehend in order to be in the presence of, in order to know, something equally incomprehensible.17 This economy of the finite and infinite, getting haggled over, betrays the failure of language, of human-made signs, to account for what is unrelentingly (to use this term once more) other. Thus, she suggests that to represent what cannot actually be represented, one must choose almost at random one, or more, failing metaphors and images. In the final stanza, Dickinson performs a kind of self-correction. Having attempted to locate, anthropomorphize and thereby make conceivable, God; and having weighed her knowable self- her atoms - and her unknowable self- her immortal soul- at the same value; she now begs God not to</page><page sequence="19">Representing the Limits of Judgment 415 condescend to such rhetoric. He should not, she hopes, become merely finite simply so that she can understand him. "Oh God of Width," she says, meaning not a width, but in fact, the creator of that very concept. He has invented measurement (circumference) and so must always be outside of it, beyond it, and never subordinate to it. She would pay everything (or nearly everything, depending on the reading of the second stanza) to ascend to the knowledge of God, but she would not have Him descend to becoming knowable in human terms: "do not for us / Curtail Eternity!" The poem, which has begun as a theological odyssey ends with the falling back to earth of its speaker s imagination, recognizing as she does that her ascent and assent could never be so complete as to satisfy her curiosity without damaging the supernumerary endlessness of God. Her chief formal strategy- perhaps the only one possible- is to assign certain abstractions with a content that must always be elusive to the extent that their totality exceeds whatever characteristics we assign. "Immortality" is more than the concept of "life in Heaven," but the degree of that excess is uncertain.18 More importantly, our sense of the disproportion of what we can knowingly assign to the meaning of that term and what we suspect may in fact overwhelmingly be hidden behind it- all this ultimately is part of the definition. Dickinson has found a vocabulary that represents the unrepresentable and the attempt at representation all at once. As New s analysis suggests, Dickinsons is a journey beyond the limit of judgment and a record of its progress. That Winters could not appreciate it as such, but saw it instead as an exercise in irrational indulgence, does not make his critique inapt. Rather, it merely focuses negatively on the limits, the circumference, that Dickinson herself draws to our attention. He seems to have thought Dickinson believed herself to be achieving - along with Emerson- a mystical knowledge, whereas she was in fact charting the failure of that knowledge and nonetheless preserving intact the artifacts of language that illustrate such failure.19 Rather than letting discussion cease, she wanted to record the restlessness and inventiveness of what was, to her mind, the inexorable useless talk produced through reasons efforts to scout the perimeter where man and language end and God, or at least the unknown, begins. To repeat, her poem serves as an account of that space between the quite wide limits of representation and the more narrow limits of judgment; that is, where experience might tentatively extend but from which reason must withdraw.</page><page sequence="20">416 James Matthew Wilson Though Winters effectively dismissed this practice as a fallacy that surrendered the distance that representation implies between sign and object, his introduction of philosophical and theological terms into the critical vocabulary was an important early step in freeing Dickinson from condescending association with American and European forms of romanticism. The intelligence of her poems lies not in their success at reproducing images of the poet-as-visionary, but rather, in their questioning of that tradition at the same time they question all traditional forms of knowledge. The inquiry that remains, of course, is whether or not the effort of reason in such Kierkegaardian exploration is not merely a relinquishing of its potential. To apply reason continuously, in an attempt to transcend rather than respect its limits is, itself, a kind of irrationality that Winters believed must be avoided, even as he made it possible for us to understand the way in which Dickinson (loosely speaking) moves from the language of human experience, through analogy, to the language of the divine (and, paradoxically, back to that of experience). To say that he himself failed to grasp Dickinson because he was applying a neo-Thomistic rather than an existential hermeneutic would be to misstate the facts. He specifically circumscribed the range of Aquinas s teachings by taking for granted that the medieval theologian did not provide a vocabulary for exploring the ineffable and that he did not believe that Revelation always presses upon creaturely natural experience (an assumption Aquinas s practice as a theologian rather than a philosopher belies). Winters s Aquinas rather found words for what could be known and knew enough to cease discussion (representation) when the boundaries of judgment had been reached. Dickinsons poetry challenged his own conclusions by arresting his attention in spite of himself. She suggested that the proper study of man was not man, in Popes famous phrase, but rather the instable margins where mankind s reason disappears into the sea of both nature and the supernatural. Her poetry becomes far more original and important in this context than it could be as a mere continuation of the reductive explorations of subjectivity and identity that characterize so many accounts of the romantic tradition.20 Winterss particular introduction of philosophical and theological concepts into the critical vocabulary of the New Criticism contributed to distinguishing Dickinsons poetry from this tradition and in widening the historical and intellectual scope of English literary criticism in general. Far from appreciating a Dickinson poem as an ahistorical aesthetic object or as a mere expression of authorial authenticity, he appreciated it as a</page><page sequence="21">Representing the Limits of Judgment 417 means of exploring the function of human reason in a frequently irrational moral universe by situating her work in a broad intellectual history. This, to some extent, made possible the less critical but more nuanced account of Dickinson and religious experience New and Taylor (among others) exercised in resituating the Amherst poet in the context of Kierkegaards existential Christianity. Winters indeed set the terms for such a study by trying to inscribe firmly the relation between the limits of representation and the limits of judgment. Along with New and Dickinson, we challenge that inscription to both our intellectual peril and benefit; a project that paradoxically sets the study of religion and literature more - not less - firmly in a tradition with that greatest of theologians, Thomas Aquinas. University of Notre Dame NOTES Respite Jancovichs arguments, Fredric Jameson has insisted on reinscribing these caricatures of New Critical practice in his A Singular Modernity. 2My terminology distinguishes between neo-Thomism and Thomism. By the former I intend those thinkers of the Thomist revival running between roughly 1870 and 1973 who may have been inspired by or drawn on the general vogue for Aquinas, but who were not necessarily scrupulous about their adherence to St. Thomas s texts and specific teachings. By the latter, on the other hand, I would intend those rare scholars whose work irreproachably derives from Aquinass writings. I do not intend to denigrate neo-Thomists such as Winters; on the contrary, I wish merely to acknowledge that many such thinkers viewed Thomas more as a source of inspiration or general principles, whereas others were firmly committed to recovering and making known the Angelic Doctor s precise meaning. 3For those unfamiliar with the Thomist tradition: "natural theology" generally describes the study of the existence and nature of God in so far as they can be discovered by human reason alone. The first principles of reason govern this pursuit. Sacred theology is the distinct study of Gods existence and nature, as well as the study of all of creation, which begins with both Revelation and the first principles of reason. As Aquinas says, "Sacred doctrine, being one, extends to things which belong to different philosophical sciences, because it considers in each the same formal aspect, namely so far as they can be known through divine revelation" ( Summa Theologica la, 1,4). Natural theology is that which the human reason by its own efforts can learn about God, as exemplified in Aristotles Physics and Metaphysics , and in Aquinass "five proofs" in the Summa Theologica. In the Thomist tradition, sacred theology broadly conceived governs the entire range</page><page sequence="22">418 James Matthew Wilson of speculations that emerge from Revelation directly as well as those that emerge when a Revealed major premise and a minor one derived from the natural reason are combined in a syllogism to reach a new conclusion. Theological traditions vary, but what is most crucial in the Thomist tradition is the emphasis on the productive engagement of human reason and knowledge with Revealed Truths. As we shall see, Winters misconceived, or simply rejects, such an engagement. 4In the text, I include the manuscript numbers Johnson has affixed to his editions of the collected and selected poems. 5It is a telling bit of historical trivia (telling, that is, about Keats s established reputation as a major and serious poet) that Cleanth Brooks's famous The Well Wrought Urn (1947) is often believed to have taken its title from Keats s "Ode" and Brookss own essay on it in that volume. In fact, the title reproduces a phrase from John Donnes "The Canonization," also explicated in the volume. 6Cf. Summa Theologica la, 2, 3. 7Dick Davis's excellent early essay, "Turning Metaphysician: Winterss Change of Direction," offers the convincing, if partial, explanation that Winters simply read Aquinas for himself at the insistence of his mentor W. D. Briggs, and emphasized the division between faith and reason to allow himself to accept all of Aquinass philosophy in so far as it was philosophy rather than theology, reasoned rather than revealed. My point has simply been to observe that Winters s clear familiarity with Gilsorís work should have suggested to him that such a separation was necessarily problematic and ahistorical. 8Gerald McCools two histories of neo-Thomism give a helpful summary of the different schools of that philosophic and theological movement. Both volumes offer a wealth of detail and an excellent consideration of the nuances of different Thomist schools. They are written from a perspective that is not in fashion with most contemporary Thomists, however, and exhibits the limitation inevitable to a work written prior to the more recent rebirth of Thomism that has done so much to transform our understanding of its earlier history. In the latter volume, McCool suggests three lines of neo-Thomism that inevitably emerged, transcendental Thomism, a Thomism of the commentators that relied heavily on Aristotelian logic and physics, and Gilsons existential Thomism. Winters would never be mistaken for a transcendental or existential Thomist, but the middle category, of which Jacques Maritain, Reginald Garrigou-Legrange, and Maurice de Wulf are the most famous exemplars, emphasized the natural reason and hence the philosophical nature of Aquinass writings so as to admit non-Christian Aristotelians into its intellectual fold. 9Eliot's preoccupation with the ineffable and the mystical as a religious and poetic practice is described in rich detail in Ronald Schuchard's Eliots Dark Angel (1999). 10Winters drew repeatedly and uncritically on the essays in Henry Bamford Parkes' The Pragmatic Test. Dick Daviss Wisdom and Wilderness offers a useful consideration of Parkes' influence on the poet-critic (170-74).</page><page sequence="23">Representing the Limits of Judgment 419 11 For extended treatment of the role of Catholic traditions in Dickinson, see Angela Conrad, The Wayward Nun of Amherst: Emily Dickinson and Medieval Mystical Tradition , and Benjamin Goluboff, "If Madonna Be: Emily Dickinson and Catholicism." Goluboff s article is particularly helpful in reminding us not to confuse Dickinsons Marian imagery in her poems with sincere belief in her life. While most readers do not require such admonition, we should remember that Winters himself believed poems invited association with the minds of their authors. When he criticized Dickinsons irrational verse, it carried on to the poet as well. 12This is the pre-Johnson version that Winters actually quotes in his essay. I reproduce it here simply to underscore the point that, if this seemed mannered to him, how much more would the addition of dashes and strange capitalization have excited his impatience. 13However, a prominent tendency since Gilsons work on Aquinas has been to explore and highlight the Augustinián and Pseudo-Dionysian sources of Aquinass writings. It has become possible, even necessary, to consider oneself a Thomist without treating the Doctor as a "baptized Aristotle," but in consequence, analogy, mysticism, and the supernatural begin to make claims on our attention that undermine somewhat the appeal of Aquinas as the great master of reason distinguished from faith. As Maritain suggested long ago, Aquinas distinguishes to unite. 14Importantly, this is a conception of God that Aquinas shares; Winters also shares it- through Aquinass influence- but wishes to limit speculation on its consequences. 1 Frederick L. Morey, in a highly eccentric and nondoctrinaire series of articles, has deployed Kant as a hermeneutic key to Dickinsons poems much as New does Kierkegaard. Each section of his tripartite essay corresponds to the respective Critique of Kant. 16Powell summarizes Winterss position thus: "Intuition and Purity, as Winters defines them, are the two characteristic forms of modern depravation of Being: Intuition is a necessary but incomplete mode of perception, and Purity the characteristic possessed by certain deprived- and, indeed, unimaginable- kinds of experience. Mind is the means to recovery and to the realization of human potentiality" (39). 17Another reading of this stanza suggests that the speaker would pay all her atoms, i.e. everything except "Immortality." This she would "reserve" so that, having lost all else in the world, she might still win immortal life. This does not change the essential sense of the poem. The necessary absurdity of "Immortality" as a discrete possession remains. 18It is worth restating here that Aquinass inquiry into the demonstrability of Gods existence specifically requires that the effects of God, who is their cause, must always be inadequate revelations of his essence. Thus, in a less systematic way, we could argue that Dickinson is operating within a Thomistic rather than a</page><page sequence="24">420 James Matthew Wilson Kierkegaardian framework. Winters wouldn't have fully appreciated this because a) some neo-Thomistic writings support his reading-of-exclusion, b) as we have observed, he was a typical "secular" Thomist, less interested in knowledge of God than a system of natural reason (i.e. he liked philosophy not theology), and c) Kierkegaard probably offers a more complete analysis of what Dickinson herself was trying to achieve, even if we could sufficiently grasp her various strategies within a purely Thomistic framework. On this last point, to recap, we see the division between Kierkegaard's phenomenology of the subjective attempt to comprehend an elusive God and the "objective" mystical theology of writers in the Augustinián tradition who use the deconstruction of language in apophatic theology not to represent existential anguish, but the ineffable experience of faith and the beatific vision. *19This is only a partial definition of Winters's perceptions of Dickinson. He in fact did see her as a critic of Emerson all but through-and-through. Again, her recognition of the cleavage between humanity and nature proved that to him. He simply remained unconvinced that she had fully internalized the critique he saw occurring in many, but not all, of her poems. 20Richard E. Brantley compellingly argues that it is precisely Dickinson's attention to the difficult continuity between natural and religious experience that makes her a romantic poet: "Dickinson the Romantic understands faith empirically and non-empirically- that is, she affirms a continuum joining one kind of meaning to the other. In an age when seeing had almost the religious quality of believing, she found grounds for faith in the things she naturally saw" (155). My argument is not to distance Dickinson from Romanticism per se , but rather, from later readings (including Winters's) of Emerson and Blake that would suggest the Romantics collapsed the supernatural or divine into the inner authenticity of the individual person.
