<plain_text><page sequence="1">BOOK LIST philology in the "notes" (Murphy is usually conservative about textual emenda- tion, finding the chief difficulty in elucidating the work's often obscure vocabulary), whereas the "interpretation", both introductory and verse-by-verse, is concise by comparison. Murphy has published articles on the Song of Songs at regular intervals since 1954. This commentary, which represents the mature fruit of a lifetime's study, is a distinguished contribution to a prestigious series. [H.G.M. WILLIAMSON] L.

NIEHR, Rechtsprechung in Israel. Untersuchungen zur Geschichte der Gerichtsorganisation im Alten Testament. Stuttgarter Bibelstudien 130. 144 pp. Verlag Katholisches Bibelwerk, Stuttgart, 1987. DM 29.80. There have been many studies of O.T. law and its relationship to law in the rest of the ancient Near East, but surprisingly few on the processes of law and the organization of courts of justice. A monograph which deals exclusively with these latter topics is therefore particularly welcome, the more so because of the widespread use of legal ter- minology in biblical literature generally. Niehr begins with a brief consideration of general studies of legal systems and the methodological problems raised by the O.T. source-material. An account of the different legal systems attested at Mari, in Assyria and Babylon and in the remainder of Syria and Canaan then provides the context for a study of the development of legal institutions in Israel. In the "egalitarian tribal society" of the pre-monarchic period (for which Exod. xx 22- xxiii 19 is argued to provide some reliable information) Niehr holds that the pater- familias and the elders (representatives of the heads of clans) dealt with most cases, though some were referred to priests for resolution by ritual means. He finds no solid evidence for the existence of individual "judge"-figures at this time. The monarchy at first brought about only minor changes to this system, as the king's jurisdiction was limited to his immediate entourage. Only under Josiah were state judges introduced to replace the priestly jurisdiction at the defunct "high places". After the exile the "heads of fathers' houses", representing the clans, took over the roles previously exercised by the elders and paterfamilias, and the legal authority of the Jerusalem priesthood was greatly augmented. The imperial authorities were generally content not to intervene. A bibliography and an index of biblical references complete a work which offers both a synthesis of earlier study and a provocative fresh reconstruction of Israelite legal history. [G.I. DAVIES] S. OLOFSSON, God is my Rock: A Study of Translation Technique and Theological Exegesis in the Septuagint. Coniectane Biblica, Old Testament Series 31. x + 208 pp. Almqvist &amp; Wiksell International, Stockholm, 1990. S. Kr. 178. This is a revised version of an Uppsala dissertation (1988). While the author has much to say about theological exegesis in the LXX in general, he is mainly interested in the Psalter. Ch. 2 deals with claimed instances of anti-anthropomorphism and anti-anthropopathism in the Greek Psalter and concedes much less to theological exegesis than have Olofsson's predecessors in this area. Most of the spadework for the volume is done in the longer chs 3 and 5, in which the translation of metaphorical designations of God ("rock", "shield", "refuge", etc.) and dif- ferent types of metaphorical divine names ("mighty One", "most high", etc.), respectively, are discussed. The last of the main chapters looks at possible backgrounds for the translation of divine names and epithets in the LXX. The work is thoroughly indexed, and there are six tables setting out translation equivalents under a number of headings. The author shows awareness of a wide 287</page><page sequence="2">BOOK LIST range of translation issues of a generally theoretical nature as well as of those that are case-specific to the LXX. Whether his organizational and presentational skills match the general quality of his work is a question that this reviewer hesitates to attempt to answer. One thing is clear: the attribution of theological motivation to the Greek translators is more frequently made than, as this knowledgeable study shows, is actually warranted. [R.P. GORDON] F.

Previous volumes of this work were noted in VT 31 (1981), p. 380; 33 (1983), p. 231; 34 (1984), p. 381; 37 (1987), p. 382; 40 (1990), p. 370. The method used in this volume, which com- pletes the set, is described on pp. 9-11 by Emilia Fernandez Tejero, who worked with Carmen Muiioz Abad, Maria Teresa Ortega Monasterio and Maria Josefa de Azcarraga Servert. The first index (pp. 13-286) contains a list of the relevant Hebrew words arranged according to the Hebrew alphabet, and the second (pp. 289-308) a list of proper names. The Hebrew words are followed by the biblical references and by a reference to the Masora magna or Masora parva or both. [J.A.E.] H.D. PREufi, Theologie des Alten Testaments 1: JHWHs erwdhlendes und ver- pflichtendes Handeln. viii + 330 pp. W. Kohlhammer, Stuttgart, 1991. Preufi in- troduces this first part of a planned two-volume Theology of the O.T. with a discussion of the problems of method and organization of such a venture. He il- lustrates these primarily by a history of research since J.P. Gabler's 1787 in- augural lecture and argues that there remains a need for a synthesizing, descriptive theology. This is to be distinguished from a history of Israelite religion while its concerns must be determined by the material itself rather than by exter- nally imposed agenda. Preufi also upholds the validity of searching for a "centre of the O.T." ("Mitte des AT") around which to organize a Theology, and pro- poses for this "JHWHs erwihlendes Geschichtshandeln an Israel zur Gemein- schaft mit seiner Welt, das zugleich ein dieses Volk (und die V6lker) verpflichtendes Handeln ist" (p. 29). Four chapters of very varying length then begin to unpack this statement. The first looks at election itself, and the second analyses the relationship between election and obligation (Exodus and Sinai, law, etc.). The third chapter deals with the names, character and activities of the "elec- ting" God, and the fourth describes briefly both God's own world and dwelling places and the realms from which he is considered absent. Copious references are included throughout in order to facilitate use of the work as a text-book, and there is also generous coverage of secondary literature in the footnotes. Many word studies are included in the course of the discussion so that, thanks to the full in- dexes with which the volume concludes, it will also serve as a useful work of reference. (H.G.M.
