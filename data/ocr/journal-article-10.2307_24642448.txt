<plain_text><page sequence="1">LAUGHING LIKE A CHILD IN TWO MAYAKOVSKY POEMS James H. McGavran III, Rutgers University 1. According to Vladimir Mayakovsky's stylized and at times tendentious au tobiography «Я сам [I Myself]» [1928], the uniqueness of his sense of humor was impressed upon the poet at an early age. As he writes in the section enti tled «1-е Воспоминание [1st Memory]»: Отец выписал журнал «Родина». У «Родины» «юмористическое» приложение. О смешных говорят и ждут. [...] «Родина» пришла. Раскрываю и сразу (картинка) ору: «Как смешно! Дядя с тетей целуются». Смеялись. Позднее, когда пришло приложение и надо было действительно смеяться, выяснилось—раньше смеялись только надо мной. Так разошлись наши понятия о картинках и о юморе. (Maiakovskii 1:10)' Father subscribed to the journal Homeland. Homeland had a "humor" supplement. Everyone was talking about the funnies and waiting. [...] Homeland arrived. I opened it and immediately (a picture) I bawled out: "How funny! The man and the lady are kissing." Everyone laughed. Later, when the supplement came and we really had to laugh, it became clear—earlier they had only been laughing at me. And so our concepts of pictures and of humor diverged.2 If we take Mayakovsky at his word—and he wouldn't seem here to have any pressing reason to embellish or mythologize—this means that for as long as he could remember, he was a stand-alone figure with regard to humor: he found it where others did not, or rather, he created it where others were un able or unprepared to see it. His understanding of laughter, moreover, was split into two distinct spheres: the adult and the children's, the official and the unofficial, the public and the private. Adult, official laughter was the laughter of a depersonalized group at an individual, and children's laughter entailed a sort of acting out or performance (even if unintentional). Though one does not detect in his "1st Memory" any explicit rejection of adult laughter—the young The author gratefully acknowledges contributions from his wife, Cherie Braden, and two anonymous external reviewers of an earlier version of this essay. 1.

At any rate, given his family's response to his initial outburst upon opening the magazine, he could not help but become suspicious of group laughter. Individual opposition to mob laughter emerges as a central theme in two of Mayakovsky's poems of the 1910s, «Скрипка и немножко нервно» [Violin and a Bit Nervously, 1914]3 and «Хорошее отношение к лошадям» [Being Good to Horses, 1918]. In both poems, Mayakovsky allies himself as speaker with a lone victim of widespread scorn, offering idiosyncratic consolations that utilize his own humor—a humor steeped in the language and attitudes of childhood—as an antidote to and shield from vicious laughter.4 Viewed as de pictions of public laughter and Mayakovsky's private response to it, the poems provide interesting commentary on the theories of Charles Baudelaire and Henri Bergson. Baudelaire's 1855 essay, "Of the Essence of Laughter, and Generally of the Comic in the Plastic Arts," is full of connections to Mayakovsky's oeuvre as a whole—especially his satire—and its relevance seems all the more appropriate in light of Baudelaire's importance to Maya kovsky's early poetic development.5 Baudelaire describes laughter as a satanic phenomenon, the result of humankind's conflicted response to its place in a hierarchy of created beings: In man [laughter] is the consequence of his idea of his own superiority; and in fact, since laughter is essentially human it is essentially contradictory, that is to say it is at one and the same time a sign of infinite greatness and of infinite wretchedness, infinite wretchedness in relation to the absolute being, of whom man has an inkling, infinite greatness in relation to the beasts. (148) The laughing mobs in both poems mentioned above certainly feel superior to their victims, and Baudelaire's mention of human superiority to animals has 3. Perhaps a better translation of the title, and in any case a great find, is "Violin: Poco Agi tato" (Markov and Sparks 531). It loses, however, the original's jarring and incongruous pair ing of noun with adverb, and the idea of incongruous pairs is quite important in the poem. 4. Zinovy Paperny also compares these two poems in his 1961 study Poeticheskii obraz и Maiakovskogo [The Poetic Image in Mayakovsky], noting their narrative and geographical sim ilarities (both are set on Moscow's Kuznetsky Most). He finds the poems' differences more sig nificant, though, arguing that the lyrical hero's seeming success in the later poem ("Being Good") stems from Mayakovsky's improved mindset in the months immediately after the Oc tober Revolution (87-88). I would argue that the success of the speaker's intervention in "Being Good" is far from unequivocal and that the poems are in fact similar in their ambiguous, guard edly optimistic outcomes. 5. Nikolai Khardzhiev and Vladimir Trenin noted Baudelaire's influence on Mayakovsky in the classic essay "Poetika rannego Maiakovskogo" (Khardzhiev 155-69). Adrian Wanner has also written of Mayakovsky's affinity for certain aspects of Baudelaire's poetics (185-86).</page><page sequence="3">Laughing Like a Child in Two Mayakovsky Poems 255 obvious resonance in "Being Good to Horses."6 Mayakovsky too recognized the cutting power of such superiority-based, hierarchical laughter, and he har nessed that power to memorable effect in his satirical and propagandistic verse; a 1929 collection of his "Rosta Windows"—propaganda posters he produced by the hundreds from 1919 to 1921—even bears the telling title «Грозный смех [Terrible Laughter]».7 In "Violin" and "Being Good," how ever, the poet explores other, more constructive possibilities of humor and laughter. In both poems, Mayakovsky's idiosyncratic interventions as speaker serve to counteract the presumptive superiority of the laughing crowds he de picts, explicitly abolishing the hierarchy they implicitly establish. His inclu sive and egalitarian whimsy in these poems finds an apt description in Baude laire's brief aside on children's laughter: "The laughter of children is like the blossoming of a flower. It is the joy of receiving, the joy of breathing, the joy of confiding, the joy of contemplating, of living, of growing up" (151). This is the laughter that erupted out of the young Mayakovsky when he saw the picture in Homeland, and it is the laughter he attempts to share with the vio lin and the horse in his poems. Laughter's lone wolf tries on the role of a lone lamb, but his success in this new role—that is, the success of the speaker's in tervention in both poems—remains ambiguous. Bergson, for his part, situates laughter almost entirely within the public, of ficial realm, seeing it as a social corrective applied to mechanistic, automa tized behavior: there remains [...] a certain rigidity of body, mind and character that society would still like to get rid of in order to obtain from its members the greatest possible degree of elasticity and so ciability. This rigidity is the comic, and laughter is its corrective. (20-21) For Bergson, just as for Baudelaire, laughter is hierarchical, but Bergson is more specific about the nature of the laugher's superiority to the laughed-at: it is the advantage of the flexible over the rigid, the attentive over the absent minded, and, by ultimate extension, the living over the dead. If Mayakovsky attempts, in these poems, to counteract and defuse all such hierarchical laugh ter with the inclusive laughter of children, he also suggests a more specific re vision to Bergson's theory by showing that laughter itself can become a dead mechanism in need of "correction." Indeed, the laughing crowds Mayakov sky depicts in these poems invert, by way of personification and metaphor, Bergson's central idea that life laughs at death: in both poems, broadly speak ing, non-life—whether inanimate objects or stylistically dehumanized peo 6. Baudelaire also explicitly references the comic effect of a man slipping and falling on ice (146). 7. In connection with the Rosta Windows, which consisted of cartoon illustrations paired with pithy, poetic captions, one might note that Mayakovsky's "1st Memory" stresses the uniqueness of his understanding of both pictures and humor. I am grateful to an anonymous re viewer for this insight.</page><page sequence="4">256 Slavic and East European Journal pie—laughs at life.8 The two poems, then, ultimately reveal laughter's posi tive and negative potential in Mayakovsky's poetics—its power to create or destroy, to unite or alienate. 2. The dominant device at work in "Violin"—or rather, the device that makes the poem's narrative possible—is enstrangement9 [ostranenie], Viktor Shklovsky's term for the ability of poetic language to make the everyday strange by describing it in a way that prevents instant, automatic recognition by the reader. Shklovsky's classic example is a passage from War and Peace in which Tolstoy describes the spectacle of an opera without identifying it (the word "opera" is not used), rendering the performers' behavior incompre hensible and almost grotesque (Shklovsky 8-9). Mayakovsky's poem too de picts a musical performance (presumably a violin concerto), but his method of enstrangement is at once more radical and less unnatural: he anthropomor phizes the instruments, transforming the concert into a series of emotional outbursts and bullying taunts.10 In a characteristic turn, however—Maya kovsky's work abounds with realized metaphors—the poetic device of en strangement becomes the basis for a narrative in which the speaker leaps on stage to defend and console the solo violin.11 Roman Jakobson describes this sort of transformation, which was common in the work of Mayakovsky and Velimir Khlebnikov, in his 1921 essay «Новейшая русская поэзия [The Latest Russian Poetry]»: «Здесь мы имеем реализацию того же тропа, проекцию литературного приема в художественную реальность, превра щение поэтического тропа в поэтический факт, сюжетное построение [Here we have the realization of the same trope, the projection of a literary device into aesthetic reality, the transformation of poetic trope into poetic fact, a plot construction]» (Jakobson 308). Depictions of mob mockery in "Violin" are at first confined to the realm of poetic devices (i.e., the world of living, talking musical instruments), but by the end of the poem, the speaker's involvement in the action creates a bridge between that world and the physi cal world of musicians, sheet music, and music stands. The latter, however, 8. My summary of Bergson's theory is shaped here by Mikhail Bakhtin's interpretation of it in the unfinished essay "K voprosam teorii smekha" [Concerning the Theory of Laughter] (Bakhtin 50). 9. "Enstrangement" is Benjamin Sher's translation of Shklovsky's term (Shklovsky 6-9). 10. Connor Doak has written recently of Mayakovsky's Modernist "epistemology of emo tion"; in an unpublished essay generously shared in correspondence with the author, Doak reads the realized metaphor at the heart of "Violin"—the poet's close identification with the passion ate, unruly instrument—as the externalization of an emotion too enormous to be confronted or processed by the psychological approach of the Russian Realists. 11. Paul Friedrich has noted that although Mayakovsky railed against opera and the guitar as symbols of old, sentimental art, he apparently had a soft spot for the violin, using it often as the tenor in metaphors (232).</page><page sequence="5">Laughing Like a Child in Two Mayakovsky Poems 257 proves to be much the same as the former, as indicated by a parallel scene of taunting. The poem ends enigmatically, with the speaker and the violin in a state of limbo, alone and together. The poem's opening lines provide its purest example of enstrangement, taking effect before the poetic trope has become a poetic fact (to use Jakob son's words). The ties to the objective reality of the concert have not yet been severed, and the psychological impact of the music is indeed conveyed orig inally enough to create a fresh perspective in the reader: Скрипка издергалась, упрашивая, The violin was beside herself with begging и вдруг разревелась and suddenly burst out crying так по-детски, so like a child что барабан не выдержал: that the drum couldn't hold back: 5 «Хорошо, хорошо, хорошо!» "Very good, very good, very good!" А сам устал, But he was tired не дослушал скрипкиной речи, and didn't stick around for the violin's speech шмыгнул на горящий Кузнецкий he stepped out onto dazzling Kuznetsky и ушел. (1:68) and was off. The failure of self-restraint and the spontaneous bursting-forth depicted here are in stark opposition to the practiced perfection typically associated with musical performance. Though the violin bursts into tears, not laughter, one is still reminded of the young Mayakovsky roaring out upon seeing the picture in Homeland: his poetic interpretation of a concert he attended a dozen years later is infused with the same childlike impatience and importunity. Indeed, as the speaker sees (and hears) it, it is the very childishness of the violin's out burst—rather than the notes printed on a page of music—that prompts the drum to play along. Mayakovsky's chosen vantage point as an interpreter or translator of the instruments' sounds effectively draws the reader out of the adult decorum of the concert setting—where instruments, musicians, and au dience all understand and fulfill time-honored roles—and into a more child like, elemental, and visceral understanding of music.12 The most immediately striking formal feature of the poem's opening lines is their sparsity of rhyme, with the first rhyme pair (po-detski/Kuznetskii) completed only in the eighth line. The marginal near-rhyme provided by line 7's "rechi" should no doubt be added to that pair,13 in which case an unusual, five-line stanza structure emerges in the first nine stolbik line fragments. The 12. If we can again trust Mayakovsky's autobiography, his distaste for the stuffy atmosphere of classical concerts seems to have played an important role in Russian literary history: in the sections entitled «В Курилке [In the Smoking-Room]» and «Памятнейшая ночь [A Most Memorable Night]», he describes fleeing the "melodized boredom [melodizirovannaia skuka]" of a Rachmaninoff concert to discuss art and literature with David Burliuk (1:19). Though Rus sian Futurism was not, as Mayakovsky claims, born that night, his discussion with Burliuk may indeed have had a significant effect on his own artistic and poetic development (Mayakovsky goes on to claim that he wrote his first real lines of poetry the following day, 1:20). 13. It may be significant that the interplay of consonants in rechi and Kuznetskii suggests the word kuznechik [grasshopper], an insect whose method of music-making is similar to a violin's.</page><page sequence="6">258 Slavic and East European Journal rhyme scheme of this macro-stanza is AbAAb, but its rhythmic cohesion is much less clear, and a distinct impression of formlessness emerges in the opening of the poem. This negative device focuses the reader's attention on the music of the concert, for the most poetically organized lines in the open ing are those devoted to describing the instruments' sounds. Of these, the drum's direct quote, «Хорошо, хорошо, хорошо! [Very good, very good, very good!]», is central. The line's three repeated anapests nicely reproduce the rat-a-tat rhythm of a snare drum, while also introducing a kind of mecha nistic semantic reduction common to all the instruments' and musicians' lines of dialogue in the poem: in what may be a reminder of their inanimate, ma chine nature—as we shall see, the musicians are not much more alive than their instruments—the meaning of their words is subordinated to the plodding rhythms of their speech (anapests for the drum, trochees for the helicon, and dactyls for the musicians).14 Grigory Vinokur has pointed out Mayakovsky's tendency to form posses sive adjectives from nouns that do not normally produce them—such as skrip kinoi [the violin's] in line 7—and explained it as a corollary to the poet's frequent personification of inanimate objects (44). As Vinokur writes, «Поэти ческая цель подобного словоупотребления совершенно прозрачна и продиктована Маяковскому общим его стремлением к уничтожению 'разницы между лицом и вещью' [The poetic aim of such usage is perfectly transparent and dictated to Mayakovsky by his general striving to eliminate 'the difference between person and thing']» (45). This poetic confounding of the animate/inanimate binary, shown here at both the linguistic and thematic levels, thrusts the reader back into early developmental stages of childhood when such distinctions are not yet calcified, opening new possibilities for meaningful connection and interaction (not to mention lexical innovation). The middle of "Violin" (lines 10-18) depicts the orchestra turning against the solo violin as her emotional outburst continues: 10 Оркестр чужо смотрел, как The orchestra looked on like strangers as выплакивалась скрипка the violin had her cry out без слов, without words, без такта, without tact, и только где-то and only somewhere 15 глупая тарелка a stupid cymbal вылязгивапа: clanged out: «Что это?» "What's that?" «Как это?» (1:68) "How's that?" The key word here is chuzho [in the manner of a stranger]: the orchestra stops looking at the violin as one of its own—the word in Russian can also mean 14. Paperny too points to the mechanical quality of the instruments' and musicians' speech, seeing the contrast between their clanging and the emotional outbursts of the violin and speaker as an externalization of the conflict between the everyday and the poetic (43).</page><page sequence="7">Laughing Like a Child in Two Mayakovsky Poems 259 "someone else's" or "alien, foreign"15—and begins to reach the level of emo tional detachment necessary, according to Bergson, for collective laughter.16 In Baudelaire's terms, this is the moment when the other instruments assume a sense of superiority to the violin and begin to distance themselves from it. Mayakovsky, however, resists these reflex movements away from the con spicuously suffering victim and is in fact drawn closer and closer to the vio lin. His use of enstrangement in the opening lines thrusts the reader out of the audience and into the music, but now it becomes clear that the orchestra is moving in the opposite direction: they are migrating, in terms of their attitude and behavior, past the footlights and into the audience. This transformation is supported formally by phonetic links between the orchestra [orkestr] and the act of watching [smotrel, как]—that is, as opposed to participating (playing). Accordingly, the violin's solo is described by means of a pun in the Rus sian— takt translates as either "(musical) measure, time" or "tact"—that unites the lexicons of music and adult, genteel society. Both meanings apply here: the violin wails without rhythmic precision (which might be seen as the musical equivalent of tact or politeness), and that wailing is seen as tactless by the other members of the orchestra.17 The clarification, "without words," though hardly necessary from a mundane point of view (violins do not speak), also imposes adult societal norms onto pure music and underlines an interest ing opposition: the violin is the only instrument mentioned by name in the poem whose melodies are not translated into speech by the poet. Paradoxi cally, it is in the violin's wordless music that the poet sees the clearest paral lel to his own art, a point made implicitly here through the language he uses to describe it: «разревелась / так по-детски [howled out / so like a child]», «выплакивалась [had her cry out]», «без такта [without tact]»—all could be used to describe moods and attitudes present in Mayakovsky's poetic per sona.18 The poet's close personal identification with the violin is made ex plicit later in the text. The narrative of the musical instruments reaches its climax as the violin is ridiculed by a helicon, which brings about the poem's major turn, in the emer gence and involvement of the speaker: 15. To my knowledge, the adverbial form used in the poem (from the adjective chuzhoi) is a neologism, albeit a fairly tame one. Thus Mayakovsky injected a measure of strangeness or oth erness into the word itself. 16. "Indifference is its natural environment, for laughter has no greater foe than emotion [...]. To produce the whole of its effect, then, the comic demands something like a momentary anes thesia of the heart" (Bergson 4-5). 17. I chose to translate the word as "tact" because I think it best captures the overall effect of the pun, but the musical definition should probably be seen as primary. 18. The paradox of a poetry without words dates back at least to Paul Verlaine's 1874 collec tion Romances sans paroles [Songs without Words] and would have appealed to Mayakovsky's Futurist sensibilities, particularly in a poem so explicitly concerned with music.</page><page sequence="8">260 Slavic and East European Journal А когда геликон— But when the helicon— 20 меднорожий, brass-faced, потный, sweaty, крикнул: cried out: «Дура, "Fool, плакса, crybaby, 25 вытри!»— wipe up [your tears]!"— я встал, I got up, шатаясь полез через ноты, reeling, clambered through the sheet-music, сгибающиеся под ужасом пюпитры [...] the music-stands bowing in terror [...] (1:68) Here the original premise of enstrangement has almost completely faded into the background of the narrative it engendered, and the reader is unlikely to think of the helicon's outburst as just another melodic line in the concert (though that may be exactly what it is). Instead, the horn's words suggest that the orchestra has moved still further along its strangely anti-musical trajec tory, away from the stage and the violin, devolving from an inert audience into an ill-behaved mob. The adjectives used to describe the helicon, med norozhii [brass-mugged]19 and potnyi [sweaty], together with his bold out burst, suggest a crude, unruly drunk. His speech takes the rhythmically monotonous form of three trochees—«Дура, / плакса, / вытри! [Fool, / cry baby, / wipe up!»—three ugly, abusive words spat out like a bully's taunts against the measureless, wordless outflow of emotion from the violin.20 The speaker's entrance in line 26 would seem to create a clear line of de marcation in the poem. The human world encroaches on the world of music and indeed supplants it: from this point forward, there are no more en stranged, verbal translations of musical phrases. The speaker himself, how ever, remains a liminal figure, privy to both worlds and eager to play up the connections available to him. His intervention in the concert is as impulsive as the violin's initial outburst, if a bit more self-aware: [...] зачем-то крикнул: [...] for some reason cried out: 30 «Боже!», "My God!" Бросился на деревянную шею: Threw my arms around the wooden neck: «Знаете что, скрипка? "You know what, violin? Мы ужасно похожи: We're terribly alike: я вот тоже you see, I also 35 ору— bawl out— а доказать ничего не умею!» (1:69) but can't prove anything!" As this passage makes clear, the essence of Mayakovsky's consolation tech nique is to find and emphasize similarities between himself and the victim of 19. Though I used "brass-faced" in my translation above to avoid the pun on "mug," the use of the colloquial rozha [mug in the sense of face] is typical of Mayakovsky and important here due to its common association with drinking (e.g,,p'ianaia rozha [drunk mug], etc.). 20. It is hard not to agree with Stephen Mulrine's summary assessment of "Violin" as a poem ultimately concerned with Mayakovsky's "strained relationship with his public" (162).</page><page sequence="9">Laughing Like a Child in Two Mayakovsky Poems 261 scorn or laughter. He is careful not to place himself above the victim in any way, even grammatically: he uses the formal you when addressing the violin (an unusual choice we will encounter again in "Being Good"), in marked con trast to the helicon's rude and informal taunt, vy tri! [wipe up!]. Opening him self up to the violin, the speaker harks back to the distinction made earlier in the poem between the violin, which wails "without words, / without tact," and the rest of the instruments, which speak in comprehensible, if repetitive and mechanical, human language. His complaint that he "can't prove anything" calls to mind a frustrated child's inability to get a point across successfully in the adult world of carefully chosen words, reason, and proof. The pairing of poetry with music is reflected concretely and physically—another realized metaphor—in the embrace of the speaker and the violin, an embrace that seems almost to create a new joint entity. Their embrace also represents a fur ther confounding of the animate/inanimate binary, with the pun on "neck [,sheia]" (i.e., the neck of a string instrument or a person) serving as a crossover or nexus. Most importantly, the poet's voice is now attached to the violin, even em anating from it. This idea is reinforced by formal devices at work in the lines, especially rhyme. Almost every line of the speaker's outburst has a rhyme pair, and some of the cadences echo both forward and backward to more dis tant line-endings, creating a poetic reproduction of resonance or musical rep etition: kriknul in line 29 echoes the same word in line 22; the rhyme pair of sheiu/umeiu (lines 31 and 36) finds an immediate ripple-effect in line 37's smeiutsia; skripka in line 32 forms the upper slice of bread in a long-distance rhyme sandwich with Vlip как! (line 38) in the middle and another skripka (line 43) on bottom; and, most strikingly, the trio of Bozhe/pokhozhi/tozhe (lines 30 and 33-34) reaches back ten lines to mednorozhii in line 20 and for ward twelve lines to khoroshii in line 42. This proliferation of rhyme and sound-play, as compared to the rhyme-poor opening of the poem and even its more standard middle section, indicates that there has been a change in the speaker's poetic voice since his contact with the violin—that something new has been created by their union. The final section of the poem contains an explicit reference to laughter, as the musicians poke fun at the poet-speaker: Музыканты смеются: The musicians laugh: «Влип как! "He's really stuck his foot in it! Пришел к деревянной невесте! He's come to his wooden bride! 40 Голова!» The dummy!" А мне—наплевать! But I—don't give a damn! Я—хороший. I'm a good guy. «Знаете что, скрипка? "You know what, violin? Давайте— Let's— 45 будем жить вместе! you and I live together! А?» (1:69) Ah?"</page><page sequence="10">262 Slavic and East European Journal The appearance of the musicians suggests that the poem will now focus on the objective reality of the concert hall rather than the enstranged world of musical instruments and their drama. The musicians' taunts, however, bear a striking formal and thematic resemblance to the cries of the instruments in the first half of the poem, revealing that the musicians, though human, have more in common with their instruments (excluding the violin) than with the poet. The musicians' words in lines 38-39—«Влип как! / Пришел к деревянной невесте! [He's really stuck his foot in it! / He's come to his wooden bride!]»—scan as one dactylic macro-line with every possible ictus realized, recalling an analogous effect with trochees in the helicon's speech and creat ing a similarly plodding, mechanized feel. When compared to the speaker's breathless fits and starts, with their dashes and their choppy unpredictability, the musicians' remarks seem like the work of a machine. Their line «Влип как! [Stuck his foot in it!]» also recalls the helicon's rhythmically identical «вытри! [wipe up!]»: both lines are fresh and unusual finds in terms of rhyme, but more importantly, both lines leave something unsaid and lend to the poem's ambiguities. The result of the poet's intervention in the concert is an important final point to consider. He throws himself into action on behalf of the violin, who is fast becoming a victim of scorn, if not yet laughter. His deeply-ingrained, me-against-the-world understanding of laughter kicks in, and his eccentric behavior brings the concert to an end, focusing all attention on him. His in tervention can in fact be seen as a stealing of the limelight, a celebration of himself more than an effort to support the violin; much like the young Mayakovsky in "1st Memory," the speaker is clearly acting out. Whatever his motivation, he is soon subjected to alienation and scorn—plus public laugh ter—analogous to what was endured by the violin. Being in the spotlight, however, seems to give him new energy, and the bond he quickly forms with the violin is impervious to the musicians' taunting: «А мне—наплевать! / Я—хороший [But I—don't give a damn! / I'm a good guy]». The puffed-up defiance of these lines is a child's defiance in the face of a group of bullies— they call to mind the common admonishment «не трогай меня, я хороший [leave me alone, I'm a good guy]»21—and the speaker's intervention is thus likened, in the end, to an alliance formed in the playground or sandbox. The bombastic optimism of the end of the poem, however, is overshadowed by a crucial ambiguity: we do not know the violin's response to the speaker's pro posal. The fundamental incompatibility of the respective realities to which violin and speaker belong may triumph over their similarities. Mayakovsky, with characteristic pluck, twists the Symbolists' call for a merger between po etry and music—distilled in Verlaine's celebrated instruction: «De la musique 21. For this insight on bullying in Russia I am grateful to an anonymous reader of an earlier version of this essay.</page><page sequence="11">Laughing Like a Child in Two Mayakovsky Poems 263 avant toute chose»22—into a simple offer of cohabitation, but even so, the merger remains elusive. The poet's voice and self-assertion bring the music to an abrupt halt, so the violin is in fact unable to respond. The tension be tween overstated, public optimism and underlying ambiguity also marks the conclusion of "Being Good." 3. "Being Good" was written in the late spring of 1918, a time when Mayakovsky was not producing a great deal of verse. The poems he did com plete were overtly political—e.g., «Наш марш [Our March]» and «Ода революции [Ode to the Revolution]»—and it is in this context that "Being Good" is typically read, as a kind of pep talk to a nation reeling from revolu tions, civil war, and famine.23 Mayakovsky's love for animals provided one inspiration for the poem; as he wrote in a letter to Lily Brik in April or May, 1918, «Стихов не пишу, хотя и хочется очень написать что-нибудь прочувственное про лошадь [I'm not writing any verse, though I really want to write something heartfelt about a horse]» (2:491).24 In addition to the personal and political motives Mayakovsky had to write about kindness to horses, however, he also had a literary motive: to create a poetic response to treatments of the same theme by Nikolai Nekrasov and Fyodor Dostoevsky. These source texts—the «До сумерек [Before Dusk]» section of Nekrasov's poetic cycle «О погоде [On the Weather]» (1858-1865), and Raskolnikov's first dream in Dostoevsky's Crime and Punishment [1866, Part I, ch. v]—de pict public beatings of overworked old horses in which their protagonists are unwilling or unable to intervene.25 Mayakovsky's main narrative innovation is the fact that the speaker in his poem does step in and console the offended horse, but no less important is his thematic substitution of public laughter and humiliation for physical battery. Here again, as in "Violin," the poet defies 22. The line is from the poem "Art poétique [The Art of Poetry]" (Verlaine 123). 23. Edward J. Brown, for example, interprets the poem's apparent faith in the ability of one suffering being to help another as a step forward from Mayakovsky's solipsistic pre-revolution ary verse, seeing the poet's newfound optimism as a result of the October Revolution (188-89). Viktor Pertsov identifies the struggles of the horse in Mayakovsky's poem with those of the na tion: «Образ невыносимой тяжести обобщен поэтом в картине заурядного уличного происшествия, образ, как-то связанный с тем, что переживал весь народ [The image of an unbearable burden is generalized by the poet in this commonplace street scene—an image somehow connected with what the entire nation was going through]» (Pertsov 29). Lawrence Stahlberger goes even further, seeing the horse as a stand-in for all creation: "The suffering of the fallen horse encompasses the suffering of all creatures—of man and animal" (85). 24. Katherine Lahti has argued recently for a less dismissive attitude toward Mayakovsky's well-documented love for animals. She interprets "Being Good" as "the best example of the suf fering animal in Mayakovsky's oeuvre" (146), noting the poem's debt to Dostoevsky and de scribing the process by which Mayakovsky identifies with his equine protagonist (148^19). 25. The horse as a topic in writers including Nekrasov, Tolstoy, Saltykov-Shchedrin, Dosto evsky, and Mayakovsky has been examined by M. Gin.</page><page sequence="12">264 Slavic and East European Journal and explicitly denies the hierarchy assumed by the laughing mob, countering their gawking and their guffaws with strange and disarmingly naïve words of consolation that make the horse feel like a young foal again. If, in Baude laire's terms, Mayakovsky again finds the antidote to destructive, satanic laughter in the inclusive language and worldview of childhood, his descrip tion of the mob also provides a specific objection to Bergson's theory: they, not the horse, are the automatons, and theirs is the mechanized behavior. Moreover, the laughing crowd is allied by means of various poetic devices to the sinister, anthropomorphized figure of Kuznetsky Most (the same Moscow street mentioned in "Violin"), in effect becoming nothing more than its ap pendage. Mayakovsky's poem thus depicts a confrontation between life, as represented by the duo of horse and speaker, and non-life, in the conglomer ate of street and laughers. Mayakovsky opens "Being Good" with a strikingly alliterative and ono matopoeic description of the sound of horse hooves echoing on pavement: Били копыта, Hooves were beating, Пели будто: as if singing: —Гриб. "Grip. Грабь. Grab. 5 Гроб. Grope. Груб.—(2:10) Group." The poem's first word, Bili [were beating], immediately evokes the scenes of human cruelty toward animals central to Nekrasov and Dostoevsky's texts. The second word, however, makes clear that Mayakovsky's horse is beating rather than being beaten, already suggesting that his poem may be intended as a sort of rebuttal or amendment to the earlier works. The description of the hooves' song that follows could be seen as a sort of impediment to automa tized reading or an introduction to the complex and multivalent world of po etic language. Semantically, the four lines read "Mushroom. / Pillage. / Coffin. / [Is] crude," but before reaching the end of this disconnected inventory, one realizes that its modulating sound-play clearly outweighs its meaning. The au ditory enstrangement in this poem functions in the opposite direction from that in "Violin": in the earlier poem, pure sound (music) became semantically charged words in the poet's imagination, whereas here, semantically charged words become pure sound. As usual, however, Mayakovsky is not just using enstrangement for its own sake: he is placing a semantic reading of the lines at odds with the strictly phonetic and giving preference to the latter. Although there is no concrete connection between the words in terms of meaning, to gether they paint a rather dreary picture. Furthermore, the images evoked by this literal reading of Mayakovsky's lines correspond well to the atmosphere of cruelty, death, and crudity in Dostoevsky's nightmarish treatment of the theme. Phonetically, however, the lines have an amusing lilt to them—one might note young children's predilection for the bilabial consonants b and</page><page sequence="13">Laughing Like a Child in Two Mayakovsky Poems 265 p26—and their vowel modulation, a technique known as internal declension, mimics the shifting pitch of the horse's hooves striking the pavement. The second verse paragraph gives a visual backdrop to the sound imagery provided in the first: 7 Ветром опита, By wind drunk dry, льдом обута, in ice shod, улица скользила. (2:10) the street was slipping. Although neither Nekrasov nor Dostoevsky is very specific about the weather in his treatment of the horse theme, both use the word udushlivyi [stifling, suf focating], suggesting the heat of summer, and both set their tales of cruelty to animals in the country (Nekrasov 179, Dostoevskii 60). Mayakovsky, how ever, chooses a winter, urban landscape and transfers some of the traits of the Muscovites inhabiting his scene (drunkenness and footwear) to the street it self. This seemingly playful or even arbitrary anthropomorphism of the street—Mayakovsky's work abounds in such transferred epithets, and his urban imagery is often endowed with a monstrous kind of life—is themati cally important here in light of the more explicit allegiance to be formed be tween the crowd of gawkers and Kuznetsky Most later in the poem. The poem's narrative begins quite literally with a bang: 10 Лошадь на круп The horse on its croup грохнулась [...] (2:10) fell with a crash [...] Though the poet uses colloquial language to describe the horse's fall, and there is something playful about the rhyme pair grub/krup [crude/croup], the description is straightforward. No judgment on the part of the speaker is re vealed, and no poetic tropes such as metaphor or significant sound-play are used. It is thus possible to conclude that the speaker's later response is deter mined less by the event of the horse's fall and more by the crowd's reaction to it: [...] и сразу за зевакой зевака, штаны пришедшие Кузнецким клешить, 15 сгрудились, смех зазвенел и зазвякал: —Лошадь упала! — —Упала лошадь! — Смеялся Кузнецкий. (2:10) [...] and right away gawker after gawker, come to bellbottom their pants along Kuznetsky, 26. I mention the consonant p and use it in my transliteration of the lines because the voiced b's at the end of the Russian words (with the exception of line 4's Grab', in which the b is palatalized) are pronounced as voiceless p's.</page><page sequence="14">266 Slavic and East European Journal 15 crowded round; laughter rang out and jangled out: "The horse fell!" "A horse fell!" Kuznetsky laughed. It is this section of the poem that provides a compelling counterpoint to Berg son's theory of the comic, for here laughter itself is automatized; the behav ior of the gawkers is mindless and mechanical. The etymology of the Russian word zevaka [idler, gaper, gawker] lends interesting resonance to this point: the verb zevat', from which it is derived, generally means "to yawn" or "to gape," but it can also mean "to miss something." It is used, for example, to describe making a mistake in chess or other games of skill (with the noun zevok meaning "yawn" or "blunder"). The word zevaka itself, then, contains the suggestion that the gawkers are making a mistake, that they are gaping and staring without really seeing—an idea that the speaker reinforces more explicitly later in the poem.27 Although it resists definitive interpretation, line 14 («штаны пришедшие Кузнецким клешить [come to bellbottom their pants along Kuznetsky]») is clear in its objectification of the crowd of gawkers and in its close semantic pairing of the crowd with the inanimate street. The people are identified only by their bellbottomed trousers and their general idleness. The use of the in strumental case in the line, most likely an instrumental of space (the gawkers proceed along or by means o/Kuznetsky street), creates a close grammatical bond between the crowd and the street—a bond that would have been weaker had a structure with a preposition been used. It is also possible, however, that the instrumental is one of comparison, suggesting that the gawkers are flaring their pants around in the manner o/Kuznetsky; this could be a continuation of the personification of the street begun in lines 7-9 or a reference to some flared or bellbottom quality the poet perceived in the visual expanse of the street. In fact, it is likely that both functions of the instrumental are implied to some degree.28 In any case, the gawkers are described essentially as ap pendages of the street. The speaker conveys the sound of the crowd's laughter via the harsh sonic image of jangling bells ringing out; in Mayakovsky's poem, as noted before, laughter takes the place of the physical beatings administered to horses in Nekrasov's and Dostoevsky's texts. Thanks to the rhyme pair zevaka!zazviakal [gawker/jangled out], this ringing, mocking laughter is linked to the semantic 27. It may be relevant that the sound of the letter к alone is purported by some to create a comic effect (Raskin 19). For this reason and for its overall phonetic similarity to the Russian, I have chosen "gawker" over other equivalents to zevaka. 28. Krystyna Pomorska has noted that the instrumental case's dynamism and wide range of meaning (it is the most ambiguous of Russian cases) made it philosophically important to many Modernist poets, including Mayakovsky, Pasternak, and Khlebnikov (17-19).</page><page sequence="15">Laughing Like a Child in Two Mayakovsky Poems 267 complex comprising gawking, yawning, and making a mistake; the mindless ness of the crowd's laughter is stressed. Their exclamations—«—Лошадь упала! —/—Упала лошадь! — [The horse fell! / A horse fell!]»—form a sim ple chiasmus reminiscent of children's repetitive taunts, again calling to mind playground bullying and reminding us as readers that hierarchical conceptions of laughter are forced upon us at an early age. The speaker's entrance in lines 20-24 recalls his impulsive intervention in "Violin," reinforcing the uniqueness of the poet's lone-lamb role: 20 Лишь один я I alone голос свой не вмешивал в вой ему. did not mix my voice in the howl to him. Подошел I approached и вижу and see глаза лошадиные... (2:10) the horse's eyes... As in "Violin," though here much more explicitly, the speaker refuses to join in the general uproar and scorn; the redundantly emphatic «Лишь один я [Only I alone]» underlines his individualism. That Mayakovsky does not lend his voice to the crowd's howl is significant, for his voice was, in a sense, his all; his poetry is filled with references to its power, and it often stands in metonymically for the poet. The gawkers, by contrast, have no voices of their own, but instead send up a collective, animalistic howl to the street. The image of a pack of dogs howling at the moon contributes further to the dehu manization of the gawkers and stresses the blind, mechanical nature of their behavior. The behavior of the speaker, on the other hand, is measured and de liberate, even strangely so: «Подошел / и вижу / глаза лошадиные [I ap proached / and see / the equine eyes]». Though such combinations of verb tenses are not as unusual in Russian as in English, the lines still ring strange enough to represent a conscious decision on the part of the poet: by putting the verb "to see" in the present tense, the speaker emphasizes that he sees, whereas the gawkers gape without seeing.29 As in "Violin," the speaker phys ically separates himself from the crowd of onlookers and draws near to their victim, to whom he alone is able to relate.30 The idea of unique or special vision is developed in the intricate imagery of the following verse paragraph, which hinges on the optical properties of horses' eyes: 25 Улица опрокинулась, The street tipped over, течет по-своему... flows in its own way... Подошел и вижу— I approached and see— 29. The distinction between looking and seeing is made even more explicit in a published variant of the lines: «Гляжу и вижу [I look and see]» (2:439). 30. Pertsov notes Mayakovsky's repetition of the line «Подошел и вижу [I approached and see]» and explains it as the poet's method of extending and strengthening the two related im pressions he describes in this section: the street scene flowing by, reflected in the horse's eyes, and the horse's flowing tears (Pertsov 29).</page><page sequence="16">268 Slavic and East European Journal за каплищей каплища huge drop after huge drop по морде катится, rolls down the snout, 30 прячется в шерсти ... (2:10-11) hides in the hair ... It is important to note that horses' eyes play a significant, even critical role in the texts of Nekrasov and Dostoevsky. It was a passage in Nekrasov's poem describing how a peasant beat his horse across the eyes—«И по плачущим, кротким глазам! [And across her crying, meek eyes!]» (Nekrasov 180)—that seems to have captured Dostoevsky's imagination as the epitome of cruelty. Ivan Karamazov specifically references the line in the "Rebellion" chapter of The Brothers Karamazov, and it is echoed in Raskolnikov's dream as well: —По морде ее, по глазам хлещи, по глазам!—кричит Миколка. [...] Он бежит подле лошадки, он забегает вперед, он видит как ее секут по глазам, по самым глазам! (Dosto evskii 63) "Lash her face, lash her eyes, her eyes!" cries Mikolka. [...] He runs alongside the little horse; he runs ahead and sees them beat her in the eyes, right in the eyes! For Nekrasov and Dostoevsky, the horse's eyes are only an object—the part of the horse most capable and most emblematic of suffering; Mayakovsky, on the other hand, looks carefully into them and is able to see the world differently.31 The imagery in lines 25-26 indicates that the poet is watching the reflection of the street in the horse's large, tear-wet, convex eyes. Horses' eyes reflect a spherically distorted image such as one would see through a wide-angle, fish eye lens; together with the horse's tears and the poet's vantage point above the fallen animal, this effect seems to make the street-scene tip over or capsize. Like an artist copying from an upside-down picture in order to activate differ ent parts of his or her brain, the poet sees the mob and the street as if for the first time, detachedly, with the help of this real-life, optical enstrangement. The poet's intervention in "Being Good" recalls in many ways the one in "Violin," but there are important differences: И какая-то общая And some sort of common звериная тоска animal ache плеща вылилась из меня flowed splashing out of me и расплылась в шелесте. and spread out in a rustle. 35 «Лошадь, не надо. "Horse, don't. Лошадь, слушайте— Horse, listen— чего вы думаете, что вы их плоше? you think this means you're worse than them? Деточка, Kiddo, все мы немножко лошади, we're all horses a little bit, 40 каждый из нас по-своему лошадь», each of us is in his own way a horse." (2:11) Here again, the poet stresses similarities, even kinship; as we saw in "Violin," a key prerequisite for public mockery is emotional detachment from the ob 31. Lahti notes that Mayakovsky looks into the horse's eyes as one would in a kiss, recalling the young Raskolnikov's behavior in the dream sequence of Dostoevsky's novel (Lahti 148).</page><page sequence="17">Laughing Like a Child in Two Mayakovsky Poems 269 ject of laughter, assigning it to the category of other/alien/someone else's (which the word chuzho expressed so well in the earlier poem). Mayakovsky, on the other hand, won't draw such lines; on the contrary, he goes out of his way to find similarities between himself and the object of scorn. Whereas in the earlier poem the speaker's intervention showed him tri umphantly asserting himself—jumping into the spotlight of public scorn, using his own bombastic personality as a shield for the violin—here he down plays himself, quietly consoling the horse without seeking any attention from the crowd. It is fitting, then, that his spoken lines in the earlier poem showed heightened organization and sound-play: he was essentially showing off. The stifling of his poetic prowess in "Being Good," on the other hand—lines 31—40 are noticeably rhyme-poor—represents an attempt at self-effacement and altruistic consolation. Perhaps the most curious fact about the poet's speech is that it bears no relevance to the situation at hand: he consoles the horse neither for having fallen down nor for being laughed at, but rather for being a horse. He addresses her respectfully, as he did the violin—the use of the formal you when speaking to an animal is, if anything, even more strik ing—and although he does, quite significantly, use the affectionate diminu tive detochka [kiddo, baby], he refrains throughout the poem from using any diminutives or alternate words for horse. This constitutes another break with the source texts of Nekrasov and Dostoevsky, where the pejorative term klia cha [jade] (an inferior or worn-out horse), its diminutive kliachonka, and other substitutes are used. Again Mayakovsky resists placing himself lexi cally or grammatically above a victim of mockery. The substance of the speaker's consolation is that the horse is no worse than the people laughing at her, because everyone is at least a little bit, in some way—in his own way—a horse. This is at the very least a strange thing to say to a horse that has just slipped and fallen on the ice, but the repetition of the adverb po-svoemu [in one's own way] may give a clue as to the poet's overall meaning: this poem, like "Violin," argues against the idea of separate ness and solipsism conveyed by the adverb. The suggestion is that everyone is a horse in his own, private way, but that no one is willing to own up to those similarities. Mayakovsky, on the other hand, shows himself in both poems ad dressed here to be a catchall, privy and open to all manner of merger and as sociation. This quality of Mayakovsky's poetic persona was pointed out by Marina Tsvetaeva in the 1933 essay «Эпос и лирика современной России [Epic and Lyric in Contemporary Russia]»: Я во всем—Маяковский. [...] Маяковский—претворение себя в предмете, растворение себя в предмете. [...] Маяковский безличен, он стал вещью, живописуемой. Маяковский, как имя, собирательное. [...] Маяковский—невозможность неслияния. (380—81)32 32. Tsvetaeva's essay contrasts Mayakovsky with Pasternak; in the omitted portions of this passage, she describes Pasternak as Mayakovsky's opposite.</page><page sequence="18">270 Slavic and East European Journal Mayakovsky is the I-in-everything. [...] Mayakovsky is the conversion of self into object, the dissolution of self in object. [...] Mayakovsky is faceless; he became the thing he was depicting. Mayakovsky as a noun is collective. [...] Mayakovsky represents the impossibility of not merg ing with one's surroundings. The poet's tendency to merge with his characters and surroundings—remem ber the obliteration of the boundary between animate and inanimate in "Vio lin"—makes him an ideal opponent to public, adult laughter, which requires some measure of detachment and assumed superiority. In both these poems, due at least in part to his childlike perception of events and his surroundings, Mayakovsky is unable to resist the connection he feels to his protagonists. The final 20 lines of the poem depict a positive outcome for the horse, but the poet deliberately qualifies his judgments on the matter, creating a palpa ble ambiguity: Может быть —старая — и не нуждалась в няньке, может быть, и мысль ей моя казалась пошла, 45 только лошадь рванулась, встала на ноги, ржанула 50 и пошла. Хвостом помахивала. Рыжий ребенок. Пришла веселая, стала в стойло. 55 И все ей казалось— она жеребенок, и стоило жить, и работать стоило. (2:11) Perhaps— she was old— she had no need for a nanny, perhaps my idea seemed to her vulgar, only the horse jerked herself up, stood on her feet, gave a neigh and set off. She was wagging her tail. A chestnut child. She arrived cheerful, stood in the stall. And all the while it seemed to her that she was a young foal, and it was worthwhile to live, and worthwhile to work. Atone of uncertainty is immediately set by the repeated mozhet byt' [perhaps] and the "/... i" construction in lines 43—44, which indicates that both, either, or neither of the proffered explanations could be valid. Curiously, the poet doesn't even consider what might seem the most logical explanation: that his consolation was positively effective and gave the horse the will to move on. This omission could be a continuation of the relative humility demonstrated formally in his speech, or it could suggest that his consolation was intended as vulgar33—that the poet was offering his own quirky brand of humor as an antidote to the venom of public laughter. This idea would suggest a cause and-effect semantic link between both rhyme pairs in the macro-quatrain of 33. The adjective poshlyi, from which the short form poshla is derived, denotes a semantic category richer than any one word can express in English, including the meanings vulgar, banal, trite, cliché, bogus, etc. (Nabokov 63-74).</page><page sequence="19">Laughing Like a Child in Two Mayakovsky Poems 271 lines 41-50—nian'ke/na nogi [nanny/onto her feet], and the homonymie poshla/poshla [vulgar/set off]: the poet's intentionally vulgar nannying in cites the horse to get on her feet and take off.34 The ambiguity of the poem's conclusion is established in line 55—«И все ей казалось [And all the while it seemed to her]»; the famously life- and labor-affirming final two lines of the poem may simply be impressions that seem true to the horse. Furthermore, of the three impressions listed, the first— that she is a young foal—is patently false (and undercut explicitly by line 42's "she was old"): the return to childhood Mayakovsky offers here, as in "Vio lin," is something of a sham, a mirage likely to evaporate shortly after the close of the poem. That Mayakovsky so heavily qualifies the horse's senti ments supports the notion that the horse becomes a stand-in for the poet in the final 20 lines of the poem: his bombast is a mood swing, only one facet of his poetic personality. It is as though the horse is playing the part of the poet at the end of "Violin," and the poet here is playing the more subdued, but cru cial, doubt-engendering role of the violin. The "1st Memory" section of Mayakovsky's autobiography provides such a rich backdrop to these poems in part because the poet's reaction to mob laughter involves a kind of willful regression into childhood, into a world where laughter is innocent and non-hierarchical (as Baudelaire suggested). Childlike language or direct evocations of childhood appear toward the end of both poems: the speaker's defiant «А мне—наплевать! / Я—хороший [But I—don't give a damn! / I'm a good guy]» at the end of "Violin" is some thing a Russian child might say to a bully, and the recovered horse is referred to as "A chestnut child [Рыжий ребенок]." For the poet, then, being good— to horses and violins alike—is equated with returning to a stage of develop ment when the ego is still capable of allying itself and identifying with ani mals and inanimate objects.35 One paradox that emerges from Mayakovsky's treatment of humor in these poems is that the alienated, laughed-at individ ual, though he or she may be at odds with society at large, is infinitely more capable than his or her peers of meaningful interpersonal connection (in the sense noted by Tsvetaeva). The victims' marginalization, then, whether inten tional or accidental, could turn out to be a good thing, for it represents the possibility of release from the calcified hierarchies of adult society. Maya kovsky, however, reserves final judgment on the matter, retaining what might be called a surplus of perspective on the characters in his poems—that is, an objective and often playful view of both the laughing crowd and the lone fig ure (the latter, for example, is not the unequivocal hero, even if the former is 34. It may be significant that the word poshla (in the sense "set off") is also used in a rhyming position in Nekrasov's poem, and in a similar narrative context: «Лошадь вдруг напряглась—и пошла / Как-то боком, нервически скоро [The horse suddenly exerted her self—and set off / Somehow sideways, nervously quickly]» (180). 35. I am indebted to an anonymous reviewer for the formulation of this important idea.</page><page sequence="20">272 Slavic and East European Journal vilified). It is this surplus of perspective that gives the poems their ambiguity and prevents easy, one-sided resolution of the conflict between adult and chil dren's laughter. Indeed, to the extent that Mayakovsky resolved the conflict in his later work, he seems to have favored superiority-based, mocking laughter as a weapon in his ongoing struggle against complacency and convention (to judge from his propagandistic verse of the 1920s). Such laughter—Baude laire's satanic laughter and Bergson's social corrective—was of greater prac tical use in furthering the political and cultural goals of the Revolution, but these earlier poems reveal the emotional depth and regenerative power Maya kovsky knew laughter to contain.

Реферат Джеймс МакГавран Взрослый и детский смех в двух стихотворениях Маяковского Судя по его автобиографии «Я сам», Маяковский очень рано осознал уникальность своего чувства юмора (см. отделение под названием «1-е Воспоминание»), По словам поэта, он на протяжении всей своей жизни находил юмор, или скорее создавал его, там, где другие меньше всего его ожидали. Более того, его понятие о смехе разделилось на две сферы: взрослую и детскую, официальную и неофициальную. Взрослый, официальный смех был смехом толпы над индивидуумом, который оторвался от нее, а детский смех предста влял собой некое разыгрывание или спонтанную игру. Противостояние поэта групповому, уличному смеху стало тематикой двух его ранних стихотворений: «Скрипки и немножко нервно» (1914) и «Хорошего отношения к лошадям» (1918). В обоих произведениях поэт демонстративно соединяет себя с жертвой всеобщего презрения и осмеивания, выговаривая эксцентрические слова утешения, которые используют его личное, уникальное чувство юмора—юмора большого ребенка—как противоядие от злого, группового смеха. Эти стихот ворения, как изображения общественного смеха и реакции поэта на такой смех, вступают в интереснейший диалог с теориями Бодлера и Бергсона. Подробный анализ стихотворений Маяковского раскрывает эти связи и показывает поло жительный и отрицательный потенциал смеха в его творчестве—его созидате льную, или, наоборот, разрушительную мощь.</page></plain_text>
