<plain_text><page sequence="1">Electoral ambitions and European integration Werner Feld and John K. Wildgen Based on interviews with 82 national legislators in all nine member states of the European Community, this article examines and analyzes the attitudes and antici- pated behavior of the respondents with respect to political integration. In the analysis we pursued four paths: personal motivations, constituency concerns, views of the European Parliament, and a sketch of the history of efforts for direct elections. According to our findings, political integration offers these legislators neither person- al-material, electoral-partisan, nor institutional-prestige rewards that are unambigu- ous. Nevertheless, the interviews also show considerable expression of support for an expanded level and scope of decision making by the Community institutions and for political union. This might be explained by the attractiveness of a United Europe as a forum in which small and medium powers are able to act as a great power. However, the nation state provides things even more basic to political classes: an identity, immediate access to available power, and opportunities for more power. Integration theory has now recognized that the process of political integration within an international region cannot move forward without the strong support of influential elites. In a regional integration scheme as exemplified by the European Community (EC), perhaps the most direct impact on this process can be exerted by the political and administrative elites of the participating states since they are in a position to control channels and inputs into the complex multilevel decision-mak- ing apparatus typifying this regional system.' This article will focus on one segment of the national political elites in the European Community, the members of the national legislatures in the nine partici- pant countries. Despite a general decline of the powers of most national legislatures Werner Feld and John K. Wildgen are members of the Department of Political Science at the University of New Orleans, which is a member of the Louisiana State University System. ICf. for example, Leon N.

They have the legitimacy and authority in the eyes of their populations to generate effective support for or opposition to pro-integration objectives and activities. Their political aspirations may adversely affect the Community's decision-making performance and weaken the ideological tenor of the Community. Conversely, if these elites were persuaded to proffer genuine support to the aims and procedures of political integration, such a resolve would be a significant element in producing a shift in the locus of decision making closer to the point where the Community institutions would dominate.2 As we understand political integration, it consists of a gradual transfer of powers and activities normally under the control of the EC member governments to the central institutions of the European Community with eventual gradual shifts of identities, loyalties, and expectations of the people in the region to these institutions as well. In contrast to Henry H. Kerr's article on the members of the European Parliament (EP)3 which analyzes the effect of participation in the activities of the EP on their attitudes, we will concentrate on an analysis and evaluation of the attitudes and behavior of a cross section of all national legislators with respect to political integration generally and the European Parliament in particular. Our data stem from partially structured interviews of 82 legislators conducted mostly during the first half of 1973.4 In view of the nature of our respondents it was impossible to effectively employ technically scientific sampling procedures. Clearly, our prob- lem transcended questions of sampling design on the basis of random numbers because no matter how scientifically respondents could have been selected, they would have done us little good unless they were willing to cooperate. Nevertheless, an effort was made in the selection of interviewees to cover each party in the various national legislatures and assure a fair distribution in terms of age, back- ground, and geography. EP membership was not a criterion, but availability for an interview played an important role which could not be avoided. Intermediaries were used who could find willing respondents and also vouch for the good faith of the interviewers.5 2Ibid., p. 69.

'Although interview guides were prepared for each meeting with the legislators they were not used in the presence of the interviewees since both American and European politicians are often suspicious of professors carrying casette recorders or notebooks. Following the examples of V. 0. Key and Gabriel Almond, the interview guides were filled out as quickly as possible after the interviews had been completed. Thus we avoided inhibitions on the part of the respondents that may have been caused by taking notes in front of them and yet obtained data which were an improvement over unstructured conversations.</page><page sequence="3">Electoral ambitions and integration 449 Table 1 shows a breakdown of interviews by country; it should be noted that in Germany not only Bundestag deputies but also a few members of the state legislatures were interviewed. In terms of party afflliation, 39 percent of all respondents belonged to Socialist and Communist (Italy) parties, 38 percent to Confessional and Conservative-oriented parties, and 23 percent to Lay-Liberal parties. As for age, 16 percent of all respondents were in the 24-34 age bracket; 36 percent between 35 and 44; 37 percent between 45 and 54; 20 percent between 55 and 64, and 7 percent over 65. University degrees were held by 72 percent of the interviewees, more than half were either lawyers or economists, and 39 percent spoke at least two languages while nearly 34 percent were tr-lingual. Clearly then, the respondents were generally well-educated and multi-lingual. Their occupations Table 1.

When one looks over the process of political integration which has unfolded during the last decade in the European Community, one is struck by the gap between the rhetoric of governmental leaders and political parties on the one hand and the actual progress made in political integration on the other. With the exception of General de Gaule and his closest supporters in the Union for the Defense of the Republic (UDR), formerly the Union of the New Republic (UNR), governmental leaders and political parties in the Community member states have repeatedly expressed themselves in favor of the "construction of Europe" and many of these statements contained either explicit or implied support for the</page><page sequence="4">450 International Organization establishment of a European government and some kind of a federal Europe.6 A step toward the creation of a united Europe was seen in the design of a monetary and economic union which was proclaimed as a major objective during the 1969 Hague meeting of the heads of state and chiefs of government of the Common Market countries. But when we examine closely what has been done so far in bringing about a higher level of political integration, or in fact the establishment of the economic and monetary union, we witness frustrations, slowdowns, if not 7 actual stagnation. The interviews with the national legislators were designed to shed light on this paradoxical divergence between proclaimed aims and actuality in the process of political integration. They were devised to elicit information on the legislators' attitudes toward integration and on their motivations and electoral ambitions as far as they are influenced by the European Community framework. In analyzing elite attitudes investigators rely on the same technology used in dealing with mass attitudes. But the information retrieved from elites is fundamen- tally different from that obtained from the public. Even in democracies the masses are usually far removed from policy-making, while elite bodies-especially parlia- ments-can do much more about an issue than take notice of it and express views. Thus, while in working with mass publics there is an obligation to state what is felt and why, elite studies have to add considerations about what the elite groups are likely to do. When the data are rich this can be a confusing task unless a careful plan of elaboration is used. Our approach is based upon a three-pronged attack. First we are going to look at some of the more inward-directed motivations politicians might have that would incline them towards a personal commitment to European integra- tion. By "personal" we mean a commitment based on other than electoral or partisan considerations as such. In our view it appears that two major sources of possible personal commitment merit attention. One is the hypothesized notion that working in "European" institutions socializes one to "European" values and norms. Second, at a more prosaic level, it can also be hypothesized that a personal commitment to integration can arise from purely material, financial-but not necessarily venal-considerations. Second, we will examine the views and reactions of national legislators toward integration as a new element in their relationship with constituents. This involves consideration of the degree to which integration, its manifestations-for 6In February 1972 Chancellor Brandt and President Pompidou called for the implementation of a "European Europe" and to proceed as quickly as possible with the creation of monetary and economic union.

If such issues evoke a high level of controversiality regarding joint decision making in the Community and if they thereby lead to a widening of the audience or clientele interested and perhaps active in integration, a particular issue-or integra- tion as a whole-could become highly politicized and indeed influence the outcome of individual elections. Some neo-functionalists believe that politicization of joint Community decision making promotes spill-over and integration.8 The questions posed to the respondents touched on their perceptions of politicization as well as on the role which they as individual legislators play with respect to their constituencies. If a member of parliament in Europe defines his or her role as that of a "delegate" then his or her behavior should be close to popular desires-whatever they may be. On the other hand, European legislators may regard themselves more as "trustees" of the commonweal-essentially a Burkean outlook towards representation.9 In this connection, it will be important to inquire how legislators will react toward the impact of particular integration measures affecting their constituents and how this behavior can be related to their general attitudinal framework regarding integration. Third, we will inquire into the views of legislators and their anticipated behavior regarding the structure and activities of the European Parliament. Do they favor direct elections? And what would be the impact of direct elections on their electoral ambitions? How do they regard the prestige of their colleagues currently holding seats in the European Parliament and what is their view of the caliber of European parliamentarians over the past fifteen years? How interested are they in obtaining a seat in the EP and how do they think this might affect their political careers? 8 For the impact of politicization on spill-over see Philippe C. Schmitter, "Three Neo-Func- tional Hypotheses About International Integration," International Organization, vol. 23, no. 2 (Spring 1969), p. 166. He believes that an increase in the controversiality of joint decision making is likely to lead to a "manifest redefinition of mutual objectives" and that the pursuit of the new objectives may involve an upward shift in either the scope or level of commitment to integration. This in turn could produce a shift in actual expectations and loyalties toward the new regional center. Joseph S. Nye is more cautious. "Comparing Common Markets: A Revised Neo-Functionalist Model," International Organization, vol. 24, no. 4 (Autumn 1970), pp. 823-24. Nye believes that timing is a crucial element. Clearly, politicization involves more groups in the problem of integration and may increase the number of linkages among societal groups as well as lead to deliberate coalition formation. But there is also a risk that powerful political opposition in the member states will be mobilized which may make it impossible for low cost and quiet technocratic decision making to be effective in attaining integration goals. The final result may well depend on the degree of support that can be built up by legitimizing decision makers and our interviewees certainly fall into this classification. 9There is a voluminous literature available on the role orientations of legislators regarding their relations with constituents. The seminal article, Heinz Eulau's "The Legislator as Repre- sentative: Representational Roles," in John Wahlke et al., The Legislative System (New York: John Wiley, 1962), is required reading.</page><page sequence="6">452 International Organization There are many legal and practical problems which constitute serious impedi- ments to the introduction of direct elections to the EP. The European Economic Community (EEC) Treaty in Article 138, Section 3, calls upon the European Parliament to draw up pertinent proposals for direct elections. Since 1960 a number of proposals have been made in the European Parliament and the member states for this kind of election. Following the summit meeting of the heads of states and chiefs of governments in the Hague in December of 1969 another resolution was passed by the European Parliament to urge the Council of Ministers to take the necessary decisions in this matter.-l Article 138 postulates a "uniform procedure" in all member states. In view of the great variety of national election systems in the Community countries ranging from single member constituencies in Britain to almost pure proportional represen- tation in the Netherlands this is a difficult task. A committee chaired by Belgian Professor and Deputy Fernand Dehousse which was to develop proposals for direct elections as early as 1958 advocated a small number of common initial steps rather than a complete uniform system of elections. The suggested steps included a common minimum age of 21 for European parliamentarians, a common election day, and a common term of five years. The committee envisaged a size of 426 members for the parliament, more than three times the number of 146 of which the EP was composed at the time. Since the enlargement of the Community in 1973, the number of parliamentarians would in fact have to be even larger. Personal motivations and integration It has been generally assumed that persistent cross-national collaboration among individuals of different nationalities under conditions of shared goals and common procedures may induce learning and socialization processes leading gradu- ally to the adoption of new values and beliefs. Experiences of national civil servants of the EC countries seconded to the Community civil services, assigned to working groups of experts organized by the Commission, or assigned to the permanent missions of their countries in Brussels, have furnished some evidence-although not fully conclusive-supporting this assumption. However, when these civil servants returned to their national institutions, they seem to have often been exposed to a counter-socialization process." 10 European Parliament, Documents of Sessions, Report About the General Direct Election of Members of the European Parliament and the Resolution of the Socialist Party Group (Docu- ment No. 210, January 28, 1970).

He contends that European parliamen- tarians develop more complex perceptions and become better informed about and more interested in European affairs, but that their attitudes do not become more favorable toward European values and procedures because many of the legislators volunteered for the position in the EP and, in fact, were avowed Europeans before their nomination. The number of the respondents who held positions with the European civil service, expert working groups, or the permanent missions was only five, or about 6 percent of the sample. This suggests that few national legislators in the EC countries have been exposed to the learning and socialization process to which we alluded earlier. On the other hand, 22 percent of the interviewees had been and were members of the European Parliament, a relatively high proportion considering that the number of EP members constitutes less than 5 percent of all national parliamen- tarians in the nine EC member states.13 Eleven percent of the respondents, or half of those with former or current EP membership, stated that their experiences as European parliamentarians had changed their views about the value and usefulness of the Community and its procedures, but only in four out of nine cases did these attitude changes appear to indicate a more "European" orientation. Another factor likely to affect the attitudes of the legislators favorably toward political integration may be material benefits or other tangible advantages that a respondent might have enjoyed in the past or expects in the future. It is reasonable to assume that if an individual perceives political integration to have a high utilitarian value for himself directly or indirectly, he may be more inclined to actively support the process of integration than if he does not see any personal advantages in this process. Only 15 percent of the respondents claimed to have had material benefits or tangible advantages from political integration either in terms of improved economic status or in the form of increased economic or political security while only two respondents (2 percent) expected such benefits in the future.14 When asked 228-44, and Lawrence Scheinman and Werner Feld, "The European Economic Community and National Civil Servants of the Member States," International Organization, vol. 26, no. 1 (Winter 1972), pp. 121-35.

Forty percent, a surprisingly large percentage, "did not know" or did not answer. Forty-two percent considered them favorably, 18 percent unfavorably. See</page><page sequence="8">454 International Organization whether the respondents considered the current level and scope of Community decision-making processes to be "too extensive," "about right," or "insufficient," 68 percent thought them to be insufficient. In view of the absence of utilitarian motivations and the relatively small number of legislators that could have been exposed to the social learning and socialization process discussed earlier, this represents a relatively strong majority. When those who considered the level and scope of Community decision-making processes to be "about right" or "insuf- ficient" (90 percent of the respondents) were asked further whether they would opt for economic, monetary, or political union, 66 percent of this group wanted to see the Community develop into a political union. Table 2 shows a breakdown of these responses. It should be noted that some of the interviewees opted for more than one choice. The strongest support came from the Italian respondents and the least support from Denmark."5 In terms of age, the 65-plus and 35-44 age groups among the respondents displayed the strongest backing for political union, with the youngest group (25-34) manifesting the least support."6 As for party affiliation, the Lay-Liberal respondents showed greatest support, the Socialist-Communist the least. Of course, the latter include the British Labour MPs whose position, in view of Mr. Wilson's stand, was predictable. We admit that the term "political union" lacks precision inasmuch as it may mean either a confederal, federal, or a unitary structure depending on the perception of the respondent. But this term is fre- quently used in Europe and has been employed in a number of mass surveys. Without doubt, it implies a broader transfer of governmental powers to central institutions than an economic and monetary union.17 To probe the depth and sincerity of the pro-integration attitudes expressed by the interviewees, the question was posed as to whether they were prepared to make financial sacrifices for pressing forward with political integration. More than half refused to answer this question, 26 percent declined to make any financial Jacques-Rene Rabier, "Europeans and the Unification of Europe," in Ghita Ionescu, The New Politics of European Integration (New York: Macmillan, 1972), pp. 153-77, esp. pp. 170-1. 15 Despite the fact that the sample of parliamentarians is perhaps too small to draw general conclusions, the percentage given in table 2 for the distribution of responses by nationality correlate rather well with the mass opinion surveys made in September of 1973 under the direction of Jacques-Rene Rabier as reported in 30 Jours d'Europe, no. 186 (January 1974) pp. 11-17. In early 1973 occasional popular demonstrations against EC membership were observed in Copenhagen. These demonstrations may explain somewhat the responses of the Danish interviewees, half of whom considered EC decision making either "about right" or "too extensive." 16 This appears to fly in the face of some of Ronald Inglehart's findings in his mass surveys. See "Changing Value Priorities and European Integration," Journal of Common Market Studies, vol. 10, no. 1 (September 1971), pp. 32-33, inasmuch as his 25-34 age group is strongly pro-integrationist. However, it confirms the impressions of Feld as suggested in his article, "National Legislators and Political Integration in the European Community," Journal of Constitutional and Parliamentary Studies, vol. 6, no. 4, October-December 1972, pp. 11-14. 17 In view of the time limitation to which elite interviews are often subjected, the ambiguity of the term may have been a virtue rather than a drawback. Obviously President Pompidou and Chancellor Brandt do not agree on its meaning. (See Press Conference of M. Pompidou of September 27, 1973, Ambassade de France, Services de Presse et D'Information, F/73 76-78.)</page><page sequence="9">Electoral ambitions and integration 455 Table 2.

In this connection, the answers to another, somewhat extraneous, question may be significant. The interviewees were asked whether they believed British entry into the Community would aid, stagnate, or reduce the prospects for political integration. More than half (52 percent) thought it would reduce the prospects, while 16 percent thought it would lead to stagnation. Only 22 percent believed it would aid political integration and 10 percent had no firm opinion. So far then we observe a substantial majority of the interviewees to be dissatisfied with the insufficiency of the level and scope of Community decision making, and desirous of political integration. However, the motivations for these attitudes are unclear. Certainly, the evidence from our questions about previous and current service with EC institutions and those regarding the influence of the utilitarian value flowing from the integration process is not sufficiently conclusive to allow speculation on the motivational bearing of these factors. The pessimistic tenor of the interviewees' responses to our question regarding the impact of British entry in the process of political integration does not necessarily imply a negative attitude toward this process, but may be interpreted as signifying the need for special efforts to overcome a serious handicap. However, the disparity between the low evidence of concrete support for political integration as reflected by the answers of the respondents to our question regarding financial sacrifilce and merely verbal support which seems to be much more extensive may reveal lack of depth of pro-integrationist attitudes and requires explanation which may be found in our analysis of the next two clusters of questions and answers. Election issues and constituency concerns It is reasonable to assume the members of national legislatures are almost unanimous in desiring to keep their seats.'9 Hence they must be concerned with determining the issues which arouse strong interest in their constituencies and deeply occupy the minds of the voters. But even more important is the question as to how much their position on a salient issue may influence the outcome of an election. This of course also applies to the issue of political integration and its manifestations such as uniform value-added taxes, the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), and others. Therefore, we included in the interviews questions regarding the legislators' perceptions about the salience of the issue for their constituencies in general and how important the issue was for their elections. Table 3 provides the answers to these questions and suggests that political integration is regarded by the majority of the respondents as a fairly important issue to their constituents, but in the view of nearly 70 percent of the legislators sampled it is electorally immaterial. The latter perceptions are likely to be strength- 19 See Joseph A.

Nearly three-fourths of the respondents deny having been the target of any pressure for a change or the maintenance of their attitudes toward political integration.20 But, more importantly, table 3 presents us with a paradox. Let us examine in more detail the first question in the table where we take up constituent interest. We asked "How important an issue is political integration for your constituency as a whole?" Thirty-eight percent of our respondents see political integration as immate- rial to their constituents. Perhaps on the face of it this appears to be a high degree of indifference. But one of the most notable findings of the political science literature devoted to public opinion is the high rate of indifference found for most issues. In the cross-national literature indifference to political issues has been a major theme. Almond and Verba's five-nation study provides abundant evidence of this phenomenon. Taking the example of political campaigns-the periods in which a country's political consciousness is systematically elevated-Almond and Verba still found that nearly 30 percent of their British and German respondents, and 54 percent of their Italian respondents, were ignoring election campaigns.21 If never- theless the turnout at the elections was very high, this may be attributed to the fact that many Europeans consider voting as a necessary ritual. Thus, if those paying no attention to the integration problem number about 40 percent (allowing for variations from one nation to another)-and those thinking about integration number about 60 percent-it is apparent that we are dealing with an issue having an impact on public consciousness nearly as great as campaigns. Why, then-and here is the paradox-does this issue make, in the view of 70 percent of the legislators, no difference at the polls the way a campaign should?22 Perhaps, these data indicate 20 According to our respondents, the main sources of pressure have been the business community, organized labor (especially in Great Britain), agricultural groups (especially in France), and the European Movement. 21 Gabriel Almond and Sidney Verba, The Civic Culture (Princeton, N.J.: Princeton Univer- sity Press, 1963), p. 147.

It is the kind of problem that is discussed not the way things were discussed in the Paris of May 1968, but in the manner that Cezanne's card players might have used: a moderately interesting topic suitable for discussion in a cafe among old friends sharing a litre of vin du pays. It is not the kind of issue that leads to the making of a nation, or the unification of a multi-lingual, pluri-cultural continent by itself,23 no matter how upset Britishers may be about Community-authorized supertrucks pounding their roads or Gennans over CAP-related increases in target prices for food. If representatives accurately perceive that their constituents are interested in a question but have not taken strong partisan positions on the issue, how should they proceed? Moreover, how will they proceed? The answers to these questions are not necessarily related. The connection between the two depends largely, but not exclusively, on how closely a legislator modifies his behavior in the face of forceful constituency opinion. In the case of our selection of legislators we feel confident that they know their constituencies. Are they going to act accordingly? We have already referred to the two roles that elected legislators may assume with respect to their constituencies. In the delegate-servant model the representa- tive simply registers in parliament what the constiuency wants-regardless of his own feelings or political principles. This does not mean that this kind of legislator is unprincipled. Rather, part of his set of principles includes faithful reflection of constituency opinion. At the other end is the trustee role usually associated with Edmund Burke's idea that the constituency elects someone to serve the nation according to his conscience. That is, the representative may go against the will of his constituents where he sees a higher national interest or political principle involved. minds about voting. But events in France went beyond what we normally think of as campaigning. In the rest of Europe it is our general impression that the voters are more stable, frequently, than the governments. In those countries, and in the US as well, campaigns are useful because they reassure the already-convinced more than they convert former opponents. But no politician would argue that campaigns have no effect at the polls. First, they get out the vote. Secondly, even where electoral participation is high or semi-compulsory (as in Italy) campaigns can affect the individual candidate in a close race with members of other parties or, in some cases, affect his standing in panachage contests with his colleagues. 23 In both 1970 and 1971 Jacques-Rene Rabier asked an identical question of cross-sectional samples of the populations of the Community nations. The results testify rather eloquently to the accuracy of our respondents' perceptions of their constituents. Rabier asked, "Are you for or against the evolution of the Common Market towards the political creation of the United States of Europe?" The level of disagreement or polarization in each country was moderate as in both years there seemed to be substantial support for the idea. However, in the 1970 poll there was a Community-wide non-response rate of 20 percent. In 1971 the non-response rate rose in every country but Germany. The overall pattern suggests an increasing unwillingness on the part of Europeans to commit themselves, one way or the other, to the idea of United States of Europe. The attitudes of parliamentarians are congruent with the popular reaction to the idea and it is not remarkable that they feel little electoral pressure to push for integration. The pressure simply does not exist within the electorate. See Rabier, "Europeans and a United Europe," p. 160, and L'Opinion des Europeens sur les Aspects Regionaux et Agricoles du Marche Commun, L'Unification Politique de 1'Europe et l'Information du Public (Bruxelles: Commission des Communautes Europeenes, Direction general de la Presse et de l'information, 1971), esp. p. 50.</page><page sequence="13">Electoral ambitions and integration 459 There is, of course, a middle role which many seem to employ in practice. Moreover, many legislators change roles from one issue to the next. It is no secret that in the United States legislators are frequently delegates when it comes to civil rights and trustees in foreign policy. This tendency to switch roles-and to try to strike an overall balance between constituency-national goals-is what Kornberg and others have felicitously called the "politico" role.24 To see how our respondents fit into this scheme of things we administered two questions touching on the importance of mass opinion in their political considerations. First, we asked them how much they should "take into account mass opinion when making a judgment about political integration in general." Then they were asked more specifically how much mass opinion had, in fact, influenced them. The answers of our respondents in table 4 show significant disparity between the should of mass influence and the does of mass influence.25 Are these legislators failing to practice what they preach? On the contrary (in this case), this kind of incongruity is perfectly in accord with data we have already seen. Apparently these legislators are willing to allow for at least a moderate degree of constituency influence. It seems supportable to argue that they are would-be delegates. But because of the fact that political integration is a question rather than an issue, they are receiving no significant cues from constituency electorates26 in spite of the occasional excitement generated by integration manifestations. This does not mean that constituency members do not have conflicting views on political integration. Table 4.

Two-thirds of the Danish respondents considered that mass opinion should very much be taken into account when making judgment about political integration and the same proportion stated that mass opinion has in fact influenced their attitudes toward the usefulness of political integration. 26 See also Michael Niblock, The EEC: National Parliaments in Community Decision-Making (London: Chatham House, Political and Economic Planning 1971), p. 43.</page><page sequence="14">460 International Organization But, as we have seen, these views are not held with enough intensity to make any difference at the polls. These conclusions are supported by studies made on the role that European Community problems actually played in the West German elections in 1965 and the Netherlands election in 1967.27 A somewhat different situation existed during the French presidential elections in 1965, when the Common Market crisis provoked by de Gaulle's boycott of European Community proceedings caused serious apprehen- sion among the French farmers about the future of the CAP, and thereby raised the level of interest in European questions. Nevertheless, in the election of a candidate to political office, his support for political unification had practically no influence on the outcome of his election. This should not be taken to signify that the majorities of the electorates in the EEC countries are "anti-European," but simply that other issues are decisive.28 Although a majority of the public in the member states is in favor of the European Community and European union, the opinions expressed suggest a rather nebulous sensitivity to European problems and only vague knowledge. Equally vague are the motivations for the favorable attitudes. Certainly, the strong backing of European unity prominently displayed in the election program of French presidential candi- date Alain Poher, announced six days before the first election run in 1969, did not gain him additional votes; in fact, his percentage of votes received during this election run was substantially lower than that indicated in the public opinion polls taken just prior to the announcement.29 In future elections in the member states it may be the farm issue which might produce controversies regarding Common Market policy that may influence some of the voters in how to cast their ballots. The march of the farmers of all the Community countries in March 197130 in order to raise agricultural prices in the Community and the concessions made ultimately by the Community Commission and the Council of Ministers suggest that political leaders in the six countries have realized the explosiveness of the farm issue and its relevance for national election campaigns. Storm signals were also hoisted in Italy when in November 1971 thousands of Italian farmers made strong demands on their government to ensure some kind of improvement in their economic status and protested among other things the fact that Italy contributes more money to the European Common 27 Alfred Jaeger, 'Das Thema 'Europa' im Bundestagswahlkampf 1965" (Forschungsinstitut fuer Politische Wissenschaft und Europaeische Fragen an der Universitaet zu Koeln), mimeo; and J.

It is interesting to note that the majority of the British MPs agree with the view that the issue of political integration in Europe has had no electoral signifi- cance despite the protracted dispute between the Heath government and the leadership of the Labour Party about British membership in the EC. The pendulum of public opinion in Britain which moved from opposition to support of member- ship in late 1972 seems to be swinging back. The spectacular rise in food prices in Britain has been linked by politicians to entry into the EC and the CAP with fixed high target prices.33 But the EC and integration did not become a major political issue in the February 1974 elections. In a poll conducted after the election campaign had started only 6 percent of the respondents considered the Common Market to be the "most important problem" the government should do something about. Rising prices and trade union-industry relations were labelled as such by 35 and 40 percent respectively.34 The expectation of many Britishers to obtain special financing from the EC Regional Development Fund for Britain's "less developed" areas such as Wales and Scotland, which by election day had not been fulfilled, also does not seem to have been influential.35 Despite the fact that as an issue for election outcomes political integration plays only a very minor role in the view of most respondents, more than half of the legislators interviewed (57 percent) would challenge Community decisions that might affect unfavorably their constituents or the legislator himself. However, only 31 percent would consider it proper to simply disregard such decisions. Rather, most expressed the opinion that they would employ every means at their command to have these decisions changed through intervention of their governments in Brussels. In other words, national instruments would be used to change European level decisions in a "legal" manner, but the commitment to the principle of the Rechtsstaat prevents most legislators from not according to the Community deci- sions their force of law. The nationalities of the legislators most likely to challenge these decisions are the Danish, Irish, and Italians; the most likely to disregard them are the Italians and Danes. 31 International Herald Tribune (Paris), November 1 1, 1971. 32 See footnote 8.

Although the interests of specific groups in the consequences of integration intensified substantially on various occasions, no favor- able effects in terms of "spilover" were observed. The motivational aspects of our respondents' concern with the saliency of the integration issue and their reactions to compliance with Community decisions suggest an important link existing be- tween domestic politics and regional integration. It appears that many legislators are likely to make complicated calculations regarding the effects of Community decisions on their constituencies and evaluate their positions toward these decisions in the light of anticipated constituency reactions. Role perceptions of individual parliamentarians may play a part in these calculations and may be important inputs into these links. However, much more empirical study is required to better under- stand these links and the feedback process from Brussels to the member states and back to Brussels before definite conclusions can be drawn. National legislators and the European Parliament One means of strengthening the process of political unification might be the direct election of members of the European Parliament by universal suffrage and an increase in its powers. This would institute a measure of democratic control over the Community technocracy, which has been distrusted by some segments of the population in the member states, and would introduce a significant political dimension on the European plane that might materially enhance the legitimacy of the Community decision-making apparatus but may also increase schism. In order to test the attitudes of our respondents toward direct elections of the European Parliament and the effects of such elections on their own electoral ambitions, a number of pertinent questions were included in our interviews. First, we wanted to know whether they favored or opposed universal suffrage and two-thirds answered in the affirmative, 37 percent very much in favor and 31 percent somewhat in favor. Only 9 percent were strongly opposed. We asked our respondents their opinion about universal suffrage's effect on their own situations and once again we are struck with a difficult gap between favoring an ideal and sapping it in practice. From table 5 we learn that our two-thirds plurality of respondents favoring universal suffrage elections to the EP might have reservations about implementing what they advocate. Thirty-four percent of them see a directly elected EP as a threat to the importance of their national parliaments. Fifty-five percent-a 21 percent jump-see a directly elected EP as a threat to their personal prestige. What are the likely reasons for this disparity between ideal and practice? The ability to wield power, personal prestige, and the opportunity to rise on the political ladders obviously color a legislator's views and fuel his electoral ambitions. This is reflected in table 6 which provides answers to such questions as the</page><page sequence="17">Electoral ambitions and integration 463 Table 5.

Here we see fairly concrete and pursuasive evidence of the overall tendency to regard political integration as an ideal. One of its major institutions, the Parliament, is not given, in practice, much prestige or importance. At this time Strasbourg is not viewed as a step up in terms of the careers of our respondents. But if it is presented to them not in terms of its current reality but, rather, in terms of some vague, unspecified, and future enhancement in power, then the EP becomes increasingly attractive-a shift in opinion of 35 percent. Perhaps the most obvious impediment to a national legislator's career is the time he has to spend in Strasbourg on EP affairs. In 1971 a member of the EP had to attend an average of forty-five plenary sessions and twenty-five committee meetings, some of which required more than one day.36 Obviously such a schedule, which requires a fatiguing amount of air or train travel, makes it impossible for many legislators to take care adequately of the interests of their constituents and some of the European parliamentarians have lost their national assembly seats as a consequence.37 Compounding this problem is the need of many members of national parliaments to assure financial support by the national government for the municipalities or counties in which they hold elected or appointed posts. This cannot be done when prolonged absences are necessary. Another adverse effect of the duties performed in Strasbourg is the loss of influence in the national legisla- ture. Hence the opportunity to obtain a ministerial position or a leading job in the party is likely to be missed by national legislators who spend too much time away from their national posts, lack knowledge of current legislative proposals, and cannot anticipate shifts in the power distribution with their own legislative bodies. It is interesting to note that after the creation of the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC), the Common Assembly of that organization quickly assumed political powers that exceeded those actually assigned to it by the ECSC Treaty.38 At the same time, the members of the Common Assembly gained prestige and the position of assembly member was highly desired by the national parliamentarians. This trend continued after the establishment of the EEC and the European Atomic Committee (Euratom) and many of the most prestigious national legislators were elected to the European Parliament by the legislatures of the member states. However, as time went on and the enthusiasm for European unification began to 36 Bericht der ad hoc-Gruppe fur die Priifung der Frage Einer Erweiterung der Befugnnisse des Europiischen Parlaments "Bericht Vedel" Bulletin der Europaischen Gemeinschaften, Beilage 4/72. 3 For example, the French UDR deputies Tribolet and Deloncle, former vice president of the EP.

As a result, the national legislators who are at present delegates to the European Parliament do not enjoy the same prestige as was the case in earlier years and their position is not regarded any more as very important. In addition, among many legislators in the national parliaments the impression exists that the caliber of individuals elected to the European Parliament has deteriorated. Only the has-beens (some of whom actually were high caliber men), back benchers, and those who feel that they have risen to their highest political levels possible, volunteer for or accept positions in the EP which provides them with generous per diem and travel funds. Thus the perception of 56 percent of our respondents (72 percent if the "no opinion" holders are discarded) that the prestige of EP members has dropped from 1958 to 1973 and the view of 61 percent (75 percent disregarding the "no opinion" holders) that an EP position is likely to damage their political careers, reflect the political reality of the present situation regarding the European Parliament. Although the budgetary powers of the European Parliament were slightly expanded in 1970 when the Community was granted gradual, direct access to its own fiscal sources for fmancing the operations of its institutions, the circumstances described above have not changed. At the same time, calls for the direct election of the members of the European Parliament continue to be heard in meetings of national parties of the member states and elsewhere, but little actual progress toward this goal can be detected. To prepare the framework for direct elections of the European Parliament proposals were made in the Italian and German national legislatures as early as 1964 and 1965 to elect deputies to the European Parliament in connection with the elections to the national parliaments. In Italy the size of the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate was to be enlarged by twenty-four and twelve members respectively and in Germany thirty-six members of the Bundestag were to be elected to the European Parliament. But both efforts failed as both the practicability and legality of these measures were contested.39 In another initiative toward direct elections to the European Parliament the German Bundestag estab- lished early in 1971 an inter-parliamentary working group. However, after eight months of activity the group was dissolved and charges were made that despite the official expressions of the three major German parties in support of direct elections the attitude of the Social Democrats in the last analysis was negative and therefore the working group did not see much sense in continuing its efforts.40 Following the disbanding of the working group the Christian Democrats introduced again a bill to elect the members of the European Parliament concurrently with national elections, but the debate on this bill in the Bundestag in March 1972 indicated that 39Niblock, pp. 78, 79. 40 See Die Welt, November 6, 1971. The failure of the working group led to the defection of one SPD Deputy (Klaus Peter Schulz) to the CDU. The SPD claimed that it merely wanted to delay action until the applicant countries (Great Britain, Denmark, and Ireland) had become full members. Agence Europe Bulletin, November 1 8, 1972.</page><page sequence="20">466 International Organization the prospects for passage of the bill were very dim, particularly since some of the other Community member states did not show much enthusiasm for a direct election either.41 The same fate appears to be in store for a bill introduced in the Netherlands Parliament. A symposium on direct elections organized by the Euro- pean Parliament itself in the spring of 1972 did not fare any better despite many speeches urging direct elections. It may have been symptomatic that many well- known European politicians such as Mitterand, Lecanuet, Hallstein, and Wehner, whose appearance at this symposium had been announced originally, were con- spicuous by their absence.42 It is reasonable to assume that only with a uniform election day,43 and there- fore a common campaign, would any hope exist that direct elections would raise European consciousness among the electorate and facilitate the emergence of a "European" political leadership. Moreover, a common election campaign may also encourage the emergence of truly transnational political forces and parties. How- ever, there is also a danger in having a common election campaign if in the actual elections a large number of qualified voters should abstain from exercising their franchise. Clearly the effect of a high abstention rate would undermine the legitimacy role which direct elections could bring to the EP. In the long run the EP cannot perform its functions and bring about a higher level of democratization to the Community unless the present small number of European-oriented politicians is supplemented by a broad political leadership which looks toward the European Parliament as offering opportunities for influence and prestige. In this connection, we should express an additional caveat by returning to our comments made earlier that most election campaigns in Western European states have often been primarily ritual affairs. In view of the clear signals emerging from our interviews that electoral ambitions center on retaining positions of power as signified by seats in national parliaments and that legislators regard these seats as springboards for higher posi- tions on the political ladder, i.e., ministerial posts or party leadership positions, it is understandable that our respondents do not want to risk their careers by opting forcefully for direct elections. As has been indicated by the interviews, increased power for the European Parliament would help but it is obvious that to a large extent national legislators are faced with a vicious circle. Should the European Parliament obtain initially expanded powers, especially in the field of budgetary control, legislation, and effective control over the executive or should direct elections be instituted prior to the extension of power? Considering that there is a serious question whether direct elections by themselves would perform effectively the function of producing greater legitimacy and thereby provide leverage for increased powers for the European Parliament, most practicing politicians would prefer most likely to leave things as they are now.'

In our analysis we pursued four paths: personal motivations, constituency concerns, views of the European Parliament, and a sketch of the history of efforts for direct elections. As we review our findings the inescapable conclusion is that political integra- tion offers elites neither personal-material, nor electoral-partisan, nor institutional- prestige rewards that are unambiguous. That is, in the short run at least, political integration seems to offer no utilitarian value, no added votes, no improved status, and no increased political opportunities45 to national legislators. But if we accept this notion uncritically we do so at the expense of ignoring three very important pieces of evidence: 1. the expression of support for a greater level and scope of Community decision making, 2. the expression of a seeming desire for more decisive public opinion input into national legislative decisions affecting integration, 3. the degree of interest expressed in a European Parliament operating at a higher level of power. Any single one of these items could be -dismissed as merely lip service. But taken together they form a pattern of responses which seems to indicate some underlying phenomenon existing independently of the pessimistic responses to our motivational and election-oriented questions. It seems to us understandable that many Europeans with political and historical consciousness are torn between their nation states and the idea of a united Europe. A united Europe is attractive because it allows individually small or medium powers a forum in which to act as a great power-a role invented by Europeans but now largely played by Americans, Russians, and increasingly the Chinese and Japanese.

The Vedel Report (foot- note 36) suggests that the EP, during a transitional period, should have a power of "co- decision" with the Council of Ministers in such matters as the revision of the constituent Community treaties, the admission of new members, and ratification of international agree- ments. This power would be gradually increased to functional areas such as the CAP, taxation, etc. Co-decision would be more than consultation, but not really a definite veto.

Europe is simply too diffuse a concept to anchor men or cultures in history. Even Americans and Australians claim a European heritage. The evidence of the Italians being the most ardent spokesmen for political union and at the same time the greatest challengers and disregarders of Community decisions is an addi- tional confirmation of the gap between a diffuse ideal and hard-nosed political performance. When facts are viewed in light of the interference with the fence-mending job of politicians caused by service in Community institutions, such as the European Parliament, plus the low prestige attached to a seat in Strasbourg, it appears that both deep-rooted psychological habits and the practical political costs of partici- pating in Community institutional life interact to retard further integration. Our initial remarks were directed towards the recognized influence of elites in the process of integration. What we have found in practice is an elite group uncertain about what it wants. "Europe" serves as a convenient label for Dutch- men, Frenchmen, Germans, Italians, etc., when they are dealing with extra- continentals, but in terms of intra-continental relations, "Europeans's rather quickly revert to nation state frames of reference. From an anthropomorphic point of view, this is political schizophrenia. But what is pathological in man often makes good political sense. Political elite groups in Europe seem to find it convenient to alternate between being Europeans and being nationals, regardless of the tensions created between regional authorities and national institutions. They desire to have Europe speak with "one voice" in foreign affairs which conflicts with their power-oriented electoral ambitions. This is a conflict which will be difficult to resolve and poses a dimension in the study of the political integration process which requires considerably more empirical and theoretical attention than it has received so far. It bears on the concept of politicization as a variable for the promotion of spillover and political integration, a concept whose parameters may require redeflni- tion and whose validity on the basis of our findings might be in doubt.</page></plain_text>
