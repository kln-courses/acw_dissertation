<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Somnambulist's Story: Installation and the Tableau Briony Fer Installation has become not much more than a descriptive term for a now conventional way of doing things. As a term describing ways of making and showing art works which expand to occupy the whole of a room, or which are site specific, situated in or out of the art gallery or museum, it has become so capacious as to encompass large swathes of contemporary practice. Much of the most interesting work being produced now could be included under the term 'installation' - but one feels that whatever it is that is compelling or of critical and aesthetic value would absolutely not be that it is an installation. Though central to the contemporary language of art, it seems redundant as a critical term. Its original connotations as a critique of the institution of art have long since waned, given the dramatic if gradual way by which installation art has become the very means of the institution's survival and its most spectacular form. The point here is surely not to be nostalgic for installation's lost object but to map out the shifting terrain that it has come to occupy since that initial historical phase; not to trace a 'before' and 'after', a heyday of its radicalism followed by regression, but to see how installation from the outset was contradictory, caught up in the spectacle just as it put it in question; not to see all installation now as complicit with a kind of institutional orthodoxy but to see different forms of resistance. Rather than try to trace the history of installation art, I simply want to focus on a single moment in that history. And whilst the late 1950s saw a major shift in what Benjamin Buchloh has called the 'spatialization of the ready-made',' the critical moment I want to disentangle here is a slightly delayed one, at the start of the 1960s, when a structural problem or topos at the heart of what we now think of as installation was being particularly clearly worked through. The ways it figured then make it much more difficult either to think in terms of a simple progressive-regressive model (of installation as either for or against the institution) or in terms of the now familiar narrative of freedom from the constraints of the conventional art object as a thing-in-itself, and especially from the idea of the picture, that still colours most discussion of installation. At least I hope to make those connections and links less straightforward. In terms of its historical emergence in the 1960s, installation has generally been seen as a negation, as 'not painting' and as 'not sculpture', which is fine as far as it goes and certainly corresponds to what some of the artists were claiming at the time, but it is perhaps high time to explore further some of the aesthetic and theoretical density of the new models in formation at that moment. It is striking that few really critical analyses of installation as a separate category exist even though it has already passed through several phases. Of course there are problems separating it off. It is easy for a history of installation, tracing its development through Lissitsky's proun room, Schwitters' Merzbau, or Duchamp's doors at the Rue Larray simply to provide an alternative narrative of continuity to the conventional Modernist one - a history of 'disruptive' moments strung together to become just another fantasy of wholeness. My intention, on the other hand, is to try to get to the heart of a structural problem which remains both fundamentally split and unresolved - in many ways productively so - in a range of contemporary work. In order to do so, I want to OXFORD ART JOURNAL 24.2 2001 75-92 ( OXFORD UNIVERSITY PRESS</page><page sequence="2">Brionv Fer approach the subject of installation art somewhat obliquely, through a series of tableaux. These tableaux are not so much pictures of rooms as rooms themselves. My first is Proust's bedroom, which lays out the problem of the spectator as a viewing subject caught up in a spatial and temporal encounter. Tableau One Proust once wrote a short essay on 'Bedrooms', which eventually became the famous ouverture in Swann's Way, in which he remembered all the bedrooms he had ever slept in.2 He wrote of the recollection, of the sleep he slept in those rooms, and the waking from sleep he woke in those rooms. The sleeping subject is no longer the conscious centre of experience but simply 'a particle in that sleeping whole', in which everything was asleep, insensible, and yet 'kaleidoscopic' in the darkness.3 The inanimate things around the room take on what he calls 'a voluptuous insensibility', that is a kind of palpable indifference, so deep in torpor is he in sleep that 'even the sense of my whereabouts was mislaid in it.'4 Of all rooms, the bedroom is the most intimate and yet he is lost to himself. The word 'mislaid' suggests something temporary, inadvertent, even careless, but it is a loss nonetheless: a loss of a part of oneself. This is Proust then, entombed in his room, petrified in its stillness. It is a model of entrapment where the subject, like a hole at the centre of experience, is at one and the same time the only gauge of that experience as pure sensation. Even the stillness he perceives is projected, as he wonders 'if the immoveableness of things around us is not wished on them by our conviction that they are what they are and no other.'5 This is intuitively grasped when, on waking in a strange new place, things move and swirl around, like the all too mobile work of the unconscious. The work of re-assemblage that is writing brings to conscious thought an inchoate collage of smell, image, colour, and sound. It reveals a sensual and infantile world, ordered by the temporal rituals of childhood and haunted always by the figure of the mother. Then there is a distinct pause, and a second part of the essay unfolds to mirror the first, as if the one were a double of the other. Again, time unravels to the time of childhood, but now the bedroom has turned into a walk outside at night in a landscape that is 'a map of dreamland'.6 It might be a dream or a memory but it is certainly an enchanted place. And it is a place which opens up a different spatial experience because as he passes down a street he becomes a viewer. He is looking as he moves. Outside is a place to view the scenes in windows lit by lamplight where, behind the glass fronts, people 'unaware that we were watching them, single-mindedly performed for our benefit the dazzling private theatricals of their improbable everyday lives.'7 Of course the everyday itself is improbable to Proust as he is bewitched by the spectacle (for Proust, being Proust looks down) but it becomes fixed in a series of tableaux vivants. They transfix the viewer, against the rest of experience which is otherwise utterly shifting uncertainty. Lives are performed and have become only display; private rituals and intimacies have become only spectacle. In the double structure of his short reflections, Proust sets out a series of reversals - for example, of mobility and stillness, inside and outside, entrapment and entrancement - that opens up the problem of installation in a new way. The temporal order of recollection is mapped spatially in such a way as to create two models of the subject quite at odds with one another. One is what I shall call the model of an encrusted body, with the rooms of his recollection becoming like a kind of carapace. 'Thus my body builds around it room after room',8 he writes. The subject is entombed in memory as these rooms, as he put it, file through his 78 OXFORD ART JOURNAL 24.2 2001</page><page sequence="3">The Somnambulist's Story: Installation and the Tableau recollection. Entirely solitary, this is a model of the subject caught inside the multiple layers of his infantile self, lost to himself. The other model reverses the first in a scene of watching and entrancement. The subject is subject to a whole series of tableaux, both rivetted by, and cut off from, the scenes before him. Shops 'lit from within like an aquarium',9 Proust writes, dazzle the viewer in a similar way to his description of the kaleidoscopic patterns of light created by the magic lantern that would fill the walls of the house at Combray with light in Swann's Way. The opaqueness of the walls would be substituted by light and colour, creating walls of light not unlike the cinema. And Proust's liquid light is closer, ultimately, to cinema than it is to theatre. One tableau follows another, like a suite of frames, or suddenly switches, like a cinematic cut. My point is not to make a contrast between inside and outside but rather between these two models. One is the subject enwrapped, shrouded, maybe entrapped; the other is the subject entranced by the tableau. Proust's essay lurches between the two: between a heightened sensory awareness of things, space, body, - the subject as pure sense-instrument - and, on the other hand, a separation or loss of connection, a kind of wilful elimination from the scene of fantasy in which one is enmeshed. The tableau cuts the continuity of experience. It cuts the liquid of memory. But the tableau is also constitutive - without it, we are just fish, swimming around. Installation, as we might understand it historically and psychically, also plays between these two models. The protocols of viewing an object, at a certain kind of distance, with a certain set of expectations of what the sculptural or pictorial object consists, were radically transformed in the Minimalist moment in the early 1960s. The encounter with a series of objects or incidents within the context of an installation may entrap the viewer, or even make it unclear what is the object of attention. And whilst the sensory effect of a situation may seem all-embracing, it is, of course, as mediated as any other kind of experience, though by redefined expectations, conventions and models of viewing. Things may not necessarily look like pictures for them still, nowadays, to perform a pictorial function. Indeed one of the radical consequences of the Minimalist moment was precisely to detach what could come to be seen as a pictorial function from its immutable connection to the kind of thing a picture conventionally is, that is, something hanging on a wall. And whilst I would want to stress the fact that installation covers the most disparate range of work and interests imaginable now, one tendency within it continues to be towards the tableau as a pictorial idiom. By this I do not just mean the kind of installations that take the form of tableaux but also more broadly the role of the photographic model of the tableau. It is almost impossible to imagine a history of installation without photography to document it. The photograph can turn everything into a picture, and whatever history we give installation is represented through a photographic narrative. Some key moments had no photographs to document them. For example, Yves Klein once emptied all of the furniture out of Dr Allendy's consulting rooms in a move pre- empting The Void, but there is a sense that this actually enhances the myth around Klein's activities. Other moments have been lost, presumably, because there is no such record either verbal or visual, but such ellipses can increase the overall power of the narrative itself. I want to stress the continually pressing insistence of the picture's relationship to installation, just as Alex Potts has so effectively stressed the ways in which the 'encounter' in installation is a reconfiguration of, rather than a simple reaction against, the dynamics of a sculptural encounter as its protocols developed and changed through the course of the twentieth century.10 Similarly to that attributed to sculpture, a cult of direct experience has tended to be OXFORD ART JOURNAL 24.2 2001 79</page><page sequence="4">Briony Fer associated with installation on the assumption that these are 'real' objects and 'real' spaces rather than just pictures. As Tom Crow has said of Arte Povera and its debt to Beuys, there is an almost romantic belief in a directness that recovers something from the corrupting and alienating conditions of modernity."1 The role played by the photograph in constructing these mythic events does not need to be laboured here. Anyway, the point is a more far-reaching one, where the spectator's involvement as a protagonist within the scene of an encounter takes place within a field of representation. An overwhelming desire to see performance art as the 'experience of experience'12 seems to me symptomatic of the very same cult of experience which it seeks to historicize. The privileging of experience in this way tends to keep the subject of experience very much centre- stage and in place. Bodily and sensory experience may now be in play over a purely optical aesthetic, but the place of the subject remains intact. Proust's model of dislocation foregrounded the double-action of entrapment and entrancement as it is experienced by the subject; there is always a cost for the subject, a temporary loss incurred, a 'cut' on lived experience as pure empathy. This is not to diminish the impact of the 'phenomenological turn', as Alex Potts has dubbed the radical shifts in the early 1960s,13 but to acknowledge the force of its disruptive effects on the spectator or viewing subject. The working out of an antagonism to modernist concerns was often articulated at the time through the metaphor of theatre both by those that wanted to guard modernist values and those who wanted to break away from its constraints. The theatrical metaphor has become so ubiquitous that it has almost completely saturated the discourses of installation. Michael Fried, in his famous critique of Minimalism, was not the first to use it by any means, but without doubt has subsequently been the most influential to do so. Fried objected to the way, in Minimalism, it is as if the work were incomplete without the beholder, as if the work has 'been waiting for him' and 'refuses, obstinately to let him alone'.14 Famously, Fried saw this as 'theatrical', thus contaminating the autonomous nature of aesthetic experience properly understood. Subsequently, Fried's argument has been turned around 180 degrees and used not to criticise but to validate and even celebrate the performative aspects of Minimalism.15 And whilst it is obvious why the theatrical metaphor opens up in productive ways the crucial role of the performativity of the art object, it has also, in many ways, been taken too much for granted. From the late 1950s, Allan Kaprow was one of the first to insist on how inappropriate was the theatrical metaphor in that it presupposed a separation of an audience in visual theatre where he wanted to create total absorption - where to enter the work is to become surrounded and to become part of the surroundings.16 From this point of view, Fried, who counted Kaprow amongst the same tendency as the Minimalists, used theatre as a handle (principally standing for a kind of time or duration alien to art) in a way that was itself symptomatic of a deeper problem. Brian O'Doherty's essays entitled 'Inside the White Cube' are still probably the best history of installation, without actually being about installation. First written as a series of articles for Artforum in 1976, they are both symptomatic of that moment of expansion and analytic of it. In the course of his reflections on the changing nature of gallery space and the spectator's encounters with and within it, he makes some striking observations on just this point. He remarks on the simple but important fact that avant-garde gestures 'have two audiences: one which was there and one - most of us - which wasn't'.17 Memory completes the work which at the time of its happening is necessarily incomplete; 'photographs of the event restore to us the original moment, but with much ambiguity'.18 This 80 OXFORD ART JOURNAL 24.2 2001</page><page sequence="5">The Somnambulist's Story: Installation and the Tableau says much about the disruptive narratives of the avant-garde, but also the dislocation between event and memory where the 'original audience is often restless and bored by its forced tenancy of a moment it cannot fully perceive - and that often uses boredom as a kind of temporal moat around the work.'19 The photograph plays an important but curious role then, as a kind of primordial fact of experience that is necessarily in the past, and often lost. He nicely describes Duchamp's Mile of String, a gesture of suspending, looping and stretching string, a spectacular but irregular cobweb which shrouds a Surrealist exhibition in New York in 1942, as 'an image of dead time'.20 As it appears in the photograph, and as it has been subjected, therefore, to an act of composition, the endless web has been stopped dead, but also lingers indefinitely, like a still frame that is held. In a way the photograph both cancels and animates the phenomenal character of the installation and vice versa. O'Doherty traced the emergence of the tableau as a genre in the work of artists like Segal and Keinholz where 'the illusionistic space within the traditional picture is actualised in the body of the gallery'.21 Loosely arranged furniture or mocked-up rooms expanded sculpture into a kind of stage set, existing in real rather than imaginary space. Although such work might look rather different from the abstract models of Minimalism, one could think of its literalizing impulse as opening the way precisely for the minimalist approach to the object (and Judd of course includes them in his essay 'Specific Objects'22). And with the tableau, O'Doherty goes on, the gallery 'impersonates' other spaces - say, a bar, a hospital room, a gas station, a bedroom, or whatever. But whilst others, like Kaprow had called for a total absorption of the subject in his or her surroundings, and a blurring of art and life in what he called 'total art', O'Doherty drew attention to the way the tableau form made the spectator feel as if one should not be there, as if one were trespassing on the scene. In Segal's work, the figures appear like simulacra of the living 'and ignore us with . . . the irritating indifference of the dead'.23 This irritant runs counter to Fried's animating anthropomorphism of Minimalist objects. O'Doherty's own particular brand of anthropomorphism instead brings out the psychic resonance and, most strikingly, the cost to the subject who enters the scene of the work, where the pictorial effect of the tableau itself imposes a kind of deathly stasis. Laura Mulvey has recently argued that a tension between movement and stillness so central to cinema even from its beginnings in its initial animation of the still frame, follows the logic of the death-drive.24 Whilst I do not want to say that installation is like cinema, I do want to say that the metaphorics of theatre and performativity that are often, if not usually, applied to it tend to miss this sense of stasis and the very dialectic of mobility and stillness which Proust set in train. A mise-en-scene would seem an appropriate description of Oldenburg's Bedroom Ensemble (Fig. 1) from 1963. This is a work where the connections to the cinematic are more striking than usual, certainly more so than to the theatre. At first sight it looks like a room of familiar furniture but otherwise empty like a set which either has been or is waiting to be occupied (tell-tale signs of the former, like the coat thrown on the sofa, are contradicted by the artificial newness of the latter). The colours and textures mimic a particular kind of American modern and Don Judd praised it as 'a thorough corruption of all its sources'.25 It is even a corruption of the ready-made aesthetic that seems to drive it, as you almost immediately realize that the shapes of the furniture are massively distorted. They are distorted, in fact, to exaggerate the shapes of perspectival recession one would find in a picture. The bed, for example, is a very large parallelogram. The things, materials, textures are nothing if not literal, and yet nothing is quite what it seems. The materials are all ersatz: the sheets are OXFORD ART JOURNAL 24.2 2001 81</page><page sequence="6">Briony Fer white plastic, the bedcover is black vinyl. Then there is all the fake fur, like the fake zebra skin, the fake fur coat and so on. From the synthetic zebra tightly stretched across the bedhead to the coat strewn on the sofa like a shed skin, they have the heightened, material presence of kitsch, which is characteristically highly desirable and lurid at the same time. This is a dream map of commodity culture and its projected desires. It is striking that in the photographs of this piece, the distortions play to the vision of the camera, ironing out the grossly distorted shapes and to some extent accommodating them. This is a three- dimensional work that approximates itself to the conditions of a flat picture, where the shapes are made to correspond to a perspectival fantasy. A three- dimensional work pretending to be a flat image looks pretty odd; it is more surprising that it does not look even odder, but maybe that is just because we are used to viewing in these different modes. It is an illusionistic conceit, but one which seems to mimic not just a 'real room' but the pulling out and panning shots of the camera in the distended surface of the bed. It may be 'grossly geometric', as Judd put it,26 but the objects of the tableau also spread and distend into view, only to be made to conform again to the limiting conditions of a photograph. Far from being simply a documentary record of the piece, the photograph of the installation is, as it were, already structurally embedded in the experience of the installation from the outset. Bedroom Ensemble is empty and still, and slightly eerie. It is offered as something inviting but it is also more than a little chilly with its shrill turquoise touches. Fundamentally, though, the sense of detachment derives from the play Oldenburg sets in train between the different registers of the tableau - between the pictorial tableau and the Fig. 1.

But pictorial in a sense that has dramatized the purely fetishistic character of the picture at the same time as its separation from the kind of object a picture conventionally is. What it sheds in the process is the auratic nature of the object which is the picture, whilst retaining its fetish character. This marks a critical point in the fate of the pictorial at modernism's moment of disintegration. And what is striking here is the way that at precisely the point when the tableau establishes itself in this new form, so too one finds the dispersal of the tableau. Barthes had suggested that it would not be hard to find in a post-Eisensteinian cinema such a dispersal or 'pulling to pieces' of the tableau, the setting in movement of the 'partial organs' of the human figure. But here, rather than a chronological marker, one finds a dramatic splitting. This is an extreme point where, as Barthes notes, the tableau has 'no support, it gapes open.'29 It works against the work of the tableau and gapes on to a mass of partial objects. Of course, it never entirely escapes the tableau form, but the tableau is not constitutive. Kusama's installation entitled Aggregation: One Thousand Boat Show (Fig. 2), held at the Gertrude Stein Gallery in New York in 1964, is exemplary of this 'gaping' movement. It is highlighted in the photograph which she had taken of herself in the installation where she poses with her back to us, as it were, back to front. It is true that she performs or stages herself as a subject, but she also performs, I think, an operation of dispersal upon the fact of the image itself. The body of Kusama in the photograph is reversed to face away from us, but also to reveal the back of her which seems single, sealed, and contained. The figure of the back is then, in turn, explosively reversed in the open figure of the boat which faces the viewer, exposing a mass of multiple phallic moulds. And then again, in a forever mobile circuit, the identical images of the phallic form of the boat are replicated around the room. Through such metonymic slippage, her back appears phallic, and the phallus comes to look like the image of the picture with its sealed edges. The chain of repetition, though, has unsettling effects. As Mignon Nixon has put it, 'the phallus as a singular, discrete entity is lost in its proliferation and dispersal'.30 But it is also the phallic nature of the tableau itself which is both visualized and undone; as a photographic tableau which stages Kusama in the mise-en-scene of her installation, but in its many repetitions it unmakes the picture just as it would seem to set it in train.31 Kusama seems to have been keenly aware of the relationship between her installations and the photographs that were taken of them. A dispersal is enacted on the body to produce a proliferation of the body-in-pieces in the photographs as much as the installations themselves.32 The fact that she cut up OXFORD ART JOURNAL 24.2 2001 83</page><page sequence="8">Briony Fer Fig. 2.

Courtesy Robert Miller Gallery, New York. photographs of her work to make collages makes this clear, as if her cutting could reverse the 'cut' of the tableau. From this point of view, Compulsion Furniture (Accumulation) (1964, Fig. 3) uses photographic means to counter the tableau effect of the photograph - like a kind of negative resist. Kusama was obviously not the only artist to use collages in this way; others, like Gordon Matta-Clark, also made collages that severed the act of composition. But there is something very distinctive about Kusama's cramming of the image, which relates to the way she literally stuffed and crammed things together in the objects that she made. There is a huge maximizing of the surface area, a vastly expanded crust of surface, like a (now) brittle, white carapace. Whilst they are often described as fetishistic because of the obviously phallic protuberances, the movement seems to me absolutely not the movement of the fetish as I have been discussing it here as the fetishistic cut of the tableau. Rather, the point is to thicken a surface to such a state of crowded intensity that it proliferates to infinity, endlessly repeated, where 'repetition', as Deleuze once said, appears as 'the unconscious of representation'.33 The subject is distributed across this scene of dispersal. In Kusama's 84 OXFORD ART JOURNAL 24.2 2001</page><page sequence="9">The Somnambulist's Story: Installation and the Tableau installation Aggregation: One Thousand Boat Show, the subject is caught in its midst, and caught in a kind of violent limbo between image and object, back and front, single and multiple, effect and idea. And if the walls are a kind of wrapping around the space that the body occupies, then it seems like the layers are perforated and full of holes. Kusama produced similar effects in many of her collages but also in her use of mirrors which expanded her installations to a point of infinity - but infinity as an endless series of transparent layers encasing the subject in a never-ending panorama. In the rowing boat of Aggregation an odd stiletto heel is embedded and painted over monochrome white like all the rest of the stuffed phallic projections that crowd out the boat's inside. It was common for her to incorporate objects like this in work which clustered in closer and closer arrangements. Donald Judd, who liked her work a great deal, worried over what he saw as these 'literary' references, especially in her work called Ten Guest Table. He saw the cutlery she included in this piece as extraneous and narrative, distracting from what he thought strong in the work, its 'obsessive repetition'.34 Judd would, you might say. But maybe his anxiety also pointed to something important, that is importantly and productively unresolved in Kusama - and that is the continually unsteady relationship between repetitive series and narrative impulses in the work. Maybe it pushes a little hard (for Judd) the idea of the series and the serial as a new form of narrative; not as the new form of narrative, but as one form of address amongst several competing or heterogeneous ones. This is, I think, a radically redefined idea of a narrative drive which splits into multiple series, where one series might mutate into another, like the way stiletto shoes appear and reappear in a number of her works. A single shoe buried in the crust of Aggregation multiplies to many on the ladder in Travelling Life (1964) or Eleven Feet (1963) as if it migrates in a metonymic action to become a trigger for a number of alternative configurations. The serial as a form of repetition opens i?- ~-:'~4 ; ,- Fig. 3. Yoyoi Kusama: Compulsion Furniture (Accumulation), c1964, photocollage and paint, 8 x 98 ins. ? Yoyoi Kusama.

The artist and critic Mel Bochner would say that it was seriality that led to situation.35 Dan Flavin's fluorescent light tubes attached at intervals around a room would activate, through light, the whole room. Ready-made, coloured fluorescent tubes were hung vertically, horizontally, or at an angle, singly or in multiples; in some, the modular units would increase or decrease in a serial progression. He would combine standard coloured tubes or use them monochromatically, as he did in one room of an early exhibition at the Green Gallery in 1964 in which only green tubes were used. The lights were positioned in the sparest of arrangements leaving lots of wall clear, adjusting the whole interior to a new pattern of articulation (Judd likened the effect to what he called an 'interior exoskeleton'36). This necessarily put pressure on the singleness of the individual art work and led to its expansion to fill a whole room or situation. In one sense, this seems rather different to the emphasis which I gave to the role of the tableau in Oldenburg and others in the earlier part of this essay. But like Kusama's, Flavin's work disrupts the tableau by an excessive stretching of its limits, where the carapace that encases the subject is gradually turned inside out. The point is not to contrast the one with the other, but rather to note than one is merely the flip side to the other, that at a structural level the tableau and the series intersect. After all, Flavin's fluorescents could also be seen, almost like Oldenburg's, as a dream map of ready-made commodity colours and effects, but in walls of light. And one of the notable things about Flavin's light installations was that, although the fluorescents were fixed to the wall as a picture might be, they forced a re-orientation of the spectator in relation to the walls - and so to the whole shape of the room. On the one hand, you could see (especially) his multi-coloured installations as highly pictorial, playing as they do on extraordinary nuance of colour effects, yet pictorial in the sense that they are no longer attached to the kind of thing a picture is. Flavin, on the other hand, is relatively unconcerned with the photographic or cinematic tableau in the way many of his contemporaries were.37 The relation between series and tableaux would be dramatized by others, not least by Warhol. Kusama also produced tableau pieces, including her mannequins in a sea of macaroni, as well as a series of six slide projections of herself walking in full Japanese costume around New York. It is as if this becomes a particularly vivid means to embody such dislocation. Robert Smithson would make these connections clearer and bring them closer to cinema in his Tour of the Monuments of Paissac, his famous illustrated essay published in Artforum in December 1967. Smithson described a trip he made with an instammatic camera through the industrial landscape of New Jersey and the photographs he took. The photographs appeared in the article as a series which followed the order in which he saw them: The Bridge Monument, The Great Pipe Monument, The Fountain Monument, The Sand-Box Monument, and so on. The monuments are man-made incursions into the barren landscape, as well as markers on a map. Most of all, especially in the intense light of a noonday sun, the experience is cinematic, as if Smithson as a subject enters into a series of already-pictured scenes where he is not so much the creator of the tableau as a blank screen onto which they are imprinted. As he encounters his first monument, a bridge crossing the river Paissac, he writes 'Noon-day sunshine cinema-ized the site, turning the bridge and the river into an over-exposed picture.'38 As it got hotter, the sun became a monstrous light bulb which projected a detached series of 'stills' on to his eye. A little later, in the midst of the non-landscape or 'zero-panorama' that he describes with a kind of shrill, bleak beauty, he gets confused: 'I had been wandering in a moving picture I 86 OXFORD ART JOURNAL 24.2 2001</page><page sequence="11">The Somnambulist's Story: Installation and the Tableau couldn't picture', he writes.39 He calls it at one point a mise-en-scene but this is a mise-en-scene with an empty place for the protagonist. The lustrous shine on the cars reflected in a late afternoon sun end up dazzling and blanking out, rather than affirming, the place of the subject. The serial form of the suite of photographs cuts right across the mise-en-scene and spreads it out like a reel of film. The picture unravels in serial form. This would seem to be situated at the opposite pole to Oldenburg's tableau in Bedroom Ensemble whose subject conforms to the tableau's constraints only in its wild distortions, and yet is possible to imagine as a consequence of a structural imperative that had emerged from a similar root: the fact of not only being fully conversant with, but fascinated and held by the serial forms of mass spectacle, or what could equally well be termed, simply, the everyday. Tableau Three, Times Three And so to now. I want to sketch out three outcomes of the structural knot I have tried to describe; three different ways of reconfiguring the subject's relation to the tableau on the one hand and the series on the other; three different takes on the everyday. Of course, the critical terrain has shifted, but there is still a sense in which these critical problems remain unsettled, and in which they continue to animate a range of work in installation now. The continuing lure of the picture can be traced back to the emerging models of installation as both medium and genre at the start of the 1960s. The proneness of installation to fulfil the demands of the picture has been there, then, from the outset, but so too has what I have called its capacity to resist those very same demands. In one sense, this problem has become, if anything, more rather than less pressing, though the work may take different forms. The kinds of storytelling traditionally associated with pictures have been re-invented and transformed in the multiple narratives of installation. This has led to new forms of narrative, as well as some that are not so new. While other mediums may die or at least become exhausted because they have no more stories to tell, installation's exhaustion may be marked by its having only stories to tell - even if those stories are now stories of fragmentation. I have tried to show how Kusama's work critically engaged with the idea of new forms of narrative - which must include the series as a kind of narrative which self- reflexively exposes the compulsive momentum of its own drive. In the same spirit, what I plot here is a resistance to such stories in what you could call an inventory of the everyday. As such, it is work that keeps the tableau or picture at bay or in a continually unstable relation and which impose some sort of block on the workings of the spectacle at the same time as producing it. Martin Creed's work veers between very small things that are hardly noticeable and very large installations of rooms full of balloons which are the opposite; between things that are either too small to be considered as a picture or a sculpture or an art work at all and those that fill a room to capacity or rather more. A minute stack of masking tape attached to the wall of the gallery is simply an addition to the wall which changes the wall in the slightest way but nonetheless alters it (Fig. 4). The room filled with white balloons more or less presses the viewer, who is in the middle of it, out of the space of the room (Fig. 5). The spectacle is literally inflated with so many balloons cramming the interior but so much so that it becomes impossible to see. It is a blocked vision in a sea of white. Using materials that range from masking tape to neon to blu- tack to balloons to scrunched balls of paper, Creed creates an inventory of quite ordinary things that absolutely refuse to dramatize the role of a protagonist as Fig. 4.

The more spectacular size and scale of the balloon pieces inflate in one way but also deflate, with humour and play, and obscure anything that could be called a spectacle. The neon works take the form of words that seem like forms of address: 'Things', one clamours in bright lights, silently. The links between the works seem pretty indirect and random, yet the kinds of thing he makes can be seen as series of randomly connected things. This is more like an inventory or list because of its repetitive nature rather than a collage. That is, it is as if the things do not link up except as part of a list, in elliptical, adjacent and apparently incidental ways. As Deleuze has written of the cinema, it can be the weak connections between things that gives a powerful sense of disintegration overall. In cinema, this makes possible, he claims, a re-linkage by irrational cuts, where re-linkage is a kind of assemblage without totality.40 Creed's work has an effect of disintegration but yet it is not quite assemblage, nor is it collage in the tradition of modernist disruption either. Rather, the list or inventory has superseded the collage aesthetic as a strategy. Collage, or rather a collage aesthetic, was the additive method par excellence and central to the formation of installation; in a sense, Creed dispenses with collage in favour of the list in order to dismantle what has now so clearly become the spectacle of installation. Creed's often minor alterations draw attention to a series of moves whereby one thing simply adds up to another. An inventory of light is quite a different thing. Rachel Whiteread's Watertower (Fig. 6), originally made for a Soho rooftop, was a site-specific and impermanent piece, to be glanced at by the passer-by on the sky-line.41 Made of resin, it absorbed the surrounding light, or lack of it. Depending on the different daytime lights and weather conditions, it moved from being fairly inconspicuous to quite dramatic. At dusk, as the light failed, it disappeared; at night, it became invisible, quite unlike Proust's story of dazzlement as he walked outside at night with which I began. When I first tried to find it, arriving late in the afternoon in winter, it had already gone: all that remained was a faint, opaque rectangle on the top of the building where it should have been. It was like Georges Perec's brilliant description of an inventory of black and near-black in his story 'The Man Asleep', 88 OXFORD ART JOURNAL 24.2 2001</page><page sequence="13">The Somnambulist's Story: Installation and the Tableau which is in part a reconfiguration of Proust's. Perec describes 'a dark volume broken by details'42, the more or less dark, the half-light, the minutest shifts from the evenly grey to the absolutely black. If Whiteread's Tower stretched unevenly away in darkness, it could also disappear in white light. Its endlessly changing appearance could make it look deadpan or it could explode in light. It is perfectly still and yet continually mobile. It moves continually within the field of vision as you walk past it, a crystalline patch looming on the sky-line. It was not by any means the first time sculpture has appeared on the tops of buildings - it is just that in general we do not notice that kind of decorative sculpture. And it does not usually look like this, or seem so oblique to the composition of the city and its patterns. Its material presence is continually being modified by the surrounding conditions, making it lumpen and heavy or disperse in light. This is another kind of inventory of the everyday from Creed's. This is one tower among many, marked out by light. Almost like a photo-sensitive surface, it picks up light but its habit of almost disappearing from view makes it easy to mislay. As such, it is part of the spectacle of the city but also its negative resist, a breakdown of its logic; like a liquid light of dissolution of the very scene that it constitutes. Finally, I want to say something about Sarah Lucas's installation at the Freud Museum in 2000, which brings me back to the problem of the interior, the tableau and the narrative drive. Lucas runs riot with all of these, and especially with the narratives of psychoanalysis. She created a series of mise-en-scenes within the already powerful mise-en-scene of the Freud Museum: Beyond the Pleasure Principle (Fig. 7) upstairs in the bedroom, The Pleasure Principle in the dining room, and Hysterical Attack (Mouths) and Hysterical Attack (Eyes) (Fig. 8) in the downstairs study. The installation is both a breakdown and a salvage of the mise-en-scene, brought together as a rough inventory of body parts which do not link up, but which are stretched, distorted, and detached. Everything becomes a body-part in Lucas's work, even when it is not one, in breasts- as- lightbulbs and phallic fluorescents. It takes the anthropomorphism of Oldenburg and Kusama and makes it rampage through the lexicon of Freud's symbols. The stuff is put together in slightly ludicrous ways, for example, the mattress slung up on a April 2000. Courtesy Sadie Coles HQ.

Characteristically, Lucas used a mixture of media, including a giant photograph of herself behind Freud's couch, as well as ready-made bits and pieces like the chairs and underwear that form the surrogate bodies. Piled-up furniture, of the kind found on a London street or in second hand shop, mimics the respective places of figure and pedestal. Even more, there is a sense in which parts of a tableau are dismantled and re-assembled. This has the effect of a dissection of parts, anarchically managed. The two pieces entitled Hysterical Attack are made of papier-mach6 and covered with tiny cut-out photographs of mouths on one, and eyes on the other. Varnished, these are shiny, encrusted shells of bodies mutating from the chairs. The little cut-outs from magazines make the surface look a bit like mosaic or bakelite, and slightly archaic. All the materials Lucas uses are discarded in one way or another. Even the titles of the works, collaged from Freud's stories are bits and pieces like the rest. Here, unlike Creed, there is a strong element of assemblage, but assemblage that has come to be set up as a tableau might. A series of set-pieces has replaced serial repetition. The setting of Freud's house triggers a stream of narratives, Freud's narratives, to which the titles point with tongue-in-cheek. It is pointless, though, to see Lucas's works as vehicles for these stories or any other, at least in the strict sense. Because the power of the objects here seems to be that they do not contain the story, but they are empty shells to which such stories temporarily stick. They are more like the endlessly repeated cut-outs, cut from their context. Lucas's objects are evacuated of the storytelling drive which surround them at the same time as they are so heavily laden with them that the place is full of their innuendo. They shriek, as slangy antidotes to their mise-en-scene. And of course they are an antidote to Proust's bedroom as well, as the ultimate threat to its eerie stillness and deathly pallor. Death here is a riot, a wake. I am grateful to The Leverhulme Trust for a Research Fellowship which has enabled me to write this article. 1.
