A frog jumps in: The water's sound! - Basho There are many kinds of trips, and many differences among those kinds. If we venture into an exploration of those differences, we find races, strolls, parades, journeys, jaunts, jun- kets, hikes, treks, tours (whirlwind, whistle-stop, and inspection), as well as errands, marches, and patrols. And of course attacks, retreats, and flights before fury are also kinds of trips. Each of these has its peculiar structure or logic, and in the logic of the trips we take, we can discern the texture of our lives. Recently I made a trip to see a patch of virgin forest in a remote upland hollow. This trip was a quest. I call it a quest because that term displays the logic of an encounter with wilder- ness. A quest must have a sacred goal. It must be fraught with peril. It must engage the whole being in a noble purpose combin- ing determination, awe, and holy dread. No one may enter on a quest lightly, for solemn ritual is required, and the pilgrim must approach his goal as he would an altar: with ceremonial fear. The goal of my quest was wilderness. No - my goal was the experience of wilderness. My grail was not a mere object, but one pole of an encounter. I sought wilderness to observe it, to engage it in an act of seeing. I wanted to be there, participating in the wilderness. Then what was my peril? Simply that the experience I wished to have was self-contradictory. It had an inconsistent John Churchill, former Rhodes Scholar at New College, Oxford, is Associate Professor of Philosophy at Hendrix College. His articles have appeared in The American Oxonian, Sophia, and The Thomist. His chief philosophical interests center upon Wittgenstein and the Philosophy of Religion. He has written an article titled "Value and Collegiate Sports" and is overjoyed to find himself located in close proximity to the canoe streams of the Ozark Mountains. 206</page><page sequence="2">GODS, FROGS, AND SOJOURNS 207 structure of expectation. I was both knight errant and dragon on my own quest. This seems odd because we do not ordinarily wish for the self-contradictory. Nor do we ordinarily find, except in the travail of psychoanalysis, that we are ourselves the obstacles to our own wishes. So I want to reflect on this peculiar peril that I presented to myself in my quest after wilderness. I recently discovered that I return from canoe trips in a certain predictable frame of mind - vague frustration. "Next time," I think, "next time it will go right. I will drink more wine, or I will drink no wine at all. I will have different companions, or none at all. I will be alone. I will be quieter, go slower, watch more, and think less. I will strive for transparency. I will be invisible. I will be absent." And so time after time I return from the creeks feeling that the experience I sought has eluded me because I was there seeking it. This was the peril in my quest after the virgin forest. The structure of my expectation condemned it to failure: I wanted to encounter the unencountered. I wanted both to be there and to be absent - to have an experience incompatible with my being there having it. What is it like to "be there"? One of the greatest philosophers of the century wrote: "The self is not in the world; rather, it stands outside it, as the eye is outside its visual field." Is the human mind with its experience a part of the world, a part of nature? For environmentalist or engineer, the answer has been that it is not. The human subject of experience lies outside nature. Thus the human presence, even in seeing, must be either an unwelcome intruder or a privileged conqueror. We may stand in alien awe before the pristine natural world (defiling it, however, by our very gaze), or we may take dominion, in the confidence that an anthropomorphic God has authorized our exploitation. But whether we choose to treasure the untouched beauties of nature, deplore the hand of man, and seek nourish- ment in the untracked wilderness, or to speak of natural re- sources, exploit opportunities for development, and measure forests in board feet, we have presupposed alienation. This alienation is more a complex of dispositions and attitudes than an articulable belief, but its roots stretch deep into the religious and economic history of the West. Only the technologi- cal prowess of industrial culture has exhibited it in a form stark enough for recognition, so we are apt to blame technology. This is a mistake. Technology is not the cause of our alienation from</page><page sequence="3">208 SOUNDINGS the world of our experience. It is the friendly symptom without which our malady would be invisible, and thus beyond treat- ment. Technology merely exhibits our malaise and opens the possibility of cure. Until recently only a few on the outskirts of culture, them- selves alienated from alienation, have indicated that something was wrong. "I think I could turn and live with animals," wrote Whitman, "they are so placid and self-contained; I stand and look at them long and long." Sweating, whining, weeping about sins, duty, God, dissatisfaction, the mania of owning things, respectability, industriousness: this is Whitman's catalogue of the concerns of industrial culture. Yet: "I think I could turn and live with animals." Here Whitman captures the image that has haunted our alienation. The animal, especially the wild animal, splendid and free, has become for us a myth. We conceive him as a being fully and unreflectively integrated into his world, for whom life, experience, and the world are indistinguishable. "They are so placid and self-contained." We ache to embrace that calm. Our alienation radiates an intensely moral concern to protect wild animals, especially the anointed "endangered species." What do the snail darter, the fat pocketbook pearly mussel, and the snow leopard have in common? They are all talismans of our interest in the wilderness that we exterminate. They are repre- sentatives of the world we destroy by inhabiting it. Yet also, they are symbols of our eagerness to disappear from ourselves into the unreflective unity of the wild. We use them doubly: their vanishing feeds our anxiety to vanish; yet as they pass away so passes wilderness itself. The structure of our experience is in- consistent: we want to have an encounter incompatible with our being there having it. So, the wilderness is cultivated and domes- ticated in our act of preserving it. And as we kill our gods by writing theological propositions, we emasculate our mythic animals by placing them in zoos and preserves where their wildness may be safely inspected. Even the youngest child soon sees this fraud. At the zoo we see a myth, certainly, but not the myth of the wild, unreflective world. Be- hind the bars we see peering back the symbols of our own entrapment. For a similar reason keeping a pet never quite fulfills our hope. The dog descends to a brutal parody of human- ity: a caricature of our own foreignness. He sits, he begs, he barks</page><page sequence="4">GODS, FROGS, AND SOJOURNS 209 at my command. He is embarrassed, jealous, wags his tail. He joins us in reflection. He is human, but not even that, quite. "I think I could turn and live with animals." But in our confusion and poverty, even the urban possum who robs our garbage is a totem brother. By asserting the possum as my toÂ£em brother I claim to be what I am not: as self-possessed, immediate, and unreflective as he. He is whole, and I am filled with malaise. I act, I speak, I think. But also I know that I act, know that I speak, know that I think. Descartes gave us: "I think therefore I am." Now we can say also: "I know I think therefore I am estranged." Who is this "I" who knows, who is immersed, who is estranged? I am troubled by my relation to this world before me. What is that relation? In his notebooks Wittgenstein rang the desperate changes on this theme: The self is outside the world. The self and the world are one. The self does not exist. Of course I do not find myself among the things of the world. Had no one noticed this before the Buddha? Before Hume? Then what is the self? If, as Wittgenstein wrote, solipsism leads to realism and realism leads to extinction, may I begin with ex- tinction and restore myself to solipsism? Or may I with Schopenhauer shrug my metaphysical shoulders and call not for refutation but for cure? There is cure, there is learning to live with the ailment, and then there is coming to love one's malaise. What are the possibilities? Again, what is it like to "be there"? Suppose I am outside the world. Then I am the god of folk religion, visiting my wrath and work upon the world. I am Indra, Odin, Zeus, Jahweh: the great god of the transcendent skies. What is this world to me? It is my garden, a diversion for my curious ways. Shall I pronounce this world good? The high god can do such things. But I am anxious. I do not know whether this world is good or not. Its presence troubles me; it is not mine. If I am really outside this world, why do I feel this distance as estrangement? What kind of god is troubled by his idle pastime? I am not this god: I am not outside the world. Or let me be the world. Then I am Spinoza's god: the presence of the world itself. I am the pantheistic unity lurking in eternal quiet act beneath the flux of time. I am the dreamless wakeful</page><page sequence="5">210 SOUNDINGS sleep of the untroubled one. There is no more to say, for no more can be said. But I must go on talking. If I am this world why am I estranged from it? Self from self? Absurd. I am not Spino- za's god: my life and the world are not united. Most desperately, if there is no self the fuss is merely my mistake. Whose? Shall I embrace some caricature of enlighten- ment and vanish? When the illusion is extinguished whose is the enlightenment? Shall I banish myself from being and leave de- spair behind like a footprint? Am I to trade my quarreling for the silence of paradox? Wittgenstein said that there were no more questions left, and that this itself was the answer. But unless the question retains a ghostly presence like the agnostic's faith, the silence of paradox is mere oblivion. Supposing I do not exist, deity still haunts me: I am the god of the atheist, the last seal on the wrappings of the void. Dominion, serenity, oblivion: these three present a choice among modes of spurious divinity. But no one has written: "I think I could turn and live with gods . . . ." Yet these three - custodial godhead, the All, and vacancy - seem to exhaust our possibilities. A skeptical friend of mine has come to admit that if Jesus and the Buddha agree about something, maybe we ought to take it seriously. Perhaps this is agreement: when the Buddha was asked whether the self survives death he declined to answer. Why? It is simple to see why he did not say "Yes." But why not "No"? It is as if one were asked whether the hairs of the tortoise are fine or coarse. Since the tortoise has no hairs, they are neither fine nor coarse. And as there is no absolutely existing self, there is neither survival nor extinction. Yet, who asked the question? The troubles begin when I think of my self as existing inde- pendently. But nothing exists independently, so certainly no self does. So is there no self at alii There is this process: the world. And in it, myself and all the rest, like knots in a great reticulum. Can the knot exist without the network? The answer is not merely "No." One who could ask such a question does not under- stand knots and networks. The knot does not find itself among the strands of the network for the same reason that the eye does not find itself in its visual field. It is that entanglement of entering and supporting strands, that web of connections. Understand- ing the self in the world becomes a matter of logic: I am a part of the world, invisible- but only to myself. So when I ask why I am the only person who is hollow on the inside, I am simply being</page><page sequence="6">GODS, FROGS, AND SOJOURNS 21 1 fooled by the trick of perspective: the necessity of being there, somewhere in the world, and neither nowhere nor everywhere. My reconciliation with the world comes with the swift sliding closure of the German term for a logical consequence: Schlussl A matter of logic. Gnosticism beckons us toward some recon- dite piece of information. But this is not information, it is the framework of possibility, the logical structure of things. It is the logos of John's gospel. If the logical structure of the world spoke, it would say: "One who insists on the independence of the self will find no self, but one who sees the interdependence of all parts of the process will be at peace." The author of John, perhaps some Neoplatonic Alexandrine, chose to wrap this mes- sage in the language of martyrdom drawn from the earlier tradition. But it is not about the spectacular martyrdom of the coliseum. It is about the quiet martyrdom of pride: the death of my belief in my own independence. I cannot take my place on the great mandala, the body of Christ, the Dharmakaya. I cannot take it, but I can discover that I am that place. I am this little knot in the great reticulum. Jesus and the Buddha agree: my troubles begin when I ignore this fact of logic: I am nothing more than this. May I also say: "Nothing less"? Now it is clear that all of my previous options stood on the assumption that my existence was independent. I was to be outside the world, and independent of it; or I was to be the world, and have the independence of the process as a whole; or I was - as if in spite - to be independently nonexistent. The truth is: interdependent existence. Is this what the theologians have meant by contingency? But everything is contingent, even the forms of the process. In a world of contingency and interde- pendence, what is it like to "be there"? I return to the creek with these problems, finding their clearest focus afloat there, canoeing. Anxious of transcendence, embarrassed at immanence, and striving for transparency, I float silently down the creek, paddle held still in my hands. Beside me mirrored on the smooth water is a low bluff in all its detail - gray lichen and green mosses, the scalloped leaves of a flowering plant like a wild geranium clinging in a cranny, and the peeling, twisted cedars growing from the cleft rock. All this is depicted so perfectly I do not even raise my eyes to see the bluff itself. It is here, well enough, on the still water. And then I see the ripples from the bow of my canoe. Streaming back at a steep</page><page sequence="7">212 SOUNDINGS angle they worry the water. Reflections waver and are swamped, vanishing in the confusion: again I sense my disruptive pres- ence. I, myself, am a disrupting ripple across the smooth texture of the world. Then, as I drift into the distortions of reflection once again, the silence becomes a soft wet slap against water. Basho's frog- sound! From the foot of the bluff the frog's ripples spread, arc after concentric arc across the pool, now no longer smooth. He too disrupts, distorts, interferes. His presence disturbs the smooth texture of the world. No, his disruption is part of that texture. The frog's ripples belong: like the frog himself. The frog belongs. He is not troubled by this world before him: it is not his; he is not it; he is not absent. He is there, in it. He is at home. But so am I in it, equally with him. My presence, my ripples, even my voice bounced from the rough wall of the bluff, belong here, not less than lichen, trees, and moss. Maybe he is Basho's frog again, reminding me of my presence. I am here, but is it all right? Am I cured by the frog-sound? Cured of what? To be cured of estrangement is to be cured of thought. Well then, I must learn to live with the ailment. I cannot immerse myself like the frog, but neither can I transcend the world like a god. I am wholly here, but reflectively here. I am carried afloat, by the current, and I must watch my ripples as they spread for better or worse. As long as I conceive my trip through the natural world as a quest- the attempt to encounter the unencountered - I pose as a god, and fail. If I pose as the frog I fail again. If I pretend there is no encounter, still / know my own imposture. My passage must have a logic that expresses my immanence, but also my reflection; my presence, but also my distance; my participation, but also the observation I cannot forgo. I must be at the same time the traveler and a part of the terrain, a spectator and a part of the scene. My passage is not a quest. It is, after all, not merely a passing-through. My passage is at once a trip and a style of lodging: it combines residence and transience. I am a sojourner in my own home.</page></plain_text>
