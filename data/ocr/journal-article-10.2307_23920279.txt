<plain_text><page sequence="1">Religion Sans Ultímate: A Re Examination of Church-State Law RUDRA TAMM I. Why Reconsider Church-State Law Th e opening words of the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitu tion, preceding even the great freedoms of speech, press, and assem bly, grant freedom of religion: "Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; . . The text itself, as well as the legislative history of its drafting and ratification, reveals an attempt at neutrality: Congress shall not estab lish, yet not prohibit religion. There is an inevitable and even "intolerable tension"1 between the Establishment and Free Exercise Clauses of the First Amendment, which predictably foments disagreements, but most Americans would likely agree that freedom of religion as embodied in the religion clauses has served the country well. Largely ignored for 150 years, church-state law has recendy be come a favorite topic of legal scholars, and would appear to have littie relevance beyond academia—were it not for our social pathologies. In a time of unprecedented peace and prosperity, troublesome issues such as race relations, crime, the excessive use of legal and illegal drugs, and the existence of a self-perpetuating underclass remain. Underlying these is the disquieting alienation that S0ren Kierkegaard, Franz Kafka, and others describe as permeating industrial societies. If at least a sizable minority of citizens believes that spiritual as pects, however defined, are a necessary ingredient in solving these so cietal problems, then church-state issues rise to the forefront and any mistakes in prior analysis must be addressed.

Board of Education2 make the traditional distinction between church and state, or synonymously, between the religious and the secular. The Court has been careful not to pronounce an ironclad definition of "reli gion," but has worked on a case by case method. The trend has been to broaden the concept, especially in Free Exercise Clause cases, to in clude more than traditional theistic faiths.3 In conscientious objective cases such as U.S. v. Seeger4 and Welsh v. United States,5 which are not constitutional cases but involve the interpretation of a statute,6 the Court has reached its broadest definitions of "religion." There seems to be little dispute that in free exercise cases, and its offshoots, such as the conscientious objector cases, the word "religion" should be given a broad definition so as to protect the beliefs of minor ities and those of unorthodox faiths to the widest extent possible. The problem is that an overly broad definition of religion would cause the Establishment Clause to prohibit government from undertaking worthy secular activities because religions also encourage such activities, and undertaking those activities thus may tend to favor, or "establish," reli gion. A dual definition of religion, broad under the Free Exercise Clause and narrow under the Establishment Clause, has been ad vanced by perhaps the majority of commentators7 but rejected by the Court, which has adopted a unitary definition since Justice Rutledge wrote in Everson: "'Religion' appears only once in the Amendment. But the word governs two prohibitions and governs them alike. It does not have two meanings, one narrow to forbid 'an establishment' and another, much broader, for securing 'the free exercise thereof.'"8 The Supreme Court presently considers religion as that which per tains to "ultimate concerns."9 The phrase "ultimate concerns" was bor rowed from theologian Paul Tillich in his Dynamics of Faith and The 2.

The Supreme Court's unfortunate equation of religion with ulti mate concerns resulted from a lack of clarity in Tillich's terminology, compounded with an incomplete reading of his works by the Court. This essay is not primarily on theology, but the Court's definition of religion has such important consequences that Tillich's views on reli gion must be clarified. TILLICH'S "ULTIMATE CONCERNS" The Court cannot be faulted for making use of Tillich's writings. Paul Tillich (1886-1965) is probably the best known Protestant theolo gian of the twentieth century. As a German Army chaplain in World War I, Tillich lived in the trenches in Verdón, saw Hell first hand and was awarded the Iron Cross. Fully conversant in the classics of religion and philosophy, he was a respected theology professor who spoke out against the Nazi regime and was forced to emigrate to American in 1933. His many books have had a profound influence on contemporary religious thought. Tillich uses "religion" to describe two different notions. One notion is that of a set of beliefs, rites, and social structure, commonly associ ated with churches. The other is an ultimate or unconditional reality which is always Beyond, which is not limited to church type activities, but rather underlies all of man's existence and culture. Unfortunately, Tillich uses "religious" for both of these notions, although the context of the word usually tells the reader what notion is intended. For example, writing of communism and fascism, the fanatical movements of the twentieth century, Tillich makes "reference to the religious element which was and is hidden in all such antireligious and anti-Christian movements. In all of them there is an ultimate, uncondi tional, and all-determining concern, something absolutely serious and therefore holy, even if expressed in secular terms. . . . [Rjeligion is more than a system of being; religion is ultimate concern; it is the state of being grasped by something unconditional, holy, absolute. . . . The revolutionary movements, for instance, represent an ultimate concern, a religious principle, hidden but effective within them."11 10.

Tillich continues: The presupposition of theology is that there is a special encounter with reality . . . which is ordinarily called "religious." And it is the presupposition of this paper that "having a religious encounter with reality" means "being ultimately concerned about reality."''2 To his credit, Tillich admits that these thoughts are only "presupposi tions," for they are misleading. Tillich's notion of the ubiquitous ulti mate concern, while useful, is not what is ordinarily called "religious." Tillich's notion of God is also infinitely all encompassing—God is that which underlies and makes possible everything that exists. The being of God is being-itself. The being of God cannot be understood as the existence of a being alongside others or above others. If God is a being, he is subject to the categories of finitude, especially to space and substance. Even if he is called the "highest being" in the sense of the "most perfect" and the "most powerful" being, this situation is not changed. ... A theology which does not dare to identify God and the power of being as the first step toward a doctrine of God relapses into monarchic monotheism, for if God is not being-itself, he is subordinate to it, just as Zeus is subordinate to fate in Greek religion.... But God is his own fate. . .. This can be said of him only if he is the power of being, if he is being-itself.13 Courage is the self-affirmation of being in spite of the fact of nonbeing. . . . [EJvery courage to be has an open or hidden religious root. For religion is the state of being grasped by the power of being itself. In some cases the religious root is carefully covered, in others it is passionately denied . . . But it is never completely absent. For everything that is participates in being itself.14 If courage, and indeed "everything that is," is an aspect of religion, then the term "religion" has lost its ordinary definition. In the next excerpt, Tillich speaks of "institutionalized religion" which is probably the common notion of religion, but he also expands on the "larger aspect" of religion, the unconditional (or ultimate). He repeats that his aspect of "religion" underlies all of humanity's achieve ments, including the writings of individuals considered by themselves and others to be non-religious. Religion is the highest expression of the greatness and dignity of life. . . . Yet religion is also the most radical refutation of the greatness and dignity of fife; in it the great becomes most profanized, the holy most desecrated. . . . Instead of transcending the finite in the direction of the infinite, institutionalized religion actually becomes a finite reality itself—a set of prescribed activities to be per 12.

The content of the personal religious life is always taken from the religious life of a social group. Even the silent language of prayer is formed by tradition."15 In the above paragraph, Tillich's description of religion is consónate with ordinary use of the term. But he continues: [T}he larger concept of religion [i]s experience of the unconditional, both in the moral imperative and in the depth of culture. The ambiguity of radical secularism is that it cannot escape the element of self-transcendence which appears in these two experiences. ... If the radically secular philosopher is asked by a tyrannical power—dictatorial or conformist—to give up his secularism, he resists such a de mand, experiencing the unconditional imperative of honesty up to total self-sacri fice. In the same way, if the radically secular writer whose novel has been written with the totality of his being sees that it is being used as a mere piece of entertain ment, he feels this as an abuse and as profanization. . . . [R]eligion [i]s a quality that is found is all functions of the spirit—the quality of ultimate concern.16 The creations of any serious, honest, artist are of ultimate concern to him. So is the research of a totally involved scientist. In a perver sity, the next "fix" may be an ultimate concern to a drug addict. Tillich has discovered useful similarities, but these are not within the ordinary usage of "religion." The following, final selection from Tillich is included because he sets forth a source of civil law similar to that proposed in this article: Autonomy asserts that man as the bearer of universal reason is the source and measure of culture and religion—he is his own law. Heteronomy asserts that man, being unable to act according to universal reason, must be subjected to law, strange and superior to him. Theonomy asserts that the superior law is, at the same time, the innermost law of man himself, rooted in the divine ground, which is man's own ground. . . . [A]n autonomous culture [is] the attempt to create the forms of personal and social life without any reference to something ultimate and unconditional, following only the demands of theoretical and practical rationality. A heteronomous culture, on the other hand, subjects the forms and laws of think ing and acting to authoritative criteria of an ecclesiastical religion or a political quasi-religion, even at the price of destroying the structures of rationality. A the onomous culture expresses in its creations an ultimate concern and a transcending meaning not as something strange but as its own spiritual ground.17 In the above excerpt, Tillich sets forth the three possible sources of civil law: (1) a rational assessment of the physical and mental needs of citizens—autonomy; (2) the dictates of some religious creed or re vealed writing—heteronomy; and (3) the wisdom found in the inmost and most profound being of the citizens—theonomy. 15.

Con temporary Americans, viewing the heteronomy of, for example, funda mentalist Muslim nations, heartily agree. America, with its tradition of separation of church and state, would seem to prefer autonomy as the source of its civil law. Yet for Tillich the autonomy ideal that secular Americans advocate, is an illusion: "In the depth of every autonomous culture an ultimate concern, something unconditional and holy, is implied."18 For example, a legislator votes for a bill because he feels it would be good for the country. But from where do his notions of "good for the country" arise? Faced with diverse demands on limited resources, on what does government base its priorities? A totally autonomous ra tionale might be to maximize the material good of the nation. But im mediately questions arise: Why should having maximal material goods be the society goal? On what basis does society allocate those goods to citizens of different capacities and willingness to contribute? Does having abundant material goods insure happiness? What is happiness? A thoughtful legislator cannot escape theonomy, and with it, the realization that he is passing laws based on his perception of society's ultimate concerns. If ultimate concerns are religion, and the First Amendment specifies Congress shall make no law respecting the estab lishment of religion, then every law Congress passes is unconstitutional, since every vote is based on ultimate concerns as the various legislators perceive them. This is the contradiction which Tillich implies when he states that a purely autonomous source of law is dishonest and a catastrophic illu sion. It is also the thesis of this essay. It is ironic that the Supreme Court's equation of Tillich's "ultimate concerns" with "religion" in the First Amendment leads to contradic tions which Tillich himself perceived. It is submitted that this article's analysis provides a consistent framework by which government can ful fill its task of advancing the ultimate nature of man without running afoul of the Establishment Clause and favoring or disparaging certain sects or beliefs. 18. Ibid. Agreeing with his contemporary theologian Karl Barth, Tillich writes, "Culture can never be indifferent toward the ultimate. If it ceases to be theonomous, it first becomes empty, then it falls, at least for a time, under demonic control. The demand for a merely matter-of-fact culture is dishonesty or illusion, and a catastrophic illusion at that." Ibid.</page><page sequence="7">A RE-EXAMINATION OF CHURCH-STATE LAW 259 III. Typical Church-State Conflicts Church-state conflicts arise in many areas. The most common in volves schools—-prayer or other religious activities in public schools, and public funding of parochial schools. Another area is governmental displays of religious symbolism, or its declaration of religious holidays. A third area is the degree of deference given to unconventional reli gious traditions of employees, students, and prisoners. Most church-state disputes follow a pattern: One party believes that enlarging church activities and presence benefits society at large, even those who do not share the religious faith; the other party fears that giving church doctrines a governmental imprimatur inevitable leads to favoritism which will be detrimental to those of beliefs not so favored, and will ultimately be detrimental to society at large. As is true of many disputes, from its own perspective each side is right. Church-state disputes frequently arise because each party is em phasizing different notions which the judicial system has erroneously conjoined in this concept of "religion." Those favoring more "religion"/ government involvement usually emphasize ultimate type notions, which, as this essay contends, are a broad umbrella under which all of mankind's finer endeavors, including religion, are contained. Those opposing "religion'Vgovernment involvement usually emphasize ulti mate type notions, which, as this essay contends, are a broad umbrella under which all of mankind's finer endeavors, including religion, are contained. Those opposing "religion'Vgovernment involvement usually emphasize the doctrinaire, ritualistic, or outer aspects of religion, which clearly must remain outside the domain of government. IV. Religion and the Ultimate THE NATURE OF RELIGION A religion consists of a set of beliefs, teachings, morals, and rules of behavior, as well as a group of adherents to those beliefs and the group's organization and physical assets. Taken in their broadest con text, religious beliefs refer to realities and powers beyond perception by the ordinary five senses, and which can be validated by faith alone. One of the subjects of religious beliefs is God, the Supreme Being, the Ultimate Reality. Webster's New Collegiate Dictionary (1975) defines "religious" as "relating to ... an acknowledged ultimate reality or deity." Religions may also include belief systems that deny the existence of God as a personal, anthropomorphic deity.19 For example, secular hu 19. Torcaso v. Watkins at 495, n. 11.</page><page sequence="8">260 JOURNAL OF CHURCH AND STATE manism is atheistic or at most agnostic as to "god," but has its own notions of the nature of ultimate reality, and is a religion. Some feel religion is akin to superstition and magic, relics of man's prescientific past. Others feel religion is the exploration, however flawed, of man's greater and inevitable potentialities, and thus is the precursor of man's future. RELIGION AND ULTIMATE DISTINGUISHED Religion includes talking about the ultimate, worshipping the ulti mate, and teaching how to establish a relationship with the ultimate. But religion does not include the ultimate, nor does it include the inner growth of individuals towards the ultimate. Many religious teachers claim that their religion encompasses the ultimate, some even claim their particular religion is the only one that encompasses the ultimate. But a broad review of human achievements reveals that this simply is not true. The ultimate reality, everything that is on all levels of existence or potentiality, cannot be shoehorned into religion. Granted, religion is one, maybe even the preeminent, human activity that relates to the ultimate, hut it is not the only one. All of man's higher activities relate to the ultimate. Some religious teachings concern the spiritual evolution of individ uals, groups, or all mankind, and mention the importance of striving for a higher consciousness. But spiritual evolution, or aspiration for a higher consciousness does not take place within religion. The con sciousness of mankind as a species has evolved in the past ten thousand years—indeed, in the past one hundred years—and religion is one of many elements of mankind that has also evolved. But to ascribe the entire upward thrust of humanity to religion, or to one particular reli gion, is narrow-minded. Similarly, certain individuals have attained a higher consciousness than others. Granted, some of these individuals have attributed their extraordinary spiritual evolution to their formal religious orders. But others have attained their realizations completely separate from any religious concepts or connections. This essay makes subtle, but crucial distinctions: It is not separating religious practice from religious teaching, calling practice not religious while teaching is religious. Practices such as praying, chanting, and conducting ceremonies are all religious, as they involve some physical, emotional, or mental activity. However, the descent of a higher con sciousness into certain individuals, or the onset of an ecstasy trance, or the transformation of character, all of which may be the results of reli gious practices, are not themselves religious events, but experiences of a reality beyond usual comprehension.</page><page sequence="9">A RE-EXAMINATION OF CHURCH-STATE LAW 261 The ultimate is both the essence and the goal of consciousness. In sofar as the goal is ever transcending itself, the ultimate will always be there. Man is a being not yet fully understood, and his future potential is even less perceived. True, man has a devotional aspect. Many peo ple like certain beliefs that are not to be questioned, and like to associ ate with others who share such beliefs (i.e., join a religion). But to identify mankind's age-old search for Truth exclusively with religion, and to attribute the source of ecstasy consciousness solely to religion, is to shortchange the other present and future aspects of man. WHAT IS RELIGION WITHOUT THE ULTIMATE? By stripping the ultimate from religion, have we taken away too much? Without the ultimate, does religion have anything left? True, we have removed the essence of religion, for the ultimate is the very essence of every higher endeavor of mankind. But religion still has plenty left. For a believer steeped in institutional religion, the doc trines and teachings of his chosen path provide comfort, power, and direction. The beliefs, the rituals, the hierarchy, even the physical buildings offer a stable base on which to build almost anything: moral ity, a marriage, a successful business. Religion can provide a sense of history, or continuity, or community. At its best, a religion can be a springboard to the ultimate. But as we ascribe the ultimate exclusively to religion, the Establishment Clause will prevent government from furthering the very purposes for which government was created by the Constitution. Religion is one avenue utilized by man's spiritual striving, but is certainly not the sole avenue. The essence of religion is developing and controlling beliefs, thought patterns, morals, and behavior. Because these beliefs and thoughts, at their finest, center on God and/or tran scendent realities, religion is sometimes mistakenly equated with ulti mate type concerns. But every activity of mankind, at its finest, is an avenue for spiritual striving, the search for God, the ultimate reality. The highest expres sions of art, music, and literature struggle to grasp and convey beauty, delight, and the deepest essence of humanity—all aspects of ultimate reality. Science, mathematics, and philosophy search for reality and truth in its most pristine form. Families and groups worldwide teach and develop love, kindness, and a feeling of oneness. Each one of these qualities, strivings, and truths, disparate as they seem, lead to, and are part of, the same ultimate goal.20 20. Arnold Schônberg, in Style and Ideas (Berkeley, Calif.: University of California, 1950), eloquently expressed the same notion: "There is only one content, which all great men wish</page><page sequence="10">262 JOURNAL OF CHURCH AND STATE V. Law and the Nature of Man One human endeavor which is seldom thought of as leading to the ultimate, but which can substantially facilitate other paths to that goal, is law, both constitutional and legislative. Law is based on the assumption that man is a conscious being, not merely an elaborate carbon-based machine. Man has will. Law recog nizes this. Indeed, criminal law is based on intent. Tort, contract, and family law all presuppose that man can choose freely, that he knows right from wrong. Law does not treat people as deterministic auto matons. Law presumes citizens to be individuals with consciousness. Not only that, law encourages its subjects to strive for good conscious ness so they will act in ways society deems beneficial. The concept of freedom, so essential in the American political ex perience, presupposes an individual, non-physical, non-deterministic will, able to make decisions and pursue goals, insulated from outside coercion. There is an irony here: the existence of laws, which are meant to regulate behavior, would be meaningless without the exist ence of a conscious free will which, it is hoped, chooses the right be havior. Yet any attempt by government to define this non-physical free will aspect inevitably leads to ossification with unhappy consequences. VI. The Constitution and the Ultimate The framers of the Constitution, most of whom were practicing Christians, shared the common view that man encompasses both body and soul. The purpose of the Constitution was and is to enhance the lives of citizens, in all aspects. The Preamble speaks eloquently of its aims: "to form a more perfect Union, establish Justice, insure domestic tranquillity, provide for the common defense, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Pos terity. . . ." The intention expressed is to enable all the concerns of its citizens to be advanced. The more important the concerns, the more important it is for the Constitution to advance them. However, the Constitution recognizes that the way to advance ultimate concerns is not to impose them, but rather to give each citizen the opportunity to learn and grow without being forced to believe in one doctrine or pre to express: The longing of mankind for its future form, for an immortal soul, for dissolution into the universe—the longing of the soul for its God. This alone, though reached by many different roads and detours and expressed by many different means, is the content of the works of the great; and with all their will they yearn for it so long and desire it so intensely until it is accomplished."</page><page sequence="11">A RE-EXAMINATION OF CHURCH-STATE LAW 263 vented from believing in another. That is precisely what the opening words of the First Amendment provides.21 A contradiction arises if the Supreme Court proclaims that legisla tion, the only purpose of which is to advance ultimate values, is invalid, when the basis of the Court's decision is to protect ultimate values, and is founded on a Constitution steeped in such values. The thesis of this article is that the Establishment and Free Exer cise Clauses of the First Amendment refer to religion as a group of members and their beliefs, as outlined above. It is to religion, thus understood, that government must remain neutral. The dangers of uniting a government with one church or group of churches was well known to the framers. They were only too aware of the long history of unhappy experiences with official churches that plagued citizens throughout Europe. They know that government intervention in how to realize, express, and manifest the ultimate, regardless of how well intentioned, is always counterproductive. Striving for the ultimate, in whatever form it is sought, and ex panding one's consciousness, however it may evolve, are the essence and natural culmination of life. Government's purpose is to create the foundation upon which the true fulfillment of the citizenry may de velop. However, discussing, describing, or defining the ultimate, and teaching how to expand consciousness—these usually comprise reli gion—should remain beyond the domain of government. VII. Seeds of This Thesis in Prior Writings Ideas seldom appear like Athena, emerging in full armor from the forehead of Zeus. Rather, ideas in hazy seed form affect actions and decisions early on, and only later are identified for what they are. The following are several examples of thought which, if carried to fruition, lead to the religion sans ultimate thesis-expressed herein. WRITINGS OF JEFFERSON Thomas Jefferson, who of course was not a framer, was deeply in volved in church-state issues and was widely respected in his time and ours. His 1802 letter to the Danbury Baptist Association about "build ing a wall of separation between Church and State" is often quoted by 21. See Engle v. Vitale, 370 U.S. 421 (1962) at 430 where it is discussed that the core value of both religion clauses is protection of freedom of religion and belief: "The First Amendment was adopted to curtail the power of Congress to interfere with the individual's freedom to believe, to worship, and to express himself in accordance with the dictates of his own conscience . . . the Court has identified the individual's freedom of conscience as the central liberty that unites the various clauses in the First Amendment." Wallace v. Jaffree, 472 U.S. 38 (1985) at 49-50.</page><page sequence="12">264 JOURNAL OF CHURCH AND STATE those who advocate that church (including, for them, ultimate type concerns) should be as separate as possible from state. In fact, Jeffer son felt that ultimate concerns are separate from religion, and are veiy much the concern of government. Jefferson was a staunch advocate of stripping the ultimate from reli gion. As he wrote to John Adams on 13 October 1813: "In extracting the pure principles which he (Jesus) taught, we should have to strip off the artificial vestments in which they have been muffled by priests, who have travestied them in various forms." In his 22 March 1812 letter to Van der Kemp, Jefferson wrote un equivocally: "The only orthodox object of the institution of government is to secure the greatest degree of happiness possible to the general mass of those associated with it." How can government advance that general happiness? By advancing the ultimate, by legislation if necessary: Good acts give us pleasure, but how happens it that they give us pleasure? Be cause nature hath implanted in our breasts a love of others, a sense of duty to them a moral instinct, in short, which prompts us irresistibly to feel and to succor their distresses. ... I sincerely, then, believe, with you in the general existence of a moral instinct. I think it the brightest gem with which the human character is studded . . . when it is wanting, we endeavor to supply the defect by education, by appeals to reason and calculation,. . . and the rewards and penalties established by the laws.... These are the correctives which are supplied by education and which exercise the functions of the moralist, the preacher and legislator; . . ,"22 These excerpts make it clear that Jefferson never equated the teachings of any doctrinaire religion with the Ultimate Truth. He had a tolerance of all religion, but was suspicious of their formal structure and teachings, and wanted no coercion of ultimate, to which he some times referred to as an innate moral code. He recognized that the hap piness of man depends upon higher endeavors and that the duty of government is to provide for man's improvement, including correcting the lack of moral instinct where necessary. EVOLUTION OF FREEDOM OF RELIGION It is doubtful whether anyone familiar with the history and writings of the framers23 believes that the framers of the Bill of Rights would have prohibited, for example, a public school from holding a minute of voluntary prayer. Yet the Supreme Court now holds that such an activ ity might violate the First Amendment if its purpose is to advance reli 22. Letter to Thomas Law, 13 June 1814. 23. A good source is Robert Cord's Separation of Church and State (Towson, Md.: Lam beth, 1982).</page><page sequence="13">A RE-EXAMINATION OF CHURCH-STATE LAW 265 gion.24 How has the Court come to disallow an activity that the framers would certainly have permitted? The argument began in Everson v. Board of Education25 and goes like this: In primitive cultures, society, state, and religion (meaning the particular religion of the culture) were synonymous. Gradually the no tions gathered their own identity, but even in eighteenth-century Eu rope, an official state church was the rule.26 Enlightened citizens of the later eighteenth century realized that it was to the benefit of both church and state to keep the two separate, and not to have an official established church. However, (as the argument goes) the ideas have been gradually evolving and improving, and not even the Founders, great visionaries that they were, grasped the full import of these ideas, as they were partially bound by the prejudices of their times. For most of the Foun ders, religious freedom probably meant the right to choose one of many Christian sects. Time has developed the ideas of freedom be yond those in command of the Founders. As stated in the Jaffree case, "At one time it was thought that this right [to choose one creed over another] merely proscribed the preference of one Christian sect over another, but would not require equal respect for the conscience of the infidel, the atheist, or the adherent of a non-Christian faith such as Islam or Judaism. But when the underlying principle has been ex amined in the crucible of litigation, the Court has unambiguously con cluded that the individual freedom of conscience protected by the First Amendment embraces the right to select any religious faith or none at all."27 An "original intent" jurist would disagree. As Justice Rehnquist wrote in Jaffree, "The true meaning of the Establishment Clause can only be seen in its history. As drafters of our Bill of Rights, the Fram ers inscribed the principles that control today. Any deviation from 24. Wallace v. Jaffree, 472 U.S. 38 (1985). 25. Everson v. Board of Education, 330 U.S. 1 (1947). 26. Everson pointed out the commonly acknowledged horrors resulting from an official church, such as the Spanish Inquisition. Contemporary examples include the Islamic Re public of Iran or the official atheism of the communist countries. However, is there a realis tic danger of an official church being established in the United States today? "The Court has acknowledged that the 'fears and political problems' that gave rise to the religion clauses in the eighteenth century are of far less concern today. We are unable to perceive the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Bishop of Rome, or other powerful religious leaders behind every public acknowledgment of the religious heritage long officially recognized by the three constitutional branches of government. Any notion that these symbols pose a real danger of establishment of a state church is far-fetched indeed." Everson at 8. Also see Lynch v. Donnelly, 465 U.S. (1984) at 686. 27. Jaffree at 52, 53 (Majority opinion of Justice Stevens).

Much abbreviated, the evolution has proceeded thus: First, "religion" had to become separate from state. Second, "religion" had to become separate from whatever the dominant religion was, and any Christian sect had to be protected and not favored. The framers went at least this far. Third, "religion" had to become separate from Christianity, and any religion, or system of beliefs, which includes athe ism, must be protected, but not favored. This is as far as the Supreme Court has come. But there is a fourth step, that "religion" must be come separate from the ultimate as the ultimate is an integral part of man, by the mere fact that man has consciousness, and this ultimate is independent of any religious activity in man. The search for the ulti mate may be the basis for religion, but it is also the basis for all of man's highest endeavors, including the Constitution. THE ACCOMMODATION THEORY OF CHURCH AND STATE In trying to secure religious liberty, and steer clear of the waste lands of strict neutrality or strict separation, the Court has developed and at various times expounded the idea of accommodation, "a practice undertaken specifically for the purpose of facilitating the free exercise of religion. . . ,"29 Accommodation is usually found in Free Exercise Clause cases,30 but it is also popular in establishment situations where history or custom permits a religious activity otherwise suspect.31 In Jaffree,32 the United States, in an amicus brief, urged that a moment of silence for prayer or meditation is an accommodation to the desire of some public school students to privately practice their religion. Justice O'Connor pointed out that "even where the Free Exercise Clause does 28. Wallace v. Jaffree at 113 (Justice Rehnquist, dissenting). 29. Michael W. McConnell, "Accommodation of Religion," Supreme Court Review 1 (1985) at 3. This article thoroughly explores the bases for and permissible extent of accom modations, and points out (p. 4, n. 8) that six justices have written opinions expressly endors ing accommodation, while each of the others has joined in one or more of these decisions. Yet, according to Professor McConnell, accommodation "remains a label, not a theory," 4. 30. Such as the exemption of Amish from compulsory education laws; see Wisconsin v. Yoder, 406 U.S. 205 (1972). 31. For example, see the landmark tax exemption case of Walz v. Tax Commissioner, 397 U.S. 664 (1970) at 673, where the Court said, "The limits of permissible state accommoda tion to religion are by no means coextensive with the noninterference mandated by the Free Exercise Clause. To equate the two would be to deny a national heritage with roots in the Revolution itself." 32. Jaffree at 79.</page><page sequence="15">A RE-EXAMINATION OF CHURCH-STATE LAW 267 not compel the government to grant an exemption, the Court has sug gested that the government may voluntarily choose to exempt religious observers without violating the Establishment Clause. The challenge posed by the United States' argument is how to define the proper Es tablishment Clause limits on voluntary government efforts to facilitate the free exercise of religion. . . . The solution to the conflict between the Religion Clauses lies not in "neutrality," but rather in identifying workable limits to the government's license to promote the free exer cise of religion."33 No Supreme Court cases explain why there should be this soft spot, this yearning for an accommodation of religion, or why the correct con stitutional standard towards religion should be one of "benevolent neu trality."34 In fact, the doctrine of accommodation is a Seed form of the central thesis of this article, which is that the core concept in religion, inherent in man as a conscious being, is the same core concept behind the Constitution and higher values in all endeavors, and therefore must not only be tolerated, but actively promoted by government. "Accom modation" is a label of instances where a governmental agency or court feels an intuitive urge to promote an ultimate35 type endeavor, and sees the opportunity to do so without advancing or inhibiting religious doctrines. Professor McConnell36 gives a rationality for the policy of accom modation which may be summarized as follows: 1. Religious views, if true (and there is always a good chance they are true), postulate a higher authority than state government, and therefore the latter should defer to the former wherever possible. 2. A liberal state cannot be the source of the people's values, and the state (other than a ruthless despotism) depends on the citi zen's commitment to order and morality for civil order. 3. Churches are the primary source of public virtue outside gov ernment, and furnish a means in which citizens learn to tran scend their individual interests to develop civic responsibility. 4. Religious pluralism, at least in our modern society, acts as an automatic guardian against religious monopoly and tyranny, and 33. Ibid, at 82-83. 34. Jaffree at 90, Chief Justice Burger, dissenting. 35. Of course, the state agency or court would not use the term "ultimate type endeavor" as the activity supported. For example, Justice Burger said the wish was to "accommodate religious needs ... in a wholly neutral and noncoercive manner.. .Jaffree at 90. But why would government or courts want to support those needs, if not to advance ultimate type endeavors? 36. McConnell, "Accommodation of Religion."</page><page sequence="16">268 JOURNAL OF CHURCH AND STATE therefore the state can tolerate some accommodation without excessive worry about establishment. In short, church and state have entered into an "arrangement" whereby the church instills the citizenry with virtue and placidity, and in return the state accommodates church wherever it can do so noncoercively, neutrally, and evenhandedly. There are two difficulties with this argument. First, it is not certain that religion can "deliver the goods," or has the power to provide a virtuous and docile populace in contemporary times. Second, even if religion has that power, a deep enough probe would reveal that the source of that power lies in the ultimate underpinnings of religion, not in specific doctrines and practices. Therefore, the "pact," if there be one, should be with ultimate concerns, not with religion. If the religion sans ultimate definition is accepted, there would no longer be the need for accommodation exceptions. HISTORY BASED ESTABLISHMENT CASES There is a group of Establishment Clause cases which seems to cre ate consternation with commentators and even some members of the Court. These are the "history based" cases,37 which hold that certain religious activity, which would seem to be an "establishment," is ac ceptable primarily because the activity has been tolerated for so long it has become part of the fabric of our nation, and may continue. These cases appear to belie reason, and are rationalized by remembering that a page of history is sometimes worth a volume of logic. The Lemon test38 is applied less vigorously in these cases. In the Nebraska legisla ture prayer case39 the Lemon test was not used at all. With the sans ultimate definition of religion, these cases can be rationalized, and the decisions can even be predicted by using the Lemon test. The argument is as follows: 1. With ultimate concerns not being part of religion, an activity may have as a purpose the advancement of ultimate concerns, and this purpose would be secular. Therefore, in each case it can be shown the first Lemon prong is satisfied in that the perti nent activities advance man's grappling toward the ultimate and thus are acceptable. 37. Including Lynch v. Donnelly, 465 U.S. 682 (1984) (a Christmas nativity scene tradi tionally erected by a Rhode Island town was acceptable); Marsh v. Chambers, 463 U.S. 783 (1984)(Nebraska may continue to pay a chaplain to open each legislative session with a prayer); Walz v. Tax Commission, 397 U.S. 664 (I970)(states may continue to give tax ex emptions to churches). 38. Lemon v. Kurtzman, 403 U.S. 602 (1971) at 612-13. 39. Marsh v. Chambers, 463 U.S. 783 (1983).</page><page sequence="17">A RE-EXAMINATION OF CHURCH-STATE LAW 269 2. The second Lemon prong, the primary effect prong, is handled a posteriori. The subject activity has been going on for up to two hundred years. The primary effect of the activity has not been to advance or inhibit religion. We know this because religion has not been significantly affected by this activity for two hundred years. Therefore there is no reason to suppose the activity will advance or inhibit religion in the future any more than it has in the past, and the second prong is satisfied. 3. The activity may have a slight entanglement with religion, but because it has been going on so long, we have learned to live with it, and the entanglement is not excessive. Lemon is fulfilled. THE INSTITUTIONAL EFFECT A final example of the religion sans ultimate theory presently being applied in seed form may be termed the "institutional effect."40 Courts are more sympathetic to religion when it concerns the individual than when it concerns the institution of a church, but the reason for this has been debated. Yet the answer is clear. Ultimate concerns involve only individuals, never institutions. An institution may have as members in dividuals who are searching for ultimate truths, but the institution itself can never be other than a religion. When an issue involves individuals, the dividing line (which is at times a fine one) between religion and ultimate concerns may be con tested but the court has the power to find the activity is ultimate ori ented, and thus may be advanced. When institutions are involved, the activity is always religion, and the government must maintain strict neutrality. VIII. How Should the Separation of Religion and Ultimate Be Effected? This analysis should not be adopted by amending the Constitution, because this approach might lock in present notions of religion/ulti mate distinctions which future citizens would find too rigid. Also, there has been a well justified reluctance, based on "slippery slope" type concerns, to amend the Bill of Rights. So long as the Supreme Court holds that ultimate type concerns are "religion," this analysis cannot be adopted legislatively, as such legisla 40. See for example, Ira C. Lupu, "Keeping the Faith: Religion, Equality and Speech in the U.S. Constitution," Connecticut Law Review 18 (1986): 739. The example Professor Lupu cites is that of financial aid to religious schools, which is generally allowed. There are other examples.</page><page sequence="18">270 JOURNAL OF CHURCH AND STATE tion could be stricken as violating the First Amendment, as presently construed. This analysis should be adopted by the Supreme Court, presented with an appropriate case, ruling that religion is not the only home of ultimate concerns, and that government may promote ultimate inter ests and goals. What these ultimate goals are, and how they differ from church-type goals and activities will evolve and for now will be divided on a case by case basis. Once the Supreme Court alters its definition of "religion," Congress could enact statutory language prescribing where religion ends and ultimate concerns begin. But this should wait until a mature sense has evolved. Any premature statutory language will tend to be arbitrary, limiting, and unsatisfactory. IX. Problems Raised By the Decoupling of Religion and Ultimate Substantial, but not insurmountable problems will be raised by this thesis. Assume the Supreme Court decided that government has the constitutional power to attempt to advance spiritual, or ultimate type concerns, but not religion. What are ultimate concerns, and how does a legislator, administrator, or judge differentiate between those and religion? The problem is that as the official tries to define or delineate ultimate concerns, so those charged with enforcement knows what he is permitted to enhance, he inevitably expresses it in terms that tend to become dogmatic and acquire church-like characteristics. This issue is difficult, but not impossible. An analogy may be made to morality or decency. A definition or exposition of morality may have a basis in religion. Yet most of us have an immediate, intuitive sense of what is moral or decent in a given situation without referring, overtly anyway, to a church-type doctrine. There is a real, discernible differ ence between religious activities and ultimate concerns. Granted, a discriminating sensitivity is required to perceive the difference, but this will come with time and experience. X. Application of Separation of Religion and Ultimate to Typical Church-State Issues A decoupling of religion and ultimate may, but will not necessarily produce a different result in future church-state Supreme Court rul ings. It does enable a more realistic and therefore more satisfactory analysis and justification for decisions. The following examples ex amine how several typical church-state situations would be handled by this approach.</page><page sequence="19">A RE-EXAMINATION OF CHURCH-STATE LAW 271 DOES THE SANS ULTIMATE DEFINITION OF RELIGION REDUCE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE FREE EXERCISE CLAUSE? The sans ultimate definition of religion is broad "horizontally" and narrow "vertically." It is broad horizontally in that it considers a church anything that serves the same function as that of a traditional church, including a systematized atheism. It is narrow vertically in that it ex cludes ultimate type concerns from religion, arguing that those con cerns are common to all activities of man, including those legislative and judicial. The net result of this definition, in cases under the Estab lishment Clause, will be to find fewer activities not usually thought of as religious improper because ultimate type goals could be secular. The question arises whether this vertically narrow interpretation of religion will restrict the power of the Free Exercise Clause to further religious liberty. It will not. Anything involving a doctrine, belief, or outer activity is still religion, and thus protected under the Free Exer cise Clause. The horizontal broadness of this theory classifies as reli gion, and thus is entitled to free exercise protection, the widest possible beliefs and practices. All free exercise cases involve some governmen tal activity which conflicts with the individual's beliefs manifested in the outer world, such as working on the Sabbath,41 paying social secur ity or unemployment tax,42 having license plates,43 getting paid a mini mum wage,44 or running a racially segregated school.45 As one commentator said: "Behavior that is generally understood as religious alone is almost never subject to direct regulation ... it is hard to imag ine what might lead the state to outlaw practices with only a religious function."46 Furthermore, if some type of inhibition arose just against ultimate concerns, which would not be religion by this article's defini tion, and thus not protected by the Free Exercise Clause, the Free Speech and Equal Protection Clauses should suffice as protection.47 The conclusion, then, is that the vertical narrowness of this definition of religion will not lead to decreased protection of religion, or of ulti mate type concerns under the free exercise half of the religion clauses. 41.

Of course, for Professor Lupu, "religion" includes, presumably, ultimate concerns as well as the usually church type accouterments. It would be even more unlikely that a state would oudaw activities that only impact on ultimate concerns. 47. Indeed, some argue that the Free Exercise Clause can be assimilated into the Free Speech Clause. See William Marshall, "Solving the Free Exercise Dilemma: Free Exercise as Expression," Minnesota Law Review 67 (1983): 545.</page><page sequence="20">272 JOURNAL OF CHURCH AND STATE SCHOOL PRAYER AND/OR MEDITATION Should meditation and/or prayer be permitted in public schools? Wallace v. Jaffree48 is an especially useful case to examine current Supreme Court positions, because it included three gradations of typi cal school prayer statutes. In 1978, Alabama enacted §16-1-20 (hereafter the "moment of si lence statute") which provided that at the beginning of each day in public elementary schools, a "period of silence, not to exceed one min ute in duration, shall be observed for meditation. ..." In 1981, § 16-1-20.1 (hereafter the "meditation or prayer statute") was enacted to provide that "each day in all grades on all public school the teacher . . . may announce that a period of silence not to exceed one minute in duration shall be observed for meditation or voluntary prayer. ..." In 1982, the state, apparently growing bolder, enacted § 16-1-20.2 (hereafter the "state prayer statute") which provided that "any teacher ... in any public educational institution . . . recognizing that the Lord God is one, . . . may pray, may lead willing students in prayer, or may lead willing students in the following prayer to God:" and composed a non-denominational prayer.49 The case was decided as follows: All the justices said that a statute authorizing voluntary audible prayer, which includes a sample non-de nominational prayer, violates the Establishment Clause. No justices said that a moment of silence statute is unconstitutional per se, and even though that was not a key issue, every opinion mentioned that a properly drafted moment of silence statute would not violate the Es tablishment Clause. Six of the nine justices ruled that the moment of silence for meditation or voluntary prayer did violate the Establishment Clause, at least under the particular factual pattern in Jaffree.50 48. Wallace v. Jaffree, 472 U.S. 38 (1985). 49. "Almighty God, You alone are our God. We acknowledge You as the Creator and Supreme Judge of the world. May Your justice, Your truth and Your peace abound this day in the hearts of our countrymen, in the counsels of our government, in the sanctity of our homes and in the classrooms of our schools in the name of our Lord. Amen." 50. This case is almost a primer for how to prepare a losing legislative record for a new law in a sensitive area. The sponsor of § 16-1-20.1 stated at trial that his only purpose for the legislation was to return prayer to public schools. Also, the fact that 16-1-20.1 was passed after 16-1-20, and was nearly identical to the former statute, except that it added the word "prayer," indicated that the later statute, if it had any purpose at all, was enacted solely to encourage prayer.</page><page sequence="21">A RE-EXAMINATION OF CHURCH-STATE LAW 273 PRAYER AND MEDITATION VIA RELIGION SANS ULTIMATE Both the majority's and Justice O'Connor's concurring opinions in Jaffree said that meditation is acceptable, although the majority noted51 that meditation could be a form of prayer. Both said that silent prayer, by those so inclined, is permissible, but the "crucial question is whether the State has conveyed or attempted to convey the message that chil dren should use the moment of silence for prayer."52 Thus, introduced in a nonreligious manner, meditation is constitutional, while prayer is an unconstitutional establishment of religion.53 A decision based on the church/ultimate decoupling leads to the same conclusion as Jaffree, but the reasoning is simpler and may pro ceed as follows: Prayer, because it involves words and concepts, and asks for something (even something ethereal), is always a church-type activity, and any prayer that takes place during school hours of with the compulsory presence of any students would be barred by the First Amendment. Meditation is not by itself a religious activity, although it could be if presented from a religious viewpoint or if religious symbols are used as techniques. It would be constitutionally permissible for a local school board to decide that students would benefit if schools taught con sciousness-expanding techniques or at least if students were aware that such exist and have been highly beneficial to those who practice such techniques. Society would also benefit if students were aware that an inner emptiness, which many try to fill with drugs or other untoward activities, may be spiritually related, and will be fulfilled only by spiri tual means. Meditation may be taught in many ways that do not involve reli gion. These include focusing on thought control and concentrating on 51. Jaffree at 59, n. 47. 52. Ibid, at 73 (Justice O'Connor, concurring). 53. A contemporary spiritual teacher describes prayer and meditation as follows: "Prayer is something absolutely intense and upward soaring, while meditation is something wide and vast that ultimately expands into the Infinite. . . . The very nature of prayer is to reach God by going up. . . . Meditation, like the wings of a bird, is always expanding into Peace, Light, and Delight. When we pray, often there is a subde desire for something. . . . Also, there is always a feeling of being ... a divine beggar. We feel that God is high above while we are down below; we see a yawning gulf between His existence and ours. . . . But in meditation we do not have to ask God for Peace or Light or anything, because we are swimming in the sea of divine qualities. At this time God gives us more than we could ever imagine. . . . Heaven and earth do not belong to someone else. They are our own Reality. . . . Where prayer stops, meditation begins. In meditation we say nothing, we do nothing, we have nothing. Everything is being said and done in and through us, for the Supreme's sake."

With religion sans ultimate, there is no constitutional bar to teaching meditation in such a manner. As a practical matter, in a particular school, no regular school teacher may be experienced in meditation,54 and the school may wish to invite a member of some spiritual sect to aid in the instruction. De spite their denials to the contrary, spiritual sects such as TM tend to display all the usual indicia of religions, and must be considered as such. The danger is that the sect member may teach that meditation may only be done via the sect's religious symbolism. A meditation class/time period, even if compulsory, would be acceptable if universal, nonreligious aspects of meditation were taught by a regular instructor, with guest appearances by a variety of local sects given equal opportu nities to teach their techniques. To sum up: Prayer, in essence a religious activity, is barred. Medi tation, in essence an ultimate activity, is acceptable, even if taught, if necessary, by religious means, so long as religious pluralism protects against undue influence of any sect. THE LEMON TEST USING RELIGION SANS ULTIMATE THEORY Chief Justice Burger first set forth the three prongs of the famous Lemon test, which is still being followed (albeit selectively): "First, the statute must have a secular purpose; second, its principal or primary effect must be one that neither advances nor inhibits religion; finally, the statue must not foster 'an excessive government entanglement with religion.'"55 Note that in the first prong of the Lemon test, the purpose does not have to be exclusively secular (where "secular" means "nonreligious"): "For even though a statute that is motivated in part by a religious pur pose may satisfy the first criterion, the First Amendment requires that a statute must be invalidated if it is entirely motivated by a purpose to advance religion."56 To pass the first prong of the Lemon test, then, the statute must have at least one secular purpose. Under the religion sans ultimate theory, ultimate concerns not only may, but usually are, advanced by both religion and state. Therefore if a statute has the purpose of ad 54. Who is qualified to certify that an individual really enters higher states of conscious ness, i.e., can meditate in the true sense? A person may have read about and practiced meditation for years, but be unable to elevate this consciousness. Another person may be ignorant of the intellectual theory, but can enter at will into a trance state. 55. Lemon v. Kurtzman, 403 U.S. 602 (1971) at 612-13. 56. Jaffree at 56 (majority opinion). And, in Justice Powell's concurring opinion, "We have not interpreted the first prong of Lemon, however, as requiring that a statute have 'exclu sively secular' objectives."</page><page sequence="23">A RE-EXAMINATION OF CHURCH-STATE LAW 275 vancing ultimate concerns, and most statutes do, it would pass the first prong of the Lemon test. Realistically, a statute would have to be quite narrow not to have at least one legislative purpose other than advancing religion, because many an activity could be said to enhance man's search for ultimate truths, and thus be an acceptable purpose. It would be anticipated, then, that the first prong would knock out very few laws, yet it should remain as a statement that the intent of government is important, and conceivably it could be invoked in extreme cases. The second Lemon prong is whether the primary or principal effect of the act is to advance or inhibit religion. The third test is whether the act fosters excessive entanglement with religion. Instead of discussing these two prongs in the abstract, it will be useful to apply the Lemon test, via religion sans ultimate analysis, to a concrete fact pattern; a good case is Malnak v. Yogi.57 Several New Jersey high schools offered as an elective a course on meditation and "pure creative intelligence" taught by persons (not pub lic school employees) trained by an organization whose objective was the dissemination of Science of Creative Intelligence/Transcendental Meditation. The court opinions cited a number of rituals associated with the courses. Plaintiffs, private citizens objecting to the courses, argued that the courses amounted to an establishment of religion. De fendants argued theirs was not a religion, but a science.58 The District Court held that the organization was a religion, and the course was an improper religious establishment under the second (primary effect is to advance religion) and third (use of school facilities was excessive entan glement) prongs of the Lemon test.59 The opinions in this case spent far too much time on reaching the conclusion that SCI/TM is a religion, and too little time discussing the consequences of that finding. Of course, SCI/TM is a religion. The real issue was whether the school, by offering classes on meditation, violated the second prong of the Lemon test, as primarily advancing religion in general, and SCITM specifically. Let us review how the religion sans ultimate approach would de cide this case. The act of an individual meditating—and inner exper iences that may flow from that act, is not religion—it is ultimate oriented. Teaching meditation by linking the activity to some faith sys 57. Malnak v. Yogi, 592 F2d 197 (1979) which affirmed Malnak v. Yogi, 440 F.Supp 1284 (D.N.J. 1977). 58. Ibid, at 213, n. 55. This was an unusual factual pattern. In most free exercise cases, the individual argues that his belief is a religion, to get the greater protection afforded by that classification. In Establishment Clause cases, a question may arise whether some activ ity is religious, but whether the faith behind the activity, usually Christianity, is religious is never questioned. 59. The Circuit Court affirmed this decision in Malnak v. Yogi, 592 F.2d 197 at 199, 200.</page><page sequence="24">276 JOURNAL OF CHURCH AND STATE tems, especially if carried out by an organized group, may be religion. By the sans ultimate definition of religion, offering a course on medita tion passed the first Lemon test, because there was one secular pur pose, the enrichment of students' lives through meditation. The third Lemon test was also satisfied—the offering of a course on a neutral topic is not excessive entanglement, even if the teaching involves reli gious content, especially if taught by a non-employee. Did the medita tion offering violate the second Lemon test, as primarily advancing religion? It could well be that as a result of this class, a number of students began meditating on their own, and the experiences they gained there from enriched their lives and others. Perhaps no students had any fur ther connection with the SCI/TM organization. If those were the facts, surely the primary effect of the class was to enrich the lives of the students in a secular way, and not to advance SCI/TM, and the second Lemon test would be satisfied. Or, it could be that many of the students became devoted, dues paying members of SCI/TM and thus the primary effect was to advance religion. How is a court to know? Does it allow the course to continue for some time, then take empirical data? And how does one measure the inner (secular) growth of students versus the gain to some church to find out what the "primary effect" is? In this case religion sans ultimate theory would reason that a public school course taught by members of a particular sect, solely on the techniques and beliefs of that sect, carries too great a chance that the primaiy effect will be to aid the sect, and religion in general, as op posed to aiding the students in a permissible way, and the second Lemon test would void the activity. The ruling in Malnak was probably correct, but by the sans ultimate definition of religion, only because no religion other than SCI/TM were involved in teaching the meditations. Had a variety of individuals, affiliated with a group or not, taught the meditation sessions the likelihood of any one group receiving substan tial benefit would have been small. The primary effect would have been to enrich the students' inner lives. This would have been a per missible, ultimate, benefit, and the second Lemon prong would have been satisfied. Coincidentally, in his concurring opinion, Judge Adams echoed this article's religion sans ultimate thesis when he stated: "All programs or positions that entangle the government with issues and problems that might be classified as 'ultimate concerns' do not, because of that, be come 'religious' programs or positions. Only if the government favors a comprehensive belief system and advances its teachings does it estab</page><page sequence="25">A RE-EXAMINATION OF CHURCH-STATE LAW 277 lish a religion."60 He did not follow up on the idea that ultimate con cerns are not necessarily religious. In fact, he went the opposite direction when he said, "the government may have thought some 'good' would come out of this instruction. ... A conviction that reli gious education is 'good' for students does not make out a secular purpose."61 Judge Adams was wrong in not finding a secular purpose. A convic tion that any given type of education is good for students is a secular purpose. In this instance, the inner growth, the peace and better un derstanding of one's essence (the "good") that might arise from medita tion is a secular purpose, well worthy of being promoted by the government. The issue was not whether there was a valid secular pur pose, the issue was whether too much religion was intertwined in achieving that secular purpose (inner growth). CRECHE CASES To Christians, the creche represents the birth of light, compassion, hope, and salvation for the world. These are spiritual goals of the high est magnitude, richly welcomed by the Constitution, badly needed by society. The objection to a state-sponsored creche is that the qualities are presented through one specific divine/human being, and that they are identified with Christian churches. The difficulty is that religion is probably the most common vehicle by which to teach and convey ultimate realities. A local government which sets up a creche in the town square is likely not aiming to estab lish Christianity. It wants to promote joy, hope, and aspiration for ulti mate realities, but simply does not know any other way to accomplish that during the Christmas season. The answer again is religious pluralism. If opportunities were made available to other groups or individuals to present their symbols of these same qualities, the establishment objection would be muted. Atheists, who also hold to a type of "religion" by any objective defini tion, would be invited in turn to place their symbols, which could con sist of signs such as: "Best wishes to all from us who believe there is nothing but the here and now, but to us, that's a lot!" If all community religious groups who wished to participate could, the possibility that religion would be established, in that one group would gain more "official" imprimatur than any other group, would be diminished. Religion would not be established, but the higher con sciousness that these symbols conveyed would be enhanced. 60. Malnak t&gt;. Yogi at 212. 61.

That is, laws with a rational basis, which is less than a compelling interest, that apply broadly with no intention of limiting religion, are not unconstitutional because they happen to infringe on some religious practice. In response to this case, religious lobbies persuaded Congress (by a near unanimous vote) and President Clinton to enact the Religious Freedom Restoration Act63 in 1993. RFRA provides that "Government may substantially burden a person's exercise of religion only if it dem onstrates that application of the burden to the person (1) is in further ance of a compelling government interest; and (2) is the least restrictive means of furthering that compelling governmental interest."64 A synopsis of the realities behind RFRA reveals that one mistake begat another, then efforts to rectify both led to further complications. The Supreme Court is obligated to maintain a studied neutrality to wards religion, which for the Court includes ultimate type concerns. Since ultimate type concerns are what give meaning to life, and a pur pose to government, to have government be neutral to them seems unnatural. Because the issue is not well understood, objections to the Court's position have been muddled. The public has, and properly so, an inbred favoritism towards ulti mate type concerns. In passing RFRA, Congress found (rather indig nandy) that "laws neutral' toward religion may burden religious exercise."65 It is also true that laws neutral toward religion may benefit religion as surely as laws intended to establish religion. Why was that finding not indignantíy set forth? Because people basically favor reli gion and generally are more upset about laws restricting its free exer cise than about laws establishing it. Employment Division v. Smith66 was only the catalyst for a smoldering dissatisfaction, which culminated in the passage of RFRA. But RFRA was itself a mistake, and the wrong solution to the prob lem. The problem is that the Supreme Court is excessively neutral towards ultimate concerns. The Court is not excessively neutral to Employment Division of Oregon v. Smith, 494 U.S. 872 (1990).

Yet Congress's solution was to advance those aspects of religion—the outer manifestations and rules of behavior—which are not ultimate concerns. RFRA forces every level of government to give special con sideration to the ritualistic minutiae of every sect and belief, except where there is a compelling state interest. Special consideration to a few is always equaled by the inconvenience and/or cost borne by the many. There is nothing unusual in Congress passing laws to benefit a sec tion of the population to the detriment of others, but the discrimination of the various groups has to be for an appropriate reason. There are two issues here; first, whether it is wise public policy to have the gen eral populace bear the burdens of special favors openendedly granted to advance the rituals of every religious sect; second, whether Con gress has constitutional authority to so order (a) the federal bureau cracy, and (b) state and local government. According to the theory of this article, the answer is "no" to both questions. RFRA was an ill-conceived policy. The only justification for RFRA is that as religious rites are one avenue of focusing attention on the ultimate, aiding and abetting such rites might advance striving for the ultimate. But the benefits of RFRA tend to be sect-specific, which means the resources of the many are expended to benefit, and arguably establish the beliefs of the few. If society decides to expend resources to advance ultimate concerns, there are better avenues to follow. Regarding the constitutional issues, by obligating government on all levels to favor specific religious practices, and these are strictly outer rituals, with a minimum of ultimate content, Congress has embroiled itself in major constitutional questions that should never have arisen. The current predicament of the Supreme Court acting neutrally to wards ultimate concerns was not created by Congress and cannot be solved by Congress. As previously discussed, the only way to resolve the problem is for the Supreme Court to redefine religion to exclude ultimate concerns. The Supreme Court decided the constitutionality of RFRA in City of Boerne v. Flores.67 The City of Boerne, Texas refused permission to expand a church in a historic district. Using RFRA, Archbishop Flores sued the city in U.S. District Court, claiming the denial burdened the church without a compelling interest. The District Court found RFRA to be unconstitutional because it in effect overruled a Supreme Court interpretation of the Constitution, a violation of Marbury v. Madison.68 67. City of Boerne v. Flores, 117 S.Ct. 2157 (1997). 68. Marbury v.

Justice Kennedy, joined by Rehnquist, Stevens, Thomas, Ginsburg, and for the most part, Scalia, ruled that Congress did not have the authority under Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment to impose such sweeping burdens on state and local government. Even the dis senting Justices O'Connor and Souter agreed that Congress lacked the power under Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment to pass RFRA, but disagreed with the disposition of the case, and/or wanted a recon sideration of Employment Division of Oregon v. Smith,70 the 1990 case that precipitated RFRA. Could Congress constitutionally have imposed RFRA burdens on only federal programs and bureaucracies? Justice Stevens in the first paragraph of his brief concurrence said it could not: "RFRA is a 'law respecting an establishment of religion' that violates the First Amend ment to the Constitution. . . . This governmental preference for reli gion, as opposed to irreligion, is forbidden by the First Amendment." Speaking for the majority, Justice Kennedy was not required to, and thus did not answer that question. Yet Justice Kennedy repeatedly im plied that RFRA, which places an unconstitutionally onerous burden on the states, is misguided and excessive policy even for federal programs: Sweeping coverage ensures [RFRA's] intrusion at every level of government, dis placing laws and prohibiting official actions of almost every description and re gardless of subject matter. . . . Any law is subject to challenge at any time by any individual who alleges a substantial burden on his or her free exercise of religion. The stringent test RFRA demands of state laws reflects a lack of proportionality or congruence between the means adopted and the legitimate end to be achieved. If an objector can show a substantial burden on his free exercise, the State must demonstrate a compelling governmental interest and show that the law in the least restrictive means of furthering its interest. Claims that a law substantially burdens someone's exercise of religion will often be difficult to contest. . . . [The test] would open the prospect of constitutionally required religious exemption from civic obligations of almost every conceivable kind . . . [T]he legislation is broader than is appropriate if the goal is to prevent and remedy constitutional violations.71 RFRA is only partially pertinent to the religion sans ultimate the ory, because RFRA deals exclusively with religion in the context of ritu als, customs, and trappings, and the more interesting issue of government advancement of ultimate concerns is lacking.

An issue such as what day of the week to celebrate Sabbath (a typical RFRA case) may seem critically important to a devotee, but it is still only a symbol of a higher truth. Disturbing the symbol may even have a beneficial effect of fo cusing more attention on the underlying ultimate reality. The religion sans ultimate approach would find RFRA to be uncon stitutional, even if applied only to federal institutions, as an establish ment of religious rituals, with no ultimate advancing aspects to redeem it. XI. Application of Religion Sans Ultimate to Societal Problems creating good citizenship After the Supreme Court accepts that ultimate concerns are not inevitably finked with religion, and that advancing them is a legitimate purpose of government, and as scholars and policymakers are no longer locked into a rigid notion of what "religion" in the First Amendment means, an evolutionary process will begin to discover, and repeatedly rediscover, the fine between religion and ultimate concerns. No short, neat, one-size-fits-all test will be satisfactory. The decoupling of religion and ultimate will likely have little initial effect on the nation, except to add confusion. It will take a while for policymakers, even for those experienced in church-state issues, to un derstand, then become comfortable with the distinction between reli gion and ultimate, and even a deliberated consensus decision will change as society evolves. Gradually it will be seen that a barrier has been removed, and that the people, via government, have a greater freedom to tackle pressing social issues. Instilling good citizenship is essential for a society, and requires a bond between citizens based on more than fear (as in totalitarian coun tries), more than mutual hatred of another group, and more than the mutual desire to acquire wealth. Good citizenship begins with com mon interests, includes identification with a group, and ends with a feeling of oneness and its progeny, sympathy and compassion. The more a person realizes that others are extensions of the same con sciousness that is within himself, the more he will act civilly towards his fellow humans. True, it takes more than a theoretical belief in the essential oneness of humanity to create a caring citizen. But without that theoretical be lief there is no reason to treat others as anything but alien objects which are fair game for exploitation. Exploring, discovering, and then</page><page sequence="30">282 JOURNAL OF CHURCH AND STATE advocating the essential oneness of its members as conscious beings has always been an important but difficult task for any society. For the state, which has grown to be the primary institution in our society, to be unduly restricted in this task by a faulty interpretation of "religion" in the First Amendment, is an error of increasing magnitude. The decoupling of religion and ultimate will give more flexibility to government to encourage spiritual evolution. Why is that good? Be cause only self giving and inner growth give abiding fulfillment and satisfaction. Any other activity may satisfy for a while, but that satisfac tion fades, and when it does, it leaves a void that we rush to fill with other activities and sensations. Granted, it is unlikely that a spiritual epiphany will cure drug addiction on transform violent criminals— there are many intermediate stages. But without a worthy final goal beckoning, intermediate steps are less certain. It is difficult indeed for an individual to develop a higher conscious ness. If he succeeds, society benefits. This is a matter about which society, and government, as the primary institution of society, should not be neutral, but supportive. REPLACING WHAT IS LOST BY LACK OF WORK In technologically developed countries throughout the world, a large minority of adult citizens are now supported by the state. Social security, unemployment and disability compensation, welfare, pen sions, large tort judgments, governmental make-work jobs, perpetual educational grants—the programs vary in intent and legal status, but the effect of all of them is to pay citizens for not working. Society has become so productive that not everyone needs to work, yet everyone must be supported. Work has traditionally provided sustenance, but it has also given self-esteem, the respect of others and a stake in the well-being of the community. As ever fewer people are needed to produce all the neces sities and even luxury goods society needs, and an increasing number are supported not for what they contribute to society but merely be cause they exist, how to make non-workers' lives meaningful and fulfil ling is and will be a major problem. This subject is too broad to cover in depth here, but is mentioned because as citizens come to expect ever more from government, and as government, which gains more power along with more responsibility, is happy to oblige, government will find itself enmeshed in ultimate type issues about meaning and purpose in the empty lives it creates with its largesse. Ultimate type aspirations, and to a lesser degree work, creativity, religion, self-improvement, and serving others are the sources of abid</page><page sequence="31">A RE-EXAMINATION OF CHURCH-STATE LAW 283 ing joy and satisfaction. For those not gainfully employed, an impor tant avenue to fulfillment, work, is closed, and the other avenues must be emphasized to help deter citizens from untoward activities. Ban ning the ineffective routes to fulfillment (e.g., laws prohibiting drugs) is insufficient. Society must actively teach and encourage the effective routes, and this includes ultimate type aspirations, the optimum route. Unless the Supreme Court amends its conception of religion in the First Amendment, the state will be unable to encourage citizens to pur sue their own highest positive goals. XII. Conclusion This article began by noting the conviction of many citizens that spiritual elements are part of any cure to the nation's social ills. We have analyzed religion, and decided that the First Amendment applies to religion as an institution or set of beliefs. The Constitution does not bar government advancing ultimate type concerns. Indeed, the Consti tution was written largely to advance those aspects of human existence. The admonition against establishing religion was to prevent stifling of freedom of the spirit by identifying one or a group of sects as the primary source of access to matters of the spirit. The role of govern ment is to advance the fulfillment and satisfaction of its citizens in all respects, spiritual and otherwise. The test in establishment and free exercise cases is not whether the questioned activity results in further ing the evolution of consciousness (it better, or it is not good policy) but rather whether there is a preference for one system of beliefs, in cluding systems professing no beliefs, to the unfair exclusion of others. The state pretends to govern only man's physical body and act neu trally towards other aspects of man, leaving development of those to the individual, family, and church. This is a fiction. The pervasive ef fects of the state, caused, perhaps unfortunately, by our complex soci ety, already influences all aspects of man. The state cannot be neutral about the higher fulfillment72 of its citizens. The state must be neutral about the means to that fulfillment, but that neutrality is imposed to protect the higher fulfillment; the neutrality does not extend to the need for the fulfillment itself. What mankind is, and has the capacity to become, is something every person must determine for himself. The potential frontiers of human experience (which here are called "ultimate concerns"), although presendy vague, nonetheless permeate humanity and underlie much of what mankind wants and does. An individual will not under 72. Is there a theme more common in art, literature, religion, or philosophy than the lack of lasting fulfillment from the material world?</page><page sequence="32">284 JOURNAL OF CHURCH AND STATE stand the deeper realities in himself unless he actively searches for them, and he will never be truly fulfilled unless he is undertaking that search. The state cannot ignore purisuits of its citizens which, although only dimly understood, are crucial to fulfilled living. The Supreme Court must recognize and encourage ultimate con cerns, yet prevent their progeny—religion—from becoming estab lished by the state and identifying one group's conception of the ultimate as the only correct one. The change in definition of religion which this article advocates legitimizes government's encouragement of ultimate concerns, protects the values of the religion clauses, solves seeming anomalies, and provides a coherent framework for deciding future cases.</page></plain_text>
