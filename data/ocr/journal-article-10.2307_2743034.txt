<plain_text><page sequence="1">New Data on the Chronology and Context of Cantabrian Paleolithic Cave Art' by J. A. MOURE ROMANILLO Departamento de Prehistoria, Universidad de Santander, 39011 Santander, Spain. 15 iv 85 Tito Bustillo Cave (Ribadesella, Asturias) is now, along with Altamira, one of the most important Paleolithic cave art sites in the Cantabrian region of Spain. The karstic system has two separate sectors, each with access in Paleolithic times from an entrance with archaeological deposits-La Cuevona and an- other collapsed mouth referred to as Tito Bustillo Cave proper. The paintings and engravings of the two sectors differ in motifs, techniques, and styles (Balbin Behrmann and Moure Romanillo 1981, 1982a). The western sector contains the most spectacular decorated panels, such as the "horse gallery" (Balbin Behrmann and Moure Romanillo 1980) and the principal polychrome panel (Balbin Behrmann and Moure Romanillo 1982b, 1983). As in some French sites, remains of human occupation have been found in various parts of the cave. These include a living area at the original Tito Bustillo entrance and a specialized artistic activity area below the principal polychrome panel, as well as a site at the La Cuevona entrance excavated during the First World War. The Tito Bustillo habitation site has been under excavation since 1972 by a multidisciplinary team, some of whose results have already been published (e.g., Moure Romanillo and Cano Herrera 1978, 1979; Moure Romanillo 1979a). Since the writ- ing of these reports the most notable discovery has been an artificial structure associated with particular artifact types and a large number of mobile art objects. The structure consists of an elongated hole covered with a large stone. At the base of the hole there was an anthropomorphic sculpture carved in antler around which were clustered several slate or sandstone plaquettes with engravings of horses, deer, bison, and reindeer (Moure Romanillo 1979b, 1982a). These plaquettes and other works of mobile art from the site can serve to establish stylistic parallels to some of the rupestral figures and thus can indirectly help date the cave art (Moure Romanillo 1982b). Most striking is a magnificent carved pendant of red-deer antler, one of the outstanding finds of recent years (Moure Romanillo 1985). Remains of occasional occupation have also been found under the principal polychrome panel, suggesting the conduct of specialized artistic activities in this deep part of the cave. The panel includes an important superimposed series of paint- ings and engravings in nine phases culminating in the famous polychrome horses and reindeer (Balbin Behrmann and Moure Romanillo 1983). Investigations conducted in 1984 in collab- oration with M. R. Gonzalez Morales had as their goal the study of prehistoric activities related to the parietal art: access to the panel, subsistence, lighting, preparation and application of paints, and associated lithic technology. Spatial analysis of the remains shows two concentrations in front of the panel: one has not yet been interpreted, but the other corresponds to a hearth. Pigment materials are currently being analyzed, as are '1 1986 by the Wenner-Gren Foundation for Anthropological Re- search, all rights reserved 0011-3204/86/2701-0004$1.00. Translated by L. G. Straus. the lithics (including typology, debitage, and microwear anal- yses) and the faunal remains, which pertain to the genera Cer- vus, Equus, Capra, and Rupicapra. Some of the lithic artifacts bear microstriations with traces of pigment, suggesting that they were used in making some of the engravings done after some of the paintings on the cave wall. In summary, the multidisciplinary research being conducted in Tito Bustillo Cave has three fundamental objectives: docu- mentation of the parietal art, extensive excavation of the habi- tation site, and interpretation of the remains in the sanctuary area. Correlation of the latter with the living site in the cave entrance will provide better knowledge of the technology of the Paleolithic artists and both direct and indirect dating of their paintings and engravings. For the moment it seems well estab- lished that the polychromes and the last stages of the super- impositions of figures date to the early Upper Magdalenian, with absolute dates of ca. 14,000 B.P. (Bernaldo de Quir6s and Moure Romanillo 1978:23-25). The excavation of the Tito Bustillo entrance habitation site, together with other recent and ongoing studies (e.g., Fortea Perez 1981; Straus et al. 1981, 1983; Altuna 1984; Altuna and Merino 1984), constitutes a major advance in our understanding of the Cantabrian Mag- dalenian.
