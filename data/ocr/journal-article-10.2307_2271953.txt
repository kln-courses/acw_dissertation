PARIS Let 0(v) be a formula in the first-order language of arithmetic and let I'(0) = 0 (0) A V V (O(V) -- 0(V;t)) -&gt;V VO (V). I'(0) = 0(0) A 0 (1) A VV, W(0 (V) A 0 (W) &gt;0(V + W))--VVO(V). In this note we study the relationship between the schemas I' and I'. Our interest in I+ lies in the fact that it is ostensibly a more reasonable schema than I'. For, if we believe the hypothesis of I+(0) then to verify 0(n) only requires at most 210g2(n) steps, whereas assuming the hypothesis of I'(0) we require n steps to verify 0(n). In the physical world naturally occurring numbers n rarely exceed 101". For such n applying 210g2(n) steps is quite feasible whereas applying n steps may well not be. Of course this is very much an anthropomorphic argument so we would expect that it would be most likely to be valid when we restrict our attention to relatively simple formulas 0. We shall show that when restricted to open formulas I+ does not imply I' but that this fails for the classes n fin, n - 0. We shall work in PA-, where PA- consists of Peano's Axioms less induction together with VU, W(U + W = W + U A U W = W *U), Vu, W, t((U ? w)+ t = U + (W + t) A (U W)* t = U (W *t)) VU,W,t(U (W +t)= U *W +U t), VU, w(u Cw *- 3t(u + t = w)), VU, W(U W V W ?U), Vu, w, t(U + W = U + t -&gt; W = t). The reasons for working with PA- rather than Peano's Axioms less induction is that our additional axioms, whilst intuitively reasonable, will not necessarily follow from some of the weaker forms of I+ which we shall be considering. Of course PA- still contains those Peano Axioms which define + and Notice that, trivially, PA- k I'(0) -&gt; I+(0) for any formula 0. ?1. Notation. By the language of arithmetic we mean the first-order language with nonlogical symbols 0, c +, , ' (successor). As usual we abbreviate O' to 1 and use x &lt; y for x ? y A X#4 Y. We shall use t, u, v, w for formal variables and x, y, z for informal variables. Throughout 'formula' will mean formula in the langauge of arithmetic. A formula 0 is open if it contains no quantifiers. 0 is lo, or fol, if it is bounded. Received September 5, 1976. 113 01978, Association for Symbolic Logic</page><page sequence="2">114 J. B. PARIS (For the meaning of this term and other standard notation we refer the reader to [1].) Finally 0 is In+1 if it is of the form 3x+i(x) where +i(x) is HIn and 0 is ln+, if it is of the form Vxqi(x) where qi is En. We denote by I'Open the set of formulas I'(0) for open 0. Similar definitions apply to I'Open, IIzn etc. ?2. Statement of results. We shall show (1) PA- + I+Open Y I'Open. (2) For n 2 O. PA- + I+ln d k PA- + I'In (1) follows from Theorem 1, (2) from Lemma 2 and Theorem 3. We close by outlining corresponding results for Iln. THEOREM 1. PA + I Open Y I'Open. PROOF. Let M be a nonstandard model of Peano's Axioms. Let K be the set of a E M such that only finitely many l's appear in the binary expansion of a. Let H = {x - y Ix, y e K, y ? x}. H is closed under', +, *so we treat H as a substructure of M. Clearly H l= PA-. We shall show H l= I+Open but H l I'Open. Let 0(v) be open and for clarity assume 0 mentions no other free variables. Suppose HI= 0(0) A 0(1) A VV, W(0(V) A 0(W)-- 0(V + W)). Let a E H. We wish to show that HI= 0(a) (i.e. a satisfies 0(v) in H). By writing a in the form (2- 2 1) + (2 2- 2 2) +.+?(2 -2) where at 1 . . . awn l On, and noticing that for a &gt; 2-- 2X = (2a-1-23)+2"1, we can find (a code for) a sequence f in M such that f(0) = 0, f(1) = 1, a E Rg(f) and for 2 &lt; x E dom(f), f(x) E H and there exist y, z &lt; x such that f(x) = f(y).+ f(z). Since 0 is open M 1= 0(0) A 0(1) and for x, y E H, M= 0(x) A 0(y)- 0(X + Y). Since the code for f is in M we can express f(x) = y within M. Thus, with the obvious abbrevaitions, MI=Vw &lt;0, 0(f(w)) A VV e dom(f)[Vw &lt;v, 0(f(w))-&gt;Vw &lt;v', 0(f(w))]. Hence by induction in M, M = Vv e dom(f), 0(f(v)). Thus M l= 0(a) so H = 0 (a). Hence H l= I+Open. To show that I'(0) fails for some open 0, let b be a nonstandard odd integer in M. Then 2" E H. Let (b-1)/2 E s(i ) . 2(b -1)/2-t be the binary expansion of [VY2] in M. Then =0I)I2 s(i)/2' is the binary expansion of A/2 to (b - 1)/2 places in M.</page><page sequence="3">NOTE ON AN INDUCTION AXIOM 115 Thus Ei= s(i)/2' is the binary expansion of V2 in the real world. Hence [\/2b] E'H, since otherwise V/2 would be rational. Thus H i= 02 &lt;2 A VV(V2 &lt; 2b _(V)2 &lt; 2b) However since 2b E H, Hi= Vv(v2&lt;2b). Thus I'(v2&lt; w) fails in H. An equally easy argument shows that for b as above [2b/3] E''H. Thus I'(3v &lt; w) also fails in H. Of course for every x E H, [x /2] E H. However, even this may fail. A. J. Wilkie (unpublished) has found a model G of PA- + I'Open such that for some a E G, [a/2] E' G. Thus in G, I'(2v &lt; w) fails. LEMMA 2. PA-+I+10-+PA-+FI',. PROOF. Let J l= PA- + I+lo, let 0(v) be 1;O and for clarity assume that 0 has no other free variables. Suppose J 1= 0(0) A VV(0(V)-- 0(V')). We wish to show that for a E J, J l= 0(a). Let 4f(v, t) = Vw c t(0(w)- 0(w + v) v t &lt; w + v). Then, in J, fr(0, a) A (l, a). If 4fr(z, a) A fr(y, a) then for x ? a either a &lt; x + (y + z) or 0(x)- 0(x + z) and 0(x + z)- 0((x + z) + y) ( since x + z c a) and so ifr(y + z, a). Thus, since I+Io holds in J, J l= Vvifr(v, a). Putting v = a gives J l= Vw s a(0(w)-&gt; 0(w + a) v a &lt; w + a) and putting w = 0 gives J l= 0(a) as required. THEOREM 3. For n&gt;O, PA-+I+1n*PA +F-n PROOF. Assume J = PA- + I n We shall eventually show that J 1= I'n but first we need some results about the Diophantine equation p(x, y) = 0 where p(x, y) = x2 + y2 - 2axy - 1, a E J. The idea of using this equation comes from Julia Robinson's paper [2]. In the following propositions we assume a ? 2, a E J. Notice p (0, y) = 0 just if y = 1. PROPOSITION 4. Let p (x, y) = 0, 0 &lt; x ' y, x, y E J. Then, in J, (i) (2a - 1)x &lt; y c2ax, (ii) p(2ax - y, x) =0 and 2ax - y &lt; x, (iii) p(y, 2ay - x) =0 and y &lt; 2ay - x. PROOF. (i) If 2ax &lt; y then 1=x 2+y2 -2axy =x2+y(y-2ax)x2+y &gt;1. If 2ax-y x then l=x2+y2-2axy =x2-y(2ax-y_)x2-xy s0. (ii), (iii) now follow easily. PROPOSITION 5. JI=Vv 0(va) where 0(v,a) is 3u, W(P(U, W) = 0 A U S W A U = vmod(a - 1) A W = (v + 1)mod(a - 1)). PROOF. We work in J. Clearly 0 (0, a) A 0 (1, a). Suppose P(Xi, Yi) = 0 A Xi S Yi A xi = zi mod(a - 1) A Yi = (zi + 1) mod(a - 1) for i = 1, 2. Then it is straightforward to check that if x = y1x2- x1(2ax2 - Y2), Y = Y1Y2 - xlx2 then</page><page sequence="4">116 J. B. PARIS p(x,y)=O, x"y, x =(z1+z2)mod(a-1), y =(z1+z2+1)mod(a-1). Thus 0(zi, a) A (Z2, a)-- 0(z1 + Z2, a). Since 0 is ;1 the result follows by I+zYi. PROPOSITION 6. Forx1,x2,y1,y2 EJifp(Xlyl)=p(X2,y2)=OX1 C y Y, X2C Y2 then either (x 1 = X2 &amp; Y 1 = y2) or (Y2 &lt; X 1) or (y 1 &lt; X2). PROOF. Working in J let 0(v, a) be the statement that this proposition holds for all x1, X2, y1, y2 C V. Clearly we may take 0 to be ,. It is enough to show Vv0(v, a). Clearly 0(0, a) A 0(1, a). Assume 0(x, a) A 0(y, a). We wish to show 0(x+y,a). To this end suppose x1,x2,y1,y2?'x+y, x1'y1, x2'y2, p(x1, y1) = p(x2, Y2) = 0 and, without loss of generality x ' y, x1 ? x2. If x1 = 0 or xI = x2 or Yi ' x2 we are home, so we may suppose 0 &lt; x1 &lt; x2 &lt; y1 . By Proposition 4, p(2ax1-y1,x1)=p(2ax2-y2,x2)=O, and, since a 2, 3x1&lt;yi'x +y ?2y,3x2&lt;y2?x +y ?2y.Thus2axv-yi,xi,2ax2-y2,x2? y. If 2ax2 - y2 = x1 then x2 = y , a contradiction, so, by 0(y, a), we must have x1&lt;2ax2-y2. Again by 0(y,a), x1i'2a(2ax2-y2)-x2. But then using Proposition 4(i), 2ax1 ? &gt; x2 ? (2a - 1)2(2a(2ax2 - Y2) - X2) ? (2a - 1)2x1 &gt; 2ax1, a contradiction. Thus 0(x + y, a) follows and so Vv0(v, a) holds by I+;1. ?3. Proof of Theorem 3 continued. Let qi(v) be ;n and for clarity assume no other free variables appear in qi. Suppose (*) ~~~~~~J F= q1(0) A V V (q(V) -&gt; q1(V ))- We wish to show J l= Vvqif(v). Since a -2 was arbitrary it is enough to show Jl= Vt &lt; a - 1, if(t). To this end put 0(v, a) = 3u, w, t(t &lt; a - 1 A p(U, W) = 0 A U &lt; V &lt; W A u = t mod(a - 1) A W = (t + l)mod(a - 1) A q1(t)). Now work in J. Clearly 0(0, a) A 0(1, a). Suppose 0(x, a) A 0(y, a), say x ? y and x1?' y &lt; yj and z1 &lt; a - A p(x1, yi) = O A Xi = zi mod(a -1) A yi = (z1 + 1)mod(a - 1) A fi(z1). Then xi &lt; x + y &lt; 2y, c (2a - I)yj &lt; 2ay, - xi, so either x1i x + y &lt; y1 or y1?, x + y &lt; 2ay1 x1. Since 2ay1 x1 = (z1 + 2)mod(a - 1) we have, using Proposition 4 and (*), that in either case 0 (x + y, a). Since 0 is n, by IIn ~ Vv 0 (v, a). By Proposition 5 for z &lt; a - 1 there exist x, y such that X &lt; y A p(X, y) = 0 AX = z mod(a - 1) A y = (z + 1)mod(a - 1). Since 0(x) holds and since, by Proposition 6, x is not covered by any other roots of p, qi(z) must hold as required. ?4. Remark on the II case. Using a very similar proof, Theorem 3 also holds with II in place of 1. Since PA- + IFn * PA- + I'l, combining our results gives PA + 1+1n dk PA- + I n</page><page sequence="5">NOTE ON AN INDUCTION AXIOM 117 There must surely be an easier derivation of this result.
