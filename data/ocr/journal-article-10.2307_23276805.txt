Christiane Falgayrettes-Leveau, director of the Musée Dapper, was the curator of the exhibition and Boris Wastiau, director of the Ethnographic Museum in Geneva, was its scientific adviser. The approach of the exhi bition clearly paid homage to Marie-Louise Bastin, the Belgian specialist who dedicated her life to the study of the art of the Chokwe and related peoples, and who provided inspi ration for this show with the exhibition "Escultura angolana: Memorial de Culturas," which she organized in 1994 at the Museu Nacional de Etnologia in Lisbon. Credit is due to Christiane Falgayrettes Leveau for having been able to bring together the major works in this selection. They were lent by several European institutions, espe cially those in Portugal, such as the Museu de Histôria Natural da Universidade de Coim bra and the Museu Nacional de Etnologia in Lisbon. The Musée Dapper also prided itself on very exceptional loans from the Museu Nacional de Antropologia in Luanda. Objects from private collections completed this beau tiful exhibition. Attentive to contemporary artistic creation, the Musée Dapper presented, as a preamble, works by the Angolan artist Antonio Ole. Entering the exhibition, visitors were struck by the force emanating from the works, those of the Chokwe especially, which glistened in the semi-darkness (Fig. 1). Most of the objects were displayed in individual showcases and in subdued lighting that allowed for a closer and more intimate view. In this atmosphere favor able to meditation one bathed in a resolutely aesthetic presentation. Yet the visit was also enhanced by informative maps and texts wth specific, smaller labels providing visitors with further details on some of the objects. Field photographs as well as a film made by art histo rian Manuel Jordan (2010), gave a better idea of the original context of some of the objects. All this information was complemented by a free pamphlet. This exhibition, under the high patronage of Angola's ambassador to France, aimed to show the diversity of Angolan artistic heritage; how ever, its theme and scope seemed a little hazy. Contrary to what one might presume, it was not entirely limited to the political frontiers of Angola and included several objects originat ing in neighboring countries as well as works of uncertain origin. Although the intent was to point out the undeniable cultural continu ity reflected through the choice of objects, one may ask if the very vast framework was a little too ambitious. Let us add, for the benefit of the English-speaking public, that the sub title of the exhibition evokes the term "power figure," which may have misled visitors as to the type of pieces exhibited. Although the show devoted much space to power figures, especially those of the Kongo peoples, it also reached beyond the magico-religious sphere with which these objects are usually associated and offered many other works that were sup posed to reflect "multiple powers." The visitors' attention was first drawn to the sphere of political power embodied by Chokwe statuettes wearing a chief s headdress (mutwe wa kayanda), which was also repre sented on other important objects with figu rative elements such as scepters. The splendid figure from the collection of the Museu de Histôria Natural, Faculdade de Ciências, Porto (Fig. 2), one of the masterworks of the exhi bition, was identified by Marie-Louise Bas tin (1961) as an effigy of Chibinda Ilunga, the mythical ancestor and civilizing hero cele brated by the Chokwe.

Their refinement rivaled other objects of prestige such as pipes and tobacco mortars. Power should also be understood in a "spiri tual" sense, and this was the second axis cho sen by the organizers of the exhibition. Among the Chokwe and related peoples, the ancestors' cult and the rituals during which their spir its appear, such as the mukanda—initiation rites that mark the transition of young boys to adulthood with the Chokwe, Lunda, Ngangela and others—are expressed in a great number of art works. Many masks used on those occa sions were exhibited (Figs. 3-4). Apart from the theme of initiation, though still dealing with the spiritual, visitors discov ered showcases dedicated to the topic of ill ness and divination, which is practiced by the Chokwe through a variety of techniques and instruments. Divination and therapeutic or propitiatory practices led visitors to the works of the Kongo peoples (Fig. 5). Their power fig ures, either anthropomorphic or zoomorphic, are activated with magical ingredients hid den by a diviner-healer, the nganga, in cavities provided on these sculptures. As these objects are part of therapeutic practices, during which they are modified, they exemplify the notion of "process art" as defined by Malcolm McLeod (1976:99-101). The power invested in these sculptures and in the practitioners who activate them was the last form of power to be introduced to visitors. However, many pieces illustrated that there is no singular categorization of power, but rather that there are significant interconnections between different possible domains (see Petri dis 2008). These interactions, such as between the political and magico-religious sphere, might have been more clearly documented and dem onstrated throughout the exhibition layout, as announced by the show s subtitle. The show also tried to emphasize the links and affinities among several peoples of Angola. These ties were obvious in the first section, where we found works associated with the mukanda of the Chokwe and related peo ples, a transethnic and transborder institution, known elsewhere under the name of nkanda or n-khanda. Their relationship is felt more on a contextual than stylistic level, as pointed out by Boris Wastiau in his monograph on the Chokwe (2006:8). Masks other than those of the Chokwe were included, especially those of the Kwango region, where Yaka masks have inspired those of the Zombo and Nkanu, who also make wooden polychrome panels attached to a shelter made of branches. The latter were exhibited in a separate, small space, which scenographically evoked the closed aspect of rites of initiation. On the second floor we entered a different universe, with works of some very diverse peo ples who share little in common apart from the fact that they all live in Angola, such as the Himba (Fig. 6) and the Kongo. The case of the magico-religious pieces of the Kongo peo ples, included in the exhibition under the ver nacular name of minkisi (sg. nkisi), raises the question of the validity of the use of certain concepts on the scale of an entire region (see Hersak 2001). The field work carried out by Dunja Hersak among the Vili and the Yombe of the Kwilu (Republic of Congo) shows that 3 Chihongo mask Chokwe, Angola Resin, fiber, cloth, pigments; 78 cm Colecgao do Museu Antropologico Museu de Historia Natural da Universi dade de Coimbra; acquired in 1989 Inv. n° ANT.89.1.273 PHOTO: OLIVIER GALLAUD, © ARCHIVES MUSliE DAPPER, PARIS ET MUSEU ANTROP OL6GICO, MUSEU DE HISTORIA NATURAL DA UNIVERSIDADE DE COIMBRA 4 View of the exhibition.

Hersak also pointed out that in the northwest of the vast Kongo region, it is the spirits and the forces of nature that occupy a central position, rather than the ancestors who are venerated by the Kongo groups of the southeast (ibid., p. 622). It is therefore regret table that the Musée Dapper chose to interpret these objects in a generalizing manner. Still, the show offered an undeniable feast for the eye with exceptional pieces on display. It was accompanied by a catalogue, Angola, figures de pouvoir, published under the direc tion of Christiane Falgayrettes-Leveau with the scientific collaboration of Boris Wastiau. Included is an introduction by Christiane Fal gayrettes-Leveau and contributions by Manuel Gutierrez, Maria Alexandra Miranda Aparicio, Boris Wastiau, Manuel Jordan, Barbara Mar tinez-Ruiz, Viviane Baeke, Maria do Rosârio Martins and Maria Arminda Miranda, and Adriano Mixinge (Editions Dapper, 2010; 312 pages, numerous illustrations both in color and in black and white; €46 cloth; €34 paper). Guided visits, discussion groups, films screenings, and literary round tables were also organized within the framework of the exhibit.
