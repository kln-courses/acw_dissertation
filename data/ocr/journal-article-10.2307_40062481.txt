<plain_text><page sequence="1">FALLEN MAN: FORBIDDEN KNOWLEDGE, FORGOTTEN KNOWLEDGE Joseph Anthony Mazzeo The problem of interpretation is not the problem of how one begins from the Bible without any previous understanding of what it should mean; the problem is rather how one is enabled to change from a previ- ous interpretation to another one. (James Barr, The Bible in the Mod- ern World, p. 157) With the strength conferred by certain knowledge of his innocence, Job reminds his comforters that wisdom resides in age and that understanding comes with time. With the ancient is wisdom; and in length of days understanding. With him is wisdom and strength; he hath counsel and understanding. (AV, 12:12-13) Later in the unfolding of the drama, Job returns to the theme again, in the magnificent laudation of wisdom of chapter twenty-eight, but here this supreme possession of God is not to be found anywhere among us. But where shall wisdom be found? And where is the place of understanding? Man knoweth not its price; neither is it found in the land of the living. ( AV, 28 : 12-13) The first passage from Job I have cited by no means implies that the growth of wisdom necessarily increases with one's age, or that successive increments of wisdom accrue to the aged with the mere passage of time. Understanding will come, if at all, with age. If any men are wise, it is old men, and in this sense wisdom lies in the past, among "older and wiser heads" if it is anywhere to be found among the living. Certainly, too, the wisdom Job seeks has little or nothing to do with knowledge, or its utility, and still less with its increase. To be wise is to live consonantly with hu- man limitations as well as possibilities, and ultimate wisdom may be the</page><page sequence="2">48 m a z z e o Journal acceptance of the limitations of knowledge and understanding itself, a surrender to the unmasterable mystery. When the Voice from the Whirl- wind puts an end to what could have been an endless cycle of debate, it offers Job no new knowledge concerning the universe or the ways of God to man. He is simply asked to look at his familiar world in an unfamiliar way and to learn that man is man and God is God. What you learn is what you already knew and the truth of Plato's doc- trine of anamnesis, of knowledge as recollection, may be more readily applied to what the author of Job understood as wisdom than to the Py- thagorean theorem. Thus, the burden and mystery of existence which press so heavily upon Job cannot yield to anything we call knowledge. Man requires wisdom and that is essentially a divine attribute and a divine gift. The future in and of itself will not bestow that gift upon us, but God may choose miraculously to intervene in the flow of time and enlighten some of us. Not all men are asked to confront the riddle of existence in the way that Job did and still fewer achieve so dramatic a reconciliation and resolution of their conflict and suffering. But all men surely have occasion to wonder at the inextricable interweaving of good and evil, understanding and ig- norance, joy and sorrow which enter the fabric of any life, and to seek illumination where they can find it. For most of the Christian centuries of our civilization, the first three chapters of Genesis, Creation and Fall, were believed most capable of enlightening us concerning the human situation. In these few chapters, as no where else, we might learn that what we were intended to be, why we fail of that intention and, at least by implication, what we might do to rescue ourselves. It will be convenient for the reader if I remind him of the salient features of the Biblical narrative of the fall and of some of the problems that nar- rative presents. Our first parents, after their creation, dwelt in the garden of Eden in a state of innocence and in harmony with nature. They were aware of their duty to tend the garden, so to speak, and not to eat of the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. Although there is doubt concerning whether we are to understand that Adam and Eve were created immortal, it seems clear that if they kept the commandment of Yahweh they would continue to live indefinitely, and that the punishment of death is specific for the crime of disobedience to the prohibition. The serpent enters the scene and lures Eve by the promise of divinization to eat of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. She, in turn, has Adam join in her disobedi- ence.</page><page sequence="3">Fallen Man 49 The first sign of their fallen condition is that their eyes are opened and they are aware, in shame, that they are naked. Yahweh learns that the first pair have disobeyed him, fears that they have become like "one of us" in the knowledge of good and evil and might complete their diviniza- tion by eating of the tree of life which would make them truly immortal. He therefore expels them from the garden of Eden, from that "pleasure" or "delight" which the name itself denotes, and bars their re-entry into Eden by setting an angel with a flaming sword to guard it. They lose their innocence, pleasure and safety and are henceforth condemned to labor hard to exist and to bear children in pain.1 Chapter three of Genesis simply resists rationalization of the narrative in psychological terms and even in terms of the pattern of cause and effect which permits us to rationalize our daily experience. We encounter, for example, a talking serpent with nothing to account for this unusual phe- nomenon. What motive would Eve have for wanting to disobey Yahweh? Where was Adam when the serpent and Eve meet? Why does Adam not refuse to eat the forbidden fruit? Since Eve did not come into existence until after Yahweh prohibits the fruit of the tree of knowledge, did Adam convey this prohibition to her? Neither Yahweh nor the first couple ever try to find out why the serpent brought about the primal catastrophe. And so on. Regarded as myth, the story is not resistant to valid interpretation, but regarded as narrative we encounter all of the problems that plagued exe- getes for centuries. Nevertheless, for centuries the story was read as narrative describing historical events of the greatest magnitude which illuminated human ex- istence by locating for us the origin of the evils which plague us and the massive dislocation in man's relation to God and to the rest of creation. Confronted with the problem of evil, our ancestors were told to turn to the past in the search for wisdom, to the consideration of a prior date, an original condition, far better than their present lot, and to a tragic event whose consequences are visible in human suffering, ignorance and the inevitability of death. A "foundation" story or myth of a "fall" is by no means the exclusive possession of the Judaeo-Christian culture. It is widespread in both primi- tive and sophisticated form. Plato's beautiful myth of the soul in the Phaedrus, depicting the fall of the pre-existent blissful soul into the igno- rance and finitude of temporal existence, originated in Orphic myths con- cerning the loss of an original state of felicity and what man must do to restore it. It is as surely a myth of Fall and Restoration as the Biblical</page><page sequence="4">50 M a z z E o Journal story, although it differs radically from it in its conception of the Fall and the remedy for its consequences. If the Biblical solution to the problem of man's existence is adumbrated in the covenant God makes with Abraham and, for Christians, is fulfilled in that New Covenant given us in the Re- demption, for Plato it lies in "remembering" our origin through the power of the philosophic eros. Different as these two stories may be, they both proclaim that man is alienated from his true being and both find the solution in restoration to a prior state, whether that state lay in time or in eternity. Under the influence of centuries of pastoral poetry, we are likely to identify the Biblical story of the expulsion from Eden with the classical myth of a Golden Age and the progressive decay of both the world and man to the Iron age we now must live in. Arcadia looks much like Eden to the poetic imagination, and both regions readily may symbolize a primor- dial state of innocence and happiness long lost and nostalgically remem- bered. But the myth of a Golden Age is not a myth of Fall. Set in the frame- work of a cyclical theory of natural and historical change, it would serve to foster the hope that generation would inevitably follow corruption and the Golden Age would surely return. Mankind has not fallen but decayed. Its restoration will not be the result of divine intervention, the last act in the cosmic drama. On the contrary, the same powers that bring about decay will bring about regeneration. Aristotle's On Generation and Corruption gives philosophical expression to the latent conceptual content of the myth as it developed from Hesiod to Virgil. Thus, unlike stories of a Fall, whether "historical," like the Genesis story, or "metaphysical," like the Phaedrus myth of the soul, the myth of the four ages is essentially a theory of eternal cycles of growth and decay. The present plight of man does not originate in a catastrophe at the origin of things. Indeed, I can think of no version of the myth which describes an absolute origin of the world any way resembling the first verse of Gene- sis. Greek cosmogonies, philosophical or mythic, posit archai or begin- nings, to be sure, but the beginnings are generally full of things which the Genesis author left to the six days of creation. The myth of the Golden Age differs radically from those myths of fall we may find within Greek culture itself. Our present sorry state does not derive, as in the Phaedrus, from the existence of an aboriginal principle of disorder and evil - a "dark horse" in the soul - which precipitates the soul into "forgetfulness," a fallen corporeal and temporal existence. Not, as in the Prometheus myth, did primal man or his divine benefactor tres- pass against a supreme authority and a divinely ordained limit. The four</page><page sequence="5">Fallen Man 51 ages and their recurrences simply disclose the inevitability of the processes of nature, of growth and decay, of death issuing from life and life from death. The hope offered is that, although we live in the Winter of the world, Spring will return. If we seek a classical myth to juxtapose to the Biblical fall, we would discover both sharper contrasts and more profound affinities if we choose the Prometheus story. Both our first parents and Prometheus, however different, were involved in a primordial act of disobedience, of transgres- sion of limits, and were precipitated into the profound ambiguities and risks which attend the acquisition of forbidden knowledge. That Pro- metheus is a trickster while the serpent is the trickster in Eden, that Pro- metheus came to be viewed as a hero and benefactor of mankind, while Adam became the cause of all our woes, is simply a measure of the differ- ence between Greek and Hebrew religion. Nietzsche, in his Birth of Trag- edy explicitly identified the Prometheus myth as the "Aryan" myth of the Fall and treats Prometheus as the prototype of the supreme religious crea- tion of the Greeks, the tragic hero. Given the moral or amoral character of the Greek divinities, rebellion could have a positive value impossible to derive from an act of rebellion against Yahweh. If various and contrasting values may be expressed by myths of Fall, is there some perception they may all be said to have in common? Pro- visionally we may try to apply to such myths a remarkable definition of peace offered to us by Alfred North Whitehead: The meaning of Peace is most clearly understood by considering it in its relation to the tragic issues which are essential in the nature of things. Peace is the understanding of tragedy, and at the same time its preservation.2 Unlike the purely naturalistic concept of eternal cycles, the myth of a Fall of man may permit us to hold together in a unity the contradictory aspects of experience, its sufferings and hopes, without sacrificing one term to the other and, so, drastically simplifying our understanding of the world. It permits us to understand "tragedy" and to preserve it, to con- serve understanding and peace together. Man is, as Pascal said, neither angel nor beast but partakes of both natures. Physically, he is a transient mote of dust while as a center of consciousness he is and possesses all of the world that is. Since man is neither radically good nor radically evil, he discovers a disproportion between guilt and retribution in all of his expe- rience which defines his moral universe as "tragic." Hence, if his sufferings are inevitable, they are bound in a mysterious way with the emergence of</page><page sequence="6">52 m a z z e o Journal wisdom out of fallen innocence, eventual harmony out of present disorder, of restoration out of alienation. The myth of the Fall defines man as a kind of divine ruin subject to sufferings and death but bearing in his "mem- ory" traces of what he once was and may yet hope to become. This, at least, is one great tradition of interpretation of the Fall and its promised remedy. Perceived in this light, the myth of the Fall may be directly opposed to the idea of progress, for both deal in opposing ways with the complex rela- tions which may obtain between knowledge and happiness. Until the rise of the modern idea of progress beginning in the seventeenth century, our ancestors, pagan, Jewish or Christian, would have conceived of wisdom, happiness and peace as possible only through a kind of restoration of man to a past condition, one when he lived in harmony with God and nature or when, freed from the trammels of corporeal and temporal existence, he enjoyed the bliss of eternity.3 The acquisition of forbidden knowledge may have been the proximate cause of his fall, or the forgetting of the knowl- edge of who and what he truly is, but what he should have never known or never forgotten were events located in the past. The myth of progress reverses the temporal orientation of mankind and establishes a new relation between knowledge and happiness. Both the myth of the Fall and the myth of progress address themselves to the prob- lem of what is wrong with our present life, how we got into the state we are in, and what we might do, if anything, to extricate ourselves. Indeed, Francis Bacon, the putative father of the idea of progress, affirms that knowledge of a certain kind, scientific and technological knowledge, will restore man to his lost dominion over nature and so in some degree remedy the consequences of the Fall. Remedies for our fallen condition have taken various forms in the history of this myth. Obviously the Church and its sacraments were one such proffered remedy. St. Augus- tine views the state as remedying some of the worst consequences of our fallen condition as, in a secular way, did Thomas Hobbes centuries later. Humanistic educators such as Milton proffer education as one such partial remedy. But Bacon claimed more for his remedy than any forerunner, for it would not only help us some now but would radically transform the future and the lot of mankind with it. The modern heirs of the idea of progress are as resolutely turned toward the unknown future for solutions to the problem of existence as our ancestral believers in a fall were turned to the past. Of course, traditional believers posed the problems and their solutions in mythic and religious terms. For them, there were other realities than the ones we are immersed</page><page sequence="7">Fallen Man 53 in, some of them invisible, divine, and possessed of powers far transcend- ing our own. Although apparently secular, the modern believers in the idea of progress have their own invisible realities: the inevitable course of his- tory, the "dialectic," the inevitable dominion of reason, all of them quasi- mythic entities which have all the attributes of a divinity except conscious- ness and will.4 It is thus not simply temporal orientation which separates modern men from their more remote ancestors, spiritual Arcadians from spiritual Uto- pians, men who perceive themselves as "fallen" from those who perceive themselves as progressing. Each of the two dominating myths I have de- fined conveys a radically different attitude towards knowledge. We are most of us today certain that it is invariably better to know than to be ignorant, that no knowledge is in any sense "forbidden," that knowledge is really power of one kind or another, over nature or over others. Bacon, buccinator temporis novi, the herald of the new age, promised us that scientific and technical knowledge would give us dominion over nature and ameliorate the lot of man. If it could not undo the curse of death, it would lighten the labors of man and lessen his sufferings. If fallen man was condemned to live by the sweat of his brow, and fallen woman to bear children in pain, there is little question that for a substantial minority of the human race the sort of progress in knowledge that Bacon envisaged has in fact served served to remedy some consequences of the Fall. When we turn to the Genesis story, or to the Prometheus myth or even to the Phaedrus, we encounter a more complex and ambiguous attitude towards knowledge. The Biblical story of the Fall lent itself to some astonishingly varied interpretations in its long life, and one constant factor in engendering this variety was the ambiguity later ages found in the di- vine prohibition of eating of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. Especially among Hellenistic interpreters, the prohibition of moral knowl- edge presented a serious problem, not about knowledge, but about the moral character of a God who would prohibit that kind of knowledge! Indeed, the Gnostic Ophites and the author of the Apocryphon of John invert the traditional meaning of the story, the former by making the ser- pent a hero, a kind of Prometheus, while the latter has Christ himself invite man to eat of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. But such an interpretation rested on the conception of the God of the Old Testament as evil and on the God revealed by Christ as the true, good God, a solution scarcely acceptable to the orthodox.5 After Plato, it was impossible in Greek culture for any philosopher to think of knowledge, moral or philosophical, as evil or dangerous. The</page><page sequence="8">54 mazzeo Journal tragedians or a Thucydides could conserve the profound ancient under- standing of the ambiguities of knowledge, its dangerous potentialities and the terrifying ironies which emerge when conscious intention and achieved result are separated by an abyss. It is surely no accident that Whitehead, the greatest admirer of Plato among modern thinkers, could nevertheless criticize sharply the ready connection we are prepared to make between goodness and truth. It is an erroneous moral platitude, that it is necessarily good to know the truth. The minor truth may beget a major evil. And this minor evil may take the form of a major error. Henri Poincare points out that instruments of precision, used unseasonably, may hinder the ad- vance of science. For example, if Newton's imagination had been dominated by the errors in Kepler's Laws as disclosed by modern ob- servation, the world might still be waiting for the Law of Gravitation. The Truth must be seasonable.6 If it was hard for the great majority of Jews or Christians to think of Yahweh as truly envious of, or malicious toward, men, the Greeks were less troubled about attributing such characteristics to Zeus. A Xenophanes or a Plato would have rejected the traditional myths as not theoprepes, not befitting the divine nature, but most men do not as readily identify religion and morality, and before allegorization became a universally ac- ceptable way of "purifying" the less savory stories told about the gods, the myths received a due measure of serious acceptance. The story of Prometheus, Nietzsche's "Aryan" counterpart to the Bib- lical story, would have struck the sensibility of a Jew or a Christian as very wicked indeed. Prometheus who made men out of clay had as his first duty to protect them from the envy and malice of Zeus who went so far as to deprive mankind of fire. Prometheus was constrained to steal back fire from heaven so that he could provide his creatures precisely with knowledge, knowledge of the arts which are the foundation of culture and indispensable to human survival. The first humans in this story did not inhabit a paradisical garden, were not in state of innocence from which knowledge could only expel them. They needed to know to survive. Tricks and tricksters dominate the Prometheus myth. In the primal in- stitution of the practice of sacrifice, Prometheus tricked Zeus into ac- cepting permanently the less edible portions of the sacrificial animals by wrapping the undesirable parts in tempting layers of fat, thereby reserving the best and most nutritious parts of the victims for the use of man. Zeus, in his rage at the deception, plotted a fitting revenge, a counter-creation which would undo Prometheus and his creation. He asked Hephaestus,</page><page sequence="9">Fallen Man 55 the divine artisan, to make a woman out of clay, Pandora. Athena breathed the spirit of life into the lifeless clay and the rest of the gods and goddesses in the Pantheon endowed her with whatever gifts were in their possession to bestow. From this she derived the name of "all-gifts." Hermes the di- vine messenger, thief and trickster, endowed her with two charms which would prove the undoing of Prometheus' creatures: flattery and guile. Zeus offered this marvellous gift to Prometheus but he, whose very name means "fore-thought," saw what consequences acceptance would bring and refused the gift. His brother Epimetheus, like his name, was limited to "after-thought" or "hindsight." He was, therefore, totally lack- ing in prudence, and so was as delighted to receive Pandora as his brother was firm in refusing her. She brought with her to Epimetheus' hearth a box which, when it was opened, released upon mankind all the evils that now beset the human race. Thus Zeus worked his revenge. Only one thing remained in the box and that was hope. At this point our story becomes richly ambiguous, at least to readers shaped by a cul- ture in which hope is traditionally a supreme virtue. Clearly, the readers of Hesiod's Theogony were not as constrained to attach a high value to hope. Is hope, then, an evil, the only evil which Zeus has spared us? Is it an evil because it is a illusion? But men, even pessimistic Greeks, seem to require hope, even illusory hope, if only to lighten the burden of existence. Whatever the earliest versions of this story intended to convey to its hearers, the prevailing interpretation in antiquity seems to have affirmed both that hope is an illusion and a necessity, one which makes life en- durable.7 Prometheus finally fell victim to Zeus because he knew the secret of the marriage of Thetis and refused to divulge it to Zeus. Zeus loved Thetis and knew that one of the sons she might have from him would be more powerful than his father. He did not, however, know which son as yet un- born that would be. Prometheus knew but refused to say. Zeus had him chained to a rock in the Caucasus and an eagle fed daily on his liver, which was restored each night to be eaten again the next day. This torment went on for ages until, according to one version, Prometheus submitted and told the secret of Thetis or until he was released by Heracles. Thetis was married to Peleus instead of Zeus and their son was Achilles. Like all "stratified texts," the story of Prometheus comes to us in a form variously elaborated and modified by later, more urbane, interpreters than those who originated it. Yet it is clear that the oldest themes in it parallel the Biblical account of the Fall: the origin of man from earth or clay, an in-breathing of the spirit or breath of life by a divinity, an act of</page><page sequence="10">56 M a z z e o Journal disobedience against a supreme divine authority involving the human ac- quisition of a divine, forbidden kind of knowledge, a punishment visited upon the human race which accounts for its present unfortunate condition, the origin of sexual differentiation (Genesis, of course, has two versions of that event) , a passage from a state of "innocence" to a state of culture, wherein both life and the knowledge to live it present themselves as an inextricable tangle of good and evil. There are, of course, many and obvious differences between the two stories and I shall return to a consideration of what some of them are, but the thematic, if not narrative, parallels are striking enough, and validate Nietzsche's insight as to their isomorphism. The Greeks themselves, however, saw heroic and tragic qualities in the Promethean rebellion for the sake of mankind which cannot be derived from the story of Adam and still less from the story of Christ perceived as the undoer of the Adamic fall. For Prometheus was a rebel and Christ the suffering servant of God. Both stories confront the problem of evil and suffering but in radically different ways, for Christ transcends the tragic while Prometheus remains within that sphere of value and judgment. If the theme of forbidden knowledge runs through the stories of Adam and Prometheus, Plato transforms the deeply rooted human conviction of a Fall into a story about forgotten knowledge rather than forbidden knowledge. In the myth of the soul in the Phaedrus, we learn that the soul originally enjoyed existence beyond space and time in a joyous contem- plation of the "plain of truth," the transcendent forms of beauty, justice, truth and other supreme realities so imperfectly or transiently manifested in our world of space and time. The soul is symbolized by a charioteer driving a chariot drawn by two horses, one white and one dark, circling round beyond the outermost surface of the cosmic sphere. For some reason which is not and cannot be truly explained, by a kind of primordial "accident," the dark horse pulls the soul downward toward the world of becoming against the upward desire of the white horse and the rational control of the charioteer. Thus the dark horse precipitates a descent or Fall into the world of space and time, the incarnation of the soul into a body which imprisons it. This Fall is accompanied by the soul's forgetting its true origin, its true home and its divine nature. The cause of the soul's Fall in this story illus- trates most clearly a feature of any story of a Fall: it must presuppose what it assumes as result. Perfect innocence or a universe without the pre- condition of actual evil could never become a fallen world. However good the creation or harmonious the cosmos, we have to have a serpent, a sus-</page><page sequence="11">Fallen Man 57 ceptible mankind, a "dark horse" to get from a "perfect" world to the one we live in. Of all the forms which the soul used to enjoy in contemplation before its fall into bodiliness, only beauty can manifest itself clearly and fully in this world. Truth and justice are dimly and imperfectly perceived, but beauty elicits love and love begins the process of remembering, of anam- nesis, which, appropriately guided, leads to our remembering what we truly are and what we once knew. Love is thus nostalgia, the half-con- scious desire for a supremely valuable, lost object. It is truly a kind of docta ignorantia, an ignorant knowing, the beginning of remembering. Of course the kind of knowledge which Plato refers to over and over again as an unqualified good and the very beatitude of man is not to be confounded with knowledge of arts, crafts or skills of one kind or an- other, or with the knowledge offered by traditional "exoteric" branches of knowledge. Indeed, the platonic truth that sets men free and gives them their true being and felicity is scarcely describable in words. It cannot really be written down and it can hardly be uttered. The conclusion of the Phaedrus itself, the doctrine of the Good expounded in the Republic, the Seventh Letter and other platonic texts make this abundantly clear. It was Plato or the platonic Socrates who established in Greek culture the supreme value of knowledge and its power to divinize man. Indeed, knowledge is truly virtue and cannot but lead to happiness. The good man is not only a knower but knows that nothing evil can happen to him pre- cisely because he is good. With the victory of this conviction over subse- quent Greek philosophical thought, the theme of forbidden or dangerous knowledge passed out of the consideration of Greek thinkers and was left to the tragedians and historians to deal with. The Oedipus Rex of Sophocles relentlessly works out the devastating possibility that the Del- phic maxim "Know Thyself" is not thoughtlessly to be implemented. Simi- larly, the goddess tyche, fortune, who presides over the affairs of men in Thucydides reveals that men never possess enough knowledge, or the right kind of knowledge, to insure that their intentions in action regularly lead to corresponding results. Great and tragic consequences thus follow from apparently trivial or innocent errors. If Nicias had not been subject to a superstitious awe of eclipses, he would not have delayed the with- drawal of his troops from Sicily and would have saved them. Plato then tells us that man is a "fallen" being but that his Fall was a Fall from knowledge, not from an innocent state but from a disembodied divine state, and that man's beatitude lies in a return to his original con- dition. Man returns by remembering the knowledge he had lost and is led</page><page sequence="12">58 mazzeo Journal to this return by the awakening and driving power of love. In contrast, the Adamic fall and the struggles of Prometheus are a fall into knowledge, however necessary and inevitable such knowledge may be. The knowl- edge they acquire is essentially a divine prerogative, is truly power, and cannot be gained except through a rebellious or disobedient act of the will. The platonic conception of the Fall was elaborated by Plato's greatest successor, Plotinus, and he drew out of it the implication that the Fall of man, a necessary result of the emanation of all things from the One, is a fall into finitude. It is only by our return to the One, our re-absorption into that luminous infinity, that we can overcome evil. It is not simply matter itself which is the lowest state of being but the particularity and individu- ality which matter confers. There is, thus, an inevitability about the pla- tonistic Fall which is not present in the Biblical myth. The course of evil in the latter is finally a rebellious and disobedient will manifested by a creature to his Creator. Individuality as in itself a necessary condition of evil is not in any way a Biblical idea. Kierkegaard was certainly correct in his insistence on the ultimate ir- relevance of the history of the world or the universal categories of nature and history to the Christian view of things and there is indeed an absolute relation between the Christian story of Fall and Redemption and the single individual. The superiority, in this view of the Genesis myth, to other accounts would reside precisely in the presentation of the universal hu- man condition as the religious story of individuals. Adam and Eve, Abra- ham and Sarah are first and foremost individuals involved in an absolute relationship with God. If we seek for a modern myth of the Fall rather than the interpretation of an ancient myth, we may turn to Freud who, in a brilliant and bold stroke, amalgamated the theme of forgotten knowledge with that of for- bidden knowledge and its attendant forbidden pleasure. We forget pre- cisely what we forbid ourselves to remember, and we fall ill when we cannot utterly forget but cannot consciously remember. The repetition compulsion characteristic of all psychic illness and rooted in the repetitions of living matter comes into play by replacing memory. This symptom, like all symptoms basically, is a "mnemic symbol" hiding and substituting for a memory. The repetition compulsion is, from this point of view, a way of forgetting and remembering at the same time, a kind of unconscious re- membering which vanishes when consciousness extends its domain to comprehend the repressed. What we forget, in this view of psychic conflict, are finally the intense pleasures of an archaic past which acculturation in the form of the super-</page><page sequence="13">Fallen Man 59 ego forbids. The Eden of the mind is really the pleasure ego of the poly- morphous perverse infant from which civilization, diffracted through his educators and introjected as self, expels him. The Biblical Eden, we may recall, was both a proper name and the Hebrew word for "pleasure" or "delight," as the Vulgate and Septuagint translations emphasize, and what I have called the Freudian myth of Fall joins the archetypal story most strongly at this point. Culture renders our original state of innocent and intense pleasure forbidden, and thus too painful to remember, but appro- priately censored, we may be free to yearn nostalgically for that forbidden pleasure in its disguised symbolic derivative as the Biblical Eden.8 It is the super-ego which creates the "dark horse" of the soul by its judgment of the libidinal energies of the psyche and creates the "white horse" too in its demand for the repudiation of those darker powers, while the rational charioteer must steer his way between the tempestuous forces of the id and the demands of the super-ego. It is not my intention, nor do I have the skill, to enter into a detailed psychoanalytical interpretation of the myth of fallen man. It is, of course, obvious that the themes of innocence, disobedience, rebellion, punish- ment, shame, guilt, sexual differentiation, temptation, the in-breathing of life, can readily be referred to the desires, conflicts and resolution of the Oedipus Complex. Indeed, the tradition of both Jewish and Christian exegesis of the Genesis story offers examples of sexual interpretations of the temptation of Eve.9 Of course, we quite consciously use the figure of a "fall" to signify death or a lapse into immoral behavior. We refer to those who have fallen in battle, the Biblical prophets predict the fall of tyrants and a more reticent age than our own regularly referred to prostitutes as fallen women.10 Interestingly enough, Genesis does not use the term "fall" in its account and the term first appears in this context in the Apocryphal Gos- pel of Wisdom to refer to Adam's disobedience. The usage was firmly established in tradition by St. Paul who, in Romans 5, also used it in ref- erence to Adam. To pass from psychoanalytical interpretation of the Fall to other inter- pretations is to pass to the "teleology" of meaning from its "archeology."11 We can readily refer the Fall to the passage we all must make from the wishes and conflicts of childhood when we are, so to speak, governed by the pleasure principle, to the disenchanted state of yielding to the gov- ernance of the reality principle. We may also, in philosophical terms, think of the Fall as describing the passage from "essence to existence," as a fall from a state of pure potentiality for existence into its actuality, into</page><page sequence="14">60 M a z z E o Journal awareness of choices and all the difficulties and ambiguities of making them. Kierkegaard in his Concept of Dread, Rheinhold Niebuhr in his The Nature and Destiny of Man, Paul Tillich in his Systematic Theology, all interpret the Fall as a myth of universal significance which illuminates the problems of freedom and obedience, responsibility and guilt, desire and shame, choice and anxiety, harmony and dislocation. The modality of mythic narrative in which the story of the Fall is told, permits these and other interpreters to preserve the paradoxical relations which these great themes bear to one another. The fall from nature to culture, from the im- mediacy of innocence to the guilt of experience, from instinct to possibility and its accompanying anxiety, are structures of existence which present a double judgment. St. Augustine and the theologians who followed him were correct when they advanced the doctrine of the felix culpa, the "for- tunate fall" even in totally secular terms. For them, it was a "fortunate fall" which could bring into the world so wonderful a means of redemp- tion. For us, since the human condition is a "fallen" one, both the great- ness as well as the misery of the human enterprise derive from that con- dition. Foremost among the thinkers of our time, Heidegger makes the cate- gory of "fallenness" central to his analysis of existence. In a brilliant re- versal of one meaning of the traditional story of the Fall, Heidegger inter- prets our "fall" as one into forgetfulness of death and into "curiosity," "idle talk" and "ambiguity." Authentic existence, "redemption" in his view of life, can only be achieved in the light of our awareness that human being, Dasein, is "being-towards-death."12 For the Christian imagination, the story of the "first Adam" or first man was intimately related to the story of the second Adam, to the re- demption of mankind and the victory of suffering over death. Within both Judaism and Christianity, the Fall was associated with Messianic expec- tations for it defined the problem from which only God or his agent could deliver us. The Christian, of course, believed that he lived in the fullness of time and at the beginning of eschatological fulfillment, and could hope for the consummation of God's promise. The lineaments of a philosophy of history are clearly present in this view of God's plan, but that view of history is sustained entirely by hope. While Heidegger adopts, in secu- larized form, essential features of the view of man as fallen, hope in the Christian sense cannot be secularized and is replaced by "care." Man, Dasein, is oriented toward the future quite as much as the faith- ful Christian, but this orientation in Dasein is essentially manifested as</page><page sequence="15">Fallen Man 61 being constantly and "care-fully" concerned about existence in the world. Fallen man lives entirely in terms of this Vor-struktur. Authentic exis- tence, Heidegger's version of redemption, can have no higher meaning that the measurement of life by the inevitability of death, than the coura- geous resolution to look forward to the end of Dasein. Without an escha- tology, "dread" or radical anxiety replaces hope. Heidegger accepts to the full the consequences of the secularization of the world and the death of the idea of progress. Clearly, Heidegger's mentor in this was the Kierkegaard of the Concept of Dread. Fallen man lives in dread and not hope, for with the fall conies the awareness of freedom and possibility together with the certain knowledge of death and finitude. Ignorant innocence may be blissful but only in a very ambiguous way. The idea of progress which dominated the thinking of Western man from the seventeenth century until recent times, oriented man hopefully toward the future and so possessed some of the essential features of a religion of redemption. The religion of progress, as Ronald Knox ob- served, was the reverse of the Chinese practice of ancestor worship. While the Chinese worshipped their forebears, adherents of the idea of progress worshipped their yet unborn descendants. Their lives, if not our own, would become progressively freer of many of the evils which have beset the human race. The central dogma of this belief in progress was that there existed a kind of knowledge, scientific knowledge, which would re- store the dominion of nature that God had given man and which he lost through the Fall. He could look forward to a time when mankind would not have to earn its daily bread in crushing toil and when the pains and dangers of childbirth would be mitigated if not eliminated. That such blessings have been achieved by a substantial minority of the human race is undeniable, but in religious terms they are the minority of the elect while the majority of mankind still must be numbered among the reprobate. Wars, old age, illness and the inevitable disappointments which afflict the disinherited, have irremediably destroyed any universal and easy belief in the inevitability of progress. Death, the last enemy, still claims the final victory. Both Christianity and the Idea of Progress oriented man towards a hopeful future, but what remains of their legacy, we may perceive as our temporal orientation toward the future but minus the hope they gen- erated. The imagination of modern man thus grasps endless possibilities but simultaneously lives with the expectation of endless disappointments and ultimate extinction. The author of Civilization and its Discontents did</page><page sequence="16">62 m a z z e o Journal not arrive at conclusions very different from these, even though he did not set himself deliberately to interpret the Fall. In a way, the Fall may be regarded as still both myth and history, since myth and history may serve equivalent purposes. It has been observed that some men flee from what Hegel called "the butcher's block of his- tory" into a mythical world while others, oppressed by their myths, seek to find solace in history as the realm of "what really happened." The story of the fall lends itself legitimately to richness of overlapping interpretations not simply because of the universality of the themes and symbols it presents, nor simply because of the "strange" lacunae and "omissions" in the narrative which defeat normal, modern expectations concerning the psychological truth of narrative. While the story is not true history in any modern sense of the term, and it resists consistent con- ceptual analysis, it is nevertheless presented as historical narrative, as a sequence of happenings, and is therefore subject to the same interpretive problems and latitude as an historical narrative. We are dealing with an "event," even if not an event which literally transpired. Man was intended to be one thing and then something happened, events took place which turned him into something else and endowed him with the tragic aware- ness that he is not what he was intended to be.13 If the archeology of the idea of fallen man takes us to the infantile and archaic stratum of meaning, its final teleology was a theology of history and, in secularized form, several philosophies of history including, in some essential respects, the idea of progress. The myth of the Fall presents us in nuce with several historiographical concepts of the first importance for if man had not fallen out with his Creator there would have been no his- tory at all! Moreover, his "fallen" condition leads him to act blindly in the historical arena so that a gulf opens up over and over again between his conscious intention in action and the result of that action. Only the intervention of Providence can and does lead the historical process to a desirable outcome, in spite of human sinfulness. The Christian hope rests on the divine promise that mankind is travelling to its divinely appointed goal in spite of and not because of the actions of men and states. In less theological and mythical terms, the historical pattern implied through the symbolism of the Fall is one in which, to use the phrase of Bernard Bosanquet, history reveals "a teleology above the level of finite consciousness." With this view of the historical process a new kind of historical irony is disclosed based on the paradoxical interplay of the per- sonal intention of the agent of action acting according to his reason and the frequently unintended result which is nevertheless also "rational."</page><page sequence="17">Fallen Man 63 Hegel's "cunning of Reason" is quite simply the secularization of the old religious belief that sinful man proposes and a beneficent God disposes. For Thucydides and Polybius a blind fortune frequently disposed of the intentions of men leaving nothing but ruin in her path. Our alternative has been to view history as providential or dialectical. Something of the high- est importance is conserved and the historical process has a linear direc- tion. The myth of the Fall also implies a truly universal conception of his- tory, for history begins with the fate of the ancestors of the human race. God's promise, variously given, orients mankind toward a future ex- pectation and subtracts us from oppressive weight of eternal recurrences and endless cycles.

Many complexities in the interpretation of the story of the Fall stem from the fact that Genesis Mil is the conflation of two sources, P or the Priestly source and J or the Jahwist source. While we have in these chapters two accounts of the creation of man and two quite different conceptions of the Deity, we have only one story of the Fall, that of the Jahwist who is far more imaginative and anthropomorphic in his conception of God than the Priestly narrator.

Unconsciously, it would appear that fears of falling from a high place symbolize feminine masochistic wishes and related castration fears. Insofar as such fears concern a fear of being killed they are related to punishment for the wish to kill. The sensation of falling, like that of flying, represents sexual excitement which carries with it its own punishment, an excitement per- ceived in the unconscious as painful and dangerous. Where conscious thought separates temptation from its ensuing punishment, unconscious processes make them simultaneous. The common expression of "falling" in love has some such reference to unconscious ideas of forbidden pleasure.

Cf. the acute remarks of Karl Lowith, op. cit. note 4 on p. 244: "It would be worthwhile to re-examine, together with the religious function of imagination, the methodical relevance of allegorical interpretation which has been used since the earliest times. It is remarkable that the most critical of all modern church historians, F. Overbeck, came to the startling conclusion that the allegorical interpretation of Scripture "is theology itself" (Christentum undKultur, Basel, 1919, pp. 90ff.). The necessity of allegorical interpretation, in the widest sense, depends ultimately on the fact that the basis of the Chris- tian doctrine and of the church is a historical document which has to be "in- terpreted" spiritually in order to prove its truth. Substituting for history and truth the more fashionable distinction between facts and values does not solve the problem of their relations. It only dissolves definite scriptural meanings into indefinite "spiritual values" which may be found anywhere." The term "allegorical" is often ambiguously used. In some extended meaning of the term, Overbeck, I believe, is correct. The reader should, however, compare the critical remarks on allegory of Rudolf Bultmann, "Is Exegesis Without Presuppositions Possible?", in Existence and Faith: Shorter Writings of Rudolf Bultmann, trans. S. M. Ogden, New York, 1960, pp. 342ff.</page></plain_text>
