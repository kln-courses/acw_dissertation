<plain_text><page sequence="1">CHUANG TZU'S BECOMING-ANIMAL Irving Goh Department of Comparative Literature, Cornell University Hui Tzu said to ChuangTzu, "... Your words ... are too big and useless, and so everyone alike spurns them!" ChuangTzu said, "Maybe you've never seen a wildcat or a weasel. It crouches down and hides, watching for something to come along. It leaps and races east and west, not hesitating to go high or low—until it falls into the trap and dies in the net. Then again there's the yak, big as a cloud covering the sky. It certainly knows how to be big, though it doesn't know how to catch rats.'" The Way, or Animal Philosophy One could perhaps understand, if not empathize with, Hui Tzu's impatience in the dialogue above. Hui Tzu, after all, is not alone in finding Chuang Tzu's philosophy, which would be the thinking of the Way, somewhat too enigmatic for comprehen sion. In the Chuang Tzu, there will be others, albeit more patient and reverent than Hui Tzu here, who will likewise seek an explication of ChuangTzu's thoughts on the Way, but the response they will receive is always one of a claimed "clarity," that is to say, a response bearing a "clarity" that only renders any explication of the Way still enigmatic if not more obscure. An example of such explication would go as follows: "Heaven and earth are one attribute; the ten thousand things are one horse" (p. 40).2 In other words, contrary to what human understanding is accustomed to and what it demands, the force of "clarity" with regard to explicating the Way according to ChuangTzu will not provide any logical exegesis, nor lay things out in a clear and linear manner. At the end of any such explication, one is often left with the impres sion that that one is yet further removed from any comprehension of the Way. Taking into consideration that supplementary rhetoric only creates a further impasse with regard to thinking about the Way, one can indeed understand Hui Tzu's frustration. And yet, in defense of ChuangTzu, I believe that a clue toward thinking the Way has actually been given in the same dialogue. As I would read it, ChuangTzu here is suggesting that the animal points the way toward thinking the Way. Chuang Tzu's explication with "clarity" quoted earlier would also seem to support this hypothesis: if the Way is that wherein ten thousand things are one, and if the ten thousand things "are one horse," can one not say that the Way is a thinking of the animal? If Hui Tzu fails to catch this hint in the dialogue, it is reasonable to say that the fault lies in his anthropomorphic or anthropocentric cognitive horizon. Let me elaborate this by re staging Hui Tzu's criticism of ChuangTzu's rhetoric. ChuangTzu's words bespeak of the Way, and Hui Tzu does not dispute that. But Hui Tzu's problem is that Chuang Tzu's words are "too big and useless," that is, Chuang Tzu's rhetoric resonates at a level unreachable by human understanding, or at a level beyond the limits of the lat ter, such that ChuangTzu's discourse on the Way completely eludes human under 110 Philosophy East &amp; West Volume 61, Number 1 January 2011 110-133 © 2011 by University of Hawai'i Press</page><page sequence="2">standing. However, it is also possible to perceive the apparent impasse here as emerging precisely from Hui Tzu's insistence on bringing Chuang Tzu's rhetoric (down) to the linguistic medium of human understanding. In doing so, he fails to see what Chuang Tzu's words have become. Yet Chuang Tzu in this dialogue is in fact patient to elucidate clearly—in the most quotidian sense according to conventional human understanding—what his words have become: if his words are "too big and useless" in speaking of the Way, they are so only because they are following the yak, or, as the text suggests, they have already become the yak, which is immense in size but useless in catching rats. In other words, in speaking of the Way, words have taken on an animal contour. Hui Tzu, however, in his anthropomorphic or anthropocentric perspective, which seeks to reduce everything to the means and ends of human understanding, remains inept in seeing this animal contour. According to Chuang Tzu, then, if one desires to seek a passage to the Way via his words, or, simply, if one is to speak of the Way, one cannot do so by restricting the Way within the limits of human words in the service of human understanding. In stead, one is to look to the animal, to the horse, or to the yak in the case of the dia logue between Hui Tzu and ChuangTzu. One could therefore argue, as I would like to do in this essay, that for Chuang Tzu, thinking the Way concerns following or thinking the animal. Or, to put it another way, the thought of Chuang Tzu traces an animal philosophy. By animal philosophy or thinking the animal, I do not mean a mode of thought that claims to know or understand the animal by appropriating the animal as an object of analysis and subjecting it to a theoretical or ontological exer cise, a mode of thought that seeks only to increase the expanse and glory of human knowledge. Instead, what I would like to suggest here by the phrase animal philoso phy or thinking the animal is a simple or modest following of the animal. One does not and must not seek to reach toward anything; one is not seeking an organized totality of concepts, propositions, or arguments at the end of this following.3 In other words, one must not expect Chuang Tzu's animal philosophy to lead toward yet an other anthropomorphic philosophical discourse: in ChuangTzu, animal philosophy is just a pure and simple following of the animal. As is evident in my essay's title, I also believe that ChuangTzu's animal philoso phy shares a close proximity with Deleuze and Guattari's becoming-animal, a con cept they develop especially in Kafka: Toward a Minor Literature and a Thousand Plateaus.4 I will soon explicate their concept of becoming-animal, but allow me to say here briefly that, like ChuangTzu, Deleuze and Guattari articulate a desire for thought to pass through the animal. This desire stems from a similar distaste Chuang Tzu has (as I will also elucidate in the course of this essay) for all the limits imposed upon human thought, limits that Deleuze and Guattari in A Thousand Plateaus see emanating not only from anthropomorphic or anthropocentric ideas but also from structures like institutions and the State. Deleuze and Guattari perceive that the human condition is either preoccupied with or captured by such limits, and hence they will share with ChuangTzu a certain disregard for things human, henceforth leading them also to turn their gaze to the animal for the future of thought. In this essay, I will suggest that Deleuze and Guattari's concept of becoming-animal can Irving Coh 111</page><page sequence="3">help elucidate Chuang Tzu's following of the animal.5 By doing so, I am not at all suggesting that an animal philosophy in ChuangTzu is read only retrospectively after Deleuze and Guattari. One must not forget that Chuang Tzu's philosophy comes some two thousand years before Deleuze and Guattari's. From this perspective, it is even imperative perhaps to state here that Chuang Tzu's animal philosophy predates and prefigures Deleuze and Guattari's becoming-animal. I would even dare say that the concept of becoming-animal is already nascent in ChuangTzu. If I should be deploying the philosophical rhetoric of Deleuze and Guattari here to speak of ChuangTzu's philosophy, it is only because I believe that the former can help elicit and underscore the animal trajectory in the Chuang Tzu. I would also like to point out here that the comparison between ChuangTzu and Deleuze and Guat tari does not stop at the meditation on philosophy's future trajectories. As the later part of my essay will argue, following the animal in both ChuangTzu and in Deleuze and Guattari takes on a political dimension; but, as I will demonstrate, it is political only because it seeks to escape politics. The Dream of Becoming-Animal How can one speak of ChuangTzu's following the animal in relation to Deleuze and Guattari's becoming-animal? I suggest that one can do this with the final passage of the chapter "Discussion on Making All Things Equal," that is, the famous butterfly dream passage. This passage has certainly been much written about, but most Chuang Tzu scholarship would tend to jump quickly to determine the meaning of the dream, and hence overlook what is happening in the passage, overlooking therefore the force of the animal there. What is happening in the passage, I would argue, is an event of becoming-animal, an event that is also accompanied by a departure from human subjectivity. I propose, then, to reread this passage here in order to fore ground these aspects. I quote the passage from the text: Once Chuang Chou dreamt he was a butterfly, a butterfly flitting and fluttering around, happy with himself and doing as he pleased. He didn't know he was Chuang Chou. Sud denly he woke up and there he was, solid and unmistakable Chuang Chou. But he didn't know if he was Chuang Chou who had dreamt he was a butterfly, or a butterfly dreaming he was Chuang Chou. Between Chuang Chou and a butterfly there must be some distinc tion! This is called the Transformation of Things, (p. 49) As is often noted, this is not an ordinary dream; it resists all conventional understand ings of a dream. One does not awake from this dream to recover one's sense of sub jective consciousness. To be precise, human subjective consciousness is unhinged here. This is because, in the aftermath of this dream, the great uncertainty that re mains is not the inability to distinguish between reality and illusion, as how one sometimes feels after a dream, but the anthropomorphic anxiety of no longer know ing who or what one is. Awakened, there is no telling if one is the human who had dreamt of being a butterfly, or if one is in fact the butterfly dreaming it was Chuang Chou, which would only mean that one's current human form is but the continuation of an animal's dream. 112 Philosophy East &amp; West</page><page sequence="4">Something has happened between Chuang Chou and the butterfly in the event of this dream. Before speaking of this dream in terms of becoming-animal, one could first say that something of an "affect" has transpired between Chuang Chou and the butterfly. "Affect," after Deleuze and Guattari, may be considered to be a sensing of the animal, and how its presence brings about radical changes within our human bodily constitutions. In the words of Deleuze and Guattari: [T]he affect is not a personal feeling, nor is it a characteristic; it is the effectuation of a power of the pack that throws the self into upheaval and make[s] it reel. Who has not known the violence of these animal sequences, which uproot one from humanity, if only for an instant, making one scrape at one's bread like a rodent or giving one the yellow eyes of a feline? A fearsome involution calling us towards unheard of becomings.6 I believe that Deleuze and Guattari's "affect" strongly echoes the "transformation" that occurs between Chuang Chou and the butterfly. Certainly, there is no "effectua tion of a power of [an animal] pack" in this dream sequence in the Chuang Tzu. In fact, the Chuang Tzu in general does not concern itself with the pack in its animal question. The animals that ChuangTzu is interested in are generally solitary animals. But these solitary animals, like the butterfly in this dream sequence, have enough force that it "throws the [human] self into upheaval and make[s] it reel," enough "af fect" to "uproot one from humanity." It is indeed with the butterfly, in the event of the dream, that Chuang Chou's human subjective certainty and agency is thrown into doubt: "he didn't know if he was Chuang Chou who had dreamt he was a butterfly, or a butterfly dreaming he was Chuang Chou."7 If he doubts the certitude of himself as the human agent of the dream, he also doubts if he is even human after the dream, feeling himself to be equally an animal or a butterfly now. It is here that one could perhaps begin to speak of a becoming-animal in ChuangTzu, for an "affect" between Chuang Chou and the butterfly has certainly summoned forth a "fearsome involution" of "unheard of becomings": a becoming-butterfly of Chuang Chou, or a becoming Chuang Chou of the butterfly, or both.8 The proximity between ChuangTzu's "transformation" (involving the human and the butterfly) and Deleuze and Guattari's becoming-animal becomes clearer with Deleuze and Guattari's explication of the concept of becoming-animal. According to Deleuze and Guattari: [Becoming-animal] is a composition of speed and affects involving entirely different indi viduals, a symbiosis; it makes the [animal] become a thought, a feverish thought in man, at the same time as the man becomes a[n] [animal] gnashing its teeth in its death throes. The [animal] and man are in no way the same thing, but Being expresses them both in a single meaning in a language that is no longer that of words, in a matter that is no longer that of forms, in an affectability that is no longer that of subjects.9 Just as there is no animal pack in the Chuang Tzu, neither will there be the violent image of the human "gnashing its teeth in its death throes" in both the dream se quence and in other animal passages in the Chuang Tzu. As rather evident in the dream sequence, if there is a becoming-animal in ChuangTzu, it occurs instead as a Irving Goh 113</page><page sequence="5">relatively tranquil state of affairs. But if becoming-animal for Deleuze and Guattari is a question of the animal becoming a thought, becoming "a feverish thought in man," then surely Chuang Chou's reeling over himself whether he is not in fact a butterfly dreaming at present corresponds to such a "feverish thought." Further, becoming animal's "affectability that is no longer that of subjects" is also surely an echo of Chuang Chou's loss of subjectivity during the dream and his lack of certitude of any human subjectivity in the aftermath of the dream, both of which I have noted above. And if becoming-animal takes place "in a single meaning in a language that is no longer that of words," one notes that the "transformation" between Chuang Chou and the butterfly occurs in a dream, that is to say, in a sequence without words. No word is spoken or exchanged during the dream after all. It should also be noted that for Deleuze and Guattari, becoming-animal is not about one entity (the human) inserting itself into another (the animal) such that a new singular entity arises at the cost of the previous two. Instead, the initial two entities remain, except that they have each become something else in their own respective ways by virtue of the encounter with each other. And that is why Deleuze and Guat tari will say that in becoming-animal, the animal and the human "are in no way the same thing." In an uncanny parallel, ChuangTzu's "transformation" will also under score that even though Chuang Chou's sense of being now glides between the human and the animal, "between Chuang Chou and a butterfly there must be some distinc tion!" Comparing Chuang Chou's dream and "transformation" with Deleuze and Guat tari's "affect" and "becoming," one can even proceed to rethink the text of the Chuang Tzu itself in terms of becoming-animal. Before doing that, I would like to make one last comment on the dream sequence. Again, this butterfly-dream passage is from the chapter "Discussion on Making All Things Equal," a chapter that begins with the inquiry into understanding the Way. By closing the inquiry with the butterfly dream passage, I would argue that the Chuang Tzu here gestures toward the suggestion that following the animal or becoming-animal provides a way to such an understand ing. It should be noted, too, that this path toward the Way is not limited to humans, nor is it unidirectional (in the sense of always being only a question of the human becoming animal). As Chuang Tzu suggests in this dream sequence and elsewhere in the Chuang Tzu, the path is also open to the animal, even if the path is a becoming human for the butterfly. The path is open to all, and the question, then, is whether one is prepared to pursue it in its animal trajectory.10 Animal Beginnings If one could agree that Chuang Tzu's thinking of the animal is akin to Deleuze and Guattari's becoming-animal as I have tried to demonstrate in the previous section, I would now like to propose a rereading of the Chuang Tzu, this time recognizing the immediate force and trajectory of the animal right from the start. After all, the Chuang Tzu opens with the animal, or, to be more precise, it opens with a becoming-animal of the animal. This is the beginning of the Chuang Tzu: 114 Philosophy East &amp; West</page><page sequence="6">In the dark abyss of the northern waters, there is a fish, and its name is k'un. K'un is so huge there is no knowing how many thousand miles it measures. It changes and becomes a bird, and its name is p'eng. There is no knowing how many thousand miles its back spans. It takes flight and its wings are like the clouds that spread across the sky. As this bird, the waters begin to move toward the south, there where the waters are known as the Lake of Heaven. As in the case of the butterfly passage, it is interesting to note how some translators do not recognize the full force of the animal in this opening passage of the Chuang Tzu. I use Burton Watson's translation of the Chuang Tzu in general for this essay, but I have chosen to use my own for this particular passage. That is because Watson in troduces the "I" of a human subject here. I find this insertion somewhat misplaced, if not inappropriate, since this human "I" is not to be found in the original text. In the original, the human subject is absent in the opening of the Chuang Tzu. With this in mind, one could even say that right at the beginning, the ChuangTzu does away with the human subject, as if ChuangTzu has already denounced the human subject, who is incapable of grasping the boundless events of life or the boundlessness of life that this passage is concerned with. With regard to the original text, one could say that the beginning of the Chuang Tzu is a scene of the animal. Introducing the "I" of the human subject here only expropriates the scene proper to the animal away from the animal. In other words, the insertion of a human perspective, standing in awe before something that is boundless and of which the subject has no understanding, only to utter, "K'un is so huge I don't know how many thousand li he measures" (p. 29; my emphasis), as Watson translates the passage, is but a violent supplement. The original text, to reiterate, has no place for the absurd human enunciation of "I don't know."11 One has to recognize the autonomous force of the animal here instead, which is the potentiality of becoming within the world of the animal itself, a power lodged within the animal itself and which the animal enacts without any need for human presence. As announced in the text, k'un is a fish. But it is not simply a fish in the sense of a passive state of being. Instead, it is a fish actively engaged in a process of becoming. Watson has observed in his footnote to k'un that k'un can also mean roe, the smallest unit of a fish's life, the egg-life of a fish that is not yet a fish.12 Yet this minimal existence is already becoming-fish in the opening scene of the ChuangTzu, not just a normal fish but one that is of a measureless dimension. In other words, one can say that the smal lest un it of k'un al ready has with i n it the potential ity of becoming boundless, or it is already becoming-boundless. One can also say further that k'un is a force of becoming itself, for a chain of becomings follows after it: from a roe be coming a huge fish, k'un becomes a giant bird, which then becomes the clouds, and subsequently becomes the waters that "begin to move toward the south." One should note that the animal becomings here have no plan: the animal in ChuangTzu's animal philosophy follows no plan.13 If k'un is able to become bound less, it seems that this is because its becoming is not programmatic. Nowhere in the original text will one find any indication of a plan or blueprint of this becoming: k'un just becomes. This is reaffirmed by the flight of p'eng. P'eng may be heading toward the southern regions of the world, but definitions of directions like "north," "south," Irving Coh 115</page><page sequence="7">"east," and "west" are but according to the scope of conventional human vision.14 If one disregards such human categorization of directions, one would find that there is clearly no indication of a preplanned flight itinerary in p'eng itself. Like k'un, when p'eng becomes-sky or becomes-waters, it does not set these becomings as premedi tated objectives. K'un and p'eng just become, without thought—if thought is to be understood as the conscious human activity that preconditions any event, or as that which brings before the event conventions, norms, or expectations, so as to deter mine how the event will be received or executed. There is no such event-killing methodology in the becomings of k'un and p'eng. For ChuangTzu, one should not pursue any understanding of these becomings if one is intent only on understanding becoming by referring it to a past event, or by framing it within the cognitive horizons of existing modes of human understanding. Becoming is without human speculative knowledge. The experience of human life and human knowledge will always remain inadequate to the boundless (future) events of becoming. As ChuangTzu warns, too, "Your life has a limit but knowledge has more. If you use what is limited to pursue what has no limit, you will be in danger" (p. 50). In the opening passage of the Chuang Tzu, then, it seems that it is only with the animal that one approaches limit less knowledge. It is a question of simply following the animal, rather than delimiting the events of life's becomings within the boundaries of human knowledge or human understanding. Becoming also makes no a priori judgment or calculation as to its success or failure. It takes its chances in life, allowing the events of life to arrive with their com plete surprises, and receiving them without selection. In other words, it experiments with the unthought or the unthinkable. As such, it is also indifferent to all other knowledge that lies at its periphery and which passes judgment on becoming's ap parent radicality if not irrationality. The Chuang Tzu certainly does not deny or re press the prevalent existence of such judgmental rationality, but it will show that becoming or the becoming-animal of the animal is untouched by such voices. In the scene of the becomings of k'un and p'eng, there are also other animals at the side. There are the cicada, the little dove, and the little quail, and they bring to the becom ings of k'un and p'eng what they already know, that is to say, knowledge that has always defined and determined their passages through life. As such, they represent the faithlessness in doing things not done before and in venturing into unexplored or unthought-of places. And so they judge as incredulous or impossible the becoming flight of ninety thousand miles of p'eng, because the little quail can "never get more than ten or twelve yards before [it] comets] down fluttering among the weeds and brambles" (p. 31); and just because the cicada and the little dove can only "get as far as the elm or the sapanwood tree" (p. 29), these same animals dismiss the thought that p'eng, which is of immense dimension, is able to take flight at all. The knowledge that these little animals have of the world and their vision of what can be done in it are conditioned only by their own limited knowledge and capa bilities. They close themselves off from a wholly other knowledge or event that is beyond their cognitive and experiential horizons. And so ChuangTzu will denounce these delimited ways of thinking (which is uncannily similar to human thought) as 116 Philosophy East &amp; West</page><page sequence="8">"little understanding" (p. 30). "Little understanding" is the knowledge that trivializes, or that which has been trivialized by the limits of previous experiences. K'un and p'engwill remain indifferent to such a judgmental "little understanding," as they pass by it without passing judgment on it. At this point, an interesting note on the presence of these little animals can also be made with regard to ChuangTzu's animal philoso phy. It serves in fact to demonstrate that there is no naive idealization of animals in the Chuang Tzu. In other words, if there is a following of the animal in the Chuang Tzu, Chuang Tzu follows certain animals. So far, we have seen that he would seek to follow the yak, the horse, the butterfly, k'un, and p'eng, but not the cicada, the little dove, or the little quail. Toward a Disavowal of Politics ChuangTzu, now—at this very moment he is treading the Yellow Springs or leaping up to the vast blue. To him there is no north or south—in utter freedom he dissolves himself in the four directions and drowns himself in the unfathomable. To him, there is no east or west—he begins in the Dark Obscurity and returns to the Great Thoroughfare, (p. 187) It is with the little animals of "little understanding" that one can raise the question of politics in relation to following the animal or becoming-animal in the Chuang Tzu. So far, with k'un and p'eng, one could say that becoming proceeds without politics, since, to reiterate, they just become. But politics is already lurking at the sides, and it emerges with these little animals. There is no doubt that a certain link exists between them and politics, for it is following their entrances into the scene of becoming that it will be inscribed that the "man who has wisdom enough to fill one office effec tively, good conduct to impress one community, virtue enough to please one ruler, or talent enough to be called into service in one state, has the same kind of self-pride as these little creatures" (p. 31). Here, governmental institutions, political office, and the politically minded are obviously disdained. But one should note that it is not only the "self-pride" of the efficient and pandering bureaucrat or man of political office that is critiqued here; a politics that imposes limits is a subject of criticism here, too. If there is a politics related to the little animals, it implies one that seeks to control and limit what can be done, judging things from these little animals' own perspectives and delimiting not only themselves but others, too, from the boundlessness or the sur prise of life events. If politics is the imposing of limits, then philosophy, according to ChuangTzu, has nothing, or wants nothing, to do with it. As I will show in the fol lowing, becoming-animal in the Chuang Tzu, which knows no limits, has no toler ance for any politics of limits, and Chuang Tzu will seek to detach philosophy from such politics, if not even from politics in general. It is not difficult to understand this desire to detach oneself from politics, given the state of politics that one has encountered in our own times.15 After Aristotle's Politics, we have been living as "political animals," and as "political animals" who are capable of rational discourse, we have only learned to organize our lives within civilized spaces like the polis, the city, or the nation, such that our daily human lives are not only a function of the political economy of these spaces and of those who Irving Goh 117</page><page sequence="9">govern them, but also such that our lives are ordered or managed under certain laws or jurisdictions. As "political animals," we must live life only to ensure the order and the perpetuity of the political economy of the space that we have so far gathered ourselves within. In other words, the organization of life under the appellation "po litical animal" has only been the transformation of human lives into politics (and Foucault will identify this as the insidious system of bio-politics.) The weight and to tality of life as politics surely can be felt in the early part of the twenty-first century, when we, world citizens of a global (American) democracy, have been called to de fend our political commitment and responsibility to democracy by sourcing out en emies of this democracy among us and among foreigners, and by being complicit in advocating a global war on terror of controversial means and of interminable end. This has been the undeniable political life experience of the contemporary human "political animal," a political life that has seemed almost impossible to exit from. For such times, and for ChuangTzu's, the animal, however, remains a privileged being that has no part in politics, or is left out of politics, since it is without human rational language and therefore never a "political animal." One could say that the animal is the disappeared in politics, or that which always had what Blanchot called "the right to disappear" from totalizing politics.16 It is not surprising, then, that in the quest to escape the capture of life by politics, to reclaim life as it is without the de mands and limits imposed by politics, there will be philosophical personages in the Chuang Tzu who will seek to follow the animal, or become-animal, so as to disap pear from politics. Most of these becoming-animal gestures will in fact follow the becomings of k'un or p'eng, which, as seen already, take leave of the politics of the other little animals and disappear into unknown and unknowable territories. This is certainly the case of ChuangTzu himself, too, as is evident in the epigraph that heads this section of this essay. And just to cite two more examples, there is, in chapter 12, the "true sage [who] is a quail [and therefore another instance of becoming-animal] at rest, a little fledgling at its meal, a bird in flight who leaves no trail behind . . . riding on those white clouds" (p. 130); and then, in chapter 14, Confucius describes the philosopher LaoTzu as "a dragon that coils to sow its body at its best, that sprawls out to display his patterns at their best, riding on the breath of the clouds" (p. 163). Like ChuangTzu, Deleuze and Guattari's becoming-animal would also disdain political office and trace a trajectory of escape from politics. As they write in their book on Kafka, "To the inhumanness of [politics], there is the answer of a becoming animal: to become a beetle, to become a dog, to become an ape, 'head over heels and run away,' rather than lowering one's head and remaining a bureaucrat, inspec tor, judge, or judged."17 And if following k'un and p'eng is, for Chuang Tzu, to dis appear (from politics), Deleuze and Guattari in A Thousand Plateaus would say somewhat similarly that becoming-animal looks toward a "becoming-imperceptible." With regard to becoming, Deleuze and Guattari would seek a line that goes from the visible realm to the miniscule or even invisible dimension. One should note that this need to become-imperceptible or negate presence in order to escape the capture of politics is, however, not as strong or urgent in ChuangTzu. For ChuangTzu, to disap pear does not necessarily call for a becoming-imperceptible of oneself. One is again 118 Philosophy East &amp; West</page><page sequence="10">reminded here of the yak reference. The yak is certainly not of miniscule dimension. Instead, it is in full presence to all, "big as a cloud covering the sky" and "certainly knows how to be big." Yet it is able to elude animal traps, as if imperceptible to them, and remain alive.18 ChuangTzu, therefore, is not as insistent as Deleuze and Guattari on negating presence with regard to becoming-animal or to becoming-animal's escape from pol itics. To escape from politics, the term that ChuangTzu prefers is forgetting. And just as disappearing is difficult for Deleuze and Guattari—they will acknowledge that "to go unnoticed is by no means easy"19—so is forgetting, according to ChuangTzu. It is not easy for one to forget about politics, and neither is it easy for politics to forget oneself. According to the Chuang Tzu, "to forget the whole world is hard." But one will get there. And yet once that is achieved, there is the next difficulty: "To forget the whole world is easy; to make the whole world forget you is hard" (p. 155). One must nevertheless not abandon the task of making the world forget oneself. So there will be effort after effort in the Chuang Tzu to disavow politics in order for oneself to be forgotten by the world. There will be the thinker Hsu Yu who will tell the emperor Yao "I have no use for the rulership of the world" (p. 33) when Yao wants to cede the empire to Hsu Yu. Hsu Yu refuses the place or space of politics, understanding that there will be many who will desire it, and governmentality therefore will never be lacking in the political animal. There will also be the ugly man Ai T'ai-t'o, who shares Hsu Yu's gesture. Duke Ai of Lu "wanted to hand the government over to him," but he "left . . . and went away" (p. 73). To make the world forget oneself, to disappear from politics in other words, is but to maintain and secure life as it is in its simplicity, free(d) from the capture or delimitations of politics. This is ChuangTzu's point when he tells the officials who have come to deliver the king of Ch'u's invitation to Chuang Tzu to administer the state that he would rather be the tortoise "alive and dragging its tail in the mud" than the "sacred tortoise" that the king of Ch'u "keeps... wrapped in cloth and boxed, and stores ... in the ancestral temple" but "has been dead for three thousand years" (p. 188). In place of Iife-striating politics, ChuangTzu would rather become-tortoise, or become-k'un and p'eng, in order to live out a life without limits. In this disavowal of politics, one must not be naive enough to think that an apo litical state is in place. A disavowal of politics, in its resistance against state politics and its limits, remains undeniably political. Even Deleuze and Guattari's becoming animal, which aims to resist, escape, or become-imperceptible from the homogeniz ing apparatuses of political bureaucracy, has to acknowledge its irreducible political trajectory. As they say, "There is an entire politics of becoming-animal ... which is elaborated in assemblages that are neither those of the family nor of religion nor of the State."20The point, then, is that philosophy—animal philosophy in ChuangTzu, or becoming-animal in Deleuze and Guattari—must not partake of state politics. Politics, especially in the sense of governmentality, is not the business of philosophy. Philosophy must be indifferent to developments in such politics, just as k'un and p'eng are indifferent to the judgment of the little animals. Philosophy must let-be Irving Goh 119</page><page sequence="11">whatever happens in the realm of politics; it must not even seek to correct any pres ent political failing, even if the well-being of society is under threat by such a political fiasco.21 As it will be inscribed in the Chuang Tzu, "Though the age calls for reform, why should [the one who follows the Way] wear himself out over the affairs of the world?" (p. 33). For the one who follows the Way, affirming a life without limits is more critical than concerning oneself with politics. He or she is indifferent to what happens in the realm of politics, or to the personality of the political man taking charge of the country. He or she believes that each political regime, good or bad, has its own time of articulation or actualization, and that there is nothing to be done about it. When the time arrives for that regime to come to an end, there will be some thing that will bring forth that event; and it is nofthe task of philosophy to bring about that event. To reiterate, animal philosophy, like becoming-animal, remains irreducibly po litical even if it disavows politics. How, then, does one keep animal philosophy on track with its desire to escape from politics, and prevent it from regressing to some form of politics because of its irreducible political trajectory? I would argue that it is with "inaction" that Chuang Tzu provides a response to these two problems. "Inac tion," after all, is to be understood to be without political objectives. What it gestures toward instead is an indifference to politics, not tasking itself to rectify any political fault: in "inaction," one "just let[s] things be the way they are and doesn't try to help life along" (pp. 75-76). That this "inaction" of becoming-animal in the Chuang Tzu is only political in order to escape politics, and is essentially desirous of a life without politics, may be attested to by the fact that there is no clear political program or po litical philosophy that is outlined and called for in the entire text.22 One notes that "inaction" is never made a manifesto or political pedagogy for the masses. Chuang Tzu's animal philosophy understands that its ideal of life without politics is at odds with the real world, which constantly calls for the "political animal" and his wisdom in govern mentality.23 As such, "inaction" can be said to be really an individual pursuit, pertaining only to those who veritably seek the Way and are not distracted by quotidian affairs like politics. Would following the animal not offer a glimpse of this world of "inaction" or letting-be, of a world outside politics? For animals, there is the fact of existence of other animals and non-animals. There are the facts of death, of the hunt, of being a prey, of being domesticated, and today even of being cloned. But the animal none theless lets the world be as such and does not mobilize or organize itself with other animals into political factions whereby the events of the world can be rearranged according to their judgment. It does not engage in any ideological polemics that politicizes itself. Instead, it goes about life, like p'eng or k'un, or the yak, or the tor toise in the mud, indifferent to everything else that happens around it. Steps after the Animal, or Departures from the Human In following the animal, as in the Chuang Tzu, so as to gain passage to the Way or to escape politics, one has to keep in mind that it is also necessary to abandon any at 120 Philosophy East &amp; West</page><page sequence="12">tachment that threatens to draw one back to any thought of the human, that is, to anthropocentrism or anthropomorphism. The rejection of the very concept of the human will in a way be necessary to avoid appropriating the animal or the knowl edge of it within the limits of human knowledge and understanding. In ChuangTzu's terms, what has come to constitute the human has become the general act of delim iting another living thing (another person, a plant, an animal) within a determined domain where it will become an object of utility. Opposed to the human, then, ChuangTzu posits the notion of the Heavenly, which he associates (as he does with the Way) with the animal condition. And the animal condition is that in which ani mals simply exist, or in which they roam freely in nature and are safe from human exploitation. In the chapter "Autumn Floods," the critique of what is human is ex pressed as such: "Horses and oxen have four feet—this is what I mean by the Heav enly. Putting a halter on the horse's head, piercing the ox's nose—this is what I mean by the human. So I say: do not let what is human wipe out what is Heavenly" (p. 183). What is human, then, is but the reining in of what is quintessential^ free or Heavenly (e.g., animals as they are), and transforming the latter into Man's property (symbolized by the halter around the horse's head, or the nose-ring for the ox) and instruments of work. In place of the violent and insatiable human desire to turn everything into some thing useful for Man, ChuangTzu will also recall the notion of "inaction," which we have seen deployed in response to politics in the Chuang Tzu. Here, "inaction" is once again the paradoxical active letting-be of everything in the world, without the all-too-human will to control things according to one's desires. To this end, the Chuang Tzu would even call for the readiness to depart from one's human form. In the Chuang Tzu, it will be said, "You only have to rest in inaction and things will transform themselves. Smash your form and body.... Undo the mind, slough off spirit, be blank and soulless" (p. 122). I would argue that this smashing or unmanning of one's bodily form foreshadows Deleuze and Guattari's "body-without-organs" in A Thousand Plateaus. Deleuze and Guattari's "body-without-organs," like Chuang Tzu's "inaction," is a response to or critique of the human or anthropocentric com pulsion to organize everything around oneself. The "body-without-organs," then, is an image of thought that seeks to break down or break apart any form of thought that is constructed in the image of an anthropomorphic totality. In other words, it is an image of disorganized or disorganizing thought, like a body whose organs are with out proper organization and therefore cannot function as it is ordered to, an image of thought, therefore, that bespeaks a smashing from within of all organized forms or organizing structures, an undoing of all forms or ideologies that seek to homogenize, totalize, and delimit everything.24 It should be highlighted that the "body-without-organs" moment both in De leuze and Guattari and in ChuangTzu is more a mode of thought than a real, physical, nihilistic violence against the body. This point is critical because becoming needs a body: becoming takes place via the body. And so there is no abandonment of the body in Deleuze and Guattari's "body-without-organs"; in the latter, the body re mains, but is now free from all delimitations. With regard to Chuang Tzu, Chris Irving Goh 121</page><page sequence="13">Jochim has argued that the body is essentially maintained: despite the call to "smash [one's] form and body," according to the Chuang Tzu as cited above, Jochim writes that it is "not [about] eradicating one's self."25 The point instead is not to limit oneself to one's bodily form and interiorize all modes of thought within "a [solipsistic] mind body dualism."26 According to Jochim, Chuang Tzu's essential "ideal was that of 'being free from ji' (wu ji) in the sense of blending in with other persons, not to men tion 'all living things' (wan wu),"27 and I would add that such a "blending in with other persons, not to mention 'all living things'" gestures toward the notion of becoming-animal in the Chuang Tzu via the "body-without-organs" moment of "smash[ing] [one's] form and body." In short, it seems, then, that in the pursuit of the Way, the human form functions very much as an obstacle. As my argument has tried to show, it is not with the human but with the animal that one approaches the Way. In the pursuit of the Way, it is said that the "Perfect Man has no self; the Spiritual Man has no merit; the Sage has no fame [or name]" (p. 32).28 However, this guarantees neither that the Perfect Man has no merit and no fame or name, nor that the Spiritual Man has no self and no fame or name, nor that the Sage has no self and no merit. To affirm that the Perfect-Spiritual Sage is completely without self, merit, fame, and name altogether, I would argue that one would have to think of this Perfect-Spiritual-Sage as one who is already following the animal or becoming-animal. The animal, after all, is that which has no self, no merit, no fame, and no name. And if the capacity for discourse is what essentially defines our human condition or establishes our difference from the animal, as Aristotle has claimed, one would find Chuang Tzu's animal philosophy seeking to take leave of that human faculty of language, as if to secure a complete departure from the human. At an extreme limit, the Chuang Tzu will even argue that the perfect explication of the Way will take the form of "perfect speech," that is, only "the abandonment of speech" (p. 247). This will mean that it is with silence instead of human discourse that one approaches an understanding of the Way. One notes here that the animals Chuang Tzu follows in his philosophy are animals that are for the most part silent. It is not that these animals are mute, but that they have nothing to say to discourses that fail to understand things that go beyond their cognitive limits.29 But one could indeed say that Chuang Tzu's animals make no recourse to discursive practices at all, and one could perhaps speak of the "wordless teaching" (p. 43) of the Way by wordless animals, a teaching that instructs a pure and simple following of the animal as I have suggested at the begin ning. There is no need for discursive instruction in this apprenticeship of following the animal or becoming-animal. As such, one could even say that the initiation into the Way is just about being beside the animal, about experiencing the proximal pres ence of the animal, and that is all. To put it another way, it is perhaps simply a spatial experience beside the animal as one follows the animal, just as becoming-animal for Deleuze and Guattari is "a phenomenon of bordering."30 With regard to the notion of spatial experience, I would like to note, too, that Roger Ames has spoken of a mode of knowing in Chuang Tzu that is built on spatiality or proximity. Ames makes note of a "knowledge [that] is always proximate, situational, Philosophy East &amp; West</page><page sequence="14">participatory, and interpretative," a knowledge ChuangTzu derives from being "con tinuous with his surrounds."31 I would like to highlight the fact that the starting point for Ames to elicit this proximate knowledge is the concluding section of the chapter "Autumn Floods," a section concerning yet another dialogue between ChuangTzu and Hui Tzu, a dialogue in which Chuang Tzu claims to know what fishes like to do simply by standing beside the river in which the fishes swim. There is therefore a certain relation between animals and proximate knowing, and hence I would add to Ames' argument by suggesting that proximate knowing correlates to the wordless following of the animal or becoming-animal in ChuangTzu. But let me underscore that ChuangTzu takes leave of language; that is to say, he cannot (yet) abandon it completely, for an animal philosophy or a thinking of the animal remains to be written, even for ChuangTzu. What ChuangTzu can do, then, is but to inscribe a departure from language through language. Language in the Chuang Tzu must already signal something else or trace a line of movement going somewhere else. It must no longer remain within the boundaries of human commu nication and understanding. In line with what I have been arguing throughout here, I would say that words must instead take on an animal contour. Deleuze has written that "language must devote itself to reaching . . . feminine, animal, molecular de tours,"32 and, as I have pointed out in this essay, I believe the word k'un commits it self precisely to animal detours as it traverses the experiences of being a roe to becoming a big fish, and then becoming p'eng, which subsequently becomes the sky, and then the waters that move south. P'eng in its Chinese inscription, )fi, is interest ing too, for it brings together the Chinese characters for bird (S,) and friend (M)-33 One could certainly be drawn to think of this word as an amicable invitation to fol low the animal and its becomings. In the Chuang Tzu, it will be said that "if it is someone you can go with, then go with him to the very end of the mysterious Way" (p. 350). P'eng certainly appears to be that which the sages in the Chuang Tzu, including Chuang Tzu himself, "can go with," given the numerous instances of becoming-p'eng of these sages. Once again, the step toward the Way seems to be one that is opened up by the animal. The amicable word p'eng invites anyone to fol low it, and it is henceforth really a question of following this animal-word, a question of following its animal becomings "to the very end of the mysterious Way." Conclusion: Animal Philosophy, or la Philosophie inutile In the course of following the animal, one must not seek to return to a human condi tion. One must not take stock at any particular point and seek to make animal phi losophy useful for the human. For one thing, following the animal in the Chuang Tzu does not have as its purpose the education of the human. It does not aid in the con stitution of a more civic or more responsible man. And it provides no pedagogy such that one can be a more lucid thinker. Neither does it provide an ontological knowl edge of the animal. And as discussed already, following the animal is also politically useless. Chuang Tzu's animal philosophy might incidentally bear a political edge, but it will insist that it is political only to free itself from all obligations to politics. It Irving Coh 123</page><page sequence="15">certainly does not seek to found a politics of animal philosophy. It is not interested in establishing an alternative political terrain so as to oppose the delimiting political structures contemporaneous to ChuangTzu's time. In this sense, one could say that it offers nothing to political science. With regard to human education and human politics, then, ChuangTzu's animal philosophy can be regarded as useless.34 Chuang Tzu's animal philosophy is therefore rather different from what Peter Singer has in mind in regard to thinking with animals. Singer demands a translation of any philosophy of the animal into some practical utility, especially the ethical practical treatment of animals. For Singer, it is always a question of human ethics,35 a question one could argue to be admittedly anthropomorphic if not anthropocentric at the end of it all. I would say that Chuang Tzu's following of the animal is instead closer to the respective discourses of Agamben and Derrida on the animal. Using Heidegger's rhetoric and going beyond it at the same time—and one could add that it is a rhetoric close to ChuangTzu's, too—Agamben in The Open would argue that one must leave the animal as it is. Any discourse on the animal must not be recuper ated as a reflection on the state of human knowledge or ignorance.36 Arguing with Heidegger too, Derrida, in the last essay in L'animal que done je suis, calls for a rela tion between the human and the animal in which there is no demand for a knowl edge of an "essence of the animal," a relation in which the human does not approach the animal with an appetite to know it from a human perspective.37 Prefiguring Agamben and Derrida, then, ChuangTzu's animal philosophy, to reiterate, does not institute as its ends a service to human understanding. The secret or enigma of the animal is maintained in Chuang Tzu, and one could say that this is a respect for that which cannot be understood. It is humility before what it cannot understand, a hu mility where all hubris to understand everything is evacuated. As Chuang Tzu says, "understanding that rests in what it does not understand is the finest" (p. 44). One can never understand the animal: one can never know what it thinks or how it thinks. One cannot be sure if it even thinks. Leaving another living being as such, free in its own ways, and not seeking to understand how it functions in order to define that mode of functioning according to one's own perspective, is the just—in both senses of judicial justness and of pure simplicity—respect for another living being. And that is what Chuang Tzu's philoso phy does with respect to the animal. As John S. Major says about the animals in the Chuang Tzu, "they would be far better off simply pursuing their animal destinies undisturbed."38 I would now like to end by considering whether reading the Chuang Tzu in terms of an animal philosophy is to be approached metaphorically. Undeniably, it is always possible to read certain animals in the Chuang Tzu in metaphorical terms. For ex ample, the animals of "little understanding" that look on as k'un takes flight can stand for petty governmental or bureaucratic officials. With regard to the Way, the metaphorical approach could also be applied and say that the Way is an animal, tak ing into consideration the phrase "ten thousand things are one horse." However, I would argue that such reading methodology risks bringing ChuangTzu's entire ani mal philosophy back to mere human words for mere human understanding. Meta 124 Philosophy East &amp; West</page><page sequence="16">phors, after all, are deployed only to serve human understanding by creating other word-images to which the human understanding can gain access.39 Certainly, the following of the animal that I elicit from ChuangTzu remains at the level of text or words. However, I believe that this following of the animal must be subsequently practiced beyond the page. Just as the Way can never be fixed by words, following the animal must not remain as a textual hypostasis. In other words, I would like to think that ChuangTzu's following of the animal demands a similar reality that De leuze and Guattari ask of their becoming-animal (Deleuze and Guattari will insist that there is a reality to becoming-animal,40 and that it is not a metaphorical exercise;41 metaphors, for them, are but a regression to a "whole anthropocentric entourage"42). Admittedly, I have not extended the discussion of Chuang Tzu's becoming animal to its practical experimentation in real terms. But neither do Deleuze and Guattari, nor, in fact, does ChuangTzu. One could say that the reservation against such extension may be a precaution against turning becoming-animal into a reduc tive, homogeneous, and delimiting prescriptive manual. Such a precaution should be heeded at all times, for becoming-animal in both Deleuze and Guattari and in ChuangTzu is always without blueprint or "beyond skill" (p. 50). But the reservation against speculating becoming-animal's practical expression may also be a modest acknowledgment that such a task can never be adequately unfolded by philosophy. Philosophy can only gesture toward following the animal, hinting at its real and radical possibilities or potentialities. But philosophy recognizes that it can be inade quate when it comes to saying how it could be done. Philosophy has to come to terms with the fact that it has too often, if not only, devoted itself to thinking on paper, and has not experimented well enough with how thought can play out in real terms in the real world. Perhaps the discipline of philosophy for the most part always risks not being able to ultimately achieve "the fasting of the mind" (p. 58) but "still mak[e] the mind [one's] teacher" (p. 57). The elucidation of the practice of becoming-animal in real terms, then, is perhaps best left to those who do not risk the trappings of aca demia. But despite the limits of academic writing, I reiterate that reading the animals in Chuang Tzu as metaphorical wordplay on the one hand delimits the force of the text to mere linguistic deftness, and reduces it on the other hand to just another bildungs roman for human education. Such a reading methodology misses out on the follow ing of the animal or the becoming-animal of writing. In other words, it would only retrace the narrow anthropomorphic perspective of Hui Tzu that I have highlighted at the beginning of this essay. It would be a failure to witness the event of writing in the ChuangTzu, the event in which writing follows the animal if not becomes-animal. To go beyond metaphorical studies,43 and to elicit a becoming-animal trajectory, may be a radical approach to ChuangTzu scholarship, but I believe that it is only with this radical edge that the Chuang Tzu can critically place itself within contemporary questions of the animal, which certainly are not concerned with the "little under standing" of animals as metaphors. Contemporary intellectual discourse on the animal question is already referenced inexhaustibly in the Western canon's philo sophical, religious, political, and literary texts. I believe that the Chuang Tzu, which Irving Goh 125</page><page sequence="17">lies outside that canon, can provide a critical supplement to this discourse and broaden its space of comparative discussion. But this can be done only by recogniz ing that the Chuang Tzu is not just a text with animal metaphors but a veritable ani mal text, a text that looks toward following the animal or becoming-animal in real terms.44 It is only then that one is opened to forces, visions, senses, and a vitality that go beyond anthropocentric and anthropomorphic limits and which challenge all present modes of thinking. Notes I would like to thank Roger Ames and the anonymous reader(s) for believing in this essay, and certainly also for their comments and suggestions for revision based on the original version. Finally, I would also like to dedicate this essay to my teacher at Cor nell, Dominick LaCapra. 1 - Watson, The Complete Works ofChuang Tzu, p. 35. Subsequent citations from this text will be referenced by page numbers in parentheses in the main text of the essay. 2 - At times, however, even within the same chapter, the notion of clarity itself is refused. So later, in the chapter titled "Discussion on Making All Things Equal," one will learn that "If the Way is made clear, it is not the Way" (p. 44). 3 - As Alan Watts has noted, any thinker steeped in Taoist thought would in fact regard as absurd any thought that seeks to achieve something at the end of it. There is no end point to be sought. In his words, "when a Taoist sage is wander ing through the forest, he is not going anywhere, he is just wandering" (Watts, The Way of Liberation, p. 74). I would argue that following the animal bears the sense of such wandering. 4 - It is perhaps interesting to note that while Taoist thought and literature are men tioned in their A Thousand Plateaus, the reference to ChuangTzu was somehow missed by Deleuze and Guattari. 5 - Interestingly, Gerald Bruns writes that "Deleuze and Guattari are notorious im provisers of concepts, which are not always meant to be clear, since for them a concept is never exactly 'about' something, but is a certain way of articulating complexities, as if to avoid closure or resolution whatever the matter at hand" (Gerald Bruns, "Becoming-Animal," p. 703). Deleuze and Guattari therefore share a certain obscure "clarity" with ChuangTzu. One must not expect, then, that the explication of following the animal here, with the aid of Deleuze and Guattari's becoming-animal, will build toward a lineal and logical argument of what this following is ontologically, a mode of thought that is demanded by the conventions of the philosophical discipline. Instead, one can only demonstrate how ChuangTzu and Deleuze-Guattari have put language to work or how they have made language point to something other than a function of human com Philosophy East &amp; West</page><page sequence="18">munication. In short, one can only witness the effects of the creative and ex perimental rhetoric of ChuangTzu and Deleuze-Guattari. 6 - Deleuze and Guattari, A Thousand Plateaus, p. 240. 7 - It is on this point that I disagree with Kuang-ming Wu that one is able to say so assuredly or affirmatively that "ChuangTzu dreamed of being the butterfly, and so it belongs to him" (Wu, The Butterfly as Companion, p. 3). 8 - I would note that for Deleuze and Guattari, affect and becoming-animal are linked: "Affects are . .. nonhuman becomings of man" (Deleuze and Guattari, What is Philosophy? p. 169). 9 - Deleuze and Guattari, A Thousand Plateaus, p. 258. 10 - Roel Sterckx, in The Animal and the Daemon in Early China, has noted that an animal-human continuum constitutes an understanding of cosmology in Early China. But, as I would add, that does not imply that humans are willing to tra verse that continuum and place themselves with the animals or on the side of animals. Worse, it is always possible—and this has been the history of anthro pomorphism and anthropocentrism—that humans violate that continuum and exclude animals from that continuum. It becomes important, then, to point out thatChuangTzu's philosophy provides a critical intervention against any human discourse that seeks not only to separate animals from humans but also to establish a denigrating difference between humans and animals. Contrary to other discourses that seek to define human-animal differences, Chuang Tzu, especially in this butterfly-dream passage here, seeks to reestablish the human animal continuum that is lost. 11 - Existing translations also tend to repress (perhaps unconsciously) the other events of becoming within this passage. This occurs in the line that I have trans lated as "As this bird, the waters begin to move toward the south. . . The af firmation of p'eng the bird "as this bird," following its becoming from k'un the fish, and the simultaneous becoming-movement or, to be more precise, the becoming-moving-south of the waters, have never been translated in a way that carries the full force of this series of becomings. 12 - See footnote 1 in Watson, The Complete Works of Chuang Tzu, p. 29. 13-1 have said at the beginning of this essay that the (animal) philosophy of Chuang Tzu does not seek to reach toward a definitive goal. And I believe this is cer tainly a consequence of following k'un or p'eng. With regard to Chuang Tzu, Katrin Froese has also noted an absence of any organizing blueprint or philo sophical itinerary. She observes: "He is not goal oriented.... [H]e is open to all transformations that he encounters.... He revels in these experiences without becoming attached to any one of them. ... [H]esees his self as part of the trans formation of things rather than a whole that he must tend to.. .(Froese, Ni etzsche, Heidegger, and Daoist Thought, p. 98). That is certainly the case of Irving Goh 127</page><page sequence="19">k'un, too, as I have noted—becoming-p'eng, then becoming-sky, and then becoming-waters. Froese is certainly among other ChuangTzu critics like Chris Jochim, who has likewise written that ChuangTzu "does not advocate a well planned life punctuated by enjoyable moments of flow. Seeing a universe in flow, he invites us to participate in the flow, like fish swimming in water" (Jo chim, "Just Say No to 'No Self' in the Zhuangzi," p. 65). 14- In a subsequent passage, which certainly recalls this scene of becoming of k'un and p'eng, a passage depicting the becoming -k'un or becoming-p'eng of Chuang Tzu himself, and which I quote as an epigraph for my next section, these human directional categories will in fact be done away with. 15 - As it will be evident very soon below, this essay was written at a time, after 9/11, when the Bush administration was still in power, and had led the world to join in, almost without choice, the global "war on terror." According to that admin istration, it was the duty of any responsible democratic citizen in any part of the world not to resist or oppose the culture of fear or paranoia that the administra tion had successfully disseminated globally. 16 - The phrase "the right to disappear" appears in Blanchot's Michel Foucault tel que je I'imagine. 17 - Deleuze and Guattari, Kafka: Toward a Minor Literature, p. 12. 18 - One should note, too, that the yak escapes the trap also because, unlike the wildcat or the weasel, it is not concerned with catching rats. It just wanders in its bigness, or becomes-sky in its vastness. On the other hand, the wildcat and the weasel (which are certainly smaller than the yak), because they are fixed on the singular predatory intention to hunt rats, plan their moves and ruses, but forget the trap that lies in wait for them as their counterpoint, and are eventu ally captured by that trap and perish in the net. 19 - Deleuze and Guattari, A Thousand Plateaus, p. 279. 20 - Ibid., p. 247. 21 - This can perhaps be read in the advice given by Confucius to Yen Hui in the chapter "In the World of Men." Yen Hui wants to go to the state of Wei to advise its incompetent ruler against further "lead[ing] his people into peril" (p. 54). But Confucius regards Yen Hui's intention as inappropriate. Confucius' response is that the Way has let pass such a manner of ruling and that any intervention is but an intervention against the Way at the same time. "The Way doesn't want things mixed in with it" (p. 54), as Confucius says. Confucius will go on to ex plain that any intervention will only risk execution, especially if the ruler is a tyrant and has no regard for other points of view except his own. And if the ruler is not a tyrant, Yen Hui will then risk turning his act of counsel into one that "is simply using other men's bad points to parade [one's] own excellence" (p. 55), that is, an act that creates fame for oneself in the process, or which cre ates a semblance of wisdom through incessantly preaching a personal point of Philosophy East &amp; West</page><page sequence="20">view. According to Confucius, in this case "Virtue is destroyed by fame, and wisdom comes out of wrangling" (p. 55). It is best to leave politics aside, then, if one is to pursue the veritable virtue and wisdom of the Way. And virtue, for ChuangTzu, is "inaction": "to understand what you can do nothing about and be content with it as with fate—that is the perfection of virtue" (p. 60). 22 - John S. Major has previously argued likewise that what is critical for Chuang Tzu is "not the proper ordering of the world, nor a prescription for sagelike government, but the survival of the individual in an age where active, striving government (which is to say, bad government), everywhere prevails" (Major, "The Efficacy of Uselessness," p. 265). 23 - The apolitical ideal of animal philosophy, or its dream of a world order with out politics or governmentality, may be represented by the Nameless Man in the Chuang Tzu. In response toT'ien Ken, who wants to know "how to rule the world" (p. 93), the Nameless Man, speaking in a way that clearly follows the movement of k'un or p'eng, will say: "Let your mind wander in simplicity, blend your spirit with the vastness, follow along with things the way they are, and make no room for personal views—then the world will be governed" (p. 94). 24 - In another essay, Deleuze, like ChuangTzu, has also written of the abandoning of the human form in the face of the human desire to dominate everything else: "One does not become Man, insofar as man presents himself as a dominant form of expression that claims to impose itself on all matter" (Deleuze, "Litera ture and Life," p. 1). 25 - Chris Jochim, "Just Say No to 'No Self' in Zhuangzi," p. 55. 26 - Ibid. p. 53. 27 - Ibid. 28 - Translation modified. The original goes: SA;E3 ' I have translated as Spiritual Man instead of "Holy Man" as Watson does, so as to avoid a possible occidental religious overtone. With I have suggested that the literal meaning of "name" applies, in addition to Watson's translation of it into "fame." 29 - But this is not to say that the Way does not express itself in words. In fact, it does, except one cannot think that whatever words that express the Way are the final words of or on the Way. The Way gives way to words, but it is not delim ited by them; it goes beyond words. Or there must always be other words to follow the movement of the Way. Words do not serve to follow the Way when they are believed to be the "right" words for the Way, or when they distinguish themselves as the "appropriate" form of expression of the Way by differentiating themselves from animal articulations. This is perhaps how one can read the pas sage on words in the chapter "Discussion on Making All Things Equal." There is no renunciation of words there. The point there is not to put a premium on words: "Words are not just wind. Words have something to say. But if what they Irving Goh</page><page sequence="21">have to say is not fixed, then do they really say something? Or do they say noth ing? People suppose that words are different from the peeps of baby birds, but is there any difference, or isn't there?.. . How can the Way go away and not exist? How can words exist and not be acceptable?" (p. 39). As I am suggesting here, it is with words that follow the animal or words that become-animal that this following of the Way is maintained. 30 - Deleuze and Guattari, A Thousand Plateaus, p. 345. For Deleuze and Guattari, becoming-animal is a matter of allowing oneself to approach the adjacent space beside the animal, and allowing the molecules at the frays of one's own anthro pomorphic body to encounter with or correspond to the molecules departing from the edges of the animal body. 31 - Roger Ames, "Knowing in the Zhuangzi," p. 220. 32 - Deleuze, "Literature and Life," p. 2. 33 - Kuang-ming Wu, in The Butterfly as Companion, likewise notes that p'eng sig nifies "a bird (niao, alone) with friends" (p. 57). The relation between the animal and friendship also has its resonance in Deleuze and Guattari's becoming animal. According to Deleuze and Guattari, becoming-animal can be initiated, too, by a following of an anomalous figure, an "exceptional individual" (A Thousand Plateaus, p. 243) that hovers at the edge of the animal pack. It is that border-space that this anomalous friend occupies which also gives it a certain counter-political force, in the sense that it is not an outlaw, and yet there is no telling either if it still has its political allegiance to the pack or (already) to some thing antithetical to the pack. 34 - I am clearly following John S. Major here, who has argued that ChuangTzu's "teachings were useless, for they contained no prescription for government; but to the person who learned uselessness from them, they were useful indeed— Chuang-tzu's point exactly" (Major, "The Efficacy of Uselessness," p. 277). 35 - In his preface to Calarco and Atterton, Animal Philosophy, Singer laments the "failure" "to grapple with the issue of how we treat animals" (p. xii; my em phasis). 36 - Again, in a rhetoric echoing Heidegger's and Chuang Tzu's, Agamben would call for a letting-be of the animal, a letting-be that would demand from the human an acknowledgment of a "zone of nonknowledge" "or of a-knowledge" with regard to the animal. As Agamben writes, "Insofar as the animal knows neither beings nor nonbeings, neither open nor closed, it is outside of being; it is outside in an exteriority more external than any open, and inside in an inti macy more internal than any closedness. To let the animal be would then mean: to let it be outside of being. The zone of non knowledge—or of a-knowledge—that is at issue here is beyond both knowing and not knowing" (Agamben, The Open: Man and Animal, p. 91). 37 - See Derrida, L'animal que done je suis, pp. 218-219. Philosophy East &amp; West</page><page sequence="22">38 - Major, "The Efficacy of Uselessness," p. 271. 39 - Metaphor's strictly humanist or anthropocentric emphasis is certainly pro nounced in Lakoff and Johnson's Metaphors We Live By. Right at the beginning of their book, they declare that "metaphor is pervasive in everyday life, not just in language, but in thought and action. Our ordinary conceptual system, in terms of which we both think and act, is fundamentally metaphorical in nature" (p. 3; my emphasis). For them, the study and application of metaphor in the fields of politics, philosophy, humanities, psychology, et cetera, are but in the service of future human application and of a better understanding of the human. Nowhere do they suggest that metaphors have implications for the animal. 40 - As they argue in A Thousand Plateaus, becomings-animal "are perfectly real" (p. 238), except that others "do not see the reality of a becoming-animal" (p. 259). Perhaps this also applies to the animal followings of Chuang Tzu. 41 - Mark Bronta and John Protevi have noted that any metaphorical reading of becoming-animal only risks a regression to anthropomorphism or anthropocen trism, something that I think is risked by a similar reading methodology of ChuangTzu's following of the animal. According to Bronta and Protevi, "When A Thousand Plateaus discusses birds, it is concerned with them as birds, not as metaphors that allow us to understand ourselves better [my italics], A Thousand Plateaus' discussion of bird song allows us to understand bird song, and from there geophilosophical concepts such as the refrain, landscapes, territories, and so forth. Similar processes operate in human territorial phenomena, but A Thou sand Plateaus does not use the bird only to get to the human" (Bronta and Pro tevi, Deleuze and Geophilosophy, p. 40; my italics). 42 - Deleuze and Guattari, Kafka: Toward a Minor Literature, p. 36. 43 - Kim-Chong Chong's essay "Zhuangzi and the Nature of Metaphor" occupies an interesting place in contemporary ChuangTzu scholarship. It is clearly indebted to the line of scholarship that reads the Chuang Tzu in metaphorical terms, for it takes its motivation and point of departure from Robert E. Allison's Chuang Tzu for Spiritual Transformation, a book that emphatically argues for "the meta phorical order of arguments" in the Chuang Tzu (p. 3). While Chong disagrees with Allison's reading of the butterfly dream as a metaphor for higher beauty, Chong nonetheless maintains Allison's point that "Zhuangzi uses metaphor ex tensively" and that he seeks to promote an "appreciation of the role [metaphor] plays in [Chuang Tzu's] thought" (p. 370). Yet if one reads more carefully as to how Chong speaks of metaphor, his argument seems to slide at the same time toward one that exceeds metaphorical readings. Chong follows Donald David son's understanding of metaphors, which means understanding metaphors in terms of "having no cognitive content beyond its literal meaning" (p. 370). One could then ask, why remain with the term metaphor? In other words, Chong's understanding of metaphors paradoxically points toward the uselessness of metaphor. Irving Coh</page><page sequence="23">- In "The Perfected Person in the Radical Chuang-tzu," Yearley, too, argues that a reading methodology that refuses to go beyond the textual level and into the real or the "literally true" as he calls it, but reduces the words to cognitive pedagogical means, as metaphors do, only reduces the radical force of the ChuangTzu. According to Yearley, "seeing ideas not as literally true . .. contains a danger .... The danger is that of domestication, of masking the foreign, the strange, and the challenging into the homey, the familiar, and the acceptable" (p. 137). References Agamben, Giorgio.
