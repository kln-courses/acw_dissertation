The University of Arizona Press, Tucson, Arizona. 1984. 297 pp. $9.50 paperbound. 90 JOURNAL OF THE ARIZONA-NEVADA ACADEMY OF SCIENCE VOL. 19 BOOK REVIEW This is a first printing by the University of Arizona Press of a book originally published in 1973 in hard cover by Knopf, New York. The text is divided into thirteen chapters. Attractive maps of southeastern Arizona are provided. Regrettably, photo- graphs that had been included in the original version of the book have been excluded from this volume, otherwise, the text remains unchanged from the original. About one-half of the book deals with the author, his sons and a friend, and their adventures during their year-long sojourn in Arizona. The remaining half discusses individual and social behavior of coatis. The text is remarkably free of typographical errors and misspellings. The author's use, however, of tortuous sentence struc- ture disrupts the flow of the text. For example, on p. 83 we read "On the other hand, had we not first become acquainted with these animals, learned something about basic chulo skills, behavior, traditions from them, we very probably would not have known how to introduce ourselves to the less tame animals in the Huachucas, would have had less understanding of how these tribes functioned." This kind of sentence is characteristic of his style throughout the book. The author studied coati behavior using an admittedly anthropomorphic approach. He believes that the avoidance of anthropomorphism "is often unnecessary and undesirable, an attitude which inhibits rather than promotes understanding of the lifestyles of other bloods" (p. 194). "Other bloods" is a term he uses throughout the book, apparently in lieu of the term "species". Consistent with this casual approach, a few inaccuracies are perpetuated: "The agave is an aloe ..." (p. 33), "There are students . . . who claim that the flora and fauna of these southern Arizona mountains is richer, more complex than in any similarly sized region in the New World." (p. 23). While many JANAS readers would find Gilbert's book a truly entertaining armchair adventure, a rigorous study of coati behavior and ecology in Arizona is still lacking. (However, the only technical works on Arizona coatis of which we are aware are D. V. Lanning, 1976, J. Mamm., 57:609-611 and A. C. Risser's M.S. thesis, 1962, cited in Gilbert's book). In the author's introductory note (dated 1973), Gilbert mentions that some of the information collected during a year's field work was being organized for publication in technical reports and journals. As far as we have been able to determine, no such technical versions have been published in the subsequent years. There is no question that much concerted effort went into gathering data during Gilbert's study, but we would like to see precise methodologies and unbiased, non-anthropomorphic results and discussion, perhaps on the pages of the JANAS. A reader can learn much about coatis from this book, but if one is interested in retrieving a certain detail about coati biology, one will need to search through much prose. Nevertheless, the book is fun to read and concerns itself with creatures and a small corner of the world which are near and dear to our hearts. Kenneth P.
