<plain_text><page sequence="1">History of Economie Ideas, 111/\995/2 WRITING A PhD IN THE HISTORY OF ECONOMICS Paul M. Augimeri Australian Catholic University Introduction My observations and views on "Writing a PhD in the History of Economies" are influenced, to a large extent, by my own recent experience as a part-time PhD student at Sydney University. By their nature, PhD dissertations - and not only in the history of économies - are documents as diverse as the individuata who write them. However, this diversity does not imply that certain general procédures cannot be specified. The main aim of the paper is to examine briefly some basic procédural aspects and key problems which may be encountered by students writing a PhD in the his tory of économies. The feasibility of the PhD project If the methodology of writing a PhD in the history of écono mies includes, as it must, systematic planning of the research, the question whether the proposed thesis topic is feasible must be addressed at the pre-planning stage. Let me illustrate the problem of feasibility by reference to my own doctoral work on "The Eco nomie Ideas of Antonio Genovesi (1713-1769)". I clearly chose a fairly obscure pre-Smithian author (one of the many referred to by Schumpeter (1954) in his inimitable potted biographies), not to mention one whose writings had not been translated into English. My knowledge of Italian helped overcome the latter problem. With regard to the former, I was quite justifiably required to con duct a thorough search of Australian libraries in order to establish what relevant source materiata were available locally before my candidature was approved. This was supplemented by the equally</page><page sequence="2">158 reasonable requirement that, during the period of candidature, I undertake some research in Italy. Having taught the subject "The Development of Economie Ideas" for some years at what is now the Australian Catholic University, I was also able to demonstrate that I had a background in the history of economie thought. I cannot overlook the important considération of an appropriate Supervisor of the intending candidate's proposed re search. Without a committed, interested Supervisor, the PhD pro ject is hardly ever feasible. The supervisori main function is un questionably to promote worthwhile research and scholarship. In the history of économies, and more generally the social sciences, the Supervisor need not, in my view, have specialist knowledge of the studenti PhD subject. Breadth and depth of knowledge of the history of économies, combined with ability and experience in research are more than adequate credentials for one entrusted with the direction and évaluation of the studenti research and writing. Comprehensive exploration of the practical feasibility of a proposed PhD project merits early attention. If the required re search materials are not accessible, a distinct possibility when con ducting research on a fairly unknown author, or a suitable Super visor is not available, the proposed research topic is generally not sustainable. The requirement of originality Whatever the PhD topic chosen, it must meet the normal re quirement of originality in a PhD thesis. For example, the Uni versity of Sydney PhD régulations stipulate that the thesis "shall be a substantially original contribution to the subject concerned". The term 'thesis' moreover, suggests the statement and systematic defence of a particular argument or position. Defining an original argument must be seen as the foundation of a successful PhD thesis; without it, the writer is unlikely to be in a position to claim a contribution to knowledge. The notion of 'originality' in a PhD context is undoubtedly problematical. In dealing with the history of économies, one is dealing with the history of ideas, in which a received interprétation is often amenable to a new approach to</page><page sequence="3">159 différent interprétation. Convincing arguments of a new approach to established ideas is generally sufficient to establish originality in a PhD thesis in the history of économies. In order to determine the existing boundaries of knowledge for a given topic, one of the first tasks for intending PhD students in the history of economic thought is to prepare a criticai and, as far as possible, exhaustive review of the relevant literature to their topic. This procedure is often an effective means of stimulating further, sometimes original, thought or ideas in the area con cerned. Traditionally, a literature review is frequently included in a thesis as a separate early chapter or section. Alternatively, it may be considered préférable to incorporate différent aspects of the review in the criticai analysis and discussion of the thesis. My own research lent itself to the latter approach. The analysis of Genovesi's economic ideas required a systematic, criticai appraisal of the ideas on his work in the earlier literature. The structure of the thesis Having resolved the practical and intellectual feasibility of the topic, a draft plan of the thesis which will normally serve as the introductory chapter, has to be prepared. Ideally it should contain a statement of the central argument of the thesis, followed by a detailed outline of how that argument is to be developed in subséquent chapters. This initial plan is frequently only tentative; changes are inevitably made as work on the thesis proceeds. Again, illustrating from my own research, my original inten tion had been to examine critically Genovesi's alleged 'mercantil ism'. The commentators, both Italian and non-Italian, were gener ally agreed that this was the more appropriate way to catégorisé Genovesi's économies. My growing acquaintance with his écono mies, together with some lively discussion with my Supervisor, changed this perspective. Given Genovesi's aim to promote eco nomie reform in the then Kingdom of Naples, a more useful pers pective was to view Genovesi principally as a national economie reformer, and therefore, an early builder of a national system of</page><page sequence="4">160 politicai economy. The graduai refinement of the argument is therefore an inherent part of the process of writing a PhD in the history of économies. In other words, the writing of a thesis is virtually guaranteed to be subject to a learning curve. The structure and content of the thesis tend to reflect the nature of the proposed topic. The title of my thesis was 'the Eco nomie Ideas of Antonio Genovesi'. Hence, chapters discussing Genovesi's ideas on 'Population and Education', 'Wealth and Production', 'Foreign Trade', 'Value and Price', 'Money', 'Private Credit and Interest' and 'Public fi nance' (Chapters 3 to 9) constituted the main part of the thesis. Given my emphasis on Genovesi's rôle as a national economie reformer, Chapter 2 needed to be devoted to presenting relevant biographical material on Genovesi and contemporary evidence of the backward economie and social conditions in the kingdom of Naples. The biographical part of the chapter was essential to sup port the argument that the Chair of Politicai Economy specifically endowed for Genovesi in 1754 was the foundation for his subsé quent work as a national reformer. Its second part aimed at ascer taining whether economic conditions in Naples in the eighteenth Century matched Genovesi's belief about the need for reform. The contents of Chapters 3 to 9, referred to above, were in this way preceded by an attempt to justify what was seen as Genovesi's main rôle as Professor of Politicai Economy in the University of Naples, that of national economic reformer. This argument was elaborated in Chapter 10, entitled 'Genovesi - Mercantilist, Phy siocrat or Reformer?' This chapter cast doubts in the first place on the standard view of Genovesi as a 'mercantilist'. The next section elaborated this point. It then discussed whether Genovesi was in fluenced by the Physiocrats, another issue covered in the litera ture. The major conclusion of this section was that his classifica tion as a Physiocrat is inappropriate. This relied on his admitted relativism in the matter of economic Systems, and perception of a unique system for Naples, combined with quite distinctive ideas on the contribution of productive and non-productive labour to national income. In short, Genovesi should be viewed as a nation al economic reformer, a theme pursued in Chapter 11, 'The Place of Genovesi in the History of Economie Thought'. The final</page><page sequence="5">161 chapter, 'Towards a New View of Genovesi's Economies', summarised the principal findings of the thesis. The most appropriate structure of the thesis is one which best demonstrates how coherent and convincing the argument of the thesis is. In a thesis in the history of économies, it needs to link aspects of economie analysis to the underlying thread of the argu ment concerning évaluation and assessment. Hindsight and the history of économies A relevant problem for students writing a PhD in the history of économies is the extent to which the criticai appraisal of earlier ideas should be made in the light of subséquent developments in economie analysis and thought. My obvious allusion to the prob lem of hindsight in evaluating earlier economie ideas reflects what Blaug (1984) has termed "the anthropomorphic sin of judging old er writers by the canons of modem theory". A notable manifesta tion of the use, and abuse, of hindsight in the history of économies is the indiscriminate classification and dismissal of much pre Smithian économies as 'mercantilist'. To some extent, the assumed superiority of classical free trade principles must be regarded as the source of the misapplication of hindsight to pre-Smithian éco nomies. The practice, in which Smith himself was involved, has tended to vitiate the study of early économies and should be tre ated with caution. My own research showed that most writers on Genovesi have almost invariably concentrated on one or more of the specific policy issues of his économies (for example, the balance of trade), and on that basis have classified him as a 'mercantilist'. Evaluating his work from such a narrow perspective fails to recognise that disparate policy issues form part of the total program Genovesi conceived in order to solve the cruciai problem of his économies, the economie under-development of the kingdom of Naples. Be cause, as already noted, Genovesi's aim was to promote reform of the economy as a whole, the more appropriate interprétation of his economie ideas requires an essentially holistic approach, that is, a considération of those ideas as elements of a total system of</page><page sequence="6">162 reform. This alternative 'systems' approach to the évaluation of Genovesi's work support the view that to classify him as a 'mer cantilist' is unjustified. Various factors prompted questioning of the stereotype éva luation of Genovesi's économies as 'mercantilist'. For instance, the qualified approach of some commentators who described his particular brand of mercantilism as 'moderate', 'refined' or 'en lightened' raised doubts about the validity of applying the term 'mercantilist' at ali to Genovesi1. The evidence from Genovesi himself was even more compelling. According to him, the aims of politicai economy were to provide "the solution to these four great problems. I. To bave the greatest possible population. II. To bave the greatest possible amount of amenities. III. The greatest possible wealth. IV. and the greatest possible power" (Genovesi, 1984, 127). The inclusion of "amenities" among these aims sug gests that Genovesi's perspective extended beyond the traditional aims of "power and plenty" assigned to mercantilists by Viner (1991: 142). Genovesi emphasised the interdependence of the above aims, saying: "It is impossible to have the maximum amount of amenities, wealth and power without achieving the greatest possible population, nor population without the first three" (Genovesi, ibid.). In short, economie development necessi tated higher living standards, which, Genovesi argued, would be manifested in greater consumption (Genovesi 1984: 159). He also stressed that greater productivity could not be achieved "without good health, and ... without amenities" (Genovesi, 1768, 182). The welfare aspects of Genovesi's "pubblica felicità" (Genovesi (1768, 76) are also conveyed in his denunciation of the proposition "that people are more industrious the more they are beggarly, wretched and poor, that is, hardened to doing without and hence apathetic to every amenity" (Genovesi 1768: 57). In contrast, Genovesi advocated a labour force enjoying the benefits of its productivity by consuming the amenities of life and anything but apathetic to them. The achievement of wealth and power is therefore to be seen as necessarily contributing to social welfare. Genovesi's eco 1. For example, Cossa, 1892, 258; Ingram, 1914, 71-2; Pribram, 1983, : Wilson, 1967, 550.</page><page sequence="7">163 nomic and social objectives are clearly not identical to the "power and plenty" which Viner (ibid.) suggests were the objectives of mercantilism. A moral dimension in Genovesi's treatment of economie be haviour casts further doubt on his 'mercantilist' inclinations. Although he acknowledged repeatedly that "no man works except out of self-interest" (Genovesi, 1962, 172), Genovesi also stated: "You cannot have économies or politics or the arts or industry or anything good unless you have a sound and enlightened virtue" (Genovesi, 1962, 177). He insisted: "It is useless to think about the arts, about commerce, about government, if you don't think about reforming morals" (Genovesi, 1962, 178). Clearly, Genovesi intended the moral improvement of individuata to be part of the process of economie development. Indeed, a morality of economie behaviour is implicit in purely formai aspects of his économies : for example, in the requirement that, to be just, prices must be naturally determined. The failure to recognise the exist ence of an implicit or explicit moral dimension in Genovesi's éco nomies has arguably contributed to his common désignation as a 'mercantilist'. Dealing with 'errors' in early writings Another pertinent question is the appropriate criticai stance in the face of obvious errors in economie thought or analysis. Since PhD students are implicitly required to exercise informed criticai judgment, they should not hesitate to identify the exist ence of errors of logie or reasoning. For instance, Genovesi (1770, 21) argued that "whenever the quantity of ... money grows, the relative price of things and labour grows proportionately". This rather mechanistic argument is open to the objection that without a ceteris paribus assumption, the postulated outeome is not neces sary. Genovesi's argument is clearly faulty, and becomes ali the more noteworthy when it is realised that he was aware of the need for the ceteris paribus condition in connection with arguments on the quantity of money (Genovesi, 1770, 304)2. 2. For example, Genovesi, 1770, 304, stated: "Men in general regard those</page><page sequence="8">164 The above notwithstanding, identification of errors like the use of hindsight requires cautions treatment. An error in econo mie thought may, in act, be explained by the wider conceptual context in which it occurs. To illustrate, Genovesi's belief in the metallic nature of money reflected his opinion that "real money" (Genovesi 1770, 69) has "intrinsic value, like everything else that is of use to us, and is therefore controlied by naturai proportions, like the value of ali other commodities" (Genovesi, 1770, 32). Genovesi's view of the trae nature of money will be understood only against the background of his ideas on value, which in turn requires an understanding of his essentially subjective conception of needs, in which, according to Genovesi, value has its main origin. The wider context mentioned above could be extended to include an account of the influence of natural law on Genovesi's concept of value. Genovesi was clearly in error in propounding the notion of metallic money as "real money". In its broader context, however, the error per se is, if not acceptable, at least understandable. Sources of research data The final version of the thesis requires a statement of the primary and secondary sources used, a detailed listing of which is ultimately provided in the bibliography. The use of the most reliable éditions of those sources as the basis of undertaking research for a PhD in the history of économies calls for little comment. In dealing with Genovesi's most important work, the so-called Lezioni, I had available to me various éditions, including that in the Custodi collection of 1803. In the event, I relied exclusively on the second Neapolitan édition of the work. My décision was influenced by the observations of Venturi (1960, 18) that that version was, in fact, prepared and hence a approved by Genovesi himself; by contrast, the Custodi édition "was based on a questionable text and ... [was] not in conformity with the last nations which, all other things equal, have a iarger quantity of money as greater and happier, and as weak and miserable those which have less" (my italics).</page><page sequence="9">165 wishes of the author". Pii (1984) also used the second Neapolitan édition for his research on Genovesi. Invariably secondary sources will also be consulted. Here the varying quality of criticai commentary and the possibility of error should be recognised. Some examples will be instructive. Villari, an Italian writer on Genovesi, claimed that one of Genovesi's "original concepts" (Villari 1968, 247) included the essentially physiocratic concept of the produit net. His argument was based on "the Genovesian formula of real income (reddito reale)", a term not used by Genovesi, "according to which a nation requires ... a large stock of goods of every kind whose use and consump tion leaves each year a residuai (called product (prodotto))", another term not used by Genovesi, "to the making of which ali social classes contribute". Villari went on to argue that the prodotto to which he referred was "nothing but the physiocratic produit net extended to ali sources of production and not arising exclusively from agriculture" (Villari 1968, 247-8). Since the produit net refers to the economy's annual disposable surplus (or net product) generated exclusively by the primary sector, Villari's claim regarding a Genovesian équivalent of the physiocratic produit net was conceptually and technically untenable3. Misleading preconceptions need also to be guarded against in secondary sources. For example, Gangemi (1956, 213) supported the case in favour of a physiocratic influence on Genovesi on the grounds of the latter's belief "in the preeminence of agriculture". Again, in a direct reference to Genovesi, Hutchison (1988, 405, n. 3) speaks of "a mildly physiocratic emphasis on agriculture" in his work. However, as Schumpeter (1954, 204), n. 6) rightly observed, agrarianism, or a "concern with agricultural conditions does not make a writer a physiocrat". Enough has been said pre viously to show that the many 'mercantilist' preconceptions about Genovesi were suspect. 3. If Genovesi had used the term prodotto in the sense of 'residuai' claimed by Villari, it would have resembled Smith's net produce or Ricardo's net re venue, i.e. economie surplus after ali expenses have been deducted from total product. It may also be noted that Villari does not indicate how the prodotto he sees in Genovesi's work would influence annual reproduction and economie growth.</page><page sequence="10">166 A final example will demonstrate the traps of exaggeration to which unwary PhD students in the history of économies can fall. Hutchison (ibid.) calls Genovesi one of Cari Menger's "predeces sors", in contrasts to Schumpeter's (1951: 86) observation that Menger "was nobody's pupil". Schumpeter (ibid.) acknowledged that "there are ... many hints of a subjective theory of value ... from the scholastic school onwards, especially by Genovesi and Isnard". However, he insisted that "Menger's theory belongs en tirely to him - ... and to Jevons and Walras" (Schumpeter 1951: 87), hence suggesting that Hutchison's claim regarding Genovesi as one of Menger's "predecessors" cannot be taken seriously. PhD students in the history of économies need to ensure their sources are comprehensive and include the most recent liter ature. In this regard, the benefits of making contact with scholars and relevant institutions elsewhere need to be stressed. As part of my research on Genovesi, I spent some time in Italy where I vi sited the Luigi Einaudi Foundation in Turin, the University of Naples Library, the National Library in Naples and the Italian Institute for Philosophical Studies, also in Naples. In addition, I had fruitful discussions with individuai scholars in Florence, Na ples and Turin. Continued correspondence with those scholars, and others in England, enabled me to keep abreast of the most recent publications of relevance to Genovesi research. The organisation of research data A basic assumption of this section is that a PhD Student will have limited time in which to research and write the thesis. The relevant methodology must therefore make provision for storing and retrieving a large volume of research data promptly and effi ciently. The computer enthusiast may consider establishing and using an appropriate data base. The more traditional method in volves the recording of research data on a card index system. A problem encountered in my early research on Genovesi was the lack of a comprehensive subject index for the various re prints of Genovesi's work. The préparation of modem compre hensive indexes for all the major works in the history of econo</page><page sequence="11">167 mies (and indeed for any work, major or minor, which is to be the subject of serious study) is essential. Volume 50 of Custodi's famous collection consists of a subject index for the many authors included in the sériés. However, since, as noted earlier, I had elected not to use Custodi's version of Genovesi's Lezioni or of any other of his writings, it became a matter of necessity to pre pare a subject index on cards for Genovesi's complete economie writings, that is, for the Lezioni (1768, 1770), and the relevant works included with Perna (1984) and Savarese (1962) A substan tial benefit of this time-consuming task was the close and analytic al reading of Genovesi's entire economic writings which it re quired. The above index was supplemented by a card index on the many authors referred to by Genovesi in his major work, the Lezioni. This too was an essential foundation for the research by contributing to my knowledge and understanding of the authors who influenced Genovesi's thinking. Examples include Aristotle, Hume, Montesquieu, and Plato. Together with the author indices for his other economic writings, for example, in Perna (1984) and Savarese (1962), I thus had at my disposai a comprehensive list of ali the authors referred to by Genovesi. My data base extended to a separate annotated card index of writers and commentators on Genovesi whose works I had con sulted. This index later served as the basis of the bibliography. The technique I used to organise my research data was simple but effective, and had the added advantage of being highly port able. Learning from experience - some afterthoughts Having completed the thesis, I now believe that the topic I chose was broader than I originally anticipated, making for a thesis of rather substantial proportions. To paraphrase Barry Gor don's paper, I "entertain[ed] ... [a] grand plan of a research agen da". This réservation acknowledges important constraints such as the prescribed length of the thesis and the time available for re search, writing and submission of the document. Implicitly, the</page><page sequence="12">168 title, "The Economic Ideas of Antonio Genovesi", committed me to a comprehensive, examination of Genovesi's ideas on a wide range of issues, which in the end occupied seven of the twelve chapters. On reflection, perhaps a title such as "Antonio Genovesi: Economist and National Reformer", would have per mitted me to deal more selectively with his economic ideas, there by emphasising the central argument about his status as a national economic reformer. A related problem was excessive length. This problem arose partly from the need to provide detailed quotations (in transla tion) from his writings in order to présent a comprehensive analy sis of Genovesi's economic ideas. Overcoming the excessive length of some chapters entailed a certain amount of re-writing and the amalgamation of earlier introductory chapters. The prob lem was therefore not insurmountable. Moreover, given my time constraint, it was preferable to have to abbreviate at this stage rather than to amplify contents with further research. The benefits of writing a PhD in the history of économies Any doctoral candidate in the history of économies hopes that the completed research represents a reasonably original con tribution to knowledge in the area concerned. If so, the work will be of benefit to the discipline, especially if it encourages further research. From a personal perspective there have been real benefits. Firstly, the thesis allowed me to use my knowledge of Italian to further my study of the history of economic thought. More im portantly, the research for the thesis on Genovesi necessarily ex tended well beyond his writings into other areas. Earlier it was indicated that understanding Genovesi's économies entailed the reading of works by authors who influenced his ideas or are men tioned in his writings. This was certainly one of the most signifi cant benefits of my PhD research. I read or re-read the works of many early economic writers including Cantillon, Galiani, Hume, Locke, Mandeville, Melon, Mirabeau, Montesquieu, Mun and Vauban. Parts of the thesis necessitated reading or rereading some</page><page sequence="13">169 of the writings of Jevons, List, Marx, Menger, Quesnay, Smith, Sir James Steuart, and Turgot. My research was assisted by the availability in Sydney of the wealth of documents in the Gold smith's Kress Library of Economie Literature. In short, writing the PhD has provided a wonderful opportunity to explore an aspect of the history of economie thought both intensively and extensively. The benefits of making contact with scholars and relevant research institutions, both in Australia and overseas, has been mentioned already. The latter provide a real basis for the pursuit of further research on Genovesi and other Italian economists, contemporary or otherwise. The quality and amount of supervision I reeeived was another rewarding aspect of my research. If the rôle of a PhD Supervisor is to encourage scholarship, challenge the student to do some worthwhile originai research, to read and comment con structively on numerous draft chapters, to discuss and résolve conceptual and other relevant problems on a regulär basis, my Supervisor more than fulfilled this role. Association with a good Supervisor can therefore be a major benefit of doctoral research. It was my good fortune and privilège to have an internationally rec ognised scholar directing my research. As a result of his own work on non-English economists such as Turgot, Cesare Beccaria and Pietro Verri, he was always conscious of the problems inherent in translating Genovesi's economie ideas from Italian into English. Good supervision made the period of my PhD candidature one of académie and personal fulfilment. Conclusion Those undertaking a PhD in the history of économies must ensure the proposed topic is feasible in terms of available research materials and a suitable Supervisor, and capable of making an ori ginal contribution to knowledge. A doctoral dissertation in the history of economie thought needs an initial structure, subse quently modified as the research progresses. A well structured thesis has to reflect coherent and convincing arguments. In the</page><page sequence="14">170 interest of true scholarship caution should be exercised in the éva luation of earlier economie ideas on the basis of subséquent con ceptual or analytical developments. While some 'errors' in econo mie thought or analysis are readily identifiable, others may be explained or at least understood in terms of the broader context in which they occur. Use of the best éditions of primary and secondary sources, needless to say, is fundamental. In addition, the varying quality of criticai commentary and the possibility of factual errors and mis leading preconceptions in secondary sources should be recognised at the outset as factors which can distract research and the conclu sions based thereon. Contact with other scholars and institutions is to be encouraged to keep abreast of the latest publications and research findings. Successful doctoral research requires suitable organisation of the appropriate data base. While the computer has many advan tages in storing and retrieving research data, the more traditional method of a card index system continues to have much to recom mend it, if only for portability. Indexing for yourself relevant works which have never been indexed can be a particularly useful research tool when evaluating the work of earlier thinkers. In this way, the research lessons absorbed when doing gradu ate research in the history of économies can be of use in later work, including publishing part of your findings. References Blaug, M.
