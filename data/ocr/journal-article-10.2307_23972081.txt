Subsequent editors have simply reprinted the published text. Hume's manuscript, how ever, is preserved in the library of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, and Professor Kemp Smith has now provided a new edition of the text based on the manuscript itself.1 The text is preceded by a full Introduction, dealing with Hume's relations to his Calvinist environment and with his views on religion in general, as well as with the Dialogues themselves and the problems in volved in their interpretation; and to the Introduction are added four Appendixes, of which Appendix C collects and discusses the evidence bearing upon the dates at which the Dialogues were written and subsequently revised, and upon Hume's arrangements for their posthumous publication, and Appendix D supplies a critical analysis of the argument with brief explanatory notes. The volume thus provides an accurate text and a full study of the work. This edition of the text quite certainly supersedes all earlier editions. Though much of the material contained in the Introduction and Appendixes is available in the biographies by J. H. Burton (1846) and Dr J. Υ. T. Greig (1931), and in Dr Greig's two volumes of The Letters of David Hume (1933), it has not previously been collected so completely and concisely, and the important evidence afforded by the manuscript itself is made fully available for the first time.

XXXVII.</page><page sequence="2">338 THE JOURNAL OF THEOLOGICAL STUDIES to the sense in which they express Hume's own opinions are a most important contribution to a series of problems which have perplexed commentators since the work was first published. Hume's nephew, then in his twenty-third year, appears to have carried out the task assigned to him under Hume's Will ;as the last Request of his Uncle' with care and accuracy, observing meticulously the directions contained in the manuscript itself: so far, therefore, Professor Kemp Smith's edition offers little that is new A note on the text explains that 'Hume's punctuation and spelling are followed throughout, save in a few cases where they are not in conformity with his practice in the works which he has himself supervised for publication. This also justifies us —as it justified his nephew—in not following the manuscript in its use of a capital initial letter for all substantives. In deciding which substantives should retain their capitals, Hume's own very sparing use of capitals in the Enquiries has (with allowance for his variations in usage) been taken as the standard' (p. xi). Hume's practice in writing appears to have been to use a capital initial letter for all substantives, though the use of a small initial letter is in general characteristic of his published works. Pro fessor Kemp Smith does not discuss reasons for thinking that this difference was due to Hume himself rather than to'his printer, and it might have been better to follow the manuscript in this respect also.1 1 Hume, of course, bestowed great care upon the text of his books, making changes of style as well as of substance in successive editions. There is evidence that he gave attention to the printing in other respects also; e.g. in addition to comments in his letters upon the appearance of his books, in a letter of 18 April 17,57 he wrote to William Strahan, who printed most of them : ' Please only to tell the Compositor, that he always employ a Capital after the Colons' (Letters, ed. J. Υ. T. Greig, i 24;). Here Hume appears as more conservative than his printer. Though the use of a small initial letter for substantives is in general characteristic of his published works, it is not followed consistently. It is followed, for example, in A Treatise of Human Nature vols, i and ii in 17 ^9, Hume's first book, and in vol. iii in 1740, though vol iii was issued by a different publisher, and in the authoritative edition of Essays and Treatises 1777, the printing of which Hume superintended, though it was published after his death ; the latter, no doubt, is the edition (vol. ii contains the two Enquiries) Professor Kemp bmith has taken as his standard. But, to confine attention to the Enquiries, a capital initial letter is used for substantives in the first edition of An Enquiry concerning the Principles of Morals 1751 (this is 12mo, not 8vo as stated in Essays, ed. Green &amp; Grose, vol. i p. 85) and in the second edition of Philosophical Essays concerning Human Understanding (afterwards called An Enquiry concerning Human Understanding) published in the Essays and Treatises of 1753.</page><page sequence="3">ARTICLE 339 The new and interesting feature of Professor Kemp Smith's edition of the text is the evidence it affords of Hume's corrections and additions during a period of about twenty-five years; and these are important for the interpretation of the Dialogues and for the study of Hume's thought. A letter of March 10. 1751 from Hume to his friend Gilbert Elliot makes it certain that at least a substantial portion of the Dialogues was written by that date; for Hume then wrote that he had sent a ' Sample' which clearly included at least somewhat more than the first three Parts.1 Probably, if not already complete, they were finished shortly afterwards. A letter of March 13, 763 י. again to Gilbert Elliot, shews that Hume was then deterred from publishing them only by the advice of his friends.2 Finally, in a letter to Adam Smith of August 15, 1776, ten days before his death, Hume wrote of the Dialogues: ' 011 revising them (which I have not done these 15 Years) I find that nothing can be more cautiously and more artfully written '3; which suggests a revision in 01־ prior to 1761 and a final revision at the time of writing. This external evidence of contemporary letters is confirmed and extended by the evidence of the manuscript. Small corrections occur on almost every page, and a number of longer additions are written on separate sheets and appended to the several Parts with marks to indicate their place in the text. Most of the corrections are small in extent,though not always unimportant; the more inter esting Professor Kemp Smith records in a clear and convenient form at the foot of the page. The additions he includes in the text (as did Hume's nephew), but encloses them in square brackets and adds a note explaining at what point they are appended in the manuscript. Two long and important addi tions, both in Part XII, appear to belong to a date different from that of the rest; these are enclosed in double square brackets. From the evidence of the manner in which the additions are appended, of the marks indicating their place in the text, of the handwriting, and of the paper used, taken in conjunction with the external evidence, Professor Kemp Smith argues convincingly that most of the corrections and additions belong to the period before 1761, but that the two additions in Part XII enclosed in double brackets were made in the final revision in 1776.

From the printed text and notes, together with the information contained in Appendix C, it is possible with the minimum of trouble to obtain a clear view of the state of the manuscript and of the evidence it affords. The editing could not have been done better or more compactly. The revisions do not indicate any marked changes in Hume's thought, though the additions include some of the most notable passages in the Dialogues ; but the two latest additions in Part XII are important for the interpretation of the argument. As Pro fessor Kemp Smith observes, these passages, both spoken by Philo the sceptic, are among the most definitely negative utter ances in the Dialogues, and indeed in Hume's writings on religion. Coming in the final Part, and the second as the words with which Philo concludes the whole discussion, they carry a special weight: and they still further emphasize the part played by Philo, who in Part XII takes complete control of the debate. To these con siderations must be added the circumstances in which this final revision was undertaken. Hume had long wished to publish the Dialogues,Dialogues, of which he wrote to Strahan in 1776, obviously en dorsing the opinion himself, ' Some of my Friends flatter me, that it is the best thing I ever wrote'1; but his friends dissuaded him. In the last year of his life, however, he took elaborate precautions to secure that they would be published after his death. In his Will, dated January, 1776, he left the manuscript to Adam Smith, desiring him to publish the work, a request he emphasized by a conditional legacy. Adam Smith urged him to leave publication in his discretion, and in May Hume con sented; but he was dissatisfied with this arrangement, and in June determined to print a small edition himself. His health, however, made it plain that he would not live to see their publi cation; he therefore revoked the clause in his Will and in the month of his death added a codicil leaving the manuscript to Strahan, his printer, with the request that it be published within two years of his death, and, to avoid all risk, he added the condi tion that if not published within two and a half years the property was to return to his nephew,' whose Duty, in publishing them as the last Request of his Uncle, must be approved by all the 1 Letters ii 323.</page><page sequence="5">ARTICLE 341 World Thus it came about that his nephew edited them for publication in 1779. Had the additions made to th&amp; Dialogues whilst he was engaged in these elaborate precautions been of a moderating kind, little importance could have been attached to them; but, since they are of a very different character, likely to increase instead of to diminish the scruples of his friends and since at the same time they occupy so prominent a position at the conclusion of the argument, they must be regarded as especially important evidence of Hume's opinions and intentions. The three speakers are Cleanthes, a Natural Theologian, who relies entirely upon the argument from design and makes no appeal to revelation, the sceptical Philo, and the rigidly orthodox Demea. The conversations are reported by Pamphilus, the pupil of Cleanthes, to his friend Hermippus; and it thus falls to Pamphilus to recount their occasion and, at the conclusion, to pronounce his verdict, which he gives appropriately in favour of his teacher. Professor Kemp Smith, differing from most recent commentators, though agreeing in general with Leslie Stephen and Τ. H. Huxley, contends ' that Philo, from start to finish, represents Hume; and that Cleanthes can be regarded as Hume's mouthpiece only in those passages in which he is explicitly agreeing with Philo, or in those other passages in which, while refuting Demea, he is also being used to prepare the way for one or other of Philo's independent conclusions' (p. 76). He recognizes, of course, that Hume's own teaching ' is developed in and through the argument as a whole, something of his own beliefs being put into the mouths of all three [characters]' (p. 74). Hume was too great a master of dialogue to fall into ' that vulgar Error ... of putting nothing but Nonsense into the Mouth of the Adversary'1; and in this respect, though hardly in charm and purity of style, the Dialogues concerning Natural Religion Religion are superior to the earlier masterpieces of Berkeley. But he entirely rejects the contention—often supported by the assumption that the final verdict of Pamphilus must be also the verdict of Hume—that of the three speakers Cleanthes repre sents Hume's own position most nearly. Professor Kemp Smith expounds and defends his contention by a detailed analysis of the whole argument (Introduction, Section V, and Appendix D) Letters i 154: a passage in which Hume is writing of the Dialogues.</page><page sequence="6">342 THE JOURNAL OF THEOLOGICAL STUDIES and by a comparison of the Dialogues with Hume's other writings, especially The Natural History of Religion and An Enquiry concerning concerning Human Understanding, Section XI (Introduction, Section IV). Though certain difficulties remain—the chief being the two passages quoted and discussed on pp. 88 if.—the conclu sion reached appears to be decisive. As Professor Kemp Smith says, Hume's policy was to state his sceptical positions ' with the least possible emphasis compatible with definiteness' (p. 94) and to leave the reader free to draw his own conclusions from the argument. This enabled him to avoid infringing the conven tional limits in the expression of opinions in conflict with the prevailing theological opinions of the time, and it was entirely in accord with his temperament. Hume was by nature tolerant; he had no belief that the vulgar—or indeed the orthodox—would ever forsake their superstitions and fanaticisms, and he was therefore at no pains to force his own sceptical opinions upon them. This policy afforded him at the same time an opportunity of exercising his dramatic skill in dialogue. Cicero's De Natura DeorumDeorum was his principal model. Both dialogues are prefaced by an introductory section, and Hume's concluding paragraph is modelled directly upon Cicero's; but, unlike Cicero, Hume no where speaks in his own person, the conversations being reported by Pamphilus, the pupil of Cleanthes—a device which enables Hume to represent Cleanthes as the hero of the piece whilst giving the real though unavowed victory to Philo. The orthodox Demea, who withdraws before the debate is completed, un wittingly plays into the hands of Philo, and by maintaining the insufficiency of reason and the evils of the world in support of his belief in revelation enables Hume to prepare the way for his own sceptical conclusions whilst avoiding the open discomfiture of Cleanthes. As Hume virtually admitted, writing to Gilbert Elliot in 1751,1 Cleanthes has stated his main arguments by the close of Part III and has little of substance to add to them after wards ; but by a series of skilful devices, such as the friendship of Philo and Cleanthes, the division of the Dialogues into Parts and consequent intervals in the discussion, and an element of irre sponsibility in the manner of Philo, the dramatic quality of the conversations is preserved to the end, even though in the last 1 Letters i 157.</page><page sequence="7">ARTICLE 343 two Parts Philo takes complete control. Dr Greig has suggested that' Philo proved too strong for his creator; he ran away with him. . . . But to say that Hume allowed Philo to run away with him is only another way of saying that he failed to realize the strength and significance of the Philoesque elements within his own thought.'1 This is a conclusion which neither suits Hume's character nor does justice to his ability. It is true that Hume had difficulty in strengthening sufficiently the part of Cleanthes— this he himself admitted2; but the explanation is surely not that he י failed to realize [the] philosophic worth' of Philo's criti cisms but that Philo's arguments, not those of Cleanthes, were Hume's own. An important element in Professor Kemp Smith's thesis is that, whilst Philo throughout maintains and developes a consistent position (apart from his conventional and obviously insincere references to Faith and Revelation), Cleanthes and Demea shew no such self-consistency. In Demea's case this is undisguised ; but Professor Kemp Smith shews that Cleanthes fails signally to answer Philo's criticisms, whilst in arguing against Demea he sometimes shews an acumen lacking in the defence of his own position. This is important as shewing how erroneous is the view that in the end Philo and Cleanthes reach something like agreement. They are, indeed, throughout in a considerable measure agreed in their attack upon Demea ; but, in so far as they appear to reach final agreement, it is only that Cleanthes fails to answer directly Philo's attack upon the argument from design upon which he himself throughout rests his case. It is in the light of these conclusions that Professor Kemp Smith discusses Hume's own position and the arguments— essentially those of Philo—by which he leads up to it (see especially Introduction, Section III). Pamphilus in his intro ductory account of the circumstances'of the conversations dis tinguishes the two questions of the being and of the nature of God. The first he represents as a question not open to doubt, whilst the second is recognized as full of obscurity and difficulty —very much the position of Cleanthes. The distinction is observed in the Dialogues in so far as the earlier Parts are con cerned mainly with the 'natural attributes of intelligence and design', whereas the last three Parts are occupied mainly with 1 David Hume p. 236 C. י Letters i 153 ff.</page><page sequence="8">344 THE journal of theological studies the ' moral attributes'. A common interpretation of the Dia logueslogues is that the outcome of the whole argument is to establish the sufficiency of the evidence for the being and ' natural attri butes' of God, even Philo in the end assenting, whereas his 'moral attributes' and' plan of providence' remain uncertain and obscure. But, if Professor Kemp Smith's main contentions are admitted, this is a superficial interpretation which overlooks the intention and originality of the work. The Dialogues in their main intention are a criticism of the validity of the argu ment from design as such, not merely of its sufficiency for establishing the moral attributes of God and the character of his plan of providence. Hume is thus attacking what at the time was generally admitted to be the very citadel of religious belief. This explains the cautious manner in which he set about the task ; and it explains also, even if it does not justify, the desire of his friends to prevent, or at least to delay, publication. The a priori argument for the existence of God—a combined form, as Demea states it, of the cosmological and ontological arguments— is indeed dealt with also ; but it forms a digression, and its refutation, though very acute, is brief and is assigned to Cleanthes, Philo of course assenting. To appreciate the full force of Hume's attack, it is necessary to recognize the nature of the argument as it was current in Hume's time—the argument afterwards so well stated by Paley. ' This argument', writes Professor Kemp Smith,' it cannot be too emphatically insisted, is not a teleological argument of the Aristotelian type. It does not, that is to say, consist in the thesis that the natural order, with which man is so integrally bound up, fulfils an end of absolute and intrinsic worth. It is an essentially anthropomorphic type of argument, resting upon an alleged analogy between natural existences and the artificial products of man's handicraft. We can, it was maintained, gain a sufficient basis for the conception of God as an ordering intelli gence in our knowledge of the self and of its relation to the pro ducts which it consciously designs' (p. 36 f). This is the argument throughout relied upon by Cleanthes. ' Our friend, CLEANTHES, replied Philo, as you have heard, asserts that, since no question of fact can be proved otherwise than by experience, the existence of a Deity admits not of proof from</page><page sequence="9">ARTICLE 345 any other medium. The world, says he, resembles the works of human contrivance : Therefore its cause must also resemble that of the other' (Part VII). Hume effectively exposes the weakness of this argument from analogy. Philo continues: ' Here we may remark, that the operation of one very small part of nature, to wit man, upon another very small part, to wit that inanimate matter lying within his reach, is the rule by which Cleanthes judges of the origin of the whole; and he measures objects, so widely disproportioned, by the same individual standard' (Part VII). The argument, if really an argument merely from analogy, should lead us to assimilate the relatively few and exceptional existences—the products of human handicraft—to the more numerous and usual—inanimate matter as a whole, not to the inverse procedure.' The analogy is still further weakened when it is represented as holding between the process of human manufacture—of which we have experience—and divine creation —of which we have none, and the conclusion drawn from it is rendered correspondingly insecure. Moreover, the argument assumes that natural existences ' do not, any more than artificial products, contain an inherent principle of order, i.e. that they are not ·«־//"-ordering; and this was supposed to be especially evident in the case of vegetable and animal organisms י (p. 37); hence an "external Designer was concluded to as their cause. Professor Kemp Smith points out how natural this argument was in view of the atomist and materialist theories then widely current: ' those who adopted atomism (or some modified version of it, such as that advocated by Descartes) as a hypothesis to account for for physical happenings, were precisely those who supplemented it—Voltaire is a notable instance—by a theistic superstructure י (p. 37). Hume agreed that such atomism was insufficient to account for the order of the world—Philo speaks of ' the old EPICUREAN hypothesis' as 'commonly, and I believe, justly, esteemed the most absurd system, that has yet been proposed' (Part VIII)—but he urged that theism was not thf only alterna tive. In the passage in criticism of Cleanthes just quoted, Philo proceeds: ' I affirm, that there are other parts of the universe (besides the machines of human invention) which bear still a greater resemblance to the fabric of the world, and which 1 Cf. G. F. Stout Mind and Matter pp. 43 ff.</page><page sequence="10">346 THE JOURNAL OF THEOLOGICAL STUDIES therefore afford a better conjecture concerning the universal origin of this system. These parts are animals and vegetables. The world plainly resembles more an animal or a vegetable, than it does a watch or a knitting-loom. Its cause, therefore, it is more probable, resembles the cause of the former' (Part VII). Hume fully recognizes that some ' principle of order' is involved in the world, and in comparing the world to an animal or a vegetable he is suggesting that this principle may be sought more probably in ' generation or vegetation י—such life as is found in the lower organisms—than in the intelligence and design of a creative mind, especially as we see the higher arise from the lower, never the lower from the conscious contrivance of the higher, and ultimately the one is as unintelligible to us as the other. ' In this little corner of the world alone, there are four principles .reason, instinct, generation, vegetation, which are similar to each other, and are the causes of similar effects. . . . Any one of these four principles ... (and a hundred others which lie open to our conjecture) may afford us a theory, by which to judge of the origin of the world ; and it is a palpable and egregious partiality, to confine our view entirely to that principle, by which our own minds operate. Were this principle more intelligible on that account, such a partiality might be somewhat excusable: But reason, in its internal fabric and structure, is really as little known to us as instinct or vegetation' (Part VII). Again: ' Were I obliged to defend any particular system of this nature..., I esteem none more plausible than that which ascribes an eternal, inherent principle of order to the world; though attended with great and continual revolutions and alterations. This at once solves all difficulties; and if the solution, by being so general, is not entirely complete and satisfactory, it is, at least, a theory, that we must, sooner or later, have recourse to, whatever system we embrace. How could things have been as they are, were there not an original, inherent principle of order somewhere, in thought or in matter ? And it is very indifferent to which of these we give the preference י (Part VI). The criticism of the inference to the moral attributes of God occupies a much smaller space in the Dialogues, though it includes some of the most brilliant passages and forms the climax of the work. Cleanthes, who has already made important concessions,</page><page sequence="11">ARTICLE 347 now more readily admits the strength of Philo's position, though he never abandons his own. י Here, CLEANTHES, I find myself at ease in my argument. Here I triumph. Formerly, when we argued concerning the natural attributes of intelligence and design, I needed all my sceptical and metaphysical subtilty to elude your grasp. . . . But there is no view of human life, or of the condition of mankind, from which, without the greatest violence, we can infer the moral attributes, or learn that infinite benevolence, conjoined with infinite power and infinite wisdom, which we must discover by the eyes of faith alone' (Part X). The world, as we actually find it, may indeed, for all we know, be consistent with the existence of a ' powerful, wise, and benevo lent Deity ', but can never suffice to establish his existence. But underlying the whole of this portion of the argument is Hume's naturalistic doctrine of morals, according to which moral distinc tions are purely relative to the special constitution of human nature and have no .meaning or validity apart from it. Some of the hypotheses advanced by Philo have, no doubt intentionally, a somewhat irresponsible air; but they are in harmony with the almost wholly negative conclusion with which Philo closes the debate. The whole of natural theology ' resolves itself into one simple, though somewhat ambiguous, at least un defined proposition, that the cause or causes of order in the universe probably universe probably bear some remote analogy to human intelligence'; this proposition is ' not capable of extension, variation, or more particular explication'; it affords ' no inference that affects human life, or can be the source of any action or forbearance'; and ' the analogy, imperfect as it is, can be carried no farther than to the human intelligence; and cannot be transferred, with any appearance of probability, to the other qualities of the mind ' (Part XII). This passage, placed at the end of the Dialogues and apparently added shortly before his death, may reasonably be taken as Hume's own conclusion. It is negative, sceptical, rather than dogmatically atheistic. The 'cause or causes of order in the universe' remain mysterious and unknown to us; we have no means of ascertaining them more fully, or of deciding between the many hypotheses that offer themselves to our imagination. Though Hume retains the name God, it is only in this ' somewhat ambiguous, at least undefined ' sense; and ' true</page><page sequence="12">348 THE JOURNAL OF THEOLOGICAL STUDIES religion '—as contrasted with superstition and fanaticism—is represented as ' nothing but a species of philosophy ', that namely of the philosophical sceptics. In further explanation of his interpretation of the Dialogues, Professor Kemp Smith in his Introduction refers to two impor tant questions, though to one of them only briefly. First, though Hume's ' natural theology' amounts to little more, on its positive side, than the recognition of an unknown 'principle of order' in the world, he does at least recognize the reality of such a principle. Commentators, Professor Kemp Smith thinks, have misinterpreted the Dialogues because they have sought to interpret them ' in the light of his doctrine of detached impressions, and this doctrine in the light of the very misleading account which he gives of it in the opening of the first volume of his Treatise י; ' they fail to observe that the impressions upon which Hume mainly relies at the chief turning-points in the developement of his philosophy are the im pressions not of sensation but of reflexion, and that these impres sions are of a biological character—instincts and passions, propen sities and sentiments, by no means appropriately describable as detached—and rest, as Hume recognizes that thought (or reason) itself rests, upon a complication of secret causes' (p. 34 f, cf. p. 44). In the Preface, he holds out the hope of writing more fully on ihis topic, i.e. upon Hume's theory of knowledge as a whole. Secondly, in the first two Sections of the Introduction, he gives an illumi nating account of Hume's considered attitude towards religion in general, and in particular towards that form of Calvinistic Christianity with which he was most intimately acquainted. He concludes that there is ' little of the sceptical inquirer in Hume's writings on religion. Once he had succeeded in formulating the general lines of his own philosophy, he had quite definitely con eluded that religion is not merely an ambiguous but in the' main a malign influence' (p. 13). Above all he hated the fanaticism and narrow dogmatism which, in his view (and he had more than a little justification), religion encouraged, and what appeared to him to be the artificial life it fostered. He was accordingly inclined to prefer the superstition and polytheism of antiquity to the forms of Christianity he found about him, since the former weighed less heavily upon men's minds and had less influence upon their conduct.</page><page sequence="13">ARTICLE 349 The Dialogues caused less stir than Hume's friends had antici pated ; they also exercised less influence than the originality of their destructive criticism merited. Kant, who read them in the manuscript translation of Hamann in the year following that of their publication, was the first to recognize that, as a refutation of the argument from design in the form then current, they were unanswerable: and he was able to incorporate their main argu ment in the Critique of Pure Reason in 1781. But it was against the limited argument from analogy, now best remembered from Paley's statement of it, that Hume's criticism was final, not against the thesis that, since matter apart from mind seems essentially indifferent to teleological order, and mind essentially teleological, the teleological order actually found in the world must be accounted for in all its aspects by the presence, in some form, of mind.
