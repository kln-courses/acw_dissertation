Further, there would have to be judicial acceptance of the view already taken in matri- monial legislation that a monetary value can be placed on non- financial contributions to the family and home. Whether the current House of Lords would be prepared to be so innovatory seems doubtful as is indicated by their refusal to hear an appeal in Burns. In the event, therefore, it is left to Parliament to make the fates kinder to cohabitants. N. V. LOWE* ANDREW SMITHt WHEN DOES A CORPORATION FORGET? INTERROGATORIES are an important part of English legal procedure. A court may order a party who answers them insufficiently to make further answer.' A person answering on behalf of a company2 must state not what is known to him as an individual but what is within the knowledge of the company. But what does a company "know"? Does it have the same "knowledge" for all legal purposes? And when does it forget what it has known? A company, decided Sir Robert Megarry V.-C. in Stanfield Proper- ties Ltd. v. National Westminster Bank P.L.C.,3 must make reason- able inquiries in answering interrogatories not only of existing, but also of its "former officers, servants or agents" unless they have disappeared or left a long time before. The inquiries need not become a "pursuit of ancient history"; the test is reasonableness. Any person "who is an obvious source of knowledge" must be questioned: "If he is not, the company should say why."4 This is the functional approach to the question of corporate knowledge, tailoring to the purpose in hand the net of human persons whose knowledge will be ascribed to the company. It has 22 See e.g. Scott on Trusts (3rd ed., 1967), Vol. V, Chap. 13 especially at pp.3417-3418. How far the English courts have already done this on occasion is a matter of debate.

It has a "brain and a nerve centre which controls what it does" and "hands which hold the tools," under directions from that centre, "mere servants or agents who are nothing more than hands to do the work." The state of mind of the "hands" is not the state of mind of the company; but the intention of the "directors and managers who represent the mind and will of the company" is the company's intention.7 Both civil and criminal law have encountered difficulties in using this "identification" approach. Which managers other than directors, for example, are part of the "nerve centre"? In regard both to negligence and to criminal offences the functional tendency has grown to include whatever layers of management are appropriate to the issue.8 The "fault" of top management below the board may be personal to the company but that of superior employees is not9; and the knowledge of a servant is not that of the company for the purpose of aiding and abetting.10 Shareholders, even when voting in general meeting, are not identifiable with "the company" itself11; and the company will be directly procured to act in breach of contract only when the inducement reaches it in the form of a person "who has authority on the company's behalf to make contracts," not any other managerial agent.12 Whilst, therefore, the metaphysical approach may be a colourful guide, it does not lead beyond the foothills of the problem. The man who is the company's hand for one legal purpose may need to be transplanted into its heart or brain for another. Thus, the company secretary, after being largely excluded from the nerve centre, has in recent judgments gradually been admitted to a more prominent 5 See L. H.

Lord Sumner stressed that a company is not "deemed automatically to know everything that appears in its ledgers."19 One may ask, though, whether such a principle is so unthinkable in the days of computer- ised information. Should it be able to forget information which is easily retrieved? Twenty years ago, an incorporated parish council was found to have knowledge of facts (gaps in a playground slide) both because its minutes recorded them 16 years before (the repairs having meanwhile disintegrated) and because some councillors were on the council at both dates.20 Clearly, the extent to which a corporate body is permitted to "forget" its ledgers or escape the knowledge of managers or ex-managers must depend upon the technology available and the liability, or right, in issue. The conspiracy cases illustrate the twists and turns of the functional approach. Where conspirator-directors people the boardrooms of various companies, their knowledge and purpose is attributed to companies who are the court's target as parties to a civil conspiracy (or as recipients from persons acting in breach of trust) whilst the "victim" company is shielded.21 But in criminal conspiracy, although a company can conspire with its director, the need for two "minds" is relied upon to overtake liability for an alleged combination between a controlling director and his wholly owned company.2 13 See Panorama Developments v.

What the company knows or should know will depend on the purpose of the necessary inquiry, not upon any anthropomorphic concept of what a corporation "is." Indeed, Pro- fessor Hart's inaugural lecture surely administered to that question the coup de grace.5 But there are still problems. While the company may justly be required to answer in interrogatories for what its servants and former servants know, it would be absurd to draw the boundaries of its knowledge that wide for most other purposes. Legislation frequently assumes that a company has a certain "knowledge," "intention" or "purpose."26 Parliament should now confront the burgeoning uncer- tainties of the functional approach, and, free at last from the ghosts of Gierke and Dicey, turn its attention to the meaning of those concepts in order to make provision in designated areas of law27 for statutory guidelines or presumptions for future judicial inter- pretation. W. SEX DISCRIMINATION AND THE EUROPEAN COURT: CAN COMMUNITY LAW LEAD TO MORE EFFECTIVE ENFORCEMENT? THE United Kingdom has once more been found to be in breach of its obligations under the EEC Treaty. In its recent judgment handed down in the enforcement action Commission v. United Kingdom,' the Court of Justice of the European Communities held that the United Kingdom had failed to enact provisions necessary to give effect to the EEC Directive on the implementation of the principle of the equal treatment of men and women as regards access to employment, vocational training and promotion, and working con- ditions ("Equal Treatment Directive").2 This case follows the con- 2 See Re A Company [1980] 1 All E.R. 284 (rev'sed on other grounds sub nom.
