<plain_text><page sequence="1">'Arierdammerung': race and archaeology in Nazi Germany Bettina Arnold Abstract Archaeological evidence under the auspices of the National Socialist regime was exaggerated, misrepresented and otherwise abused in various ways to support contemporary military and social agendas, ranging from invasion to genocide. This chapter will review and analyze the complex interplay between several organizations within the Nazi party from 1933 to 1945 that were actively involved in promoting or conducting archaeological research designed to underwrite the 'racial hygiene' agenda of the regime. Not only do the roots of this deadly symbiosis pre-date the twentieth century, they were neither uniquely German nor ultimately able to flourish unchallenged even in a totalitarian regime with all the oppressive mechanisms for social control at its disposal. Keywords National Socialism; archaeology; eugenics; race; gender. [R]emembering for a purpose is, after all, one version of what it means to write history. (Sarah Wintle 1987: 12, Introduction to Kipling, Puck of Pook's Hill) Genocide is, after all, the ultimate exercise in community-building. (Philip Gourevitch 1999) Archaeological evidence under the auspices of the National Socialist (NS) regime was exaggerated, misrepresented and otherwise abused in various ways to support contemporary military and social agendas, ranging from military expansion to genocide (Arnold 1990, 1992, 1998, 2002, 2004). The complex dynamic between various Nazi Party organizations that were actively involved in promoting or conducting archaeological research designed to underwrite the 'racial hygiene' agenda of the regime provides the framework of analysis for this discussion. Several excellent edited volumes have recently appeared in German that make it possible to flesh out the historical background necessary for an analysis of the destructive symbiosis between archaeology, politics and race that has O Routledqe World Archaeology Vol. 38(1): 8-31 Race, Racism and Archaeology |\ Tayior&amp;Frandscroup @ 2006 Taylor &amp; Francis ISSN 0043-8243 print/ 1470- 1375 online DOI: 10.1080/00438240500509744</page><page sequence="2">'Arierdammerung': race and archaeology in Nazi Germany 9 become a permanent legacy of this period (Kuhnen 2002a; Leube 2002; Steuer 2001). I hope to show that not only do the roots of this deadly symbiosis pre-date the twentieth century, they were neither uniquely German nor ultimately able to flourish unchallenged even in a totalitarian regime with all the oppressive mechanisms for social control at its disposal. In a September 1934 address of the NS-Frauenschaft, the main women's organization of the Nazi Party, Hitler outlined what he saw as the two main elements of the Nazi program: 'A fanatical "will to power" based on the reassertion of male/female difference and a rejection of the "Jewish doctrine" of equality between the sexes' (Stibbe 2003: 1). Under National Socialism, race and gender were inextricably tied to one another through the essentialist opposition of the inherently, i.e. genetically, superior Aryan/masculine and the inferior Jewish/feminine. This is one of the reasons that any analysis of how archaeological research informed ideas about race in the Third Reich cannot be carried out without addressing the evolution and expression of ideas about gender. Race in National Socialist Germany was tied directly to biological as well as social reproduction, and as a result the political construction of the new nation depended on contributions from physical anthropology and archaeology with respect to the expression and nature of both race and gender. However, as has been pointed out by several scholars (Bock 1998: 94; Stibbe 2003: 4), although the basic principles of patriarchy, including male domination and female subordination, were an essential part of Nazi policies, racial hierarchies were given precedence over gender hierarchies. The Nordic peoples were represented as simultaneously the most superior and the most vulnerable of the world's races, and in the absence of an understanding of the role of genetic mutation in human morphological variation, light-skinned, light-haired, light-eyed people were perceived as having necessarily had an evolutionary trajectory separate from the 'ugly, dark peoples' (Clement 1840: 4) of the rest of the world (Wiwjorra 2002: 84). To National Socialist ideologues the German people were a race at risk, in the throes of what Otto Ammon, a physical anthropologist known for his nineteenth-century craniometric studies, first referred to as an ' Arierddmmerung' (Puschner 2002: 54). This threat, in the form of genetic as well as cultural swamping, was represented as a conspiracy between Catholic Rome, the Romance language-speaking nations and the Slavs, all of whom were participating in the drawing of a noose around the new German Reich from the Adriatic across Austria to Poland on the one side and from Switzerland and Lorraine to Belgium on the other (Puschner 2002: 55; Wirth 1912: 317). Internally, the threat was presented as originating from assimilated Jews and other undesirable racial elements. This perception can be seen not only in the writings of physical anthropologists and archaeologists, but also in the works of major nineteenth- century literary figures like Theodor Fontane. The use of organic imagery by Fontane in the following description of the Jews in Germany aptly illustrates how the threat represented by such alien internal elements was perceived by many: Es ist, trotz all seiner Begabungen, ein schreckliches Volk, nicht ein Kraft und Frische gebender 'Sauerteig', sondern ein Ferment, in dem die hdfilicheren Formen der Gdrung lebendig sind - ein Volk, dem von Uranfang an etwas dunkelhaft Niedriges anhaftet, mit dem sich die arische Welt nun mal nicht vertragen kann. (They are, in spite of all their talents, a terrible people, not a sour dough which lends freshness and strength, but a</page><page sequence="3">10 Bettina Arnold ferment, in which the uglier forms of leavening thrive - a people associated since their earliest beginnings with a kind of arrogant meanness that simply cannot be endured by the Aryan world.) (Benz 2000: 159; cited in Johnson 2005) x Roots of racism in National Socialist Germany The discomfort, unease, ambivalence and even repulsion felt by many Germans toward the Jews reflected in the passage by Fontane quoted above (whose work would not be characterized as overtly anti-Semitic by most scholars today) reverberates in the world of nineteenth- and early twentieth-century academic scholarship as well, including the work of German Jewish scholars positioning themselves relative to the Jews of eastern Europe (Aschheim 1982). Two disciplines particularly affected were archaeology and physical anthropology, both strongly influenced by the ideas of Joseph Arthur Comte de Gobineau (1816-82) on the one hand and Charles Darwin (1809-82), filtered through Ernst Haeckel (1834-1919) and Houston Stewart Chamberlain (1855-1927), on the other. One of the fundamental principles of the National Socialist racial program, the so-called Alleingel- tung der Nordrasse (sole validity of the Nordic race) (Dow and Bockhorn 2004: 174), drew heavily on the work of Gobineau and Chamberlain. Gobineau was a proponent of the 'inequality of nations' concept, which held that all the world's peoples could be organized according to a distinct hierarchy based on their innate abilities, and that some races were biologically and culturally inferior to others, ideas he put forward between 1853 and 1855 in a series of publications, including The Inequality of the Human Races (1967 [1916]). Gobineau's assertion that the Nordic peoples were the bodily and intellectually superior race was to have its most extreme expression in the genocidal program of the Third Reich. Chamberlain had emigrated to Germany from his native England at age 15, settling in Austria, where he married Richard and Cosima Wagner's daughter Eva and in 1899 first published a tome entitled Die Grundlagen des neunzehnten Jahrhunderts (The Foundations of the Nineteenth Century) (Chamberlain 1902). This peculiar melange of racial theories and philosophical musings served as the model for Nazi ideologist Alfred Rosenberg's equally convoluted and bizarre Der Mythus des 20. Jahrhunderts (The Myth of the Twentieth Century), in which he argued, among other things, that Christ was not a Jew (Rosenberg 1930). Folklore, physical anthropology and archaeology were not as clearly divided into subfields in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries as they are today, and in many cases scholars worked and published in more than one of these areas. This was especially true of research that addressed the problem of the origins of the German people, a topic that preoccupied various scholars following the end of the Franco-Prussian War. Foremost among these was perhaps the prehistorian and physical anthropologist Rudolf Virchow (1821-1902), known among other things for his misinterpretation of early Neanderthal finds. In 1881 he undertook an expedition to the Caucasus expressly to investigate the origins of the Germans on the basis of anthropomorphic and archaeological evidence. He returned from his trip in a rather chastened state of mind, and concluded that it was impossible to say with certainty which of the tribes still to be found in this region might have</page><page sequence="4">'Arierdammerung': race and archaeology in Nazi Germany 1 1 given rise to the German people (Wiwjorra 2002: 85). Interestingly, Virchow was a vocal critic of what he saw as politically motivated scholarship based on nationalist aims. He argued that to suggest that the Germans represented a superior form of human life was as much of a fallacy as the claims of the ancient Jews that they were the chosen people (ibid.: 91), a good example of the complex and often contradictory attitudes and approaches to race and cultural evolution prevalent among scholars at the turn of the century. Wilhelm Heinrich Riehl, generally considered the founding father of German Volkskunde, was one of the first explicitly to link the material and cultural expression of folklife to nationalism, arguing that ' Volkskunde is the foyer of state (political) science' (Dow and Bockhorn 2004: 6). The work of Leopold von Schroeder (1851-1920) was similarly influential, largely due to his conviction that 'All great intellectual advancement by humanity, for thousands of years, consists of nothing other than the further development of individual Aryan tribes' (1914-16: 188, quoted in Dow and Bockhorn 2004: 11). The link between folklore and archaeological research conducted under the auspices of the National Socialist regime can be found in the popularity of such authors for Himmler, Rosenberg and other high-ranking party members (Lutz 1958: 32). The various strands of scholarship and pseudo-science that made up the National Socialist ideological program in 1933 can be traced back at least to the late 1800s, as has been recognized by numerous scholars, including the well-known ancient historian Ludwig Curtius, who stated 'Whoever desires to understand the rise of National Socialism in Germany must begin at the turn of the century' (1950: 240, quoted in Puschner 2002: 50). The historian Frantisek Graus expressed a similar sentiment in a 1969 publication: 'It is easy to reproach historians (and intellectuals in general) who lived through a totalitarian regime for an absence of courage; but the actual roots of the problem, the actual blame, must be laid at the feet of those who shared in the evolution of such systems well before that epoch' (Graus 1969: 93, quoted in Fehr 2001: 357). What was new after 1933 was not the individual elements that made up the racial program of the National Socialist regime, but the particularly insidious concoction produced by combining them with Gustaf Kossinna's (1858-1931) ' Kulturkreis' concept (Kossinna 1921; Veit 2002). This synthesis suggested that it was possible to map and track the millennia of struggle between the 'long skulls' (Aryan-Germanic peoples) and the 'round heads' (various eastern races, including Slavs and Jews) (Puschner 2002: 55) in the archaeological record based on ethnically distinct material culture distributions. Once the utility of this concept had been recognized (well after Kossinna's death in 1931), the cooption of archaeology for political purposes by the regime was inevitable (Veit 1989). Prehistoric archaeology would be conscripted into identifying the cradle of the Aryan cultural progenitors in northern and central Europe, characterized by an uncompromised, pure Germanness that would provide the template and the basis for the rebirth of the German race through a return to its origins (Puschner 2002: 57). Handmaidens of genocide National Socialist ideologues approached the study of the archaeological past with a preconceived notion of what was to be found there, based in large part on the</page><page sequence="5">12 Bettina Arnold pseudo-scholarship of Gobineau, Chamberlain, Riehl, Kossinna and other nationalist and racist interpretations of the prehistoric and historic records. This effectively made hypothesis testing and scientifically derived archaeological research programs difficult if not impossible to carry out after 1933, unless they could be packaged in a way that conformed to the agenda of Party officials. The task of archaeology was preeminently expedient: 'to preserve the treasures of German prehistory and lift them out of the shaft of the past to make that past relevant for our life today' (Reinecke 1896: 2-3, quoted in Puschner 2002: 58). Hans Reinerth, the top archaeological operative in the Rosenberg Office, was even more explicit about the role archaeological research was expected to play in the construction of German cultural identity: German archaeology is for me ... indigenous, blood-bound Germanic and Indo- Germanic prehistory. In no way should it be concerned with the history of Roman or Slavic alien cultures on German soil Our spadework has the preeminent goal ... of illuminating our hitherto neglected indigenous prehistory. Anyone who opposes this effort ... is a pernicious threat to the German people and should be fought accordingly. (Heuss 2000: 143; Unruh 2002: 169) In the Third Reich, race was intended to replace class as the primary organizing principle of society, with no place afforded for lesser races or those deemed biologically unfit (Burleigh and Wippermann 1991: 4; Stibbe 2003: 59). The defining characteristic of the National Socialist state was the emphasis placed on biological solutions to social problems, including poverty, alcohol and drug addiction, mental illness, and criminality (Stibbe 2003: 71). To understand how the National Socialist state in Germany developed and what drove it, we will have to examine those disciplines that had something to contribute to the ideological platform of the party, particularly archaeology, physical anthropology and folklore. We need to ask not only how the regime benefited from the cooption of those disciplines, but also what those disciplines, especially prehistoric archaeology, received in return. The Faustian bargain German prehistoric archaeology between 1918 and 1933 is frequently represented in various contemporary contexts as unappreciated and under-funded, a kind of Cinderella figure waiting passively for a savior (Arnold 1990). The redeeming of the Cinderella of prehistoric archaeology by National Socialism is one of the persistent metaphors used by politicians and archaeologists alike even after Hitler's rise to power in 1933, and continues to be part of the story told today in the attempts made by prehistorians to make sense of the cooption of their discipline (Hassmann 2002a; Hebben 2002: 95). Part of the reason so little has been written about the role of prehistoric archaeology in the creation and maintenance of the National Socialist state can be found in this Cinderella story (Arnold and Hassmann 1995). The linguist-turned prehistorian Gustaf Kossinna, considered by many to be one of the chief architects of the political exploitation of archaeology under National Socialism (Griinert 2002; Steuer 2001), made this redemption a leitmotif of his</page><page sequence="6">'Arierdammerung': race and archaeology in Nazi Germany 13 writings, as did the much-reviled Tubingen prehistorian and highest-ranking archaeologist in the Rosenberg Office, Hans Reinerth (Schobel 2002). The Cinderella motif first appears in the period just after the First World War, when German prehistoric archaeology begins to be represented as the neglected and abused stepsister of Classical and Near Eastern archaeology, but it becomes a major theme after Hitler's rise to power. This perspective can be seen in official government rhetoric as well as in professional publications, as in the following statement by Staatsminister Schemm in the foreword of a 1934 issue of the Nachrichtenblatt fur Deutsche Vorzeit: In our youth the term antiquity had come to represent almost exclusively the Classical civilizations of Greece and Rome, and we remained unaware that these peoples emerged from the blood and spirit of the Nordic races and carried their cultures south, there to further expand and develop them This is why we support the primacy of German pre- and proto-history in our schools. (Schemm 1934: 129-30) A more specific bitterness echoes in the following line from the same journal issue in an article by the prehistorian K. H. Jakob-Friesen: frequently in the past many thousands of Marks would be spent outfitting expeditions to foreign countries rather than providing us with a few hundred Marks to investigate our indigenous cultures Every university has a chair in Classical archaeology, but at the time of Kossinna not a single chair for the study of the Germanic past was to be found! That we have managed in spite of the ham-stringing of our discipline to bring it to its present-day level is our proudest achievement! (Jacob-Friesen 1934: 131) The so-called Barbarenluge (lie of barbarity), which represented the Germans as a primitive people in stark contrast to the glories of Greek civilization, plays a role here as well, and can be seen not only in the works of archaeologists but in the writings of literary figures, as in the following quote from Fontane's novel Frau Jenny Treibel, published in 1892: 'Diese schreckliche Verwandschaft zwischen Teutoburger Wald und Grobheit ist doch mitunter storend' (This horrifying presumed relationship between the Teutoburger Wald and primitiveness is beginning to become truly irritating) (1974: 354, quoted in Johnson 2005). The racial underpinnings of the simultaneous redemption of Germany and of German prehistoric archaeology can be found in numerous publications dating to the period between 1933 and 1945. The following report of the SS-Ahnenerbe's research and teaching association (the Ancestral Heritage Association, a brainchild of Heinrich Himmler) at Kiel in 1939 provides a particularly good example: According to its charter, the Research and Teaching Association 'Ancestral Heritage' has as its mandate the investigation of the distribution, spirit, deeds and legacy of the Nordic Indogermanic peoples, to bring its research results to life and to transmit these to the public The ethnos and the German people consciously and expediently</page><page sequence="7">14 Bettina Arnold determine the content of our research. In our scholarship the only thing that matters is the German people, our German Volk In order to achieve these great goals, German Volkskunde seeks as a discipline to explore all those race-historical as well as supra- historical, temporally contingent as well as timeless, conditions of German folk-life . . . and to make those observations useful again to the Volksglauben. We have the unbelievable good fortune to live in a large ethnic community based on spirit as well as blood. (Harmjanz 1939: 9-15) 'Ex oriente lux' vs. 'Ex septentrione lux' The glorification of the Nordic/Germanic people in the Third Reich was inextricably tied to the denigration of the non-Nordic elements of the Classical civilizations of Greece and Rome, which were perceived as tainted by their close proximity and regular contact with African and Middle Eastern (i.e. Semitic) peoples and cultures. Following the rediscovery in the sixteenth century of Tacitus' writings, which included highly idealized descriptions of the Germanic people (Arnold 1998), and the anti-Roman (i.e. Catholic) sentiment that accompanied the Reformation, there was an upsurge of interest in identifying a uniquely Germanic history starting with the annihilation of three Roman legions in the Teutoburg Forest by a Germanic tribal confederacy in 9 AD. To so-called Deutschgldubige, this was a watershed year not only because it stopped Roman expansion eastward (Wells 2003) but also because it marked the beginning of Germanic vdlkisch awareness (Puschner 2002: 55). Year One of this Germanic calendar was 9 AD (Kroll 1921), much as the Battle of the Nile in 1798 represented the beginning of calendric reckoning for members of the British Navy during the Napoleonic Wars. This anti-Mediterranean attitude was part of the positive response by so-called 'Germanomaniacs' (Arnold 1990: 470) to the excavations and 'discoveries' at the Externsteine near Lippe, not far from the Hermann monument erected to commemorate both the destruction of the three legions of Augustus and the end of the Franco-Prussian war (Arnold 1998). Uta Halle has recently published an extensive book-length treatment on the exaggeration, fabrication and glorification of this site and its significance in the history of the SS-Ahnenerbe (Halle 2002a, 2002b). According to the pseudo- archaeological interpretation of the site put forward by the excavator, Julius Andree, and others, the Externsteine were the center of the spiritual Germanic universe until the solar sanctuary there was destroyed by Charlemagne during his campaign to convert the Saxons to Christianity (Halle 2002b: 237). As Holy Roman Emperor and King of the Franks, Charlemagne was derided by National Socialist ideologues as 'Carl the Saxon-Slaughterer' (Arnold 2006) because of his association with the Catholic hegemony of Rome, the recent military conflict with France during the First World War and Charlemagne's extermination of one of the last strongholds of pagan Germanic culture. The political usefulness of archaeology quickly became evident to the National Socialist Party, as did the benefits of Party support to prehistorians. Concepts of Germanic racial unity and continuity, the cornerstones of the eugenics program, could be given a significant time depth by prehistoric archaeology while the geographic distribution of material culture could be used to map ethnicity, providing the justification for territorial</page><page sequence="8">'Arierdammerung': race and archaeology in Nazi Germany 15 expansion. A significant part of this program was the denigration of the 'ex oriente lux' concept (Wiwjorra 2002: 86). This is clearly articulated in a speech by Martin Jahn at the Second Reichstagung of the Reichsbund for German Prehistory in Bremen in 1935: Europe has been the transmitter of all the truly great discoveries and explorations of world history The awareness of European origins and the recognition of an old and yet new perspective on world history has made the internal discrimination possible that today innately and confidently discriminates and discards much that has come down to us from Syria and Babylon, recognizing it as foreign and forever alien. (Meier 1935: 186) According to a contributor to the volkisch journal Hammer in 1912, 'lux ex septemtrione' [sic], in German: 'The light came and has always come out of the North!' (Khull-Kholwald 1912, quoted in Wiwjorra 2002: 88). Wiwjorra also notes, in a piece published in 1921 in the volkisch journal Politisch-Anthropologische Monatsschrift, that the 'ex oriente lux' theory was represented as a conspiracy of Jews and Freemasons (ibid.), while some scholars who felt compelled to accept the ancient eastern civilizations of Sumer and Babylon as a major source of cultural impulses argued that, even if 'ex oriente lux\ it had not come out of Israel (Eisele 1980: 292). Walther Schulz, in a 1935 article in which he describes the goals and functions of the Landesanstalt fur Volkheitskunde, provides the following list of disciplines contributing to the study of the German people: 1) prehistory, which investigates the origins and development of the German people from earliest times on; 2) the folk traditions associated with the course of the year and with individual human life cycles; 3) racial and physical anthropology, particularly of the Nordic, German and Central European German peoples (Schulz 1935: 114). A good example of the inextricable link between archaeology and race in the reconstruction of the origins of the German people (Arnold 2002: 98-102) is the 1846 publication entitled Rdthsel der Vorwelt, oder sind die Deutschen eingewandert? by Wilhelm Lindenschmidt (1806-48), elder brother of the archaeologist Ludwig Lindensch- midt (1809-93), who specifically questioned the Asiatic origins of the Germans without completely ruling out any contributions from southern regions (Wiwjorra 2002: 84). On the other hand, Lindenschmidt concluded that 'the Germans alone are the truly white men' (1846: 46, quoted in Wiwjorra 2002: 85). 'The Germans alone are the truly white men' Eugenics, or what was referred to in the publications at the time as Rassenhygiene (racial hygiene), was one of the cornerstones of NS racial policy, although the pseudo-scientific principles on which this program rested predate Hitler's rise to power. It is worth pointing out here, even though it has been said many times before, that this was by no means a uniquely German phenomenon. Similar 'racial hygiene' programs, aimed at maintaining a 'healthy' gene pool, were in existence in many other European nations after the First World War as well as in the United States and Great Britain (Kiihl 1994; Martens 2002;</page><page sequence="9">16 Bettina Arnold Schafft 2004; among many others). A representative example of such racial hygiene programs is the journal Volk und Rasse, edited by Hans Zeiss (Fehr 2001), which claimed to be an 'illustrated quarterly of German Volkstwrt (Fig. 1) and in 1926 sponsored a competition for the 'best Nordic racial head', male and female, awarding prizes (500 Marks for first place) to photographic entries showing side and frontal views (irresistibly reminiscent of police mug shots) based on a series of subjective morphological criteria deemed to represent the ideal Germanic type (Plate 1). Eugen Fischer, the author of the report, proudly notes that the two judges agreed in their classifications in 80 per cent of the 793 male and 506 female citizens who had submitted their photographs to this competition in 1926. He concluded that this unanimity was the result of a partly innate, partly acquired template, the latter based on a lifetime of experience and scholarly study. At the same time, he reveals that the majority of the entrants belonged to the educated and professional classes, including members of the nobility and their children, while laborers, farmers and ordinary citizens were under-represented (Fischer 1927: 4-5). Fischer was the leading physical anthropologist in Germany at the time of Hitler's accession Figure 1 Cover of Volk und Rasse Vol. 3, July 1929, showing idealized female and male Germanic heads.</page><page sequence="10">'Arierdammerung': race and archaeology in Nazi Germany 17 Plate 1 Volk und Rasse Vols 1-2, 1926-7: 11-28: head shots from article illustrating racial types.</page><page sequence="11">18 Bettina Arnold to power, but in spite of his nationalist and conservative political leanings he was viewed with suspicion because of his ambivalence regarding racial mixing, which he believed could have some positive outcomes. He was brought in for questioning shortly after the National Socialists took power, and thenceforth apparently toed the party line with a truly impressive consistency (Schafft 2004: 71). Close examination of individual biographies for many Nazi party operatives shows a similarly expedient attitude toward the regime's policies. As Stibbe and others have shown, 'upward mobility and career enhancement were the key aims, followed closely by opportunities for self-enrichment through involvement in corruption' (Stibbe 2003: 79; see also Unruh 2002: 172). Several important recent publications have provided a wealth of new data regarding the extent to which racial ideology and scholarship became intertwined in German research initiatives between 1918 and 1945. A particularly good example is the exhibition catalogue that accompanied the 2002 exhibit Propaganda. Macht. Geschichte. Archdologie an Rhein und Mosel im Dienst des Nationalsozialismus, edited by Hans-Peter Kuhnen, Director of the Rheinisches Landesmuseum in Trier and several colleagues (Kuhnen 2002a). The title is a telling play on words: 'Propaganda. Power. History' = 'propaganda makes history', when the resulting sentence is translated from the German. One of the examples cited in this publication illustrates the extent to which notions of racial and cultural continuity permeated all areas of life in Germany during this time. Otto Schmidt, Stadtbaumeister (Chief City Planner, the most influential and important civil service position after the mayor) of the city of Trier between 1927 and* 1939, did not restrict his activities to the architectural realm. His 'GroBer Trierer Plan', if it had been implemented, would have radically and permanently altered the city's layout, mainly at the expense of the medieval architectural core. He also drafted a new city guide for Trier, in which he described the Trierer Land as 'ureigenstem [germanischen] Siedlungsgebief (originally Germanic territory) since 3000 BC and held forth on the 'race question' in the Eifel and the Hunsriick regions. In support of his arguments, Schmidt drew upon finds of terracotta Roman figurines that he argued demonstrated the existence of anti-Semitism in antiquity (Kuhnen 2002a: 252). The history of the interpretation of these figurines, which has been related by Christina Hebben (2002), is bizarre but instructive. In Volume 6 of the Trierer Zeitschrift, published in 1931, an article appeared written by the head rabbi of the Jewish congregation in Trier, Dr Adolf Altmann, entitled 'The earliest appearance of the Jews in Germany: the Jews in Roman Trier' (Altmann 1931). Altmann attempted to demonstrate the antiquity of his religious community in the town using as evidence a series of Roman terracotta heads with prominent noses, which he identified as caricatures of Jews. In 1940 an article with the title 'The oldest Jewish caricatures: the Trierer terracottas' appeared in an anti-Semitic series of publications entitled Forschungen zur Judenfrage. Author Gerhard Kittel exploited Altmann's conclusions nine years earlier for National Socialist purposes, arguing that there must have been a reason Jews were being caricatured in Roman Trier. Pointing out that several of the figurines also have erect phalluses, he concluded that even back then the Jews were associated with Rassenschande, racial desecration, i.e. rape (Kittel 1940: 250-9, paraphrased in Hebben 2002: 135-6). Here we can see clearly how vulnerable archaeological evidence, itself mute, is to having meaning inscribed upon it, and how potentially destructive such cooption can be.</page><page sequence="12">'Arierdammerung': race and archaeology in Nazi Germany 19 Other manifestations of the symbiosis between National Socialist racial policies and the archaeological past can be found in the relabeling of chronological phases as 'Germanic', irrespective of linguistic or historical data to the contrary. A good example is the otherwise methodologically sound excavation report published by Werner Buttler and Hans Schleiff in 1939 of their work on the Erdenburg hill fort near Bensburg in the Rhineland. They refer to pottery of 'Germanic Late La Tene' type (1939: 224), describe the 'Germanic strata of the early Roman fort near Hofheim' (ibid.: 226) and date the hill fort itself to the first century BC. They specifically avoid describing the Erdenburg as an oppidum, Caesar's term for the distinctively Celtic fortification systems he encountered during his campaigns in this area, choosing rather to use the term 'Wallburg', which does not have any particular ethnic association (ibid.: 227). They conclude that the site 'most likely can be considered a fortification of the Germanic tribe known as the Sugambri', based on Caesar's designation of this group as 'the invincible vanguard of Free Germany' on the right bank of the Rhine (ibid.). It is worth mentioning here that the distinction Caesar made between the left and right Rhine bank groups he encountered (Celtic vs. Germanic, respectively) has been questioned by a number of scholars (for a summary, see Wells 1999: 99-121). There is an irony here in that both Caesar and National Socialist archaeologists were assigning ethnic identity to material culture and language evidence based on politically expedient agendas. The archaeology of Lebensraum The Slavic populations of eastern Europe, particularly Poland, large parts of which were lost to Germany after the First World War and were high on the list of territories to be regained or acquired by German military expansion (Arnold 1990: 467), were also represented as inferior to the Germanic peoples in order to justify the occupation and seizure of such regions. As early as the nineteenth century, German publications describe the Slavic peoples as primitive, based on their supposed preference for a fishing, hunting and gathering rather than a settled agricultural way of life (Brather 2001: 484), with various archaeologists in the early twentieth century emphasizing the 'impoverished' nature of Slavic culture. The rhetoric becomes increasingly shrill in the course of the 1930s as Germany begins to gear up for the invasion of Poland (ibid.: 489-90). Several archaeologists addressed this issue explicitly, notably Bolko von Richthofen (brother of the First World War flying ace), Wolfgang La Baume and Wilhelm Unverzagt, among others. This can be clearly seen in the following passage from a grant proposal submitted by Wilhelm Gaerte to the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) for excavations in East Prussia in 1938: Compared to the other provinces of the Reich, prehistoric archaeological research in East Prussia deserves particular attention and care. Situated at the extreme boundaries of the nation, East Prussian archaeology has had to fight the spiritual battle for the homeland on two fronts. On the one hand it is essential to fend off Polish attacks on the prehistory of the east . . . one cannot stand idly by while the Polish press negatively influences world opinion on the subject The second front ... is Lithuania.

(Bundesarchiv Koblenz Call No. R 73/11161) Also significantly, the regime did not always walk the talk, as the saying goes. In spite of significant increases in support for prehistoric archaeology in west-central and eastern Europe from 1933 on (Arnold 1990: 468; Pape 2002), the Reichs Minister of Finance authorized more money to be spent on the German excavations at Olympia during the war years than had ever been spent on a single excavation on German soil. From 1939 to 1945, the excavations at Olympia were supported by Reichsministerium grants of 60,000 RM a year (Bundesarchiv Koblenz Call No. R 21/11026). The fact that the continuing financial support of Classical archaeology on such a large scale was resented can be seen in the following internal Reichsfuhrer-SS (RF-SS) memo dated 22 November 1938 regarding a grant proposal to the RF-SS for the excavation of a late Roman villa: Since in our opinion the moneys made available by the RF-SS for excavation should as a first priority go toward researching Germanic pre- and proto-history, we cannot countenance spending such an exorbitant sum (2,000 RM) on the excavation of a late Roman villa, particularly since the Archaologisches Institut des Deutschen Reiches ([AIDR], today's Deutsches Archaologisches Institut [DAI]) is responsible for the excavation of Classical antiquities. (Bundesarchiv Berlin-Zehlendorf Call No. NS 21/313) Hero tales In addition to being anti-Roman, anti-Slavic, anti-Semitic and expansionist, the regime was also explicitly anti-urban, with the city frequently represented as a 'racial tomb' and the countryside as an agrarian Utopian womb for the regeneration of the race (Puschner 2002: 58-9). The romanticization of rural life ties in with the National Socialist meta- narrative of the German people as characters in their own folktale (Arnold 2002: 103-6). The German Volk is the gender-male protagonist in the hero tale of the origins of the German people, but subplots within this story repeat the pattern of obscure birth, trial, journey, testing, failure and near ruin, redemption, and ultimately triumph (ibid.). The metaphor of redemption extends to the medium of prehistoric archaeology, which finally came into its own after 1933 by providing evidence for a glorious past to be reclaimed through military triumph and racial purification (Fehr 2001: 388). The basic narrative structure of this hero tale can be parsed as follows: 1 . The hero (the German Volk, gender male) has humble origins and is unappreciated and underestimated by his contemporaries. 2. Whether by choice or compulsion, the hero is dislodged from his home, a departure leading to a journey/adventure/quest. 3. The hero must survive a series of tests, often in the form of a harsh environment.</page><page sequence="14">'Arierdammerung': race and archaeology in Nazi Germany 21 4. Exceptional gifts are provided to the protagonist of the hero tale by a beneficent power or 'donor' (in the case of Nazi ideology, this takes the form of genetic superiority produced as a direct result of first-class material tempered by extreme conditions, followed by geographic isolation in northern Europe as a bar to miscegenation and the 'weakening' of the race). The 'tempering' process (a misapplication of evolutionary theory) included warfare. The Second World War was seen by some as a necessary purification of the European nations, which would lead to the rejection of materialism and a return to archaic values (Kater 2004: 8), for example. 5. Additional testing, in the case of the NS meta-narrative, occurs in the form of migration out of northern Europe by some populations. Movement south and east leads to intermarriage and 'pollution', although the cultures of Greece and Rome benefit significantly by the cross-fertilization. These migrant groups succumb to pride and hubris and are destroyed (read: genetically swamped) by the inferior southern and eastern populations. 6. Finally, the redemption of the Volk is achieved after patient waiting in the northern homeland is rewarded by the arrival of a leader/guide (which is of course precisely what the word Fuhrer means) who will put the hero/German people back on the 'right road' and lead them to ultimate triumph through military superiority. How was this meta-narrative transmitted to the German population after 1933? In a number of ways, from instruction in schools (Hassmann 2002b), to documentary and propaganda films (Stern 2002), radio programs, public lectures and tours, museum exhibits (Hebben 2002; Keefer 1992; Kuhnen 2002b: 28-39; Schnitzler et al. 2002; Schobel 2002) and publications, including popular journals. The title of Hans-Peter Kuhnen's contribution to the Propaganda. Macht. Geschichte. volume reveals very clearly the nature of the role played by institutions and individuals in underwriting the programs of the regime: '"Without exception they [archaeologists and museum professionals] put their best efforts... at the service of the Party and its various entities": The Rheinisches Landesmuseum Trier in the service of National Socialism' (Kuhnen 2002b). Museum displays often explicitly linked past and present, as in the case of the Deutsche Grosse exhibit in StraBburg in 1942, subtitled '200 Jahre Kampf am Rhein' (200 years of battle over the Rhine) (Schnitzler et al.: figure 2). Archaeology and history played an important role in instruction particularly at the high-school level, presenting the histories of the Germans, the Indo-Germans, the Vikings, the position of women and the bond of blood between contemporary and past Germanic peoples (ibid.). Among other themes, the guidelines for instruction in German schools included inculcating in the youth of the new Reich a sense of 'the fateful battle for the inception of the German people', with an emphasis on the 'joyful willingness to sacrifice oneself for Volk and fatherland' (Hassmann 2002b: 111). That the ultimate goal was to produce cannon fodder, albeit highly motivated and trained cannon fodder, is clear from the allocation of time given to academic instruction (one and a half hours) vs. sports (five hours) in the Adolf Hitler Schulen and similar instructional venues (Kater 2004: 50). Embedded in archaeological instruction were concepts such as racial hygiene, anthropo- metric measurements and the identification of ancestral homelands of the Germanic</page><page sequence="15">22 Bet Una Arnold peoples in the east, represented as occupied by Slavic squatters (Frenzel 1935: 33, quoted in Hassmann 2002b: 112). The concept of 'de-Nordification', specifically the extinction through genetic swamping of the 'higher' Nordic racial type by the 'lower' non- Aryan races, also found its way into such expositions, including a guidebook for teachers published in 1935 with the subtitle 'The new material' (ibid.: 113). Poster-sized, 70 x 100 cm graphic representations of German prehistory (so-called Schulwandbilder) were one of the more widespread and effective ways of simultaneously broadcasting concepts of race and gender on the basis of supposed archaeological evidence (ibid.: 114); they were distributed to schools throughout Germany and in many cases continued to be used after 1945 (ibid.: 115). On all of these instructional posters the people are represented according to the idealized Nordic template: tall, well built, with blond or brown hair and light eyes (Fig. 2). In a sense, it could be argued that archaeology, through various media, produced an * Ariernachweis' (the documents required to prove that one was of 'pure' Germanic descent after the passing of the Niirnberg Laws in 1935) for the German people (ibid.: 128). Heroes and hero-incubators The Nazi state was fundamentally misogynist as well as racist. Sex and race were both viewed in essentialist terms. Men were represented as creators, women as procreators, children as bearers of the race. The biologically defined volkisch state was to be ruled by laws of male supremacy and was in need of women who could give birth to future warriors (Kater 2004: 74). The ultimate goal was not the repression of women per se, but the Figure 2 Racially idealized Bronze Age 'Germans' engaged in a 'sun cult' ceremony.</page><page sequence="16">'Arierdammerung': race and archaeology in Nazi Germany 23 'reconstruction of society along racial lines' (Stibbe 2003: 3). At least in the early years of the regime, women were systematically directed away from the idea of a full-time career and towards starting or extending a family. To this end a generous system of interest-free marriage loans of up to 1000 Reichmarks (about a fifth of the average annual take-home pay) was introduced in 1933 to families in which women devoted themselves to motherhood (ibid.: 40). Likewise, unmarried men and, after 1938, childless couples, were required to pay 10 per cent more income tax than individuals and families with children 'as a punishment for their "refusal to multiply'" (Fortpflanzungsverweigerung) (ibid.: 50). The ideal German woman was by definition a mother. The goal was to increase the number of 'racially desirable' births (ibid.: 41) among women of appropriately 'pure' breeding. Women with four or more children received the 'Honor Cross of the German Mother' (Kuhnen 2002a: 290), which came in three grades: bronze for four children, silver for six and gold for eight or more, the last awarded by Hitler himself. The Honor Crosses were awarded for the first time on Mother's Day in May 1939, with three million women being awarded the title 'Mother of the Reich' in special national ceremonies (Stibbe 2003: 42). Members of the Hitler Youth were required to salute anyone wearing such a cross, and any woman wearing one was entitled to skip to the head of a queue, which must have caused considerable tension during the war years when food and other commodities were strictly rationed. In spite of such incentives, the average number of children born to SS families never rose above 1.5. With the outbreak of war in 1939, this reproductive incentive program became even more urgent but at the same time more and more women were needed in the workplace to fill in for men who were dying in increasing numbers in the front lines, effectively putting an end to the successful implementation of such racially motivated 'breeding schemes'. Children were viewed as essential to the success of the realization of the planned millennium, since they would assume leadership positions in the coming Reich (Kater 2004: 11). In the Adolf Hitler Schulen (AHS), subjects emphasizing the German past and racial superiority were stressed and 'foreign languages were to be studied for the sole purpose of communicating orders to future subject peoples' (ibid.: 50), but ultimately, at least for boys, 'love of war and the readiness to embrace a hero's death' were the primary focus of instruction (ibid.). The Bund der Deutschen Madel (BDM) and the Hitler Youth (HJ) were both organized not only to provide a captive audience for training the future leaders of the Reich (in the case of the HJ) but also to socialize its future breeders (in the case of the BDM) (ibid.: 97). Even in this context, the archaeological and historical records were invoked as supporting authorities: 'Eugenically, these young women were expected to be fit to bear children, at least three in their lifetime, in accordance with the assumed feminine ideal of the Germanic tribes of two thousand years ago, who, Himmler said, were "racially outstanding'" (ibid.: 98). A major component of Nazi policy was predicated on the idea that women were to be valued or not valued based on their reproductive capacity, i.e. whether or not they were suitable breeders from a racial, biological and social point of view (Stibbe 2003: 4), and the ideal Germanic hero-incubator can be seen represented in contemporary media as well as in the pedagogical images used to convey the 'Germanic' past to the young in schools and other educational contexts (Fig. 3). Racism and sexism were two sides of the same coin in the Nazi treatment of those women considered to be</page><page sequence="17">24 Bettina Arnold Figure 3 An image from Gustaf Kossinna's 'Die deutsche Vorgeschichte: eine hervorragend nationale Wissenschaft' monograph published in Mannus-Bibliothek 93 (1921): figure 11: the victorious return of Bronze Age warriors from an overseas military expedition. Note gender stereotypes: the woman in the foreground holds a child (presumably a boy, since he carries a bow) by the hand, while two women in the upper right-hand corner of the picture are also accompanied by two small children, and one holds a bundled infant in her arms. Interestingly, however, the woman on the left does not seem to be accompanied by a child, and has a dagger or knife at her belt. undesirable as breeders (Stibbe 2003: 60), which is why the representation of both race and gender in the prehistoric past on the basis of archaeological research played such an important role in the construction of these policies. The BDM program included the transmission of the 'governing anti-Semitic canon' regarding the 'necessity for a "racial rebirth" of the German people on the model of a racially pure German Volksgemeinschaft. German girls were to be the guardians of "German blood, German culture, German way of life and customs, physical and spiritual health and correctness'" (ibid.: 99-100). Kater reports that, at the height of the war, an intermediate BDM leader announced to her charges: 'By destroying the Jews, I am doing the work of the Lord' (Kater 2004: 100). The main burden of the eugenic program for the preservation of the Volksgemeinschaft devolved upon the 'racial conscience of the nation' (ibid.: 103), the German girl whose role was to be a 'guardian for the purity of the blood and the people, in order to bring up heroes from among the sons of the Volte (Moller 1935: 118-19). Most women were willing to go along with such policies for many of same reasons that motivated archaeologists to cooperate with the regime: 'Men would never relinquish their power, women could never wrest it from them; hence many concluded that the only effective women's strategy lay in cooperating with men and reaping protection as a reward'</page><page sequence="18">'Arierdammerung': race and archaeology in Nazi Germany 25 (Koonz 1987: 12). On the other hand, nostalgia for a supposed 'traditional society' in which women played a passive, supporting role, as represented in many archaeological reconstructions, also contributed to the appeal of such images to the average German. 'Of course the hope of restoring the lost family was based on a misunderstanding of historical fact and in any case stood no chance of being realized in an industrialized society' (Koonz 1987: 177-8). There were other problems with this imagined prehistoric Utopia. Propaganda, supported in part by reconstructions of the family in the past as derived from archaeological evidence, may have exalted the family, but actual social policy undercut it, especially once war had broken out. The mixed messages transmitted by the regime with respect to the 'natural' role of women became even more pronounced after 1939 (Stibbe 2003: 45), as more and more women began to enter the workforce, including a handful of female archaeologists (Konig 2002: 189). Not surprisingly, there was significant pressure on SS men to marry. Himmler issued a 'Procreation Order' for SS men in November of 1939, and barred men from promotion if they did not beget children (ideally sons) (Kater 2004: 97). At the Wewelsburg fortress in Biiren near Paderborn, Himmler held marriage ceremonies for the SS elite based on a freely re-imagined neo-Germanic religion (Arnold 2006; Huser 1982: 37-8), which included polygamous unions. 'Bridal schools' trained and schooled the fiancees of SS men in ideologically correct thinking as well as making the perfect Germanic home for the ideal German hero, all in a six-week long course. The SS-sponsored Lebensborn program, which provided maternity care for racially desirable women, was also part of the scheme to encourage an increase in the number of children born to SS men, with or without the sanctity of marriage (Stibbe 2003: 156). If women were primarily viewed as hero-incubators, the male role was clearly that of warrior. According to an article by Emma Witte in Die Deutsche Zeitung published in 1924: The coming racial state must be masculine - or it will not be at all! Only men are in a position to overcome the state of female powerlessness which led us on towards the criminal act of revolution. Only a battle-hardened [and] ideologically armed people will conquer freedom for itself, will be able to assert itself as a nation! Only on its sword will Germany's future security rest. (Witte 1924, quoted in Stibbe 2003) Folklorist Rudolf Much and his students viewed German Volkskunde as the part of German antiquity concerned with continuity, the far-reaching, unbroken living on of Germanic cultural capital in legends, fairy tales, customs and beliefs, and part of that cultural capital was the ideal of the male warrior (Dow and Bockhorn 2004: 61). Here again the pedagogical images produced to represent archaeological discoveries provide a sense of the deep-seated nature of this trope. Virtually every adult male depicted is carrying weapons (sword, shield, spear, axe or dagger), on foot or on horseback. Those without weapons are depicted behind a plow or officiating at ceremonies (Fig. 3). The Mdnnerbund (men's union) concept played a role in the construction of this male world, drawing on cultures with all-male, closed societies based mainly on the cult of the warrior, including the retinue or comitatus and the related Gefolgschaft. Kater suggests that 'the</page><page sequence="19">26 Bettina Arnold authoritarian and militaristic persona of teachers like the older Himmler eventually blended easily with the ideal of totalitarian educators which the Third Reich espoused', and educators with military experience in the first World War would have been seen as role-models because of their war service (Kater 2004: 41). Conclusions Men were born to wage war to protect racially desirable women whose role was to bear children and maintain a nurturing home environment: this was the simple and essentialist message sent by the state, backed by the authority of several millennia of selectively interpreted and (mis)represented historical and archaeological evidence. As Stibbe has argued, the exclusion of women from the public sphere of politics and war was a crucial element in ensuring the survival of the Nazi regime and the success of its racist and expansionist policies, which could be realized only if women were given no real say in decisions over life and death. Significantly, as some scholars have argued, the National Socialist regime was in fact more anti-women than pro-life in its policies, institutionalizing birth control rather than banning it altogether (Bock 1986 cited in Stibbe 2003: 60). The forced sterilization or genocide of the 'unfit', also characterized as 'useless eaters' or 'life unworthy of life' (Stibbe 2003: 73), clearly demonstrates that the regime's attitude toward female reproduction did not involve individual choice or privilege life. Birth control was seen as an unnatural phenomenon specifically associated with urban (read: Jewish) life, which was presented as the antithesis of the clean, rural, reproductively fertile and natural state of the ideal Germanic family (Puschner 2002: 61). Another significant point is that the foundations of the German racial state were laid before the First World War, and the essential concepts, motifs, mental patterns and enemy imagery, including the representation of women as inferior to men, were already in place well before the National Socialists came to power (ibid.: 63). Archaeology, like physical anthropology and biology, was seamlessly integrated into the ideological program of the National Socialist state in a way that made independent action virtually impossible and resulted in policies that affected all aspects of life in Germany and occupied territories at the time, including race and gender relations (Konig 2002: 190). The conflation of various disciplines under what T. C. Chamberlin would have called the ruling theory of race (Chamberlin 1965) continues to characterize pseudo-scholarship today, which frequently involves attacks on the 'ex oriente lux' concept (Wiwjorra 2002: note 126). There are echoes of this melange of pseudo-scientific ideas about race and prehistory in some manifestations of neo-pagan movements as well, partly drawing on the anti-Christian attitudes of nineteenth-century and National Socialist authors (Wiwjorra 2002: 98), partly linked to an emerging global white pride movement (Gardell 2003), demonstrating yet again that this is neither a uniquely German phenomenon nor something we can safely relegate to the past (Arnold 1999). Rather it indicates that professional archaeologists must remain vigilant against the multifarious forms of pseudo-scientific racism in the co-option of their research.
