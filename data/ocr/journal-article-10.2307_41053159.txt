Wells1 Examination of the archaeological evidence for the expression of identity in later European prehistory provides a new and promising approach to understanding change in this period. New views of the role of material culture in the communication of meanings, of the nature of identity, and of agency in the past provide a useful framework for approaching the evidence. Analysis of patterns of sameness and difference in style and decoration of manufactured objects indicates how people used their material culture to structure and to communicate their identities- on the level of the individual, of groups such as families and residential communities, and of larger entities commonly referred to as ethnic groups. This approach offers insights that complement social and economic models of change in later prehistory. KEY WORDS: identity; ethnicity; material culture; Iron Age. INTRODUCTION An important new development in the study of later European pre- history is a growing interest in examination of the subject of identity among the indigenous peoples of the continent, particularly in relation to their conquerors, the Romans (Rieckhoff, 1995; St√∂ckli, 1993). The principal fo- cus of this concern has been on cultural or ethnic identity, but other aspects of the subject are also being explored. This approach offers a new and different way of viewing the later prehistory of temperate Europe. Over the past couple of decades, most synthetic studies have emphasized eco- nomic and social approaches.

This approach does not conflict with the economic and social ones, but complements them. It helps to add another dimension to our growing un- derstanding of the processes of change in this context. In a sense this issue is an old one, since the idea that the prehistoric archaeology of Europe embodied the material culture of the Celts, Ger- mans, Illyrians, and other peoples named and described by Roman and Greek writers played a major role in the development of the discipline in the 19th centuiy (Kuhn, 1976). But critical studies in recent decades (e.g., Collis, 1996; Fitzpatrick, 1996; Hachmann et al, 1962) have shown that the old approaches- equating the producers of particular archaeological styles with peoples named by Classical writers- were not satisfactory. We under- stand now that old and still much-heard queries such as "Where did the Celts come from?" and "Where did the first Germans live?" are asking the wrong questions and hence can never yield satisfactory answers (Chap- man, 1992, 1993). More recent research on these questions (e.g., Jones, 1996; Thomas, 1996) employs more theoretically informed approaches de- rived in large part from research results in different branches of cultural anthropology and critical social theory (Calhoun, 1995). The essence of the issue of identity in prehistoric archaeology is the question, How did people use their material culture to define themselves as individuals, both in relation to other individuals and in relation to social groups? Three basic ideas have been most instrumental in opening the possi- bilities for these new approaches to issues of identity in prehistoric Europe. One is the view that material culture is not just the means by which humans interact with their physical and social environments, but an active agent that people use to construct meanings and to communicate information to others. In modern archaeology, this approach has been developed most fully by Hodder (1979, 1982, 1989) and his successors (Shanks and Tilley, 1987). Thomas (1996) has recently explored the complex interrelationships between people and manufactured objects. On the one hand, people make or otherwise acquire objects that have particular meanings for them; on the other, in the process of making and using objects people imbue them with meanings. The significance of particular objects changes as people use them. Thomas (1996, p. 159) suggests that what he calls "complex arti- facts"- objects that bear some degree of decorative elaboration- represent "networks of significance." One of the kinds of significance that such ob- jects communicate is information about the identity of the individuals who make and use them.</page><page sequence="3">Later Prehistory of Central Europe 241 The second new approach that is changing our view of material culture and identity in European prehistory is the idea that identity is not a static attribute of an individual or a group, but a dynamic, flexible, and contingent property always in a state of change. This theme has been developed and elaborated by cultural anthropologists and sociologists (e.g., Barth, 1969; Bentley, 1987; Eriksen, 1993) and has been applied productively to archae- ological research in a number of different contexts in Europe (e.g., Jones, 1996; Kobylinski, 1991; Shennan, 1989, 1991). Ethnographic studies con- tinue to play an important role for modeling archaeological applications. Our new understanding of this dynamic and contingent aspect of identity poses a powerful challenge to traditional attempts to link specific archae- ological assemblages with peoples identified and named by the Greek and Roman authors (Wells, 1995a). The third new perspective is the application of the concept of individ- ual agency to the study of archaeological contexts. European archaeology traditionally has made little effort to deal with individuality in prehistoric societies. In cultural anthropology, too, concern with understanding the in- dividual as a distinct entity, rather than only in terms of the individual's membership in social groups, is a relatively new development (e.g., Cohen, 1994; Eicher and Sumberg, 1995; Eriksen, 1993). All humans have free will and can exercise it to some degree, however restrictive cultural rules might be. People make choices and decisions within the circumscribed social sphere in which they live. Just as each person today is a unique individual, and every person thinks and acts somewhat differently from every other one, so too in the past, every individual was unique. Consideration of this self-evident point and of its implications opens many new possibilities for examination of prehistoric societies (Can and Neitzel, 1995; Cowgill, 1993; Hill and Gunn, 1977; Mithen, 1993). Most traditional approaches to later European prehistory- and indeed to most archaeology in the world- have been strongly normative. The em- phasis in archaeological writing has been on developing typological se- quences and general characterizations of burial practices and settlement forms. Entities that do not fit the standard generalizations tend to be ig- nored or dismissed as exceptions not requiring explanation. The result of this approach has been a deemphasis of individuality of prehistoric persons and of variability in patterns in the archaeological evidence. If instead we address the unusual and exceptional in archaeological patterning, we open possibilities for new understanding of processes of change in the past. In particular, we can ask why some individuals chose to behave in ways that were different from the majority and the role their choices played in proc- esses of change.</page><page sequence="4">242 Wells WHAT IS IDENTITY? Identity is the essence of who the individual is, or who the group is, in relation to larger social contexts. Identity defines what is unique about the individual and about the group. The psychologist Erik Erikson has writ- ten extensively (e.g., Erikson, 1968) about the critical importance of identity for the individual's sense of self. My perspective here, adopted from Cohen (1994), is that identity- whether of the individual or the group- is a dy- namic construction based on personal, or group, history and experience and on relations between individuals and groups. The purpose of identity is to define for the individual, or for the group, a connection with the larger social world, to provide a means by which persons and groups can interact, and to define the parameters of the interactions. Theoretically, an infinite variety of categories of identity could be de- fined for investigation. In the present discussion, I focus on two catego- ries-individual identity and ethnic identity- but mention briefly several others. Identity on the different levels considered here is defined by cultural anthropologists in terms of a wide range of behaviors, including use of lan- guage, ritual and religious practices, kinship systems, and dress and per- sonal ornament. For purposes of archaeological investigation, a special definition of identity is needed that can be recognized from the material evidence that is likely to survive over long periods of time. Many of the aspects of behavior that cultural anthropologists use to recognize identity are not available to the archaeologist, but the archaeological approach to identity has two main advantages. One is time depth. Archaeologists can examine changes in identity expression over long periods of time, particu- larly in places where the database is well developed, as it is in temperate Europe. Another is the ability of archaeology to examine very large samples of information, representing hundreds or thousands of individuals, for ex- ample, those represented in a series of cemeteries in a region. Archaeological Identity Defined For present purposes, I define archaeological identity as information that is communicated by the combination of elements in a manufactured object, or assemblage of objects, about an individual or a group and that individual's or group's relation to the larger social universe. As Thomas (1996) argues (see also Angeli, 1991), eveiy object that a person makes or uses has meaning for that person- it corresponds in some way to the per- son's sense of self-identity. The process of making or using the object im- bues the object with additional meaning concerning the identity of the</page><page sequence="5">Later Prehistory of Central Europe 243 person. Every element of an object can have significance- substance, tech- nique of production, form, size, color, decoration, and so forth. Since hu- mans always have some degree of choice in what they make and use, the objects that we find associated with an individual can be understood to reflect the choices that the individual made. (In the case of burials, the choices may have been made by others after the individual's death, by fam- ily or other community members charged with arranging the burial. But even if the deceased individual did not specify ahead of time how he or she wanted the grave arranged, we can assume that those doing the burying were attentive to the meanings of the objects that they placed with the dead.) By this archaeological definition, identity is the material outcome of a series of choices made by individuals regarding the character of the material culture they make and employ in their lives and- depending upon current burial practice- frequently use as signs of their identity after their deaths. Recognizing Signs of Identity Archaeologically Information about identity in archaeological contexts should be avail- able through examination of the intentional production and use of elements of material culture that are not directly part of the economic purpose of an object. Such elements are often referred to as "style" or "decoration" (Carr and Neitzel, 1995; Hegmon, 1992). For example, while a ceramic ves- sel has a practical purpose in holding liquids, incised linear decoration ap- plied to the surface in most cases is not directly related to that purpose, but instead communicates information about the maker and/or the user (Dietler and Herbich, 1994). Thomas (1996, p. 159) suggests that such decorated objects represent "networks of significance" for the people who make and use them. The interrelationship between such significant objects and the people among whom they are created and employed is important, as Thomas argues. On the one hand, people create and decorate objects in specific, significant ways in order to communicate meanings about their identity and other information. On the other hand, the very process of mak- ing such objects, and of using them, in turn constructs meanings for the people doing the manufacturing or using. The process of interaction be- tween people and objects thus creates complex and dynamic interrelation- ships between them. Key in the study of identity in archaeology is the dialectical relation- ship between the sameness of elements of style and decoration and the differences in the ways those elements are combined. All systems of ex- pressing identity depend upon difference- differences between the entities</page><page sequence="6">244 Wells identified. But all parties involved in the communication system must be participants in the same system of signification- everyone must understand the signs and symbols used in order for communication to work. It is the differences between the specific expressions constructed from the univer- sally understood elements that allow for identity to be communicated. Analysis of objects created and used by members of specific commu- nities and shared by peoples in contact with them enables the archaeologist to recognize the elements of style and decoration that people employed to communicate significant information about patterns of sameness and dif- ference within and between groups. These principles apply to analysis of identity on all levels. In the case of individual identity, for example, in which the individual distinguishes himself or herself from other persons in the community, the same elements need to be employed by all participating individuals for the system of signification to be intelligible to all members of the community. But to construct individual identity, participants must create their own unique combinations of those elements, different from the combinations of others. The same principles apply on the level of family identity, com- munity identity, and cultural or ethnic identity. The specific elements that are used to structure identity on each of these levels are different. At the level of ethnic identity, a highly visible kind of difference might be em- ployed, such as the shape or color of an outer garment (Eicher, 1995) or the form of a piece of jewelry worn in such a way as to be seen readily. At the individual level, details in the ornamentation of a garment or on a piece of jewelry might identify the specific person. Producing the Signs of Identity Since our archaeological definition of identity depends upon objects that people make and use, including- in the context discussed below- per- sonal ornaments, weapons, pottery, and metal vessels, questions surround- ing the manufacture of those objects are of critical importance. People select particular objects, or choose particular kinds of decoration, because they communicate something about their identity. At the same time, the process of constructing and using an object plays an active role in creating the user's identity. The two aspects of this interrelationship are not easy to separate. In the present state of research, we do not know much about how individuals in late prehistoric Europe acquired the objects that they used as signs of identity, but ongoing research is generating important in- formation about this subject. During the Late Bronze and Iron Ages of Europe, much of the pottery and most of the metalwork was produced by</page><page sequence="7">Later Prehistory of Central Europe 245 specialist craftworkers (Wells, 1996), not by every individual or family. For us to judge the range of choices that individuals had in selecting the objects and their decoration for expression, we need to know more about where the objects were made and how the process of manufacture was organized. IDENTITY EXPRESSION IN LATER PREHISTORY In different contexts in later European prehistory, different categories of identity have been the foci of research attention. For example, status identity has been an issue of considerable research in the context of the gold-rich "princely" burials of the latter part of the Early Iron Age. Re- gional or "ethnic" identity has been the focus of much attention devoted to the archaeology of the final century before Christ, when Greek and Ro- man texts refer to "Celts" (also known as "Gauls") and "Germans." In the following discussion, I use the standard periodization of later prehistory in central Europe as follows: Late Bronze Age (roughly 1200-800 B.C.), Early Iron Age (800-475 B.C.), La TSne A (475-400 B.C.), La Tene B-C (400- 150 B.C.), and La Tene D (150 B.C.-Roman conquest). The map in Fig. 1 shows locations of sites mentioned in the text. INDIVIDUAL IDENTITY Later European prehistory offers a good context in which to approach the problem of the individual in prehistory, because of the strong emphasis on cemetery archaeology. For all periods except the very end of the Iron Age, large numbers of well-excavated and published cemeteries are avail- able for examination. Since the vast majority of burials in Late Bronze Age and Iron Age Europe were individual, we have at our disposal large num- bers of coherent units of material culture associated with individuals, in- cluding data concerning such variables as grave location, grave structure, arrangement of the body, and grave goods. For the most part, graves were well outfitted with goods. Hence we have large numbers of good associa- tions between individual persons and assemblages of material culture that were arranged with them in their graves. The situation with settlements, and particularly with individual houses, is much less satisfactory. Compared to cemetery excavation, little attention has been paid to settlement research until very recently, and very little work has been devoted to study of the character of individual households.</page><page sequence="8">246 Wells e X C iS 8 ‚ñ†¬´¬ß g 2 JtS ¬°I ti S 'S I -s CX M i! _2 O- ^H RJ</page><page sequence="9">Later Prehistory of Central Europe 247 Late Bronze Age Central Europe and the surrounding lands were dominated by the Urnfield groups during the Late Bronze Age, so called because the char- acteristic cremation burials, in ceramic urns, often are found in great "fields" of graves. During this period the patterning of the material evi- dence does not indicate special efforts to create distinctive regional iden- tities. As M√ºller-Karpe (1959) demonstrated, the material culture of the groups of this time was remarkably homogeneous over wide areas of the continent. The broad similarities in burials, settlements, and ritual deposits throughout central regions of Europe suggest that sharp distinctions in identity had not yet developed between communities or between peoples inhabiting different regions. Important signs of individual identity are common, however. Even be- fore the Late Bronze Age, we can recognize the representation of differ- ences between individuals, expressed most clearly in the burial evidence</page><page sequence="10">248 Wells (e.g., Lauermann, 1992; Mithen, 1993). During the Late Bronze Age, sys- tems were developed for representing the individuality of specific persons through the creation of unique patterns of decoration on personal objects. Among the kinds of objects on which these expressions are particularly evident are bronze bracelets (P√°szthory, 1985), swords (Kramer, 1985; von Quillfeldt, 1995), and ceramic cups (Wells, 1985). In all of these cases, the decoration consists of patterns of incised lines, including different combi- nations of horizontal, vertical, oblique, and wavy lines, together with trian- gles and circles. The elements from which the decoration on each object was created are limited, but they are combined in an infinite variety of different configurations. No two of the decorations are exactly alike, mak- ing clear that the craftworkers who produced them were intentionally mak- ing each one distinctive. All of the objects that bear such ornament were intended for display- for others to see and to comprehend the meanings of the patterns (see below). These decorated objects frequently are recov- ered in burials, and thus they can be associated with specific individuals. Many types of bronze bracelets studied by P√°szthory (1985) bear such individualized ornament in the form of patterns of fine incised lines. The decoration generally occurs along the central portions and the sides of the bracelets- all parts that would have been visible to others-but not on the inner surface that touched the wearer's arm. Most common among the in- dividualized decorations are patterns of parallel lines, zigzag lines, triangles, and circles. Many of the swords with cast handles (known by their German term Vollgriffschwerter) bear similar kinds of finely incised ornament on the grip and on the pommel (von Quillfeldt, 1995). The decoration consists most often of patterns of concentric circles, frequently combined with sets of parallel lines, and sometimes spirals, zizgag lines, and triangles. On the small, thin-walled ceramic cups- the only category of pottery during this period that regularly bears decorative elaboration- the elements incised into the surface of the vessels before firing are somewhat different from those on the bronze objects; they were adapted to the ceramic me- dium, but the ways in which elements were combined to construct unique compositions are similar (Wells, 1985). The most common elements are incised parallel lines and lines made up of incised strokes (Fig. 2). These are frequently arranged in horizontal bands around the vessels, sometimes in zigzag lines, and sometimes as garlands. In the case of all of these categories of objects, it would presumably have been easier for the craftworkers to reproduce similar designs on mul- tiple objects, if the intention was simply to fill open surfaces with decora- tion. The uniqueness of each individual object argues for an intention on</page><page sequence="11">Later Prehistory of Central Europe 249 Fig. 2.

Each of these kinds of objects- bracelets, swords, and cups- played an important role in social interaction in Late Bronze Age society. Cast bronze bracelets were objects worn by women, according to the evidence from burials. Only a small proportion of women was outfitted with the bracelets in their graves, hence it is likely that in life too these objects were used by a minority of all women. Worn in locations where they were readily visible to other people, the ornament on these objects would have been readily apparent to persons meeting or interacting with the wearer. Swords were not only weapons, but also signs of elite male identity. From the Late Bronze Age on in central Europe, swords were a charac- teristic accoutrement of wealthy men's burials. The implication of the burial evidence is that they also were displayed during the lifetime of the individual, perhaps worn regularly on the person, perhaps used in community rituals. Certainly in the burial ceremony, and probably in social interaction during the life of the man, the incised decoratioo on the hilt of the sword was seen by other members of the community who participated in the rituals. Decorated ceramic cups also played important roles in social interac- tion. They are well represented in burials (e.g., Winghart, 1992), on settle- ments (e.g., Wells, 1985), and in ritual deposits; when they occur in burials, they are associated with adult males. The set of vessels used in feasting ceremonies, which became important socially and politically during the Iron Age (Dietler, 1990), developed during the Late Bronze Age. In this set, the ceramic cup served as the vessel for consumption of a beverage by a participating individual. These decorated cups were the final links in the manipulation of objects in the course of the feasting ritual. Special bever- ages were stored or mixed in large, wide-mouthed metal or ceramic vessels; strainers were employed to remove spices or other additives; and the cups were the vehicle for the transmission of the beverage to the individual con- sumer in this social ritual that played an important role in the creation and expression of elite status during the Late Bronze and Iron Ages. Early Iron Age In the Early Iron Age there are numerous indications that differen- tiation between individuals was more extensive than it had been in the Late Bronze Age. Different kinds of evidence show that society became more complex during the Early Iron Age and that it required more levels of differentiation to regulate the increasingly complex interactions between individuals and between groups. An example of the changes is in the sheet</page><page sequence="13">Later Prehistory of Central Europe 251 bronze beltplates that occur in burials of men and women during both the Late Bronze Age and the Early Iron Age. Late Bronze Age specimens tend to bear relatively simple ornamentation, frequently in the form of sin- gle, repeating patterns (Kilian-Dirlmeier, 1975). In the Early Iron Age, the patterns of ornament on the belt plates became much more complex, with a wider repertoire of design elements and an emphasis on division of deco- rative fields into zones filled with alternating patterns of elements (Kilian- Dirlmeier, 1972; Wells, 1989). The same kind of change from nonzonal decoration of Late Bronze Age pottery to patterns involving differentiated zonal decoration is apparent in much of the pottery of the Early Iron Age. If design elements on objects that are readily visible and play roles in social interaction communicate information about the users of the objects, then we can say that in the Early Iron Age the information transmitted by the decorative patterns was considerably more differentiated and complex. Two recent cemetery studies contribute important information con- cerning this point. In his analysis of the 128 secondary burials in the large tumulus at the Magdalenenberg near Villingen at the eastern edge of the Black Forest, J. M√ºller (1994) found a wide range of variation in specific burial practices represented. Similarly, in his investigation of the cemetery of Lindele in Rottenburg in W√ºrttemberg, Reim (1995) showed that each grave was distinguished from all others with respect to such criteria as grave structure, treatment of the body, size of the burial space, and kinds, quan- tities, and arrangement of goods. Reim's (1995, p. 91, Fig. 47) plan of the cemetery provides a vivid illustration of the individual character of each burial. Late Iron Age During the Early and Middle La TBne phases of the Late Iron Age, patterns of stylistic variability and decorative distinctiveness are similar to those in the latter part of the Early Iron Age. But in the Early La Tene phase especially, there is a greater emphasis on the unique character of some individuals. Among the richest burials, no two graves have gold or- naments that are closely similar, unlike the situation in the Early Iron Age, when the gold neckrings were very similar in all of the wealthiest burials. (I say more about those rich graves below in the discussion of status iden- tity.) In the Early La Tene period, even some burials that are not among the richest by virtue of gold rings or imported bronze vessels express special roles played by individuals in society. An example is the grave of a woman discovered recently at G√ºndlingen in the Upper Rhine Valley (Dehn, 1994). It contained an unusual assem-</page><page sequence="14">252 Wells blage of objects and thus does not conform to the standard burial pattern for women during this period. The grave was in a tumulus, and it contained the remains of an adult woman placed on her back in extended position. She was buried with a substantial set of personal ornaments, including four bronze fibulae, two bracelets, and two legrings. The bronze bracelet on her left arm was ornamented with representations of four men's heads with beards, in characteristic Early La Tene style. Next to her left leg was a series of objects that have been interpreted as amulets or charms, perhaps used by the woman in healing or magical ceremonies. They included small bronze rings worn as pendants, two amber beads, a miniature bronze knife, a pendant bovine animal, an agate, a polished stone the shape and size of a hen's egg, a naturally perforated flat piece of limestone that had been repaired by means of a bronze patch, and two dog mandibles. This unusual series of objects distinguishes the woman as a special individual in her com- munity; the character of the objects suggests that she may have been a healer or a magician (Pauli, 1975). In the Middle La Tene phase, signs of individual identity occur in a limited number of contexts. In the case of women's graves, these signs are in the form of uniquely decorated objects of personal ornament, particu- larly neckrings but also bracelets and fibulae. As in the cases of the Late Bronze Age bracelets and Early Iron Age beltplates, the distinctive indi- vidualizing features include details of ornament that are not significant structurally but that would have been immediately apparent to persons meeting the wearer. Comparable signs of individuality in men's graves are decorations on bronze and iron sword scabbards. The decorations on each object are unique and presumably served to mark each sword and scabbard as the property of the specific individual who owned and used them. Late La Tene In the final phase of the Late Iron Age, at the time that the large settlements known as oppida (Maier, 1991) were established throughout central Europe, signs of individual identity are significantly rarer than in the periods discussed above. Burial practice changed in most parts of tem- perate Europe, from the laying-out of well-equipped inhumation graves to the burial of modest cremations and, for the most part, no documented burial activity at all. Only in the lands north of the Main and Nahe Rivers was the practice maintained of outfitting graves with the same kinds of goods that had been used during the preceding period. For most of the central regions of Europe, it is not clear how corpses were disposed of or</page><page sequence="15">Later Prehistory of Central Europe 253 what funerary rituals accompanied those procedures. At some sites, such as Ribemont in northern France and Manching in southern Germany, there is evidence that suggests ritual activity involving exhumed human bones, but the evidence is as yet poorly understood (recent discussion by Hahn, 1992). If indeed the bones on these sites represent some kind of group funerary rituals, then we would have evidence for a fundamental shift from the construction and outfitting of individual graves, to communal ritual ac- tivity that emphasized collective identity. At the same time that people ceased to place such metal objects as swords and personal ornaments in graves, we observe a great increase in the deposition of such objects at sites associated with water and in pits on land (Collis, 1995a; Kurz, 1995). These deposits consisted frequently of weapons, particularly swords (M√ºller, 1990), iron tools of different kinds, gold coins, and combinations of gold ring jewelry and coins. The site of La Tene in Switzerland is the most striking example, where large quantities of metalwork, particularly swords and other weapons, were deposited in shallow water (Dunning, 1991). Over 200 swords and scabbards have been recovered there, representing over 200 individual sword bearers. The scab- bards at La Tene are among the best examples of this individualizing or- nament. But the effect of depositing all of these objects massed together at La Tene was to emphasize the sword bearers as members of a group, not as individuals. Other sites of this period show similar behavior, with the deposition of swords, in particular, but other metal objects as well, as at Gournay-sur-Aronde in northern France (Brunaux, 1991), Nuits-Saint- Georges in eastern France (Faudet and Pommeret, 1985), and Port Nidau (F. M√ºller, 1991a) and Tiefenau in Switzerland (F. M√ºller, 1991b). The same phenomenon of depositing quantities of objects that had previously been placed with individuals in graves is apparent also at sites not directly associated with water, as, for example, at Empel in the Netherlands (Roy- mans and Derks, 1994). The many gold hoards of this period that contain neckrings, armrings, and gold coins, such as those recently found at Nied- erzier in the Rhineland (Gobi et ai, 1991), similarly represent objects that would have been placed in graves in an earlier period. In the manufacture of tools, ornaments, and pottery, there is increasing evidence for specialized production (Wells, 1996). The fast-turning potter's wheel came into general use, and blacksmiths manufactured iron imple- ments in series. Personal ornaments of bronze also tended to be mass-pro- duced to a greater extent than before. The effect of this change in the organization of craft production was to decrease the amount of choice that individuals could exercise in selecting or commissioning manufactured ob- jects. Once manufacture passed from mainly individually handcrafted ob- jects to mass-produced generic goods, the relationship between complex</page><page sequence="16">254 Wells objects, such as fibulae and decorated pottery, and individual persons changed significantly. The change in the character of fibulae illustrates this point particularly well (Gebhard, 1991; Maute, 1994; R. M√ºller, 1994). Fibulae of the Early and Middle La Tene phases tended to be complex and differentiated by their structure and their ornamentation. The most common form at the end of the second and beginning of the final century B.C. was the Nauheim fibula. It differed from the most common varieties of preceding times in that it could be mass-produced and was largely standardized in both form and ornament (Drescher, 1955; Werner, 1955); variation between individual pieces was minimal. During the preceding periods, many fibulae were unique and required considerable craftworkers' time and effort to manu- facture. Thus we see a shift from personal identifying objects that express the uniqueness of the wearer to functional pins that make all wearers look the same. The implication of these changes- from domestic to specialized production and from signs of individual identity to standardized jewelry- is that a profound change was taking place in central European society that meant that the identity of the individual was becoming less significant in social interaction, and that of the community more important. This change toward higher levels of social integration also has been identified in the linguistic evidence from this time (Markey, 1986, pp. 263-264). Period of the Roman Conquests Relationships between individuals and their material culture changed again at the end of the Iron Age, at the time of the Roman conquests of much of temperate Europe. New indications of individuality characterize this phase, most apparent in highly differentiated burial assemblages, fol- lowing the phase during which burials were rare in most regions. A group of about 20 graves in southern Bavaria has been the focus of much debate about the identity of the indigenous peoples in this period. Treatment of the body varied between inhumation and cremation, and the character of metal and ceramic grave goods also varied considerably (Rieckhoff, 1993, 1995). Contributing to the highly individualized character of burial assem- blages was the adoption of forms and styles from surrounding regions, to the north in the Saale-middle Elbe area, to the east in the middle Danube lands of Austria and Hungary, to the south in the Alpine valleys, and to the west in Gaul. The objects of apparently foreign character have given rise to considerable discussion about migration, but in most cases the graves in question are not just like those in any of the supposed lands of origin of the migrants. A more productive perspective, and one more in line with</page><page sequence="17">Later Prehistory of Central Europe 255 ethnographic understanding of similar contexts, is to view these materials in terms of the increasing interactions- of all kinds- that were taking place during the final century B.C. and the beginning of the first century A.D. that resulted in wider choices for individuals in adopting particular styles of personal ornaments and pottery (Wells, 1995b). These graves are dis- cussed further below. Summary: Individual Identity The common use of patterns of elements to construct decorative elabo- ration on objects- what Thomas (1996) calls networks of significance- throughout most of later European prehistory suggests that, from the Late Bronze Age on, a concept of individual identity was growing in importance, at least among a portion of society in temperate Europe. The restriction of such features to objects that occur in association with well-outfitted buri- als suggests that it was limited largely to particular categories of persons, but not to just a small elite group. Such objects occur in many cemeteries, on settlement sites, and in hoard deposits. In the Early Iron Age, individual identity is constructed and repre- sented largely through burial monuments, with the creation of a system of highly heterogeneous burial practices and associated structures (Murray, 1995, p. 279). But some categories of objects, such as beltplates and ornate types of pottery, continue to display individualizing patterns of decoration similar in character to those of the Late Bronze Age. At the beginning of the Late Iron Age, in the Early La l√®ne period, the expression of indi- viduality is restricted largely to the richest burials, but a number of highly unusual burials have been identified as well, such as the woman's grave at G√ºndlingen, reflecting what must have been special roles in society. In the succeeding phase, known as the Middle La Tene period, both women's bronze jewelry and the bronze and iron scabbards in men's graves bear individually distinctive ornament. As in the case of the Late Bronze Age, here, too, the objects bearing such ornament occur in a substantial number of graves- not restricted to a small elite- but in fewer than half of all buri- als. Substantial change is apparent in the Late La Tene period, beginning around the middle of the second centuiy B.C. The traditional burial prac- tice of interring individuals in separate graves was abandoned in most of central Europe, in favor of group rituals involving the bones of multiple deceased. Many of the kinds of objects that had previously been placed in individual graves, such as swords, spears, metal vessels, fibulae, ring jewelry, and coins, were placed in mass deposits, representing not single individuals</page><page sequence="18">256 Wells but whole communities. Personal material culture, such as pins and rings, was no longer usually decorated in ways that made each object a unique individual, but rather manufactured in series. With the abandonment of the large settlements at the oppida, and of the complex, economically and politically integrated systems based at them, people moved into small communities and again relied on individually crafted goods, not mass-produced ones. In this new situation, we see a re- turn to the practice of individual expression, evident both in burial practices and in the character of personal ornaments that were placed with the dead. GENDER AND STATUS IDENTITY TWo aspects of individual identity - gender and status - need to be mentioned here. Because they have not yet become foci of special research attention in late prehistoric central Europe, I cite only a few important studies. Both of these categories of identity relate principally to the indi- vidual. An important characteristic of the identity of every person is gender (Gero and Conkey, 1991; Wright, 1996). In European prehistory there has long been concern with the representation of gender differences in burial practices and assemblages of grave goods. In some cases, both physical an- thropological and archaeological analyses have been carried out on ceme- teries (e.g., Kr√§mer, 1964; Waldhauser, 1987), producing valuable information about gender-specific patterning. But recently some investiga- tors have devoted more systematic attention to questions of gender identity and expression in later prehistory (Reichert, 1994). With the shift from cremation as the predominant burial practice in the Late Bronze Age and the beginning of the Early Iron Age to inhuma- tion in the latter part of the Early Iron Age (Hallstatt D in Reinecke's chronology), comprehensive studies of patterns of gender identity become more feasible. Several recent studies have focused upon issues of gender identity in the latter part of the Early Iron Age. An analysis by Alt et al (1995) of the cemetery at Dattingen in southern Baden, dated in the rela- tive sequence to Hallstatt Dl (sixth century B.C. in absolute years), pro- vides useful information because both skeletal remains and grave goods were analyzed. The cemetery comprised 32 identifiable graves. TWenty-eight contained remains of skeletons buried in the extended position. They were arranged in five circles, apparently originally in the outer parts of tumuli. Of 20 adults identified, 11 were women and 9 men. The others were ado- lescents and children. Women's graves typically contained more personal ornaments than men's, and only women were outfitted with head or neck jewelry, including</page><page sequence="19">Later Prehistory of Central Europe 257 bronze spiral rings, earrings, and amber, coral, glass, and bronze beads. Bracelets made of sapropelite were found on most of the women's skele- tons, and sheet bronze bracelets also occurred. Bronze or iron belthooks and other belt ornaments also appeared in women's burials. Men's graves at Dattingen did not contain any weapons, nor did they have beltplates or fibulae, in contrast to the nearby contemporaneous cemetery at the Magdalenenberg tumulus near Villingen. This difference points up the marked degree of variability in ritual practice among com- munities within a single region (see below) and warns against the normative approach to ritual analysis. In grave 20, containing a double burial, a man was outfitted with a bronze earring and a pair of sapropelite bracelets. Sapropelite bracelets at Dattingen typically characterize women, and pairs of bracelets are generally accepted as signs of women's identity. Yet in this case, the physical anthro- pological analysis of the skeleton concluded that it was clearly male. This instance is important because it means that graves elsewhere that have been sexed as female on the basis of pairs of bracelets need to be reassessed. The pattern of generally sharp gender distinctions marked by burial objects that is evident at Dattingen also was noted in J. Miiller's (1994) recent analysis of the secondary burials at the Magdalenenberg and by Lorentzen (1993) in her essay on women in Iron Age Europe. Significantly, analyses of both typical burials at the Magdalenenberg by M√ºller and of exceptionally richly outfitted graves by Lorentzen concluded that no status differences between the genders were reflected in the burial practices. Al- though the characteristic objects placed in men's and women's graves were distinctive, the wealth represented by them- in terms of quantity and qual- ity of material and investment of labor in workmanship- was similar. In the wealthiest graves, many of the same kinds of special status objects occur in both men's and women's burials, such as wagons, gold neckrings, ornate pottery imported from the Greek world, and bronze feasting equipment. The patterns of gender differentiation by grave goods continued through the early and middle phases of the Late Iron Age. In the final phase, La Iene D, most of the evidence for such differentiation disappears with the end of the practice of inhumation and of inclusion of substantial grave goods. In those regions where the practice of including grave goods continued, the patterns described above were characteristic. In addition to gender, a second important characteristic of every in- dividual's identity is status in the social system of which the individual is a part. In later European prehistory, research attention has focused par- ticularly on issues regarding elite status as it is represented in burial prac- tices, and not much on other status categories in society. By the Late Bronze Age, particular objects had come to communicate elite status in</page><page sequence="20">258 Wells funerary ritual, for both men and women. These included large sets of fine ceramic vessels, probably associated with feasting rituals, and gold orna- ments (Sperber, 1992; Wirth, 1995). In the case of elite men's graves, they also included wheeled vehicles, weapons, and bronze vessels. In the latter half of the Early Iron Age, Hallstatt D of the central European scheme, about 600-475 B.C. in absolute chronology, status iden- tity was expressed more intensively than at any other time in prehistoric Europe. As Biel (1993) argues, during the sixth and fifth centuries B.C. we see for the first time in central Europe a society with a highly developed social hierarchy. The material representation of this hierarchy varied con- siderably in the different regions. For example, in Hungary, elites were bur- ied with weapons and horseback-riding equipment (Patek, 1995). In Bavaria, they are represented by enclosed rectangular farmsteads, referred to in the literature as Herrenh√∂fe (Zeeb, 1992). In west-central Europe, the top of the social hierarchy is represented by graves richly outfitted with luxury goods and covered by large tumuli. The essential structure of the display was similar to that established in the Late Bronze Age, consisting of four-wheeled vehicles, bronze vessels, gold ornaments, and, in the case of men, iron weapons. But there are a number of significant differences between the rich burials of the Early Iron Age and those of the Late Bronze Age. The Early Iron Age graves were much more lavishly outfitted than their earlier counterparts, with much larger numbers of objects and the expenditure of much greater amounts of effort in the manufacture of goods placed in the graves. The topographical arrangement of the richest graves, at the center of tumuli, with poorer graves arranged concentrically around them, served to reinforce the social difference between the elite individual buried in the center and the rest of his or her community. Some interpret the distinctions drawn by the material patterns- the quantity and quality of grave goods and the arrangement of burials- to indicate that two distinct classes had developed during the latter part of the Early Iron Age, at least in the west-central European region (Olivier and Reinhart, 1993). In west-central Europe, the symbols of elite status that characterized the special burials were highly standardized (Arnold, 1995, p. 49; Biel, 1993; Dietler, 1995, p. 70), indicating a shared system of meanings over a sizable landscape. The objects that commonly occur in the approximately 40 known graves of this category include gold neckrings, daggers (in the men's graves), and bronze and ceramic vessels associated with feasting. The grave at Hochdorf near Stuttgart in Germany is a good example of the group, since it is the only such grave found in modern times that had not been looted in antiquity (Biel, 1985). That burial contained, in addition to the standard gold neckring and a variety of other gold ornaments, a bronze caldron made in a Greek workshop and capable of holding some 400 liters,</page><page sequence="21">Later Prehistory of Central Europe 259 a gold bowl, nine iron drinking horns, nine bronze plates, and three bronze serving basins. The identity of the elite individuals as social leaders and providers in their communities was emphasized by the outfitting of such graves with equipment used in feasting rituals (Pauli, 1989). Interactions with peoples of the Mediterranean world played an im- portant role in creating the special identities of the elites of the Early Iron Age (Brun, 1993; Dietler, 1995, p. 68). Among the objects in the rich graves are lavish goods from Greek workshops. Such foreign imports formed an essential aspect of the identity of these individuals, because it linked them with the larger, cosmopolitan outside world. Greek, and to a lesser extent Etruscan, imports in these contexts are most often bronze or ceramic ves- sels that formed parts of the feasting ritual. In some of the rich graves, whole sets of vessels imported from the Mediterranean world could have formed the complete assemblage needed for celebratory banquets as they were practiced in Greece and Etruria. The Vix tomb in eastern France contained a Greek bronze krater, used in the Mediterranean societies to mix wine and water, an Etruscan bronze jug, two Greek ceramic wine cups, and a Greek silver drinking bowl. Some investigators suggest that the Greek wine-drinking ritual, or a version of it, was adopted by the elites of central Europe along with their importation of the vessels and the wine (Dietler, 1990; Krausse, 1993). The practice of the ritual, in the context of commu- nity ceremonies, would have contributed to the construction of the identity of the elite individuals. FAMILY AND COMMUNITY IDENTITY Little attention has been paid to identification of family units or of communities in later prehistory, but some recent studies indicate the quality of the available evidence for future research. Analysis of relationships be- tween individuals in each of the five groupings at Dattingen (Alt et al., 1995) provides information about family identity. If each tumulus repre- sents the burial place of a family of related individuals [a pattern that has been recognized elsewhere in Early Iron Age contexts (Piningre, 1993)], together with a limited number of marriage partners who came into the community from outside (a pattern well represented ethnographically and in written sources during the Roman period), then biological analysis should show strong genetic connections between individuals (Harke, 1995). If tumuli instead represent some kind of associations other than biological families, then genetic analysis should show unrelated individuals. The re- sults of the analyses at Dattingen indicate that indeed the individuals are related in patterns than confirm the presence of close genetic relationships,</page><page sequence="22">260 Wells consistent with family groupings. The arrangement of burial monuments in the Early Iron Age thus served to emphasize the identity of individual fami- lies, indicating that family units played important roles as identified group- ings in the society of the period (Harke, 1995). For the Late Iron Age, when burial was in large flat-grave cemeteries rather than in discrete tu- muli, the identification of family units has been considerably more difficult. The lack of emphasis on settlement research in later prehistory means that little attention has been paid to the identity of families based on house- hold archaeology. But some investigations are beginning to address this question (e.g., Sievers, 1992, p. 330). In a recent study, I (Wells, 1997) ex- amine the contents of a rich pit on the Late Iron Age settlement of Kel- heim in Bavaria for the information it can convey about the family that inhabited the house with which the pit was associated. The abundant and unusually high-quality remains, including exceptionally fine pottery, metal vessels, and glass ornaments, suggest that the family identified itself as one of especially high status and used a variety of visually meaningful objects to communicate its special character to other members of the community. Despite broad general similarities in burial practice, pottery forms, metal jewelry, and other categories of material culture among the different residential communities of Late Bronze and Iron Age temperate Europe, close examination reveals that every community expressed its individuality through its use of material culture. In their study of the Dattingen ceme- tery, Alt et al. (1995) call attention to the striking differences in burial prac- tice between that community and the one represented nearby at the Magdalenenberg. In the Magdalenenberg cemetery, men were charac- teristically outfitted with weapons, beltplates, and fibulae, while the men's graves at Dattingen contained none of these objects. The normative ap- proach to the Early Iron Age would classify these cemeteries together and present a generalized picture of burial practice. But the identification of significant differences in practice points to the marked distinctions made by members of different neighboring communities in order to distinguish themselves from their fellows. Numerous indicators show that each of the large, townlike communi- ties that appeared in the latter half of the Early Iron Age developed its own distinctive identity (Biel, 1993, p. 46), though they are frequently grouped together and treated in the literature as if they were very similar. For example, Heuneburg, the most extensively investigated of these Early Iron Age centers, was unique in central Europe for its clay-brick wall and bastions projecting out from its exterior. These architectural features cre- ated a unique appearance for Heuneburg in its west-central European landscape. Recent analyses of the finer classes of potteiy at some of the centers provide additional evidence for the development of distinctive com-</page><page sequence="23">Later Prehistory of Central Europe 261 munity identities. Chemical analyses carried out on potteiy from sites in Switzerland indicate that the wares in use at different centers were distinc- tive, not from common production places. This evidence suggests that spe- cialized workshops at each center produced the fine wares for consumption by that community (B√©arat and Bauer, 1994). In the Late Iron Age, similarly distinctive features have been the focus of attention in study of the material culture of the different centers. Until recently, the large, walled, arguably urban oppidum settlements of the final two centuries B.C. were most often considered as a homogeneous group that shared important features of topographical situation, defensive archi- tecture, and internal organization (Maier, 1991). But a number of recent studies have focused instead on the variability between the sites, arguing that similar outward forms often mask considerable individual variation (Collis, 1995a,b; Haselgrove, 1995; Woolf, 1993). Closer examination of this variation is likely to identify significant elements of material culture through which each community constructed and expressed its identity. Gebhard (1993) argues that the wall enclosing the oppidum of Manching served as a sign of the community's status, power, and distinctiveness. The same could be said for any of the wails around oppidum settlements, since all are unique in detail, though they share broad features of similarity. With pottery, too, we can identify evidence for the construction and expression of community identity on the part of the potters and their customers in the final phase of the prehistoric Iron Age. Chossenot (1991) shows that within the broadly similar fine painted wares of the Late La Tene period, the potters of each community produced locally characteristic wares. Simi- larly, with Late La Tene coinage, each major community minted its own distinctive types of coins (Ziegaus, 1993). The development of the rectangular enclosures {Viereckschanzen) in this period shows the same pattern. They are similar in size and basic struc- ture across the whole of central Europe, from central France to Moravia. There is currently debate as to whether they were all ritual places or whether some had more secular functions (Krause, 1995; Reichenberger, 1995). It is apparent from the available evidence that they served as gath- ering places of some kind. There is no need for there to have been a single purpose for each of the many hundreds of enclosures known; more likely their use varied regionally and locally. They can be understood as signs of group solidarity among the myriad small and large communities throughout central Europe- common places for people to come together, whether for expressly religious purposes or for more social ones. As Murray's (1995) recent discussion of the evidence indicates, a large proportion of the en- closures yields evidence for feasting activity, perhaps in ceremonies linked to social and political processes. Whatever the specific use to which one</page><page sequence="24">262 Wells or more was put, as a class of sites, they, like the oppida, indicate a common expression of identity across this specific landscape. As the foregoing discussion indicates, researchers are beginning to ex- amine assemblages of objects from different communities and to think about how these relate to the issue of community identity. There is still a reluctance apparent in the field, however, to view prehistoric peoples as actors making decisions about how to make or acquire objects that they can use to communicate information. A more conscious approach to this issue has the potential to yield rich information about intercommunity in- teractions. ETHNIC OR CULTURAL IDENTITY The aspect of identity that has received the most attention in research in later European prehistory- both traditionally and recently- is what we may broadly call ethnic identity- identity that large groupings of peoples, comprising multiple communities, recognize. Most often this kind of iden- tity has been examined in relation to the first historical sources that pertain to central Europe- the Greek and Roman commentaries that began in the fifth century B.C. and become more frequent throughout the Late Iron Age. As I explain below, attempts to link the archaeological evidence with the written sources with regard to ethnic or cultural identity is highly prob- lematical, because the two kinds of information derive from different types of sources that are not necessarily comparable. Early Iron Age From the beginning of the Early Iron Age, investigators recognize the existence of a relatively coherent group of material cultures across all of the southern portions of central Europe, known as the Hallstatt culture, with some significant distinctions between the western and the eastern ex- pressions. The commonality of the thousands of different communities at- tributed to this broad grouping is discerned in similar kinds of pottery, bronze ornaments, iron weapons and tools, and burial practices. In north- ern parts of central Europe, a variety of different material cultural group- ings are recognized, on the basis of local variations in object morphologies and burial practice (Horst, 1989, p. 125). During the second half of the Early Iron Age, from about 600 B.C., the evidence in the northern regions indicates increasing similarity between groups, expressed in common ma- terial culture and burial practices. The name given to this newly shared</page><page sequence="25">Later Prehistory of Central Europe 263 material culture is Jastorf, after a cemetery in northern Germany (Heynowski, 1996; Keiling, 1989). The recognition of the Hallstatt groups in the south and the Jastorf groups in the north as two broad interregional patterns does not obscure the fact that many regional variants are still rec- ognized in both parts of Europe. These regional variants are defined by locally distinctive pottery forms, fibula types, burial practices, and other such attributes (e.g., Ettel, 1993; M√ºller, 1993; Olivier and Reinhard, 1993). The main determining factor in recognizing the distinction between the Hallstatt and the Jastorf groups is in the style of metal objects and pottery. Recent investigations of style in archaeology have shown that it is closely related to expressions of group identity (Fisher, 1995; Megaw and Megaw, 1995). The important question to ask in this context is, Why did the two broad style regions develop during the Early Iron Age? In ethno- graphic contexts, group identities often form in situations of intensifying interaction between different peoples. Groups that see themselves as more alike than they are like other groups in another region frequently develop increasing signs of shared identity. During the period in which these indi- cators of increasing homogeneity appeared, we also see evidence for in- creasing interaction, shown through circulation of goods and borrowing of styles and motifs, between peoples in the central and northern regions of the continent (Seyer, 1993; Stary, 1993). This major distinction in the patterning of material culture that devel- oped in the course of the Early Iron Age defined a pattern for we-they interaction throughout the rest of the prehistoric Iron Age. Early La Tene Style and the Celts A new style of decoration developed in the northwestern region of the Late Hallstatt area, probably in the Hunsr√ºck-Eifel region of the Middle Rhineland, early in the fifth century B.C. (Frey, 1991). This new style, known as La Tene (and popularly referred to as Celtic art), is charac- terized by ornamental motifs based on floral patterns such as leaves, blos- soms, and tendrils and by extensive use of stylized human faces and animals (Fig. 3). Its curvilinear and asymmetrical forms contrast sharply with the strictly geometric ornament of the Early Iron Age Hallstatt style. In its early expressions, the new style is represented mostly on elaborate gold and bronze ornaments found in exceptionally rich graves in the Middle Rhineland and in the Marne region of France. In their discussion of this style, Megaw and Megaw (1995, p. 346) ar- gue that art styles indicate identity. Many investigators have argued that the appearance of the La Tene style can be directly associated with the</page><page sequence="26">Fig. 3. Two designs characteristic of Early La Tene art. Top: From the gold ornament on an iron belthook from the rich grave at Weiskirchen. Bottom: Gold ornament on a bowl from the rich grave at Schwarzenbach. Both examples show the use of motifs derived from floral elements-leaves and flowers. The top specimen also shows the use of stylized human faces incorporated into the ornament.

Reproduced by per- mission of Oxford University Press.</page><page sequence="27">Later Prehistory of Central Europe 265 appearance of the groups known as Celts, a name that first appears, in the form of the Greek Keltoi (Chapman, 1992), around this same time [see Pauli (1980) for a succinct discussion of the question]. This link is complex and problematic, because it deals with two very different kinds of evidence, and it depends upon an analysis of what the Greek writers meant, or thought they meant, when they used the name Keltoi. I do not deal with this issue further here (see Rankin, 1995) but focus exclusively on the ar- chaeological evidence. The development of the new style represents a radi- cal innovation among groups in the Hallstatt stylistic tradition that had developed consistently without break since at least the start of the Late Bronze Age around 1200 B.C. The new style requires explanation, and it can best be understood in terms of identity expression, as Pauli and Frey have argued. The first development of the La Tene style was in the context of elites in Iron Age society. The occurrence of objects ornamented in the new style correlates directly with the rich graves of La le ne phase A, and these are restricted to specific landscapes, particularly the western Middle Rhineland. The burial practice associated with the Early La Tene style was similar to that of the Late Hallstatt rich graves, but new features were introduced as well. Common to the Late Hallstatt and the Early La Tene rich graves are wooden chambers under tumuli, wheeled vehicles, gold ring jewelry, imported vessels from the Mediterranean world, and weapons in the men's graves. This strong degree of similarity suggests that the group in the Mid- dle Rhineland practicing this new ritual consciously identified with the elites at the Late Hallstatt centers and linked their practices closely with theirs. But they also strongly asserted their own identity in the form of important departures from the traditions of the Late Hallstatt centers. Most important was the new style, developed to create a new identity for the elite group. The origins of the motifs that made up the new style are clear (Frey, 1991, 1993; Jacobsthal, 1944; Megaw and Megaw, 1989). They were adapted from elements observed on Greek and Etruscan im- ported objects that were brought into temperate Europe, some of which have been recovered in settlement deposits and wealthy burials of the Late Hallstatt and Early La T¬£ne contexts. Instead of the four-wheeled wagons that characterized the wealthy Late Hallstatt graves, this new elite group used two-wheeled vehicles in their burial assemblages. The Late Hallstatt ornamental dagger was replaced with short swords, their scabbards orna- mented in the new style. The majority of the vessel imports from the Medi- terranean world were of Etruscan instead of Greek origin. The new style thus seems to have been created as part of the con- struction of a new identity by a rising elite group in a landscape close to that dominated by the elites of the Late Hallstatt context (Pare, 1991, p.</page><page sequence="28">266 Wells 199). The selection of motifs from imported vessels to form the basis of the new style is an indication of the importance that the southern contact played in the construction of identities in Iron Age central Europe. Through the style on their locally produced gold and bronze ornaments, as well as the actual imports represented in the graves, these elites were creating their special character in terms of signs and symbols borrowed and adapted from the larger, more complex societies of the Mediterranean lands. The objects ornamented in the new style were probably created by craft specialists, as Frey (1995a, p. 179) argues on the basis of the range of objects on which the new style is expressed. We have very little direct evidence of workshop activity for this period (Wells, 1996). All indications suggest that the equipment for metalworking was portable, and the craft- workers moved about, producing on order for their customers (Megaw and Megaw, 1990, pp. 85-86). Style and Identity Across La Tene Europe (400-150 B.C.) The new style of decoration remained restricted to elite contexts for only a couple of generations, then it spread in use throughout the regions of southern-central Europe where the Hallstatt style had been dominant in the Early Iron Age (Fig. 4). Elite burials are much fewer in number after about 400 B.C. than during the earliest phase of the La Tene style (Joachim, 1995), as are the ornate craft products and the Mediterranean imports. But in the abundant flat inhumation graves of the middle of the La Tene period (La Tene phases B and C, about 400-150 B.C.), a wide range of personal ornaments, mostly of bronze, but also of iron, silver, and sometimes gold, was ornamented in the new style. Most of the ornaments occur in women's burials, but in many men's graves sword scabbards bear important expression of La Tene decoration. Since De Navarro's (1972) study of the swords and scabbards from the site of La Tene in western Switzerland, considerable research attention has been devoted to the ornamented scabbards. The application of deco- ration in the La Tene style to such objects began early in the development of that style, already during the fifth century B.C. on scabbards of short swords in some of the richly outfitted burials in the Middle Rhineland and in the Marne region (Ginoux, 1994). Ginoux argues that the application of ornate patterns in the new style to scabbards underscores the new sym- bolic significance of swords. As noted above, already at the beginning of the Late Bronze Age, around 1200 B.C., swords became regular accoutre- ments of elite men's graves in central Europe, and throughout the Early</page><page sequence="29">Later Prehistory of Central Europe 267 Hi ||| f√Æt 111 l!i E.S d 0 ¬´- ~ ois III ¬´si !|√Æ ‚Ä¢E√°√ä ‚Ä¢E√°√ä fil 1 g-i i I8.tl fr¬ß√ç¬£ SU ei</page><page sequence="30">268 Wells Iron Age swords or their smaller representatives- the daggers of the Late Hallstatt rich graves- were commonly placed in wealthy men's graves. New in the fifth century B.C. was the application of ornamentation to scabbards. As was also the case with other aspects of La lene ornament, the sword decoration was an expression restricted to the relatively small group of rich graves, but in the fourth and third centuries B.C. this expression was widely adopted by a broad populace throughout the southern regions of central Europe (Pleiner, 1993). The significance of the spread of the La Tf√®ne style, both in personal ornaments and in weapons, from the elite objects represented in a small group of wealthy burials to the small communities throughout southern cen- tral Europe during the fourth century B.C., relates to the question of iden- tity among the communities of the different regions (√õima√Ø, 1991). Frey (1993, p. 161) suggests that the relatively rapid spread of the new style indicates that a common identity existed among those peoples; they may have adopted the new style as a means of creating a common identity and expressing their unity. Fitzpatrick (1996, p. 248) is more cautious in his interpretation. He warns that we cannot assume from the widespread adop- tion of the new style that all of the people who constituted the communities in which it is represented necessarily felt that they belonged to a single ethnic group. But, he goes on, through the practice of using objects orna- mented in the style as part of their routine in everyday life, they may have created for themselves a sense of belonging to a common, overarching cul- tural entity. As for the case of the construction of the common identity that we call "Hallstatt culture" in the Early Iron Age (see above), here, too, we need to ask, what changes were taking place during the fourth century B.C. that encouraged the construction of a common identity among the peoples of the different landscapes from central France to Slovakia? One answer is interaction with other peoples, a factor that frequently results in greater efforts to create and express identities through the construction of new ex- pressions of material culture. In this case, interactions with peoples of the Mediterranean regions are well documented. Both historical and archae- ological sources attest to the migration of peoples (called Celts or Gauls by the Greek and Roman authors) from north and west of the Alps across the mountain passes into northern Italy (Frey, 1995b; Pare, 1991). These movements brought the peoples of central Europe into direct interaction with peoples in the Alpine regions and in different parts of Italy, including the Po Plain and the Adriatic coastal regions especially. Interaction was sometimes violent but probably sometimes peaceful as well. Such interac- tion usually results in the interacting parties' becoming more conscious of their own identities and making efforts to assert them, for example, by ere-</page><page sequence="31">Later Prehistory of Central Europe 269 ating material signs to express their solidarity among their fellows and their distinctiveness from the others with whom they are engaged in interaction. In the newly settled lands of Italy, the arrivals from central Europe con- tinued to produce objects ornamented in the La l√®ne style, thus continu- ously recreating their identities through construction of their material culture in their new homelands (Salzani and Vitali, 1995). Structural Change and Outsiders' Accounts: The End of Prehistory The second and final centuries B.C. appear to be a period of unusually profound and rapid change, but we must exercise caution in concluding this because the nature of our sources of information changes. For this period, the Classical written sources that concern peoples north of the Alps are much more abundant than ever before, and they provide much more specific information, especially concerning movements of peoples (Rankin, 1995). We learn the names of many "tribal" groups and where they were located, and about migrations of peoples. Archaeologists working on topics in the final two centuries before Christ are strongly influenced by the Greek and Roman writers. We need to ask critically, if we were to judge by the archaeological evidence alone, whether this period would appear to be so exceptional compared to earlier ones. Textual Sources: Problems and Potential Since the rediscovery of Greek and Roman texts in European monas- teries late in the Renaissance, the descriptions of the indigenous peoples by Classical writers- especially Caesar [1917 (mid-final century B.C.)] and Tacitus [1970 (end first century A.D.)], writing about regions now in France, Belgium, The Netherlands, and Germany- have played important roles in modern Europeans' thinking about their early history (Dietler, 1994; Fleury-Ilett, 1996; Goffart, 1995; Schama, 1995). The Classical education received by many of the 19th-century elites who were active in the devel- opment of archaeology gave those individuals strongly positive ideas about the Greek and Roman writers. Because of the existence of these texts per- taining to the peoples encountered by Caesar in the final century B.C. and by Tacitus in the first century A.D., early fieldwork in late prehistoric ar- chaeology was connected, in the minds of the practioners, directly with those sources. Whether or not they were conscious of doing so, these early investigators accepted the Classical texts as fact and perceived their goals with regard to the archaeological evidence as supporting and sometimes expanding upon the accounts left by the Roman writers, but not challenging</page><page sequence="32">270 Wells them or offering a substantially different picture. This approach to the Ro- man texts and the archaeology is still prevalent today. But some ancient historians and archaeologists are developing a dif- ferent approach to the texts. Theirs is a critical approach that does not accept the Classical texts at face value but, like much recent research on early modern European encounters with other peoples around the world (e.g., Schwartz, 1994; Whitehead, 1995), views them as interpretations by specific Greek and Roman commentators, in particular historical circum- stances, of peoples and practices that they did not fully understand. Dobesch (1989), Timpe (1986, 1989), and Christ (1995) have been instru- mental among historians in developing this new approach to the textual sources. From these new understandings of the Roman texts, together with interpretation of the ever-expanding archaeological database, we can inter- pret Caesar's assertions- that the people who lived west of the Rhine were Celts and those east of the Rhine were Germans- in a new light. What Caesar meant when he used the name "Germans" was probably very dif- ferent from the kind of ethnic group that most recent historians have imag- ined. He was referring to peoples culturally and linguistically similar to those living west of the Rhine (whom he called Gauls) but who were in the throes of profound changes in their settlement systems and economies, and in the ways they expressed their identities through their material cul- ture (Wells, 1995a). Caesar, Tacitus, and other Roman writers around the time of Christ name a large number of groups who have been referred to in recent re- search as tribes or nations, such as Aedui, Boii, Helvetii, Sequani, Suebi, and so forth. Like the name "German," these names have traditionally been assumed to designate stable, long-existing peoples, and archaeologists often have tried to distinguish these groups named by the Roman writers by their archaeological characteristics (e.g., Peschel, 1978; Wegewitz, 1977). But re- cent research challenges the very existence of these groups as distinct en- tities in the way they were portrayed by the Roman commentators (Champion, 1995; Roymans, 1990; Wolfram, 1995). The names that come down to us are the Romans' designations for the groups, not their own. We do not know what they called themselves, nor do we have any direct evidence that they even regarded themselves as distinct groups. Ferguson and Whitehead (1992) argue that "tribes" are a characteristic form of po- litical organization that develop on the peripheries of empires (see also Fried, 1967)- they come into existence only when relatively undifferenti- ated communities interact with more complex sociopolitical systems. If this model is correct, then most of the tribal groups named by the Roman writ- ers came into being only as the result of interaction with the Roman world during the late second and first centuries B.C. and had no historical, tra-</page><page sequence="33">Later Prehistory of Central Europe 271 ditional identities as tribes or nations. Hence trying to identify groups such as Cimbri, Helvetii, and Suebi on the basis of archaeological evidence, at times before those names appear in the Roman texts, is attempting to find discrete entities that did not exist. Despite these cautions surrounding use of the Classical sources, the ancient writers can be useful sources of information if used with critical care. The point is that we cannot simply take their statements at face value; we need to deconstruct their texts using ail of the resources available to us. The written sources are helpful in providing information about histori- cal contexts during the late second and the final century B.C., particularly regarding interaction between peoples in different parts of Europe. Roman activity in southern Gaul became increasingly active from the final decades of the second century B.C. on, and its impact is apparent in the great in- crease in Roman goods that were brought northward into Gaul and, to some extent, across the Rhine (Feug√®re and Rolley, 1991). Also in the final decades of the second century B.C., peoples inhabiting lands in northern parts of the continent- among them groups called Cimbri and Teutones by the Classical writers- migrated southward and conflicted with peoples liv- ing in central Europe (Hedeager, 1992). As they migrated, they were joined by members of other groups, and at the end of the second century B.C. they engaged Roman armies in a series of major battles in southern France and northern Italy. Texts indicate that mercenaries from central and western Europe served in armies in Greece and other parts of the eastern Medi- terranean and subsequently returned to their homelands (Szab√≥, 1991). The signficance of such information from the written sources is in providing a context that can aid in interpreting the archaeological evidence for inter- action and in providing mechanisms for our understanding of patterns in the archaeological evidence that relate to the expression of identity. Archaeology of Interaction and Identity In the present state of our understanding of the archaeology of this period, it is not possible to link specific archaeological materials with the movements of peoples described in the written sources. The written ac- counts are probably in most cases incomplete reports about processes much larger than the writers were aware of (discussion by Hansen, 1995, pp. 385- 437). The archaeological evidence does show increased contact and inter- action between peoples in different parts of Europe during these centuries, and in that respect it is consistent with the texts. Increased interaction be- tween central Europe and northern parts of the continent is apparent in</page><page sequence="34">272 Wells larger quantities of materials from central Europe in the north, including personal ornaments, weapons, wheeled vehicles, and metal vessels (Mar- tens, 1992; Roymans and van Rooijen, 1993; Stary, 1993; Wells, 1994). The nature of the interactions that lay behind the circulation of these different categories of goods is complex and varied (Wells, 1995c). Different mecha- nisms were operating, including gift exchange, plunder, and barter trade, and each kind of object needs to be investigated separately, a task beyond the purpose of this paper. At the same time that these interactions were intensifying during the second century B.C., in central Europe larger communities were forming than had existed before anywhere north of the Alps. These are the op- pida- large fortified settlements that appeared across the whole of La Tene Europe from the middle of the second century B.C. on (Fig. 5). Just as the cemeteries of La Tene B and C displayed a strong degree of stylistic homogeneity across central Europe that distinguished them from the Jas- torf groups to the north and the Alpine peoples to the south, the oppida showed significant signs of homogeneity (Maier, 1991). Architecturally, they shared important features in the technique of construction of surrounding walls and in the form of the gates. Organization and structure of the set- tlements within the walls show striking similarities, for example among the well-excavated sites of Manching in southern Germany (Gebhard, 1993), Stare Hradisko in Moravia (Meduna, 1970), and Villeneuve-Saint-Germain in northern France (Haselgrove, 1995). The development of these large centers contrasted strongly with the situation on the North European Plain, where small-scale and noncentralized patterns of economic and political organization dominated (H√§ssler, 1991), and with that in the Alpine re- gions, where communities also remained small and less integrated (Gleir- scher, 1993). Examination of the oppida reveals significant information about chang- ing patterns of identity during this turbulent period. On the one hand, shared characteristics among the oppidum communities, including wall ar- chitecture, internal organization, and general features of pottery (Salac and von Carnap-Bornheim, 1994), coinage, and personal ornaments, express a marked degree of homogeneity among the peoples of the southern parts of central Europe relative to groups to the north and south. In this sense, the oppida conveyed the common identity of peoples who employed the La Tene style of decoration. On the other hand, every oppidum also has some distinctive features in its architecture, pottery, and coinage (Woolf, 1993). Thus in the oppida we can identify two opposing forces at work. One is the creation and expression of a common identity among the peoples sharing the La Tene style in southern central Europe; the other is the</page><page sequence="35">Later Prehistory of Central Europe 273 Q.

Celts and Germans: Ethnic Identity at the Time of the Roman Conquests Any treatment of ethnic identity at the time of the Roman conquest must begin with Julius Caesar's [1917 (mid-final centuiy B.C.)] commen- taries concerning his campaigns in Gaul, between 58 and 51 B.C., since they have formed the basis of discussion of this issue among archaeologists. Caesar was the first writer to describe in some detail the peoples he called Germans, and in his account he draws clear distinctions between the peo- ples he refers to as Gauls (or Celts) and Germans. Through his campaigns in Gaul, Caesar became familiar with the peoples of that region firsthand, and he describes their social and political systems, their economies, and their settlements in terms that permit easy comparison to Rome. Caesar informs his readers that the Rhine River formed the boundary between the Gauls and the Germans, the Gauls living west of the Rhine and Ger- mans east of it. He characterizes the peoples he calls Germans, with whom he was not directly familiar, as much less like Romans than the Gauls were, with smaller communities, simpler economies, and less refined religious practices (Zeitler, 1986). Besides drawing this broad distinction between Gauls and Germans, Caesar also names and describes numerous subgroups among them, commonly referred to as tribes or nations, such as Arverni, Boii, Helvetii, Suebi, and Iteveri. The next major commentator on the peo- ples called Germans was Tacitus, writing about A.D. 100, and his under- standing of the term derived in large measure from Caesar's usage. Archaeological approaches to study of ethnicity in the Late Iron Age have focused mainly on trying to identify archaeologically the groups as they are cited and located by Caesar [recent examples with extensive bibliog- raphies are St√∂ckli (1993) and Rieckhoff (1995)]. In essence, the common procedure has been to examine material culture in regions linked by Caesar with specific groups he names, then ascribe that particular material culture to that named group. There are several methodological problems with this approach. First, Caesar was an outsider with only limited familiarity with the peoples and the environments he was describing; many of the groups were enemies. As noted above, in most cases we do not know what the groups called themselves or even if they regarded themselves as coherent entities in the ways that Caesar and other Romans portrayed them. Second, the time at which Caesar was writing- the middle of the final century B.C.- was a period of turmoil throughout central Europe, in part</page><page sequence="37">Later Prehistory of Central Europe 275 because of the Roman conquests but because of other factors as well. The Roman military campaigns in Gaul between 58 and 51 B.C. of course cre- ated crisis situations there. Even east of the Rhine, many of the major oppida, including Manching and Kelheim, were abandoned around that time, and the inhabitants moved into smaller settlements in the countryside. Hence the situation Caesar observed and describes in his account (assuming that he tried to be as accurate as possible) was probably quite different from the state of affairs before his arrival on the scene. The character of the groups known to Caesar was probably different from that of the pre- Caesarian peoples of temperate Europe. Third, the approach takes no account of the exercise of choice and free will on the part of people in central Europe. Tb suggest that a par- ticular type of fibula is Germanic and that a pot form is Celtic is to ignore the human propensity to adopt new forms and motifs when they are in- troduced from outside. Particularly in the decades before and during Cae- sar's time, the intensive interactions between peoples throughout Europe meant considerable exchange of goods and opportunities to adopt new styles and design elements from other groups. Instead of relying on Caesar's account for our understanding of the Late Iron Age peoples of Europe, we need instead to devise means to let those peoples speak for themselves, to inform us how they defined their identities and who they considered themselves to be. The archaeological evidence enables us to approach the question from the standpoint of the categories of sameness and difference that the indigenous groups estab- lished for themselves, not ones created by the Romans. Recent research on how people use their material culture to construct their identities pro- vides a useful methodology. From this perspective, we can observe two significant trends in the ar- chaeological evidence from the second half of the final century B.C.- the time just after Caesar's conquest of Gaul (west of the Rhine) but before the Roman conquests of lands east of the Rhine. One is the adoption by elites throughout temperate Europe- both west and east of the Rhine and both in the central uplands and on the North European Plain- of a common set of objects that signaled elite status identity. They include long Late La T√®ne-style iron swords, spurs, bronze vessels, gold and silver ornaments, and four-wheeled wagons (Figs. 6 and 7). All of these objects represent cate- gories that were linked with elite status during the Late Bronze Age and earlier phases of the Iron Age. Important in this context is that this "inter- national elite style" of the second half of the final century B.C. indicates the emergence of a common elite identity among groups on both sides of the Roman frontier, and on both sides of the long-standing cultural divide between the La Tene areas of the central uplands and the Jastorf areas of</page><page sequence="38">276 Wells the North European Plain (Frey, 1986; V√∂lling, 1992a). The development of this interregionally common set of identifiers shows that, while the Roman conquests were progressing west of the Rhine and south of the Danube, elites in groups that had previously distinguished themselves from one an- other by the La Tene style, on the one hand, and the Jastorf style, on the other, were creating a new, unified identity. One explanation is that because the Roman armies constituted such a powerful and all-encompassing "other," the formerly self-distinguishing La Tene and Jastorf groups con- structed a stylistic commonality to identify themselves collectively as resisting indigenous peoples. Thus the development of this interregional set of status items, representing elite individuals' identity as warriors, horse riders, gen- erous hosts, and persons of wealth, can be viewed as the active creation of a specific identity to counter the effects of the spread of Rome's power north of the Alps (see discussion by Ament, 1984, 1986). A similar pattern in adoption of common signifiers across the previous La T√®ne-Jastorf material-cultural boundaries is apparent among some categories of objects that are not associated exclusively with elites. In this period designated La IB ne D2 in the relative chronology, for the first time a number of different types of fibulae came into use that are widely dis- tributed both within the formerly La Tene culture area and in the formerly Jastorf culture area (R. M√ºller, 1994; Rieckhoff, 1992, 1995; V√∂lling, 1994a). At the present, it is generally not clear where they were being pro- duced, because researchers have not focused on the important question of production places and instead assume, without support, that where objects have been most densely found is where they were made. Significant is the dissolution of the cultural boundary between La Tene and Jastorf areas at the time of Rome's expansion. The second major change at this time is the renewal of traditional practices in much of temperate Europe, including southern Germany, where oppida had been abandoned shortly before the middle of the final century B.C. This change is apparent in the recreation of the practice of burial and in the return to manufacturing patterns of prc-oppidum time, such as in making pottery by hand (instead of with the wheel) and in casting bronze ornaments individually (instead of producing them in series). The focus of attention in discussion of the Celt-German problem in this context has been a group of 1 1 burials at the sites of H√∂rgertshausen, Kronwinkl, TCaunstein, and Uttenhofen in southern Bavaria and a larger number in northern Bavaria, centered on the cemetery of Aubstadt, together with a small number of contemporaneous settlements (Rieckhoff, 1995), The buri- als display a variety of different rituals, including inhumation and crema- tion, and tumulus and flat graves. The objects placed in them reflect a combination of elements developed locally in the La Tene area, on the</page><page sequence="39">Later Prehistory of Central Europe 277 111 .si 9 S ¬£ -e O -S g *|2 m ill ¬´2-SS- ||| √çI* l√†- ‚Äû g &lt;x ill I¬ª Ili Ilt√¨ lili ¬ªill *|sl # ¬´ s E.S¬´√ë</page><page sequence="40">278 Wells I JC ‚Ä¢S√Ø ¬ß¬ø | "8 il fi¬´ l√¨ |√≠ O ^^ C &gt;- ' √≠√≠ ‚Ä¢Ig li "Bi ¬ø| o -5 o -5 S ** o ^&gt; oo.g c o ‚ñ†? 8. Q. 03 r^</page><page sequence="41">Later Prehistory of Central Europe 279 one hand, and to the north in the middle Elbe-Saale region of central Ger- many, on the other (Figs. 8 and 9). Many studies have argued, on the basis of fibulae, belthooks, and pottery shapes, that these graves represent "im- migrant Germans" [Rieckhoff (1995) reviews all of the relevant literature], but the presence of characteristic local La Tene elements, such as the wheelmade rather than handmade pottery, has always cast some doubt on those interpretations. New approaches to the problem of archaeological identity, as well as a Europe-wide rather than a regional perspective on the questions raised by these graves, enable us to propose a different in- terpretation. I turn to a brief discussion of some of the objects in these graves that have formed the basis of discussions in the past. The objects that are likely to provide the best information are the per- sonal ornaments and the pottery. Past arguments about these graves have been based largely on distributions of particular types of fibulae and belthooks. The fibulae in these La Tene D2 graves are limited to variants of the geschweifte type of fibula (17 specimens), the Beltz Variant J form (4 specimens), and an Early La T¬£ne -type fibula. Recent studies of many of these categories provide valuable evidence for assessing their relevance to the question of identity. The Beltz Variant J fibula has been argued to be representative of "Germanic" groups from the middle Elbe-Saale re- gion; distribution maps show a concentration of finds there (V√ñlling, 1994a, Map 1). But there are other concentrations of Beltz J fibulae elsewhere, including the area around Berlin, along the lower course of the Vistula, and just west of the Thuringian Forest. No fewer than nine find-spots are represented in southeastern Bavaria. For the variants of the geschweifte fibulae, the distributions are even broader. One variant, the Almgren 18a fibula, represented at H√∂rgertshausen, Uttenhofen, and Aubstadt, is widely distributed from central France to Poland, from Croatia to central Jut- land-that is, on both sides of the Rhine and in both northern and southern central Europe. No marked concentration is apparent anywhere in the dis- tribution. Another variant, the Kostrzewski Ma fibula, present at Kronwinkl and at the settlements of Regensburg-Harting and Thalmassing, occurs widely east of the Rhine, with many finds in central and northern Germany, Bohemia, and Poland (V√ñlling, 1994a, Map 5). These distributions of the fibulae represented in the La Tene D2 finds suggest that the individuals buried in the graves had access to, and selected, a variety of forms in use at the time throughout much of Europe. Regional divisions between style groups were breaking down, and many types were becoming universally used. The distributions do not indicate in any way that the people wearing these fibulae necessarily came from the middle Elbe-Saale region, or from any other particular area.</page><page sequence="42">280 Wells Fig. 8. A bronze fibula and bronze belthook from Grave 1 (top) and two bronze fibulae from Grave 2 (bottom) at Kronwinkl in Lower Bavaria.

Here, too, the distribution does not suggest anything about the place of origin of the wearers. V√∂lling (1994b) suggests that these belthooks were made largely by mobile metalsmiths traveling through dif- ferent parts of central Europe, producing specimens individually as they were requested by customers. New Expressions and New Identities The wide distribution of the types that are common in these La Tene D2 graves is part of a phenomenon apparent in a variety of different cate- gories of objects- both elite and everyday, as noted above. The objects in these burials do not suggest any particular connection with the middle Elbe-Saale region but, instead, reflect the wider development taking place throughout the continent. Thus there is no compelling reason to see them as graves of immigrants. Much more likely they are graves of local people who adopted new styles during this dynamic period. With the wide-ranging circulation of goods and people during the final century B.C. in temperate Europe, exceptionally wide choices became available in types of fibulae and belthooks, forms and decoration of pottery, and, for the elites, swords, spurs, ornate bronze vessels, and gold and silver ornaments. At the time when Roman armies were active west of the Rhine, the distribution of such objects indicates exceptionally active circulation, adoption, and transforma- tion of objects traditionally used to communicate identity. In the process of adopting new styles, types, and patterns of ornament, people east of the Rhine were constructing new identities during this tur- bulent time. The traditional La l√®ne -Jastorf boundary was giving way to a sharing of styles, particularly among elites throughout central Europe, but also in fibulae, belthooks, and other ornaments among broad segments of the populations. This pattern of sharing styles created among the par- ticipants a new kind of identity, one that distinguished them not only from the Roman armies imposing themselves on the landscape, but also from the newly Romanized populations in conquered Gaul. This approach to the question of material culture and identity provides a new perspective into the nature of the changes that took place among the indigenous peoples of temperate Europe at the time of the Roman conquests. It enables us to examine not only changes in settlement patterns and economic systems, but also changes in the ways that people chose to define their identities during this period of turmoil and stress. Particularly important in our understanding of this context are current models of eth- nicity as flexible and situational. People define their identities and structure</page><page sequence="46">284 Wells their material culture in ways that they perceive as advantageous to them under the particular circumstances in which they find themselves at any given point in time. The abandonment of the oppida and the end of the oppidum civiliza- tion brought challenges to the peoples of southern central Europe, with their shared traditions of potteiy, metalwork, glass ornaments, and coinage. After the big centers were abandoned and the former occupants moved to smaller communities in the countryside, those communities could not sup- port the specialized level of manufacturing activity that the larger commu- nities had maintained at the oppida or the economic integration that the coinage system provided. Hence the character of manufactured goods took the form of less complex, more handcrafted, and less standardized material. In contrast to the ceramics at the oppida, most of the pottery at the set- tlements of this phase, such as at Regensburg-Harting and Thalmassing, is handmade, coarse, and plain. Fibulae too reflect a shift from the series production of such types as the Nauheim, to individualized, handcrafted manufacture. For example, the two fibulae of Kostrzewski Ma type in Grave 2 at Kronwinkl (Fig. 8, bottom) are not like any other known specimens (V√∂lling, 1994a, p. 194, Fig. 22); they were not mass-produced, like fibulae at the oppida, but individually crafted. All 15 variants of the geschweifte fibulae at Aubstadt are unique (V√∂lling, 1995). Graphite could no longer be acquired regularly for addition to the clay for the characteristic graph- ite-clay pottery of the oppidum period. Production of glass bracelets and beads declined precipitously. The dislocations that accompanied the breakup of the communities at the oppida, the movement out of those cen- ters, and the establishment of new communities, new subsistence practices, and new craft organization were amplified by other factors, including mi- grations of groups through central Europe and political effects of the Ro- man presence west of the Rhine. In circumstances of cultural dislocation and social stress, people take active measures to recreate their identities in ways that they think will as- sure their continued existence as individuals and as members of the groups with which they identify. People in different communities perceive their options and opportunities in different ways. With the breakdown in the relative unity of the oppida during La Tene DI, there was less incentive for different communities to establish shared signs and practices. Different groups developed different strategies to further their own ends. In this light, we can understand the diversity of responses of peoples east of the Rhine in the post-oppidum period. Some communities, such as those in southeastern Bavaria represented by the graves we have been discussing, recreated the practice of burial, which had been given up a couple of generations earlier, by reaching back</page><page sequence="47">Later Prehistory of Central Europe 285 into traditional memory to reuse symbols from the indigenous past. They recreated the practice of burial but expressed it in diverse forms- inhuma- tion in the case of Ttaunstein, enclosure and tumulus in the case of H√∂r- gertshausen, and various forms of cremation flat grave in the other cases. The categories of objects placed in the burials were the same as those from earlier times- fibulae, belthooks, knives, and pottery. Different communities recreated their identities in different ways, usu- ally by combining traditional elements of material culture with new fashions introduced from other regions. Results of such amalgamations are apparent, but the mechanisms by which new elements were introduced are not clear at present. They probably included intermarriage between communities, and thus movement of individuals from one community to another, resettlement by familities or by whole communities, and exchange. At Dingolshausen in Franconia, pottery of a form that resembles that common at the Thuringian cemetery of Grossromstedt, 140 km to the northeast, is made of a graphite and clay mixture. The form indicates ideas from outside, while the technol- ogy reflects local traditions (Rosenstock and W√§mser, 1989). At a number of sites in northern Bavaria in this period, pottery was thrown on the wheel, a technique characteristic of local Late La Tene phase Dl tradition. But some of it was decorated with wheel-made impressions, a feature introduced from lands to the north and east. Other vessels whose shapes suggest tra- ditions from those same regions have specific features, such as a bulge at the neck, that indicate continuation of local practices (Pescheck, 1978). Re- cent excavations at Mittelbuchen in Hesse have revealed pottery of form and decoration characteristic of groups farther east, but in contexts with typical local pottery and metal jewelry (Seidel, 1996). Summary: Ethnic Identity The categories Celt (or Gaul) and German were defined and applied by outsiders- Greeks and Romans- to the peoples of central Europe. From the Renaissance, when the Classical texts were rediscovered and stud- ied for their significance to the emerging nations of Europe of that time, to the present day, those names have dominated both historical and ar- chaeological research into cultural, or ethnic, identities of the late prehis- toric peoples of temperate Europe. But the archaeological evidence does not support those ethnic divisions. New approaches to questions of ethnic identity, based on archaeological analysis, enable us to work toward devel- oping a new understanding of the patterns of identity in Late Iron Age Europe.</page><page sequence="48">286 Wells From the Early Iron Age until the Roman conquest of Gaul in the middle of the final century B.C., the material evidence shows the persist- ence of two large regional groupings of peoples in central Europe, one in the southern upland areas that created the Hallstatt and La l√®ne styles of decoration and one on the North European Plain that created the Jastorf style. Between the seventh and the first centuries B.C., these style regions maintained their distinctive identities through constant recreation and change in their styles of ornamentation. During the final century B.C., this stylistic divide broke down, with rapid adoption in each region of forms, styles, and decorative details formerly characteristic of the other (Jocken- h√∂vel, 1990; V√∂lling, 1992b; Waldhauser, 1992). Traditionally, these changes have been interpreted mainly in terms of migrations, but close examination of the evidence from graves and settlements suggests that people con- sciously borrowed motifs and styles and transformed them into locally meaningful objects and decorations for the purpose of constructing new identities. These mechanisms were probably more important than move- ments of peoples. If we view these changes in the Europe-wide context of Rome's ex- pansion into the lands north of the Alps, we can understand the changes in terms of new priorities in the creation of identities among the peoples of the still unconquered regions. Distinctions that the groups in southern central Europe and those in northern regions had constructed and main- tained between the seventh and the first centuries B.C. paled in the face of the powerful new threat to the identities of all indigenous peoples posed by the Roman conquests. CONCLUSION The approach presented here- focusing on material culture as a me- dium for communicating information and viewing humans as active, deci- sion-making agents- is more in concert with our current understanding of identity and cultural change than is the traditional attempt to identify ar- chaeologically peoples whom Greeks and Romans named Celts and Ger- mans. This approach enables us to examine the ways in which indigenous peoples experienced the conquests of European landscapes by the Roman armies, and to see the ways in which they employed material signs from their own past traditions to construct new identities that would help them adapt to the changing world in which they found themselves. Related proc- esses continued throughout the Roman period. Examining the evidence from this point of view, we can develop a new perspective on the series of processes commonly known as "Romanization" (Fasold, 1993; Freeman,</page><page sequence="49">Later Prehistory of Central Europe 287 1993; Goudineau, 1991; Roymans, 1995), a topic beyond the scope of this paper.
