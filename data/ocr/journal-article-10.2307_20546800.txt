<plain_text><page sequence="1">Jonathan S. Burgess EARLY IMAGES OF ACHILLES AND MEMNON?* JN EO-ANALYSTS have persuasively argued that the Iliad indirectly demon strates knowledge of the duel between Achilles and Memnon.1 Yet the Aethiopis, the Epic Cycle poem that narrates their duel, is usually thought to be later than the Homeric poems,2 and undoubted representations of Memnon begin only in the sixth century. A skeptic might therefore con sider the encounter between Achilles and Memnon a post-Iliadic inven tion.3 But mythological images are no measure of the date of mythology; representations of myths often precede their attestation in literature, and vice-versa.4 And by comparison we should note that representations of the duel between Achilles and Hector do not precede those of Achilles and Memnon; in fact, images of Hector dueling Achilles are rare even in the sixth century, and often non-Homeric at that.5 Iconographical evi dence tends to lead to a conclusion already suggested by apparent reflec tions of the Memnon story in the Iliad: that Memnon was a well-known pre-Homeric character. To confirm further the antiquity of myth about * A version of this article was read at the CAC annual conference in Quebec City in 1999.

The ancient dating of Arctinus, to whom the poem was ascribed, in the eighth cen tury (Aethiopis test. 1-7 Bernab?) is not trustworthy. The late seventh century is common ly regarded as a terminus post quern because a) Arctinus was a citizen of Miletos, which be gan to colonize the north Black Sea ca. 625 and b) the Aethiopis narrated Achilles' trans lation to Leuke (Proclus), which was the name of an island in the north Black Sea that played an important role in hero cult for Achilles. Yet ascriptions to authors for Cyclic poems are generally dubious (see Davies 1989, 5-6;) and, as many have seen, the "White Island" of the Aethiopis may have been entirely mythological, located somewhere at the edges of the earth. It is quite possible that scholars attributed the poem to a Milesian poet solely because it happened to mention Leuke, which had became localized in the Black Sea and therefore associated with Miletus. 3.

BURGESS Achilles and Memnon I will consider two representations that might de pict their duel at a rather early date, one from the mid-seventh century and the second from the beginning of that century. What is more, I will explore concepts inherent in this heroic encounter through an examina tion of a Mycenaean wall fresco. Literary sources rarely give much detail about the duel between Achilles and Memnon, and usually the encounter is only briefly men tioned.6 It is artists who provide us with many details of the story. Depic tions of the duel become popular in the sixth century. The scene was por trayed in a variety of ways. Sometimes charioteers await the warriors on each side. A very common characteristic is the presence of the mothers of the heroes, Thetis and Eos, standing behind their battling sons. When no inscriptions are available, often this schema plausibly identifies what might seem to be a generic duel. The outcome of the duel between Achilles and Memnon was com monly thought to be decided by a divine use of scales. Though this scene became common in art, it is rare in surviving literature.7 It is often thought that it was present in the Aethiopis of the Epic Cycle, though it is not mentioned in the summary by Proclus. The assumption that the Aethiopis did portray the scene is probably correct, but one should not consider the Cycle poem the single source for images of Memnon, or for later poetic references for that matter. The motif of divine scales is em ployed a few times in the Iliad, though of course not in reference to Achilles and Memnon. The Homeric instance most comparable to our myth is the use of divine scales to signal the outcome of the duel between Achilles and Hector in Book 22 of the Riad.8 Whereas the Homeric motif involved the weighing of keres, or fates, and thus technically is a kerostasia, the title of the lost Psychostasia by Aeschylus indicates that here the souls of the two heroes were weighed.9 There is much confusion, both in the ancient and modern worlds, be tween the concepts of psyche, her, and eidolon.10 In the Homeric poems a psyche is the soul, or more literally "breath," that remains united with the 6.

See now West 2000 for a reconstruction of the trilogy in which this play would have been. His thesis that the trilogy ended with the Nerdds, which involved the funeral of Achilles, is attractive. Arguably the source for such a trilogy could have been Cyclic type epic that joined what we think of as Iliadic events with post-Iliadic events (cf. Kopff 1983). 10. For recent discussion on keres, psychai, and eidola, especially their iconography, see</page><page sequence="3">EARLY IMAGES OF ACHILLES AND MEMNON? 35 body and only leaves at death (Bremmer 1983). Then it may be an afterlife manifestation of a person, dwelling in Hades. Keres are also linked with each mortal from his birth, but they are conceived as being external to the body. They are thought to arrive at the moment of death, and so are often described as hateful or destructive. More neutrally, they can simply be equated with the fate of a human, as when Achilles famously claims he can choose between two keres, or destinies, in II. 9. The physical manifes tation of the psyche and her in epic is not clear. The psyche is birdlike in that it flies up from the corpse and on to Hades, making a twittering sound; it can be compared to bats (Od. 24, 5-9). But when it becomes apparent to mortals in unusual circumstances (as when the shade of Patroclus appears to Achilles in II. 22, or Odysseus interviews shades in Od. 11) it appears ex actly like the dead man, if without substance. The her in the kerostasia mo tif is implied to have a substantiality that can be weighed, at least. As a representative of death, or death-demon, it seems anthropomorphic when described dragging corpses in battle on the shield of Achilles, and in almost identical lines, on the Hesiodic shield of Heracles (J?. 18, 535-538; Hesiodic Shield 156-160; the Homeric passage is often suspected as an in terpolation). Here the her wears a bloody cloak, and another passage in the Hesiodic Shield describes gruesome keres at a battle in horrific detail (248-257). One might suspect that in epic an anthropomorphic manifesta tion for the psyche and her is a mere convenience, necessitated by the nar rative when a character observes a psyche or when an image of the her is described on an artifact. It is in this context that eidolon, or "image," should be understood, for in epic it can denote a psyche, apparently in ref erence to its ability to appear to others. Artists obviously needed to indicate a visual manifestation of the psyche and her. At times the psyche was portrayed as anthropomorphic, and early on it became conventional to show it as a miniature figure, usually winged. Pausanias (5, 19, 6) describes a her on the Chest of Kypselos as a woman with beastly teeth and nails standing behind the dying Polynices. The brief passage is significant because the chest of Kypselos apparently dates to the early sixth century, and uniquely this her image is identified by inscription (according to Pausanias). It is also probably the only known image of the her as a death-demon, since Vollkommer (1997) has convinc ingly argued that images of sphinx- and harpy-like demons are not keres.11 That leaves scenes of divine scales for possible artistic renderings of keres. Here as with psychai hovering by corpses and tombs we see a miniature figure, which is sometimes winged or armed. Vermeule 1979, 7-9, 23, 29-35, 39_4i&gt; 69, 76-77; Siebert 1981; Peifer 1989, esp. 11-14; Vollkom mer 1992,1997. The extensive older bibliography is cited there. 11. Though at Aesch. Sept. 777 the Theban sphinx is identified as a ker.</page><page sequence="4">36 JONATHAN S. BURGESS Since the eidola in corpse, tomb, and weighing scenes are similar, a dis tinction between psychai and keres iconography would have to depend on context. In fact conceptions of psychai and keres may have been more conflated and confused than is apparent in Homeric usage. Apparently when Aeschylus terms the divine judgement of the duel between Achilles and Memnon a psychostasia, the psyche is conceived of as existing outside the body before death. Scholiasts (to ?. 8, 70; 10, 209) branded the play wright's use of psychai instead of keres a misunderstanding of Homer, but it is not likely that Aeschylus was using the Iliad as his sole source. More probably he was following tradition about Achilles and Memnon, includ ing artistic convention. It is possible that sixth-century artists believed they were depicting a psychostasia and not a kerostasia.12 In any event, we cannot necessarily assume that the Homeric kerostasia is prior or more au thentic to the psychostasia. Here I will refer to the miniature figures on the vases as ddola and term the scene a psychostasia. The tiny size of the ddola would seem a convenience for artists, since otherwise they would too easily become confused with other human or (with wings) divine charac ters (Siebert 1981, 63-66). For both poets and artists, the depiction, or ei dolon, of a ker or psyche is thus probably more a matter of necessity than theology. In psychostasia depictions the eidola are usually winged, but not always; sometimes they are naked and other times fully armed. Much variety also existed in how the general scene was shown as well. The use of scales is sometimes shown on the same artifact on which the duel is represented. Sometimes the divine mothers plead with Zeus at Olympus for the lives of their sons. At other times the mothers anxiously watch the divine scales. They can also be seen rushing away after the outcome is indicated, Eos in distress and Thetis triumphant, presumably to join the mortal scene unfolding on the battlefield. The scene of judgment can even be mixed with the duel, as when the scales are held between the fighting warriors.13 Having established that the psychostasia and duel were well-known to artists of the sixth-century, let us now consider the possibility of earlier imagery of Achilles and Memnon. A seventh-century Melian amphora 12. Peifer 1989, 47-48 argues that the miniature ddolon was first used by artists for the ker, and subsequently for the psyche, since divine weighing scenes slightly proceed psyche scenes in the late sixth century. Vollkommer 1992 assumes that the weighing scenes de pict keres. Simon 1959, 72-73, followed by Kossatz-Deissmann 1981, 174, supposes that the artists were depicting psychai in these scenes. 13. Cf. limc s.w. 'Achilleus' nos. 797-806; 'Eos' nos. 293-299; 'Eos/Thesan' nos. 33-34; 'Hermes' nos. 622-629; 'Memnon' nos. 14-25, 98. One other aspect of the artistic images worth mentioning is that Hermes usually holds the scales, though in Aeschylus Zeus performed this function, as he does when divine scales are used in the Riad.</page><page sequence="5">EARLY IMAGES OF ACHILLES AND MEMNON? 37 (Fig. i) has been commonly thought to depict the duel.14 On the body of the vase is a depiction of Apollo and Artemis, with what may be two Muses or Hyperborean maidens. This central scene leads one to suspect that the image directly above it, on the neck, must be mythological. Here we see two warriors flanked by two women. This is a typical schema of Achilles dueling Memnon, and for that reason this representation is often interpreted as the first plausible image of Achilles and Memnon. Doubts about that interpretation have persisted, however, and indeed it is considered dubious by Kossatz-Deissmann in the limc15 There are no inscriptions, and some aspects of the representation are puzzling. First, there are the borders that separate the females from the warriors, which might seem to challenge the view that these women belong with the cen tral duel. But the alarmed gestures of the women indicate that they are connected with the central action, not gesticulating wildly to the empty air. And in the Archaic Age figures technically separated by a border could form a larger, coherent scene (Hurwit 1977). On the other hand, the bor ders here need not be without function: they could serve to indicate the division of dimension between the divine and the mortal. It would not be obvious to an artist how to express the idea that the goddesses watch the action from Olympus, or that they are on the battlefield but not visible to the human actors. As I noted above, later images of this episode approach the problem in a variety of ways; sometimes the Olympian and Trojan settings of the story are separated, sometimes juxtaposed, sometimes mixed together. A poet would similarly need to decide how to depict the interaction between the divine and mortal characters of the episode. In Il iad 22 we find both mortal and divine scenes when Achilles and Hector duel, with the narration intercutting back and forth between the two.16 Undoubtedly in epic, as on the vases, there were varying ways of indicat ing the mortal and divine aspects of a psychostasia. A second difficulty in seeing Achilles and Memnon on the neck of the Melian vase, however, is the armor that is neatly arranged between the warriors. In later images the heroes often duel over the corpse of An tilochus, who had been killed by Memnon. On the Melian amphora there is no corpse, but rather the set of armor. This has led some critics to sup 14- Athens nm 3961 (911); limc s.w. 'Achilleus' no. 846, 'Aias V no. 74. 15. Kossatz-Deissmann 1981 (limc s.w. 'Achilleus') under no. 846; at 1992, 460 (limc s.v. 'Memnon') she hesitates to identify any work before the sixth century as Achilles and Memnon dueling. 16. The divine scenes occur at 167-187, where Zeus is rebuked by Athena for consid ering the rescue of Hector and then given permission to go to the battlefield and assist Achilles, and at 209-213, the kerostasia itself. Athena intersects the realms by moving from the divine to the mortal, and Apollo as well as Athena demonstrates how divinities, dis guised or unseen, can interfere in mortal combat.</page><page sequence="6">38 JONATHAN S. BURGESS pose that another scene is depicted, like Ajax and Diomedes dueling over Sarpedon's armor at the funeral of Patroclus, as narrated in II. 23, or Odysseus and Ajax menacing each other over the arms of Achilles, con cerning which they famously quarreled. But the two women on each side do not fit in with these interpretations. The armor on the field instead of the corpse of Antilochus is no major problem for the identification of Achilles and Memnon here, for Antilochus is not an essential element in imagery of their duel. And perhaps the artist has depicted armor that has been stripped off Antilochus or some other warrior. Friis Johansen was surely right to insist this is Achilles and Memnon, as in fact the work is "generally, and with the greatest feasibility" interpreted.17 In particular, the participation of the females points to the encounter between the best of the Achaeans and the king of the Aethiopians. Before moving on, it is important to note the balance and opposition in the details of the image.18 In stance both the females and the warriors mir ror one another. Of help to the composition is the arrangement of the larger scene below on the belly of the vase: the central horse is directly below the duel, and it is surrounded by figures balanced on either side, facing inwards toward the middle. Directly below these at the foot of the vase are the images of two women, separated by a slit, facing each other. Other aspects also contribute to the polarity of the duel scene. The female on the left, whom I take to be Thetis, has a dark head covering, whereas the female on the right does not.19 Achilles has a dark helmet, whereas Memnon's is light-colored. The left female's dark robe covers over red cloth, but the right female's clothing has red over black. All of these fac tors emphasize the balance inherent in the myth portrayed, the duel be tween two very evenly matched heroes. Next let us consider an earlier piece, an Attic bowl stand from the be ginning of the seventh century (Figg. 2-5).20 Three scenes are depicted. The largest and apparently central scene has five figures (Figg. 3-4). To the right of this is a smaller scene, that of a duel over a corpse on the ground (Fig. 5). To the left is yet another conflict depicted. This scene is poorly preserved, but it is apparent that one figure has two heads and four legs 17. Filis Johansen 1967, 279-280. This identification is seen likely at Fittschen 1969, 178 179; Hurwit 1985, 152; Ahlberg-Cornell 1992, 70-71 (conflation with the duel over Sarpe don's armor); Gantz 1993, 623. Osborne 1998a, 61-63 considers the duel anonymous. For other possible seventh-century scenes of Achilles and Memnon, see Fittschen 1969, 178 179; Stansbury-O'Donnell 1999, 25. 18. For analysis of these elements, see Papastamos 1970, 24-29; Osborne 1998a, 61-63. 19. Thetis has a dark head covering at II. 24, 93; see Slatkin 1991, 94-96. 20. Munich 8936.

It will be obvious below that I do not accept Ahlberg-Corneirs Homeric interpretation, which Snodgrass effectively counters.</page><page sequence="7">EARLY IMAGES OF ACHILLES AND MEMNON? 39 coming out of his waist (Fig. 2). Therefore it is likely to be the Siamese twin of early Greek myth, Aktorione/Molione, whose presence on a number of late geometric vases has been generally accepted.21 He is wounded, which suggests that it is Heracles on the right who faces him. Aktorione/Molione encourages us to look for mythological meaning in the other scenes, but they have in fact puzzled many. In the central scene (Figg. 3-4), we see two warriors facing each other, with two females reaching out to them from behind. There have been some doubts ex pressed as to whether the central figures are fighting, but it seems clear to me that they are threatening one another with the swords, not merely handing them over. The fact that two women stand on each side of appar ently dueling warriors led the stand's publisher, Vierneisel, to identify the image as the duel of Achilles and Memnon. At first glance, this seems at tractive. As with the duel scene on the Melian amphora, balance is stressed. The two women and the warriors are mirror images of each other, to the point that the warrior on the right fights with his left arm. Yet problems remain. What does the central staff with two birds signify, for instance? Why do the women hold branches in their hands? And who is the man arriving on the far left, apparently a hunter with his catch? Other interpretations have been suggested: Fittschen proposed Orestes slaying Aegisthus and Ahlberg-Cornell argued for the peaceful aftermath of the duel between Hector and Ajax in book 7 of the Iliad. But these are even less corresponding to the iconography and have not found favor. It may indeed be best to follow Fittschen's first inclination, subsequently maintained by Snodgrass, that the scene is mythological yet unidentifi able.22 But further considerations should encourage us to consider the Achilles-Memnon identification as a real possibility. In the lower half of the field between the left female and the warrior in front of her are a num ber of chevrons; presumably they existed in the missing section between the warrior and female on the right. More than fillers, they may serve as a weak border that establishes a vague separation of the females from the warriors. The separation is certainly not complete, for the female on the left touches the warrior in front of her, whereas the one on the left touches the baldric of the left warrior. But one might compare the Melian amphora with its borders between the females on either side of the cen tral duelists, borders which I described above as signifying the essential division between the divine and mortal dimensions. 21. See recent discussion at Snodgrass 1998, 38-33, with limc s.v. 'Aktorione', where the Attic stand is no. 13. 22. Fittschen 1969, 196, with n.936 (suggesting Orestes and Aegisthus); Snodgrass 1998, 82.</page><page sequence="8">40 JONATHAN S. BURGESS Yet on this central scene of the Attic stand I do not think the separation is between divine mothers and their sons. For the central figures are prob ably not actually dueling heroes. Instead they may be eidola of Achilles and Memnon, presenting an iconic representation of the duel between the heroes. Situated between two concerned females, they are reminis cent of the Achilles-Memnon duel but are too static to represent an ongo ing duel of flesh-and-blood mortals. Their gestures are threatening, but unrealistic and frozen in an otherworldly manner.23 Later artists some times depicted the eidola of the heroes threatening each other as they stood in their respective pan of the scales. Here we could see the same phenomenon, only with human-size eidola. In epic, eidola, psychai, and keres are apparently full-size; artists only later arrived at the convention of portraying these as miniature figures so as to distinguish them from the living. In this case the incomplete, lower borders could serve to announce the categorical difference between goddesses and the eidola. That the central scene actually depicts a psychostasia seems possible when we notice the striking prop between the warrior figure: a tall, central staff with a crossbar upon which two birds sit.24 This mechanism may signify scales, and the birds on it could signify souls being weighed. As we saw above, there is some suggestion in Greek myth and literature that psychai were winged or bird-like. Greek iconography often depicted souls as winged; Vermeule has linked such iconography with the Egyp tian Ba-soul, shown as a bird with a human head.25 I admit that the "scales" and "souls" are sketched out too briefly to suggest this clearly, but the facing warriors may serve to complete the concept. The con junction of warriors, staff, crossbar, and birds could signify with iconic shorthand that a duel is being decided by divine judgement. The mother deities on either side then display concern not for their sons in the flesh, but for the fate that is about to be decided. The branches they carry would signify their state of supplication as they anxiously await the immortal decision that will decide the fate of their sons.26 It is certainly not the canonical iconography for scales and psychai, but that is not what we 23. Snodgrass 1998, 81 comments that "there is something undeniably martial about the two central figures, even if they are not fighting at the moment". 24.1 take the volutes on either side as emblematic and decorative; Vierneisel 1967, 241 supposes they may be leaves or branches of a living or cut tree. Since the bottom is frag mented and worn, it is impossible to be definitive, but it appears to me that the base is of artificial construction. A tree would be inconducive to my argument for scales, though it is worth noting that on a Campanian amphora at the end of the fourth century the divine scales of the psychostasia hang from a tree (Leiden ammi; limc s.v. Achilleus1 no. 805). 25. Vermeule 1979, 65, 75-77. 26. The carrying of branches occurred in a variety of circumstances, including suppli cation, sacrifice, revelry, and competition. On vases they can occur in mythological as</page><page sequence="9">EARLY IMAGES OF ACHILLES AND MEMNON? 41 should expect at this date. Instead it may be an ambitious and prototypical image of the psychostasia. All that may be suggestive, but there is still the hunter who carries an animal in one hand, with others hanging from a stick held over his shoul der. The figure greatly resembles the motif of the "returning hunter" on later vases.27 Here the hunter holds an animal in front of him, perhaps a hare or deer, perhaps still alive. Though the vase is fragmented behind the hunter it is clear that the same type of animal, in reverse, is hanging from the hunter's stick. A line crosses through this animal, perhaps signi fying the arrow that killed it.28 Most associate the hunter with the central group of two warriors and two women; it is sometimes supposed that the hunter is bringing a live animal to a sacrificial scene. Whereas as for Snod grass the hunter figure precludes the central scene from being Trojan myth, Vierneisel viewed him as an independent figure, noting the indica tions of borders on each side of him.29 In this he is partly correct, yet the half length of the border between the hunter and the central scene sug gests some connection with what follows to his right. If that is so, it is not immediately clear how a hunter should be linked with myth about Memnon and Achilles. But there is another way of inter preting the hunter that not only allows viewing the two warriors as Achilles and Memnon, but actually supports it. There is a mythological figure routinely depicted as a hunter who carries his catch over one shoul der: Chiron, the pedagogue of Achilles. I propose, therefore, that this hunter at least suggests the centaur Chiron. That may seem a perverse in terpretation, since the hunter does not have the backside of a horse, and therefore cannot be intended as a centaur. But in early Greek art centaurs commonly appear as a normal man to whom the narrow backside of a horse is abruptly and unconvincingly joined. As well, in Attic art Chiron was routinely depicted as completely human in the front, unlike most centaurs who were shown as quadruped horses from which the torso of a human sprouted (Gisler-Huwiller 1986, 247). As well, borders or land scape items were sometimes used to obscure or eliminate Chiron's bestial well as "real world" situations. Scholars have tended to associate the branches here with sacrifice, referring to the animal which the hunter carries (see below). 27. See Fittschen 1969, 66-67; Schnapp 1997,194-195, 236-41; Barringer 2001, 41, 58, 80-84, 108,123,175-176. 28. The composition of the two hanging animals in reverse image is comparable to that of the two birds in the central scene. Moreover, the stick over the hunter's shoulder with the two hanging animals is reminiscent of a carrier balancing two bundles on a pole, which in itself is comparable to scales. See Michaelidou 2000, 129-130, with fig. 4, where this carrying method is seen as the origin for the concept of scales. 29. It was perhaps unfair of Vierneisel not to have an illustration of the hunter, but this raises a significant point: that from the viewer's perspective the hunter is not visible in the central scene when seen head on, as in Vierneisers Fig. 3.</page><page sequence="10">42 JONATHAN S. BURGESS hindquarters.30 On the Attic stand there may simply be a lack of space for a full centaur; as it is, the hanging prey interrupt the chevron and hour glass border.31 It is possible, then, that the hunter iconography, in connection with Achilles, brings Chiron to mind. Centaurs are often shown as hunters, for whom the "returning hunter' motif seems to have originated; in Archaic art it was more commonly used for centaurs than humans and especially for Chiron.32 Chiron is routinely shown with the spoil of game slung over his shoulder when receiving the young Achilles for tutelage. It is also pos sible for us to see the hunter on the Attic stand as Peleus, who shared with Chiron an interest in hunting.33 The identification does not really matter if the essential function of the hunter figure is to evoke Achilles' boyhood in Phthia, especially his training in hunting. In this context it is suggestive that the hunter on the Attic stand holds an apparently live animal forth in his hand. In an important article, Robbins (1993) emphasizes the importance of the training of Achilles by Chiron. He notes that the centaur whose name is etymologically linked to the "hand" was famed in myth for teaching skills of the hand to young heroes such as Achilles. Primary among these skills is hunting, and by extension, 30. Chiron abruptly cut off before his hind horse legs by a border or cave: limc s.v. 'Cheiron' nos. 18 (Louvre ca 156), 47 (lost, once Rome). On a vase in Berlin (F 1901; limc s.v. 'Achilleus' no. 22), the border eliminates all but the human front of Chiron. Cf. the red-figure vase (London F 151; limc s.v. 'Cheiron' no. 103) that depicts a scene from a co medy, in which a human character identified as Chiron by inscription is pushed from behind by a doubled over man, with the outline suggesting a centaur. 31. The small image immediately by the hunter's back shoulder is not clear, but I take it to be a bird that has been killed. It could also be compared to the volutes on the central staff, which are arguably leaves (see n. 24 above). Centaurs were typically portrayed car rying branches over their shoulders with many side branches and leaves. Here I think it unlikely that a single sprig or leaf is shown sprouting from the stick. I recognize that a stick instead of branch over the shoulder is unusual for Chiron, though he sometimes carries a staff in addition to the branch. 32. Schnapp 1997, 194-195. Schmidt-Dounas 1989, 71-72 emphasizes hunting aspects of both Oriental and early Greek centaur images in her argument that the hybrid is of east ern derivation. 33. In myth Peleus was associated with the Calydonian boar hunt, and was rescued by Chiron from the machinations of Akastos during a hunting trip on Mt. Pelion. On scenes of the reception of Achilles by Chiron, Peleus can appear as a hunter, with petasos, hun ting spears, and even a hound (see Schnapp 1997, 443-444). I do not quite agree with Bar ringer 2001, 226 n. 48 that the "returning hunter" motif was "grafted" onto Chiron icono graphy or with Schnapp 1997, 437 that Chiron in Archaic art was a "fusion" of the return ing hunter and centaur. Though conflation undoubtedly is at play on the black-figure va ses, the "returning hunter" motif is as least as old for centaurs and Chiron as for non mythological hunters. It should also be noted that in the later iconography live hares carried by "returning hunters" signified an erotic gift in p?d?rastie contexts, which has no bearing on the Attic stand.</page><page sequence="11">EARLY IMAGES OF ACHILLES AND MEMNON? 43 killing. In addition, Robbins discusses accounts of the young Achilles feeding on still-living animals to gain courage and speed.34 The literary sources for this concept are late, but it is already implied by the Berlin vase from the early seventh century that shows Chiron with game when receiving Achilles; in addition, Pindar seems to allude to the concept.35 By juxtaposing the hunter image with the psychostasia and duel scenes, the Attic stand would thus link Achilles' boyhood training with his later suc cess at Troy.36 Of course, a hunter figure, Chiron or Peleus, does not be long at Troy. But the semi-border of chevrons discourages us from as suming there is an equation of place or chronology for the two separated fields. The hunter is to be thought to evoke a different time and place, the boyhood training of Achilles at Phthia. What of the scene that follows to the right of the central scene, depict ing a duel over a corpse (Fig. 5)? Vierneisel (245) suggested Achilles and Hector over Troilos; I prefer to see the warriors he saw in the central scene, Achilles and Memnon. The iconography readily brings to mind later images of Achilles dueling Memnon over the corpse of Antilochos. A tall bird with squiggly lines gives us another weak border, one which al lows a connection between the scenes but indicates a temporal and spatial separation. Or rather, this is a dimensional separation that divides the di 34- The hunter on the Attic stand may hold a hare or deer; in some sources a deer is specified for the diet of the youthful Achilles, and Robertson 1940, 180 explains that here by Achilles is to gain speed, whereas animals such as the lion would give him courage. Thus the Attic stand may allude to the essential quality of "swift-footed" Achilles. His speed is not merely a decorative epithet, it is the central characteristic of his mythologi cal career, whether he is outrunning Troilus on horseback, engaging in a deadly footrace with Hector, or losing his life with his speed when wounded in the lower leg by Paris. 35. Robertson 1940, building upon Beazley. 36. Cf. the possible conjunction of the hunting Chiron and the warrior Achilles on the votive terracotta shield in Nauplion (4509; limc s.v. 'Amazones' no. 168), which shows a centaur with a fawn hanging from a branch on one side and a warrior fighting an Ama zon (Penthesileia?) on the other. This is roughly contemporary to the Attic stand and also could be thought to pair the origins of Achilles (hunting Chiron) with his later suc cess at Troy (defeat of Penthesileia, not Memnon, in this case). Consider also the Etrus can chariot from the sixth century with bronze reliefs (limc s.v. 'Achle' no. 123; ny 03.23.1) that probably depicts several scenes from the life of Achilles (see Hampe and Simon 1964, 53-65, with plates 22-25). Chiron with game slung over his shoulder is shown with the young Achilles directly beneath a scene of two warriors duelling. Note also that in the Cypria (fr. 3 Bernab?) Chiron gave Peleus the spear later used by Achilles, and that at Phi lostratus 2, 2 Achilles' future success at Troy is stressed during a description of his trai ning by Chiron (featuring fawns and hares), and the hunting/war relation is also sig nified by vases that depict a chariot on scenes of Chiron receiving Achilles (see Schnapp 1997, 446). Chiron is also commonly shown with game in scenes of Peleus abducting Thetis, or at the wedding of Peleus and Thetis. In all these scenes the "returning hunter" motif may point ahead to training of Achilles, who results from the pairing of Peleus and Thetis.</page><page sequence="12">44 JONATHAN S. BURGESS vine from mortal realms. The left scene could represent the psychostasia which occurs at Olympus. The scene to the right, then, could represent the duel in the mortal realm, which Achilles on the left is about to win (the warrior on the right appears to have been wounded by the spear of the one on the left).37 One might object that the warriors are not por trayed the same way in each scene, especially in terms of armor, and in any event repetition of one figure in two contiguous scenes would be un usual at this early date.38 But in my analysis we are not viewing exact rep etition of Achilles and Memnon; rather, first there is a representation of their eidola in the balance on the divine plane, followed by a depiction of Memnon and Achilles in the flesh in the following frame. As I noted above, at a later date artists sometimes placed the psychostasia on the same plane as the duel, the divine scene left and the mortal one to the right.39 Here we see the same arrangement, though with a half-border between, whereas the later images rather remarkably have none at all. I hope to have shown that it is possible to revisit and transform Vierneisers original identification of the central scene as Achilles and Memnon. One image on the vase (Fig. 2), it is commonly agreed, depicts the Siamese twins Aktorione/Molione (probably losing to Heracles). This identification encourages us to seek a mythological interpretation of 37- Though the image suits the "rule" that the victor should be on the left, it does not follow the "rule" that the head of the corpse point toward the victor (see Snodgrass 1998, 106, in reference the Rhodian plate depicting Hector and Menelaus over Euphorbos). One cannot expect a vase so early to adhere to these later tendencies, however, and anyway these "rules" were not rigidly followed: Vierneisel 1967, 241-242; Brinkmann 1985, 118-119; Stansbury-O'Donnell 1999, 82. The left warrior sports a "Boeotian" shield, which as a heroic prop (Snodgrass 1998, 80) would then be most appropriate for Achilles. The baldric in mid-field above the corpse may signify armor that Memnon was attempt ing to strip from Antilochus; cf. the armor between the duelists on the Melian vase di scussed above. 38. Snodgrass 1998, 81 objects to the repetition of Ajax and Hector in Ahlberg-Cornel l's analysis. 39. This arrangement is found on one of the earliest certain depictions of the psycho stasia, Vienna iv 3619 (limc s.v. 'Achilleus' no. 799=820). Here the great number of figures and apparently two separate depictions of the duel scene can seem confusing. We also find the arrangement on a frieze of the Siphnian Treasury at Delphi (limc s.v. 'Memnon' no. 14; for years, in the prevailing Homer-centric approach to mythological iconogra phy, this was thought to depict the kerostasia and duel of Patroclus and Sarpedon, not Achilles and Memnon, until Brinkmann 1985 proved otherwise by recovery of the origi nal inscriptions). The horizontal arrangement is again found on the Ionian hydria at Rome (Villa Giulia; limc s.v. 'Memnon' no. 16). Cf. the late fourth-century vase (Leiden ammi; limc s.v. 'Achilleus' no. 805) that through lack of groundline is able to show the weighing above and to one side of the duel. Images that show Achilles and Memnon with Hermes holding scales between them, or indeed even just the duelists encircled by their mothers, can be thought of as truncated versions of the full Olympian-battlefield arrangement.</page><page sequence="13">EARLY IMAGES OF ACHILLES AND MEMNON? 45 the complex and highly charged imagery elsewhere. The Aktorione/Mo lione scene is enclosed on both sides by borders, most firmly with the spi rals to the left but also by the lower chevron and upper hourglass designs to the right (broken by the hunter's prey, as noted above); this scene can be considered to be the "back" of the vase, unconnected to the rest of the iconography.40 The rest of the imagery then constitutes one central scene in three parts. In the very center the presence of anxious females behind warriors recalls the Achilles/Memnon story, as Vierneisel saw. Yet in my interpretation it is the judgment scene that is indicated, not the duel. The central staff mechanism with its crossbar serves to represent the scales used in psychostasia scenes. The birds in conjunction with the threatening yet static, frozen warriors suggest the ddola of Achilles and Memnon, caught in the balance, while the branches held by the females signify the supplicatory state of the divine mothers. To the left we see the hunter with his prey, separated by a half border. He conveys the impression of Chiron or is perhaps Peleus; that is, he suggests the origins of Achilles' martial skills at a different time and place. This interpretation would allow us to conclude that the stand has a rather sophisticated collocation of scenes, with location, time, and dimen sion subtly interwoven. The Aktorione/Molione scene (Fig. 2) is strongly separated by full borders from the rest of the imagery, and therefore is en tirely independent. The rest of imagery is all connected. Starting with the hunter (Fig. 3), we are encouraged by his movement toward the right, as well as by the hounds running to the right on the neck above, to continue on to the central scene (Figg. 3 and 4) and then finally to the duel imagery further to the right (Fig. 5).41 With the hunter we start with Achilles' tem poral and geographical origins, before moving swiftly to the most impor tant and famous incident of his life, his encounter with Memnon. Both as pects of this episode, the divine moment of judgment and the bloody bat tle on earth, are depicted. Here the two scenes are almost concurrent, since a psychostasia occurs after a duel has begun, but there is still a slight progression in time, since the divine judgement must precede the deci sive end of the duel. No figure is repeated, though the first two fields (hunter, psychostasia) are thematically related to Achilles, who is shown in the duel on the right. The setting changes in all three fields (Phthia, Olym pus, Troy), and moving from left to right we see a temporal progression. The lack of repetition of character, along with the multiplicity of time and 40. Cf. Snodgrass 1998, 78, who calls the wavy line between the Aktorione/Molione image and the duel scene the "back". 41. Note also the hound and bird designs on dresses of the central females, which also support viewing movement to the right. As well they might reflect certain thematic aspects of the main figures (hound-hunter; birds-feeres).</page><page sequence="14">46 JONATHAN S. BURGESS space, qualifies for what has been termed the "serial" or "episodic" style of pictorial narration.42 That level of sophistication might seem surprising for this time, and many will prefer not to impose such an explanation on the imagery, or to conclude that the artist was mistaken or clumsy in his iconography. But I believe that the stand links its visualization of the com plex and rather abstract concept of a psychostasia with two independent images on either side. Such sophistication should not be thought impossi ble during the active and experimental transition from Geometric to Ar chaic art.43 The above interpretation of two vases implies that by the seventh cen tury the story of Achilles and Memnon had its place in the mythological tradition. Though that cannot be proven, there is no reason to doubt that the basic elements of their story - a duel between evenly balanced heroes, the concern of their divine mothers, divine judgment - reach far into pre history. To emphasize that point, I want to move backwards to the Bronze Age, where one can find thematic connections between the psy chostasia and a fresco scene from the "Cult Center" at Mycenae.44 The fresco was situated over a platform, with a lower fresco scene down be low to one side. The iconography of both frescoes has attracted much at tention. The lower image shows a female holding shafts of grain, with the paws of an animal visible below. It has been thought that this is some sort of agricultural goddess or potnia theron. Interesting as that is, it is the up per, larger fresco scene on which I will focus (Fig. 6). Here two white skinned females face one another. Unfortunately the upper half is dam aged, but we can still make out that the left female has a sword resting with its point down, whereas the right one has a scepter. More remark ably yet, there are two miniature figures seemingly floating in mid-air. The lower figure is of solid black color, whereas the upper one is all red. Neither seems to be clothed. What should we make of this image? It is usually thought that the fe male on the left with the sword is a goddess, and it is often suspected that the one on the right is one too. As for the tiny figures in the middle, it is most interesting that they have been interpreted as eidola.45 What that 42. Cf. Hurwit 1985, 172-174, 311, 349; Stansbury-O'Donnell 1999, 139-142.

If the figures are psy chai perhaps the fresco represents some kind of interaction between di vinities and two souls of the dead. We do not really know whether the Mycenaeans had any conception of psychai or how they would represent them.46 But the two miniature figures bring to mind the later psychostasia imagery, and indeed additional details encourage that analogy.47 The fresco seems to feature two goddesses; in the psychostasia scenes two di vine mothers are key figures. On the fresco the divinities display emblems of divine power, a scepter and a sword. The scepter of Zeus is common in the psychostasia scenes, and of course swords are frequent in the duel scenes that are mixed or joined with the psychostasia. Two warriors crossed swords over a central implement in the Attic stand examined above. And at times in the psychostasia images, scales appear to be actually joined to the scepter of Zeus or the caduceus of Hermes.48 In any event, we certainly see in the Mycenaean fresco themes of opposition and dual ity, as in later psychostasia scenes.49 The two large female figures stand fac ing one another, as the warriors and divine mothers do in psychostasia im agery. On the fresco the two eidola face in the same direction, but are dis tinguished by color, one dark and one red. The coloring of the small figures is very suggestive. In Quintus of Smyrna the ker of Memnon is described as dark (?ge^vaiT]) and the ker of Achilles is said to be light (qpaiocf]; 2, 510-511). Quintus describes keres standing by the duelists, with only a brief mention of scales later (540-541). Yet this is our only surviving literary description of the psychostasia of Achilles and Memnon, and it does insist on a color differentiation be tween the two keres, comparable to that on the fresco. In addition, accord ing to the color conventions of Aegean frescoes the red figure should indi 48-49 argues on the basis of comparative iconography that they are votaries; Haider 1994,138-139 sees them as mortal. 46. Vermeule 1979, 65 terms "the first psyche in Greek art" an image with "bat-like" wings on a Tanagra larnax appearing in a funerary context; see further Immerwahr 1990, 155,158. In later Greek art eidola are often winged. On the possibility of a Mycenaean con ception of the psyche as bird-like or butterfly-like, see further below. 47. Marinatos 1998, 248 must be thinking of the psychostasia when she says that she ini tially interpreted them as "figurines, suspended and held by one of the goddesses." She excludes this interpretation because there is no indication of "strings" in the image, and the hands of the divinities are not placed in the right position. One would wish more was preserved above the eidola, however, especially where the scepter reaches above them. 48. In addition, Marinatos 1998, 248 interprets the apparently outsized fingers of the figures as branches, which might be compared to the branches carried by the two fe males on the Attic stand. In my view, however, these are the figures' hands. 49. Morgan, forthcoming, stresses the duality not only of this fresco but in the lower one, citing parallels in Aegean and Near Eastern art and religion.</page><page sequence="16">48 JONATHAN S. BURGESS cate an Aegean male and the dark figure an African male.50 That the dark eidolon could signify an African is startling in the context of my analysis, since Memnon was king of the Aethiopians. Caution is required here, since though Memnon and his Aethiopians came to be localized in Africa, in early Greek mythology it seems they were an entirely mythical people placed vaguely in the East (Memnon is the son of Dawn, after all). Yet some of the earliest literary references are ambiguous; at Od. 4, 84, for in stance, it appears that the Aethiopians are placed somewhere around the Levant and north Africa. And Drew Griffith has recently argued (1998) for an early African location for the mythological Aethiopians, reviving the argument that an Egyptian pharaoh, Amenhotep III, was the historical in spiration for the mythical Memnon. It gives one further pause that some connections can be made between the fresco and Egypt. Rehak (1992, 45) identifies the "cut-away" feature of the architectural design on the fresco as Egyptian, and Egyptian objects were found in the room of the fresco, as elsewhere at Mycenae. Indeed, next to the low platform below these fres cos was found a faience plaque of Amenhotep III, the very same pharaoh that Griffith supports as the historical inspiration for Memnon.51 It is not my intention, despite that intriguing collocation of associa tions, to argue that the fresco portrays the psychostasia of Achilles and Memnon, or some prototype of that story current in the Mycenaean Egyptian axis of the second millennium. There is no evidence that Achilles and Memnon were known in the Bronze Age, let alone a story of the two dueling. Indeed, mythological iconography has not been cer tainly identified in Mycenaean iconography. In any event there are no scales visible in the fresco, and one cannot readily identify either female as a goddess that we know of from later mythology. And it is not obvious that a mythological scene would be appropriate within the obviously reli gious context of the room and Cult Center.52 But without insisting on any strong link between the fresco and the later psychostasia scenes, it is possi ble to make conceptual connections. The fresco could depict some scene of divine decision or judgment, with the eidola indicating the polarity of possible outcomes. It is also relevant to note that though we do not see scales in this fresco, there is some evidence that a profound significance was attached to them in the Bronze Age.53 First of all, it has been thought that non-Greek proto types for the later psychostasia motif date from that time. Hittite parallels 50. Immerwahr 1990, 96; Rehak 1992, 49; Haider 1994,138-142. 51. Rehak 1992, 59, with n. 205.

In the Egyptian under world, as seen in illustrations of spells from the Book of the Dead, the heart of a deceased man was weighed in the scales against Maat, the di vine personification of truth or justice.54 In addition, scales made of gold foil were found in the shaft graves at Mycenae. These were obviously non-utilitarian and must have had some symbolic significance. Vermeule points out that the butterflies impressed on the pans of some are reminiscent of later renderings of a psyche.55 In this connection it is notable that for Aristotle and later authors psyche could refer to a butterfly.56 It is also worth noting the well-known Bronze Age krater from Enkomi called the "Zeus" krater, so named because the figure apparently using scales has been thought to be Zeus judging the fate of two riders in a chariot.57 We need not have confidence that this is Zeus, but it is further evidence of scales with profound significance in the Bronze Age. In conclusion, a plausible case for the Melian amphora and a possible case for the Attic stand can be made for early representations of the Achilles-Memnon encounter. What is more, it is possible that key the matic components of their story were already present in the Bronze Age. The general themes of the iconography that we have examined include the intersection of the divine and the mortal dimensions, significant em blems of divine power such as the scepter and scales, and ddola. Balance and polarity are present in these scenes, which I have suggested portray a moment of fate in which judgment is made by the divine and conse quences are realized for mortals. It is an intriguing aspect of this investiga tion that Egypt has sometimes been seen as a source for images or con cepts. Be that as it may, in the very least I would conclude from this evi dence that the story of Memnon and Achilles is not a post-Homeric inven tion. There is some indication that artists knew it by at least the time that many now date the Homeric poems, and there is also evidence that the roots for some of its concepts lie much further back in time. University of Toronto well as their metaphoric significance, see Michaelidou 2000. Athanassakis 1994,127 cites a modern Greek folksong in which the pains of being away from home, "xenitia", is found heaviest when weighed on a golden scale with death, sorrow, and love. 54. For the Hittite comparanda, see Puhvel 1983. For the Egyptian, cf. Dietrich 1965, 294-296; Vermeule 1979, 76-77, 160-162; West 1997, 393-394; R. Griffith 1998, 215; Michaeli dou 2000, 141-147.
