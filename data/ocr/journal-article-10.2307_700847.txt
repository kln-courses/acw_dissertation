<plain_text><page sequence="1">Kantharos. Studies in Dionysiac and Kindred Cult. By GEORGE W. ELDERKIN. Princeton Monographs in Art and Archaeology. Pp. 241 with io Plates. London : H. Milford, for Princeton University Press, Princeton, 1924. Price 52s. THIS expensive book is beautifully printed and illustrated. To criticise its contents is frankly beyond me. The first article attempts to show that the archaic Spartan grave stelae represent Dionysos and Persephone welcoming the souls of the deceased and belong to the cult of the Kabeiroi, which was early introduced into Laconia and Lydia. I don't believe that the theory is true, but we here still retain an occasional contact with reality. As one pro- gresses, however, through this collection of forty-one essays the revels become wilder and wilder and we are soon lost in the bewildering uproar of an etymological 'Walpurgisnacht.' The sensation is of a nightmare of rapid incon- sequential sequences of mad adventure. Every- thing turns into something else, usually a 'curved object, sickle (?)'; fetishes become anthropomorphic gods and ascend to heaven as solar deities. Here one may learn how Prometheus began his career as a fetish fire- stick: how Zeus Lykaios = sickle Zeus = Saturn = Kronos, and how ' in the theriomorphic stage of the cult, the sickle-fetish was superseded by the wolf, which 'because of its slashing habits with its sabre- or sickle-tooth was eminently qualified to act as the animal embodiment of the God': how Sarpedon, or sickle-tooth, is related to Lykia, the sickle land, Lykourgos, the sickle maker, and Mithras, who was sickle god before he had to do with the sun; how Mars, Zeus, Ouranos were originally earth gods; how the Kerkopes, Kekrops, and Hercules are all sickle heroes, and Poseidon's trident is really an agricultural fork; how Apollo and Hercules, mirabile dictu, are the same in origin, and the name Caesar is really another form of Kabeiros. All this and many not less surprising discoveries may be read in the pages of this (shall we say?) remarkable and imaginative work. W. R. HALLIDAY.</page></plain_text>
